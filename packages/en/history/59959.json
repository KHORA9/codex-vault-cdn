In deference to\r\nthe wholesome advice of many reviewers, both in the London and\r\nProvincial press, especially that of the ‘Times’ and the ‘Athenæum,’ I\r\nhave re-arranged the whole of the chapters on ‘Patronymics’ and\r\n‘Nicknames,’ subdividing the same under convenient heads. By so doing\r\nthe names which bear any particular relationship to one another will be\r\nfound more closely allied than they were under their former more general\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nMy book has met with much criticism, partly favourable, partly adverse,\r\nfrom different quarters. To my reviewers in general I offer my best\r\nthanks for their comments. The ‘Saturday Review’—and I say it the more\r\nreadily as they will see that I have not been insensible to the value of\r\ntheir criticism—has not, I think, sufficiently understood the nature of\r\nmy work. I am well aware that praise is due to them for having for some\r\nlength of time strenuously advocated the claim of our language to be\r\nEnglish through all its varying stages. I do not see that in the general\r\ncharacter of my book I have lost sight of this fact. An ‘English\r\nDirectory’ is not an ‘English Dictionary.’ The influences that have been\r\nat work on our language are not the same as those upon our nomenclature.\r\nEvery social casualty had an effect upon our names which it could not\r\nhave upon our words. The names found in Domesday Book, casting aside the\r\nnew importation, were, in the great majority of cases, obsolete by the\r\nend of the twelfth century, and of those which have survived and\r\ndescended to us as surnames, well-nigh all are devoid of diminutive or\r\npatronymic desinences—a clear proof that they were utterly out of\r\nfashion as personal names during the era of surname formation. The\r\nNorman invasion was not a conquest of our language, but it was of our\r\nnomenclature. The ‘Saturday Review’ may still demand that we shall view\r\nall as English, and obliterate the distinctive terms of Saxon and\r\nNorman, but in doing so let us not forget facts. The language which\r\npreceded the Norman Conquest is still the _vehicle_ of ordinary\r\nconverse. The nomenclature of that period went down like Pharaoh’s\r\nchariot, and like Pharaoh’s chariot, which for all I know lies where it\r\ndid, was never recovered.\r\n\r\nA review in the ‘Guardian’ demands a brief notice on account of the\r\nmischief it may do. The end kept in view by the reviewer is as\r\ntransparent as his inability to reach it. Surely the day is past for any\r\nfurther attempt to make out that we have no _metronymic_ surnames. The\r\nwriter is evidently unaware of the fact that the use of ‘ie’ and ‘y,’ as\r\nin ‘Teddy’ or ‘Johnnie,’ in the nineteenth century, does not prevail to\r\nas great an extent as that of ‘ot’ and ‘et’ from the twelfth to the\r\nfifteenth. As ‘Philip’ became ‘Philipot,’ now ‘Philpott’; as ‘William,’\r\n‘Williamot,’ now ‘Wilmott’; as ‘Hew’ (or Hugh), ‘Hewet’ and ‘Hewetson’;\r\nas ‘Ellis’ (or Elias), ‘Elliot’ and ‘Elliotson’; so ‘Till’ (Matilda)\r\nbecame ‘Tillot’ and ‘Tillotson’; ‘Emme’ (Emma), ‘Emmott,’ ‘Emmett,’ and\r\n‘Emmotson’; ‘Ibbe’ (Isabella), ‘Ibbott,’ ‘Ibbett,’ and ‘Ibbotson’;\r\n‘Mary,’ ‘Mariot’ and ‘Marriott’; and ‘Siss’ (Cecilia), ‘Sissot’ and\r\n‘Sissotson.’ ‘Emmot,’ the writer says, is a form of ‘Amyas,’ I suppose\r\nbecause he saw ‘Amyot’ in Miss Yonge’s glossary. According to him,\r\ntherefore, Emmot is a masculine name. How comes it to pass, then, that\r\nEmmot is _always_ Latinised as Emmota, or that in our old marriage\r\nlicences ‘Richard de Akerode’ gets a dispensation to marry ‘Emmotte de\r\nGreenwood’ (Test. Ebor. iii. 317), or ‘Roger Prestwick’ to marry ‘Emmote\r\nCrossley’ (ditto, 338)? How is it we meet with such entries as\r\n‘Cissot_a_ West,’ (Index) or ‘Syssot that was _wife_ of Patrick’ (69)?\r\nHow is it again that Mariot is registered as ‘Mariot_a_ in le Lane,’ or\r\n‘John fil. Mariot_æ_,’ and Ibbot or Ibbet as ‘Ibbot_a_ fil. Adæ,’ or\r\n‘Robert fil. Ibot_æ_,’ (Index)? The fact is, we have a large class of\r\nmetronymics many of which doubtless arose from posthumous birth, or from\r\nadoption, or the more important character of the mother in the eyes of\r\nthe neighbours than the father, others too from illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nAmongst other errors for which I have been called to account, the oddest\r\nis that of attributing to Miss Muloch the authorship of Miss Yonge’s\r\nmost useful and laborious work on Christian names. I do not know to\r\nwhich lady I owe the deepest apology—whether to Miss Yonge for robbing\r\nher literary crown of one of its brightest jewels, or to Miss Muloch for\r\nappearing to insinuate that hers was incomplete. This and several other\r\nmistakes of less moment I have rectified in the present edition.\r\n\r\nI have to thank the authoress of ‘Mistress Margery,’ etc., for the names\r\nin the index marked QQ., RR. 1, RR. 2, and RR. 3. Such entries from the\r\nregistry of St. James’s, Piccadilly (QQ.), as ‘Repentance Tompson’\r\n(1688), ‘Loving Bell’ (1693), ‘Nazareth Rudde’ (1695), ‘Obedience Clerk’\r\n(1697), or ‘Unity Thornton’ (1703), may be set beside the instances\r\nrecorded on pp. 102–104. To these I would take this opportunity of\r\nadding ‘Comfort Starre,’ ‘Hopestill Foster,’ ‘Love Brewster,’ ‘Fear\r\nBrewster,’ ‘Patience Brewster,’ ‘Remembrance Tibbott,’ ‘Remember\r\nAllerton,’ ‘Desire Minter,’ ‘Original Lewis,’ and ‘Thankes Sheppard,’\r\nall being names of emigrants from England in the 17th century. (_Vide_\r\nHotten’s ‘Original Lists of Persons of Quality.’)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _February 1875._\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n                                   TO\r\n\r\n                           THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs prefaces are very little read, I will make this as brief as possible.\r\nIt is strange how little has been written upon the sources and\r\nsignifications of our English surnames. Of books of Peerage, of\r\nBaronetage, and of Landed Gentry, thanks to Sir Bernard Burke, Mr.\r\nWalford, and others, we are not without a sufficiency; but of books\r\npurporting to treat of the ordinary surnames that greet our eye as we\r\nscan our shop-fronts, or look down a list of contributions, or glance\r\nover the ‘hatches, matches, and despatches’ of our newspapers—of these\r\nthere are but few. Indeed, putting aside Mr. Lower’s able and laborious\r\nresearches, we may say none. Tracts, pamphlets, short treatises,\r\narticles in magazines, have at various times appeared, but they have\r\nbeen necessarily confined and limited in their treatment of the\r\nsubject.[1] And yet what can be more natural than that we should desire\r\nto know something relating to the origin of our surname, when it arose,\r\nwho first got it, and how? Of the feebleness of my own attempt to solve\r\nall this I am conscious that I need not to be reminded. Still, I think\r\nthe ordinary reader will find in a perusal of this book some slight\r\nincrease of information, and if not this, that he has whiled away, not\r\nunpleasantly, some of his less busy hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the last seven years I have devoted the whole of my spare time to\r\nthe preparation of a ‘Dictionary of English Surnames.’ But about two\r\nyears ago it struck me that perhaps a smaller work dealing with the\r\nsubject in a less formal and more familiar style might not be\r\nunacceptable to many, as a kind of rudimentary treatise. In the course\r\nof my labours I have come under obligations to several writers and\r\nseveral Societies. To long-departed men, whose works do follow after\r\nthem, I must give a passing allusion. Camden was the first to draw\r\nattention to this subject, and though he wrote little, and that little\r\nnot of the most correct kind, still he has afforded the groundwork for\r\nall future students. Verstegan, who came next with his ‘Restitution of\r\nDecayed Intelligence,’ wrote quaintly, amusingly and incorrectly; and,\r\nwith respect to surnames, his definitions rather teach what they do not\r\nthan what they do mean. Passing over several archæological papers, and\r\nwith a wide gap in regard to time, we come to Mr. Lower’s studies. He\r\nwas the first to give a real compendium of English nomenclature. Of his\r\nearlier efforts I will say nothing, for the ‘Patronymica Britannica’ is\r\nthat upon which his fame must rest. The fault of that work is that the\r\nauthor has confined his researches all but entirely to the Hundred\r\nRolls. These Rolls are undoubtedly the best for such reference; but\r\nthere are many others, as my index will show, which not merely contain a\r\nlarge mass of examples not to be met with there, but which, by varieties\r\nof spelling in the case of such names as they share in common with the\r\nother, afford comparisons the use of which would have made him certain\r\nwhere he has only guessed, and would have enabled him also to avoid many\r\nfalse conclusions. This I would say with all respect, as one who has\r\nbenefited very considerably by Mr. Lower’s labours. Others I must thank\r\nmore briefly, though none the less heartily. To Mr. Halliwell I am under\r\ndeep obligation, for to his ‘Dictionary of Archaisms’ I have gone freely\r\nby way of quotation. To Mr. Way’s notes to his valuable edition of the\r\n‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ I am also indebted for much interesting\r\ninformation regarding mediæval life and its surroundings. Miss Yonge’s\r\n‘History of Christian Names’ contains a large store of help to students\r\nof this kind of lore, and of this I have availed myself in several\r\ninstances. In conclusion, I have to acknowledge much valuable aid\r\nreceived from the publications of the Surtees Society, the Early English\r\nText Society, the Camden Society, and the Chetham Society. It is in the\r\nrooms belonging to the latter that I have had the opportunity of\r\nconsulting most of the records and archives, a list of which prefaces my\r\nindex, as well as other books of a more incidentally helpful character,\r\nand I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without tendering my hearty\r\nthanks to Thomas Jones, Esq., B.A., F.S.A., for his courtesy in\r\npermitting me access to all parts of the library, and to Mr. Richard\r\nHanby, the under-librarian, for his constant attention and readiness to\r\nsupply me with whatever books I required.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MANCHESTER:\r\n\r\n        _December 1873_.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n                                 TO THE\r\n\r\n                          INDEX OF INSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several matters which I deem it advisable to mention to the\r\nreader before he turns his attention to the Index of Instances (pp.\r\n514–612).\r\n\r\nI. I have not, in the various chapters that form the body of this book,\r\nin all cases drawn particular attention when any name happens to belong\r\nto several distinct classes. In the Index, however, I have tried to\r\nremedy this by furnishing instances under the several heads to which\r\nthey have been assigned in the text.\r\n\r\nII. While ordinarily adhering to my plan of giving but two examples, I\r\nhave set down three in some instances that seemed more interesting, and\r\nin exceptional cases even four. To the majority of the appended surnames\r\nmore illustrations of course could have been added had it been expedient\r\nor necessary. There are several names, however, which, though evidently\r\nof familiar occurrence in early days, as they are now, are yet, so far\r\nas my own researches go, without any record. For instance, I cannot find\r\nany Arkwright or Runchiman previous to the sixteenth century. The origin\r\nis perfectly clear, but the registry is wanting. Of several others,\r\nagain, I can light upon but one entry. Still, in a matter like this one\r\nmust be thankful for small mercies, and it was with no small amount of\r\nrejoicing that in such a simple record as that of ‘John Sykelsmith’ I\r\nfound the progenitor, or one of the progenitors, of our many\r\n‘Sucksmiths,’ ‘Sixsmiths,’ ‘Shuxsmiths,’ etc.\r\n\r\nIII. There has been a difficulty with regard to Christian names also,\r\nwhich I have not attempted to overcome because it was impossible to do\r\nso. With the Normans every baptismal name, masculine or feminine as it\r\nmight originally be, was the common property of the sexes. Thus by\r\nsimply appending the feminine desinence, ‘Druett’ became ‘Druetta’ (_v._\r\nDrewett), ‘Williamet’ became ‘Williametta’ (_v._ Williamot), ‘Aylbred’\r\nbecame ‘Aylbreda’ (_v._ Allbright), ‘Raulin’ became ‘Raulina’ (_v._\r\nRawlings), and ‘Goscelin’ became ‘Goscelina’ (_v._ Gosling). Any of\r\nthese surnames, Drewett, Willmott, Allbright, Rawlings, or Gosling,\r\ntherefore, may be of feminine origin—nay, if the reader has studied my\r\nchapter on ‘Patronymic Surnames’ with any care, he will see that this is\r\nfully as probable as the opposite view. Leaving thus undecided what\r\ncannot be solved, I have placed both masculine and feminine forms under\r\nthe one surname to which one or other has given rise.\r\n\r\nIV. There has been another difficulty also in respect of Christian\r\nnames. These, as has been shown in the chapter thereupon, were turned\r\ninto pet forms, and these shortened forms commonly came to be the\r\nfoundation of the surname. In all the more formal registers, however,\r\nthese surnames were never so set down. ‘Hugh Thomasson,’ ‘William\r\nThompson,’ and ‘Henry Tomson’ might come to have their names enrolled,\r\nand up to the beginning of the sixteenth century at least they would be\r\nset down alike as ‘Hugh fil. Thomas,’ ‘William fil. Thomas,’ and ‘Henry\r\nfil. Thomas.’ Thus, again, ‘Ralph Higginson’ or ‘John Higgins’ would be\r\n‘Radulphus’ or ‘Johannes fil. Isaac.’ This has prevented me from giving\r\nso many instances of these curter forms of the patronymic class as I\r\nshould have liked. When they are given, the reader will observe that\r\nthey come from less punctilious and more irregular sources, such as for\r\ninstance the Surtees’ Society’s collection of Mediæval Yorkshire Wills\r\nand Inventories. Where I have given such an instance as ‘Elekyn’ (_v._\r\nElkins) by itself, it must be understood that this is the Christian\r\nname, and that the owner when his or her name was registered did not\r\nboast a surname at all.\r\n\r\nV. By way of interesting the reader I have occasionally given the Latin\r\nform of entry. Thus ‘Adam the Goldsmith’ is set down as ‘Adam Aurifaber’\r\n(_v._ Aurifaber), ‘Henry the Butcher’ as ‘Henry Carnifex’ (_v._\r\nCarnifex), and ‘Hugh the Tailor’ as ‘Hugh Cissor’ (_v._ Cissor). Latin,\r\nindeed, seems to have been the vehicle of ordinary indenture. Thus under\r\n‘Littlejohn’ the reader will find extracted from the Hundred Rolls\r\n‘Ricardus fil. Parvi-Johannis,’ and under ‘Linota,’ ‘Linota Vidua,’\r\n_i.e._ ‘Linota the Widow.’ In the recording of local names,\r\nNorman-French and Saxon seem to have fought for the first place, and\r\neven in our most formal registers they had the precedence over Latin.\r\nThus if the latter can boast the entry of ‘Isolda Beauchamp’ as ‘Isolda\r\nde Bello Campo’ (_v._ Beauchamp), still, if we come to such generic\r\nnames as Briggs or Brook, we find the entry is all but invariably either\r\n‘Henry Atte-brigg’ or ‘Roger del Brigge’ (_v._ Briggs), or ‘Alice de la\r\nBroke or ‘Ada ate Brok’ (_v._ Brook). As respects nicknames or names of\r\noccupation, the Norman-French tongue had them to itself. ‘Roger le\r\nBuck,’ ‘Philip le Criour,’ ‘Thomas le Cuchold,’ ‘Osbert le Curteys,’ or\r\n‘Thomas le Cupper’—such is their continuous form of entry. Such a Saxon\r\nenrolment as ‘Robert the Brochere’ (_v._ Broker) is of the rarest\r\noccurrence—so rare, indeed, as to make one feel it was an undoubted\r\nfreak on the part of the registrar, whoever he might be.\r\n\r\nVI. In some few cases I have set down surnames which are not treated of\r\nin the text. I have done this either because the name seemed worthy of\r\nthis casual notice, or because, though not itself mentioned, it happened\r\nto corroborate some statement I have made regarding a particular name\r\nbelonging to the same class.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will not say there is no mistake in the Index—that\r\nwould be a bold thing to state; I will not say that I may not have given\r\nan instance that does not rightly belong to the surname under which it\r\nis set; but I can asseverate that I have honestly attempted to be\r\ncorrect, and I believe a careful examination will find but the most\r\noccasional error, if any at all, of this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     PAGE\r\n               PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION          vii\r\n               PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION          xiii\r\n               PREFACE TO THE INDEX OF INSTANCES     xvii\r\n               INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER                     1\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n               PATRONYMIC SURNAMES                      9\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n               LOCAL SURNAMES                         107\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n               SURNAMES OF OFFICE                     172\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n               SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION (COUNTRY)       243\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n               SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION (TOWN)          317\r\n               APPENDIX TO CHAPTERS IV.

When we remember that there is nothing without a name,\r\nand that every name that is named, whether it be of a man, or man’s\r\nwork, or man’s heritage of earth, came not by chance, or accident so\r\ncalled, but was given out of some nation’s spoken language to denote\r\nsome characteristic that language expressed, we can readily imagine how\r\nimportant is the drift of each—what a record must each contain. We\r\ncannot but see that could we only grasp their true meaning, could we but\r\ntake away the doubtful crust in which they are oftentimes imbedded, then\r\nshould we be speaking out of the very mouth of history itself. For names\r\nare enduring—generations come and go; and passing on with each, they\r\nbecome all but everlasting. Nomenclature, in fact, is a well in which,\r\nas the fresh water is flowing perennially through, there is left a\r\nsediment that clings to the bottom. This silty deposit may\r\naccumulate—nay, it may threaten to choke it up, still the well is there.\r\nIt but requires to be exhumed, and we shall behold it in all its simple\r\nproportions once more. And thus it is with names. They betoken life and\r\nmatter that is ever coming and going, ever undergoing change and decay.\r\nBut through it all they abide. The accretions of passing years may\r\nfasten upon them—the varied accidents of lapsing time may attach to\r\nthem—they may become all but undistinguishable, but only let us get rid\r\nof that which cleaves to them, and we lay bare in all its naked\r\nsimplicity the character and the lineaments of a long gone era. Look for\r\ninstance at our place-names. Apart from their various corruptions they\r\nare as they were first entitled. So far as the nomenclature of our\r\ncountry itself is concerned, England is at this present day as rude, as\r\nuntutored, and as heathen as at the moment those Norwegian and Germanic\r\nhordes grounded their keels upon our shores, for all our place-names,\r\nsaving where the Celt still lingers, are their bequest, and bear upon\r\nthem the impress of their life and its surroundings. These are they\r\nwhich tell us such strange truths—how far they had made progress as yet\r\nin the arts of life, what were the habits they practised, what was the\r\nreligion they believed in. And as with place-names, so with our own. As\r\nrecords of past history they are equally truthful, equally suggestive.\r\nOne important difference, however, there is—Place-names, as I have just\r\nhinted, once given are all but imperishable. Mountains, valleys, and\r\nstreams still, as a rule, retain the names first given them. Personal\r\nnames, those simple individual names which we find in use throughout all\r\npre-Norman history, were but for the life of him to whom they were\r\nattached. They died with him, nor passed on saving accidentally. Nor\r\nwere those second designations, those which we call surnames as being\r\n‘superadded to Christian names,’ at first of any lasting character. It\r\nwas not till the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, or even fourteenth\r\ncenturies that they became hereditary—that is, in any true sense\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we enter into the history of these, and with regard to\r\nEngland that is the purpose of this book, it will be well to take a\r\nbrief survey of the actual state of human nomenclature in preceding\r\ntimes. Surnames, we must remember, were the simple result of necessity\r\nwhen population, hitherto isolated and small, became so increased as to\r\nnecessitate further particularity than the merely personal one could\r\nsupply. One name, therefore, was all that was needed in early times, and\r\none name, as a general rule, is all that we find. The Bible is, of\r\ncourse, our first record of these—‘Adam,’ ‘Eve,’ ‘Joseph,’ ‘Barak,’\r\n‘David,’ ‘Isaiah,’ all were simple, single, and expressive titles, given\r\nin most cases from some circumstances attending their creation or birth.\r\nWhen the Israelites were crowded together in the wilderness they were at\r\nonce involved in difficulties of identification. We cannot imagine to\r\nourselves how such a population as that of Manchester or Birmingham\r\ncould possibly get on with but single appellations. Of course I do not\r\nput this by way of real comparison, for with the Jewish clan or family\r\nsystem this difficulty must have been materially overcome. Still it is\r\nno wonder that in the later books of Moses we should find them falling\r\nback upon this patronymic as a means of identifying the individual. Thus\r\nsuch expressions as ‘Joshua the son of Nun,’ or ‘Caleb the son of\r\nJephunah,’ or ‘Jair the son of Manasseh,’ are not unfrequently to be met\r\nwith. Later on, this necessity was caused by a further circumstance.\r\nCertain of these single names became popular over others. ‘John,’\r\n‘Simon,’ and ‘Judas’ were such. A further distinction, therefore, was\r\nnecessary. This gave rise to sobriquets of a more diverse character. We\r\nfind the _patronymic_ still in use, as in ‘Simon Barjonas,’ that is,\r\n‘Simon the son of Jonas;’ but in addition to this, we have also the\r\n_local_ element introduced, as in ‘Simon of Cyrene,’ and the\r\n_descriptive_ in ‘Simon the Zealot.’ Thus, again, we have ‘Judas\r\nIscariot,’ whatever that may mean, for commentators are divided upon the\r\nsubject; ‘Judas Barsabas,’ and ‘Judas of Galilee.’ In the meantime the\r\nheathen but polished nations of Greece and Rome had been adopting\r\nsimilar means, though the latter was decidedly the first in method.\r\nAmong the former, such double names as ‘Dionysius the Tyrant,’ ‘Diogenes\r\nthe Cynic,’ ‘Socrates the son of Sophronicus,’ or ‘Hecatæus of Miletus,’\r\nshow the same custom, and the same need. To the Roman, however, belongs,\r\nas I have said, the earliest system of nomenclature, a system, perhaps,\r\nmore careful and precise than any which has followed after. The purely\r\nRoman citizen had a threefold name. The first denoted the ‘_prænomen_,’\r\nand answered to our personal, or baptismal, name. The second was what we\r\nmay term the _clan-name_; and the third, the cognomen, corresponded with\r\nour present _surname_. Thus we have such treble appellations as ‘Marcus\r\nTullius Cicero,’ or ‘Aulus Licinius Archeas.’ If a manumitted slave had\r\nthe citizenship conferred upon him, his single name became his cognomen,\r\nand the others preceded it, one generally being the name of him who was\r\nthe emancipator. Thus was it of ‘Licinius’ in the last-mentioned\r\ninstance. With the overthrow of the Western Empire, however, this system\r\nwas lost, and the barbarians who settled upon its ruins brought back the\r\nsimple appellative once more. Arminius, their chief hero, was content\r\nwith that simple title. Alaric, the brave King of the Goths, is only so\r\nknown. Caractacus and Vortigern, to come nearer home, represented but\r\nthe same custom.\r\n\r\nBut we are not without traces of those descriptive epithets which had\r\nobtained among the earlier communities of the East. The Venerable Bede,\r\nspeaking of two missionaries, both of whom bore the name of ‘Hewald,’\r\nsays, ‘pro diversâ capellorum specie unus Niger Hewald, alter Albus\r\ndiceretur;’ that is, in modern parlance, the colour of their hair being\r\ndifferent, they came to be called ‘Hewald Black,’ and ‘Hewald White.’\r\nAnother Saxon, distinguished for his somewhat huge proportions, and\r\nbearing the name of ‘Ethelred,’ was known as ‘Mucel,’ or ‘Great,’ a word\r\nstill lingering in the Scottish _mickle_. We may class him, therefore,\r\nwith our ‘le Grands,’ as we find them inscribed in the Norman rolls, the\r\nprogenitors of our ‘Grants,’ and ‘Grands,’ or our ‘Biggs,’ as Saxon as\r\nhimself. Thus again, our later ‘Fairfaxes,’ ‘Lightfoots,’ ‘Heavisides,’\r\nand ‘Slows,’ are but _hereditary_ nicknames like to the earlier\r\n‘Harfagres,’ ‘Harefoots,’ ‘Ironsides,’ and ‘Unreadys,’ which died out,\r\nso far as their immediate possessors went, with the ‘Harolds,’ and\r\n‘Edmunds,’ and ‘Ethelreds,’ upon whom they were severally foisted. They\r\nwere but expressions of popular feeling to individual persons by means\r\nof which that individuality was increased, and, as with every other\r\ninstance I have mentioned hitherto, passed away with the lives of their\r\nowners. No descendant succeeded to the title. The son, in due course of\r\ntime, got a sobriquet of his own, by which he was familiarly known, but\r\nthat, too, was but personal and temporary. It was no more hereditary\r\nthan had been his father’s before him, and even so far as himself was\r\nconcerned might be again changed according to the humour or caprice of\r\nhis neighbours and acquaintances. And this went on for several more\r\ncenturies, only as population increased these sobriquets became but more\r\nand more common.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, a change took place. By\r\na silent and unpremeditated movement over the whole of the more\r\npopulated and civilized European societies, nomenclature began to assume\r\na solid lasting basis. It was the result, in fact, of an insensibly\r\ngrowing necessity. Population was on the increase, commerce was\r\nspreading, and society was fast becoming corporate. With all this arose\r\ndifficulties of individualization. It was impossible, without some\r\nfurther distinction, to maintain a current identity. Hence what had been\r\nbut an occasional and irregular custom became a fixed and general\r\npractice—the distinguishing sobriquet, not, as I say, of premeditation,\r\nbut by a silent compact, became part and parcel of a man’s property, and\r\npassed on with his other possessions to his direct descendants. This\r\nsobriquet had come to be of various kinds. It might be the designation\r\nof the property owned, as in the case of the Norman barons and their\r\nfeudatory settlements, or it might be some local peculiarity that marked\r\nthe abode. It might be the designation of the craft the owner followed.\r\nIt might be the title of the rank or office he held. It might be a\r\npatronymic—a name acquired from the personal or Christian name of his\r\nfather or mother. It might be some characteristic, mental or physical,\r\ncomplimentary or the reverse. Any of these it might be, it mattered not\r\nwhich; but when once it became attached to the possessor and gave him a\r\nfixed identity, it clung to him for his life, and eventually passed on\r\nto his offspring. Then it was that at length local and personal names\r\ncame somewhat upon the same level; and as the former, some centuries\r\nbefore, had stereotyped the life of our various Celtic and Slavonic and\r\nTeutonic settlements, so now these latter fossilized the character of\r\nthe era in which they arose; and here we have them, with all the\r\nantiquity of their birth upon them, breathing of times and customs and\r\nfashions and things that are now wholly passed from our eyes, or are so\r\ncompletely changed as to bear but the faintest resemblance to that which\r\nthey have been. To analyse some of these names, for all were impossible,\r\nis the purpose of the following chapters. I trust that ere I have\r\nfinished my task, I shall have been able to throw some little light, at\r\nleast, on the life and habits of our early English forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have observed that I have just incidentally alluded to\r\nfive different classes of names. For the sake of further distinction I\r\nwill place them formally and under more concise headings:—\r\n\r\n    1. Baptismal or personal names.\r\n    2. Local surnames.\r\n    3. Official surnames.\r\n    4. Occupative surnames.\r\n    5. Sobriquet surnames, or Nicknames.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely add that under one of these five divisions will every\r\nsurname in all the countries of Europe be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                          PATRONYMIC SURNAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how important an influence have merely personal\r\nnames exercised upon our nomenclature. The most familiar surnames we can\r\nmeet with, saving that of ‘Smith,’ are to be found in this list. For\r\nfrequency we have no names to be compared with ‘Jones,’ or ‘Williamson,’\r\nor ‘Thompson,’ or ‘Richardson.’ How they came into being is easily\r\nmanifest. Nothing could be more natural than that children should often\r\npass current in the community in which they lived as the sons of\r\n‘Thomas,’ or ‘William,’ or ‘Richard,’ or ‘John;’ and that these several\r\nrelationships should be found in our directories as distinct sobriquets\r\nonly shows that there was a particular generation in these families in\r\nwhich this title became permanent, and passed on to future descendants\r\nas an hereditary surname.[2] The interest that attaches to these\r\npatronymics is great—for it is by them we can best discover what names\r\nwere in vogue at this period, and what not, and of those which were, by\r\ntheir relative frequency, in a measure, what were the most popular.\r\nCertainly the change is most extraordinary when we compare the past with\r\nthe present. Some, once so popular that they scarce gave identity to the\r\nbearer, are now all but obsolete, while numerous appellations at present\r\ngenerally current were then utterly unknown. There are surnames familiar\r\nto our ears whose root as a Christian name is now passed out of\r\nknowledge; while, on the other hand, many a Christian name now daily\r\nupon our lips has no surname formed from it to tell of any lengthened\r\nexistence. The fact is, that while our surnames, putting immigration\r\naside, have been long at a standstill, we have ever been and are still\r\nadding to our stock of baptismal names.[3] Each new national crisis,\r\neach fresh achievement of our arms, each new princely bride imported\r\nfrom abroad—these events are being commemorated daily at the font. This\r\nis but the continuance of a custom, and one very natural, which has ever\r\nexisted. Turn where we will in English history during the last eight\r\nhundred years, and we shall find the popular sympathies seeking an\r\noutlet in baptism. Did a prince of the blood royal meet with a hapless\r\nand cruel fate? His memory was at once embalmed in the names of the\r\nchildren born immediately afterwards, saving when a mother’s\r\nsuperstitious fears came in to prevent it. Did some national hero arise\r\nwho upheld and asserted the people’s rights against a grinding and\r\nhateful tyranny? His name is speedily to be found inscribed on every\r\nhearth. The reverse is of equal significance. It is by the fact of a\r\nname, which must have been of familiar import, finding few to represent\r\nit, we can trace a people’s dislikes and a nation’s prejudices. A name\r\nonce in favour, as a rule, however, kept its place. The cause to which\r\nit owed its rise had long passed into the shade of forgotten things, but\r\nthe name, if it had but attained a certain hold, seems easily to have\r\nkept it, till indeed such a convulsion occurred as revolutionised men\r\nand things and their names together.\r\n\r\nThere have been two such revolutionary crises in English nomenclature,\r\nthe Conquest and the Reformation, the second culminating in the Puritan\r\nCommonwealth. Other crises have stamped themselves in indelible lines\r\nupon our registers, but the indenture, if as strongly impressed, was far\r\nless general, and in the main merely enlarged rather than changed our\r\nstock of national names. Thus was it with the Crusades. A few of the\r\nnames it introduced have been popular ever since. Many, at first\r\nreceived favourably, died out, if not with, at least soon after, the\r\nsubsidence of the spirit to which they owed their rise. Some of these\r\ncame from the Eastern Church, of whose existence at all the Crusader\r\nseems to have suddenly reminded us. Some were Biblical, associated in\r\nBible narrative with the very soil the Templars trod. Some, again, were\r\nborrowed from Continental comrades in arms, names which had caught the\r\nfancy of those who introduced them, or were connected with friendly\r\nrivalries and pledged friendships. This era, being concurrent with the\r\nestablishment of surnames, has left its mark upon our nomenclature; but\r\nit was no revolution.\r\n\r\nThe period in which these names began to assume an hereditary character\r\nvaries so greatly that it is impossible to make any definite statement.\r\nAs a familiar custom I should say it arose in the twelfth century. But\r\nthere are places, both in Lancashire and Yorkshire, where, as in Wales,\r\nmen are wont to be styled to this very day by a complete string of\r\npatronymics. To hear a man called ‘Bill’s o’Jack’s,’ ‘o’Dick’s,’\r\n‘o’Harry’s,’ ‘o’Tom’s,’ is by no means a rare incident. A hit at this\r\nformerly common Welsh practice is given in ‘Sir John Oldcastle,’ a play\r\nprinted in 1600, in which ran the following conversation:—\r\n\r\n‘Judge: What bail? What sureties?\r\n\r\n‘Davy: Her cozen ap Rice, ap Evan, ap Morice, ap Morgan, ap Llewellyn,\r\nap Madoc, ap Meredith, ap Griffin, ap Davis, ap Owen, ap Shinkin Jones.\r\n\r\n‘Judge: Two of the most efficient are enow.\r\n\r\n‘Sheriff: And ’t please your lordship, these are all but one.’\r\n\r\nThis ‘ap,’ the Welsh equivalent of our English ‘son,’ when it has come\r\nbefore a name beginning with a vowel, has in many instances become\r\nincorporated with it. Thus ‘Ap-Hugh’ has given us ‘Pugh,’ ‘Ap-Rice,’\r\njust mentioned, ‘Price,’ or as ‘Reece,’ ‘Preece;’ ‘Ap-Owen,’ ‘Bowen;’\r\n‘Ap-Evan,’ ‘Bevan;’ ‘Ap-Robert,’ ‘Probert;’ ‘Ap-Roger,’ ‘Prodger;’\r\n‘Ap-Richard,’ ‘Pritchard;’ ‘Ap-Humphrey,’ ‘Pumphrey;’ ‘Ap-Ithell,’\r\n‘Bethell;’[4] or ‘Ap-Howell,’ ‘Powell.’[5] ‘Prosser’ has generally been\r\nthought a corruption of ‘proser,’ one who was garrulously inclined; but\r\nthis is a mistake, it is simply ‘Ap-Rosser.’ The Norman patronymic was\r\nformed similarly as the Welsh, by a prefix, that of ‘fitz,’ the modern\r\nFrench ‘fils.’ Surnames of this class were at first common. Thus we find\r\nsuch names as ‘Fitz-Gibbon,’ ‘Fitz-Gerald,’ ‘Fitz-Patrick,’\r\n‘Fitz-Waryn,’ ‘Fitz-Rauf,’ ‘Fitz-Payn,’ ‘Fitz-Richard,’ or ‘Fitz-Neele.’\r\nBut though this obtained for awhile among some of the nobler families of\r\nour country, it has made in general no sensible impression upon our\r\nsurnames. The Saxon added ‘son,’ as a desinence, as ‘Williamson,’ that\r\nis, ‘William’s son,’ or ‘Bolderson,’ that is, ‘Baldwin’s son,’ or merely\r\nthe genitive suffix, as ‘Williams,’ or ‘Richards.’ This class has been\r\nwonderfully enlarged by the custom then in vogue, as now, of reducing\r\nevery baptismal name to some curt and familiar monosyllable. It agreed\r\nwith the rough-and-ready humour of the Anglo-Norman character so to do.\r\nHow common this was we may see from Gower’s description of the\r\ninsurrection of Wat Tyler:\r\n\r\n     ‘Watte’ vocat, cui ‘Thoma’ venit, neque ‘Symme’ retardat,\r\n       ‘Bat’-que ‘Gibbe’ simul, ‘Hykke’ venire jubent:\r\n     ‘Colle’ furit, quem ‘Bobbe’ juvat nocumenta parantes,\r\n       Cum quibus, ad damnum ‘Wille’ coire volat—\r\n     ‘Grigge’ rapit, dum ‘Davie’ strepit, comes est quibus ‘Hobbe,’\r\n       ‘Larkin’ et in medio non minor esse putat:\r\n     ‘Hudde’ ferit, quem ‘Judde’ terit, dum ‘Tibbe’ juvatur\r\n       ‘Jacke’ domosque viros vellit, en ense necat—\r\n\r\nOr let the author of ‘Piers Plowman’ speak. ‘Glutton’ having been\r\nseduced to the alehouse door, we are told—\r\n\r\n         Then goeth ‘Glutton’ in and grete other after,\r\n         ‘Cesse’ the souteresse sat on the bench:\r\n         ‘Watte’ the warner and his wife bothe:\r\n         ‘Tymme’ the tynkere and twayne of his ’prentices.\r\n         ‘Hikke’ the hackney man and ‘Hugh’ the nedlere,\r\n         ‘Clarice’ of Cokkeslane, and the clerke of the churche;\r\n         ‘Dawe’ the dykere, and a dozen othere.\r\n\r\nIn these two quotations we see at once the clue to the extraordinary\r\nnumber of patronymics our directories contain of these short and\r\ncurtailed forms. Thus ‘Dawe,’ from ‘David,’ gives us ‘Dawson,’ or\r\n‘Dawes;’ ‘Hikke’ from ‘Isaac,’ ‘Hickson,’ or ‘Hicks;’ ‘Watte,’ from\r\n‘Walter,’ ‘Watson,’ or ‘Watts.’ Nor was this all. A large addition was\r\nmade to this category by the introduction of a further element. This\r\narose from the nursery practice of giving pet names. Much as this is\r\ndone now, it would seem to have been still more common then. In either\r\nperiod the method has been the same—that of turning the name into a\r\ndiminutive. Our very word ‘pet’ itself is but the diminutive ‘petite,’\r\nor ‘little one.’ The fashion adopted, however, was different. We are\r\nfond of using ‘ie,’ or ‘ley.’ Thus with us ‘John’ becomes ‘Johnnie,’\r\n‘Edward,’ ‘Teddie,’ ‘Charles,’ ‘Charley.’ In early days the four\r\ndiminutives in use were those of ‘kin,’ ‘cock,’ and the terminations\r\n‘ot’ or ‘et,’ and ‘on’ or ‘en,’ the two latter being of Norman-French\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n1. _Kin._—This Saxon term, corresponding with the German ‘chen,’ and the\r\nFrench ‘on’ or ‘en,’ referred to above, and introduced, most probably,\r\nso far as the immediate practice was concerned, by the Flemings, we\r\nstill preserve in such words as ‘manikin,’ ‘pipkin,’ ‘lambkin,’ or\r\n‘doitkin.’ This is very familiar as a nominal adjunct. Thus, in an old\r\npoem, entitled ‘A Litul soth Sermun,’ we find the following:—\r\n\r\n                      Nor those prude yongemen\r\n                        That loveth ‘Malekyn,’\r\n                      And those prude maydenes\r\n                        That loveth ‘Janekyn;’\r\n                      At chirche and at chepynge\r\n                        When they togadere come\r\n                      They runneth togaderes\r\n                        And speaketh of derne love.\r\n                           ————\r\n                      Masses and matins\r\n                        Ne kepeth they nouht,\r\n                      For ‘Wilekyn’ and ‘Watekyn’\r\n                        Be in their thouht—\r\n\r\nHence we have derived such surnames as ‘Simpkins’ and ‘Simpkinson,’\r\n‘Thompkins’ and ‘Tomkinson.’\r\n\r\n2. _Cock._—Our nursery literature still secures in its ‘cock-robins,’\r\n‘cock-boats,’ and ‘cock-horses,’ the immortality of this second\r\ntermination. It forms an important element in such names as ‘Simcox,’\r\n‘Jeffcock,’ ‘Wilcock,’ or ‘Wilcox,’ and ‘Laycock’ (Lawrence).\r\n\r\n3. _Ot_ or _et_.—These terminations were introduced by the Normans, and\r\ncertainly have made an impregnable position for themselves in our\r\nEnglish nomenclature. In our dictionaries they are found in such\r\ndiminutives as ‘pocket’ (little poke), ‘ballot,’ ‘chariot,’ ‘target,’\r\n‘latchet,’ ‘lancet;’ in our directories in such names as ‘Emmett,’ or\r\n‘Emmot’ (Emma), ‘Tillotson’ (Matilda), ‘Elliot’ (Elias), ‘Marriot’\r\n(Mary), ‘Willmot’ (Willamot), and ‘Hewet,’ or ‘Hewetson’ (Hugh).[6]\r\n\r\n4. _On_ or _en_.—These terminations became very popular with the French,\r\nand their directories teem with the evidences they display of former\r\nfavour. They are all but unknown to our English dictionary, but many\r\ntraces of their presence may be found in our nomenclature. Thus ‘Robert’\r\nbecame ‘Robin,’ ‘Nicol’ ‘Colin,’ ‘Pierre’ ‘Perrin,’ ‘Richard’ ‘Diccon,’\r\n‘Mary’ ‘Marion,’ ‘Alice’ ‘Alison,’ ‘Beatrice’ ‘Beton,’ ‘Hugh’ ‘Huon,’ or\r\n‘Huguon’; and hence such surnames as ‘Colinson,’ ‘Perrin,’ ‘Dicconson,’\r\n‘Allison’ (in some cases), ‘Betonson,’ ‘Huggins,’ and ‘Hugginson.’[7]\r\n\r\nI have already said that the Norman invasion revolutionised our system\r\nof personal names. Certainly it is in this the antagonism between\r\nNorman and Saxon is especially manifest. Occasionally, in looking over\r\nthe records of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, we may light upon\r\na ‘Godwin,’ or ‘Guthlac,’ or ‘Goddard,’ but they are of the most\r\nexceptional occurrence. Were the local part of these entries foreign,\r\nexplanation would be unneeded. But while the personal element is\r\nforeign, the local denotes settlement from the up-country. Look at the\r\nLondon population of this period from such records as we possess.\r\nThere is scarcely a hamlet, however small, that does not contribute to\r\nswell the sum of the metropolitan mass, and while ‘London’ itself is\r\nof comparatively great rarity in our nomenclature, an insignificant\r\nvillage like, say Debenham, in Suffolk, will have its score of\r\nrepresentatives—so great was the flow, so small the ebb. It is this\r\nlarge accession from the interior which is the stronghold of Saxon\r\nnomenclature. It is this removal from one village to another, and from\r\none town to another, which has originated that distich quoted by old\r\nVestigan—\r\n\r\n                In ‘ford,’ in ‘ham,’ in ‘ley,’ in ‘ton,’\r\n                The most of English surnames run.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, strange as it may seem, it is very doubtful whether for a\r\nlengthened period, at least, the owners of these names were of Saxon\r\norigin. The position of the Saxon peasantry forbade that they should be\r\nin any but a small degree accessory to this increase. The very villenage\r\nthey lived under, the very manner in which they were attached to the\r\nglebe, rendered any such roving tendencies as these impossible. These\r\ncountry adventurers, then, whose names I have instanced, were of no\r\nSaxon stock, but the sons of the humbler dependants of those Normans who\r\nhad obtained landed settlements, or of Norman traders who had travelled\r\nup the country, fixing their habitation wheresoever the wants of an\r\nincreasing people seemed to give them an opportunity of gaining a\r\nlivelihood. The children of such, driven out of these smaller\r\ncommunities by the fact that there was no further opening for them, poor\r\nas the villeins amongst whom they dwelt, but different in that they were\r\nfree, would naturally resort to the metropolis and other large centres\r\nof industry. Not a few, however, would belong to the free Saxons, who,\r\nmuch against their will, no doubt, but for the sake of gain, would pass\r\nin the community to which they had joined themselves by the name\r\nbelonging to the more powerful and mercantile party. In the same way,\r\ntoo, some not small proportion of these names would belong to those\r\nSaxon serfs who, having escaped their bondage, would, on reaching the\r\ntowns, change their names to elude detection. These, of course, would be\r\ngot from the Norman category. But be all this as it may, the fact\r\nremains that throughout all the records and rolls of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries, we find, with but the rarest exceptions, all our\r\npersonal names to be Norman. The Saxon seems to have become well-nigh\r\nextinct. There might have been a war of extermination against them. In\r\nan unbroken succession we meet with such names as ‘John’ and ‘Richard,’\r\n‘Robert’ and ‘Henry,’ ‘Thomas’ and ‘Ralph,’ ‘Geoffrey’ and ‘Jordan,’\r\n‘Stephen’ and ‘Martin,’ ‘Joscelyn’ and ‘Almaric,’ ‘Benedict’ and\r\n‘Laurence,’ ‘Reginald’ and ‘Gilbert,’ ‘Roger’ and ‘Walter,’ ‘Eustace’\r\nand ‘Baldwin,’ ‘Francis’ and ‘Maurice,’ ‘Theobald’ and ‘Cecil,’—no\r\n‘Edward,’ no ‘Edmund,’ no ‘Harold’ even, saving in very isolated cases.\r\nIt is the same with female names. While ‘Isabel’ and ‘Matilda,’\r\n‘Mirabilla’ and ‘Avelina,’ ‘Amabilla’ and ‘Idonia,’ ‘Sibilla’ and ‘Ida,’\r\n‘Letitia’ and ‘Agnes,’ ‘Petronilla’ or ‘Parnel’ and ‘Lucy,’ ‘Alicia’ and\r\n‘Avice,’ ‘Alianora,’ or ‘Anora’ and ‘Dowsabell,’ ‘Clarice’ and ‘Muriel,’\r\n‘Agatha’ and ‘Rosamund,’ ‘Felicia’ and ‘Adelina,’ ‘Julia’ and ‘Blanche,’\r\n‘Isolda’ and ‘Amelia’ or ‘Emilia,’ ‘Beatrix’ and ‘Euphemia,’ ‘Annabel’\r\nand ‘Theophania,’ ‘Constance’ and ‘Joanna’ abound; ‘Etheldreda,’ or\r\n‘Edith,’ or ‘Ermentrude,’ all of the rarest occurrence, are the only\r\nnames which may breathe to us of purely Saxon times. In the case of\r\nseveral, however, a special effort was made later on, when the policy of\r\nallaying the jealous feelings of the popular class was resorted to. For\r\na considerable time the royal and chief baronial families had in their\r\npride sought names for their children from the Norman category merely.\r\nAfter the lapse of a century, however, finding the Saxon spirit still\r\nchafed and uneasy under a foreign thrall, several names of a popular\r\ncharacter were introduced into the royal nursery. Thus was it with\r\n‘Edward’ and ‘Edmund.’ The former of these appellations was represented\r\nby Edward I., the latter by his brother Edmund, Earl of Lancaster.\r\nPreviously to this, too, an attempt had been made to restore the British\r\n‘Arthur’ in that nephew of Cœur de Lion who so miserably perished by his\r\nuncle’s means, and thereby gave Lackland a securer hold upon the English\r\nthrone, if not upon the affections of the country. The sad and gloomy\r\nmystery which surrounded the disappearance of this boy-prince seems to\r\nhave inspired mothers with a superstitious awe of the name, for we do\r\nnot find, as in the case of ‘Edward’ or ‘Edmund,’ its royal restoration\r\nhaving the effect of making it general.[8] On the contrary, as an effort\r\nin its favour, it seems to have signally failed. Of all our early\r\nhistoric names I find fewest relics of this.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of subdividing our first chapter is great, but for the\r\nsake of convenience we have decided to preserve the following order:—\r\n\r\n  1. Names that preceded and survived the Conquest.\r\n  2. Names introduced or confirmed by the Normans.\r\n  3. Names from the Calendar of the Saints.\r\n  4. Names from Festivals and Holy-days.\r\n  5. Patronymics formed from occupations and officerships.\r\n  6. Metronymics.\r\n  7. Names from Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\n\r\n          I.—_Names that preceded and survived the Conquest._\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature of the great majority of such names as were in\r\nvogue previous to the Norman Conquest, and which to a certain extent\r\nmaintained a hold, is that (saving in two or three instances) they did\r\nnot attach to themselves either filial or pet desinences. If they have\r\ncome down to us as surnames, they are found in their simple unaltered\r\ndress. Thus, taking Afred as an example, we see in our directories\r\n‘Alfred’ or ‘Alured’ or ‘Allured’ to be the only patronymics that have\r\nbeen handed down to us. Latinized as Aluredus it figures in Domesday.\r\nThe Hundred Rolls, later on, register an Alured Ape, and the surname\r\nappears in the Parliamentary Writs in the case of William Alured. It is\r\nhard to separate our ‘Aldreds’ from our ‘Allureds.’ The usually entered\r\nforms are ‘Richard Alred,’ ‘Hugh Aldred,’ or ‘Aldred fil. Roger.’\r\nBesides ‘Aldred’ there is ‘Alderson,’ which may be but ‘Aldredson.’\r\nAylwin is met by such entries as Richard Alwine, or Thomas Ailwyne:\r\n‘Adelard,’ as ‘Adlard’ or ‘Alard,’ and ‘Agilward’ as ‘Aylward,’ are of\r\nmore frequent occurrence; while Aldrech, once merely a personal name, is\r\nnow, like many of the above, found only surnominally.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic mythology is closely interwoven in several of these names.\r\nThe primary root ‘god’ or ‘good,’ which stood in all Teuton languages as\r\nthe title of divinity, was familiarised as the chief component in not a\r\nfew of our still existing surnames. ‘Godwin,’ the name which the stout\r\nold earl of Danish blood has given to our Goodwin Sands, seems to have\r\nbeen well established when the great Survey was made. The French ‘Godin’\r\nseems scarcely to have crossed the Channel, but ‘Godwin’ and ‘Goodwin’\r\nhave well filled up the gap. ‘Hugh fil. Godewin,’ or ‘Godwin de Dovre,’\r\nrepresent our registers. Our ‘Godbolds’ are found in the dress of\r\n‘Godbolde,’ our ‘Goodiers’ and ‘Goodyears’ as ‘Goder’ or ‘Godyer,’ and\r\nour ‘Goddards’ as ‘Godard.’ The Hundred Rolls give us a ‘John fil.\r\nGodard.’ The Alpine mountain reminds us of its connection with\r\n‘Gotthard,’ and Miss Yonge states that it is still in use as a Christian\r\nname in Germany. ‘Gottschalk,’ a common surname in the same country, was\r\nwell known as a personal name in England in the forms of\r\n‘Godescalde,’[9] ‘Godescall,’ or ‘Godeschalke,’ such entries as ‘Godefry\r\nfil. Godescallus,’ or ‘Godeskalcus Armorer,’ or ‘John Godescalde,’ being\r\nnot unfrequent. The latter name suggests to us our ‘Godsalls’ and\r\n‘Godshalls’ as the present English surnominal forms. ‘Gottschalk’ in our\r\ndirectories may always be looked upon as a more recent importation from\r\nGermany. Goderic was perhaps the commonest of this class—its usual dress\r\nin our registers being ‘Gooderick,’ ‘Goderiche,’ ‘Godrick,’ and\r\n‘Godric.’ An early Saxon abbot was exalted into the ranks of the saints\r\nas ‘St. Goderic,’ and this would have its influence in the selection of\r\nbaptismal names at that period. ‘Guthlac,’ not without descendants, too,\r\nthough less easily recognisable in our ‘Goodlakes’ and ‘Goodlucks,’ and\r\n‘Geoffrey,’ or ‘Godfrey,’ whom I shall have occasion to mention again,\r\nbelong to the same category.[10] The last of this class I may mention is\r\nthe old ‘Godeberd,’ or ‘Godbert.’ As simple ‘Godeberd’ it is found in\r\nsuch a name as ‘Roger Godeberd,’ met with in the London Tower records.\r\nSomewhat more corrupted we come across a ‘John Gotebedde’ in the Hundred\r\nRolls of the thirteenth century; and much about the same time a ‘Robert\r\nGotobedd’ lived in Winchelsea. In this latter form, I need scarcely say,\r\nit has now a somewhat flourishing existence in our midst. Some will be\r\nreminded of the lines:—\r\n\r\n               Mr. Barker’s as mute as a fish in the sea,\r\n                 Mr. Miles never moves on a journey,\r\n               Mr. Gotobed sits up till half-after three,\r\n                 Mr. Makepeace was bred an attorney.\r\n\r\nStill, despite its long antiquity, when I recall the pretty Godbert from\r\nwhich it arose, I would, were I one of them, _go to bed_ as such some\r\nnight for the last time, nor get up again till I could dress, if not my\r\nperson, at least my personality in its real and more antique habiliment.\r\n\r\n‘Os,’ as a root-word implicative of deity, has made for itself a firm\r\nplace in our ‘Osbalds,’ ‘Osberts,’ ‘Oswins,’ ‘Oswalds,’ ‘Osbornes,’ and\r\n‘Osmunds’ or ‘Osmonds.’ Instances of all these may be seen in our older\r\nregistries. We quickly light upon entries such as ‘Osbert le Ferrur,’\r\n‘Osborne le Hawkere,’ ‘Oswin Ogle,’ ‘Nicholas Osemund,’ or ‘John\r\nOswald.’ Nor must ‘Thor,’ the ‘Jupiter tonans’ of the Norsemen, be left\r\nout, for putting aside local names, and the day of the week that still\r\nmemorialises him, we have yet several surnames that speak of his\r\ninfluence. ‘Thurstan’ and ‘Thurlow’ seem both of kin. ‘Thorald,’\r\nhowever, has made the greatest mark, and next ‘Thurkell.’ Thorald may be\r\nseen in ‘Torald Chamberlain’ (A), Ralph fil. Thorald (A), or Torald\r\nBenig (A); while Thurkell or Thurkill is found first in the fuller form\r\nin such entries as ‘Richard Thyrketyll,’ or ‘Robert Thirkettle,’ and\r\nthen in the contracted in ‘Thurkeld le Seneschal,’ or ‘Robert Thurkel.’\r\n\r\nWe have just referred to Thurkettle. ‘Kettle’ was very closely connected\r\nwith the mythology of Northern Europe, and is still a great name in\r\nNorway and in Iceland. The sacrificial cauldron of the gods must\r\ncertainly have been vividly present to the imagination of our\r\nforefathers. The list of names compounded with ‘Kettle’ is large even in\r\nEngland. The simple ‘Kettle’ was very common. In Domesday it is\r\n‘Chetill,’ in the Hundred Rolls ‘Ketel’ or ‘Cetyl’ or ‘Cattle.’ Such\r\nentries as ‘Ketel le Mercer,’ or ‘Chetel Frieday,’ or ‘Cattle Bagge,’\r\nare met with up to the fifteenth century, and as surnames ‘Kettle,’\r\n‘Chettle’ and ‘Cattle’ or ‘Cattell’ have a well-established place in the\r\nnineteenth. Of the compound forms we have already noticed ‘Thurkettle’\r\nor ‘Thurkell.’ ‘Anketil le Mercir’ (A), ‘Roger Arketel’ (A), ‘William\r\nAsketill’ (Q), and ‘Robert fil. Anskitiel’ (W. 12) are all but changes\r\nrung on Oskettle. The abbots of England, in 941, 992, and 1052, were\r\n‘Turketyl,’ ‘Osketyl,’ and ‘Wulfketyl’ respectively. The last seems to\r\nbe the same as ‘Ulchetel’ found in Domesday.[11] In the same Survey we\r\nlight upon a ‘Steinchetel,’ and ‘Grinketel’ is also found in a Yorkshire\r\nrecord of the same period.[12] Orm, the representative of pagan worship\r\nin respect of the serpent, has left its memorial in such entries as\r\n‘Alice fil. Orme,’ or ‘Ormus Archbragge.’ The descendants of these are\r\nour ‘Ormes’ and ‘Ormesons.’ More local names abide in ‘Ormsby,’\r\n‘Ormskirk,’ ‘Ormerod,’ and ‘Ormes Head.’\r\n\r\nA series of names, some of them connected with the heroic and legendary\r\nlore of Northern Europe, were formed from the root ‘sig’—conquest. Many\r\nof these maintained a position as personal names long after the Norman\r\ninvasion, and now exist in our directories as surnames. Nevertheless, as\r\nwith the others hitherto mentioned, they are all but invariably found in\r\ntheir simple and uncompounded form. Our ‘Sewards,’ ‘Seawards,’ and\r\n‘Sawards’ represent the chief of these. It is found in England in the\r\nseventh century, and was a great Danish name. Entries like ‘Syward\r\nGodwin’ or ‘Siward Oldcorn’ are found as late as the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century. Next we may mention our ‘Segars,’ ‘Sagars,’\r\n‘Sahers,’ ‘Sayers,’ and ‘Saers,’ undoubted descendants of such men as\r\n‘Saher de Quincy,’ the famous old Earl of Winchester. The registrations\r\nof this as a personal name are very frequent. Such entries as ‘John fil.\r\nSaer,’ ‘Saher Clerk,’ ‘Saher le King,’ or ‘Eudo fil. Sygar,’ are common.\r\nNor has ‘Sigbiorn’ been allowed to become obsolete, as our ‘Sibornes’\r\nand ‘Seabornes’ can testify. I cannot discover any instance of ‘Sibbald’\r\nas a personal name after the Domesday Survey, but as a relic of\r\n‘Sigbald’ it is still living in a surnominal form. Though apparently\r\noccupative, our registers clearly proclaim that ‘Seman’ or ‘Seaman’ must\r\nbe set here. As a personal name it is found in such designations as\r\n‘Seman de Champagne,’ or ‘Seaman de Baylif,’ or ‘Seaman Carpenter.’ With\r\nthe mention of ‘Sebright’ as a corruption of ‘Sigbert’ or ‘Sebert,’ I\r\npass on; but this is sufficient to show that a name whose root-meaning\r\nimplied heroism was popular with our forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe popular notion that ‘Howard’ is nothing but ‘Hogward’ is not borne\r\nout by facts. We find no trace whatever of its gradual reduction into\r\nsuch a corrupt form. As we shall have occasion to show hereafter, it is\r\nour ‘Hoggarts’ who thus maintain the honours of our swine-tending\r\nancestors. There can be little doubt, indeed, that ‘Howard’ is but\r\nanother form of ‘Harvard’ or ‘Hereward.’ That it had early become so\r\npronounced and spelt we can prove by an entry occurring in the Test.\r\nEbor. (Surt. Soc.) where one ‘John Fitz-howard’ is registered. Our\r\n‘Hermans’ and ‘Harmans’ represent ‘Herman,’ a name which, though in\r\nearly use in England, we owe chiefly to immigration in later days. Such\r\nentries as ‘Herman de Francia’ or ‘Herman de Alemannia’ are occasionally\r\nmet with. The fuller patronymic attached itself to this name; hence such\r\nentries as ‘Walter Hermanson,’ and ‘John Urmynson,’ ‘Harmer,’ and\r\n‘Hermer,’ seem to be somewhat of kin to the last. The personal form is\r\nfound in ‘Robert fil. Hermer,’ and the surname in ‘Hopkins Harmar.’\r\nBesides ‘Hardwin,’ ‘Hadwin’ is also met with as a relic of the same,\r\nwhile ‘Harding’ has remained unaltered from the day when registrars\r\nentered such names as ‘Robert fil. Harding’ and ‘Maurice fil. Harding;’\r\nbut this, as ‘Fitz-harding’ reminds us, must be looked upon as of Norman\r\nintroduction. Nor must ‘Swain’ be forgotten. We find in the Survey the\r\nwife of ‘Edward filius Suani,’ figuring among the tenants-in-chief of\r\nEssex. This is of course but our present ‘Swainson’ or ‘Swanson;’ and\r\nwhen we add all the ‘Swains,’ ‘Swayns,’ and ‘Swaynes’ of our directories\r\nwe shall find that this name has a tolerably assured position in the\r\nnineteenth century. ‘Swain’ implied strength, specially the strength of\r\nyouth; and as Samson’s strength became utter weakness through his\r\naffection, so I suppose it has fared with ‘Swain.’ The country shepherd\r\npiping to his mistress, the lovesick bachelor, has monopolised the\r\ntitle. As a personal name it occurs in such registrations as ‘Sweyn\r\nColle,’ ‘Swanus le Riche,’ or ‘Adam fil. Swain.’\r\n\r\n\r\n          II.—_Names introduced or confirmed by the Normans._\r\n\r\nOf names specially introduced at the Conquest, or that received an\r\nimpulse by that event, we may mention ‘Serl’ and ‘Harvey.’ ‘Serl,’ found\r\nin such names as ‘Serle Morice’ or ‘Serle Gotokirke,’ or ‘John fil.\r\nSerlo,’ still abides in our ‘Searles’ and ‘Serles,’ ‘Serrells’ and\r\n‘Serlsons.’ ‘William Serleson’ occurs in an old Yorkshire register, and\r\n‘Richard Serelson’ in the Parliamentary Writs. The Norman diminutive\r\nalso appears in Matilda Sirlot (A) and Mabel Sirlot (A).[13] ‘Harvey,’\r\nor ‘Herve,’ was more common than many may imagine, and a fair number of\r\nentries such as ‘Herveus le Gos’ or ‘William fil. Hervei,’ may be seen\r\nin all our large rolls. The Malvern poet in his ‘Piers Plowman’ employs\r\nthe name:—\r\n\r\n                        And thanne cam Coveitise,\r\n                        Can I hym naght descryve,\r\n                        So hungrily and holwe\r\n                        Sire Hervy hym loked.\r\n\r\n‘Arnold,’ now almost unknown in England as a baptismal name, made a deep\r\nimpression on our nomenclature, as it did on that of Central Europe.\r\n‘Earn’ for the eagle is a word not yet obsolete in the North of England,\r\nand this reminds us of the origin of the name. This kinship is more\r\neasily traceable in our registries where the usual forms are ‘Ernaldus\r\nCarnifix,’ or ‘Peter Ernald.’ Besides ‘Arnold,’ ‘Arnison,’ and the\r\ndiminutive ‘Arnott’ or ‘Arnet’[14] still live among us. ‘Alberic,’ or\r\n‘Albrec,’ as we find it occasionally written, soon found its way into\r\nour rolls as ‘Aubrey,’ although, as Ælfric, Miss Yonge shows it to have\r\nexisted in our country centuries earlier.[15] ‘Albred,’ probably but\r\nanother form of the lately revived ‘Albert,’ is now found as ‘Allbright’\r\nand the German ‘Albrecht.’\r\n\r\n‘Emery,’ though now utterly forgotten as a personal name, may be said to\r\nlive on only in our surnames. It was once no unimportant sobriquet.\r\n‘Americ,’ ‘Almeric,’ ‘Almaric,’ ‘Emeric,’ and ‘Eimeric,’ seem to have\r\nbeen its original spellings in England, and thus, at least, it is more\r\nlikely to remind us that it is the same name to which, in the Italian\r\nform of Amerigo, we now owe the title of that vast expanse of western\r\nterritory which is so indissolubly connected with English industry and\r\nEnglish interests. Curter forms than these were found in ‘Aylmar,’\r\n‘Ailmar,’ ‘Almar,’ and ‘Aymer,’ and ‘Amar.’ The surnames it has\r\nbequeathed to us are not few. It has had the free run of the vowels in\r\nour ‘Amorys,’ ‘Emerys,’ and ‘Imarys,’ and in a more patronymic form we\r\nmay still oftentimes meet with it in our ‘Emersons,’ ‘Embersons,’[16]\r\nand ‘Imesons.’ ‘Ingram’ represents the old ‘Ingelram,’ ‘Engleram,’\r\n‘Iggelram,’ or ‘Ingeram,’ for all these forms may be met with; and\r\n‘Ebrardus,’ later on registered as ‘Eborard,’ still abides hale and\r\nhearty in our ‘Everards’ and ‘Everys.’ The latter, however, can scarcely\r\nbe said to be quite extinct as a baptismal name. ‘Waleran,’ an English\r\nform of the foreign ‘Valerian,’ is found in such an entry as ‘Walerand\r\nBerchamstead,’ or ‘Waldrand Clark,’ or ‘Walran Oldman.’ We see at once\r\nthe origin of our ‘Walronds’ and ‘Walrands.’ The name of ‘Brice’ begins\r\nto find itself located in England at this time. Hailing from Denmark, it\r\nmay have come in with the earlier raids from that shore, or later on in\r\nthe more peaceful channels of trade. The Hundred Rolls furnish us with\r\n‘Brice fil. William’ and ‘Brice le Parsun,’ while the Placita de Quo\r\nWarranto gives us a ‘Brice le Daneys,’ who himself proclaims the\r\nnationality of the name. The Norman diminutive is met with in ‘Briccot\r\nde Brainton’ (M M). ‘Brice’ and ‘Bryson’ (when not a corruption of\r\n‘Bride-son’) are the present representatives of this now forgotten\r\nname.[17] All the above names I have placed together, because, while\r\nintroduced or receiving an impetus by the incoming of the Normans and\r\ntheir followers, they have, nevertheless, made little impression on our\r\ngeneral nomenclature. The fact that, with but one or two exceptions, the\r\nusual pet addenda, ‘kin,’ ‘cock,’ and ‘ot,’ or ‘et,’ are absolutely\r\nwanting, or even the patronymic ‘son,’ shows decisively that they cannot\r\nbe numbered among what we must call the popular names of the period.\r\nIntroduced here and there in the community at large, they struggled on\r\nfor bare existence, and have descended to us as surnames in their simple\r\nand unaltered form.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to a batch of personal names of a different character, names\r\nwhich, with a few exceptions, are still familiar to us at baptismal\r\ncelebrations, and which have changed themselves into so many varying\r\nforms, that the surnames issuing from them are well-nigh legion. Most of\r\nthese are the direct result of the Conquest. They are either the\r\nsobriquets borne by William, his family, and his leading followers, or\r\nby those whom connections of blood, alliance, and interest afterwards\r\nbrought into the country. Many others received their solid settlement in\r\nEngland through the large immigration of foreign artisans from Normandy,\r\nfrom Picardy, Anjou, Flanders, and other provinces. The Flemish\r\ninfluence has been very strong.\r\n\r\nI will first mention Drew, Warin, Paine, Ivo, and Hamon, because,\r\nalthough they must be included among the most familiar names of their\r\ntime, they are now practically disused at the font. ‘Drew,’ or ‘Drogo,’\r\noccurs several times in Domesday. An illegitimate son of Charlemagne was\r\nso styled, and, doubtless, it owed its familiarity to the adherents of\r\nthe Conqueror. Later on, at any rate, it was firmly established, as such\r\nnames as Drew Drewery, Druco Bretun, or William fil. Drogo testify. That\r\n‘Drewett’ is derived from the Norman diminutive can be proved from the\r\nHundred Rolls, wherein the same man is described in the twofold form of\r\n‘Drogo Malerbe’ and ‘Druett Malerbe.’ The feminine ‘Druetta de Pratello’\r\nis also found in the same records. ‘Drew’ and ‘Drewett’ are both in our\r\ndirectories.[18] Few names were more common from the eleventh to the\r\nfourteenth century than ‘Warin,’ or ‘Guarin,’ or ‘Guerin’—the latter the\r\nform at present generally found in France. It is the sobriquet that is\r\nincorporated in our ancient ‘Mannerings,’ or ‘Mainwarings,’ a family\r\nthat came from the ‘mesnil,’ or ‘manor,’ of ‘Warin,’ in a day when that\r\nwas a familiar Christian name in Norman households. A few generations\r\nlater on we find securely settled among ourselves such names as ‘Warin\r\nChapman,’ or ‘Warinus Gerold,’ or ‘Guarinus Banastre,’ in the baptismal,\r\nand ‘Warinus Fitz-Warin,’ or ‘John Warison,’ in the patronymic form,\r\nholding a steady place in our mediæval rolls. Two of the characters in\r\n‘Piers Plowman,’ as those who have read it will remember, bear this as\r\ntheir personal sobriquet:—\r\n\r\n                           One Waryn Wisdom\r\n                           And Witty his fere\r\n                           Followed him faste.\r\n\r\nAnd again—\r\n\r\n                        Then wente Wisdom\r\n                        And Sire Waryn the Witty\r\n                        And warnede wrong.\r\n\r\n‘Robert Warinot,’ in the Hundred Rolls, and ‘William Warinot’ in the\r\nPlacita de Quo Warranto, reveal the origin of our ‘Warnetts;’ while our\r\n‘Wareings,’ ‘Warings,’ ‘Warisons,’ ‘Wasons,’ and ‘Fitz-Warins’—often\r\nwritten ‘Fitz-Warren’—not to mention the majority of our ‘Warrens,’[19]\r\nare other of the descendants of this famous old name that still survive.\r\nA favourite name in these days was ‘Payn,’ or ‘Pagan.’ The softer form\r\nis given us in the ‘Man of Lawes Tale’—\r\n\r\n               The Constable, and Dame Hermegild his wife,\r\n               Were payenes, and that country everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe all know the history of the word; how that, while the Gospel had made\r\nadvance in the cities, but not yet penetrated into the country, the\r\ndwellers in the latter became looked upon with a something of contempt\r\nas idolaters, so that, so far as this word was concerned, ‘countryman’\r\nand ‘false-worshipper’ became synonymous terms. In fact, ‘pagan’\r\nembraced the two meanings that ‘peasant’ and ‘pagan’ now convey, though\r\nthe root of both is the same. The Normans, it would appear, must have so\r\nstyled some of themselves who had refused baptism after that their\r\nchieftain, Rollo, had become a convert; and hence, when William came\r\nover, the name was introduced into England by several of his followers.\r\nIn Domesday Book we find among his tenants-in-chief the names of ‘Ralph\r\nPaganel’ and ‘Edmund fil. Pagani.’ The name became more popular as time\r\nwent on, and it is no exaggeration to say that at one period—viz., the\r\nclose of the Norman dynasty—it had threatened to become one of the most\r\nfamiliar appellatives in England. This will account for the frequency\r\nwith which we meet such entries in the past as ‘Robert fil. Pain,’ ‘Pain\r\ndel Ash,’ ‘Pagan de la Hale,’ ‘Roger fil. Pagan,’ ‘Payen le Dubbour,’ or\r\n‘Elis le Fitz-Payn,’ and such surnames in the present as ‘Pagan,’\r\n‘Payne,’ ‘Payn,’ ‘Paine,’ ‘Pain,’ and ‘Pynson.’ The diminutive also was\r\nnot wanting, as ‘John Paynett’ (Z) or ‘Emma Paynot’ (W 2) could have\r\ntestified. Thus, while in our dictionaries ‘pagan’ still represents a\r\nstate of heathenism, in our directories it has long ago been converted\r\nto the uses of Christianity, and become at the baptismal font a\r\nChristian name. ‘Ivar,’ or ‘Iver,’ still familiarised to Scotchmen in\r\n‘Mac-Iver,’ came to the Normans from the northern lands whence they were\r\nsprung, and with them into England. It was not its first appearance\r\nhere, as St. Ives of Huntingdonshire could have testified in the seventh\r\ncentury. Still its popular character was due to the Norman. Such names\r\nas ‘Yvo de Taillbois’ (1211), mentioned in Bishop Pudsey’s ‘Survey of\r\nthe Durham See,’ ‘Ivo le Mercer,’ ‘Walter fil. Ive,’ ‘William Iveson,’\r\n‘Iveta Millisent,’ or ‘John fil. Ivette,’ serve to show us how familiar\r\nwas this appellation with both sexes.[20] Nor are its descendants\r\ninclined to let its memory die. We have the simple ‘Ive’ and ‘Ives;’ we\r\nhave the more patronymic ‘Iverson,’ ‘Ivison,’ ‘Iveson,’ and ‘Ison,’ and\r\nthe pet ‘Ivetts’ and ‘Ivatts,’ the latter possibly feminine in origin.\r\n\r\n‘Hamo,’ or ‘Hamon,’ requires a paragraph for itself. It is firmly\r\nimbedded in our existing nomenclature, and has played an important part\r\nin its time. Its forms were many, and though obsolete as baptismal\r\nnames, all have survived as surnames. Of these may be mentioned our\r\n‘Hamons,’ ‘Haymons,’ ‘Aymons,’ and ‘Fitz-Aymons.’ Formed like ‘Rawlyn,’\r\n‘Thomlin,’ and ‘Cattlin,’ it bequeathed us ‘Hamlyn,’ a relic of such\r\nfolk as ‘Hamelyn de Trap’ or ‘Osbert Hamelyn.’ Another change rung on\r\nthe name is traceable in such entries as ‘Hamund le Mestre,’ ‘Hamond\r\nCobeler,’ or ‘John Fitz-Hamond,’ the source of our ‘Hammonds’ and\r\n‘Hamonds;’ while in ‘Alice Hamundson’ or ‘William Hamneson’ we see the\r\nlineage of our many ‘Hampsons.’ But these are the least important. The\r\nNorman-French diminutive, ‘Hamonet,’ speedily corrupted into ‘Hamnet’\r\nand ‘Hammet,’ became one of our favourite baptismal names, and towards\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth one of the commonest. A ‘Hamnet de Dokinfield’ is\r\nfound so early as 1270 at Manchester (Didsbury Ch. Cheth. Soc.).\r\nShakespeare’s son was baptized ‘Hamnet,’ and was so called after ‘Hamnet\r\nSadler,’ a friend of the poet’s—a baker at Stratford. This man is styled\r\n‘Hamlet’ also, reminding us of another pet form of the name. We have\r\nalready mentioned ‘Richard,’ ‘Christian,’ ‘Hugh,’ and ‘Hobbe,’ as\r\nseverally giving birth to the diminutives, ‘Rickelot,’ ‘Crestelot,’\r\n‘Huelot,’ and ‘Hobelot.’ In the same way, ‘Hamon’ became ‘Hamelot,’ or\r\n‘Hamelet,’ hence such entries as ‘Richard, son of Hamelot’ (AA 2), and\r\n‘Hamelot de la Burste’ (Cal. and Inv. of Treasury). Out of fifteen\r\n‘Hamnets’ set down in ‘Wills and Inventories’ (Cheth. Soc.), six are\r\nrecorded as ‘Hamlet,’ one being set down in both forms as ‘Hamnet\r\nMassey’ and ‘Hamlet Massey’ (cf. i. 148, ii. 201). If the reader will\r\nlook through the index of Blomefield’s ‘Norfolk,’ he will find that\r\n‘Hamlet’ in that county had taken the entire place of ‘Hamnet.’ Amid a\r\nlarge number of the former I cannot find one of the latter. It would be\r\na curious question how far Shakespeare was biassed by the fact of having\r\na ‘Hamlet’ in his nursery into changing ‘Hambleth’ (the original title\r\nof the story) to the form he has now immortalized. An open Bible, and,\r\nfurther on, a Puritan spirit have left their influence on no name more\r\nmarkedly than ‘Hamon.’ As one after another new Bible character was\r\ncommemorated at the font, ‘Hamon’ got crushed out. Its last refuge has\r\nbeen found in our directories, for so long as our ‘Hamlets,’ ‘Hamnets,’\r\n‘Hammets,’ ‘Hammonds,’ and ‘Hampsons’ exist, it cannot be utterly\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n‘Guy,’ or ‘Guyon,’ dates from the ‘Round Table,’ but it was reserved for\r\nthe Norman to make his name so familiar to English lips. The best proof\r\nof this is that the surnames which it has left to us are all but\r\nentirely formed from the Norman-French diminutive ‘Guyot,’ which in\r\nEngland became, of course, ‘Wyot.’ Hence such entries as ‘Wyot fil.\r\nHelias,’ or ‘Wyott Carpenter,’ or ‘Wyot Balistarius.’ The descendants of\r\nthese, I need scarcely say, are our ‘Wyatts.’ But the Norman initial was\r\nnot entirely lost. ‘Aleyn Gyot’ is found in the ‘Rolls of Parliament;’\r\nand ‘Guyot’ and ‘Guyatt’ testify to its existence in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.[21] ‘Ralph,’ or ‘Radulf,’ of whom there were thirty-eight in\r\nDomesday, has survived in a number of forms. Our ‘Raffs’ and ‘Raffsons’\r\ncan carry back their descent to days when ‘Raffe Barton’ or ‘Peter\r\nRaffson’ thus signed themselves. The favourite pet forms were ‘Rawlin’\r\nand ‘Randle;’ hence such entries as ‘Raulyn de la Fermerie,’ ‘Raulina de\r\nBriston,’ or ‘Randle de la Mill.’ To these it is we owe our ‘Rawlins,’\r\n‘Rawlings,’ ‘Rawlinsons,’ ‘Rollins,’ ‘Rollinsons,’ ‘Randles’ and\r\n‘Randalls.’ Other and more ordinary corruptions are found in ‘Rawes,’\r\n‘Rawson,’ ‘Rawkins,’ ‘Rapkins,’ and ‘Rapson.’ The reader may easily see\r\nfrom this that ‘Ralph,’ from occupying a place in the foremost rank of\r\nearly favourites, is content now to stand in the very rear.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of names still in use, although not so popular as\r\nthey once were, which were brought in directly by the Normans, and which\r\nwere closely connected with the real or imaginary stories of which\r\nCharlemagne was the central figure. Italy, France, and Spain possess a\r\nlarger stock than we do of this class, but those which did reach our\r\nshores made for themselves a secure position. ‘Charles,’ by some strange\r\naccident, did not obtain a place in England, nor is it to be found in\r\nour registers, saving in the most isolated instances, till Charles the\r\nFirst, by his misfortunes, made it one of the commonest in the land. In\r\nFrance, as Sir Walter Scott, in ‘Quentin Durward,’ reminds us, the pet\r\nform was ‘Charlot’ and ‘Charlat.’ This, as a surname, soon found its way\r\nto England, where it has existed for many centuries. The feminine\r\n‘Charlotte,’ since the death of the beloved Princess of that name, has\r\nbecome almost a household word. Putting aside ‘Charles,’ then, the\r\nPaladins have bequeathed us ‘Roland,’ ‘Oliver,’ ‘Robert,’ ‘Richard,’\r\n‘Roger,’ ‘Reginald,’ ‘Reynard,’ and ‘Miles.’ We see at once in these\r\nnames the parentage of some of our most familiar surnames. ‘Oliver’ was,\r\nperhaps, the least popular so far as numbers were concerned, and might\r\nhave died out entirely had not the Protector Cromwell brought it again\r\ninto notoriety. ‘Oliver,’ ‘Olver,’ ‘Ollier,’ and ‘Oliverson’ are the\r\npresent forms, and these are met by such entries as ‘Jordan Olyver,’ or\r\n‘Philip fil. Oliver.’ ‘Roland,’ or ‘Orlando,’ was the nephew of the\r\ngreat Charles, who fell in his peerless might at Roncesvalles. Of him\r\nand Oliver, Walter Scott, translating the Norman chronicle, says—\r\n\r\n                 Taillefer, who sang both well and loud,\r\n                 Came mounted on a courser proud,\r\n                 Before the Duke the minstrel sprung,\r\n                 And loud of Charles and Roland sung,\r\n                 Of Oliver and champions mo,\r\n                 Who died at fatal Roncevaux.\r\n\r\n‘Roland’ was a favourite name among the higher nobility for centuries,\r\nand with our ‘Rolands,’ ‘Rowlands,’ ‘Rowlsons,’ and ‘Rowlandsons,’ bids\r\nfair to maintain its hold upon our surnames, if not the baptismal list.\r\nOld forms are found in such entries as ‘Roland le Lene,’ ‘Rouland\r\nBloet,’ ‘William Rollandson,’ or ‘Robert Rowelyngsonne’! We must not\r\nforget, too, that our ‘Rowletts’ and ‘Rowlets’ represent the French\r\ndiminutive.[22] ‘Robert’ is an instance of a name which has held its\r\nplace against all counter influences from the moment which first brought\r\nit into public favour. It is early made conspicuous in the eldest son of\r\nthe Bastard King who, through his miserable fate, became such an object\r\nof common pity that, though of the hated stock, his sobriquet became\r\nacceptable among the Saxons themselves. From that time its fortunes were\r\nmade, even had not the bold archer of Sherwood Forest risen to the fore,\r\nand caused ‘Hob’ to be the title of every other young peasant you might\r\nmeet ’twixt London and York. A curious instance of the popularity of the\r\nlatter is found in the fact that a tradesman living in 1388 in\r\nWinchelsea is recorded under the name of ‘Thomas Robynhod.’ The\r\ndiminutives ‘Robynet’[23] and ‘Robertot’ are obsolete, but of other\r\nforms that still thrive among us are ‘Roberts,’ ‘Robarts,’ ‘Robertson,’\r\n‘Robins,’ ‘Robinson,’ ‘Robison,’ and ‘Robson.’ From its shortened ‘Dob’\r\nare ‘Dobbs,’ ‘Dobson,’ ‘Dobbins,’ ‘Dobinson,’ and ‘Dobison.’[24] From\r\nits equally familiar ‘Hob’ are ‘Hobbs,’ ‘Hobson,’ ‘Hobbins,’ ‘Hopkins,’\r\nand ‘Hopkinson.’ From the Welsh, too, we get, as contractions of\r\n‘Ap-robert’ and ‘Ap-robin,’ ‘Probert’ and ‘Probyn.’ Thus ‘Robert’ is not\r\nleft without remembrance. Richard was scarcely less popular than Robert.\r\nThough already firmly established, for Richard was in the Norman ducal\r\ngenealogy before William came over the water, still it was reserved for\r\nthe Angevine monarch, as he had made it the terror of the Paynim, so to\r\nmake it the pride of the English heart. Richard I. is an instance of a\r\nman’s many despicable qualities being forgotten in the dazzling\r\nbrilliance of daring deeds. He was an ungrateful son, an unkind brother,\r\na faithless husband; but he was the idol of his time, and to him a large\r\nmass of English people of to-day owe their _nominal_ existence. From the\r\nname proper we get ‘Richards’ and ‘Richardson,’ ‘Ricks’ and ‘Rix,’\r\n‘Rickson’ and ‘Rixon,’ or ‘Ritson,’ ‘Rickards,’ and ‘Ricketts.’[25] From\r\nthe curter ‘Dick’ or ‘Diccon,’[26] we derive ‘Dicks’ or ‘Dix,’ ‘Dickson’\r\nor ‘Dixon,’ ‘Dickens’ or ‘Diccons,’ and ‘Dickenson’ or ‘Dicconson.’ From\r\n‘Hitchin,’ once nearly as familiar as ‘Dick,’ we get ‘Hitchins,’\r\n‘Hitchinson,’ ‘Hitchcock,’ and ‘Hitchcox.’ Like many another name, the\r\nnumber of ‘Richards’ now is out of all proportion less than these\r\nsurnames would ascribe to it some centuries ago. The reason of this we\r\nshall speak more particularly about by-and-by. Roger, well known in\r\nFrance and Italy, found much favour in England. From it we derive our\r\n‘Rogers,’ ‘Rodgers,’ and ‘Rogersons.’ From Hodge, its nickname, we\r\nacquired ‘Hodge,’ ‘Hodges,’ ‘Hodgkins,’ ‘Hotchkins,’ ‘Hoskins,’\r\n‘Hodgkinson,’ ‘Hodgson,’ and ‘Hodson,’ and through the Welsh ‘Prodger.’\r\nThe diminutive ‘Rogercock’ is found once, but it was ungainly, and I\r\ndoubt not met with little favour. Reginald, as Rinaldo, immortalized by\r\nthe Italian poet, appeared in Domesday as ‘Ragenald’ and ‘Rainald.’ Our\r\n‘Reynolds,’ represent the surname. ‘Renaud’ or ‘Renard,’ can never be\r\nforgotten while there is a single fox left to display its cunning. The\r\nstory seems to have been founded on the character of some real\r\npersonage, but his iniquities did not frighten parents from the use of\r\nthe name. ‘Renaud Balistarius’ or ‘Adam fil. Reinaud’ are common\r\nentries, and ‘Reynardsons’ and ‘Rennisons’ still exist. Our ‘Rankins,’\r\ntoo, would seem to have originated from this sobriquet since ‘Gilbert\r\nReynkin’ and ‘Richard Reynkyn’ are found in two separate rolls. Miles\r\ncame into England as ‘Milo,’ that being the form found in Domesday. It\r\nwas already popular with the Normans, and, like all other personal names\r\nfrom the same source, we find it speedily recorded in a diminutive\r\nshape, as ‘Millot’ and ‘Millet.’ ‘Roger Millot’ occurs in the Hundred\r\nRolls, and ‘Thomas Mylett’ in a Yorkshire register of an early date. The\r\npatronymics were ‘Mills,’ ‘Miles,’ ‘Millson,’ and ‘Mileson,’[27] all of\r\nwhich still exist.\r\n\r\nThe great race for popularity since Domesday record has ever been that\r\nbetween ‘William’ and ‘John.’ In the age immediately following the\r\nConquest ‘William’ decidedly held the supremacy. This is naturally\r\naccounted for by its royal associations. There was, indeed, a ‘John’ in\r\nthe same line of descent as the Bastard from Richard I. of Normandy, but\r\nthe name seems to have been forgotten, or passed by unheeded, till it\r\nwas revived again five generations later in ‘John Lackland.’ ‘William’\r\nenjoyed better auspices. It was the name of the founder of the new\r\nmonarchy. It was the name of his immediate successor. Whatever the\r\ncharacter of these two kings, such a conjunction could not but have its\r\nweight upon the especially Norman element in the kingdom. We find in\r\nDomesday that while there are 68 ‘Williams,’ 48 ‘Roberts,’ and 28\r\n‘Walters,’ there are only 10 ‘Johns.’ A century later than this,\r\n‘William’ must still have claimed precedence among the nobility at\r\nleast, as is proved by a statement of Robert Montensis. He says, that at\r\na festival held in the court of Henry II., in 1173, Sir William St. John\r\nand Sir William Fitz-Hamon, especial officers, had commanded that none\r\nbut those of the name of ‘William’ should dine in the Great Chamber with\r\nthem, and were, therefore, accompanied by one hundred and twenty\r\n‘Williams,’ all knights. By the time of Edward I. this disproportion had\r\nbecome less marked. In a list of names connected with the county of\r\nWiltshire in that reign, we find, out of a total of 588 decipherable\r\nnames (for the record is somewhat damaged), 92 ‘Williams’ to 88 ‘Johns,’\r\nwhile ‘Richard’ is credited with 55; ‘Robert,’ 48; ‘Roger,’ 23; and\r\n‘Geoffrey,’ ‘Ralph,’ and ‘Peter,’ each 16 names. This denotes clearly\r\nthat a considerable change had taken place in the popular estimation of\r\nthese two appellations. Within a century after this, however, ‘John’ had\r\nevidently gained the supremacy. In 1347, we find that out of 133 Common\r\nCouncilmen for London town first convened, 35 were ‘Johns,’ the next\r\nhighest being 17 under the head of ‘William,’ 15 under ‘Thomas,’ which\r\nnow, for obvious reasons we will mention hereafter, had suddenly sprung\r\ninto notoriety; 10 under ‘Richard,’ 9 under ‘Henry,’ 8 under ‘Robert,’\r\nand so on; ending with one each for ‘Laurence,’ ‘Reynald,’ ‘Andrew,’\r\n‘Alan,’ ‘Giles,’ ‘Gilbert,’ and ‘Peter.’ A still greater disproportion\r\nis found forty years later; for in 1385, the Guild of St. George, at\r\nNorwich, out of a total of 376 names, possessed 128 ‘Johns’ to 47\r\n‘Williams’ and 41 ‘Thomases.’[28] From this period, despite the hatred\r\nthat was felt for Lackland, ‘John’ kept the precedence it had won, and\r\nto this circumstance the nation owes the sobriquet it now generally\r\nreceives, that of ‘John Bull.’ Long ago, however, under the offensive\r\ntitle of ‘Jean Gotdam,’ we had become known as a people given to strange\r\nand unpleasant oaths. It is interesting to trace the way in which\r\n‘William’ has again recovered itself in later days. Throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages it occupied a sturdy second place, fearless of any rival\r\nbeyond the one that had supplanted it. Its dark hour was the Puritan\r\nCommonwealth. As a Pagan name it was rejected with horror and disdain.\r\nFrom the day of the Protestant settlement and William’s accession,\r\nhowever, it again looked up from the cold shade into which it had\r\nfallen, and now once more stands easily, as eight centuries ago, at the\r\nhead of our baptismal registers. ‘John,’ on the other hand, though it\r\nhad the advantage of being in no way hateful to the Puritan conscience,\r\nhas, from one reason or another, gone down in the world, and now has\r\nagain resumed its early place as second.\r\n\r\nThe surnames that have descended to us from ‘William’ and ‘John’ are\r\nwell-nigh numberless—far too many for enumeration here. To begin with\r\nthe former, however, we find that the simple ‘Williams’ and ‘Williamson’\r\noccupy whole pages of our directories. Besides these, we have from the\r\ncurter ‘Will,’ ‘Wills,’ ‘Willis,’ and ‘Wilson;’ from the diminutive\r\n‘Guillemot’ or ‘Gwillot,’ as it is often spelt in olden records.\r\n‘Gillot,’ ‘Gillott,’ and ‘Gillett;’ or from ‘Williamot,’[29] the more\r\nEnglish form of the same, ‘Willmot,’ ‘Wilmot,’ ‘Willot,’ ‘Willet,’ and\r\n‘Willert.’ In conjunction with the pet addenda, we get ‘Wilks,’\r\n‘Wilkins,’ and ‘Wilkinson,’ and ‘Wilcox,’ ‘Wilcocson,’ and ‘Wilcockson.’\r\nLastly, we have representatives of the more corrupt forms in such names\r\nas ‘Weeks,’ ‘Wickens,’ ‘Wickenson,’ and ‘Bill’ and ‘Bilson.’ Mr. Lower,\r\nwho does not quote any authority for the statement, alleges that there\r\nwas an old provincial nickname for ‘William’—viz., ‘Till;’ whence\r\n‘Tilson,’ ‘Tillot,’ ‘Tillotson,’ and ‘Tilly.’ That these are sprung from\r\n‘Till’ is evident, but there can be no reasonable doubt that this is but\r\nthe still existing curtailment of ‘Matilda,’ which, as the most familiar\r\nfemale name of that day, would originate many a family so entitled.\r\n‘Tyllott Thompson’ is a name occurring in York in 1414. Thus it is to\r\nthe Conqueror’s wife, and not himself, these latter owe their rise. It\r\nis not the first time a wife’s property has thus been rudely wrenched\r\nfrom her for her husband’s benefit. The surnames from ‘John’ are as\r\nmultifarious as is possible in the case of a monosyllable, ingenuity in\r\nthe contraction thereof being thus manifestly limited. As ‘John’ simple\r\nit is very rare; but this has been well atoned for by ‘Jones,’ which,\r\nadding ‘John’ again as a prænomen, would be (as has been well said by\r\nthe Registrar-General) in Wales a perpetual incognito, and being\r\nproclaimed at the cross of a market town would indicate no one in\r\nparticular. Certainly ‘John Jones,’ in the Principality, is but a living\r\ncontradiction to the purposes for which names and surnames came into\r\nexistence. Besides this, however, we have ‘Johnson’ and ‘Jonson,’\r\n‘Johncock’ and ‘Jenkins,’ ‘Jennings’ and ‘Jenkinson,’ ‘Jackson’ and\r\n‘Jacox,’ and ‘Jenks;’ which latter, however, now bids fair, under the\r\npatronage of ‘Ginx’s Baby,’ to be found for the future in a new and more\r\nquaint dress than it has hitherto worn. Besides several of the above, it\r\nis to the Welsh, also, we owe our ‘Ivens,’ ‘Evans,’ and ‘Bevans’ (_i.e._\r\nAp-Evan), which are but sprung from the same name. The Flemings, too,\r\nhave not suffered their form of it to die out for lack of support; for\r\nit is with the settlement of ‘Hans,’[30] a mere abbreviation of\r\n‘Johannes,’ we are to date the rise of our familiar ‘Hansons,’\r\n‘Hankins,’ ‘Hankinsons,’ and ‘Hancocks,’ or ‘Handcocks.’ Nor is this\r\nall. ‘John’ enjoyed the peculiar prerogative of being able to attach to\r\nitself adjectives of a flattering, or at least harmless nature, and\r\nissuing forth and becoming accepted by the world therewith. Thus—though\r\nwe shall have to notice it again—from the praiseworthy effort to\r\ndistinguish the many ‘Johns’ each community possessed, we have still in\r\nour midst such names as ‘Prujean’ and ‘Grosjean,’ ‘Micklejohn’ and\r\n‘Littlejohn,’ ‘Properjohn’ and ‘Brownjohn,’ and last, but not least, the\r\nestimable ‘Bonjohn.’ Do we need to go on to prove ‘Jack’s’ popularity,\r\nor rather universality?[31] Every stranger was ‘Jack’ till he was found\r\nto be somebody else; so that ‘every man Jack of them’ has been a kind of\r\ngeneral lay-baptism for ages. Every young supernumerary, whose position\r\nand age gave the licence, was in the eye of his superiors simply ‘Jack.’\r\nAs one instrument after another, however, was brought into use, by which\r\nmanual service was rendered unnecessary and ‘Jack’ unneeded, instead of\r\nsuperannuating him he was quietly thrust into the new and inanimate\r\noffice, and what with ‘boot-jacks’ and ‘black-jacks,’ ‘jack-towels’ and\r\n‘smoke-jacks,’ ‘jacks’ for this and ‘jacks’ for that, no wonder people\r\nhave begun to speak unkindly of him as ‘Jack-of-all-trades and master of\r\nnone.’ Still, with this uncomplimentary tone, there was a smack of\r\npraise. A notion, at any rate, got abroad that ‘Jack’ must be a knowing,\r\nclever, sharp-witted sort of fellow, one who has his eyes open. So we\r\ngot into the way of associating him with the more lively of the birds,\r\nbeasts, and fishes; such, for instance, as the ‘jack-daw,’ the\r\n‘jack-an-apes,’ and the ‘jack-pike.’ But ‘familiarity,’ as our copybooks\r\nlong ago informed us, ‘breeds contempt;’ and so was it with ‘Jack’—he\r\nbecame a mark for ridicule. Even in Chaucer’s day ‘jack-fool’ or\r\n‘jack-pudding’ was the synonym for a buffoon, and ‘jackass’ for a dolt;\r\nand here it but nationalises the ‘zany,’ a corruption of the Italian\r\n‘Giovanni,’ or ‘merry-John,’ corresponding to our ‘merry-Andrew.’ ‘Jack\r\nof Dover’ also existed at the same period as a cant term for a clever\r\nknave, and that it still lived in the seventeenth century is clear from\r\nTaylor’s rhyme, where he says:—\r\n\r\n            Nor Jacke of Dover, that grand jury Jacke,\r\n            Nor Jack-sauce, the worst knave amongst the pack,\r\n            But of the Jacke of Jackes, great Jack-a-Lent,\r\n            To write his worthy acts is my intent.[32]\r\n\r\nAltogether, we may claim for ‘John’ a prominent, if not distinguished,\r\nposition in the annals of English nomenclature. Nor must we forget\r\n‘Joan,’ until Tudor days the general form of the present ‘Jane.’ Then\r\n‘some of the better and nicer sort,’ as Camden saith, ‘misliking the\r\nformer, turned it into “Jane”;’ and in testimony of this he adds that\r\n‘Jane’ is never found in older records. This is strictly true. There can\r\nbe little doubt that when the fair queen of Henry VIII. gave distinction\r\nto the name it became a courtly fashion to give it a different form from\r\nthat borne by the multitude, and thus ‘Jane’ arose. Thus ‘Joan’ was\r\nleft, as Miss Yonge says, ‘to the cottage and the kitchen;’ and there,\r\nindeed, it lingered on for a long period.[33] Of many another could\r\nShakespeare have sung:—\r\n\r\n                  Then nightly sings the staring owl,\r\n                      To-who.\r\n                  To-whit, to-who, a merry note,\r\n                  While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.\r\n\r\nPreviously to this, anyway, both queens and princesses had been content\r\nwith ‘Joan.’ I doubt not, with regard to several of the surnames\r\nabove-mentioned, ‘John’ must, if the truth be told, share the honours of\r\norigination with ‘Joan;’ nor do I think ‘Jennison’ peculiar to the\r\nlatter. What with ‘John’ and ‘Jean’ for the masculine, and ‘Joan’ and\r\n‘Jenny’ for the feminine, I do not see how the two could possibly escape\r\nconfusion. ‘Jones’ and ‘Joanes,’ and ‘Jane’ and ‘Jayne,’ to say nothing\r\nof ‘Jennings,’ seem as like hereditary from the one as the other.[34]\r\nTwo feminines from ‘Jack,’ viz. ‘Jacquetta’ and ‘Jacqueline,’ were not\r\nunknown in England; ‘Jacquetta Knokyn’ (AA 3), ‘Jackett Toser’ (Z). The\r\nlatter was the more common, and bequeathed us a surname ‘Jacklin,’ which\r\nstill exists. It is found on an old bell:—\r\n\r\n      This bell was broke and cast againe, as plainly doth appeare,\r\n      John Draper made me in 1618, wich tyme churchwardens were,\r\n      Edward Dixson for the one, who stood close to his tacklin,\r\n      And he that was his partner there was Alexander Jacklin.\r\n                                          (_Book of Days_, i. 303.)\r\n\r\nThe peasant’s leather jerkin, corresponding to the more lordly coat of\r\nmail, was a _jack_ whence the diminutive _jacket_. The more warlike\r\ndress gave rise to the name of ‘Jackman,’ of which more anon.\r\n\r\nThe Angevine dynasty gave a new impulse to some already popular names,\r\nand may be said in reality to have introduced, although not altogether\r\nunknown, several new ones. The two which owe the security of their\r\nestablishment to it are ‘Geoffrey’ and ‘Fulke.’ The grandfather, the\r\nfather, a brother, and a son of Henry II. were ‘Geoffrey;’ and still\r\nearlier than this, ‘Geoffrey Grisegonelle,’ ‘Geoffrey Martel,’ and\r\n‘Geoffrey Barbu’ had each in turn set their mark upon the same. Apart\r\nfrom these influences, too, the stories brought home by the Crusaders of\r\nthe prowess of Godfrey, the conqueror of Jerusalem, must have had their\r\nwonted effect in a day of such martial renown. Such surnames as ‘Jeffs,’\r\n‘Jeffries,’ ‘Jefferson,’ ‘Jeffcock,’ ‘Jeffkins,’ ‘Jephson,’ and ‘Jepson’\r\nstill record the share it had obtained in English esteem. ‘Fulke,’ or\r\n‘Fulque,’ though there had been six so early as Domesday Book, when it\r\ncame backed as it was by the fact of having given title to five Angevine\r\nrulers, got an inevitable place. Few Christian names were so common as\r\nthis in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. But it was an ungainly\r\none, difficult to pronounce, and difficult to form into a patronymic.\r\nThus, ‘Faxson’ and ‘Fawson’ are the only longer forms I can find as at\r\npresent existing, while the variously spelt ‘Fulkes,’ ‘Foulkes,’\r\n‘Fakes,’ ‘Faux,’ ‘Fawkes,’ ‘Faulks,’ ‘Fowkes,’ ‘Folkes,’ ‘Foakes,’ and\r\ndoubtless sometimes ‘Fox,’ serve to show how hard it was to hand it down\r\nin its original integrity. The entries in our mediæval registers are\r\nequally varied. We light upon such people as ‘Fowlke Grevill,’ ‘Fowke\r\nCrompton,’ ‘Fulk Paifrer,’ ‘Fulke le Taverner,’ ‘Foke Odell,’ ‘Faukes le\r\nButeller,’ ‘Nel Faukes,’ and ‘John Faux.’ As an English historic name it\r\nhas given us two miscreants; the hateful favourite of John, outlawed by\r\nHenry III., and the still more sanguinary villain of James I.’s day, in\r\nwhose dishonour we still pile up the blazing logs in the gloomy nights\r\nof November. Henry, again, or more properly speaking Harry, owes much to\r\nthe Plantagenets, for but three are to be found in Domesday. With its\r\nlong line of monarchs, albeit it represented a curious mixture of good,\r\nbad, and indifferent qualities, that dynasty could not but stamp itself\r\ndecisively on our registers. Thus, we have still plenty of ‘Henrys,’\r\n‘Harrises,’ ‘Harrisons,’ ‘Hallets,’ ‘Halkets,’ ‘Hawkinses,’ and\r\n‘Hawkinsons;’ to say nothing of the Welsh ‘Parrys’ and ‘Penrys.’[35]\r\n(‘Thomas Ap-Harry,’ D. ‘Hugh Ap-harrye,’ Z.) The Norman diminutive was\r\nearly used, as such folk as ‘Alicia Henriot,’ ‘Robert Henriot,’ ‘Heriot\r\nHeringflet,’ ‘Thomas Haryette,’ or ‘William Haryott’ could have borne\r\nwitness. ‘Harriot,’ or ‘Harriet,’ has been revived in recent days as a\r\nfeminine baptismal name. ‘Hawkin,’ or ‘Halkin,’[36] however, was perhaps\r\nthe most popular form. Langland represents Conscience as saying:—\r\n\r\n                      Thi beste cote, Haukyn,\r\n                      Hath manye moles and spottes,\r\n                      It moste ben y-wasshe.\r\n\r\nBaldwin had already appeared at the Conquest, for an aunt of William’s\r\nhad married Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, and he himself was espoused to\r\nMatilda, daughter of the fifth ‘Baldwin’ of that earldom. No doubt the\r\nFlemings brought in fresh accessions, and when we add to this the fact\r\nof its being by no means an unpopular Angevine name, we can readily see\r\nwhy ‘Balderson,’ ‘Bolderson,’ ‘Balcock,’ ‘Bodkin,’ and the simple\r\n‘Baldwin,’ have maintained a quiet but steady position in the English\r\nlists ever since. Thus, the Plantagenets are not without memorials, even\r\nin the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n             III.—_Names from the Calendar of the Saints._\r\n\r\nIt is to Norman influence we owe the firm establishment of several\r\nnames, which had already got securely settled on the Continent on\r\naccount of the odour of sanctity that had gathered about them. The\r\nReformation threw into the shade of oblivion the memories of many holy\r\nmen and women who in their day and generation exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence on our general nomenclature. Many of my readers will be\r\nunaware that there were three St. Geralds and three St. Gerards held in\r\nhigh repute previous to the eleventh century. The higher Norman families\r\nseem to have been attached to both, though ‘Gerard’ has made the deepest\r\nimpression. ‘Gerald’ and ‘Fitz-Gerald’ are the commonest descendants of\r\nthe first. As respects ‘Gerard,’ such names as ‘Garret Widdrington,’ or\r\n‘Jarrarde Hall,’ or ‘Jarat Nycholson,’ found among our Yorkshire\r\nentries, serve to show how far the spirit of verbal corruption can\r\nadvance; and our many ‘Garrets,’ ‘Jarrets,’ ‘Jarratts,’ and ‘Jerards,’\r\nas surnames, will probably testify the same to all ages.[37] As there\r\nwere twenty-eight ‘Walters’ in Domesday Survey, we cannot attribute the\r\npopularity of that name to St. Walter, abbot of Fontenelle in the middle\r\nof the twelfth century. But, as Miss Yonge shows, it had been spread\r\nover Aquitaine in the earlier part of the tenth century, through the\r\ncelebrity of a saintly Walter who resided in that dukedom about the year\r\n990. Few sobriquets enjoyed such a share of attention as this. In one of\r\nits nicknames, that of ‘Water,’[38] we are reminded of Suffolk’s death\r\nin Shakespeare’s _Henry VI._, where the murderer says—\r\n\r\n                      My name is Walter Whitmore.\r\n      How now! why start’st thou? What, doth death affright!\r\n        _Suffolk._ Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.\r\n      A cunning man did calculate my birth,\r\n      And told me that by _water_ I should die.\r\n\r\nUniversity men will remember a play of another kind upon its other form\r\nof ‘Wat,’ in the poems of C. S. C., whose power of rhyming, at least, I\r\nhave never seen surpassed, even by Ingoldsby himself. He thus begins one\r\nof his happiest efforts—\r\n\r\n                  Ere the morn the east has crimsoned,\r\n                    When the stars are twinkling there,\r\n                  (As they did in Watts’s Hymns, and\r\n                    Made him wonder what they were.)\r\n\r\nThis, too, it will be seen, as well as ‘Water,’ still abides with us in\r\nits own or an extended guise, for our ‘Watts’ and ‘Waters,’ ‘Watsons’\r\nand ‘Watersons,’ ‘Watkins’ and ‘Watkinsons,’ would muster strongly if in\r\nconclave assembled. Our ‘Waltrots,’ though not so numerous, are but the\r\nancient ‘Walterot.’ As a Christian name Walter stands low now-a-days.\r\n‘Tonkin,’ ‘Tonson,’ and ‘Townson’ (found in such an entry as ‘Jane\r\nTounson’) remind us of ‘Anthony,’[39] a name previous to the Reformation\r\npopular as that possessed by the great ascetic of the fourth century. A\r\ncurious phrase got connected with St. Anthony, that of ‘tantony-pig.’ It\r\nis said that monks attached to monasteries dedicated to this saint had\r\nthe privilege of allowing their swine to feed in the streets. These\r\nhabitually following those who were wont to offer greens to them, gave\r\nrise to the expression, ‘To follow like a Tantony-pig.’ Thus, in ‘The\r\ngood wyfe wold a pylgremage,’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                   When I am out of the towne,\r\n                     Look that thou be wyse,\r\n                   And run thou not from hous to hous,\r\n                     Like a nantyny grice.\r\n\r\nThe connection between St. Anthony and swine, which gave the good monks\r\nthis benefit, seems, in spite of many wild guesses, to have arisen from\r\nthe mere fact of his dwelling so long in the woodlands. As Barnabe Googe\r\nhas it—\r\n\r\n                   The bristled hogges doth Antonie\r\n                     Preserve and cherish well,\r\n                   Who in his lifetime always did\r\n                     In woodes and forestes dwell.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been this connexion which made ‘Tony’ the common sobriquet\r\nfor a simpleton or a country clown. It lived in this sense till Dryden’s\r\nday, and certainly had become such so early as the thirteenth century,\r\nif we may judge by the occurrence of such names as ‘Ida le Tony,’ or\r\n‘Roger le Tony,’ found in the Rolls of that period.[41] If, however, St.\r\nAnthony was thus doomed to be an example, how great may be the drawbacks\r\nto saintly distinction: ‘St. Cuthbert,’ who, in the odour of sanctity,\r\ndwelt at Lindisfarne, may even be more pitied, for, owing to the\r\nfamiliarity of his name in every rustic household of Northumbria and\r\nDurham, he became as ‘Cuddie,’ a sobriquet for the donkey, and is thus\r\nknown and associated to the present moment. Our ‘Cuthberts,’\r\n‘Cuthbertsons,’ and ‘Cutbeards,’ however, need trouble themselves\r\nlittle, I imagine, on the question of their connection with the animal\r\nto whom we usually ascribe the honours in regard to obstinacy and\r\nstubbornness. Our ‘Cuddies,’ perhaps, are not quite so free from\r\nsuspicion. Our ‘Cobbets’ undoubtedly spring from ‘Cuthbert.’ A ‘Nicholas\r\nCowbeytson’ occurs in a Yorkshire register of the fourteenth century\r\n(Fabric Rolls of York Minster: Sur. Soc.). From ‘Cowbeyt’ to ‘Cobbet’ is\r\na natural—I might say an inevitable—change. This name, however, owes\r\nnothing to the Normans. Not so ‘Giles.’ Everyone knows the story of St.\r\nGiles, how he dwelt as an anchorite in the forest near Nismes, and was\r\ndiscovered by the King because the hind, which daily gave him milk,\r\npushed in the chase, fled to his feet. The name is entered in our rolls\r\nalike as ‘Giles,’ ‘Gile,’ and ‘Egedius’ (Gile Deacon. A. Jordan fil.\r\nEgidius, A). St. Lawrence, put on a gridiron over a slow fire in the\r\nthird century, made his name popular in Spain. An archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, raised to a saintship in the seventh century, made the same\r\nfamiliar in England. Besides ‘Lawson,’ we have ‘Larkins’ and ‘Larson.’\r\nIn the lines already quoted relative to Wat Tyler’s insurrection, it is\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n               _Larkin_ et in medio, non minor esse putat.\r\n\r\nThe French diminutive occurs also. An ‘Andrew Larrett’ is mentioned by\r\nNicholls in his history of Leicestershire, and the surname may still be\r\nseen in our directories. ‘Lambert’ received a large accession in England\r\nthrough the Flemings, who thus preserved a memorial of the patron of\r\nLiege, St. Lambert, who was martyred early in the eighth century.\r\nSuccumbing to the fashion so prevalent among the Flemings, it is\r\ngenerally found as ‘Lambkin,’ such entries as ‘Lambekyn fil. Eli’ or\r\n‘Lambekin Taborer’ being common. The present surnominal forms are\r\n‘Lambert,’ ‘Lampson,’[42] ‘Lambkin,’ and ‘Lampkin.’ Thus our ‘Lambkins’\r\ncannot boast of the Moses-like disposition of their ancestor on\r\nphilological grounds. With the mention of three other saints we conclude\r\nthis list. The legend of St. Christopher had its due effect on the\r\npopular taste, and it is early found in the various guises of\r\n‘Cristophre,’ ‘Cristofer,’ and ‘Christofer.’ ‘Christophers’ and\r\n‘Christopherson’ represent the surnames of the fuller form. To the pet\r\nform we owe our ‘Kitts’ and ‘Kitsons.’ St. Christopher’s Isle in the\r\nWest Indies is now familiarly St. Kitts. It was of the indignity offered\r\nto Christopher Marlowe’s genius in calling him so generally by this\r\nbrief sobriquet that Heywood spoke when he said—\r\n\r\n             Marlowe, renowned for his rare art and wit,\r\n             Could ne’er attain beyond the name of Kit.[43]\r\n\r\nThe same writer has it also in one of his epigrams—\r\n\r\n         Nothing is lighter than a feather, Kytte,\r\n         Yes, Climme: what light thing is that? thy light wytte.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned one abbot of Fontenelle who influenced our\r\nnomenclature. Another who exerted a similar power was ‘St. Gilbert,’ a\r\ncontemporary and friend of the Conqueror. A few generations afterwards\r\nbrought the English St. Gilbert to the fore, and then the name began to\r\ngrow common, so common that as ‘Gib’ it became the favourite sobriquet\r\nof the feline species.[44] In several of our earliest writers it is\r\nfound in familiar use, and in the Bard of Avon’s day it was not\r\nforgotten. Falstaff complains of being as melancholy as a ‘gib-cat’—that\r\nis, an old worn-out cat. Hamlet also says—\r\n\r\n             For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\r\n             Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\r\n             Such dear concernings hide? (iii. 4.)\r\n\r\n‘To play the gib’ was a proverbial phrase for light and wanton\r\nbehaviour.[45] Thus ‘Gilbert’ has been forced into a somewhat unpleasant\r\nnotoriety in feline nomenclature. But he was popular enough, too, among\r\nthe human kind. In that part of the ‘Townley Mysteries’ which represents\r\nthe Nativity, one of the shepherds is supposed to hail one of his\r\nfriends, who is passing by. He addresses him thus:—\r\n\r\n                 How, Gyb, good morne, wheder goys thou?\r\n\r\nThe surnames formed from Gilbert, too, prove his popularity. Beside\r\n‘Gilbert’ himself, we have ‘Gibbs,’ ‘Gibbins,’ ‘Gibbons,’ ‘Gibson,’[46]\r\n‘Gibbonson,’ and ‘Gipps,’ to say nothing of that famous citizen of\r\ncredit and renown, ‘John Gilpin,’ who has immortalized at least his\r\nsetting of this good old-fashioned name.\r\n\r\nHaving referred to Gilbert and Gib the cat, we must needs notice\r\n‘Theobald’ and ‘Tib.’ ‘St. Theobald,’ if he has not himself given much\r\nprominence to the title, nevertheless represents a name whose\r\nsusceptibility to change was something amazing. The common form with the\r\nFrench was ‘Thibault’ or ‘Thibaud,’ and this is represented in England\r\nin such entries as ‘Tebald de Engleschevile,’ ‘Richard Tebaud,’ or\r\n‘Roger Tebbott.’ A still curter form was ‘Tibbe’ or ‘Tebbe;’ hence such\r\nregistrations as ‘Tebbe Molendinarius’ or ‘Tebb fil. William.’ In this\r\ndress it is found in the Latin lines commemorative of Tyler’s\r\ninsurrection:—\r\n\r\n         _Hudde_ ferit, quem _Judde_ terit, dum _Tibbe_ juvatur,\r\n           _Jacke_ domosque viros vellit, en ense necat.\r\n\r\nAmong other surnames that speak for its faded popularity are ‘Tibbes,’\r\n‘Tebbes,’ and ‘Tubbs,’ ‘Theobald’ and ‘Tibbald,’ ‘Tibble’ and ‘Tipple,’\r\n‘Tipkins’ and ‘Tippins,’ and ‘Tipson,’ and our endlessly varied\r\n‘Tibbats,’ ‘Tibbets,’ ‘Tibbits,’ ‘Tebbatts,’ ‘Tebbotts,’ and ‘Tebbutts.’\r\nIndeed, the name has simply run riot among the vowels. ‘Hugh’ I have\r\nkept till the last, because of its important position as an early name.\r\nIt was crowded with holy associations. There was a ‘St. Hugh,’ Abbot of\r\nCluny, in 1109. There was a ‘St. Hugh,’ Bishop of Grenoble, in 1132.\r\nThere was ‘St. Hugh,’ Bishop of Lincoln, in 1200, and above all there\r\nwas the celebrated infant martyr, ‘St. Hugh,’ of Lincoln, said to have\r\nbeen crucified by the Jews of that city in 1250. This event happened\r\njust at the best time for affecting our surnames. Their hereditary\r\ntendency was becoming marked. Thus it is that ‘Hugh,’ or ‘Hew,’[47] as\r\nit was generally spelt, has made such an indenture upon our\r\nnomenclature. The pet forms are all Norman-French, the most popular\r\nbeing ‘Huet,’ ‘Hugon,’ and ‘Huelot,’ the last formed like ‘Hamelot,’ and\r\n‘Hobelot.’ The second of these was further corrupted by the English into\r\n‘Hutchin’ and ‘Huggin.’[48] Hence our rolls teem with such registrations\r\nas ‘Hewe Hare,’ ‘Huet de Badone,’ ‘William fil. Hugonis,’ ‘Houlot de\r\nManchester,’ ‘Walter Hughelot,’ ‘John Hewisson,’ ‘Simon Howissone,’\r\n‘Roger fil. Hulot,’ or ‘Alan Huchyns.’ Among the surnames still common\r\nin our directories may be numbered ‘Huggins,’ ‘Hutchins,’ ‘Hutchinson,’\r\n‘Hugginson,’ ‘Howlett,’ ‘Hullett,’ ‘Hewlett,’ ‘Huet,’ ‘Hewet,’\r\n‘Hewetson,’ ‘Howett,’ ‘Howson,’ ‘Hughes,’ and ‘Hewson.’ All these\r\nvarious forms bespeak a familiarity which is now of course utterly\r\nwanting, so far as our Christian nomenclature is concerned. Indeed,\r\nafter all I have said, I still feel that it is impossible to give the\r\nreader an adequate conception of the popularity of this name four\r\nhundred years ago. It is one more conspicuous instance marking the\r\nchange which the Reformation and an English Bible effected upon our\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n            IV.—_Names chosen from Festivals and Holydays._\r\n\r\nWe may here refer to a group of appellatives which are derived from the\r\nnames of certain days and seasons. I dare not say that all I shall\r\nmention are absolutely sprung from one and the same custom. Some, I\r\ndoubt not, were bestowed upon their owners from various accidental\r\ncircumstances of homely and individual interest. Neighbours would\r\nreadily affix a nickname of this class upon one who had by some\r\ncreditable or mean action made a particular season remarkable in his\r\npersonal history. But these, I presume, will be exceptional, for there\r\nis no manner of doubt that it was a practice, and by no means a rare\r\none, to baptize a child by the name of the day on which it was born,\r\nespecially if it were a holiday. We know now how often it happens that\r\nthe Church Calendar furnishes names for those born upon the Saints’\r\ndays—how many ‘Johns’ and ‘Jameses’ and ‘Matthews’ owe their\r\nappellations to the fact that they came into the world upon the day\r\nmarked, ecclesiastically, for the commemoration of those particular\r\nApostles. This is still a custom among more rigid Churchmen. In early\r\ndays, however, it was carried to an extreme extent. Days of a simply\r\nlocal interest—days for fairs and wakes—days that were celebrated in the\r\ncivil calendar—days that were the boundaries of the different\r\nseasons—all were familiarly pressed into the service of name-giving.\r\nThese, springing up in a day when they were no sooner made part of the\r\npersonal than they became candidates for our hereditary nomenclature,\r\nhave in many cases come down to us. Thus, the time when the yule log\r\nblazed and crackled on the hearth has given us ‘Christmas,’ or ‘Noel,’\r\nor ‘Yule,’ or ‘Midwinter.’ This last seems to have been an ordinary term\r\nfor the day, for we find it in colloquial use at this time. In Robert of\r\nGloucester’s ‘Life of William the Conqueror,’ he speaks of it’s being\r\nhis intention\r\n\r\n                              to Midwinter at Gloucester,\r\n          To Witesontid at Westminster, to Ester at Wincester.\r\n\r\n‘Pentecost’ was as familiar a term in the common mouth as ‘Whitsuntide,’\r\nand thus we find both occurring in the manner mentioned. ‘Wytesunday’\r\nis, however, now obsolete; ‘Pentecost’ still lives.[49] ‘Paske,’ for\r\n‘Easter,’ was among the priesthood the word in general use; old writers\r\nalways speak of ‘Paske’ for that solemn season. Thus, ‘Pask,’ ‘Pash,’\r\n‘Paschal,’ and ‘Pascal’[50] are firmly set in our directories; as,\r\nindeed, they are on the Continent also. It is the same with ‘Lammas,’\r\n‘Sumption,’ and ‘Middlemas;’ that is, ‘Assumption’ and ‘Michaelmas.’\r\nEach as it came round imprinted its name at the baptismal font upon the\r\nancestors of all those who still bear these several titles in our midst.\r\nIt would be an anachronism, therefore, to suppose Mr. Robinson Crusoe to\r\nhave been the first who introduced this system, as even ‘Friday’ itself,\r\nto say nothing of ‘Munday,’ or ‘Monday,’ and ‘Saturday,’ and ‘Tuesday,’\r\nwere all surnames long anterior to that notable personage’s existence.\r\nNor, as I have said, are the less solemn feast days disregarded.\r\n‘Loveday’ is one such proof. In olden times there was often a day fixed\r\nfor the arrangement of differences, in which, if possible, old sores\r\nwere to be healed up and old-standing accounts settled. This day, called\r\na ‘Loveday,’ is frequently alluded to. That very inconsistent friar in\r\nPiers Plowman’s Vision could, it is said—\r\n\r\n                                      hold lovedays,\r\n                    And hear a reves rekenyng.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the quotation suggests to us the origin of ‘Termday,’\r\nwhich I find as existing in the twelfth century, and probably given in\r\nthe humorous spirit of that day.[51] Nor are these all. ‘Plouday’ was\r\nthe first Monday after Twelfth Night, and the day on which the farmer\r\nbegan his ploughing. It was a great rural holiday at one time, and the\r\nploughmen as a rule got gloriously drunk. Similarly, we have\r\n‘Hockerday,’ ‘Hockday,’ and perhaps the still more corrupted ‘Hobday,’\r\nthe old English expression for a ‘high-day.’ The second Tuesday after\r\nEaster was especially so termed, and kept in early times as such, as\r\ncommemorative of the driving out of the Danes in the days of Ethelred.\r\nThis was a likely name to be given on such a high day in the domestic\r\nannals as that on which the first-born came into the world. Happy\r\nparents would readily seize upon this at a time when the word and its\r\nmeaning were alike familiar. Our ‘Hallidays’ or ‘Hollidays’ throw us\r\nback to the Church festivals, those times of merriment and jollity which\r\nhave helped to such a degree to dissociate from our minds the real\r\nmeaning of the word (that is, a day set apart for holy service in\r\ncommemoration of some religious event), that we have now been compelled\r\nby a varied spelling to make the distinction between a ‘holyday’ and a\r\n‘holiday.’ Thus strongly marked upon our nomenclature is this once\r\nfavourite but now well-nigh obsolete custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n               V.—_Patronymics formed from Occupations._\r\n\r\nWe may here briefly refer to a class of patronymics which, although\r\nsmall from the first, took its place, as if insensibly, among our\r\nhereditary surnames. It is a class of _occupative_ or _professional_\r\nnames, with the filial desinence attached. There is nothing wonderful in\r\nthe fact of the existence of such. The wonder is that there are not more\r\nof them. It must have been all but as natural to style a man as the son\r\nof ‘the Clerk’ as the son of ‘Harry’ in a small community, where the\r\nfather had, in his professional capacity, established himself as of some\r\nlocal importance. Hence we cannot be surprised to find ‘Clerkson’ in our\r\nregisters. It is thus the ‘sergeant’ has bequeathed us our\r\n‘Sergeantsons;’ the ‘kemp,’ or soldier, our ‘Kempsons;’ the ‘cook,’ our\r\n‘Cooksons,’ or ‘Filius Coci,’ as the Hundred Rolls have it; the ‘smith,’\r\nour ‘Smithsons;’ the ‘steward,’ our ‘Stewardsons;’ the ‘grieve,’ _i.e._\r\n‘reeve,’ our ‘Grievesons;’ the ‘miller,’ our ‘Millersons;’ and the\r\n‘shepherd,’ our ‘Shepherdsons.’ Of other instances, now obsolete, we had\r\n‘Masterson,’ ‘Hyneson,’[52] ‘Hopperson,’ ‘Scolardson,’ and ‘Priestson.’\r\nNor were the Normans without traces of this practice, although in their\r\ncase all the examples I have met with have ceased to exist amongst us.\r\n‘Fitz-Clerk’ but corresponds with one of the above; while the warden of\r\nthe woods gave us ‘Fitz-Parker,’ and that of the college,\r\n‘Fitz-Provost.’ Thus, those who yet possess names of this class may\r\ncongratulate themselves upon belonging to a small but compact body which\r\nhas ever existed amid our more general nomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VI.—_Metronymics._\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Joan as having bequeathed several surnames. We\r\ndid not then allude to the somewhat difficult subject of metronymics; we\r\nshall first prove by examples that there are a large number of such. We\r\nshall then briefly unfold their origin from our point of view. The\r\nfeminine of Peter, ‘Petronilla,’ was a name in familiar use at this\r\ntime. St. Petronilla, once much besought as a help against fevers, would\r\nno doubt add to its popularity. Barnyby Googe says:—\r\n\r\n                   The quartane ague and the rest\r\n                     Doth Pernel take away,\r\n                   And John preserves his worshippers\r\n                     From prison every day.\r\n\r\nIn the above stanza we are supplied with the common sobriquet taken from\r\nhis name. As ‘Pernel’ or ‘Parnel’ it held a high place among the poorer\r\nclasses. From an ill-repute, however, that attached to it in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it is now all but extinct as a\r\nChristian name, and it is only among our surnames that it is to be met\r\nwith. It is curious how associations of this kind destroy the chances of\r\npopularity among names. ‘Peter’ was forced into familiarity. ‘Pernel’\r\nlost caste through its becoming a cant term for women of a certain\r\ncharacter. ‘Magdalen’ is another case in point. The Bible narrative\r\ndescribes her briefly as a penitent sinner. Legend, adding to this,\r\nportrayed her beauty, her golden tresses, her rich drapery. Art added\r\ntouches of its own in the shape of dishevelled hair and swelled eyes,\r\nbut all to make this centre scene of penitence the more marked. This,\r\nand the early asylums for penitents, of which she became the forced\r\npatroness, prevented her name being used as a Christian name at this\r\ntime—I have never, at least, found an instance. But as a proof how early\r\nit had become a term for what I may call mental inebriety, a connection\r\nwhich of course it owes to the portrayals alluded to above, I may\r\ninstance the name of Thomas le Maddelyn, found in the twelfth century\r\n(H.R.), and an evident nickname given to one of a sickly sentimental\r\ncharacter. Our present ‘Maudlins’ and ‘Maudlings’ may be descended from\r\none so entitled, or locally from some place dedicated to the saint.\r\n\r\nAmong other female names, ‘Constance’ bid fair to become very popular. A\r\ndaughter of William the Conqueror, a daughter of Stephen, and a\r\ndaughter-in-law of Henry II. were all so called. Chaucer in his ‘Man of\r\nLawes Tale’ calls his heroine by this title—\r\n\r\n               But Hermegild loved Custance as her life,\r\n               And Custance hath so long sojourned there\r\n               In orisons, with many a bitter tear,\r\n               Til Jesu hath converted, through his grace,\r\n               Dame Hermegild.\r\n\r\nThis must have been its favourite form in the common mouth, for we find\r\nit recorded in such names as ‘Custance Muscel,’ ‘Custance Clerk,’\r\n‘Robert fil. Custe,’ or ‘Cus nepta Johannis,’ with tolerable frequency.\r\nThe diminutive ‘Cussot’ is also to be met with. I need hardly say that\r\nin our ‘Custances,’ ‘Custersons,’ ‘Cuss’s,’ and ‘Custs,’ not to say some\r\nof our ‘Cousens,’ as corruptions of ‘Custson,’ the remembrance of this\r\nonce familiar name still survives. Of late years the name proper has\r\nagain become popular. ‘Beatrice’ is another instance of a name once\r\ncommon sunk into comparative desuetude. The Norman ‘Beton’ was the most\r\nfavoured pet form. Piers Plowman says (Passus V.):—\r\n\r\n               Beton the Brewestere bade him good-morrow,\r\n\r\nand a little further on,\r\n\r\n         And bade Bette cut a bough, and beat Betoun therewith.\r\n\r\nThus it is we frequently light upon such entries as ‘John Betyn,’ ‘Betin\r\nde Friscobald,’ ‘Robert Betonson,’ ‘John Bettenson,’ or ‘Thomas\r\nBetanson.’ These latter of course soon dropped into ‘Beatson’ and\r\n‘Betson,’ which, with ‘Beton’ and ‘Beaton,’ are still common to our\r\ndirectories. ‘Emma,’ too, as a Norman name has left its mark. By a pure\r\naccident, however, as Miss Yonge points out, it had got a place previous\r\nto the Conquest among the Saxons, through the fact of the daughter of\r\nRichard I. of Normandy marrying first Ethelred, surnamed the Unready,\r\nand then Canute the Great. Thus, though it has not unfrequently been\r\nclaimed as of Saxon origin, it is not so in reality. The general\r\nspelling is ‘Emme,’ and the pet ‘Emmot’ or ‘Emmet’ is found in such\r\nnames as ‘Emmota Plummer’ or ‘Emmetta Catton.’ This at once guides us\r\ninto the source of our ‘Emmots,’ ‘Emmetts,’[53] ‘Emmes,’ ‘Emsons,’\r\n‘Empsons,’ and ‘Emmotsons.’[54]\r\n\r\nAlmost as equal a favourite as ‘Emma’ was ‘Cecilia.’ This was a name\r\nintroduced at the Conquest in the person of Cecile, a daughter of\r\nWilliam I., and it soon found itself a favourite among high and low as\r\n‘Cicely,’ or still shorter as ‘Cis’ or ‘Sis,’ although the latter seems\r\nto have been the more general form. In Piers Plowman, however, is\r\npreserved the more correct initial. I have already quoted him when he\r\nspeaks so familiarly of\r\n\r\n                          Cesse the souteresse.\r\n\r\nIn all the ballads of the seventeenth century, on the other hand, it is\r\nalways ‘Sis,’ ‘Siss’ or ‘Sys.’\r\n\r\n                  Long have I lived a bachelor’s life,\r\n                    And had no mind to marry;\r\n                  But now I would fain have a wife,\r\n                    Either Doll, Kate, Sis, or Mary.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Sissons,’ ‘Sysons,’ and ‘Sisselsons’[55] are of course but the\r\noffspring of this pretty appellative, while one more instance of the\r\npopular diminutive may be met with in such a name as ‘John Sissotson’ or\r\n‘Cissota West’ found in the ‘Testamenta Eboracensia,’ or ‘Bella\r\nCesselot’ in the Hundred Rolls.[56] Our ‘Dowses,’ ‘Dossons,’ and\r\n‘Dowsons’ represent the once popular ‘Douce,’ ‘Duce,’ or ‘Dulce,’ more\r\ncorrectly ‘Dulcia.’ Hence we find such entries as ‘John filius Dousæ,’\r\n‘Douce de Moster,’ and ‘John Dowsson.’ Diminutives are found in ‘Richard\r\nDowkin’ (F), and in ‘Dowsett,’ ‘Doucett,’ and ‘Duckett.’ The Norman was\r\nthe more familiar form, all the more so perhaps because in the baronial\r\nkitchen a course of sweets was called _dowcetts_. An instance will be\r\nfound in the Rutland papers, p. 97 (Cam. Soc.). This is but another form\r\nof our ‘dulcet.’ That the more literal form was not lost, such names as\r\n‘Dulcia le Draper’ or ‘Dulcia fil. William’ will show, not to mention\r\nour still existing patronymic ‘Dulson.’ The later ‘Dulcibella’ underwent\r\nthe same change and became ‘Dowsabell.’ This also attained the rank of a\r\nsurname, for beside such entries as ‘Dowzable Mill’ (Z) and ‘Dussabel\r\nCaplyn’ (Z) we light upon a ‘Thomas Duszabell’ (M). Thus familiar was\r\n‘Dulcia’ in former days. ‘Dionisia del Lee’ or ‘Dionisius Garston’ are\r\ncommon entries, both masculine and feminine forms being popular.\r\n‘Dennis,’ ‘Denot,’ and ‘Dyot’ were the pet forms. Piers Plowman styles\r\none of his characters ‘Denot.’ Hereditary forms are found in ‘Dennis,’\r\n‘Dennison,’ ‘Dyott,’ ‘Diotson,’[57] and ‘Dyson.’ I cannot but think that\r\n‘Tenison’ or ‘Tennyson’ is but a corruption of ‘Dennison,’ as also\r\n‘Tyson’ of ‘Dyson.’ That they are patronymics of Antony (Tony) is the\r\nonly alternative, and this I fear is unsatisfactory. Mabel, although now\r\nsomewhat out of fashion, was very popular four hundred years ago as\r\n‘Amabilla,’ hence such entries as ‘Amabella la Blund,’ or ‘Amabil fil.\r\nEmme.’ The surnames descended from it are sufficiently numerous to\r\ntestify to this. Besides ‘Mabell’ simple, we have ‘Mabson,’ ‘Mabbs,’\r\n‘Mabbes,’ ‘Mabbott,’ and perhaps ‘Mapleson.’[58] Catharine, always\r\ncalled ‘Catlin’ in the North, reminding us of the Irish ‘Kathleen,’ is\r\nthe source of several surnames. Entries like ‘Eleonore Catlynson’ (W.\r\n12) or ‘Thomas Katlynson’ (W. 11) are common, and the shorter ‘Cattlin’\r\nis found in every Yorkshire roll.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain quaint prettiness about ‘Hilary,’ ‘Lettice,’ and\r\n‘Joyce,’ three acceptable cognomens in mediæval times. The Normans liked\r\ntheir women to be, however modest, none the less lighthearted, gay, and\r\nspirited, and in the synonyms of ‘mirth,’ ‘gladness,’ and\r\n‘sportiveness,’ they would delight in affixing on their newly-born\r\nchildren that which they hoped would be in the future but the index of\r\nthe real character. ‘Hillary’ when not local is therefore but the fuller\r\n‘Hilaria.’ ‘Joyce,’ sometimes the result of the mere nickname, is\r\nnothing more than ‘Jocosa,’ and ‘Lettice,’ ‘Letts,’ and ‘Letson’ are\r\nsufficiently numerous to preserve the memory of ‘Lætitia.’ Thus, in one\r\nof the Coventry Mysteries already alluded to, mention is made of\r\n\r\n                 Col Crane and Davy Dry-dust,\r\n                 Lucy Lyer and Letyce Lytyl-trust,\r\n                 Miles the Miller and Colle Crake-crust.\r\n\r\n‘Letson’ is met in the fourteenth century as ‘Fitz-Lettice.’\r\n‘Theophania’ was anything but unpopular, but its length made it\r\nunavoidable but that it should be mutilated, or at least put in an\r\nabbreviated or nickname form, and thus it is has arisen our ‘Tiffany,’\r\nwhence of course the surname of to-day. Thus, in the Coventry Mysteries,\r\nit is demanded that\r\n\r\n               Both Bonting the Brewster and Sybyl Slynge,\r\n               Megge Mery-wedyr, and Sabyn[59] Sprynge,\r\n               Tiffany Twynkeler fayle for no thynge.\r\n\r\nThierry in his history of the ‘Conquest of England’ quotes an old\r\nwriter, who has preserved the following lines of a decidedly doggrel\r\ncharacter:—\r\n\r\n                        William de Cognisby\r\n                        Came out of Brittany\r\n                        With his wife Tiffany,\r\n                        And his maid Manfras,\r\n                        And his dogge Hardigras.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to mention ‘Eleanor,’ or ‘Alianora,’ as it is more\r\nfrequently registered, a name of suffering royalty, and therefore to a\r\nportion of the English people, at least, a popular name. Its forms are\r\ntoo many for enumeration, but ‘Alianor,’ ‘Annora,’ ‘Annot,’ ‘Alinot,’\r\n‘Leonora,’ ‘Eleanor,’ ‘Elinor,’ ‘Ellen,’ ‘Lina,’ ‘Linot,’ and ‘Nel’ were\r\nthe most common. All of these were either surnames themselves, or became\r\nthe roots of surnames. Thus we find among other entries such\r\nregistrations as ‘Alicia Alianor,’ ‘Alianor Busche,’ ‘Annora Widow,’\r\n‘Annora de Aencurt,’ ‘Anota Canun,’ ‘John Annotson,’ ‘William\r\nAnnotyson,’ ‘Hugh fil. Elyenore,’ ‘William Alinot,’ ‘Alnot Red,’ ‘Lyna\r\nle Archer,’ ‘Linota ate Field,’ or ‘Linota Vidua.’ This list will\r\nsuffice to prove the place occupied by ‘Eleanor.’ I have not mentioned\r\nsuch entries as ‘John fil. Nel’ or ‘Elisha Annyson,’ or ‘Richard\r\nAnyson,’ for though in these particular instances we see the origin of\r\nsome of our ‘Ansons’ and ‘Nelsons,’ both are more generally referable to\r\na different source. ‘Neal’ or ‘Neile’ was very common in this day, and\r\n‘Neilson’ would easily be corrupted into ‘Nelson.’\r\n\r\n‘Julian,’ the abbreviated form of ‘Juliana,’ as a Norman-introduced name\r\nbecame very popular, and its after history was a very curious one. Such\r\nappellations as ‘Gillian Cook,’ or ‘Gilian of the Mill,’ found in the\r\nHundred Rolls, or that of the well-known ‘Dame Julyan Berners,’ whose\r\nwork on household management I shall have occasion to quote by-and-by,\r\nonly represent in fuller forms the ‘Gill’ or ‘Jill’ who is so renowned\r\nin our nursery literature as having met with such a dire disaster in the\r\ndutiful endeavour ‘to fetch a pail of water’ from the hill-side. I have\r\nalready mentioned ‘Cocke Lorell’s Bote,’ where allusion is made to\r\n\r\n                  Jelyan Joly at signe of the Bokeler.\r\n\r\nThe shorter and curter form is given us in Heywood’s Epigrams, where the\r\nfollowing marital dialogue occurs:—\r\n\r\n            I am care-full to see thee carelesse, Jylle:\r\n            I am wofull to see thee wytlesse, Wyll:\r\n            I am anguisht to see thee an ape, Jyll:\r\n            I am angry to see thee an asse, Wyll:\r\n            I am dumpyshe to see thee play the drabbe, Jyll:\r\n            I am knappyshe to see thee plaie the knave, Wyll.\r\n\r\nBut ‘Gill’ at some time or other got into evil odour, and this brought\r\nthe name into all but absolute disuse. As a term for a wanton flirt or\r\ninconstant girl, it was familiarly used till the eighteenth century. It\r\nwould seem as if the poet I have just quoted were referring to this\r\ncharacteristic when he writes:—\r\n\r\n                All shall be well, Jacke shall have Gill;\r\n                Nay, nay, Gill is wedded to Wyll;[60]\r\n\r\nor where in another place he says:—\r\n\r\n         How may I have thee, Gill, when I wish for thee?\r\n         Wish not for me Jack, but when thou mayest have me.[61]\r\n\r\nThe diminutive ‘Gilot’ or ‘Juliet’ is used in the same way. In an old\r\nmetrical sermon it is said—\r\n\r\n                       Robin will Gilot\r\n                         Leden to the nale,\r\n                       And sitten there togedres,\r\n                         And tellen their tale.\r\n\r\nThis at once reminds us of the origin of our ‘jilt,’ which is nothing\r\nmore than a relic of the name for inconstancy the sobriquet had\r\nobtained. In our ‘Gills,’ ‘Gilsons,’ and many of our ‘Gillots,’ a\r\nfurther remembrance is likely to remain for all time.[62] Such names as\r\nthese, however, offer no kind of comparison with that of ‘Margaret.’\r\nThis is the only rival that ‘Gillian’ had to fear, and had the\r\nmisfortunes of Margaret of Anjou occurred two, or even one century\r\nearlier, it would easily have taken precedence, so far as our surnames\r\nare concerned. Apart from its being found in several royal lines, it had\r\nthe advantage of undoubted prettiness both in sound and sense. Every\r\none, too, knew its meaning, for ‘margarite’ and ‘pearl’ then, and until\r\nthe seventeenth century even, were interchangeable terms. Every early\r\nwriter so uses it. ‘Casting pearls before swine’ is with Wickliffe\r\n‘margaritis.’[63] The pet names too were pretty, important in a day when\r\nthe full name was rarely if ever used.[64] The Norman-French ‘Margot’\r\nseems to have been quite as familiar as ‘Marjorie.’ Thus the homely\r\n‘magpie’ was at first styled the ‘maggoty’ or ‘magot-pie.’ Many will\r\nremember that Macbeth so uses it—\r\n\r\n                             Blood will have blood:\r\n           Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak,\r\n           Augurs and understood relations have\r\n           By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth\r\n           The secretest man of blood.—ii. 7.\r\n\r\n‘Madge-owlet,’ too, from its occasional use by writers of this later\r\nperiod, seems to prove that the still more homely owl of the barn owed\r\nan appellation to Dame Marjorie. Her issue, as we should expect, is\r\nlarge. We have ‘Maggs,’ ‘Maggots,’ and ‘Magotson;’ ‘Margots,’\r\n‘Margetts,’ and ‘Margetson;’ ‘Margison,’ ‘Margerison,’ ‘Meggs,’ and\r\n‘Megson.’[65] It will be surprising to many that we cannot place ‘Mary’\r\nin the first place among female names, as it is now among those of\r\neither sex, but such was far from the case. Edward I.’s daughter ‘Marie’\r\nseems to have been the first instance we possess of its use among the\r\nhigher families of the realm; and doubtless its presence at this time\r\nmust be referred, as in so many other cases we have mentioned, to the\r\nCrusades. Mariolatry, we must remember, was not yet an article of Romish\r\nbelief. Indeed, the name is still of the rarest for generations after\r\nthis. Maid Marion, the mistress of Robin Hood, seems to have made that\r\ndiminutive popular, and either from the acted plays in which she\r\nfrequently afterwards figured, or the little ornamental image of the\r\nVirgin worn by women, is come our _marionette_. The one only form in\r\nwhich it can be said to occur in our English records is that of\r\n‘Mariot,’ such names as ‘Mariot Goscelyn,’ or ‘Mariota Giffard,’ or\r\n‘Mariota Gosebeck,’ being found as a very occasional registry. Thus our\r\n‘Mariotts’ and ‘Maryatts’ are explained. With regard to another batch of\r\nnames said to have sprung from this, I find a difficulty sets in. We\r\nhave the clear statement of the author of the ‘Promptorium Parvulorum’\r\nthat ‘Malkyne’ in his day was the sobriquet of Matilda, that is,\r\n‘Mawdkin.’ On the other hand, I find Halliwell has a single quotation\r\nfrom a manuscript in which Maid Marion is styled Malkyn also.[66] All\r\nmodern writers, saving Mr. Lower, who has come to no decision at all,\r\nhave comfortably put it down to this latter. I have no hesitation\r\nwhatever myself in deciding differently, or at least in qualifying their\r\nconclusion. There can be scarcely any doubt, I think, that Malkin was\r\noriginally the pet name of Matilda; then, as that favourite name\r\ngradually sunk in estimation, and Mary proportionately advanced, but\r\nthis much later on, it was transferred. Thus, if I am correct, our\r\n‘Makinsons’ and ‘Makins,’[67] our ‘Meakins’ and ‘Meekins,’ and our\r\n‘Mawsons’[68] will be sprung from Maud, rather than Mary. In\r\nconfirmation of this, I may quote ‘Malkin,’ the early cant term for a\r\n‘slut,’ a word as old as Chaucer himself, and one that Mary could not\r\nhave possibly acquired in his day, as barely familiar. ‘Mawdkin’ or\r\n‘Malkin,’ on the other hand, would be the ordinary term for every\r\nhousehold drudge. It is only those who have carefully studied early\r\nregisters who can realize the difference of position ‘Matilda’ and\r\n‘Mary’ relatively occupy at such a period as this. There were six\r\n‘Matildas’ of royal lineage between William I. and Henry II. alone. It\r\ngreets one at every turn; the present popularity of the latter is\r\nentirely the growth of a later and more superstitious age.[69]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mary, we must not forget Elizabeth, known, generations ere\r\nQueen Bess made it so popular, as Isabella. It was in this form it came\r\ninto England with that princess of Angoulême who married John Lackland.\r\nBut it was not a favourite; pretty as it was, its connexion with our\r\nmost despicable monarch spoiled all chance of popularity, and while on\r\nthe Continent it gained friends on every hand, it was only with the\r\nhigher nobility of our own land it got any place worth speaking of.\r\nStill it has left its mark. As Elizabeth[70] at a later stage became\r\n‘Lib’ and ‘Libby,’ so Isabel was fondled into ‘Ib’ and ‘Ibby.’ Thus we\r\ncome across such entries as ‘Henry Ebison,’ ‘Thomas Ibson,’ or ‘John\r\nIbson.’ But a foreign name without the foreign desinence would be\r\nimpossible. With the introduction of Isabel came in the diminutive\r\n‘Ibbot’ or ‘Ibbet.’ Registrations like ‘Ibbota fil. Adam,’ ‘Ibote\r\nBabyngton,’ or ‘Ebote Gylle,’ and as surnames ‘Walter Ibbot,’ ‘Robert\r\nfil. Ibote,’ ‘Francis Ibbitson,’ or ‘Alice Ebotson’ are of common\r\noccurrence.[71] Another form of the same diminutive was ‘Isot,’ hence\r\n‘Isotte Symes,’ ‘Izott Barn,’ or ‘Ezota Hall.’[72] But even with this we\r\nhave not completed our list. One more pet form, and one still common\r\namongst us, that of ‘Bell,’ left its mark in ‘Bellot,’ ‘Bellet,’ and\r\n‘Bellson,’ all of which are still to be found in our directories.\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages will be sufficient proof that our metronymics are a\r\nconsiderable class. Many have not hesitated to affirm them to be wholly\r\nof illegitimate descent. We cannot doubt that in some instances this is\r\nthe case. Nevertheless, we must not be led astray. ‘Polson’ is Paul’s\r\nson, ‘Nelson’ is Neil’s son, Neil or Nigel being at one time a familiar\r\nname with us. And even when the name is unquestionably feminine, as in\r\nMollison, Margerison, Marriot, Emmett, or Annotson, illegitimacy is\r\nanything but established as a matter of fact. Adoption of children by\r\nwomen, posthumous birth, and other peculiar circumstances would often\r\ncause a boy or girl to be known in the community by a metronymic.\r\nEspecially, too, would a child be thus styled in a family where the\r\nmother was notoriously, and in an emphatic sense, the better half, in a\r\nfamily where the husband was content to sit in the chimney nook, and let\r\nthe bustling Margery, or Siss, or Emmot take, whether in or out of\r\ndoors, the lead in all that concerned the domestic relationship. Thus, I\r\ndoubt not, a large mass of them have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n               VII.—_Names Derived from Holy Scripture._\r\n\r\nWe have incidentally referred to several Bible names, such as John,\r\nMary, or Elizabeth. We shall find a certain characteristic appertaining\r\nto these. It is only those personages who prominently figured in the\r\nScripture narrative who made any mark upon our nomenclature. The others,\r\nI doubt not, were unknown. It is even uncertain whether the clergy\r\nthemselves had any but the faintest knowledge of the Bible. Indeed, such\r\nnames even as were in use bear no testimony to the fact that they were\r\ngiven as the direct result of familiarity with the sacred pages. If from\r\nthe New Testament, they were names that figured in the calendar as\r\nsaints and martyrs, names to whom shrines and chapels had been\r\ndedicated. If from the Old, they were just those like ‘Adam,’ or\r\n‘Isaac,’ or ‘Joseph,’ or ‘Samson,’ or ‘Daniel,’ or ‘Absolom,’ whose\r\nstories, told in the monkish performances or miracle-plays, were thus\r\nforced into the acquaintance of the popular mind. In a word, there is\r\nnot a trace of anything beyond a mere superficial knowledge of the very\r\noutlines of the sacred narrative. Thus was it with ‘Adam,’ already\r\nmentioned. That he and Eve should be remembered at the font was\r\ninevitable. The Hundred Rolls give us an ‘Adam fil. Eve.’ Mr. Lower has\r\nbeen tempted to refer our ‘Atkins’ and ‘Atkinsons’ to Arthur, but there\r\ncan be little doubt, I imagine, that these are but sharper forms of\r\n‘Adkins’ and ‘Adkinson.’ The record alluded to above registers the same\r\nperson twice as ‘Adam le Fullere’ and ‘Adekin le Fuller.’ With them\r\ntherefore we must ally our ‘Addisons,’ ‘Adcocks,’[73] and ‘Adamsons.’\r\nEve left us ‘Eveson’ as a metronymic, and ‘Evetts’ and ‘Evitts,’ as the\r\ndiminutives, are firmly set amongst us.[74] ‘Abel’ was equally popular.\r\nThe Norman desinence is found in such entries as ‘Abalotta de la Forde,’\r\nor Richard Abelot, whose descendants now figure as ‘Ablett’ and\r\n‘Ablott.’ As will be seen, these may be feminine in origin. The\r\nreverence of the despised Jew for Abraham prevented this from becoming\r\nacceptable to Christians, but Isaac’s sacrifice was too popular a story\r\nnot to leave an impression. It would be frequently represented by the\r\nmonks. I have already quoted Langland where he speaks of\r\n\r\n                          Hikke the hackney-man\r\n                          And Hugh the nedlere—\r\n\r\nan abbreviation now more generally known and spelt as ‘Ike.’ Gower also\r\nhas it—\r\n\r\n        _Watte_ vocat, cui _Thoma_ venit, neque _Symme_ retardat,\r\n          _Bat_-que _Gibbe_ simul, _Hykke_ venire jubent.\r\n\r\nFrom him then have arisen our ‘Isaacs’ and ‘Isaacsons,’ our ‘Hicks’ and\r\n‘Hicksons,’ our ‘Higgs’ and ‘Higsons,’ and with the Norman-French\r\ndiminutives appended, our ‘Higgins,’ ‘Higginsons,’ ‘Higgotts,’[75] and\r\n‘Higgetts.’ ‘Sarah,’ in the dress of ‘Sarra,’ had a fair number of\r\nadmirers. ‘Sarra le Commongere,’ ‘William fil. Sarra,’ ‘Nicholas fil.\r\nSarre,’ is the usual entry. The origin of our ‘Sarsons’ would thus be\r\ncertain, were it not that this name, as will be shown elsewhere, has got\r\nconfused with ‘Saracen.’ Moses also failed to be accepted among\r\nChristians, nor was Aaron much more fortunate, such registration as\r\n‘Aaron le Blund’ or ‘Aron Judde’ being rare. ‘Samson’ or ‘Sampson,’ as\r\nit is more generally recorded, was of course popular enough, and many of\r\nour ‘Sampsons’ are rather the simple ‘Samson’ than the patronymic of\r\n‘Samuel.’ ‘Samms,’ ‘Samuels’ and ‘Samuelson’ are generally of Jewish\r\ndescent. ‘David,’ with its ‘Davies,’ its ‘Davidsons,’ its ‘Dawes’ and\r\n‘Dawsons,’ its ‘Dawkes’ and ‘Dawkins,’ or ‘Dawkinsons,’ its ‘Dayes,’\r\n‘Daysons,’ and ‘Dakins’ (when not ‘Deakin’), would be equally sure of\r\nremembrance; though doubtless, as the patron saint of the Principality,\r\nand as a favourite among Scottish kings, it owes much to these outer\r\nchances. Here, too, we are reminded of Piers Plowman, with his—\r\n\r\n                           Dawe the dykere\r\n                           And a dozen othere.\r\n\r\nThis nickname seems to have had a long reign in the popular mouth, for\r\nwe find, towards the close of the sixteenth century, Haywood writing the\r\nfollowing epigram:—\r\n\r\n          To a justice a juggler did complaine,\r\n          Of one that dispraised his legerdemain.\r\n          What’s thy name? sayd the Justice: Dawson, sayd hee:\r\n          Is thy father alive? Nay, dead, sir, pardee:\r\n          Then thou shalt no more be Dau’s son, a clere case,\r\n          Thou art Daw thyself now in thy father’s place.[76]\r\n\r\nPassing by ‘Absolom,’ ‘Solomon,’ or ‘Salamon,’ ‘Job’ and ‘Jobson,’ the\r\nstory of Daniel would of course be common. This has bequeathed us itself\r\nin _propria persona_, and ‘Dancock,’ ‘Dankin,’ ‘Danett,’ and ‘Dannett.’\r\nWith regard to ‘Dans,’ ‘Dance,’ ‘Danse,’ and ‘Danson,’ there is a little\r\ndifficulty. We have to remember that ‘Dan,’ like ‘Dame,’[77] figured\r\nprominently in early days as a simple title of respect. They were but\r\nthe ‘Don’ and ‘Donna’ which, in one form or another, still exist in\r\nItaly, France, and Spain. ‘Dame,’ from domina, meant ‘mistress.’ ‘Don,’\r\nfrom dominus, meant ‘master.’ To rank and age the two terms were equally\r\napplied. A ‘dame’s school’ still preserves this connexion of ideas. ‘As\r\nwith the mistress so with the maid,’ is in early Bibles ‘As with the\r\ndame so with the maid.’ Thus there seems to be little doubt that our\r\n‘Dames’ and ‘Damsons’ are so sprung. Why then should not ‘Dans’ and\r\n‘Danse’ and ‘Danson’ be the masculine form? Chaucer, in his Canterbury\r\nTales, represents the host as asking the Monk—\r\n\r\n               But, by my trothe, I cannot tell your name:\r\n               Whether shall I call you my lord Dan John,\r\n               Or Dan Thomas, or elles Dan Albon?\r\n\r\nThus he speaks also of ‘Dan Constantine,’ and jestingly of the ass as\r\n‘Dan Burnell.’ Thus, Lord Surrey in one of his poems speaks of ‘Dan\r\nHomer;’ Spenser of ‘Dan Geoffrey;’ Thomson of ‘Dan Abraham.’ The best\r\nway will be, as in many another case, to divide the honours between the\r\ntwo; and leaving it thus undecided, I pass on.\r\n\r\nNor is the New Testament without its instances. Let us look at the\r\nApostles first. We have already spoken at some length about ‘John,’ but\r\nwe purposely kept for the present opportunity the explanation of its\r\npopularity in England. There can be little doubt that it owes much to\r\nits religious aspect. It was the name not merely of the beloved\r\ndisciple, but of the Baptist. New and close associations with the latter\r\nwere just coming into being. We must remember this was the time of the\r\nCrusades. It was the custom of all pilgrims who visited the Holy Land to\r\nbring back a bottle of water from the Jordan for baptismal purposes. A\r\nleathern bottle was an inseparable adjunct to the palmer’s dress. We all\r\nremember Walter Scott’s description—\r\n\r\n                 His sandals were with travel tore,\r\n                 Staff, budget, _bottle_, scrip he wore:\r\n                 The faded palm-branch in his hand\r\n                 Showed pilgrim from the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nEarly scenes with regard to the river in which the Baptist specially\r\nfigured would thus be vividly brought to their notice, and in the\r\nceremony of baptism at home nothing could be more natural than to give\r\nto the infant the name of the baptizer of the Holy Child Jesus. This is\r\nstrongly confirmed by the fact of the name taking precedence at this\r\nvery period. It was thus ‘Jordan’ itself as a surname has arisen. I need\r\nnot remind students of early records how common is ‘Jordan’ as a\r\nChristian name, such cognomens as ‘Jordan de Abingdon’ or ‘Jordan le\r\nClerc’ being of the most familiar occurrence. The baptismal soon became\r\nsurnominal, and now ‘Jordan,’[78] ‘Jordanson,’ ‘Jordson,’ ‘Jurdan,’\r\n‘Judd,’ and ‘Judson’[79] are with us to remind us of this peculiar and\r\ninteresting epoch.[80] We have a remarkable confirmation of what I am\r\nasserting in the fact of the Baptist’s other name of ‘Elias’ springing\r\ninto a sudden notoriety at this time. If ‘John’ became thus so popular,\r\nit was inevitable ‘Elias’ should be the same; and so it was. Indeed,\r\nthere was a time when it bid fair to be one of the most familiar\r\nsobriquets in England. For it was not merely the second Elias and the\r\nJordan that had this effect. As the armies lay before Acre, remembrance\r\nof Elijah and the prophet of Carmel must have oft recurred to their\r\nminds. Out of many forms to be found in every early roll, those of\r\n‘Ellis,’ ‘Elys,’ ‘Elice,’ ‘Ellice,’ ‘Elyas,’ ‘Helyas,’ and the\r\ndiminutive ‘Eliot’ or ‘Elliot,’ seem to have been the most familiar.\r\nNumberless are the surnames sprung from it. It is thus we get our\r\n‘Ellises’ and ‘Ellices,’ our ‘Ellsons’ and ‘Ellisons,’ our ‘Elkins’ and\r\n‘Elkinsons,’ our ‘Elcocks’ and ‘Ellcocks,’ and our ‘Ellicots,’[81]\r\n‘Elliots,’ and ‘Elliotsons.’ In the north ‘Alis’ seems to have gained\r\nthe supremacy. Thus it is we have our many ‘Allisons’ or ‘Alisons,’[82]\r\n‘Allkins’ or ‘Alkins,’ ‘Allcocks’ or ‘Alcocks,’ and ‘Allots.’ ‘Alecot,’\r\nas a synonym with ‘Elicot,’ I do not find to be at present existing, but\r\nas a Christian name it occurs at the same period with the above.[83]\r\n‘Fitzellis,’ as the more aristocratic Norman form, is not yet, I\r\nbelieve, extinct. Thus the prophet at Carmel and the forerunner at the\r\nJordan have made their mark upon our English nomenclature.\r\n\r\nPeter claims our attention next. When we consider how important has been\r\nthe position claimed for him it is remarkable that in an age when, so\r\nfar as England was concerned, this respect was more fully exacted than\r\nany other, his name should be so rarely found, rarely when we reflect\r\nwhat an influence the ecclesiastics of the day themselves must have had\r\nin the choice of the baptismal name, and what an interest they had in\r\nmaking it popular. It is to them, doubtless, we must refer the fact of\r\nits having made any mark at all, for ‘Peter’ was odious to English ears.\r\nIt reminded them of a tax which was the one of all least liked, as they\r\nsaw none of its fruits. It is to country records we must look for the\r\n‘Peters’ of the time. The freer towns would none of it. Among the rude\r\npeasantry ecclesiastic control was well-nigh absolute; in the boroughs\r\nit was proportionately less. I have already quoted an instance of 133\r\nLondon names where Peter is discovered but once to 35 Johns. In the\r\nNorwich Guild already mentioned, the proportion, or rather\r\ndisproportion, is the same. To 128 Johns, 47 Williams, 41 Thomases, 33\r\nRoberts, and 21 Richards, there are but 4 Peters. On the other hand, in\r\nWiltshire, out of 588 names, we find 16 Peters to 92 Johns. This wide\r\ndifference of ratio I find to be fully borne out in all other groups of\r\nearly names. Thanks then to the ecclesiastics it did exist, and its\r\nrelics at any rate are numerous enough. It is hence we get the shorter\r\n‘Parr,’ ‘Piers,’ ‘Pierce,’ ‘Pears,’ ‘Pearse,’ and ‘Peers.’ It is hence\r\nwith the patronymic added we get our ‘Parsons,’ ‘Pearsons,’ ‘Piersons,’\r\nand the fuller ‘Peterson.’ It is hence once more with the pet desinences\r\nattached we get our ‘Perrins’ and ‘Perrens,’ our ‘Perrets,’ ‘Perretts,’\r\n‘Parrots,’ and ‘Parrets,’[84] our ‘Peterkins,’ ‘Perkins,’ ‘Parkins,’ and\r\n‘Parkinsons,’ besides our ‘Perks’ and ‘Perkes’ innumerable.\r\n\r\n‘Simon,’ or ‘Simeon,’ is represented by at least sixteen different\r\npersonages in the Scriptures, so we may well expect to find that it has\r\nalso impressed itself upon our own registers. The usual forms of the\r\nname in mediæval rolls is ‘Sim,’ ‘Simkin,’ and ‘Simonet.’ Thus we find\r\nsuch entries as ‘Simon fil. Sim,’ ‘Simkin Cock,’ ‘Symkyn Edward,’\r\n‘Simonettus Mercator,’ or ‘Symonet Vaillain.’ The French diminutive does\r\nnot seem to have been so popular as that which the Flemings made so\r\ncommon, for I find no ‘Simnets’ in our directories, while a whole column\r\nhas to be set aside for our ‘Simpkins’ and ‘Simpkinsons.’ ‘Simcock’ must\r\nhave existed also, as our ‘Simcocks’ and ‘Simcoxes’ can testify. Other\r\nforms are found in ‘Sims,’ ‘Simms,’ ‘Simpson,’ ‘Simmons,’ ‘Simonds,’\r\n‘Symonds,’ ‘Simmonds,’ and ‘Symondsons.’ This latter is met with in the\r\nRolls of Parliament in the guise of ‘Symondesson.’ ‘Philip,’ as another\r\nof the Apostles of Jesus, was also popular. As with ‘Simon,’ most of the\r\nnursery forms are still found as the chief components of its surnames.\r\nSkelton, the poet-laureate—in lieu of a better—of Henry VIII., reminds\r\nus of its chief contraction, ‘Philp,’ or ‘Phip,’ in his lines on a dead\r\nsparrow, named Philip:—\r\n\r\n                    Many times and oft,\r\n                    Upon my finger aloft,\r\n                    I played with him, tittle-tattle,\r\n                    And fed him with my spattle,\r\n                    With his bill between my lips.\r\n                    It was my pretty Phips.\r\n\r\nThus we derive our ‘Phelps,’ ‘Philps,’ ‘Phipps,’ and ‘Phipson.’ Adding\r\nto these our ‘Philips,’ ‘Philipsons,’ ‘Philcoxes,’ ‘Philpotts,’ and\r\n‘Phillots,’ we see that we are not likely soon to be quit of Philip. He\r\nis now, however, out of fashion as a Christian name. ‘Philpot,’[85] I\r\nneed scarcely say, was very popular as the representative of the\r\nNorman-French ‘Philipot,’ found in such entries as ‘Thomas Phylypotte,’\r\nor ‘John Philipot;’ but endeavours to deduce his origin as well in\r\nspelling as in sound from the characteristics displayed by the renowned\r\nToby Phillpot are not wanting, for I see him figuring in the ‘London\r\nDirectory’ as ‘Fillpot.’ Archbishop Trench quotes from one of Careless’s\r\nletters to Philpot the following passage, which serves to show that\r\nthree hundred years ago at least the name had been played upon in\r\nsimilar fashion: ‘Oh, good Master Philpot (he says), which art a\r\nprincipal _pot_ indeed, _filled_ with much precious liquor—oh, pot most\r\nhappy! of the High Potter ordained to honour.’ Some years ago, when a\r\nPhilpott was appointed to the episcopal chair of Worcester, Dr.\r\nPhilpotts being yet at Exeter, the following lines got abroad:—\r\n\r\n                ‘A good appointment?’ ‘No, it’s not,’\r\n                  Said old beer-drinking Peter Watts;\r\n                ‘At Worcester one but hears “Phil-pott;”\r\n                  At generous Exeter, “Phil-potts.”’\r\n\r\n‘Fillpot’ as well as ‘Fillip’ are both found in mediæval registers in\r\nthe cases of ‘Roger Fylpot’ and ‘Walter Felip.’ An old song, quoted in\r\n‘Political Poems’ (i. 60), says of the defeated soldiers at Halidon\r\nHill:—\r\n\r\n                  On Filip Valas fast cri they,\r\n                  There for to dwell, and him avaunce.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Fillpots’ of our present directories may therefore have thus spelt\r\ntheir names for four or five hundred years. Anyhow they have precedent\r\nfor the form.\r\n\r\n‘Matthew the Publican’ seems to have been a favourite alike in England\r\nand France. ‘Matt’ was the homely appellative, and thus besides\r\n‘Mathews’ and ‘Mathewson,’ we meet with ‘Matts,’ ‘Matson,’ ‘Mattison,’\r\nand ‘Mattinson.’ Our ‘Mayhews’ represent the foreign dress, and can\r\nrefer their origin to such personages as ‘Adam fil. Maheu,’ or ‘Mayeu de\r\nBasingbourne.’ ‘Bartholomew,’ for what reason I can scarcely say, was a\r\nprime favourite with our forefathers, and has left innumerable proofs of\r\nthe same. ‘Batt’ or ‘Bett’ seems to have been the favourite curtailment.\r\nThe author of ‘Piers Plowman’ speaks of ‘Bette the Bocher’ (Butcher),\r\n‘Bette the Bedel,’ and makes Reason bid\r\n\r\n                                  Bette kutte\r\n                        A bough outher tweye,\r\n                        And bete Beton therewith.\r\n\r\n‘Batty,’ ‘Bates,’ ‘Batson,’ ‘Batcock,’ ‘Badcock,’ ‘Batkins,’ ‘Badkins,’\r\n‘Betson,’ ‘Bedson,’ and ‘Betty’ are relics of this. ‘Bartle,’ and the\r\nNorman-French ‘Bartelot,’ found in such entries as ‘Bartel Frobisher,’\r\n‘John fil. Bertol,’ ‘Bartelot Govi,’ or ‘Edward Barttlette,’ at once\r\nbespeak the origin of our ‘Bartles’ and ‘Bartletts.’[86] Nor was this\r\nall. Another favourite sobriquet for this same name was ‘Toly’ or\r\n‘Tholy,’ hence such registrations as ‘Tholy Oldcorn,’ or ‘Robert Toly,’\r\nor ‘William fil. Tholy.’ Our ‘Tolleys,’ ‘Tollys’ and ‘Tolsons’[87] are\r\nthus explained. None of these could have been the offspring of any old\r\n‘Ladye Betty,’ as Mr. Lower seems to imagine, since that name, as I have\r\nshown, did not exist in England at this time, nor in fact can it be said\r\nto have been known till rendered fashionable by Elizabeth Woodville, the\r\nbride of Edward IV. What an influence a single individual may wield over\r\nour personal nomenclature may be thus seen, when we remember the\r\nenormous preponderance of this latter name during the two centuries that\r\nfollowed the reign of the imperious but ‘good Queen Bess,’ and the\r\nglorious scattering of the Spanish Armada. This, too, escaping the\r\nwithering influences of the Puritan era, continued through all, and now\r\nholds the fourth place in English esteem.\r\n\r\nIn the poem I have just quoted, Reason\r\n\r\n                       Called Caton his knave\r\n                       Curteis of speche,\r\n                       And also Tomme Trewe-tonge.\r\n\r\nThus we see that ‘Tom,’ as the popular form of ‘Thomas,’ has been in\r\nvogue for many centuries. ‘Thomas,’ like some of the above names,\r\nreceived an increased impulse from the Crusades. But another\r\ncircumstance also befriended it. In its numerous progeny may be read\r\nagain the story of the feud that arose between the haughty Archbishop\r\nand Henry II., a feud that terminated so fatally for the former, and\r\nmade the spot where he fell hallowed for centuries by the pilgrimages of\r\nshrine-worshippers. Piers, in Langland’s poem, says,\r\n\r\n                        I nolde fange a ferthyng\r\n                        For seint Thomas shryne.\r\n\r\nThe surnames whose origin we must undoubtedly attribute, in the majority\r\nof cases, to the notoriety given to the sobriquet possessed by this\r\nmurdered prelate are many. The patronymic is clearly marked in our\r\n‘Thomasons,’ ‘Thomsons,’ and ‘Thompsons.’ The favoured Norman diminutive\r\nis equally assured of perpetuation in our ‘Thomasetts,’ ‘Thomsetts,’ and\r\n‘Thompsetts;’ the Saxon being as fully popularised in our ‘Thompkins,’\r\n‘Tompkins,’ ‘Tomkins,’ and ‘Tomkinsons.’ The softer termination is also\r\nfirmly settled in our ‘Thomlins,’ ‘Tomlins,’ and ‘Tomlinsons.’[88] More\r\nabbreviated patronymics are to be met with also in our ‘Thomms,’\r\n‘Thoms,’ and ‘Toms.’ With so many representatives in the list of\r\nrational beings, we need not be surprised to find the lower order of\r\ncreation under obligations to this title. It was with the death of St.\r\nThomas of Canterbury, and the consequent popularity of his name, arose\r\nso many sobriquets of which the same name became a component part. The\r\ncat became a ‘tom-cat,’ a simple-natured man a ‘tom-coney,’ a silly\r\nfellow a ‘tom-noddy’ or ‘tom-fool,’ a romping girl a ‘tom-boy,’ and a\r\nwren a ‘tom-tit.’ Andrew has made little impression on English\r\nnomenclature, but in Scotland he is universal,[89] for not only is St.\r\nAndrew the patron saint, but some of his relics are said to have been\r\nbrought thither in the 4th century. ‘Andrew,’ ‘Andrews,’ and ‘Anderson’\r\nare its surnames, but nearly all belong to the north side of the Tweed.\r\n‘James,’ too, has failed to be popular in England, but ‘John’ in the\r\nshape of ‘Jack’ has robbed him, as we have seen, of nearly all his\r\nproperty. Such entries as ‘James le Queynt,’ or ‘Ralph Jamson,’ or\r\n‘William Gimmison,’ were occasionally registered, and in the form of\r\n‘James’ ‘Jameson,’ ‘Jimson’ and ‘Jimpson’ they still exist.[90]\r\n‘Jamieson’ is Scotch. Of the Gospel writers we have already noticed\r\n‘Matthew’ and ‘John.’ In ‘Mark’ we see the progenitor not merely of our\r\n‘Marks’ and the Latinized ‘Marcus,’ but of ‘Marcock,’ ‘Markin,’ and\r\n‘Marson’ also. The mention of ‘Luke’ recalls such names as ‘Luckins,’\r\n‘Luckock,’ ‘Lucock,’ or ‘Locock,’ ‘Luckett,’ and perchance ‘Lockett.’ It\r\nis in the form of ‘Lucus,’ however, that he is generally known. The\r\nauthor of ‘Piers Plowman’ speaks of ‘Marc,’ ‘Mathew,’ ‘Johan,’ and\r\n‘Lucas.’\r\n\r\nOf the later period of New Testament history, few names were better\r\nrepresented than ‘Nicholas,’ but it was ‘St. Nicholas’ of the fourth\r\ncentury who chiefly gave it its position. Owing to several well-known\r\nlegends that connected themselves with this famous Archbishop of Myra,\r\nhe became the patron saint of boys, sailors, parish clerks, and even\r\nthieves. Two of the most favoured curtailments of this name were ‘Nicol’\r\nand ‘Nick.’ From the one we have derived our ‘Nicholls’ and\r\n‘Nicholsons;’ from the other our ‘Nixs,’ ‘Nicks,’ ‘Nixons,’ ‘Nicksons,’\r\nand ‘Nickersons.’ Judging from our surnames, ‘Nick’ was the more\r\nfavoured term. In the old song ‘Joan to the Maypole,’ it is said:\r\n\r\n                    Nan, Noll, Kate, Moll,\r\n                Brave lasses have lads to attend ’em;\r\n                    Hodge, Nick, Tom, Dick,\r\n                Brave country dancers, who can amend ’em?\r\n\r\nBut the most popular form of all was that of ‘Cole’[91] or ‘Colin,’\r\nwhich came to us through the Normans. ‘Colin’ is one more instance of\r\nthe diminutive ‘on’ or ‘in.’ Thus we derive our ‘Collins,’ ‘Collinsons,’\r\nand ‘Colsons.’ The more usual desinence still lives in our ‘Colletts’\r\nand ‘Colets.’ This is the form found in one of the ‘Coventry Mysteries,’\r\nwhere allusion is made to\r\n\r\n                     Kytt Cakeler, and Colett Crane,\r\n                     Gylle Fetyse, and Fayr Jane.\r\n\r\nMiss Yonge mentions a ‘Collette Boilet’ who, in the fifteenth century,\r\ncaused a reformation of the nuns of St. Clara, and Mr. Lower has a ‘St.\r\nColette,’ whose parents had given him the name out of respect to ‘St.\r\nNicholas.’ ‘Coletta Clarke’ is found in Clutterbuck’s ‘Hertford’\r\n(Index). St. Nicholas, it is clear, was not neglected.\r\n\r\nThe proto-martyr Stephen has left many memorials in our nomenclature of\r\nthe popularity which his story obtained among the English peasantry. The\r\nname proper is found in such entries as ‘Esteven Walays,’ or ‘Jordan\r\nfil. Stephen,’ and their descendants now figure amongst us as\r\n‘Stephens,’ ‘Stevens,’ ‘Stephenson,’ and ‘Stevenson.’ More curtailed\r\nforms are met with in ‘Steenson’ and ‘Stinson,’ and the more corrupted\r\n‘Stimson’ and ‘Stimpson.’ The Norman diminutive was of course ‘Stevenet’\r\nor ‘Stevenot,’ and this still remains with us in our ‘Stennets’ and\r\n‘Stennetts.’ Nor do Paul and Barnabas lack memorials. Traces of the\r\nformer are found in our ‘Polsons,’[92] ‘Pawsons,’ ‘Powlsons,’ and more\r\ncorrect ‘Paulsons.’ In one of these, at least, we are reminded of the\r\nold pronunciation of this name. Piers Plowman styles it ‘Powel,’ and\r\neven so late as 1562 we find Heywood writing the following epigram:—\r\n\r\n             Rob Peter and pay Poule, thou sayst I do;\r\n             But thou robst and poulst Peter and Poule, too.\r\n\r\nThis at once explains the origin of our more diminutive ‘Pauletts,’\r\n‘Pouletts,’ ‘Powletts,’ and ‘Pollitts.’[93] ‘Barnabas’ has left his\r\nimpress upon our ‘Barnabys,’ and when not local, ‘Barnbys.’ Miss Yonge\r\nmentions an epitaph in Durham, dated 1633, commemorative of one of the\r\nproctors of the chapter—\r\n\r\n                         Under this thorne tree\r\n                         Lies honest Barnabee.\r\n\r\nA century later we find it in one of D’Orsey’s ballads—\r\n\r\n     Davy the drowsy, and Barnaby bowzy,\r\n       At breakfast will flout and will jeer, boys;\r\n     Sluggards shall chatter, with small beer and water,\r\n       Whilst you shall tope off the March beer, boys.—Vol. i. 311.\r\n\r\nThis name is now entirely out of fashion.\r\n\r\nWith five Alexanders in the New Testament it did not need the celebrity\r\nof the great commander nor that of more fabulous heroes to make his name\r\ncommon. In Scotland it obtained great favour, both in palace and\r\ncottage. The softer form was always used. Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n                     Alisaundre’s storie is commune;\r\n\r\nand Langland, among other foreign places of interest, speaks of\r\n\r\n                         Armonye and Alisaundre.\r\n\r\nThis was no doubt the popular pronunciation of the time, except that it\r\nwas usually abbreviated into ‘Sander,’ or ‘Saunder.’ Thus, in ‘Cocke\r\nLorells Bote,’ it is said—\r\n\r\n             Here is Saunder Sadeler, of Frog-street Corner,\r\n             With Jelyan Joly at sign of the Bokeler.\r\n\r\nHence it is we find such entries as ‘Thomas fil. Saundre,’ ‘John\r\nAlisaundre,’ ‘Edward Saundercock,’ or ‘Sandres Ewart,’ and hence again\r\nsuch surnames as ‘Sandercock,’ ‘Sanderson,’ ‘Saunderson,’ ‘Sanders,’ and\r\n‘Saunders.’ ‘Timothy,’ saving in ‘Timms,’ ‘Timbs,’ ‘Timson,’ and\r\n‘Timcock,’ seems to have been overlooked, and yet Glutton in ‘Piers\r\nPlowman’ is followed into the tavern by\r\n\r\n             Wat the warner, and his wife both,\r\n             Tymme the tinker, and twain of his ’prentices.\r\n\r\nBut, however unfortunate Paul’s spiritual son may have been, the same\r\ncannot be said of Clement, his fellow-labourer. Raised to high\r\ndistinction as the title of one of the greatest of the early fathers, a\r\npopular name among the Popes (for no less than fourteen were found to\r\nbear the sobriquet), Clement could not fail to meet with honour. Its\r\nusual forms were ‘Clement,’ ‘Clemence,’ and ‘Clemency.’ Diminutives were\r\nfound also in ‘Clem’ and ‘Clim.’ Of the noted North English archer it is\r\nsaid, in one of the Robin Hood ballads—\r\n\r\n               And Clim of the Clough hath plenty enough,\r\n                 If he but a penny can spare;\r\n\r\nand in the old song of the ‘Green-gown’ a rhyme is easily secured by the\r\nconjunction of such names as—\r\n\r\n                       Clem, Joan, and Isabel,\r\n                       Sue, Alice, and bonny Nell.\r\n\r\nThe chief surnames whose paternity is traceable to ‘Clement’ are\r\n‘Clements,’ ‘Clementson,’ ‘Clemms,’ ‘Clemson,’ and ‘Clempson.’\r\nArchangelic names are found in our ‘Gabbs,’ ‘Gabbots,’ and ‘Gabcocks,’\r\nfrom ‘Gabriel;’ and in our ‘Michaelson,’ ‘Mitchels,’ and ‘Mitchelsons,’\r\nfrom ‘Michael.’\r\n\r\nBut let us somewhat more closely analyse these names. As I have said\r\nbefore, from the most casual survey one thing is evident, they\r\nrepresent the Church’s Calendar rather than the Church’s Bible. They\r\nare the extract of sacred legends rather than of Holy Writ. There is\r\nnot a single name to betray any internal acquaintance with the\r\nScriptures. Nor could there well be. An English Bible was unknown, and\r\nhad there been one to consult, the reading powers of the nation were\r\ntoo limited for it to have been much used. Many of the clergy\r\nthemselves could not read. Thus the Bible, so far as extends beyond\r\nthe leading incidents it contains, was a sealed book. This had its\r\neffect upon our nomenclature. We cannot find a single trace of\r\nacquaintance with its rarer histories. What a wide change in this\r\nrespect did Wicklyffe and the Reformation effect! With an English\r\nBible in their hand, with the clearing away of the mists of ignorance\r\nand superstition, with the destruction of all forces that could\r\nobstruct the spread of knowledge, all was altered. The Bible, posted\r\nup in every church, might be read of all—and all who could probably\r\ndid read it. This at once had its effect upon our nomenclature. Names\r\nfamiliar enough in our own day to those ordinarily conversant with the\r\nScriptures, but till then absolutely unknown, were brought forth from\r\ntheir hiding-places and made subservient to the new impulse of the\r\nnation. Names associated with the more obscure books, and with\r\npersonages less directly confronting us in our study of the Word,\r\nbegin now to be inscribed upon our registers. The ‘Proceedings in\r\nChancery’ is the best evidence how far this had affected our\r\nnomenclature towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth. We come\r\nacross such names, for example, as ‘Ezechie Newbold,’ ‘Dyna Bocher,’\r\n‘Phenenna Salmon,’ ‘Ezekiel Guppye,’ ‘Dedimus Buckland,’ ‘Esdras\r\nBotright,’ ‘Sydrach Sympson,’ ‘Judith Botswain,’ ‘Isachar Brookes,’\r\n‘Gamaliel Capell,’ ‘Emanuel Cole,’ ‘Abigaill Cordell,’ ‘Reuben Crane,’\r\n‘Amos Boteler,’ ‘Philologus Forth,’ ‘Zabulon Clerke,’ ‘Archelaus\r\nGifford,’ ‘Gideon Hancock,’ ‘Seth Awcocke,’ ‘Abacucke Harman,’ or\r\n‘Melchizedek Payn.’ The ‘State Papers’ (domestic) of James I.’s reign\r\nare still more largely imbued with the new influence. We are now\r\nbrought face to face with entries such as ‘Uriah Babington,’ ‘Aquila\r\nWykes,’ ‘Hilkiah Crooke,’ ‘Caleb Morley,’ ‘Philemon Powell,’ ‘Melchior\r\nRainald,’ ‘Zachæus Ivitt,’ ‘Ananias Dyce,’ ‘Agrippina Bingley,’\r\n‘Apollonia Cotton,’ or ‘Phineas Pett.’ So far, however, the change was\r\nof a certain kind. These new names did not clash with the old\r\nnomenclature. There was a greater variety, that was all. Both romance\r\nand sacred names went together, and in the same family might be seen\r\n‘John’ and ‘Ralph,’ ‘Isaac’ and ‘Robert,’ ‘Reuben’ and ‘Richard.’ But\r\na new spirit was being infused into the heart of the nation, that\r\nspirit which at length brought about the Puritan Commonwealth. We all\r\nknow how this great change came. It is neither our intention, nor need\r\nwe enter into it here. Sufficient for our purpose that it came. This\r\nrevolution marvellously affected our nomenclature. It was not simply\r\nthat the old and, so to speak, pagan names ‘William,’ ‘Roland,’\r\n‘Edward,’ ‘Ralph,’ ‘Aymon,’ and a hundred others, once household\r\nwords, were condemned to oblivion, but even the names of the Christian\r\nsaints were ignored. ‘Cromwell,’ says Cleveland, ‘hath beat up his\r\ndrums clean through the Old Testament—you may know the genealogy of\r\nour Saviour by the names of his regiment. The muster master hath no\r\nother list than the first chapter of St. Matthew.’ The Old Testament,\r\nindeed, seems to have been alone in favour.[94] The practice of\r\nchoosing such designations borrowed therefrom as ‘Enoch,’ ‘Hiram,’\r\n‘Seth,’ ‘Phineas,’ ‘Eli,’ ‘Obadiah,’ ‘Job,’ ‘Joel,’ ‘Hezekiah,’\r\n‘Habbakuk,’ ‘Caleb,’ ‘Zeruiah,’ ‘Joshua,’ ‘Hephzibah,’ or\r\n‘Zerubbabel,’ has left its mark to this very day, especially in our\r\nmore retired country districts. Self-abasement showed itself, at least\r\nexternally, in the choice of names of bad repute. ‘Cains,’ ‘Absoloms,’\r\n‘Abners,’ ‘Delilahs,’ ‘Dinahs,’ ‘Tamars,’ ‘Korahs,’ ‘Abirams,’ and\r\n‘Sapphiras,’[95] abounded. Nor was this all. Of all excesses those of\r\na religious character are proverbially most intemperate in their\r\ncourse. Abstract qualities, prominent words of Scriptures, nay, even\r\nshort and familiar sentences culled from its pages, or parodied, were\r\ntacked on to represent the Christian name. Camden mentions, as\r\nexisting in his own day, such appellations as ‘Free-gift,’\r\n‘Reformation,’ ‘Earth,’ ‘Dust,’ ‘Ashes,’ ‘Delivery,’ ‘Morefruit,’\r\n‘Tribulation,’ ‘The Lord is near,’ ‘More trial,’ ‘Discipline,’ ‘Joy\r\nagain,’ ‘From above’—names which, he says, ‘have lately been given by\r\nsome to their children, with no evil meaning, but upon some singular\r\nand precise conceit.’ ‘Praise-God-Barebones’ is but another specimen\r\nof this extraordinary spirit. The brother of this latter could boast a\r\nstill longer sobriquet. He had chosen for himself, it is said, the\r\ntitle, ‘If-Christ-had-not-died-for-you-you-had-been-damned-Barebones,’\r\nbut his acquaintances becoming wearied of its length, retained only\r\nthe last word, and as ‘Damned-Barebones’ left him a sobriquet more\r\ncurt than pleasant. The following is a list of a jury said to have\r\nbeen enclosed in the county of Sussex at this time, and selected of\r\ncourse from the number of the Saints:—\r\n\r\n              Accepted Trevor of Norsham.\r\n              Redeemed Compton of Battle.\r\n              Faint-not Hewit of Heathfield.\r\n              Make-peace Heaton of Hare.\r\n              God-reward Smart of Fivehurst.\r\n              Stand-fast-on-high Stringer of Crowhurst.\r\n              Earth Adams of Waketon.\r\n              Called Lower of the same.\r\n              Kill-sin Pimple of Witham.\r\n              Return Spelman of Watling.\r\n              Be-faithful Joiner of Butling.\r\n              Fly-debate Roberts of the same.\r\n              Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith White of Emer.\r\n              More-fruit Fowler of East Hadly.\r\n              Hope-for Bending of the same.\r\n              Graceful Herding of Lewes.\r\n              Weep-not Billing of the same.\r\n              Meek Brewer of Oakeham.\r\n\r\nThe above list may be thought by many a mere burlesque, and so I doubt\r\nnot it is, but a similar category could be quickly put together from\r\nmore reliable sources, and some of the names therein set down did\r\ncertainly exist. The following entries are quoted by Mr. Lower from the\r\nregisters of Warbleton:—\r\n\r\n                       1617.

Replenish French.[96]\r\n\r\nThe ‘Proceedings in Chancery’ furnish us with ‘Virtue Hunt,’ ‘Temperance\r\nDowlande,’ ‘Charitie Bowes,’ and ‘Lamentation Chapman.’ The ‘Visitation\r\nof Yorkshire’ gives us ‘Fayth Neville,’ ‘Grace Clayton,’ ‘Troth\r\nBellingham,’ and ‘Prudence Spenser;’ and amongst other more general\r\ninstances may be mentioned ‘Experience Mayhew,’[97] ‘Abstinence\r\nPougher,’[98] ‘Increase Mather,’[99] ‘Thankfull Frewen,’ ‘Accepted\r\nFrewen,’[100] ‘Live-well Sherwood,’[101] ‘Faythful Fortescue,’[102] and\r\n‘Silence Leigh.’[103] The more extraordinary and rabid phases of this\r\nspirit have now passed away, but the general effect remains. It is from\r\nthis date, I have said, must be noted the declension of such a familiar\r\nname as ‘Humphrey,’ or ‘Ralph,’ or ‘Joscelyn,’ and of the romance names\r\ngenerally. From this date we perceive the use of some of our present\r\nmost familiar and till then well-nigh unknown baptismal names.\r\n\r\nWith the restoration of Charles II. much of the more rhapsodic features\r\nof this curious spirit died out, but it is more than probable it was fed\r\nelsewhere. The rigorous persecution of the Nonconformists which marked\r\nand blotted his reign, the persecuting spirit which drove hundreds to\r\nseek beyond the seas that asylum for religious liberty which was denied\r\nthem at home, could have none other effect than to make these settlers\r\ncling the more tenaciously to the new scheme of doctrine and practice,\r\nfor which they had sacrificed so much. Thus the feeling which had led\r\nthem at home to allow the Written Word to be the only source from which\r\nto select names for their children, or to make substitutions for their\r\nown, was not likely to be suppressed in the backwoods.[104] Their very\r\nlife and its surroundings there but harmonized with the primitive\r\nhistories of those whose names they had chosen. A kind of affinity\r\nseemed to be established between them. This spirit was fanned by the\r\nvery paucity of population, and the difficulty of keeping up any\r\nconnexion with the outer world. They were shut up within themselves, and\r\nthus the Bible became to them, not so much a record of the past as that\r\nthrough which ran the chronicle of the present. It was a living thread\r\ninterwoven into their very lives. Their history was inscribed in its\r\npages, their piety was fed by its doctrines. Its impress lay upon all,\r\nits influence pervaded all. All this has left its mark upon\r\nAnglo-American nomenclature—nay, to such a degree do these influences\r\nstill exist, that, though derived from the same sources, the American\r\nsystem and our own can scarce be viewed otherwise than as separate and\r\ndistinct. Rare, indeed, are the early romance and the Teutonic names in\r\nthose tracts where the descendants of the primitive settlers are found.\r\nAll are derived from the Scriptures, or are of that fancy character, a\r\nlove of which arose with their Puritan forefathers. Appellations such as\r\n‘Seth,’ or ‘Abel,’ or ‘Lot,’ or ‘Jonas,’ or ‘Asa,’ or ‘Jabez,’ or\r\n‘Abijah,’ or ‘Phineas,’ or ‘Priscilla,’ or ‘Epaphroditus,’ abound on\r\nevery hand. Sobriquets like ‘Faith,’ and ‘Hope,’ and ‘Charity,’ and\r\n‘Patience,’ and ‘Prudence,’ and ‘Grace,’ and ‘Mercy,’ have become\r\nliterally as household words, and names yet more uncouth and strange may\r\nbe heard every day, sounding oddly indeed to English ears. There would\r\nseem to have been a revulsion of feeling, even from such of the Biblical\r\nnames as had lived in the earlier centuries of our history, as if the\r\nconnexion of ‘Peter,’ and ‘John,’ and ‘James,’ and ‘Thomas’ with others\r\nof more pagan origin had made them unworthy of further use; certain it\r\nis, that these are in no way so familiar with them as with us. Such are\r\nthe strange humours that pass over the hearts of men and communities.\r\nSuch are the changes that the nomenclature of peoples, as well as of\r\nplaces and things, undergo through the more extraordinary convulsions\r\nwhich sometimes seize the body corporate of society. Truly it is a\r\nstrange story this that our surnames tell us. ‘What’s in a name?’ in the\r\nlight of all this, seems indeed but a pleasantry, meant to denote how\r\nfull, how teeming with the story of our lives is each—as so they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                            LOCAL SURNAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn well-nigh every country where personal nomenclature has assumed a\r\nsure and settled basis, that is, where a second or surname has become an\r\nhereditary possession in the family, we shall find that that portion of\r\nit which is of local origin bears by far the largest proportion to the\r\nwhole. We could well proceed, therefore, to this class apart from any\r\nother motive, but when we further reflect that it is this local class\r\nwhich in the first instance became hereditary, we at once perceive an\r\nadditional claim upon our attention.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say at the outset that, as with all countries so with\r\nEngland, prefixes of various kinds were at first freely used to declare\r\nmore particularly whence the nominee was sprung. Thus, if he were come\r\nfrom some town or city he would be ‘William of York,’ or ‘John of\r\nBolton,’ this enclitic being familiarly pronounced ‘à,’ as ‘William a\r\nYork,’ or ‘John a Bolton.’ For instance, it is said in an old poem anent\r\nRobin Hood—\r\n\r\n                  It had been better of William a Trent\r\n                  To have been abed with sorrowe;\r\n\r\nwhere it simply means ‘William of Trent.’[105] This, of course, is met\r\nin France by ‘de,’ as it was also on English soil during early Norman\r\ntimes. If, on the other hand, the _situation_ only of the abode gave the\r\npersonality of the nominee, the connecting link was varied according to\r\nthe humour or caprice of the speaker, or the relative aspect of the site\r\nitself. Thus, if we take up the old Hundred Rolls we shall find such\r\nentries as ‘John Above-brook,’ or ‘Adelina Above-town,’ or ‘Thomas\r\nBehind-water,’ or ‘John Beneath-the-town.’ Or take a more extended\r\ninstance, such as ‘Lane.’ We find it attached to the personal name in\r\nsuch fashions as the following:—\r\n\r\n                          Cecilia in the Lane.\r\n                          Emma a la Lane.\r\n                          John de la Lane.\r\n                          John de Lane.\r\n                          Mariota en le Lane.\r\n                          Philippa ate Lane.\r\n                          Thomas super Lane.\r\n\r\n‘Brook,’ again, by the variety of the prefixes which I find employed,\r\nmay well be cited as a further example. We have such entries as these:—\r\n\r\n                         Alice de la Broke.\r\n                         Andreas ate Broke.\r\n                         Peter ad le Broke.\r\n                         Matilda ad Broke.\r\n                         Reginald del Broke.\r\n                         Richard apud Broke.\r\n                         Sarra de Broke.\r\n                         Reginald bihunde Broke.\r\n\r\nThese are extracts of more or less formal entries, but they serve at\r\nleast to show how it was at first a mere matter of course to put in the\r\nenclitics that associated the personal or Christian name with that which\r\nwe call the surname. Glancing over the instances just quoted, we see\r\nthat of these definitive terms some are purely Norman, some equally\r\npurely Latin, a few are an admixture of Norman and Latin, a common thing\r\nin a day when the latter was the language of indenture, and the rest are\r\nSaxon, ‘ate’ being the chief one. This ‘atte’ was ‘at the,’ answering to\r\nthe Norman ‘de la,’ ‘del,’ or ‘du,’ and was familiarly contracted by our\r\nforefathers into the other forms of ‘ate’ and ‘att;’ or for the sake of\r\neuphony, when a vowel preceded the name proper, extended to ‘atten.’ In\r\nour larger and more formal Rolls these seldom occur, owing to their\r\nbeing inscribed all but invariably in the Norman-French or Latin style I\r\nhave instanced above, but in the smaller abbey records, and those of a\r\nmore private interest, these Saxon prefixes are common. In the writers\r\nof the period they are familiarly used. Thus, in the ‘Coventry\r\nMysteries,’ mention is made of—\r\n\r\n               Thom Tynker, and Betrys Belle,\r\n               Peyrs Potter, and Watt _at the_ Well;[106]\r\n\r\nwhile ‘Piers Plowman’ represents Covetousness as saying—\r\n\r\n                         For some tyme I served\r\n                         Symme _atte_-Style\r\n                         And was his prentice.\r\n\r\nIt may not be known to all my readers, probably not even to all those\r\nmost immediately concerned, that this ‘atte’ or ‘att’ has fared with us\r\nin a manner similar to that of the Norman ‘du’ and ‘de la.’ It has\r\noccasionally been incorporated with the sobriquet of locality, and thus\r\nbecome a recognised part of the surname itself. Take the two names from\r\nthe two poems I have but just quoted, ‘Watt at the Well’ and ‘Symme atte\r\nStyle.’ Now we have at this present day but simple ‘Styles’ to represent\r\nthis latter, while in respect of the former we have not merely ‘Wells,’\r\nbut ‘Attwell,’ or ‘Atwell.’ These examples are not solitary ones. Thus,\r\nsuch a name as ‘John atte Wood,’ or ‘Gilbert atte Wode,’ has bequeathed\r\nus not merely the familiar ‘Wood,’ but ‘Attwood’ and ‘Atwood’ also.\r\n‘William atte Lea,’ that is, the pasture, can boast a large posterity of\r\n‘Leighs,’ ‘Leghs,’ and ‘Lees;’ but he is well-nigh as commonly\r\nrepresented by our ‘Atlays’ and ‘Attlees.’ And not to become tedious in\r\nillustrations, ‘atte-Borough’ is now ‘Attenborough’ or ‘Atterbury;’\r\n‘atte-Ridge’ has become ‘Attridge,’ ‘atte-Field’ ‘Atfield;’ while such\r\nother designations as ‘atte-Town,’ ‘atte-Hill,’ ‘atte-Water,’\r\n‘atte-Worth,’ ‘atte-Tree,’ or ‘atte-Cliffe,’ are in this nineteenth\r\ncentury of ours registered frequently as mere ‘Atton,’ ‘Athill,’\r\n‘Atwater,’ ‘Atworth,’ ‘Attree,’ and ‘Atcliffe.’ Sometimes, however, this\r\nprefix dropped down into the simple ‘a.’ The notorious Pinder of\r\nWakefield was ‘George a Green’ according to the ballads regarding Robin\r\nHood. ‘Thomas a Becket,’ literally, I doubt not, ‘Thomas atte\r\nBecket’—that is, the streamlet—is but another instance from more general\r\nhistory. The name is found in a more Norman dress in the Hundred Rolls,\r\nwhere one ‘Wydo del Beck’t’ is set down. In the same way ‘atte-Gate’\r\nbecame the jewelled ‘Agate,’ and ‘atte-More’ ‘Amore’ and the sentimental\r\n‘Amor.’ I have said that where the name proper—_i.e._ the word of\r\nlocality—began with a vowel the letter ‘n’ was added to ‘atte’ for\r\npurposes of euphony. It is interesting to note how this euphonic ‘n’ has\r\nstill survived when all else of the prefix has lapsed. Thus by a kind of\r\nprosthesis our familiar ‘Noakes’ or ‘Nokes’ stands for ‘Atten-Oaks,’\r\nthat is, ‘At the Oaks.’ ‘Piers Plowman,’ in another edition from that I\r\nhave already quoted, makes Covetousness to say—\r\n\r\n                       For sum tyme I served\r\n                       Simme atte Noke,\r\n                       And was his plight prentys,\r\n                       His profit to look.\r\n\r\n‘Nash’ is but put for ‘atten-Ash,’ or as some of our Rolls records it,\r\n‘atte-Nash;’ ‘Nalder’ for ‘atten-Alder,’ ‘Nelmes’ for ‘atten-Elms,’\r\n‘Nall’ for atten-Hall,’ while ‘Oven’ and ‘Orchard’ in the olden\r\nregisters are found as ‘atte-Novene’ and ‘atte-Norchard’ respectively.\r\nThat this practice, in a day of an unsettled orthography, was common, is\r\neasily judged by the traces that may be detected in our ordinary\r\nvocabulary of a similar habit. In the period we are considering ‘ale’\r\nwas the vulgar term for an ‘ale-house.’ We still talk of the\r\n‘ale-stake,’ that is, the public-house sign. Thus ‘atten-ale’ got\r\ncorrupted into ‘nale.’ Chaucer, with many other writers, so uses it. In\r\nthe ‘Freres Tale’ we are told how the Sompnour—\r\n\r\n                   Maken him gret festes at the nale.\r\n\r\nAn old poem, too, says—\r\n\r\n                        Robin will Gilot\r\n                          Leden to the nale\r\n                        And sitten there togedres\r\n                          And tellen their tale.\r\n\r\nThus our forefathers used to talk alike of ‘an ouch,’ or ‘a nouch,’ for\r\na jewel or setting of gold. Gower has it—\r\n\r\n                  When thou hast taken any thynge\r\n                  Of love’s gifte, or nouche, or rynge.\r\n\r\nEven now, I need scarcely remind my readers, we talk of a ‘newt,’ which\r\nis nothing but a contraction of ‘an ewt’ or ‘eft,’ and it is still a\r\nquestion whether ‘nedder,’ provincially used for ‘an adder,’ was not\r\noriginally contracted in a similar manner. ‘Nale,’ or ‘Nail,’ thus\r\nlocally derived, still lives in our directories as a surname.[107]\r\n\r\nWhile ‘atte’ has been unquestionably the one chief prefix to these more\r\nfamiliar local terms, it is not the sole one that has left its mark. Our\r\n‘Bywaters’ and ‘Bywoods’ are but the descendants of such mediæval folk\r\nas ‘Elias Bi-the-water,’ or ‘Edward By-the-wode,’ and our ‘Byfords,’\r\n‘Bytheseas,’ and ‘Bygates,’ or ‘Byatts,’ are equally clearly the\r\noffspring of some early ancestor who dwelt beside some streamlet\r\nshallow, or marine greensward, or woodland hatchway.\r\n\r\nIn this pursuit after individuality, however, this was not the only\r\nmethod adopted. Another class of names arose from the somewhat contrary\r\npractice of appending to the place-word a termination equally\r\nsignificative of residence. This suffix was of two kinds, one ending in\r\n‘er,’ the other in ‘man.’ Thus if the rustic householder dwelt in the\r\nmeadows, he became known among his acquaintance as ‘Robert the Fielder,’\r\nor ‘Filder;’ if under the greenwood shade, ‘Woodyer,’ or ‘Woodyear,’ or\r\n‘Woodman’—relics of the old ‘le Wodere’ and ‘le Wodeman;’ if by the\r\nprecincts of the sanctuary, ‘Churcher’ or ‘Churchman’ in the south of\r\nEngland, or ‘Kirker’ or ‘Kirkman’ in the north; if by some priory,\r\n‘Templer’ or ‘Templeman;’ if by the village cross, ‘Crosser,’ or\r\n‘Crossman,’ or ‘Croucher,’ or ‘Crouchman;’ if by the bridge, ‘Bridger’\r\nor ‘Bridgman;’ if by the brook, ‘Brooker,’ or ‘Brookman,’ or ‘Becker,’\r\nor ‘Beckman;’ if by the well, the immortal ‘Weller,’ or ‘Welman,’ or\r\n‘Crossweller,’ if, as was often the case, it lay beneath the roadside\r\ncrucifix; if by some particular tree, ‘Beecher,’ once written ‘le\r\nBeechar,’ or ‘Asher,’ or ‘Hollier,’ or ‘Holleyman,’ or ‘Oker,’ and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nA certain number of names of the class we are now dwelling upon have\r\narisen from a somewhat peculiar colloquial use of the term ‘end’ in\r\nvogue with our Saxon forefathers. The method of its employment is still\r\ncommon in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The poorer classes still speak of a\r\nneighbour as dwelling ‘at the street end;’ they never by any chance use\r\nthe fuller phrase ‘the end of the street.’ Chaucer uses it as a familiar\r\nmode of expression. The Friar, in the preface to his story, says\r\nslightingly—\r\n\r\n                   A Sompnour is a rener up and doun\r\n                   With mandments for fornication,\r\n                   And is beaten at every tounes ende.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Persones Prologue,’ too, the same poet says—\r\n\r\n                 Therewith the moons exaltation\r\n                 In mene Libra, alway gan ascende\r\n                 As we were entring at the thorpes ende.\r\n\r\nHow colloquial it must have been in his day we may judge from the\r\nfollowing list of names I have been enabled to pick up from various\r\nrecords, and which I could have enlarged had I so chosen:—\r\n\r\n                        John ate Bruge-ende.\r\n                        Walter atte Townshende.\r\n                        John de Poundesende.\r\n                        Margaret ate Laneande.\r\n                        William atte Streteshend.\r\n                        John atte Burende.\r\n                        Adam de Wodeshende.\r\n                        Martin de Clyveshende.\r\n                        John de la Wykhend.\r\n                        William de Overende.\r\n                        John de Dichende.\r\n                        Thomas atte Greaveshende.\r\n\r\nBesides these we have such a Latinized form for ‘Townsend,’ or\r\n‘Townshend,’ as ‘Ad finem villæ,’ or ‘End’ itself without further\r\nparticularity, in such a sobriquet as ‘William atte-Nende.’[108] The\r\nseveral points of the compass, too, are marked in ‘Northende,’\r\n‘Eastende,’ and ‘Westende,’ the latter having become stereotyped in the\r\nfashionable mouth as the quarter in which the more opulent portion of\r\nthe town reside, whether its aspect be towards the setting sun or the\r\nreverse—but an exaggeration of this kind is a mere trifle where fashion\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\nBut these Saxon compounded names, numerous as they are, are but few in\r\ncomparison with the simple locative itself, without prefix, without\r\ndesinence, ‘Geoffrey atte Style,’ ‘Roger atte Lane,’ ‘Walter atte\r\nWater,’ ‘Thomas atte Brooke;’ or in the more Norman fashion of many of\r\nour rolls, ‘John de la Ford,’ ‘Robert del Holme,’ ‘Richard de la Field,’\r\n‘Alice de la Strete:’ all these might linger for awhile, but in the end,\r\nas we might foresee, as well in the mouths of men as later on in the\r\npages of our registers, they became simple ‘Geoffrey Styles’ and ‘Roger\r\nLane,’ ‘Walter Waters’ and ‘Thomas Brookes,’ ‘John Ford’ and ‘Robert\r\nHolmes,’ ‘Alice Street’ and ‘Richard Field.’ Here, then, is an endless\r\nsource of surnames to our hands. Here is the spring from which have\r\nissued those local sobriquets which preponderate so largely over those\r\nof every other class. To analyse all these were impossible, and the task\r\nof selection is little less difficult. But we may give the preference to\r\nsuch leading provincialisms as are embodied in our personal\r\nnomenclature, or to such terms as by their existence there betoken that,\r\nthough not now, yet they did then occupy a place in the vocabulary of\r\nevery-day converse. For it is wonderful how numberless are the local\r\nwords, now obsolete saving for our registers, which were used in\r\nordinary talk not more than five hundred years ago. That many of them\r\nhave been thus rescued from oblivion by our hereditary nomenclature is\r\ndue no doubt to the fact that the period of the formation of the latter\r\nis that also during which our tongue was settling down into that\r\ncomposite form of Saxon and Norman in which we now have it, and which in\r\nspite of losses in consequence, in spite of here and there a noble word\r\ncrushed out, has given our English language its pliancy and suppleness,\r\nits strengths and shades.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned ‘de la Woode’ and Attewoode.’ ‘De la Hirst’ is exactly\r\nsimilar—its compounds equally numerous. The pasture beside it is\r\n‘Hursley’—if filberts abound it is ‘Hazlehurst;’ if ashes, ‘Ashurst;’ if\r\nlindens or linds, ‘Lyndhurst;’ if elms, ‘Elmhurst.’ If hawks frequented\r\nit we find it styled ‘Hawkhurst;’ if goats, ‘Goathirst;’ if badgers or\r\nbrocks, ‘Brocklehurst;’ if deer, ‘Dewhurst’ (spelt Duerhurst, 1375). The\r\n‘holt’ was less in size, being merely a coppice or small thicket.\r\nChaucer speaks of ‘holtes and hayes.’ ‘De la Holt’ is of frequent\r\noccurrence in our early rolls. Our ‘Cockshots’ are but the ‘cocksholt,’\r\nthe liquid letter being elided as in ‘Aldershot,’ ‘Oakshot,’[109] and\r\n‘Bagshot,’ or badgers’ holt. A ‘shaw’ or ‘schaw’ was a small woody shade\r\nor covert. An old manuscript says:—\r\n\r\n                   In somer when the shawes be sheyne,\r\n                     And leves be large and long,\r\n                   It is fulle mery in feyre foreste\r\n                     To here the foulys song.\r\n\r\nAs a shelter for game and the wilder animals, it is found in such\r\ncompounds as ‘Bagshaw,’ the badger being evidently common; ‘Hindshaw,’\r\n‘Ramshaw,’ ‘Hogshaw,’[110] ‘Cockshaw,’ ‘Henshaw,’ and ‘Earnshaw.’ The\r\noccurrence of such names as ‘Shallcross’ and ‘Shawcross,’ ‘Henshall’ and\r\n‘Henshaw,’ and ‘Kersall’ and ‘Kershaw,’ would lead us to imagine that\r\nthis word too has been somewhat corrupted. Other descriptive compounds\r\nare found in ‘Birkenshaw,’ or ‘Denshaw,’ or ‘Bradshaw,’ or ‘Langshaw,’\r\nor ‘Openshaw.’ As for ‘Shaw’ simple, every county in England has it\r\nlocally, and every directory surnominally. Such a name as ‘Richard de la\r\nFrith’ or ‘George ate Frith’ carries us at once to the woodland copses\r\nthat underlay our steeper mountain-sides—they represented the wider and\r\nmore wooded valleys in fact. We find the term lingering locally in such\r\na name as ‘Chapel-en-le-frith’ in the Peak of Derbyshire. The usual\r\nalliterative expression of early days was ‘by frith and fell.’ We have\r\nit varied in an old poem of the fourteenth century:—\r\n\r\n                  The Duke of Braband first of all\r\n                  Swore, for thing that might befall,\r\n                  That he should both day and night\r\n                  Help Sir Edward in his right,\r\n                  In town, in field, in frith and fen.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Friths’ are by no means in danger of obsoletism, to judge by our\r\ndirectories—and they are a pleasant memorial of a term which was once in\r\nfamiliar use as expressive of some of the most picturesque portions of\r\nEnglish scenery. Such a name as ‘De la Dene’ or ‘Atte Den,’ of frequent\r\noccurrence formerly, and as ‘Dean’ or ‘Den’ equally familiar now, is\r\nworthy of particularity. A den was a sunken and wooded vale, where\r\ncattle might find alike covert and pasture. Thus it is that we are\r\naccustomed to speak of a den in connexion with animal life, in such\r\nphrases as a ‘den of lions’ or a ‘den of thieves.’ See how early this\r\nnotion sprang. We have a remembrance of the brock in ‘Brogden,’ the wolf\r\nin ‘Wolfenden,’ the fox in ‘Foxden,’ the ram in ‘Ramsden,’ the hare in\r\n‘Harden,’ and the deer in ‘Dearden,’[111] ‘Buckden’ or ‘Bugden,’\r\n‘Rayden’ and ‘Roden,’ or ‘Rowden.’ The more domesticated animals abide\r\nwith us in ‘Horsden,’ ‘Oxenden,’ and ‘Cowden,’ ‘Lambden,’ or ‘Lamden,’\r\n‘Borden,’ and ‘Sugden,’ or ‘Sowden;’ ‘Swinden,’ ‘Eversden,’ and ‘Ogden,’\r\nat first written ‘de Hogdene.’ With regard especially to this latter\r\nclass it is that our ‘Court of Dens’ arose, which till late years\r\nsettled all disputes relative to forest pannage. The dweller therein,\r\nengaged probably in the tendance of such cattle as I have mentioned\r\nlast, was the ‘Denyer’ or ‘Denman,’ both surnames still living in our\r\nmidst. While the _den_ was given up mainly to swine, the _ley_[112]\r\nafforded shelter to all manner of domestic livestock, not to mention,\r\nhowever, some few of the wilder quarry. The equine species has given to\r\nus ‘Horsley;’ the bovine, ‘Cowley,’ ‘Kinley,’ and ‘Oxlee’ or ‘Oxley;’\r\nthe deer, ‘Hartley,’ ‘Rowley,’ ‘Buckley,’ and ‘Hindley;’ the fox,\r\n‘Foxley;’[113] the hare, ‘Harley,’ and even the sheep, though generally\r\ndriven to the scantier pastures of the rocks and steeps, has left us in\r\n‘Shipley’ a trace of its footprint in the deeper and more sheltered\r\nglades. Characteristic of the trees which enclosed it, we get ‘Ashley,’\r\n‘Elmsley,’ ‘Oakley,’ ‘Lindley,’ or ‘Berkeley.’ Of the name simple we\r\nhave endless forms; those of ‘Lee,’ ‘Legh,’ ‘Lea,’ ‘Lees,’ ‘Laye,’ and\r\n‘Leigh’[114] being the most familiar. In the old rolls their ancestors\r\nfigure in an equal variety of dresses, for we may at once light upon\r\nsuch names as ‘Emma de la Leye,’ or ‘Richard de la Legh,’ or ‘Robert de\r\nla Lee,’ or ‘William de la Lea,’ or ‘Petronilla de la Le.’ Our ‘Atlays’\r\nand ‘Atlees,’ as I have already said, are but the more Saxon ‘Atte Lee.’\r\n\r\nIn some of these surnames we can trace the early cuttings amongst the\r\nthickly wooded districts where the larger wealds were situated. Our\r\n‘Royds,’ or ‘Rodds,’ or ‘Rodes,’ all hail from some spot _ridded_ of\r\nwaste wood. Compounds may be found in our ‘Huntroyds,’ that is, the\r\nclearing for the chase; ‘Holroyds,’ that is, the holly-clearing; and\r\n‘Acroyds,’ that is, the oak-clearing, the term ‘acorn,’ that is,\r\n‘oak-corn,’ and such local names as ‘Acton’ or ‘Acland,’ reminding us of\r\nthis the older spelling; ‘Ormerod,’ again, is but Ormes-clearing—Orme\r\nbeing, as we have already shown, a common Saxon personal name. Our\r\n‘Greaves’ and ‘Graves’ and ‘Groves,’ descendants of the ‘de la Groves’\r\nand ‘Atte Groves’ of early rolls, not to mention the more personal\r\n‘Grover’ and ‘Graver,’ convey the same idea. A ‘Greave’ was a woodland\r\navenue, graved or cut out of the forest. Fairfax speaks of the—\r\n\r\n                    Wind in holts and shady greaves.\r\n\r\n’Tis true we only ‘grave’ in stone now, but it was not always so. Thus\r\nin the ‘Legend of Good Women’ mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                           A little herber that I have\r\n                That benched was on turves fresh ygrave.\r\n\r\nWe still call the last resting-place of the dead in our churchyards a\r\n_grave_, though dug from the soil. I have already mentioned ‘de la\r\nGraveshend’ occurring as a surname. Our ‘Hargreaves’ hail from the grove\r\nwhere the hares are plentiful; our ‘Congreves’ representing the same in\r\nthe coney. Our ‘Greeves’ we shall have occasion in another chapter to\r\nshow belong to another and more occupative class of surnames. Our\r\n‘Thwaites,’ too, belong to this category. Locally the term is confined\r\nto Cumberland and the north, where the Norwegians left it. It is exactly\r\nequivalent to ‘field,’ a _felled_ place, or woodland clearing. The\r\ncompounds formed from it are too numerous to wade through. Amongst\r\nothers, however, we have, as denotive of the substances ridded,\r\n‘Thornthwaite,’ ‘Limethwaite,’ ‘Rownthwaite,’ and ‘Hawthornthwaite;’ of\r\npeculiarity in position or shape, ‘Brathwaite’ (broad), and\r\n‘Micklethwaite;’ of contents, ‘Thistlethwaite,’ ‘Cornthwaite,’ and\r\n‘Crossthwaite.’ The very dress of the majority of these compounds\r\ntestifies to the northern origin of the root-word.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Slade’ represents the ‘de la Slades’ of the Hundred Rolls. A slade\r\nwas a small strip of green plain within a woodland. One of the\r\nnumberless rhymes concerning Robin Hood says—\r\n\r\n               It had been better of William a Trent\r\n                 To have been abed with sorrowe,\r\n               Than to be that day in the greenwood slade\r\n                 To meet with Little John’s arrowe.\r\n\r\nIts nature is still more characterised in ‘Robert de Greneslade,’ that\r\nis, the green-slade; ‘William de la Morslade,’ the moorland-slade;\r\n‘Richard de Wytslade,’ the white-slade; ‘Michael de Ocslade,’ the\r\noak-slade, and ‘William de Waldeslade,’[115] the forest-slade (weald);\r\n‘Sladen,’ that is, slade-den, implies a woodland hollow. As a local term\r\nthere is a little difference betwixt it and ‘launde,’ only the latter\r\nhas no suspicion of indenture about it. A launde was a pretty and rich\r\npiece of grassy sward in the heart of a forest, what we should now call\r\nan open wood, in fact. Thus it is we term the space in our gardens\r\nwithin the surrounding shrubberies _lawns_. Chaucer says of Theseus on\r\nhunting bent—\r\n\r\n               To the _launde_ he rideth him ful right\r\n               There was the hart wont to have his flight.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Morte Arthur,’ too, we are told of hunting—\r\n\r\n                  At the hartes in these hye _laundes_.\r\n\r\nThis is the source of more surnames than we might imagine. Hence are\r\nsprung our ‘Launds,’ ‘Lands,’ ‘Lowndes,’ ‘Landers,’ in many cases, and\r\nour obsolete ‘Landmans.’ The forms, as at first met with, are equally\r\nvaried. We have ‘atte-Lond,’ ‘de la Laund,’ and ‘de la Lande,’ while the\r\norigin of our ‘Lunds’ shows itself in ‘de la Lund.’ ‘De la Holme’ still\r\nflourishes in our ‘Holmes,’ while the more personal form is found in our\r\n‘Holmers’ and ‘Holmans.’ An holm was a flat meadow-land lying within the\r\nwindings of some valley stream. Our ‘Platts,’ found in such an entry as\r\n‘Robert del Plat,’ are similarly sprung, but in the ‘plat’ there was\r\nless thought of general surroundings. As an adjective it was in common\r\nuse formerly. For instance, in the ‘Romaunt of the Rose,’ when the God\r\nof Love had shot his arrow, it is said—\r\n\r\n                    When I was hurte thus in stound\r\n                    I fell down plat unto the ground.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Knowles,’ ‘Knowlers,’ and ‘Knowlmans’ carry us to the gently rising\r\nslopes in the woods, grassy and free of timber, the old form of the\r\nfirst being ‘de la Cnolle’ or ‘atte Knolle.’ Our ‘Lynches,’ once written\r\n‘de Linches,’ I should surmise, are but a dress of the still familiar\r\n_link_ across our northern border—the flatland running by the river and\r\nsea-coast, while our ‘Kays’ (when not the old British ‘Kay’) represent\r\nthe more artificial ‘quay,’ reminding us of the knitting together of\r\nbeam and stone. It is but the same word as we apply to locks, the idea\r\nof both being that of securing or fastening.\r\n\r\nThough it is to the more open plains and woodlands we must look for the\r\nmajority of our place-names, nevertheless, looking up our steeps and\r\ninto the fissures of the hills, we may see that every feature in the\r\nlandscape has its memorial in our nomenclature. ‘De la Hill’ needs no\r\nremark. ‘De la Helle’ and ‘atte Helle’ are somewhat less pleasant to\r\nlook upon, but they are only another form of the same. ‘De la Hulle,’\r\nagain, is but a third setting of the same. Gower says—\r\n\r\n                   Upon the hulles hyhe\r\n                   Of Othrin and Olympe also,\r\n                   And eke of three hulles mo\r\n                   She fond and gadreth herbes sweet.\r\n\r\n‘Mountain’ is the ‘de la Montaigne’ of the twelfth century, but of\r\ncourse of Norman introduction. This sobriquet reminds us of the story\r\ntold of a certain Dr. Mountain, chaplain to Charles II., who, when the\r\nking asked him if he could recommend him a suitable man for a vacant\r\nbishopric, is reported to have answered, ‘Sire, if you had but the faith\r\nof a grain of mustard seed, the matter could be settled at once.’ ‘How?’\r\ninquired the astonished monarch. ‘Why, my liege, you could then say unto\r\nthis _mountain_ (smiting his own breast), “be thou removed to that\r\n_see_,” and it should be done.’[116] Our ‘Cloughs’ represent the narrow\r\nfissures betwixt the hills. From the same root we owe our ‘Clives’ (the\r\n‘de la Clive’ of the Hundred Rolls), ‘Cliffes,’ ‘Cleves,’ and ‘Clowes,’\r\nnot to mention our endless ‘Cliffords,’ ‘Cliftons,’ ‘Clifdens,’\r\n‘Cliveleys,’ ‘Clevelands,’ ‘Tunnicliffes,’ ‘Sutcliffes,’\r\n‘Nethercliffes,’ ‘Topliffs,’ ‘Ratcliffes,’ or ‘Redcliffes,’\r\n‘Faircloughs,’ and ‘Stonecloughs.’ Any prominence of rock or earth was a\r\n‘cop,’ or ‘cope,’ from the Saxon ‘cop,’ a head.[117] Chaucer talks of\r\nthe ‘cop of the nose.’ In Wicklyffe’s version of Luke iv. 29, it says,\r\n‘And thei risen up and droven him out withouten the cytee, and ledden\r\nhim to the coppe of the hill on which their cytee was bilded to cast him\r\ndown.’ We still talk of a _coping_-stone. Hence, from its local use, we\r\nhave derived our ‘Copes’ and ‘Copps,’ ‘Copleys’ and ‘Copelands,’ and\r\n‘Copestakes.’ From ‘cob,’ which is but another form of the same word, we\r\nget our ‘Cobbs,’ Cobhams,’ ‘Cobwells,’ ‘Cobdens,’ and ‘Cobleys.’ Thus,\r\nto consult the Parliamentary Writs alone, we find such entries as\r\n‘Robert de Cobbe,’ ‘Reginald de Cobeham,’ ‘John de Cobwell,’ or ‘Godfrey\r\nde Coppden.’ As a cant term for a rich or prominent man ‘cob’ is found\r\nin many of our later writers, and ‘cobby’ more early implied a\r\nheadstrong nature. Another term in use for a local prominence was\r\n‘ness,’ or ‘naze.’ ‘Roger atte Ness’ occurs in the thirteenth century;\r\nand ‘Longness’ and ‘Thickness’ and ‘Redness’ are but compounds, unless,\r\nas is quite possible, they be from the same root in its more personal\r\nrelationship to the human face, the word _nose_ being familiarly so\r\npronounced at this time. Our ‘Downs’ and ‘Dunns,’ when not sprung from\r\n‘le Dun,’ are but descendants of the old ‘de la Dune,’ of the hilly\r\nslopes; our ‘Combs’ and ‘Combes’ representing the ‘de la Cumbe’ of the\r\nridgy hollows, or ‘cup-shaped depressions’ of the higher hillsides, as\r\nMr. Taylor happily expresses it. It is thus we get our terms\r\n‘honeycomb,’ ‘cockscomb,’ ‘haircomb,’ &c. Few terms have connected\r\nthemselves so much as this with the local nomenclature of our land, and\r\nfew have made themselves so conspicuous in our directories. The writer I\r\nhave just mentioned quotes a Cumberland poet, who says—\r\n\r\n               There’s Cumwhitton, Cumwhinton, Cumranton,\r\n                 Cumrangan, Cumrew, and Cumcatch,\r\n               And mony mair Cums i’ the County,\r\n                 But nin wi’ Cumdivock can match.\r\n\r\nOf those compounds which have become surnames we cannot possibly recite\r\nall, but among the more common are ‘Thorncombe’ and ‘Broadcombe,’\r\n‘Newcombe’ and ‘Morcombe,’ ‘Lipscombe’ and ‘Woolcombe,’ ‘Withecombe’ and\r\n‘Buddicom,’ and ‘Slocombe.’ We have already mentioned ‘Amore.’ The\r\nsimple ‘More,’ or ‘Moore,’ is very familiar; ‘atte Mor,’ or ‘de la\r\nMore,’ being the older forms. This has ever been a favourite name for\r\npunning rhymes. In the ‘Book of Days,’ several plays of this kind have\r\nbeen preserved. When Dr. Manners Sutton[118] succeeded Dr. Moore in the\r\nArchiepiscopal chair of Canterbury, the following lines were written:—\r\n\r\n                  What say you?—the archbishop’s dead?\r\n                  A loss, indeed! Oh, on his head\r\n                    May Heaven its blessings pour!\r\n                  But if with such a heart and mind,\r\n                  In _Manners_ we his equal find,\r\n                    Why should we wish for _More_?\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Thomas More was Chancellor, it is said, his great attention to\r\nhis duties caused all litigation to come to an end in the Court of\r\nChancery. The following epigram bearing upon this fact was written:—\r\n\r\n                When More some years had Chancellor been,\r\n                  No more suits did remain;\r\n                The same shall never more be seen\r\n                  Till _More_ be there again.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Heaths’ explain themselves, but our ‘Heths,’ though the same, and\r\nfrom the first found as ‘atte Heth,’ are not so transparent. Some might\r\nbe tempted to set them down in a more Israelitish category as\r\ndescendants of the ‘children of Heth,’ but such is not the case.\r\nSomewhat similar to ‘Cope,’ mentioned above, was ‘Knop’ or ‘Knap’—a\r\nsummit.[119] Any protuberance, whatever it might be, was with our old\r\nwriters a ‘_knop_.’[120] Rose-buds and buttons alike, with Chaucer, are\r\n‘_knops_’:—\r\n\r\n                    Among the knops I chose one\r\n                    So fair, that of the remnant none\r\n                    Ne praise I halfe so wel as it.\r\n\r\nNorth in his Plutarch says, ‘And both these rivers turning in one,\r\ncarrying a swift streame, doe make the knappe of the said hill very\r\nstrong of its situation to lodge a camp upon.’ To our hilltops, then, it\r\nis we owe our ‘Knaps,’ ‘Knappers,’ ‘Knapmans,’ ‘Knopps,’ ‘Knopes,’\r\n‘Knabwells,’ and ‘Knaptons.’ Our ‘Howes’ represent the smaller hills,\r\nwhile still less prominent would be the abodes of our early\r\n‘Lawes,’[121] and ‘Lowes,’ or ‘de la Lawe’ and ‘de la Lowe,’ as they are\r\nfound in the Hundred Rolls. Our ‘Shores’ need no explanation, but our\r\n‘Overs’ are less known. An old poem, quoted by Mr. Halliwell, says:—\r\n\r\n                    She come out of Sexlonde,\r\n                    And rived here at Dovere,\r\n                    That stondes upon the sees overe.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been used generally to denote the flat-lands that lay\r\nabout the sea-coast or rivers generally—what we should call in Scotland\r\nthe links. I have already mentioned our ‘Overends’ as similar to our\r\n‘Townsends;’ ‘Overman’ doubtless is but the more personal form of the\r\nsame.[122]\r\n\r\nComing gradually to more definite traces of human habitation, we may\r\nmention some of our tree names. Of several, such as ‘Nash,’ and\r\n‘Nalder,’ and ‘Nokes,’ we have already spoken. Such a name as ‘Henry\r\natte Beeche,’ or ‘Walter de la Lind,’ or ‘Richard atte Ok,’ now found as\r\nsimple ‘Beech,’ and ‘Lind,’ and ‘Oake,’ reminds us that we are not\r\nwithout further obligations to the tree world. Settling by or under the\r\nshade of some gigantic elm or oak, a sobriquet of this kind would be\r\nperfectly natural. As our ‘Lyndhursts’ and ‘Lindleys’ prove, ‘lind’ was\r\nonce familiarly used for our now fuller ‘linden.’ Piers Plowman says:—\r\n\r\n                          Blisse of the briddes\r\n                          Broughte me aslepe,\r\n                          And under a lynde\r\n                          Upon a launde\r\n                          Leaned I.\r\n\r\nWere the Malvern dreamer describing poetically the birth and the origin\r\nof the future Swedish nightingale who four hundred years afterwards was\r\nto entrance the world with her song, he could not have been more happy\r\nin his expression. Our ‘Ashes’ and ‘Birches,’ once ‘de la Byrche,’ need\r\nlittle remark, but ‘Birks,’ the harder form of the latter, is not so\r\nfamiliar, though it is still preserved in such names as ‘Birkenhead,’ or\r\n‘Birkenshaw,’ or ‘Berkeley.’ A small group of trees would be equally\r\nperspicuous. Thus have arisen our ‘Twelvetrees,’ and ‘Fiveashes,’ and\r\n‘Snooks,’ a mere corruption of the Kentish ‘Sevenoaks.’ Mr. Lower\r\nmentions ‘Quatrefages,’ that is, ‘four beeches,’ as a corresponding\r\ninstance in French nomenclature.[123]\r\n\r\nA common object in the country lane or by-path would be the gate or\r\nhatch that ran across the road to confine the deer. The old\r\nprovincialism for this was ‘yate.’ We are told of Griselda in the\r\n‘Clerkes Tale’ that—\r\n\r\n                       With glad chere to the yate\r\n\r\nshe is gone\r\n\r\n                        To grete the markisesse;\r\n\r\nand Piers Plowman says our Lord came in through\r\n\r\n                  Both dore and yates\r\n                  To Peter and to these apostles.[124]\r\n\r\nOur ‘Yates,’ written once ‘Atte Yate,’ by their numbers can bear\r\ntestimony to the familiarity with which this expression was once used.\r\n‘Byatt’ I have just shown to be the same as ‘Bygate,’ and ‘Woodyat’ is\r\nbut equivalent to ‘Woodgate.’ Other compounds are found in the old\r\nregisters. In the ‘Placitorum’ of the thirteenth century, for instance,\r\nwe light upon a ‘Christiana atte Chircheyate,’ and a ‘John atte\r\nFoldyate;’ while in the Hundred Rolls of the same period we find a\r\n‘Walter atte Lideyate,’ now familiarly known to us as ‘Lidgate.’ Our\r\n‘Hatchs,’ once enrolled as ‘de la Hache,’ like our before-mentioned\r\n‘Hatchers’ and ‘Hatchmans,’ represented the simple bar that ran athwart\r\nthe woodland pathway. We still call the upper-deck with its crossbars\r\nthe hatches, and a weir is yet with the country folk a hatch. Chaucer\r\nspeaks of—\r\n\r\n                 Lurking in hernes and in lanes blinde.\r\n\r\nAny nook or corner of land was with our forefathers a ‘hearne,’ and as\r\n‘en le Herne’ or ‘atte Hurne’ the surname is frequently found in the\r\nthirteenth century.[125] ‘De la Corner’ is, of course, but a synonymous\r\nterm. A passage betwixt two houses, or a narrow defile between two\r\nhillsides, was a ‘gore,’ akin, we may safely say, to ‘gorge.’ Our\r\n‘Gores,’ as descendants of the old ‘de la Gore,’ are thus explained. ‘De\r\nla Goreway,’ which once existed, is now, I believe, obsolete. One of the\r\nmost fertile roots of nomenclature was the simple roadside ‘cross’ or\r\n‘crouch,’ the latter old English form still lingering in our ‘crutched’\r\nor ‘crouched Friars.’ Langland describes a pilgrim as having ‘many a\r\ncrouche on his cloke;’ _i.e._ many a mark of the cross embroidered\r\nthereon. A dweller by one of these wayside crucifixes would easily get\r\nthe sobriquet therefrom, and thus we find ‘atte Crouch’ to be of early\r\noccurrence. Our ‘Crouchmans’ and ‘Crouchers’ I have already mentioned. A\r\n‘Richard Crocheman’ is found in the Hundred Rolls, and a ‘William\r\nCroucheman’ in another entry of the same period. As for the simpler\r\n‘Cross,’ once written ‘atte Cross,’ it is to be met with everywhere.\r\n‘Crosier’ and ‘Crozier’ I shall, in my next chapter, show to be official\r\nrather than local; so we may pass them by for the present. The more\r\nSaxon ‘Rood’ or ‘Rudd’ is not without its representatives. ‘Margery atte\r\nRudde’ is found in the ‘Placitorum,’ and our ‘Rudders’ and ‘Ruddimans,’\r\nI doubt not, stand for the more directly personal form. Talking of\r\ncrosses, we may mention, in passing, our ‘Bellhouses,’ not unfrequently\r\nfound as ‘atte Belhus’ or ‘de la Belhuse.’ The founder of this name\r\ndwelt in the small domicile attached to the monastic pile, and, no\r\ndoubt, had for his care the striking of the innumerable calls to the\r\nsupply of either the bodily or spiritual wants of those within. Our\r\n‘Bellows,’ I believe, are but a modification of this. The last syllable\r\nhas undergone a similar change in several other instances. Thus the form\r\n‘del Hellus’ was but ‘Hill-house,’ ‘Woodus’ is but the old ‘de la\r\nWodehouse,’ ‘Stannus’ but ‘Stanehouse’ or ‘Stonehouse,’ ‘Malthus’ but\r\n‘Malthouse,’ and ‘Bacchus’ is found originally as ‘del Bakehouse.’[126]\r\nThe old ‘Atte Grene,’ a name familiar enough without the prefix, may be\r\nset beside our ‘Plastows,’ relics of the ‘Atte Pleistowe’ or ‘de la\r\nPleystowe’ of the period we are considering. The ‘play-stowe’ (that is,\r\n‘playground’) seems to have been the general term in olden days for the\r\nopen piece of greensward near the centre of the village where the\r\nmay-pole stood, and where all the sports at holiday times and wake tides\r\nwere carried on.[127] Our ‘Meads’ or ‘Meddes’ hail from the ‘meadow,’ or\r\n‘mead.’ ‘Ate Med’ is the early form.[128]\r\n\r\nA ‘croft’ was an enclosed field for pasture. Besides ‘Croft’ it has\r\ngiven us ‘Meadowcroft,’ ‘Ryecroft,’ ‘Bancroft’ (that is, _bean-croft_),\r\n‘Berecroft’ (that is, _barley-croft_), and ‘Haycraft’ (that is,\r\n_hedged-croft_). It seems, however, to have been freely used, also, in\r\nthe sense of garth or yard, the enclosure in which, or by which, the\r\nhouse stood. Thus, in the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ Satan is represented as\r\ncalling to the depraved and vile, and saying—\r\n\r\n                       Come to my crofte alle ye.\r\n\r\nWith the humour of the period, which was ever largely intermingled in\r\neven the most sacred themes, one of the characters, acting as a demon,\r\nreplies—\r\n\r\n                  Souls come so thyk now late unto hell\r\n                                   As ever\r\n                  Our porter at hell-gate\r\n                  Is holden so strait,\r\n                  Up early and downe late,\r\n                                   He rests never.\r\n\r\nThere is little distinction to be drawn between ‘garth’ and ‘yard’ in\r\nthe North of England, and in reality there ought to be none. Such names,\r\nhowever, as ‘Nicholas de Apelyerd,’ or ‘Robert del Apelgarth,’ or\r\n‘Richard atte Orcheyerd,’ the descendants of whom are still in our\r\nmidst, bespeak a former familiarity of usage which we cannot find now.\r\nWe have just mentioned ‘Haycraft.’ This reminds us of our ‘Hayes.’\r\nChaucer, in his ‘Troilus,’ says—\r\n\r\n              But right so as these holtes and these hayes,\r\n              That han in winter dead been and dry,\r\n              Revesten them in grene when that May is,\r\n              When every lusty beast listeth to pley.\r\n\r\nA ‘hay’ was nothing but a ‘hedge.’ In the Hundred Rolls we find such\r\nnames occurring as ‘Margery de la Haye’ or ‘Roger de la Hagh,’ or in a\r\ncompounded form ‘Richard de la Woodhaye,’ or ‘Robert de Brodheye.’ Of\r\nthe simple root the forms most common now are ‘Hay,’ ‘Hayes,’ ‘Haighs,’\r\n‘Haigs,’ and ‘Hawes.’ The composite forms are endless. ‘Roundhay’\r\nexplains itself. ‘Lyndsay’ I find spelt at this period as ‘Lyndshay,’ so\r\nthat it is not the islet whereon the lind or linden grows, but the hedge\r\nof these shrubs. Besides these we have ‘Haywood’ or ‘Heywood,’ ‘Hayland’\r\nand ‘Hayley.’ From the form ‘hawe,’ mentioned above, we have our\r\n‘Hawleys,’ ‘Haworths,’ and ‘Hawtons,’ or ‘Haughtons,’ and probably the\r\nlongest name in the directory, that of ‘Featherstonehaugh.’ We still\r\ntalk of the _haw_-thorn and haw-haw. Chaucer uses the term for a\r\nfarmyard or garth—\r\n\r\n                And eke there was a polkat in his hawe\r\n                That, as he sayd, his capons had yslawe.\r\n\r\nThis at once explains such a name as ‘Peter in le Hawe’ found in the\r\nHundred Rolls. But Chaucer has a prettier use of it than this, a use\r\nstill abiding in our ‘Churchays,’ relics of the mediæval ‘de\r\nChirchehay.’ He speaks twice of the ‘Churchhawe,’ or graveyard. How\r\npretty it is! almost as pretty as its Saxon synonym ‘Godsacre,’ only\r\nthat is more endeared to us, inasmuch as since the acre always denoted\r\nthe sowed land (Latin ‘ager’), so it whispers to us hopefully of the\r\ngreat harvest-tide to come when the seed thus sown in corruption shall\r\nbe raised an incorruptible body. Our ‘Goodacres’ are doubtless thus\r\nderived—and with such names as ‘Acreman’ or ‘Akerman,’ ‘Oldacre’ or\r\n‘Oddiker,’ ‘Longacre’ and ‘Whittaker’ (or ‘Whytacre’ or ‘Witacre,’ as I\r\nfind it in the thirteenth century), help to remind us how in early days\r\nan acre denoted less a fixed measure of land than soil itself that lay\r\nunder the plough. But this by the way. I have just mentioned ‘Hayworth.’\r\nA name like ‘William de la Worth’ (H.R.) represented our ‘Worths’ in the\r\nthirteenth century. Properly speaking, any sufficiently _warded_\r\nplace—it had come to denote a small farmstead at the time the surname\r\narose. ‘Charlesworth’ is the ‘churl’s worth,’ the familiar metamorphosis\r\nof this name being identical with that of the astronomic ‘Charles Wain,’\r\nand with such place-names as ‘Charle-wood,’ ‘Charlton,’ ‘Carlton,’ and\r\n‘Charley.’ Our various ‘Unsworths,’ ‘Ainsworths,’ ‘Whitworths,’\r\n‘Langworthys,’ ‘Kenworthys,’ ‘Wortleys,’ and others of this class are\r\nfamiliar to us all. Surnames like ‘Roger de la Grange,’ or ‘Geoffrey de\r\nla Grange,’ or ‘John le Granger,’[129] remind us that _grange_ also was\r\ncommonly used at this time for a farmstead, it being in reality nothing\r\nmore than our _granary_.[130] Piers Plowman portrays the good Samaritan\r\nthus—\r\n\r\n                    His wounds he washed,\r\n                    Enbawmed hym, and bound his head,\r\n                    And ledde hym forth on ‘Lyard’\r\n                    To ‘lex Christi,’ a graunge\r\n                    Wel sixe mile or sevene\r\n                    Beside the newe market.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Barnes,’ I need not say, are of similar origin. The Celtic ‘booth,’\r\na frail tenement of ‘boughs,’ whose temporary character our Biblical\r\naccount of the Israelitish wanderings so well helps to preserve, has\r\ngiven birth to our ‘Booths’ and ‘Boothmans,’ once written ‘de la Bothe’\r\nand ‘Botheman.’ They may possibly have kept the stall at the fair or\r\nmarket. Comparisons we know are ever odious, but set beside the more\r\nSaxon ‘Steads’ and ‘Steadmans’ the former inevitably suffer. The very\r\nnames of these latter betray to us the well-nigh best characteristics of\r\nthe race whence they are sprung. To be _steady_ and _sted_fast are its\r\nbest and most inherent qualities—qualities which, added to the dash and\r\nspirit of the Norman, have given the position England to-day occupies\r\namong the nations of the world. Our ‘Bowers’ and ‘Bowermans,’ when not\r\noccupied in the bowyer’s or bower’s craft, represent the earlier ‘de la\r\nBore’ or ‘atte Bore,’ and have taken their origin from the old ‘bower,’\r\nthe rustics’ abode. It is the same word whence has sprung our bucolic\r\n‘boor.’ An old English term for a house or mansion was ‘bold,’ that\r\nwhich was _built_. The old ‘De la Bolde,’ therefore, will in many cases\r\nbe the origination of our ‘Bolds.’ Our ‘Halls’ explain themselves, but\r\nthe older form of ‘Hale’ (once ‘atte Hale’ or ‘de la Hale’) is not so\r\neasily traceable. ‘De la Sale,’ sometimes also found as ‘de la Saule,’\r\nwas the Norman synonym of the same.\r\n\r\n                       Soon they sembled in sale,\r\n                       Both kynge and cardinale,\r\n\r\nsays an old writer. ‘Sale’ and ‘Saul’ are still extant. Names still more\r\ncurious than these are those taken, not from the residence itself, but\r\nfrom particular rooms in such residence. They are doubtless the result\r\nof the feudal system, which, with its formal list of house officers and\r\nattendants, required the presence of at least one in each separate\r\nchamber. Hence the Norman-introduced _parlour_, that is, the speaking or\r\nreception room, gave us ‘Henry del Parlour,’ or ‘Richard ate Parlour;’\r\nthe kitchen, ‘Geoffrey atte Kitchen,’ or ‘Richard del Kechen;’ or the\r\npantry ‘John de la Panetrie,’ or ‘Henry de la Panetrie.’ But I shall\r\nhave occasion to speak more fully of this by-and-by, so I will say no\r\nmore here.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty word which has been restored from an undeserved\r\noblivion within the last few years by Mr. Tennyson, in his ‘Brook,’ as\r\nan idyll perhaps the distinctly finest thing of its kind in the English\r\nlanguage. The word referred to is ‘thorpe,’ a village, pronounced\r\n‘throp’ or ‘trop’ by our forefathers. Thus in the ‘Clerkes Tale’ we are\r\ntold—\r\n\r\n                Nought far fro this palace honorable,\r\n                There stood a thorpe of sight delitable,\r\n                In which the poor folk of that village\r\n                Hadden their bestes and their harborage;\r\n\r\nwhile in the ‘Assembly of Fowls’ mention is prettily made of\r\n\r\n               The tame ruddocke and the coward kite,\r\n               The cock, that horiloge is of thorpes lite.\r\n\r\nThis diversity is well exemplified in our nomenclature. Thus the term in\r\nits simple form is found in such entries as ‘Adam de Thorpe,’ or ‘Simon\r\nde Throp,’ or ‘Ralph de Trop,’ all of which are to be met with in the\r\none same register; while compounded with other words, we are all\r\nfamiliar with such surnames as ‘Gawthorpe,’ ‘Winthrop,’ ‘Hartrop,’\r\n‘Denthorp,’ ‘Buckthorp,’ ‘Fridaythorp,’ ‘Conythorp,’ ‘Calthrop,’ or\r\n‘Westropp.’ Our ‘Thrupps,’ too, we must not forget as but another\r\ncorrupted form of the same root.\r\n\r\nThere are two words whose sense has become so enlarged and whose\r\nimportance among English local terms has become so great that we cannot\r\nbut give them a place by themselves. They are those of ‘town’ and\r\n‘borough.’ Such registered names as ‘William de la Towne’ or ‘Ralph de\r\nla Tune,’ now found as ‘Town’ and ‘Tune,’ represent the former in its\r\nprimeval sense. The term is still used in Scotland, as it was used here\r\nsome generations ago, to denote a farm and all its surrounding\r\nenclosures. In Wicklyffe’s Bible, where we read ‘and went their ways,\r\none to his farm, another to his merchandize,’ it is ‘one into his toun.’\r\nIn the story of the Prodigal Son, too, it is similarly employed—‘And he\r\nwente and drough him to one of the cyteseynes of that cuntre, and he\r\nsente him into his toun to feed swyn.’ Let me quote Chaucer also to the\r\nsame effect—\r\n\r\n                     Whan I out of the door came,\r\n                     I fast about me beheld,\r\n                     Then saw I but a large field,\r\n                     As farre as ever I might see,\r\n                     Without toune, house, or tree.\r\n\r\nIt is thus a name I have already mentioned, ‘de la Townshende,’ the\r\nparent of our ‘Townsends,’ ‘Townshends,’ and ‘Townends,’ has arisen.\r\nAnother entry, that of ‘Robert Withouten-town,’ has, as we might have\r\nexpected, left no issue. Such names as ‘Adam de la Bury,’ or ‘Walter\r\natte Bure,’ or ‘John atte Burende’ (the latter now extinct, I fear),\r\nopen out to us a still larger mass of existing nomenclature. The\r\nmanorial residence is still in many parts of England, with the country\r\nfolk, the ‘bury.’ To this or ‘borough’ we owe our ‘Burys,’ ‘Boroughs,’\r\n‘Borrows,’ ‘Buroughs,’ ‘Burkes,’ ‘Broughs,’ ‘Burghs,’ and even ‘Bugges,’\r\nso that, though Hood has inquired—\r\n\r\n                                If a party had a voice,\r\n                 What mortal would be a Bugg by choice?\r\n\r\nstill the possessors of that not exactly euphonious cognomen can reflect\r\nwith pride upon not merely a long pedigree, but lofty relationships.\r\nAnother form of the same word, familiar, too, to early registers, was\r\n‘de la Bere,’ and to this we owe our ‘Berrys,’ ‘Berrimans,’ ‘Beers,’ and\r\n‘Beares.’ It is wonderful how the strict meaning of ‘shelter’ is\r\npreserved in all the terms founded upon its root ‘beorgan,’ to hide. Is\r\nit a repository to guard the ashes of the dead?—it is a _barrow_, the\r\nact of sepulture itself being the _burial_. Is it a refuge for the\r\nconeys?—it is a _burrow_, or _beare_, as in ‘Coneybeare.’[131] Is it a\r\nraised mound for the security of man?—it is a _bury_, _borough_,\r\n_brough_, or _burgh_. How altered now the meaning of these two words\r\n‘borough’ and ‘town.’ Once but the abiding-place of a scattered family\r\nor two, they are now the centres of teeming populations. Of these, while\r\nsome are still extending their tether, others have passed the middle age\r\nof their strength and vigour, and from the accidents of physical and\r\nindustrial life are but surely succumbing to that dotage which, as in\r\nman so in man’s works, seems to be but premonitory of their final decay.\r\nHow true is it that the fashion of this world passeth away. Even now\r\nthis ever restless spirit of change is going on. We ourselves can scarce\r\ntell the spot upon which we were born. We need not wait for death to\r\nfind that our place very soon knoweth us no more, and when we talk of\r\ntreading in the footprints of the generations that have gone before, it\r\nwould seem as though it were but to blind ourselves to the sober and\r\nunwelcome truth that we are rather treading upon the _débris_ of the\r\nchanging years.\r\n\r\nBut there is another class of surnames we may fitly introduce here,\r\nwhich, I doubt not, forms no small proportion in the aggregate mass of\r\nour nomenclature—that of sign-names. We in a cultivated age like that of\r\nthe present fail, as we must, to realize the effect of these latter upon\r\nthe current life of our forefathers. We now pass up and down a street,\r\nand, apart from the aid of the numbered doors and larger windows, and a\r\nmore peculiar frontage, above the door we may see the name of the\r\nproprietor and the character of his occupation in letters so large that\r\nit is literally a fact that he who runs may read them. But all this is\r\nof gradual and slowly developed growth. The day we are considering knew\r\nnothing of these. It was a time when the clergy themselves in many cases\r\nwere unable to read, when such education as a child of twelve years is\r\nnow a dunce not to know would have given then for the possession of like\r\nattainments the sobriquet of ‘le Clerke’ or ‘le Beauclerk.’ And if this\r\nwas the case with the learned, what would it be with the lower grades\r\nand classes of society? We may, therefore, well inquire what would be\r\nthe use of gilded characters such as we now-a-days may see, detailing\r\nthe name of the shopkeeper and the fashion of his stores? None at all.\r\nThey could not read them. Thus we find in their stead the practice\r\nprevailing of putting up signs and symbols to denote the character of\r\nthe shop, or to mark the individuality of the owner. In an age of\r\nescutcheons and all the insignia of heraldry, this was but natural. All\r\nmanner of instruments, all styles of dress, all kinds of ensigns rudely\r\ncarved or painted, that a rough or quaint fancy could suggest, were\r\nplaced in a conspicuous position by the hatch or over the doorway, to\r\ncatch, if it were possible, the eye of the wayfarer. Even the name\r\nitself, when it was capable of being so played upon, was turned into a\r\nsymbol readable to the popular mind. Nor was it deemed necessary that\r\nthe device should speak directly of the trade. Apart from implements and\r\nutensils, Nature herself was exhausted to supply sufficiently attractive\r\nsigns; and what with mermaids and griffins, unicorns and centaurs, and\r\nother winged monsters, we see that they did not stop here—the\r\nsupernatural also had to be pressed into this service. The animal\r\nkingdom was, however, specially popular—the hostelries peculiarly\r\nengrossing this class from the fact that they so often had emblazoned\r\nthe recognizances of the family with which they stood immediately\r\nconnected. Thus we still have ‘Red Lions’ and ‘White Lions,’ ‘Blue\r\nBoars’ and ‘Boars’ Heads,’ ‘White Bears’ and ‘Roebucks,’ and ‘Bulls’\r\nHeads.’ Relics of the more special emblems remain in the barber’s pole,\r\nto the end of which a bowl was once generally attached, to show he was a\r\nsurgeon also—the pawnbroker’s three balls, the goldbeater’s mallet, or\r\nthe shoemaker’s last. Of the more fanciful we have a capital idea given\r\nus in the lines from Pasquin’s ‘Nightcap,’ written so late as 1612—\r\n\r\n             First there is maister Peter at the Bell,\r\n             A linen-draper, and a wealthy man;\r\n             Then maister Thomas that doth stockings sell;\r\n             And George the Grocer at the Frying-pan;\r\n             And maister Timothie the woollen-draper;\r\n             And maister Salamon the leather-scraper;\r\n             And maister Frank the goldsmith at the Rose,\r\n             And maister Philip with the fiery nose;\r\n             And maister Miles the mercer at the Harrow;\r\n             And maister Mike the silkman at the Plow;\r\n             And maister Nicke the salter at the Sparrow;\r\n             And maister Dick the vintner at the Cow;\r\n             And Harry haberdasher at the Horne;\r\n             And Oliver the dyer at the Thorne;\r\n             And Bernard, barber-surgeon at the Fiddle;\r\n             And Moses, merchant-tailor at the Needle.[132]\r\n\r\nMore than three hundred years previous to this we find such names\r\nfiguring in our registers as ‘John de la Rose,’ ‘John atte Belle,’\r\n‘Roger Horne,’ and ‘Nicholas Sparewe,’ while ‘Cow’ is met by its Norman\r\nequivalent in the instance of ‘Richard de la Vache.’ Of the rest, too,\r\ncontained in the above lines, all are found in our existing nomenclature\r\nwith the exception of ‘Fryingpan.’ Still more recently, the ‘British\r\nApollo’ contained the following:—\r\n\r\n                       I’m amused at the signs\r\n                       As I pass through the town,\r\n                       To see the odd mixture—\r\n                       A ‘Magpie and Crown,’\r\n                       The ‘Whale and the Crow,’\r\n                       The ‘Razor and Hen,’\r\n                       The ‘Leg and Seven Stars,’\r\n                       The ‘Scissors and Pen,’\r\n                       The ‘Axe and the Bottle,’\r\n                       The ‘Tun and the Lute,’\r\n                       The ‘Eagle and Child,’\r\n                       The ‘Shovel and Boot.’\r\n\r\nA word or two about these double signs before we pass on, as I cannot\r\nbut think much ingenious nonsense has been written thereon. There can be\r\nno difficulty in accounting for these strange combinations, some of\r\nwhich still exist. A partnership in business would be readily understood\r\nby the conjoining of two hitherto separate signs. An apprentice who, on\r\nthe death of his master, had succeeded to his business, would gladly\r\nretain the previous well-established badge, and simply show the change\r\nof hands by adding thereto his own. I cannot but think that such\r\ningenious derivations as ‘God encompasseth us’ for the ‘Goat and\r\nCompasses,’ or the ‘Satyr and Bacchanals’ for the ‘Devil and\r\nBag-o’-nails,’ or the ‘Boulogne Mouth’ for the ‘Bull and Mouth,’ are\r\naltogether unnecessary. A clever and imaginative mind could soon produce\r\nsimilar happy plays upon the conjunctions contained in the above lines,\r\nand yet the originations I have suggested for them all I think my\r\nreaders will admit to be most natural. There is no more peculiarity\r\nabout these than about the ordinary combinations of names we are\r\naccustomed to see in the streets every day of our lives, denoting\r\npartnership. Thus the only difference is that what we now read as ‘Smith\r\nand Wright,’ in an age when reading was less universal was, say, ‘Magpie\r\nand Crown.’ Partnerships, or business transactions, often bring peculiar\r\nconjunctions of names. So early as 1284, I find a ‘Nicholas Bacun’\r\nacknowledging a bond to a certain ‘Hugh Motun,’ _i.e._ Mutton. (Riley’s\r\n‘London,’ p. 23.) I have myself come across such combinations as\r\n‘Shepherd and Calvert’—_i.e._ ‘Calveherd,’ or ‘Sparrow and Nightingale,’\r\nor ‘Latimer and Ridley.’ During the early portion of my residence at\r\nOxford the two Bible-clerkships connected with my college were in the\r\nhands of two gentlemen named ‘Robinson’ and ‘Crusoe.’ They lived on the\r\nsame staircase, and their names being (as is customary) emblazoned above\r\nthe door, the coincidence was the more remarkable. ‘Catchem’ and\r\n‘Cheetham’ is said to have been the title of a lawyer’s firm, but I will\r\nnot vouch for the accuracy of the statement. A story, too, goes that\r\n‘Penn, Quill, and Driver’ once figured over a scrivener’s office, but\r\nthis is still more hypothetical.\r\n\r\nBut to return. We may see, from what we have stated and quoted, that up\r\nto a comparatively recent period the written name seems to have been\r\nanything but customary even in the metropolis. Any one who will look\r\ninto a book printed up to the seventeenth century will see on the\r\ntitlepage the fact stated that it was published or sold at the sign of\r\nthe ‘Stork,’ or ‘Crown,’ or ‘Peacock,’ or ‘Crane,’ as the case might be.\r\nHow much we owe to this fashion I need scarcely say. The Hundred Rolls\r\ncontain not merely a ‘Henry le Hatter,’ but a ‘Thomas del Hat;’ not only\r\nan ‘Adam le Lorimer,’ but a ‘Margery de Styrop.’ It is to some dealer in\r\nearthenware we owe our existing ‘Potts,’ some worker in metals our\r\n‘Hammers,’ some carpenter our ‘Coffins,’ once synonymous with ‘Coffer,’\r\nsome osierbinder our ‘Basketts,’ some shoemaker our ‘Lasts,’ some\r\ncheesemonger our ‘Cheeses,’ some plowright our ‘Plows,’ some silversmith\r\nour ‘Spoons’ and ‘Silverspoons,’ and some cooper our ‘Tubbs’ and\r\n‘Cades,’ our ‘Barrills’ and ‘Punshons,’ and so on with endless others.\r\nIt was perfectly natural that all these should become surnames, that the\r\nsame practice which led to men being called in the less populous country\r\nby such names as ‘Ralph atte Townsend,’ or ‘William atte Stile,’ or\r\n‘Henry atte Hatch,’ or ‘Thomas atte Nash,’ should in the more closely\r\ninhabited city cause men to be distinguished as ‘Hugh atte Cokke,’ or\r\n‘Walter de Whitehorse,’ or ‘John atte Gote’ or ‘de la Gote,’ or ‘Richard\r\nde la Vache,’ or ‘Thomas atte Ram,’ or ‘William atte Roebuck,’ or\r\n‘Gilbert de la Hegle,’ or ‘John de la Roe,’ or ‘Reginald de la Wonte’\r\n(weasel). Our only surprise would be were the case otherwise.\r\nNevertheless, as we shall see in another chapter, many of these\r\nanimal-names at least have arisen in another manner also.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to what we may term the second branch of local surnames,\r\nthat branch which throws a light upon the migratory habits and roving\r\ntendencies of our forefathers. So far we have touched upon names\r\nimplying a fixed residence in a fixed locality. We may now notice that\r\nclass which by their very formation throw our minds upon that which\r\nprecedes settlement in a particular spot, viz., removal—that which\r\nspeaks to us of immigration. Such a name in our mediæval rolls as ‘Peter\r\nle Newe,’ or ‘Gilbert le Newcomen,’ or ‘Walter le Neweman,’ declares to\r\nus at once its origin. The owner has left his native village to push his\r\ninterests and get a livelihood elsewhere, and upon his entrance as a\r\nstranger into some distant community, alone and friendless, nothing\r\ncould be more natural than to distinguish him from the familiar\r\n‘Peters,’ ‘Gilberts,’ and ‘Walters’ around by styling him as Peter, or\r\nGilbert, or Walter the ‘New,’ or ‘Newman.’ This it is which is the\r\norigin of our ‘Stranges,’ descendants as they are of such mediæval folk\r\nas ‘Roger le Estrange’ or ‘Roger le Straunge.’ There was ‘Roger the\r\nCooper’ and ‘Roger the Cheesemonger’ round the corner close to the\r\nmarket cross, and ‘Roger atte Ram,’ so, of course, this new-comer as\r\ndistinguished from them was ‘Roger the Straunge’ or ‘Strange,’ and once\r\nso known, the more familiar he became, the more ‘Strange’ he became,\r\nthough this may seem somewhat of a paradox. Thus, too, have arisen our\r\n‘Strangers’ and ‘Strangemans.’ These, however, are the general terms. To\r\nquote a name like ‘Robert de Eastham’ or ‘William de Sutton’ is, as it\r\nwere, to take up the plug from a never-ceasing fountain. We are thrown\r\nupon a list of sobriquets to which there is no tether. Take up a\r\nsubscription paper, look over a list of speakers at a farmers’ dinner,\r\nscan the names of the clergy at a ministerial conference, all will\r\npossess a fair average of this class of surnames, early wanderers from\r\none village to another, Saxons fresh escaped from serfdom seeking a\r\nlivelihood in a new district, Norman tradesmen or retainers pushing\r\nforward for fresh positions and fresh gains in fresh fields. It is\r\nthrough the frequency of these has arisen the old couplet quoted by\r\nVerstigan—\r\n\r\n                In ‘Ford,’ in ‘Ham,’ in ‘Ley,’ in ‘Ton,’\r\n                The most of English surnames run.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no village or hamlet in England which has not\r\nsubscribed in this manner to the sum total of our nomenclature. It is\r\nthis which is so telltale of the present, for while a small rural spot\r\nlike, say ‘Debenham,’ in Suffolk, or ‘Ashford,’ in Derbyshire, will have\r\nits score of representatives, a solitary ‘Richard de Lyverpole,’ or\r\n‘Guido de Mancestre,’ or ‘John de Burmyngham’ will be all we can find to\r\nrepresent such large centres of population as Manchester, or Liverpool,\r\nor Birmingham. Mushroomlike they sprang up but yesterday, while for\r\ncenturies these insignificant hamlets have pursued the even tenor of\r\ntheir way, somewhat disturbed, it may have been, from their equanimity\r\nfour or five centuries agone, by the announcement that Ralph or Miles\r\nwas about to leave them, and who, by thus becoming ‘Ralph de Debenham’\r\nor ‘Miles de Ashford,’ have given to the world to the end of time the\r\nstory of their early departure.\r\n\r\nIn the same class with the village names of England must we set our\r\ncounty surnames. These are of course but an insignificant number set by\r\ntheir brethren, still we must not pass them by without a word. In the\r\npresent day, if we were to speak of a man in connexion with his county,\r\nwe should say he was a Derbyshire or a Lancashire man, as the case might\r\nbe. That they did this five or six hundred years ago is evidenced by the\r\nexistence of these very names in our midst. Thus we can point in our\r\nrecords to such designations as ‘John Hamshire,’ or ‘Adam de Kent,’ or\r\n‘Richard de Wiltshire,’ or ‘Geoffrey de Cornwayle.’ Still this was not\r\nthe only form of county nomenclature. The Normans, I suspect it was, who\r\nintroduced another. We have still ‘Kentish’ and ‘Devonish’ and ‘Cornish’\r\nto represent the ‘William le Kentish’s,’ or ‘John le Devoneis’s,’ or\r\n‘Margery le Cornyshe’s,’ of their early rolls; and our ‘Cornwallis’s’\r\nalso yet preserve such fuller forms as ‘Thomas le Cornwaleys,’ or\r\n‘Philip le Cornwaleys.’\r\n\r\nWe may here mention our ‘Cockins,’ ‘Cockaignes,’ and ‘Cockaynes,’\r\ninstances of which are early found. An old poem begins—\r\n\r\n                       Fur in sea, bi west Spayne,\r\n                       Is a lond ihote Cockaigne.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a general agreement among those who have studied the\r\nsubject that our ‘cockney’ was originally a denizen of this fabled\r\nregion, and then was afterwards, from a notion of London being the seat\r\nof luxury and effeminacy, transferred to that city. A ‘William Cockayne’\r\nis found in the ‘Placitorum’ of Richard I.’s reign, while the Hundred\r\nRolls are yet more precise in a ‘Richarde de Cockayne.’ Speaking of\r\nLondon, however, we must not forget our ‘Londonish’s.’ They are but\r\nrelics of such mediæval entries as ‘Ralph le Lundreys,’ or ‘William\r\nLondonissh,’ either of whom we should now term ‘Londoner,’ one who had\r\ncome from the metropolis and settled somewhere in the country. Chaucer\r\nin one of his prose works spells it ‘Londenoys,’ which is somewhat\r\nnearer the modern form. ‘London,’ once simple ‘de London,’ needs no\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nA passing from one part of the British Empire to another has been a\r\nprolific source of nomenclature. Thus we find such names as ‘Henry de\r\nIrlaund,’ ‘Adam de Irland,’ ‘John le Irreys,’ or ‘Thomas le Ireis,’ in\r\nthe ordinary dress of ‘Ireland’ and ‘Irish,’ to be by no means obsolete\r\nin the present day. ‘Roger le Escot’ or ‘Maurice le Scot’ represents, I\r\nneed scarcely say, a surname that is all but interminable, the\r\nCaledonian having ever been celebrated for his roving as well as canny\r\npropensities. It is to our brethren over the Border, too, we owe the\r\nmore special form of ‘Inglis,’ known better in the south as ‘English.’\r\nThe Hundred Rolls furnish us with such names as ‘Walter le Engleis,’ or\r\n‘Robert le Engleys,’ or ‘Walter Ingeleys.’ Laurence Minot has the modern\r\nform. Describing Edward III.’s entrance into Brabant, he says—\r\n\r\n                     The Inglis men were armed wéle,\r\n                     Both in yren and in stele.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of our native-born Welshmen are well-nigh as\r\nnumerous as those across the Scottish line, and the early spellings we\r\nlight upon are equally varied—‘le Galeys,’[133] ‘le Waleys,’ ‘le\r\nWaleis,’ and ‘le Walsshe’ being, however, the commonest. The last is\r\nused by Piers Plowman, who speaks of\r\n\r\n                         Rose the Disheress,\r\n                         Godfrey of Garlekhithe,\r\n                         And Gryfin the Walshe.\r\n\r\nIn these, of course, we at once discern the progenitors of our ‘Welshs’\r\nand ‘Wallaces.’ ‘Walshman’ is also found as ‘Walseman.’ ‘Langlois’ seems\r\nto be firmly established in our present midst as an importation from\r\nFrance. It was evidently returned to us all but contemporaneously with\r\nits rise there, for as ‘L’Angleys’ or ‘Lengleyse,’ it is found on\r\nEnglish soil in the thirteenth century. It is quite possible that our\r\n‘Langleys’ are in some instances but a corruption of this name. Thus the\r\ndifferent quarters of the British Empire are well personified so far as\r\nour directories are concerned.\r\n\r\nWe have not quite done with the home country, however. Our modern\r\n‘Norris’s’ are of a somewhat comprehensive nature. In the first place\r\nthere can be little doubt they have become confounded by lapse of time\r\nwith the once not unfamiliar ‘la Noryce,’ or nurse. Apart from this,\r\ntoo, the term ‘le Noreys’ was ever applied in early times to the\r\nNorwegians, and to this sense mainly it is that we owe the rise of the\r\nname. And yet it has another origin. It was used in the mere sense of\r\n‘northern,’ one from the North-country. Thus in the Hundred Rolls we\r\nmeet with the two names of ‘Thomas le Noreys’ and ‘Geoffrey le\r\nNorthern,’ and there is no reason why these should not both have had the\r\nsame rise. A proof in favour of this view lies in the fact that we have\r\ntheir counterparts in such entries as ‘Thomas le Surreys’ and ‘Thomas le\r\nSouthern,’ the latter now found in the other forms of ‘Sothern’ and\r\n‘Sotheran.’ Nor are the other points of the compass wanting. A ‘Richard\r\nle Westrys’ and a ‘Richard le Estrys’ both occur in the registers of the\r\nthirteenth century, but neither, I believe, now exists. ‘North’ found as\r\n‘de North’ needs no explanation, and the same can be said for our\r\n‘Souths,’ ‘Easts,’ and ‘Wests.’\r\n\r\nThe distance from Dover to Calais is not great; but were it otherwise,\r\nwe should still feel bound in our notice of names of foreign\r\nintroduction first of all to mention Normandy. For not merely has this\r\ncountry supplied us with many of our best family names, but it enjoys\r\nthe distinction of having been the first to establish an hereditary\r\nsurname. This it did in the case of the barons and their feudary\r\nsettlements. The close of the eleventh century we may safely say saw as\r\nyet but one class of sobriquets, which, together with their other\r\nproperty, fathers were in the habit of handing down to their sons. This\r\nclass was local, and was attached only to those followers of the\r\nConqueror who had been presented by their leader with landed estates in\r\nthe country they had but recently subdued. As a rule each of these\r\nfeudatories took as his surname the place whence he had set forth in his\r\nNorman home. Thus arose so many of our sobriquets of which ‘Burke’s\r\nPeerage’ is the best directory, and of which therefore I have little to\r\nsay here. Thus arose the ‘de Mortimers’ (the prefix was retained for\r\nmany generations by all), the ‘de Colevilles,’ the ‘de Corbets,’ the ‘de\r\nFerrers,’ the ‘de Beauchamps,’ the ‘de Courcys,’ the ‘de Lucys,’ and the\r\n‘de Granvilles.’ Thus have sprung our ‘Harcourts,’ our Tankervilles,’\r\nour ‘Nevilles,’ our ‘Bovilles,’ our Baskervilles,’ our ‘Lascelles,’ our\r\n‘Beaumonts,’ our ‘Villiers,’ our ‘Mohuns,’ and our ‘Percys.’ Apropos of\r\nGranville, a story is told of a former Lord Lyttelton contesting with\r\nthe head of that stock priority of family, and clenching his argument by\r\nasserting his to be necessarily the most ancient, inasmuch as the\r\n_littletown_ must have existed before the _grand-ville_. A similar\r\ndispute is said to have occurred at Venice between the families ‘Ponti’\r\nand ‘Canali’—the one asserting that the ‘Bridges’ were above the\r\n‘Canals,’ the other that the ‘Canals’ were in existence before the\r\n‘Bridges.’ So hot waxed the quarrel that the Senate was compelled to\r\nremind the disputants that it had power alike to stop up Canals and pull\r\ndown Bridges if they became over troublesome. But to return: the number\r\nof these Norman names was great. The muster-roll of William’s army\r\ncomprised but an item of the foreign incomers. As the tide of\r\nafter-immigration set in, there was no town, however insignificant, in\r\nNormandy, or in the Duchies of Anjou and Maine, which was not soon\r\nrepresented in the nomenclature of the land. From giving even a partial\r\nlist of these I must refrain, however tempted, but see what the\r\nchapelries alone did for us. St. Denys gave us our ‘Sidneys,’ St. Clair,\r\nor Clare, our ‘Sinclairs,’ vilely corrupted at times into ‘Sinkler;’ St.\r\nPaul, our ‘Semples,’ ‘Samples,’ ‘Sempills,’ ‘Simpoles,’ and sometimes\r\n‘Simples;’ St. Lowe, or Loe, our ‘Sallows;’ St. Amand, our ‘Sandemans’\r\nand ‘Samands;’ St. Lis, our ‘Senlis’ and ‘Senleys;’ St. Saviour, our\r\n‘Sissivers;’ St. Maur, our ‘Seymours;’ St. Barbe, our ‘Symbarbes;’ St.\r\nHillary, our ‘Sillerys;’ St. Pierre, our ‘Sempers’ and ‘Simpers;’ St.\r\nAustin, our ‘Sustins;’ St. Omer, our ‘Somers;’ St. Leger, our\r\n‘Sellingers,’ once more literally enrolled as ‘Steleger,’ and so on with\r\nour less corrupted ‘St. Johns,’ ‘St. Georges,’ and others. I do not say,\r\nhowever, that all these were later comers. Some of them must undoubtedly\r\nbe set among the earlier comrades in arms of the Conqueror. Indeed it is\r\nimpossible in every case to separate the warlike from the peaceful\r\ninvasion. Looking back from this distant period, and with but scanty and\r\nimperfect memorials for guidance, it cannot but be so.\r\n\r\nWith respect to another class of these Norman names, however, we are\r\nmore certain. Their very formation seems to imply beyond a doubt that\r\nthey had a settlement as surnames in their own arrondissements before\r\ntheir arrival on English soil. We may, therefore, with tolerable\r\ncertainty set them down as later comers. The distinguishing marks of\r\nthese are the prefixes ‘de la,’ or ‘del,’ or ‘du’ attached to them.\r\nThus from some local peculiarity with respect to their early homes\r\nwould arise such names as ‘Delamere,’ ‘Dupont,’ ‘Delisle,’ ‘Delarue,’\r\n‘Dubois,’ ‘Ducatel,’ ‘Defontaine,’ ‘Decroix,’ or ‘Deville’ or\r\n‘Deyville.’ This latter is now found also in the somewhat unpleasant\r\nform of ‘Devil.’ They say the _devil_ is the source of every _evil_.\r\nWhether this extends beyond the moral world may be open to doubt, but\r\nour ‘Evils,’ ‘Evills,’ and ‘Eyvilles,’ from the fact of their once\r\nbeing written with the prefix ‘de,’ seem to favour the suspicion of\r\nthere being a somewhat dangerous relationship between them.[134] These\r\nnames, though commonly met with in mediæval records, are,\r\nnevertheless, I say, not to be put down as coeval with the Conquest,\r\nbut as after-introductions when England was securely won. There befell\r\nNorman names of this class, however, what I have shown still more\r\ncommonly to have befallen those of a similar, but more Saxon,\r\ncategory. If these prefixes ‘de la,’ ‘del,’ and ‘du’ are sometimes\r\nfound retained, they are as often conspicuous by their absence. Thus\r\nwhile at an early date after the Conquest we find the Saxon ‘Atwood’\r\nmet by the Norman ‘Dubois,’ it is equally true that they had already\r\nto battle with simple ‘Wood’ and ‘Boys’ or ‘Boyce.’ Thus it was we\r\nfind so early the Saxon ‘Beech’ faced by the Norman ‘Fail’ or ‘Fayle,’\r\n‘Ash’ by ‘Freen,’ ‘Frean,’ or ‘Freyne,’ ‘Hasell’ by ‘Coudray,’ ‘Alder’\r\nby ‘Aunay,’ and, let us say, for want of a ‘Walnut,’ ‘Nut’ by ‘Noyes.’\r\nIn the same way our ‘Halls’ or ‘Hales’ were matched by ‘Meynell’\r\n(mesnil), ‘Hill’ by ‘Montaigne,’ now also ‘Mountain,’ ‘Mead’ or\r\n‘Medd,’ or ‘Field,’ by ‘Prall’ or ‘Prail,’ relics of the old\r\n‘prayell,’ a little meadow. I have just set ‘Wood’ by our ‘Boys’ and\r\n‘Boyces.’ To these we must add our ‘Busks,’ ‘Bushes,’ ‘Busses,’ all\r\nfrom ‘bois’ or ‘bosc.’ The ‘taillis,’ or underwood, too, gives us\r\n‘Tallis,’ and the union of both in ‘Taillebois’ or ‘Talboys,’ as we\r\nnow have it, combines the names of two of our best church\r\nmusicians—‘Tallis’ and ‘Boyce.’ This comparison of early introduced\r\nNorman with names of a Saxon local character we might carry on to any\r\nextent, but this must suffice—illustrations and not categories are all\r\nwe can pretend to attempt.\r\n\r\nBut these were not our only foreign introduced names. Coeval with the\r\narrival of these later Norman designations a remarkable peculiarity\r\nbegan to make itself apparent in the vast number of names that poured in\r\nfrom various and more distant parts of the Continent. That they came for\r\npurposes of trade, and to settle down into positions that the Saxons\r\nthemselves should have occupied, is undoubted. The lethargy of the Saxon\r\npopulation at this period would be extraordinary, if it were not so\r\neasily to be accounted for. There was no heart in the nation. The Saxons\r\nhad become a conquered people, and, although the spirit of Hereward the\r\nWake was quenched, there had come that settled sullen humour which,\r\nfinding no outlet for active enmity, fed in spirit upon itself, and\r\nincreased with the pampering. To punish open disaffection is easy; to\r\neradicate by the stern arm of power such a feeling as this is\r\nimpossible. Time alone can do it, and that but slowly. More than a\r\ncentury after this we find Robin Hood the idol of popular sympathy; no\r\nnational hero has ever eclipsed him, and yet, putting sentiment aside,\r\nhe was naught but a robber, an outlawed knave. He was but a vent for the\r\nstill lingering current of a people’s feelings. It was but the Saxon and\r\nNorman over again.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine, then, if the spirit of the people was so\r\nlethargic as this, at how low an ebb would be the commercial enterprise\r\nof this period. No country was there whose resources for\r\nself-aggrandisement were greater than our own—none which had more\r\ndisregarded them up to the reign of the third Edward. Till then she was\r\nthe mere mine from which other countries might draw forth riches, the\r\ncarcase for the eagles of many nations to feed upon. Saving the\r\nexportation of wool in its raw unmanufactured state, she did nothing for\r\nher national prosperity. The Dutch cured the fish they themselves caught\r\non our coasts, and the looms of Flanders and Brabant manufactured the\r\nweft and warp we sent them into the cloth we wore. If our kings and\r\nbarons were clad in scarlet and purple, little had England actively to\r\ndo with that; her share in such superior tints was nought, save the\r\nproduction of the dye, for in conjunction with the Eastern indigo it was\r\nour woad the Netherlands used. That other nations were advancing, and\r\nthat ours was not, is a statement, commercially speaking, I need not\r\nenlarge upon; it is a mere matter of history which no one disputes.\r\n\r\nNot, however, that there was no trade. Far from it. Long before Edward\r\nIII. had established a surer basis of order and industry, London had\r\nbecome a mart of no small Continental importance. This outlying city, as\r\nwith other towns of growing industry abroad, had come under the\r\nbeneficial influence of the Crusades. So far as the redemption of the\r\nHoly City was concerned, that strong, but noble madness which had set\r\nChristendom ablaze was a failure. But it effected much in another way.\r\nFrom the first moment when on the waters of the Levant were assembled a\r\nhost as diverse in nation as they were one in purpose; when in their\r\nhigh-decked galleons and oar-banked pinnances men met each other face to\r\nface of whose national existence they had been previously all but\r\nunaware—one result, at least, was sure to follow—an intercommunion of\r\nnations was inevitable, and, in the wake of this, other and not less\r\nbeneficial consequences. Healthy comparisons were drawn, jealousies were\r\nallayed, navigation was improved, better ships were built, harbours\r\nhitherto avoided as dangerous were rendered safe, and new havens were\r\ndiscovered. This influence was felt everywhere. It reached so far as\r\nEngland—London felt it.\r\n\r\nBut it was a minor influence—minor in comparison with our wonderful\r\nappliances—minor in comparison with the commercial spirit developing\r\nsuch Republics as Genoa and Venice, or the Easterling countries that\r\nborder the Baltic and German Seas—a minor influence, too, especially\r\nbecause the Saxons had so little share in it. So far as they were\r\nconcerned, this internationality was all one-sided. Denizens of all\r\nlands visited our shores, but their visits were unreturned. What an\r\ninfinitesimal part of our Continental surnames in the present day are\r\ntraceable to English sources. On the other hand, there was no town\r\nhowever small, no hamlet however insignificant, in Normandy, in the\r\nDuchies of Anjou and Maine, or protected by the cities of the Hanseatic\r\nLeague, that is unrepresented in the nomenclature of our land. Nay, it\r\nwas this very lack of reciprocity of commerce that held out such\r\ninducements to the dwellers in other lands to visit our shores. It was\r\nto step into possession of those very advantages we slighted they came:\r\nwe became but a colony of foreign artisans. Truly our metropolis in\r\nthose early days of her industry was a motley community. Numerous names\r\nof foreign locality have died out in the lapse of centuries between; a\r\nlarge proportion have become so Anglicized that we cannot detect their\r\nContinental birth, but there is still a formidable array left in our\r\nmidst whose lineage is manifest, and whose nationality is not to be\r\ndoubted. We dare not enumerate them all. Let us, however, take a short\r\ntour over Europe and the East. We will begin with Normandy, and advance\r\nwesterly, and then southerly. The provinces that border upon Normandy\r\nand Bretagne, especially to the south and eastwards, large or small,\r\nhave, as we should expect, supplied us with many names. We have besides\r\n‘Norman,’ which, like ‘le Northern,’ is of doubtful locality, ‘Bret,’\r\n‘Brett,’ ‘Britt,’ ‘Britten,’ ‘Briton,’ and ‘Brittain,’ from ‘Bretagne,’\r\nand represented in our olden rolls by such men as ‘Hamo le Bret,’ or\r\n‘Roger le Breton,’ or ‘Thomas le Brit,’ or ‘Ivo le Briton.’ Our ‘Angers’\r\nare not necessarily so irascible as they look, for they are but\r\ncorruptions, as are ‘Angwin’ and ‘Aungier,’ of the ‘Angevine of Anjou.’\r\nLike our ‘Maines’ and ‘Maynes’ from the neighbouring duchy, they would\r\nbe likely visitors to our shores from the intimate relationship which\r\nfor a while endured between the two countries through royal alliances.\r\nOur ‘Arters’ and ‘Artis,’ once registered ‘de Artoys,’ came from\r\n‘Artois;’ our ‘Gaskins,’ and more correct ‘Gascoignes,’ from ‘Gascony;’\r\nand our ‘Burgons’ and ‘Burgoynes’ from Burgundy.[135] To Champagne it is\r\nwe are indebted for our ‘Champneys’ and ‘Champness’s,’ descendants as\r\nthey are from such old incomers as ‘Robert le Champeneis,’ or ‘Roger le\r\nChaumpeneys,’ while the more strictly local form appears in our\r\n‘Champagnes,’ not to say some of our ‘Champions’ and ‘Campions.’[136]\r\nSpeaking of Champagne, it is curious that next in topographical order\r\ncome our ‘Port-wines,’ sprung from the Poictevine of Poictou. So early\r\nas the thirteenth century, this name had become corrupted into\r\n‘Potewyne,’ a ‘Pretiosa Potewyne’ occurring in the Hundred Rolls of that\r\nperiod. More correct representatives are found in such entries as ‘Henry\r\nle Poytevin,’ and ‘Peter le Pettevin.’ Pickardy has given us our\r\n‘Pickards’ and ‘Pycards,’ Provence our ‘Provinces,’ and Lorraine our\r\n‘Loraynes,’ ‘Lorraines,’ and ‘Lorings.’ ‘Peter le Loring’ and ‘John le\r\nLoring’ are instances of the latter form. More general terms for the\r\ncountrymen of these various provinces are found in such registered names\r\nas ‘Gilbert le Fraunceis,’ or ‘Henry le Franceis,’ or ‘Peter le Frensh,’\r\nor ‘Gyllaume Freynsman.’\r\n\r\nI have mentioned ‘Norman’—one of the commonest of early sobriquets is\r\n‘le Bigod’ and ‘le Bigot.’ Well-nigh every record has its ‘Roger le\r\nBygod,’ or its ‘William le Bygot,’ or ‘Hugh le Bigot,’ or ‘Alina le\r\nBigod.’ Amid the varying opinions of so many high authorities, I dare\r\nnot speak in anywise with confidence; but, judging from these very\r\nentries which are found at an early period, I cannot but think Dean\r\nTrench and Mr. Wedgwood wrong in their conjecture that the word arose\r\nfrom the ‘beguines’—_i.e._ the Franciscans. With Mr. Taylor[137] I am\r\nfirmly convinced it is _ethnic_, and that as such it was familiarly\r\napplied to the Normans I am equally satisfied. In proof of its\r\n_national_ character, Mr. Taylor quotes a passage from the romance of\r\nGerard of Roussillon—\r\n\r\n                     Bigot, e Provençal e Rouergues,\r\n                     E Bascle, e Gasco, e Bordales.\r\n\r\nThe popular story ascribes its origin to the fondness for oaths so\r\npeculiar to the Anglo-Norman character, and in this particular instance\r\nto the exclamation ‘by-God.’[138] My own impression is that the origin\r\nof the word has yet to be found. With regard to surnames, however, I may\r\nsay that we have at this day ‘Bigots’ in our directories as well as in\r\neverything else, and it is highly probable that our Bagots are but a\r\ncorruption of the same.\r\n\r\nTurning westward, such names as ‘Michael de Spaigne,’ or ‘Arnold de\r\nEspaigne,’ tell us at once who were the forefathers of our ‘Spains’ and\r\n‘Espins;’[139] while ‘John le Moor’ suggests to us at least the\r\npossibility that English heathlands did not enjoy the entire monopoly in\r\nthe production of this familiar cognomen. The intensive ‘Blackamoor,’ a\r\nmere compound of ‘black’ and ‘moor,’ seems to have early existed. A\r\n‘Beatrice Blackamour’ and a ‘William Blackamore’ occur in a London\r\nRegister of 1417—(Riley’s ‘London,’ p. 647). Nor is Italy void of\r\nexamples. The sturdy old republic of Genoa has supplied us with\r\n‘Janeway’ and ‘Jannaway,’[140] ‘Genese’ and ‘Jayne’ or ‘Jeane.’ Chaucer\r\nalludes to the Genoese coin the ‘jane.’ An old poem, too, speaking of\r\nBrabant as a general mart, says—\r\n\r\n               Englysshe and Frensh, Lumbardes, Januayes,\r\n               Cathalones, theder they take their wayes.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Libel on English Policy’ has the word in a similar dress.\r\n\r\n             The Janueys comyne in sondre wyses,\r\n             Into this londe wyth dyverse merchaundysses,\r\n             In grete karrekes arrayde withouten lack,\r\n             Wyth clothes of golde, silke, and pepir black.\r\n\r\nHall, in his Chronicles, speaking of the Duke of Clarence ravaging the\r\nFrench coast in Henry IV.’s reign, says, ‘in his retournyng he\r\nencountred with two greate Carickes of Jeane laden with ryche\r\nmarchandise.’ (f. xxiv.)\r\n\r\nIts old rival upon the Adriatic still vies with it in ‘Veness,’ once\r\nenrolled as ‘de Venise.’ Rome has given us our early ‘Reginald le\r\nRomayns’ and ‘John le Romayns,’ whose descendants now write their names\r\nin the all but unaltered form of ‘Romaine,’[141] and to Lombardy and the\r\nJews we owe Lombard street, and our ‘Lombards,’ ‘Lumbards,’ ‘Lubbards,’\r\nand perhaps ‘Lubbers’—not to mention our ‘Luckes,’ and ‘Luckies,’ a\r\nprogenitor of whom I find inscribed in the Hundred Rolls as ‘Luke of\r\nLucca.’ Advancing eastwards, a ‘Martin le Hunne’ looks strangely as if\r\nsprung from a Hungarian source. Whatever doubt, however, there may be on\r\nthis point, there can be none on ‘William le Turc,’[142] whose name is\r\nno solitary one in the records of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, and whose descendants are by no means extinct in the\r\nnineteenth. ‘Peter le Russe’ would seem at first sight to be of Russian\r\norigin, especially with such a Christian name to the fore as the one\r\nabove, but it is far more probably one more form of the endless\r\ncorruptions of ‘le Rous,’ a sobriquet of complexion so extremely\r\nfamiliar to all who have spent any time over mediæval registers. I have\r\nalready mentioned ‘le Norrys’ as connected with our ‘Norris.’ ‘Dennis,’\r\nI doubt not, in some cases, is equally representative of the former ‘le\r\nDaneys.’ Entries like ‘William le Norris,’ or ‘Walter le Norreis,’ or\r\n‘Roger le Daneis,’ or ‘Joel le Deneys,’ are of constant occurrence.\r\nThese, added to the others, may be mentioned as bringing before our eyes\r\nthe broadest limits of European immigration, and with scarcely an\r\nexception they are found among the English surnames of to-day.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget the Dutch—a term that once embraced all the\r\nGerman race.[143] ‘Dutchman,’ though I have found no instance in early\r\nrolls, is, I see, a denizen of our present directories, while\r\n‘Dutchwomen,’ found in the fourteenth century, is extinct. Our ‘Pruces’\r\nare but the old ‘le Pruce,’ or Prussian, as we should now term them. The\r\nword is met with in an old political song, and, as it contains a list of\r\narticles, the introduction of which into England from Flanders made the\r\ntwo countries so closely connected, I will quote it fully:—\r\n\r\n           Now beer and bacon bene fro Pruse i-brought\r\n           Into fflaunders, as loved and fere i-soughte;\r\n           Osmonde, coppre, bowstaffes, stile and wex,\r\n           Peltre-ware, and grey, pych, tar, borde, and flex,\r\n           And Coleyne threde, fustiane, and canvase,\r\n           Corde, bokeram, of old tyme thus it wase.\r\n           But the fflemmynges among these things dere,\r\n           Incomen loven beste bacon and beer.\r\n\r\n‘Fleming,’ as our registers prove, was seemingly the popular term for\r\nall the Low Countrymen, bands of whom were specially invited over by two\r\nof our kings to spread their industry in our own land. Numbers of them\r\ncame in, however, as simple wool-merchants, to transmit the raw material\r\ninto Holland. As the old ‘Libel on English Policy’ says—\r\n\r\n            But ye Fleminges, if ye be not wrothe,\r\n            The grete substance of your cloth, at the fulle,\r\n            Ye wot ye made it of youre English wolle.\r\n\r\nBut Flanders was not the only division represented. Our ‘Brabazons’ once\r\nwritten ‘le Brabançon,’ together with our ‘Brabants,’ ‘Brabaners,’ and\r\n‘Brabans,’ issued, of course, from the duchy of that name; while our\r\n‘Hanways’[144] and ‘Hannants’ hailed from Hainault, the latter of the\r\ntwo representing the usual early English pronunciation of the\r\nplace-word. The old enrolled forms are ‘de Hanoia’ and ‘de Henau.’ It is\r\nvery likely, therefore, that our ‘Hannahs’ are similarly derived. The\r\npoem I have just quoted, after mentioning the products of ‘Braban,’\r\n‘Selaunde,’ and ‘Henaulde,’ proceeds to say:—\r\n\r\n             But they of Holonde at Caleyse buy our felles\r\n             And our wolles, that Englyshe men then selles.\r\n\r\nThis, and such an entry as ‘Thurstan de Holland,’ give us at once a\r\nclue, if clue were needed, to the source whence have issued our\r\n‘Hollands.’ Holandman,’ which once existed, is, I believe, now extinct.\r\nA common sobriquet for those enterprising traders who visited us from\r\nthe shores of the Baltic was ‘Easterling,’ and it is to their honest\r\nintegrity as merchants we owe the fact of their name in the form of\r\n‘Sterling’ being so familiar. In contrast to the country-made money,\r\ntheir coin obtained the name of ‘Easterling,’ or, as we now term it,\r\n‘Sterling’ money—so many pounds _sterling_ being the ordinary phrase for\r\ngood and true coin. We have even come to apply the term generally in\r\nsuch phrases as _sterling_ worth, _sterling_ honesty, or _sterling_\r\ncharacter. The more inland traders were styled ‘Almaines,’ or merchants\r\n‘d’Almaine,’[145] terms common enough in our earlier archives, as ‘le\r\nAleman,’ or ‘de Almania,’ or ‘le Alemaund,’ and thus have sprung our\r\n‘Alemans,’ ‘Almaines,’ and ‘Allmans,’ and through the French, probably,\r\nour ‘Lallimands,’ ‘D’Almaines,’ ‘Dalmaines,’ and more perverted\r\n‘Dalmans’ and ‘Dollmans.’[146] Thus to these enterprising and honest\r\ntraders we owe a surname which from the odious forms it has assumed\r\nshows that their names, at least, were corruptible, if not their credit.\r\nI ought to have mentioned, though I have no record to quote in proof of\r\nmy assertion, that our ‘Hansards’ are, I have no doubt, descendants of\r\nsuch Hanse merchants in our country as were members of the Hanseatic\r\nLeague. The founder of the Hansards, the publishers of the Parliamentary\r\nDebates, came from Norwich in the middle of the last century, and I need\r\nscarcely say that the city was the chief headquarters of the Flemish\r\nweaving interest at the date we are considering.\r\n\r\nLeaving Europe for a moment, a name of peculiar interest is that of\r\n‘Sarson,’[147] or ‘Sarasin,’ a sobriquet undoubtedly sprung from the\r\nCrusades in the East, and found contemporaneously, or immediately\r\nafterwards, in England as ‘Sarrasin,’ ‘Sarrazein,’ ‘Sarracen,’ and in\r\nthe Latinized form of ‘Sarracenus.’ The maternal grandfather of Thomas à\r\nBecket was a pure-blooded Saracen, settled in England. The ‘Saracen’s\r\nHead,’ I need not remind the reader, has been a popular inn sign in our\r\nland from the days of Cœur de Lion and Godfrey. It would seem as if they\r\nwere sufficient objects of public curiosity to be exhibited. In the\r\n‘Issues of the Exchequer’ of Henry VI.’s reign is the following:—‘To a\r\ncertain Dutchman, bringing with him a Saracen to the Kingdom of England,\r\nin money paid him in part payment of five marks which the Lord the King\r\ncommanded to be paid him, to have of his gift.’ Speaking of the\r\nSaracens, however, we are led to say a word or two about the Jews, the\r\ngreatest money-makers, the greatest merchants, the greatest people, in a\r\ncommercial point of view at least, the world has known. No amount of\r\nobloquy, no extent of cruel odium and persecution, could break the\r\nspirit of the old Israelitish trader. Driven out of one city, he fled to\r\nanother. Rifled of his savings in one land, he soon found an asylum in\r\nanother, till a fresh revolution there also caused either the king or\r\nthe people to vent their passions and refill their coffers at the\r\nexpense of the despised Jew. ‘Jury’ would seem to be a corrupted surname\r\ntaken from the land which our Bible has made so familiar to us. It\r\ncertainly is derived from this term, but not the Jewry of Palestine. It\r\nwas that part of any large town which in the Early and Middle Ages was\r\nset apart for these people, districts where, if they chose to face\r\ncontumely and despite, they could live and worship together. Every\r\nconsiderable town in England and the Continent had its Jewish quarters.\r\nLondon with its ‘Jewry’ is no exceptional case. Winchester, York,\r\nNorwich, all our early centres of commerce, had the same. Johan Kaye, in\r\nhis account of the siege of Rhodes, says: ‘All the strete called the\r\nJure by the walles was full of their blood and caren (carrion).’ Our\r\n‘Jurys’[148] are not, however, necessarily Jews, as it is but a local\r\nname from residence in such quarters, and doubtless at one time or\r\nanother during the period of surname establishment Christians may have\r\nhad habitation there. ‘Jew,’ on the other hand, as representing such\r\nformer entries as ‘Roger le Jew’ or ‘Mirabilla Judæus,’ is undoubtedly\r\nof purely Israelitish descent. But these are not all. Our early records\r\nteem with such names as ‘Roger le Convers,’ or ‘Stephen le\r\nConvers,’[149] deserters from the Jewish faith. We cannot be surprised\r\nat many of the less steady adherents of the ancient creed changing their\r\nreligious status, when we reflect upon the cruel impositions made upon\r\nthem at various times.[150] I suspect our ‘Conyers’ have swallowed up\r\nthe representatives of this name. Even in the day of its rise we find it\r\nset down in one record as ‘Nicholas le Conners.’\r\n\r\nSo much for general and national names. To pretend to give any category\r\nof the town-names that have issued from these wide-spread localities\r\nwere, of course, impossible. Such sobriquets as ‘Argent,’ from Argentan;\r\n‘Charters’ and ‘Charteris’ from Chartres; ‘Bullen,’ ‘Bollen,’ or\r\n‘Boleyn’ from Boulogne,[151] with ‘Bulness’ as representative of ‘le\r\nBoloneis;’ ‘Landels’ from Landelles; ‘Death’ or ‘D’Aeth’ from Aeth in\r\nFlanders; ‘Twopenny’ from Tupigny in the same province; ‘Gant’ and\r\n‘Gent’ from Ghent, once ‘de Gaunt;’ ‘Legge’ from Liege (in some cases at\r\nleast); ‘Lubbock,’ once written ‘de Lubyck’ and ‘de Lubek,’ from Lubeck\r\nin Saxony; ‘Geneve,’ once ‘de Geneve,’ and ‘Antioch,’ once ‘de\r\nAntiochia,’ are but instances taken haphazard from a list, which to\r\nextend would occupy all my remaining space. Many of these are connected\r\nwith particular trades, or branches of trades, for which in their day\r\nthey had obtained a European celebrity. If the peculiar manufactures of\r\nsuch places at home as ‘Kendall’ and ‘Lindsey’ and ‘Wolsey’ have left in\r\nour own nomenclature the marks of their early renown, we should also\r\nexpect such foreign cities as were more especially united to us by the\r\nties of industry to leave a mark thereof upon our registers. Such names\r\nas ‘Ralph de Arras’ or ‘Robert de Arraz,’ a sobriquet not yet extinct in\r\nour midst, carry us to Arras in Artois, celebrated for its tapestried\r\nhangings.[152] Rennes in Brittany has given birth to our ‘Raines’ and\r\n‘Rains.’[153] Chaucer talks of pillows made of ‘cloth of raines.’\r\nElsewhere, too, he makes mention of ‘hornpipes of Cornewaile,’ reminding\r\nus that in all probability some of our ‘Cornwalls’ hail from Cornouaile\r\nin the same province. Romanee in Burgundy, celebrated for its wine, has\r\nleft a memory of that fact in our ‘Rumneys’ and ‘Rummeys.’ Some of my\r\nreaders will remember that in the ‘Squyr of low degree’ the king,\r\namongst other pleasures by which to soothe away his daughter’s\r\nmelancholy, promises her,\r\n\r\n                          Ye shall have Rumney.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Challens’ are but lingering memorials of the now decayed woollen\r\nmanufactures of Chalons, of which we shall have more to say anon; and\r\nnot to mention others, our ‘Roans’ (always so spelt and pronounced in\r\nolden times), our ‘Anvers,’ once ‘de Anvers,’ our ‘Cullings,’\r\n‘Cullens,’[154] ‘Collinges,’ and ‘Lyons,’ are but relics of former\r\ntrades for which the several towns of Rouen, and Antwerp, and Cologne,\r\nand Lyons, were notorious. The rights of citizenship and all other\r\nadvantages seem early to have been accorded them. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury we find Robert of Catalonia and Walter Turk acting as sheriffs,\r\nand much about the same time a ‘Pycard’ was Mayor of London.\r\n\r\nI must stop here. We have surveyed, comparatively speaking, but a few of\r\nour local surnames. From the little I have been able to advance,\r\nhowever, it will be clear, I think, that with regard to the general\r\nsubject of nomenclature these additional sobriquets had become a\r\nnecessity. The population of England, less than two millions at the\r\nperiod of the Conquest, was rapidly increasing, and, which is of far\r\nmore importance so far as surnames are concerned, increasing\r\n_corporately_. Population was becoming every day less evenly diffused.\r\nCommunities were fast being formed, and as circumstances but more and\r\nmore induced men to herd themselves together, so did the necessity\r\nspring up for each to have a more fixed and determinate title than his\r\nmerely personal or baptismal one, by which he might be more currently\r\nknown among his fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                          SURNAMES OF OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA class of surnames which occupies no mean place in our lists is that\r\nwhich has been bequeathed to us by the dignitaries and officers of\r\nmediæval times. Of these sobriquets, while some hold but a precarious\r\nexistence, a goodly number are firmly established in our midst. On the\r\nother hand, as with each other class of our surnames, many that once\r\nfigured in every register of the period are now extinct. Of these latter\r\nnot a few have lapsed through the decay of the very systems which\r\nbrought them into being. While the feudal constitution remained\r\nencircled as it was with a complete scheme of service, while the\r\necclesiastic system of Church government reigned supreme and without a\r\nrival, there were numberless offices which in after days fell into\r\ndesuetude with the principle that held them together. Still, in the\r\ngreat majority of cases the names of these have remained to remind us of\r\ntheir former heyday glory, and to give us an insight into the reality of\r\nthose now decayed customs to which they owed their rise.\r\n\r\nWe must be careful, however, at the outset to remark that a certain\r\nnumber of these names ought, strictly speaking, to be set down in our\r\nchapter upon sobriquets. They are either vestiges of the many outdoor\r\npageantries and mock ceremonies so popular in that day, or of the\r\nnumberless nicknames our forefathers loved to affix one upon the other,\r\nand in which practice all, high and low alike, joined. For instance, no\r\none could suspect such a sobriquet as ‘Alan le Pope,’ or ‘Hugh le Pape,’\r\nthe source of one of our commonest and most familiar names, to be\r\nderived from the possessor of that loftiest of ecclesiastic\r\noffices.[155] It could be but a nickname, and was doubtless given to\r\nsome unlucky individual whose overweening and pretentious bearing had\r\nbrought upon him the affix. So, again, would it be with such a title as\r\n‘Robert le Keser,’ that is, Cæsar, corresponding to the French\r\n‘L’empriere’ and the obsolete Norman ‘le Emperer.’ This is a word of\r\nfrequent occurrence in our earlier poets. Langland says of our Lord,\r\nthere was\r\n\r\n                         No man so worthie\r\n                         To be kaiser or king\r\n                         Of the kyngdom of Juda.\r\n\r\nAgain, he finely says—\r\n\r\n                        Death cam dryvynge after,\r\n                        And al to duste passed\r\n                        Kynges and knyghtes,\r\n                        Kaysers and popes,\r\n                        Lered and lewed.[156]\r\n\r\nThis surname, too, is now all but equally common with the other, being\r\nmet with in the several shapes of ‘Cæsar,’ ‘Cayser,’ ‘Cayzer,’ ‘Kaiser,’\r\nand ‘Keyser.’[157] The name of ‘Julius Cæsar,’ as that of one of our\r\nmost esteemed professional cricketers, has only just disappeared from\r\nthe annals of that noble game. The posterity of such enrolled burgesses\r\nas ‘William le Kyng’ or ‘Thomas le Kyng’ still flourish and abound in\r\nour midst. An imperious temperament would thus readily meet with\r\ngood-humoured censure. ‘Matilda le Quen’ or ‘Simon Quene’ has not quite\r\nfailed of issue; but had it been otherwise, it could not have been\r\nmatter for any astonishment, as the sobriquet was doubtless anything but\r\na complimentary affix. We must remember that, somewhat curiously, the\r\nold ‘quen,’ or, as the Scotch still term it, ‘quean,’ at once represents\r\nthe highest rank to which a woman can reach and the lowest depth to\r\nwhich she can fall. So would it be once more with our endless ‘Princes,’\r\nand ‘Comtes’ or ‘Counts,’ ‘Viscuntes,’ the heads of provincial\r\ngovernment.[158] There is no reason, however, why our ‘Dukes,’ ‘Dooks,’\r\nor ‘Ducs,’ as they are more generally found in our rolls (‘Roger le\r\nDuc,’ E., ‘Adam le Duk.’ M.),[159] should not be what they represent, or\r\nrather then represented. A ‘duke’ was of course anything but what we now\r\nunderstand by the term, being then, as it more literally signifies, a\r\nleader, or chieftain, or head. It is thus used in Scripture. Langland,\r\nto quote him again, says of Justice—\r\n\r\n                       A-drad was he nevere\r\n                       Neither of duc ne of deeth.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, too, he describes ‘Rex Gloriæ’ as addressing Lucifer upon the\r\nbrink of Hades, and saying—\r\n\r\n                       Dukes of this dymme place,\r\n                       Anoon undo these yates,\r\n                       That Crist may come in,\r\n                       The kynges sone of hevene.\r\n\r\nIt is in this same category we must set, I doubt not, such old\r\nregistrations as ‘Robert le Baron’ or ‘Walter le Baron,’ ‘John le Lorde’\r\nor ‘Walter le Loverd,’ and ‘Walter le Theyn’ or ‘Nicholas le Then,’\r\nnames now found as ‘Baron,’ ‘Lord,’ and ‘Thain,’ ‘Thaine,’ or\r\n‘Thane.’[160] Even in the case of names of a more ecclesiastic\r\ncharacter, we shall have to apply the same remark. We have still in our\r\nmidst descendants of the ‘le Cardinals’ and ‘le Bishops’ of the\r\nthirteenth century, and there can be little doubt that these were, in\r\nthe majority of cases, but nicknames given to particular individuals by\r\nway of ridiculing certain characteristics which seemed to tend in the\r\ndirection the name suggested.\r\n\r\nAs I have already hinted, however, there is another and equally probable\r\norigin for many of the names I have mentioned. Pageantries and mock\r\nceremonies were at this time at the very height of their popularity. The\r\nRomish Church fed this desire. Thus, for instance, take Epiphany. In\r\nwell-nigh every parish the visit of the Magi, always accounted to have\r\nbeen royal personages, was regularly celebrated. Though the manner\r\nvaried in different places, the custom was more or less the same. There\r\nwas a great feast, and one of the company was always elected king, the\r\nrest being, according to the lots they drew, either ministers of state\r\nor maids of honour. Thus Herrick says—\r\n\r\n              For sports, for pageantrie, and playes,\r\n              Thou hast thy eves and holidayes:\r\n              Thy wakes, thy quintels, here thou hast,\r\n              Thy Maypoles, too, with garlandes graced:\r\n              Thy mummeries, thy twelfe-tide _kings_\r\n              And _queens_, thy Christmas revellings.[161]\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that as popular nicknames these titles would be sure\r\nto cling to the persons upon whom they had fallen, and that they should\r\neven pass on to their descendants is no more unnatural than in the case\r\nof a hundred other sobriquets we shall have occasion to recount.\r\n\r\nOf the rest, however, and, as I have said, maybe in some of the cases I\r\nhave mentioned, the surname was but truly indicative of the office or\r\ndignity held. The Saxon has suffered here. And yet to some this may seem\r\nsomewhat strange when we remember how little change really took place in\r\nthe institutions of the Kingdom by the Conquest. The Normans and Saxons,\r\nafter all, were but propagations from the same original stock, and\r\nhowever distant the period of their separation, however affected by\r\ndifference of clime and association, still their customs bore a\r\nsufficient affinity to make coalescence by no means a difficult task.\r\nWilliam was not given to great changes. He was vindictive, but not\r\ndestructive. His most cruel acts were retributive, done by way of\r\nreprisal after sudden disaffection. If a conqueror must establish his\r\npower, deeds of this kind are inevitable. And even these are\r\nexaggerated. The story of the depopulation of the New Forest, it is now\r\npretty generally agreed, is impossible—its present condition forbids of\r\nany such act to have been practicable—and the notion frequently conveyed\r\nin our smaller books of English history, that the curfew was a badge and\r\ntoken of servitude, is simply absurd, the fact being that the same\r\ncustom prevailed over the whole of Western Europe, as a mere precaution\r\nagainst fire at a time when our towns were mainly constructed of wood. A\r\ncrushed people will always misinterpret such ordinances. Prejudice of\r\nthis kind is perfectly pardonable. William then, I say, was not inclined\r\nto uproot Saxon institutions. The national council still remained. The\r\nancient tribunals with their various motes, the whole system of law\r\nwhich guided the administration of justice, all was well-nigh as it had\r\nbeen heretofore. But the language which was the medium of all this was\r\ngenerally changed. The old laws were indeed used, but in a translated\r\nform—old officerships still existed, but in a new dialect—the old policy\r\nwas mainly upheld, but new terms of police were introduced. It was not\r\ntill Edward III.’s reign that pleadings in the various courts were again\r\ncarried on in the English tongue—it was not till Henry VI.’s reign the\r\nproceedings in Parliament were recorded in the people’s dialect—not till\r\nRichard III.’s day its statutes and ordinances ceased to be indited in\r\nNorman-French. This at once shows the difficulty of any officership,\r\nhowever Saxon, retaining its original title. The office was maintained,\r\nbut the name was changed. This was the more certain to ensue, so far as\r\nthe Church was concerned, from the fact that for a considerable period\r\nall ecclesiastic vacancies were filled up from abroad. Bishops and\r\nabbots were removed on pretexts of one sort or another, and their places\r\nsupplied from the Conqueror’s chaplains. The monasteries were hived with\r\nNormans; the clergy generally were of foreign descent. It was the same,\r\nor nearly the same, with regard to civil government. The lesser courts\r\nof judicature were ruled by foreigners and the foreign tongue. The\r\nBarons, as they retired into the provinces and to the estates allotted\r\nthem, naturally bore with them a Norman retinue. All their surroundings\r\nbecame quickly the same. Thus the French language was used not merely in\r\ntheir common conversation—that of course—but so far as their power,\r\nundoubtedly large, existed, in the provincial courts also.\r\n\r\nSuch entries as ‘Thomas le Shirreve’ and ‘Lena le Shireve’ remind us not\r\nmerely of our present existing ‘Sheriffs,’ ‘Sherrifs,’ and ‘Shreeves,’\r\nbut how firmly this Saxon word has maintained its hold through the many\r\nfluctuations of English government. The Norman ‘Judge,’ though it is\r\nfirmly established in our courts of law, has not made any very great\r\nimpress upon our nomenclature. ‘Justice,’ a relic of ‘William’ or ‘Eva\r\nle Justice,’[162] is more commonly met with. Our ‘Corners,’ when not\r\ndescendants of the local ‘de la Corners’ of the thirteenth century, are\r\nbut corruptions of many a ‘John le Coroner’ or ‘Henry le Corouner’ of\r\nthe same period. It is even found in the abbreviated form of ‘Corner,’\r\nin ‘John le Corner’ and ‘Walter le Cornur.’ Thus we see that so early as\r\nthis our forefathers discerned in the death of a subject a matter that\r\nconcerned not merely the well-being of the crown, but that of which the\r\ncrown as the true parent of a nation’s interests was to take cognizance.\r\nMore directly opposed to the Norman ‘Judge’ and ‘Justice,’ and in the\r\nend displaced by them, were our Saxon ‘Demer’ and ‘Dempster’ (the older\r\nforms being ‘le Demere’ and ‘le Demester’), they who pronounced the\r\ndoom. An old English Psalter thus translates Psalm cxlviii. 11:—\r\n\r\n                 Kinges of earth, and alle folk living,\r\n                 Princes and all _demers_ of land.\r\n\r\nAn antique poem, too, has it in its other form in the following\r\ncouplet:—\r\n\r\n                       Ayoth was then _demester_\r\n                       Of Israel foure score yeer.\r\n\r\nWe still employ the term ‘doom’ for judgment. Chaucer speaks familiarly\r\nof one of the Canterbury company as a ‘Serjeant of the Lawe.’ It is, in\r\nthe majority of cases, to the term ‘sergeant’ as used in this capacity\r\nwe owe our much-varied ‘Sargants,’ ‘Sargeants,’ ‘Sargeaunts,’\r\n‘Sargents,’ ‘Sergents,’ ‘Sergeants,’ ‘Sarjants,’ and ‘Sarjeants.’ The\r\nsame poet says of him:—\r\n\r\n                  Justice he was full often in assize,\r\n                  By patent and by pleine commission.\r\n\r\n‘Alured le Pledur,’ or ‘Henry le Pleidour,’ and ‘Peter le Escuzer,’ all\r\nobsolete as surnames, need little or no explanation. Speaking of\r\nassizes, we are reminded of our ‘Sisers’ and ‘Sizers,’ representatives\r\nof the old ‘Assizer’—he who was commissioned to hold the court. Piers\r\nPlowman frequently mentions him:—\r\n\r\n                     To marien this mayde\r\n                     Were many men assembled,\r\n                     As of knyghts, and of clerkes,\r\n                     And other commune people,\r\n                     As sisours, and somenours,\r\n                     Sherreves, and baillifs.\r\n\r\nWe are here reminded of ‘Hugh le Somenur,’ or ‘Henry le Sumenour,’ now\r\nspelt ‘Sumner,’ the sheriff’s messenger, he by whom the delinquent was\r\nbrought up to the court. He was the modern apparitor in fact. In the\r\n‘Coventry Mysteries’ it is said:—\r\n\r\n                 Sim Somnor, in haste wend thou thi way,\r\n                 Byd Joseph, and his wyff by name,\r\n                 At the coorte to apper this day,\r\n                 Him to purge of her defame.\r\n\r\nA ‘Godwin Bedellus’ occurs so early as Domesday record, and as ‘Roger le\r\nBedel,’ or ‘Martin le Bedel,’ the name is by no means rare somewhat\r\nlater on. He was, whether in the forest or any other court, the\r\nservitor, he who executed processes or attended to proclamations. The\r\nmodern forms of the name comprise, among others, ‘Beadell,’ ‘Beadle,’\r\n‘Beaddall,’ and ‘Biddle.’ Such names as ‘Richard le Gayeler’ or ‘Ada le\r\nGaoler,’ are very commonly met with in our mediæval rolls. The term\r\nitself is of Norman origin, reminding us that, however menial the duty,\r\nthe Saxon could not be entrusted with such an office as this. We cannot,\r\nhowever, speak of the gaoler and his _confrères_ without referring to a\r\ncurious sobriquet of this period, a sobriquet to which we owe in the\r\npresent day our ‘Catchpoles’ and ‘Catchpooles.’[163] The catchpole was a\r\nkind of under-bailiff or petty sergeant who distrained for debt, or\r\notherwise did the more unpleasant part of his superior’s work, and was\r\nso called from his habit of seizing his luckless victim by the hair, or\r\n_poll_, as was the familiar term then. So general was this nickname that\r\nwe find it occupying an all but official place. It is Latinized in our\r\nrecords into ‘cachepollus,’ a word unknown to Cicero, I am afraid. In\r\nthe ‘Plowman’s Vision’ we are told of the two thieves crucified with the\r\nSaviour that:—\r\n\r\n                     A cachepol cam forth\r\n                     And cracked both their legges.\r\n\r\nAnother name for the catchpole was that of ‘Cacherel’ or ‘Cacher,’ both\r\nof which forms occur at this same period as surnames. An old political\r\nsong says, murmuringly:—\r\n\r\n                Nedes I must spend that I spared of yore\r\n                  Ageyn this cacherele cometh.\r\n\r\nThis sobriquet also abides with us still.[164] ‘Le Cacher,’ I fear, has\r\nbeen obsolete for centuries.[165]\r\n\r\nOf such as were accountable for duties in the public streets, we may\r\nmention first our ‘Cryers,’ registered at the time we are speaking of as\r\n‘Philip le Criour,’ or ‘Wat le Creyer.’ He, like the still existing\r\n‘Bellman,’[166] performed a fixed round, announcing in full and\r\nsententious tones the mandates of bench and council, whenever it was\r\nnecessary to advertise to the public such news as concerned their common\r\nwell-being. Our _policeman_ may be modern in his name and in his attire,\r\nbut as the guardian of the peace, by night as well as by day, he is but\r\nthe descendant of a long line of servants who have in turn fulfilled\r\nthis important public trust. His early title was borne by ‘Ralph le\r\nWeyte,’ or ‘Robert le Wayte,’ or ‘Hugh le Geyt,’ or ‘Robert le Gait.’\r\nAll these forms are of the commonest occurrence in our olden registries.\r\nBy night he carried a trump, with which to sound the watches or give the\r\nalarm, and thus it was he acquired also the name of ‘Trumper,’ such\r\nforms as ‘Adam le Trompour’ or ‘William le Trompour’ being frequently\r\nmet with at this time. To the former title of this official duty it is\r\nwe owe the fact of our still terming any company of night serenaders\r\n‘waits,’ and especially those bands of strolling minstrels who keep up\r\nthe good old custom of watching in Christmas morn. A good old custom, I\r\nsay, even though it may cost us a few pence and rouse us somewhat\r\nrudely, maybe, from our slumbers. ‘Wait,’ ‘Waite,’[167] ‘Wayt,’ and\r\n‘Whaite,’ with ‘le Geyt,’ are the forms that still exist among us.\r\n‘Trumper,’ too, has its place equally assured in our nomenclature.\r\n\r\nSuch names as we have just dwelt upon, however, remind us of other\r\nmunicipal authorities, higher in position than these, to whom, indeed,\r\nthese were but servitors. A sobriquet like ‘Richard le Burgess’ or ‘John\r\nle Burges’ reminds us of the freemen of the borough towns, while ‘le\r\nMayor,’ or ‘Mayer,’ or ‘Maire,’ or ‘Mair,’ or ‘Meyre,’[168] or ‘Mire,’\r\nfor all these different spellings are found, is equally suggestive of\r\nthe chief magistracy of such. Piers, to quote him once more, speaks of:—\r\n\r\n                       The maistres,\r\n                   Meirs and Jugges,\r\n                   That have the welthe of this world.\r\n\r\nThe feminine form of this sobriquet appears in the early but obsolete\r\n‘Margaret la Miresse.’ Speaking of mayors, some lines written some years\r\nago on the proposed elevation of a certain Alderman Wood as Lord Mayor\r\nare not without humour, nor out of place, perhaps, here:—\r\n\r\n                 In choice of Mayors ’twill be confest,\r\n                 Our citizens are prone to jest:\r\n                 Of late a gentle ‘Flower’ they tried—\r\n                 November came and checked its pride.\r\n                 A ‘Hunter’ next, on palfrey grey,\r\n                 Proudly pranced his year away.\r\n                 The next, good order’s foes to scare,\r\n                 Placed ‘Birch’ upon the civic chair.\r\n                 Alas! this year, ’tis understood,\r\n                 They mean to make a mayor of ‘Wood!’\r\n\r\nAs a fellow to ‘Meir’ we may cite ‘Provost,’ or ‘Prevost,’ or ‘Provis,’\r\na term still used of the mayoralty in Scotland. ‘Councellor’ and\r\n‘Councilman’ are still familiar terms in our midst. ‘Clavenger,’\r\n‘Claver,’ and ‘Cleaver’ we will mention last as filling up a list of\r\ncivic offices entirely, so far as the language is concerned, the\r\nproperty of the dominant power. A ‘Robert Clavynger’ occurs in the\r\nParliamentary Rolls. Its root is ‘claviger,’ the key-bearer,’ one whose\r\noffice it was at this time to protect the deposits, whether of money or\r\nparchments, belonging to the civic authorities. The more common term was\r\nthat of ‘Clavier,’ such entries as ‘Henry le Claver,’ or ‘John le\r\nClavour,’ or ‘John le Clavier,’[169] being of familiar occurrence at\r\nthis time. Thus in a treaty agreed upon between the Mayor, sheriffs, and\r\ncommonalty of Norwich in 1414, it was declared that ‘the mayor and\r\ntwenty-four (of the council) shall choose a common clerk, a coroner, two\r\nclavers, and eight constables, and the sixty common council shall choose\r\na common speaker, one coroner, two clavers, and eight constables.’\r\n(‘Hist. Norf.,’ Blomefield.) In a day when there were no patent safes we\r\ncan readily understand the importance of appointing men whose one care\r\nit was to guard the chests wherein were stored up the various\r\nparchments, moneys, and seals belonging to the civic council. This\r\ncomprises our list of Norman civil officers. One name, and one only, of\r\nthis class is Saxon, that of ‘Alderman,’ but I have found it occurring\r\nas a surname in only one or two instances, and I believe it has now\r\nbecome obsolete.\r\n\r\nTurning from municipal to ecclesiastical affairs, we find the Church of\r\nmediæval times surrounded with memorials. Some of these I have already\r\nhinted at as being mere sobriquets;[170] none the less, however, do we\r\nowe them to the existing institutions. Such names as ‘Hugo le Archevesk’\r\nor ‘William le Arceveske’ can be only thus viewed. In ‘Morte Arthure’\r\nthe hero holds festival at Caerleon,\r\n\r\n             Wyth dukez, and dusperes of dyvers rewmes,\r\n             Erles and erchevesques, and other ynowe,\r\n             Byschopes and bachelers and banerettes nobille.\r\n\r\nWhile this has long vanished from our directories, the descendants of\r\n‘John le Bissup’ or ‘Robert le Biscop’ are firmly established therein.\r\nThe more Norman ‘Robert le Vecke’ and ‘Nicholas le Vesk’ still live also\r\nin our ‘Vicks’ and ‘Vecks.’ It was only the other day I saw ‘Archdeacon’\r\nover a hatter’s shop—and that it is no corruption of some other word, we\r\nmay cite the early ‘Thomas le Arcedekne’ as a proof.[171] Whether\r\n‘Archpriest,’ a sobriquet occurring at the same date, was but another\r\ndesignation of the same, or performed more episcopal functions, I cannot\r\nsay.[172] The name, however, is obsolete in every sense. The old vicar\r\nhas bequeathed us our ‘Vicars,’ ‘Vicarys,’ and ‘Vickermans.’ Chaucer\r\nsays in the ‘Persons Prologue’—\r\n\r\n               Sire preest, quod he, art thou a vicary?\r\n               Or art thou a Person? say soth by thy fay.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Parsons,’ as Mr. Lowther thinks, are but a form of ‘Piers’ son,’\r\nthat is, ‘Peters’ son.’ It is, however, quite possible for them to be\r\nwhat they more nearly resemble; indeed, I find the name occurring as\r\nsuch in the case of ‘Walter le Persone,’ found in the Parliamentary\r\nRolls. Well would it be if we could say of each village cure now what\r\nour great early poet said of one he pictured forth—\r\n\r\n               A good man there was of religioun,\r\n               That was a poure Persone of a town,\r\n               But riche he was of holy thought and werk,\r\n               He was also a lerned man, a clerk,\r\n               That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Priests’ and ‘Priestmans’[173] answer for themselves. ‘Thomas le\r\nPrestre’ and ‘Peter le Prest,’ I do not doubt myself, were but other\r\nchanges rung upon the same, but I shall have occasion hereafter to\r\npropose, at least, a different origin for the latter. The lower\r\nministerial office is suggested to us in ‘Philip le Dekene’ and ‘Thomas\r\nle Deken,’ but we must be careful not to confound them with ‘Deakin,’\r\nwhich is often but another form of ‘Dakin,’ that is, ‘Dawkin,’ or\r\n‘little David.’[174] Our ‘Chaplains’ or ‘Chaplins,’ once written more\r\nfully as ‘Reginald le Chapeleine,’ represent less one who officiated in\r\nany public sanctuary than him who was attached to some private oratory\r\nbelonging to one of the higher nobility. Our ‘Chanters’ or ‘Canters’\r\n(‘Xtiana le Chauntour,’ A., ‘William le Chantour,’ M.) still maintain\r\nthe dignity of the old precentors who led the collegiate or cathedral\r\nchoir—but the once existing ‘Chanster’ (‘Stephen le Chanster,’ J.),\r\nstrictly speaking the feminine of the other, is now obsolete.[175] In\r\nour ‘Chancellors’ we may recognise the ancient ‘John le Chanceler’ or\r\n‘Geoffry le Chaunceler,’ he to whose care was committed the chapter,\r\nbooks, scrolls, records, and what other literature belonged to the\r\nestablishment with which he stood connected. ‘Clerk’ as connected with\r\nthe Church has come down in the world, for as ‘clericus,’ or\r\n‘clergyman,’ it once belonged entirely to the ordained ministry.[176]\r\nThe introduction of lay-clerks, appointed to lead the responses of the\r\ncongregation, has, however, connected them all but wholly with this\r\nlater office. Nor have our ‘Secretans,’ or ‘Sextons,’ or ‘Saxtons’\r\npreserved their early dignity. The sacristan was he who had charge of\r\nthe church-edifice, especially the robes and vestments, and such things\r\nas appertained to the actual service.[177] The present usually accepted\r\nmeaning of the term, that understood by our great humorist poet when he\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n                    He went and _told_ the sexton,\r\n                    And the sexton _tolled_ the bell,\r\n\r\nis quite of later growth. In our ‘Colets’ and ‘Collets’ (sometimes the\r\ndiminutives of ‘Colin’) we are reminded of the colet, or acolyte, who\r\nwaited upon the priest and assisted in carrying the bread and wine, in\r\nlighting the candles, and performing all subordinate duties. Our\r\n‘Bennets,’ when not belonging to the class of baptismal names (as a\r\ncorruption of ‘Benedict’), once performed the functions of exorcists,\r\nand by the imposition of hands and the aspersion of holy water expelled\r\nevil spirits from those said to be thus possessed. Last of this group we\r\nmay mention our ‘Croziers’ and ‘Crosiers,’ they who at this time bore\r\nthe pastoral staff. Mediæval forms of these are met with in ‘Simon le\r\nCroyzer’ or ‘Mabel la Croiser.’ I doubt not that he was a kind of\r\nchaplain to his superior, whose official staff it was his duty to bear.\r\nIn the Book of Common Prayer of the 2nd year of Edward VI. it is\r\ndirected: ‘Whensoever the bishop shall celebrate the holy communion, or\r\nexecute any other public office, he shall have upon him, besides his\r\nrochet, an alb and cope, or vestment, and also his pastoral staff in his\r\nhand, or else borne by his chaplain.’\r\n\r\nWhen we turn our eyes for a moment to the old monastic institutions, we\r\nsee that they, too, are far from being without their relics. In them we\r\nhave more distinctly the echo of a departed time. Many of my readers\r\nwill be familiar with the distinction recorded in such names as\r\n‘Alexander le Seculer’ and ‘Walter le Religieuse,’ or ‘man of religion,’\r\nas Chaucer would have termed the latter. To be ‘_religious_’ in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries was to be one of a monastic order\r\nbound by vows. Thus our great mediæval poet says in his Romance—\r\n\r\n                    Religious folk ben full covert,\r\n                    Secular folke ben more apert,\r\n                    But natheless, I will not blame\r\n                    Religious folke, ne them defame\r\n                    In what habite that ever they go;\r\n                    Religion humble, and true also,\r\n                    Will I not blame, ne despise.\r\n\r\nThe ‘religieuse’ has apparently stuck to his vows, for I have never\r\nfound the term in an hereditary form, while ‘Secular,’ as descended from\r\nsuch enrolled folk as ‘Walter le Secular,’ or ‘Joan, uxor Nicholas le\r\nSecular,’ still exists. I am afraid, however, the Secularist of that\r\ntime could and would have told us a different tale. Of these bound\r\norders too, while the general term, as I say, does not now exist\r\nsurnominally, all the more particular titles which it embraced do. As we\r\ncatch the cadence of their names a shadow falls athwart our memories,\r\nand in its wake a crowd of dim and unsubstantial figures pass before us.\r\nOnce more we behold the fiery ‘Abbot’ (Juliana Abbot, A., Ralph le Abbe,\r\nC.), and the portly ‘Prior’ or ‘Pryor’ (Roger le Priour, B., William le\r\nPriur, E.). We see afresh the ‘Friar,’ or ‘Freere,’ or ‘Frere’ (Syward\r\nle Frere, A., Geoffrey le Frere, A.), so ‘pleasant of absolution’ and\r\n‘easy of penance.’ Again our eye falls mistily upon the ‘Canon,’ or\r\n‘Cannon’ (William le Cannon, A., Thomas le Canun, E.), with his\r\nwell-trimmed beard and capped brow, and the ‘Moyne’ (now ‘Munn’) or\r\n‘Monk’ (Beatrix le Munk, A., Thomas le Mun, A., Ivo le Moyne, A.), all\r\nclosely shaved and cloaked, and cowled, that knew his way to the cellar\r\nbetter than to the chapel, who loved the song more than the chaunt.[178]\r\nAnd now in quick succession flit by us a train of personages all\r\nbeshrouded in garbs of multitudinous and quaint aspect, in cloaks and\r\nhoods, and tippets and girdles, and white and dark apparel. There is the\r\nwimpled, grey-eyed ‘Nunn’ (Alice la Nonne, A.), and the Dorturer,\r\nrepresented in olden registers by such a name as ‘Robert le Dorturer,’\r\nhe who looked to the arrangements of the dourtour, or dormitory—\r\n\r\n             His death saw I by revelation,\r\n             Sayde this frere, at home in our dortour.[179]\r\n\r\nThe word still existed in the sixteenth century, as is evidenced by\r\nHeywood’s use of it. He says—\r\n\r\n           The tongue is assigned of wordes to be sorter;\r\n           The mouth is assigned to be the tongue’s _dorter_;\r\n           The teeth are assigned to be the tongue’s porter;\r\n           But wisdom is ’signed to tye the tongue shorter.\r\n\r\nThe figure is somewhat forced, but it has its beauty. The ‘Fermerer,’\r\nnow found as ‘Fermor’ and ‘Firmer,’ was he who superintended the\r\ninfirmary. Only a few lines further on, in the earlier of the two poems\r\nfrom which I last quoted, we find Chaucer making mention of—\r\n\r\n                       Our sexton, and our fermerere,\r\n                 That have been trewe freres fifty year.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Tale of a Monk,’ too, begins—\r\n\r\n                    A black munk of an abbaye\r\n                    Was enfermer of alle I herd say—\r\n                    He was halden an hali man\r\n                    Imange his felaus.\r\n\r\nThe fermery was the hospital or ‘spital’[180] attached to each religious\r\nhouse, and was under the immediate control of the above-mentioned\r\nofficer. It is with him, therefore, we may fitly ally ‘Robert le\r\nAlmoner,’ or ‘Michael le Aumoner,’ a name still abiding with us, and\r\nrepresentative of him who dispensed the alms to the lazars and the poor.\r\nIt is in allusion to this his office that Robert Brunne in one of his\r\ntales says:—\r\n\r\n                     Seynt Jone, the aumenere,[181]\r\n                     Saith Pers, was an okerere\r\n                     And was very coveytous\r\n                     And a niggard and avarus.\r\n\r\nOf the same officer in more lordly society the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ thus\r\nspeaks—\r\n\r\n                The Aumonere a rod schalle have in honde,\r\n                An office for almes, I understonde;\r\n                Alle the broken mete he kepys in wait\r\n                To dele to pore men at the gate.\r\n\r\nMany of those who were supported at this time and in this manner were\r\nlepers. We can take up no record, large or small, of the period without\r\ncoming across a ‘Nicholas’ or ‘Walter le Leper.’ Leprosy was introduced\r\ninto Western Europe with the return of the Crusaders. To such a degree\r\nhad it spread in England, that in 1346 Edward III. was compelled to\r\nissue a royal mandate enjoining those ‘smitten with the blemish of\r\nleprosy’ to ‘betake themselves to places in the country, solitary, and\r\nnotably distant’ from the dwellings of men. Such a distinctive\r\ndesignation as this would readily cling to a man, even after he had been\r\ncured of the disorder,[182] and no wonder that in our ‘Lepers’ and\r\n‘Leppers’ the name still remains as but one more memorial of that noble\r\nmadness which set Christendom ablaze some six centuries ago. A term used\r\nsynonymously at this time with leper is found in such an entry as\r\n‘Richard le Masele’ or ‘Richard le Masle,’ that is, ‘Measle.’ Wicklyffe\r\nhas the word in the case of Naaman, and also of the Samaritan\r\nleper.[183] Langland speaks of those who are afflicted with various\r\nailments, and adds that they, if they\r\n\r\n                     Take these myschiefs meeklike,\r\n                     As mesels, and others,\r\n                     Han as pleyn pardon\r\n                     As the plowman hymselve.\r\n\r\nCapgrave, too, to quote but one more instance, speaking of Deodatus, a\r\nPope of the seventh century, says ‘He kissed a mysel and sodeynly the\r\nmysel was whole.’ Strange to say, this name also is not extinct. Our\r\n‘Badmans’ are not so bad as they might seem. They, and our ‘Bidmans,’\r\nare doubtless but corrupted forms of the old ‘bedeman,’ or ‘beadman,’ he\r\nwho professionally invoked Heaven in behalf of his patron. It is hence\r\nwe get our word ‘bead,’ our forefathers having been accustomed to score\r\noff the number of aves and paternosters they said by means of these\r\nsmall balls strung on a thread. This practice, I need not say, is still\r\nfamiliar to the Romish Church.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done with the traces of these more distant\r\npractices. The various religious wanderers or solitary recluses, though\r\nbelonging to a system long faded from our English life, find a perpetual\r\nepitaph in the directories of to-day. Thus we have still our ‘Pilgrims,’\r\nor ‘Pelerins’ (‘John Pelegrim,’ A., ‘William le Pelerin,’ E.), as the\r\nNormans termed them. We may meet with ‘Palmers’ (‘Hervey le Palmer,’ A.,\r\n‘John le Paumer,’ M.) any day in the streets of our large towns, names\r\ndistinctly relating the manner in which their owners have derived their\r\ntitle. The pilgrim may have but visited the shrine of St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury; the latter, as his sobriquet proves, had, forlorn and weary,\r\nbattled against all difficulties, and trod the path that led to the Holy\r\nSepulchre—\r\n\r\n                 The faded palm-branch in his hand\r\n                 Showed pilgrim from the Holy Land.[184]\r\n\r\nThe ‘Pardoner,’ with his pouch choked to the full (‘Walter le Pardoner,’\r\nM.) with saleable indulgences, had but come from Rome. He was an\r\nitinerant retailer of ecclesiastic forgivenesses, and was as much a\r\nquack as those who still impose upon the credulity of the bucolic mind\r\nby selling cheap medicines. As Chaucer says of him—\r\n\r\n               With feigned flattering and japes,\r\n               He made the parson and the peple his apes.\r\n\r\n‘Hermit’ I have failed to find as at present existing, though\r\n‘Hermitage’ or ‘Armitage’ (‘John Harmaytayge,’ W. 3), as local names\r\nexpressive of his abode, are by no means unfamiliar. Our ‘Anchors’ and\r\n‘Ankers,’ however, still live to commemorate the old ancre or anchorite;\r\nhe who, as his sobriquet implied, was wont to separate himself from the\r\nworld’s vain pleasures and dwell in seclusion and solitude. In the\r\n‘Romance of the Rose’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                     Sometime I am religious,\r\n                     Now like an anker in an house.\r\n\r\nPiers in his ‘Vision,’ too, speaks of—\r\n\r\n                    Ancres and heremites\r\n                    That holden them in their celles.\r\n\r\n‘Hugh le Eremite’ or ‘Silvester le Hermite’ are early forms of the one,\r\nwhile in the other case we find the aspirate added in ‘John le Haneker.’\r\nThe modern dress of this latter, however, presents the usual early and\r\nmore correct spelling.[185] What a vision is presented for our notice in\r\nthese various sobriquets. It is the vision of a day that has faded, a\r\nday with many gleams of redeeming light, but a day of ignorance and\r\nlethargy; a day which, after all, thank God, was but the precursor of\r\nthe brighter day of the Reformation, when the Church, true to herself\r\nand true to her destiny, threw off the shackles and the fetters that\r\nbound her, and began a work which her greatest foes have been compelled\r\nto admit she carried through amid opposition of the deadliest and most\r\ncrushing kind.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to a survey of our feudal aristocracy, I may mention\r\nour ‘Latimers,’ or ‘le Latymer,’ as I find it recorded in early lists. A\r\nlatinier, or latimer, was literally a speaker or writer of Latin, that\r\nlanguage being then the vehicle of all record or transcript. Latin,\r\nindeed, for centuries was the common ground on which all European\r\necclesiastics met. Thus it became looked upon as the language of\r\ninterpretation. The term I am speaking of, however, seems to have become\r\ngeneral at an early stage. An old lyric says—\r\n\r\n                       Lyare was mi latymer,\r\n                       Sloth and sleep mi bedyner.\r\n\r\nSir John Maundeville, describing an eastern route, says (I am quoting\r\nMr. Lower)—‘And men alleweys fynden Latyneres to go with them in the\r\ncontrees and furthere beyonde in to tyme that men conne the language.’\r\nTeachers of the Latin tongue itself were not wanting. ‘Le Scholemayster’\r\nexisted so early as the twelfth century to show that there were those\r\nwho professed to initiate our English youth in the rudiments of that\r\nwhich was a polite and liberal education in the eyes of that period.\r\nSuch sobriquets as ‘le Gramayre,’ or ‘Gramary,’ or ‘Grammer,’\r\nrepresented the same avocation, being nothing more than the old Norman\r\n‘Gramaire,’ or ‘Grammarian’ as we should now call him, only we now apply\r\nthe term to a philologist rather than a professional teacher. As\r\n‘Grammar’ the surname is far from being obsolete in our midst. A\r\n‘Nicholas le Lessoner’ is met with in the Hundred Rolls. He was\r\nevidently but a schoolmaster also. The verb ‘to lesson,’ _i.e._ to\r\nteach, is still in use in various parts of the country, and we find even\r\nShakespeare using it. Clarence says to his murderer—\r\n\r\n              Bid Gloster think of this, and he will weep;\r\n\r\nto which the murderer replies—\r\n\r\n               Ay, millstones; as he lessoned us to weep.\r\n                       (_Richard III._, act. i. sc. iii.)\r\n\r\nIn looking over the pages of our early Anglo-Norman history we are at\r\nonce struck by the fact of the absence of any middle class; that\r\nimportant branch of our community which in after and more civilised ages\r\nhas done so much for English liberty and English strength. The whole\r\ngenius of the feudal constitution was opposed to this. There was indeed\r\na graduating scale of feudal tenure which bound together and connected\r\neach community; but there was of equal surety in the chain of these\r\nindependent links of society a certain ring where all alliance ceased\r\nsave that of service, and which separated each provincial society into\r\ntwo widely-sundered classes. On the one side were the baron and his\r\nnearer feudatories and retainers; and below this, on the other, came\r\nunder one common standard the villein, the peasant, and the boor, looked\r\nupon by their superiors with contemptuous indifference, and barely\r\nendured as necessary to the administration of their luxury and pleasure.\r\nWe have already mentioned many of those who gave the baron support. Of\r\nother his vassals we may cite ‘le Vavasour,’ or ‘Valvasor,’ a kind of\r\nmiddle-class landowner. The lower orders of chivalry have left us in our\r\nmany ‘Knights’[186] and ‘Bachelors’ or ‘Backlers’ a plentiful token of\r\nformer importance. Our ‘Squiers,’ ‘Squires,’ ‘Swiers,’ or ‘Swires’[187]\r\ncarry us, as does the now meaningless Esquire, to the time when the sons\r\nof those ‘Knights’ bore, as the name implies, their shields. By the time\r\nof Henry VI., however, it had become adopted by the heirs of the higher\r\ngentry, and now it is used indiscriminately enough. Those who are so\r\nsurnamed may comfort themselves at any rate with the reflection that\r\nthey are lineally descended from those who bore the name when it was an\r\nhonourable and distinctive title. ‘Armiger,’ the form in which the word\r\nwas oftentimes recorded in our Latin rolls, still survives, though\r\nbarely, in our ‘Armingers,’ this corrupted form being in perfect harmony\r\nwith all similar instances, as we shall see almost immediately. One of\r\nour mediæval rhymes speaks of—\r\n\r\n                  Ten thousand knights stout and fers,\r\n                  Withouten hobelers and squyers.\r\n\r\nThese hobelers are far from being uninteresting. When we talk of riding\r\na hobby, we little think what a history is concealed beneath the term. A\r\nhobiler[188] in the days we are speaking of, was one who held by tenure\r\nof maintaining a hobbie—a kind of small horse, then familiarly so known.\r\nA song on the times, written in the fourteenth century, and complaining\r\nof the manner in which the upper classes plundered the poor, says:—\r\n\r\n                 And those hoblurs, namelich,\r\n                 That husband benimeth eri of ground,\r\n                 Men ne should them bury in none chirch,\r\n                 But cast them out as a hound.\r\n\r\nLater on, by its fictitious representation in the Morris dances of the\r\nMay-day sports, the hobby came to denote the mere dummy, and now as such\r\naffords much scope for equestrian skill in the Rotten Row of our\r\nnurseries. What tricks time plays with these words, to be sure, and what\r\na connexion for our ‘Hoblers’ and ‘Hobblers’ to meditate upon. Our\r\n‘Bannermans’ are Scotch, but they represent an office, whether in\r\nEngland or the North, whose importance it would be hard to estimate at\r\nthis period. Nor are we without traces in our nomenclature of its\r\nexistence in more southern districts. Our not unfamiliar ‘Pennigers’ and\r\n‘Pennigars’ are but the former official _pennager_, he who bore the\r\nensign or standard of his lord. They figure even in more general and\r\nfestive pageants. In the York Procession we find walking alone and\r\nbetween the different craftsmen the ‘Pennagers.’ Probably they bore the\r\nensigns of that then important corporate city. I have but recently\r\nreferred to ‘Robert Clavynger’ (H.) and the probability of his having\r\ncarried the club or mace or key of his superiors in office. All or\r\nwell-nigh all the above names find themselves well represented in the\r\nregisters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Our eye falls at\r\nonce on an ‘Andrew le Gramary,’ a ‘Richard le Gramayre,’ a ‘Thomas le\r\nSkolmayster,’ a ‘Warin le Latimer,’ a ‘William le Latiner,’ a ‘Jordan le\r\nVavasur,’ a ‘Simon le Knyt,’ a ‘Gilbert le Bacholer,’ a ‘Walter le\r\nSquier,’ or a ‘Nicholas Armiger.’\r\n\r\nA curious relic of the military tactics of mediæval times is presented\r\nto our notice in our ‘Reuters,’ ‘Ritters,’ and ‘Rutters.’ The old\r\nEnglish forms are found in such entries as ‘Thomas le Reuter,’ or\r\n‘Ranulph le Ruter.’ The root of the term is probably the German ritter,\r\nor rider, a name given at this period to certain mercenary soldiers\r\noftentimes hired by our English sovereigns out of Brabant and the\r\nsurrounding country. Thus we find William of Newburgh, under the date\r\n1173, saying that Henry II. ‘stipendarias Bribantionum copias, quas\r\nRutas vocant, accersivit.’ (Lib. ii. cap. 27.) Trivet, relating the same\r\nfact, says (p. 73), ‘Conduxit Brabanzones et Rutarios.’[189] An old song\r\nbegins—\r\n\r\n                 Rutterkyn is come into owre towne,\r\n                 In a cloke withoute cote or gowne,\r\n                 Save a raggid hood to kover his crowne\r\n                                Like a rutter hoyda.\r\n                 Rutterkyn can speke no Englyssh,\r\n                 His tonge runneth all on buttyrd fyssh,\r\n                 Besmeared with grece abowte his disshe,\r\n                                   Like a rutter hoyda.\r\n\r\nThe nickname ‘rutterkin’ proves the Flemish origin of these troopers.\r\nTheir capacity for stowing away food and drink, from all accounts, is\r\nnot exaggerated in the poem from which the above is an extract. We have\r\njust mentioned our ‘Bachelors,’ and this reminds us of our ‘Childs,’ and\r\nof the days of chivalry. The term ‘child’ was a distinctly honourable\r\ntitle in the olden times. It was borne by the sons of all the higher\r\nnobility; if by the eldest son, then in right of his title to his\r\nfather’s honours and possessions; if more generally by others, then\r\nuntil by some deed of prowess they had been raised to the ranks of\r\nknighthood. In either case ‘child’ was the term in use during this\r\nprobationary state. Thus Byron in his ‘Childe Harold’ has but revived\r\nthe ‘Childe Waters,’ ‘Childe Rolands,’ and ‘Childe Thopas’s’ of earlier\r\ntimes.[190] We owe many existing and several obsolete surnames to this\r\ncustom. Our ‘Childs’ are but descendants of such a sobriquet as ‘Ralph\r\nle Child;’ our ‘Eyres’ of such an entry as ‘William le Eyre;’ some of\r\nour ‘Barnes’ may be but the offspring of such a personage as ‘Thomas le\r\nBarne’ (now ‘bairn,’ that is, the born one); while ‘Stephen le Enfant’\r\nor ‘Walter le Enfaunt’ represents an appellation that is now obsolete in\r\nEngland.[191] I need scarcely add that this last, in the form of Infante\r\nand Infanta, still bears the same meaning in the royal families of Spain\r\nthat Child did in our own land in more chivalric days.\r\n\r\nThe details of early feudal life are wonderfully depicted by our\r\nnomenclature. Owing to the boundless and forced ceremony which arose out\r\nof the prevailing spirit of feudal pride, our official memorials are\r\nwell-nigh overwhelming. Feudal tenure itself became associated with\r\noffice, and none seemed too servile for acceptance. As has been said of\r\nCharlemagne’s Court, so might it be said of those of others—‘they were\r\ncrowded with officers of every rank, some of the most eminent of whom\r\nexercised functions about the royal person which would have been thought\r\nfit only for slaves in the palace of Augustus or Antonine’—‘to carry his\r\nbanner or his lance, to lead his array, to be his marshall, or\r\nconstable, or sewer, or carver, to do in fact such services, trivial or\r\notherwise, as his lord might have done himself, in proper person, had it\r\nso pleased him—this was the position coveted by youths of birth and\r\ndistinction at such a period as this.’ Many of these officerships, or\r\nthe bare titles, still linger round the court of our sovereign. The\r\nhigher feudatories, of course, followed the example thus set them by\r\ntheir suzerain, and the lesser barons these, and thus household officers\r\nsprang up on every side. See how this has left its mark upon our\r\nsurnames. ‘John le Conestable,’ or ‘Robert le Constable,’ I need not\r\nsay, is still well represented. In the ‘Man of Lawes Tale’ the poet\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n                The constable of the castel doun is fare\r\n                To see this wreck.\r\n\r\nWith him we may ally our not unfamiliar ‘Castlemans,’ ‘Castelans,’ and\r\n‘Chatelains,’ representatives of the old ‘John le Chastilioun,’ or\r\n‘Joscelin le Castelan,’ or ‘Ralph le Chatelaine.’ The poet whom I have\r\njust quoted says elsewhere:—\r\n\r\n                     Now am I king, now chastelaine.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this latter was but a synonym of the constable, and his duties\r\nas governor but the same. Of decidedly lower position, but not\r\ndissimilar in character, we have also ‘Wybert le Portere,’ or\r\n‘Portarius,’ as he is Latinized in our rolls. An old book of etiquette\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n                  When thou comes to a lordis gate\r\n                  The porter thou shalle fynde therate.\r\n\r\nHe at the postern would as carefully look against hostile, as our former\r\n‘Peter le Ussher,’ or ‘Alan le Usser,’ within would against informal\r\napproach.[192] The Saxon form, however, was evidently not wanting, for\r\nwe have still ‘Doorward’ and ‘Doorman’ (‘Geoffrey le Doreward,’ A.,\r\n‘Nicholas le Doreman,’ O.) in our directories, not to mention their\r\ncorrupted, ‘Durwards,’ immortalized by Walter Scott, and ‘Dormans’ and\r\n‘Domans.’ The term ‘doorward’ is found in many of our early writers.\r\nThus in an old metrical account of the bringing of Christ before\r\nCaiaphas, it is said of John when he returned to fetch in Peter:—\r\n\r\n                           He bid the dureward\r\n                           Let in his fere.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Chamberlaynes’ and ‘Chambers,’[193] (‘Simon le Chamberlain,’ M.,\r\n‘Henry le Chaumberleyne,’ B., ‘William de la Chaumbre,’ B.) had access\r\nto their lord’s inner privacy, and from their intimacy with his monetary\r\naffairs occupied a position at times similar to that of our more\r\ncollegiate bursar. We have only to look at mediæval costume, its\r\ngrandeur, its colours, and its varied array, to understand how necessary\r\nthere should be a special officer to superintend his lord’s wardrobe.\r\nOur ‘Wardrops’ are but the former ‘de la Wardrobe,’ or ‘de la\r\nGarderoba,’ while ‘le Wardrober,’ or ‘le Garderober,’ has bequeathed us\r\nour ‘Wardropers.’ Thus the ‘Book of Curtasye’ says:—\r\n\r\n               The usshere shalle bydde the wardropere\r\n               Make redy for alle, night before they fere.\r\n\r\nEqually important as an attendant was the ‘Barbour.’ He especially was\r\non familiar terms with his master—when was he not? I need scarcely say\r\nthat among his other duties that of acting as surgeon in the household\r\nwas none of the lightest. Still his tonsorial capacity was his first\r\none. No one then thought of shaving himself, least of all the baron.\r\nEven so late as the sixteenth century a writer defending the use of the\r\nbeard against Andrew Boorde employs this argument:—\r\n\r\n                But, syre, I praye you, if you tell can,\r\n                Declare to me, when God made man\r\n                (I meane by our forefather Adam),\r\n                Whether that he had a berde then;\r\n                And if he had, who did hym shave,\r\n                Since that a barber he could not have.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt it is here we must set our ‘Simisters,’ relics, as they\r\nprobably are, of such a name as ‘John Somayster,’ or ‘William\r\nSummister.’ The summaster seems from its orthography to have represented\r\none who acted as a clerk or comptroller, something akin to the\r\nchamberlain or breviter, whom I shall mention almost immediately; one,\r\nin fact, who cast up and certified accounts. Holinshed used the word as\r\nif in his day it were of familiar import. Dwelling upon a certain event,\r\nhe says—‘Over this, if the historian be long, he is accompted a trifler;\r\nif he be short, he is taken for a summister.’[194]\r\n\r\nIn such days as those, what with the number of personal retainers and\r\nthe excess of hospitality expected of the feudal chief, the culinary\r\ndepartment occupied far from an insignificant position in regard to the\r\ngeneral accessories of the baronial establishment. Our ‘Cooks,’ or\r\n‘Cokes,’ or ‘Cookmans,’ relics of the old ‘Roger le Coke,’ or ‘Joan le\r\nCook,’ or ‘William Cokeman,’ even then ruled supreme over that most\r\nabsolute of all monarchies, the kitchen; our ‘Kitchenmans’ (now found\r\nalso as ‘Kitchingham’), ‘Kitcheners,’ and ‘Kitchens,’ or ‘de la\r\nKitchens,’ as they were once written, reminding us who it was that aided\r\nthem to turn the spit or handle the posnet. Our ‘Pottingers’ represent\r\nthe once common ‘Robert le Potager,’ or ‘Walter le Potager,’ the\r\nsoup-maker. _Potage_ was the ordinary term for soup, thickened well with\r\nvegetables and meat.[195] Thus in the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ the guest is\r\nbid—\r\n\r\n                     Suppe not with grete sowndynge,\r\n                     Neither potage ne other thynge—\r\n\r\na rule which still holds good in society. We are well aware of the\r\ningredients of the dish which our Bible translators have still\r\nbequeathed to us as ‘a mess of potage.’ In its present corrupted form of\r\n‘porridge’ this notion of a _mess_ rather than of a _soup_ is still\r\npreserved. Another interesting servitorship of this class has well-nigh\r\nescaped our notice—that of the hastiler: he who turned the _haste_ or\r\nspit. In the Close Rolls we find a ‘Thurstan le Hastler’ recorded, and\r\nin the Parliamentary Writs such names as ‘Henry Hastiler’ and ‘William\r\nHastiler.’ In the will of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Essex, among other\r\nhousehold servants, such as potager, ferour, barber, ewer, is mentioned\r\n‘William de Barton, hastiler.’ I need not remind Lancashire people that\r\na _haister_, or _haster_, is still the term used for the tin screen\r\nemployed for roasting purposes. The memorials of this interesting\r\nservitorship still linger on in our ‘Hastlers,’ ‘Haslers,’ and\r\n‘Haselers.’ If, however, the supervision of the roasting and basting\r\nrequired an attendant, none the less was it so with the washing-up\r\ndepartment. How familiarly does such a term as ‘scullery’ fall from our\r\nlips, and how little do many of us know of its history. An\r\n_escuelle_[196] was a porringer or dish, and a _scullery_ was a place\r\nwhere such vessels were stored after being washed.[197] Hence a\r\n‘squiller’ or ‘squyler’ was he who looked to this; our modern\r\n‘scullion,’ in fact, which is but a corrupted form of the same word. In\r\none of Robert of Brunne’s poems, we find him saying—\r\n\r\n              And the squyler of the kechyn,\r\n              Piers, that hath woned (dwelt) here yn.[198]\r\n\r\nIn a book of ‘Ordinances and Regulations’ we find mention made even of a\r\n‘sergeant-squylloure.’ Doubtless his duty was to look after the carriage\r\nof utensils at such times as his lord made any extended journey, or to\r\nsuperintend the washing of cup and platter after the open-board\r\nfestivities which were the custom of early baronial establishments. To\r\nprovide for every retainer who chanced to come in would be, indeed, a\r\ncare. The occurrence of a ‘Roger de Norhamtone, Squyler,’ however, in\r\nthe London City rolls, seems to imply that occasionally the sale of such\r\nvessels gave the title. I cannot say the name is obsolete, as I have met\r\nwith one ‘Squiller;’ and ‘Skiller,’ which would seem to be a natural\r\ncorruption, is not uncommon. Our ‘Spencers,’ abbreviated from\r\n‘despencer,’ had an important charge—that of the ‘buttery,’ or ‘spence,’\r\nthe place where the household store was kept. The term is still in use,\r\nI believe, in our country farm-houses. In the ‘Sumner’s Tale’ the\r\nglutton is well described as—\r\n\r\n                  All vinolent as botel in the spence;\r\n\r\nand Mr. Halliwell, I see, with his wonted research, has lighted on the\r\nfollowing lines:—\r\n\r\n                   Yet I had lever she and I\r\n                   Were both togyther secretly\r\n                   In some corner in the spence.[199]\r\n\r\n‘De la Spence,’ as well as ‘le Spencer,’ has impressed itself upon our\r\nliving nomenclature. Our ‘Panters,’ ‘Pantlers,’ and ferocious-seeming\r\n‘Panthers,’ descendants of such folk as ‘Richard le Panter,’ or ‘Robert\r\nle Paneter,’ or ‘Henry de le Paneterie,’ are but relics of a similar\r\noffice. They had the superintendence of the ‘paneterie,’ or pantry;\r\nliterally, of course, the bread closet. It seems, however, early to have\r\nbecome used in a wider and more general sense. In the Household\r\nOrdinances of Edward IV. one of the sergeants is styled ‘the chief\r\nPantrer of the King’s mouth.’ John Russel in his ‘Boke of Nurture’ thus\r\ndirects his student—\r\n\r\n   The furst yere, my son, thou shalt be pantere or buttilare,\r\n   Thou must have three knyffes kene in pantry, I sey thee, evermare,\r\n   One knyfe the loaves to choppe, another them for to pare,\r\n   The third, sharp and kene, to smothe the trenchers and square.[200]\r\n\r\nOf the old ‘Achatour’ (found as ‘Henry le Catour’ or ‘Bernard le\r\nAcatour’), the purveyor for the establishment, we have many memorials,\r\nthose of ‘Cater,’ ‘Cator,’ and ‘Caterer’ being the commonest. Chaucer\r\nquaintly remarks of the ‘Manciple,’[201] who was so\r\n\r\n                       Wise in buying of victuals,\r\n\r\nthat of him\r\n\r\n                    Achatours mighten take ensample.\r\n\r\nThe provisions thus purchased were called ‘cates,’ a favourite word with\r\nsome of our later poets. Equivalent to the more monastic ‘le\r\nCellarer,’[202] which is now obsolete, are our numberless ‘Butlers,’ the\r\nmost accepted form of the endless ‘Teobald le Botilers,’ ‘Richer le\r\nBotillers,’ ‘Ralph le Botelers,’ ‘William le Botellers,’ ‘Walter le\r\nButillers,’ or ‘Hugh le Buteilliers,’ of this time. As we shall observe\r\nby-and-by, however, this was also an occupative name.[203]\r\n\r\nWith so many officers to look after the preparations, we should expect\r\nthe dinner itself to be somewhat ceremonious. And so it was—far more\r\nceremonious, however, than elegant in the light of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Our ‘Senechals’ and ‘Senecals’ (‘Alexander le Seneschal,’ B.,\r\n‘Ivo Seneschallus,’ T.), relics of the ancient ‘seneschal,’ Latinized in\r\nour records as ‘Dapifer’ (‘Henry Dapifer,’ A.), arranged the table. The\r\nroot of this word is the Saxon ‘schalk,’ a servant which, though now\r\nwholly obsolete, seems to have been in familiar use in early times.[204]\r\nAn old poem tells us—\r\n\r\n              Then the schalkes sharply shift their horses,\r\n              To show them seemly in their sheen weeds.\r\n\r\nIn ‘Sir Gawayne,’ too, the attendant is thus described—\r\n\r\n                                Clene spurs under\r\n      Of bright golde, upon silk bordes, barred full rich,\r\n      And scholes (depending) under shanks, there the schalk rides.\r\n\r\nWe are not without traces of its existence in other compounds. Thus our\r\n‘Marshalls’ were originally ‘marechals;’ that is, ‘mare-schalks,’ the\r\nearly name for a horse-groom or blacksmith. The Marshall, however, was\r\nearly turned into an indoor office, and seems to have been busied enough\r\nin ordering the position of guests in the hall, a very punctilious\r\naffair in those days. The ‘Boke of Curtasye’ says:—\r\n\r\n                In halle marshalle alle men schalle sett,\r\n                After their degre, withouten lett.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Gateschales,’ a name now altogether obsolete, were the more simple\r\nporter, while our ‘Gottschalks,’ a surname more frequently hailing from\r\nGermany, but once common with ourselves as a Christian name, denote\r\nsimply ‘God’s servant.’ But we are wandering. Let us come back to the\r\ndinner-table. Such sobriquets as ‘Ralph le Suur’[205] or ‘John le Sewer’\r\nremind us of the _sewer_—he who brought in the viands.[206] A _sewe_,\r\nfrom the old French sevre, to follow, was any cooked dish, and thus is\r\nsimply equivalent to our _course_. Chaucer, in describing the rich\r\nfeasts of Cambuscan, King of Tartary, says the time would fail him to\r\ntell—\r\n\r\n                         Of their strange sewes.\r\n\r\nI believe the Queen’s household still boasts its four gentlemen sewers.\r\nAs a surname, too, the word is still common. A curious custom presents\r\nitself to our remembrance in our ‘Says,’ who, when not of the ‘de Says’\r\n(‘Hugh de Say,’ A.), are but descendants of the ‘le Says’ (‘John le\r\nSay,’ M.) of the Hundred Rolls. An ‘assay’ or ‘say’ was he who assayed\r\nor tasted the messes as they were set one by one before the baron, to\r\nguard against his being accidentally or purposely poisoned. An old poem\r\nuses the fuller form, where it says—\r\n\r\n                   Thine assayer schalle be an hownde,\r\n                   To assaye thy mete before thee.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Boke of Curtasye,’ too, we are told to what ranks this privilege\r\nbelonged—\r\n\r\n             No mete for man schalle sayed be,\r\n             But for kynge, or prynce, or duke so fre.[207]\r\n\r\nAnother term for the same made its mark upon our nomenclature as\r\n‘Gustur’ (‘Robert le Gustur,’ T.) To _gust_ was thus used till\r\nShakespeare’s day, and we still speak of ‘_gusto_’ as equivalent to\r\n_relish_.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded by the fact of the existence of ‘Knifesmith’ and\r\n‘Spooner’ only among our early occupative surnames that there were no\r\nforks in those days.[208] There is no ‘Forker’ to be found. Even the\r\n‘Carver’ (‘Adam le Kerver,’ A., ‘Richard le Karver,’ A.) had to use his\r\nfingers. In the ‘Boke of Kervynge,’ a manual of the then strictest\r\netiquette in such matters, we find the following direction:—‘Set never\r\non fyshe, flesche, beest, ne fowle, more than two fyngers and a thombe.’\r\nSeldom, too, did they use plates as we now understand them. Before each\r\nguest was set a round slice of bread called a trencher, and the meat\r\nbeing placed upon this, he consumed the whole, or as much as he pleased.\r\nUnder these circumstances we can easily understand how necessary would\r\nbe the office of ‘Ewer,’ a name found in every early roll as ‘Brian le\r\nEwer,’ or ‘Richard le Ewere,’ or ‘Adam de la Euerie.’ As he supplied\r\nwater for each to cleanse his hands he was close followed by the\r\n‘napper’ or ‘napier,’ who proffered the towel or napkin. The word, I\r\nneed scarcely say, is but a diminutive of the old _nape_, which was\r\napplied in general to the tablecloths and other linen used in setting\r\nforth the dinner. An old book, which I have already quoted, in directing\r\nthe attendant how to lay the cloth, says—\r\n\r\n                  The over nape schall double be layde.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Rolls and other records furnish us with such names as\r\n‘Jordan le Nappere,’ or ‘John le Napere,’ or ‘Walter de la Naperye.’\r\nBehind the lord of the board, nigh to his elbow, stood the ‘page,’\r\nholding his cup. This seems to have been an office much sought after by\r\nthe sons of the lower nobility, and it is to the honourable place in\r\nwhich it was held we no doubt owe the fact that not merely are our\r\n‘Pages’ decidedly numerous in the present day, but that we also find\r\nsuch further particular compounds as ‘Small-page,’[209] ‘Little-page,’\r\nor ‘Cup-page’ holding anything but a precarious existence in our midst.\r\nThere seems to have been but little difference between this office and\r\nthat of the ‘henchman,’ only that the latter, as his name, more strictly\r\nwritten ‘haunchman,’ shows, attended his master’s behests out of doors.\r\nHe, too, lives on hale and hearty in our ‘Henchmans,’ ‘Hinxmans,’\r\n‘Hincksmans,’ and ‘Hensmans.’[210]\r\n\r\nIn several of our early records of names we find ‘Peter le Folle,’\r\n‘Alexander le Fol,’ and ‘Johannes Stultus’ appearing in apparently\r\nhonest and decent company. The old fool or jester was an important\r\nentity in the retinue of the mediæval noble. He could at least say, if\r\nhe might not do, what he liked, and I am afraid the more ribald his\r\nbuffoonery the greater claim he possessed to be an adept in his\r\nprofession in the eyes of those who heard him. His dress was always in\r\ncharacter with his duties, being as uncouth as fashion reversed could\r\nmake it. In his hand he bore a mock rod of state, his head was\r\nsurmounted by a huge cap peaked at the summit and surrounded with little\r\njingling bells, his dress was in colour as conflicting as possible, and\r\nthe _tout ensemble_ I need not dwell upon. We still talk of a\r\n‘foolscap,’ and even our paper has preserved the term from the fact that\r\none of the earliest watermarks we have was that of a fool’s cap with\r\nbells. ‘Fools,’ I need not say, wherever else to be met with, are now\r\nobsolete so far as our directories are concerned.\r\n\r\nI have just mentioned the henchman. This at once carries us without the\r\nbaronial walls, and in whatever scene we are wont to regard the early\r\nsuzeraine as engaging, it is remarkable how fully marked is our\r\nnomenclature with its surroundings. Several useful servitorships,\r\nhowever, claim our first attention. In such days as these, when the\r\ntelegraph wire was an undreamt-of mystery, and highways traversed by\r\nsteam-engines would have been looked upon as something supernatural\r\nindeed, we can readily understand the importance of the official ‘Roger\r\nle Messager,’ or ‘John le Messager,’ nor need we be surprised by the\r\nfrequency with which he is met. In the ‘Man of Lawes Tale’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                  This messager to don his avantage\r\n                  Unto the Kinges mother rideth swift.\r\n\r\nThough generally found as ‘Messinger’ or ‘Massinger,’ the truer and more\r\nancient form is not wholly obsolete.[211] But if there were no\r\ntelegraphs, neither was there any regular system of postage. The name of\r\n‘Ely le Breviter’ or ‘Peter le Brevitour’ seems to remind us of this. I\r\ndo not doubt myself the ‘breviter’ was kept by his lord for the writing\r\nor conveyance of letters or brevets.[212] Piers Plowman uses the word\r\nwhere, of the Pardoner’s preaching, it is said—\r\n\r\n                     Lewed men loved it wel,\r\n                     And liked his wordes,\r\n                     Comen up knelynge\r\n                     To kissen his bulles.\r\n                     He bouched them with his brevet\r\n                     And blered their eighen.[213]\r\n\r\nThe signet of his lord was in the hands of the ‘Spigurnell’ or\r\n‘Spigurell,’ both of which forms still exist, I believe, in our general\r\nnomenclature. As the sealer of all the royal writs, the king’s spigurell\r\nwould have an office at once important and careful. The term itself is\r\nSaxon, its root implying that which is shut up or sealed. Our ‘Coffers,’\r\nrelics of the old ‘Ralph le Cofferer,’ or ‘John le Cofferer,’ though\r\nsomething occupative, were nevertheless official also, and are to be\r\nfound as such in the thirteenth century. They remind us of the day when\r\nthere were no such things as cheque-books, nor banks, nor a paper-money\r\ncurrency. Then on every expedition, be it warlike or peaceful, solid\r\ngold or silver had to be borne for the baron’s expenditure and that of\r\nhis retinue; therefore none would be more important than he who\r\nsuperintended the transit from place to place of the chest of solid\r\ncoinage set under his immediate care. Our early ‘Passavants,’ or\r\n‘Pursevaunts,’ or more literally pursuivants, were under the direction\r\nof the ‘Herald,’or ‘Heraud,’ as Chaucer styles him, and usually preceded\r\nthe royal or baronial retinue to announce its approach, and attend to\r\nsuch other duties of lesser importance as his superior delegated to him.\r\nIn this respect he occupied a position much akin to that of the\r\n‘Harbinger’ or ‘Herberger,’ who prepared the _harborage_ or lodging, and\r\nall other entertainment required ere the cavalcade arrived. When we\r\nreflect upon the large number of retainers, the ceremonious list of\r\nattendants, the greater impediments to early travel, and the\r\ndifficulties of forwarding information, we shall see that these\r\nofficerships were by no means so formal as we might be apt to imagine.\r\nTo give illustrations of all the above-mentioned surnames were easy,\r\nwere it not that the number is so large that it becomes a difficulty\r\nwhich to select. Such entries, however, as ‘Jacob le Messager,’ ‘Godfrey\r\nle Coffrer,’ ‘Roger Passavant,’ ‘Main le Heralt,’ ‘Herbert le\r\nHerberjur,’ ‘Nicholas le Spigurnell,’ ‘Peter le Folle,’ or the Latinized\r\n‘Johannes Stultus,’ may be recorded as among the more familiar. A\r\nreference to the Index will furnish examples of the rest, as well as\r\nadditional ones of the above.\r\n\r\nIn a day when horses were of more consequence than now, we need not be\r\nsurprised to find the baronial manger under special supervision. This\r\nofficer figures in our mediæval archives in such entries as ‘Walter le\r\nAvenur’ or ‘William le Avenare.’[214] As his very name suggests, it was\r\nthe avenar’s care to provide for the regular and sufficient feeding of\r\nthe animals placed under his charge.[215] The ‘Boke of Curtayse’ tells\r\nus his duties—\r\n\r\n               The aveyner shall ordeyn provande good won\r\n               For the lordys horsis everychon,\r\n               They schyn have two cast of hay,\r\n               A peck of provande on a day.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, too, the same writer says—\r\n\r\n                  A maystur of horsys a squyer ther is,\r\n                  Aveyner and ferour under him i-wys.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Palfreymans’ (‘John le Palfreyman,’ M.), though not always\r\nofficial, I do not doubt had duties also of a similar character in\r\nlooking after the well-being of their mistress’s palfrey, and attending\r\nthe lady herself when she rode to the cover, or took an airing on the\r\nmore open and breezy hillside.\r\n\r\nThe two great amusements of the period we are considering were the hunt\r\nand the tournament. Of the former we have many relics, nor is the latter\r\nbarren or unfruitful of terms connected therewith that still linger on\r\nin the surnames of to-day. The exciting encounters which took place in\r\nthese chivalric meetings or jousts had a charm alike for the Saxon and\r\nthe Norman; alike, too, for spectator as well as for him who engaged in\r\nthe fierce mêlée. Training for this was by no means left to the\r\ndiscretion of amateur intelligence. In three several records of the\r\nthirteenth century I find such names as ‘Peter le Eskurmesur,’ ‘Henry le\r\nEskyrmessur,’ and ‘Roger le Skirmisour.’ The root of these terms is, of\r\ncourse, the old French verb ‘eskirmir,’ to fence. It is thence we get\r\nour _skirmish_ and _scrimmage_, the latter form, though looked upon now\r\nas of a somewhat slang character, being found in the best of society in\r\nour earlier writers. Originally it denoted a hand-to-hand encounter\r\nbetween two horsemen. We still imply by a skirmish a short and sharp\r\nconflict between the advanced posts of two contending armies. As a\r\nteacher of ‘the noble art of self-defence,’[216] we can easily\r\nunderstand how important was the skirmisher. The name has become much\r\ncorrupted by lapse of time, scarcely recognisable, in fact, in such a\r\ngarb as ‘Scrimmenger,’ ‘Skrymsher,’ ‘Skrimshire,’ and perchance\r\n‘Scrimshaw,’ forms which I find in our present London and provincial\r\ndirectories. Of those who were wont to engage we have already mentioned\r\nthe majority. All the different grades of nobility were present, and\r\nwith them were their esquires, with shield and buckler, ready to supply\r\na fresh unsplintered lance, or a new shield, with its proudly emblazoned\r\ncrest. I need scarce remind the reader of what consequence in such a day\r\nas this would be the costume of him who thus engaged in such deadly\r\nconflict. The invention of gunpowder has changed the early tactics of\r\nfight. Battles are lost and won now long ere the real mêlée has taken\r\nplace. Then everything, whether in war or tournament, was settled face\r\nto face. To pierce his opponent where an inlet could admit his spear, or\r\nto unhorse him by the shock of meeting, was the knight’s one aim. The\r\nbloodiness of such an affray can be better imagined than described. We\r\nstill hear of distorted features in the after inspection of the scene of\r\nbattle, but we can have no conception of the mangling that the bodies of\r\nhorse and rider underwent, the inevitable result of the earlier manner\r\nof warfare. Death is mercifully quick now upon the battle-field. We have\r\nstill three or four professional surnames that remind us of this. We\r\nhave still our ‘Jackmans,’ or ‘Jakemans,’ as representatives of the\r\nformer cavalry; so called from the ‘jack’ or coat of mail they wore. It\r\nis this latter article which has bequeathed to our youngsters of the\r\nnineteenth century their more peaceful and diminutive _jacket_. Thus\r\nmailed and horsed, they had to encounter the cruel onslaught of our\r\n‘Spearmans,’ and ‘Pikemans,’ and ‘Billmans,’ names that themselves\r\nsuggest how bloody would be the strife when hatchet blade, and sharp\r\npike, and keen sword clashed together. To cover and shield the body,\r\nthen, was the one thought of these early days of military tactics, and\r\nat the same time to give the fullest play to every limb and sinew. This\r\nwas a work of a most careful nature, and no wonder it demanded the\r\ncombined skill of several craftsmen. Such occupative sobriquets as ‘Adam\r\nle Armerer’ or ‘Simon le Armurer’ are now represented by the curter\r\n‘Armer’ or ‘Armour.’ In the ‘Knight’s Tale’ it is said—\r\n\r\n               There were also of Martes division\r\n               Th’ armerer, and the bowyer, and the smith,\r\n               That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Frobishers,’ ‘Furbishers,’ and ‘Furbers,’ once found as ‘Richard le\r\nFourbishour’ or ‘Alan le Fourbour,’ scoured and prepared the habergeon,\r\nor jack just referred to, while ‘Gilbert le Hauberger’ or ‘John le\r\nHaubergeour’ was more immediately engaged in constructing it. Our\r\npresent Authorized Version, I need hardly say, still retains the word.\r\nIn ‘Sire Thopas,’ too, it is used where it is said—\r\n\r\n                     And next his schert an aketoun,\r\n                     And over that an habergoun.\r\n\r\nOur classical-looking ‘Homers’ are the naturally corrupted form of the\r\nonce familiar ‘le Heaumer,’ he who fashioned the warrior’s helmet.[217]\r\nOur ‘Sworders,’ I imagine, forged him his trusty blade,[218] while our\r\n‘Sheathers’ furnished forth its slip. Our ‘Platers’ I would suggest as\r\nmakers of his cuirass, while our ‘Kissers’—far less demonstrative than\r\nthey look—are but relics of such a name as ‘Richard le Kissere,’ he who\r\nmanufactured his _cuishes_ or thigh armour, one of the most careful\r\nparts of the entire dress.[219] Lastly, our ‘Spurriers’ were there ready\r\nto supply him with his rowel, and thus in warlike guise he was prepared\r\neither for adventurous combat in behalf of the distressed damsel, or to\r\nseek favour in the eyes of her he loved in the more deadly lists.[220]\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention our ‘Kemps’ while upon military affairs, a\r\ngeneral term as it was for a soldier in the days of which we are\r\nspeaking. I believe the phrase ‘to go a kemping’ is still in use in the\r\nnorth. In the old rhyme of ‘Guy and Colbrand’ the minstrel says—\r\n\r\n                  When meat and drink is great plentye,\r\n                  Then lords and ladys still will be,\r\n                    And sit and solace lythe:\r\n                  Then it is time for mee to speake,\r\n                  Of kern knightes and kempes greate,\r\n                    Such carping for to kythe.\r\n\r\nHow familiar a term it must have been in the common mouth the frequency\r\nwith which the name is met fully shows.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Slingers’ represent an all but forgotten profession, but they seem\r\nto have been useful enough in their day and generation. The sling was\r\nalways attached to a stick, whence the old term ‘staffsling.’ Lydgate\r\ndescribes David as armed\r\n\r\n             With a staffe slynge, voyde of plate and mayle;\r\n\r\nwhile in ‘Richard Cœur de Lion’ we are told—\r\n\r\n                  Foremost he sette hys arweblasteres,\r\n                  And aftyr that hys good archeres,\r\n                  And aftyr hys staff-slyngeres,\r\n                  And other with scheeldes and speres.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget old England’s one boast, her archers, and our\r\nlast quotation fitly brings them to our notice. They, too, in the\r\nbattle-field and in the rural list, maintained alike their supremacy. If\r\nwe would be proud of our early victories, we must ever look with\r\nveneration on the bow. ‘Bowman’ and ‘Archer’ still represent the more\r\nmilitary professional, but not alone. Even more interesting, as speaking\r\nfor the more specific crossbow or ‘arbalist,’ are our ‘Alabasters,’\r\n‘Arblasters,’ ‘Arblasts,’ and ‘Balsters.’ In Robert of Gloucester’s\r\ndescription of the reign of the Conqueror, it is said—\r\n\r\n         So great power of this land and of France he nom (took)\r\n         With him into England, of knights and squires,\r\n         Spearmen anote, and bowemen, and also arblasters.\r\n\r\nChaucer, too, describing a battlement, says—\r\n\r\n                And eke within the castle were\r\n                Springoldes, gonnes, bowes, and archers,\r\n                And eke about at corners\r\n                Men seine over the wall stand\r\n                Grete engines, who were nere hand,\r\n                And in the kernels, here and there,\r\n                Of arblasters great plentie were.\r\n\r\nIn the Hundred Rolls he is Latinized as ‘John Alblastarius,’ and in the\r\nYork Records as ‘Thomas Balistarius.’ The Inquisitiones style him\r\n‘Richard le Alblaster,’ while the Parliamentary Writs register him as\r\n‘Reginald le Arblaster.’ It was to this class of armour our word\r\n‘artillery’ was first applied, a fact which our Bible translators have\r\npreserved, where, in describing the meeting between David and Jonathan,\r\nthey speak of the latter as giving his ‘artillery to the lad.’ Cotgrave,\r\ntoo, in his dictionary, printed at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, has the following:—‘Artellier, a bowyer or bow-maker, also a\r\nfletcher, or one that makes both bows and arrows.’ The mention of the\r\nfletcher brings us to the more general weapon. Such an entry as the\r\nfollowing would seem strange to the eyes of the nineteenth century:—‘To\r\nNicolas Frost, bowman, Stephen Sedar, fletcher,[221] Ralph, the\r\nstringer, and divers others of the said mysteries, in money, paid to\r\nthem, viz.:—to the aforesaid Nicholas, for 500 bows, 31_l._ 8_s._; to\r\nthe aforesaid Stephen, for 1,700 sheaves of arrows, 148_l._ 15_s._; and\r\nto the aforesaid Ralph, for forty gross of bowstrings, 12_l._’\r\n(Exchequer Issues, 14 Henry IV.) This short extract in itself shows us\r\nthe origin of at least three distinct surnames, viz.:—‘Bowyer,’\r\n‘Fletcher,’ and ‘Stringer.’ We should hardly recognise the first,\r\nhowever, in such entries as ‘Adam le Boghiere,’ or ‘William le\r\nBoghyere.’ ‘John le Bower’ reminds us that some of our ‘Bowers’ are\r\nsimilarly sprung, while ‘George le Boyer’ answers for our ‘Boyers.’\r\nBesides these, we have ‘Robert Bowmaker’ or ‘John Bowmaykere’ to\r\nrepresent the fuller sobriquet. So much for the bow. Next comes the\r\narrow. This was a very careful piece of workmanship. Four distinct\r\nclasses of artizans were engaged in its structure, and, as we might\r\nexpect, all are familiar names of to-day. ‘John le Arowsmyth’ we may set\r\nfirst. He confined himself to the manufacture of the arrow-head. Thus we\r\nfind the following statement made in an Act passed in 1405:—‘Item,\r\nbecause the Arrowsmyths do make many faulty heads for arrows and\r\nquarels, it is ordained and established that all heads for arrows and\r\nquarels, after this time to be made, shall be well boiled or braised,\r\nand hardened at the points with steel.’ (Stat. Realm.)[222] ‘Clement le\r\nSettere’ or ‘Alexander le Settere’[223] was busied in affixing these to\r\nthe shaft, and ‘John le Tippere’ or ‘William le Tippere’ in pointing\r\nthem off. Nor is this all—there is yet the feather. Of the origin of\r\nsuch mediæval folk as ‘Robert le Fleccher’ or ‘Ada le Fletcher,’ we are\r\nreminded by Milton, where, in describing an angel, he says—\r\n\r\n                                 His locks behind,\r\n           Illustrious on his shoulders, _fledge_ with wings,\r\n           Lay waving round.\r\n\r\nThe fletcher, or fledger as I had well-nigh called him, spent his time,\r\nin fact, in feathering arrows.\r\n\r\nSkelton in ‘The Maner of the World’ says:—\r\n\r\n                        So proude and so gaye,\r\n                        So riche in arraye,\r\n                        And so skant of mon-ey\r\n                                    Saw I never:\r\n                        So many bowyers,\r\n                        So many fletchers,\r\n                        And so few good archers\r\n                                    Saw I never.\r\n\r\nWhile all these names, however, speak for specific workmanship, our\r\n‘Flowers’ represent a more general term. We are told of Phœbus in the\r\n‘Manciples Tale,’ that\r\n\r\n                His bowe he bent, and set therein a flo.\r\n\r\n‘Flo,’ was a once familiar term for an arrow. ‘John le Floer,’ or\r\n‘Nicholas le Flouer,’ therefore, would seem to be but synonymous with\r\n‘Arrowsmith’ or ‘Fletcher.’ ‘Stringer’ and ‘Stringfellow’ are\r\nself-explanatory, and are common surnames still. What a list of\r\nsobriquets is here! What a change in English social life do they\r\ndeclare. Time was when to be a sure marksman was the object of every\r\nEnglish boy’s ambition. The bow was his chosen companion. Evening saw\r\nhim on the village green, beneath the shade of the old yew tree, and as\r\nhe practised his accustomed sport, his breath would come thick and fast,\r\nas he bethought him of the coming wake, and his chance of bringing down\r\nthe popinjay, and presenting the ribbon to his chosen queen of the May.\r\nYes, times are altered. Teeming cities cover the once rustic sward,\r\nbroadcloth has eclipsed the Lincoln green, the clothyard, the arrow; but\r\nstill amid the crowd that rushes to and fro in our streets the name of\r\nan ‘Archer,’ or a ‘Bowman,’ or a ‘Butts,’ or a ‘Popgay’ spoken in our\r\nears will hush the hubbub of the city, and, forgotten for a brief moment\r\nthe greed for money, will carry us, like a pleasant dream recalled, into\r\nthe fresher and purer atmosphere of England’s past.\r\n\r\nIn the poem from which I have but recently quoted we have the record of\r\n‘gonnes,’ or ‘guns,’ as we should now term them. It would be quite\r\npossible for our nomenclature to be represented by memorials of the\r\npowder magazine, and I should be far from asserting that such is not the\r\ncase.[224] In the household of Edward III. there are enumerated, among\r\nothers, ‘Ingyners lvij; Artellers vj; Gonners vj.’ Here there is a clear\r\ndistinction between the ‘gun’ and the ‘engine;’ between missiles hurled\r\nby powder and those by the catapult. Fifty years even earlier than this\r\nChaucer had used the following sentence:—‘They dradde no assaut of\r\ngynne, gonne, nor skaffaut.’ In his ‘Romance,’ too, as I have just\r\nshown, he places in juxtaposition ‘grete engines’ and ‘gonnes.’ Of one,\r\nif not both of these, we have undoubted memorials in our nomenclature.\r\nThe Hundred Rolls furnish us with a ‘William le Engynur’ and a ‘Walter\r\nle Ginnur;’ the Inquisitiones with a ‘Richard le Enginer,’ and the Writs\r\nwith a ‘William le Genour.’ The descendants of such as these are, of\r\ncourse, our ‘Gunners,’ ‘Ginners,’ ‘Jenour,’ and ‘Jenners,’[225] the last\r\nof which are now represented by one who is as renowned for recovering as\r\nhis ancestor in days gone by would be for destroying life. Our ‘Gunns’\r\nand ‘Ginns’ also must be referred to the same source. In one of the\r\nrecords just alluded to a ‘Warin Engaine’ is to be met with. If we elide\r\nthe first syllable, as in the previous instances, the modern form at\r\nonce appears.\r\n\r\nBut if in the deadly tournament the baron and his retainers found an\r\nample pastime, nevertheless the chase was of all diversions the most\r\npopular. In this the prince and the peasant alike found recreation,\r\nwhile with regard to the latter, as we shall see, it was also combined\r\nwith service. The woody wastelands, so extended in these earlier days of\r\na sparse population, afforded sport enough for the most ardent huntsman.\r\nAccording to the extent of privilege or the divisions into which they\r\nwere separated, these tracts were styled by the various terms of\r\n‘forest,’ ‘chase,’ ‘park,’ and ‘warren.’ To any one at all conversant\r\nwith old English law these several words will be familiar enough. To\r\nkeep the wilder beasts within their prescribed limits, to prevent them\r\ninjuring the tilled lands, and in general to guard the common interests\r\nof lord and tenant, keepers were appointed. The names of these officers,\r\nthe chief of whom are entitled by appellations whose root is of a local\r\ncharacter, are well-nigh all found to this day in our directories.\r\nIndeed there is no class of names more firmly imbedded there. In the\r\norder of division I have just alluded to, we have ‘Forester,’ with its\r\ncorrupted ‘Forster’ and ‘Foster,’ relics of such registered folk as ‘Ivo\r\nle Forester,’ ‘Henry le Forster,’ or ‘Walter le Foster;’ ‘Chaser,’ now\r\nobsolete, I believe, but lingering on for a considerable period as the\r\noffspring of ‘William’ or ‘Simon le Chasur;’ ‘Parker,’ or ‘Parkman,’ or\r\n‘Park,’ descended from ‘Adam le Parkere,’ or ‘Hamo le Parkere,’ or\r\n‘Roger atte Parke,’ or ‘John del Parc,’ and ‘Warener’ or ‘Warner,’ or\r\n‘Warren,’ lineally sprung from men of the stamp of ‘Thomas le Warrener,’\r\n‘Jacke le Warner,’ or ‘Richard de Waren.’ The curtailed forms of these\r\nseveral terms seem to have been all but consequent with the rise of the\r\nofficership itself. ‘Love’ in the ‘Romance’ says:—\r\n\r\n                  Now am I knight, now chastelaine,\r\n                  Now prelate, and now chaplaine,\r\n                  Now priest, now clerke, now forstere.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the Yoman, too, Chaucer adds—\r\n\r\n              An horne he bere, the baudrick was of grene,\r\n              A fostere was he sothely as I guesse.\r\n\r\nThus, again, Langland, in setting forth Glutton’s encounter with the\r\nfrequenters of the tavern, speaks familiarly of—\r\n\r\n                            Watte the Warner.\r\n\r\nBut these are not all. It is with them we must associate our ancestral\r\n‘Woodwards’ or ‘Woodards,’ and still more common ‘Woodreefs,’\r\n‘Woodrows,’ ‘Woodroffs,’ and ‘Woodruffs,’ all more or less perverted\r\nforms of the original wood-reeve.[226] A song representing the\r\nhusbandmen as complaining of the burdens in Edward II.’s reign says—\r\n\r\n             The hayward heteth us harm to habben of his\r\n             The bailif beckneth us bale, and weneth wel do;\r\n             The wodeward waiteth us wo.\r\n\r\nAll these officers were more or less of legal capacity, men whose duty\r\nit was, bill in hand, to guard the vert and venison under their\r\ncharge,[227] to act as agents for their lord in regard to the pannage of\r\nhogs, to look carefully to the lawing of dogs, and in case of offences\r\nto present them to the verderer at the forest assize. The ‘Moorward,’\r\nfound in our early records as ‘German le Morward’ or ‘Henry le Morward,’\r\nguarded the wilder and bleaker districts. ‘The Rider,’ commonly found as\r\n‘Roger le Rydere’ or ‘Ralph le Ryder,’ in virtue of having a larger\r\nextent of jurisdiction, was mounted, though his office was essentially\r\nthe same. Mr. Lower, remarking upon this word, has a quotation from the\r\nballad of ‘William of Cloudesley,’ where the king, rewarding the brave\r\narcher, says:—\r\n\r\n                    I give thee eightene pence a day,\r\n                      And my bowe thou shalt bere,\r\n                    And over all the north countrè\r\n                      I make thee chyfe rydere.\r\n\r\nWith him we must associate our ‘Rangers’ and ‘Keepers,’ who, acting\r\ndoubtless under him, assisted also in the work of patrolling the\r\nwoodland and recovering strayed beasts, and presenting trespassers to\r\nthe swainmote just referred to.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff, shortened as a surname into ‘Bailey,’ ‘Baillie’ (‘German le\r\nBailif,’ J., ‘Henry le Baillie,’ M.), like the reve, seems to have been\r\nboth of legal and private capacity; in either case acting as\r\ndeputy.[228] This word ‘reve’ did a large amount of duty formerly, but\r\nseems now to be fast getting into its dotage. In composition, however,\r\nit is far from being obsolete. The ‘Reeve’ (‘John le Reve,’ M., ‘Sager\r\nle Reve,’ H.), who figured so conspicuously among the Canterbury\r\nPilgrims, would be the best representative of the term in his day, I\r\nimagine—\r\n\r\n            His lordes shepe, his nete, and his deirie,\r\n            His swine, his hors, his store, and his pultrie,\r\n            Were wholly in this reves governing.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Grieves’ (‘Thomas le Greyve,’ A.), who are but the fuller ‘Gerefa,’\r\nfulfilled, and I believe in some parts of Scotland still fulfil, the\r\ncapacity here described, being but manorial bailiffs, in fact. ‘The Boke\r\nof Curtasye’ says—\r\n\r\n                   Grayvis, and baylys, and parker\r\n                   Shall come to accountes every yere\r\n                   Byfore the auditours of the lorde.\r\n\r\nThus, too, our ‘Portreeves’ (‘William le Portreve,’ A., ‘Augustin le\r\nPortreve,’ A.), who in our coast towns fulfilled the capacity of our\r\nmore general mayor, are oftentimes in our earlier records enrolled as\r\nPortgreve.’ ‘Hythereve’ (‘John le Huthereve,’ O.), from hithe, a haven,\r\nwould seem to denote the same office, while our obsolete ‘Fenreves’\r\n(‘Adam le Fenreve,’ A.), like the ‘Moorward’ mentioned above, had\r\ncharge, I doubt not, of the wilder and more sparsely populated tracts of\r\nland. Many other compounds of this word we have already recorded; some\r\nwe shall refer to by-and-by, and with them and these the reeve, after\r\nall, is not likely to be soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut the poorer villeins were not without those who should guard their\r\ninterests also. In a day of fewer landmarks and scantier barriers\r\ntrespasses would be inevitable. An interesting relic of primitive\r\nprecaution against the straying of animals is found in the officership\r\nof the ‘Hayward’ (or ‘Adam le Heyward,’ as the Hundred Rolls have it),\r\nwhose duty it was to guard the cattle that grazed on the village common.\r\nHe was so styled from the Saxon ‘hay’ or ‘hedge,’ already spoken of in\r\nour previous chapter. An old poem has it—\r\n\r\n                  In tyme of hervest mery it is ynough;\r\n                  Peres and apples hongeth on bough,\r\n                  The hayward bloweth mery his horne;\r\n                  In every felde ripe is corne.\r\n\r\nIn ‘Piers Plowman,’ too, we have the word—\r\n\r\n                   I have an horne, and be a hayward,\r\n                     And liggen out a nyghtes\r\n                   And kepe my corne and my croft\r\n                     From pykers and theves.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these two references that the officership was of a\r\nsomewhat general character. The cattle might be his chief care, but the\r\ncommon village interests were also under his supervision. The term has\r\nleft many surnames to maintain its now decayed and primitive character;\r\n‘Hayward’ and ‘Haward’ are, however, the most familiar. ‘Hayman,’\r\ndoubtless, is of similar origin. If, in spite of the hayward’s care, it\r\ncame to pass that any trespass occurred, the village ‘pounder’ was ready\r\nat hand to impound the animal till its owner claimed it, and paid the\r\ncustomary fine—\r\n\r\n                In Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,\r\n                In Wakefield, all on a green.\r\n\r\nSo we are told in ‘Robin Hood.’ I need not add that our many ‘Pounders,’\r\n‘Pinders,’ and still more classic ‘Pindars,’ are but the descendants of\r\nhim or one of his _confrères_. I do not doubt myself, too, that our\r\n‘Penders’ (‘William le Pendere’ in the Parliamentary Writs) will be\r\nfound to be of a similar origin.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, these especial officers superintended the general\r\ninterests of lord and tenant, there were those also whose peculiar\r\nfunction it was to guard the particular quarry his master loved to\r\nchase; to see them unmolested and undisturbed during such time as the\r\nhunt itself was in abeyance, and then, when the chase came on, to\r\noverlook and conduct its course. These, too, are not without\r\ndescendants. Such names as ‘Stagman’ and ‘Buckmaster,’[229] ‘Hindman’\r\nand ‘Hartman,’ ‘Deerman’ and its more amatory ‘Dearman,’ by their\r\ncomparative frequency, remind us how important would be their office in\r\nthe eye of their lord.\r\n\r\nNor are those who assisted in the lordly hunt itself left unrepresented\r\nin our nomenclature. The old ‘Elyas le Hunderd,’ or ‘hund-herd,’ has\r\nleft in our ‘Hunnards’ an abiding memorial of the ‘houndsman.’ Similarly\r\nthe ‘vaultrier’ was he who unleashed them. It has been a matter of doubt\r\nwhether or no the more modern ‘feuterer’ owes his origin to this term,\r\nbut the gradations found in such registrations as ‘John le Veutrer,’\r\n‘Geoffrey le Veuterer,’ and ‘Walter le Feuterer,’ to be met with in the\r\nrolls of this period, set all question, I should imagine, at rest. An\r\nold poem, describing the various duties of these officers and their\r\ncharges, says—\r\n\r\n                A halpeny the hunte takes on the day\r\n                For every hounde the sothe to say;\r\n                The vewtrer, two cast of brede he tase,\r\n                Two lesshe of greyhounds if that he has.\r\n\r\n‘Fewter’ and ‘Futter,’[230] however, seem to be the only relics we now\r\npossess of this once important care. Such names as ‘John le Berner’ or\r\n‘Thomas le Berner,’ common enough in old rolls, must be distinguished\r\nfrom our more aristocratic ‘Berners.’ The _berner_ was a special\r\nhoundsman who stood with fresh relays of dogs ready to unleash them if\r\nthe chase grew heated and long. In the Parliamentary Rolls he is termed\r\na ‘yeoman-berner.’ Our ‘Hornblows,’ curtailed from ‘Hornblower,’ and\r\nsimpler ‘Blowers,’ would seem to be closely related to the last, for the\r\nhorn figured as no mean addition by its jubilant sounds to the\r\nexcitement of the chase. He who used it held an office that required all\r\nthe attention he could bring to bear upon it. The dogs were not\r\nunleashed until he had sounded the blast, and if at any time from his\r\nelevated station he caught sight of the quarry, he was by the manner of\r\nwinding his instrument to certify to the huntsman the peculiar class to\r\nwhich it belonged. In the Hundred Rolls we find him inscribed as\r\n‘Blowhorn,’ a mere reversal of syllables. Of a more general and\r\nprofessional character probably would be our ‘Hunters,’ ‘Huntsmans,’ and\r\n‘Hunts,’ not to mention the more Norman ‘John le Venner’ or ‘Richard\r\nFenner.’ It may not be known to all our ‘Hunts’ that theirs, the shorter\r\nform, was the most familiar term in use at that time; hence the number\r\nthat at present exist. We are told in the ‘Knight’s Tale’ of the—\r\n\r\n                Hunte and horne, and houndes him beside;\r\n\r\nwhile but a little further on he speaks of—\r\n\r\n               The hunte ystrangled with the wilde beres.\r\n\r\nForms like ‘Walter le Hunte’ or ‘Nicholas le Hunte’ are very common to\r\nthe old records. As another proof of the general use of this word we may\r\ncite its compounds. ‘Borehunte’ carries us back to the day when the wild\r\nboar ranged the forest’s deeper gloom. ‘Wolfhunt,’ represented in the\r\nInquisitiones by such a sobriquet as ‘Walter le Wolfhunte,’ reminds us\r\nthat Edgar did not utterly exterminate that savage beast of prey, as is\r\noftentimes asserted. A family of this name held lands in the Peak of\r\nDerbyshire at this period by the service of keeping the forest clear of\r\nwolves. In the forty-third year of Edward III. one Thomas Engeine held\r\nlands in Pitchley, in the county of Northampton, by service of finding\r\nat his own cost certain dogs for the destruction of wolves, foxes, &c.,\r\nin the counties of Northampton, Rutland, Oxford, Essex, and Buckingham;\r\nnay, as late as the eleventh year of Henry VI. Sir Robert Plumpton held\r\none borate of land in Nottinghamshire, by service of winding a horn, and\r\nchasing or frightening the wolves in Sherwood Forest.[231] Doubtless,\r\nhowever, as in these recorded instances, it would be in the more hilly\r\nand bleaker districts, or in the deeper forests, he found his safest and\r\nlast retreat. It seems well-nigh literally to be coming down from a\r\nmountain to a mole-hill to speak of our ‘Mole-hunts,’ the other compound\r\nof this word. But small as he was in comparison with the other, he was\r\nscarcely less obnoxious on account of his burrowing propensities, for\r\nwhich the husbandman gave him the longer name of mouldwarp. His numbers,\r\ntoo, made him formidable, and it is no wonder that people found\r\noccupation enough in his destruction, or that the name of ‘Molehunt’\r\nshould have found its way into our early rolls. So late, indeed, as\r\n1641, we find in a farming book the statement that 12_d._ was the usual\r\nprice paid by the farmer for every dozen old moles secured, and 6_d._\r\nfor the same number of young ones. This speaks at least for their\r\nplentifulness. An old provincialism for mole, and one not yet extinct,\r\nwas ‘wont’ or ‘want.’ This explains the name of ‘Henry le Wantur,’ which\r\nmay be met with in the Hundred Rolls. In the Sloane MS. is a method\r\ngiven ‘for to take wontes.’ It would be in the deeper underwood our\r\n‘Todmans’ and ‘Todhunters,’ the chasers of the fox, or ‘tod,’ as he was\r\npopularly called, found diversion enough. It would be here our\r\n‘Brockmans’ secured the badger. I doubt not these were both also of\r\nprofessional character—aids and helps to the farmer. Indeed, he had many\r\nupon whose services he could rely for a trifle of reward in the shape of\r\na silver penny, or a warm mess of potage on the kitchen settle. Our\r\n‘Burders’ and ‘Fowlers,’ by their craft, whether of falconry or netting,\r\nor in the use of the cross-bow bolt, aided to clear the air of the more\r\nsavage birds of prey, or of the lesser ones that would molest the\r\nbursting seed. I need scarcely remark that the distinction between\r\n‘bird’ and ‘fowl’ is modern. The ‘fowls of the air’ with our Saxon\r\nBible, and up to very recent days, embraced every winged creature, large\r\nand small. In our very expression ‘barndoor-fowl’ we are only using a\r\nphrase which served to mark the distinction between the wilder and the\r\nmore domesticated bird. The training and sale of bullfinches seem to\r\nhave given special employment then, as now, to such as would undertake\r\nthe care thereof. A ‘Robert le Fincher’ occurs at an early period, and I\r\nsee his descendants are yet in being. As we shall see in a later\r\nchapter, this bird has set his mark deeply upon our sobriquet\r\nnomenclature. Our ‘Trappers,’ whether for bird or beast, confined their\r\noperations to the soil, capturing their spoil by net or gin.\r\n\r\nWe owe several names, or rather several forms of the same name, to the\r\nonce favourite pursuit of falconry. Of all sports in the open air this\r\nwas the one most entirely aristocratic. In it the lord and his lady\r\nalike found pleasure. It had become popular so early as the ninth\r\ncentury, and, as Mr. Lower says, in such estimation was the office of\r\nState falconer held in Norman times that Domesday shows us, apart from\r\nothers, four different tenants-in-chief, who are described each as\r\n‘accipitrarius,’ or falconer. Until John’s reign it was not lawful for\r\nany but those of the highest rank to keep hawks, but in the ‘Forest\r\nCharter’ a special clause was introduced which gave power to every free\r\nman to have an aerie. So valuable was a good falcon that it even stood\r\nchief among royal gifts, and up to the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury it brought as much as 100 marks in the market.[232] Royal edicts\r\nwere even passed for the preservation of their eggs. From all this, and\r\nmuch more that might be adduced, it is easy to understand how important\r\nwas the office of falconer, nor need we wonder that it is one of the\r\nmost familiar names to be found in early rolls. Of many forms those of\r\n‘Falconer,’ ‘Falconar,’ ‘Faulkner,’ ‘Falkner,’[233] ‘Faulconer,’ and\r\n‘Faukener,’ seem to be the commonest. The last form is found in the\r\n‘Boke of Curtasye’—\r\n\r\n               The chaunceler answeres for their clothyng,\r\n               For yomen, faukeners, and their horsyng,\r\n               For their wardrop and wages also.\r\n\r\nIn our former ‘Idonea or Walter le Oyseler’ we recognise but another\r\nFrench term for the same. A special keeper of the goshawk, or ‘oster,’\r\ngot into mediæval records in the shape of ‘William le Astrier,’ or\r\n‘Robert le Ostricer,’ or ‘Richard le Hostriciere,’ or ‘Godfrey\r\nOstriciarius.’ The Latin ‘accipiter’ is believed to be the root of the\r\nterm, which with such other perverted forms as ‘Ostregier,’ ‘Ostringer,’\r\n‘Astringer,’ and ‘Austringer,’ lingered on the common tongue till so\r\nlate as the seventeenth century.[234] A curious proof of the prevailing\r\npassion is found in the name of ‘Robert le Jessmaker,’ set down in the\r\nHundred Rolls. The ‘jess’ was the leathern or silken strap fastened\r\nclosely round the foot of the hawk, from which the line depended and was\r\nheld by the falconer. That the demand for these should be so great as to\r\ncause a man to give himself up entirely to their manufacture, will be\r\nthe best evidence of the ardour with which our forefathers entered into\r\nthis pastime. The end of falconry was, however, sudden as it was\r\ncomplete. The introduction of the musket at one fell swoop did away with\r\noffice, pursuit, with, in fact, the whole paraphernalia of the\r\namusement, and now it is without a relic, save in so far as these names\r\nabide with us.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of our subject it is pleasant to remind\r\nourselves that, however strong might be the antagonism which this\r\nchapter displays between Norman and Saxon, the pride of the one, the\r\noppression of the other, that antagonism is now overpast and gone. We\r\nwell know that a revolution was at work, sometimes showing itself\r\nviolently, but generally silent in its progress, by which happier\r\ncircumstances arrived, happier at any rate for the country at large. We\r\nwell know how this consummation came, how these several races became\r\nafterwards one by the suppression of that power the more independent of\r\nthese barons had wielded, by confusion of blood, by the acquisition of\r\nmore general liberty, by mutuality of interests, by the contagious\r\ninfluences of commerce, and, above all, by the kindly and\r\nprejudice-weakening force of lapsing time. All this we know, and, as it\r\nis in a sense foreign to our present purpose, I pass over it now. I\r\ntrust that I have already shown that there is something, after all, in a\r\nname; at any rate in a surname, for that in it is supplied a link\r\nbetween the past and the present, for that in the utterance of one of\r\nthese may be recalled not merely the lineaments of some face of to-day,\r\nbut the dimmer outline of an age which is past beyond recall for ever.\r\nViewed in a light so broad as this, the country churchyard, with each\r\nmossy stone, is, apart from the diviner lessons it teaches, a living\r\npage of history; and even the parish register, instead of being a mere\r\nrecord of dry and uninteresting facts, becomes instinct with the lives\r\nand surroundings of our English forefathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                   SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION (COUNTRY).\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to the consideration of occupations generally, and to this I\r\nthink it will be advisable to devote two chapters. One reason for so\r\ndoing, the main one in fact, is that they seem naturally to divide\r\nthemselves into two classes—those of a rural character, very numerous at\r\nthat time on account of agricultural pursuits being so general, and\r\nthose of a more diverse and I may say civilized kind, bearing upon the\r\ncommunity’s life—literature and art, dress, with all its varied\r\nparaphernalia, the boudoir and the kitchen. In considering the former,\r\nthe character of our surnames will give us, I imagine, by no means a bad\r\nor ineffective picture of the simplicity of our early rural life, its\r\nretirement, and even calm. In shadowing forth the latter, we shall be\r\nenabled to see what were the available means of that age, and by the\r\nvery absence of certain names to realise how numberless have been the\r\nresources that discovery has added at a more recent period. It will be\r\nwell, too, to give two entire chapters to these surnames, as being\r\nworthy of somewhat further particularity than the others. They betray\r\nmuch more of our English life that has become obsolete. Local names, as\r\nI have said already, while they must ever denote much of change, denote\r\nthe changes more especially of Nature herself, which are slow in\r\ngeneral, and require more than the test of four or five centuries to\r\nmake their transitions apparent. Personal or Christian names vary almost\r\nless than these. The Western European system is set upon the same\r\nfoundation, and whatever has been peculiar to separate countries has\r\nlong since, by the intermingling of nations, whether peaceful or\r\nrevolutionary, been added to the one common stock. Some indeed have\r\nfallen into disuse through crises of various kinds. A certain number,\r\ntoo, of a fanciful kind, as we have already seen, have been added within\r\nthe last two centuries, but these latter have not of course affected our\r\nsurnames. Nicknames, which form so large a proportion of our\r\nnomenclature, remain much the same; for a nation’s tongue, while\r\nreceiving a constant deposit and throwing off ever a redundant\r\nphraseology, still, as a rule, does not touch these; they are taken from\r\nthe deeper channel of a people’s speech. But the fashion and custom of\r\nliving is ever changing. New wants spring up, and old requirements\r\nbecome unneeded; fresh resources come to hand, and the more antique are\r\nat once despised and thrown aside. In a word, invention and discovery\r\ncast their shafts at the very heart of usage. Thus it is that we shall\r\nhave such a large number of obsolete occupations to recount—occupations\r\nwhich but for our rolls even the oldest and most reliable of our less\r\nformal writings would have failed to preserve to us.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for the eye to light upon hamlets in the more\r\nretired nooks and crannies of England that have undergone but little\r\nchange during even the last six centuries, hamlets of which we could say\r\nwith Goldsmith:—\r\n\r\n          How often have I paused on every charm,\r\n          The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,\r\n          The never-failing brook, the busy mill,\r\n          The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill,\r\n          The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,\r\n          For talking age and whispering lovers made.\r\n\r\nI have seen, or I at least imagined I have seen, such a picture as this;\r\nbut if there be, this of all times is that in which we must be prepared\r\nfor a revolution. Our railways are every day but connecting us with the\r\nmore inaccessible districts, following as they do the curves of our\r\nvalleys, winding alongside our streams, like nature and art in parallel.\r\nAs they thus increase they bear with them equally increased facilities\r\nfor carrying the modernized surroundings and accessories of life on\r\nthis, on that, and on every hand. Thus usage is everywhere fast giving\r\nway before utility, and thus in proportion as art and invention get\r\nelbow-room, so does the primitive poetry of our existence fade from\r\nview. We can remember villages—there are still such—around which time\r\nhad flung a halo of so simple aspect, villages whose steads were grouped\r\nwith so exquisite a quaintness, so utterly and beautifully irregular, so\r\nfull of unexpected joints and curves, and all so thatched, and\r\nembrowned, and trellised, that with the loss of them we have lost a\r\npastoral. There may be indeed a certain poetry in model villas of\r\nundeviating line and exact altitude; there may be a beauty in an\r\nerection which reminds you in perpetuity of the great Euclidian truth\r\nthat a straight line is that which lies evenly between its extreme\r\npoints, but at times it puts one in sober mood to think all the touches\r\nof a past time are to fade away, and these be in their stead. How\r\ndifferent the tale nomenclature tells us of former rusticity and simpler\r\ntastes.\r\n\r\nThe early husbandman required but little decorative refinement for his\r\nhomestead. To keep out the cold blast and the driving rain, to have a\r\nniche by the fireside comfortable and warm, this was all he asked or\r\nwished for. His roof was all but invariably composed of thack or thatch,\r\nand every village had its ‘thatcher.’ Busy indeed would he be as the\r\nlate autumn drew nigh, and stack and stead must be shielded from the\r\nkeen and chilling winter. The Hundred Roll forms of the surname are\r\n‘Joan le Thaccher’ and ‘Thomas le Thechare;’ the Parliamentary Writs\r\n‘John le Thacher;’ while the more modern directory furnishes us with\r\nsuch changes rung upon the same as ‘Thatcher,’ ‘Thacker’[235] (still a\r\ncommon provincialism for the occupation), and ‘Thackery,’ or\r\n‘Thackeray,’ or Thackwray.’[236] These latter are of course but akin to\r\nthe old ‘John le Fermery,’ or ‘Richard le Vicary,’ the termination added\r\nbeing the result of popular whim or caprice. Our ‘Readers’ had less to\r\ndo with book lore than we might have supposed, being but descendants of\r\nthe mediæval ‘William le Redere,’[237] another term for the same kind of\r\nlabour. The old ‘Hellier,’ or ‘Helier,’ carries us back to a once\r\nwell-known root. To ‘hill,’ or ‘hele,’ was to cover, and a ‘hilyer’ was\r\na roofer.[238] Sir John Maundville says with regard to the Tartars, ‘the\r\nhelynge of their houses, and ... the dores ben alle of woode;’ and John\r\nof Trevisa speaks of the English ‘whyt cley and red’ as useful ‘for to\r\nmake crokkes and other vessels, and barned tyyl to _hele_ with houses\r\nand churches.’ Gower, too, uses the word prettily, but perfectly\r\nnaturally, when he says—\r\n\r\n                 She took up turves (turfs) of the lond,\r\n                 Withouten help of mannes hond,\r\n                 All heled with the grene grass.[239]\r\n\r\nAmongst other of the many forms that still survive surnominally we have\r\n‘Hillyer,’ ‘Hillier,’ ‘Hellier,’ ‘Hellyer,’ and the somewhat unpleasant\r\n‘Helman’ and ‘Hellman.’ Earlier instances may be found in the Hundred\r\nRolls in such entries as ‘Robert le Heliere’ or ‘Will. Heleman.’ Our\r\n‘Tylers’ are well and quaintly represented in the early rolls. One\r\nmediæval spelling of this good old-fashioned name is ‘Tyghelere’ (Adam\r\nle Tyghelere, P.W.), while such forms as ‘le Tuglur,’ ‘le Tuler,’ or ‘le\r\nTewler,’ as representatives of the Norman-French vocabulary, meet us on\r\nevery hand. Whether any of their descendants have had the courage to\r\nreproduce any of these renderings I cannot say. I do not find any in our\r\ndirectories. Our ‘Smiths’ have not been quite so qualmish. With the\r\ntylers we may fitly introduce our ‘Shinglers,’ they who used the stout\r\noaken wood in the place of burnt clay. Churches were oftentimes so\r\ncovered. Mr. Halliwell quotes the following somewhat sarcastic couplet:—\r\n\r\n                 Flouren cakes beth the schingles alle\r\n                 Of cherche, cloister, boure, and halle.\r\n\r\nPiers Plowman, too, speaks similarly of Noah’s Ark as the ‘shyngled\r\nship.’[240] All these names have, occupatively speaking, now become\r\nobsolete, or nearly so; our ‘Slaters,’ or ‘Sclaters,’ or ‘Slatters,’\r\nhaving usurped the entire position they were formerly content to share\r\nwith their humbler brethren.[241]\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the above names we shall find the Saxon to be in all\r\nbut whole possession of the field. The fact is, the roof and its\r\nappurtenances were little regarded for a long period by our early\r\narchitects, if we may give such a grand term to those who set up the\r\nordinary homestead of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. There\r\nwere no chimneys even in the residences of the rich and noble. A hole in\r\nthe roof, or the window, or the door, one of these, whether in the homes\r\nof the peer or the peasant, was the outlet for all obnoxious vapours.\r\nWith the Normans, however, came a great increase of refinement in the\r\nmasonry and wooden framework of which our houses are composed. Such\r\nnames as ‘Adam le Quarreur,’ or ‘Hugh le Quareur,’ ‘Walter le Marbiler,’\r\nor ‘Geoffrey le Merberer,’ ‘Gotte le Mazoun,’ or ‘Walter le Masun,’ or\r\n‘Osbert le Machun’ represent a cultivation of which the earlier settled\r\nrace, if they knew something, did not avail themselves in their merely\r\ndomestic architecture. Two of these occupations are referred to by\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle,’ when he speaks of—\r\n\r\n                Masones, male-makers, and merbelers.[242]\r\n\r\n‘Henry le Wallere,’ whose sobriquet was ennobled later on by one of our\r\npoets, is the only entry I can set by these as belonging to the Saxon\r\ntongue.[243] It is the same with the Norman ‘Amice le Charpenter’ and\r\n‘Alan le Joygnour.’ While the former framed the more solid essentials,\r\nthe very name of the latter infers a careful supervision of minutiæ, of\r\nwhich only a more refined taste would take cognizance. The descendants\r\nof such settlers as these still hold the place they then obtained, and\r\nare unchanged otherwise than in the fashion of spelling their name.\r\n\r\nOf the plaster work we have a goodly array of memorials, the majority of\r\nwhich, of course, are connected with a higher class work than the mere\r\ncottager required. The ordinary term in use at present for a maker of\r\nlime is ‘limeburner.’ It is quite possible that in our ‘Limebears’ or\r\n‘Limebeers’ we have but a corruption of this. Such sobriquets as ‘Hugh\r\nle Limwryte’ and ‘John le Limer’ give us, however, the more general\r\nmediæval forms. The latter is still to be met with among our surnames.\r\nBut these are not all. We have in our ‘Dawbers’ the descendants of the\r\nold ‘Thomas le Daubour,’ or ‘Roger le Daubere,’ of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. ‘Cocke Lorelle,’ whom I have but just quoted, mentions among\r\nother workmen—\r\n\r\n               Tylers, bryckeleyers, hardehewers;\r\n               Parys-plasterers, daubers, and lymeborners.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Authorised Version’ when it speaks of ‘the wall daubed with\r\nuntempered mortar,’ still preserves their memorial, and our ‘Plasters’\r\nand ‘Plaisters’ are but sturdy scions of many an early registered ‘Adam\r\nle Plastier,’ ‘Joanna le Plaisterer,’ or ‘John le Cementarius.’ The last\r\nof this class I would mention is ‘Robert Pargeter’ or ‘William\r\nPergiter,’ a name inherited by our ‘Pargiters’ and ‘Pargeters.’ This was\r\nan artisan of a higher order. He laboured, in fact, at the more\r\nornamental plaster work. In the accounts of Sir John Howard, A.D. 1467,\r\nis the following entry:—‘Item, the vj day of Aprylle my master made a\r\ncovenaunt with Saunsam the tylere, that he schalle pergete, and whighte\r\nand bemefelle all the new byldynge, and he schalle have for his labore\r\nxiijs. ivd.’[244] It is used metaphorically, but I cannot add very\r\nhappily, in an old translation of Ovid—\r\n\r\n    Thus having where they stood in vaine complained of their wo,\r\n    When night drew neare they bad adue, and eche gave kisses sweete\r\n    Unto the parget on their side, the which did never meete.\r\n\r\n‘Roger le Peynture’ or ‘Henry le Peintur,’ ‘Ralph le Gilder’ and ‘Robert\r\nle Stainer,’ were engaged, I imagine, in the equally careful work of\r\ndecorating passage and hall within, and all have left offspring enough\r\nto keep up their perpetual memorial. Thus, within and without, the house\r\nitself has afforded room for little change in our nomenclature, though\r\nthe artisans themselves have now a very different work to perform to\r\nthat of their mediæval prototypes. The increase of wealth and a\r\nprogressive culture have not merely taught but demanded a more careful\r\nand refined workmanship in the details of ordinary housebuilding. We may\r\nreadily imagine, however, even in this early day, how little the simple\r\nbondsman, or freer husbandman, had to do with such artisans as even then\r\nexisted. I do not find, at least the exceptions are of the rarest, that\r\nthese workmen dwelt in the more rural districts at all. Their names are\r\nto be met with in the towns, where the richer tradespeople and burgesses\r\nwere already beginning to copy the fashions and habits of life of the\r\nhigher aristocracy.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the ‘town’—how it originally denoted but the\r\nsimple farmstead with its immediate surroundings, then its gradual\r\nenlargement of sense as other steads increased and multiplied around it.\r\nWe have also seen how the old ‘ham’ or home gathered about it such\r\naccessions of human abodes as converted it in time into one of those\r\nvillage communities, so many of which we still find in the outer\r\ndistricts, almost, as I have said, unaltered from their early\r\nfoundation. It was in these various homesteads dwelt the peasantry.\r\nThere might be seen our ‘Cotmans’ and ‘Cotters’ (‘Richard Coteman,’ A.,\r\n‘Simon le Cotere,’ F.F.), the descendants, doubtless, of the ‘cotmanni’\r\nof Domesday Book. Similar in origin and as humble in degree would be our\r\nnow numerous ‘Cotterels’ or ‘Cottrels’ (‘William Coterel,’ M., ‘Joice\r\nCotterill,’ Z.), till a comparatively recent period an ordinary\r\nsobriquet of that class of our country population. A curious memorial of\r\na past state of life abides with us in our ‘Boardmans,’ ‘Boarders,’\r\n‘Bordmans,’ and ‘Borders.’ They were the tenants of lands which their\r\nlord kept expressly for the maintenance of his table, the rental being\r\npaid in kind. Hence our old English law-books speak familiarly of\r\nbord-service, or bord-load, or bord-land. The term board in this same\r\nsense still lingers on the common tongue, for we are yet wont to use\r\nsuch phrases as bed and board, or a frugal board, or a board plentifully\r\nspread. A determinate, as distinct from an unfixed service, has left its\r\nmark in our ‘Sockermans,’ ‘Suckermans,’ and ‘Sockmans,’ they who held by\r\nsocage, or socmanry, as the old law-books have it. Under this tenure, as\r\na condition of the meagre rental, the stout-hearted, thick-limbed rustic\r\nwas to be ready, as his lord’s adherent, to stand by him in every\r\nassault, either as archer, or arbalister, or pikeman—that is, fealty was\r\nto eke out the remaining sum which would otherwise have been due. But\r\nthere were of these Saxon husbandmen some under no such thraldom,\r\nhowever honourable, as this, and of these freeholders we must set as the\r\nhighest our ‘Yomans’ and ‘Yeomans.’ This term, however, became an\r\nofficial one, and it is doubtful to which aspect of the word we are to\r\nrefer the present owners of the name. It is possible both features may\r\nhave had something to do with its origination. How anxious they who had\r\nbeen redeemed, or who had been born free, though of humble\r\ncircumstances, were to preserve themselves from a doubtful or suspected\r\nposition such names as ‘Walter le Free’ or ‘John le Freman’ will fully\r\nshow. We find even such appellatives as ‘Matilda Frewoman’ or ‘Agnes\r\nFrewyfe,’ in the latter case the husband possibly being yet in bondage.\r\nIn our ‘Frys,’ a sobriquet that has acquired much honour of late years\r\nand represented in mediæval rolls by such entries as ‘Thomas le Frye’ or\r\n‘Walter le Frie,’ we have but an obsolete rendering of ‘free.’[245]\r\nThese, as we see, are all Saxon—but Norman equivalents are not wanting.\r\nOur ‘Francoms’ or ‘Francombs’ and ‘Frankhams,’ names by no means\r\nuncommon in our existing registers, are but Anglicised dresses worn by\r\nthe posterity of such registered folk as ‘Henry le Franchome,’ or\r\n‘Reginald le Fraunchome,’ or ‘Hugh le Fraunch-humme.’ ‘William le\r\nFraunk,’ too, or ‘Fulco le Franc,’ can boast many a hale descendant in\r\nour ‘Franks;’ and ‘Roger le Franklyn’ or ‘John le Fraunkelyn’ in our\r\n‘Franklins,’ a name from henceforth endeared to Englishmen as that of\r\nour gallant but lost Arctic hero. From Chaucer’s description of one such\r\nwe should deem the ‘franklin’ to have been of decidedly comfortable\r\nposition, a well-to-do householder, in fact.\r\n\r\n                Withouten bake mete never was his house,\r\n                Of fish and flesh, and that so plenteous,\r\n                It snowed in his hous of mete and drinke\r\n                Of all deintees that men coud of thinke:\r\n                After the sondry sesons of the yere,\r\n                So changed he his mete and soupere.\r\n\r\nBut we are not without vestiges of the baser servitudes of the time, and\r\nin this category we must set the great bulk of the agricultural classes\r\nof the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The descendants of the old ‘Ivo\r\nle Bondes’ and ‘Richard le Bondes’ are still in our midst, and to judge\r\nmerely from their number then and now enrolled, we see what a familiar\r\nposition must that of personal bondage have been.\r\n\r\n                         Of alle men in londe\r\n                         Most toileth the bonde,\r\n\r\nsays an old rhyme.[246] Still more general terms for those who lay under\r\nthis miserable serfdom were those of ‘Knave’ or ‘Villein.’ ‘Walter le\r\nKnave’ or ‘Lambert le Vilein’ or ‘Philip le Vylayn’ are names registered\r\nat the time of which we are speaking. The odium, however, that has\r\ngradually gathered around these sobriquets has caused them to be thrown\r\noff by the posterity of those who first acquired them as simple bondmen.\r\nIndeed, there was the time when, as I shall have occasion to show in a\r\nsucceeding chapter, our forefathers could speak of ‘Goodknaves’ and\r\n‘Goodvilleins.’ Feudal disdain of all that lay beneath chivalric\r\nservice, however, has done its work, and we all now speak, not merely as\r\nif these terms implied that which was mean and despicable in outward\r\ncondition, but that which also was morally depraved and vile. ‘Geoffrey\r\nle Sweyn’ or ‘Hugh le Sweyn,’ however, by becoming the exponent of\r\nhonest rusticity, has rescued his sobriquet from such an ill-merited\r\ndestiny, and has left in many of our ‘Swains’ a token of his mediæval\r\ngallantry. ‘John le Hyne’ or ‘William le Hyne’ (found also as Hind), as\r\nrepresentative of the country labourer, is equally sure of perpetuity,\r\nas the most cursory survey of our directories will prove.[247] Of the\r\n‘Reve’ in the ‘Canterbury Tales,’ we are told:—\r\n\r\n              There was no bailif, nor herd, nor other hine\r\n              That he nor knew his sleight, and his covine.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ too, the word occurs. In the account of the\r\nreconciliation betwixt Jacob and Esau the former is made to say:—\r\n\r\n                  God yeld you, brother, that it so is,\r\n                  That thou thy hyne so would kiss.\r\n\r\nIn the rural habitations we have mentioned, then dwelt these various\r\nmembers of the lower class community.\r\n\r\nThe sobriquets we have just briefly surveyed, however, are of a more\r\ngeneral character. We must now, and as briefly, scan some of those which\r\nin themselves imply the particular service which as rustic labourers\r\ntheir first owners performed, and by which the titles were got. This\r\nclass is well represented by such a name as ‘Plowman.’ Langland, when he\r\nwould take from a peasant point of view a sarcastic survey of the low\r\nmorality of his time, as exemplified in the English Church ere yet she\r\nwas reformed, could fix upon no better sobriquet than that of ‘Piers\r\nPlowman,’ and has thus given a prominence to the name it can never lose.\r\nWhat visions of homely and frugal content we discern in the utterance of\r\nsuch a surname as this; what thoughts of healthy life, such as are\r\nbecoming rarer with each returning year—\r\n\r\n              For times are altered—trade’s unfeeling train\r\n              Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain.\r\n\r\nIt was with him at early dawn would issue forth our ‘Tillyers’ or\r\n‘Tillmans,’ to help him cleave the furrow. A little later on we might\r\nhave seen our ‘Mowers’ and ‘Croppers’[248] hanging up their scythes and\r\nsickles, as the autumn, in richly clad garb, passed slowly by. Then\r\nagain in due season busy enough would be the ‘Dyker,’ now spelt\r\n‘Dicker,’[249] and the ‘Dykeman’ or ‘Dickman.’ With what an enviable\r\nappetite would these eat up to the last relic their rasher of bacon and\r\nblack bread, and quaff their home-brewed ale, a princely feast after the\r\nhard toil of draining the field. To dike was merely to dig, the root\r\nbeing the same. Of the kindly plowman Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n              He would thresh, and thereto dike and delve,\r\n              For Christ’s sake, for every poor wight,\r\n              Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.\r\n\r\nThe Malvern dreamer, too, speaks in the same fashion of ‘dikeres and\r\ndelvers,’ and among other characters introduces to our notice ‘Daw the\r\nDykere,’ ‘Daw’ being, as I have already shown, but the shorter David.\r\nOur ‘Drayners,’ I need not add, were but his compeers in the same\r\nlabour. Perhaps one of the most beautiful features that help to make up\r\na truly English rural landscape is the hedgerows, following the windings\r\nof our lanes, and mazy bypaths skirting our meadows. England is\r\neminently a land of enclosures. Still all this has been the result of\r\nprogressing time. If our pinder be now an obsolete officership it is\r\nbecause the lines of appropriation have become more clearly marked. It\r\nis only thus we can understand the importance of his position in every\r\nrural community four or five hundred years ago. No wonder, then, our\r\n‘Hedgers’ and ‘Hedgmans’ are to be found whose ancestors were once\r\noccupied in setting up these pretty barriers. An old song of James I.’s\r\nday says:—\r\n\r\n            Come all you farmers out of the country,\r\n            Carters, ploughmen, _hedgers_, and all;\r\n            Tom, Dick, and Will, Ralph, Roger, and Humphrey,\r\n            Leave off your gestures rusticall.[250]\r\n\r\nIf stakes or pales were used, it is to our ‘Pallisers’ and obsolete\r\n‘Herdleres’ our forefathers looked to set them up. The former term I\r\nhave but come across once as an absolute surname, but such entries as\r\n‘Robert Redman, palayser,’ or ‘James Foster, palycer,’ are to be met\r\nwith occasionally, and at once testify to the origin of the term as\r\nfound in our existing registers. ‘Pallister,’ too, is not obsolete;\r\nstrictly speaking, the feminine form of the above. I find it written\r\n‘Pallyster’ and ‘Palyster’ in an old Yorkshire inventory. But there is\r\none more term belonging to this group which I am afraid has disappeared\r\nfrom our family nomenclature—that of ‘Tiner,’ he who tined or mended\r\nhedges. A ‘John le Tynere’ occurs in the Parliamentary Writs. We are\r\nreminded by Verstigan’s book on ‘Decayed Intelligence’ that ‘hedging and\r\ntining’ was a phrase in vogue not more than 200 years ago. Mr. Taylor,\r\nin his ‘Words and Places,’ connects our ‘tine’ in the ‘tines of a stag’s\r\nhorns’ or ‘the tines of a fork,’ with the same root implying a ‘twig.’\r\nIn our old English forest law a ‘tineman’ was an officer very similar to\r\nthe ‘hayward,’ the only apparent difference being that he served by\r\nnight. The two terms are exactly similar in sense. We are not without\r\nrelics, too, of our former means and methods of enriching the glebe.\r\nEven here several interesting memorials are preserved to us.\r\n‘Marler,’[251] ‘Clayer,’ and ‘Chalker’ (‘Alice le Marlere,’ A., ‘Thomas\r\nle Chalker,’ A., ‘Simon le Clayere,’ A.), still existing, remind us how\r\ncommonly the land was manured with marl and other substances of a\r\ncalcareous nature. Trevisa, writing upon this very subject, says—‘Also\r\nin this land (England), under the turf of the land, is good marl found.\r\nThe thrift of the fatness drieth himself (itself) therein, so that even\r\nthe thicker the field is marled, the better corn will it bear.’[252] An\r\nold rhyme says:—\r\n\r\n                He that marles sand may buy land;\r\n                He that marles moss shall suffer no loss;\r\n                But he that marles clay throws all away.\r\n\r\nAn interesting surname of this class is that of ‘Acreman,’ or, as it is\r\nnow generally spelt, ‘Acherman,’ ‘Akerman,’ or ‘Aikman,’ for it is far\r\nfrom being of modern German introduction, as some have supposed. In the\r\nHundred Rolls and elsewhere it appears in such entries as ‘Alexander le\r\nAcherman,’ ‘Roger le Acreman,’ ‘Peter le Akerman,’ and ‘John le\r\nAkurman.’ His was indeed a common and familiar sobriquet, and we are but\r\nonce more reminded by it of the day when the _acre_ was what it really\r\ndenoted—the ager, or land open to tillage, without thought of definite\r\nor statute measure. Indeed, it is quite possible the term was at first\r\nstrictly applied thus, for a contemporaneous poem has the following\r\ncouplet:—\r\n\r\n                    The foules up, and song on bough,\r\n                    And acremen yede to the plough.\r\n\r\nIf this be the case the surname is but synonymous with ‘Plowman’ and\r\n‘Tillman,’ already referred to.\r\n\r\nA curious name is found in the writs of this period, and one well worthy\r\nof mention, that of ‘Adam le Imper.’ An ‘imp,’ I need scarcely remind\r\nthe reader, was originally a ‘scion’ or ‘offshoot,’ whether of plants or\r\nanimals, the former seemingly most common, to judge from instances. That\r\nnothing more than this was intended by it we may prove by Archbishop\r\nTrench’s quotation from Bacon, where he speaks of ‘those most virtuous\r\nand goodly young imps, the Duke of Suffolk and his brother.’[253]\r\nChaucer says that of\r\n\r\n                 feble trees their comen wretched imps—\r\n\r\nand ‘Piers Plowman’ uses the word still more explicitly—\r\n\r\n                       I was some tyme a frere\r\n                       And the conventes gardyner\r\n                       For to graffen impes,\r\n\r\nhe says. This latter quotation explains the surname. ‘Imper,’ doubtless,\r\nsimply differed from ‘Gardiner’ or ‘Gardner’ in that he was more\r\nparticularly engaged in the grafting of young shoots.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of the last we may fitly turn to the subject of\r\nfruits. There can be no doubt that in early days, so far at least as the\r\nsouth, and more particularly the south-west of England was concerned,\r\nthe vine was very generally cultivated by the peasantry, and the wine\r\nmade therefrom, however poor it might be, used by them. So early as\r\nDomesday Survey a ‘Walter Vinitor’ lived in Surrey, and a century or two\r\nlater such names as ‘Symon le Vynur,’ or ‘William le Viner,’ or ‘Roger\r\nle Vynour,’ the ancestry of our ‘Viners,’ show that the vine-dresser’s\r\noccupation was not yet extinct. We have long left the production of this\r\nbeverage, however, to the sunnier champaign lands of the Continent, and\r\nare content by paying a higher price to get a richer and fuller juice.\r\nOur ‘Dressers’ may either belong to this or the curriers’ fraternity. An\r\nold poem, which I have already had occasion to quote, says—\r\n\r\n                 In tyme of harvest merry it is enough,\r\n                 Pears and apples hangeth on bough,\r\n                 The hayward bloweth merry his horne,\r\n                 In every felde ripe is corne,\r\n                 The grapes hongen on the vyne,\r\n                 Swete is trewe love and fyne.\r\n\r\nWe have here the mention of pears and apples. The cultivation of these\r\nby our ‘Orcharders,’ or ‘de la Orchards,’ or ‘de la Apelyards,’ was a\r\nfamiliar occupation, and ‘le Cyderer,’[254] and ‘le Perriman,’ or\r\n‘Pearman,’ and ‘le Perrer,’ testify readily as to the use to which they\r\nwere put. The home-made drinks of these early days were almost all\r\nsweet. Such decoctions as mead, piment, or hippocras, in the absence of\r\nsugar, were mingled with honey. We can at once understand, therefore,\r\nwhat an important pursuit would that be of the bee-keeper.[255] Not\r\nmerely did the occasional husbandman possess his two or three hives, but\r\nthere were those who gave themselves up wholly to the tendence of bees,\r\nand who made for themselves a comfortable livelihood in the sale of\r\ntheir produce. Many of our surnames still bear testimony to this.\r\n‘Beman,’ or ‘Beeman,’ or ‘Beaman,’ will be familiar to all, and\r\n‘Honeyman’ is scarcely less common. In an old roll of 1183 we have the\r\nname Latinised in such an entry as ‘Ralph Custosapium.’ But not merely\r\nhoney, but spices of all kinds were also infused into these various\r\ndrinks, whether of wine or ale. We have a well-drawn picture of this in\r\nPiers Plowman’s vision where ‘Glutton’ comes across Beton the Brewstere,\r\nand the latter bidding him good-morrow, says—\r\n\r\n                ‘I have good ale, gossib,’ quoth she,\r\n                ‘Glutton, wilt thou assaye?’\r\n                ‘Hast thou aught in thy purse,’ quoth he;\r\n                ‘Any hote spices?’\r\n                ‘I have pepir, and peonies,’ quoth she,\r\n                ‘And a pound of garleck,\r\n                And a farthing-worth of fenel-seed\r\n                For fastyng dayes.’\r\n\r\nSuch an array of hot ingredients as this poor Glutton could not resist,\r\nand instead of going to Mass he turned into the tavern, and having\r\nsupped\r\n\r\n                          A galon and a gille,\r\n\r\nof course got uproariously drunk. Thus we see how natural it is we\r\nshould come across such names as ‘Balmer,’ or ‘le Oyncterer,’ or ‘le\r\nHoincter,’ as it is also registered, or ‘le Garlyckmonger,’ in our early\r\nrecords. The first still exists. The second does not, but the cumbersome\r\nand ungainly appearance of the last affords sufficient excuse for its\r\nabsence. It is quite possible, however, that our ‘Garlicks’ are but a\r\ncurtailment of it, and this is the more likely, as such forms as ‘Henry\r\nle Garleckmonger,’ or ‘Thomas le Garlykmonger,’ are commonly found, and\r\nevidently represented an important occupation. The Normans, like the\r\nSaxons, loved a highly stimulative dish, and garlic sauce went to\r\neverything; bird, beast, fish, all alike found their seasoning in a\r\nconcoction of which this acrid and pungent herb was the chief\r\ningredient. ‘Roger le Gaderer,’ or as we should now say ‘Gatherer,’ has\r\nleft no descendant, but he may be mentioned as representing a more\r\ngeneral term for many of the above.\r\n\r\nIn the woodlands and its open glades and devious windings, where several\r\nof these herbalists I have mentioned would be often found, we shall see,\r\ntoo, other frequenters. It would be here, subject to the condition of\r\nagistment and pannage, our ‘Swinnarts,’ or swineherds, tended their\r\nhogs. It would be here by the hazel bank and deeper forest pathways our\r\n‘Nutters’ and ‘Nutmans’ would be found, as the autumn began to set in,\r\nand browner and more golden tints to fleck the trees and hedgerows. It\r\nwould be here, as the chills of early winter drew on, and the fallen\r\nleaves lay strewn around, our ‘Bushers’ or ‘Boshers’ (relics of the old\r\n‘John le Busscher’ or ‘Reginald le Buscher’), and our more Saxon ‘Thomas\r\nle Woderes,’ ‘Robert Wudemongers,’ and ‘Alan le Wodemans’ (now\r\n‘Woodyers’ and ‘Woodmans’), would be occupied in gathering the refuse\r\nbranches for firing purposes—here our ‘Hewers’ (once found as ‘Ralph le\r\nHeuer’) and more specific ‘Robert le Wodehewers,’[256] our ‘Hackers’ and\r\n‘Hackmans,’ would be engaged in chopping timber, perchance for building\r\npurposes, perchance for our ‘Ashburners,’[257] to procure their potash\r\nfrom. Oftentimes, no doubt, would these various frequenters of the\r\nwoodland boscage be roused from their rude labours to watch as the\r\nhornblower (now ‘Hornblow’) awoke the shrill echoes, the lordly chase\r\nsweep through the glade till it was hidden by the embrasures of the\r\nforest, or the darkening twilight, or the bending hill.\r\n\r\nOne single glance backward over the names we have so far recorded in\r\nthis chapter, and one thing will be obvious—their all but entirely Saxon\r\ncharacter. Our agriculture terms, whether with regard to the work itself\r\nor the labourer, belong to the earlier tongue. There is nothing\r\nsurprising in this. While in the nomenclature of trade we find the\r\nsuperior force and energy of the Norman temperament struggling with and\r\noftentimes overcoming the more sober humour of the conquered race, in\r\nthe country and all the pursuits of the country the latter was far ahead\r\nof its rival. It was better versed in agricultural pursuits, and ever\r\nretained them in its own hands. At the same time, as we well know, this\r\nvery detention was but the mark of its defeat and the badge of its\r\nslavery. It was a victory where, nevertheless, all is lost. Wamba the\r\njester, in ‘Ivanhoe,’ if I may be excused such a trite illustration,\r\nreminds us that our cattle, while in the field, and under the\r\nguardianship of the enslaved Saxon, were called by the Saxon terms of\r\n‘ox,’ ‘sheep,’ and ‘calf,’ but served upon the tables of their lords\r\nbecame Norman ‘beef,’ ‘mutton,’ and ‘veal’—that is, while the former\r\n_fed them_, the latter it was that _fed on them_. Thus in the same way,\r\nif those homely pursuits which attached to the tilling of the soil, the\r\nbreeding of cattle, the gathering in and the storing of the harvest—if\r\nthese maintained the terms which belonged to them ere the Conquest, they\r\nare so many marks of serfdom. Provided the supply on his board was only\r\nprofuse enough, the proud baron troubled himself little as to the\r\nsupplier, or how or under what names it was procured. See how true this\r\nis from our nomenclature. There is a little word which has dropped from\r\nour lips which once played an important part in our vocabulary—I mean\r\nthat of ‘herd’—not as applied to the flock, but the keeper. We still use\r\nit familiarly in compounds, such as _swineherd_ or _shepherd_, but that\r\nit once had a separate existence of its own is proved by the many\r\n‘Heards,’ or ‘Herds,’ or ‘Hurds,’ that still abound surnominally in our\r\nmidst; relics as they are of the ‘John le Hirdes,’ or ‘Alice la Herdes,’\r\nor ‘Robert le Hyrdes,’ of our olden records. Chaucer so uses it. We now\r\nspeak of our Lord as the ‘Good Shepherd.’ He, however, gives us the\r\nsimpler form where St. Urban is made to say—\r\n\r\n               ‘Almighty Lord, O Jesu Christ,’ quoth he,\r\n               ‘Sower of chaste counsel, herd of us all.’\r\n\r\nThus again, in the ‘Townley Mysteries’ the angel who visited the\r\nshepherds as they kept their flocks by night is represented as arousing\r\nthem by saying—\r\n\r\n                         Herkyn, hyrdes, awake!\r\n\r\nSee now the many compounds of which this purely Saxon word is the root.\r\nAre we in the low-lying pastures. In our ‘Stotherds’ and ‘Stothards,’\r\nour ‘Stoddarts’ and ‘Stoddards,’ still clings the remembrance of the old\r\n_stot_ or bullock-herd; in our ‘Yeatherds’ (as in our ‘Yeatmans’), the\r\nheifer herd; and in our ‘Cowards,’ far from being so pusillanimous as\r\nthey look, the homely ‘cowherd.’ In ‘William and the Werfolf’ we are\r\ntold—\r\n\r\n                   It bifel in that forest\r\n                     There fast byside,\r\n                   There woned (dwelt) a wel old churl\r\n                     That was a couherde.\r\n\r\nNor are these all. In our ‘Calverts’ and ‘Calverds’ we are reminded of\r\nthe once well-known ‘Warin le Calveherd,’ or ‘William le Calverd,’ as I\r\nfind him recorded; in our ‘Nuttards’ the more general but now faded\r\n‘neteherd’ or ‘noutherd,’[258] and in our obsolete ‘John Oxenhyrds’ and\r\n‘Peter Oxherds,’ the familiar ox. Are we in the grazing paddock. In our\r\n‘Coultherds,’ ‘Coulthards,’ and ‘Coultards’ (‘John Colthird,’ W. 9), not\r\nto mention our ‘Coultmans’ and ‘Coltmans,’ we have ample trace of their\r\npresence. Are we again on the bleak hill-side. The sheep have given us\r\nour ‘Shepherds,’ the rams our ‘Wetherherds’ (now generally written\r\n‘Weatherheads’), the kids our ‘Gottards,’ not to say some of our\r\n‘Goddards,’ memorials of the once common goatherd. Are we under the\r\nwoodland pathways where the beech-nuts abound. There, too, the herd was\r\nto be found, for in our ‘Swinnarts,’ ‘Hoggarts,’ and ‘Sowards’ we are\r\nnot without a further token of his usefulness. In three instances I have\r\nfound ‘herd’ connected with the winged creation. In the _Parliamentary\r\nWrits_ occurs ‘William le Swonherde,’ in the _Corpus Christi Guild_\r\n(Surt. Soc.), ‘Agnes Gusehyrd’ and ‘Joan Gusehyrd,’ and in the _Hundred\r\nRolls_ ‘Henry le Rocherde,’ _i.e._, rook-herd.[259] ‘Swanherd’ reminds\r\nus that swans were an important article of diet in early times. In 1482\r\nan Act was passed forbidding any but freeholders (and they only if they\r\nhad lands of the annual value of five marks) to have marks or games of\r\nswans. (‘Stat. Realm,’ vol. ii. p. 447.)\r\n\r\nIt will have already become clear to the reader that this term ‘herd’\r\nplayed no unimportant part in the vocabulary of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries. But even now we have not done. For instance, our\r\n‘Stobbarts’ and ‘Stubbards’ are manifestly descendants of such a name as\r\n‘Alice Stobhyrd’ or ‘Thomas Stobart,’ the owners of both of which are\r\nset down in the Black Book of Hexham Priory in company with ‘John\r\nStodard,’ ‘William Oxhyrd,’ and ‘Thomas Schipherde.’[260] I should have\r\nbeen in some difficulty in regard to the meaning of this ‘stob’ or\r\n‘stub’ had not Mr. Halliwell in his dictionary of archaic words given it\r\nas an old rural term for a bull. This surname, therefore, is\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for. I cannot be quite so positive with regard\r\nto our ‘Geldards’ and ‘Geldarts,’ but I strongly suspect their early\r\nancestor was but a _confrère_ of the swineherd or hogherd, ‘gelt,’ or\r\n‘geld,’ as a porcine title, being a familiar word to our forefathers of\r\nthat date. Our ‘Gattards’ and ‘Gathards,’ too, may be mentioned as but\r\nmediævalisms for the goatherd, ‘Gateard’ and ‘Gatherd’ being met with in\r\nNorth English records contemporaneously with the above. Such a sobriquet\r\nas ‘Adam le Gayt,’ while it may be but a form of the old ‘wayt’ or\r\nwatchman, is, I imagine, but representative of this northern\r\nprovincialism. It occurs locally in ‘William de Gatesden’ or ‘John de\r\nGatesden,’ both found in the Parliamentary Writs. With two more\r\ninstances I will conclude. In our ‘Hunnards’ still lives the memory of\r\n‘Helyas le Hunderd,’ the old houndsman, while in ‘Richard le Wodehirde’\r\nor ‘William le Wodehirde’ we have but another, though more general,\r\nsobriquet of one of those many denizens of the forest I have already\r\nhinted at. How purely Saxon are all these names! What a freshness seems\r\nto breathe about them! What a fragrance as of the wild heather and\r\nthyme, and all that is sweet and fresh and free! And yet they are but so\r\nmany marks of serfdom.\r\n\r\nI have just incidentally referred to the swineherd. It is difficult for\r\nus, in this nineteenth century of ours, to conceive the vast importance\r\nof this occupation in the days of which we are writing. Few avocations\r\nhave so much changed as this. Hog-tending as a distinct livelihood is\r\nwell-nigh extinct. Time was, however, when the rustic community lived\r\nupon bacon, when the surveillance of swine was a lazy, maybe, but\r\nnevertheless an all-important care. We still speak of a ‘flitch of\r\nbacon,’ a term which, while etymologically the same as ‘flesh,’ shows\r\nhow to the early popular mind that article represented the sum total of\r\n_carnal_ luxuries. Our use of the word ‘brawn’ is of an equally\r\ntell-tale character. Every one knows what we mean by brawn. Originally,\r\nhowever, it was the flesh of any animal. Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n               The Miller was a stout carl for the nones,\r\n               Full big he was of brawn, and eke of bones.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the wild boar had been brought down, and salted, and put\r\naside for winter use, how natural that to the housewife it should\r\nengross this general sense. It is to the importance this\r\nunsavoury-looking animal held in the eyes of early rustics we must\r\nattribute the fact of so many names coming down to us connected with its\r\nkeep. As I have just hinted, such sobriquets as ‘John le Swineherd’ or\r\n‘Nicholas le Hogherd’ were common enough in the country parts, our\r\n‘Swinnarts’ and ‘Hoggarts’ being witnesses. The sowherd remains in our\r\n‘Sowards,’ and is as Saxon as the others. The same tongue is strong\r\nagain in our ‘Pigmans’ ‘Sowmans,’ ‘Hogmans,’ and still more secluded\r\n‘Denyers’ and ‘Denmans.’ The Norman, however, is to be accredited with\r\nour many ‘Gilbert le Porchers’ and ‘Thomas le Porkeres,’ by which we may\r\nsee that when daintily served up under the name of ‘pork’ it was not\r\ndisdained on the baron’s table. Lastly, we may mention our early ‘Philip\r\nle Lardiners’ and ‘Hugh le Lardiners,’ names that in themselves suggest\r\nto us the one purpose of the herdsman, the fattening of his charge. They\r\nwould be found generally, therefore, neath the fastnesses of the forest,\r\nwhere the\r\n\r\n                 Oak with his nuts larded many a swine,\r\n\r\nand where the mast and beech-nuts abounded, the chief pannage, it would\r\nseem, of that day.[261] Higher up, as far indeed as the bleak and barren\r\nwolds, the shepherd cared for and tended his flock. His was a common\r\noccupation, too, as our nomenclature shows. Evidently he was as prone in\r\nthose days to the oaten reed as the poets of all ages have loved to\r\ndepict him, for it is to his Norman-introduced name of ‘Berger’ we owe\r\nthe ‘bergeret,’ or pastoral ode. The song indeed, so called, has died\r\naway from our ears, but ‘Berger,’ or ‘Bercher,’ as it was often written,\r\nstill lives, and may carry us back for a moment to these wholesomer\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nNor, if we approach more closely to the farmyard enclosure, are we\r\nwithout memorials. The _farm_ of old, as applied to the soil, was of\r\ncourse that piece of land which was rented for agricultural purposes,\r\nand I doubt not the chief of the old ‘Robert le Fermers’ and ‘Matilda le\r\nFermeres’ represent this more confined sense. ‘Farmer,’ whether\r\ncolloquially or in our registers, is the modern form. Udal, however,\r\nmaintains the more antique dress, when he says, ‘And that the thyng\r\nshould so be, Chryst Hymself had signyfied to fore by the parable of the\r\nhusbandmen or fermers.’\r\n\r\nWhile ‘herd,’ as a root-word, implied the tendance of cattle in the\r\nmeadows and woods and on the hillsides, ‘man,’ I suspect, was equally\r\nsignificative of their guardianship in the stable and the yard. Thus if\r\nthe ‘_cowherd_’ was in the field, the ‘_cowman_’ would be in the stall.\r\nWe may here, therefore, set our familiar ‘Cowmans,’ ‘Bullmans,’\r\n‘Heiffermans,’ and ‘Steermans,’ or ‘Stiermans.’[262] One or two\r\nprovincialisms, I imagine, have added also to this stock. Mr. Lower\r\nthinks our ‘Twentymans’ to be derived from ‘Vintenarius,’ a captain of\r\ntwenty. This may be so, but I suspect the more correct origin will be\r\nfound in ‘twenterman’ or ‘twinterman,’ he who tended the ‘_twenters_’ or\r\n‘_twinters_,’ the old and once familiar ‘two-winter,’ or, as we now\r\ngenerally say, ‘two-year-old.’ If the ‘steer,’ the ‘heifer,’ the ‘cow,’\r\nand the ‘bull’ gave a sobriquet to the farm labourer, why not this? As a\r\nfarmyard term it occurs in every provincial record of the fifteenth and\r\neven sixteenth century. Thus, to quote but one instance, I find in a\r\nwill dated 1556 mention made of ‘6 oxen, item, 18 sterres (steers),\r\nitem, 11 heifers, item, 21 twenters, item, 23 stirks.’ (Richmondshire\r\nWills, p. 93.) An inventory of the same date includes ‘3 kye, item, one\r\nwhye.’ This latter term was equally commonly used at this period for a\r\n‘heifer.’ Our ‘Whymans’ and ‘Wymans’ will, we may fairly surmise, be\r\ntheir present memorial. ‘Cowman,’ mentioned above, was met by the Norman\r\n‘Vacher,’ such entries as ‘John le Vacher’ or ‘Walter le Vacher’ being\r\ncommon, and as ‘Vacher,’ or more corruptly ‘Vatcher,’ it still abides in\r\nour midst. ‘Thomas le Stabeler,’ or ‘William le Stabler,’ too, are yet\r\nwith us; but descendants for ‘Thomas le Milkar’ or ‘William le Melker’\r\nare, I fear, wanting. A Norman representative for these latter is found\r\nin the Parliamentary Writs in the case of ‘John le Lacter.’ There is the\r\nsmack of a kindred labour in the registered ‘Thomas le Charner,’ for I\r\ndoubt not his must have been but an antique dress of ‘Churner.’ Another\r\nform is found in an old Richmondshire will dated 1592, where mention is\r\nmade of ‘Robert Chirner’ and his sister ‘Jane Chirner.’ As an additional\r\nproof that his occupation was such as I have surmised, I may add that in\r\nthe same record in the valuation of household property the _churn_ is\r\nspelt _chirne_. (Richmondshire Wills, p. 235, note.) The most\r\ninteresting sobriquet of this class, and the one which has left the most\r\nmemorials, is found in such mediæval names as ‘Cecilia le Day,’ or\r\n‘Christiana la Daye,’ or ‘Stephen le Dagh.’ A ‘day’ was a dairyman, of\r\nwhich word it is but another form. Chaucer, in one of the most charming\r\nof his descriptions, tells us of a poor widow, how that she—\r\n\r\n            Since that day that she was last a wife\r\n            In patience led a ful simple life,\r\n            For litel was her cattle, and her rent:\r\n            By husbandry of such as God her sent\r\n            She found herself and eke her doughtren two.\r\n                 ————\r\n            Her board was served most with white and black,\r\n            Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,\r\n            Singed bacon, and sometimes an egg or twey,\r\n            For she was as it were a maner _dey_.[263]\r\n\r\nThe present representatives of this name are met with in the several\r\nforms of ‘Deye,’ ‘Daye,’ ‘Day,’ ‘Dayman,’ and the more unpleasantly\r\ncorrupted ‘Deman.’\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, judging from the places of abode in which we find\r\nour early ‘Fishers’ and ‘Fishermans,’ that it is to followers, though\r\nprofessional, of the quaint and gentle-minded Izaac Walton we owe our\r\nmany possessors of these names, rather than to the dwellers upon the\r\ncoast, although both, doubtless, are represented. Such entries as\r\n‘Margaret le Fischere,’ or ‘Henry le Fissere,’ or ‘Robert le Fiscere’\r\nare very common. This latter seems a sort of medium between the others\r\nand such a more hard form as ‘Laurence le Fisker.’ The finny species\r\nthemselves gave us such sobriquets as ‘John le Fysche’ or ‘William\r\nFyske,’ and both ‘Fish’ and ‘Fisk’ still exist amongst us. The Norman\r\nangler is seen in ‘Godard le Pescher’ or ‘Walter le Pecheur,’ while\r\n‘Agnes le Pecheresse’ bespeaks the fact that even women did not disdain\r\nthe gentle art.\r\n\r\nBut the moment we hint of the village streamlet we are thrown upon a\r\nsubject vast indeed—the mill and the miller. He was emphatically, you\r\nsee, _the_ miller. Even now, in these busy grasping days, when we have\r\ncotton mills and saw mills, silk mills and powder mills, mills for this\r\nand mills for that, still it never occurs to us, when we talk of the\r\nmiller, that any one could possibly mistake our meaning. And well may it\r\nbe so, for it is with him we entwine pleasant remembrances of the\r\ncountry, the wheel, the stream, the lusty dimpled trout; with him we\r\nassociate all of comfortable, peaceful content. A white jacket and a\r\nwhite cap, with a black coat for Sundays—how black it would look to be\r\nsure—a bluff, good-humoured face, a friendly nod, and a blithe\r\ngood-morrow, up early and to bed betimes, and his memoir is written, and\r\na very pleasant memoir, too, with a moral to boot for discontented folk,\r\nwould they but see it. The old word for mill was ‘milne,’ hence we still\r\nhave the earlier form, ‘Milnes’ and ‘Milner’ being nearly as familiar to\r\nus in that respect as ‘Mills’ and ‘Miller.’ Besides these we have\r\n‘Milman’ and ‘Milward,’ who once, no doubt, acted as custodian, the\r\nmodern ‘man on the premises,’ in fact.[264] The ancestry of all these is\r\nproved by such registered forms as ‘John le Mellere,’ ‘William le\r\nMelner,’ ‘Robert le Milleward,’[265] ‘John del Mill,’ or ‘Thomas atte\r\nMilne,’ all of which are found scattered over our earlier rolls.[266]\r\nOur ‘Threshers’ and ‘Taskers’ (Benedict le Tasker,’ H.R.) busied\r\nthemselves in urging the flail. I have only lit upon the latter term\r\nonce as in ordinary colloquial use. Burton in the preface to his\r\n‘Anatomy’ says—‘many poor country-vicars, for want of other means, are\r\ndriven to their shifts,’ and ‘as Paul did, at last turn taskers,\r\nmaltsters, costermongers, graziers, etc.’[267] Our ‘Winners,’ shortened\r\nfrom ‘Winnower,’ winnowed the grain with the fan; our ‘Boulters’ or\r\n‘Bulters,’[268] ‘Siviers’ and ‘Riddlers,’ (‘Geoffrey le Boltere,’ A.,\r\n‘William Rydler,’ Z., ‘Ralph le Siviere,’ A.), still more carefully\r\nseparated the flour from the bran. How beautifully Shakespeare presses\r\nthis into his imagery many will remember, where Florizel speaks of—\r\n\r\n                   The fanned snow that’s bolted\r\n                   By the northern blasts twice o’er.\r\n\r\nOur Bible translators, too, must have yet been familiar with the simpler\r\nprocess of this earlier time when they rendered one of the prophet’s\r\nhappier foretellings into the beautiful Saxon we still possess:—‘The\r\noxen likewise, and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean\r\nprovender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.’\r\nThe manufacture or use of the fan wherewith to purge the flour made our\r\n‘Walter le Vanners,’ ‘Simon le Fanneres,’ ‘Richard atte Vannes,’ or\r\n‘William atte Fannes,’ familiar names at this time. In Cocke Lorelle’s\r\nBote, we find among other craftsmen—\r\n\r\n                   Barbers, bokebynders, and lymners;\r\n                   Repers, _faners_, and horners.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, too, our ‘Shovellers’ and more common ‘Showlers,’\r\n‘showl’ being ever the vulgar form. It was for no purpose of rhyme, only\r\nthe word is so used where we are asked—\r\n\r\n                        ‘Who’ll dig his grave?’\r\n               ‘I,’ said the owl; ‘with my spade and showl\r\n                        I’ll dig his grave.’\r\n\r\nWith these many reminders, it is not likely that either the miller or\r\nhis men are likely to become soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe smithy, of course, was an inseparable adjunct to the small\r\ncommunity. The smith, unlike the wright, was engaged upon the harder\r\nmetals, the latter being incidentally described to us by Chaucer when he\r\nsays of one of his personages in the Reeves Story, that—\r\n\r\n                 He was a well good wright, a carpenter.\r\n\r\nLooking at the many compounds formed from these two roots, we find that\r\nin the main this distinction is maintained. Let us take the wright\r\nfirst. We have but just mentioned ‘Ralph le Siviere,’ or ‘Peter le\r\nSyvyere.’ For him our ‘Sivewrights’ were manifestly occupied, to say\r\nnothing of the farmer’s wife. The farmer himself would need the services\r\nof our ‘Plowwrights’ (‘William le Plowritte,’ A., ‘William le\r\nPloughwryte,’ M.), and would he carry his produce safely to the distant\r\nmarket or fair he must needs have a good stout wain, for the track\r\nathwart the hillside was rough and uneven, and here therefore he must\r\ncall into requisition the skill of our many ‘Wheelwrights,’ or\r\n‘Wheelers,’ ‘Cartwrights’ and their synonymous ‘Wainwrights.’[269]\r\nAdding to these ‘Boatwright,’ or ‘Botwright,’ ‘Shipwright,’ and the\r\nobsolete ‘Slaywright,’ the old loom manufacturer, we see wood to have\r\nbeen the chief object at least of the wright’s attention. But we have\r\nother names of a different character. ‘Limewright’ or ‘Limer’ (‘Hugh le\r\nLimwryte,’ A., ‘John le Limer,’ A.) ceases to maintain this distinction,\r\nso do our ‘Glasswrights,’ equivalent to our ‘Glaziers’ or ‘Glaishers’\r\n(‘Thomas le Glaswryghte,’ X., ‘Walter Glasenwryht,’ W. ii., ‘William\r\nGlaseer,’ Z.).[270] ‘Le Cheesewright,’ or ‘Chesswright,’ like\r\n‘Firminger’ and ‘Casier,’ brings us once more into the scullery, and\r\n‘Breadwright’ into the kitchen. ‘Alwright’ is doubtless but the old\r\n‘alewright,’ and ‘Goodwright,’ which Mr. Lower deems to be a maker of\r\ngoads, I cannot but imagine to be simply complimentary, after the\r\nfashion of many others which I shall mention in another chapter. Our\r\n‘Tellwrights’ or ‘Telwrights’ have given me much trouble, and though at\r\nfirst I did not like it, I think Mr. Lower’s suggestion that they have\r\narisen from the Pauline occupation of tent-making is a natural one.\r\n‘Teld’ was the old English word for a tent. In the metrical Anglo-Saxon\r\nPsalter the fourteenth psalm thus commences—\r\n\r\n              Lord, in thi teld wha sal wone (dwell)?\r\n              In thi hali hille or wha reste mone (shall)?\r\n\r\nWe still speak of a ‘tilt’ when referring to the cover of a cart or\r\nwagon, or to any small awning of a boat. It is quite possible,\r\ntherefore, that the name has originated in the manufacture of such\r\ncanopies as these. Admitting this, I would merely suggest ‘Tilewright’\r\nas requiring but little corruptive influence to bring it into the forms\r\nin which we at present find the word.[271] Should this be the case, we\r\nmust place it with ‘le Tyler,’ of whom we have but recently spoken.\r\n‘Arkwright’ I mention last as being worthy of more extended notice. In\r\nthis is preserved the memory of a once familiar and all-important piece\r\nof cabinet furniture—that of the old-fashioned ark. Much store was set\r\nby this long years ago by the north-country folk, as is shown by the\r\nposition it occupies in antique wills, often being found as the first\r\nlegacy bequeathed.[272] Shaped exactly like the child’s Noah’s ark, it\r\nseems to have had a twofold character. In one it was simply a meal-bin.\r\nThus in the ‘Tale of a Usurer’ we are told:—\r\n\r\n                  When this corn to the kniht was sold,\r\n                  He did it in an arc to hold,\r\n                  And opened this arc the third day.\r\n\r\nIn the other it was more carefully put together. The trick of its secret\r\nspring, known only to the housewife and her lord—sometimes I dare say,\r\nonly to the latter—it contained all the treasure the family could boast.\r\nHere were kept what parchments they possessed; here lay stored up fold\r\non fold of household linen, venerated by the female inmates nearly as\r\nmuch as the grandmothers themselves, whose thrifty fingers had woven it\r\nin days long past and gone. We see thus that upon the whole the wright\r\n_wrought_ his manufacture out of his own more specific material, seldom,\r\nat any rate, poaching upon the preserves of his friend the smith. The\r\nsmith worked in iron and the metals. This good old Saxon name, with the\r\nmany quaint changes that have been rung upon it, deserves a whole\r\nchapter to itself. How then can we hope to do justice to it in a few\r\nsentences? We do not know where to begin, and having once begun, the\r\ndifficulty at once arises as to where we can end. How few of us reflect\r\nupon the close connexion that exists between the anvil and the smith\r\nhimself, and yet it is because he _smote_ thereupon that he got his\r\nname. As old Verstigan has it:—\r\n\r\n          From whence comes Smith, all be he knight or squire,\r\n          But from the smith that forgeth at the fire?\r\n\r\nPutting in all the needs which in this agricultural age his occupation\r\nwould be necessary to supply, still we could scarcely account for the\r\nenormous preponderance he has attained over other artisans, did we not\r\nremember that his services would also be required in the production of\r\nwarlike implements. Sword and ploughshare alike would be to his hands.\r\nChaucer speaks of:—\r\n\r\n                                       The smith\r\n                That forgeth sharpe swords on the stith.\r\n\r\nBetween and including the years 1838 and 1854 there were registered as\r\nborn, or married, or dead, no less than 286,307 Smiths. Were we indeed\r\nto put into one community the persons who bear this name in our land, we\r\nshould have a town larger than Leeds, and scarcely inferior in size and\r\nimportance to that of the capital of the midland counties.\r\n\r\nThe smith is often spoken of colloquially as the blacksmith, a title\r\nwhich, while it has not itself a place in our nomenclature, reminds us\r\nof others that have, and of a peculiar custom of earlier days. The word\r\n‘blacksmith’ dates from the days of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ and it is\r\nquite evident that at that time it was customary for the smith to have\r\nhis name compounded with sobriquets according to the colour of the metal\r\nupon which he spent his energies. Thus the former ‘Thomas Brownesmythe’\r\nevidently worked in copper and brass, ‘William le Whytesmyth’ in\r\ntinplate, ‘John Redesmith’ in gold, a ‘Goldsmith’ in fact; ‘Richard\r\nGrensmythe’ in I am not sure what, unless it be lead; and ‘John\r\nBlackesmythe’ in iron. The last is the only one I fail to discover as\r\nnow existing among our surnames—a circumstance, however, easily\r\naccounted for from the settled position the simple ‘Smith’ himself had\r\nobtained as an artificer of that metal. But these are not the only\r\ncompounds. Our ‘Smiths’ are surrounded with connexions of not merely\r\nevery hue, but every type. Thus ‘Arrowsmith,’ already alluded to with\r\nits contracted ‘Arsmith,’ tells its own tale of archery service;\r\n‘Billsmith’ and ‘Spearsmith’ remind us of the lances, or rather lance\r\nheads, that did such duty in the golden days of Agincourt and Poictiers.\r\nOf a more peaceful nature would be the work of our ‘Nasmyths,’ like our\r\n‘Naylors,’ mere relics of the old nailsmith. Closely connected with\r\nthem, therefore, we may set our ‘Shoosmiths,’[273] but Saxon\r\nrepresentatives of the Norman-introduced ‘Farrier.’ The surname still\r\nclings chiefly to the north of England, where the Saxon, retaining so\r\nmuch more of its strength and vigour than in the south, preserved it as\r\nthe occupative term for centuries. Springtide and the approach of\r\nsheep-washing would see our ‘Sheersmiths’ busy, while the later autumn\r\nwould have its due effect upon the trade of our ‘Sixsmiths’ and\r\n‘Sucksmiths,’ pleasant though curiously corrupted memorials of the old\r\nsicklesmith, or ‘Sykelsmith,’ as I find the name spelt. The bucklesmith\r\n(‘John le Bokelsmythe,’ X.), whose name is referred to in the poem I\r\nhave but recently quoted, has similarly and as naturally curtailed\r\nhimself to ‘Bucksmith.’[274] Our ‘Bladesmiths’ fashioned swords, being\r\nfound generally in fellowship with our ‘Cutlers’ and obsolete\r\n‘Knyfesmythes.’ Our ‘Locksmiths,’ of course, looked to the security of\r\ndoor, and closet, and cupboard;[275] while our ‘Minsmiths’ (‘John le\r\nMynsmuth,’ M.), for I believe they are not as yet quite obsolete, hard\r\nat work in the mint smithy, forged the coin for the early community. As,\r\nhowever, I shall have occasion to refer to him again I shall merely cite\r\nhim, and pass on.[276] But we may see from the little I have said that\r\nthe smith never need fear obsoletism. Apart from his own immediate\r\ncircle, he is surrounded by many, if not needy, yet closely attached\r\nrelatives. We must not forget, however, that the Norman had his smith,\r\ntoo, and though the Saxon, as we have thus seen, has ever maintained his\r\ndignity and position, still our early rolls are not without a goodly\r\nnumber of ‘Adam le Fevres,’ ‘Richard le Fevers,’ or ‘Reginald le\r\nFeures,’ and their cognate ‘Alan le Ferons’ and ‘Roger le Feruns.’\r\nRepresentatives of all these, minus the article, may be readily met with\r\nto-day in any of the large towns of our country.\r\n\r\nWe may take this opportunity of saying a word about lead, inasmuch as\r\nthe uses to which it was put made the manufacturer therein familiar to\r\nrural society. The leadbeater, in fact, was all-important to the\r\nfarmer’s wife and the dairy, for the vessels which held the milk, as it\r\nunderwent its various processes until it was turned out into butter,\r\nwere commonly his handiwork. Such names as ‘Gonnilda le Leadbetre,’ or\r\n‘Reginald le Ledbeter,’ we find in every considerable roll, and our\r\nmodern ‘Leadbeaters,’ ‘Ledbetters,’ ‘Leadbitters,’ ‘Lidbetters,’ and\r\nprobably ‘Libertys,’ are but their descendants. That mixture of lead\r\nwith brass or copper which went by the term of ‘latten’ or ‘laton’ has\r\nleft in our ‘Latoners’ and ‘Latners’ a memorial of the metal of which\r\nour old country churchyard tablets were made, not to say some of the\r\nhousehold utensils just referred to. We find even more costly and\r\nornamental ware manufactured of this, for among other relics preserved\r\nby the pardoner, Chaucer tells us:—\r\n\r\n                He had a gobbet (piece) of the sail\r\n                That seint Peter had, when that he went\r\n                Upon the sea, till Jesu Christ him hent.\r\n                He had a cross of laton, full of stones,\r\n                And in a glass he had pig’s bones.\r\n\r\nSuch a name then as ‘Thomas le Latoner’ or ‘Richard le Latoner’ would be\r\nwell understood by our forefathers.\r\n\r\nBut we must not wander. In nothing does our nomenclature bequeath us a\r\nmore significant record than in that which relates to the isolation of\r\nprimitive life. We who live in such remarkable days of locomotive\r\nappliance cannot possibly enter into the difficulties our forefathers\r\nhad to encounter in regard to intercommunication. An all but impassable\r\nbarrier separated our villages from the larger and distant towns. The\r\nroads, or rather, not to dignify them by such a term, the tracks,[277]\r\nwere sometimes scarce to be recognised, everywhere rough and dangerous.\r\nStreams, oftentimes much swollen, must be forded. Where bridges existed\r\nour ‘Bridgers’ and ‘Bridgemans’ took the king’s levy; where none were to\r\nbe found our ‘Ferrimans’ rendered their necessary aid. The consequent\r\ndifficulties with regard to conveyance were great. The larger of the\r\ncounty towns carried on but an uncertain and irregular communication,\r\nwhile the remoter villages were wholly dependent either on the\r\ntravelling trader or peddler, or on the great fair, as it came round in\r\nits annual course. What a stock of goods would be laid in by the\r\nbustling wife, and the farmer himself on this latter occasion! Imagine\r\nthem starting forth to lay in a supply for a whole year’s wants. No\r\nwonder the good, sound cob and the stout wagon it drew are remembered in\r\nour surnames. Of the importance of the former such names as ‘Horsman,’\r\nif it be not official, and ‘Palfreyman,’ or ‘Palfriman,’ not to mention\r\n‘Asseman,’ are good witnesses. Such entries as ‘Agnes le Horsman,’ or\r\n‘Roger le Palefreyour,’ or ‘John le Palfreyman’ are familiar to every\r\nearly register. Our ‘Tranters’ and ‘Traunters’ are but relics of the old\r\n‘Traventer,’ he who let out posthorses. In process of time, however, he\r\ngot numbered among the many itinerant peddlers or carriers, of whom I\r\nshall speak shortly. Bishop Hall, in one of his Satires, says—\r\n\r\n               And had some traunting chapman to his sire,\r\n               That trafficked both by water and by fire,\r\n\r\nOur ‘Corsers’[278] or ‘Cossers,’ too, little altered from the former ‘le\r\nCorsour,’ represent, as did the obsolete ‘Horsmonger,’ the dealer in\r\nhorseflesh. Another branch of this occupation is represented by our\r\n‘Runchemans,’ ‘Runcimans,’ or ‘Runchmans.’ They dealt in hackney-horses,\r\n‘rounce’ or ‘rouncie’ being the then general term for such. Chaucer’s\r\n‘Shipman’ was mounted upon one—\r\n\r\n                 For aught I wot, he was of Dertemouth,\r\n                 He rode upon a rouncie, as he couthe.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a term applied in common to all manner of horses, and\r\nit is quite possible the names given above must be classed simply with\r\n‘Horseman’ and such like. Brunne, in describing Arthur’s Coronation,\r\nmentions among other his gifts—\r\n\r\n                    Good palfreys he gave to clerks\r\n                    Bows and arrows he gave archers,\r\n                    Runces good unto squiers.[279]\r\n\r\nIn such grand-looking entries as ‘William le Charreter,’ or ‘John le\r\nCaretter,’ or ‘Andrew le Chareter,’[280] we should now scarce recognise\r\nthe humble ‘Carter,’ but so is he commonly set down in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, our ‘cart’ itself being nothing more than the old Norman-French\r\n‘charette,’ so familiarized to us by our present Bible version as\r\n‘chariot.’ This in the edition of 1611 even was spelt after the old\r\nfashion as ‘charet.’ Our ‘Charters’ are evidently but relics of the\r\nfuller form, a ‘John le Charter’ appearing in the Parliamentary\r\nWrits.[281] ‘Char,’ the root of ‘charet,’ still remains with us as\r\n‘car.’ In ‘Cursor Mundi’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                   Nay, sir, but ye must to him fare,\r\n                   He hath sent after thee his chare.\r\n\r\nGower, too, has the word—\r\n\r\n                   With that she looked and was war,\r\n                   Doun fro’ the sky ther cam a char,\r\n                   The which dragons aboute drew.\r\n\r\nThis was used by people of rank as a fashionable vehicle for purposes of\r\npleasure; oftentimes, too, by ladies.[282] Corresponding with the other,\r\nthe driver of such was ‘John le Charer’ or ‘Richard le Charrer,’ the\r\npresent existing forms in our directories being ‘Charman’ and\r\n‘Carman.’[283] ‘Cartman,’ I need not add, is also found as well as\r\n‘Carter.’ All these terms, however, are from the Norman vocabulary. The\r\nSaxon word in general use was ‘wagon’ or ‘wain,’ the conductor of which\r\nnow dwells in our midst as ‘Wagoner’ or ‘Wagner,’ and ‘Wainman’ or\r\n‘Wenman.’ ‘Charles Wain’ or the ‘Churls Wain’ is the name that\r\nconstellation still bears, and which has clung to it, in spite of the\r\nNorman, since the day, a thousand years and more, that the Saxon so\r\nlikened it. As in the case of so many other double words representative\r\nof our twofold language, these two separate terms have come now to\r\ndenote their own specialty of vehicle, and it is even possible that so\r\nearly as the day in which ‘le Wainwright’ and ‘le Cartwright’ took their\r\nrise this distinction had already begun to exist. It is thus our English\r\nlanguage has become so rich, this sheep-and-mutton redundancy of which\r\nWalter Scott in his ‘Ivanhoe’ has so well reminded us. ‘Richard le\r\nDrivere’ or ‘John le Drivere’ of course must be placed here, not to\r\nmention an ‘Alice le Driveress,’ who figures in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nOf such consequence was it that the horse-gear should be carefully put\r\ntogether that it occupied the full attention of several different\r\nartisans. Such names as ‘Benedict le Sporier,’ or ‘Alan le Lorymer,’ or\r\n‘Nicholas le Lorimer,’ are found in every considerable roll of the\r\nperiod, and they still exist. The one of course looked to the rowel, the\r\nother to the bit. ‘John le Sadeler’ needs little explanation, his\r\nposterity being still alive to speak in his behalf. The old\r\nNorman-introduced word for a saddle was ‘sell,’ and that it lingered on\r\nfor a considerable period is shown by Spenser’s use of it, where he\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n              And turning to that place, in which whyleare\r\n              He left his loftie steed with golden sell,\r\n              And goodly gorgeous barbes.\r\n\r\nEvery mediæval roll has its ‘Warin le Seler’ or ‘Thomas le Seller.’[284]\r\nThe pack-saddle was of such importance that it required a special\r\nmanufacturer, and this it had in our now somewhat rare ‘Fusters’ or\r\n‘Fewsters.’[285] In his ‘Memorials of London,’ Mr. Riley mentions a\r\n‘Walter Polyt, fuyster’ (p. xxii.). A fuster was, strictly speaking, a\r\njoiner employed in the manufacture of the saddle-bow, that is, the\r\nwooden framework of the old saddle. It is derived from the French\r\n‘fust,’ wood, and that from the late Latin ‘fustis.’ Our ‘Shoosmiths,’\r\nas I have before hinted, made the horseshoe, while ‘John le Mareshall,’\r\nor ‘Ranulph le Marescal,’ or ‘Osbert le Ferrur,’ or ‘Peter le Ferrour,’\r\nfitted it to the foot. The modern forms are simple ‘Marshall,’ and\r\n‘Ferrier,’ or ‘Ferrer.’ In the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ it is said—\r\n\r\n               For eche a hors that ferroure schalle scho,\r\n               An halpeny on day he takes hym to.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more natural than that the shoeing-forge should become\r\nassociated with the doctoring of horseflesh, but it is somewhat strange\r\nthat when we now speak of a farrier we recognise in this old term[286]\r\nsimply and only the horse-leech. So full of changes are the lives of\r\nwords, as well as places and people.\r\n\r\nA curious insight into mediæval travel is presented to our notice in our\r\n‘Ostlers’ and ‘Oastlers’ and ‘Oslers,’ relics of such old registries as\r\n‘Ralph le Hostiler’ or ‘William le Ostiller.’ This term, once applied,\r\nas it rightly should, to the ‘host’ or ‘hosteller’ himself, has now\r\nbecome confined to the stableman, thus incidentally reminding us how\r\nimportant this part of the hostel duties would be at such a time as I am\r\nendeavouring to describe. The idea of the hosteller being one whose\r\nespecial office it was to tend that which was their sole means of\r\nlocomotion, thus in time resolved itself into a distinct name for that\r\nbranch of his occupation.[287] The old ‘Herberjour’ gave lodging, whence\r\nit is we get our ‘arbour.’ Our kings and barons in their journeys always\r\nkept an officer so termed, whose duty it was to go before and prepare\r\nand make ready for their coming. Owing to the large number of household\r\nattendants for whom lodging was required, this was an important and\r\nresponsible duty. Thus has arisen our ‘harbinger,’ so often poetically\r\napplied to the sun as heralding the approach of day. The older spelling\r\nis preserved in the ‘Canterbury Tales,’ where it is said—\r\n\r\n               The fame anon throughout the town is born,\r\n               How Alla King shal come on pilgrimage,\r\n               By herbergeours that wenten him beforn.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, as applied to lodging-house keepers our many enrolled\r\n‘Herbert le Herberjurs,’ ‘Roger le Herberers,’ ‘William le Herbers,’ or\r\n‘Richard le Harebers,’ are met with, and I doubt not our ‘Harbers’ and\r\n‘Harbours’ are their offspring. In this sense the word is used by our\r\nmediæval writers in all its forms, whether verb, or adjective, or\r\nsubstantive. Tyndale’s version of Romans xii. 13 is, ‘Be ready to\r\nharbour,’ where we now have it ‘given to hospitality.’ Bishop Coverdale,\r\nspeaking of the grave, says—‘_There_ is the harborough of all flesh;\r\nthere lie the rich and the poor in one bed’ (_Fruitful Lessons_). He\r\nadds also, in another place, that Abraham was ‘liberal, merciful, and\r\nharborous’—_i.e._, ready to entertain strangers (_The Old Faith_).\r\nBradford, too, to give but one more quotation, prays God may ‘sweep the\r\nhouses of our hearts, and make them clean, that they may be a worthy\r\nharborough and lodging for the Lord’ (_Bradford’s Works_). Market\r\nHarborough still preserves this old word and its true sense from being\r\nforgotten. With the bearers, therefore, of the above names we may ally\r\nour ‘Inmans’ and ‘Taverners.’ The latter term is frequently found in\r\nearly writings, and was evidently in ordinary use for the occupation—\r\n\r\n                    Ryght as of a tavernere\r\n                    The grene busche that hangeth out\r\n                    Is a sygne, it is no dowte,\r\n                    Outward folkys for to telle\r\n                    That within is wyne to selle.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the tavern has undergone but little change, the inn has.\r\nWith our present Bible an inn is ever a lodging, and this was once the\r\nsole idea the term conveyed. It was not for casual callers by day, but\r\nfor lodgers by night. Thus Chaucer in his ‘Knight’s Tale’ uses the verb—\r\n\r\n               This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,\r\n               When he had brought them into his cite,\r\n               And ynned them, everich (each) at his degre\r\n               He festeth them.\r\n\r\nUntil the fair or wake came on, as I have said, the community in the\r\nmore retired nooks and corners of the country depended entirely on the\r\nmounted merchant. He it was who conveyed to them the gossip of the time.\r\nHe it was, or one of his _confrères_, that brought them everything which\r\nin those days went under the category of small luxuries. The more lonely\r\nparts of the highway were infested by robbers. Hence the pack-horsemen\r\nand other mounted traders generally travelled in company, with jingling\r\nbell and belted sword—a warning to evil-minded roadsters. This was all\r\nthe more necessary as they but seldom kept to the main thoroughfare. A\r\nstraight line between the adjacent hamlets best describes their course.\r\nSuch local terms as ‘Pedlar’s Way,’ or ‘Pedder’s Way,’ or ‘Copmansford,’\r\nstill found in various parts of the country, are but interesting\r\nmemorials of the direct and then lonely route these itinerant traders\r\ntook in passing from one village to another. The number of these\r\nroadsters we cannot otherwise speak of than as that of a small army.\r\nMany of them, so far as our nomenclature is concerned, are now obsolete,\r\nbut not a few still survive. Amongst those of a more general character\r\nwe find ‘Sellman’ or ‘Selman.’[288] From the old verb ‘to pad,’ which is\r\nstill used colloquially in many districts, for the sober and staid pace\r\nthe pack-horsemen preserved, we get our ‘Padmans’ and ‘Pedlers,’ or\r\n‘Pedlars,’ once inscribed as ‘William le Pedeleure’ or ‘Thomas le\r\nPedeler.’ It is of kin to ‘path.’ We still talk of a ‘footpad,’ who not\r\nmore than two centuries ago would also have been spoken of as a\r\n‘padder.’ So late as 1726 Gay, in one of his ballads, says—\r\n\r\n              Will-a-wisp leads the traveller a-gadding\r\n                Through ditch and through quagmire and bog,\r\n              No light can e’er set me a-padding\r\n                But the eyes of my sweet Molly Mogg.\r\n\r\nPerchance of similar origin, but more probably from the old ‘ped,’ the\r\nbasket they carried, are our ‘Pedders,’ ‘Peddars,’ and ‘Pedmans.’\r\n‘Martin le Peddere’ or ‘Hugh le Pedder’ or ‘William Pedman’ was a common\r\nentry at this time. On many parts of the English coast a fish-basket is\r\nstill familiarly known as a ‘ped,’ and Mr. Halliwell, I see, quotes from\r\nanother writer a statement to the effect that in Norwich, up to a recent\r\nday, or even now, an assemblage whither women bring their small wares of\r\neggs, chickens, and other farm produce for sale, is called a\r\n‘ped-market.’ It is likely, therefore, that with these we must ally\r\n‘Godewyn le Hodere’ or ‘John le Hottere,’ who derived their sobriquets,\r\nI doubt not, from the fact of their carrying their _hods_ or panyers on\r\ntheir backs, just as masons do now those wooden trays for mortar which\r\nbear the same name.[289] Their very titles remind us that our ‘Huckers,’\r\n‘Hawkers,’ and ‘Hucksters,’ relics of the old ‘William le Huckere,’\r\n‘Simon le Hauckere,’ or ‘Peter le Huckster,’ were from the first good at\r\nhaggling and chaffering wherever a bargain was concerned. Our ‘Kidders,’\r\nthe ‘William le Kyderes’ of the fourteenth century, were of a similar\r\ntype, whatever their origin, which is doubtful. Probably, however, we\r\nmust refer them to the ‘kid’ or ‘kit,’ the rush-plaited basket they\r\ncarried their goods in. We still speak of ‘the whole kit of them,’\r\nmeaning thereby the collective mass of any set of articles.[290] This\r\nview is strengthened—we might almost say proved—by the fact of a ‘Robert\r\nButrekyde’ being found in the Hundred Rolls of this period. This would\r\nbe a sobriquet given to some one from the basket he was wont to bear to\r\nand from the country market where he carried on his calling. Later on we\r\nfind it used for a large mug or bowl. In the ‘Farming Book of Henry\r\nBest,’ written in 1641, we find it said—‘Some will cutte their cake and\r\nputte (it) into the creame, and this feast is called the creame-potte or\r\ncreame-kitte’ (p. 93). The kidder’s usual _confrère_ was the ‘Badger’—up\r\nto the seventeenth century an ordinary term for one who had a special\r\nlicence to purchase corn from farmers at the provincial markets and\r\nfairs, and then dispose of it again elsewhere without the penalties of\r\nengrossing. It is generally said the sobriquet arose from the habits of\r\nthe four-legged animal of that name in stealing and storing up the\r\ngrain. The more probable solution, however, is that it is but a\r\ncorruption of ‘baggager,’ from his method of carriage.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget in our list of early English strolling merchants\r\nthat the wandering friars themselves were oftentimes to be met with\r\nbearing treasure wherewith to tempt the housewife, and no bad\r\nbargainers, if we may accept the statement made against them by an old\r\npolitical song:—\r\n\r\n                  There is no pedler that pak can bere,\r\n                  That half so dere can selle his gere,\r\n                    Than a frere can do;\r\n                  For if he give a wyfe a knyfe\r\n                    That cost but penys two,\r\n                  Worthe ten knyves, so may I thrive,\r\n                    He wyl have ere he go.[291]\r\n\r\nOur ‘Tinklers’ and ‘Tinkers,’ like our more northern ‘Cairds,’ seem to\r\nhave been scarcely removed in degree from the strolling gipsies. They\r\nacquired their name from the plan they adopted of heralding their coming\r\nby striking a kettle, a plan of attracting attention more euphoniously\r\npractised by our bellmen, with whom we are still familiar. Such names as\r\n‘Alice Tynkeller’ in the fourteenth century, or ‘Peter le Teneker’ found\r\nin the thirteenth century, show how early had this method been adopted\r\nand the sobriquet given.[292] Last, but not least, come our ‘Chapman’ or\r\n‘Copeman’[293] and ‘Packman.’[294] The former is sometimes met with as\r\n‘Walter’ or ‘John le Chepman,’ which at once reminds us of his origin,\r\nthat of the ‘cheap-man,’ or ‘cheap-jack,’ as we should now style him.\r\nThe old ‘cheaping,’ or ‘chipping,’ a market-place, still lingers locally\r\nin such place-names as ‘Chipping-Norton,’ or ‘Chipping-Camden,’ or the\r\nlocal surname ‘Chippendale;’ and the verb ‘to chop’—_i.e._, to purchase,\r\nI believe, is not yet extinct amongst us. The once common phrase for\r\nselling and exchanging was ‘chopping and changing.’ Coverdale uses it.\r\nSpeaking of Christ driving out the money-changers from the Temple, he\r\nsays, ‘The Temple was ordained for general prayer, thanksgiving, and\r\npreaching, and not for chopping and changing, or other such like things’\r\n(_The Old Faith_). Thus the term ‘chapman’ would be no unmeaning one to\r\nour forefathers. But we must give him a paragraph to himself.\r\n\r\nThe chapman, you must know, was a great man. According to more modern\r\nusage, he had a fixed residence, but we may still see him at times,\r\nafter the olden fashion, travelling about in a large booth-like\r\nconveyance or rumble. This vehicular mode of transit set him far above\r\nthe rank of ordinary footpads. He was a sort of pedlar in high life, in\r\nfact, and if his position was lofty, his abilities were generally equal\r\nto a performance of its duties. O the sensation his arrival caused! The\r\nvillage green was instantly instinct with life. From impossible nooks\r\nand crannies surged forth a small army of all ages. Hoarded pennies or\r\ntwopennies were drawn forth from cherished hiding-places, and flinty\r\nmaternal pockets were for the nonce assailed with comparative success.\r\nTo the young folks it was the next best thing to Punchinello, the\r\nchapman was so funny. Besides, he had so many things wherewith to tempt\r\ntheir juvenile fancy. What was there he had not? Everything that could\r\nunder any lax code of fancy possibly or impossibly come under the\r\nall-expansive term of hardware was crowded within the magic recesses of\r\nthat chapman’s van. Dolls and dishes, scissors and hats, cornplasters\r\nand cosmetics, lollipops in the shape of soldiers, and lollipops in the\r\nshape of windmills issued forth in a succession as insinuating to the\r\npurse as it was tempting to the imagination. And what a man was Jack\r\nhimself; he had a joke for everyone, a frown for none. His face was an\r\never-changing picture, bluffed by the wind and burnt by the sun; still\r\nit was ever cheery withal, now demure, half waggish, half impudent, anon\r\nall benevolence as he details the merits of his latest painless\r\ncorn-suppressing plaster, and assures the gaping swains that his sole\r\nobject in life, since the happy moment when he first became acquainted\r\nwith its virtues, has been to carry through the world the blissful\r\ntidings to suffering man. All this, he adds, with reckless impudence,\r\nhas been done at a great personal pecuniary sacrifice; but an approving\r\nconscience, and the blessings showered upon his head by the recipients\r\nof his generosity, have been his ample reward. Of course they sell like\r\nwildfire, and the profits are enormous.[295]\r\n\r\nOur ‘Packmans,’ ‘Paxmans,’ and perhaps ‘Packers,’ were, as a rule, the\r\nvillage commissioners.[296] What a simple and homely state of life do\r\ntheir names suggest. No half-hourly omnibus, or still more frequent\r\ntrain, whisked off the bustling housewife to the big town—now some\r\nsleepy old place with grass-grown streets, and half a century behind the\r\ntimes, where ‘news much older than the ale goes round’—but then the\r\nthrifty emporium of cheese and butter and such like stores, and great in\r\nthe eyes of country bumpkins. No; if you visited the town in those days\r\nyou must make a day of it. And the mistress knew better than do this.\r\nLeave her dairy, forsooth—what would become of the cream if she left\r\nMalkin to forget her work, and talk with Giles the cowboy behind the\r\nstable door all morning? She leave, indeed! Of course she could not, so\r\nthere was the pack-horseman, who for a trifling commission went to and\r\nfrom the market for her and her neighbours. As he returned in the cool\r\nof the evening, when the sun was low and work over, you might see him\r\npausing awhile at the door of the farmsteads, long after he has given\r\nthe mistress her store, and, more slily, Malkin her ribbon. He is in no\r\nhurry now, for he is telling the country folk all the news; how the\r\ngreat world is wagging, and how there has been a great battle with the\r\nFrenchers some six or eight weeks ago (news, good or bad, did not travel\r\nfast in those days). The Frenchmen are looked upon by the simple rustics\r\nas the very impersonification of iniquity, they being under a sort of\r\nimpression that a Frenchman is a being who defies God and man alike, and\r\nwould think no bones of eating you up. At once the packman is plied for\r\na full, true, and particular account of the battle, and he, there being\r\nnone to gainsay his description, and with an eye probably to the good\r\nwife’s best ale, which, as he well knows from experience, will be\r\nbrought forth with a freedom of hospitality proportionate to the horror\r\nof the details, fills up a bloody tale with sundry touches of a most\r\ntragic character, while the country folk gape in wide-mouthed terror,\r\nand the old grandmother cries ‘Lord, ha’ mercy on us!’ His face is lost\r\nto sight once more in the ale jug, and then he passes on to other\r\nsteads, where a similar scene and a similar reward await his thirsty\r\nsoul. Another name in evident use for the packman was that of ‘Sumpter,’\r\n‘Martin le Someter’ or ‘William le Sumeter’ being common entries at this\r\ntime. We are still familiar with the term as applied to the mule or\r\nhorse that carried the baggage, but in a personal sense it has long been\r\nextinct,[297] saving in our directories, where as ‘Sumpter’ and ‘Sumter’\r\nit is by no means seldom met with. How large a load these animals were\r\nrequired to bear we may picture to ourselves from a verse found in\r\n‘Percy’s Reliques’—\r\n\r\n               But, for you have not furniture\r\n                 Beseeming such a guest,\r\n               I bring his owne, and come myselfe,\r\n                 To see his lodging drest.\r\n\r\n               With that two sumpters were discharged,\r\n                 In which were hangings brave,\r\n               Silke coverings, curteins, carpets, plate,\r\n                 And all such turn should have.\r\n\r\nBut useful as were all these various itinerants, it was at the great\r\nyearly wakes or fairs, held in commemoration of the church dedication,\r\nthat the housekeepers round laid in their greatest store. The term\r\n‘wake’ denotes ‘a watching,’ because of the vigil observed during the\r\nnight preceding the festival itself. Indeed ‘wake’ and ‘watch’ were for\r\ncenturies synonymous words.[298] Wicklyffe translates Mark xii.\r\n37—‘Forsooth, that that I say to you, I say to all, Wake ye.’[299] Thus\r\nit is that our ‘Wakemans’ are but memorials of the old village guardian\r\nor night watchman, while our ‘Wakes’ can boast a title dating so far\r\nback as the time when ‘Hereward the Wake,’ or Watchful, was fighting the\r\nlast battle of the down-trodden and oppressed Saxon.[300] These fairs\r\nwere by no means for mere pleasure-seekers, as we might imagine from\r\nsuch a term as ‘church-ale,’ or judging by the aspect of such festivals\r\nin the present day. They had an end to answer, and an important end, and\r\nin early times they fulfilled it. It was here the farmers round brought\r\ntheir produce, ready to sell their wool for good sound money, or to\r\nexchange it for commodities of which they stood in need. It was here the\r\nforeign trader came to purchase sheep-fells and other skins, soon, by\r\ntransmission abroad, to be worked up by Flemish hands into good\r\nbroadcloth, and retransmitted again to London or provincial marts.\r\nEdward the Confessor obtained a sum of 70_l._, an immense amount at such\r\na time as this, from the tollage at a fair held in Bedfordshire. Of many\r\ncelebrated fairs, those of Smithfield on St. Bartholomew’s Day (which\r\nstill exists as a kind of perpetual one), York, Winchester, and Ely seem\r\nto have been the most frequented. That in the Isle of Ely was kept up on\r\nand for some days after the feast of St. Awdrey, or Audrey, the\r\ncorrupted name of St. Etheldreda, which as a surname our ‘Awdreys’ still\r\npreserve. This seems to have become specially noted for its sale of\r\ntrinkets, toys, and cheap and gay laces—so much so that in course of\r\ntime ‘tawdry,’ or St.-Awdry, ware became the colloquial and general term\r\nfor such. Drayton we even find using the word substantively when he\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n                Of which the Naiads and blue Nereids make\r\n                Them tawdries for their neck.[301]\r\n\r\nOf the still greater one held at Winchester, we find Piers the Plowman\r\nspeaking:—\r\n\r\n                      To Wye and to Winchester\r\n                        I went to the fair,\r\n                      With many manner merchandise,\r\n                        As my master me hight:\r\n                      But it had been unsold\r\n                        These seven years,\r\n                      So God me help,\r\n                        Had there not gone\r\n                      The grace of guile\r\n                        Among my chaffer.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Wife of Bath,’ too, has a word to say upon this subject. Says she:—\r\n\r\n               I governed them so wel after my lawe,\r\n               That eche of them ful blissful was and fawe\r\n               To bringen me gay thinges fro the feyre.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture does all this present to our eye. We can see the circular\r\nstand of booths belting the rails of the quaint belfried edifice,\r\nsometimes, I am afraid, the sacred precincts within.[302] Behind these\r\nwe may note how busy are our ‘le Stallers’ and ‘le Stallmans,’ now found\r\nalso as ‘Stalman;’ not to say our ‘Stallards,’ that is, stall-wards, and\r\nobsolete ‘le Vendours.’ No infliction too severe can be made upon their\r\nreadiness to please. Elbowing and chaffering and good-humoured haggling\r\nare the order of the day. Here the stupid, happy swain, with his\r\nbe-ribboned sweetheart tucked under his arm, is buying their little\r\nstock wherewith to start life; here the child is made blissful with a\r\ntrumpet, and the hoary-headed rustic gets a warmer cap for his crown.\r\nHere, too, it is that the chapman and other of his _confrères_, as I\r\nhave already hinted, are buying in their varied commodities. All alike\r\nare well catered for. When we talk of ‘packing up our duds,’ few of us,\r\nI imagine, are aware that we are using a word of most familiar import in\r\nlong generations gone by. A ‘dud’ then was a coarse, patched linen gown,\r\ngaudy in colour, made up in fact of variegated pieces of this material.\r\nHence he who sold such cheap, flashy goods at a fair, any old fripperer\r\nin truth, was styled a ‘dudder’ up to comparatively recent times, and\r\nthe booth itself a ‘duddery.’ ‘Duderman’ and ‘Dudder’ (now obsolete),\r\n‘Dudman’ and ‘Dodman,’ are all, I doubt not, but interesting memorials\r\nof this once flourishing lower class trade. Such names as ‘Thomas\r\nDudman’ or ‘Ralph Deuderman’ greet us occasionally in the olden rolls.\r\n‘William Fairman,’[303] found in the Parliamentary Writs, would be, I\r\nsuppose, a more general vendor. He has not a few descendants.\r\n\r\nBut while bartering and the purchase and sale of these varied household\r\ncommodities occupied no small amount of attention, such a sober mode of\r\npassing the fairtide was very far from being the intention of the\r\nyounger and gayer portion of the assemblage; nor was there, indeed, any\r\nlack of that which could feed or give zest to their relish for\r\namusement, though it was not always of the most innocent nature. Our\r\n‘Champions’ and ‘Campions’ are but relics of the old ‘William le\r\nChampion,’[304] or ‘Katerine le Chaumpion,’ a sobriquet which would\r\neasily affix itself to some sturdy and swarthy rustic who had thrown his\r\nadversary in the wrestling ground. This has ever been a popular sport\r\namid our more rural communities. The Miller, Chaucer says:—\r\n\r\n              Was a stout carl for the nones,\r\n              Ful bigge he was of braun, and eke of bones,\r\n              That proved wel, for over all ther he came,\r\n              At wrestling he would bear away the ram.\r\n\r\nIn an old poem I have already quoted, the mother warns her daughter:—\r\n\r\n             Go not to the wrestling, nor shooting the cock,\r\n             As it were a strumpet or a giglot.[305]\r\n\r\nDoubtless such a sobriquet as ‘Richard le Fytur,’ that is ‘Fighter,’\r\nwould be but representative of the same. The country folks were not\r\nslow, too, to copy their masters, and in the friendly joust the former,\r\n‘Thomas le Justere’ or ‘Robert le Justure,’ would brace himself amid the\r\nexcited ring to unseat his fellow-swain, affording much sport to the\r\non-looking wags.\r\n\r\nBy the maypole you may see the conjuror, or ‘Wiseman,’ as he was\r\ngenerally termed, battening himself upon the superstitious minds of the\r\nassembled hinds. In the Hundred Rolls he figures as ‘Wysman’ and\r\n‘Wyseman.’ A little further on our ‘Players’ would be enacting their\r\nmummery. The great crowd there in the corner are watching the showman\r\nwith his dancing bear, a yearly treat the younger holiday-seekers always\r\nappreciated. What a change has come over our English habits with regard\r\nto this animal. Dancing was the least cruel of the sports connected with\r\nit. Time was when every noble of position had his bears and his\r\nbearward, when even royalty could boast a master of the king’s bears,\r\nand when as a pastime the bear-baiting took an easy pre-eminence in the\r\neyes of all holiday folk. A skit on the Earl of Warwick, banished to the\r\nIsle of Man, written 1399, says:—\r\n\r\n                  A bereward found a rag:\r\n                    Of this rag he made a bag:\r\n                    He dude in gode entent.\r\n                  Thorwe the bag the bereward is taken;\r\n                  All his beres have hym forsaken.\r\n                    Thus is the berewarde schent.[306]\r\n\r\nIn one of our earlier rolls I find several names that bear relation to\r\nthis familiar sport. Of such are ‘Geoffrey Bearbaste’ and ‘Alexander\r\nBearbait.’ More common to us in the present day, however, are the\r\ndescendants of the more simple ‘Berward’ (‘Michael le Berward,’ H.R.)\r\nand ‘Bearman,’ or ‘Berman’ (‘Ralph Bareman,’ H.R.). In ‘Cocke Lorelle’s\r\nBote’ mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                      Jenkyne Berwarde of Barwyche.\r\n\r\nWhether ‘Jenkyne’ was a mythic personage, or whether any of our present\r\n‘Berwards’ are his lineal issue, I cannot pretend to say.[307] Any way,\r\nhowever, the name would be common enough then. Bull as well as bear\r\nbaiting, I need not say, was a popular pastime with our forefathers. We\r\nstill talk of bulldogs. Probably our ‘Bullards’ could formerly have told\r\nus something about this. Fit rival to these latter, you may see the\r\n‘Cockman,’ or, as he was more generally termed, the ‘Cocker,’ matching\r\nhis birds in the adjacent pit. The author of the ‘Townley Mysteries’\r\ndoes not give the cocker a good character—at least he places him in very\r\nbad company—\r\n\r\n                    These dysars, and these hullars,\r\n                    These cokkers, and these bullars,\r\n                    And alle purse cuttars,\r\n                      Be welle ware of these men.\r\n\r\nAmong other instances the Hundred Rolls furnish us with ‘Simon le\r\nCockere’ and ‘William le Koker.’\r\n\r\nProfessional dancers, I need scarcely say, were seldom absent from the\r\nmediæval festival. Tripping it lightly to some Moorish round, we may see\r\nsuch folk as ‘Harvey le Danser’ or ‘Geoffrey le Hoppere,’ inciting the\r\nyounger villagers to follow their example. The latter name, which occurs\r\nfrequently at this time, reminds us that our modern slang term ‘hop’ has\r\nbut restored the ancient use of this word. Our Prayer-Book version of\r\nthe Psalms still employs the verb in the verse, ‘Why hop ye so, ye high\r\nhills?’[308]—and Chaucer, in picturing the merry ’prentice, says—\r\n\r\n                At every bridale would he sing and hoppe;\r\n                He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.\r\n\r\nThe feminine ‘hoppestere,’ which he also uses, does not sound quite so\r\neuphonious. In the ‘Pardoner’s Tale,’ among other of the dissolute folk\r\nin Flanders, are mentioned ‘tombesteres’—\r\n\r\n                And right anon in comen tombesteres\r\n                Fetis and smale, and yonge fruitesteres.\r\n\r\nThese, I doubt not, were female dancers, and performers of such bodily\r\ngyrations and flexions as mountebanks are still skilled in. The\r\nmasculine form is found in such an entry as ‘William le Tumbere,’ whom\r\nwe should now, so far as his professional tricks were concerned, term a\r\ntumbler.\r\n\r\nAll this time the mirth of music is at its loudest, though it is\r\nsomewhat hard to separate the tones of the various rival minstrels.\r\nThere is a trio in one corner by the tavern door there, discoursing\r\nsounds which are certainly equal, if not superior, to the Teutonic bands\r\nof more modern days. Indeed, with regard to the latter, I am beginning\r\nto suspect the conjecture of a friend of mine to be perfectly true—that\r\nthey are German convicts shipped off, with cracked and second-hand\r\ntrumpets, by the Commissioners of Police to save their keep. It is,\r\nhowever, right perhaps that the country which sends us the best should\r\nalso have the option of sending us the worst music in the world. The\r\ntrio we may see here, at any rate, have one advantage—that of their\r\npoetic mediæval costume. The first we may notice is the ‘Fiddler,’\r\nrepresented by such men as ‘Robert Fyffudlere,’ or ‘John le Fythelere,’\r\nor the Latinized ‘Rulard Vidulator.’ This last reminds us that it is now\r\nalso written ‘Vidler.’ He of course played on the violin, for I must not\r\nsay ‘fiddle,’ it is far too Saxon, for modern cultivated days. The Clerk\r\nof Oxenforde seems to have been superior to the generality of later\r\nuniversity men, for he had—\r\n\r\n                Liefer have at his beddes head\r\n                A twenty bokes, clothed in black or red,\r\n                Of Aristotle and his philosophie,\r\n                Than robes riche, or fidel, or sautrie.\r\n\r\nCertainly time effects wonderful changes. But I doubt whether even he\r\nwould have found much profit, not to say pleasure, in the study of\r\nAristotle, or any other philosopher, had he been subjected to the daily\r\npractice of a well-scraped viol in an adjacent dormitory,[309] the\r\nauthor of which could boast but one tune in his repertoire, and was\r\ndetermined that every one should know it. After the Fiddler—Saxon or no\r\nSaxon, I’ll stick to it for the nonce—comes the ‘Piper’ with his reedy\r\nstop, and next to him the ‘Taborer’ beating his drum with such rare\r\neffect as to make him the very idol of the youngsters. Spenser calls him\r\nthe ‘tabrere,’ which form, as well as ‘Tabrar,’ Tabberer,’ ‘Tabor,’ and\r\n‘Taber,’ still exists in our nomenclature.\r\n\r\n                   I saw a shole of shepherds out go,\r\n                   Before them yode a lusty tabrere,\r\n                   That to the merry hornpipe plaid,\r\n                   Whereto they danced.\r\n\r\nSuch entries as ‘Arnold le Pyper,’ or ‘Robert le Pipere,’ or ‘William le\r\nTabourer,’ or ‘John le Taburer,’ are of frequent occurrence in mediæval\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\n              The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling crowd,\r\n\r\nis the order of the gentle author of the ‘Faerie Queen;’ so having\r\ndisposed of the two former, the ‘Crowder’ with his six-stringed viol\r\nduly engages our attention next, though he ought more correctly to have\r\nbeen yoked with the ‘Fiddler.’ ‘Crouth’ was but another form of the same\r\nword. An old Saxon Psalter thus renders Psalm cl. 4—\r\n\r\n                    Loves him in crouth and timpane,\r\n                    Loves him in stringes and organe.\r\n\r\nWicklyffe, too, translates Luke xv. 25 as follows:—‘But his eldre sone\r\nwas in the feeld, and whaune he cam and neighede to the hous he herde a\r\nsymfonye and a crowde.’[310] Like our ‘Harpers’ and more northern\r\n‘Bairds,’ the ‘Crowder’ or ‘Crowther’ (for as surnames both forms exist)\r\nwas oftentimes blind, and thus gained the ear of an audience, if not\r\nappreciative, at least sympathetic. Seldom, indeed, did he leave\r\ncottage, or hall festival, or fair, without a guerdon, and a kind word\r\nto boot; for while customs fade out and die, pity, thank God, knows\r\nneither change of season nor chance of time. Mediæval forms of the above\r\nmay be found in ‘Richard le Cruder’ or ‘Thomas le Crowder.’ But we have\r\nyet several more surnames to mention which prove the once great\r\npopularity of this latter class of instrument. ‘German le Lutrere’ and\r\n‘John le Leuter’ have left no descendants, I think.[311] The more common\r\nterm was lutanist, but of this I have found no instance. While the lute\r\nhad generally ten strings, and was struck by the hand, the viele or viol\r\nhad six, was of stronger make, and was played with a bow. It seems to\r\nhave been a favourite instrument in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, for such registrations as ‘Benedict le Viler,’ ‘Nicholas le\r\nVylour,’ ‘Wyot le Vilur,’ or ‘Jacob le Vielur,’ occur with tolerable\r\nfrequency at that period. Another Norman-introduced word was that of\r\n‘gigue,’ or ‘gig.’ This, however, seems to have differed from the others\r\nin being of the very roughest manufacture, and made specially for\r\nprofessional dancers. These ‘giguers’ were extremely popular at rural\r\nfestivals of any kind. At one and the same instant they would be\r\ntripping it round on the ‘light fantastic toe,’ singing some not too\r\nselect verses, accompanying themselves on their sturdy instrument, and\r\nyet would have a hand to spare for a trifle if you should offer it. If\r\nyou doubted it you had but to try them. It is thus we have got our\r\n‘jig,’ our ‘gigot,’ or leg of mutton, too, being so called from its\r\nresemblance thereto. The surnominal form is found in such entries as\r\n‘Walter le Gigur,’ or ‘Alexander le Gygur,’ but I doubt whether either\r\nis represented now. The last of this class of instrumentalists we may\r\nmention is ‘William le Sautreour,’ he who struck the ‘gay sawtrye,’ as\r\nChaucer terms it. The more correct form of the word was ‘psaltery.’ It\r\nwas specially used as an accompaniment for the voice, hence it is freely\r\nused in this sense in the Authorized Version. I do not doubt myself that\r\nsome of our ‘Salters’ are but a change rung on the mediæval ‘Sawtrer.’\r\nThe ‘Fluter,’ I believe, has left no descendants, but in ‘Nicholas le\r\nFloutere’ he was to be met with at this date, and, I need not say, would\r\nbe as familiar as he would be acceptable on such an occasion as this.\r\nThe lusty young Squire was so musical that—\r\n\r\n                Singing he was, or floyting alle the day,\r\n                He was as freshe as is the month of May.\r\n\r\nThere is one name I must mention here, that of ‘Peter le Organer,’[312]\r\nperhaps connected with ‘Orger’ of the same date. The owner of this more\r\nmodern-looking term may either have been organist at some monastery or\r\nabbey-church, or he may have played upon the portable regal, in which\r\nlatter case he too might possibly have been seen here. But ‘organ’ was a\r\nvery general term. In the old psalters it seems to have been used for\r\nnearly every species of instrument. We should scarcely speak now of\r\n‘hanging up our “organs” upon the willows,’ but so an old version of the\r\nPsalms has it. Did we not know they were a modern invention we might\r\nhave been inclined to suspect ‘le Organer’ to have been but a strolling\r\nperformer upon the ‘hurdy-gurdy.’ That, however, was an infliction\r\nmercifully spared to our forefathers. In concluding this brief survey of\r\nmediæval music, I cannot, I think, do better than quote, as I have done\r\npartially once before, Robert de Brunne’s account of the coronation of\r\nKing Arthur, wherein we shall find many, if not most, of the\r\nprofessional characters I have been mentioning familiarly spoken of. He\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n           Jogelours weren there enow\r\n           That their quaintise forthe drew:\r\n           Minstrels many with divers glew (glee)\r\n           Sounds of bemes (trumps) that men blew,\r\n           Harpes, pipes, and tabours,\r\n           Fithols (fiddles), citolles (cymbals), sautreours,\r\n           Belles, chimès and synfan\r\n           Other enow and some I cannot name.\r\n           Songsters that merry sung,\r\n           Sound of glee over all rung;\r\n           Disours enow telled fables:\r\n           And some played with dice at tables.\r\n\r\nBut we are not without traces of the troubadour. The simple vocalist, a\r\nstrolling professionalist, too, in many instances, remains hale and\r\nhearty in our ‘Glemans,’ ‘Gleemans,’ and ‘Glemmans,’ not to mention our\r\n‘Sangsters.’ Amid such lulls as might intervene, we should hear them at\r\nthe popular festivals bidding for favour with their old-fashioned\r\nstories of ‘hawk and hound,’ and ‘my ladyes bower,’ set, no doubt, to\r\nairs equally _à la mode_. A contemporary poet tells us their song\r\n\r\n                      Hath been sung at festivals\r\n                      On ember eves, and holy-ales.\r\n\r\nThe recitation of these stories seems to have been a peculiarly popular\r\nprofession. Our ‘Rhymers’ oftentimes showed their skill in the art of\r\nrhythmical narration by weaving the exploits they described into\r\nextempore verse.[313] The ‘Juggler’ or ‘Joculator,’ originally a\r\nminstrel or ‘jester,’ something akin to the clown of later days, became\r\nby-and-by more celebrated for his skill in legerdemain than loquacity,\r\nand now little else is understood by the word. Almost every baron, and\r\neven the king himself, had his favourite jester; but it was an art put\r\nto the most corrupt purposes, and ‘Jagge the Jogelour’ is set in very\r\nlow company by Piers Plowman. Certainly his jokes were of the lewdest\r\ndescription, even for the rough times in which he lived. His voice, too,\r\nwas sufficiently elevated, if we may trust the account given in the\r\n‘Romance of Alexander,’ for—\r\n\r\n                 No scholde mon have herd the thondur,\r\n                 For the noise of the taboures,\r\n                 And the trumpours, and the jangelours.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Dissour,’ the old Norman ‘diseur,’ similar in character to the\r\nrhymer and the juggler, seems to have left no memorial, saving it be in\r\nour ‘Dissers;’[314] neither can I trace ‘le Tregetour’ later than the\r\nfifteenth century. Every footprint of his professional existence,\r\nindeed, is now faded from our view. And yet there was the day when none\r\ncould be more familiar than he. The Hundred Rolls record not merely\r\n‘Symon le Tregetor,’ but ‘William le Tregetur’ also, while ‘Maister John\r\nRykele’ is spoken of by Lydgate as ‘sometime Tregitour of noble Henrie,\r\nKing of Engleland.’ Chaucer, too, mentions sciences\r\n\r\n                 By which men maken divers apparences,\r\n                 Such as these subtil tregetoures play.\r\n                 For oft at feasts have I wel heard say\r\n                 That tragetoures, within an halle large\r\n                 Have made come in a water and a barge\r\n                 And in the halle rowen up and down:\r\n\r\nwhile in another place he speaks of seeing\r\n\r\n                                Coll Tragetour\r\n                     Upon a table of sicamour\r\n                     Play an uncouth thing to tell;\r\n                     I saw him carry a wind-mill\r\n                     Under a walnut-shell;\r\n\r\nwith other equally marvellous feats. Thus we see that the art of\r\nlegerdemain was not neglected at this time.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether any relics we possess so completely convey to our minds\r\nthe radical changes which have swept across the face of our English\r\nCommonwealth as do these lingering surnames. They remind us of the\r\ninvention of printing, of the spread of literature, and of the slow\r\ndecay thereby of the professions they represented. They tell us of a\r\nchanged society, they tell us of a day of rougher cast and looser\r\ntrammels; they tell us of a life around which the lapse of intervening\r\nyears has thrown a halo of so quaint aspect that we all but long, in our\r\nmore sentimental moods, to be thrown back upon it again. Placing these\r\ntell-tale names by the life of the present, we see what a change has\r\npassed over all. Let us hope this change denotes progress. In some\r\nrespects it assuredly does: progress in the settlement of our common\r\nrights and duties, progress in civilization and order, progress in\r\nmental culture, progress in decorum. Still we may yet ask, with all this\r\nhas there been any true progress? The juggler, ’tis true, with his\r\nlicentious story, and the dissolute tragetour, both are gone—they would\r\nbe handcuffed now, and put in gaol. This speaks something for a higher\r\ncultivation. But, after all, may not this be a mere outside refinement—a\r\nrefinement to meet the requirements of an age in which the head is\r\neducated more than the heart—a refinement which may be had in our\r\nshops—the refinement, in fact, of the lowest of God’s endowed creatures,\r\nthat of the exquisite? This is, indeed, an artificial age, and it warns\r\nus to see to it whether we are hypocrites or no; whether our life is\r\nentirely external or the reverse; whether it is all shell and no kernel,\r\nall the outside cup and platter, and within naught save extortion and\r\nexcess. That mortal shall have attained the highest wisdom who, in the\r\nlight of the world to come, shall have seen to the cleansing of that\r\nwhich is within, and if that, if the heart be cleansed, then the\r\nexternal life will as naturally, as it will of necessity, be pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                    SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION. (TOWN).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already said enough to show that our early English pursuits were\r\nmainly pastoral. Even to this day, as we are whisked across the midland\r\ncounties or driven across the Yorkshire wolds, we see what advantages we\r\nmust have enjoyed in this respect. Our one chief staple was wool, and to\r\nexport this in a raw unmanufactured state was the early practice. So\r\ngeneral was this occupation that even subsidies to the crown were given\r\nin wool. In 1340, 30,000 sacks of wool were granted to Edward III. while\r\nengaged in the French War. This would be a most valuable contribution,\r\nfor at this time it was held in the highest repute by foreign buyers.\r\n‘The ribs of all nations throughout the world,’ wrote Matthew Paris,\r\n‘are kept warm by the fleeces of English wool’ (Smiles). So early as\r\n1056 we find the Count of Cleves obtaining a certain jurisdiction over\r\nthe burghers of Nimeguen upon condition of presenting to the Emperor\r\nevery year ‘three pieces of scarlet cloth of English wool’ (Macullum).\r\nWith the incoming of the Flemish refugees and other settlers already\r\nmentioned this state of things was changed. The Conqueror himself had\r\nsettled one band near Carlisle, but his son Henry soon after coming into\r\npossession removed them into Herefordshire, and the Southern Marches of\r\nthe Principality. Doubtless the object of both was that of setting up a\r\nbarrier against hostile encroachments on the part of the Scotch and\r\nWelsh; but the result was the spread of a peaceful and useful industry\r\nin two widely separated districts. Two other settlements, in Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk, one by Henry I., the other under the direction of Edward III.,\r\nmade East Anglia for centuries the Yorkshire of England. When we talk so\r\nfamiliarly of ‘worsted,’ or ‘lindsey-wolsey,’ or ‘kerseymere,’ or\r\n‘bocking,’ we are but insensibly upholding a reputation which centuries\r\nago the several villages that went by these names had obtained through\r\nFlemish aid. Thus was it then that at length our country was enabled to\r\nproduce a cloth which could afford a comparison with that of the Flemish\r\ncities themselves. Of this incoming many surnames of this date remind\r\nus, the most important of which I have already mentioned in my chapter\r\nupon local names, ‘Fleming,’ as a general name for all these settlers,\r\nbeing the commonest.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we turn to the occupations themselves connected with the\r\nindustry, we cannot but be struck by the wonderful impress it has made\r\nupon our nomenclature. The child’s ancient rhyme—\r\n\r\n                        Black sheep, black sheep,\r\n                          Have you any wool?\r\n                        Yes, sir; yes, sir;\r\n                          Three bags full—\r\n\r\ncarries us to the first stage, and to the first dealer. In our ‘Woolers’\r\nand ‘Woolmans,’ in our obsolete ‘Woolmongers’ and ‘Woolbuyers,’[315] in\r\nour ‘Packers’[316] and once flourishing ‘Woolpackers,’ and in our\r\n‘Lanyers’ and ‘Laners,’ relics of the old and more Norman ‘Bartholomew\r\nle Laner’ or ‘John le Lanier,’ we can see once more the train of laden\r\nmules bearing their fleecy treasure to the larger towns or distant\r\ncoast. No wonder that Piers Plowman and others should make familiar\r\nmention of the ‘pack-needle,’ when we reflect upon the enormous number\r\nof sacks that would be in constant use for this purpose; and no wonder\r\n‘Adam le Sakkere’ (_i.e._ ‘Sacker’), and ‘Henry le Canevaser’ are to be\r\nmet with as busied in their provision.[317] Another proof of the\r\nengrossing importance of this one English article of commerce is left us\r\nin our ‘Staplers.’ The ‘stapleware’ of a town was, and is still, that\r\nwhich is the chief commodity dealt in by that particular market. A\r\n‘stapler,’ however, has for centuries been a generally accepted title\r\nfor a woolmerchant, and has therefore absorbed the more general meaning\r\nthe word ought to have conveyed.\r\n\r\nThe first stage towards manufacture would be the process of carding the\r\nraw and tangled material, and numberless are the ‘Carders,’ ‘Combers,’\r\nand ‘Kempsters,’[318] or ‘Kemsters,’ who remind us of this. In these\r\nlatter sobriquets we have but varied forms of the same root ‘cemb,’ to\r\ncomb. We still talk poetically of ‘unkempt locks,’ and we are told of\r\nEmelie in the ‘Knight’s Tale’ that—\r\n\r\n               Her bright hair kembed was, untressed all.\r\n\r\nThe Norman corresponding name is found in ‘Robert le Peinnur’ or\r\n‘William le Puigneur,’ but unless in our ‘Pinners’ (a supposition not\r\nunnatural) it has left no descendants. But even these are not all. It is\r\nwith them we must associate our ‘Towzers’ and ‘Tozers,’ from the old\r\n‘touse’ allied to ‘tease’—they who cleared the fibre from all\r\nentanglements. Spenser talks of curs ‘tousing’ the poor bear at the\r\nbaiting, and I need not remind the reader that in our somewhat limited\r\ncanine nomenclature, ‘Towzer,’ as a name for a dog of more pugnacious\r\npropensities, occupies a by no means mean place. As applicable to the\r\ntrade in question, Gower uses the word when he says, in his ‘Confessio\r\nAmantis’:—\r\n\r\n                What schepe that is full of wulle\r\n                Upon his backe they tose and pulle.[319]\r\n\r\nIt is here, therefore, we must place our one or two solitary\r\nrelics of the rough machinery then in use. In ‘Cardmaker’ we have\r\nthe manufacturer of the ‘comb’ or ‘card’ thus usefully employed;\r\nin ‘Spindler’ the maker of the pin round which the thread was\r\nwound; while our ‘Slaymakers,’[320] ‘Slaymans,’ and obsolete\r\n‘Slaywrights’[321] preserve the once so familiar ‘slay’—that\r\nmoveable part of the loom which the webbe with his fingers plied\r\nnimbly and deftly along the threads. A petition to Parliament in\r\n1467 from the worsted manufacturers complains that in the county\r\nof Norfolk there are ‘divers persones that make untrue ware of all\r\nmanner of worstedes, not being of the assises in length nor brede,\r\nnor of good, true stuffe and makyng, and the _slayes_ and yern\r\nthereto belonging untruly made and wrought, etc.’ (Rot. Parl. Ed.\r\nIV.) I believe the word is not yet obsolete as a term of the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned ‘Webbe.’\r\n\r\n                         My wife was a webbe\r\n                         And woolen cloth made,\r\n\r\nsays Piers in his ‘Vision.’ This appears, judging at least from our\r\ndirectories, to have been the more general term, and after it its longer\r\nforms, the masculine ‘Webber’ and the originally feminine ‘Webster.’ A\r\npoem written in the beginning of the sixteenth century refers to\r\n\r\n                  Curriers, cordwayners, and cobelers,\r\n                  Gyrdelers, forborers, and webbers.\r\n\r\nSuch entries as ‘Elyas le Webbe,’ or ‘Clarice le Webbere,’ or ‘John le\r\nWebestre,’ are of common occurrence in our mediæval and still earlier\r\nrecords. But the processes are anything but at an end. The cloth must be\r\ndyed and fulled. Of the first our ‘Listers,’ once enrolled as ‘Hugh le\r\nLitster’ or ‘Henry le Littester,’[322] speak, and ‘Dyer’ or ‘Dister,’\r\nstill harder of recognition in such a guise as ‘Geoffrey le Deghere’ or\r\n‘Robert le Dighestere,’ forms found at the period we are writing about.\r\nIt was John Littester, a dyer, who in 1381 headed the rebellion in\r\nNorwich. Here the surname was evidently taken from the occupation\r\nfollowed. Halliwell gives the obsolete verb ‘to lit’ or dye, and quotes\r\nan old manuscript in which the following sentence occurs: ‘We use na\r\nclathis that are littede of dyverse coloures.’ Such names as ‘Gilbert le\r\nTeinturer,’ or ‘Richard le Teynterer,’ or ‘Philip le Tentier,’ which I\r\nhave come across in three separate records, represent the old French\r\ntitle for the same occupation, but I believe they have failed to come\r\ndown to us—at least I have not met with any after instance. The old\r\nEnglish forms of ‘tincture’ and ‘tint’ are generally found to be\r\n‘teinture’ and ‘teint.’ The teinturer is not without relics. We still\r\nspeak when harassed of ‘being on the _stretch_,’ or when in a state of\r\nsuspense of ‘being upon _tenter_-hooks,’ both of which proverbial\r\nexpressions must have arisen in the common converse of cloth-workers.\r\nThe tenter itself was the stretcher upon which the cloth was laid while\r\nin the dyer’s hands. On account of various deceits that had become\r\nnotorious in the craft, such, for instance, as the over-stretching of\r\nthe material, a law was passed in the first year of Richard III. that\r\n‘tentering’ or ‘teyntering’ should only be done in an open place, and\r\nfor this purpose public tenters were to be set up. (‘Stat. Realm,’ Rich.\r\nIII.) We find many references to this important instrument in old\r\ntestaments. Thus an inventory of goods, dated 1562, belonging to a man\r\nresident in the parish of Kendall, speaks of ‘Tenture posts and woodde,\r\n6_d._—ii tentures 20_s._’ (‘Richmondshire Wills,’ p. 156.) The dyes\r\nthemselves used in the process of colouring are not without existing\r\nmemorials. In the York Pageant, already referred to, we find, walking in\r\nprocession with the woolpackers, the ‘Wadmen,’ that is, the sellers of\r\nwoad, unless indeed, they were the dyers themselves. The more common\r\nspelling was ‘wode,’ and when not local, ‘Thomas le Wodere’ or ‘Alan le\r\nWodeman,’ with their modern ‘Wooder’ and ‘Woodman,’ will be found, I\r\ndoubt not, to be the representative of this calling. ‘John Maderman,’\r\nand ‘Lawrence Maderer’ remind us of the more reddish and popular hues.\r\nGreat quantities of this were yearly imported from Holland, especially\r\nMiddleburgh. The old ‘Libel on English Policy’ speaks of—\r\n\r\n                  The marchaundy of Braban and Selande,\r\n\r\nas being\r\n\r\n          The madre and woode (woad) that dyers take on hande.\r\n\r\nThe thickening mill, however, has left us several words of much more\r\nfamiliar import than these—viz., ‘Tucker,’ ‘Fuller,’ (or ‘Fulman’[323])\r\nand ‘Walker.’[324] Among other older forms we find ‘Roger le Tukere,’\r\n‘Percival le Toukare,’ ‘Walter le Fullere,’ ‘Ralph le Walkere,’ and\r\n‘Peter le Walkar.’ Of the first Piers in his ‘Vision’ makes mention,\r\nwhere he speaks of\r\n\r\n                          Wollene websteris,\r\n                          And weveris of lynen,\r\n                          Taillours, tanneris,\r\n                          And Tokkeris bothe.\r\n\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’ also refers to—\r\n\r\n                    Multiplyers and clothe thyckers,\r\n                    Called fullers everychone.\r\n\r\n‘Walker,’ claiming as it does an almost unrivalled position in the rolls\r\nof our nomenclature, reminds us of the early fashion of treading out the\r\ncloth before the adaptations of machinery were brought to bear on this\r\nphase of the craft. In Wicklyffe’s version of the story of Christ’s\r\ntransfiguration he speaks of his clothes shining so as no ‘fullere or\r\nwalkere of cloth’ may make white upon earth.[325] Reference is made to\r\nthe same practice by Langland also when, using this whole process of\r\ncloth-making as an illustration, he says:—\r\n\r\n                    Cloth that cometh fro the wevyng\r\n                    Is nought comely to wear\r\n                    Til it be fulled _under foot_,\r\n                    Or in fullying stokkes,\r\n                    Washen wel with water,\r\n                    And with taseles cracched\r\n                    Y-touked, and y-teynted,\r\n                    And under taillours hande.\r\n\r\nWe are here not merely furnished with the entire process itself, but the\r\nterms themselves employed harmonize well with the names I have\r\nmentioned. ‘Walker’ and ‘Tucker’ or ‘Towkare’ or ‘Toker,’ as it was\r\nvariously spelt, together with ‘Tuckerman,’ have, however, disappeared\r\nas terms of this trade; and it is in our directories alone we can find\r\nthem declaring these forgotten mysteries of a more uncouth manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe ‘taseles’ mentioned in the poem quoted above were the common\r\n‘teasel’ or ‘tassel,’ a rough prickly plant allied to the thistle, which\r\nwhen dried was used for scratching the cloth, and thus raising a nap\r\nthereupon. Thus in Willsford’s ‘Nature’s Secrets’ it is said, ‘Tezils,\r\nor Fuller’s Thistle, being gathered or hanged up in the house, where the\r\nair may come freely to it, upon the alteration of cold and windy weather\r\nwill grow smoother, and against rain will close up his prickles.’\r\n(Brand’s ‘Pop. Ant.,’ vol. iii. p. 133.) In an inventory of the property\r\nof Edward Kyrkelands, of Kendall, dated 1578, we find the following\r\narticles mentioned:—iiii syckles, a pair wyes and iii stafs, tazills,\r\n5_s._ 8_d._—more in tazills, 2_s._—iiii tentors, 40_s._ (‘Richmondshire\r\nWills,’ p. 274.) The occupation itself is referred to in an old statute\r\nof Edward IV.—‘Item, that every fuller, from the said feast of St.\r\nPeter, in his craft and occupation of fuller, rower, or _tayseler_ of\r\ncloth, shall exercise and use _taysels_ and no cards, deceitfully\r\nimpairing the same cloth’—‘en sa arte et occupacion de fuller et\r\nscalpier ou tezeiler de drap, exercise et use teizels, &c.’ (4 Ed. IV.\r\nc. 1.) It is probable that our ‘Taylors’ have engrossed this name. We\r\nfind it lingering in Westmoreland, about Kendal, till the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century, in a form which required but little further change to\r\nmake it the same. In the will of Walter Strykland, dated 1568, there is\r\nmentioned among other legatees a certain ‘Edward Taylzer,’ a manifest\r\ncorruption of ‘Teazeler.’ (‘Richmondshire Wills,’ p. 224.) A century\r\nearlier than this, however, such names as ‘Gilbert le Tasseler’ or\r\n‘Matilda le Tasselere’ were entered in our more formal registers.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Baters’ and ‘Beaters,’ relics of the old ‘Avery le Batour’ or ‘John\r\nBetere,’ were all but invariably cloth-beaters, although, like the\r\nfuller ‘wollebeter,’[326] they may have been busied at an earlier stage\r\nof the manufacture. Capgrave, in his ‘Chronicles,’ under date 30 A.D.,\r\nsays, ‘Jacobus, the son of Joseph first bishop of Jerusalem, was throwe\r\nthere fro the pinacle of the temple and after smet with a fuller’s\r\nbat.’[327] With the mention of our ‘Shearers’ (‘Richard le Sherere,’ M.)\r\nand endless ‘Shearmans,’ ‘Sharmans,’ or ‘Shermans’ (‘Robert le Sherman,’\r\n‘John le Shereman,’ M.), who represent the shearing of the manufactured\r\nfabric, rather than that of the sheep itself, we have the process\r\ncomplete. The cloth is at length ready to be transmitted into the care\r\nof our ‘Drapers’ and ‘Clothiers,’ and from them again through the\r\nskilled and nimble fingers of our numberless ‘Tailors.’ From all this we\r\nmay readily see what an important influence has England’s one great\r\nstaple of earlier days had upon the nomenclature of our countrymen.\r\n\r\nSuch a name as ‘Ralph le Flexman,’ with its many descendants, reminds us\r\nof the manufacture of linen, which, if not so popular as that of wool,\r\nwas nevertheless anything but unfamiliar to the early craftsman. Our\r\n‘Spinners’ carry us to the primary task of thread-making, an employment,\r\nhowever, all but entirely in the hands of the women. The distaff and the\r\nweaker sex have been ever associated, whether in sacred or profane\r\nnarrative. Thus it is that ‘spinster’ has become stereotyped even as a\r\nlegal term. Chaucer, four hundred years ago, somewhat uncourteously\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n               Deceite, weping, spinning, God hath given\r\n               To women kindly, while that they may liven.\r\n\r\nOur modern ‘linen’ is formed from ‘lin’ or ‘line’—flax—as ‘woolen’ is\r\nfrom ‘wool.’ Hence we still speak of the seed of that plant as\r\n‘linseed.’ That this was the common form of the word we might prove by\r\nmany quotations.\r\n\r\n                      He drank never cidre nor wyn\r\n                      Nor never wered cloth of lyn,\r\n\r\nsays an old poem. Even Spenser speaks of ‘garment of line,’ and in\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote’ allusion is made to ‘lyne-webbers’ and\r\n‘lyne-drapers.’[328] We need not be surprised, therefore, to meet with\r\nsuch names as ‘Elias Lyndraper,’ or ‘Henry le Lindraper,’ or ‘John le\r\nLyner.’ Only this last, however, has survived the changes of intervening\r\ncenturies, and still holds a precarious existence as ‘Liner.’ ‘Weaver’\r\nwas more common. A more Norman equivalent is found in such a sobriquet\r\nas ‘John le Teler,’ or ‘Henry le Telere,’ or ‘Ida la Teleress,’ a name\r\nwhich is not necessarily of modern French refugee origin, as Mr. Lower\r\nwould lead us to suppose. Indeed, a special part of the ladies’\r\nhead-dress had early obtained the name of a ‘teler,’ from the fine\r\ntexture of the linen of which it was composed.[329] It is but too\r\nprobable that this name has become lost, like ‘Taylzer,’ in the more\r\ncommon ‘Taylor.’ This process of absorption we shall find to be not\r\nunfrequent. Nor are we without a memorial of the bleaching of linen.\r\n‘Whiter,’ if not ‘Whitster,’ still lives in our directories. It seems\r\nstrange that our ‘Blackers’ should denote but the same occupation; but\r\nso it is—they, like our old ‘Walter le Blakesters’ or ‘Richard le\r\nBleckesters,’ being but the harder and more antique form of our present\r\n‘bleacher.’[330] Our term ‘bleak,’ preserving as it does the earlier\r\npronunciation, is but the same word, being formerly used to denote\r\npallor, or wanness, or absence of colour. From this, by a natural\r\nchange, it came to signify anything cheerless or desolate. With perfect\r\nhonesty in this case, at any rate, we may ‘swear that black is white.’\r\n\r\nWith regard to silk, we had but little to do. The manufacture of this\r\nimportant cloth was barely carried on in Western Europe during the\r\nperiod of the establishment of surnames. It was nigh the close of the\r\nfifteenth century before it appeared in France. All our silks were\r\nimported from the East by Venetian and Genoese merchants. Of the latter\r\nan old poem says, they come—\r\n\r\n             Into this londe wyth dyverse merchaundysses,\r\n             In grete karrekis arrayde wythouten lack,\r\n             Wyth clothes of golde, silke, and pepir black.\r\n\r\nStill we find a company of silkwomen settled in London at an early\r\nperiod. In the records of this city occur such names as ‘Johanna\r\nTaylour, Silkwyfe,’ in 1348, and ‘Agatha Fowere, Silkewoman,’ in\r\n1417.[331] In 1455 a complaint was raised by ‘the women of the mystery\r\nand trade of silk and threadworkers in London, that divers Lombards and\r\nother foreigners enriched themselves by ruining the said mystery.’ I\r\nthink, however, we shall find that all these were engaged less in the\r\nmanufacture of fabrics than of threads for the embroiderers to use.\r\nThus, as connected with the throwing or winding of these silken tissues,\r\nwe come across such names as ‘Thrower’ and ‘Throwster,’ the former\r\nhaving been further corrupted into ‘Trower.’[332]\r\n\r\nNext to wool, perhaps leather formed the most important item of early\r\nmanufacture. We can hardly now conceive the infinite use to which it was\r\nput at this period. In military dress it had an especial place, and in\r\nthe ordinary costume it was far from being confined to the extremities,\r\nas we have it now. Jerkins, chausses, girdles, pouches, gipsire—all came\r\nunder the leather-dresser’s hands. In 1378 we find a jury, called\r\ntogether to decide upon a case of alleged bad tanning, to have been\r\ncomposed of ‘saddlers, pouchmakes, girdlers, botel-makers, tanners,\r\ncurriers, and cordwainers.’ Of the more general manufacture of hides we\r\nhave numerous relics; indeed, we are at once introduced into the midst\r\nof a throng of tradesmen, the very list of which proves the then\r\nimportant character of the article on which they spent their energies.\r\nSuch names as ‘Jordan le Tannur,’ or ‘Loretta le Tannur,’ ‘Richard le\r\nSkynnere,’ or ‘Hamo le Skynnere,’ are still numerous both in the tanyard\r\nand the directory, and need little explanation. Our ‘Curriers’ are also\r\nself-evident; but I have not met with any instance as yet in mediæval\r\ntimes. Our more rare ‘Fellmongers’ were once occupied more directly with\r\nthe larger hides, or _fells_, as they were called, of the farmyard\r\nstock. Less connected with them, therefore, than with the others, we may\r\nmention such men as ‘William le Barcur,’ or ‘Nicholas le Barkere,’ or\r\n‘Robert Barcarius,’ the ancestors of our modern ‘Barkers,’[333] who, by\r\nthe very frequency with which they are met, show how important was the\r\npreparation of bark in the tanners’ yard. In the conversation between\r\nEdward the Fourth and the Tanner of Tamworth, as given by Percy, it is\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n                ‘What craftsman art thou?’ said the king;\r\n                  ‘I pray thee telle me trowe,’\r\n                ‘I am a Barker, Sir, by my trade;\r\n                  Now tell me, what art thou?’\r\n\r\nSuch names as ‘John le Tawyere’ or ‘Geoffrey le Whitetawier’ (now found\r\nas ‘Whittear,’ ‘Whittier,’ and ‘Whityer’), not to mention such an entry\r\nas that of ‘Richard le Megucer,’ throw us back upon the time when the\r\nterms these men severally bore as surnames would be of the most familiar\r\nimport. Their owners spent their energies in preparing the lighter goat\r\nand kid skins, which they whitened, and made ready for the glovers’\r\nuse.[334] The verb ‘to taw,’ however, was also used of dressing flax,\r\nand we may have to place ‘Tawyer’ in some instances in this category.\r\n\r\n                  And whilst that they did nimbly spin\r\n                    The hemp he needs must taw,\r\n\r\nwe are told in ‘Robin Goodfellow.’ Our ‘Towers,’ while apparently local,\r\nmay be in some instances but a corruption of this same term. So early as\r\nthe 14th century we find a certain ‘Eustace le Wittowere’ occurring in\r\nthe Hundred Rolls, and that the simpler form should similarly be\r\ncorrupted would be natural enough.[335] Thus we see that leather, too,\r\nis not without its memorials. The more furry skins, as used in a\r\nsomewhat more specific form as articles of dress, or to attach thereto,\r\nwe will allude to by-and-by. As we traverse in some semblance of order\r\nthe more definite wants and requirements of early social life, the\r\nimportance of these several crafts will be more clearly brought out. We\r\nmust not forget that there were the same needs then as now, though of a\r\ndifferent mould. Man in all time has had to be fed, and clothed, and\r\nhoused; and if in all these respects he has in these modern days become\r\nmore civilized and polished, it has been the result of a gradual process\r\nby which he has slowly, and not without many a struggle, thrown off, one\r\nby one, this custom and that, which belonged to a ruder era and a\r\nrougher cast of society. Our surnames of occupation are a wonderful\r\nguide in this respect. A tolerable picture of early life may be easily\r\nset before us by their aid; for in them are preserved its more definite\r\nlineaments, and all we need is to fill up the shading for ourselves.\r\nForgotten wants, needs now no longer felt, requirements of which a\r\nprogressive civilization slowly slipped the tether, necessities of\r\ndress, of habit, of routine, all, while the reality has long faded from\r\nview, have left their abiding memorial in the nomenclature of those who\r\ndirectly supplied them. Let us, however, observe, as in our other\r\nchapters, some kind of order—clothing, food, and general needs, this\r\nseems the proper course of procedure. And yet one more observation ere\r\nwe do so. We have already spoken of the early system of signs as\r\nadvertising the character of the articles to be sold. The early shop was\r\nfar more prominent as a rule than the modern one. The counter, instead\r\nof being within the walls of the house, projected forward upon the\r\npathway, so much so that we can only compare them to those tables we may\r\noften see at night, where under the lee of the walls costermongers offer\r\nshellfish, or tripe, or coffee to the passers-by. This was objectionable\r\nenough; but it was not all. Each dealer loudly proclaimed to the\r\nwayfarer the merits of his goods, vying with his neighbour in his\r\nendeavours to attract attention to himself or distract it from the\r\nother, especially if, as was often the case, a number of traders\r\ntrafficked in the same class of merchandise. Others, and their name was\r\nlegion, had no shop at all, not even the street table or counter, but\r\npassing up and down with wooden platters or deep baskets, made the very\r\nair discordant with their loudly reiterated cries of ‘Hot sheep’s feet,’\r\nor ‘Mackerel,’ or ‘Fresh-herring,’[336] or ‘Hot peascods,’ or\r\n‘Coloppes.’ It is in reference to this we find Langland saying—\r\n\r\n                        Cokes and their knaves,\r\n                        Cryden, ‘Hote pies, hote!\r\n                        Goode gees and grys!\r\n                        Gowe, dyne, gowe!’\r\n\r\nLydgate has a still fuller and more detailed description of this in his\r\n‘London Lackpenny,’ and as it is tolerably humorous I will quote it\r\nsomewhat largely, using Mr. Bowen’s modernization of it—\r\n\r\n      Within this hall neither rich nor yet poor\r\n        Would do for me aught, although I should die:\r\n      Which seeing, I got me out of the door,\r\n        When Flemings began on me for to cry:\r\n        ‘Master, what will you copen or buy?\r\n      Fine felt hats, or spectacles to read?\r\n      Lay down your silver, and here you may speed.’\r\n\r\n      Then into London I did me hie—\r\n        Of all the land it beareth the prize.\r\n      ‘Hot peascods!’ one began to cry;\r\n        ‘Strawberries ripe, and cherries in the rise!’\r\n        One bade me come near and buy some spice:\r\n      Pepper and saffron they gan me bede,\r\n      But, for lack of money, I might not speed.\r\n\r\n      Then to the Chepe I gan me drawen,\r\n        Where much people I saw for to stand.\r\n      One offered me velvet, silk, and lawn:\r\n        Another he taketh me by the hand:\r\n        ‘Here is Paris thread, the finest in the land!’\r\n      I never was used to such things indeed,\r\n      And, wanting money, I might not speed.\r\n\r\n      Then went I forth by London Stone,\r\n        And throughout all Candlewick Street:\r\n      Drapers much cloth me offered anon;\r\n        Then comes me one crying, ‘Hot sheep’s feet!’\r\n        One cried ‘Mackerel!’ ‘Ryster green!’ another gan me greet.\r\n      One bade me buy a hood to cover my head:\r\n      But, for lack of money, I might not speed.\r\n\r\n      Then into Cornhill anon I rode,\r\n        Where there was much stolen gear among.\r\n      I saw where hong mine owne hood\r\n        That I had lost among the throng—\r\n        To buy my own hood, I thought it wrong—\r\n      I knew it as I did my Creed,\r\n      But, for lack of money, I could not speed.\r\n\r\nIf we pass on from shop to shop in a more quiet and undisturbed fashion\r\nthan poor ‘London Lackpenny,’ we must not forget that we are, at least\r\nso far, enjoying that which our forefathers could not.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the head-dress, and to begin with this, we have many\r\nmemorials. ‘Tire,’ once a familiar word enough, is still preserved from\r\ndecay by our Authorized Version of the Scriptures. Thus, for example, it\r\nis said in Ezekiel, ‘make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of\r\nthine head upon thee.’[337] I do not know how comprehensive are the\r\nduties belonging to our present ‘tirewoman’ or lady’s-maid, but in the\r\nday when the tragic story of Jezebel was first translated, the sense of\r\nthe word was entirely confined to the arrangement of her mistress’s\r\n‘tiara,’ which is but another form of the same term. In the ‘Paradise\r\nLost’ it is found as ‘tiar’—\r\n\r\n         Of beaming sunny rays, a golden tiar circled his head.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember their former size, their horned and peaked character,\r\nand the variety of the material used, arguing as they do the then\r\nimportance of the fact, we need not be surprised at meeting with\r\ncomparative frequency such a surname as ‘Tyrer,’ ‘Tyerman,’ or\r\n‘Tireman.’ It is somewhat hard to say whether our ‘Coffers’ are relics\r\nof the old ‘Coffrer’ or ‘Coifer,’ but as the latter business was all but\r\nentirely in the hands of females, perhaps it will be safer to refer them\r\nto the other. Such names, however, as ‘Emma la Coyfere’ or ‘Dionysia la\r\nCoyfere,’ found in the thirteenth century, may serve to remind us of the\r\npeculiar style of the head-gear which the ladies affected in these\r\nearlier times. The more special occupation of preparing feathers or\r\nplumes has left its mark in our ‘Plumer’ and ‘Plummer,’ memorials of the\r\nold ‘Mariot le Plumer’ or ‘Peter le Plomer.’ The old ‘caul’ or ‘call’\r\nstill lives in our ‘Calmans’ and ‘Callers.’ ‘Elias le Callere’ occurs in\r\nthe Parliamentary Writs, and ‘Robert le Callerere’ in the ‘Munimenta\r\nGildhallæ.’ Judging from the ‘Wife of Bath’s Tale,’ we should imagine\r\nthis also to have been a female head-dress. There the old witch appeals\r\nto the Queen and her court of lady attendants as to them who wear\r\n‘kercheif or calle’—\r\n\r\n              Let see, which is the proudest of them alle,\r\n              That weareth on a kercheif or a calle.\r\n\r\nAnother form of the surname is found in ‘Alicia la Kellere,’ now simple\r\n‘Keller,’ the article itself being also met with in a similar dress. In\r\nthe ‘Townley Mysteries’ a fallen angel is represented as saying that a\r\ngirl—\r\n\r\n                   If she be never so foul a dowde\r\n                     With her kelles and her pynnes,\r\n                   The shrew herself can shroud\r\n                     Both her chekys, and her chynnes.\r\n\r\nIn its several more general uses it has always maintained its strict\r\nmeaning of a covering.[338] Hoshea, we may recollect, speaks\r\nfiguratively of God’s ‘rending the caul of Israel’s heart.’ Probably the\r\nword is connected with the ‘cowl’ of other monkish days, and thus may be\r\nassociated with our ‘Coulmans’ and ‘Cowlers.’ ‘Richard le Couhelere,’ an\r\nentry of the fifteenth century, may belong to the same group.[339] A\r\nonce familiar sobriquet for a hood was that of ‘chapelle,’[340] whence\r\nour edifice of that name and the diminutive ‘chaplet.’ The Parliamentary\r\nWrits give us an ‘Edmund le Chapeler;’ the Hundred Rolls furnish us,\r\namong other instances, with a ‘Robert le Chapeler.’ ‘Theobald le\r\nHatter,’ ‘Robert le Hattare,’ ‘Thomas le Capiere,’ ‘Symon le Cappere,’\r\nor ‘John Capman’ need no explanation. The articles they sold, whether of\r\nbeaver, or felt, or mere woollen cloth, were largely imported from\r\nFlanders. Thus it is that Lydgate, as I have but recently shown,\r\npicturing the streets of London, mentions spots in his progress\r\ntherethrough where—\r\n\r\n                 Flemings began on me for to cry,\r\n                 ‘Master, what will you copen or buy?\r\n                 Fine felt hats, or spectacles to read?’\r\n\r\nThat many of these wares, however, were of home manufacture is equally\r\nundoubted, and of this we are reminded by our ‘Blockers,’\r\nrepresentatives of the old ‘Deodatus le Blokkere.’ The ‘block’ was the\r\nwooden mould upon which the hat was shaped and crowned. In ‘Much Ado\r\nAbout Nothing’ Beatrice is made to say: ‘He wears his faith but as the\r\nfashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.’ The ‘blocker,’\r\nI doubt not, was but a hat-maker; we still call a stupid man a\r\n_blockhead_. Our ‘Hurrers’ (‘Alan le Hurer,’ H.R., ‘Geoffrey le\r\nHurwere,’ H.R.), once so important as to form a special company with\r\narticles and overseers, as representative of an old general term, are\r\nnot so familiar as we might have expected them. Bonnets, caps, hoods,\r\nhats, all came under their hands. Strictly speaking, however, a ‘hure’\r\nor ‘howre,’ as Chaucer spells it, was a shaggy cap of fur, or coarse\r\njagged cloth. In an old political song of Edward the First’s time it is\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n             Furst there sit an old cherle in a blake hure,\r\n             Of all that there sitteth seemeth best sure.\r\n\r\nThat the word itself should have dropped from our vocabulary is to me a\r\nmystery.[341] Even in our nomenclature the rarity of our ‘Hurers’ and\r\n‘Hurrers’ is to me inexplicable, bearing as it does no possible\r\nproportion to the former importance of the occupation. But this, as I\r\nhave said before, is one of the peculiarities of personal nomenclature,\r\ndepending entirely as it does on the uncertainties of descent. The head,\r\nwe see, was not neglected.\r\n\r\nThe sale of woollen cloth by our ‘clothiers’ and ‘drapers’ we have\r\nalready mentioned. The tailor then, as now, made it up into the garments\r\nwhich the age required. Few names went through so many metamorphoses as\r\nthis. ‘Mainwaring,’ it is said, can be found in over a hundred and\r\nthirty different spellings. The exact number with regard to ‘Taylor’ I\r\ncannot state, as I have not dared hitherto to encounter the task of\r\ncollecting them. The forms recorded in one register alone give us such\r\nvarieties as ‘le Tayllur,’ ‘le Tayllour,’ ‘le Tayller,’ ‘le Taylir,’ ‘le\r\nTaylour,’ ‘le Taylur,’ ‘le Taillur,’ and ‘le Talur.’ We have also the\r\nfeminine ‘la Taylurese’ in the same roll.[342] A name obsolete now in a\r\ncolloquial sense, but common enough in our directories, is ‘Parminter,’\r\n‘Parmenter,’ or ‘Parmitar,’ a relic of the old Norman-French\r\n‘Parmentier,’ a term a few hundred years ago familiarly used also for\r\nthe snip. Among other mediæval forms are ‘Geoffrey le Parmunter,’ ‘Saher\r\nle Parmentier,’ ‘William le Parmeter,’ and ‘Richard le Parmuter.’ The\r\nHundred Rolls give us the same sobriquet in a Latin dress as ‘William\r\nParmuntarius.’[343] As associated with the tailor, we may here set down\r\nour ‘Sempsters,’ that is, ‘Seamster,’ the once feminine of ‘Seamer,’ one\r\nwho seamed or sewed. Mr. Lower hints that our ‘Seymours’ may in some\r\ninstances be a corruption of this latter form, but I must confess I\r\ndiscover no traces of it.\r\n\r\nThe sobriquet of ‘William le Burreller’ introduces us to a cloth of a\r\ncheap mixture, brown in colour, of well-nigh everlasting wear, and worn\r\nby all the poorer classes of society at this period. So universal was it\r\nthat they came to be known by the general term of ‘borel-folk,’ a phrase\r\nfamiliar enough to deeper students of antiquarian lore. The Franklin\r\npremises his story by saying—\r\n\r\n                  But, sires, because I am a borel man,\r\n                  At my beginning first I you beseech\r\n                  Have me excused of my rude speech.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Burrells’ are still sufficiently common to preserve a remembrance\r\nof this now decayed branch of trade. They may derive their name either\r\nfrom the term ‘borel’ or ‘burel’ pure and simple, or from ‘Burreller,’\r\nand thus represent the trade from which the other, as a sobriquet, owed\r\nits rise. The manufacturer is referred to by ‘Cocke Lorelle,’ in the\r\nline—\r\n\r\n                  Borlers, tapestry-work-makers, dyers.\r\n\r\nSpecial articles of costume now wholly disused, or confined or altered\r\nin sense, crop out abundantly in this class of surnames. At this period\r\na common outdoor covering for the neck was the wimple, or folded vail,\r\nworn by women. To this day, I need not say, it is part of the conventual\r\ndress. The author I have just quoted beautifully describes Shame as—\r\n\r\n                 Humble of her port, and made it simple\r\n                 Wearing a vaile, instede of wimple,\r\n                 As nuns done in their abbey.\r\n\r\nOf this princess, too, whose careful dress he so particularly describes,\r\nhe says—\r\n\r\n                   Full seemly her wimple pinched was.\r\n\r\nThe maker of such was, of course, our ‘Wympler.’[344] Among other\r\nornaments belonging to the princess, also, is mentioned ‘a pair of\r\nbeads,’ that is, bracelets of small coral, worn upon the arm, and in\r\nthis case ‘gauded with green.’ A ‘Simon Wyld, Bedemaker,’ is found in\r\nthe London records of this time, and no doubt ‘Thomas le Perler’ could\r\nhave told us something about the same. Beside these, therefore, we may\r\nset our still existing ‘Paternosters,’ relics of the old ‘Paternostrer,’\r\nwho strung the chaplet of beads for pattering aves. ‘Paternoster Row,’\r\nliterally the ‘Paternostrer’s Row’ was some centuries ago the abode of a\r\ngroup of these, doubtless then busy artisans. Mr. Riley, in his\r\ninteresting ‘Memorials of London,’ records a ‘William le Paternostrer’\r\nas dwelling thereby.[345] It is among such valuables we must undoubtedly\r\nset pins at this period. Judging by those which have descended to us, we\r\nshould best describe them as ‘skewers.’ So anxious was Absolom the clerk\r\nto please Alison that, according to Chaucer, he sent her—\r\n\r\n                  Pinnes, methe (mead), and spiced ale.\r\n\r\nWhatever her appetite for the latter, there can be little doubt that the\r\nfirst would be acceptable enough in a day when these were so valued and\r\ncostly as to be oftentimes made objects of bequeathment. Such entries as\r\n‘Andrew le Pynner’ or ‘Walter le Pinner’ are, of course, common at this\r\ntime, and their descendants still flourish in our midst. Our more rare\r\n‘Needlers’ are but relics of such folk as ‘Richard le Nedlere’ or ‘John\r\nle Nedlemakyere.’[346] Piers, in his Vision, speaks of—\r\n\r\n                      Tymme the tynkere\r\n                      And tweyne of his ’prentices:\r\n                      Hikke the hakeney-man,\r\n                      And Hugh the nedlere.\r\n\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’ also mentions—\r\n\r\n                  Pavyers, belle-makers, and brasyers,\r\n                  Pynners, nedelers, and glasyers.\r\n\r\nThe Norman form ‘le Agguiler,’ or ‘Auguiler,’ still lives in our\r\n‘Aguilers’ if not ‘Aguilars.’ A ‘Thomas le Agguiler’ represented York in\r\nthe Parliament of 1305. Chaucer uses ‘aguiler’ in the sense of a\r\nneedlecase—\r\n\r\n                     A silver needle forth I drew,\r\n                     Out of an aguiler quaint ’ynow.\r\n\r\nBut if pins and needles were valued more highly then than they are now,\r\nnone the less did ‘buttons’ fulfil their own peculiar and important use.\r\n‘Henry le Botoners’ or ‘Richard le Botyners’[347] may be found in most\r\nof our records. I do not see, however, that their descendants have\r\npreserved the sobriquet, unless, after the fashion of several other\r\nwords in our vocabulary, they are flourishing secretly among our\r\n‘Butlers,’ and thus helping to swell the already strong phalanx that\r\nsurname has mustered. While, however, all these representatives of so\r\nmany though kindred occupations seem to have flourished in their\r\nseparate capacities, I do not doubt but that ‘Richard le Haberdasher’\r\nwould have been able to supply most of the wares they dealt in. His was\r\na common and lucrative employment in a day when, to judge by the\r\ncontents of a shop of this kind as set down in the London Rolls, he\r\ncould offer for purchase such a wide assortment as spurs and shirts,\r\nchains and nightcaps, spectacles and woollen threads, beads and\r\npen-cases, combs and ink-horns, parchments and whipcords, gaming-tables\r\nand coffins (Riley’s ‘London Memorials,’ p. 422). There seems to be\r\nlittle doubt, however, that in the first place he dealt simply in the\r\n‘hapertas,’ a kind of coarse, thick cloth much in vogue at this time,\r\nand that it was from this he acquired the name he bore.[348]\r\n\r\nThe now, I fear, obsolete ‘Camiser’ made the ‘camis’ or chemise, or\r\nlinen underdress—he was the shirtmaker, in fact. The former spelling\r\nlingered on to Spenser’s time, who writes of a\r\n\r\n                       Camis light of purple silk.\r\n\r\nIt is with him we must properly associate our ‘Smockers,’ ‘Smookers,’\r\nand anachronistic ‘Smokers,’ who, though their chief memorial remains in\r\nthe rustic smockfrock still familiar in our country districts, were\r\nnevertheless chiefly busied with the ‘smok,’ such as the patient\r\nGriselda wore. Of one of his characters Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n                 Through her smocke wroughte with silke\r\n                 The flesh was seene as white as milke.\r\n\r\nSuch phrases as ‘smock-treason,’ ‘smock-loyalty,’ and ‘smock-race,’ and\r\nthe flower ‘Lady-smock,’[349] still remind us that the word was once\r\ngenerally understood of female attire. Of the flower Shakespeare makes\r\nbeautiful mention when he says—\r\n\r\n                   And ladysmocks all silver white,\r\n                   Do paint the meadows with delight.\r\n\r\nThe word slop is now well-nigh confined to the nether garments of our\r\nyoungsters, but though, in this pluralized sense, it can date back to\r\nthe time when the bard of Avon said of one of his personages that he\r\nwas—\r\n\r\n                   From the waist downwards all slops,\r\n\r\nstill, singularly used, it was in vogue far earlier. A ‘slop’ in\r\nChaucer’s day, and even up to the fifteenth century, was a kind of frock\r\nor overmantle.[350] In the ‘Chanon Yemannes’s Tale,’ the host expresses\r\nhis surprise that the Chanon, a ‘lord of so high degree,’ should make so\r\nlight of his worship and dignity as to wear garments well-nigh worn out.\r\nHe says—\r\n\r\n                 His overest sloppe is not worth a mite.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Slopers’ still remind us of this. Our ‘Pilchers,’ relics of ‘Hugh\r\nle Pilecher’ or ‘Nicholas le Pilchere,’ are equally interesting. In his\r\nproverbs on covetousness and negligence, the writer I have just\r\ninstanced thus speaks—\r\n\r\n                      After great heat cometh cold,\r\n                      No man cast his pylche away.\r\n\r\nA ‘pilch’ was a large outer tippet made of fur, and worn in winter. The\r\nmodern ladies’ ‘pelisse’ is but another form of the same root. Speaking\r\nof furs, however, we must not forget our ‘Furriers,’ and once common\r\n‘Pelters’ and ‘Pellipers.’ They were engaged in the preparation of the\r\nmore furry coats of the wilder animals. In the Hundred and other Rolls\r\nmention is frequently made of such names as ‘Geoffrey le Pelter’ or\r\n‘Reyner le Peleter.’ A ‘pell’ or ‘pelt’ was any undressed skin. The\r\n‘clerk of the Pells’ used to be the guardian of the rolls of the\r\nExchequer, which were written upon a coarse parchment of this kind. As a\r\ngeneral term of dress it was once of the most familiar import.\r\nWicklyffe, in his complaint to the king, speaks of the poor being\r\ncompelled to provide gluttonous priests with ‘fair hors, and jolly and\r\ngay saddles and bridles, ringing by the way, and himself in costly cloth\r\nand pelure.’ An old song written against the mendicant friars, too,\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n                 Some friars beren pelure aboute,\r\n                 For grete ladys and wenches stoute,\r\n                 To reverce with their clothes withoute,\r\n                     All after that they are.\r\n\r\nAmong the many ordinances passed to curtail the subject’s liberty in\r\nregard to his attire, much is written on the fashion of wearing furs. It\r\nseems to have been the great mark between the higher and lower classes.\r\nIn 1337 it was enacted by Edward III. that no one of those whom we now\r\nterm the operative class should wear any fur on his or her dress, the\r\nfur to be forfeited if discovered. The names I have mentioned above\r\nstill remain in fair numbers as a memorial of this period.\r\n\r\nSuch a name from the ‘Rolls of Parliament’ as that of ‘John Orfroiser,’\r\nalthough now obsolete, reminds us of an art for which English craftsmen\r\nobtained a well-nigh European reputation in mediæval times, that of\r\nembroidery. ‘Aurifrigium’ was the Latin word applied to it, and this\r\nmore clearly betrays the golden tissues of which its workmanship mainly\r\nconsisted. In the ‘Romance of the Rose,’ it is said of the fair maid\r\n‘Idlenesse’—\r\n\r\n                     And of fine orfrais had she eke\r\n                     A chapelet, so seemly on,\r\n                     Ne wered never maide upon.[351]\r\n\r\nThe term ‘Broiderer,’[352] however, was the more common, and with him\r\nall textures and all colours and all threads came alike. The Hebrew word\r\nin our Bible, variously rendered as ‘broidered work,’ ‘needlework,’ and\r\n‘raiment of needlework,’ was translated in a day when this would be of\r\nthe most familiar import. Our ‘Pointers’ and ‘Poynters’ manufactured the\r\ntagged lace which fastened the hose and doublet together. In\r\nShakespeare’s ‘1 Henry IV.’ there is a playful allusion to this where\r\nFalstaff, in the act of saying—\r\n\r\n                       Their points being broken,\r\n\r\nis interrupted by the response—\r\n\r\n                          Down fell their hose.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the presence of this name in our modern\r\ndirectories is entirely the result of later French refugee immigration;\r\nbut such registered forms as ‘John le Poyntour,’ ‘Robert le Poynter,’ or\r\n‘William Poyntmakere’ are found in the records of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries with sufficient frequency to justify the belief\r\nthat it was a much earlier denizen than many suppose.[353] In the former\r\n‘Henry le Lacer’ or ‘Richard le Lacer’ we have, too, but a\r\nfellow-manufacturer. Lace, it is true, is now rather a delicate fabric\r\nof interwoven threads; once, however, it was but the braided string for\r\nfastening the different articles of dress together. Thus, the\r\n‘shoes-_latchet_’ mentioned in Scripture is a mere diminutive of the\r\nword as thus used. The hose and doublet were invariably so attached. The\r\nverb ‘to lace,’ I need not add, is still entirely employed in this its\r\nliteral sense. There were other means, however, of holding the several\r\ngarments together, and not a few of which are still brought to our\r\nremembrance in our nomenclature. ‘Adam le Gurdlere’ or ‘Robert le\r\nGirdlere’ speaks for himself. It was for the girdle our former ‘Agnes\r\nPouchemakers,’ ‘Henry Pouchers,’ ‘Robert le Purseres,’ and ‘Alard le\r\nBursers’ (when not official) made the leathern pouch carried thus at her\r\nside for greater readiness by the careful housewife. Chaucer, whose\r\nsharply-cut descriptions of the dress of his company are invaluable to\r\nthose who would study more closely the habits of the time, tells us of\r\nthe Carpenter’s wife that—\r\n\r\n                   By her girdle hung a purse of leather,\r\n               Tasseled with silk and pearled with laton.\r\n\r\nThe Norman equivalent of Girdler was ‘le Ceynturer’ (‘Nicholas le\r\nCeynturer,’ A.) or ‘le Ceinter,’ but I have failed to find any traces of\r\nit beyond the fourteenth century.[354] Our decayed ‘Brailers’[355] and\r\n‘Bregirdlers’ represent but the same occupation in more definite terms.\r\nThe old English ‘brayle’ (from the Norman ‘braie’ or ‘braye,’ meaning\r\n‘breeches’) was a waistband merely, a kind of strap, oftentimes attached\r\nto and part of the trousers themselves. The nautical phrase of ‘brailing\r\nup sails’ is, I fear, the only relic we possess conversationally of this\r\nonce useful term. A ‘brailer’ (‘Roger le Braeler,’ A., ‘Stephen le\r\nBrayeler,’ X.) or ‘bregirdler’ (‘John le Bregerdelere,’ X.) was, of\r\ncourse, a manufacturer of these. Maundeville, in his ‘Travels,’ speaks\r\nof a ‘breek-girdille’ (p. 50). The now almost universal suspender was a\r\nlater introduction, the names of ‘Bracegirdler’ and ‘Bracegirdle,’ which\r\nare not yet extinct, denoting, seemingly, the process of change by which\r\nthe one gradually made way for the other. A ‘brace,’ from the Latin\r\n‘brachium,’ the arm, encircles the shoulder as a ‘bracelet’ does the\r\nwrist. It is quite possible, however, they may be but a form of\r\n‘breek-girdle.’ ‘Ivo le Glover’ or ‘Christiana la Glovere’ have left\r\ndescendants in plenty, but they had to fight a hard battle with such\r\nnaturalized foreigners as ‘Geoffery le Ganter’ or ‘Philip le Gaunter.’\r\nAt one time these latter had firmly established themselves as the\r\nnominees of the manufacture, and the only wonder to me is how we managed\r\nto prevent ‘gants’ from superseding ‘gloves’ in our common parlance. The\r\nconnexion of the ‘gauntlet’ with military dress, however, has preserved\r\nthat form of the term from decay. Both ‘Ganter’ and ‘Gaunter,’ I need\r\nscarcely say, are firmly set in our midst.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must descend once more till we come to the lower extremities,\r\nand in a day of so much tramping it on foot we need not feel surprised\r\nif we find many memorials of this branch of the personal outfit. The\r\nonce common expression for a shoemaker or cobbler was that of\r\n_souter_.[356] It is of constant occurrence in our olden writers. Thus\r\nthe Malvern Dreamer speaks of—\r\n\r\n                      Plowmen and pastours,\r\n                      And othere commune laborers,\r\n                      Sowters and shepherdes.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, too, he uses the feminine form when he makes mention of—\r\n\r\n                          Cesse the souteresse.\r\n\r\nThe masculine term, I need not remind Scotchmen, is still in colloquial\r\nuse across the Border, and that it was once so in England our many\r\n‘Souters,’ ‘Sowters,’ and ‘Suters,’ and ‘Suitors,’ misleading as these\r\nlatter are, are sufficient evidence. Such entries as ‘Andrew le\r\nSoutere,’ ‘Robert le Souter,’ or ‘Richard le Sutor’ are common to old\r\nregisters. In the ‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ ‘sowtare’ is defined as a\r\n‘cordewaner’ or ‘cordynare,’ and this at once brings us to our\r\n‘Cordwaners,’ ‘Cordiners,’ and ‘Codners.’ They were so termed because\r\nthe goatskin leather they used came, or was supposed to have come, from\r\nCordova in Spain. In the ‘Rime of Sire Thopas,’ that personage is thus\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\n                  His hair, his beard was like safroun,\r\n                  That to his girdle raught adown,\r\n                    His shoon of cordewane;\r\n                  Of Brugges were his hosen brown,\r\n                  His robe was of ciclatoun,\r\n                    That cost many a jane.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Libel on English Policy,’ too, we find it said of Portugal—\r\n\r\n           Their londe hath oyle, wyne, osey, wex, and grain,\r\n           Fygues, reysyns, honey and cordwayne.\r\n\r\nIn the Hundred Rolls it is represented by such a name as ‘Hugh le\r\nCordwaner’ or ‘Ranulph le Cordewaner.’[357] ‘William le Corviser,’ from\r\nthe same records, or ‘Durand le Corveser,’ held a name which struggled\r\nfor some time for a place, but had finally to collapse.[358] ‘Cobbler’\r\n(‘Richard le Cobeler,’ A.), though it has existed as a name of\r\noccupation fully as long as any of the above, has, I believe, never been\r\nable so far to overcome the dislike to the fact of its being a mere\r\nmending or patchwork trade as to obtain for itself an hereditary place\r\nin our nomenclature. ‘Cosier’ has fared better, as have ‘Clouter’ and\r\n‘Cloutman,’ relics of the old ‘John’ or ‘Stephen le Clutere,’ why I do\r\nnot know. We all remember how the inhabitants of Gibeon ‘did work\r\nwilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old\r\nsacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old and rent, and bound up,\r\nand old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them.’\r\nAnother name we may notice here is that of ‘Patten-maker,’ a ‘James\r\nPatyn-makere’ being found enrolled in a Norwich guild of 1385. Cocke\r\nLorelle mentions among others:—\r\n\r\n                      Alys Easy a gay tale-teller,\r\n                      Also Peter Patynmaker.[359]\r\n\r\nA patten seems in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to have been\r\nvery similar to our clog, only that the former was more easily put on\r\nand off. It was of a wooden sole, rimmed with iron. We find in 1464 the\r\nPatynmakers of London presenting a grievance in that the fletchers alone\r\nwere allowed to use aspen-wood, whereas it was the ‘lightest tymbre to\r\nmake of patyns or clogges.’ (Rot. Parl. iv. 567.) Mr. Way, in his Notes\r\nto the ‘Promptorium Parvulorum,’ says they were worn much by\r\necclesiastics to protect the feet from chill when treading the cold bare\r\npavements of the churches, and he quotes a Harleian MS. dated 1390\r\nregarding an archiepiscopal visitation at York: ‘Item, omnes ministri\r\necclesie pro majore parte utuntur in ecclesiâ et in processione _patens_\r\net _clogges_ contra honestatem ecclesie, et antiquam consuetudenem\r\ncapituli.’ The patten-maker was evidently of some importance at this\r\ntime.[360]\r\n\r\nPerhaps fashion never went to such an absurd extreme as it did in the\r\nfourteenth century with respect to wearing peaked shoes. An old poem\r\nentitled the ‘Complaint of the Ploughman,’ says of the friars, and\r\nalluding to their inconsistencies, that they wear—\r\n\r\n                 Cutted clothes to shewe their hewe,\r\n                   With long pikes on their shoon:\r\n                 Our Goddes Gospell is not trewe\r\n                   Either they serve the devill or none.\r\n\r\nPiers Plowman, too, speaks of a knight coming to be dubbed—\r\n\r\n                        To geten him gilte spurs\r\n                          Or galoches y-couped.\r\n\r\nThis last reminds us that they were commonly styled ‘copped shoon.’ Such\r\na sobriquet as ‘Hugh le Coppede’ or ‘John le Copede’ would seem to refer\r\nto this. Probably the owner had carried on the practice to an even more\r\nextravagant length than his neighbours, and very likely he was one of\r\nthose who caused a law to be passed in 1463 forbidding any knight, or\r\nany one beneath that rank, to wear any shoes or boots having pikes\r\npassing the length of two inches! Even this curtailment, I imagine,\r\nwould astonish the weak minds of pedestrians in the nineteenth century.\r\nOf a similar craft with the shoemaker came ‘the hosier’ or ‘chaucer,’\r\nthe latter of which has become, surnominally, so famous in English\r\nliterature. Though now obsolete, such a name as ‘Robert le Chaucer’ or\r\n‘William le Chaucier’ was anything but uncommon at this time. Like\r\n‘Suter,’ above-mentioned, it has a Latin source, its root being\r\n‘calcearius.’ Chausses, however, were not so much boots as a kind of\r\nleathern breeches worn over mail armour. There is probably, therefore,\r\nbut little distinction to be made between them and the ‘hose’ of former\r\ndays, though it is somewhat odd that leather, which once undoubtedly was\r\nthe chief object of the hosier’s attention, should now in his shop be\r\nconspicuous by its absence. While ‘Chaucer’ has long ago become extinct,\r\n‘Hosier’ or ‘Hozier’ is firmly established in our nomenclature. Thus we\r\nsee that clothing is not without its mementoes.\r\n\r\nA curious surname is presented for our notice in our ‘Dubbers,’ not to\r\nbe confounded with our ‘Daubers’ already mentioned. To ‘dub’ was to\r\ndress, or trim, or decorate. Thus, with regard to military equipment,\r\nMinot says in one of his political songs—\r\n\r\n                   Knightes were there well two score\r\n                   That were new dubbed to that dance.\r\n\r\nIt is thus we have acquired our phrase ‘to dub a knight.’ The term,\r\nhowever, became very general in the sense of embellishing, rather than\r\nmere dressing, and it is to this use of the word we owe the surname.\r\nThus, in the ‘Liber Albus’ we find a ‘Peter le Dubbour’ recorded, whose\r\ntrade was to furbish up old clothes; he was a fripperer in fact. In the\r\nYork Pageant, already referred to more than once, we see the ‘Dubbers’\r\nwalking in procession between the ‘Bookbinders’ and ‘Limners,’ and here\r\nthey were evidently mere trimmers or decorators externally of books. In\r\nanother register we find a ‘dubbour,’ so called because as a hawker of\r\nfish he was in the habit of putting all the fine ones at the top of his\r\nbasket, a trick still in vogue in that profession, I fear.[361] In all\r\nthese cases we see that ‘adornment’ or ‘embellishment’ is the main idea.\r\nI need not remind my more North-country readers how every gardener still\r\nspeaks of ‘dubbing’ when he heaps up afresh the soil about his flowers\r\nand plants. The old forms of the name were ‘Jordan le Dubber,’ ‘Payen le\r\nDubbour,’ and ‘Ralph le Douber,’ which last most nearly approaches its\r\nroot, the old Norman-French ‘adouber,’ to arrange.\r\n\r\nA curious occupation is preserved from oblivion in our somewhat rare\r\n‘Raffmans.’ We have the root meaning of the word in our ‘reft’ and\r\n‘bereft,’ implicative of that which is snatched away or swept off. Thus\r\nwe still use ‘riff-raff’ in regard to the off-scouring of the people. A\r\nraff-merchant was a dealer in lumber of any kind. In the Guild of Saint\r\nGeorge, Norwich, 1385, we find not merely the name of ‘John Raffman,’\r\nbut such entries as ‘Robert Smith, raffman,’ or ‘John Smith, rafman.’\r\nThe term ‘raff’ for a low fellow is not yet obsolete, and Tennyson, when\r\nhe says\r\n\r\n                  Let raffs be rife in prose or rhyme,\r\n\r\nis only using a sobriquet which, until recently, was a very familiar one\r\nin the mouths of our peasantry. I have placed the surname here because I\r\ndoubt not the occupation whence it sprung was chiefly in respect of\r\ntrimmings, and the shearings of cloth, wool, and such like articles of\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nAnother surname we must consider here is that belonging to ‘Ketel le\r\nMercer’ or ‘Henry le Mercer,’ now found also as ‘Marcer.’ We see in the\r\nvery title that the term has engrossed a sense not strictly its own, and\r\nthat, though we visit the mercer’s shop for silken goods, he was\r\noriginally a dealer in every kind of ware. He represented in mediæval\r\ntimes, in fact, the storekeeper of our colonies. Indeed I believe that\r\nto this day in some of our more retired country parts the mercer will\r\nsupply his customers with haberdashery, drugs, draperies, hardware, and\r\nall general wants, saving actual comestibles. Mr. Lower quotes an old\r\npolitical song against the friars, in which this more correct sense of\r\nthe word is conveyed—\r\n\r\n                    For thai have nought to live by,\r\n                      They wandren here and there,\r\n                    And dele with divers marcerye\r\n                      Right as thai pedlars were.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Chaloners’ and ‘Challenors,’ representatives of such old names as\r\n‘Peter le Chaloner,’ ‘Jordan le Chaluner,’ or ‘Nicholas le Chalouner,’\r\noriginated in a foreign but most useful manufacture. Chalons-sur-Marne,\r\nat this time one of the most thriving towns of the Continent, was\r\nchiefly renowned for its woollen and worsted stuffs, and a peculiar\r\ncoverlet of this sort, called by the special name of a ‘chalon,’ became\r\ncelebrated over the more civilized world. In the ‘Reves’ Tale’ we are\r\ntold of the miller that—\r\n\r\n            In his owen chambre he made a bedde\r\n            With shetes, and with chalons fair yspredde.[362]\r\n\r\nAny importer or manufacturer of these was a ‘Chaloner.’ In a public\r\nsolemn pageant held in 1415 in the City of York, at the end of a list of\r\ntrades to be represented, there follows this: ‘It is ordained that the\r\nPorters and Coblers should go first, then, of the right, the Wevers and\r\nCordwaners: on the left, the Fullers, Cutlers, Girdellers, Chaloners,\r\nCarpenters, and Taillyoures: then the better sort of citizens,’ etc.\r\n(‘History and Antiquities of York,’ vol. ii. p. 126.) The trade name\r\nseems to have died out about the end of the fifteenth century. How\r\ncorrupted a word may become in the lapse of time may be seen in the\r\nmodern ‘shalloon,’ a term used for a species of worsted cloth. In such a\r\nname as ‘Hugh le Shetare’ or ‘Roger le Shetere’ we recognize him who\r\nprovided that other portion of the bed gear which is referred to in the\r\nextract from Chaucer. This name is now extinct. Not so, however, our\r\n‘Quilters,’ who still thrive in our midst hale and hearty, and need\r\nnever fear obsoletism. Doubtless, as the cold of winter set in, and its\r\nwarm padded qualities began to be appreciated, the quilters would be\r\nbusy enough in providing such a coverlet as this. ‘Quiltmaker’ (‘John le\r\nQuyltemaker,’ H.) is also found as a variation of the above: an old poem\r\nmentions among others—\r\n\r\n                Quyltemakers, shermen, and armorers;\r\n                Borlers, tapestry-work makers, and dyers.\r\n\r\nSuch a name as ‘Christiana le Heldere’ or ‘Robert le Holdere’ must, I\r\ndoubt not, be set here, both forms being still in existence. They\r\nbelonged, I think, to the craft of upholdsters or upholders, at this\r\ntime confined, it would seem, entirely to the manufacture and sale of\r\nmattresses, bolsters, pillows, and quilts, anything of a padded nature\r\nconnected with bed furniture.[363] The insertion of flocks and feathers\r\nand the stitching together of such would seem to be a woman’s work, and\r\nthis is the clue, I suspect, to the fact of our now using the feminine\r\nform of upholdster. There is a curious complaint made to Parliament in\r\n1495, by the metropolitan upholders, that ‘Quyltes, mattres, and\r\ncussions (were) stuffed with horse hair, fen downe, neetis here, deris\r\nhere (deers’ hair), and gotis here, which is wrought in lyme fattes and\r\nby the hete of mannys body the savour and taste is so abhomynable and\r\ncontagious that many of the King’s subgettis thereby been\r\ndestroied.’[364] It is prayed, therefore, that only one kind of stuff be\r\nallowed to be inserted in any one of these articles (‘Stat: of Realm,’\r\nHenry VII.). In ‘Henry le Canevacer’ or ‘Richard le Canevacer’ we are\r\ncarried back to a class of now all but entirely decayed trade. The\r\ncanvaser, of course, turned out canvas, and this more especially for\r\nbags for the conveyance of the raw wool, or for tapestry purposes. In an\r\nold poem relating to German imports, it is said at the close—\r\n\r\n               Coleyne threde, fustaine, and canvase,\r\n               Carde, bokeram, of olde time thus it wase.\r\n\r\nTapestry work would engage much of this. Hangings of this kind, ere\r\nwainscot came into use, were the ordinary decorations of the baronial\r\napartment, covering as they generally did the entire length of the lower\r\nwall. In the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ we are told of the duties of one\r\nofficer—\r\n\r\n               Tapetis of Spayne on flore by side\r\n               That sprad shall be for pompe and pryde,\r\n               The chambur sydes rygt to the dore\r\n               He hangs with tapetis that ben fulle store.\r\n\r\nThe name of ‘Tapiser,’ for one who wove this article, is familiarized to\r\nus as that of one of the immortal company who sat down together at the\r\n‘Tabard’ in Southwark. Our modern ‘Tapsters,’ I doubt not, afford but\r\nanother example of a surname engrossing what have been originally two\r\nseparate and distinct titles. In an old sacred pageant given in York in\r\n1415, amongst other trades represented we find coupled together the\r\n‘Couchers’ and ‘Tapisers.’[365] Our ‘Couchers’ and ‘Couchmans’ are thus\r\nexplained. They were evidently engaged less in the wooden framework, as\r\nwe might have supposed, than in the manufacture of the cushions that\r\ncovered it, and doubtless, like the broiderer mentioned above, worked in\r\ngold and silver and coloured threads the raised figures thereon.[366]\r\nThus we must ally them with such names as ‘Robert le Dosier’ or ‘Richard\r\nle Dosyere,’ makers of the ‘doss,’ a technical term given at this time\r\nfor cushions or stools worked in tapestry.[367] Thus the same book which\r\nI have just quoted says of the groom’s duties—\r\n\r\n                 The dosurs, curtines to hang in halle,\r\n                 These offices needs do he shalle.\r\n\r\nAs a specific name for productions of this class the word is now quite\r\nobsolete, though familiar enough in early days; tapestry indeed, in\r\ngeneral, has ceased to be popular, and is now all but entirely confined\r\nprofessionally to the weaving of carpets, and as an amateur art among\r\nladies to those figured screens so much in vogue not more than one or\r\ntwo generations ago, traces of which still remain in the framed\r\nembroideries yet lingering in many of our drawing-rooms—embroideries of\r\ncats with grizzly whiskers and tawny terriers—embroideries which as\r\nchildren we heard with bated breath had been worked by our grandmothers\r\nwhen they were little girls, and thus we realised for the first time,\r\nnot so much that they had done these wonderful things as that they had\r\nonce been small at all, like ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have no surname to represent the weaving of carpets, as this was an\r\nintroduction of much later date than most of our other household\r\ncomforts in the way of furniture. In Brand’s ‘Popular Antiquities’ an\r\ninteresting quotation is given from Hentzner’s ‘Itinerary,’ who,\r\ndescribing Queen Elizabeth’s Presence Chamber at Greenwich, says, ‘The\r\nfloor, after the English fashion, was strewed with hay.’ The strewing of\r\nchurch pews with rushes was common until recent times, and in the North\r\nof England the peculiar customs attaching to the ‘Rush-bearing,’ a kind\r\nof ‘wakes,’ are not yet extinct. It is fair to add, however, that\r\ncarpets were in course of introduction at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury; an old poem of that date mentions—\r\n\r\n               Broudurers, strayners, and carpyte-makers,\r\n               Spooners, turners, and hatters.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding any further we had better introduce our ‘Lavenders,’\r\nor washers, for be it linen or woollen stuff, be it garment for the back\r\nor covering for the bed, all needed washing then as now. The contracted\r\nfeminine ‘laundress’ is still in common use. That the masculine form,\r\nhowever, was early applied to the other sex is proved in the ‘Legend of\r\nGood Women,’ where we are told—\r\n\r\n                Envie is lavender of the court alway,\r\n                For she ne parteth neither night ne day.\r\n\r\nThe gradation from ‘lavenderie’ to ‘laundry’ is marked by Stowe, who in\r\nhis ‘Chronicles’ writes it ‘laundery.’ By similar contractions our\r\n‘Lavenders’ are now found also in the other forms of ‘Launder’ and\r\n‘Lander.’ An old poem says—\r\n\r\n                Thou shalt be my launder,\r\n                To washe and keep clean all my gere.[368]\r\n\r\n‘Alicia la Lavendar’ figures in the Hundred Rolls. Doubtless, like our\r\nmore Saxon ‘Washers,’ she was a professional washerwoman. The stiffening\r\nprocess, of infinitely more consequence then than now, has left its mark\r\nin such a name as ‘Ralph le Starkere,’ or even in that of ‘William\r\nStarcman,’ starch and stark being once but synonymous words. Whether it\r\nwere the carefully pinched wimple or the kerchief, whether it were of\r\nsilk or lawn, both alike required all the rigidity that could be\r\nimparted to them, would the head be befittingly adorned. Employed,\r\ntherefore, either in the sale of the starch itself or in the work of\r\nstiffening the dress, we find men of such a title as the above.\r\nDoubtless they are referred to by the author of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote’\r\nwhere he speaks of—\r\n\r\n             Butlers, sterchers, and mustardmakers,\r\n             Hardeware men, mole seekers, and ratte-takers.\r\n\r\nFrom the outer we may now naturally and fitly turn to the provision for\r\nthe inner man. Nor are we without interesting relics also in this\r\nrespect. We have already described the process by which the flour was\r\nprovided. The agencies in the towns for the sale of this, and the uses\r\nto which it was put, are all more or less well defined, and well\r\nestablished also in our present directories. I do not know whether\r\nFrench rolls had obtained celebrity so early as this, but the name of\r\n‘Richard Frenshbaker’ would seem at least to give some kind of credence\r\nto the supposition. There can be no doubt, however, that he dealt in a\r\nfancy way, for in solid bread-baking the Saxon ‘Baker’ has ever kept his\r\nhands in the kneading-trough, and need never fear, so far as our\r\nnomenclature is concerned, being ousted therefrom. The feminine form has\r\nbecome almost equally well established among us, ‘Bagster’ or\r\n‘Baxter’[369] or ‘Backster’ (the latter spelling found in Foxe’s Roll of\r\nMarian martyrs) being among other forms of the old female ‘bakester.’\r\nPiers Plowman speaks of—\r\n\r\n                       Baksteres, and brewesteres,\r\n                       And bochiers manye;\r\n\r\nand such good folk as ‘Elias le Baxter’ or ‘Ralph le Bakster’ or\r\n‘Giliana le Bacster’ are very plentifully represented in our olden\r\nregisters.[370] Still the foreigner did not give way without a struggle.\r\nWe have ‘Pollinger,’ ‘Bullinger,’ ‘Bollinger,’ and ‘Ballinger,’ as\r\ncorruptions of the ‘boulanger’ or ‘Richard le Bulenger,’ as he is\r\nrecorded. In our ‘Furners’ we see the representatives of such a name as\r\n‘William le Furner’ or ‘Walter le Fernier,’ he who looked to the oven,\r\nwhile in the all but unaltered form of ‘Pester’ we may still not\r\nuncommonly meet with the descendants of many an old ‘Richard le Pestour’\r\nor ‘Herman le Pestur,’ who had spent the best of his days in the\r\nbakehouse. Such a name as ‘John Pastemakere’ or ‘Gregory le Pastemakere’\r\nor ‘Andrew le Pyebakere,’ which once existed, reminds us of the\r\npastrycook, a member, as he then was, no doubt, of a by no means\r\nunimportant fraternity—that of the ‘Pastelers’ or ‘Pie-bakers.’ An old\r\npoem speaks of—\r\n\r\n                   Drovers, cokes, and pulters,\r\n                   Yermongers, pybakers, and waferers.\r\n\r\nBest known, however, to most people would he be under the simple\r\nprofessional name of ‘cook.’ I need not remind any student of olden\r\nEnglish records how familiar is ‘Roger le Coke’ or ‘William le Cook’ or\r\n‘John Cokeman,’ nor will he be astonished at his being so well\r\nrepresented in all those forms in the directories of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. I could give endless references to show that this term was not\r\nconfined to the kitchen servitor. The ‘City Archives’ give us an\r\nordinance passed 2 Rich. II. (A.D. 1378) by the ‘Cooks and Pastelers,’\r\nas an associated company, and Piers Plowman speaks of\r\n\r\n                   Punishing on pillories,\r\n                   Or on pynnyng stools,\r\n                   Brewesters, Bakers,\r\n                   Bochers, and Cookes,\r\n                   For these be men upon molde (earth)\r\n                   That most harm worken\r\n                   To the poor people.\r\n\r\n‘Cook’ or ‘Coke’ certainly holds a high position in the scale of\r\nfrequency at present, and, as I have had occasion to notice in another\r\nchapter, is one of those few tradal names that have taken to them the\r\nfilial desinence, ‘Cookson’ being by no means uncommon. Of all these we\r\nmight have said much, but to mention them must suffice, and to pass on.\r\nSolid bread-baking, however, as I have just hinted, was not the sole\r\nemployment of this nature in early days. A poem I have recently quoted\r\nspeaks of ‘waferers.’ Our ‘Wafers,’ relics of the old ‘Simon’ or ‘Robert\r\nle Wafre,’ seem to have confined themselves all but entirely to the\r\nprovision of eucharistic bread, though they were probably vendors also\r\nof those sweet and spiced cakes which, under the name of ‘marchpanes,’\r\nwere decidedly popular. Among other gifts that Absolom the clerk gave\r\nAlison, Chaucer hints of—\r\n\r\n                Wafers piping hot out of the glede,[371]\r\n\r\nand the ‘Pardoner,’ in enumerating the company of lewd folks of\r\nFlanders, speaks of ‘fruitsters,’ ‘singers with harps,’ and ‘waferers.’\r\nPiers Plowman puts them amid still more disreputable associates. No\r\ndoubt, true to the old adage, ‘near the church, never in it,’ they were\r\nwont to hang about the sacred edifice abroad and at home, offering their\r\ntraffic to the devouter worshippers as they entered in. We ourselves\r\nknow how searing to heart and conscience is such a life as this. That\r\nall were not of this kind we are reminded by the will of an Archbishop\r\nof York of the thirteenth century, who therein bequeaths a certain sum\r\nto two ‘waferers,’ evidently on account of their exemplary conduct while\r\nconducting their trade at the Minster door.\r\n\r\nChaucer, describing the prioress, says that—\r\n\r\n             With rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel brede,\r\n\r\nshe fed her small hounds. Cakes of wastel were of the purest flour and\r\nmost careful bake, and were only second to the simnel in quality.\r\nWasteler, found in such an entry as ‘John Wasteler,’ is extinct, but the\r\nshorter ‘Wastel’ still exists in our midst. Probably, in the latter\r\ncase, it was originally but a sobriquet affixed to a baker of this\r\npeculiar kind of bread. It is in a similar manner, I doubt not, arose\r\nsuch early nicknames as ‘William Wytebred,’ or ‘John Holibread,’ or\r\n‘Roger Blancpain,’ or ‘Josce Barlibred,’ or ‘Matilda Havercake,’ or\r\n‘Lambert Simnel,’ the latter a name familiarized to the youngest student\r\nof English history. Strange to say, ‘Barlibred’ is the only one of this\r\nlist that has disappeared from our directories, although ‘Barleycorn’\r\nwas in existence, I believe, but a few years ago. But to keep more\r\nstrictly to tradesmen: I have no doubt myself it is here we must place\r\nour ‘Mitcheners,’ as makers of the ‘mitche’ or ‘mitchkin.’ The\r\ndiminutive was the modern cracknel, while the larger seems to have been\r\na small loaf of mixed flour. Chaucer, in his praise of contentment,\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n                For he that hath mitches tweine,\r\n                Ne value in his demeine,\r\n                Liveth more at ease, and more is rich\r\n                Than doeth he that is chich (niggardly),\r\n                And in his barne hath sooth to saine,\r\n                A hundred mavis of wheat grain.\r\n\r\nI have, however, no proof of the connexion I deem exists, so I merely\r\nmention it and pass on. We are more certain about our rare ‘Flawners’\r\nand ‘Flanners,’[372] once the manufacturers of the ‘flaon’ or ‘flawn,’\r\nso popular as to have left its mark in our ‘Pancake Tuesday.’ Caxton, in\r\nhis ‘Boke for Travellers,’ says, ‘of mylke and of eggs men make\r\nflawnes.’ In the story of Havelok the Dane, too, mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                    Brede an chese, butere and milk,\r\n                    Pasties and flaunes.\r\n\r\nA ‘Roger le Flaoner’ comes in the London Corporation records, A.D. 1307,\r\nwhile much about the same time I find a ‘Walter le Flawner’ in the\r\nParliamentary writs.\r\n\r\nI have kept our ‘Panyers’ and ‘Panniers’ till the last, because there is\r\njust a shade of doubt as to whether they owe their name to the\r\nmanufacture of the basket so called or to the hawking of bread, the very\r\npractice of which custom, so familiar as it was then, has given us the\r\nterm. The original meaning of ‘pannier,’ the French ‘panier,’ was\r\nbread-basket, and the word seems to have acquired a peculiar prominence\r\nfrom the fact that in mediæval times bakers, through being the subjects\r\nof a careful supervision, were forbidden to sell their bread anywhere\r\nbut in the public market—nay, so particular were the authorities with\r\nregard to this that an officer was specially appointed to watch the\r\n‘hutches,’ boxes, or baskets in which the loaves were exposed. A surname\r\n‘Robert le Huchereve’ is even found in the Guildhall records as a relic\r\nof this. We can thus readily understand how hawkers of these portable\r\ncovers or baskets would acquire the sobriquet of ‘panyers.’ Certain it\r\nis we find such entries as ‘Simon le Pannier,’ ‘Robert le Pannere,’\r\n‘Amiscus Panarius,’ or ‘Geoffrey Panyman,’ while in another register the\r\noccupation of ‘panyere’ is distinctly mentioned. We can equally readily\r\nunderstand how from this the term itself would, in course of time,\r\nobtain a wider and more general sense. That it has done so the donkey’s\r\npanniers are a proof. It is, however, somewhat strange, when we reflect\r\nupon it, that perhaps the last thing we should expect to see borne in\r\nthis fashion in the present day would be that very article to which the\r\nreceptacle itself owed its name.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that while our directories possess many\r\nrecords of the early manufacture of and traffic in cheese, yet there are\r\nno names whatever in the present day, I believe, and barely any in the\r\npast, which are associated with the most important of all country\r\nproduce—butter.[373] The most satisfactory clue to the difficulty will\r\nbe to suppose that the cheese-merchant of that day, as often in the\r\npresent, dealt in both articles. This is the more likely, as the many\r\nsobriquets given to dealers in cheese in the fourteenth century would\r\nappear to give that edible, important as it was and is, a greater\r\nprominence than singly it deserved. Thus we find such names as ‘Edward\r\nle Cheseman’ or ‘Robert le Chesemaker,’ ‘John le Chesewright,’ or\r\n‘William le Cheswright,’ or ‘Alen le Chesmongere,’ as representatives of\r\nthe Saxons, figuring somewhat conspicuously in the registers of the\r\nperiod.[374] For the foreign element, too, cognomens were not wanting.\r\n‘Benedict’ or ‘Michael le Casiere’ may even now be living in our\r\n‘Cayzers,’ if they be not but another form of ‘Kaiser,’ and ‘Wilkin le\r\nFurmager’ or ‘William le Formager’ in our ‘Firmingers,’ is in no risk of\r\nimmediate oblivion. The majority of the Saxon forms, I need scarcely\r\nadd, are also thriving in our midst.\r\n\r\nIt may seem somewhat strange that ‘grocer,’ of all trades the most\r\nimportant, so far as the kitchen is concerned, should be so rarely\r\nrepresented in our nomenclature. But the reason is simple enough. To\r\nsell in the gross, or wholesale, was a second and later step in\r\ncommercial practice. A ‘John Guter, Grossarius,’ appears in the London\r\nCity Rolls so early as 1310, but it had scarcely become a familiar name\r\nof trade till the close of the fourteenth century.[375] In 1363 a\r\nstatute of Edward III. speaks concerning ‘Merchauntz nomez Grossers,’ so\r\ntermed because they ‘engrossent totes maners des marchandises\r\nvendables,’ and then enhanced the price on each separate article. Before\r\nthis they had been known as the Pepperers, or Spicers Guild, such names\r\nas ‘John le Espicer’ or ‘Nicholas le Espicer’ occurring not unfrequently\r\nat this period. Spice, indeed, was the then general term for all manner\r\nof drugs, aromatic and pungent, which were brought into England by\r\nforeign and especially Venetian merchants from the East. These were\r\ncarried up and down the country again by the itinerant traders, so many\r\nof whom I have already referred to in a previous chapter. An old song,\r\nwritten against the mendicant friars, relates that, among other of their\r\nvagaries—\r\n\r\n                       Many a dyvers spyse\r\n                       In bagges about they bear.\r\n\r\nAs I have just stated, however, the term ‘Grocer’ superseded that of\r\n‘Spicer,’ and as such seems to have confined its dealings to the\r\nmodernly received limit at an early date. As we must have already seen,\r\neach want had always hitherto been met by its own special dealer. With\r\nus now the Cutler would supply all the ‘Knifesmith’ and ‘Spooner’ then\r\nseparately furnished; while our ‘Ironmongers’ or ‘Hosiers’ or\r\n‘Upholdsters’ would each swallow up half-a-dozen of former occupations.\r\nThus it was here. Our ‘John le Saucers’ or ‘Ada la Saucers’ provided\r\nsalt pickle.[376] As with the ‘Frankelein,’ so with many another there—\r\n\r\n               Wo was his cook, but if his sauce were\r\n               Poinant and sharpe, and redy all his gear.\r\n\r\n‘Peter le Salter’ or ‘Hugh Saltman’ furnished forth the chloride itself;\r\n‘William le Mustarder’ or ‘Peter le Mustardman,’ or ‘Alice\r\nMustard-maker,’ the mustard; ‘Thomas le Pepperer,’[377] now spelt\r\n‘Pepper,’ the pepper; ‘Ralph le Soper’ or ‘Adam le Savonier,’ the soap.\r\nEach set before his customers’ eyes those peculiar articles of household\r\nconsumption their names severally represent. All these, having\r\nflourished in the earlier age, established for themselves a better place\r\nin our register than our rare ‘Grosers’ or ‘Grossers,’ who in this\r\nrespect only appeared in time to save themselves from oblivion, though\r\nthey have long ago revenged themselves on their humbler brethren by\r\nswallowing up entire the occupations they followed. It is curious to\r\nnote that in later days, through the various accessions of luxury, the\r\nresult in well-nigh every case of foreign discovery, even ‘Grocer’ has\r\nfailed to comprehend all. In our country villages we all but invariably\r\nfind added ‘and licensed dealer in tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, &c.’ In\r\nour towns, however, this addendum has been dropped, and a ‘grocer’s\r\nshop’ is the place we turn to, without thought of refusal, for these\r\nmodern introduced luxuries. What changes in our domestic resources are\r\nhere presented for our notice! In my previous chapter it was the\r\nover-abundance of certain rural and primitive surnames which told the\r\nstory of the times in which they sprang. The contrary is here the case.\r\nIt is in the absence of particular names, some of which I have already\r\nnoticed, we have the best guide to the extraordinary changes that have\r\ntaken place in our household economy. Look at our tea-table. Already in\r\nthe two short centuries from its introduction this article has given its\r\nname to a special meal, having thrown the once afternoon supper into a\r\nnocturnal repast. Even Shakespeare could only say—\r\n\r\n           Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep.[378]\r\n\r\nHow strangely would it have affected our nomenclature had this and other\r\nlike novelties been brought in earlier. We should have had ‘William le\r\nCoffyer’ giving us endless anxiety in the endeavour to separate it from\r\nthe actual ‘Godfrey le Coffrer.’ We should have had, too, such folk as\r\n‘John le Riceman,’ ‘Walter le Snuffer,’ ‘Ralph le Tobacconer,’ shortened\r\ninto ‘Bacconer,’ and the still more awkward ‘le Potatoman,’ almost as\r\ninconvenient as ‘Garlickmonger,’ though doubtless it would have been\r\nquickly curtailed into ‘Taterman’ or ‘Taterer’ or ‘Tatman’ and ‘Tatter,’\r\nand later on again into other forms too obscure to contemplate. The very\r\nrecounting of these changes, which are strictly on a par with other\r\nnames of a less hypothetical character, serve to impress us with the\r\ndifficulties we have to encounter in the task of deciphering many of our\r\nsurnames after the wear and tear they have undergone through lapsing\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBut I must not wander. The sale of vegetables and fruits left its mark\r\nin our former ‘John le Fruemongers’ and ‘Ralph le Frueters,’ and ‘Hugh\r\nle Fruters;’ ‘Richard le Graper’ testifying seemingly to a more specific\r\ndealing. Our ‘Butchers’ of course have been busy enough from the day\r\nthat the Normans brought them in. The variety of spelling which is found\r\nin olden records of this name is so great that I dare not attempt a\r\nlist, but I believe there still exist, _sans_ the article, such of the\r\nold forms as ‘le Bouchier,’ ‘le Bowcher,’ and ‘le Bowsher,’ while\r\n‘Botcher’ is at least not altered in sound from ‘le Bochere’ of the same\r\nperiod—‘Labouchere,’ which preserves this article, is of more modern\r\nintroduction from the Gallic shore. But the Norman was not without his\r\nrivals. Such names as ‘Walter le Fleshmongere,’ or ‘Eudo le\r\nFlesshemongere,’ or ‘Richard le Flesmongere,’[379] prove that the Saxon\r\ndid not give up even this branch of daily occupation without a struggle,\r\nand in the two isolated cases of ‘William Fleschour’ and ‘John\r\nFleshewer’ that I have lit upon we are reminded that Scotland, with its\r\nstill flourishing ‘flesher,’ is but the asylum where this truly Saxon\r\nterm found its latest retreat. Even yet in England with the country folk\r\nthe butchers’ shambles are the ‘flesh-market.’ That ‘Fleshmonger’ was\r\nthe colloquial term, we may prove from a list of tradesmen mentioned in\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ a poem I have already quoted several times;\r\nreference is there made to—\r\n\r\n                 Woolemen, vynterers and flesshemongers,\r\n                 Salters, jewelers, and haberdashers.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Pardoner,’ too, in the same poem, thus begins his roll—\r\n\r\n              Here is first Cocke Lorelle the Knyght,\r\n              And Symkyn Emery, mayntenaunce agaynz ryght;\r\n              With Slyngethryfte Fleshemonger.\r\n\r\nBut if not in the common mouth, yet in our rolls there were two other\r\nnames of this craft, which we must not pass over unrecorded. They were\r\nthose of ‘Carnifex’ and ‘Massacrer,’ both representing the\r\nslaughter-house, I doubt not. The existence of the former would lead us\r\nto suppose that the old Roman hangsman was settled in our midst, but it\r\nwas merely a mediæval Latinism for a butcher.[380] After the fashion of\r\nthe time nicknames were affixed upon everybody, and our ‘Butchers’ and\r\n‘Slaughters’ did not escape. The Hundred Rolls alone register the names\r\nof ‘Reginald Cullebol,’ ‘Henry Cullebulloc,’ ‘William Cullehare,’ and\r\n‘William Culle-hog,’ or in more modern parlance ‘Kill-bull,’\r\n‘Kill-bullock,’ Kill-hare,’ and ‘Kill-hog.’ The original and more\r\ncorrect ‘poulter,’ he who dealt in ‘poults’ or poultry, as we now term\r\nit, has bequeathed his name to our ‘Poulters’ and ‘Pulters.’ Such names\r\nas ‘Adam le Puleter,’ or ‘Bernard le Poleter,’ or ‘William le Pulter,’\r\nby the frequency with which we come across them, show how much did the\r\nfarmyard help to provide in these days for the supply of the\r\ndining-table.\r\n\r\n                         I have no peny,\r\n                         Poletes to bugge (buy),\r\n\r\nsays Langland, showing that in his time they were commonly exhibited for\r\nsale. Indeed, the fact that in the York Festival of 1415 the ‘bouchers’\r\nand ‘pulterers’ walked in procession together clearly proves their\r\nimportance at the period in which the surname arose.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the fishmonger, or what was practically the\r\nfishmonger, the fisherman, in our last chapter while surveying rural\r\noccupations. Our rare ‘Pessoners’[381] as representative of the Norman,\r\nand common ‘Fishers’ of the Saxon, lived in a day when under Roman\r\necclesiastic influences fish was of infinitely more importance than it\r\nis in this nineteenth century, when it is merely used as a go-between or\r\nmediator to soothe down the differences betwixt soup and beef. Then the\r\nyear was dotted with days of abstinence, or strongly indented with\r\nseasons like Lent. Among the higher circles it mattered but little. So\r\nmuch had the culinary art excelled in respect of fish that such periods\r\nas they came round only brought to the epicurean mind visions of\r\ngastronomic skill that put the sterner and weightier joints utterly in\r\nthe background for the time being. Pasties of herrings, congers, or\r\nlampreys were especially popular, and, judging from the lists of courses\r\ncontained in some of our records, that only one of our mediæval monarchs\r\nshould have succumbed to the latter is simply an historic marvel! Dishes\r\ntoo were prepared from the whale, the porpoise, the grampus, and the\r\nsea-wolf. ‘It is lamentable,’ says, facetiously, a writer in ‘Chambers’s\r\nBook of Days,’ referring to these viands as Lent repasts, ‘to think how\r\nmuch sin they thus occasioned among our forefathers, before they were\r\ndiscovered to be _mammalian_.’\r\n\r\nA curious name is found in the Hundred Rolls, that of ‘Symon\r\nHaryngbredere.’ In what particular way he carried on his occupation I do\r\nnot know. ‘Richard le Harenger’ is more explicable. Our ‘Conders’ were\r\npartners in the fishing excursions of the above. A full account of their\r\nduties may be found in Cowel’s ‘Interpreter,’ published in 1658. The\r\nconder stood upon the higher cliffs by the sea coast in the time of\r\nherring fishing, and with a staff or branch of a tree made signs to the\r\nboatmen which way the shoal was going. It seems there is a certain\r\ndiscoloured aspect of the water as they pass along, which is more\r\napparent from an elevation than from the level of the sea.[382] In\r\nmediæval times the plaice was a very favourite dish. The term it usually\r\nwent by was that of ‘but.’ Thus it is, I doubt not, we meet with such\r\nentries, as ‘William le Butor’ or ‘Hugh Butmonger.’ From some fancied\r\nresemblance to this fish, too, it would be that such humorous sobriquets\r\nas ‘Walter le But’ or ‘John le But’ would arise.\r\n\r\nBut while good and solid food could thus be purchased on every hand, we\r\nmust not forget drink, for our forefathers were great tipplers. I have\r\nalready mentioned our ‘William le Viners’ or ‘Roger le Vinours,’ in most\r\ncases, I doubt not, strictly cultivators of that plant on English soil.\r\nNone the less certain, however, is it that our many early ‘John le\r\nVineturs’ or ‘Alexander le Vineters’ were also, as merchants, employed\r\nin the importation of the varied wines of the Continent into our land.\r\nHow abundant and how diverse they were an old poem shall tell us—\r\n\r\n               Ye shall have Spayneshe wyne and Gascoyne,\r\n               Rose colure, whyt, claret, rampyon,\r\n               Tyre, capryck, and malvesyne,\r\n               Sak, raspyce, alycaunt, rumney,\r\n               Greke, ipocrase, new made clary,\r\n               Such as ye never had.\r\n\r\nThe entry ‘Adam le Wyneter’ reminds us that in all probability it is to\r\nour early wine-merchants also we owe our ‘Winters.’ ‘Walter le Brewers,’\r\nor ‘Emma le Brewsteres,’ or ‘Lawrence Beerbrewers,’[383] abound on every\r\nhand. We are reminded of the last by ‘Cocke Lorelle’—\r\n\r\n                 Chymney-swepers, and costerde-mongers,\r\n                 Lodemen and berebrewers.\r\n\r\nThe Norman equivalent for our ‘brewer’ was ‘bracer,’ and thus it is we\r\nmeet with such a name as ‘Stephen le Bracer’ or ‘Clarissa la\r\nBraceresse.’ Latinized forms are found in ‘Reginald Braciator’ or\r\n‘Letitia Braciatrix.’ Brewing was at first entirely in the hands of\r\nwomen. We have here ‘brewster,’ ‘braceress,’ and ‘braciatrix,’ and such\r\nphrases as ‘alewife’ and the obsolete ‘brewife’ (though it lingered on\r\ntill Shakespeare’s day) show the ale-making and ale-selling business to\r\nhave been mainly hers. ‘Malter’[384] and ‘Maltster’ or ‘Malster’ both\r\nexist, but the latter has ever denoted the avocation.[385] ‘Tapper’ and\r\n‘Tapster,’ too, are both occupants of our directories, but as a term of\r\nindustry the latter has ever held its own.[386] It is the same with\r\nseveral other occupations which we have already noticed. It is so with\r\n‘bread-baking,’ manifesting a woman’s work. As we have already seen, the\r\nfamiliar expression in olden times was ‘bakester,’ now represented by\r\nour ‘Baxters.’ It is so with weaving. Our nomenclature, as I have\r\npreviously shown, still preserves the ‘Webster’ and the ‘Kempster’ from\r\nbeing forgotten. In the winter evening, as the logfire crackled on the\r\nhearth, and while the good man was chopping wood, or tending his cattle,\r\nor mending his outdoor gear, who but his wife should be drawing woof and\r\nwarp in the chimney nook? Whose work but hers should this be to clothe\r\nwith her own thrifty fingers the backs of them who belonged to her? But,\r\nas with the others, her work in time became less a home occupation than\r\na public craft, and thus it got into the hands of the male creation.\r\nWhile ‘Spinner’ still flourishes as a surname, the feminine ‘spinster’\r\nnever obtained a place in our nomenclature.[387] This is no doubt to be\r\nattributed to that early position it took in regard to female\r\nrelationship, which it still holds. This would naturally prevent it from\r\nlosing its strictly feminine character.[388]\r\n\r\nA vintner went commonly by the name of a wine tunner, tunner itself\r\nbeing the ordinary term for one engaged in casking liquor. ‘Tun’ rather\r\nthan ‘barrel’ was in use. In the ‘Confessio Amantis’ it is said of\r\nJupiter that he—\r\n\r\n                     Hath in his cellar, as men say,\r\n                     Two townes full of lovedrink.\r\n\r\nThus have arisen such words as ‘tunnel’ or ‘tun-dish,’ the vessel with\r\nbroad rim and narrow neck, used for transferring the wine from cask to\r\nbottle. That our nomenclature should possess tokens of all this was\r\ninevitable. We find such names as ‘Edmund le Tonder’ (F.F.),[389]\r\n‘William Tunder’ (F.F.), ‘William le Toneleur’ (H.), ‘William le Tonier’\r\n(H.), ‘Richard le Tundur’ (T.), ‘Hugh le Tunder’ (A.), or ‘Ralph le\r\nToneler’ (A.) Till the close of the fifteenth century wine of\r\nhome-production was the common drink, for, though beer was not by any\r\nmeans unknown to us, it was not till the Flemings brought us the hop\r\nthat it became a familiar beverage. We all know the old couplet—\r\n\r\n                   Hops, Reformation, baize, and beer,\r\n                   Came into England all in one year.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this various bitter ingredients had been admixtured,\r\nchiefly, however, wormwood. ‘John de la Bruere’ or ‘William de Bruario’\r\nare the local surnames met with in early records.\r\n\r\nBut we have been wandering. The Mayor of York in 1273 was ‘John le\r\nEspicer, aut Apotecarius’[390] (so the record is put), and while the two\r\ntrades were distinct in character, there can be no doubt at the period\r\nreferred to there would be much in common between them. The one would\r\nsell certain spices and drugs as ingredients for dishes, while the other\r\ndisposed of the same for medicinal uses. Our ‘Potticarys,’ of course,\r\nrepresent the latter. The term itself, professionally speaking, is fast\r\nbecoming obsolete, having been forced into the background by our\r\n‘chemists’ and ‘druggists.’ But in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies it was the one name for all such. In the ‘Pardoner’s Tale’ the\r\nabbreviated form[391] is familiarly used—\r\n\r\n          And forth he goth, no longer would he tarry,\r\n          Into the town unto a Potecary,\r\n          And praied him that he him wolde sell\r\n          Some poison, that he might his ratouns (rats) quell.\r\n\r\nSuch men as ‘John le Chirurgien’ or ‘Thomas le Surigien’ are\r\noccasionally found, but through the fact of the craft being all but\r\nentirely in the hands of the barber, they are rare, and I do not see\r\nthat they have surnominally bequeathed us any descendants. Even so late\r\nas the reign of Elizabeth this connection seems to have commonly\r\nexisted. In the orders and rules for an academy for her wards the\r\nfollowing passage occurs with respect to the teaching of medicine:—‘The\r\nPhisition shall practize to reade Chirurgerie, because, thorough wante\r\nof learning therein, we have verie few good Chirurgions, yf any at all,\r\nby reason that Chirurgerie is not now to be learned in any other place\r\nthan in a Barbor’s shoppe. And in that shoppe most dawngerous,\r\nespecially in time of plague, when the ordinary trimming of men for\r\nclenlynes must be done by those which have to do with infected\r\npersonnes.’[392] That ‘Thomas Blodlettere’ and ‘William Blodlettere’\r\nshould be conspicuous by their absence in modern rolls is not\r\nsurprising. Their former existence, however, reminds us how in the past\r\nthe fleshy arms of our forefathers were constantly exposed to this once\r\nthought panacea for all physical ills. It has long ceased, however, to\r\nbe the resortment it was, and science, by taking it out of the tonsor’s\r\nhands, has left it to the wiser discretion of a more cultivated and\r\nstrictly professional class. We have no traces of the dentist, as he too\r\nwas absorbed in the barbitonsorial craft. Some lines, quoted by Mr.\r\nHotten in his interesting book on ‘Signboards,’ remind us of this—\r\n\r\n              His pole with pewter basons hung,\r\n              Black, rotten teeth in order strung,\r\n              Rang’d cups that in the window stood,\r\n              Lined with red rags to look like blood,\r\n              Did well his threefold trade explain,\r\n              Who shaved, drew teeth, and breathed a vein.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we see one more explanation of the plentifulness of our\r\n‘Barbers,’ ‘Barbours,’ ‘Barbors,’ and more uncouth-seeming ‘Barbars.’\r\nThe old records give us an equal or even greater variety in such\r\nregistrations as ‘John le Barber,’ ‘Richard le Barbour,’ ‘Nicholas le\r\nBarbur,’ ‘Thomas le Barbitonsor,’ or ‘Ralph Tonsor;’[393] while feminine\r\nskill in operating upon the chins of our forefathers is commemorated in\r\nsuch an entry as ‘Matilda la Barbaresse.’ It is just possible, however,\r\nthat she kept an apprentice, although such things are still to be seen,\r\nI believe, as women-shavers. But the one chief sobriquet for the medical\r\ncraft, and the one which, excepting our ‘Barbers,’ has made the deepest\r\nindenture upon our nomenclature, was that of ‘Leech’—_was_, I say, for\r\nsaving in our cow-leeches it is now, professionally speaking, obsolete.\r\nIn our many ‘Leeches,’ ‘Leaches,’ and ‘Leachmans,’ however, its\r\nreputation is not likely soon to be forgotten. With the country folk it\r\nwas the one familiar term in use. Langland, while speaking of—\r\n\r\n                         One frere Flaterie,\r\n                         Physicien and surgien,\r\n\r\nmakes mention also of—\r\n\r\n                    Conscience called a Leche\r\n                    That could well shryve,\r\n                    To go salve those that sike ben,\r\n                    And through synne y-wounded.\r\n\r\n‘Le Leche’ is the general spelling of earlier times, and it is that of\r\nthe lines just quoted.[394] The Hundred Rolls furnish us with a ‘Hugh le\r\nLeche,’ while ‘Robert le Leche’ figures in the Parliamentary Writs.\r\n\r\nHaving just referred to the barber, we may here introduce an obsolete\r\nsurname somewhat connected with his craft, that of ‘le Loveloker.’ In\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the lovelock was as familiar as\r\nthe chignon is in the nineteenth, only that the former was worn alike by\r\nmen and women. They wore curls or plaits of hair, oftentimes adorned\r\nwith bows or ribbons, and hung in front of the ear and about the\r\ntemples. If false, the hair was fastened by means of adhesive plaster.\r\nIn the ‘Affectionate Shepherd’ it is thus alluded to—\r\n\r\n          Why should thy sweete love-locke hang dangling downe,\r\n            Kissing thy girdle-stud with falling pride?\r\n          Although thy skin be white, thy hair is browne;\r\n            Oh let not then thy haire thy beautie hide.\r\n\r\nHow long this custom existed, and how commonly the exquisites of the\r\nperiod wore these pendants, we may judge by the fact of a ‘Walter le\r\nLoveloker’ occurring in the Hundred Rolls of the fourteenth century.\r\nProbably he added to this the craft of peruke-maker, and between the\r\ntwo, I doubt not, throve and grew fat—for wigs too were an early\r\ninstitution. The surname of occupation has been long obsolete, but the\r\nsimpler ‘Lovelock’ is firmly set in our registers.\r\n\r\nIn a day when the luxury of gas was unknown, and the hearth, burning\r\nmore generally with wood than coal, would throw but a chequered light\r\nathwart the room, we ought not to be surprised to find the chandlery\r\nbusiness to be somewhat demonstrative, and so it is. In such a name as\r\n‘Michel le Oyneter’ or ‘Hointer,’ we are reminded of the old melter of\r\ngrease, and of the equally old English term ‘to oint,’ for to ‘anoint.’\r\nWith him, therefore, we may associate such of his confrères as ‘William\r\nle Candelmaker,’ ‘Roger le Chaundeler,’ ‘Richard le Chaundler,’ ‘William\r\nle Candeler,’[395] or ‘Thomas le Candleman,’ names all in existence\r\nformerly, some of which still abide with us. In ‘William le Cirgier’ we\r\nare once more reminded of the earlier religious rites of our Church and\r\nits many vigils, from a performance of which he who dealt in wax tapers,\r\nor _cierges_, as they were then styled, would derive no doubt a steady\r\ngain. In the ‘Romance of the Rose’ we are told—\r\n\r\n                The nine thousand maidens dere,\r\n                That beren in Heaven their cierges clere,\r\n                Of which men rede in church and sing,\r\n                Were take in secular clothing.\r\n\r\nWith these latter then it is we must associate such a name as ‘John\r\nWexmaker.’\r\n\r\nWhile, however, we are dwelling upon such and similar wants in the\r\ndomestic consumption, we are naturally led to make inquiry concerning\r\nthe utensils in fashion at this period, and of those who provided them.\r\nOf drinking vessels we have many, for, as we have previously hinted,\r\nthis was a decidedly drinking age. Chief of all was the ‘Mazerer.’ No\r\nword could be in more familiar use in the day we are speaking of than\r\nthe ‘macer’ or ‘maslin,’ carved from the maple. It was the favourite\r\nbowl of all classes of society. By the rich it was valued according as\r\nit was made from the knotted grain, or chased and rimmed with gold and\r\nsilver and precious gems. We are told of Sire Thopas how that—\r\n\r\n                  They fetched him first the swete win,\r\n                  And made eke in a maselin,\r\n                          And real spicerie.\r\n\r\nThere is scarce a record of any magnitude or importance which has not\r\nits several surnames derived from the occupation of carving this cup,\r\nand as the term itself was variously pronounced and spelt, so did the\r\nname vary. For instances the Hundred Rolls give us ‘Adam le Mazerer;’\r\nthe Close Rolls, ‘William le Macerer;’ the Warranty Rolls, ‘William le\r\nMazeliner;’ and the London Records give us again a ‘John le Mazerer.’\r\nBesides these we have ‘Mazelyn,’ ‘Maselyn,’ and ‘Mazarin,’ probably\r\nsign-names, the latter familiarised to us in the celebrated Cardinal of\r\nthat name. Strange to say, ‘Maslin’ and ‘Masser,’ or ‘Macer,’ all rare,\r\nare now the only relics we possess of this once well-known surname and\r\noccupation. No instance I can furnish more clearly demonstrates the\r\nuncertainty of descent in our personal nomenclature. Such a name as\r\n‘Geoffrey le Hanaper’ or ‘William Hampermaker’ bequeaths us a strange\r\nstory of changed circumstance. The shorter appellation, common enough at\r\nthis time, still lives in our ‘Hampers.’ While the macer was invariably\r\nof maple, the ‘hanap,’ or two-handed goblet, might be of wood or metal.\r\nFrom the fact of a ‘hanaper,’ Latinized in our archives into\r\n‘hanaperium,’ being the crate where these hanaps were kept, it acquired\r\na secondary sense of a repository for things of a more general\r\ncharacter. Thus has arisen the ‘Hanaper Office’[396] in Chancery, where\r\nwrits were treasured up in a basket; and thus also it is that we now\r\ntalk of a ‘hamper,’ a term so delightfully familiar to schoolboys about\r\nChristmas time. Our common ‘Bowlers’ represent such olden personages as\r\n‘Robert le Bollere’ or ‘Adam le Boloure,’ they who made the cheap wooden\r\n‘bowl’ or ‘boll.’ The old spelling still survives botanically in such a\r\nphrase as we find in the Authorized Version, where it speaks of the\r\n‘flax being bolled,’ that is, the seed vessel was forming. It is always\r\nso spelt with our mediæval writers. Thus Glutton, in the ‘Plowman’s\r\nVision,’ after sleeping away his last drunken bout, wakes, and—\r\n\r\n                     The firste worde that he warpe\r\n                     Was, ‘Were is the bolle?’\r\n\r\n‘William le Cuppere’ and ‘Richard le Kuppere,’ while engaged in the same\r\noccupation, are, speaking surnominally, absorbed, I doubt not, by our\r\n‘Coopers’ and ‘Cowpers.’ ‘Copper’ may be but another antique form of the\r\nsame. Langland speaks of—\r\n\r\n                          Coupes of clere gold\r\n                          And coppes of silver.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion almost immediately to mention Chaucer, as speaking\r\nof ‘turning cups,’ which would seem to infer that they too were often\r\nmade of wood.\r\n\r\nAnother name once existing was that of ‘Doubler,’ a maker or seller of\r\nthe ‘doubler’ or ‘dobeler,’ or dish; a term derived from the French\r\n‘doublier.’ The word is still in use in the North of England,[397] and\r\nboth ‘Doubler’ and ‘Doubleman’ are in our directories of to-day. The\r\nname of ‘Scutelaire’ must be set here also, though when we think of our\r\nmodern coalscuttle we might imagine it somewhat of an interloper. A\r\nchange, however, has come over the stricter meaning of the word. A\r\n‘scutel’ was formerly nothing more nor less than a wooden or metallic\r\ndish or platter used on our early dressoirs for culinary purposes. It\r\nseems ever to have had its place in the dining-hall, for in the\r\nhousehold expenses of Bishop Swinfield (Camden Soc.) we find the entry,\r\n‘xv. scutellis, xvii. salsariis.’ The learned editor of this book,\r\ncommenting upon this passage, says, ‘“scutella” is a word of somewhat\r\nextensive application to dishes or platters, saucers or salvers, and it\r\nis retained in our present English “scuttle.”’ I doubt not with him that\r\nwhile ‘scutum,’ a shield, is the root, the term is here intended to\r\nrefer to the large flat spoons or plates used for the sauce-dishes. It\r\nis from his resemblance to these that some wide-mouthed country bumpkin\r\nis set down in the Hundred Rolls as ‘Arnold Scutelmuth,’ while the\r\noccupation of making them finds its memorial in the Rolls of Parliament\r\nin such a sobriquet as ‘James le Scutelaire.’ Speaking, however, of the\r\ndining table, we may here mention the cutler. Of such a name as ‘Henry\r\nKnyfesmythe’ I have already had occasion to hint. The cutler enjoyed, or\r\nperhaps I ought to say was the victim of, a very uncertain orthography\r\nin mediæval times, and some of the forms found are extremely curious. I\r\nmay cite such personages as ‘Richard le Cutyler,’ ‘John le Cotiler,’\r\n‘Peter le Cotyler,’ ‘Henry le Coteler,’ or ‘Solomon le Cotiller’ as\r\nrepresentative of those which were then most in vogue. All are now\r\ncontent, it would seem, to be absorbed in the simple ‘Cutler.’ Strange\r\nto say, I cannot find a single ancestor of our familiar ‘Spooner.’ A\r\nmediæval rhymester, however, speaks of ‘sponers, turners, and hatters.’\r\nWith many of these names I have just mentioned the ironmonger would have\r\nmuch to do. The uncertain form of the term used for this material gave\r\nrise to three familiar words, those of ‘iron,’ ‘ise,’ or ‘ire.’ Trevisa\r\nspeaks of England as being plenteous in ‘veynes of metayls, of bras, of\r\nyre, of leed, of tyn, of selver.’[398] Thus while ‘Henry le Ironmonger’\r\ndealt, as no one of my readers will doubt, in vessels and utensils of\r\nthe material his name suggests, it is not to be supposed that ‘Geoffrey\r\nle Iremonger’ or ‘William le Irremongere’ was but a cant nickname for\r\none of splenetic temperament; or that in ‘Isabel le Isemonger’ or ‘Agnes\r\nla Ismongere’ we have traces of any disposition for those frozen creams\r\nwhich in the hot summer time we of the nineteenth century are so glad to\r\nseek on the confectioner’s counter. All alike were hardware\r\nmanufacturers. The present forms are ‘Iremonger,’ ‘Irmonger,’ and\r\n‘Ironmonger.’\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that wood should hold such a conspicuous position in\r\nwork of a culinary nature, but it is with good reason. We must remember\r\nall our ornamental fictile vessels were unknown to our forefathers. It\r\nwas not till the close of the sixteenth century they came into any\r\nsettled use. It is to this circumstance we must doubtless refer the\r\nextraordinary prevalence of our ‘Turners.’ Not the least important\r\narticles of their workmanship would be the vessels they turned off from\r\nthe lathe. That Jack-of-all-trades, the Miller of Trumpington, could,\r\naccording to Chaucer, amongst his many other achievements, ‘turn\r\ncuppes.’[399] When wood, however, was not used, the utensils were of the\r\nroughest character—mugs, jars, and such like vessels, formed of the\r\ncommon baked and glazed clay, and reserved for the ruder requirements of\r\nthe household. Our ‘Stephen le Crockers’ and ‘John le Crokers’ (P.\r\nW.)—for both forms then as now are found—made simply the glazed crock,\r\nor ‘crouke,’ as Chaucer has it, used for holding butter or milk or such\r\nlike store—vessels, in fact, reserved for the scullery or the pantry\r\nrather than the parlour or hall. John de Trevisa, writing in 1387, says\r\nin his description of Britain: ‘There is also white clay, and red for to\r\nmake of crokkes, and steenes (stone jars) and other vessels.’ The same\r\nmay be said of our ‘Jarmans.’ Most of our domestic utensils, therefore,\r\nif not of wood or clay, were made of metal, and this generally of a\r\nmixed kind. ‘Henry le Brasour’ or ‘Robert le Brazur,’ now ‘Brazier’ or\r\n‘Brasher,’ worked in brass; ‘Thomas le Latoner,’ or ‘William le\r\nLatoner,’ in latten or bronze;[400] while a mixture of lead and tin\r\nfully employed the wits and hands of our ‘Pewters,’ ‘Pewtrers,’ and\r\n‘Founders.’[401] We must not suppose therefore, that ‘John le Discher’\r\nor ‘Robert le Disshere’ (with their once feminine partner, ‘Margaret la\r\nDisheress’), and ‘Ranulf le Poter’ or ‘Adam le Potter’ or ‘Thomas\r\nPotman,’[402] laboured after the modern style. The ‘disher’ all but\r\ninvariably worked in pewter,[403] and the ‘potter,’ if not in the same,\r\ncould only resort to common clay as an alternative. ‘Calisher’ is\r\nprobably the old ‘le Calicer’ or ‘Chalicer.’ The more modern spelling is\r\nfound in the London Records, in 1310, where mention is made of ‘Ralph de\r\nChichestre, Chalicer.’ The ‘chalice’ has now, however, allied itself so\r\nentirely with the sacramental office of our Church that it is hard to\r\nregard it in the light of an ordinary utensil. As a trade-sign a chalice\r\nwould be readily conspicuous, and to this we owe, no doubt, our\r\n‘Challis’s’ and ‘Challices.’\r\n\r\nWhile speaking, however, of drinking vessels, I must perforce allude to\r\nthe horner. I need not remind my reader how many are the descendants of\r\nsuch a man as ‘Richard le Horner’ or ‘John le Horner,’ but it may not\r\nequally have struck him how all-important would be his trade at such a\r\nperiod as this. That his chief manufacture was that of the musical horn\r\nI cannot doubt, so used as it was officially or ordinarily, at fair and\r\nfestival, at dance and revelry, in time of peace and in time of war. The\r\n‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ describes it as ‘hornare, or horne-maker.’\r\nStill this would not be all—far from it. Windows were commonly made of\r\nthis material, frames were constructed of it, the child’s horn-book\r\nbeing but a memory of this; lanterns were formed of it, cups of all\r\nsizes were fashioned from it, chessmen were manufactured out of it. In\r\nthe ‘Franklin’s Tale’ descriptive of Winter it is said—\r\n\r\n                Janus sits by the fire with double berd,\r\n                And drinketh of his bugle-horn the wine.\r\n\r\nAs a sign-name ‘at the horn’ would be a common expression, and certainly\r\nwe have had plenty of ‘Horns,’ if not the ‘horn of plenty,’ at all times\r\nduring the last six hundred years.\r\n\r\nTurning for a moment to vessels of a more general character, our\r\n‘Coopers’ or ‘Cowpers’[404] or ‘Coupers’ have ever flourished\r\nextensively. Such forms as ‘Thomas le Cuper,’ ‘Warin le Couper,’ or\r\n‘Richard le Cupare’ are found on every side; while even such entries as\r\n‘Richard Cowpeman’ or ‘Roger Cowperese’ may be occasionally alighted\r\nupon. The term ‘coop’ is not in itself in common use now—indeed, saving\r\nin composition, as in _hencoop_, for instance, it is all but obsolete.\r\nThe Norman and more correct ‘cuve’ gave us such early names as ‘Ralph le\r\nCuver’ or ‘John le Cover,’ or ‘Adam le Covreur’ or ‘Robert le Coverur,’\r\nthe latter being one more example of a reduplicated termination.[405]\r\nOur modern ‘Covers,’ however, preserve the earlier and more simple form.\r\nOur ‘Cadmans,’ once written ‘Cademans,’ framed the cade or barrel, the\r\nsign-name of which gave us the notorious Jack Cade of early\r\ninsurrectionary times. Shakespeare facetiously suggests a different\r\norigin when he makes Dick the butcher to insinuate that it was for—\r\n\r\n                       Stealing a cade of herring.\r\n\r\nIn either case the same word is used, and the derivation in no way\r\nimpeached. Our ‘Barrells’ are either sign-names also, or but corruptions\r\nof such an old entry as ‘Stephen le Bariller.’ ‘Alexander le Hopere’ and\r\n‘Andrew le Hopere,’ now ‘Hooper,’ explain themselves.[406] Doubtless\r\nthey would be busy enough at this time in strengthening these several\r\nbarrels, cuves, coops, and cades with pliant bands, whether of wood or\r\nmetal. Speaking, however, of wooden bands, reminds us of our ‘Leapers,’\r\n‘Leapmans,’ and ‘Lipmans.’ A ‘leap’ was a basket of flexible, but\r\nstrong, materials, its occurrence in our old writers being so frequent\r\nas to need no example.[407] The ‘maund’ was similar in character, but\r\nmade of more pliant bands, probably of rushes, for we find it in common\r\nuse by our early fishermen. Our ‘Maunders’ and ‘Manders’ are, I think,\r\nto be set here, therefore, either as manufacturers or as wayside\r\nbeggars, who bore them as the receptacles of the doles they got. Another\r\nsupposition is that they were beggars who acquired the sobriquet because\r\nthey maundered out their petition for alms. I cannot but think the\r\nformer is the more likely derivation, our Maundy Thursday itself having\r\ngot its name from the practice of doling out the gifts for the poor from\r\nthe basket then so named.\r\n\r\nBut we have not even yet completed our list of surnames derivable from\r\nmanufactures of this class. Our ‘Coffers’ represent seemingly the same\r\nword in a twofold capacity. We find occasional records where the\r\ncofferer was undoubtedly an official servant, a treasurer, one who\r\ncarried the money of his lord in his journeys up and down.[408] More\r\noften, however, he was a tradesman, a maker or dealer in coffers or\r\ncoffins, the two words being once used altogether indiscriminately.[409]\r\nMany of my readers who are familiar with Greek will recognise the more\r\nliteral translation and meaning of the word in Wicklyffe’s rendering of\r\nMark vi. 43. ‘And they token the relyves of broken mete, twelve coffyns\r\nfull.’ Lacking any other name to represent the undertaker’s business, I\r\ndoubt not our early ‘William le Cofferers’ and ‘Godfrey le Coffrers’\r\nwere quite able and willing to furnish forth this portion of the funeral\r\noutfit. These early surnames, then, must be set beside our already\r\nexplained ‘Arkwrights,’ while, as sign-names, our ‘Coffins’ and\r\n‘Coffers’ (supposing the latter not to be a curter form of ‘Coffrer’)\r\nwill be as readily recognisable.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, wood, clay, and the various cheaper metals were thus\r\nbrought into requisition to provide the utensils of the household and\r\nthe means of carriage, we must not forget that leather, too, had its\r\nuses in these respects. It is this lets us into the secret of the\r\nnumerosity of our ‘Butlers.’ Important as undoubtedly was the ‘Boteler’\r\nto the feudal residence, that fact alone would scarcely account for the\r\nlarge number of ‘le Botillers’ or ‘le Botelers’ we find in every\r\nconsiderable roll. The fact is, the name was both official and\r\noccupative. Of this there can be no doubt. In the York Pageant of 1415\r\nwe find walking in procession together with the ‘Pouchmakers’ the\r\n‘Botillers’ and the ‘Cap-makers,’ all obviously engaged in the leather\r\nmanufacture. The phrase ‘like finding a needle in a bottle of hay’ still\r\npreserves the idea of a bottle as understood by our forefathers four\r\nhundred years ago—that of a leathern case, whether for holding liquid or\r\nsolids.[410] The hay-bottle was doubtless the bag that hung at the\r\ngirth, from which, as is still the case, the driver baited his horse.\r\nBottles for liquids were commonly of leather. The ‘black-jack’ was\r\nalways such. It is of this an old ballad sings—\r\n\r\n              Then when this bottle doth grow old,\r\n              And will no longer good liquor hold,\r\n              Out of its side you may take a clout,\r\n              Will mend your shoes when they are worn out.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the ‘Botiller’ was, after all, in some cases but\r\nidentical with the old pouch-maker, represented in our old rolls by such\r\nfolk as ‘Henry Poucher’ or ‘Agnes Pouchmaker.’ Another and more Norman\r\nterm for this latter was that of ‘Burser’ or ‘Purser,’ though in later\r\ndays both forms have come to occupy a more official position. Such names\r\nas ‘Alard le Burser’ or ‘Robert le Pursere’ are of frequent occurrence.\r\nNor, again, while speaking of leather, can we omit a reference to the\r\nold ‘Henry Male-maker,’ who made up travelling bags. ‘Cocke Lorelle’\r\nmentions—\r\n\r\n                Masones, male-makers, and merbelers,\r\n                Tylers, brycke-leyers, and harde-hewers.\r\n\r\nThe modern postal _mail_ has but extended its earlier use. We may\r\nremember in the ‘Canterbury Tales’ so pleased were the company at the\r\nend of the first story, that the host said—\r\n\r\n                            Unbuckled is the male,\r\n                Let see now who shall tell another tale,\r\n                For trewely this game is wel begun.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that many of these baskets and boxes would\r\nrequire cordage then as now. Piers Plowman mentions ‘Robyn the Ropere,’\r\nand both name and occupation are still familiar amongst us. In the\r\nFabric Roll of York Minster is mentioned a ‘William Raper,’ 1446; and\r\nagain in 1457, under the head of ‘Custos canabi,’ one ‘Thomas Kylwake,\r\nrapor.’ Both forms are equally common in our directories. As\r\nrepresentative of the more technical part of the industry we may cite\r\n‘Thomas le Winder’ and ‘Richard le Windere,’ whose progeny still dwell\r\namong us. ‘Adam le Corder’ or ‘Peter le Corder,’ or ‘George le Stringer’\r\nor ‘Thomas Strengfellowe,’ carry us back to names of the commonest\r\nimport in the fourteenth century. The—\r\n\r\n                   Lanterners, stryngers, and grynders\r\n\r\nare set together by an old rhymer. But I have already said something\r\nabout them in connection with our ‘Bowyers’ and ‘Fletchers,’ so I will\r\npass on.\r\n\r\nThere are but few traces in our nomenclature of more delicate\r\nworkmanship. Much of our jewellery came from abroad. Most of that\r\nfashioned in England was under the skilled eye of the Jew. Still ‘Robert\r\nle Goldbeter’ or ‘Henry le Goldsmith’ is not an uncommon entry at this\r\ntime. The Norman equivalent was met by such a name as ‘Roger le Orfevre’\r\nor ‘Peter le Orfeure,’ and these lingered on in a more or less full form\r\ntill the seventeenth century. Their memorial, too, still survives in our\r\n‘Offers’ and ‘Offors.’[411] Ivory was much used, too, and our ‘Turners’\r\nhere also were doubtless very busy. A pretty little casket of this\r\nmaterial, called a ‘forcer,’ small and delicately carved, used in\r\ngeneral for storing away jewellery and other precious gems, was\r\ndecidedly popular among the richer ranks of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries. In an old poem, sometimes set down to Chaucer, it\r\nis said—\r\n\r\n              Fortune by strength the forcer hath unshete,\r\n              Wherein was sperde all my worldly richesse.\r\n\r\nOur present ‘Forcers’ and early ‘Nicholas le Forcers’ and ‘Henry le\r\nForcers’ represent this. Our use of ivory tablets is not yet obsolete,\r\nthough of late years the wondrous cheapness of paper and the issue of\r\npocketbooks and annuals have threatened to absorb their existence. Of\r\nsomewhat larger size were the ‘tables’ of this time. Chaucer, in\r\nportraying the Limitour, speaks of him as followed by an attendant,\r\nbearing—\r\n\r\n                 A pair of tables all of ivory,\r\n                 And a pointel, ypolished fetisly,\r\n                 And wrote alway the names, as he stood,\r\n                 Of alle folk that gave them any good.\r\n\r\nIt is in a yet larger sense of this same word our early translators\r\nintroduced the phrase ‘tables of stone,’ found in the Mosaic record—not,\r\nhowever, that the smaller ‘tablet’ was unknown. Apart from such a\r\nregistration as ‘Bartholomew le Tabler,’ found in the London Rolls\r\n(1320), we have mentioned as living in Cambridge in 1322 one ‘Richard le\r\nTableter.’[412] We can readily understand how useful would be his\r\noccupation to the students, who were thus provided with a writing\r\nmaterial capable of erasure, at a time when paper was infinitely too\r\nexpensive to be simply scribbled upon.[413] The pointel, or pencil,\r\nmentioned above, seems to have required also a separate manufacture, as\r\nwe find the surnames ‘Roger Poyntel’ and ‘John Poyntel’ occurring in\r\n1315 and 1319, the latter the same date within a year as the ‘Tabler’\r\njust referred to. These tablets, I need not say, were, whether the\r\nframework were ivory, or box, or cyprus, overlaid with smeared wax, the\r\npointel being, as its name more literally implies, the stile with which\r\nthe characters were impressed. The pointel was a common ornament and\r\nhung pendent from the neck.\r\n\r\nTwo surnames far from being uninteresting must be mentioned here. They\r\nare those of ‘Walter Orlogyr’[414] and ‘Thomas Clokmaker,’ the one being\r\nfound in the ‘Guild of St. George, Norwich’ (1385), the other in the\r\n‘Proceedings and Ordinances of the Privy Council.’[415] It is just\r\npossible also that ‘Clerkwright,’ set down in the former record, may be\r\nbut a misspelling or misreading for ‘Clockwright.’ The two\r\nfirst-mentioned names remind us that if not of clocks, as now\r\nunderstood, yet the manufacture of dials did make a transient mark upon\r\nour English nomenclature. I say transient, for I find no trace of either\r\nbeing handed down even to the second generation by those who took these\r\nsobriquets. The ‘horologe’ seems to have become a pretty familiar term\r\nin the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, for we find Wicklyffe\r\ntranslating 2 Kings xx. 11, ‘Isaye the profete clepide ynwardly the\r\nLord, and browgte agen bacward by x degrees the schadewe bi lynes, bi\r\nwhiche it hadde gone down thanne in the orologie of Achaz.’ The\r\ntransition from clocks to bells is not a great one, as both have to do\r\nwith the marking of time. I will here therefore refer to the old\r\nbellfounder, and then pass on. The ‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ gives us\r\n‘Bellezeter’ as the then usual term for the trade, and from the\r\noccurrence of such entries as ‘Robert le Belzetere’ or ‘William le\r\nBelzetere’ we cannot doubt but that it was so. Of course a corruption of\r\nso awkward a word was inevitable, and Stow, by informing us that\r\n‘Billiter Lane’ was formerly nothing more nor less than ‘Belzetars\r\nLane,’ has prevented dispute from arising regarding the origin of our\r\n‘Billiters.’[416] If, however, further proof were necessary, we could\r\nbring forward ‘Esmon Belleyeter’ from the Privy Council Ordinances.[417]\r\nStripped of its uncouth orthography, we are here shown the process by\r\nwhich the changed pronunciation gradually came into use.\r\n\r\nWe must say a word or two about former coinage, and weights and\r\nmeasures, for all are more or less carefully memorialized in our\r\ndirectories of to-day. The two chief names, however, by which the early\r\nscale was represented, ‘le Aunserer’ and ‘le Balancer,’ are, I am sorry\r\nto say, either wholly, or all but wholly, extinct. Such entries as ‘Rauf\r\nle Balancer’[418] or ‘John Balauncer’ or ‘Thomas le Aunseremaker’ were\r\nperfectly familiar with our forefathers. The ‘balance’ was of the\r\nsimplest character, a scale poised by the hand. The manufacture of such\r\nis mentioned by the author of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ when he includes—\r\n\r\n               Arowe-heders, maltemen, and cornemongers,\r\n               _Balancers_, tynne-casters, and skryveners.\r\n\r\nBy its repeated occurrence in our present Authorized Version this word\r\nis sure of preservation from obsoletism. The ‘auncel’ or ‘auncer’ was\r\nstrictly the vessel in which the provisions were weighed. Piers Plowman\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n                     And the pound that she paied by\r\n                     Peised a quatron moore\r\n                     Than myn owene auncer.\r\n\r\nIn an appraisement of goods in 1356 mention is made, among other\r\nchattels, of ‘one balance called an auncer.’[419] Thus our somewhat rare\r\n‘Ansers’ are not such _geese_ as they look! Our modern notion of the\r\nMint is that of a place where with a certain amount of State secrecy our\r\nmoney is coined and sent forth. Nothing of this kind existed formerly:\r\neach considerable town had its own mint, and even barons and bishops,\r\nsubject to royal superintendence, could issue coin. Thus it is that we\r\nmeet with more or less frequency such a name as ‘Nicholas le Cuner,’\r\nfrom the old ‘cune’ or ‘coin;’ or ‘John le Meneter,’ or ‘John\r\nMonemakere,’ or ‘William le Moneur,’ or ‘William le Mynsmith,’\r\nmint-smith, that is; and thus it is our present ‘Moniers’ or ‘Moneyers’\r\nand ‘Minters’ have arisen. Our ‘Stampers’ remind us of the chief feature\r\nof coinage, the die. The system being thus general, and subject to but\r\nan uncertain and irregular supervision, abuse of alloy crept in, and it\r\nwas to remedy this, it is said, our ‘Testers’ and ‘Sayers,’ corrupted\r\nfrom assayers, were appointed. ‘Sayer’ or ‘Sayers,’ however, I have\r\nelsewhere derived differently, and in most cases I feel confident the\r\naccount there given is more approximate to the truth.\r\n\r\nLiterature and art in regard to the market are not without their relics.\r\nSo far as the outside of books was concerned, our former ‘John le\r\nBokbinders’ or ‘Dionisia le Bokebynders’ are sufficiently explicit.\r\nThese, judging from their date, we must suppose to have bound together\r\nleathern documents and parchments of value, or books of manuscript.\r\nSpeaking of parchment, however, we are reminded of the importance of\r\nthis for testamentary and other legal purposes. Thus we find such names\r\nas ‘Stephen le Parchemyner’ or ‘William le Parchemynere’ to be common at\r\nthis time. They afford but one more instance of an important and\r\nfamiliar name failing of descent. In the York Pageant, mentioned\r\nelsewhere, the ‘Parchemyners’[420] and ‘Bukbynders’ marched\r\ntogether.[421]\r\n\r\nThe old sealmaker, an important tradesman in a day when men were much\r\nbetter known by their crests than now, left its mark in the early\r\n‘Seler.’ In the ‘Issues of the Exchequer’ we find a certain ‘Hugh le\r\nSeler’ commissioned to make a new seal for the See of Durham. The modern\r\nform is ‘Sealer.’ Professional writers and copiers were common. The\r\ncalling of scribe has given us our many ‘Scrivens’ and ‘Scriveners,’\r\ndescendants of the numerous ‘William le Scrivayns’ and ‘John le\r\nScrivryns’ of our mediæval rolls. Piers Plowman employs the word—\r\n\r\n                  I wel noght scorne, quoth Scripture,\r\n                  But if scryveynes lye.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Writers’ are but the Saxon form of the same, while ‘le Cirograffer’\r\nwould seem to represent the Greek. A ‘William le Cirograffer’ occurs in\r\nthe Hundred Rolls. As a writer of indentures he is frequently mentioned.\r\nAn act passed in the first year of Edward IV. speaks of such officers as\r\n‘clerk of our council, clerk or keeper of oure Hanaper, office of\r\ncirograffer, and keeper of oure Wills.’[422] Employed in the skilled art\r\nof text-letter we may next mention such men as ‘Godfrey le Lomynour’ or\r\n‘Ralph Illuminator’ or ‘Thomas Liminer.’ A poem, already quoted more\r\nthan once, makes reference to—\r\n\r\n               Parchemente makers, skynners, and plowers,\r\n               Barbers, Boke-bynders, and lyminers.[423]\r\n\r\nHow beautiful were the decorations and devices upon which they spent\r\ntheir care, some of the missals and other service books of this early\r\nperiod show.[424] This, I need scarcely add, was a favourite monastic\r\npursuit. I do not know that ‘Limner’ still exists as a surname, unless\r\nit be in our ‘Limmers.’ That it lingered on in its more correct form\r\ntill the beginning of the eighteenth century is certain, as the Tostock\r\nregister serves to show, for it is there recorded that ‘John Limner of\r\nChevington, and Eliz. Sibbes of this town, were married, August 22nd,\r\n1700.’ (Sibbes’ ‘Works,’ vol. i. p. cxlii.)\r\n\r\nBefore closing this necessarily hurried résumé of mediæval trade, we\r\nmust say a word or two about early shipping. We have mentioned certain\r\narticles, especially those of spicery and wines, which were then used,\r\nas the result of foreign merchant enterprise. Much of all this came as\r\nthe growth and produce of the opposite Continent. Much again reached our\r\nshore brought hither from Eastern lands in caravan and caravel by\r\nVenetian traders. Our ‘Marchants,’ ‘Merchants,’ or ‘le Marchants,’ we\r\ndoubtless owe to this more extended commerce. Apart from these, however,\r\nwe are far from being without names of a more seafaring nature. It is a\r\nstrange circumstance that our now one general term of ‘sailor’ had in\r\nthe days we are considering but the barest existence surnominally or\r\ncolloquially. In the former respect I only find it twice, the instances\r\nbeing those of ‘John le Saillur’ and ‘Nicholas le Saler,’ both to be\r\nfound in the Hundred Rolls. It may be said to be a word of entirely\r\nmodern growth. The expression then in familiar use was ‘Shipman,’[425]\r\nand ‘Shipman’ is the surname best represented in our nomenclature. It is\r\nby this name one of Chaucer’s company at the Tabard is pictured forth—\r\n\r\n              A Shipman ther was woned far by West,\r\n              He knew wel alle the havens as they were,\r\n              Fro’ Gotland to the Cape de Finisterre,\r\n              And every creke, in Bretagne, and in Spaine;\r\n              His barge ycliped was the ‘Magdelaine.’\r\n\r\nThis, intended doubtless to set forth the wide extent of his adventure,\r\nwould seem cramped enough for the seafarer of the nineteenth century.\r\nThe word itself lingered on for some length of time, being found both in\r\nour Homilies and in the Authorized Version, but seems to have declined\r\ntowards the end of the seventeenth century. ‘Henry le Mariner’s’ name\r\nstill lives among us, sometimes being found in the abbreviated form of\r\n‘Marner,’ and ‘Shipper’ or ‘Skipper’ is not as yet obsolete. The\r\nstrictly speaking feminine ‘Shipster’ comes in the quaint old poem of\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ where mention is made among others of—\r\n\r\n                   Gogle-eyed Tomson, shipster of Lyn.\r\n\r\n‘Cogger,’ found in such an entry as ‘Hamond le Cogger’ or ‘Henry le\r\nCogger,’ carries us back to the old ‘cogge’ or fishing smack, a term\r\nvery familiar on the east coast, and one not yet altogether obsolete. It\r\nseems to have been often used to carry the soldiery across the Channel\r\nto France and the Low Country border, or even further.[426] Our\r\n_cockswain_ was, I doubt not, he who attended to the tiller of the boat.\r\nWe still speak also of a _cock-boat_, written in the ‘Promptorium\r\nParvulorum’ as ‘cog bote,’ and doubtless it was originally some smaller\r\ncraft that waited upon and attended the other. Thus it is highly\r\nprobable that ‘le Cockere’ may in some instances have been but\r\nequivalent to ‘le Cogger.’[427] ‘Richard le Botsweyn,’ ‘Edward\r\nBotswine,’ ‘Peter Boatman,’ ‘Jacob Boatman,’ or the more local ‘Gerard\r\nde la Barge,’ are all still familiar enough in an occupative sense, but\r\nsurnominally have been long extinct, with the exception of the\r\nlast.[428]\r\n\r\nComing to port, whether it were York, or Kingston, or Chester, or\r\nLondon, we find ‘Adam le Waterman,’ or ‘Richard Waterbearer,’ or\r\n‘William le Water-leder’ busy enough by the waterside.[429] The latter\r\nterm, however, was far the commonest in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. I have already mentioned the sense of ‘lead’ at this time,\r\nthat of carrying. Piers Plowman, to quote but one more instance, says in\r\none place—\r\n\r\n                       With Lumbardes letters\r\n                       I ladde gold to Rome,\r\n                       And took it by tale there.\r\n\r\nIn the York Pageant of 1415 we find two separate detachments of these\r\nwater-leaders in procession, one in conjunction with the bakers, the\r\nother with the cooks. It would be doubtless these two classes of\r\nshopkeepers their duties of carrying stores, especially flour, to and\r\nfrom the different vessels would bring them in contact with most. Our\r\n‘Leaders,’ ‘Leeders,’ ‘Leders,’ and ‘Loders’ are either the more general\r\ncarrier or an abbreviated form of the above.[430] ‘Gager,’ though rarely\r\nmet with now, is a descendant of ‘William le Gageour,’ or ‘Alexander le\r\nGauger,’ or ‘Henry le Gaugeour,’ of many a mediæval record. His office\r\nwas to attend to the King’s revenue at our seaports, and though not\r\nstrictly so confined, yet his duties were all but entirely concerned in\r\nthe measurement of liquids, such as oil, wine, honey.[431] The tun, the\r\npipe, the tierce, the puncheon, casks and barrels of a specified\r\nsize—these came under his immediate supervision, and the royal fee was\r\naccordingly. Such a name as ‘Josceus le Peisur,’ now found as ‘Poyser’\r\nor ‘Henry le Waiur,’ that is, ‘Weigher,’[432] met with now also in the\r\nform of ‘Weightman,’ represented the passage of more solid merchandise.\r\nThe old form of ‘poise’ was ‘peise.’ Piers Plowman makes Covetousness to\r\nconfess—\r\n\r\n                        I lerned among Lumbardes\r\n                        And Jewes a lesson,\r\n                        To weye pens with a peis,\r\n                        And pare the heaviest.\r\n\r\nRichard in ‘Richard the III.’ finely says—\r\n\r\n           I’ll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,\r\n           Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow.\r\n                                             (Act v. scene 3.)\r\n\r\nWith the above, therefore, we must associate our ‘Tollers,’ once\r\nregistered as ‘Bartholomew le Tollere’ or ‘Ralph le Toller,’ together\r\nwith our ‘Tolemans’ and ‘Tolmans,’ they who took the King’s levy at fair\r\nand market—by the roadside and the wharf.[433] Piers Plowman, in a list\r\nof other decent folk, includes—\r\n\r\n                        Taillours and tynkers,\r\n                        And tollers in markettes,\r\n                        Masons and mynours,\r\n                        And many other crafts.\r\n\r\nCocke Lorelle is not so complimentary. He says—\r\n\r\n           Then come two false towlers in nexte,\r\n           He set them by pykers (thieves) of the beste.[434]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter, and our survey of trade generally, it will\r\nbe necessary to the completion thereof that we should say a word or two\r\nabout the money trading of four hundred years ago or more. Banks,\r\nbank-notes, bills of exchange, drafts to order—all these are as familiar\r\nto the tongues of the nineteenth century as if the great car of commerce\r\nhad ever gone along on such greased and comfortable wheels. But I need\r\nnot say it is not so. Very little money in the present day is\r\npractically coin. Our banks have it all. It was different with our\r\nancestors. As a rule it was stored up in some secret cupboard or chest.\r\nHence it is, as I have shown, the trade of ‘le Coffer’ and the office of\r\n‘le Cofferer’ are so much thrust before our notice in surveying mediæval\r\nrecords. Still, trading in money was largely carried on, so far, at any\r\nrate, as loans were concerned. The Jew, true to his national precedents,\r\nwas then, I need not say, the pawnbroker of Europe, and as his disciple,\r\nthe Lumbard soon bid fair to outstrip his master. Under the Plantagenet\r\ndynasty both found a prosperous field for their peculiar business in\r\nEngland, and, as I have elsewhere said, Lombard Street[435] to this day\r\nis a memorial of the settlement of the latter. In such uncertain and\r\nchangeful times as these, kings, and in their train courtiers and\r\nnobles, soon learnt the art, not difficult in initiation, of pawning\r\njewels and lands for coin. The Malvern Dreamer speaks familiarly of\r\nthis—\r\n\r\n                      I have lent lordes\r\n                      And ladies my chaffare,\r\n                      And been their brocour after,\r\n                      And bought it myselve;\r\n                      Eschaunges and chevysaunces\r\n                      With such cheffare I dele.\r\n\r\nThis species of commerce is early marked by such names as ‘Henry le\r\nChaunger’ or ‘Adam le Chevestier,’[436] while still better-known terms\r\nare brought to our notice by entries like ‘John le Banckere,’ ‘Roger le\r\nBencher,’ ‘Thomas le Brokur,’ or ‘Simon le Brokour.’ Holinshed, in the\r\nform of ‘brogger,’ has the latter to denote one who negotiated for coin.\r\nAs ‘Broggers,’ too, we met them in the York Pageant. There, probably,\r\nthey would transact much of the business carried on between ourselves\r\nand the Dutch in the shipping off of fleeces, or the introduction of the\r\ncloth again from the Flemish manufacturers.[437] The pawnbroker of\r\nmodern days, dealing in petty articles of ware, was evidently an unknown\r\npersonage at the date we are considering. The first distinctive notice\r\nof him I can light upon is in the ‘Statutes of the Realm’ of the Stuart\r\nperiod. It will be there found that (chapter xxi.) James I., speaking of\r\nthe change from the old broker into the more modern pawnbroker, refers\r\nto the former as one who went ‘betweene Merchant Englishe and Merchant\r\nStrangers, and Tradesmen in the contrivinge, makinge and concluding\r\nBargaines and Contractes to be made betweene them concerning their wares\r\nand merchandises,’ and then adds that he ‘never of any ancient tyme used\r\nto buy and sell garments, household stuffe, or to take pawnes and bills\r\nof sale of garments and apparele, and all things that come to hand for\r\nmoney, laide out and lent upon usury, or to keepe open shoppes, and to\r\nmake open shewes, and open trade, as now of late yeeres hathe and is\r\nused by a number of citizens, etc.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                    APPENDIX TO CHAPTERS IV. AND V.\r\n\r\nIt will perchance help to familiarize the reader with the manner in\r\nwhich the occupative names contained in the two preceding chapters\r\narose, if I transcribe several lists of tradesmen which have come across\r\nmy notice while engaged in the work of collecting surnames for my index.\r\nThe first is found in most of the Yorkshire County Histories, and is a\r\nrecord of the order of the Pageant for the City of York in 1415. The\r\nsecond is the order of the Procession of the Craftsmen and Companies of\r\nNorwich from the Common Hall in 1533. This list will be found in\r\nBlomefield’s ‘Norfolk,’ vol. ii. p. 148. The third is the order of the\r\nChester Play, inaugurated 1339, and discontinued 1574. This list will be\r\nfound in Ormerod’s ‘Cheshire,’ vol. i. p. 300. These records possess an\r\nintrinsic value, apart from other matters, as proving to the reader the\r\nleading position which these several cities held as centres of industry\r\nin the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. The\r\nlast list I would furnish is that met with in the quaint poem entitled\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ published about the beginning of the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., and purporting to give a list of the tradesmen and\r\nmanufacturers of the metropolis at that time.

But I do not think I shall be\r\nmisunderstood, since, whatever be the original meaning intended, the\r\nword has now so thoroughly settled down into its present sphere of\r\nverbal usefulness that it would be a matter of still more lengthened\r\nexplanation if I were to put it in its more pretentious and literal\r\nsense. By ‘nickname,’ in this chapter, at any rate, I intend to take in\r\nall those fortuitous and accidental sobriquets which, once expressive of\r\npeculiar and individual characteristics, have survived the age in which\r\nthey sprang, and now preserved only in the lumber-room of our\r\ndirectories, may be brought forth once more wherever they help to throw\r\na brighter light upon the decayed memorials of a bygone era. It will be\r\nseen at a glance that it is no easy task that of assorting a large body\r\nof nondescript and unclassed terms, but I will do my best under pleaded\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nWe are not without traces of this special kind of sobriquets even in the\r\nearly days before the Norman Conquest was dreamt or thought of. I have\r\nalready instanced the Venerable Bede as speaking of two missionaries\r\nwho, both bearing the name of Hewald, were distinguished by the surnames\r\nof ‘White’ and ‘Black,’ on account of their hair partaking of those\r\nrespective hues. In the ninth century, too, Ethelred, Earl of the Gaini,\r\nwas styled the ‘Mucel’ or ‘Mickle’—‘eo quod erat corpore magnus et\r\nprudentiâ grandis.’ With the incoming of the Normans, however, came a\r\ngreat change. The burlesque was part of their nature. A vein for the\r\nludicrous was speedily acquired. It spread in every rank and grade of\r\nsociety. The Saxon himself was touched with the contagion, ere yet the\r\nsouthern blood was infused into his veins. Equally among the high and\r\nthe low did such sobriquets as ‘le Bastard,’ ‘le Rouse,’ ‘le Beauclerk,’\r\n‘le Grisegonel’ (Greycloke), ‘Plantagenet,’ ‘Sansterre,’ and ‘Cœur de\r\nlion’ find favour. But it did not stay here; the more ridiculous and\r\nabsurd characteristics became the butt of attack. In a day when\r\nbuffoonery had become a profession, when every roughly-sketched drawing\r\nwas a caricature, every story a record of licentious adventure, it could\r\nnot be otherwise. The only wonderment is the tame acquiescence on the\r\npart of the stigmatized bearer. To us now-a-days, to be termed amongst\r\nour fellows ‘Richard the Crookbacked,’ ‘William Blackinthemouth,’\r\n‘Thomas the Pennyfather’ (that is, the Miser), or ‘Thomas Wrangeservice’\r\n(the opposite of Walter Scott’s ‘Andrew Fairservice’), would be looked\r\nupon as mere wanton insult. But it was then far different. The times, as\r\nI have said, were rougher and coarser, and the delicacy of feeling which\r\nwould have shrunk from so addressing those with whom we had to deal, or\r\nfrom making them the object of our banter, would have been perfectly\r\nmisunderstood. Apart from this, too, the bearer, after all, had little\r\nto do with the question. He did not give himself the nickname he\r\nreceived it; pleasant or unpleasant, as he had no voice in the\r\nacquisition, so had he none in its retention. There was nothing for it\r\nbut good-tempered acquiescence. We know to this very day how difficult\r\nwas the task of getting rid of our school nicknames, how they clung to\r\nus from the unhappy hour in which some sharp-witted, quick, discerning\r\nyoungster found out our weak part, and dubbed us by a sobriquet, which,\r\nwhile it perhaps exaggerated the characteristic to which it had\r\nreference, had the effect which a hundred admonitions from paternal or\r\nmagisterial head-quarters had not, to make us see our folly and mend our\r\nways. None the less, however, did the affix remain, and this was our\r\npunishment. How often, when in after years we come accidentally across\r\nsome quondam schoolfellow, each staring strangely at the other’s grizzly\r\nbeard or beetled brow, the old sobriquet will crop up to the lips, and\r\nin the very naturalness with which the expression is uttered all the\r\nseparation of years of thought and feeling is forgotten, and we are\r\ninstantly back to the old days and the old haunts, and pell-mell in the\r\nthick of old boyish scrapes again. Yet perchance these names were\r\noffensive. But they have wholly lost their force. We had ceased to feel\r\nhurt by them long before we parted in early days. See how this, too, is\r\nillustrated in the present day in the names of certain sects and\r\nparties. We talk calmly of ‘Capuchins,’ ‘Quakers,’ ‘Ranters,’ ‘Whigs’\r\nand ‘Tories,’ and yet some of these taken literally are offensive\r\nenough, especially the political ones. But, as we know, all that\r\nattached to them of odium has long ago become clouded, obscured, and\r\nforgotten, and now they are the accepted, nay, proudly owned, titles of\r\nthe party they represent. Were it not for this we might be puzzled to\r\nconceive why in these early times such a name as ‘le Bonde,’ significant\r\nof nothing but personal servitude and galling oppression, was allowed to\r\nremain. That ‘le Free’ and ‘le Freman’ and ‘le Franch-homme’ should\r\nsurvive the ravages of time is natural enough. But with ‘Bond’ it is\r\ndifferent. It bespoke slavery. Yet it is one of our most familiar names\r\nof to-day. How is this? The explanation is easy. The term was used to\r\ndenote personality, not position; the notion of condition was lost in\r\nthat of identity. It was just the same with sobriquets of a more\r\nhumorous and broad character, with nicknames in fact. The roughest\r\nhumour of those rough days is oftentimes found in these early records,\r\nand the surnames which, putting complimentary and objectionable and\r\nneutral together, belong to this day to this class, form still well-nigh\r\nthe largest proportion of our national nomenclature. There is something\r\nindescribably odd, when we reflect about it, that the turn of a toe, the\r\ntwist of a leg, the length of a limb, the colour of a lock of hair, a\r\nconceited look, a spiteful glance, a miserly habit of some in other\r\nrespects unknown and long-forgotten ancestor, should still five or six\r\ncenturies afterwards be unblushingly proclaimed to the world by the\r\nimmediate descendants therefrom. And yet so it is with our\r\n‘Cruickshanks’ or ‘Whiteheads’ or ‘Meeks’ or ‘Proudmans;’ thus it is\r\nwith our ‘Longmans’ and ‘Shortmans,’ our ‘Biggs’ and ‘Littles,’ and the\r\nendless others we shall speedily mention. Still these represent a better\r\nclass of surnames. As time wore on, and the nation became more refined,\r\nthere was an attempt made, successful in many instances, to throw off\r\nthe more objectionable of these names. Some were so utterly gross and\r\nribald as even in that day to sink into almost instant oblivion. Some, I\r\ndoubt not, never became hereditary at all.\r\n\r\nIn glancing briefly over a portion of these names we must endeavour to\r\naffect some order. We might divide them into two classes merely,\r\nphysical and moral or mental peculiarities; but this would scarcely\r\nsuffice for distinction, as each would still be so large as to make us\r\nfeel ourselves to be in a labyrinth that had no outlet. Nor would these\r\ntwo classes be sufficiently comprehensive? There would still be left a\r\nlarge mass of sobriquets which could scarcely be placed with fitness in\r\neither category: nicknames from Nature, nicknames from oaths, or\r\nstreet-cries, or mottoes, or nicknames again in the shape of descriptive\r\ncompounds. Names from the animal kingdom, of course, could be set under\r\neither a moral or physical head, as, in all cases, saving when they have\r\narisen from inn-signs or ensigns, they would be affixed on the owner for\r\nsome supposed affinity he bore in mind or body to the creature in\r\nquestion. Still it will be easier to place them, as well as some others,\r\nunder a third and more miscellaneous category. These three divisions I\r\nwould again subdivide in the following fashion:—\r\n\r\nI.—_Physical and External Peculiarities._\r\n\r\n    (1) Nicknames from peculiarities of relationship, condition, age,\r\n        size, shape, and capacity.\r\n\r\n    (2) Nicknames from peculiarities of complexion.\r\n\r\n    (3) Nicknames from peculiarities of dress and its accoutrements.\r\n\r\nII.—_Mental and Moral Peculiarities._\r\n\r\n    (1) Nicknames from peculiarities of disposition—_complimentary_.\r\n\r\n    (2) Nicknames from peculiarities of disposition—_objectionable_.\r\n\r\nIII.—_Miscellaneous._\r\n\r\n    (1) Nicknames from the animal and vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n    (2) Descriptive compounds affixed as nicknames.[438]\r\n\r\n    (3) Nicknames from oaths, street-cries, and mottoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                I.—PHYSICAL AND EXTERNAL PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\n   (1) _Nicknames from Peculiarities of Relationship, Age, Size, and\r\n                               Capacity._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Relationship._—There is scarcely any position in which one man\r\ncan stand to another which is not found recorded pure and simple in the\r\nsurnames of to-day. The manner in which these arose was natural enough.\r\nWe still talk of ‘John Smith, Senior,’ and ‘John Smith, Junior,’ when we\r\nrequire a distinction to be made between two of the same name. So it was\r\nthen, only the practice was carried further. I find, for instance, in\r\none simple record, the following insertions:—‘John Darcy le fiz,’ ‘John\r\nDarcy le frere,’ ‘John Darcy le unkle,’ ‘John Darcy le cosyn,’ ‘John\r\nDarcy le nevue,’ and ‘John Darcy, junior.’ How easy would it be for\r\nthose in whose immediate community these different representatives of\r\nthe one same name lived to style each by his term of relationship, and\r\nfor this, once familiarised, to become his surname. ‘Uncle,’[439] once\r\nfound as ‘Robert le Unkle,’ or ‘John le Uncle,’ is now quite obsolete, I\r\nthink; but the pretty old Saxon ‘Eame’ abides hale and hearty in our\r\nnumberless ‘Eames,’ ‘Ames,’ ‘Emes,’ and ‘Yeames.’ We find it used in the\r\n‘Townley Mysteries.’ In one of them Rebecca tells Jacob he must flee for\r\nfear of Esau—\r\n\r\n               _Jacob._   Wheder-ward shuld I go, dame?\r\n\r\n               _Rebecca._ To Mesopotameam\r\n                       To my brother and thyne _eme_,\r\n                       That dwellys beside Jordan streme.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Promp. Par.’ defines a _cozen_ to be an ‘emys son,’ and it is from\r\nhim, no doubt, our many ‘Cousens,’ ‘Cousins,’ ‘Couzens,’ and ‘Cozens’\r\nhave sprung, descended as they are from ‘Richard le Cusyn’ (A.), or\r\n‘John le Cosyn’ (G.), or ‘Thomas le Cozun’ (E.). ‘Kinsman’ (‘John\r\nKynnesman,’ Z.Z.) may be of the same degree. ‘Widowson’ (‘William le\r\nWedweson,’ R., ‘Simon fil. Vidue,’ A.[440]) is apparently the same as\r\nthe once existing ‘Faderless’ (‘John Faderless,’ M.),[441] while\r\n‘Brotherson’ and ‘Sisterson’ (‘Jacob Systerson,’ W. 3) seem to be but\r\nold-fashioned phrases for a nephew, in which case they are but\r\nsynonymous with the Norman ‘Nephew,’ ‘Neve,’ ‘Neave,’ or ‘Neaves;’ all\r\nthese forms being familiar to our directories, and descendants of\r\n‘Reyner le Neve’ (A.), or ‘Richard le Nevu’ (E.), or ‘Robert le Neave’\r\n(Z.). Capgrave, giving the descent of Eber, says: ‘In this yere (anno\r\n2509) Sala begat Heber; and of this Eber, as auctouris say, came the\r\npeople Hebrak, for Heber was _neve_ unto Sem.’ Thus again, the Saxon\r\n‘Arnold le Fader’ was met by the Norman ‘John Parent,’ and the still\r\nmore foreign ‘Ralph le Padre,’ while ‘William le Brother’ found his\r\ncounterpart in ‘Geoffrey le Freer,’ or ‘Frere;’ but as in so many cases\r\nthis latter must be a relic of the old freere or friar, we had better\r\nrefer it, perhaps, to that more spiritual relationship.[442]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Condition._—We have still traces in our midst of sobriquets\r\nrelating to the poverty or wealth of the original bearer. Our ‘Poores,’\r\noften found as ‘Powers,’ are descended from the ‘Roger le Poveres,’ or\r\n‘Robert le Poors,’ of the thirteenth century, while our ‘Riches’ are set\r\ndown at the same period as ‘Swanus le Riche’ or ‘Gervase le Riche.’ Of\r\nseveral kindred surnames we may mention a ‘John le Nedyman,’ now\r\nobsolete, and an ‘Elyas le Diveys,’ which, in the more Biblical form of\r\nDives, still exists in the metropolis. It is somewhat remarkable that we\r\nshould have the Jewish ‘Lazarus’ also, and that this too should have\r\narisen in not a few instances from the fact that its first possessor was\r\na leper. ‘Nicholas le Lepere’ and ‘Walter le Lepper’ speak for\r\nthemselves. With the above we may ally our early ‘Robert le Ragiddes’\r\nand ‘Thomas le Raggedes,’ which remind us that our vagabonds, if not our\r\n‘Raggs’ and ‘Raggetts,’ are of no modern extraction, but come of a very\r\nold family indeed! ‘Half-naked,’ I unhesitatingly at first set down as\r\none of this class, but it is local.[443]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Age, Size, Shape, Capacity._—This class is very large, and\r\nembraces every possible, and well-nigh impossible feature of human life.\r\nA glance over our old records, and we can almost at once find ‘Lusty’\r\nand ‘Strong,’ ‘Long’ and ‘Short,’ ‘Bigg’[444] and ‘Little,’ ‘High’ and\r\n‘Lowe’ (both perchance local), ‘Large’ and ‘Small,’ ‘Thick’ and ‘Thin,’\r\n‘Slight’ and ‘Round,’ ‘Lean’ and ‘Fatt,’ ‘Megre’ and ‘Stout,’[445]\r\n‘Ould’ and ‘Young,’ and ‘Light’ and ‘Heavy.’ Was this not sufficient?\r\nWere there several in the same community who could boast similarity in\r\nrespect to one or other of these varieties? Then we got ‘Stronger,’\r\n‘Shorter,’ ‘Younger,’[446] ‘Littler,’ ‘Least,’[447] ‘Senior,’ ‘Junior,’\r\nand in some cases ‘Elder.’ Some of these are of course Norman; but when\r\nSaxon occur we can all but invariably find the Norman equivalent. Thus,\r\nif ‘Large’ be Saxon, ‘Gros’ (now ‘Grose’ and ‘Gross’) is Norman; if\r\n‘Bigge’ be Saxon, ‘Graunt’ or ‘Grant’ or ‘Grand’ is Norman;[448] if\r\n‘Small’ be Saxon, ‘Pettitt’ or ‘Pettye’ or ‘Petty’ or ‘Peat’ is Norman.\r\nThus again, ‘Lowe’ meets face to face with ‘Bas’ or ‘Bass,’ ‘Short’ with\r\n‘Curt,’ ‘Fatte’ with ‘Gras’ or ‘Grass’ or ‘Grace,’[449] ‘Strong’ with\r\n‘Fort,’ ‘Ould’ with ‘Viele,’ ‘Twist’ with ‘Tort,’ and ‘Young’ or ‘Yonge’\r\nwith ‘Jeune.’ Sometimes the termination ‘_man_’ is added, as in\r\n‘Strongman,’ ‘Longman,’ ‘Smallman,’ ‘Oldman,’ and ‘Youngman,’ or if a\r\nwoman, _dame_, as in such a case as ‘Matilda Lenedame,’ which as a\r\nsurname died probably with its owner. Sometimes, again, we have the\r\nolder and more antique form, as in ‘Smale’ and ‘Smaleman,’ that is,\r\nsmall; ‘Yonge’ and ‘Yongeman,’ that is, young; and ‘Lyte’ and ‘Lyteman,’\r\nthat is, little; ‘Wight’ and ‘Wightman,’ now obsolete in our general\r\nvocabulary, referred to personal strength and activity. In the ‘Vision\r\nof Piers Plowman,’ one of the sons of ‘Sire Inwit’ is described as\r\nbeing—\r\n\r\n                        A wight man of strength.\r\n\r\n‘Manikin,’ found at the same period, needs no explanation.[450]\r\n\r\nOf the less general we have well-nigh numberless illustrations. It is\r\nonly when we come to look at our nomenclature we find out how many\r\nseparate limbs, joints, and muscles we individually possess, and by what\r\na variety of terms they severally went in earlier days. No treatise of\r\nanatomy can be more precise in regard to this than our directories. Some\r\nprominence or other peculiarity about the head or face has given us our\r\n‘Chins,’ ‘Chekes,’ or ‘Cheeks,’ and ‘Jowles,’ or ‘Joules.’ We are all\r\nfamiliar with the protruding fangs of our friend ‘Jowler’ of the canine\r\ncommunity. Thus even here also we must place ‘cheek by jowl.’\r\n‘Glossycheek’ (‘Bertholomew Gloscheke,’ A.) once existed, but is\r\nobsolete now. The same is true in respect of ‘Duredent’ (‘Walter\r\nDuredent,’ E.), or ‘Dent-de-fer,’ _i.e._, ‘Irontoothed’ (‘Robert\r\nDent-de-fer,’ E.), which spoke well no doubt for the masticatory powers\r\nof its owner. ‘Merrymouth’ (‘Richard Merymouth,’ X.) would be a standing\r\ntestimony to its possessor’s good humour. It is decidedly more\r\nacceptable than ‘Dogmow’[451] (‘Arnulph Dogmow,’ A.) or ‘Calvesmawe’\r\n(‘Robert Calvesmaghe,’ M.), recorded at the same period. Sweetmouth’\r\n(‘Robert Swetemouth,’ D.) also speaks for the sentiment of the times. In\r\nmodern days, at least, the eye is supposed to be one of the chief points\r\nof personal identity. I only find one or two instances, however, where\r\nthis feature has given the sobriquet in our mediæval rolls. In the\r\n‘Calendarium Genealogicum’ a ‘Robertus Niger-oculus,’ or ‘Robert\r\nBlackeye,’ is set down as having been ‘pro felonia suspensus.’ We are\r\nreminded in his name of the ‘Blackeyed Susan’ of later days, but whether\r\nNature had given him the said hue or some pugilistic encounter I cannot\r\nsay. Judging by his antecedents, so far as the above Latin sentence\r\nbetrays them, the latter would seem to be the more likely origin.[452]\r\n‘William le Blynd,’ or ‘Ralph le Blinde,’ speak for themselves.[453] The\r\n‘Saxon Head,’ in some cases local, doubtless, is still familiar to us.\r\nIts more Norman ‘Tait’ fitly sits at present upon the archiepiscopal\r\nthrone of Canterbury. Grostete, one of which name was a distinguished\r\nbishop of Lincoln in the fourteenth century, is now represented by\r\n‘Greathead’ and ‘Broadhead’ only. Butler, in his ‘Hudibras,’ records it\r\nin the more colloquial form of Grosted—\r\n\r\n                   None a deeper knowledge boasted,\r\n                   Since Hodge Bacon, and Bob Grosted.\r\n\r\nThe equally foreign ‘Belteste’ (‘John Beleteste,’ A.) is content,\r\nlikewise, to allow ‘Fairhead’ (‘Richard Faireheved,’ H.) to transmit to\r\nposterity the claims of its early possessor to _capital_ grace.\r\n‘Blackhead’[454] existed in the seventeenth, and ‘Hardhead’ in the\r\nfifteenth century. These are all preferable, however, to ‘Lambshead’\r\n(‘Agnes Lambesheved,’ A.), found some generations earlier, and still\r\nfirmly settled in our midst, as the ‘London Directory’ can vouch.[455]\r\nSo much for the head. ‘Neck’ and ‘Swire’ are both synonymous. Chaucer\r\ndescribes Envy as ready to ‘scratch her face,’ or ‘rend her clothes,’ or\r\n‘tear her swire,’[456] in respect of which latter feat we should now\r\nmore generally say ‘tear her hair.’ Either operation, however, would be\r\nunpleasant enough, and it is just as well that for all practical\r\npurposes it only occurs in poetry. Some characteristic of strength, or\r\nbeauty, or deformity (let us assume one of the former) has given us our\r\n‘Hands,’ ‘Armes,’ and ‘Brass’s,’ from the old ‘Braz.’ ‘Finger,’ once\r\nexisting (‘Matilda Finger,’ H.), is now obsolete. Whether this sobriquet\r\nwas given on the same grounds as that bestowed on the redoubtable ‘Tom\r\nThumb,’ I cannot say. ‘Brazdifer’ (‘Simon Braz-de-fer,’ E., ‘Michael\r\nBras-de-fer,’ B.B.), arm of iron, once a renowned nom-de-plume, still\r\ndwells, though obsolete in itself, in our ‘Strongithams’ and\r\n‘Armstrongs.’[457] A common form of this North-country name was\r\n‘Armstrang’ or ‘Armestrang’ (‘Adam le Armstrang,’ G.), reminding us that\r\nour ‘Strangs’ are but the fellows of our more southern ‘Strongs’ (‘John\r\nle Strang,’ E., ‘Joscelin le Strong,’ H.). ‘Lang’[458] and ‘Long’\r\nrepresent a similar difference of pronunciation. The ‘Armstrongs’ were a\r\ngreat Border clan. Mr. Lower reminds me of the following lines:—\r\n\r\n                   Ye need not go to Liddisdale,\r\n                   For when they see the blazing bale\r\n                   Elliots and Armstrongs never fail.\r\n                        (_Lay of the Last Minstrel._)\r\n\r\nAnother and more foreign form of this sobriquet, ‘Ferbas’ (‘Robert\r\nFerbras,’ M.), has come down to us in our somewhat curious-looking\r\n‘Firebraces.’ Still earlier than any of these we find the sobriquet\r\n‘Swartbrand.’ Thus we see the arm wielded a powerful influence over\r\nnames as well as people, no mere accident in a day when ‘might was\r\nright.’ ‘Main,’ when not local, corresponds to the Saxon ‘Hand,’ and is\r\nfound in composition in such designations as ‘Blanchmains,’ that is,\r\nwhite-hand, ‘Grauntmains,’ big-hand, ‘Tortesmain,’ twisted-hand,\r\n‘Malemeyn,’ evil-hand, or perhaps maimed-hand, equivalent therefore to\r\n‘Male-braunch’ (found at the same early date) in ‘Mainstrong,’ a mere\r\nvariation of ‘Armstrong,’ and in ‘Quarterman,’ scarcely recognisable in\r\nsuch an English-like form as the Norman ‘Quatre-main,’ the four-handed.\r\nIn the reign of the second Richard it had become registered as\r\n‘Quatremayn’ and ‘Quatreman,’ and the inversion of the two letters in\r\nthis latter case was of course inevitable.[459] ‘Brazdifer,’ I have\r\nsaid, is extinct—not so, however, ‘Pedifer’ (‘Bernard Pedefer,’ G.,\r\n‘Fulbert Pedefer,’ X.), that is, iron-footed, which, occurring from the\r\nearliest times, still looks stout and hearty in its present guise of\r\n‘Petifer,’ ‘Pettifer,’[460] and ‘Potiphar,’ though the last would seem\r\nto claim for it a pedigree nearly as ancient as that of the Welshman\r\nwho, _half-way_ up his genealogical tree, had made the interesting note:\r\n‘About this time Adam was born.’ Even this name, however, did not escape\r\ntranslation, for we find an ‘Ironfoot’ (‘Peter Yrenefot,’ A.) recorded\r\nat the same date as the above.[461] Our ‘Legges,’ our ‘Shanks’ and\r\n‘Footes,’[462] are all familiar to us, though the first is in most cases\r\nundoubtedly local, as being but an olden form of ‘Leigh.’[463] We all\r\nremember the inimitable couplet placed over the memorial to Samuel\r\nFoote, the comedian—\r\n\r\n         Here lies one _Foote_, whose death may thousands save,\r\n         For death has now one _foot_ within the grave.\r\n\r\n‘Jambe’ was the Norman synonym of ‘Shank,’ and by way of more definite\r\ndistinction we light upon the somewhat flattering ‘Bellejambe,’ the\r\nequally unflattering ‘Foljambe,’ the doubtful ‘Greyshank,’[464] the\r\nhistoric ‘Longshank,’ the hapless ‘Cruikshank’ or ‘Bowshank,’[465] the\r\ndecidedly uncomplimentary ‘Sheepshank,’ and, last and worst,\r\n‘Pelkeshank,’ seemingly intended to be ‘Pelican-shanked,’ which, when we\r\nrecall the peculiar disproportion of that bird’s extremities to the rest\r\nof its body, affords ample reason for the absence of that sobriquet in\r\nour more modern rolls. Some fifty years ago a certain Mr. Sheepshanks,\r\nof Jesus College, Cambridge, while undergoing an examination in Juvenal,\r\npronounced ‘satire’ ‘satyr.’ A wag, thereupon, wrote the following\r\nepigram, which soon found its way through the University:—\r\n\r\n       The satyrs of old were satyrs of note,\r\n       With the head of a man, they’d the shanks of a goat:\r\n       But the satyr of Jesus all satyrs surpasses,\r\n       Whilst his _shanks_ are a _sheep’s_, his head is an ass’s.\r\n\r\nSwiftness of foot was not allowed to go unrecorded, and we have an\r\ninteresting instance of the way in which this class of surnames arose\r\nfrom an entry recorded in the ‘Issues of the Exchequer.’ There we find a\r\n‘Ralph Swyft’ mentioned as _courier_ to Edward III. Nothing could be\r\nmore natural than for such a sobriquet to become affixed to a man\r\nfulfilling an office like this, requiring, as it did at times, all the\r\nrunning and riding powers of which he could be capable.[466] Other\r\nmemorials of former agility in this respect are still preserved in our\r\n‘Golightlys’[467] and ‘Lightfoots,’ while of still earlier date, and\r\nmore poetical form, we may instance ‘Harefoot’ and ‘Roefoot.’ These,\r\nhowever, are altogether inexpressive in comparison with such a sobriquet\r\nas ‘Scherewind’ or ‘Shearwind,’ which seems to have been a familiar\r\nexpression at this time, for I find it recorded in three several rolls.\r\nIt is strange, and yet not strange, that every peculiarity that can mark\r\nthe human gait is distinctly preserved in our nomenclature. ‘Isabel\r\nStradling’ or ‘William Stradling’ represent the _straddle_; ‘Thomas le\r\nAmbler’ or ‘Ralph le Ambuler’ (when not occupative), the _amble_; our\r\n‘Shailers,’ ‘Shaylors,’ and ‘Shaylers,’ the _shuffle_; ‘Robert le\r\nLiltere,’ the _hop_; our ‘Scamblers’ and ‘Shamblers,’ the weak-kneed\r\n_shamble_; ‘Ralph le Todeler,’ the _toddle_; and ‘Samuel Trotman’ or\r\n‘Richard Trotter’ (when not occupative), the _trot_, if that be possible\r\non two legs. Besides these, we may mention the obsolete ‘Thomas\r\nPetitpas’ or ‘John Petypase,’ ‘William Noblepas,’ and ‘Malpas,’ which we\r\nmight Saxonize into ‘Short-step,’ ‘High-step,’ and ‘Bad-step.’\r\n‘Christiana Lameman’ and ‘William Laymeman’ remind us of more pitiable\r\nweaknesses. ‘Barefoot’ may have been the designation of some one under\r\npenitential routine, unless it be a corruption of ‘Bearfoot.’\r\n‘Proudfoot’ and ‘Platfoot’ (plat = flat) need no comment, while\r\n‘Sikelfoot,’ found by Mr. Lower as existing in the thirteenth century,\r\nseems, as he says, to bespeak a splayed appearance or outward\r\ntwist.[468] If this be so, the owner was not alone in his distress. We\r\nhave just mentioned ‘Cruikshank.’ Our ‘Crooks’ are, I doubt not, of\r\nsimilar origin, and another compound of the same, now obsolete, was\r\n‘Crookbone’ (‘Henry Crokebane,’ A.). Our ‘Crumps’ are but relics of the\r\nold ‘Richard le Crumpe’ or ‘Hugh le Crump,’ the crookbacked, and perhaps\r\nour ‘Cramps’ and ‘Crimps’ are but changes rung on the same. Our nursery\r\nliterature still preserves the story of the ‘cow with the crumpled\r\nhorn.’ Thus, also, was it with our ‘Cams,’ once ‘William le Cam.’ As a\r\nCeltic stream-name, denoting a winding course, it has survived the\r\naggressions of Saxon and Norman, and is still familiar. Cambridge and\r\nCamford are on two different streams of this name. In the north a man is\r\nstill said to ‘cam his shoe’ who wears it down on one side. I have heard\r\nthe phrase often among the poorer classes of Lancashire. ‘Camoys’ or\r\n‘Camuse,’ from the same root, was generally applied to the nasal organ.\r\nIn the description of the Miller, which I shall have occasion to quote\r\nagain shortly, Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n              A Sheffield thwitel bare he in his hose,\r\n              Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.\r\n\r\nAs, however, I find both ‘John le Camoys’ and ‘Reginald de Camoys,’ it\r\nis only a fair presumption that in some cases it is of Norman local\r\norigin. With one of our leading families it is undoubtedly so. The two\r\ngreat clans of ‘Cameron’ and ‘Campbell,’ I may say in passing, though\r\ntreading upon Scottish soil, are said to mean severally ‘crook-nosed’\r\nand ‘crook-mouthed.’ If this be so, we may see how firmly has this\r\nlittle word imbedded itself upon our nomenclature, if not upon our more\r\ngeneral vocabulary. Not to mention ‘Crypling,’ ‘Handless,’ and\r\n‘Onehand,’[469] we find ‘Blind’ significative of blindness; ‘Daffe’ and\r\n‘Daft,’ of deafness; ‘Mutter’ and ‘Stutter,’ not to say ‘Stuttard’ and\r\n‘Stammer,’ of lisping speech; and ‘Dumbard,’ of utter incapacity in that\r\nrespect. Such a sobriquet as ‘Mad’[470] of course explains itself. As we\r\nmight well presume, this has not come down to us. Still less pleasant in\r\ntheir associations are our ‘Burls’ (‘Henry le Burle,’ A.), that is,\r\nblotch-skinned. But complimentary allusions to the smoothness of the\r\nhands and face were not wanting. Apart from a touch of poetry, such\r\nnames as ‘Elizabeth Lyllywhite,’ now ‘Lilywhite;’ ‘William Beauflour,’\r\nnow spelt ‘Boutflower’ and ‘Buffler;’ and ‘Faith Blanchflower,’ still\r\nexisting also, are not without a certain prettiness. Of equally clear\r\ncomplexion would be the obsolete ‘William Whiteflesh’ or ‘Gilbert\r\nWhitehand’[471] or ‘Robert Blanchmains,’ not to mention our ‘Chits’ and\r\n‘Chittys’ (‘John le Chit,’ A., ‘Agnes Chittye,’ Z.). We still talk in\r\nour nurseries of a ‘little chit,’ a word which, though strictly speaking\r\nconfined to no age, had early become a pet name as applied to young\r\nchildren. It is with these, therefore, we must ally our ‘Slicks,’ from\r\n‘sleek,’ ‘smooth,’[472] ‘Sam Slick’ being by no means in possession of\r\nan imaginary name. Chaucer says of ‘Idleness,’ in his Romance—\r\n\r\n                  Her flesh tender as is a chicke\r\n                  With bent browes; smooth and slicke.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how carefully will a sobriquet of an undoubtedly\r\ncomplimentary nature find itself preserved. Such a name as ‘Hugh le\r\nBell’ or ‘Richard le Bell’ is an instance in point.[473] While\r\nobjectionable designations, or even those of but equivocal character,\r\nhave been gradually shuffled off or barely allowed to survive, the mere\r\nfact of this being at the present day one of the most familiar, and in\r\nrespect of sobriquet nomenclature the absolutely most common, of our\r\nsurnames, shows that the human heart is not altered by lapse of\r\ngenerations, and that pride then, as now, wielded a powerful sceptre\r\nover the minds of men. Our ‘Belhams’ represent but the fuller\r\n‘Bellehomme’ (‘William Bellehomme,’ M.). Thus the two may be set against\r\nour Saxon ‘Prettys’ and ‘Prettimans,’[474] though ‘pretty’ would\r\nscarcely find itself so acceptable now, denoting as it does a style of\r\nbeauty rather too effeminate for the lords of creation. In the Hundred\r\nRolls occur ‘Matilda Winsome’ and ‘Alicia Welliking.’ Both these terms,\r\ncomplimentary as they undoubtedly were, are now obsolete, so far as our\r\ndirectories are concerned.\r\n\r\n           (2) _Nicknames from Peculiarities of Complexion._\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, it is, perhaps, complexion which has occupied for\r\nitself the largest niche in our more general nomenclature. Nor is this\r\nunnatural. It is still that which, in describing people, we seize upon\r\nas the best means of recognition. Sobriquets of this kind were so\r\nnumerous, indeed, that there was no term in the vocabulary of the day\r\nwhich could be used to denote the colour of the dress, the hair, or the\r\nface, which did not find itself a place among our surnames.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with our beasts of burden or animals of the chase. In\r\nthese days their hides almost invariably furnished forth their current\r\ndesignations. Thus we find the horse familiarly known by such titles as\r\n‘Morell,’ from its moorish or swarthy tan, or ‘Lyard,’ that is,\r\ndapple-grey, or ‘Bayard,’ bay, or ‘Favell,’ dun, or ‘Blank,’ white. The\r\ndark hide of the ass got for it the sobriquet of ‘Dun,’ a term still\r\npreserved in the old proverb, ‘As dull as Dun in the mire,’ while again\r\nas ‘Burnell’ its browner aspect will be familiar to all readers of\r\nChaucer. Thus, also, the fox was known as ‘Russell,’ the bear as\r\n‘Bruin,’ and the young hind, from its early indefinite red, ‘Sorrell.’\r\nHow natural that the same custom should have its effect upon human\r\nnomenclature. How easy for a country community to create the distinction\r\nbetween ‘John le Rouse’ and ‘John le Black,’ ‘William le Hore’ and\r\n‘William le Sor’ or ‘Sorrell,’ if the complexion of the hair or face\r\nwere sufficiently distinctive to allow it. Some of these adjectives were\r\napplied to human peculiarities of this kind till within recent times.\r\nBurns uses ‘lyart’ for locks of iron grey, and Aubyn, in his ‘Lives,’\r\ndescribes Butler, author of ‘Hudibras,’ as having ‘a head of sorrell\r\nhaire.’ We ourselves talk of ‘brunettes’ and ‘blondes,’ of ‘dark’ and\r\n‘fair.’ Thus it was then such sobriquets as ‘Philip le Sor,’ ‘Adam le\r\nMorell,’ ‘William le Favele’ or ‘Favell,’ ‘Walter le Bay’ or ‘Theobald\r\nle Bayard,’ ‘Henry le Dun’ or ‘Thomas le Lyard,’ arose. Thus was it our\r\n‘Rouses’ and ‘Russells,’ our ‘Brownes’[475] and ‘Brunes,’ with the\r\nobsolete ‘Brunman,’ or ‘Brunells’ and ‘Burnells,’ our ‘Whites’ and\r\n‘Whitemans,’ our ‘Hores’ and ‘Hoares,’ our ‘Greys’ and ‘Grissels’[476]\r\nsprang into being. Nor are these all. Our ‘Reeds,’ ‘Reids,’ and ‘Reads’\r\nare all but forms of the old ‘rede’ or red, once so pronounced;[477]\r\nwhile ‘Redman,’ when not a descendant of ‘Adam’ or ‘Thomas de Redmayne,’\r\nis the bequest of some ‘Robert’ or ‘John Redman’ of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Our ‘Swarts’ are but relics of the old ‘John le Swarte,’\r\napplied no doubt to the tawny or sunburnt face of its original owner.\r\nThe word was in common use at this time. In ‘Guy of Warwick’ we are\r\ntold:—\r\n\r\n                   His nek is greater than a bole,\r\n                   His body is swarter than ani cole.\r\n\r\nThe darker-hued countenances of our forefathers are immortalised also in\r\nsuch entries as ‘Reyner le Blake’ or ‘Stephen le Blak,’ now found as\r\n‘Blake’ and ‘Black,’ or ‘Elias le Blakeman’ or ‘Henry Blacman,’ now\r\n‘Blakeman’ and ‘Blackman’ respectively. ‘John le Blanc’ and ‘Warin\r\nBlench’ find themselves in the nineteenth century supported by our\r\n‘Blanks’ and ‘Blanches;’[478] while the descendants of such people as\r\n‘Amabilla le Blund,’ or ‘Walter le Blunt,’ or ‘Reginald le Blond,’ or\r\n‘Richard le Blount’ still preserve a memorial of their ancestry in such\r\nfamiliar forms as ‘Blund,’ ‘Blunt,’ ‘Blond,’ and ‘Blount.’ ‘Blanket’ and\r\n‘Blanchet,’ as fuller forms, we shall notice shortly, and ‘Blondin,’\r\n‘Blundell,’ and the immortalised but mythic ‘Blondel’ are but changes\r\nrung upon the others. Our ‘Fallows’ are but relics of the ‘Fales’ and\r\n‘Falemans’ of the Hundred Rolls. The somewhat pallid yellow they\r\nrepresented we still apply to park deer and untilled earth. We find it,\r\nhowever, used more personally in the ‘Knight’s Tale,’ where it is said\r\nof Arcite that he began to wax lean—\r\n\r\n                 His eye hollow, and grisly to behold,\r\n                 His hewe falew, and pale as ashen cold.\r\n\r\n‘Scarlet’ doubtless was a sobriquet given, as may have been some of the\r\nabove, from the colour of the dress, this being a very popular\r\ncomplexion of cloth in early days. Tripping it—\r\n\r\n                     In skerlet kyrtells, every one,\r\n\r\nwould be a familiar and pretty sight, no doubt, as the village maidens\r\nwent round to the tune of the fife and tabor at the rural feast or\r\ningathering, nor would umbrage be taken at the title. Several ‘Blues’\r\nare recorded in the more Norman-French form of ‘le Bleu.’ Whether they\r\nstill exist I am not quite sure, nor are we helped to any satisfactory\r\nconclusion by the epitaph which Mr. Lower wisely italicises, when he\r\nsays _it is said_ to exist in a church in Berkshire—\r\n\r\n                     Underneath this ancient pew\r\n                     Lieth the body of Jonathan Blue.\r\n           _N.B._—His name was ‘Black,’ but that wouldn’t do.\r\n\r\nThere may be more or less doubt as to the precise reference some of the\r\nabove-mentioned names bear to the physical peculiarities of their\r\nowners, whether to the complexion of the face, or the hair, or, as I\r\nhave lately hinted, to the dress. But in many other cases there can be\r\nno such controversy. For instance, no one can be in perplexity as to how\r\nour ‘Downyheads,’ ‘Rufheads,’[479] ‘Hardheads,’ ‘Whiteheads,’\r\n‘Redheads,’ ‘Flaxenheads,’[480] ‘Shavenheads,’ ‘Goldenheads,’\r\n‘Weaselheads,’[481] ‘Coxheads’ or ‘Cocksheads,’ and ‘Greenheads’ arose,\r\nmany of which, now extinct, were evidently intended to be obnoxious. Nor\r\nis there any greater difficulty in deciphering the meaning of such names\r\nas ‘Whitelock’ or ‘Whitlock,’ ‘Silverlock’ or ‘Blacklock.’ ‘Shakelock’\r\nseems to refer to some eccentricity on the part of the owner, unless it\r\nbe but a corruption of ‘Shacklock,’ a likely sobriquet for a gaoler,\r\nfrom the fetterlocks, once so termed, which he was wont to employ—\r\n\r\n          And bids his man bring out the fivefold twist,\r\n          His shackles, shacklocks, hampers, gyves, and chains.\r\n\r\n‘Whitehair,’[482] ‘Fairhair,’[483] and ‘Yalowhair,’ are equally\r\ntransparent. The latter was once a decidedly favourite hue, as I believe\r\nit is still, only we now say ‘golden.’[484] With the gross flattery so\r\ncommonly resorted to by courtier historians, every princess was\r\ndescribed as having yellow tresses. How they allowed themselves to be so\r\ncajoled is an equally historic mystery. Queen Elizabeth had more\r\nobsequious adulation uttered to her face, and possessed a greater\r\nstomach for it, than any other royal personage who ever sat upon or laid\r\nclaim to a crown, but nothing pleased her more than a compliment upon\r\nher golden locks, carroty as they really were. In a description of\r\nanother Elizabeth, the Queen of Henry VII., as she appeared before her\r\ncoronation, 1487, quoted by Mr. Way, it is said that she wore ‘her faire\r\nyellow hair hanging down pleyne behynd her back, with a calle of pipes\r\nover it,’ and further back still, when Chaucer would describe the beauty\r\nof Dame Gladness, he must needs finish off the portrayal by touching up\r\nher locks with the popular hue—\r\n\r\n                 Her hair was yellow, and clear shining,\r\n                 I wot no lady so liking.\r\n\r\n‘Yalowhair’ is obsolete, but in our ‘Fairfax’ is preserved a sobriquet\r\ncommemorative no doubt of the same favoured colour. In ‘Sir Gawayne’ we\r\nare told, after the alliterative style of the day, how ‘_fair_ fanning\r\n_fax_’ encircled the shoulders of the doughty warrior. In the ‘Townley\r\nMysteries,’ too, a demon is represented in one place as saying—\r\n\r\n                      A horne, and a Dutch axe,\r\n                        His sleeve must be flecked,\r\n                      A syde head, and a fare fax,\r\n                        His goune must be specked.\r\n\r\n‘Beard,’ once entered as ‘Peter Wi’-the-berd,’ or ‘Hugo cum-Barbâ,’\r\nstill thrives in our midst; and even ‘Copperbeard,’ ‘Greybeard,’\r\n‘Blackbeard,’[485] and ‘Whitebeard’ contrive to exist. ‘Redbeard’[486]\r\ntogether with ‘Featherbeard,’ ‘Eaglebeard,’ ‘Wisebeard,’ and\r\n‘Brownbeard,’[487] have long disappeared, and ‘Bluebeard,’ of whose\r\ndread existence we were, as children, only too awfully assured, has also\r\nleft no descendants; but this, I fancy, we gather from his history.\r\n‘Lovelock’ is a relic of the once familiar plaited and beribboned lock\r\nwhich I have already alluded to, as having been familiarly worn by our\r\nforefathers of the more exquisite type. To the same peculiar, if not\r\neffeminate propensity, we owe, I doubt not, ‘Locke’ (‘Nicol Locke,’ A.)\r\nitself, not to mention ‘Curl’ (‘Marcus Curle,’ Z.) and ‘Crisp’\r\n(‘Reginald le Crispe,’ J.). The former of these two, however, seems to\r\ndenote the natural waviness, the latter the artificial production. In\r\nthe poem from which I have but just quoted we find the same hero\r\ndescribed as having his hair—\r\n\r\n         Well crisped and cemmed (combed) with knots full many,\r\n\r\nand a memorial of the fashion still lingers in the ‘crisping pins’ of\r\nour present Bible version. In the Hundred Rolls appears the sobriquet of\r\n‘Prikeavant.’ This, as Mr. Lower proves, lingered on till the close at\r\nleast of the seventeenth century, in the form of ‘Prick-advance.’[488] I\r\ncannot agree with him, however, that it arose as a mere spur-expression.\r\nI doubt not it is but the earlier form of the later ‘pickedevaunt,’ the\r\npointed or spiked beard so much in vogue in mediæval times. The word\r\noccurs in the ‘Taming of a Shrew’—\r\n\r\n              Boy, oh! disgrace to my person! Sounes, boy,\r\n              Of your face! You have many boys with such\r\n              Pickedevaunts, I am sure.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more natural than for such a custom as this to find\r\nitself memorialised in our nomenclature. Exaggeration in the habit would\r\neasily affix the name upon the wearer, and though not very euphonious as\r\na surname, the popularity of the usage would take from its\r\nunpleasantness. This also will explain ‘Thomas Stykebeard,’ found in the\r\nH.R. at this time. But let us turn for a moment to an opposite\r\npeculiarity. Though we often talk of getting our heads polled, few, I\r\nimagine, reflect that our ‘Pollards’ must have obtained their title from\r\ntheir well-shorn appearance. It is with them, therefore, we must set our\r\n‘Notts,’ ‘Notmans,’ and doubtless some of our ‘Knotts.’ The term ‘nott’\r\nwas evidently synonymous with ‘shorn,’ and to have a nothead was to have\r\nthe hair closely cut all round the head. It is still commonly done in\r\nsome parts of the country among the peasantry. Chaucer, describing the\r\n‘Yeoman,’ says—\r\n\r\n                A not-hed hadde he, with a browne visage.\r\n\r\nAndrew Boorde, too, later on, writing of the ‘Mores whyche do dwel in\r\nBarbary,’ says: ‘They have gret lyppes and nottyd heare, black and\r\ncurled.’[489] The name as a sobriquet is very common in the old\r\nregisters. Among other instances may be mentioned ‘Henry le Not’ and\r\n‘Herbert le Notte’ in the ‘Placitorum’ at Westminster. Nature, however,\r\ndid for our ‘Callows’ what art had done for the latter. The term is\r\nwritten ‘calewe’ with our earlier writers, and in this form is found as\r\na surname in 1313, one ‘Richard le Calewe,’ or bald-headed, occurring in\r\nthe Parliamentary Writs for that year. We still talk of fledgelings as\r\n‘callow young.’ From its Latin root ‘calvus,’[490] and through the\r\nFrench ‘chauve,’ we get also the early ‘John le Chauf,’ ‘Geoffrey le\r\nCauf,’ and ‘Richard le Chaufyn’—forms which still abide with us in our\r\n‘Corfes’ and ‘Caffins.’ Our ‘Balls’ are manifestly sprung from some\r\n‘Custance Balde’ or ‘Richard Bald.’ But there is yet one more name to be\r\nmentioned in this category, that of ‘Peel’ or ‘Peile,’ descended, as it\r\ndoubtless is in many cases, from such folk as ‘Thomas le Pele’ or\r\n‘William le Pyl.’\r\n\r\n                    As pilled as an ape was his crown\r\n\r\nis the not very complimentary description Chaucer gives of the Miller of\r\nTrumpington. It is but the same word as occurs in our Authorised Version\r\nof Ezekiel xxix. 18, where it is said: ‘Every head was made bald, and\r\nevery shoulder was peeled.’ In Isaiah xviii. 2, too, we read of a\r\n‘nation scattered and peeled,’ the marginal reading being ‘outspread and\r\npolished.’[491] Used as a surname, it seems to have denoted that glossy\r\nsmoothness, that utter guiltlessness of capillary protection which\r\nbelongs only to elderly gentlemen, and even then to but a few.[492]\r\n\r\nIt can be no matter of astonishment to us, when we reflect upon it, that\r\nour nomenclature should owe so much to this one single specialty of the\r\nhuman physique. The face is the mark of all recognition among men, and\r\nhow much of its character belongs to the simple appanage we have been\r\nspeaking of we may easily gather from the difference the slightest\r\nchange in the style of dressing or cutting it makes among those with\r\nwhom we are most familiar. Looking back at what has been recorded, what\r\na living proof they afford us of the truth of Horace Smith’s assertion\r\nthat surnames ‘ever go by contraries.’ The art of colouring may be\r\nhereditary, but certainly not the dyes themselves. Who ever saw a\r\n‘Whytehead’ who was not dark, or a ‘Blacklock’ who was not a blonde? Who\r\never saw reddish hair on a ‘Russell,’ or a swarthy complexion on a\r\n‘Morell’? How invariably does it happen that our ‘Lightfoots’ are gouty,\r\nand our ‘Hales’ dyspeptic, our ‘Bigges’ are manikins, and our ‘Littles’\r\ngiants. Such are the tricks that Time plays with us. Recorded history\r\ngives us the slow development of change in the habits and customs of\r\ndomestic life, but here we can compare the physical shifts of the family\r\nitself. As history and everything else, however, are said to repeat\r\nthemselves, we may comfort or condole with, as the case may require,\r\nthose who, if this dictum, like the Pope’s, be infallible, shall some\r\ntime or other return to their primitive hues and original proportions.\r\n\r\n     (3) _Nicknames from Peculiarities of Dress and Accoutrements._\r\n\r\nAn interesting peep into the minuter details of mediæval life is given\r\nus in the case of names derived from costume and ensigncy, whether\r\npeaceful or warlike. The colour of the cloth of which the dress was\r\ncomposed seems to have furnished us with several surnames. For instance,\r\nour ‘Burnets’ would seem to be associated with the fabric of a brown\r\nmixture common at one period. Our great early poet, in describing\r\nAvarice, says—\r\n\r\n                   A mantle hung her faste by\r\n                   Upon a benche weak and small,\r\n                   A burnette cote hung there withall,\r\n                   Furred with no minevere,\r\n                   But with a furre rough of hair.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with our ‘Burrels’ (‘Roger Burell,’ J., ‘Robert Burell,’\r\nR.), whom I have already had occasion to mention. So familiar was this\r\ncloth that the poorer classes acquired from it the sobriquet of\r\n‘borelfolk.’ This is only analogous to the French ‘grisette,’ from the\r\ngrey cheap stuff she usually wore. Our ‘Blankets’ (‘Robert Blanket,’ B.,\r\n‘John Blanket,’ X.) or ‘Blanchets’ or ‘Plunkets,’[493] for all these\r\nforms are found, are in the same way but relics of the time when the\r\ncolourless woollen mixture, called by all these names, was in everyday\r\ndemand, whether for dress or coverlet. A story has been spread abroad\r\nthat our woollen ‘blanket’ owes its origin to a man of that name, who\r\nfirst manufactured it. Even otherwise well-informed writers have lent\r\nthemselves to the furtherance of this fable. ‘Blanket’ was originally\r\nthe name of a cheap woollen cloth, used for the apparel of the lower\r\norders, and so entitled from its pale and colourless hue, just as\r\n_russet_ and _burrel_ were in vogue to express similar manufactures of\r\nmore decided colours. It was but the Norman form of the Saxon ‘whittle,’\r\nonce the household word for this fabric. Thus we find it occurring in an\r\nold Act, already referred to, passed in 1363, to restrict the dress of\r\nthe peasantry:—All people not possessing 40 shillings’ worth of goods\r\nand chattels ‘ne usent nule manere de drap, si noun blanket et russet,\r\nlaune de xii_d._,’ that is, shall not take nor wear any manner of cloth,\r\nbut blanket and russet wool of twelvepence. (_Stat. Realm_, vol. i. p.\r\n381.) An old indenture of goods contains the following:—‘Item, 1 olde\r\nKendale gowne, and a hood of the same, pris ix_d._, the gowne lynyd with\r\nwhite blanket.’ (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._, p. 566.) Both ‘Whittle’ and\r\n‘Blanket’ are existing surnames. The reader will see from these\r\nreferences alone that, whether in the case of the man or the\r\nmanufacture, it is the colour, or rather lack of colour, which has given\r\nthe sobriquet. Our ‘Greenmans,’ whether as surname or tavern sign, are\r\nbut sprung from the old forester—\r\n\r\n                     Clad in cote and hode of grene,\r\n\r\nof Lincoln or Kendal make. The ‘Greenman’ was a favourite rural\r\nsignboard, and I doubt not the reader will have seen it occasionally\r\nswinging still in the more retired parts of the country. Crabbe knew it\r\nwell in his day—\r\n\r\n              But the ‘Green Man’ shall I pass by unsung,\r\n              Which mine own James upon his signpost hung?\r\n              His sign, his image—for he once was seen\r\n              A squire’s attendant, clad in keeper’s green.\r\n\r\nTurning from the colour of the cloth to the garments into which it was\r\nfashioned, nothing could be more natural to our forefathers than to take\r\noff with a sobriquet the more whimsical aspects of dress indulged in by\r\nparticular individuals. Royalty itself did not escape. It was through\r\nhis introduction of a new fashion our second Henry got his nickname of\r\n‘Curtmantel,’ and this was matched by ‘Capet’ and ‘Grisegonel’ across\r\nthe water. ‘Richard Curtepy’ reminds us of the poor clerk of whom\r\nChaucer says—\r\n\r\n                Full thredbare was his overest courtepy,\r\n\r\nthat is, his cloak or gabardine. ‘Henry Curtmantle,’ just mentioned,\r\n‘Martin Curtwallet,’ and ‘Robert Curthose’ (still existing in Derbyshire\r\nin the more Saxon form of ‘Shorthose’),[494] satirise the introduction\r\nof a curtailment in the general as ‘Reginald Curtbrant’ does in the more\r\nmilitary habit; ‘Richard Widehose’ and the Scotch ‘Macklehose,’ on the\r\nother hand, suggesting a change of an opposite and more sailorlike\r\ncharacter. ‘Hose,’ itself a surname, is again found in composition in\r\n‘Richard Goldhose,’ ‘Nicholas Strokehose,’ ‘John Scrothose’\r\n(‘Scratchhose,’), and ‘Richard Letherhose;’ the latter still to be met\r\nwith in Germany as ‘Ledderhose.’ ‘Emma Wastehose,’ though now obsolete,\r\nevidently bespoke the reckless habits of the wearer, while ‘John\r\nSprenhose’ (_i.e._, ‘Spurnhose’) seems to have declared its owner’s want\r\nof appreciation of that article altogether. The old ‘paletoque’ or\r\ndoublet, a loose kind of frock often worn by priests, left itself a\r\nmemorial in ‘Thomas Pyletok,’ which is now extinct, but ‘Pylch’ (‘Symon\r\nPylche,’ A.), the maker of which has already been mentioned, remains\r\nhale and hearty in our midst. ‘Mantel’ (‘Walter Mantel,’ L.) and\r\n‘Fremantel’[495] are well established among us, the latter probably\r\nowing its origin to the frieze-cloth which the Frieslander of the Low\r\nCountries once manufactured out of our own wool. It is Latinized in our\r\nrecords into ‘Hugh de Frigido-Mantello,’ and the cloth itself as\r\n‘Frisius pannus.’[496] The herald’s tunic, barely covering the chest and\r\nopen from the shoulder downwards, gave us our ‘Tabards.’ It must have\r\nhad plenty of last in it, for Piers Plowman talks of—\r\n\r\n                  A tawny tabard of twelf wynters age.\r\n\r\nThe variegated dress, much in favour then apparently, still survives in\r\nour ‘Medlecote’ and ‘Medlicott.’[497] The stuffed doublet gave us\r\n‘Thomas Gambeson,’ now perhaps ‘Gamson,’ while the short petticoat is\r\nmemorialised in ‘John Grenecurtel.’ ‘Alicia Caperon’ and ‘Thomas\r\nChaperoun’ are early found. The _chaperon_ was a hood by which the\r\nentire face could be concealed if it were so desired. Taylor, in the\r\nseventeenth century, mentions it as but recently out of fashion—\r\n\r\n             Her _shapperoones_, her periwigs and tires,\r\n             Are reliques which this flattery much admires.\r\n\r\nIt is thus, by a somewhat strange but easy association of ideas, has\r\ncome our modern protector in society so called.\r\n\r\nExcess of apparel has often in olden days been under penal statute.\r\nChaucer, in his time, decried its abuse, and an old rhyme of Edward III.\r\ndate is still preserved, which is scathing enough—\r\n\r\n                       Longbeards, heartlesse,\r\n                       Painted hoods, witlesse,\r\n                       Gaycoates, gracelesse,\r\n                       Makes England thriftlesse.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded in this of ‘Gai-cote’ (‘William Gaicote,’ A.), which\r\nonce was a surname, though now extinct. ‘Woolward’ or ‘Woolard’\r\n(‘Geoffey Woleward,’ A., ‘Reginald Wolleward,’ N.) still thrives. To go\r\n‘woolward’ was to undergo the penance of wearing the outer woollen cloth\r\nwithout any linen under-dress. It was often prescribed by the\r\npriesthood. Piers, in his Vision, says—\r\n\r\n                        _Wolleward_ and weetshoed\r\n                        Wente I forth;\r\n\r\nwhile another old poem bids us—\r\n\r\n                  Faste, and go _wolward_, and wake,\r\n                  And suffre hard for Godys sake.[498]\r\n\r\nThe name was not an unfrequent one at the time of which I am writing,\r\nand I doubt not was oftentimes familiarly applied to friars. We must\r\nprobably refer to more warlike accoutrements for the origin of our\r\n‘Gantletts’ or ‘Gauntletts’ (‘Henry Gauntelett,’ Z., ‘Roger Gauntlet,’\r\nZ.), our ‘Pallets’ and ‘Vizards.’ The latter was that part of the helmet\r\nwhich was perforated for the wearer to see through, ‘pallet’ being the\r\ngeneral term for the helmet itself. ‘Ranulf Strong-bowe’ was a likely\r\nsobriquet for a brawny-armed bowman to acquire, and, like ‘Isabella\r\nFortiscue’ (brave shield) and ‘Emelina Longespee,’ belongs to more\r\ngeneral history. ‘Sword,’ ‘Buckler,’ ‘Lance,’[499] ‘Spear,’ ‘Pike,’\r\n‘Bill,’ the renowned ‘Brownbill,’ and others too many for enumeration,\r\nhave similarly found a place in our nomenclature. What a revolution in\r\nthe mode of warfare do they betoken. What a sweeping change has the\r\ninvention of gunpowder effected on the battlegrounds of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut I mentioned ‘badges.’ It is amusing to see how the early love of\r\ndistinctive ensigns has made its mark here. While it is an English\r\ninstinct to reverence authority, this authority itself has ever been\r\ndistinguished by the outward manifestation of dress and emblem. The\r\nceremonious requirements of the feudal state have had their effect. As I\r\nendeavoured to show in a previous chapter, these were simply\r\noverwhelming. The office of each was not more distinct than his outward\r\naccompaniments, and it was by the latter his precise position was known.\r\nThe ‘baton,’ however, seems to have held the foremost place as a token\r\nof authority—a sword, a javelin, a spear, a wand, a rod, it mattered not\r\nwhat, a something borne in the hand, and you might have known in that\r\nday an official. Nor are we as yet free from its influence. Royalty\r\nstill has its sceptre, the Household of State its ‘black rod,’\r\nmagistracy has its mace, proctorship its poker, the churchwarden his\r\nstaff, the beadle—far the most important of all to the charity children\r\nand himself—his stick. From official, this rage for badges seems to have\r\npassed on to the quieter and more ordinary avocations. The shepherd was\r\nnot better known by his crook, the huntsman not better known by his\r\nhorn, than the pilgrim by his ‘bourdon,’ the woodward by his ‘bill,’ or\r\nthe surveyor by his ‘meteyard’[500] or ‘metewand.’ How easy then for all\r\nthese words to be turned into sobriquets. How natural they should become\r\nslang epithets for those who carried them. How natural that we should\r\nfind them all in our directories. ‘Meatyard,’ ‘Burdon’ or ‘Bourdon,’\r\n‘Crook,’ ‘Wand,’ ‘Staff,’ ‘Rodd,’ ‘Horne,’[501] all are there. Nor did\r\nthe personal characteristics of such bearers escape the good-humoured\r\nraillery of our ancestors. Far from it. ‘Waghorn,’[502] would easily fix\r\nitself upon some awkward horn-blower; ‘Wagspear’ (‘Mabill Wagspere,’ W.\r\n1.), or ‘Shakespeare’ (‘William Shakespeare,’ V. 1.), or\r\n‘Shakeshaft’[503] or ‘Drawsword’ (‘Henry Drawswerde,’ A.), or ‘Drawespe’\r\n(‘Thomas Drawespe,’ A.) upon some over-demonstrative sergeant or clearer\r\nof the way; or ‘Wagstaffe’ (‘Robert Waggestaff,’ A.) on some obnoxious\r\nbeadle.[504] ‘Tipstaffe’ we know for certain as a name of this class—he\r\nwas a bumbailiff. In 1392 one Roger Andrew was publicly indicted for\r\npretending to be an officer of the Marshalsea, which he did by bearing a\r\n‘wooden staff with horn at either end, called a “tippestaffe.”’ It does\r\nnot seem, however, to have been confined only to him. Chaucer says of\r\nthe frère, that—\r\n\r\n               With scrippe, and tipped staf, tucked high\r\n               In every house he gan to pore and pry;\r\n\r\nand but two lines further on he tells us—\r\n\r\n                 His felaw had a staff tipped with horn,\r\n\r\nwhich thus explicitly explains the term. The same humour found vent in\r\n‘John Swyrdebrake,’[505] ‘Adrian Breakspear,’ ‘William Longstaffe,’\r\n‘Antony Halstaff’ (perchance ‘Hale-staff’),[506] and ‘Thomas Ploghstaf’\r\n(Plowstaff). With one or two more general terms of this class we may\r\nproceed. ‘Robert Hurlebat’[507] and ‘Matthew Winspear,’ ‘Richard\r\nSpurdaunce’ and ‘Robert Bruselance,’ ‘Simon Lovelaunce’ and ‘Thomas\r\nCrakyshield,’[508] ‘Roger Benbow,’ ‘Cicely Brownsword,’ and ‘Thomas\r\nShotbolte,’ are evidently nicknames fastened upon certain individuals\r\nfor special prowess in some of the sports of the Middle Ages, probably\r\nat some church-ale or wakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II.—MENTAL AND MORAL PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\n    (1) _Nicknames from Peculiarities of Disposition—Complimentary._\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the varied characteristics of the human heart. If we\r\nwish to know how many good and excellent qualities there are in the\r\nworld, and at the same time deceive ourselves into a belief that the\r\nevils are few, we must look into our directories. Scan their contents,\r\nand we might almost persuade ourselves that Utopia was a fact, and that\r\nwe were consulting its muster-roll. At every turn we meet with virtue in\r\nthe guise of a ‘Goode,’ or an ‘Upright,’ or a ‘Righteous,’[509] or a\r\n‘Patient,’ or a ‘Best,’ or a ‘Faithful;’ or infallibility in a ‘Perfect’\r\nor ‘Faultless.’ We are ever coming across philosophy in the shape of a\r\n‘Wise’ or a ‘Sage.’ Conscience must surely trouble but little, where\r\n‘Merry’ and ‘Gay,’ ‘Blythe’ and ‘Joyce,’ that is, joyous, are all but\r\ninterminable; and companionship must be ever sweet with such people to\r\nconverse with as ‘Makepeace’[510] and ‘Friend,’ ‘Goodhart’ and ‘Truman,’\r\n‘True’ and ‘Leal,’ ‘Kind’ and ‘Curtis’ or ‘Curteis.’ ‘Fulhardy’ and\r\n‘Giddyhead,’ ‘Cruel’ and ‘Fierce,’ ‘Wilfulle’ and ‘Sullen,’ and\r\n‘Envious’ did indeed find a habitation in its pages, but they have long\r\nsince disappeared, being quite out of place in the presence of such\r\nbetter folk as ‘Hardy’[511] and ‘Grave,’ and ‘Gentle’ and ‘Sweet;’ or if\r\nthe cloven foot of pride be still visible in ‘Proud’ and ‘Proudfoot,’ it\r\nis nevertheless under constant rebuke by our familiarity with such lowly\r\ncharacters as ‘Humble’ and ‘Meek.’[512] Nevertheless, this was anything\r\nbut so in the old time. The evil roots of sin may still abide hale and\r\nstrong and ineradicable in the heart of man, but he has carefully weeded\r\nthe more apparent traces of this out of his nomenclature. I do not mean\r\nto say we are utterly without names of objectionable import, but we\r\nshall see that what I have stated once before is true in the main. We\r\nshall see that as a rule it is only when the sobriquet word has changed\r\nits meaning, or that meaning become obscure and doubtful, or when the\r\nname itself has lost the traces of its origin—easy enough in the lapse\r\nof so many days of unsettled orthography—that the surname has lingered\r\non. This will make itself apparent as we advance.\r\n\r\nSuch names as ‘Walter Snel,’ ‘Richard Quicke’ (A.), including the\r\nimmortal Quickly, ‘Richard le Smert’ (M.), now ‘Smart,’ ‘Thomas Scharp,’\r\nnow ‘Sharp,’[513] ‘Gilbert Poygnant’ (A.), ‘Thedric le Witte’ (A.), now\r\n‘Witt’ and ‘Witty,’ ‘Nicholas le Cute’ (A.), and ‘Ralph le Delivre’[514]\r\n(M.M.), argue well for the keen perceptions and brisk habits of early\r\ndays.[515] The slang sense of several of these, strangely enough, is but\r\nthe original meaning restored. ‘Witty’ arose when the word implied\r\nkeenness of intellect rather than of humour. Chaucer thus speaks of\r\n‘witty clerkes,’ using the latter word too in a perfectly unofficial\r\nsense. Our numberless ‘Clarkes’ and ‘Clerkes,’ sprung from equally\r\nnumberless ‘Beatrix le Clercs’ or ‘Milo le Clerks,’ may therefore belong\r\neither to the professional class or to the one we are considering.\r\n‘William le Frek’ (M.) or ‘Ralph Frike’ (A.), now found as ‘Freak,’\r\n‘Frick,’ and ‘Freke,’ was a complimentary sobriquet implicative of\r\nbravery and daring even to rashness.[516] Minot in his political songs\r\ntells us in alliterative verse how the doughty men of Edward the Third’s\r\narmy were—\r\n\r\n                           Ful frek to fight.\r\n\r\nThe old ‘William le Orpede,’ or ‘Stephen le Horpede,’ or ‘Peter\r\nOrpedeman’ denotes a disposition equally stout-hearted.[517] It is a\r\nterm found in well-nigh all our mediæval writers, and was evidently in\r\ncommon and familiar use. Trevisa, in his account of the Norman invasion,\r\nrepresents ‘Gurth’ as saying to Harold, ‘Why wilt thou unwary fight with\r\nso many orped men?’ The monk of Glastonbury also, speaking of Edward the\r\nThird’s expedition to Calais in 1350, relates that he ‘towke with him\r\nthe nobleis, and the gentelles, and other worthi and orpedde menne of\r\narmes.’ Our ‘Keats’ and ‘Ketts’ are the old ‘Walter le Ket’ (G.) or\r\n‘Osbert le Ket’ (J.), that is, the fierce, the bold. Thus the cowherd in\r\n‘William of Pelerne’ directs the child how to conduct himself—\r\n\r\n                        When thou komest to kourt\r\n                        Among the kete lordes.\r\n\r\nWith these therefore we may associate ‘William le Prew,’ now\r\n‘Prew,’[518] ‘Nicholas Vigerous,’ now found also as ‘Vigors,’ ‘Helen\r\nGallant,’ ‘John le Stallworth,’[519] ‘Thomas Doughtye,’ and ‘Robert le\r\nBolde,’ all still well-known names. ‘Prest,’ ‘Peter le Prest’ (M.), when\r\nnot the archaic form of ‘Priest,’ is of kin to the mountebank’s\r\n‘presto,’ and means—quick, ready. It was thus used till the seventeenth\r\ncentury. ‘Kean,’ found as ‘Hugh le Kene’ or ‘Joan le Kene,’ implies\r\nimpetuosity. All these names speak well for the pluck of our\r\nforefathers. They are found with tolerable frequency, and naturally have\r\nnot been suffered to die out for lack of pride. The Norman element, as\r\nwe see, is strong in these chivalrous sobriquets. Nor is it less so with\r\nmany other terms of no unpleasant meaning. Our ‘Purefoys’ or ‘Purfeys’\r\nrepresent the _pure faith_ of their countrymen.[520] Our ‘Parfitts’ are\r\nbut the quainter form of ‘Perfect.’[521] Our ‘Bones,’ ‘Boons,’ and\r\n‘Bunns’ are but variously corrupted forms of ‘Duran le Bon,’ or ‘Richard\r\nle Bone,’ or ‘Alice le Bonne,’ or ‘William le Boon,’ equivalent\r\ntherefore to the earlier ‘Goods.’ ‘Bunker’ is similarly but ‘Bon-cœur’\r\n(‘William Bonquer,’ O.),[522] our Saxon ‘Goodhart,’ and ‘Bonner,’ and\r\nthe longer ‘Debonaire’ (‘Philip le Debeneyre,’ A.),[523] our more\r\nnaturalized ‘Gentle’ (‘William le Gentil,’ M.), ‘Gentilman’ (‘Robert\r\nGentilman,’ V. 1.),[524] and ‘Curteis’ or ‘Curtis’ (‘Walter le Curteys’\r\nJ., ‘Richard le Curteis,’ C.), Chaucer says—\r\n\r\n                    All men holde thee for musarde,\r\n                    That debonaire have founden thee.\r\n\r\n‘Amiable’ (‘Edward Amiable,’ Z., ‘Joan Amiable,’ Z.) once existed, but\r\nin our registers, at least, that sweet grace is now wanting. Equivalent\r\nto these latter, but more Saxon in character, come our ‘Hendys’ or\r\n‘Hentys’ (‘Thomas le Hendy,’ F.F., ‘John le Hendy,’ F.F.), a term found\r\nin all our early writers, and prettily expressive of that which was\r\ngentle and courteous combined. In the ‘Canterbury Tales’ the host\r\nreproves the friar for lack of civility to one of the company by saying—\r\n\r\n                            Sire, ye should be _hende_,\r\n                  And curteis as a man of your estate,\r\n                  In company we will have no debate.\r\n\r\nIn the Hundred Rolls we find a ‘William Hendiman’ occurring, and a ‘John\r\nHende’ was Lord Mayor of London in 1391. We have just mentioned the word\r\n‘musarde.’ This reminds us of our ‘Musards’ (‘Malcolm le Musard,’ M.),\r\nwho were originally of a dreamy temperament.[525] With our Saxon\r\n‘Moodys’[526] (‘Richard Mody,’ G.), however, their title has fallen in\r\ngeneral estimation, the one now denoting, when used at all, a trifling,\r\nthe other a morose and gloomy disposition. Our ‘Sadds’ (‘Robert Sad,’\r\nH.), too, from being merely serious, sedate folk, have become sorrowful\r\nof heart. Our great early poet speaks in the negative sense of—\r\n\r\n                      People unsad and eke untrue,\r\n\r\nthat is, unstable and fickle. In a short poem, ascribed to Lydgate,\r\npointing out to children their course of behaviour in company, we are\r\ntold—\r\n\r\n             Who spekithe to thee in any maner place,\r\n             Rudely cast not thyn eye adowne,\r\n             But with a sad cheer look hym in the face.[527]\r\n\r\nHere of course sobriety of demeanour, rather than sorrowfulness, is\r\nintended.[528] That ‘Henry le Wepere’ (A.), and ‘Peter le Walur’ (A.),\r\nand ‘William le Blubere’ (A.), however, must have been of rueful\r\ncountenance we need not doubt.\r\n\r\nMany changes too have passed over the names as well doubtless as over\r\nthe lives of another section of our nomenclatural community. Our\r\n‘Cunnings,’ we will hope, dated from the time when he who _kenned_ his\r\nwork well was so entitled without any suspicion of duplicity.[529] Very\r\nlikely too our ‘Slys’ (‘John Slye,’ H.), and ‘Sleighs’ (‘Simon le\r\nSlegh,’ M.), ‘Slees’ (‘Isabella Slee,’ W.G.), and ‘Slemmans’ and\r\nSlymans’ were simply remarkable for being honestly dexterous in their\r\nseveral avocations.[530] The ‘mighty hand and outstretched arm’ of\r\nmodern psalters was once translated ‘a hand that was slegh.’ But as\r\nslyness got by degrees but more and more associated with the juggler’s\r\nsleight-of-hand tricks, the word fell into disrepute. Such is the\r\ninvariable effect of keeping bad company. So late, however, as the\r\nseventeenth century, one of our commonwealth poets was not misunderstood\r\nwhen he spoke of one whom—\r\n\r\n                    Graver age had made wise and sly.\r\n\r\nBut the same predisposition to give ‘crafty’ and ‘sly’ and ‘cunning’ and\r\n‘artful’ a dishonest sense has not been therewith content, but must\r\nneeds throw ridicule upon the unsophisticated and artless natures of our\r\n‘Simples’ (‘Jordan le Simple,’ A.), who would scarcely feel complimented\r\nif their surname were to originate in the present day.[531] It is the\r\nsame with our ‘Seeleys’ (‘Benedict Sely,’ D.) and ‘Selymans’ (‘George\r\nSelyman,’ D.), the older forms of ‘Silly’ and ‘Sillyman.’ Perhaps the\r\nphrase ‘silly lamb’ is the only one in which we colloquially preserve\r\nthe former idea of ‘silly,’ that of utter guilelessness. A ‘silly\r\nvirgin’ with Spenser was no foolish maiden, but one helpless in her\r\ninnocence, and the ‘silly women’ Shakespeare hints at in his ‘Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona’ were but inoffensive and unprotected females.[532]\r\n‘Sealey,’ ‘Silly,’ ‘Sillyman,’ and ‘Selyman,’[533] are all pleasant\r\nmemorials of the earlier sense of this word. Our ‘Quaints’ and ‘Cants’\r\nhave gone through a changeful career. They are but the descendants of\r\nthe old ‘Margaret le Coynte’ or ‘Richard le Queynte,’ from the early\r\nFrench ‘coint,’ neat, elegant. A shadow fell over it, however, and a\r\nnotion of artfulness becoming attached to the word, to be quaint was to\r\nbe crafty. Thus Wicklyffe, in his translation of St. Mark’s account of\r\nChrist’s betrayal, makes Judas say to the servants of the high priest,\r\n‘Whomever I shall touch, he it is, hold ye him, and lead him warily, or\r\nqueintly.’ Thus, too, Lawrence Minot, in his ‘Political Songs,’ tells us\r\nhow—\r\n\r\n                 The King of Berne was _cant_ and kene,\r\n                 But there he lost both play and pride.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the word has well-nigh recovered its original sense,\r\nbetokening as it does a whimsical and antique prettiness, if not the\r\nbare quality itself. Our original ‘Careless’ (‘Antony Careless,’ Z.) was\r\nof that happy disposition which the petty worries and anxieties of life\r\ndo not easily disturb, and, to judge from our nomenclature, he forms but\r\none of a large band of cheery and easy-minded mortals. ‘Joyce,’ that is,\r\n‘Jocose,’ when not a Christian name,[534] and ‘Jolly’ must be set here,\r\nnot forgetting the older and prettier ‘Jolyffe’ (‘Henry Jolyffe,’ M.).\r\nIn the ‘Miller’s Tale’ we are told of ‘Absolon,’ how that when at\r\neventide he had taken up his ‘giterne’—\r\n\r\n                    Forth he goth, jolif and amorous,\r\n\r\nto the window of his lady-love. ‘Gay’ (‘William le Gay,’ R.), and\r\n‘Blythe’ (‘Richard Blythe,’ Z.),[535] and ‘Merry’ (‘William Merrye,’\r\nZ.), or ‘Merriman’ (‘John Meryman,’ X.), and ‘Gaillard,’ or ‘Gallard,’\r\nor ‘Gayliard,’ or ‘Gaylord’ (‘Nicholas Gaylard,’ T., ‘William Gallard,’\r\nA., ‘Sabina Gaylard,’ H.), must all be placed also in this\r\ncategory.[536] I am not quite sure, however, that the last are without a\r\nsuspicion of that conviviality which the buxom alewife was but too ready\r\nto bestow. Our merry, versatile friend Absolon, whom I have just\r\nreferred to, among other his unclerkly arts, could play on the ‘giterne’\r\nas well as any ‘galliard tapstere.’ It seems to have been a common\r\nepithet, and would readily find a place in our nomenclature, where it is\r\nnow firmly fixed. Our ‘Merryweathers’ (‘Andrew Meriweder,’ A.) and\r\n‘Fairweathers’ (‘John Fayrweder,’ A.)[537] may seem somewhat difficult\r\nof explanation to those who are unaware of the colloquial use of these\r\nexpressions in former times, ‘Mery-weder’ especially being of the most\r\nfamiliar import. In the ‘Coventry Mysteries’ mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                Bontyng the Brewster, and Sybyly Slynge,\r\n                Megge Mery-wedyr, and Sabyn Sprynge.\r\n\r\nA happy sunshiny fellow would easily acquire the sobriquet, and indeed\r\nboth are found at a very early day as such.[538]\r\n\r\nNot a few of those expressive terms of endearment, some of which still\r\nflourish in our nurseries, have made their mark upon our directories. We\r\nhave already alluded to our ‘Chittys.’ Our ‘Leafs’ represent the old\r\n‘Alice le Lef’ or ‘Matilda la Lef,’ beloved or dear. We still use it in\r\nthe well-nigh solitary expression ‘lief as loth,’ but once it was in\r\nfamiliar request. Robert of Brunne, in one of his stories, says—\r\n\r\n                 Blessed be alle poor men,\r\n                 For God Almyghty loveth them:\r\n                 And weyl is them that poor are here,\r\n                 They are with God bothe lefe and dere.\r\n\r\nAkin to this latter is ‘Love,’ which, when not the old ‘Robert le Love’\r\nor wolf, is found in composition in not a few instances. ‘Lovekin’ and\r\n‘Lovecock,’ after the remarks made in our first chapter on these\r\nterminations, will be readily explainable; and ‘Truelove,’ ‘Derelove,’\r\n‘Honeylove,’ and ‘Sweetlove’[539] supply us with expletives of so\r\namorous a nature, we can but conjecture them to have arisen through the\r\ntoo publicly proclaimed feelings of their early possessors. ‘Newlove’\r\nsounds somewhat inconstant, ‘Winlove’ attractive.[540] ‘Goodlove,’\r\n‘Spendlove,’ and ‘Likelove,’ I believe, are now obsolete—a lot, too,\r\nwhich has befallen the hardened ‘Lacklove,’ while our ‘Fulliloves’[541]\r\nstill declare the brimming affection which belongs to their nature—or at\r\nleast did to that of their progenitor. But even they are commonplace\r\nbeside our ‘Waddeloves’ or ‘Waddelows,’ the early form of which,\r\n‘Wade-in-love,’ would seem to tell of some lovesick ancestor so\r\nhelplessly involved in the meshes cast about him as to have become the\r\nobject of the unkind sarcasms of his neighbours. A longer and equally\r\ncurious sobriquet abides in our ‘Wellbeloveds’ and ‘Wellbiloves.’ It is\r\nthis latter form in which it is found in the ‘Issues of the\r\nExchequer.’[542] The French form of this was ‘Bienayme’ (‘William\r\nBienayme,’ A.), and to some settler of that name upon our shores I\r\nsuspect it is we owe our ‘Bonamys’ (‘William Bonamy,’ A.). I have just\r\nmentioned ‘Sweetlove.’ Associated with this are our simpler ‘Sweets,’\r\nthe nursery ‘Sweetcock,’ and ‘Sweetman,’[543] variously corrupted into\r\n‘Sweatman,’ ‘Swetman,’ and ‘Swatman.’ ‘Bawcock’ and ‘Baucock,’ if not\r\nfrom ‘Baldwin,’ will be the endearing ‘beau-coq,’ once in familiar use.\r\nOur ‘Follets,’ ‘Follits,’ and ‘Foliots,’ the last the original form,\r\nmeant nothing more than ‘my foolish one’ or ‘fond one,’ and were very\r\ncommon. They are but varied in the longer ‘Hugh Folenfaunt,’ but I am\r\nafraid ‘Walter Fulhardy’ at the same period is less complimentary.\r\n‘Poppet,’ or puppet, once the doll of English infancy, only remains in\r\nthe gilded and waxen manikins of the showman. The surname, however,\r\nabides with us, as does also ‘Poplett.’ The old ‘fere,’ a companion, has\r\nleft its mark in our ‘Fairs.’ We all remember Byron’s resuscitation of\r\nthe word. In ‘Troilus and Cressida,’ mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                     Orpheus and Euridice his fere.\r\n\r\nThus ‘Playfair,’ once written ‘Playfere,’ is simply ‘playfellow,’ while\r\nthe obsolete ‘Makefere’ (‘Hugh Makefare,’ A.) would seem to be but\r\nintensive, ‘make’ being the invariable dress with olden writers of our\r\nmore familiar ‘mate.’[544]\r\n\r\nThere is something in obtrusive virtue that instinctively repels us. We\r\nalways like a man’s face to be the index to the book of his heart, but\r\nwhen he would seem to have carefully turned down each leaf for our\r\ninspection, we get a revulsion of feeling—we like to look out the page\r\nfor ourselves. An elevated sense of self-esteem was decidedly approved\r\nof by our forefathers, but its too demonstrative exhibition soon showed\r\nitself condemned in our ‘Prouds,’ ‘Prouts,’ ‘Proudmans,’ ‘Proudloves,’\r\nand ‘Proudfoots’ (‘Hugh le Proud,’ A., ‘John le Prute,’ H., ‘George\r\nProudelove,’ Z.Z., ‘Robert Prudefot,’ A.). A very interesting name which\r\nhas escaped the notice of surname hunters is that of ‘Gerish’ or\r\n‘Gerrish,’ both forms being found in our modern directories. They are\r\nbut the truer representatives of the word ‘garish’ as used by our later\r\npoets. Shakespeare’s Juliet, we may remember, apostrophizes Night, and\r\nbids her, when Romeo be dead, cut him into stars, and thus—\r\n\r\n                All the world will be in love with night,\r\n                And pay no worship to the garish sun.\r\n\r\nThis splendidly describes the term, expressing as it does that which\r\nglares ostentatiously and showily upon the eye. Lydgate, far earlier,\r\nhad used it thus, in the form of ‘gerysshe;’ and such names as ‘Umfrey\r\nle Gerische’ or ‘John le Gerisse,’ found yet more remotely, testify to\r\nits once familiar and frequent use. We now talk of a prude as one who\r\nexaggerates woman’s innate modesty of demeanour. Formerly it denoted the\r\nvirtue pure and untravestied. The root, the Latin ‘probus,’ excellent,\r\nstill remains in our ‘Prudhommes’ (‘William Prodhomme,’ R., ‘Peter\r\nProdhomme,’ A.), with their more commonly corrupted ‘Pridhams’ and\r\n‘Prudames’ and ‘Prudens,’[545] a sobriquet which once referred simply to\r\nthe honest and guileless uprightness of their owners. How truly do such\r\nwords as these remind us of the poor estimate man, after all, forms of\r\nhimself. Man often rebels at the declaration of Revelation that he is a\r\nfallen being, and yet how strongly does he assert this fact in the\r\nchanges he himself has made in the meaning of words. Our ‘Bauds’\r\n(‘William le Baud,’ B., ‘Wauter le Baud,’ M.) were once but the Norman\r\nequivalent of our ‘Merrys’ already mentioned.[546] Must lightness of\r\nheart inevitably end in wanton levity? There was a day when our\r\n‘Parramores’ (‘Roger Paramour,’ M.; ‘Henry Parramore,’ Z.)[547] were but\r\nthe simple honest lover of either sex, when our ‘Lemons,’ ‘Lemans,’ and\r\n‘Lemmans’ (‘Eldred Leman,’ A., ‘John Leman,’ M.) meant but the beloved\r\none from ‘lief,’ ‘dear.’ Both Chaucer and Piers Plowman employ the term\r\n‘lef-man’ or ‘leef-man’ as an expression of endearment, with no thought\r\nof obloquy. Thus, too, in the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ God is represented as\r\nbidding Gabriel to go to Nazareth—\r\n\r\n                  And hail that madyn, my lemman,\r\n                  As heyndly (courteously) as thou can.\r\n\r\nStill, so early as the days of Gower, its corrupted _leman_ had become a\r\nsobriquet for one of loose, disorderly habits.[548]\r\n\r\n    (2) _Nicknames from Peculiarities of Disposition—Objectionable._\r\n\r\nThe mention of such names as ‘Baud,’ ‘Parramore,’ ‘Leman’ or ‘Lemon,’\r\n‘Proud,’ ‘Proudman,’ and ‘Proudfoot,’ which we have charitably set in\r\nthe list of complimentary nicknames, as having, perchance, risen at a\r\ntime when the meaning of the words conveyed a totally different idea\r\nfrom that which they now convey, brings us to the category of those\r\nwhich can scarcely seek any shelter of such a kind. ‘Lorel,’ ‘Lurdan,’\r\nand ‘Lordan,’ together with the once familiar ‘losel’ and ‘losard,’\r\ndenoted a waif, or stray, one who preyed upon society, exactly\r\nidentical, in fact, with the Latin ‘perditus.’ Thus we find Herod, in\r\nthe ‘Townley Mysteries,’ saying to his officers—\r\n\r\n           Fie, losels and lyars, lurdans each one,\r\n           Tratours and well worse, knaves, but knyghts none.\r\n\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle,’ too, speaks of—\r\n\r\n                  Lollers, lordaynes, and fagot berers,\r\n                  Luskes, slovens, and kechen knaves.\r\n\r\nCotgrave explains a ‘loricard’ to mean a _luske_, _lowt_, or _lorell_.\r\nThis _luske_, from the old French _lasque_, or _lache_—slothful—though\r\nnow wholly obsolete, did much duty formerly. The adjective _luskish_ and\r\nthe substantive _luskishness_ are often found. In law _lache_ still\r\nsurvives as a term for culpable remissness. Our ‘Laches,’ ‘Lashes,’\r\n‘Laskies,’ and ‘Lusks,’ I am afraid, therefore, come of but an\r\nindifferent ancestry. Nor can anything better be said of our ‘Paillards’\r\nor ‘Pallards.’ We still talk of a ‘pallet,’ the old ‘paillet,’ or straw\r\nbed, from ‘paille,’ chaff. A paillard was a cant term for a lie-a-bed.\r\n\r\nBy ‘ribaldry’ we always mean that which is foul-mouthed in expression.\r\nThis was ever its implication. A ‘ribaud,’ or ‘ribaut’ belonged to the\r\nvery scum of society. He was a man who hung on to the skirts of the\r\nnobility by doing all their more infamous work for them. Chaucer,\r\nwishing to comprise in one sentence the highest and the lowest grades of\r\nsociety, speaks in his ‘Romance’ of ‘king, knighte, or ribaude.’\r\n‘William le Ribote,’ therefore, mentioned in the ‘Chapter House Records\r\nof Westminster,’ or ‘William Ribaud’ (W. 15), could not have borne the\r\nbest of characters, I am afraid. Although not quite so degraded in the\r\nworld’s esteem as some of these last, we may here include our\r\n‘Gedlings,’ reminiscences of the old ‘Gadling’ or ‘Gedling,’ one who\r\ngadded about from door to door to talk the gossip and scandal—the modern\r\ntattler, in fact. Our former ‘Gerard le Gaburs’ and ‘Stephen le Gabbers’\r\nwere equally talkative, if not such ramblers. As overmuch talking and\r\njesting always beget a suspicion of overstretching the truth, so was it\r\nhere. Wicklyffe uses ‘gabbing’ in the sense of lying, and an old poem\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n                     Alle those false chapmen\r\n                       The fiend them will habbe,\r\n                     Bakeres and breowares\r\n                       For alle men they gabbe.[549]\r\n                            (_A litel soth Sermun._)\r\n\r\nIn the North of England, I need scarcely add, this is the ordinary and\r\ncolloquial sense of the term to the present day. The name of ‘John\r\nTotiller’ might well-nigh induce us to believe that teetotalism was not\r\nunknown by that name at this period, but it is not so. A ‘totiller’ was\r\na ‘whisperer’ of secrets. In the ‘Legend of Good Women,’ one says to the\r\nGod of Love—\r\n\r\n                  In ye court is many a losengeour\r\n                  And many a queinte totoler accusour.\r\n\r\nThe name of ‘Dera Gibelot’ or ‘John Gibbelote’[550] reminds us of a term\r\nnow obsolete, but once familiar as denoting a giddy, flighty girl.[551]\r\nIt is found in various forms, the commonest being that of ‘giglot.’[552]\r\nMr. Halliwell quotes an old proverb by way of adding a further\r\nvariation—\r\n\r\n               The smaller pesun (peas), the more to pott,\r\n               The fayrer woman the more gylott.\r\n\r\nI would, however, suggest this as but the pet form of ‘Gill,’ mentioned\r\nin my chapter on Christian names. In either case the meaning is the\r\nsame. An often met with sobriquet in the fourteenth century is that of\r\n‘Robert le Burgulion,’ or ‘Geoffrey le Burgillon,’ the old term for a\r\nbraggart. It is now, however, wholly obsolete. ‘Robert le Lewed,’ or\r\n‘William le Lewed,’ is also lost to our directories, and certainly would\r\nbe an unpleasant appellation in the nineteenth century. Its general\r\nmeaning four hundred years ago, however, was its more literal one, that\r\nof simplicity or ignorance. It is connected with our word ‘lay’ as\r\nopposed to ‘cleric,’ and arose at a time when knowledge was all but\r\nentirely in the hands of the clergy. Thus in the ‘Pardoner’s Tale’ it is\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n               Lewed people loven tales olde,\r\n               Such things can they wel report and holde.\r\n\r\nSuch a name then, we may trust, implied nothing beyond a lack of\r\nknowledge in respect of its possessor. ‘William Milksop,’ or ‘Thomas\r\nMilkesop,’ or ‘Maurice Ducedame’ were but types of a class of dandified\r\nand effeminate beings who have ever existed, but even their names would\r\nbe more acceptable than those which fell to ‘Robert le Sot,’ or ‘Maurice\r\nDruncard,’ or ‘Jakes Drynk-ale,’[553] or ‘Geoffrey Dringkedregges,’[554]\r\nor ‘Thomas Sourale.’[555] It is evident that there were those who were\r\ndisposed to follow the dictate of at least one portion of the old rhyme—\r\n\r\n                    Walke groundly, talke profoundly,\r\n                    Drinke roundly, sleape soundly.\r\n\r\n‘Ralph Sparewater,’ I fear, was a man of dirty habits, while ‘John\r\nKlenewater’ was a model of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done with sobriquets of an unpleasant nature. Men of\r\nmiserly and penurious habits seem to have flourished in plentiful force\r\nin olden days as well as the present. ‘Irenpurse’ figures several times\r\nin early rolls, and would be a strong, if somewhat rough, sarcasm\r\nagainst the besetting weakness of its first possessor. ‘Lovegold’ is\r\nequally explicable. ‘Pennifather,’ however, was the favourite title of\r\nsuch. An old couplet says—\r\n\r\n                   The liberall doth spend his pelfe,\r\n                   The pennyfather wastes himself.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the various forms of ‘Penifader,’ ‘Panyfader,’ and\r\n‘Penifadir,’ in the fourteenth century. ‘Pennypurse,’[556] ‘Halfpeny,’\r\nand ‘Turnpeny’[557] are met with at the same time, and somewhat later on\r\n‘Thickpeny.’ ‘Broadpeny,’ ‘Manypenny,’ now corrupted into ‘Moneypeny,’\r\n‘Winpeny,’ now also found as ‘Wimpenny,’ ‘Pinchpenny,’ with its more\r\ndirectly Norman ‘Pinsemaille,’ and ‘Kachepeny,’ with its equally foreign\r\n‘Cache-maille,’ are all also of the same early date, and with one or two\r\nexceptions are to be met with to this very day.[558] It is a true\r\ncriticism which, as is noticed by Archbishop Trench, has marked the\r\n_miserly_ as indeed the emphatically _miserable_ soul. ‘Whirlepeny’ is\r\nnow extinct, but alone, so far as my researches go, existed formerly to\r\nremind men that the spendthrift character is equally subversive of the\r\ntrue basis of human happiness.[559] Several names combined with ‘peck’\r\nand ‘pick,’ as ‘Peckcheese,’ ‘Peckbean,’ ‘Peckweather,’ and ‘Pickbone,’\r\nseem to be expressive of the gluttonous habits of the possessors, but it\r\nis possible they may be but the moral antecedents of our modern\r\n‘Pecksniffs’![560]\r\n\r\nOur ‘Starks’ and ‘Starkies,’ if not ‘Starkmans,’ represent a word which\r\ncan hardly be said to exist in our vocabulary, since it now but survives\r\nin certain phrases, such as ‘stark-mad,’ or ‘stark-naked.’ We should\r\nnever say a man was ‘stark’ simply. A forcible word, it once expressed\r\nthe rude untutored nature of anything. Thus, on account of his unbridled\r\npassion, the Bastard King is termed in the Saxon chronicle ‘a stark man,\r\nand very savage,’ while just before he is asserted to be ‘stark beyond\r\nall bounds to them who withsaid his will.’ Thus it will be akin to such\r\nnames as ‘Walter le Wyld,’[561] or ‘Warin Cruel,’ or ‘Ralph le Ferce,’\r\nor ‘John le Savage,’ or ‘William le Salvage,’ or ‘Adelmya le Sauvage,’\r\nor ‘William Ramage.’ Chaucer speaks somewhere of a ‘ramage goat.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                          III.—MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n         (1) _Nicknames from the Animal and Vegetable Kingdom._\r\n\r\nMr. Lower, in his ‘English Surnames,’ gives a long list of names from\r\nwhat he calls vegetable productions, but, although he does not say so, I\r\nam confident he would be the first to admit that the great majority of\r\nthose which he instances should really be set among our local surnames.\r\nFor example, he includes ‘Cherry,’ ‘Broome,’ ‘Bramble,’ ‘Ferne,’\r\n‘Holyoak,’ ‘Peach,’ ‘Rowntree,’ in this category. While ‘Cherry’ and\r\n‘Peach’ might possibly be sobriquets of complexion, the manifest course\r\nis to look upon them as of local origin. So persuaded am I of this,\r\nafter a long perusal of mediæval records, that I shall notice but some\r\nhalf-dozen names from the vegetable kingdom, and only those of which I\r\ncan find memorials in past registers. This is a place which of all\r\nothers might well tempt me to run riot among our directories, and\r\ncollect a curious list from our present existing nomenclature; but I\r\nwould even here persistently adhere to the idea with which I set out,\r\nand to which I have mainly been true, viz., to instance names about\r\nwhich I can speak somewhat positively, because I have found them\r\nimbedded in the nomenclature of the period in which surnames had their\r\nrise. ‘Blanchflower,’ ‘Lilywhite,’ and ‘Boutflower’ I have already dealt\r\nwith. ‘Robert Daisye’ occurs in the ‘Trial of Dame Alice Kyteler’ (Cam.\r\nSoc.), ‘Nicholas Pescodde’ in the ‘Proceedings in Chancery’ (Elizabeth),\r\n‘Godfrey Gingivre’ (Ginger) in the ‘Writs of Parliament,’[562] ‘Geoffrey\r\nPeppercorn’ in the Hundred Rolls, ‘Robert Primerose’ and ‘Sara Garlek’\r\nin the ‘History of Norfolk’ (Blomefield), and ‘Roger Pluckerose’ and\r\n‘John Pullrose’ in a Sussex Roll of 1296.[563] I doubt whether more than\r\none or two of these can be said rightly to belong to the nickname class.\r\nAs sign-names—for I feel assured they thus arose—they will have their\r\nplace in our second chapter on ‘Local Names.’[564]\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the Animal Kingdom we are on clearer and more\r\ndefinite ground. The local class must undoubtedly embrace a large number\r\nof these names, as such an entry as ‘William atte Roebuck’ (M.), or\r\n‘Richard de la Vache’ (A.), or ‘Thomas atte Ram’ (N.), or ‘John de la\r\nRoe’ (O.), or ‘Gilbert de la Hegle’ (A.), or ‘Hugh atte Cokke’ (B.), or\r\n‘Walter de Whitehorse’ (C.), or ‘John atte Gote’ (M.) dearly testifies.\r\nBut on the other hand we find a class, set by which the last is\r\ninsignificant—a class which has its own entries—‘William le Got’ (A.),\r\n‘Katerina le Cok’ (B.), ‘Alicia le Ro’ (A.), ‘Philip la Vache’ (C.), or\r\n‘Joachim le Ram’ (T.), corresponding to the former, only differing in\r\nthat such entries are vastly more numerous and embrace a wider range,\r\ntaking in, in fact, the whole genus and species that belong alike to\r\n‘the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, the cattle, and every\r\ncreeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ In dealing with this large\r\nand varied assortment of sobriquets, I would say then that, where there\r\nis no proof positive to the contrary, the course is to survey a name of\r\nthis class as referable to three distinct origins, and I put them in the\r\nfollowing order of probability:—1. A nickname taken from that animal\r\nwhose generally understood habits seemed to bear affinity to those of\r\nthe nominee. 2. A local sign-name. 3. An heraldic device. With these\r\npreliminary statements, let us proceed.\r\n\r\nAs we find all the moral qualities seized upon to give individuality to\r\nthe possessors, so, too, we find the names of animals whose\r\npeculiarities gave pretext for the sobriquets pressed into the service\r\nof our nomenclature. In our earlier Pagan history it had been the wont\r\nof Saxon fathers to style their children by the names of such beasts as\r\nfrom their nobler qualities it was hoped the little one would one day\r\ncopy. The same fashion still existed, only that the nickname as the\r\nexponent of popular feeling was really more or less appropriate to him\r\nwho was made to bear it. In the latter case, too, it was the ridiculous\r\naspects of character that were most eagerly caught at. Our general\r\nvocabulary is not without traces of this custom. We still term a\r\nshrewish wife a _vixen_, _i.e._ a she fox. Men of a vile, mean character\r\nare rascals, _i.e._ lean deer; and rough boys are _urchins_,[565] a\r\ncorruption of the old _herison_, or hedgehog. Applying this to surnames,\r\nwe come first to\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Beasts._—Our ‘Bests,’ when not local, are but the ‘Richard le\r\nBestes’ or ‘Henry le Bestes’ of the thirteenth century. Their\r\nsuperlative excellence is therefore imaginary, I fear, but we may be\r\npermitted to hope that they are what they appear. ‘Edith Beest,’ in the\r\nsixteenth century, is nearer our modern form. Our ‘Oliphants,’\r\n‘Olivants,’ and ‘Ollivants’ represent but the elephant, and owe their\r\norigin, doubtless, to the huge and ungainly proportions of some early\r\nancestor. In the ‘Romance of Alexander’ is a strange description of the\r\nfabled monoceros, which would seem to have been a kind of potpourri of\r\nall other beasts, for besides a tail like a hog, tusks like a dog, and a\r\nhead like a hart’s—\r\n\r\n                         Made is his cors\r\n                   After the forme of a hors,\r\n                   Fete after _olifant_, certis.[566]\r\n\r\nThis sobriquet, in a day when size and strength went for much, does not\r\nseem to have been thought objectionable, for its owners have left issue\r\nenough to prevent its ever falling into abeyance.[567] Thus we see we\r\nmay meet with elephants every day in our streets without going to the\r\nZoological Gardens for them. Our ‘Lions’ (‘Richard Lion,’ V. 2) and\r\n‘Lyons,’ when not local,[568] speak doubtless for the brave heart of\r\nsome early progenitor. Our ‘Bears,’ relics of ‘Richard le Bere’ (A.) or\r\n‘Lawrence le Bere’ (M.), as a reflection upon a surly temper, would be\r\nless complimentary, or perhaps the original nominee wore his hair shaggy\r\nand long. A fierce disposition would meet with rebuke or praise, as the\r\ncase might be, in such a sobriquet as ‘John Lepard,’ or ‘Tiger,’ now all\r\nbut obsolete, saving for our striped and liveried youths; or ‘Wolf’\r\n(‘Elena le Wolfe,’ A., ‘Philip le Wolf,’ M.), with its more Norman\r\n‘Lupe’[569] (‘Robert le Lupe,’ B.), or ‘Lovel’[570] or ‘Love’ (‘Robert\r\nle Love,’ A.), the latter being in flat contradiction to the usually\r\nascribed instincts of the animal. Timidity or reserve, or perchance\r\nfleetness of foot, would soon find itself exalted in ‘Geoffrey le Hare,’\r\n‘Reginalde le Raye,’ ‘Walter le Buk,’ ‘Hobart le Hart,’ ‘Dorothie le\r\nStagge,’ ‘Henry Rascal,’[571] ‘William le Do,’ or ‘Alicia le Ro,’ the\r\nancestors of our ‘Hares,’ ‘Rays,’ or ‘Wrays,’ ‘Bucks,’[572] ‘Harts,’\r\n‘Stags,’ ‘Does,’ or ‘Roes,’ of legal notoriety, and ‘Prickets.’ That old\r\nspoiler of hen-roosts, the polecat, has left us in ‘Fitch’ and\r\n‘Fitchett’ no very happy relationship of ideas. Craftiness would be very\r\nproperly stigmatised in ‘Henry le Fox’ or ‘John le Tod,’ and a ‘John le\r\nRenaud’ occurring in the Parliamentary Rolls reminds us that some of our\r\n‘Renauds’ and ‘Renards’ may be more closely associated with this wily\r\ndenizen of our forest fastnesses than they think. The _badger_ has\r\noriginated ‘Walter le Broc’ or ‘Henry le Brok’ (now Brock); the _beaver_\r\n‘John le Bever,’ or ‘John le Bevere’ (now Beaver).[573] The _rabbit_\r\ngave us ‘Henry Cony’ and ‘John Conay;’ the _weasel_ ‘Mathew le Martun’\r\n(now Marten); the _mole_ ‘Walter le Want’ (now Want); the nimble haunter\r\nof our forest boughs ‘Thomas le Squyrelle’ (now Squirrell), and the\r\n_otter_ ‘Alan Otere,’ or ‘Edward Oter’ (now Otter).\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the farmyard and its accessories, which, as we might\r\nreadily presume, are well represented. ‘Alice le Buie,’ or ‘William le\r\nBuie’ (now Bull), is a sobriquet which has now such a firm place as\r\nsymbolic of our national character that we need not show to what\r\npeculiarities of temperament they owed their name. ‘Simon le Steer,’\r\n‘Peter le Vache,’ with its Saxon ‘Thomas le Cu’ or ‘Ralph le Cou,’\r\n‘Richard le Calf’[574] ‘Godwin le Bulloc,’ ‘Peter le Stot,’ ‘Roger le\r\nColt,’ are all of common occurrence, and still abide with us. ‘Roger le\r\nMule,’ as representative of obstinacy, we might have suspected, would\r\nhave become early obsolete, but it still survives.[575] ‘Robert le\r\nVeyle,’ or ‘William le Veel,’ now written ‘Veale,’ ‘Philip le Mutton,’\r\nand ‘John le Bœuf,’ or ‘Robert le Bef,’[576] carry us back to the day\r\nwhen these several terms denoted the living animal. Thus, with respect\r\nto the last, Burton in his ‘Anatomy,’ translating Plautus, says—\r\n\r\n           Like other cooks I do not supper dress,\r\n             That put whole meadows into a platter,\r\n           And make no better of their guests than beeves,\r\n             With herbs and grass to feed them fatter.—p. 69.\r\n\r\nAlongside our ‘Muttons’ we may place our ‘William le Lambs’ and ‘Richard\r\nle Lombs,’[577] and if they were remarkable for their meek disposition,\r\nplayfulness, I doubt not, was equally characteristic of our ‘Reginald\r\nKidds’ and ‘Cheevers,’ relics of the old ‘Henry le Chivre’ or goat. I am\r\nafraid the connexion of ideas that gave rise to such sobriquets as were\r\nrepresented by ‘Alice le Hog,’ ‘John le Bacun,’[578] ‘William le Gryse,’\r\n‘Gilbert Galt,’ ‘Walter Pigge,’[579] ‘Roger Sugge,’ ‘Richard le Bor’\r\n(Boar), ‘Richard Wildbore,’ ‘John Pork,’ and ‘John Purcell’ (little\r\nporker, that is), is not of the pleasantest—terms, too, as they are, all\r\nfamiliar to our directories to this present day. Several of these words\r\nare now colloquially obsolete. ‘Grice,’ I fancy, is one such. We still\r\nspeak of the ‘griskin.’ Locally it comes in such names as ‘Grisdale’ and\r\n‘Griswood.’ As a sobriquet of the animal, it was quite familiar in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Piers Plowman says—\r\n\r\n                        Cokes and their knaves\r\n                        Cryden, ‘Hote pies, hote!\r\n                        Goode gees and grys!’\r\n\r\n‘Sug’ was provincial for ‘sow,’ and comes in the local ‘Sugden’\r\nmentioned in my first chapter. Richard III. was sometimes styled the\r\n‘Boar’ or ‘Hog.’ It was in allusion to this that the rhyme got abroad—\r\n\r\n                  The Rat, the Cat, and Lovel the Dog,\r\n                  Rule all England under the Hog.\r\n\r\nThe first two referred of course to _Rat_cliffe and _Cat_esby. But the\r\nmention of these reminds us of our household pets and indoor foes.\r\n‘Elias le Cat,’ or ‘Adam le Kat,’ or ‘Milo le Chat’ still boasts\r\ndescendants, and the same can be said for ‘Nicholas Dogge,’ or ‘Eborard\r\nle Kenn,’ or ‘Thomas le Chen.’ The usual forms are Catt, Ken, and Kenn.\r\nIn our _kennel_ we still preserve a memorial of this Norman-introduced\r\nword. Our ‘Hunds’ and ‘Hounds’ are but the old ‘Gilbert le Hund’ or\r\n‘William le Hund,’ and carry us to the forest and the chase. The\r\nespecial bugbear of cat and dog alike found remembrance in our early\r\n‘Nicholas le Rat’ and ‘Walter le Rat,’ or ‘Ralph Ratun,’[580] and in\r\n‘John le Mous,’ ‘Hugh le Mus,’ or ‘Richard Mowse.’ ‘Ratton,’ ‘Ratt,’ and\r\n‘Mowse’ still exist. With one more name we conclude. Through Spain and\r\nthe Moors of Barbary monkeys were early introduced for the amusement of\r\nthe English people. In the ‘Miller’s Tale’ it is said of Alison—\r\n\r\n               And thus she maketh Absolom her ape,\r\n               And all his earnest turneth to a gape.[581]\r\n\r\nthat is, she was wont to make a fool of him. The sobriquet is found in\r\nsuch an entry as ‘John le Ape,’ registered in the Hundred Rolls, or\r\n‘John Jackanapes,’ in the Parliamentary Writs.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Birds._—The surname that represents the genus is ‘Bird,’ the name\r\nbeing met with as ‘John le Bryd’ or ‘David le Brid,’ a pronunciation\r\nstill in vogue in many parts of England. Falconry has given us many\r\nsobriquets of this class. Accustomed as our fathers were to seeing the\r\nfierce and eager instincts of the bird, to nickname a man of rapacious\r\nand grasping habits by such a term as ‘John le Kyte,’ or ‘William le\r\nHawk,’ or ‘Richard le Falcon,’ would be the most natural thing in the\r\nworld. And just as the difference in breed and disposition in these\r\nbirds themselves gave rise to separate definitions, so an imagined\r\nresemblance to these distinct qualities must have originated such\r\ndifferent names as ‘Muskett,’ ‘Buzzard,’ ‘Puttock,’[582] ‘Goshawk,’\r\n‘Tassell,’ ‘Gleed,’ or ‘Glide,’[583] and ‘Sparrowhawk,’ or ‘Spark,’ or\r\n‘Sparke,’ as it is now more generally spelt. So early as Chaucer,\r\nhowever, this last was written ‘Spar-hawk,’[584] and that once gained\r\nthe further contraction in our nomenclature became inevitable. Thus was\r\nit with other birds. Did a man develop such propensities as showiness,\r\nthen he was nicknamed ‘Jay;’ if pride, ‘Peacock’ or ‘Pocock,’ as it was\r\nonce pronounced; if guile, ‘Rook;’ if pertness, ‘Pye,’ with its\r\ndiminutive ‘Pyet’ or ‘Pyett;’ if garrulity, ‘Parrott’ or ‘Parratt;’ if\r\nhe was a votary of song he was styled ‘Nightingale’ or ‘Lark,’ or in its\r\nmore antique dress ‘Laverock’ or ‘Woodlark,’ or ‘Finch,’ or ‘Bulfinch,’\r\nor ‘Goldfinch,’ or ‘Chaffinch,’ or ‘Spink,’ or ‘Goldspink,’ or ‘Thrush,’\r\nor ‘Thrussel,’ or ‘Cuckoo.’ If jauntiness displayed itself in his\r\nactions he was nicknamed ‘Cock’ or ‘Cockerell’ or ‘Chauntecler;’ if\r\nhomeliness, ‘Sparrow;’ if tenderness, ‘Pigeon’ or ‘Dove,’ and so on with\r\nour ‘Swans,’ ‘Herons,’ ‘Cootes,’ ‘Gulls,’ ‘Storks,’ ‘Ravens,’ ‘Crows,’\r\n‘Speights,’ ‘Cranes,’ ‘Capons,’ ‘Henns,’ ‘Chickens,’[585] ‘Ducks,’\r\n‘Duckerells,’ ‘Drakes,’ ‘Sheldrakes’ or ‘Sheldricks,’ ‘Wildgooses,’\r\n‘Mallards’ (_i.e._ wild duck), ‘Gooses’ or ‘Goss’s,’[586] ‘Greygooses,’\r\n‘Goslings,’[587] ‘Ganders,’ ‘Woodcocks,’ ‘Partridges,’ ‘Partricks,’\r\n‘Pheasants,’ or ‘Fesants,’ as once spelt, and ‘Blackbirds.’[588] These\r\nare names ornithologically familiar to us. Many a pretty name, however,\r\nonce on the common tongue but now obsolete, or well-nigh so, still\r\nabides in our surnames. Thus our ‘Popjays’ still preserve the\r\nremembrance of the once common _popinjay_ or parrot, ‘the popinjay, full\r\nof delicasy,’ as Chaucer styles her.[589] In ‘Culver’ or ringdove we are\r\nreminded of the pathetic story of Philomine, where the same writer\r\nlikens her to\r\n\r\n                 the lamb that of the wolf is bitten,\r\n          Or as the culver, that of the eagle is smitten.[590]\r\n\r\nOur ‘Ruddocks’ or ‘Ruddicks’ (‘Ralph Ruddoc,’ A.), again, are but the\r\nold _ruddock_ or robin-redbreast, ‘the tame ruddock,’ as he is termed in\r\nthe ‘Assembly of Fowls.’ The hedge-sparrow still lives represented by\r\nour ‘Pinnocks’ or ‘Pinnicks’ ‘John Pynnock’ (G.), ‘Richard Pinnoc’ (A.)—\r\n\r\n              Thus in the pinnick’s nest the cuckoo lays,\r\n              Then, easy as a Frenchman, takes her flight.\r\n\r\nSo an old writer says. Our ‘Turtles’ (‘Roger Turtle’ D.) are but\r\npleasant memorials of the bird that has been so long emblematic of\r\nconstancy, the dove; our ‘Challenders,’ if not a corruption of\r\n‘Callender,’ are representatives of the _chelaunder_ or goldfinch, so\r\noften mentioned by early poets; and in our ‘Woodalls,’ ‘Woodales,’ and\r\n‘Woodwalls,’ not to say some of our ‘Woodwells,’ we are but reminded of\r\nthe _woodwale_, the early woodpecker. Our ‘Rains’ are but the old\r\n‘Robert or William le Rain,’ another term for the same;[591] while our\r\n‘Stars’ and ‘Stares’ (‘Robert Stare,’ A.) carry us back to the day when\r\nthe starling was so familiarly styled. In the ‘Assembly of Fowls’ the\r\nauthor speaks of—\r\n\r\n               The false lapwing, full of trecherie,\r\n               The _stare_, that the counsaile can beurie.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Romance of the Rose’ a list of birds is given embracing many of\r\nthe above—\r\n\r\n            For there was many a bird singing,\r\n            Throughout the yard all thringing,\r\n            In many places were nightingales,\r\n            Alpes, finches, and wodewales,\r\n            That in their sweet song delighten,\r\n            In thilke (such) places as they habiten.\r\n            There might men see many flocks\r\n            of turtles, and laverocks,\r\n            Chelaundres fele (many) saw I there,\r\n            That very nigh forsongen were (tired of singing).\r\n\r\nEvery one of these birds so styled is still to be met with in our\r\ndirectories, for even the _alpe_ or bull-finch is not absent. It is only\r\nin the investigation of subjects like this we see how great are the\r\nchanges that creep over a people’s language. What a list of words is\r\nthis, which if uttered now would fall dead and meaningless upon the ear\r\nof the listener, and yet they were once familiar as household words.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Fish._—‘John le Fysche’ or ‘William Fyske’ have left descendants\r\nenough to prove that many a Fish can live out of water, although much\r\nhas been advanced to the contrary. At a time when the peasants lived\r\ndaily on the products of the inland streams and sandy sea-banks, and\r\nwhen the supply was infinitely more plentiful than it is now, we can\r\neasily perceive the naturalness of the sobriquets that belong to this\r\nclass. Terms that are all but obsolete to us now, were household words\r\nthen. Hence it is that we find our directories of to-day abounding with\r\nsuch entries as ‘Whale,’[592] ‘Shark,’ ‘Dolphin,’ Herring,’[593]\r\n‘Codde,’ ‘Codling,’ ‘Salmon,’[594] ‘Trout,’ ‘Mackarel,’ ‘Grayling,’\r\n‘Smelt,’ ‘Pilchard,’ ‘Whiting,’ ‘Turbot,’[595] ‘Keeling,’ ‘Crabbe,’\r\n‘Chubb,’[596] ‘Tench,’[597] ‘Pike,’ and ‘Pickerel.’ ‘John Sturgeon’ is\r\nmentioned by Foxe in his ‘Martyrology,’ under date 1541, and still\r\nremains. The Hundred Rolls contain a ‘William Lampreye.’ ‘Barnacle’ is\r\nstill common, and ‘Mussell’ and ‘Spratt’[598] are not unknown. But\r\nperhaps the most curious of these early nicknames are those belonging to\r\n‘Matilda le Welke’ and ‘William Welkeshorn.’ Probably they were\r\nnotorious for a weakness towards that mollusk, which is still eaten in\r\nlarge quantities in some parts of England.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Insects and Reptiles._—This is not a large class. The Hundred\r\nRolls furnish us with a ‘Magge Flie’ and an ‘Oda[599] Flie.’ The same\r\nrecords contain a ‘Margaret Gnatte’ and a ‘William Gnatte.’ ‘Baldewin\r\nBugg’ (B.) and ‘Bate Bugge’ (A.) are also found, but although the\r\nquestion has been asked—\r\n\r\n                               If a party had a voice,\r\n                 What mortal would be a Bugg by choice,\r\n\r\nI fancy the cognomen is local, one of the endless forms, like ‘Brough,’\r\n‘Burgh,’ ‘Burkes,’ of the old ‘Borough.’ ‘Roger le Waps’[600] reminds us\r\nof the still existing provincialism for wasp, and ‘William Snake’ or\r\n‘John Frog’ would be as little acceptable.[601] The smallest and most\r\nrepulsive insect we have, the parasitic louse, is found in ‘Nicholas le\r\nLus’ (J.), but our directories have now got rid of it—an example that\r\nmight be followed with no small advantage in other quarters.\r\n\r\n           (2) _Descriptive Compounds affixed as Nicknames._\r\n\r\nBut in an age like that of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries we\r\ncannot imagine that society would be merely required to come under a\r\nverbal castigation such as, after all, did nothing more than strike off\r\nthe names of the animals that entered into Noah’s Ark. To call a man a\r\n‘wolf’ or a ‘bull’ or a ‘grayling’ or a ‘salmon’ or a ‘peacock,’ after\r\nall, is not very dreadful. Terms of a more compound form, sobriquets\r\nmore minutely anatomical, are also met with, the unpleasantness of which\r\nis proved by the fact of so few of them having come down to us, while\r\nnot a small portion, as not fit for ears polite, must be altogether left\r\nin their obscurity. There are others, however, of which none need to be\r\nashamed. For instance, the kingly denomination of ‘Quer-de-lyun’ (‘Ralph\r\nQuerdelyun,’ T., ‘William Querdelion,’ X.),[602] found in several lists,\r\ncould not but be agreeable, while ‘Dan-de-lyun,’ or ‘lion-toothed’\r\n(‘William Daundelyun,’ B.), would be in thorough harmony with the spirit\r\nof the age. ‘Colfox’ (‘Thomas Colfox,’ Z.), still existing, would be\r\nless pleasant. The term ‘fox’ is supposed in itself to be synonymous\r\nwith deceit, but the intensive ‘col-fox’ or ‘deceitful-fox’ must have\r\nimplied duplicity indeed! Chaucer, in his ‘Nunn’s Story,’ speaks of\r\n\r\n                   A col fox full of sleigh iniquity.\r\n\r\n‘Clenehog’ (‘William Clenehog,’ A.) or ‘Clenegrise’ (‘Roger Clenegrise,’\r\nA.) would seem to be a sarcasm upon the dirty habits of its early owner,\r\nwhile ‘Piggesflesh’ (‘Reyner Piggesflesh,’ M.) or Hoggesflesh’ (‘Margery\r\nHoggesflesh,’ Z.)[603] is as obviously intended to be a reflection upon\r\nthe general appearance. ‘Herring’ (‘Robert Heryng,’ A.), already\r\nmentioned, is not objectionable, but ‘Goodherring’ (‘Adam Godharing,’\r\nA.) and ‘Redherring’[604] (‘William Redhering,’ M.) are. ‘Fish’ one\r\nwould not for a moment find fault with, but few young ladies, I imagine,\r\nwould be found to face at the matrimonial altar a ‘John Pourfishe’ (M.).\r\nObjection, too, if not by the fair inamorata, yet by her parents, would\r\nbe raised, I suspect, to an alliance with a ‘Roger Feldog,’ or ‘Thomas\r\nCatsnose,’ or ‘William Cocksbrain,’ or ‘Robert Calvesmaw,’ or ‘Peter\r\nBuckeskyn,’ or ‘Arnulph Dogmaw,’ or ‘Henry Crowfoot,’ or ‘Matthew\r\nGoosebeak,’ or ‘John Bullhead.’[605] Talking of the last, however, it is\r\ninteresting to notice how much the bull has entered into compounds of\r\nthis kind. Thus we light upon such names as ‘Walter Oyl-de-beof’ or\r\n‘William Oldbeof,’ that is, bull-eyed; ‘Ralph Front-de-bœuf,’ that is,\r\nbull-faced; ‘John Cors-de-bœuf’ or ‘Thomas Cordebeofe,’ that is,\r\nbull-bodied; ‘John Queer-de-bœf,’ that is, bull-hearted, or ‘Amice le\r\nWildebœf’ or ‘Nicholas Waldebeof,’ seemingly like ‘Wild-bore,’ referring\r\nto some wild untutored characteristics of the bearer. In all these the\r\ngenius of the age is quite apparent, and probably not one was looked\r\nupon as otherwise than complimentary. ‘William Scorchebouef’ was\r\nevidently some unlucky young kitchener who had mismanaged his duties as\r\nspit-turner, but it betrays the process by which the term ‘bœuf’ has\r\ncome into its present position of verbal usefulness. In this light\r\n‘Cors-de-bœuf’ also is further interesting as reminding us that there\r\nwas a time when ‘corpse’ did not necessarily imply the inanimate frame.\r\n‘Behold, they were all dead corpses,’ found in our Authorized Version,\r\nwas no tautology, it would appear, even in the seventeenth century. Thus\r\ndo changes creep over the lives of words as well as men.\r\n\r\nWe might fill a book with these descriptive compounds—surnames so\r\nwhimsical, so absurdly humorous that they manifestly could not live. For\r\ninstance, we meet in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries with such a\r\nsobriquet as ‘William Hondeshakere,’ which no doubt spoke for the hearty\r\ngoodwill of its easy possessor. ‘Geoffry Chese-and-brede’ seems to refer\r\nto the peculiar taste of its owner, while ‘Arnold Scutelmouth’ would be\r\na sarcasm on personal capacity for such things. ‘Alan Swet-in-bedde’\r\nwould not be an acceptable cognomen, nor ‘William Badneighbour,’ nor\r\n‘Thomas Two-year-olde,’ nor ‘Geoffrey Dringkedregges,’ nor ‘Anna\r\nHellicate’ (hell-cat).[606] ‘Alice Gude-ale-house’ was evidently a\r\nhomely landlady, who kept her tavern in good repute by assiduous\r\nattention and good-humoured ways. ‘William Kepegest’ would seem to\r\nbespeak the kindly cheer of more private hospitality, while ‘John\r\nDrybread,’ if not stingy, was doubtless crusty. ‘John Ratelle-bagge,’ or\r\n‘John Leve-to-day,’ or ‘Serle Go-to-Kirk,’ or ‘Thomas Horsenail,’ or\r\n‘John Lightharness,’ or ‘Richard Myldew,’ or ‘John Buckleboots,’ or\r\n‘Edward Tortoise-shell,’[607] or ‘John Hornbuckle,’ while conveying no\r\nslight upon the character, would be obnoxious enough as surnames. Our\r\n‘Doolittles,’ ‘Lovejoys,’ ‘Scattergoods,’ ‘Makepeaces,’ and ‘Hatewrongs’\r\nbelong to this same category. A large and varied assortment of this\r\nclass will be found in the notes to this chapter, and to them I refer\r\nthe reader. They are of a class which were especially popular at the\r\ntime of which we are writing. Many of them are used as expletives in the\r\nrailing poets and writers of the period. For instance, the author of\r\n‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote’ speaks of—\r\n\r\n                       ‘Slingthrift Fleshmonger,’\r\n             Also ‘Fabian Flatterer,’ and ‘Cicely Claterer,’\r\n             With ‘Adam Averus,’ flail-swinger,\r\n             And ‘Francis Flaproach,’ ...\r\n             With ‘Giles Unreste,’ mayor of Newgate,\r\n             And ‘Lewis Unlusty, the leesing-monger.’\r\n             Here is ‘Will Wily,’ the mill-pecker (thief),\r\n             And ‘Patrick Peevish,’ hairbeater,\r\n             With ‘Davy Drawlatch’[608] of Rockingham.\r\n             Also ‘Hick Crookneck,’ the rope-maker,\r\n             And ‘Steven Measellmouth,’ mussell-taker,\r\n             With ‘Gogle-eyed Thompson,’ shepster of Lynn.\r\n\r\nThe above selection of fancy names will give us a fair idea of the kind\r\nof sobriquet which went down with the lower orders during the Angevine\r\nand Plantagenet dynasties.\r\n\r\nBut the largest branch of descriptive compounds is yet to be mentioned.\r\nWe find not a few instances where names of simple relationship or\r\noccupation or office, or even, we may add, of patronymic character,\r\nhaving become compounded with adjectives expressive of the feeling of\r\nthose with whom the nominee had to deal, naturally place themselves\r\nunder this same category. These, so far as they have come down to us,\r\nare generally of a favourable, or at least harmless, description. Thus,\r\nto notice Christian names first, this has especially been the case with\r\n‘John.’ Probably as this sobriquet grew into favour the practice became\r\nthe means of distinguishing between several of the same title. Thus, as\r\nI hinted in my previous chapter, if John were doughty, he became\r\n‘Prujean,’[609] that is, preux-jean; if fat, ‘Grosjean;’ if young,\r\n‘Youngjohn;’[610] if clownish, ‘Hobjohn;’ if big, ‘Micklejohn;’ if\r\nsmall, ‘Littlejohn,’[611] or ‘Petitjean;’[612] if of a sunburnt\r\ncountenance, ‘Brownjohn;’[613] and if comely or well proportioned,\r\n‘Properjohn;’ thus preserving a once familiar sense of ‘proper,’ which\r\nwe may meet with in such an olden phrase as a ‘proper knight,’ or in our\r\npresent Authorized Scripture Version, where our translators make St.\r\nPaul speak of Moses in his infancy as a ‘proper child.’[614] Lastly, we\r\nhave the estimable ‘Bonjohn,’ the origin, I doubt not, of ‘Bunyon’ and\r\n‘Bunyan,’ the familiar bearer of the latter form of which we shall all\r\ndoubtless admit to be well worthy his name. It is happy chance that when\r\nwe speak, as we often do, of ‘_good John_ Bunyan,’ we simply give him a\r\nreduplication of that very title which none more richly merits than he.\r\nIn 1310 there was a ‘Jon Bonjon’ in London, and still earlier than this\r\na ‘Durand le Bon Johan’ figures in the Hundred Rolls.[615] Several\r\nothers we may mention, more Saxon in their character, and all long\r\nobsolete, save one. Indeed, I doubt not they died with their original\r\npossessors. These are ‘Robert Good-robert’ (P.) and ‘Richard\r\nWhite-richard’ (J.), ‘William Holy-peter’ (A.) ‘William Jolif-will’ (A.)\r\n(_i.e._ ‘Jolly-Will’),[616] and ‘William Prout-pierre’ (M.). ‘William\r\nGoodhugh’ (M.), however, has contrived to hold his own, unless, as Mr.\r\nLower thinks, it belongs not to this category, but one I have already\r\nsurveyed, that regarding complexion. Its early form of ‘Godhewe’ would\r\nseem perhaps to favour his notion. Names of this class, however, are\r\nrare. When we come to occupation the instances are much more common.\r\nThus if we have ‘Husband,’ who doubtless owes his origin to his\r\neconomical rather than his marital position, we have, besides,\r\n‘Younghusband’—in his day, I dare say, a somewhat precocious youth—the\r\nnow obsolete ‘Goodhusband;’ if ‘Skinner,’ then ‘Langskinner;’ if\r\n‘Wright,’ then ‘Longwright’ or ‘Longus-Faber,’ as it is Latinized in our\r\nrolls; if ‘Smith,’ then ‘Gros-smith,’ that is ‘big-smith,’ or\r\n‘Wild-smith’ or ‘Youngsmith;’ or if ‘Groom,’ then ‘Good-groom’[617] and\r\n‘Old-groom.’ If we have ‘Swain,’ we had also ‘Goodswain,’ or\r\n‘Brownswain,’ or ‘Madswain,’ or ‘Summerswain,’ or ‘Cuteswain,’ or\r\n‘Colswain’ (that is, deceitful swain, or ‘Littleswain;’ if ‘King,’[618]\r\nthen ‘Littleking,’ ‘Coyking,’ ‘Brownking,’ ‘Whiteking,’ and ‘Redking;’\r\nif ‘Hine,’ or ‘Hyne,’ or ‘Hind,’ a peasant somewhat similar to Swain,\r\nthen also ‘Goodhyne;’ if ‘Bond,’ then ‘Youngbond;’ if ‘Knave’ or\r\nservant, then ‘Smartknave,’ ‘Whiteknave,’ ‘Brownknave,’ and ‘Goodknave,’\r\nthe latter a strange compound to modern ears;[619] if ‘Clerk,’ then\r\n‘Bonclerk,’ ‘Beauclerk,’ ‘Goodclerk,’ ‘Mauclerk,’[620] and\r\n‘Redclerk;’[621] if ‘Page,’ then ‘Littlepage’[622] and ‘Smallpage,’ and\r\nto put it here for convenience, ‘Lawpage;’ if ‘Wayt,’ a ‘watchman,’ then\r\n‘Smartwayt,’ ‘Stertwait’ (active, on the alert), and ‘Goodwayt;’ if\r\n‘Man’ or ‘Mann,’ a relic of the old ‘le Man’ or menial, then also\r\n‘Goodman,’ a term, however, which became early used of any honest\r\nhouseholder.[623] ‘Le Mayster’ or ‘Master’ was common enough, but I am\r\nsorry to say I have not lighted upon a ‘Goodmayster’ as yet. Thus\r\n‘Fellowe’ also, or ‘Fellowes,’ as we now have it, is met by ‘Goodfellow’\r\nand ‘Longfellow;’ ‘Child’ by ‘Goodchild’ and the obsolete ‘Evilchild;’\r\n‘Son’ by ‘Littleson’ and ‘Fairson;’ ‘Sire’ by ‘Littlesire’ and\r\n‘Fairsire;’ ‘Nurse’ by ‘Goodnurse,’ and ‘Fowl’ by ‘Goodfowl.’ Norman\r\nequivalents for these, however, were not wanting. ‘Goodfellow’ had its\r\nmate in ‘Boncompagnon,’ ‘Goodbody’ in ‘Bonecors,’ ‘Goodwait’ in\r\n‘Bonserjeant,’ ‘Goodclerk’[624] in ‘Bonclerk,’ and ‘Goodman’[625] in\r\n‘Bonhomme’ (our present ‘Bonham’)[626] and ‘Prudhomme’ or ‘Pridham.’\r\n‘Evilchild’ found itself face to face with ‘Malenfant,’ ‘Littlesire’\r\nwith ‘Petitsire,’ ‘Goodchild’ with ‘Bonyfant,’ ‘Bonenfant,’ or\r\n‘Bullivant,’ as we now have it, and ‘Godson’ or ‘Goodson,’ it may be,\r\nwith ‘Bonfils’ or ‘Boffill.’ We have still ‘Clerk,’ but ‘Bonclerke,’ if\r\nnot ‘Beauclerk,’ is obsolete; ‘Squier,’ but ‘Bonsquier’ has disappeared;\r\n‘Chevalier’ also thrives, while ‘Bonchevalier’ is extinct. In some cases\r\nthe simple and the compound forms are both wanting. It is so with our\r\nformer ‘Vadlets’ and ‘Bonvalets,’ our ‘Vileins,’ ‘Beauvileyns,’ and\r\n‘Mangevileyns’ (scabby), our ‘Queynts’ and ‘Bonqueynts,’ and our\r\n‘Aventures’ and ‘Bonaventures,’ the latter sobriquet evidently given to\r\none who had acquitted himself well in some mediæval joust or tournament.\r\nIt is found in several records. Piers Plowman uses the term simple, when\r\nhe speaks of Faith crying—\r\n\r\n                    As dooth an heraud of armes,\r\n                    When aventrous cometh to justes.\r\n\r\n‘Christian,’ which may be but the proper name, still lives, though\r\n‘Bonchristien’ is gone; and ‘Count,’ too, lingers, ‘Boncount’ being\r\nobsolete. Sometimes, strangely enough, the French idiomatic compounds\r\ngot literally translated into Saxon, resulting in terms of utterly\r\ndifferent meaning. Thus, as I have already shown, ‘Beaupere’ met face to\r\nface with ‘Fairsire,’ ‘Beaufiz’[627] with ‘Fairchild,’ and ‘Beaufrere’\r\nwith ‘Fairbrother.’ But this bare and naked translation into the\r\nvernacular seems to have been a general practice. The Norman\r\n‘Petyclerk,’ for instance, was speedily met by ‘Smalwritere,’\r\n‘Blauncpayne’ by ‘Whitbred,’ and ‘Handsomebody,’ over which much\r\nobscurity has lingered, is, I have no hesitation in asserting, a\r\ndirectly Saxonised form of ‘Gentilcors,’ a name not unfrequently met\r\nwith at this date.\r\n\r\nMany of the names I have mentioned above, however, are, strange to say,\r\nbeing reproduced in the present day after a curious fashion. The\r\nmultiplication of forenames has been the primary cause of this.[628] In\r\nmany cases these, by becoming as it were adjectives to the surname, form\r\nsobriquets no less ludicrous and striking than those which for that very\r\nreason so soon became obsolete. Thus such a combination as ‘Choice\r\nPickrell’ is exactly equivalent to ‘Goodherring’ just alluded to. ‘Arch\r\nBishop’ restores the archiepiscopal name which fell into abeyance in the\r\ntwelfth century; while such other names as ‘Perfect Sparrow,’ ‘Savage\r\nBear,’[629] ‘Royal King,’ ‘Sing Song,’ ‘Ivory Mallet,’[630] ‘More\r\nFortune,’[631] ‘Christmas Day,’ ‘Paschal Lamb,’ ‘River Jordan,’[632] or\r\n‘Pine Coffin,’[633] may be met by designations equally absurd, if less\r\ntravestied. These, of course, must be attributed to mere eccentricity on\r\nthe part of parents, rather than to accident. Combinations of this kind,\r\nhowever, have arisen of late years through another circumstance. It not\r\nunfrequently occurs that through certain circumstances two family names\r\nare united. Thus we have such conjunctions as ‘Burdett-Coutts’ or\r\n‘Sclater-Booth.’ Speaking of these reminds me of a story I have heard\r\nanent a combination of this kind. A certain gentleman, it is said, of\r\nthe name of Colley, in bequeathing in his will a considerable estate to\r\na friend of the name of ‘Mellon,’ made it the condition of his\r\nacceptance that the legatee added his benefactor’s name to his own. His\r\nfriend had no objection to the property, but when he found that his\r\nacquiescence in the terms imposed would make him ‘Mellon-Colley’ to the\r\nend of his days, he considered the matter afresh and declined the offer.\r\n\r\n  (3) _Nicknames from Oaths, Exclamations, Street-cries, and Mottoes._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Oaths._—A remarkable, though not a very large, batch of surnames\r\nis to be referred to perhaps the most peculiar characteristic of\r\nall—that of the use of profane, or at least idle oaths. The prevalence\r\nof imprecations in mediæval times was simply extraordinary.[634] If the\r\nwritings of that period bear but the faintest comparison to the talk of\r\nmen, their conversation must have been strangely seasoned. For instance,\r\nin the ‘Canterbury Tales’ we find introduced without the slightest\r\nceremony such oaths as ‘for Cristes passion,’ ‘by Goddes saule,’ ‘for\r\nCristes saule,’ ‘by Goddes dignitee,’ ‘Goddes banes,’[635] ‘Cristes\r\npein,’ ‘Goddes love,’ ‘Goddes hate,’ ‘Cristes foot,’ ‘God me save,’ and\r\nthe more simple ‘By-God,’ or ‘Parde’ or ‘Pardieu.’ That they are mostly\r\nmeaningless is their chief characteristic. ‘John Pardieu’ in the Rolls\r\nof Parliament will represent our many ‘Pardews,’ ‘Pardows,’ ‘Pardoes,’\r\nand ‘Pardies;’ and although I have given a different origin in my second\r\nchapter,[636] I may mention ‘Alina le Bigod’ (J.), or ‘John le Bygot’\r\n(M.). ‘Barbara Godselve’[637] (F.F.), ‘Richard Godesname’ (X.), ‘Richard\r\nGodbeare’ (Z.), (now ‘Godbeer,’ ‘Godbehere,’ and ‘Goodbeer’), ‘Roger\r\nGodblod’ (E.) (God’s blood), ‘Alicia Godbodi’ (A.) (God’s body), seem\r\nall to be representative of familiar imprecations.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Mottoes._—In many cases we can scarcely doubt that ensigncy has\r\nhad something to do with the origin of our surnames. Edward III. at a\r\ntournament had his trappings embroidered with the couplet—\r\n\r\n                      Hay, hay, the white swan,\r\n                      By God’s soule I am thy man.\r\n\r\n‘Godsol’ and ‘Godsoule’ formerly existed, and may have so risen. Among\r\nother names of this class may be mentioned ‘Janett God-send-us’[638] (W.\r\n13), ‘Roger Deus-salvet-dominas,’[639] ‘John God-me-fetch,’ ‘John\r\nDieu-te-ayde,’ ‘John Flourdieu,’ ‘Henry Grace-dieu,’[640] ‘Henry\r\nWarde-dieu,’ ‘John Depart-dieu,’ and ‘John Angel-dieu.’[641] From the\r\nescutcheons of their wearers these would easily pass on to the men\r\nthemselves who first bore them as surnames.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Exclamations._—‘Peter Damegod’ (M.) and ‘John Domegode’ (O.),\r\nmeaning literally ‘Lord God,’ represent a once favourite expletive.[642]\r\nWe are here reminded that there was a time when ‘Dame,’ from _dominus_\r\nand _domina_ alike, was applied to either sex. One or two exclamations\r\nof less objectionable import are also to be met with. ‘William\r\nGodthanke’ (A.) seems but a reversal of our ‘Thank God,’ while ‘Ralph\r\nGodisped’ (A.), fossilised in our ‘Goodspeeds,’ may represent\r\n‘God-speed-thee.’[643] ‘Richard Farewel’ (A.), ‘Simon Welfare’ (A.),\r\n‘John Welcome’ (Z.Z.), ‘William Adieu’ (M.), would possess affixes\r\nreadily given for their kindly and oft utterance. Our ‘Rummelows,’\r\n‘Rummileys,’ and ‘Rumbelows,’ without dispute, represent but the old\r\nwell-known cry of ‘Rombylow’ or ‘Rummylow,’ the sailor’s ‘Heave-ho’ of\r\nlater days. In the ‘Squire of Low Degree’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                     Your mariners shall synge arow,\r\n                     Hey how, and rumbylow.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor of those who bear the name was doubtless a sailor at some\r\nperiod of his career.[644]\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Street-cries._—The calls of hawkers could not of course escape\r\nthe good-humoured raillery of our forefathers. We find ‘Robert\r\nFreshfissh’ (X.) to have been a fishmonger, and ‘John Freshfisch’ is set\r\ndown in the Rolls of Parliament. About the same time ‘Margaret\r\nFressheharyng’ dwelt in the Metropolis. ‘Agnes Godefouele’ (A.) and\r\n‘Basilia Godfowele’ (A.) were manifestly poultry-women, for even the\r\nmost respectable occupations were then, as I have already shown,\r\nitinerant. But perhaps the most curious thing of all is to notice the\r\nprice-calls that have found themselves inscribed in our registers. The\r\nlarger sums will have a different origin, but I place them here for\r\nconvenience sake. The Writs of Parliament give us a ‘Robert Peny;’ the\r\n‘Wills and Inventories’ (Surt. Soc.), a ‘Thomas Fourpeni;’ the Hundred\r\nRolls, a ‘John Fivepeni;’ the ‘Cal. Rot. Originalium,’ a ‘Thomas\r\nSexpenne;’ the ‘Yorkshire Wills and Inventories’ (Surt. Soc.), a ‘John\r\nNinepennies;’ and the Hundred Rolls, a ‘Fulco Twelpenes.’[645] ‘James\r\nFyppound’ (Fivepound) is mentioned in ‘Materials for History of Henry\r\nVII.’ So early as 1342 we find ‘John Twenti-mark’ to have been Rector of\r\nRisingham (Norfolk, 1, 64); while ‘William Hunderpound’ was Mayor of\r\nLynn Regis in 1417 (do. viii. 532). This latter may be a translation of\r\na Norman sobriquet, for ‘Grace Centlivre’ and ‘Joseph Centlivre’ are set\r\ndown in a Surrey register of the same date. (‘Hist. and Ant. Survey,’\r\nIndex.) In both cases, I doubt not, the nickname was acquired from the\r\npeculiarity of the source whence the income was derived. ‘Centlivre’\r\nexisted in the eighteenth century at least, for it was Mrs. Centlivre\r\nwho wrote the ‘Platonic Lady,’ which was issued in 1707. ‘Thomas\r\nThousandpound,’ the last of this class, appears in the ‘Wardrobe\r\nAccounts’ (Edward I.), and concludes a list as strange as the most\r\nardent ‘lover of the curious’ could desire.[646]\r\n\r\nLooking back, however, upon these earlier names, how many varied and\r\nconflicting qualities of the human heart do they all reflect, some\r\nhonourable, some harmlessly innocent, the greater part, I fear,\r\ndiscreditable. Of all how much might be said, but I refrain, lest I be\r\nliable to a charge of acting contrary to the spirit of the kindly old\r\nadage, ‘de mortuis nil nisi bonum’—‘speak no evil of the dead.’ Thus\r\ntelltale, however, are our surnames, and if it be no pleasant task to\r\nexpose the weaknesses and the frailties of them whose bones have so long\r\nere this crumbled into decay, still we may comfort ourselves with the\r\nremembrance that their names, with many others I could have adduced had\r\nspace permitted, offer no kind of reflection upon their present\r\npossessors. It is not unseldom we see the bearer of a worthy name\r\ndragging the same through the dust and mire of an ignoble life. It is\r\namongst these names of somewhat unsavoury origin we oftentimes meet with\r\nthe best, and the truest, and the noblest of our fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Alphabetical Letters appended to the Names furnished in the Index\r\n    refer to the Documents in the List here cited._\r\n\r\n    Hundred Rolls. _A._\r\n    Calendarium Inquisitionum Post Mortem. _B._\r\n    Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium in Turri Londinensi. _C._\r\n    Calendarium Rotulorum Chartarum. _D._\r\n    Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum in Turri Londonensi. _E._\r\n    Valor Ecclesiasticus. _F._\r\n    Calendarium Rotulorum Originalium. _G._\r\n    Rolls of Parliament. _H._\r\n    Placitorum in Dom.

It is\r\nsome consolation, however, to feel that, where I cannot instruct, I\r\nshall certainly not mislead, and that the reader will find, under each\r\nhead, all that is known to or suggested by the most competent writers I\r\nam acquainted with, either here or on the Continent.\r\n\r\nThat this work appears in a glossarial form arises from the desire of\r\nmany artists who have expressed to me the difficulty they constantly\r\nmeet in their endeavours to ascertain the complete form of a garment, or\r\nthe exact mode of fastening a piece of armour, or the buckling of a\r\nbelt, from their study of a sepulchral effigy or a figure in an\r\nillumination; the attitude of the personages represented or the\r\ndisposition of other portions of their attire effectively preventing the\r\nrequisite examination.\r\n\r\nThe books supplying any such information are very few, and the best\r\nconfined to armour or ecclesiastical costume. The only English\r\npublication of the kind required, that I am aware of, is the late Mr.\r\nFairholt’s ‘Costume in England’ (8vo. London, 1846), the last two\r\nhundred pages of which contain a glossary; the most valuable portion\r\nwhereof are the quotations from old plays, mediæval romances, and\r\nsatirical ballads containing allusions to various articles of attire in\r\nfashion at the time of their composition. Twenty-eight years have\r\nexpired since that book appeared, and it has been thought that a more\r\ncomprehensive work on the subject than has yet issued from the English\r\npress, combining the pith of the information of many costly foreign\r\npublications, and in its illustrations keeping in view the special\r\nrequirements of the artist to which I have alluded, would be, in these\r\ndays of educational progress and critical inquiry, a welcome addition to\r\nthe library of an English gentleman.\r\n\r\n                                                          J. R. PLANCHÉ.\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE OF ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Proofs of the ignorance of authors and authoresses in regard to\r\n  surnames might be cited to any extent. The novel of _Aurora Floyd_ is\r\n  a case in point. When we read the account there given of the ancestry\r\n  of the heroine, her Scotch descent, &c., and then remember that Floyd\r\n  is but a corruption (through the difficulty of pronunciation) of the\r\n  Welsh Lloyd, we may well be pardoned a smile. Walter Scott would never\r\n  have so committed himself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The following extract will show how patronymic surnames changed at\r\n  first with each successive generation:—‘Dispensation for Richard\r\n  _Johnson_, _son_ of _John_ Richardson, of Fishlake, and Evott daug: of\r\n  Robert Palmer, who have married, although related in the fourth\r\n  degree. Issued from Rome by Francis, Cardinal of St. Susanna, 30th\r\n  March, 13th Boniface IX. (1402).’ Test. Ebor. vol. iii. p. 318.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Thus we find in the _Manchester Directory_ for 1861, ‘Napoleon\r\n  Bonaparte Sutton, tripe-seller,’ and ‘Napoleon Stott, skewer-maker.’\r\n  Born, doubtless, during the earlier years of the present century,\r\n  their parents have thus stamped upon their lives the impress of that\r\n  fearful interest which the name of Napoleon then excited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ithell,’ though now unknown, was once a familiar Christian name.\r\n  ‘Evan ap Ithell,’ Z.; Jevan ap Ithell, Z.; Ann Ithell, H.H.; Ithell\r\n  Wynn, A.A.I. ‘Bethell’ as a surname is still sufficiently common in\r\n  the Principality to keep up a remembrance of the fact.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  ‘Howel’ or ‘Hoel’ was at one time a favourite Welsh baptismal name. We\r\n  have a ‘Howel le Waleys,’ that is, ‘Howel the Welshman,’ or, as we\r\n  should now say, ‘Howell Wallace,’ mentioned in the Parliamentary writs\r\n  of 1313. As I shall show by-and-by, our ‘Powells’ may in some cases,\r\n  at least, be of more English origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ot’ and ‘et’ sometimes became ‘elot’ and ‘elet’—‘Robert Richelot’ (w.\r\n  15) (from Richard); Crestolot de Eratis (d. d.) (from Christian);\r\n  ‘Walter Hughelot’ (A.); ‘John Huelot’ (A.) (from Hugh); Constance\r\n  Hobelot (A.) (from Hobbe); ‘Hamelet de la Burste’ (Cal. and Inv. of\r\n  Treasury); ‘Richard son of Hamelot’ (A.A. 2) (from Hamon). ‘Hamlet’\r\n  and ‘Hewlett’ are the commonest representatives of this class in our\r\n  existing nomenclature. As a diminutive suffix ‘let’ is found in such\r\n  words as ‘leaflet,’ ‘bracelet,’ ‘hamlet,’ or ‘ringlet.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The French have, among others of this class, ‘Guyon,’ ‘Philipon,’\r\n  ‘Caton’ (Catharine), and ‘Louison.’ Sir Walter Scott, ever most\r\n  accurate in his nomenclature, makes ‘Marthon’ to be domestic to\r\n  Hameline de Croye (Quentin Durward). None of these reached England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  As a Christian name, however, fashion has again brought it into\r\n  favour. While the memories that cluster round the name of the Iron\r\n  Duke live, ‘Arthur’ can never die. Indeed, there are as many\r\n  ‘Arthur-Wellesleys’ now as there were simple ‘Arthurs’ before the\r\n  battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  One John Godescalde was in 1298 forbidden to dwell in Oxford, owing to\r\n  some riot between Town and Gown (Mun. Acad. Oxon. p. 67).\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Herbert fil. Godman occurs in the ‘Cal. Rot. Pat. in _Turri\r\n  Londonensi_.’ As a personal name it will belong to the same class as\r\n  ‘Bateman,’ ‘Coleman,’ ‘Sweteman.’ Such entries as ‘Bateman Gille,’\r\n  ‘Thomas Batemanson,’ ‘Richard Batmonson,’ ‘Coleman le Hen,’ ‘Swetman\r\n  fil. Edith,’ or ‘Sweteman Textor,’ are not unfrequent. ‘Tiddeman’ is\r\n  of the same class. ‘Tydeman le Swarte’ and ‘Tiddeman Bokere’ both\r\n  occur in the fourteenth century. All the above are firmly established\r\n  as surnames. Having referred to ‘Sweetman,’ I may add that ‘Sweet’\r\n  itself was a baptismal name. ‘Swet le Bone’ (A), ‘John Swetson’\r\n  (‘State Papers, Domestic, 1619–1623’), ‘Adam Swetcoc’ (A).\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  While all these fuller forms are obsolete as surnames, we must not\r\n  forget that most of them still exist curtailed. From early days\r\n  ‘kettle’ in compounds became ‘kill’ or ‘kell.’ Thus ‘Thurkettle’ has\r\n  left us ‘Thurkell’ and ‘Thurkill,’ already mentioned. ‘Osketyl’ has\r\n  become ‘Oskell’ (‘Oskell Somenour,’ A. A. 3, vol. ii. p. 184).\r\n  ‘Ulchetel’ was registered as ‘Ulkell’ and ‘Ulchel’ (W. 12, pp. 19,\r\n  20). Our ‘Arkells’ (Sim. fil. Arkill, E.), I doubt not, are\r\n  corruptions of ‘Ansketyl’ or ‘Oscetyl’ or ‘Arketel.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Matthew Paris, under date 1047, says of the bishopric of Selsey,\r\n  ‘Defuncto Grinketel, Selesiensi pontifice, Hecca regis capellanus\r\n  successit.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  In these same Writs occurs also the name of ‘Hugh Serelson.’ It is\r\n  possible they are patronymics formed from ‘Cyril,’ but ‘Serle’ is the\r\n  more probable parent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  The ‘Parliamentary Writs’ give us ‘Matthew Arnyet,’ the ‘Hundred\r\n  Rolls,’ ‘Milisent Arnet.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  The ‘Hundred Rolls’ give us a pet addendum in the entry ‘Walter\r\n  Auberkin.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Amberson’ and ‘Robert Amberson’ may be seen in Barret’s\r\n  _History of Bristol_ (index). If not sprung from ‘Ambrose,’ they will\r\n  be but a variation of ‘Emberson,’ and one more instance of the change\r\n  of vowels referred to a few pages further on.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  As with ‘Brice’ so it is to the Danes we owe many entries in our older\r\n  records of which ‘Christian’ is the root. As a baptismal name it has\r\n  always been most common in those parts of the eastern coast of England\r\n  which have been brought into contact with Denmark by trade. Such names\r\n  as ‘Joan Cristina,’ ‘Brice Cristian,’ or ‘John fil. Christian,’\r\n  frequently occur in mediæval registers. Their descendants are now\r\n  found as ‘Christian,’ ‘Christy,’ and ‘Christison.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  As a proof that ‘Andrew’ and ‘Drew’ were distinct names, we may cite a\r\n  fact recorded in Mr. Riley’s _Memorials of London_. In the year 1400,\r\n  Drew Barentyn, twice Lord Mayor, came before the Council, asking to\r\n  have his name ‘Drew’ set down in the list of those who possessed the\r\n  freedom of the city, the scribe having entered it as ‘Andrew.’—pp.\r\n  554, 555.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  ‘Warren le Latimer’ occurs in the ‘Rolls of Parliament,’ and ‘Fulco\r\n  Fitz-Warren’ in the ‘Cal. Rot. Pat.’ in _Turri Londonensi_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Ivo de Usegate was Bailiff of York in 1271. A few years after we find\r\n  the Church of Askam Richard, close to the city, given by William de\r\n  Archis and Ivetta his wife to the Nunnery of Monkton. In 1729 Alicia\r\n  Iveson was buried in St. Martin’s, Micklegate. Thus in the one city we\r\n  have memorials of the male, female, and hereditary use of this name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  ‘Guido,’ as ‘Wydo,’ is found in such entries as ‘Will. fil. Wydo’ (A),\r\n  or ‘Will. fil. Wydonis’ (E), hence ‘Widowson’ and ‘Widdowson.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Matthew Rowlett was Master of the Mint to Henry VIII. (_See Pro. Ord.\r\n  Privy Council_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robinet of the Hill’ (Y). ‘Richard Robynet’ (H). ‘William Robertot’\r\n  (A).\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  We find the diminutive of this form in the name of ‘John Dobynette,’\r\n  who is mentioned in an inventory of goods, 1463. (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  The diminutive ‘Richelot’ was by no means unknown in England.\r\n  ‘Rikelot, tenant at Wickham’ (Domesday of St. Paul: Cam. Soc.),\r\n  ‘Robert Richelot’ (Great Roll of the Pipe), ‘Robert Richelot’\r\n  (Feodarum Prioratus Dunelm. Sur. Soc.). ‘Rickett’ is probably a\r\n  corruption of this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  The Norman ‘Diccon’ was corrupted into ‘Diggon.’ Spencer begins one of\r\n  his pastorals thus, Welsh-like:—\r\n\r\n                   ‘Diggon Davie, I bid her “Good-day,”\r\n                    Or Diggon her is, or I missay.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Diccon’ was popular among the English peasantry from the twelfth to\r\n  the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  A Richard Mileson entered C. C. Coll., Cam., in 1659 (Masters’ Hist.\r\n  C.C. Coll.). Edward Myleson occurs in the Calendar to Pleadings\r\n  (Elizabeth).\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  This rivalry seems to have made its mark upon the popular\r\n  superstitions of our forefathers, for to this day the _ignis fatuus_\r\n  of our marshy districts is called either ‘Will-a-Wisp’ or\r\n  ‘Jack-a-Lanthorn.’ It at least reminds us that there was a day when\r\n  every country clown was either ‘Jack’ or ‘Will.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  A certain John Willimote, a taverner, was sworn before the Chancellor\r\n  of Oxford University to sell good beer, 1434. (Mun. Acad. Oxon., p.\r\n  595). ‘Williametta Cantatrix.’ (Rot. Lit. Clausarum).\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  A curious spelling of this is found in the entry, ‘Haunce, the Luter,\r\n  ii.s—vi.d.’ (_Privy Purse Exp. Princess Mary_, p. 104.) ‘Hankin Booby’\r\n  was the common name for a clown. (_Chappell’s English Songs_, i. 73.)\r\n\r\n\r\n               ‘Thus for her love and loss poor Hankin dies,\r\n                His amorous soul down flies.’\r\n\r\n               _Musarum Deliciæ_, 1655.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  ‘Jack’ was really the nickname of Jacobus or James. Jacques was the\r\n  common name among the peasantry of France, and as a national sobriquet\r\n  was to that country what John was to England. On its introduction to\r\n  ourselves, it seems to have been tacitly accepted as but a synonym for\r\n  John, and has been used as such ever since.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir John’ (‘sir’ being the simple old-fashioned title of respect, as\r\n  in ‘sir knight,’ ‘sir king,’ &c.) was the familiar expression for a\r\n  priest. Bishop Bale speaks of them as ‘babbling Sir Johns.’ Bradford,\r\n  too, writing on the Mass, asks, ‘Who then, I say, will excuse these\r\n  mass-gospellers’ consciences? Will the Queen’s highness? She shall\r\n  then have more to do for herself than, without hearty and speedy\r\n  repentance, she can ever be able to answer, though Peter, Paul, Mary,\r\n  James, John, the Pope and all his prelates, take her part, with all\r\n  the singing “Sir Johns” that ever were, are, and shall be.’—_Bishop\r\n  Bradford’s Works._ Park. Soc., p. 391.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Thus Thomas Hale, a Puritan, writing in 1660 against May Games, has\r\n  some verses in which the Maypole is represented as saying—\r\n\r\n                 I have a mighty retinue,\r\n                 The scum of all the raskall crew\r\n                 Of fidlers, pedlers, jayle scaped slaves,\r\n                 Of tinkers, turncoats, tospot knaves,\r\n                 Of theeves and scape-thrifts many a one,\r\n                 With bouncing Besse and jolly Jone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a popular sobriquet for\r\n  Jane or Joan was ‘Jugg.’ In Espinasses’ ‘Lancashire Worthies,’ Joan,\r\n  the daughter of the celebrated Dr. Byrom, is familiarly styled ‘Jugg.’\r\n  A song of James I.’s reign says—\r\n\r\n              ‘_Joan_, Siss, and Nell, shall all be ladified,\r\n               Instead of hay carts, in coaches shall ride.’\r\n\r\n  This is Mr. Chappell’s version. (_English Songs_, i. 327.) In Hunter’s\r\n  ‘Hallamshire,’ it runs—\r\n\r\n              ‘_Jugg_, Cis, and Nell, shall all be ladified.’\r\n\r\n  A ballad of Queen Anne’s reign represents John, the swain, as singing—\r\n\r\n             ‘My heart and all’s at thy command,\r\n              And tho’ I’ve never a foot of land,\r\n              Yet six fat ewes and one milch cow,\r\n              I think, my Jug, is wealth enow.’\r\n                       (_Pills to Purge Melancholy_, i. 293.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  In the _Athenæ Oxoniensis_ the account of Martin Marprelate begins\r\n  ‘John Penry, or Ap-Henry, that is, the son of Henry, better known by\r\n  the name of Martin Marprelate, or Marpriest, &c.’ (Edit. 1813, vol. i.\r\n  p. 591.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  An uncouth spelling of this is met with in the De Lacy Inquisition,\r\n  where the entry occurs: ‘Henry, son of Holekyn, for 17½ acres of land,\r\n  4_s._ 6_d._ (Cheth. Soc., p. 12.) ‘King Hal’ is still familiar to us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  ‘To Garrett Jonson, for shoes, x_s._ x_d._’ ‘To Garratt Jonson, for\r\n  shoes, iii_s._’ (Hous. Exp.

Bishop Swinfield, p. 170, Cam.\r\n  Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  In the ‘Romaunt of the Rose,’ it is said—\r\n\r\n                 ‘For right no more than Gibbe, our cat,\r\n                  That awaiteth mice and rattes to killen,\r\n                  Ne entend I but to beguilen.’\r\n\r\n  In Peele’s ‘Edward I.,’ too, the Novice says to the Friar—\r\n\r\n                   ‘Now, Master, as I am true wag,\r\n                    I will be neither late, nor lag,\r\n                    But go and come with gossips cheer,\r\n                    Ere Gib, our cat, can lick her ear.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Hence the old term, ‘flibber-gib,’ or ‘flitter-gibbett,’ employed by\r\n  Latimer, Burton, &c.; and later, by Walter Scott, for one of vile\r\n  propensities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  A notorious rascal named ‘Gybby Selby’ is mentioned in ‘Calendar of\r\n  State Papers’ for 1562. This accords with ‘Robert Gybbyson,’ found in\r\n  the Corpus Christi Guild, York, a few years earlier.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, payde to Hew Watson, for a bawdrike to the first belle, x_d._’\r\n  (1546.) (Churchwardens’ Accounts at Ludlow, Camden Soc.) ‘Item, for\r\n  markynge of Hew Davis’ pew, xii_d._’ (1552.) (do.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hugyn held of the same Earl an oxgang of land.’ (De Lacy Inquisit.,\r\n  Cheth. Soc., p. 6.) ‘Huckin’ seems to be a corruption of ‘Hughkin.’\r\n  ‘Hughkin Byston’ occurs in ‘Wills and Inventories.’ (Cheth. Soc., i.\r\n  142.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  A servant of King Henry III. was called by the simple and only name of\r\n  ‘Pentecostes.’ (Inquisit. 13 Ed. I. No. 13.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  In the old published orders for the sheriff’s annual riding in the\r\n  city of York, occurs this rule among others:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Also, we command that no manner of men walk in the city, nor in the\r\n  suburbs by night, without Torch before him, _i.e._ from _Pasche_ to\r\n  Michaelmas after ten of the clock, and from Michaelmas to _Pasche_\r\n  after nine of the clock.’ These rules are thus prefaced. ‘The\r\n  sheriffs, by the custom of the city, do ride to several parts thereof\r\n  every year, betwixt Michaelmas and _Midwinter_, that is _Yoole_.’\r\n  (‘Hist. and Ant. York,’ vol. ii. p. 54.) Lancashire Easter-eggs are\r\n  still called Pace-eggs.—The harder ‘Paske’ is found in Wicklyffe’s\r\n  Version of Matt. xxvi. 1:—‘Whaune Jhesus hadde endid all these words\r\n  he seide to his disciplis, ye weten that after tweyn days, Paske schal\r\n  be made.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Richard Domesdaye was Rector of Caldecote, Norfolk, in 1435.\r\n  (Blomefield). This would be synonymous with ‘Termday.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  I see, however, from the Clerical Directory, that ‘Hindson’ is still\r\n  in existence. A ‘Nicholas Hopperson’ is found in an old college\r\n  register for 1582. (Hist. C. C. Coll. Cam.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  This name seems to have been very popular in Yorkshire. The instances\r\n  given in the index are taken from papers relating to that county.\r\n  Thus, again, we find it occurring in the marriage dispensations and\r\n  licences of the period. ‘Dispensation from Selow for Richard de\r\n  Akerode and Emmotte de Greenwood to marry, they being related in the\r\n  fourth degree. Issued from Rome by Jordan Bishop of Alba, Apr. 27th,\r\n  3rd Eugenius IV.’ (1433.)—(Test. Ebor. vol. iii. p. 317); ‘Licence to\r\n  the Vicar of Bradford to marry Roger Prestwick and Emmote Crossley.\r\n  Banns thrice in one day.’ (1466.)—Do. p. 338.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  We must not forget that at first a certain strangeness must have been\r\n  felt in terming a woman by such a contradictory sobriquet as ‘Alice\r\n  John_son_’ or ‘Parnel Sim_son_.’ The feminine desinence was\r\n  occasionally attempted. ‘Alicia Thom_doghter_’ is found in the ‘Test.\r\n  Ebor.’ (Sur. Soc.), ‘Isabella Peers_doghter_’ and ‘Isolda\r\n  Peers_doghter_’ in Feod. Prior. Dunelm. (Sur. Soc.), and ‘Avice\r\n  Matte_wife_’ in the ‘Issue Roll.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, I gyffe to Sicille Metcalfe, my sister’s doughter,\r\n  20_s._’—‘Richmondshire Wills,’ p. 128.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  A curious proof of the popularity of this pet form is met with in the\r\n  Manor of ‘Ashton-under-Lyne’ (Ch. Soc.). In a community of some 20 or\r\n  25 families were the following:—‘Syssot, wife of Patrick,’ ‘Syssot,\r\n  wife of Diccon Wilson,’ ‘Syssot, wife of Thomas the Cook,’ and\r\n  ‘Syssot, wife of Jak of Barsley.’ Robert Syssottysone, Rector of\r\n  Lecceworthe, 1478 (xx. 2, p. 187).\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  In the Corpus Christi Guild, York, 1433 (Sur. Soc.), Dyot is feminine.\r\n  There is set down, ‘Robert Hayne et Dyot uxor.’ The patronymic\r\n  ‘Diotson’ is found in the same register.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  I say ‘perhaps’ because it may be but a corruption of the local\r\n  Mapleston.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Sabyn or Sabina is frequently met with in the Hundred Rolls, as also\r\n  Sybyl, referred to in the line before. A church at Rome was dedicated\r\n  to a St. Sabina. Sybyl has bequeathed us ‘Sibson.’ In Cocke Lorelles\r\n  Bote, one of the personages introduced is ‘Sybby Sole, mylke wyfe of\r\n  Islynton.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Jack and Jill seem ever to have been associated.\r\n\r\n            Will squabbled in a tavern very sore,\r\n            Because one brought a _gill_ of wine no more;\r\n            Fill me a quart, quoth he, I’m called Will,\r\n            The proverbe is, each _Jack_ shall have his _Gill_.\r\n\r\n            _Satyricall Epigrams_, 1619.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  One can scarce forbear a smile to find in the ‘Townley Mysteries’\r\n  Noah’s wife, being pressed by her husband to enter the ark, replying—\r\n\r\n                   Sir, for Jak nor for Gille\r\n                     Wille I turne my face\r\n                   Tille I have on this hille\r\n                     Spun a space upon my rok (distaft).\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  We must not forget a once familiar corruption of the diminutive\r\n  ‘Juliet’ into ‘Juet.’ Such entries as ‘Juetta fil. William’ (T.),\r\n  ‘Richard fil. Juetta’ (T.), ‘William Juet’ (A.), or ‘Christopher\r\n  Jewitson’ (Z.) are very common in the rolls of the xiiith and xivth\r\n  centuries. This, in the North, was pronounced ‘Jowet,’ hence such\r\n  entries as ‘Roger fil. Jowettæ’ (T.), ‘Jowet Barton’ (W. 11), and our\r\n  surname ‘Jowett.’ ‘Jewitt’ also exists. One of this name was a jockey\r\n  in the Derby of 1874.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  So, also, in another place the same translator says: ‘The kyngdom of\r\n  hevenes is lyk to a marchaunt that seekith gode margarites, but whanne\r\n  he hath founde one precious margarite, he wente and solde alle thingis\r\n  that he hadde and boughte it.’—Matt. xiii. 45, 46. Foxe too, in his\r\n  ‘Book of Martyrs,’ quotes Isidorus to the effect that John the Apostle\r\n  ‘turned certain pieces of wood into gold, and stones by the seaside\r\n  into margarites.’—Vol. i. p. 28, edit. 1844.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  ‘Barbara,’ as another Greek virgin-martyr, may be set beside Margaret.\r\n  ‘Barbe’ was the French form. As we shall see by-and-by, our\r\n  ‘Simbarbes’ and ‘Simbarbs’ hail from St. Barbe in Normandy. (Jordan de\r\n  St. Barbe, M., Thomas Seyntbarbe, B.) The Hundred Rolls register three\r\n  pet forms as surnames. ‘Bertol Babbe,’ ‘John Barbot,’ and ‘Nicholas\r\n  Barbelot.’ The latter belongs to the class in _elot_ of which\r\n  ‘Robelot,’ ‘Hewelot’ and ‘Hamelot’ are instances.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  The various forms of the diminutive are found as Christian names in\r\n  the ‘Manor of Ashton-under-Lyne’ (Ch. Soc.), where occur such entries\r\n  as ‘Magot, that was wife of Richard,’ ‘Merget of Staley,’ ‘Marget of\r\n  Stanly,’ ‘Mergret, that was wife of Hobbe.’—pp. 96–7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above, I find several notices in Brand’s ‘Popular\r\n  Antiquities’ which, while corroborating the view I have taken, shed a\r\n  clearer light as to Maid Marian’s other sobriquet of ‘Malkin.’ In his\r\n  allusion to the Morris dances, he quotes Beaumont and Fletcher as\r\n  saying—\r\n\r\n                 ‘Put on the shape of order and humanity,\r\n                  Or you must marry Malkin, the May-lady.’\r\n\r\n  Thus far, then, adding this to Mr. Halliwell’s quotation, we find that\r\n  Maid Marian for several centuries was also ‘Malkin.’ But we must\r\n  remember that it was during this very period that Robin Hood and his\r\n  mistress were popularly believed to be Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, and\r\n  Matilda, daughter of Lord Fitzwalter. That the May Queen, therefore,\r\n  should be occasionally styled ‘Malkin’ will appear natural enough if\r\n  we accept the view of the origin of that name as recorded in the text.\r\n  But it may be asked how did she get the sobriquet of ‘Marian’? Perhaps\r\n  Mr. Steevens’s quotation from an old play, ‘The Downfall of Rob. Earl\r\n  of Huntingdon,’ dated 1401, may help us—\r\n\r\n              ‘Next ’tis agreed (if thereto she agree)\r\n               That fair Matilda henceforth change her name;\r\n               And, while it is the chance of Robin Hoode\r\n               To live in Sherwodde a poor outlaw’s life,\r\n               She by Maid Marian’s name be called.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  It has been thought by some that our ‘Makins’ and ‘Makinsons’ are from\r\n  Matthew, and not in any way connected with feminine nomenclature. This\r\n  may be so, for although there is the entry ‘Maykina Parmunter’ in the\r\n  Parliamentary Rolls, there is also ‘Maykinus Lappyng’ in Materials for\r\n  Hist. Reign of Henry VII.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Mawdeson (F. F.) would lead one to suppose that Mawson was a\r\n  direct corruption. It may be so, but ‘Maw’ itself seems to have\r\n  existed as a pet form of Maud. In the ‘De Lacy Inquisition’ (1311)\r\n  there occurs ‘Richard, son of Mawe, for 25 acres, etc.’—p. 10 (Chelt.\r\n  Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  The preceding paragraphs will sufficiently answer, I doubt not, the\r\n  questions of correspondents in ‘Notes and Queries,’ as to whether we\r\n  have _any_ surnames derived from female baptismal names.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth came into use too late to leave any mark upon our surnames.\r\n  I have not come across, to the best of my remembrance, a single\r\n  instance in any record earlier than the fifteenth century. ‘Bess,’ or\r\n  ‘Bessie,’ was the first pet name formed from it, and this very\r\n  probably began to grow into favour about the time of Elizabeth\r\n  Woodville’s marriage. With the proud imperious Queen Bess, however,\r\n  came in every conceivable variety that could be played upon the name,\r\n  ‘Betsey,’ or ‘Betsy,’ ‘Betty,’ ‘Eliza,’ ‘Lizzie,’ and ‘Libbie’ being\r\n  the favourites. The first ‘Bessie’ I find is that of ‘Bessye Tripps,’\r\n  1558; the first ‘Betty’ being that of ‘Bettye Sheile,’ 1580, both\r\n  being in a Newcastle will. Betty for two centuries was, perhaps, the\r\n  form most in favour in aristocratic circles. How fickle is fashion! It\r\n  is entirely tabooed there in the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Thomas and John Ibson are recorded in the ‘Corpus Christi Guild,’\r\n  York. (Surt. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  ‘George Hall et Ezota uxor ejus.’ York Guild (W. 11).\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hamne, son of Adecok, held 29 acres.’ (De Lacy Inquis. p. 19, Ch.\r\n  Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  A proof that this origination is correct is found in a York will dated\r\n  1391. William de Kyrkby bequeaths articles to ‘Evæ uxori Johannes\r\n  Parvying,’ and to ‘Willielmo de Rowlay,’ and then at the close he\r\n  speaks of them as the aforementioned ‘Evotam et dictum Willielmum\r\n  Rowlay.’ (Test. Elor., vol. i. p. 145–6. Surt. Soc.) An old London\r\n  record, dated 1379, contains amongst other names those of ‘Custance\r\n  Busshe’ and ‘Evota de Durham.’ The owner would be familiarly known\r\n  among her acquaintances as ‘Evote’ or ‘Evette.’ (_Memorials of\r\n  London_, p. 435.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sacred to the memory of George Higgott,’ etc. Bonsall Church,\r\n  Derbyshire. The more common form is ‘Higgett.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  ‘Dawe Robson, et Alicia uxor ejus.’ (W. 11.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  ‘Damsel’ is, of course, the diminutive of this. As a surname, it is\r\n  found in the cases of ‘Simon Damesell’ (H.R.) and ‘Lawrence Damysell’\r\n  (W. 2). Other diminutives are met with in ‘Damietta Porcell’ (Hist.\r\n  and Ant. Survey, index), ‘Damietta Avenell’ (F. F.), ‘Dametta fil.\r\n  Morell’ (D. D.); hence as surnames our ‘Damets,’ ‘Dametts,’ ‘Damiots,’\r\n  and ‘Domitts.’ Entries like ‘Alice Damyett’ (Z), ‘Hugh Damiot’ (A),\r\n  ‘Henry Damett’ (R), and ‘Henry Domet’ (A) are common.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Jordanson and Margery Jordanson occur in ‘Three Lancashire\r\n  Documents’ (Cheth. Soc.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  ‘Jud,’ now the pet form of George, was formerly that of Jordan. In\r\n  Gower’s lines, already quoted, it is said—\r\n\r\n                    ‘Hudde’ ferit, quem ‘Judde’ terit,\r\n\r\n  This reminds us of Aron Judde in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  Dean Stanley seems to have the impression that this custom was\r\n  confined to the pilgrims of Italy and Spain. In his _Sinai and\r\n  Palestine_, page 333, he says: ‘The name of the river has in Italy and\r\n  Spain, by a natural association, been turned into a common Christian\r\n  name for children at the hour of baptism, which served to connect them\r\n  with it.’ Judging by existing traces merely, I doubt whether the\r\n  practice was quite so familiar in those countries as our own.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Ellicot seems to be a sort of feminine from Elisota. ‘Item do et lego\r\n  Elisotæ domicellæ meæ 40_s._’ (Will of William de Aldeburgh, 1391.\r\n  Test. Ebor. vol. i. p. 151.) ‘Item, lego Elisotæ, uxori Ricardi\r\n  Bustard unam vaccam et 10_s._’ (Will of Patrick de Barton, 1391. Test.\r\n  Ebor. vol. i. p. 155.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  We cannot but believe, however, that in many instances these two are\r\n  but the offspring of ‘Alice,’ at this period one of the most popular\r\n  of female names. Nor must we forget that Alison was itself a personal\r\n  name, this being the Norman-French pet form of Alice, after the\r\n  fashion of Marion, Louison, Beaton, etc. We are all acquainted with\r\n  the ‘Alison’ of the ‘Canterbury Tales’—\r\n\r\n                ‘This Alison answered: Who is there\r\n                 That knocketh so? I warrant him a thefe.’\r\n\r\n  We meet with it again in an old Yorkshire will: ‘Item, to Symkyn, and\r\n  Watkyn and Alison Meek, servandes of John of Bolton, to ilk on of yaim\r\n  (them) 26_s._ 8_d._’ (Test. Ebor., vol. iii p. 21. Surtees. Soc.) This\r\n  name is found in our more formal registers in such an entry as ‘Alison\r\n  Gelyot.’ (Parl. Rolls.) With regard to ‘Alis’ and ‘Elis,’ and ‘Alison’\r\n  and ‘Elison,’ recorded in the text, I may remind the reader that A and\r\n  E were all but convertible letters with the Normans. One of their\r\n  favourite female names, that of ‘Aveline,’ is found equally often as\r\n  ‘Eveline,’ and in the form of ‘Evelyn’ it came down to the\r\n  distinguished writer of the seventeenth century. ‘Arnold’ and\r\n  ‘Ernold,’ ‘Americ’ and ‘Emeric,’ ‘Amelia’ and ‘Emilia,’ ‘Anota,’ and\r\n  ‘Enota,’ and ‘Amelot’ and ‘Emelot’ are but other instances in point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  I am confirmed in my view by finding ‘Eliot’ registered as ‘Alyott.’\r\n  ‘Alyott de Symondston held half an oxgang of land, xix_d._’ (De Lacy\r\n  Inquisition (1311) Cheth. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Perrin was formed from ‘Pierre,’ as ‘Huggin’ from Hugh or ‘Colin’\r\n  from Nicol. ‘The wife of Peryn’ is mentioned in ‘Manor of\r\n  Ashton-under-Lyne’ (Ch. Soc.), p. 97. Perrot, or Parrot, represents\r\n  also the French diminutive. ‘Alan Fitz-Pirot was a benefactor to St.\r\n  Alban’s Monastery.’ (See Clutterbuck’s _Hertford_, Appendix, vol.\r\n  i.) Prince Edward used to call the favourite, Piers Gaveston, by the\r\n  familiar title of ‘Perot.’ (See _Notes and Queries_, vii. 280, and\r\n  Lower on ‘Perrot.’)\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  There can be little doubt that ‘Potts’ comes from ‘Philpotts.’ We\r\n  light upon a ‘Thomas Potkin’ (H.H.), proving that the abbreviation was\r\n  in use.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  A well-known Durham family of the name of ‘Burletson’ existed till the\r\n  close of the eighteenth century in that county, and I am not sure that\r\n  it does not still survive there. This, I doubt not, is but a\r\n  corruption of ‘Bartelotson’ or ‘Bartleson.’ (_Vide_ Surtees’ _History\r\n  of Durham_, vol. i. p. 106.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  John Toloson was Sheriff of London in 1237.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  The romance form, ‘Thomasine,’ existed till recent days, and was at\r\n  the zenith of its popularity in Elizabeth’s reign. It is found in\r\n  every register of that period. It is found as ‘Thomasing’ in\r\n  Worksworth Ch. (Derbyshire): ‘Thomasing, filia William Sympson; buried\r\n  Jan. 31, 1640.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Thus Skelton, in _Why come ye nat to Courte?_ says:—\r\n\r\n                       ‘Twit, Andrewe, twit, Scot,\r\n                        Ge hame, ge scour thy pot.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  An instance of the diminutive is found in ‘Thomas Jemmitt,’ recorded\r\n  in Clutterbuck’s _Hertford_, Index, vol. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  Thus, in _Why come ye nat to Courte?_ Skelton introduces such\r\n  fictitious characters as—\r\n\r\n                     ‘Havell, and Harvy Hafter,\r\n                      Jack Travell, and Cole Crafter.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  I have stated in p. 80 that Polson is nothing more than Paulson. A\r\n  proof of this is found in the case of ‘Pol Withipol,’ who was summoned\r\n  to attend the council to show why the statute passed 27th Henry VIII.,\r\n  for the making of broadcloths and kerseys, should not be\r\n  repealed.—Proc. and Ord. Privy Council, vii. 156.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Capgrave, in his ‘Chronicles,’ under date 1394, says: ‘In this time\r\n  the Lolardis set up scrowis at Westminster and at Poules.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Lord Macaulay has noticed this. Speaking of the Old Testament, and in\r\n  respect of the old Puritans, he says: ‘In such a history it was not\r\n  difficult for fierce and gloomy spirits to find much that might be\r\n  distorted to suit their wishes. The extreme Puritans, therefore, began\r\n  to feel for the Old Testament a preference which, perhaps, they did\r\n  not distinctly avow even to themselves, but which showed itself in all\r\n  their sentiments and habits. They paid to the Hebrew language a\r\n  respect which they refused to that tongue in which the discourses of\r\n  Jesus and the epistles of Paul have come down to us. They baptized\r\n  their children by the names, not of Christian saints, but of Hebrew\r\n  patriarchs and warriors.’—(_Hist. Eng._ ch. 1.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  The most curious illustration of this class is that of ‘Melcom Groat’\r\n  (T.T.). ‘Milcom, the abomination of the children of Ammon.’—2 Kings,\r\n  xxiii. 13. This is a conversion by baptism which would astonish\r\n  equally Mr. Spurgeon and Dr. Pusey, I should imagine. A sister of\r\n  Archbishop Leighton (son of a much persecuted Presbyterian minister)\r\n  was ‘Sapphira.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  The same writer quotes from the register of Waldron the following\r\n  curious entry:—‘Flie-fornication, the bace sonne of Catren Andrewes,\r\n  bapt. ye 17th Desemb., 1609.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Rev. Experience Mayhew, A.M., born Feb. 5th, 1673, died of an\r\n  apoplexy, Nov. 9th, 1758.’ He was a missionary to Vineyard Island.\r\n  (_Vide_ ‘Pulpit,’ Dec. 6, 1827.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  ‘Here lieth the body of Abstinence Pougher, Esq., who died Sept. 5th,\r\n  1741, aged 62 years.’ (All Saints, Leicester. _Vide_ Nicholls’\r\n  ‘Leicester.’)\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Increase Mather was sent from New England to represent to James\r\n  II. the gratitude of the Dissenters for a Toleration Act in 1685.\r\n  (_Vide_ Neales’ ‘Puritans,’ vol. v. p. 31.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Rev. Accepted Frewen (died 1664) was Archbishop of York, and son of a\r\n  Puritan minister in Sussex. (_Vide_ Walker’s ‘Sufferings of Clergy,’\r\n  p. 38.) ‘Thankfull’ was his brother.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Livewell Sherwood, an alderman of Norwich, was put on a commission\r\n  for sequestering Papists, in 1643. (Scobell’s ‘Orders of Parl.,’ p.\r\n  38.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Faythful Fortescue. (‘Visitation of Yorkshire.’)\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robert Thyer and Silence Leigh, married Dec. 9, 1741.’ (St. Ann’s,\r\n  Manchester.) She was evidently the daughter of some old stickler for\r\n  St. Paul’s doctrine—‘Let the women learn in silence, with all\r\n  subjection’—or had he been himself a sufferer in his married life?\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Charles Chauncy died in New England, 1671. He went from Hertfordshire,\r\n  where the family had been settled for centuries. His children were\r\n  ‘Isaac,’ ‘Ichabod,’ ‘Sarah,’ ‘Barnabas,’ ‘Elnathan,’ ‘Nathaniel,’ and\r\n  ‘Israel.’ (Clutterbuck’s _Hertford_, vol. ii. 401.) Elnathan and\r\n  Nathaniel are the same, with syllables reversed, like ‘Theodora’ and\r\n  ‘Dorothea.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n            ‘What is your name?’ then said Robin Hood,\r\n              ‘Come, tell me, without any fail;’\r\n            ‘By the faith of my body,’ then said the young man,\r\n              ‘My name it is Allan a Dale.’\r\n\r\n            (_Robin Hood_, vol. ii, 261.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  One of the best puns extant is put to the credit of the Duke of\r\n  Buckingham by Walter Scott, in his _Peveril of the Peak_. A Mrs.\r\n  Cresswell, who had borne anything but a creditable character,\r\n  bequeathed 10_l._ for a funeral sermon, in which nothing ill-natured\r\n  was to be said of her. The duke wrote the following brief but pointed\r\n  discourse: ‘All I shall say of her is this: she was born _well_, she\r\n  married _well_, she lived _well_, and she died _well_; for she was\r\n  born at “Shad-well,” married to “Cress-well,” lived at “Clerken-well,”\r\n  and died in “Bride-well.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  A will, dated 1553, among other bequests mentions: ‘Also to _my nawnt_\r\n  Bygott an old angell of golde.’ The old angel, I need not say, refers\r\n  to the coin, not the aunt. (Richmondshire Wills, p. 76.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  This name thus formed existed till the sixteenth century, at least,\r\n  for ‘Christopher Nend’ is set down in the Corpus Christi Guild, York,\r\n  1530.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  William de Okholt is found in the ‘Inquis. post mortem.’ This would be\r\n  the original form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  ‘Emelina de Hogshawe’ (Inquis. post mortem). The name is now extinct,\r\n  I believe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Deardens,’ however, may be in some cases but a corruption of the\r\n  old ‘Derneden’—that is, the secret or secluded den. The Hundred Rolls\r\n  give us, for instance, a ‘Ralph de Derneden.’ This word ‘dern’ was\r\n  then in the most familiar use. Thus, in ‘Cursor Mundi,’ mention is\r\n  made of ‘a mountain dern.’ Chaucer speaks of ‘derne love,’ and Piers\r\n  Plowman of ‘derne usurie.’ Our ‘Durnfords’ but represent such an early\r\n  entry as ‘Robert de Derneford;’ and of names now obsolete, we might\r\n  instance ‘Dernehus,’ found also in the same roll as the above. Our\r\n  ‘Dernes’ simple probably originated in the reticent and cautious\r\n  disposition of their first ancestor. We may take this opportunity of\r\n  noticing that ‘Dibdin’ is but ‘Deepden.’ One of our older rolls has a\r\n  ‘Randolph de Depeden.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  By ‘ley’ I include both ‘lee,’ a shelter, and ‘lea,’ a pasture, for it\r\n  is impossible to distinguish the two.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  ‘John de Foxlee’ is mentioned. (Fines, Ric. I.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  More personal forms are found in ‘Henry Legeman’ (H.R.) and ‘Elias\r\n  Layman’ (H.R.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  ‘William de Waldeslade’ occurs in the ‘Great Roll of the Pipe.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Quite as good a story, and one less objectionable, is told of a\r\n  Scottish Member of Parliament called Dunlop, who, at a large dinner\r\n  party, having asserted that no one could make a pun upon his name, met\r\n  with the instant reply from one of his guests, ‘Oh, yes, I can. _Lop_\r\n  off the last syllable, and it is _done_.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  Thus in the ‘Proverbs of Hending,’ it is said: ‘When the coppe is\r\n  fullest, then the hair is fairest.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Talking of ‘Manners,’ however, we may add one on the celebrated\r\n  Marquis of Granby:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘What conquest now will Britain boast,\r\n                    Or where display her banners?\r\n                   Alas! in Granby she has lost\r\n                    True courage and good _Manners_.’\r\n\r\n  Puns of this nature may be met with frequently in books of the last\r\n  century. Some complimentary verses to Dr. Gill, on account of a\r\n  supposed victory in a public controversy, in 1727, in support of\r\n  immersion at baptism, have a play of this kind at one part:—\r\n\r\n              ‘Stennet,’ at first, his furious foe did meet,\r\n              Cleanly compelled him to a swift retreat;\r\n              Next powerful ‘Gale,’ by mighty blast made fall\r\n              The Church’s Dagon, the gigantic ‘Wall.’\r\n                                (_Gill’s Works_, edit. 1839.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Our now vulgar term ‘nob’ is a relic of this: ‘To hit a man on the\r\n  nob’ is, in the north, to strike on the head. In the same districts a\r\n  ‘nob’ is a rich man, one of family and influence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  Our Authorised Version has it, in Exodus xxv. 33: ‘Three bowls made\r\n  like unto almonds, with a knop and flower in one branch.’ Here a bud\r\n  is evidently intended. I need scarcely say that ‘knob’ is but the\r\n  modern form of this word.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  Besides ‘David atte Lawe’ (M.), we have the more personal ‘John\r\n  Laweman’ (A.), or ‘Ranulf Laweman’ (A.). I doubt not these are also\r\n  local, but one cannot help thinking of Chaucer’s ‘Sergeant of the\r\n  Lawe, ware and wise.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  ‘William de Thornover’ and ‘Walter de Ashovere’ will represent\r\n  compound forms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Several local names of this class are found with ‘tree’ appended.\r\n  Thus, ‘Thomas Appletree’ occurs in the Chancery suits of Elizabeth;\r\n  and ‘Crabtree,’ ‘Plumtree,’ or ‘Plumptree,’ and ‘Rowntree’ (rowantree)\r\n  may still be seen in our busiest streets.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  In the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ Jacob, in his vision, is represented as\r\n  saying:—\r\n\r\n                    ‘And now is here none othere gate\r\n                     But Godes howse and hevens yate.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  I believe this word is not yet extinct in our North-country\r\n  vocabulary. A Yorkshire inventory of goods, of 1540 or thereabouts,\r\n  concludes by stating what moneys had been discovered in corners and\r\n  out of the way places in the house: ‘In hernes, xiii_s._ iiii_d._;\r\n  item, x sylver spones, xxiii_s._iiii_d._’ (Richmondshire Wills, p.\r\n  41.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Thus, also, is it with ‘Duffus.’ We find it in the Hundred Rolls set\r\n  down in the same form as ‘de Duffus’ or ‘del Duffus,’ the more literal\r\n  dress being met with in the London city archives in the name of\r\n  ‘Thomas Dufhous.’ (_Vide_ Riley’s _Memorials of London_, p. 555.)\r\n  ‘Dove-house’ is the root.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  ‘Agnes atte Punfald’ (A.) reminds us of our ‘Penfold,’ or ‘Pinfold,’\r\n  _i.e._ the pound.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ralph ate Med’ (A.). ‘Philip atte Medde’ (M). In the Hundred Rolls we\r\n  find ‘William le Medward’ corresponding to ‘Hayward.’ (_Vide_ p. 198.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  ‘His tenants, the graingers, are tyed to come themselves and winde the\r\n  woll, they have a fatte weather and a fatte lambe killed, and a dinner\r\n  provided for their paines.’ (Henry Best’s _Farming Book_ (1641), p.\r\n  97.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Grangeman’ occurs in the Proc. in Chancery. (Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  The coney, or rabbit, has made a mark upon our local nomenclature. An\r\n  old form of the word was ‘coning’ or ‘conig.’ Thus Piers Plowman\r\n  says:—\r\n\r\n                    ‘The while he caccheth conynges,\r\n                     He coveiteth naught youre caroyne,\r\n                     But feedeth hym all with venyson.’\r\n\r\n  Relics of this are found in such an entry as ‘Nicolas Conyng’ or\r\n  ‘Peter Conyng,’ though now met with as ‘Coney.’ More local\r\n  registrations, such as ‘Thomas de Conyton,’ ‘John de Conington,’ ‘John\r\n  de Conyngsby,’ or ‘Walter de Cunnyngby,’ are still familiarised to us\r\n  in ‘Conington’ and ‘Coningsby.’ The North English form was ‘Cuning,’\r\n  whence the ‘de Cunnyngby’ above instanced and our modern\r\n  ‘Cunninghams.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Lower’s _Surnames_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  One of Edward III.’s regulations concerning the sale and purchase of\r\n  wool speaks of ‘merchandises en Engleterre, Gales, ou Irlande;’ and\r\n  further on more personally of ‘merchantz Engleis, Galeis, ou Irreis.’\r\n  (‘Stat. of Realm,’ vol. i. p. 334.) ‘Henry le Galeys,’ that is, as we\r\n  should say now, ‘Henry Welsh,’ was Mayor of London in 1298.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  In two different rolls we come across such cognomens as ‘Osbert\r\n  Diabolus’ and ‘Roger le Diable.’ These are very likely but relics of\r\n  early jesting upon the local forms mentioned in the text. A ‘Thomas de\r\n  Devyle’ occurs in the Parliamentary Rolls, while in the Writs of the\r\n  same we find a ‘John de Evylle.’ The former instance, again, may be\r\n  but a sarcastic reduplication of the prefix. Dean Milman, quoting the\r\n  author of _Anglia Judaica_, tells the following story, which shows how\r\n  early this name had been so played upon:—‘A certain Jew travelling\r\n  towards Shrewsbury in company with Richard Peche, Archdeacon of\r\n  Malpas, in Cheshire, and a reverend dean whose name was “Deville,” was\r\n  told amongst other things, by the former, that his “jurisdiction was\r\n  so large as to reach from a place called Ill Street all along till\r\n  they came to Malpas, and took in a wide circumference of country.” To\r\n  which the infidel, being more witty than wise, immediately replied:\r\n  “Say you so, sir? God grant me then a good deliverance! For it seems I\r\n  am riding in a country where Sin (Péché) is the archdeacon, and the\r\n  Devil himself the dean; where the entrance into the archdeaconry is in\r\n  Ill Street, and the going from it Bad Steps (Malpas).”’ (_History of\r\n  Jews_, vol. iii. p. 232.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Hall, in his ‘Chronicles,’ speaks of the ‘Duke of Burgoyne.’ (F.\r\n  xxiiii.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  ‘Champaigne,’ of course, means simply _plain-land_, and is found\r\n  locally in various parts of Western Europe. I have included ‘Champion’\r\n  with the others because, though sometimes a combative sobriquet, it is\r\n  as often found to be the mediæval form of the local term, ‘Champian’\r\n  and ‘Champain’ being other modes of spelling the same to be met with\r\n  at this period. Thus we find such double entries as ‘Katerina le\r\n  Champion’ and ‘Roger de Champion.’ Our present Authorised Version uses\r\n  the word twice, as in Deut. xi. 30:—‘Are they not on the other side\r\n  Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the\r\n  Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside\r\n  the _plains_ of Moreh?’ In the various translations of this passage\r\n  almost all the above modes of spelling have been used.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ _Words and Places_, p. 436.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Camden says: ‘When Rollo had Normandy made over to him by Carolus\r\n  Stultus, with his daughter Gisla, he would not submit to kiss\r\n  Charles’s foot. And when his friends urged him by all means to kiss\r\n  the king’s foot, in gratitude for so great a favour, he made answer in\r\n  the English tongue, “Ne se, by God”—“Not so, by God”—upon which the\r\n  king and his courtiers, deriding him, and corruptly repeating his\r\n  answer, called him “Bigod,” from whence the Normans are to this day\r\n  termed “Bigodi.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Spaynard’ is found in the _Cal. Rot. Patentium_; but the name is\r\n  now obsolete, I imagine. ‘Peter Ispanier’ occurs in Clutterbuck’s\r\n  _Hertford_ (vol. i. Index).\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Hence we find Skelton speaking in one of his poems of ‘That gentyll\r\n  Jorge the Januay.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  Wicklyffe, in his preface to St. Paul’s Epistle to the ‘Romayns,’\r\n  quotes St. Jerome, and adds, ‘This saith Jerom in his prologe on this\r\n  pistle to Romaynes.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  ‘Turk,’ we must not forget, was a general term for anyone of the\r\n  Mahommedan faith. It still lingers in that sense in the _Jews, Turks,\r\n  Infidels, and Heretics_ of our Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Thus we find Bishop Coverdale, in his _Prologue to the New Testament_,\r\n  written 1535, saying, ‘And to help me herein I have had sundry\r\n  translations, not only in Latin, but also of the Dutch interpreters,\r\n  whom, because of their singular gifts and special diligence in the\r\n  Bible, I have been the more glad to follow.’ (_Park: Soc._ p. 12.)\r\n  Here he is manifestly speaking of the German reformers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Andrew Borde speaks of ‘Flaunders, Hanway, and Braban, which be\r\n  commodious and plentiful contreys.’—_Boke of the Introduction of\r\n  Knowledge._\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  An act passed in 1464 speaks of tonnage upon wines brought into\r\n  England ‘by eny Marchaunt Alien, as well by the Marchauntes of Hance\r\n  and of Almayn, as of eny other Marchauntes Alien.’ (Rot. Parl. Ed.\r\n  IV.) Bishop Coverdale’s exposition of the 22nd Psalm is entitled, ‘A\r\n  very excellent and swete exposition upon the two and twenty Psalme of\r\n  David, called in Latyn, “Dominus regit me, et nihil.” Translated out\r\n  of hye Almayne in to Englyshe by Myles Coverdale, 1537.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  The old form of ‘Dutch’ was ‘Douch’ or ‘Dowch.’ Skelton in his\r\n  ‘Parrot’ says that, besides French, Lattyn, Ebrew,\r\n\r\n              ‘With Douch, with Spanysh, my tong can agree.’\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Dowch’s’ and ‘Douch’s’ still preserve this spelling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Sarsons’ may be metronymically descended from ‘Sare’ or ‘Sarra.’\r\n  Skelton, in ‘Elynore Rummyng,’ speaks of\r\n\r\n                       ‘Dame Dorothe and lady Besse,\r\n                        Dame Sare, our pryoresse.’\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless the same writer, in his ‘Poem against Garnesche,’\r\n  addresses a Saracen thus—\r\n\r\n             ‘I say, ye solem Sarson, alle blake is your ble.’\r\n\r\n  Such entries as ‘William fil. Sare,’ ‘John Saresson,’ ‘Henry Sarrasin’\r\n  or ‘Peter Sarracen,’ show both origins to be possible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  This surname is found uncorrupted so late as 1626. A ‘John Jewry’ is\r\n  set down in C. C. Coll. register for that date. (_Vide Hist. C. C.\r\n  Coll._) ‘Jewsbury’ has the same origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  We must not forget, however, that the term ‘convert’ was applied to\r\n  such as were lay members of a monastery. They were also working\r\n  brethren, and thus were distinguished from the ‘monachi,’ or monks,\r\n  who were wholly confined to religious offices and meditation. Thus, in\r\n  the _Life of Hugh of Lincoln_, it is said, ‘Omnes interea Hugonem\r\n  loquebantur sive prior, sive monachus, sive _conversus_, gratiam\r\n  attolebat collatam Hugoni.’ (P. 46. See, also, Glossary to same.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  ‘Edward I. went so far as to give the Dominican Friars, at their\r\n  particular request, power to constrain the Jews to listen to their\r\n  preaching, and even proceeded to waive his claim for seven years to\r\n  more than a moiety of the goods of the converts, the other half being\r\n  given to maintain the poor in the Hospital for Converts.’ (_Anglia\r\n  Judaica_, p. 231.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  Hall, in his _Chronicles_, spells it ‘Bullein.’ (F, xxiii.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  So late as the year 1562 we find, in an old inventory, mention made of\r\n  ‘One bede coveringe of ariesworke, 8_s._ (_Richmondshire Wills_, p.\r\n  161.) ‘Grant to John Bakes, arras-maker, of the office of maker and\r\n  mender of the King’s cloths and pieces of arras and tapestry, with\r\n  12_d._ a day for wages.’—_Materials for History of Reign of Henry\r\n  VII._ (p. 259).\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  The _Gildhallæ Munimenta_ mention, among other goods, ‘mercerie,\r\n  canevas, conins-panes, fustiane, chalons, _draps du Reynes_, et draps\r\n  de soye.’ (P. 231.) ‘Then take a towell of reynes of two yerdes and an\r\n  halfe, and take the towell by ye endes double and laye it on the\r\n  table.’—_The Boke of Kervynge._\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Foxe, in his _Martyrology_, speaks of the ‘Bishop of Mentz, of Cullen,\r\n  and of Wormes.’ (Vol. i. p. 269, ed. 1844.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  The same remark will apply to our ‘Cardinals’ and ‘Pontifexs.’\r\n  ‘Cardinal’ is early found in ‘Walter Cardinall’ (P.), and ‘William\r\n  Cardynall’ (Z.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  In one of our old mediæval ‘mysteries,’ representing the Nativity, one\r\n  of the Magi says:—\r\n\r\n                 Certain Balaam speakys of this thyng,\r\n                 That of Jacob a star shall spryng,\r\n                 That shall overcom kasar and kyng.\r\n                                     —_Townley Mysteries._\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  Some of these forms may be but corruptions of ‘Casier,’ the old\r\n  cheese-maker, found in the Writs of Parliament in such entries as\r\n  ‘Michael le Casiere,’ or ‘Benedict le Casiere.’ ‘Cayser’ would require\r\n  little variation to make it such.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ellice Prynce’ (Z.), ‘John le Cunte’ (E.), ‘Peter le Counte’ (G.),\r\n  ‘John le Viscounte’ (B.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  ‘William le Duck’ (T.). Our ‘Ducks’ may thus be official rather than\r\n  ornithological.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  This word is found as a compound in ‘William Burtheyn,’ a Saxon title\r\n  equivalent to the Norman ‘Chamberlain.’ The Prompt. Par. has\r\n  ‘burmayden,’ _i.e._ ‘chamber-maid.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  In the Hundred Rolls we find a ‘Will Litleking.’ This sobriquet would\r\n  readily attach to one such feast-appointed monarch whose diminutive\r\n  stature would but impart additional merriment to the occasion. ‘Roger\r\n  Wyteking’ (_Testa de Neville_) would owe his _nom-de-plume_ to the\r\n  dress he wore. It is to such an institution as this, again, we must\r\n  ascribe the origin of such names as ‘Reginald Kyngessone,’ and\r\n  perchance ‘Richard Kyngesman,’ both found in the Hundred Rolls also.\r\n  That our ‘Kings’ are but a memorial of the festivities of our\r\n  forefathers, is an undoubted fact. Every great nobleman had not merely\r\n  a professed ‘fool,’ but at particular seasons a ‘King of Misrule.’\r\n  This ‘king’ initiated and conducted the merry doings of Christmastide,\r\n  and was a proper officer. Besides the ‘King of Misrule,’ there were\r\n  also the ‘King’ and ‘Queen’ of each village enthroned on May morning,\r\n  who would be sure to keep their regal title through the year at least.\r\n  Thus, among the twenty or thirty families that comprised the manor of\r\n  Ashton-under-Lyne in 1422, we find ‘Hobbe the King,’ while a festival\r\n  to be held there in that year is to be under the supervision of\r\n  ‘Margaret, widow of Hobbe the King, Hobbe Adamson, Jenkin of the Wood,\r\n  Robert Somayster (Sum-master), etc.’ (_Three Lancashire Documents._\r\n  Cheth.

Thus, in a statute of Edward III., dated 1341, it is\r\n  said:—‘Item, it is accorded and assented that the king and his heirs\r\n  shal have the conisance of the usurers dead, and that the Ordinaries\r\n  of Holy Church—_les Ordinares de Seinte Esglise_—have the conisance of\r\n  usurers in life, as to them appertaineth, to make compulsion by the\r\n  censures of Holy Church for the sin,’ &c. (_Stat. Realm_, vol. i. p.\r\n  296.) We still call the gaol chaplain the _ordinary_ who conducts the\r\n  condemned prisoner to the scaffold and reads the appointed service.\r\n  The Parliamentary Writs give us a ‘John Ordeiner’ and a ‘Stephen\r\n  Ordinar.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  The term ‘poll’ for the head, was far more familiar to our forefathers\r\n  than to ourselves, as such terms as ‘poll-tax,’ or ‘going to the\r\n  poll,’ testify. It was in great favour for nickname purposes, and\r\n  beside the one in the text gave rise to such sobriquets as\r\n  ‘ranti-poll,’ _i.e._, boisterous fellow; ‘doddy-poll,’ or\r\n  ‘doddy-poul,’ as Latimer spells it, _i.e._, blockhead; or\r\n  ‘withy-poll,’ _i.e._, spoiled one. The latter was a term of\r\n  endearment, and as such would not be resented. Hence it is found twice\r\n  as a surname:—‘Poule Withipoule, taillour’ (_Rutland Papers_, Cam.\r\n  Soc.); ‘Edmund Withipole’ (_State Papers, Domestic_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  An old sermon, written in the fourteenth century, upon Matt. xxiv. 43,\r\n  speaks of those whom we should now term as the ‘Devil and his angels’\r\n  as the ‘Devil and his kachereles.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  We have the surname of ‘Outlawe,’ or ‘Outlaghe,’ figuring in several\r\n  rolls, and that of ‘Felon,’ or ‘le Felun,’ in at least one. These\r\n  would be both unpleasant names to bear, perhaps more so then than now.\r\n  A ‘felon’ was one who had, by court adjudicature, and for some\r\n  specific crime, forfeited all his property, lands, or goods. An\r\n  ‘outlaw’ was one who had been cited to judgment for some misdemeanour,\r\n  and by refusing to make an appearance had put himself out of the\r\n  protection of the law. Thus, Robin Hood was an outlaw. ‘Adam Outelaw’\r\n  signs ordinances of Guild of St. John Baptist, West Lynn, 1374.\r\n  (_English Gilds_, p. 102.) This name, strange to say, lingered on to\r\n  within the last two hundred years, a ‘Thomas Outlaw’ being found in a\r\n  college register for 1674. (Vide _Hist. C. C. Coll. Cam._) In 1661,\r\n  too, ‘Ralph Outlaw’ was rector of Necton in Norfolk. (_Hist. Norf._,\r\n  vi. 55.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  ‘On the 30th ult., at Greenheys, Manchester, formerly of Oxton,\r\n  Cheshire, Sarah, widow of R. Bellringer, of Pendleton, aged 82.’\r\n  (_Manchester Courier_, May 2, 1874.) This is the only instance of this\r\n  name I have hitherto met with.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas le Await’ occurs in the _Rot. Curiæ Regis_. This reminds us\r\n  that our ‘waiter’ was once prefixed with ‘a’ likewise—‘xii. esquiers\r\n  awaiters.’ (_Ord. Household of Duke of Clarence_, 1493.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  ‘And to meyris or presidentis and to kyngis ye shall be led for me in\r\n  witnessyng to them.’—Matt x. 18 (Wicklyffe). In a Petition to\r\n  Parliament, dated 1461, the following varieties of spelling occur\r\n  within the space of thirty lines:—‘Maier,’ ‘Mayer,’ ‘Mayre,’and\r\n  ‘Maire.’ (_Rot. Parl._ Ed. IV.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  I suspect the difference between the ‘claviger’ and the ‘clavier’ lay\r\n  in that the former bore the key, and perhaps even the mace, in all the\r\n  many public processions and pageants of the day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:\r\n\r\n  The old and general custom of electing a boy-bishop on St. Nicholas’\r\n  Day gave their title, doubtless, to most of our ‘bishops.’ The\r\n  familiarity of the ceremony is fully attested by Brand. To him I refer\r\n  the reader. The boy thus elevated by his fellows could not but retain\r\n  the sobriquet. Lyson quotes from the _Lambeth Ch.wardens’ Accounts_,\r\n  1523: ‘For the Bishop’s dynner and hys company on St. Nycolas’ Day,\r\n  ii_s._ viii_d._’\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  Daniel Archdeacon was recommended to the King for his services, 1610.\r\n  (_State Papers_, 1623–5, p. 545.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  ‘Roger le Archeprest’ (J.). The term was in use in the seventeenth\r\n  century. Smith, the ‘silver-tongued’ preacher, speaks of ‘priest, or\r\n  priests, or archpriests, or any such like.’ (_God’s Arrow against\r\n  Atheists._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  As in occupative names, such as ‘Fisherman’ and ‘Poulterer,’ there was\r\n  a tendency to repeat the suffix, or to add ‘man’ to a term that itself\r\n  expressed a personal agent, so it was in official names. We have just\r\n  spoken of ‘Vickerman’ and ‘Priestman.’ ‘Symon Priorman’ (W. 15) and\r\n  ‘William Munkeman’ (W. 15) are other cases in point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  A curious, not to say cumbrous, surname is met with in the\r\n  Parliamentary Writs—that of ‘Holywaterclerk’—a certain ‘Hugh\r\n  Haliwaterclerk’ being set down as dwelling at Lincoln. Doubtless he\r\n  was connected with the cathedral body of that city. The name, I need\r\n  not say, is obsolete; and the Reformation has removed the office\r\n  denoted. A ‘Walter le Churcheclerk’ is found in the same record.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  The charge of the vestry seems to have been given also to the\r\n  ‘revetour,’ from ‘revestir.’ A ‘William Revetour, clericus, filius\r\n  Rogeri Morbet, revetour,’ was admitted to freedom of York City in\r\n  1420. He died in 1446, and in his will makes mention of his father as\r\n  ‘Roger Revetour.’ (_Corpus Christi Guild_, p. 24. Surt.

This would\r\n  be a general term for one who dwelt in a monastic institution.\r\n  Shakespeare uses the feminine ‘cloistress.’ Of a similar character\r\n  would be ‘Nicholas Brotherhood’ (Nicholls’ _Leicester_, 1633), ‘John\r\n  Brotherhood’ (W. 20), or ‘William Felliship’ (W. 11).\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  In the _Monastical Church of Durham_, written in 1593, we are told of\r\n  the ‘Cellarer’ that ‘the chambre where he dyd lye was in the dorter.’\r\n  (P. 83.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Hence the local surname ‘Spital’ or ‘Spittle:’ ‘Richard ate Spitale,’\r\n  M. ‘Gilbert de Hospitall,’ A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Amners’ are but a corruption of this same name. The word had\r\n  become early so corrupted—‘For in tymes paste kynges have geven theyr\r\n  bysshoprycks to theyr councellers, chaplaynes ... or to suche which\r\n  have taken paynes in theyr householde, as amners, and deans of the\r\n  chappell,’ &c. (_A Supplycacion to our moste Soveraigne Lorde Kynge\r\n  Henry the Eyght_, p. 34.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  It was thus in the case of Simon the Leper of Bethany. The fact of\r\n  there being a feast in his house shows that he had been cured of his\r\n  disorder. None the less, however, did the surname cling to him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  ‘Go ye and tell agen to Jon those things that ye have herd and seen.\r\n  Blind men seen, crokide goen, mesels ben maad clene, defe men heren,’\r\n  &c. (Matt. xi., Wicklyffe.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  Pilgrims to Rome were ‘Romers;’ whence such an entry as ‘Cristiana la\r\n  Romere’ (H.R.) Piers Plowman in ‘Passus IV.’ speaks, within eight\r\n  lines, of ‘religious romares’ and ‘Rome-runners.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  Capgrave, under date 1293, says: ‘In the xxii. yere was Celestius the\r\n  Fifte, Pope, take fro’ his hous, for he was a ankir.’ This Celestius\r\n  at once passed a law that a Pope might resign, and instantly gave it\r\n  up, returning to his old life again.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  The Hundred Rolls contain ‘Geoffrey Halve Knit’ and ‘Nicholas Halve\r\n  Knycht.’ They would seem to have arrived at some half stage toward\r\n  chivalric rank.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Swyan, in _Morte Arthure_, slays Child-Chatelain, and\r\n\r\n         ‘The swyers swyre-bane (neck-bone) he swappes in sondre.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  An ordinance of Edward III. declares that ‘men of arms, hoblers’ and\r\n  archers (gentz darmes, hobelers et archers) chosen to go in the king’s\r\n  service out of England, shall be at the king’s wages from the day that\r\n  they depart out of the counties where they were chosen, till their\r\n  return.’ (_Stat. Realm_, vol. i. p. 301.) Of the hobby itself, too, we\r\n  have mention. Thus a list of the royal stud at Eltham, in the\r\n  seventeenth year of Henry VIII., includes ‘coursers, 30; young horses,\r\n  8; barbary horses, 4; stallions, 8; hobbyes and geldings, 12.’\r\n  (_Collection of Ordinances_, p. 200.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  In the _Life of Hugh of Lincoln_ mention is made of ‘Marchadeus\r\n  princeps Rutariorum’ (p. 264). See the glossary, however, from which I\r\n  have derived much of the above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  In the _Morte Arthure_ mention is made of a youth named ‘Chastelayne,\r\n  a chylde of the Kynges chambyre.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  Such names as ‘Alice Suckling’ (ff.), or ‘William Firstling,’\r\n  (ditto)—both terms familiarised to us by the Authorised\r\n  Version—belong, seemingly, to the same class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  Among other duties the usher lay at the door of his lord’s sleeping\r\n  apartment. The _Boke of Curtasye_ says the\r\n\r\n                             ‘Usher before the dore\r\n                   In outer chambur lies on the flore.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  Our friends across the border have this surname in the form of\r\n  ‘Chalmers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  The more correct form is found in the name of ‘William Summaster,’ who\r\n  is met with in an old Oxford record as having deposited, in 1462, a\r\n  caution for ‘Sykyll-Halle,’ of which he was principal. (Vide _Mun.\r\n  Acad. Oxon._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  A strange and yet most natural change gradually crept over this word.\r\n  There can be no doubt that the original ‘potager,’ or ‘potinger,’ had\r\n  his place in the baronial household as the superintendent of the\r\n  mess-making department. From his knowledge of herbs thus acquired he\r\n  evidently came to be looked upon in a medicinal capacity. Thus the\r\n  term came to be used synonymously with ‘apothecary.’ In the\r\n  _Archæologia_ (vol. xxii) we find it recorded that one of the horses\r\n  connected with the household of James V. of Scotland was called ‘le\r\n  Pottinger’—‘uno equo pharmacopile, vulgo le Pottinger.’ In an old\r\n  university record, dated 1439, I find, too, a certain ‘Ralph\r\n  Prestbury’ mentioned as sworn to keep the peace towards ‘Thomam Halle,\r\n  potygare, alias chirurgicum.’ (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._, p. 523.) Probably,\r\n  however, it was the lowly herbalist, rather than the professional\r\n  druggist, who acquired the sobriquet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  Amongst other gifts from the City of London to the Black Prince on his\r\n  return to London from Gascoigne, in 1371, were ‘48 _esqueles_ and 24\r\n  saltcellars, weighing by goldsmiths’ weight, 76_l._ 5_s._’ (Riley’s\r\n  _London_, p. 350.) ‘The 11 messes to the children of the Kechyn,\r\n  _Squillery_, and Pastrey, with Porters, Scowerers, and Turnbroches,\r\n  every mess at 23_l._ 16_s._ 9½_d._, in all 261_l._ 13_s._ 7_d._’ (Ord.\r\n  Henry VIII. at Eltham.) Apart from such entries as ‘John le Squylier,’\r\n  or ‘Geoffrey le Squeller,’ the Parl. Rolls gave us a ‘John de la\r\n  Squillerye.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  I may here mention that our brushes were almost entirely made of furze\r\n  or ling; bristles were rarely used. Hence such a name as ‘Robert le\r\n  Lingyure’ (H.R.), doubtless a maker and seller of brushes and brooms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  The ‘Promp. Par.’ has ‘Swyllare: Dysche-weschour.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  In an inventory of household chattels, dated so late as 1574, we find\r\n  the furniture of the hall first described, and this begins, ‘A\r\n  cupboard and a _spence_, 20_s._; xxiii pewter dublers, 20_s._;\r\n  seventene sawsers and potingers, 6_s._’ (_Richmondshire Wills_, p.\r\n  248.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Sewer muste speke with the panter and offycers of ye spycery for\r\n  fruytes that shall be eten fastynge.’—_The Boke of Kervynge._\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  A manciple was an achatour for a more public institution, such as an\r\n  Inn of Court or College. It is quite possible that our ‘Mansels’ and\r\n  ‘Maunsels’ are thus derived, relics as they undoubtedly are of the ‘le\r\n  Maunsels’ or ‘le Mansells’ of this period. The corruption colloquially\r\n  of ‘manciple’ into ‘maunsell’ would be a perfectly natural one. An\r\n  instance of the purer form is found in the name of ‘Thomas Mancipill,’\r\n  met with in _Munimenta Academica_ (Oxon.) p. 525, under the date 1441.\r\n  That this was a common term at that university we may prove from an\r\n  indenture found in the same book, dated 1459, in which are mentioned\r\n  ‘catours, manciples, spencers, cokes, lavenders, &c.’ (P. 346.) It may\r\n  be interesting to some to state that to this day this is the term for\r\n  the chief cook in several of the colleges.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  A ‘William Celarer’ is mentioned in the Churchwardens’ Accounts of\r\n  Horley, Surrey, 1526. (_Brand._ vol. i. 226.) A Saxon form of this\r\n  existed in the term, ‘Hoarder,’ _i.e._ one who stored up. ‘Richard le\r\n  Hordere’ (H.R.), ‘Adam le Horder’ (Parl. Writs). The form ‘hordestre,’\r\n  or cellaress, is met with in contemporaneous writings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  The duties of Butler and Panter being so all-important, they are often\r\n  found encroaching on one another’s vocation. Thus the _Boke of\r\n  Curtasye_ says:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘Botler schalle sett for each a messe,\r\n                   A pot, a lofe, withouten distress.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  This was evidently in existence as a surname formerly, although I have\r\n  only been able to discover one instance of it. The Principal of Bedel\r\n  Hall, one of the numerous smaller establishments at Oxford in mediæval\r\n  times, was in the year 1462 a certain Dr. Schalke. (_Mun. Acad.\r\n  Oxon._) It is very likely that our present ‘Chalk’ represents this\r\n  name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  ‘The sewer must serve, and from the borde convey all manner of\r\n  potages, metes, and sauces.’—_The Boke of Kervynge._\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  We still use the compounds of this, as in ‘pursue,’ ‘ensue,’ or\r\n  ‘issue;’ but we scarcely now employ the simple root-word so freely as\r\n  it evidently was employed in Wicklyffe’s time. He translates Mark ii.\r\n  14 as follows: ‘And whaune he passide he saygh Levy of Alfey sittynge\r\n  at the tolbothe and he seide to hym, sue me, and he roos and suede\r\n  him.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item: A Duke’s eldest sonn is borne a Marquisse, and shall goe as a\r\n  Marquisse, and have his Assayes, the Marquisse being present.’ (_A\r\n  Book of Precedence._) Hall, speaking of King Richard’s murder, says of\r\n  Sir Piers that he ‘came to Pomfret, commanding that the esquier whiche\r\n  was accustomed to sewe and take the assaye before Kyng Rychard should\r\n  no more use that maner of service.’ F. xiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  Forks, used first in Italy, were not introduced into the French Court\r\n  till late in the sixteenth century. In England they did not make their\r\n  appearance till 1608, and it is said they were there the immediate\r\n  result of the published travels of Thomas Coryat, who visited Italy in\r\n  that year. I am sorry to say that I cannot find any instance of\r\n  ‘Spooner’ in our earlier archives. Foxe mentions, in his\r\n  _Martyrology_, a ‘Robert Catlin, spoonmaker,’ persecuted in 1552 at\r\n  Byebrook, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  ‘To Percivall Smallpage, for his expences, xx_s._’ (_Household\r\n  Account, Princess Elizabeth._ Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  We find the modern spelling of this sobriquet little varied from that\r\n  of the fifteenth century. An act, passed in 1463, to restrain excess\r\n  in apparel, makes a proviso in favour of ‘Hensmen, Heroldes,\r\n  Purceyvantes, Swerdeberers, as Maires, Messagers, and Minstrelles.’\r\n  (_Stat. Realm_, vol. ii. p. 402.) Sir Harris Nicolas says: ‘No word\r\n  has been more commented upon than “Henchmen,” or “Henxmen.” Without\r\n  entering into the controversy, it may be sufficient to state that in\r\n  the reign of Henry VIII. it meant pages of honour. They were the sons\r\n  of gentlemen, and in public processions always walked near the\r\n  monarch’s horse.’ (_Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII._, p. 327.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  Words terminating in this ‘ager’ seem invariably to have been changed\r\n  in the manner seen above. Thus, besides ‘Massinger’ and ‘Pottinger,’\r\n  we have ‘Arminger’ from the old ‘Armiger,’ ‘Firminger’ from the once\r\n  not unfamiliar ‘Furmager,’ or ‘Clavinger’ from ‘Claviger.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  This is confirmed by the _Promp. Par._ ‘Brevetowre: brevigerulus.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  Perhaps I ought to have placed ‘le Breviter’ in the dining-hall, as\r\n  but another name for the steward or steward’s lieutenant. It was one\r\n  among other duties of this officer to set down not merely the courses\r\n  as they came in, but what and how much was placed before each, so that\r\n  all might tally with the sum allowed for culinary expenses. This is\r\n  alluded to in the _Boke of Curtasye_. Speaking of the steward’s\r\n  offices in the hall, it says:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘At counting stuard schalle ben,\r\n                   Tyll alle be _brevet_ of wax so grene,\r\n                   Wrytten into bokes, without let,\r\n                   That before in tabuls hase been set.’\r\n\r\n  Further on, too, it adds—\r\n\r\n          ‘The clerke of the kitchen shalle alle thyngs _breve_.’\r\n\r\n  The name itself lingered on uncorrupted for some time; for as simple\r\n  ‘Breviter’ it is found in 1580 in a Cambridge University list. (_Hist.\r\n  C. C. Coll. Cam._) The corrupted ‘Bretter’ still exists, and is met\r\n  with in ‘William Bretter,’ a name entered in the _Calendar to\r\n  Pleadings_ of Elizabeth’s reign.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  ‘To John Redyng, avener, for the expenses of le palfrais, 50_l._’\r\n  _Materials for Hist. of Reign of Henry VII._, p. 407.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item: It is ordeyned that the King’s Avenor, with the two clerkes of\r\n  the said office, doe give their dayly attendance, as well as for the\r\n  check roll, as all other concerning provisions to be made for the\r\n  king’s stable, according to the statutes made and ordeyned for the\r\n  same.’ (Extract from _Ordinances of Henry VIII. at Eltham_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  The _Liber Albus_, among other entries, has the following: ‘Qe nul\r\n  teigne Escole de Eskermerye, ne de Bokeler deins la citee.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  The old Norman word was either ‘healme’ or ‘heaume.’ The more ordinary\r\n  term for the former now is ‘helmet.’ Hall, writing of the Battle of\r\n  Bosworth Field, after mentioning the fact of the armies coming in\r\n  sight the one of the other, says: ‘Lord, how hasteley the souldyoures\r\n  buckled their healmes, how quickly the archers bent their bowes and\r\n  frushed their feathers, how redely the bilmen shoke their billes and\r\n  proved their staves.’ (Hall, _Richard III._, fol. 32 b.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  It is thought by several writers that the ‘Sworder’ was one who\r\n  performed feats of jugglery, the sword, after the fashion of the\r\n  times, forming the most important feature in his art, his hairbreadth\r\n  tricks being especially popular with the country people. It is quite\r\n  possible this may be its real origin. The only early instances I find\r\n  of the name are in the Parliamentary Writs and the Parliamentary\r\n  Rolls, where are recorded respectively a ‘John le Serdere’ and a\r\n  ‘Henry Swerder.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  In Mr. Riley’s interesting _Memorials of London_ there is recorded not\r\n  merely a ‘Richard le Kissere,’ but the occupation itself is clearly\r\n  marked in the entry, ‘Walter de Bedefont, kissere.’ (P. xxii.) There\r\n  need be no hesitation in accepting the statement that the ‘kisser’ was\r\n  thus occupied. It is merely spelt according to the then pronunciation.\r\n  In the _Statutes of Arms_ it is said: ‘And no son of a great lord,\r\n  that is to say, of an earl or baron, shall have other armour than\r\n  mufflers and cuishes (“ne seit arme fors de mustilers e de quisers”).’\r\n  (_Stat. of Realm_, vol. i. p. 231.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  The obsolete ‘Bucklermaker’ must be set here. Our Authorized Version\r\n  has made us familiar with ‘sword and buckler.’ ‘Item: Payd to Phillip\r\n  Tynker and Mathou Bucler-maker, for drawyenge of the yron and makynge\r\n  of the stapuls, ii_s._’ (_Ludlow Churchwardens’ Accounts_, Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  We find the Pattenmakers of London petitioning the Commons, in 1464,\r\n  that they may have restored to them the use of the ‘tymber called\r\n  Aspe,’ which had been of late entirely in the hands of the\r\n  manufacturers of arrows, ‘so that the Flecchers thorough the Reame may\r\n  sell their arrowes at more esy price than they were wonte to doo.’ The\r\n  aspe was a species of poplar.—Rol. Parl. Ed. IV.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  The ‘arrowsmith’ has a much longer and less euphonious title in a\r\n  statute of Elizabeth regarding the hiring of servants by the year. In\r\n  it are included ‘Weavers, Tuckers, Fullers, Pewterers, Cutlers,\r\n  Smithes, Farrours, Sadlers, Spurryers, Turners, Bowyers, Fletchers,\r\n  _Arrowhead-makers_, Butchers, Cookes, or Myllers.’—5 Eliz. c. iv. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  Thus, among the London occupations, Cocke Lovell includes those of the\r\n\r\n               ‘Spooners, turners, and hatters,\r\n                Lyne-webbers, _setters_, and lyne-drapers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  Since writing this, I have discovered the names of ‘John Fusilier’ and\r\n  ‘—— Fuzelier.’ (See _Proc. and Ord. Privy Council_, under dates 1437\r\n  and 1439.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  We have a similar interchange of these two initial letters in the\r\n  cases of ‘Gervais’ and ‘Jervis,’ ‘Geoffrey’ and ‘Jeffrey,’ and ‘Gill’\r\n  and ‘Jill.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomasine Woodkeeper’ is set down in the Index to _State Papers\r\n  (Domestic)_ for 1635. This is a name, I doubt not, of later origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  The stringent care taken of the beasts of chase may be gathered from\r\n  the various laws passed regarding the dogs of such swineherds, &c., as\r\n  had right of entry in the woods. The chief one related to what was\r\n  called the lawing of dogs. By this rule the three claws of the\r\n  forefoot of every mastiff were to be cut off by the skin, and the\r\n  forest assize was to make special inquisition to see that it was in\r\n  all cases done. (See _Stat. de Finibus_, 27 Edward I.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  ‘He seide also to hise discipilis, ther was a riche man that hadde a\r\n  baylyf, and this was defamed to him as he hadde wastid hise goodis.\r\n  And he clepide him and seyde to him, what here I this thing of thee?\r\n  Yelde rekenyng of thi Baylye, for thou myght not now be baylyf.’ (Luke\r\n  xvi. 1, 2—Wicklyffe.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  The first instance I have met with of this name is in a formal\r\n  declaration against Popish doctrine, dated 1534, and signed among\r\n  others by ‘Gulielmus Buckmaster.’ (Foxe’s _Martyrology_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  The Hundred Rolls have the abbreviated form in ‘Godfrey le Futur.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Not very long previously to this we find Trevisa writing: ‘There are\r\n  many harts, and wild beasts, and few wolves, therefore sheep are the\r\n  more sykerlyche’ (secure). Thus we have ample evidence, apart from the\r\n  existence of the name, that this depredator of the farming stock was\r\n  anything but unknown during mediæval times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:\r\n\r\n  Of course the breeding of falcons was a favourite as well as important\r\n  care. By a special statute of Edward I.’s reign, every freeman could\r\n  have in his own wood ‘ayries of hawks, sparrowhawks, faulcons, eagles,\r\n  and herons.’ (25 Edward I. c. 13.) By a statute passed in the reign of\r\n  Edward III., anyone who found a strayed hawk or tercelet was to bring\r\n  it to the sheriff of the county, through whom proclamation to that\r\n  effect was to be made in the towns. If the finder concealed the bird,\r\n  he was rendered liable to two years’ imprisonment. (34 Ed. III. c.\r\n  22.) This will give some idea of the value attached to a good falcon\r\n  in those days.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  This form of spelling is used by Burton in his _Anatomy_. He asks, how\r\n  would Democritus have been affected ‘to see a scholar crouch and creep\r\n  to an illiterate peasant for a meal’s meat, a scrivener better paid\r\n  for an obligation, a faulkner receive greater wages than a student?’\r\n  (P. 37.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:\r\n\r\n  Juliana Berners says: ‘Ye shall understonde that they ben called\r\n  Ostregeres that kepe goshawkes or tercelles.’ (Ed. 1496, b. iii.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thacker’ represented the northern pronunciation, ‘Thatcher’ the\r\n  south. Compare ‘kirk’ and ‘church,’ ‘poke’ and ‘pouch,’ ‘dike’ and\r\n  ‘ditch,’ or the surnames ‘Fisk’ and ‘Fish.’ A ‘Nathaniel Thackman’ is\r\n  set down in the index to _State Papers (Domestic)_ for 1635.\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  A ‘John Thaxter’ is met with in a college register for 1567 (_Hist. C.\r\n  C. Coll. Cam._), and far earlier than this, in the Parliamentary\r\n  Writs, we light upon a ‘Thomas Thackstere.’ This is one more instance\r\n  of the feminine termination. That the word itself was in familiar use\r\n  is proved by the fact that in the ordinance arranging the Norwich\r\n  Trades Procession we find among others the ‘Thaxteres’ marching in\r\n  company with the ‘Rederes.’ (_Hist. Norfolk_, vol. iii.) As a surname\r\n  the term still survives.\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robertus Brown, redere,’ Guild of St. George, Norwich.\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  ‘Also, that no tylers called hillyers of the cite compelle, ne charge\r\n  ne make no tyler straunger to serve at his rule and assignment,\r\n  etc.’—_The Ordinances of Worcester, English Guilds_, 398.\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  According to Walsingham, Wat the rebel was ‘Walterus helier, vel\r\n  tyler.’ The word is prettily used in an old Saxon Psalter, where, in\r\n  the stead of our present ‘He is a buckler to all those that trust in\r\n  Him,’ we read that a\r\n\r\n                              ‘Forhiler is He\r\n                      Of all that in Him hoping be.’\r\n\r\n  The following quotations from Wicklyffe’s New Testament will prove how\r\n  familiar was the term in his day: ‘And lo a greet stiryng was made in\r\n  the see so that the schip was hilid with wavis’ (Matt. viii. 24); ‘For\r\n  I hungride and ye gaven me to ete, I thirstide and ye gaven me to\r\n  drynke, I was herbarweles and ye herboriden me, naked and ye hiliden\r\n  me’ (Matt. xxv. 35); ‘No man lightnith a lanterne, and hilith it with\r\n  a vessel, or putteth it under a bed’ (Luke viii. 16).\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  Among other items of an entry in the Issues of the Exchequer we find\r\n  for ‘putting the shingles on the king’s kitchen, for the aforesaid\r\n  week, 17_s._ 4_d._’ (43 Hen. III.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  We find all these various forms of the same occupation mentioned in a\r\n  statute of Elizabeth relating to the apprenticeship of children. In it\r\n  are included ‘Lymeburner, Brickmaker, Bricklayer, Tyler, Slater,\r\n  Healyer, Tilemaker ... Thatcher or Shingler.’ (5 Eliz. c. 4, 23.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Hugh Marbeler was sheriff of London in 1424.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Another Saxon name, that of ‘John le Sclabbere,’ is met with in the\r\n  Parliamentary Writs. It is, however, but an isolated instance, and I\r\n  do not suppose there was any particular craft in masonry that went by\r\n  that title.\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item: Payd to a laborer for to pargytt, vii_d._ (P. 4,\r\n  _Churchwardens’ Accounts, Ludlow_, Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  Thus, our ‘Freebodys’ are found alike in this guise, and in that of\r\n  ‘Frybody.’ ‘Robert Frybody’ is set down in _Proc. and Ord. Privy\r\n  Council_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  A curiously contradictory name is met with in ‘Robert Frebond,’ found\r\n  in the Hundred Rolls. The same roll contains the names of ‘Roger le\r\n  Neubonde’ and ‘Emma Newbonde.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  Among the peasantry of Yorkshire the simple farm labourer is still a\r\n  ‘hine’ or ‘hind.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  A ‘Cropper’ was a farm labourer who superintended the growth and\r\n  cutting of the _crops_. In the Custom Roll of the Manor of\r\n  Ashton-under-Lyne (Ch. Soc.) occurs the following:—‘Roger the Cropper,\r\n  for his tenement, and whole service, the present 8_d._; the farm,\r\n  15_s._’ &c. Lower down mention is made also of ‘Robin the Cropper.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  ‘Digger’ also exists, and is found in an epitaph in St. Sepulchre’s,\r\n  Middlesex.\r\n\r\n            ‘Here lyes Robert Diggs and William Digger,\r\n             There’s no living soule knew which was the bigger,\r\n             They fared well and lived easy,\r\n             And now they’re both dead, an ’t shall please ye.’\r\n\r\n            _Dingley’s History from Marble (Cam. Soc.)._\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  Chappell’s Ballad Music, vol. i. 327.\r\n\r\nFootnote 251:\r\n\r\n  Thus we find in the forest charter of Edward III.: ‘Unus quisque liber\r\n  homo faciat in bosco suo vel in terra sua, quam habet in foresta\r\n  marleram (marl-pit), fossatum, vel terram arabile,’ &c. (_Stat. of\r\n  Realm_, vol. i. p. 121.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  As there was the ‘Miller’ and the ‘Milward,’ so there was the ‘Marler’\r\n  and the ‘Marlward:’ ‘Alice le Marlere’ (H.R.), ‘John Marleward’\r\n  (H.R.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  ‘He shall be called ... a lamb of Christ’s fold, a sheep of his\r\n  pasture, a branch of his vine, a member of his Church, an imp of his\r\n  kingdom.’—Bishop Bale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  ‘Peachman’ must be set here. ‘Daniel Peachman’ occurs in Blomefield’s\r\n  _Norfolk_ (Index).\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  Thus it is expressly stated in the _Forest Charter_, as of importance\r\n  to the holder, that every freeman should have a right to the honey\r\n  found within his woodland: ‘Habeat similiter mel quod inventum fuerit\r\n  in boscis suis.’ (_Stat. Realm_, vol. i. p. 121.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hewer’ often occurs in composition, as in ‘Robert le Wodehyewere,’\r\n  ‘Richard Stonhewer,’ ‘Richard le Blockhewere,’ or ‘William\r\n  Flesschewer.’ This last may be but a corruption of ‘Flesher.’ After\r\n  the prevailing fashion of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the\r\n  termination ‘ster’ was sometimes added instead of ‘er.’ Thus, in the\r\n  Chester Play we find the procession joined by the ‘Hewsters.’ Richard\r\n  le Hewster was sheriff in 1382. (Ormerod’s _Cheshire_, vol. i. 302.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  The ashburner is incidentally alluded to in a statute of Elizabeth’s\r\n  reign, in which, among other occupations, is mentioned the ‘Burner of\r\n  Oore and woad ashes.’—5 Eliz. c. 4, 23.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  This spelling lasted till the seventeenth century. Henry Best, in his\r\n  _Farming Book_, 1641, says: ‘The noutheard wages were, for every\r\n  beast, 2_d._’ (P. 119, Sur. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  ‘Adam le Roc’ (H.R.), represented by our modern ‘Rooks,’ reminds us of\r\n  the older form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  It will give the reader some idea of the importance of this root-word\r\n  when I say that these five names appear in a list of thirty-one\r\n  persons dwelling in the village of Aynwyk. (Surtees Soc. _Hexham\r\n  Priory_, vol. ii. p. 4.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  In an old book of tenures kept in York Castle occurs, or did occur,\r\n  the following: ‘David le Lardiner holds one Serjeantry, and he is\r\n  Keeper of the Gaol of the Forest, and Seizer of the Cattle which are\r\n  taken for the king’s debts.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  Nicolas Goteman (W. ii.) occurs in an old Yorkshire register, but the\r\n  name is now obsolete, I think.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  In a statute of Edward III.’s reign, dated 1363, in defining the\r\n  attire suitable for those whose chattels came under 40_s._ value, we\r\n  find enumerated with others, ‘tenders of oxen, cow-herds, shepherds,\r\n  swineherds, deyes, and all other keepers of live-stock’ (‘bovus,\r\n  vachers, berchers, porchers, deyes, et tous autres gardeinz des\r\n  bestes’). (Vide _Prom. Par._, p. 116.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Wyndmilward’ occurs in the _Cal. Rot. Chartarum_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  ‘Manumissio Thomæ Haale, alias dicti Mylleward de Hextone,’ 1480 (xx.\r\n  2, p. 210). ‘Milmaster’ is also found. ‘Mr. Andrew Milmaster, of the\r\n  Old Jewry, died Aug. 23, 1630.’ (Smith’s _Obituary_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  We may here mention several surnames whose original possessors were\r\n  evidently confrères of the miller. ‘John le Melmongere’ (M.), _i.e._,\r\n  mealmonger; ‘Denis le Otemonger’ (X.), ‘Walter le Heymongere’ (G.),\r\n  ‘Ralph le Cornmonger’ (T.), and ‘Henry le Cornmongere’ (M.). These are\r\n  all obsolete, I fear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  ‘Adam Taskermale’ (H.R.). This would be a sobriquet taken from the\r\n  ‘male,’ or bag in which the tasker carried his day’s provision.\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  In the _Ordinances of the Household of Henry VI._, dated 1455, we find\r\n  the ‘Bakhous’ (bakehouse) to be under thirteen officers, and of them\r\n  are ‘6 Gromes Bulters.’ (_Pro. Ord. Privy Council_, vol. vi. 226.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robert le Whelere,’ G., ‘Walter Welwryghte,’ A., ‘Robert le\r\n  Wainwright,’ H., ‘Robert le Cartwright,’ B., ‘Hugh le Schipwryte,’ A.,\r\n  ‘John Botewright,’ F.F.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  So late as 1541 we have such an entry as this: ‘Item, to John Glassier\r\n  for mendynge the wyndowe over the gallery, v_s._ viii_d._’\r\n  (_Churchwardens’ Accounts, Ludlow_, p. 8, Cam. Soc.) A little later we\r\n  find: ‘Item, to John Pavier for his labour, iii_d._ Item, for pavinge\r\n  before the gate, i_d._’ (P. 10, do.) These are both interesting\r\n  instances of the late formation of surnames. Both evidently took their\r\n  second sobriquets from their occupation. ‘Pavier,’ I need hardly say,\r\n  still exists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above I find my latter conjecture to be confirmed.\r\n  Miss Meteyard, in her interesting life of Josiah Wedgwood, says: ‘The\r\n  surname of ‘Tellwright,’ or ‘Tilewright,’ which, variously spelt,\r\n  fills a considerable portion of the parish register of Burslem down to\r\n  a late period of the eighteenth century, and is still common, is\r\n  curious evidence of the antiquity of the tilewright’s craft in this\r\n  locality.... Every worker in its clays became a tilewright, whether he\r\n  moulded tiles or formed the homely pipkin or porringer, the slab-like\r\n  dish or ale-vat for the hall.’ (Vol. i. p. 93.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  In an inventory of household furniture, dated 1559, we have amongst\r\n  other articles, ‘One trussin bed with a teaster of yealow and chamlet,\r\n  one old arke, old hangyers of wull grene and red, 6_s._ 8_d._’\r\n  (_Richmondshire Wills_, p. 135.) Another writer, twenty years earlier,\r\n  relating the contents of the ‘mylke howse,’ includes ‘an arke, a tube\r\n  (tub), a stande, a chyrne.’ (P. 42, do.) The earliest instance of the\r\n  surname I have yet met with is found in the same book, where, in a\r\n  will dated 1556, the testator bequeaths a sheep to ‘Henry Arkwright.’\r\n  (Do. p. 155, note.) Both the ark itself and the trade are of North\r\n  English origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 273:\r\n\r\n  ‘Shuxsmith’ seems but a corruption of this. The intermediate form is\r\n  found in _Wills and Inventories_ (Ch. Soc.), in the names of ‘Margerie\r\n  Shughsmythe’ and ‘Henry Shughsmythe.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  ‘Buckler’ may be mentioned here. ‘John le Bockeler’ (A.), ‘Richard\r\n  Bokeler’ (Z).\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  With our ‘Locksmiths’ we must, of course, ally our ‘Lockmans,’\r\n  ‘Lockyers,’ and ‘Lockers,’ and perchance ‘Lookers.’ We find a ‘Henry\r\n  le Lokier’ set down in the Hundred Rolls, and in an old Oxford record,\r\n  dated 1443, there occurs the name of ‘Robert Harward, loker,’ who\r\n  doubtless found plenty of employment in providing for the security of\r\n  the various rooms attached to the different colleges and halls. (_Mun.\r\n  Acad. Oxon._, p. 535.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  There are several single representatives of occupations connected with\r\n  the smith which I have not mentioned in the text, not having met with\r\n  any trace of their continued existence amongst us. Thus, in the\r\n  _London Memorials_ we find a ‘John Chietesmyth,’ which, so far, I have\r\n  found to be wholly unintelligible. I must say the same in regard to\r\n  ‘Cokesmyth,’ occurring in the _Boldon Book_. ‘John Rodesmith,’ if not\r\n  a scribe’s error for ‘Redesmith,’ would be the manufacturer of the\r\n  then familiar ‘rood’ or ‘rode,’ the cross which we occasionally may\r\n  see still standing beside our old turnpikes. ‘William Watersmith,’ it\r\n  is quite reasonable, may have spent his energies on water-wheels and\r\n  such other machinery as helped to turn the mill. All these are now,\r\n  and probably were then, almost immediately obsolete. On the other\r\n  hand, we have ‘Wildsmith’ existing in our midst, only one\r\n  representative of which am I able to discover in our olden records. It\r\n  is just possible that, like the obsolete ‘Youngsmith,’ it originally\r\n  referred to the characteristics of the man as well as of his trade.\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  The roads between Cumberland and Northumberland were of the roughest\r\n  and most dangerous character till the seventeenth century, when\r\n  General Wade, in the course of his progress against the rebels, laid\r\n  down some of a better kind. The following couplet has been handed down\r\n  as the effort of some local poet:—\r\n\r\n                     ‘If you’d ever been here\r\n                      When these roads were not made,\r\n                      You would lift up your hands\r\n                      And bless General Wade.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  In the Rolls of Parliament special mention is made of the King’s\r\n  Corser, he who acted as the king’s agent in regard to the purchase of\r\n  horses. A certain ‘Johannes Martyr, corsere,’ occurs in an old Oxford\r\n  record, dated 1451. (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._, p. 616.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  Thus, in the _Itinerarium of Richard I._, it is said that, after a\r\n  conflict with the Greeks, ‘Rex igitur cum persecutus esset imperatorem\r\n  fugientem lucratus est runcinum vel jumentum sacculo retro sellam\r\n  collocato,’ &c.—P. 191. We may quote, also, the _Wardrobe of Edward\r\n  I._: ‘Magistro Willelmo de Apperle, pro restauro unius runcini favi\r\n  appreciati pro Roberto de Burton, valletto suo, &c., 8_l._’—P. 172.\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  The _Test. Ebor._ (W. 2) gives us a ‘John Charioteer,’ and the _Cal.\r\n  Proc. Chancery_ (Z.Z.) a ‘Thomas Charietter.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  This is confirmed by the existence of ‘Chartman,’ more modernly\r\n  ‘Cartman.’ A ‘John Chartman’ was rector of Sedistern, Norfolk, in\r\n  1361. (Blomefield.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  The following entry is found in the _Issue Rolls_: ‘To Master William\r\n  la Zousche, clerk of the king’s great wardrobe in money, paid to him\r\n  by the hands of John le Charer, for making a certain chariot for the\r\n  use and behoof of Lady Eleanor, the king’s sister, by writ of liberate\r\n  containing 1000_l._’ (_Issues of the Exchequer_, 6 Ed. III.) Capgrave,\r\n  too, may be cited. Writing of Helianore, daughter to the King of\r\n  France, when given to Richard of England, he says, under date 1394:\r\n  ‘She was ful scarsly viii yere of age, but she brought oute of Frauns\r\n  xii chares ful of ladies and domicelles.’ Mr. Way says that in 1294\r\n  the use of this vehicle by the wives of wealthy citizens in Paris had\r\n  become so prevalent that it was forbidden them by an ordinance of\r\n  Philippe le Bel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  ‘Couchman’ and ‘Coachman’ must be set here. ‘Aug. 4, 1640. Dorothy\r\n  Coachman, daughter of Tilney Coachman, buried’ (Smith’s Obituary, p.\r\n  17). This Tilney is recorded elsewhere as ‘Tilney Couchman.’ Mr.\r\n  Wedgewood says, ‘Coach. The Fr. _coucher_ became in Dutch _koetsen_—to\r\n  lie; whence “koetse,” a couch—a litter, a carriage in which you may\r\n  recline, a _coach_’ (p. 159). The twofold spelling of this Tilney’s\r\n  name is thus explained. Hence, too, ‘Couchmen’ represents but the\r\n  older form of ‘Coachman’—Richard Couchman, Z., ‘William Cowcheman,’\r\n  EE., John Coacheman, Z.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  In the _York Pageant_ the ‘Sellers’ and the ‘Satellers’ went together.\r\n  The latter, doubtless, made satchels, and would differ little from the\r\n  ‘bourser’ or ‘pouchemaker’ of that period. In the _Prompt. Parv._ we\r\n  find ‘Sele, horsys harneys.’ A ‘John de Essex, Selmakere,’ occurs in\r\n  the _London Records_, 1310, and a ‘Robert Newcomen, Sealmaker,’ 1311.\r\n  (Riley’s _London_, pp. xxii., xxx.) The latter, doubtless, was a maker\r\n  of seals, like some of the ‘le Selers’ of this period. I have\r\n  mentioned them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  While, as I have just said, in the _York Pageant_ it is the\r\n  ‘Satellers’ and ‘Sellers’ who go together, in the _Chester Play_ it is\r\n  the ‘Saddlers’ and ‘Fusterers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  In Holland’s version of Pliny it is said that the Empress Poppæa ‘was\r\n  knowne to cause her ferrers ordinarily to shoe her coach horses and\r\n  other palfries, &c., with cleane gold.’ (Way’s _Prompt. Par._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  A suggestion I received at a dinner-table the other day that ‘ostler’\r\n  was merely a corruption of ‘oat-stealer’ I may as well mention here.\r\n  It is certainly suggestive, if not overburdened with accuracy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  ‘William le Vendour’ is registered in the _Cal. Rot. Chartarum_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Riley, in his interesting _Memorials of London_, quotes from the\r\n  _Rolls of Gaol Delivery_, temp. Edward I., the name of ‘Richard\r\n  Witbred, hodere,’ who had been slain in one of the city streets.\r\n  (Introduction, p. xi.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  An act of Edward VI. speaks of ‘the buying of anye corne, fyshe,\r\n  butter, or cheese by any suche Badger, Lader, Kyddier, or Carrier as\r\n  shal be assigned and allowed to that office.’ (5 & 6 Ed. VI. c. 14.) A\r\n  confirmation of this act by Elizabeth alters ‘Kyddier’ to ‘Kydder.’\r\n  The _lader_ was the old carrier or leader. I have deferred speaking of\r\n  him till my next chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  The greed of these strolling ecclesiastics is frequently alluded to in\r\n  the writings of this period. An old song on the Minorite friars says—\r\n\r\n        ‘They preche alle of povert, but that love they naught,\r\n         For gode mete to their mouthe the toun is through sought.’\r\n                                    (_Pol. Poems_, vol. i. p. 270.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  An act was passed in Edward VI.’s reign to suppress in some degree the\r\n  number of this wandering fraternity:—‘Forasmuch as it is evident that\r\n  Tynkers, Pedlers, and such like vagrant persones are more hurtfull\r\n  than necessarie to the Commen Wealth of this realme, be it therefore\r\n  ordeyned ... that ... no person or persones commonly called Pedler,\r\n  Tynker, or Pety Chapman, shall wander or go from one towne to another,\r\n  or from place to place, out of the towne, parishe, or village, where\r\n  such person shall dwell, and sell pynnes, poyntes laces, gloves,\r\n  knyves, glasses, tapes, or any suche kynde of wares whatsoever, or\r\n  gather connye skynnes, &c.’ (5 & 6 Ed. VI. c. 21)\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  ‘John le Coper’ is found in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lambert Hardewareman’ (W. ii.) is met with in York in 1473. Whether\r\n  he was a travelling dealer or no, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  It is to the humorous and familiar associations inseparably connected\r\n  with the early chapman we owe our ‘chap,’ a mere corruption of the\r\n  above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  Mr. William Markettman was appointed by the Committee of Plundered\r\n  Ministers in 1650 to the Rectory of Elstree. (Clutterbuck’s\r\n  _Hertford_, vol. i. 161.) ‘Articles exhibited against Clement\r\n  Marketman, executor of Clement Stuppeney, &c.’ (_State Papers_, July\r\n  25, 1623.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  ‘Willmo Mone sometario ad unum somerum pro armis Regis.’ (_Wardrobe of\r\n  Edward I._, p. 77.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  Thus the somewhat incongruous expression in Psalm cxxvii. 1, ‘the\r\n  watchman waketh but in vain,’ is explained. That a sentinel should\r\n  require rousing is opposed to all our ideas of the duties associated\r\n  with this office. It should be ‘the watchman watcheth but in vain.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  It is in allusion to the disturbance thus created in the small hours\r\n  of the night we find a writer of the Stuart period saying, not\r\n  unwittily, to one thus rudely aroused:—\r\n\r\n          ‘That you are vext their _wakes_ your neighbours keep\r\n           They guess it is, because you want your _sleep_:\r\n           I therefore wish that you your _sleep_ would take,\r\n           That they (without offence) might keep their _wake_.’\r\n                                   (Brand’s _Pop. Ant._ iii. 9.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Isaac Wake was university orator in 1607. He preached Rainold’s\r\n  funeral sermon. Dr. Sleep was the leading preacher in Cambridge at the\r\n  same time. James I., who dearly loved a pun, said ‘he always felt\r\n  _inclined_ to Wake when he heard Sleep, and to Sleep when he heard\r\n  Wake,’ _i.e._, he could not decide on the relative merits of the two.\r\n  (Brooks’ _Puritans_, vol. ii. p. 180.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Thus, in the _Winter’s Tale_, the servant says: ‘I have done. Come,\r\n  you promised me a tawdry-lace and a pair of gloves.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  A law was passed at Winchester in 1285 that no fair or market should\r\n  be held in the churchyard, as had previously been the case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  The same record, however, contains a ‘Fairman Alberd,’ so that, like\r\n  ‘Coleman’ and ‘Bateman,’ it may have been but a personal name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  It is from this same root that our ‘Kemp’ is derived, meaning a\r\n  soldier.\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  In the Complaint of the Plowman, too, we are told that the priests\r\n  were always—\r\n\r\n                    ‘At the wrestling and the wake,\r\n                     And chief chantours at the nale.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  In the _Household Book of the Earl of Northumberland_, in 1511, under\r\n  the head of ‘Rewards,’ is one of ‘6_s._ 8_d._ to the Kyngs and Queenes\r\n  Barward, if they have one, when they come to the Earl’ (Way). In the\r\n  Parliamentary Rolls mention is made concerning the ‘Beremaistre of the\r\n  Forest of Peake.’ It was not till 1835 that bear or bull baiting was\r\n  finally forbidden by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  An old tavern-sign in Cheshire bore the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n                           ‘Good bear sold here,\r\n                            Our own Bruin.’\r\n\r\n  The book which records this quotes from the _Congleton Town Register_:\r\n  ‘1599.—Paid the bearward, 4_s._ 4_d._’ ‘1601.—Gave the bearward at the\r\n  great cock-fight, 6_s._ 8_d._’ (_Cheshire Ballads_, p. 259.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  A story is told of an officious clerk belonging to an old rural church\r\n  who, overwhelmed with the honour of having a bishop presiding at a\r\n  visitation there, ransacked his brains for something worthy the\r\n  occasion, and then in stentorian voice gave out, instead of the usual\r\n  Sternholdic lines, the following variation:—\r\n\r\n                      ‘Ye little hills and dales,\r\n                        Why do ye skip and hop?\r\n                       Is it because yer glad to see\r\n                        His Grace the Lord Bish-op?’\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  Curiously enough, we have the name of ‘Robert Harpmaker’ mentioned in\r\n  an old Oxford record, 1452. (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._) This we may look\r\n  upon, therefore, as an old-standing nuisance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  Burton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, says: ‘Let them freely feast,\r\n  sing, and dance, have their poppet-playes, hobby-horses, tabers,\r\n  crouds, bag-pipes,’ &c. (P. 276.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  The names of ‘William Elyott, luter,’ and ‘William Spenser, harpour,’\r\n  occur in 1432 in an old York will. (_Test. Eboracensia_, vol. ii. p.\r\n  21, Surtees Soc.) ‘Haunce (Hans) the luter’ and ‘Philip the luter’ are\r\n  frequently mentioned in _Privy Expenses_ (Princess Mary).\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  This name evidently lasted till the seventeenth century, for in 1641\r\n  an ‘Adam Orgener’ entered C. C. Coll. Cam. (_Vide_ Masters’ history of\r\n  that college.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  The ‘Rhymer’ is often mentioned as belonging to the royal or feudal\r\n  retinue. Like many of the above, he may be set among our list of early\r\n  officerships.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  We may set here our ‘Bidders,’ or ‘Ernald le Bidere,’ as he was once\r\n  recorded. He was the general beggar of that day, and no doubt a rich\r\n  harvest would be the result of his attendance at the fair. Piers\r\n  Plowman says:—\r\n\r\n                    ‘Bidderes and beggares\r\n                     Faste about yede,\r\n                     With their belies and their bagges\r\n                     Of bread ful y-crammed.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Simon le Shobeggere’ (H.R.), or ‘Shoe-beggar,’ as I presume means,\r\n  seems to have followed a more particular line of business.\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n                 Here is Glyed Wolby of Gylforde squyere,\r\n                 Andrew of Habyngedon, apell byer.\r\n\r\n                 (_Cocke Lorelle’s Bote._)\r\n\r\n  I am afraid the reader will scarcely recognise ‘Wool-buyer’ in\r\n  ‘Wolby,’ but I doubt not such was the trader referred to. ‘Geoffrey le\r\n  Wolle-byer’ occurs in the Parliamentary Writs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  One of Edward III.’s statutes says: ‘That a certain number of\r\n  portours, pakkers, gwynders (winders), and other laborers of wools and\r\n  all other merchandizes, be sufficiently ordained for the place where\r\n  the staple is.’ (_Stat. of Realm_, vol. i. p. 341.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  It is not impossible that this species of cloth was in use by the\r\n  lower classes for articles of apparel. Chaucer, in his _Romance_,\r\n  refers to such a habit when he says:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘She ne had on but a straite old sacke,\r\n                  And many a cloute on it there stacke,\r\n                    This was her cote, and her mantele.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  A prayer to the Commons, in 1464, respecting the importation of\r\n  foreign goods and merchandise, mentions ‘the makers of wollen cloth\r\n  within this Reame, as Wevers, Fullers, Dyers, _Kempsters_, Carders,\r\n  and Spynners.’ (_Rot. Parl._ Ed. IV.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  A recipe from an old Harleian MS. thus begins: ‘Recipe brawne of\r\n  capons or of hennys, and dry them wele, and towse them small.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  In the south walk, Westminster Abbey, are gravestones recording the\r\n  deaths of ‘George Slemaker,’ 1802, and ‘Susannah Slemaker,’ his widow,\r\n  1818. (_Vide_ Neale’s _Westminster Abbey_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  Richard Slawright was prior of the Hermit Friars of St. Augustine\r\n  Warrington, in 1516. (_Warrington in 1465._ Ch. Soc., p. xliv.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  A chantry to the church of All Saints, York, was erected in the\r\n  fifteenth century by Adam del Bank, Littester.’ (_Hist. and Ant. of\r\n  York_, vol. ii. p. 269.) The _Promp. Par._ has ‘Lystare, or Lytaster\r\n  of cloth dyynge—Tinctor.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Fulman,’ a learned antiquary, died in 1688. (_Vide_ Dyce’s\r\n  _Shakespeare_, vol. i. p. 35.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  A statute of Elizabeth regarding the apprenticeship of poor children\r\n  includes among others, ‘Wollen-weaver, weaving housewiefes or\r\n  householde clothe onely and none other, Clothe-Fuller, otherwise\r\n  called Tucker, or Walker.’ (5 Eliz. c. 4, 23.) ‘Of William Reynolles,\r\n  walker, for half a pewe with Edward Doughtie, 3_s._ 4_d._’\r\n  (_Churchwardens’ Expenses, Ludlow_, p. 154 (1571), Cam. Soc.) In the\r\n  _Chester Play_ the ‘weavers and walkers’ marched together. (_Vide_\r\n  Appendix.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  This practice of treading the cloth is referred to in a complaint\r\n  concerning the fulling of caps and hats in fulling mills, made to\r\n  Edward IV. It begins by saying that hats, caps, and bonnets hitherto\r\n  had been made, wrought, fulled, and thicked in the wonted manner, that\r\n  is to say, with hands and feet—‘mayns et pees’—and then proceeds to\r\n  urge that the use of mills brought inferior articles into the market.\r\n  (_Stat. of Realm_, vol. ii. p. 473.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  A ‘John Wollebeter’ is mentioned in an old Suffolk will of 1370.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  We have the word ‘bat’ used in Wicklyffe’s Testament: ‘In that hour\r\n  Jhesus seide to the people, as to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis\r\n  and battis to take me.’ (Matt. xxvi. 55.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  God made ‘ffor to cover us and clethe us also lyne, and wolle and\r\n  lethire.’ (_Mirror of St. Edmund_, Early Eng. Text Soc., p. 21.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  The bailiff of Norwich in 1250 was ‘Otto le Texter or Weaver.’ (_Hist.\r\n  Norfolk_, iii. 58.) ‘John Tixter’ was Mayor of Gloucester in 1270.\r\n  (Rudder’s _Gloucestershire_, p. 113.) On the 30th April 1873, the\r\n  _Manchester Courier_ announced ‘the suspension of Messrs. Textor and\r\n  Co., silk merchants, London.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  In the _Prompt. Parv._ we find the feminine termination to have been\r\n  in general use in Norfolk. The author has ‘pleykstare—candidarius,’\r\n  and further on, ‘whytstare, or pleykstare—candidarius, candidaria.’\r\n  Earlier in the work, too, occurs ‘bleystare, or wytstare (bleykester\r\n  or whytster)—candidarius.’ That the name lingered there for a\r\n  considerable period is proved by the fact of a ‘Robert Blaxter’\r\n  appearing as defendant in the Court of Chancery in a Norfolk case at\r\n  the close of the sixteenth century. (_Proceedings in Chancery_\r\n  (Elizabeth), vol. i. p. 250.) The earlier spelling is found in such\r\n  entries as ‘Will le Bleckestere’ (H.R.) or ‘Richard le Blekstare’ (P.\r\n  W.). Blackister, like Blaxter, still exists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n                  Sylkewomen, pursers, and garnysshers,\r\n                  Tablemakers, sylkedyers, and shepsters.\r\n\r\n                  (_Cocke Lorelle’s Bote._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  In _A Complaint of Artificers to Parliament_, in 1463, there is\r\n  included amongst other productions, ‘Laces, corses, ribans, frenges of\r\n  silke and of threde, threden laces, _throwen_ silke, silke in eny wise\r\n  embrauded.’ (_Rot. Parl._, Ed. IV.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  ‘Edmund Barkmaker’ occurs in ‘Calendar to Pleadings.’ (Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  According to Strype, the ‘Company of Megusers’ dealt in the skins of\r\n  dead horses, and flayed them. He mentions ‘Walter le Whitawyer’ in the\r\n  same account. (_London_, vol. ii. p. 232.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above, I have discovered in the same rolls a\r\n  ‘Gilbert _le_ Tower’ and a ‘Thomas _le_ Touere,’ proving my surmise to\r\n  be correct. The feminine form is also to be met with in a ‘Juliana le\r\n  Touestre,’ this entry, too, being found in the same register.\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Many of these cries originated surnames, which, however, in most\r\n  cases, died with their owners. ‘Fresh-fish’ is found as the sobriquet\r\n  of a fishmonger; and ‘Coloppes,’ ‘Mackerell,’ and ‘Peascod,’ all\r\n  figure in the rolls of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  A complaint of craftsmen presented to Parliament in the reign of\r\n  Edward IV. speaks of ‘silke in eny wise embrauded, golden laces, tyres\r\n  of silke or of gold, sadles,’ &c. (_Rot. Parl._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  The caul, or membrane occasionally found round the head of a\r\n  newly-born child, was ever preserved by the midwife, in accordance\r\n  with an old superstition, as a preservative against accidents, but\r\n  especially against drowning. So late as Feb. 27, 1813, the _Times_\r\n  newspaper had the following advertisement in its pages: ‘To persons\r\n  going to sea.—A child’s caul, in a perfect state, to be sold cheap.\r\n  Apply at 5, Duke Street, Manchester Square, where it may be seen.’ An\r\n  inventory of goods, dated 1575, we find thus beginning: ‘Imprimis, a\r\n  cubborde, 20_s._; a calle, 5_s._; a table, 3_s._ 4_d._’\r\n  (_Richmondshire Wills_, p. 259.) With regard to the caul as an article\r\n  of dress, we may quote the following: ‘Maydens wear sylken callis,\r\n  with the whyche they kepe in ordre theyr heare, made yellow with lye.’\r\n  (_Hormani Vulgaria._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  Query—Did ‘Richard le Couhelere,’ recorded in the Parliamentary Writs,\r\n  dress, prepare, and sell cow-heels? There is nothing improbable in it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  ‘E qe chascun esquier porte _chapel_ des armes son Seigneur:’—‘And\r\n  that every esquire do bear a cap of the armes of his lord.’ (_Stat. of\r\n  Realm_, vol. i. p. 220.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  A complaint on the subject of hats, bonnets, and caps, in 1482, speaks\r\n  of these three specific articles as ‘hœures, bonnettez, et cappez.’\r\n  (_Stat. of Realm_, vol. ii. p. 473.) ‘Bonnet,’ I need scarcely add, is\r\n  here used, as it is still in Scotland to this day, as meaning a cap or\r\n  covering generally for the head.\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  The ecclesiastic tailor was not wanting, judging by such an entry as\r\n  ‘Robert Vestment-maker’ (W. 2).\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Talking of Latin forms, however, we are reminded that not unfrequently\r\n  an artisan of this class would be recorded as ‘William Scissor,’ or\r\n  ‘Walter Cissor,’ a mode of writing the name very common in our more\r\n  formal records.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  As a common instance of the transition process then at work we may\r\n  cite the name of ‘John le Wympler, Goldsmith,’ which occurs in the\r\n  London records of this time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  A ‘Robert Ornel, paternostrer,’ is mentioned, under date 1276, by the\r\n  same writer. (_Memorials of London_, p. xxi.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard le Nedeler’ represented Chichester in Parliament in 1305.\r\n  (_Hist. West.

There\r\n  was certainly a court craftsman of this kind. An act of the first year\r\n  of Edw. IV. speaks of ‘oure Glasier, Messagiers of oure Exchequer,\r\n  _Browderer_, Plumber, Joynour, Maker of Arrows within the Toure of\r\n  London,’ &c. (_Rot.

(Strype.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  Under date 1355, Mr. Riley, in his interesting _Memorials of London_,\r\n  gives the ‘Articles and Ordinances of the Braelers.’ He also has an\r\n  account of the burning of some gloves and _braels_ for being of false\r\n  make and fashion in 1350. (_Vide_ pp. 277 and 249.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  And ‘also, every sowtere that maketh shoon of new rothes’ lether,’\r\n  etc. (_Usages of Winchester. English Guilds_, 359.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 357:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, received of John Bent and John Davies, cordiner, for one pew,\r\n  ii_s._’ 1571. (_Churchwardens’ Exp. Ludlow_, p. 148. Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 358:\r\n\r\n  In the Mysteries composed for the City Pageant by Randle, a monk of\r\n  Chester Abbey, in the thirteenth century, a part in it is directed to\r\n  be sustained by the ‘Corvesters and Shoemakers.’ (Ormerod’s\r\n  _Cheshire_, p. 301). In this case we have the strictly speaking Saxon\r\n  feminine termination appended to a Norman word. I have found three\r\n  ‘Shoemakers.’ ‘Harry Shomaker’ was an attendant of the Princess Mary\r\n  (1542). (_Privy Purse Expenses_, p. 2.) ‘Christopher Shoomaker’ was\r\n  burnt at Newbury (1518), whose story is related by Foxe. The name\r\n  seems to have lingered on till the close of the xviiith cent., for it\r\n  is found in St. Anne’s register, Manchester, in 1781, as ‘Showmaker:’\r\n  ‘Mary, wife of John Showmaker, buried Aug. 26, 1781.’ This spelling\r\n  reminds me of an entry in the Household of Princess Elizabeth, Cam.\r\n  Soc.:—‘Robert Waterman for showing (shoeing) xvii_s._’ (p. 29.)\r\n\r\n  ‘And that the corvesers bye ther lether in the seid Gild-halle.’\r\n  (_Ordinances of Worcester, English Guilds_, 371).\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  Another form of the name and occupation is met with in the _Corp.\r\n  Christi Guild_, York, in the case of ‘Robert Patener, et Mariona uxor\r\n  ejus’ (W. ii.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Rykedon, patynmaker,’ occurs in the Patent Rolls (R.R., 1).\r\n\r\nFootnote 361:\r\n\r\n  It is evidently in a depreciatory sense that Bishop Latimer in one of\r\n  his sermons makes use of this word, while his very employment of it\r\n  shows how familiar was its meaning as a term of occupation, even in\r\n  the sixteenth century. He says, speaking of a certain bishop, ‘There\r\n  stood by him a dubber, one Doctor Dubber: he dubbed him by-and-by, and\r\n  said,’ &c. Second Sermon before Edward VI.\r\n\r\nFootnote 362:\r\n\r\n  The word was evidently in familiar use. Thus in the will of one\r\n  William Askame, dated 1390, it is said, ‘Item, Margaretæ prenticiæ\r\n  Willielmi Askham do et lego a fedir bedd and i matras, ii shetes and a\r\n  coverlet, i bacyn and i laver, and a bras potte and volette of crysp.\r\n  Item Johannæ Dagh crisp volet and a _chalon_.’—_Test. Ebor._, vol. i.\r\n  p. 130. (_Surt. Soc._)\r\n\r\n  ‘And that no chalon of ray, or other chalon, shall be made, if it be\r\n  not of the ancient lawful assize, ordained by the good folks of the\r\n  trade.’ (Ext. from _Ordinances of the Tapicers_, Riley’s _London_, p.\r\n  179.)\r\n\r\n  ‘Also, non of the Citee ne shal don werche qwyltes ne chalouns\r\n  withoute the walles of the Citee (_i.e._ Winchester).’ (_English\r\n  Guilds_, p. 351.)\r\n\r\n  The Chaloner is styled the ‘Chaloun-makyere’ in this ordinance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  In the Guild of St. George, Norwich, 1385, is mentioned the name of\r\n  ‘Geoffrey Bedwevere.’ He would be either a quilter, or one of those\r\n  artisans alluded to by Cocke Lorelle.\r\n\r\n                ‘Fyners, plummers, and peuters,\r\n                 Bedmakers, fedbedmakers, and wyredrawers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  I find several writers speaking (Mr. Riley among them) as if the\r\n  upholder was simply an undertaker. He may have been this, but it is\r\n  evident it was but a subordinate branch of his occupation. We find in\r\n  1445 a certain ‘Richard Upholder’ appraising the _bedroom_ furniture\r\n  of James Hedyan, the Principal of ‘Eagle Hall.’ (_Mun. Acad. Oxon._,\r\n  p. 544.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 365:\r\n\r\n  The ordinances for the Guild of St. Katharine, Lynn, are signed by\r\n  ‘Peter Tapeser.’—_English Guilds_, p. 68. (E. E. Text Soc.)\r\n\r\n  The following entry from the _Exchequer Issues_ will give the reader a\r\n  fair idea of the work that came under the tapiser’s hands:—‘To John\r\n  Flessh, tapestry maker. In money paid to him for a side cushion, or\r\n  carpet, a bench, and five cushions worked with the king’s arms ... to\r\n  be placed about, and hung at the back of the king’s justice seats of\r\n  his common bench within Westminster Hall.’—14 Henry VI.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  It is only right to say that there seems to have been a term ‘coucher’\r\n  to imply one who resided in certain towns for purposes of trade of a\r\n  somewhat doubtful character. In this sense it was but a French\r\n  sobriquet, meaning in English ‘a lurker.’ A statute of Edward III.\r\n  concerning the prices of wine and their import speaks of ‘Cochoures\r\n  Engleys’ (English couchers, or lurkers), living in Rochelle, Bordeaux,\r\n  etc., who traded in wines. The tenor of the allusion to them, however,\r\n  is such that we could hardly expect them to be represented openly in\r\n  an English pageant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  An old Yorkshire will, dated 1383, contains the following bequest: ‘To\r\n  John Couper, a docer, and a new banaquer (a seat-cover) and ij cochyns\r\n  (cushions).’ (Surtees Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  Beatrice ap Rice, laundress to Princess Mary (daughter of Henry\r\n  VIII.), is always set down as ‘Mistress Launder.’ ‘Item, paid for 2\r\n  lb. of starche for Mts Launder, viiid.’ (_Privy Purse Expenses_, p.\r\n  160.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  The ordinances of the Guild of the Purification, Bishop’s Lynn, 1367,\r\n  are signed by ‘Johannes Austyn, Baxter.’ (_English Guilds_, p. 90.)\r\n\r\n  Capgrave, under date 205 B.C., says, ‘In this same tyme lyved the\r\n  eloquent man which hite (was called) Plautus, and for al his eloquens\r\n  he was compelled for to dwel with a Baxter, and grinde his corn at a\r\n  querne.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  The curious name of ‘Sara le Bredemongestere’ occurs in the ‘London\r\n  Memorials’ (Riley).\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  It is in this more general sense we find the word used in our present\r\n  Authorized Version. Thus in Lev. ii. 4, it is said: ‘And if thou bring\r\n  an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be\r\n  unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers\r\n  anointed with oil.’—‘Pay to Ralph Crast the waferer, 40_s._ of our\r\n  gift.’ (‘Issues of Exchequer,’ 26 Henry III.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  This corruption seems to have early become the accepted one. A John\r\n  Flanner entered C.C. Col., Cambridge, in 1649. (_Hist. C.C. Coll._).\r\n  In 1641 another John Flanner was Rector of Kilverstone. (_Hist.\r\n  Norf._, I. 546.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above I have found a ‘William Buttyrman’ in the\r\n  _Test. Ebor._, vol. iii., Surtees Soc., but I can discover no trace of\r\n  its continuance beyond its immediate possessor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  The Hundred Rolls furnish us with the local ‘Adam del Cheshus,’\r\n  _i.e._, Cheese-house. He would be connected with some country dairy or\r\n  city store-room. The name is formed like ‘Malthus,’ from ‘Malt-house,’\r\n  or ‘Loftus,’ from ‘Loft-house.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  In the country, and more north, we shall scarcely find the term to\r\n  have made any way till even the fifteenth century. In the York Pageant\r\n  which occurred in 1415, and was supposed to represent, as a survey of\r\n  its programme shows it evidently did, every trade or occupation that\r\n  could claim the slightest right to attention, we do not find it having\r\n  a place. The ‘Spicers’ and ‘Sauce-makers’ are prominent, however, and\r\n  they, no doubt, even then were upholding the interests of the trade\r\n  which by-and-by was to go under this new sobriquet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  ‘Joan Sausemaker’ occurs in the _Corpus Christi Guild_, York.\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Nutmaker’ gave to a loan upon Middlesex in 1463. (_Vide_\r\n  _Scobell’s Declarations of Parl._, 429.) This name has troubled me\r\n  much. Halliwell has ‘nut,’ a term for sweet-bread in the eastern\r\n  counties. Failing this, I can only suggest ‘nutmegger,’ and place it\r\n  among those set down in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  We are all familiar with the old adage,\r\n\r\n                        ‘After dinner sit awhile,\r\n                         After supper walk a mile’:\r\n\r\n  it often used to puzzle me that this last line, while speaking from a\r\n  medical point of view, should so calmly give up the general question\r\n  as to whether suppers were or were not advisable as a part of the\r\n  domestic _régime_. When we remember, however, that the couplet\r\n  doubtless arose in a day when dinner was at twelve and supper at five\r\n  or six, we can better understand its intent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  William Fleshmonger, D.C.L., was Dean of Chichester in 1528. (_Hist.\r\n  Univ. Oxford._ Ackermann, p. 154.)\r\n\r\n  ‘Also, the usage of fleshemongeres ys swych, that everych\r\n  fleshemongere’ not a freman shall pay 25_d._ a year to the King if he\r\n  have a stall. (_Usages of Winchester. English Gilds_, 354.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  The following list in one of our early statutes will help to\r\n  familiarize the reader’s mind with some of these mediæval Latinisms:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, sallarii, pelletarii, allutarii, sutores, cissores, fabri,\r\n  carpentarii, cementarii, tegularii, batellarii, carectarii, et\r\n  quicunque alii artifices non capiant pro labore et artificio suo,’\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, quod carnifices, piscenarii, hostellarii, braciatores,\r\n  pistores, pulletarii et omnes alii venditores victualium teneantur\r\n  hujus-modi victualia vendere,’ etc. [_Stat. of Realm_, vol. 1. p.\r\n  308.)\r\n\r\n  The first list refers to the ‘saddlers, skinners, whitetawyers,\r\n  shoemakers, taylors, wrights, carpenters, masons, tylers, boatwrights,\r\n  and carters;’ the second to the ‘butchers, fishmongers, taverners,\r\n  brewers, bakers, and poulterers.’ With regard to the ‘Carnifex’ we may\r\n  add that among other items of expenditure belonging to Edw. I.’s Queen\r\n  at Cawood is mentioned ‘expensa duorum carnificum eosdem boves\r\n  emencium.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  ‘Egeas Fisher, or Pessoner,’ was Mayor of Gloucester in 1241.\r\n  (Rudder’s _Gloucestershire_, p. 113.) ‘Ralf le Pecimer’ was bailiff of\r\n  Norwich in 1239. (_Blomefield_, iii. 58.) This is a manifest\r\n  corruption of Pessoner.\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  That this is the real origin of this name may be proved by 1 James I.\r\n  c. xxiii., which is entitled an ‘Acte for the better preservation of\r\n  Fishinge in the Counties of Somersett, Devon, and Cornwall, and for\r\n  the relief of Balkers, Conders, and Fishermen against malicious\r\n  suites.’ In it too is found the following: ‘And whereas also for the\r\n  necessarie use of the takinge of the said Herring ... divers persons\r\n  ... called Balcors, Huors, Condors, Directors, or Guidors, at the\r\n  fishing tymes ... tyme out of mynde have used to watch and attend upon\r\n  the high hilles and grounde near adjoining to the sea coast ... for\r\n  the discoverie and givinge notice to the fisherman,’ etc. (_Stat. of\r\n  Realm._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lawrence Beerbrewer’ occurs in a Norfolk register. (_Hist. Norf._ iv.\r\n  357.) ‘Lambert Beerbrewer’ was one of the Corp. Christi Guild, York.\r\n  (Surt. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  ‘Malter’ I have failed to discover in our archives, but ‘Aleyn le\r\n  Maltestere’ and ‘Hugh le Maltmakere’ are both found. On the other\r\n  hand, while I have no feminine ‘Tapster’ to adduce, I have hit upon\r\n  ‘Robert le Tappere’ and ‘John le Tapper’ in two separate records.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  A curious name is found in the St. Edmund’s Guild, Bishop’s Lynn, the\r\n  ordinances of which are signed by ‘Johannes Mashemaker’ (_English\r\n  Guilds_, p. 96), evidently a maker of mash-vats or of the mashel,\r\n  _i.e._, the rudder used for mixing the malt. (v. _Maschel Pr. Par._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  Another proof of this is contained in the fact that in all allusions\r\n  in our olden ordinances to false dealings in the brewing and sale of\r\n  ale the punishment affixed is that of the _tumbrel_, the instrument\r\n  for women, corresponding to the _pillory_ for men. I would not be\r\n  mistaken. I cannot doubt but that malster, tapster, baxter, webster,\r\n  and kempster were feminine occupations, and arose first in these forms\r\n  as such. But in the xivth century the distinction between ‘er’ and\r\n  ‘ster’ was dropped through the Norman-French ‘ess’ becoming the\r\n  popular termination. As ‘ess’ became still more strongly imbedded in\r\n  the language, ‘ster’ came into but more irregular use, and by the time\r\n  of Elizabeth men spoke of ‘drugster,’ ‘teamster,’ ‘rhymster,’\r\n  ‘whipster,’ ‘trickster,’ ‘gamester.’ (_English Accidence_, p. 90.)\r\n  That this confusion was marked even in the earlier part of the xivth\r\n  century, not to say the close of the xiiith, is clearly proved by such\r\n  registered names as ‘Thatcher’ and ‘Thaxter,’ ‘Palliser’ and\r\n  ‘Pallister,’ ‘Hewer’ and ‘Hewster,’ ‘Begger’ and ‘Beggister,’\r\n  ‘Blacker’ (bleacher) and ‘Blaxter,’ ‘Dyer’ and ‘Dyster,’ ‘Whiter’ and\r\n  ‘Whitster,’ ‘Corviser’ and ‘Corvester,’ and ‘Bullinger,’ or\r\n  ‘Billinger,’ and ‘Billingster.’ An old statute of Ed. III. (_Statute\r\n  Realm_, 1, 380) mentions ‘filesters,’ ‘throwsters,’ and ‘brawdesters;’\r\n  and Dr. Morris quotes ‘bellringster,’ ‘hoardster,’ and ‘washster.’\r\n  These latter are xiith and xiiith century words, and were strictly\r\n  confined to women.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  I find the term used occupatively once. Cocke Lorelle speaks of\r\n\r\n                 ‘Spynsters, carders, and cappe-knytters.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  ‘Juliana Rokster’ occurs in an old record of 1388 (R.R. 2). The ‘rock’\r\n  was the old distaff. (_Vide_ p. 74, note 2.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  ‘Edmund le Tonder’ was bailiff of Norwich, 1237.\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  The bailiff of Gloucester, in the year 1300, was ‘Robert L’espicer, or\r\n  Apothecary.’ (Rudder’s _Gloucestershire_, p. 114.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  We have a similar curtailment in our ‘Prentices’ or ‘Prentis’s’\r\n  (relics of ‘William le Prentiz’ or ‘Nicholas Apprenticius’) a name of\r\n  the most familiar import at the time of which we are speaking. Chaucer\r\n  begins his ‘Cook’s Tale’ by saying—\r\n\r\n                  ‘A prentis whilom dwelt in our citee,\r\n                   And of a craft of vitaillers was he.’\r\n\r\n  In the early days of national commerce and industry, when the jealousy\r\n  of foreign craftsmen was at its height, the prentice boys showed\r\n  themselves on various occasions a formidable body, capable of arousing\r\n  riots and tumults of the most serious character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  Early Eng. Text Soc., Extra Series, vol. viii. p. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  The surname of ‘Shaver’ was not unknown then as now. ‘Jeffery\r\n  Schavere’ was rector of Fincham, Norfolk, in 1409 (Blomefield). ‘Henry\r\n  Shavetail,’ an evident nickname, occurs in the Patent Rolls (R.R.1).\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  In a popular poem of Henry the Eighth’s time mention is made of—\r\n\r\n                  ‘Harpemakers, leches, and upholdsters,\r\n                   Porters, fesycyens, and corsers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Johannes Thurton, Candelere. (Guild of St. George, Norwich.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  Thus we find in an indenture of Henry the Seventh’s reign it is said\r\n  at the close: ‘And over this oure said Souveraigne Lorde graunteth by\r\n  these presents to the said Abbas and Convent that they shall have as\r\n  well this present Indenture as all other grauntes necessary, ...\r\n  wythout eny fyne, fee, or other thyng to hym orto his use in his\r\n  Chauncerie, or Hanapore, or other place to be payde.’ (_Stat. of\r\n  Realm_, vol. ii. p. 671.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Way’s _Prompt Parv._, p. 124.\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  Thus the author of _Cocke Lorelle’s Bote_ refers to—\r\n\r\n                ‘Yermongers, pybakers, and waferers,\r\n                 Fruyters, chesemongers, and mynstrelles.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 399:\r\n\r\n  ‘There dwelled also turners of beads, and they were\r\n  paternoster-makers’ (Stow, iii. 174). The term was evidently very\r\n  general.\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  ‘Founders, laten-workers, and broche-makers.’ (_Cocke Lorelle’s\r\n  Bote._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  A law passed in the first year of Richard II. forbids halfpennies and\r\n  farthings to be melted for vessels or other things, on pain of\r\n  forfeiting the money so melted and the imprisonment of the\r\n  founder—‘surpeine de forfaitre del monoie founder et imprisonement del\r\n  foundour.’ (_Stat. Realm._) The ‘founder,’ as his name implies, melted\r\n  down the metal, and then poured it (fundere) into the mould. We still\r\n  speak familiarly of a foundry; but the term ‘founder’ as a worker\r\n  therein is now, I believe, obsolete. Such names, however, as ‘Robert\r\n  le Fundour’ or ‘John le Funder,’ whose descendants are still with us,\r\n  show that this was once in common use. As an additional proof that\r\n  they were formerly more distinctively engaged in the manufacture of\r\n  pots and vessels, we may state that in the York Pageant, elsewhere\r\n  spoken of, the ‘Pewterers’ and ‘Founders’ marched together. Speaking\r\n  of ‘Founder,’ we are reminded of ‘Alefounder.’ In 1374 William\r\n  Alefounder was Rector of Bichamwell. (_Hist. Norf._, vii. 295.) The\r\n  alefounder took his name from his duty as an inspector, appointed by\r\n  the Court Leet, of assizing and supervising the brewing of malt\r\n  liquor. He examined it as it was _poured_ out. Thus ‘fundere,’ and not\r\n  ‘fundare,’ is its root. Another name he bore was that of ‘ale-conner.’\r\n  A poem of James the First’s reign says—\r\n\r\n                   ‘A nose he had that gan show,\r\n                    What liquor he loved I trow;\r\n                    For he had before long “seven yeare,\r\n                    Been of the towne the ale-conner.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  The following entry appears in the _Issues of Exchequer_:—‘20_l._ paid\r\n  to John le Discher, of London, for him and his companions to provide\r\n  plates, dishes, and saltsellers for the coronation.’ (1 Ed. II.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  As an illustration of the use to which the art of working in pewter\r\n  was put, we may instance one of the ‘Richmondshire Wills’ in which the\r\n  following articles of this mixture are bequeathed: ‘iij basyns, ij\r\n  uers, one doson plait trenchers, one brode charger, iiij potigers,\r\n  xx^{tie} platters, x dishes, and vj sausers.’ (_Surtees Soc._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  We find this now well-known surname thus spelt in a statute passed in\r\n  Elizabeth’s reign, in which are included the ‘lynnen-weaver, turner,\r\n  cowper, millers, earthen-potters.’ (5 Eliz. c. iv. 23.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  In the _Issues of the Exchequer_ we find a ‘Ric. le Cuver’ at one time\r\n  providing three _buckets_, and at another working with other eight\r\n  _carpenters_ upon the outer chamber of the King’s Court. (43 Henry\r\n  III.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Busheler’ occurs in Valor. Eccles. Henry VIII. He probably made\r\n  the old bushel measure, once in common use. ‘Is a candle bought to be\r\n  put under a bushel?’ (Mark iv. 26.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Way, in his valuable series of notes to the _Promptorium\r\n  Parvulorum_, quotes a later Wicklyffite version, in which the ‘basket\r\n  of bulrushes’ in which Moses was placed is termed ‘a leep of segg’\r\n  (sedge). An old list of words which he also quotes has ‘a lepe maker,\r\n  cophinarius.’ (_Cath. Ang._) I mention this latter especially, as I\r\n  have not been able so far to light upon any instance of the sobriquet.\r\n  I have no hesitation in saying, however, that if ‘Leaper’ and\r\n  ‘Leapman’ be not manufacturers, they have, at any rate, as\r\n  fish-sellers, originated from the same root. ‘And thei eeten and weren\r\n  fulfilled, and thei taken up that that lefte of relifs sevene leepis.’\r\n  (Matt. viii. 8. Wicklyffe.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  Thus in the Trevelyan papers (Cam. Soc.) we frequently come across\r\n  such a record as the following: ‘Item, to Edmund Peckham, coferer of\r\n  the Kinge’s House for th’expenses and charges, etc.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  The list of tradesmen in _Cock Lorelle’s Bote_ includes—\r\n\r\n               ‘Pype-makers, wode-mongers, and orgyn-makers,\r\n                Coferers, carde-makers, and carvers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 410:\r\n\r\n  An Act of Edward VI. relative to the buying of tanned leather speaks\r\n  of the ‘mysterie of Coriar (currier), Cordewainer, Sadler, Cobler,\r\n  Girdler, Lether-seller, Bottelmaker.’ (3 and 4 Ed. VI. c. 6.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  ‘William le Orbater’ (goldbeater) is also found in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  A ‘Bartholomew le Tableter’ is also found in the ‘Memorials of London’\r\n  (Riley). The date being the same or nearly the same as that of\r\n  ‘Bartholomew le Tabler’ inscribed in the Parliamentary Writs for the\r\n  capital, we may feel assured both are one and the same person.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  ‘And thei bikenyden to his fadir, that he wolde that he were clepid.\r\n  And he axinge a poyntel wrote seiynge Jon is his name.’ (Luke i. 63.\r\n  Wicklyffe.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  I have since discovered another instance of this name—‘To Bartholomew\r\n  le Orologius, after the arrival of William de Pikewell, 23 gallons.’\r\n  1286 (Domesday Book, St. Paul’s, Cam. Soc.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  ‘Imprimis Thomæ Clokmaker for makyng of the sail when it was broken,\r\n  viii_s._’ 1428 (Pro. Ord. Privy Council).\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Stowe and Strype, however, while aware of the corruption, were both\r\n  ignorant of its meaning. Speaking of the woodmongers, the former says,\r\n  ‘Whether some of these woodmongers were called ‘Billiters’ from\r\n  dealing in billets I leave to conjecture. In the register of wills,\r\n  London, mention is made of one William Burford, billeytere.’ (ii. p.\r\n  226.) The Woodmongers were sellers of fuel. ‘Robert Wudemonger’ is\r\n  found in the H.R.\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  I may quote a statement recorded of Congham Manor. ‘In 1349 Thomas de\r\n  Baldeswell presented to the church aforesaid, as chief lord of this\r\n  fee; in 1367, Adam Humphrey, of Refham, and in 1385, but soon after,\r\n  in 1388, Adam Pyk; and in 1400, Edmund Belytter, alias Belzeter, who\r\n  with his parceners,’ &c. (_Hist. Norf._, viii. 383.) The said Edmund\r\n  is also met with elsewhere as ‘Belleyeter’ and Belyetter.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  Another ‘Ralph Balancer’ was sheriff of London in 1316.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  This weight was abolished in 1351, and the balance made universal.\r\n  ‘Item, whereas great damage and deceit is done to the people by a\r\n  weight which is called Auncel (par une pois qu’est appelle Aunsell),\r\n  it is accorded and established that this weight called Auncel betwixt\r\n  buyers and sellers shall be wholly put out, and that every person do\r\n  sell and buy by the balance.’ (_Stat. Realm_, vol. i. p. 321.) Cowell,\r\n  in his _Interpreter_, suggests as the origin of the term ‘auncel’\r\n  _handsale_, that is, that which is weighed by the poised hand!\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Another form is found in 1389. William Parchmenter was seized for\r\n  holding independent views of the Sacraments. (Nicholls’ _Leicester_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  In the _Exchequer Issues_ we find the following:—‘To John Heth, one of\r\n  the clerks in the office of privy seal of the Lord the King, in money,\r\n  paid to his own hands, in discharge of 66_s._ which the said Lord the\r\n  King, with the assent of his Council, commanded to be paid to the said\r\n  John, for 66 great “quaternes” of calf skins, purchased and provided\r\n  by the said John to write a Bible thereon for the use of the said\r\n  King.’ In an old Oxford indenture between the University and the Town,\r\n  dated 1459, we find the more usual ‘parchemener’ spelt ‘pergemener.’\r\n  The agreement includes ‘Alle Bedels with dailly servants, and their\r\n  householdes, alle stacioners, alle bokebynders, lympners, wryters,\r\n  pergemeners, barbours, the bellerynger of the universitie,’ &c. (_Mun.\r\n  Acad. Oxon._, p. 346.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 422:\r\n\r\n  Another ordinance has the following:—‘And that all Jews shall dwell in\r\n  the Kings own cities and boroughs, where the chests of chirographs of\r\n  Jewry are wont to be’ (‘ou les Whuches (hutches) cirograffes de\r\n  Geuerie soleient estre’). [_Stat. of Realm_, vol. i. p. 221.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  ‘Nicholas Cotes, lummer.’ (_Corpus Christi Guild_, York.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  In the _Mun. Acad. Oxon._, p. 550, we find a quarrel settled by the\r\n  Chancellor between ‘John Conaley, lymner,’ and ‘John Godsend,\r\n  stationarius.’ Through him it is arranged that the former shall occupy\r\n  himself in ‘liminando bene et fideliter libros suos.’ In the York\r\n  Pageant the ‘Escriveners’ and ‘Lumners’ went together.\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  Thus in Kaye’s description of the siege of Rhodes it is said: ‘Anone\r\n  after that the Rhodians had knowledge of thees werkes a shipman wel\r\n  experte in swymmyng, wente by nyghte and cutted the cordes fro’ the\r\n  ancre.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 426:\r\n\r\n  In the _Itinerarium_ of Richard I. we find it recorded that while the\r\n  Christians were besieging Acre Saladin’s army began to hem them in.\r\n  ‘In hoc itaque articulo positos visitavit eos Oriens exalto; nam ecce!\r\n  quinquagintas naves, _quas vulgo coggas dicunt_, cum duodecim millibus\r\n  armatorum, tanto gratias venerunt quanto nostris auxilium in angustia\r\n  majore rependunt.’—p. 64. The Cog was evidently in common use as a\r\n  transport. To judge from the following entries, it was, in some cases,\r\n  at any rate, of considerable size:—‘Henrico Aubyn, magistro _coge_\r\n  Sancti Marie, et 39 sociis suis nautis, 23_l._ 12_s._ 6_d._’ ‘Thomo de\r\n  Standanore, magistro _coge_ Sancti Thomæ, et 39 sociis suis, 23_l._\r\n  12_s._ 6_d._’ (Ed. I. Wardrobe.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 427:\r\n\r\n  ‘Benjamin Cogman’ occurs in an old Norfolk register. Hence ‘Cockman,’\r\n  like ‘Cocker,’ may in some instance belong to this more seafaring\r\n  occupation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 428:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Shipgroom’ occurs in the Rot. Orig. (G.); ‘John Shypward’ in\r\n  Cal. Rot. Chartarum (D.); and ‘Alexander Schipward’ in Rolls of Parl.\r\n  (H.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 429:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Drawater’ (A.) would be a nickname.\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  This word ‘lead’ is worthy of some extended notice. We still speak of\r\n  a _path_ leading our steps to a place, but we scarcely now would say\r\n  that _we_ lead our steps to it. Shakespeare, however, does so, where\r\n  Richard III. addresses Elizabeth—\r\n\r\n                ‘Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\r\n                 Leads discontented steps in foreign soil.’\r\n\r\n  Several commentators on Shakespeare have proposed ‘treads’ in the\r\n  place of ‘leads,’ not knowing, seemingly, how familiar was this sense\r\n  of carrying or bearing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A\r\n  century earlier the Malvern Dreamer says—\r\n\r\n                     ‘And maketh of Lyere a lang cart\r\n                      To leden all these othere:’\r\n\r\n  while just before he writes—\r\n\r\n                     ‘And cart-saddle the commissarie,\r\n                      Oure cart shall he lede\r\n                      And fecchen us vitailles.’\r\n\r\n  In North Yorkshire to this very day they do very little _carting_.\r\n  They all but invariably ‘lead hay,’ ‘lead corn,’ etc. An old form of\r\n  ‘lead’ was ‘lode.’ We still talk of a ‘lode-stone.’ This explains such\r\n  an entry as ‘Emma le Lodere’ or ‘Agnes le Lodere.’ They were both\r\n  doubtless ‘leaders’ or ‘carriers,’ that is, wandering hucksters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 431:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, that all wines, red and white, which shall come unto the said\r\n  realm shall be well and lawfully gauged by the King’s Gaugers, or\r\n  their deputies’ (‘bien et loialment gaugez par le gaujeour le Roi, ou\r\n  son deputé.’). (_Stat. of Realm_, vol. i. p. 331.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 432:\r\n\r\n  An epitaph in St. Anthony’s, London, dated 1400, says of the deceased\r\n  that he was—\r\n\r\n               ‘The King’s weigher more than yeres twentie,\r\n                Simon Street, callyd in my place.’\r\n                                     (_Maitland_, ii. 375.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 433:\r\n\r\n  The local form is found in the case of ‘Jeffery Talbothe,’ a Norfolk\r\n  Rector in 1371. (Blomefield). The ‘receipt of custom’ is with\r\n  Wickliffe the ‘tolbothe.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  Skelton seems of the same mind as the author of _Cocke Lorelle_.\r\n\r\n                           ‘So many lollers,\r\n                            So few true tollers,\r\n                            So many pollers,\r\n                                   Saw I never.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  I need not remind the majority of my readers of the origin of our term\r\n  ‘lumber room,’ that it is but a corruption of lombard-room, or the\r\n  chamber in which the mediæval pawnbroker stored up all his pledges.\r\n  Hence we now speak of any useless cumbrous articles as ‘lumber.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 436:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Halliwell gives ‘chevisance,’ an agreement, and ‘chevish,’ to\r\n  bargain. Mr. Way commenting on ‘chevystyn,’ quotes Fabyan as saying—‘I\r\n  will assaye to have hys Erldom in morgage, for welle I knowe he must\r\n  chevyche for money to perfourme that journey.’ Mr. Wright’s Glossary\r\n  to _Piers Plowman_ has ‘chevysaunce, an agreement for borrowing\r\n  money.’ The word often occurs in mediæval writers, and no wonder at\r\n  least one surname arose as a consequence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  An act of Richard II. speaks of officers and ministers made by\r\n  brocage, and of their broggers, and of them that have taken the said\r\n  brocage, ‘pour brogage, et de lor broggers, et de,’ etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  I use this phrase as the most convenient. I shall have to record many\r\n  descriptive compounds under every separate division, but it is the\r\n  most suited for my purpose, and will embrace all the more eccentric\r\n  nicknames that I have met with in my researches, especially those made\r\n  up of verb and substantive, a practice which opened out a wide field\r\n  for the inventive powers of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lease to Thomas Unkle of a wood within the manor of Bolynbroke, Nov.\r\n  30, 1485.’ (Materials for Hist. Henry VII. 593 p.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 440:\r\n\r\n  The English form of Guido was commonly Wydo—hence such entries as\r\n  ‘Wydo Wodecok,’ or ‘William fil. Wydo.’ Thus, as I have already said,\r\n  ‘Widowson’ may be a patronymic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 441:\r\n\r\n  The curious name of ‘John Orphan-strange’ is found in a Cambridge\r\n  register for 1544. (_Hist. C.C. Coll. Cam._) Doubtless he had been a\r\n  foundling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  Some Norman-French terms of relationship have been translated,\r\n  resulting in names of utterly different sense. Thus Beaupere, a\r\n  stepfather, has become ‘Fairsire;’ ‘Beaufils,’ a step-son (still\r\n  surviving in Boffill), ‘Fairchild’; and ‘Beaufrere,’ a step-brother,\r\n  ‘Fairbrother,’ or ‘Farebrother.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 443:\r\n\r\n  ‘Adam de Halfnaked’ (H.), ‘Adam de Halnaked’ (M.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 444:\r\n\r\n  The Hundred Rolls have a ‘Henry Mucklebone.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 445:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lusty,’ ‘Fat,’ and ‘Stout’ evidently were not expressive enough for\r\n  some of our forefathers, to judge by such entries as ‘Henry Pudding,’\r\n  ‘William Broadgirdel,’ or ‘Joan Broad-belt.’ The last still lives.\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  Epitaph on William Younger, Rector of Great-Melton, deceased March\r\n  6th, 1661, ætat. 57—\r\n\r\n              ‘Younger he was by name, but not in grace,\r\n               Elder than he, in this, must give him place.’\r\n\r\n  (_Hist. of Norfolk_, vol. v. p. 13.) ‘Youngerman’ may be seen over a\r\n  shop in Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester.\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  ‘Littler’ and ‘littlest’ were once the common degrees of comparison.\r\n  Shakespeare uses the superlative. Mr. Halliwell gives the Norfolk\r\n  dialect a large range. Besides ‘less’ and ‘least’ he adds ‘lesser’ and\r\n  ‘lessest,’ ‘lesserer’ and ‘lesserest,’ ‘lesserer still’ and ‘lessest\r\n  of all,’ and ‘littler’ and ‘littlest.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  The former ‘Haut,’ that is, high or tall, is obsolete, I think.\r\n  ‘Robert le Haut’ is met with in a Norfolk register. (_Hist. Norf._,\r\n  Index.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  It is curious to compare local registers with local dictionaries. Thus\r\n  the _Promptorium Parvulorum_ gives as a familiar Norfolk term in the\r\n  fourteenth century, ‘craske, fryke of fatte,’ or ‘lusty,’ as we should\r\n  now say. This crask was a vulgar form of the French ‘cras’ (Latin,\r\n  ‘crassus’). Turning to our registers, we find that while our ‘Crass’s’\r\n  are found in our more general rolls as ‘Richard le Cras’ or ‘John le\r\n  Cras’ or ‘Stephen Crassus,’ our ‘Crasks’ must go to a Norfolk entry\r\n  for a ‘Walter le Crask.’ (_Vide Hist. Norfolk_, Index. Blomefield.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robert Manekin,’ A. Nevertheless this is a baptismal name also with\r\n  the diminutive ‘kin’ appended. ‘Manekyn le Heaumer,’ H.\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  ‘To make a mow’ was to put on a mocking expression. The word was once\r\n  very familiar, though rarely used now. Bishop Bradford, speaking of\r\n  the Romish priesthood, says—‘They never preach forth the Lord’s death\r\n  but in mockery and mows.’ (_Parker Soc._, p. 395.) _Mow_ has no\r\n  relation to _mouth_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Malregard’ (T.), or ‘Geoffrey Malreward’ (T.), _i.e._\r\n  Evil-eye, would not possess enviable sobriquets, but the name lingered\r\n  on for several centuries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 453:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Monoculus’ occurs in _Memorials of Fountains Abbey_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 454:\r\n\r\n  A ‘William Blackhead’ entered C. C. Coll. Cam. in 1669, and a ‘Thomas\r\n  Hardhede’ in 1467. (_Hist. C. C. Coll._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  The Abbot of Leicester in 1474 was one ‘John Sheepshead.’ ‘William\r\n  Sheepshead’ is also mentioned in the Index to Nicholls’ _Leicester_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  We must not forget, however, that ‘swier’ is early found as a\r\n  provincialism for ‘squier,’ so that it may be referred in some cases\r\n  to that once important officer. (v. p. 199.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  ‘Guy le Armerecte’ (A.) would seem to be a Latinization of the name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  ‘Henry Langbane’ occurs in the list of the Corpus Christi Guild, York.\r\n  (Surt. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  I see ‘Catterman’ also exists. This is early faced by ‘Richard\r\n  Catermayn’ (H.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  Robert Pettifer was Sheriff of Gloucester in 1603. (Rudder’s\r\n  _Gloucestershire_, p. 116.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  The famous old surname of ‘Ironsides’ is found so late as 1754, the\r\n  Lord Mayor of London for that year being ‘Edward Ironside.’ The Bishop\r\n  of Bristol in 1689 was ‘Gilbert Ironside.’ His father, ‘Gilbert\r\n  Ironside,’ preceded him in the same see.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  ‘Antony Knebone’ (Z.). This would seem to belong to a similar class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  ‘Leg’ did not come into use till the beginning of the xiiith century,\r\n  when it was imported from Norway. ‘Shank,’ as the various compound\r\n  sobriquets found below will fully prove, did duty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Halliwell quotes the following couplet from an old manuscript:\r\n\r\n              ‘Hir one _schanke_ blak hir other _graye_,\r\n              A nd all her body like the lede.’—(Dic. I. 1.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  ‘Gerald Bushanke’ (A.). This might be ‘Beau-shank,’ and therefore\r\n  equivalent to ‘Bellejambe,’ but such an admixture of languages is not\r\n  likely. We still speak of ‘bow-leg,’ and this is the more probable\r\n  origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  _Swift_, however, is not the only courier’s sobriquet preserved to us.\r\n  ‘In the Countess of Leicester’s service were several whose real names\r\n  were sunk in titles ridiculously descriptive of their qualities.\r\n  “_Slingaway_,” the learned editor of the Household Roll, has pointed\r\n  out, he might have added “_Gobithestie_” (go a bit hasty) and\r\n  “_Bolett_” (bullet), so denominated from their speed, and\r\n  “_Truebodie_” (true body) from his fidelity. These were all couriers.’\r\n  (_Hous. Exp. Bish. Swinfield_, p. 143.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  ‘C. P. Golightly,’ ‘Thomas Golightly.’ _Vide_ Clergy List, 1848, and\r\n  other directories.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  I have mentioned ‘Matilda Finger’ (H.). I do not find any ‘Toe’ in our\r\n  Directories, but ‘Peter Pricktoe’ (M.) and ‘Thomas Pinchshu’ (A.)\r\n  existed in the xivth century.\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  Accidents of this kind naturally became sobriquets, and then surnames.\r\n  Hence such entries as ‘William Crypling’ (A.), ‘William Onhand’ (B.),\r\n  ‘John Onehand’ (D.), or ‘John Handless’ (W. 11). ‘John Gouty’ (V. 1)\r\n  represents a still troublesome complaint, and may be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  ‘Jordan le Madde’ occurs in the _Placita de Quo Warranto_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Whitehand’ is set down in the C. C. Coll. records for 1665.\r\n  (_Hist. C. C. Coll. Cam._) ‘Humbert Blanchmains’ is found in Nicholls’\r\n  _Leicestershire_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  In the _Prompt. Parv._ we find not merely ‘slyke, or smothe,’ but\r\n  ‘slykeston.’ The slick or sleek stone was used for smoothing linen or\r\n  paper; _vide_ Mr. Way’s note thereon, p. 458. ‘The eban stone which\r\n  goldsmiths used to sleeken their gold with,’ etc. (Burton’s\r\n  _Anatomy_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  Thus ‘Bell’ comes into three categories—the local, the baptismal, and\r\n  the sobriquet, represented in our registers by three such entries as\r\n  ‘John atte Bell’ (X.), ‘Richard fil. Bell’ (A.), and ‘Walter le Bel’\r\n  (G.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 474:\r\n\r\n  ‘Katharine Prettyman’ (Z.), ‘William Prettiman’ (F.F.). The name still\r\n  flourishes, and as ‘Miss Prettiman’ figures in the _Caudle Lectures_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 475:\r\n\r\n  ‘Nutbrown’ is found in several early records, and existed till 1630 at\r\n  least. ‘George Nutbrowne was sworne the same daye pistler, and\r\n  Nathaniel Pownell, gospeller.’ (_Cheque Bk._, Chapel Royal (Cam.\r\n  Soc.), p. 12.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  ‘White’ and ‘Grissel’ are combined in ‘Anne Griselwhite,’ a name\r\n  occurring in an old Norfolk register. (_Vide_ Index, _Hist. Norfolk_,\r\n  Blomefield.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas Pock-red’ in the Hundred Rolls would not be acceptable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 478:\r\n\r\n  ‘Blanchfront’ seems to have been common, as I find it in three\r\n  distinct registers. ‘Joan Blaunkfrount,’ a nun of Molseby. (_Letters\r\n  from Northern Registers_, p. 319.) ‘Philip Blanchfront’ (F. F.),\r\n  ‘Amabil Blanchfront.’ (Fines, Ric. i.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  It was in the house of a Josias Roughead, of Bedford, that John Bunyan\r\n  was first licensed to preach in 1672.\r\n\r\nFootnote 480:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Flaxennehed’ occurs in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  ‘Antony Wiselheade’ is registered in Elizabeth’s reign in the\r\n  _Calendar to Pleadings_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 482:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Whiteheare’ was Dean of Bristol, 1551. (Barrett, _Hist.\r\n  Bristol_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 483:\r\n\r\n  ‘1522, 31 Dec. To Mr. William Farehaire, Doctor of Laws.’ (_Letters of\r\n  Fraternity_ (Durham Priory), p. 119. Surt. Soc.)\r\n\r\n  Names like ‘William Harebrown,’ ‘Ralph Lightred,’ and ‘John Litewhyte’\r\n  seem to belong to the same category with the above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 484:\r\n\r\n  Burton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, says, ‘Apollonius will have\r\n  Jason’s golden hair to be the main cause of Medea’s dotage on him.\r\n  Castor and Pollux were both yellow-haired. Homer so commends Helen,\r\n  makes Patroclus and Achilles both yellow-haired; Pulchricoma Venus,\r\n  and Cupid himself was yellow-haired.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  This sobriquet, as old as the Hundred Rolls, is found in the xviith\r\n  cent., at Durham. ‘Peter Blackbeard’ was ‘brought up for not paying\r\n  Easter reckonings, 1676.’ (_Dean Granville’s Letters_, p. 235.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  A contributor to _Notes and Queries_, Jan. 14, 1860, quotes an old\r\n  Ipswich record in which is mentioned an ‘Alexander Redberd’ dwelling\r\n  there in the early part of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Brounberd, son of William, a hostage from Galloway.’\r\n\r\n                            (_Letters from Northern Registers_, p. 163.)\r\n\r\n  ‘Janet Brounebeard’ was an inmate of St. Thomas’s Hospital, York,\r\n  February 6, 1553. (W. 11, p. 304.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  I find this name still exists as ‘Pickavant.’ It may be seen over a\r\n  boot and shoe warehouse by the Railway Station at Southport,\r\n  Lancashire. Probably ‘Pickance’ is an abbreviated form. ‘Charles, son\r\n  of Daniel and Eliza Pickance, bapt. March 26, 1754.’ (St. Ann’s,\r\n  Manchester.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 489:\r\n\r\n  Many of my readers will be familiar with the sobriquet ‘nottpated,’\r\n  which Shakespeare puts in Prince Henry’s mouth several times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n             ‘_Calvus_ protests for foes he doth not care;\r\n              For why? They cannot take from him _one hair_.’\r\n                                (_Satyrical Epigrams_, 1619.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 491:\r\n\r\n  The _Athenæum_ thinks the more manifest origin is the local ‘peel,’ a\r\n  small fortress used by Chaucer in the House of Fame—\r\n\r\n                    ‘God save the lady of this _pele_.’\r\n\r\n  I was not ignorant of the word, but as I could not find any examples\r\n  in the old rolls, I gave the preference to the nickname. I have since\r\n  met with an entry which justifies the _Athenæum’s_ remark: ‘1605, Nov.\r\n  14, Rodger of ye Peele.’ Also, ‘1621, July 10, Robarte Rodley, of ye\r\n  Peele in Chetham.’ (_Memorials of Manchester Streets_, p. 282.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 492:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Lytlehare’ occurs in a Norfolk register. Query, is it meant for\r\n  ‘Littlehair’? Probably it is. (Blomefield’s _Norfolk_.) ‘Simon\r\n  Lytehare’ (lyte = little) is found in the Parl. Writs. ‘Richard le\r\n  Herprute’ occurs in the H.R. The modern form would be ‘Hairproud.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 493:\r\n\r\n  ‘Plunket’ was in early use as a perversion of ‘blanket.’ Thus a\r\n  statute of Richard III. relating to this stuff calls it ‘plonket.’ The\r\n  form in the _Prompt. Parv._ is ‘plunket;’ and Mr. Way, commenting upon\r\n  it, quotes a line from the _Awntyrs of Arthure_—\r\n\r\n          ‘Hir belte was of plonkete, with birdis fulle baulde.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 494:\r\n\r\n  This was a nickname of Sir Thomas Woodcock, Lord Mayor of London,\r\n  1405—\r\n\r\n                  ‘Hic jacet, Tom Shorthose,\r\n                   Sine tomb, sine sheets, sine riches.’\r\n\r\n  In the neighbourhood of Belper this surname may be commonly met with.\r\n  Some change of fashion at this date, encouraged by the mayoralty,\r\n  would readily give rise to the sobriquet in the metropolis. Some\r\n  country squire or bumpkin carried the new style into Derbyshire, and\r\n  the Belper people still relate the fact of the grotesque appearance he\r\n  then made in their eyes by the nom-de-plume that as a necessary\r\n  consequence arose. ‘Sic est vita _nominum_.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 495:\r\n\r\n  ‘Agnes Blakmantyll’ (W. 11) occurs in an old York register, 1455, but\r\n  must have become obsolete with the bearer, I should imagine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 496:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Caury-Maury’ (V. 8) belongs to this class. It was a nickname\r\n  given to him on account of the exceedingly coarse cloth in which he\r\n  was attired. In Skelton’s _Elynour Rummyng_, some slatterns are thus\r\n  described—\r\n\r\n                            ‘Some loke strawry,\r\n                             Some cawry mawry.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, presentatum est quod ‘Johannes Caurymaury,’ ‘Johannes le\r\n  Fleming,’ ‘Hugo Bunting,’ ‘Isaac de Stanford,’ et Lucas de eadem\r\n  consueti fuerunt currere cum canibus suis sine warento,’ etc.\r\n  (_Chronicon Petroburgense. Cam. Soc._, p. 138.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 497:\r\n\r\n  This may be local.\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  We all remember in ‘_Love’s Labour’s Lost_’ how Armado, being pressed\r\n  to fight, refuses to undress, and says: ‘The naked truth of it is, I\r\n  have no shirt; I go woolward for penance.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 499:\r\n\r\n  One feels much tempted to add ‘Roylance’ to this list. It certainly\r\n  has a most kingly aspect. Still there can be little doubt that it is\r\n  but a corruption of ‘Rylands.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 500:\r\n\r\n  I need not stay to point out the early familiar use of ‘yard’ as a\r\n  stick or staff of any length. In Wicklyffe’s New Testament we find the\r\n  following:—‘And he seide to hem nothing take ye in the weye—neither\r\n  yerde, ne scrippe, neither breed, ne money.’ (Luke ix. 3.) Our\r\n  Authorized Version still preserves the meteyard from obsoletism: ‘Ye\r\n  shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in\r\n  measure.’ (Lev. xix. 35.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 501:\r\n\r\n  The horn was carried by the watchman as well as the huntsman and the\r\n  cryer. ‘Henry Watchorn’ was mayor of Leicester in 1780, and the name\r\n  occurs in the Nottingham Directory for 1864. Other compounds besides\r\n  ‘Waghorn’ are ‘Crookhorn,’ ‘Cramphorn’ (_i.e._, crooked horn),\r\n  ‘Langhorn’ and ‘Whitehorn.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 502:\r\n\r\n  It was a Captain Waghorn who was tried by court-martial for the wreck\r\n  of the _Royal George_, which went down off Portsmouth in 1782. He was\r\n  acquitted, however.\r\n\r\nFootnote 503:\r\n\r\n  ‘Anne, daughter of Hugh and Elizabeth Shakeshaft, baptized Dec. 6,\r\n  1744.’ (St. Ann’s, Register, Manchester.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 504:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robert Go-before’ in the Rolls of Parl. is an evident sobriquet\r\n  affixed upon some official of this class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Swyrdebrake,’ alias ‘John Taillour.’\r\n\r\n                (_Materials for Hist. Henry VII._, p. 441.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  In a list of bankrupts, dated the thirteenth year of Elizabeth, and\r\n  quoted in _Notes and Queries_, Jan. 1860, occurs an ‘Anthony\r\n  Halstaffe,’ doubtless originally ‘Halestaffe,’ from ‘hale,’ to drag,\r\n  and thus a likely sobriquet for a catchpoll or bailiff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  In the biographical notice appended to Archbishop Sandys’ Sermons,\r\n  published by the Parker Society, we find that one of his friends was\r\n  called ‘Hurlestone.’ This will be of similar origin with ‘Hurlebat.’\r\n  (pp. 13, 14.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas Crakyshield’ was Rector of North Creak in Norfolk in the year\r\n  1412. (_Hist. Norfolk_, vii. 77.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 509:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Ryghtwys’ was Vicar of Fouldon in 1497. (Blomefield’s\r\n  _Norfolk_.) ‘Upright’ appeared in a trial at Exeter in October 1874.\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  ‘Make’ was a familiar compound. ‘Joan Make-peace’ was sister to Henry\r\n  III., and so named by the Scotch through her betrowal to their\r\n  monarch, by which peace was brought about. Bishop Hall uses the\r\n  opposite for a quarrelsome fellow—\r\n\r\n             ‘If brabbling Makefray, at each faire and ’size,\r\n              Picks quarrels for to show his valiantise.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Julian Make-blisse’ and ‘John Make-blythe’ occur in two separate\r\n  rolls, and Mr. Lower mentions a ‘Maud Make-joy’ in an old Wardrobe\r\n  Account: ‘1297, Dec. 26. To Maud Make-joy for dancing before Edward\r\n  Prince of Wales, at Ipswich, 2_s._’ Here the sobriquet is adopted in\r\n  compliment to the profession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Hardmans’ are but a corruption of ‘Hardyman.’ John Hardyman,\r\n  D.D., was installed prebend of Chester in June, 1563. (Ormerod’s\r\n  _Cheshire_, vol. i. p. 223.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 512:\r\n\r\n  ‘Reginald Littleprowe’ was Mayor of Norwich in 1532, and ‘John\r\n  Littleproud’ was buried at ‘Attleburgh’ in 1619. (_Hist. Norf._, iii.\r\n  219, and i. 535.) This sobriquet, I doubt not, was in sarcastic\r\n  allusion to the haughty demeanour of its first possessor. As in so\r\n  many cases, however, there seems to have been no objection to its\r\n  acceptance on the part of his posterity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 513:\r\n\r\n  ‘Oswin Sharparrow’ (W. 3), ‘John Sharparrow’ (W. 2), ‘William\r\n  Sharparrow’ (W. 11). The original nominee was probably of a sarcastic\r\n  turn. The following inscription was once to be seen in York Minster:\r\n  ‘Orate pro anima dom. Johannis Sharparrowe, quondam parsone in Eccles.\r\n  Cath. Ebor., qui obiit xxv. die Oct. an. 1411.’ (Drake’s _Eboracum_,\r\n  p. 498.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 514:\r\n\r\n  ‘Deliver’ as an adjective meant ‘nimble,’ ‘lithe.’ It was familiarly\r\n  used. Chaucer has ‘deliverly,’ ‘deliverness,’ and ‘deliver.’ Of the\r\n  young squier he says—\r\n\r\n              ‘Of his stature he was of even lengthe,\r\n               And wonderly deliver, and great of strengthe.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Ralph le Delivre’ is found in the Rot. Curiæ Regis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 515:\r\n\r\n  The names of ‘Thomas le Busteler’ (F.F.) and ‘Robert le Bustler’ (T.)\r\n  are less complimentary than most of the above. ‘Nicholas le Medler’\r\n  (A.) would be quite as objectionable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 516:\r\n\r\n  ‘Craske, fryke of fatte,’ _i.e._, lusty, fresh. (_Pr. Par._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 517:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Curtevalur’ (A.) would seem to have had an instinctive\r\n  acquaintance with the moral of that couplet which asserts that\r\n\r\n                    ‘He who fights and runs away\r\n                     Shall live to fight another day.’\r\n\r\n  There are a good many people, I fancy, who thus ‘take thought for the\r\n  morrow.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  Fr. Preux = valiant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  ‘Simon Stallworthe’ is mentioned in the _Grants of Edward the Fifth_.\r\n  (Cam. Soc.) The modern form of the term colloquially used is\r\n  ‘stalwart.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  ‘Arthur Purefoy’ or ‘Purefaye’ was Rector of Redenhall in 1584.\r\n  (_Hist. Norf._, v. 363.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 521:\r\n\r\n  Thus Archbishop Sandys commences a sermon at Paul’s Cross:—‘The\r\n  Apostle St. Peter, like a perfit workman and a skilful builder, first\r\n  layeth a sure foundation.’ (_Parker Soc._, p. 386.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 522:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas Bontemps’ appears in a Norfolk register of the fourteenth\r\n  century. (_Hist. Norfolk_, Index.) It seems somewhat analogous to the\r\n  now familiar ‘Bonheur.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 523:\r\n\r\n  The son and successor of Charlemagne, Louis First, went by the\r\n  sobriquet of ‘le Debonnaire,’ on account of his courteous and affable\r\n  character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas Gentilhomme’ in the Writs of Paul represents the Norman-French\r\n  form. The surname still exists in France, as does ‘Gentleman’ in\r\n  England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  Akin to ‘Malcolm le Musard’ (M.) was ‘Alan le Mute’ (A.). ‘Henry\r\n  Duceparole’ (T.) or ‘Richard Parlebien’ (M.) is decidedly\r\n  complimentary, but ‘William Spekelital’ (P.) would seem to have been\r\n  morose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  ‘John Strictman’ (A.) and ‘John le Severe’ (A.) may be set here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  _The Babees’ Book_ (Early Eng. Text. Soc.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  ‘Every midwyfe shulde be presented with honest women of great gravity\r\n  to the Bysshop,’ for she ‘shulde be a sadde woman, wyse and discrete,\r\n  having experience.’ (Andrew Boorde.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  The Hundred Rolls give us a ‘Robert le Sotele.’ ‘Salomon le Sotel’ was\r\n  Sheriff of London in 1290, according to Stow. There is no reason to\r\n  suppose that either of these was distinguished for any of the\r\n  unpleasant features that often belong to sharp characteristics.\r\n\r\nFootnote 530:\r\n\r\n  The Issue Roll gives us an opposite characteristic in ‘Thomas\r\n  Litilskill.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 531:\r\n\r\n  ‘Christopher Greynhorne’ (W. 15) would represent the modern sense of\r\n  this word.\r\n\r\nFootnote 532:\r\n\r\n  There used to be an old proverb—\r\n\r\n         ‘Whylst grasse doth growe oft sterves the seely steede.’\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Dyce’s notes to ‘All’s Well that Ends Well.’ (_Shakespeare’s\r\n  Works_, vol. iii. p. 288.) One of the best illustrations of this word,\r\n  however, is to be met with in Foxe’s _Martyrology_, where, describing\r\n  the martyrdom of a young child not seven years old, he says: ‘The\r\n  captain, perceiving the child invincible and himself vanquished,\r\n  committed the silly soul, the blessed babe, the child uncherished, to\r\n  the stinking prison.’ (Vol. i. p. 126, Edit. 1844.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 533:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Selybarn (_i.e._ Silly-child) occurs in the York Guild. (W.\r\n  11.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 534:\r\n\r\n  Joyce may belong either to the nickname or the baptismal class.\r\n  ‘Richard le Joyce,’ J., ‘Joyce Faukes,’ H., ‘Joice Frankline,’ W. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Gladchere’ (‘Gladcheer’) (F.F.) would be a pleasant\r\n  sobriquet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  ‘Alicia Blissewenche’ occurs in the Hundred Rolls—a light-hearted\r\n  ruddy-faced country girl of happy disposition and blithe expression. I\r\n  doubt not he was a lucky swain who got her to go to the priest with\r\n  him to sue wedlock. Cf. ‘Jeffery Joyemaiden’ in the same record.\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  The early ‘John Bellewether’ (H.) may be either a partial translation\r\n  of this, or that which is more likely, a sobriquet taken from the\r\n  custom of fastening a bell around the neck of the leading sheep, by\r\n  which to conduct the rest. We still term such an one the\r\n  ‘bell-wether.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 538:\r\n\r\n  We never use ‘merry’ now in relation to sacred things, though our\r\n  English Bible does. The fact is, the word has somewhat sunk in the\r\n  social scale. Few preachers would say, as Bishop Bradford could say\r\n  quite naturally in his day, ‘The Lord for Christ’s sake give us merry\r\n  hearts to drink lustily of His sweet cup.’ A monument in Marshfield\r\n  Church on A. Meredeth ends thus —\r\n\r\n            ‘Judge then, what he did lose who lost but breath,\r\n             Lived to die well, and dyed A MEREDETH.\r\n                                 (Rudder’s _Gloucestershire_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 539:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sweetlove’ is met by ‘Duzamour;’ ‘Felicia Duzamour’ occurs in the\r\n  Domesday, St. Paul’s (Cam. Soc.). ‘Dulcia Fynamour’ is set down in the\r\n  _Wardrobe Accounts_ Ed. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 540:\r\n\r\n  ‘Wooer,’ and even ‘Wooeress,’ seem to have existed. ‘John le Wower’\r\n  (A.), ‘Hugh le Wewer’ (R.), ‘Emma Woweres’ (A.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 541:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ralph Full-of-Love’ was Rector of West Lynn in the year 1462. (_Hist.\r\n  of Norfolk_, vol. viii. p. 536.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 542:\r\n\r\n  ‘Well beloved’ was the usual term applied in any formal address in the\r\n  Middle Ages, such as when a king in council made any public\r\n  announcement, or when a priest addressed his people, or when a\r\n  testator mentioned a legatee. It was then a perfectly familiar\r\n  expression, and would easily affix itself as a sobriquet. A Rev. C.\r\n  Wellbeloved published a translation of the Bible in 1838, printed by\r\n  Smallfield and Co., London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sweet’ and its compounds, however, are most probably to be referred\r\n  to our baptismal nomenclature. A ‘Swet le Bone’ is found in the\r\n  Hundred Rolls, and in the same record occur such other forms as\r\n  ‘Swetman fil. Edith’ and ‘Sweteman Textor.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n  In All Saints Church, Hertford, exists or existed a tablet with an\r\n  inscription dated 1428, beginning thus—\r\n\r\n            ‘Here lyeth under this stone William Wake,\r\n            And by him Joane his wife and make.’\r\n            (Clutterbuck’s _Hertfordshire_, vol. ii., p. 165.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  ‘Prudens’ should more properly, perhaps, be placed among abstract\r\n  virtues. ‘Richard Prudence’ F.F. Later on it became a baptismal\r\n  name—‘Prudence Howell.’ (Proceedings in Chancery: Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 546:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Merricocke’ (F.F.) was evidently a jovial fellow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 547:\r\n\r\n  ‘Parramore’ is always found as ‘Paramour’ in early rolls, and in this\r\n  form existed till the xviith century. ‘April 18, 1635, Whitehall.\r\n  Captain Thomas Paramour appointed to the _Adventure_.’ State Papers,\r\n  1635 (Domestic).\r\n\r\nFootnote 548:\r\n\r\n  It was a favourite joke some few years ago in the House of Commons to\r\n  say that there were in it two Lemons and but one Peel. While Sir\r\n  Robert Peel was Irish Secretary, from 1812 to 1818, and was somewhat\r\n  remarkable in that capacity for his opposition to the Roman Catholics,\r\n  it was customary to style him by the sobriquet of ‘Orange Peel.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 549:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lyare, or gabbare—mendax, mendosus.’ (_Prompt. Parv._) ‘Henry le\r\n  Liere’ (H.R.) speaks for himself, unless he _belies_ himself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 550:\r\n\r\n  Like ‘Gabelot,’ ‘Hamelot,’ ‘Hughelot,’ ‘Crestelot,’ etc., ‘Gibelot’\r\n  may be a diminutive, in which case ‘Gilbert’ will be the root, and the\r\n  name will belong to the patronymic class. (_Vide_ p. 16, note 1.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  A ‘William Gidyheved’ (Giddyhead) is mentioned by Mr. Riley as living\r\n  in London in the xivth century. (X. index.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 552:\r\n\r\n  In the _Pr. Par._, ‘Gybelot’ (or Gyglot) is rendered ‘ridax.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 553:\r\n\r\n  Teetotalism was not without its representatives—‘Thomas le Sober’\r\n  (M.), ‘Richard Drynkewatere’ (M.), ‘John Drinkewater’ (A.). There is\r\n  no proof for Camden’s statement that this is a corruption of\r\n  Derwentwater. From the earliest days it appears in its present dress.\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  ‘Memorandum, quod die sancti Leonardi, fecit Galfridus Dringkedregges\r\n  de Ubbethorp homagium.’ (V. 8, p. 151.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 555:\r\n\r\n  ‘Thomas Sourale’ (A.) is met by ‘John Sweteale,’ a member of St.\r\n  George’s Guild, Norwich (V.). The former, I doubt not, was a crabbed\r\n  peevish fellow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 556:\r\n\r\n  ‘Simon le Chuffere’ occurs in the H.R. This was a common term of\r\n  opprobrium for a miser. As ‘Chuffer’ it is found in the _Townley\r\n  Mysteries_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 557:\r\n\r\n  ‘The wife of Mr. Turnpenny, newsagent, Leeds, was yesterday delivered\r\n  of two sons and one daughter, all of whom are doing well (_Manchester\r\n  Evening News_, July 1, 1873.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 558:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Taylemayle’ is found in the _Chronicon Petroburgense_. (Cam.\r\n  Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  We may also mention ‘Gilbert le Covetiose’ (M.) and ‘Robert\r\n  Would-have.’ We still say ‘much would have more.’ ‘Robert Would-have,\r\n  sergeant-at-mace, witness in trial before the Mayor of Newcastle,\r\n  March 23, 1662.’ (W. 16.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 560:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Rakestraw’ reminds us of ‘Piers Plowman’s ‘ratoner and rakyer\r\n  of Cheape,’ _i.e._, ratcatcher and scavenger of Cheapside. A still\r\n  more objectionable name was that of ‘Adam Ketmongere’ (H.R.), Ket =\r\n  filth, carrion. ‘Honorius le Rumonjour’ (Rummager) (N.) would seem to\r\n  have followed a similar calling. These sobriquets would readily be\r\n  affixed upon men of a penurious and scraping character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 561:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Wildeblood’ is found in a Yorkshire Roll (W. 9), and ‘Jordan\r\n  Kite-wilde’ in the H.R.\r\n\r\nFootnote 562:\r\n\r\n  Also ‘Agnes Gyngyvere’ in Riley’s _Memorials of London_.

(_Dean Granville’s Letters_, p. 225.) ‘William Cammille’ (V.\r\n  4), ‘George Camil’ (W. 20).\r\n\r\nFootnote 567:\r\n\r\n  ‘1438.’ “Item, pro aula ‘Olefante,’ Magister Kyllynworth.” (_Mun.\r\n  Acad. Oxon._ p. 522.) This hall or smaller college was so called from\r\n  the sign over the door. Skelton has both ‘olyfant’ and ‘olyphante.’ He\r\n  describes a woman in ‘Eleanor Rummyng’ as\r\n\r\n                         ‘Necked lyke an olyfant.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  ‘Herveus de Lyons,’ C., ‘Richard de Lyouns,’ M.\r\n\r\nFootnote 569:\r\n\r\n  It was ‘Hugues le Loup’ the Conqueror appointed Second Count of the\r\n  Cheshire Palatinate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  ‘Lovel’ is the diminutive. ‘Maulovel’ will thus be ‘Bad-wolfkin.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  A Rascal was a lean, ragged deer; Shakespeare so uses it. Very early,\r\n  however, the term was applied to the vulgar _herd_ of human kind, but\r\n  with far less opprobious meaning than now. Hall, quoting Henry of\r\n  Northumberland, speaks of Henry IV. as having obtained his crown ‘by\r\n  the counsaill of thy frendes, and by open noising of the rascale\r\n  people’ (f. xxi.), _i.e._ the rabble. An extract from the Ordinances\r\n  of Henry VIII. at Eltham says, ‘It is ordained that none of the\r\n  sergeants at arms, heralds ... have, retain, or bring into the court\r\n  any boyes or rascalles, nor also other of their servants.’ The surname\r\n  was very common, and lasted a long time—‘John Raskele’ (H.), ‘Henry\r\n  Rascall’ (Z.). Robert Rascal was persecuted for his religion in 1517\r\n  (Foxe). ‘Received for a pewe in the lower end of the churche set to\r\n  Richard Rascalle, vi_s._’ (Ludlow Churchwardens’ Accounts, Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  As we have Cock and Cockerell, Duck and Duckrell, so we have Buck and\r\n  Buckerell—‘Peter Bokerel’ (A.), ‘Matthew Bokerel’ (A.). Cf. Mackarel\r\n  and Pickerell.\r\n\r\nFootnote 573:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes this is local, and a mere corruption of Beauvoir—‘Roger de\r\n  Belvoir’ (M.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 574:\r\n\r\n  ‘Duncalf’ may be seen over a window in Oldham Road, Manchester.\r\n  ‘William Duncalf’ (A.A. 1), ‘John Duncalf’ (A.A. 1).\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  Such names as Roger Runcy, Richard Palefray, John Portehors, or Ralph\r\n  Portehos represent terms very familiar to our forefathers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 576:\r\n\r\n  This word ‘beef’ as denotive of the living animal was in vogue in the\r\n  seventeenth century at least. The plural ‘beeves’ is still to be found\r\n  in our Authorized Version. For instance, Levit. xxii. 19, is\r\n  translated, ‘Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of\r\n  the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.’ Shakespeare, also, has the\r\n  word in this sense. He speaks in his ‘Merchant of Venice’ of the—\r\n\r\n                   ‘Flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.’\r\n\r\n  We have here mutton used in the same manner. Edward the Second was\r\n  accustomed ‘to breede upp beeves and motonnes in his parkes to serve\r\n  his household.’ (_Liber Niger_, Ed. IV.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 577:\r\n\r\n  Apart from such entries as ‘William le Lamb,’ we find a ‘John\r\n  Lambgrome’ in the Hundred Rolls. Though obsolete, we must set him by\r\n  our ‘Shepherds.’ A brother-in-law of John Wesley bore the name of\r\n  ‘Whitelamb.’ I am not sure whether this surname has died out or not.\r\n  In the _Visitation of Yorkshire_, 1665, it is found in the person of\r\n  ‘Isabel Whitlamb.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  ‘Robert Spichfat’ (X.), ‘William Spichfat’ (W. 11.), from the old\r\n  ‘spic,’ bacon, seem to refer to the greasy habits of their owners.\r\n\r\nFootnote 579:\r\n\r\n  Christopher Pigg was Mayor of Lynn Regis in 1742.\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  An old political poem says the Italians bring in\r\n\r\n               ‘Apes and japes and mamusetts taylede,\r\n                Nifles, trifles, that litelle have avayled.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  _Raton_ is still the term in the North. Langland uses it, and in\r\n  Chaucer the Potecary is asked by a purchaser—\r\n\r\n              ‘That he him would sell\r\n               Some poison, that he might his ratouns quell.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 582:\r\n\r\n  ‘Some bileve that yf the kite or the puttock fle ovir the way afore\r\n  them that they should fare wel that daye, for sumtyme they have\r\n  farewele after that they see the puttock so fleyinge.’ (_Brand_, iii.\r\n  113.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  Our present Authorized Version retains the term in Deut. xiv. 13,\r\n  where mention is made of ‘the glede, and the kite, and the vulture\r\n  after his kind.’ Locally it is found in ‘Gledhill’ and ‘Gladstone,’ or\r\n  more correctly ‘Gledstane,’ that is, the hill or crag which the kites\r\n  were wont to frequent. A ‘William de Gledstanys’ is met with in the\r\n  Coldingham Priory Records of the date of 1357, proving its North\r\n  English origin. ‘Hawkstone’ and ‘Gladstone’ are thus synonymous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 584:\r\n\r\n  ‘Richard Sparhawke’ was Rector of Fincham in 1534. (_Hist. Norf._,\r\n  vii. 358.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  ‘Philip Chikin’ (A.), ‘John Chikin’ (A.). The name existed in the\r\n  xviith cent., for one ‘George Chicken’ was summoned at Ryton ‘for not\r\n  payeing his assessments, July 28, 1673.’ (_Dean Granville’s Letters_,\r\n  Sur. Soc.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  ‘Peter le Goos,’ F.F., ‘Walter le Gows,’ A., ‘Amicia le Gos,’ J.,\r\n  ‘John le Gos,’ M. The latter, as ‘Goss,’ is the present most common\r\n  form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  This is as often from Joscelyn. ‘Gosceline fil. Gawyn,’ A., ‘Roger\r\n  fil. Gocelin,’ A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  A tablet with the inscription ‘Sacred to the Memory of Priscilla\r\n  Blackbird’ has been put up in Stepney churchyard within the last few\r\n  years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  ‘The bailiffs and commons granted to Robert Popingeay, their fellow\r\n  citizen, all their tenement and garden in the Parish of St. Mary in\r\n  the Marsh.’ 1371.

As with Oliphant,\r\n  over-corpulence would give rise to the sobriquet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  ‘Reymund Heryng’ (M.). The diminutive is found in the case of ‘Stephen\r\n  Harengot’ (D.D.), _i.e._, ‘Little Herring.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  ‘Elizabeth Salmon’ (G.). _It is said_, a Mr. Salmon having been\r\n  presented by his wife with three boys at one birth, gave them the\r\n  names of ‘Pickled,’ ‘Potted,’ and ‘Fresh.’ I would call the reader’s\r\n  attention to the italicised words that preface the statement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 595:\r\n\r\n  Daniel Turbot was summoned ‘for not paying Easter reckonyngs, Aug.\r\n  23rd, 1674.’ (_Granville’s Letters._ Sur.

Tenche is the name of one of the yeomen of the\r\n  Guard to Queen Mary when Princess Mary. (_Priv. Purse Exp._ 1543.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Spratt was Bishop of Rochester in 1688.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  This is doubtless but a feminine form of Odo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  ‘Roger le Waps’ is found in a Sussex subsidy roll of 1296. (Lower, i.\r\n  242.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  In Ricart’s _Kalendar of Bristol_ (Cam. Soc.), William and Robert\r\n  Snake are set down among the earlier ‘Prepositi.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  In 1433 it had got corrupted into ‘Querdling,’ a ‘Thomas Querdling’\r\n  occupying an official position in Norwich in that year. Of him the\r\n  following rhyme speaks—\r\n\r\n                     ‘Whoso have any quarrel or pie,\r\n                      If he but withstand John Hankey,\r\n            John Querdlyng, Nic Waleys, John Belagh, John Meg,\r\n                    Sore shall him rewe\r\n            For they rule all the court with their lawes newe.’\r\n                                        (Blomefield, iii. 145.)\r\n\r\n  I doubt not ‘Curling’ is the modern representative of this name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  This name is not obsolete. Mr. Lower quotes a local rhyme thus—\r\n\r\n                   ‘Worthing is a pretty place,\r\n                   And if I’m not mistaken,\r\n                   If you can’t get any butcher’s meat,\r\n                   There’s “hogs’ flesh” and “bacon.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  ‘William Wolfheryng’ occurs in a Sussex subsidy roll, 1296. (Lower, i.\r\n  242.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  ‘Joan Blackdam’ occurs in _Hist. Norfolk_. (Blomefield, v. Index.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  ‘Anna Hellicate’ was called before the Archdeacon of Durham, for not\r\n  coming to the Church, 27th July, 1673.’ (_Dean Granville’s Letters_,\r\n  Surt. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  This most curious name appears in the _Manchester Directory_ for 1861.\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  This seems to have been a surname—‘John Drawlace’ (W. 18).\r\n\r\nFootnote 609:\r\n\r\n  The President of the College of Physicians in 1665 was Sir Francis\r\n  Prujean. Bramston, in his _Autobiography_ (Cam. Soc.), styles him\r\n  ‘Prugean.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 610:\r\n\r\n  The newspapers for June 6th, 1874, mention a ‘Mr. Youngjohn’ in\r\n  connection with an election petition at Kidderminster.\r\n\r\nFootnote 611:\r\n\r\n  We have already noticed that ‘Robin Hood’ had become in itself a\r\n  surname. It is quite possible our ‘Little-johns’ have arisen in a\r\n  similar manner. Little John, I need not say, was as carefully\r\n  represented at the May-day dance as Robin himself or Maid Marian.\r\n  Ritson has preserved us a rhyme on the subject—\r\n\r\n             ‘This infant was called John Little,’ quoth he\r\n               ‘Which name shall be changed anon;\r\n              The words we’ll transpose, so wherever he goes,\r\n               His name shall be called “Little John.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 612:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, to Guillam de Vait, Guillam de Trope, and Pety John\r\n  mynstralles, iv_l._’ (_Trevelyan Papers_, ii. 20. Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 613:\r\n\r\n  We might be tempted to place our ‘Brownbills’ here, but I have\r\n  recently shown them to be representative of the old and famous pikes\r\n  known as ‘brownbills,’ used so commonly in war previous to the\r\n  introduction of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nFootnote 614:\r\n\r\n  Thus Desdemona says to Emilia (_Othello_, iv. 3)—\r\n\r\n                     ‘This Lodovico is a proper man;’\r\n\r\n  and the latter responds—\r\n\r\n                          ‘A very handsome man.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 615:\r\n\r\n  ‘Apple-john’ must be looked upon as a nickname taken from the fruit of\r\n  that name. An apple-john was a species of apple which was never fully\r\n  ripe till late in the season, when it was shrivelled. Hence\r\n  Shakespeare’s allusion in 2 Henry IV. ii. 4. ‘Sweet-apple’ will belong\r\n  to this category.\r\n\r\nFootnote 616:\r\n\r\n  ‘Full-James’ must be looked upon as a corruption of Foljambe. I prefer\r\n  the original, though that is not complimentary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 617:\r\n\r\n  This name lingered on till 1674 at least, for one of the private\r\n  musicians attached to the household of Charles II. was ‘John\r\n  Godegroome.’ (_Vide_ Chappell’s _Ballad Literature_, p. 469.) ‘Robert\r\n  le Godegrom’ had appeared three centuries before in the Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 618:\r\n\r\n  ‘King’ I have already suggested as a sobriquet given to one who\r\n  represented such a rank in some mediæval pageant. Peculiarities of\r\n  stature, manner, or dress would readily give rise to the compound\r\n  forms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 619:\r\n\r\n  Archbishop Chichele, when founding All Souls’ College, purchased for\r\n  this purpose the sites of ‘Beresford’s Hall, St. Thomas’s Hall,\r\n  Tyngewyck Hall, and Godknave Hall.’ (_Hist. Univ. Oxon_, vol. i. p.\r\n  195.)\r\n\r\n  Probably its founder bore that name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 620:\r\n\r\n  ‘Godfrey Mauclerk’ was mayor of Leicester in 1286. Also, ‘Walter\r\n  Malclerk’ (P.P.). Corrupted into ‘Manclerk,’ this name still exists.\r\n  (Cf. _Clerical Directory_, 1874.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 621:\r\n\r\n  ‘Johan le Redeclerk, hosier de Coventry.’ (V. 9, p. xxiv.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 622:\r\n\r\n  The first ‘Littlepage’ I can light upon is in the case of ‘John\r\n  Littlepage’ and ‘Joan Littlepage,’ persecuted for their religion in\r\n  1521. (Foxe’s _Martyrology_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 623:\r\n\r\n  ‘Man’ in the sense of servant is found appended to several Christian\r\n  names. Thus we come across such combinations as ‘Mathewman,’\r\n  ‘Harriman,’ and ‘Thomasman.’ The wonder is more are not to be met\r\n  with. The customary way of registering servants in the old rolls is\r\n  ‘William Matthew’s man,’ or ‘John’s man Thomas.’ Thus the surname\r\n  arose. The _Proceedings in Kent_, 1640 (Cam. Soc.), contained the name\r\n  of ‘Nicholas Hodgman,’ and ‘John Hobman’ was buried May 17th, 1649.\r\n  (_Smith’s Obituary._ Cam. Soc.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 624:\r\n\r\n  ‘Grant to Henry Goodclerk for his services in the parts beyond the\r\n  sea, 23rd Sep. 1485.’ (_Materials for Hist. Henry VII._, p. 557.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 625:\r\n\r\n  ‘Goodwife’ seems to have existed formerly. A ‘William Goodwyfe’ was\r\n  Rector of Stapleford, Herts, in 1443. (Clutterbuck’s _Hertfordshire_,\r\n  vol. ii. p. 218.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 626:\r\n\r\n  ‘Alan Bondame’ represents the feminine (P.P.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 627:\r\n\r\n  John Beaufitz was Sheriff of Warwick in 1485.\r\n\r\nFootnote 628:\r\n\r\n  A curious circumstance happened, I believe, but a few years ago,\r\n  causing the increase of a forename, unintended, we may feel sure, by\r\n  those most immediately concerned. A child was taken to church to be\r\n  baptized. The clergyman at the usual place turned to the mother and\r\n  asked what name the infant was to bear. ‘Robert,’ was the reply. ‘Any\r\n  other name?’ he inquired. ‘Robert honly,’ she answered, her grammar\r\n  not being of the best description. ‘Robert Honly, I baptize thee, in\r\n  the name,’ etc., at once continued the clergyman, and the child was\r\n  therefore duly so registered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 629:\r\n\r\n  A ‘Savage Bear’ was at large in Kent a few years ago. (Lower i. 177.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 630:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ivory Malet’ (D.D.) This, though registered in the xiiith, would seem\r\n  to have anticipated the croquet of the xixth cent. ‘Ivray’ was a\r\n  baptismal name at the earlier date.\r\n\r\nFootnote 631:\r\n\r\n  ‘More Fortune, bayliff of St. Martin’s, died May 17th, 1367.’\r\n  (_Smith’s Obituary_, p. 13.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 632:\r\n\r\n  ‘May 27th, 1805. River, son of River and Rebecca Jordan.’\r\n  (_Christenings_, St. Ann’s, Manchester.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 633:\r\n\r\n  Several ‘Pine Coffins’ may be seen in the Clerical Directories of\r\n  1840–1850.\r\n\r\nFootnote 634:\r\n\r\n  ‘Jean Gottam,’ the Frenchman’s title for ‘John Bull,’ is old. A\r\n  witness in the trial of Joan of Arc used the term ‘Godon,’ and\r\n  explained it to be a sobriquet of the English from their use of the\r\n  oath ‘God damn.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 635:\r\n\r\n  A clever article in the _Edinburgh Review_, April 1855, suggests\r\n  ‘Blood’ and ‘Death’ from ‘S’Blood’ and ‘S’Death,’ the abbreviated\r\n  ‘God’s blood’ and ‘God’s death.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 636:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ page 160. Camden says the Normans were so called because ‘at\r\n  every other word they would swear _by God_.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  ‘Henry Godsalve’ entered C.C. Coll. Cam. in 1614. (_Masters’ Hist._,\r\n  C.C. Coll.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, to Jannett God-send-us, I give a caldron, and a pare of\r\n  tonges.’ (Extract of will of William Hardinge, Vicar of Heightington,\r\n  1584. W. 13.) The editor suggests she was a foundling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 639:\r\n\r\n  The _Saturday Review_, in a criticism of my book, mentions a Rogerus\r\n  Deus-salvet-dominas in the Essex Domesday.\r\n\r\nFootnote 640:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mr. Gracedieu, Incumbent of St. James’s, Duke’s Place.’ (Strype,\r\n  London.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 641:\r\n\r\n  A curious heraldic name is found in the 17th cent. John Poyndexter,\r\n  fellow of Exeter Coll., Oxford, was dispossessed. (Walker, _Sufferings\r\n  of the Clergy_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 642:\r\n\r\n  Our ‘Olyfadres’ will similarly be the expletive ‘Holy-father,’ unless,\r\n  like ‘Thomas Worthship’ (Z.), the name be but a title of respect to\r\n  some ecclesiastic functionary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 643:\r\n\r\n  ‘Good-speed’ may belong to the same class as Swift, Golightly,\r\n  Lightfoot, Roefoot, etc.—V. p. 388.\r\n\r\nFootnote 644:\r\n\r\n  The Constable of Nottingham Castle in 1369 was one Stephen Rummelowe,\r\n  or Rumbilowe, for both forms are to be found.\r\n\r\nFootnote 645:\r\n\r\n  ‘Fulco Twelvepence’ was perhaps related to ‘Robert Shillyng,’ found in\r\n  the ‘Patent Rolls’ (State Paper Office).\r\n\r\nFootnote 646:\r\n\r\n  A most anachronistic name is met with in the ‘Calend. Inquis. Post\r\n  Mortem,’ 30 Henry VI., in the entry ‘Robert Banknott.’ A ‘knot’ was a\r\n  small local prominence. On the bank or side of this the nominee\r\n  doubtless dwelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ There are many instances of words and names that are hyphenated in\r\n      the body of the book, but not in the index.
