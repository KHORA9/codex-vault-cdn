MAYHEW                   To face the Title Page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present volume is the first of an intended series, which it is\r\nhoped will form, when complete, a cyclopædia of the industry, the want,\r\nand the vice of the great Metropolis.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the book is curious for many reasons:\r\n\r\nIt surely may be considered curious as being the first attempt\r\nto publish the history of a people, from the lips of the people\r\nthemselves--giving a literal description of their labour, their\r\nearnings, their trials, and their sufferings, in their own\r\n“unvarnished” language; and to pourtray the condition of their homes\r\nand their families by personal observation of the places, and direct\r\ncommunion with the individuals.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered curious also as being the first commission\r\nof inquiry into the state of the people, undertaken by a private\r\nindividual, and the first “blue book” ever published in twopenny\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, moreover, as supplying information concerning a large\r\nbody of persons, of whom the public had less knowledge than of the most\r\ndistant tribes of the earth--the government population returns not even\r\nnumbering them among the inhabitants of the kingdom; and as adducing\r\nfacts so extraordinary, that the traveller in the undiscovered country\r\nof the poor must, like Bruce, until his stories are corroborated by\r\nafter investigators, be content to lie under the imputation of telling\r\nsuch tales, as travellers are generally supposed to delight in.\r\n\r\nBe the faults of the present volume what they may, assuredly they\r\nare rather short-comings than exaggerations, for in every instance\r\nthe author and his coadjutors have sought to understate, and most\r\nassuredly never to exceed the truth. For the omissions, the author\r\nwould merely remind the reader of the entire novelty of the task--there\r\nbeing no other similar work in the language by which to guide or\r\ncheck his inquiries. When the following leaves are turned over, and\r\nthe two or three pages of information derived from books contrasted\r\nwith the hundreds of pages of facts obtained by positive observation\r\nand investigation, surely some allowance will be made for the details\r\nwhich may still be left for others to supply. Within the last two years\r\nsome thousands of the humbler classes of society must have been seen\r\nand visited with the especial view of noticing their condition and\r\nlearning their histories; and it is but right that the truthfulness of\r\nthe poor generally should be made known; for though checks have been\r\nusually adopted, the people have been mostly found to be astonishingly\r\ncorrect in their statements,--so much so indeed, that the attempts at\r\ndeception are certainly the exceptions rather than the rule. Those\r\npersons who, from an ignorance of the simplicity of the honest poor,\r\nmight be inclined to think otherwise, have, in order to be convinced\r\nof the justice of the above remarks, only to consult the details given\r\nin the present volume, and to perceive the extraordinary agreement in\r\nthe statements of all the vast number of individuals who have been seen\r\nat different times, and who cannot possibly have been supposed to have\r\nbeen acting in concert.\r\n\r\nThe larger statistics, such as those of the quantities of fish and\r\nfruit, &c., sold in London, have been collected from tradesmen\r\nconnected with the several markets, or from the wholesale merchants\r\nbelonging to the trade specified--gentlemen to whose courtesy and\r\nco-operation I am indebted for much valuable information, and whose\r\nnames, were I at liberty to publish them, would be an indisputable\r\nguarantee for the facts advanced. The other statistics have been\r\nobtained in the same manner--the best authorities having been\r\ninvariably consulted on the subject treated of.\r\n\r\nIt is right that I should make special mention of the assistance I have\r\nreceived in the compilation of the present volume from Mr. HENRY WOOD\r\nand Mr. RICHARD KNIGHT (late of the City Mission), gentlemen who have\r\nbeen engaged with me from nearly the commencement of my inquiries, and\r\nto whose hearty co-operation both myself and the public are indebted\r\nfor a large increase of knowledge. Mr. Wood, indeed, has contributed so\r\nlarge a proportion of the contents of the present volume that he may\r\nfairly be considered as one of its authors.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Street-Folk will still require another volume,\r\nin order to complete it in that comprehensive manner in which I am\r\ndesirous of executing the modern history of this and every other\r\nportion of the people. There still remain--the _Street-Buyers_, the\r\n_Street-Finders_, the _Street-Performers_, the _Street-Artizans_,\r\nand the _Street-Labourers_, to be done, among the several classes\r\nof street-people; and the _Street Jews_, the _Street Italians and\r\nForeigners_, and the _Street Mechanics_, to be treated of as varieties\r\nof the order. The present volume refers more particularly to the\r\n_Street-Sellers_, and includes special accounts of the _Costermongers_\r\nand the _Patterers_ (the two broadly-marked varieties of street\r\ntradesmen), the _Street Irish_, the _Female Street-Sellers_, and the\r\n_Children Street-Sellers_ of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nMy earnest hope is that the book may serve to give the rich a more\r\nintimate knowledge of the sufferings, and the frequent heroism under\r\nthose sufferings, of the poor--that it may teach those who are beyond\r\ntemptation to look with charity on the frailties of their less\r\nfortunate brethren--and cause those who are in “high places,” and those\r\nof whom much is expected, to bestir themselves to improve the condition\r\nof a class of people whose misery, ignorance, and vice, amidst all the\r\nimmense wealth and great knowledge of “the first city in the world,”\r\nis, to say the very least, a national disgrace to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON LABOUR\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET-FOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WANDERING TRIBES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the thousand millions of human beings that are said to constitute\r\nthe population of the entire globe, there are--socially, morally,\r\nand perhaps even physically considered--but two distinct and broadly\r\nmarked races, viz., the wanderers and the settlers--the vagabond and\r\nthe citizen--the nomadic and the civilized tribes. Between these two\r\nextremes, however, ethnologists recognize a mediate variety, partaking\r\nof the attributes of both. There is not only the race of hunters and\r\nmanufacturers--those who live by shooting and fishing, and those who\r\nlive by producing--but, say they, there are also the herdsmen, or those\r\nwho live by tending and feeding, what they consume.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes has its peculiar and distinctive physical as\r\nwell as moral characteristics. “There are in mankind,” says Dr.\r\nPritchard, “three principal varieties in the form of the head and other\r\nphysical characters. Among the rudest tribes of men--the hunters and\r\nsavage inhabitants of forests, dependent for their supply of food on\r\nthe accidental produce of the soil and the chase--a form of head is\r\nprevalent which is mostly distinguished by the term “_prognathous_,”\r\nindicating a prolongation or extension forward of the jaws. A second\r\nshape of the head belongs principally to such races as wander with\r\ntheir herds and flocks over vast plains; these nations have broad\r\nlozenge-shaped faces (owing to the great development of the cheek\r\nbones), and pyramidal skulls. The most civilized races, on the other\r\nhand--those who live by the arts of cultivated life,--have a shape\r\nof the head which differs from both of those above mentioned. The\r\ncharacteristic form of the skull among these nations may be termed oval\r\nor elliptical.”\r\n\r\nThese three forms of head, however, clearly admit of being reduced\r\nto two broadly-marked varieties, according as the bones of the face\r\nor those of the skull are more highly developed. A greater relative\r\ndevelopment of the jaws and cheek bones, says the author of the\r\n“Natural History of Man,” indicates a more ample extension of the\r\norgans subservient to sensation and the animal faculties. Such a\r\nconfiguration is adapted to the wandering tribes; whereas, the greater\r\nrelative development of the bones of the skull--indicating as it does\r\na greater expansion of the brain, and consequently of the intellectual\r\nfaculties--is especially adapted to the civilized races or settlers,\r\nwho depend mainly on their knowledge of the powers and properties of\r\nthings for the necessaries and comforts of life.\r\n\r\nMoreover it would appear, that not only are all races divisible into\r\nwanderers and settlers, but that each civilized or settled tribe has\r\ngenerally some wandering horde intermingled with, and in a measure\r\npreying upon, it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Andrew Smith, who has recently made extensive\r\nobservations in South Africa, almost every tribe of people who have\r\nsubmitted themselves to social laws, recognizing the rights of\r\nproperty and reciprocal social duties, and thus acquiring wealth\r\nand forming themselves into a respectable caste, are surrounded by\r\nhordes of vagabonds and outcasts from their own community. Such are\r\nthe Bushmen and _Sonquas_ of the Hottentot race--the term “_sonqua_”\r\nmeaning literally _pauper_. But a similar condition in society produces\r\nsimilar results in regard to other races; and the Kafirs have their\r\nBushmen as well as the Hottentots--these are called _Fingoes_--a word\r\nsignifying wanderers, beggars, or outcasts. The Lappes seem to have\r\nborne a somewhat similar relation to the Finns; that is to say, they\r\nappear to have been a wild and predatory tribe who sought the desert\r\nlike the Arabian Bedouins, while the Finns cultivated the soil like the\r\nindustrious Fellahs.\r\n\r\nBut a phenomenon still more deserving of notice, is the difference\r\nof speech between the Bushmen and the Hottentots. The people of some\r\nhordes, Dr. Andrew Smith assures us, vary their speech designedly,\r\nand adopt new words, with the intent of rendering their ideas\r\nunintelligible to all but the members of their own community. For this\r\nlast custom a peculiar name exists, which is called “_cuze-cat_.” This\r\nis considered as greatly advantageous in assisting concealment of their\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a series of facts of the utmost social importance.\r\n(1) There are two distinct races of men, viz.:--the wandering and\r\nthe civilized tribes; (2) to each of these tribes a different form\r\nof head is peculiar, the wandering races being remarkable for the\r\ndevelopment of the bones of the face, as the jaws, cheek-bones, &c.,\r\nand the civilized for the development of those of the head; (3) to each\r\ncivilized tribe there is generally a wandering horde attached; (4) such\r\nwandering hordes have frequently a different language from the more\r\ncivilized portion of the community, and that adopted with the intent of\r\nconcealing their designs and exploits from them.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that no one has as yet applied the above facts to the\r\nexplanation of certain anomalies in the present state of society\r\namong ourselves. That we, like the Kafirs, Fellahs, and Finns, are\r\nsurrounded by wandering hordes--the “Sonquas” and the “Fingoes” of\r\nthis country--paupers, beggars, and outcasts, possessing nothing but\r\nwhat they acquire by depredation from the industrious, provident, and\r\ncivilized portion of the community;--that the heads of these nomades\r\nare remarkable for the greater development of the jaws and cheekbones\r\nrather than those of the head;--and that they have a secret language\r\nof their own--an English “_cuze-cat_” or “slang” as it is called--for\r\nthe concealment of their designs: these are points of coincidence so\r\nstriking that, when placed before the mind, make us marvel that the\r\nanalogy should have remained thus long unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance once discovered, however, becomes of great service in\r\nenabling us to use the moral characteristics of the nomade races of\r\nother countries, as a means of comprehending the more readily those\r\nof the vagabonds and outcasts of our own. Let us therefore, before\r\nentering upon the subject in hand, briefly run over the distinctive,\r\nmoral, and intellectual features of the wandering tribes in general.\r\n\r\nThe nomad then is distinguished from the civilized man by his\r\nrepugnance to regular and continuous labour--by his want of providence\r\nin laying up a store for the future--by his inability to perceive\r\nconsequences ever so slightly removed from immediate apprehension--by\r\nhis passion for stupefying herbs and roots, and, when possible, for\r\nintoxicating fermented liquors--by his extraordinary powers of enduring\r\nprivation--by his comparative insensibility to pain--by an immoderate\r\nlove of gaming, frequently risking his own personal liberty upon a\r\nsingle cast--by his love of libidinous dances--by the pleasure he\r\nexperiences in witnessing the suffering of sentient creatures--by\r\nhis delight in warfare and all perilous sports--by his desire for\r\nvengeance--by the looseness of his notions as to property--by the\r\nabsence of chastity among his women, and his disregard of female\r\nhonour--and lastly, by his vague sense of religion--his rude idea of\r\na Creator, and utter absence of all appreciation of the mercy of the\r\nDivine Spirit.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, despite its privations, its dangers, and its hardships,\r\nthose who have once adopted the savage and wandering mode of life,\r\nrarely abandon it. There are countless examples of white men adopting\r\nall the usages of the Indian hunter, but there is scarcely one example\r\nof the Indian hunter or trapper adopting the steady and regular habits\r\nof civilized life; indeed, the various missionaries who have visited\r\nnomade races have found their labours utterly unavailing, so long as a\r\nwandering life continued, and have succeeded in bestowing the elements\r\nof civilization, only on those compelled by circumstances to adopt a\r\nsettled habitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WANDERING TRIBES OF THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe nomadic races of England are of many distinct kinds--from the\r\nhabitual vagrant--half-beggar, half-thief--sleeping in barns, tents,\r\nand casual wards--to the mechanic on tramp, obtaining his bed and\r\nsupper from the trade societies in the different towns, on his way\r\nto seek work. Between these two extremes there are several mediate\r\nvarieties--consisting of pedlars, showmen, harvest-men, and all that\r\nlarge class who live by either selling, showing, or doing something\r\nthrough the country. These are, so to speak, the rural nomads--not\r\nconfining their wanderings to any one particular locality, but\r\nranging often from one end of the land to the other. Besides these,\r\nthere are the urban and suburban wanderers, or those who follow some\r\nitinerant occupation in and round about the large towns. Such are, in\r\nthe metropolis more particularly, the pickpockets--the beggars--the\r\nprostitutes--the street-sellers--the street-performers--the cabmen--the\r\ncoachmen--the watermen--the sailors and such like. In each of these\r\nclasses--according as they partake more or less of the purely vagabond,\r\ndoing nothing whatsoever for their living, but moving from place to\r\nplace preying upon the earnings of the more industrious portion of the\r\ncommunity, so will the attributes of the nomade tribes be found to be\r\nmore or less marked in them. Whether it be that in the mere act of\r\nwandering, there is a greater determination of blood to the surface\r\nof the body, and consequently a less quantity sent to the brain, the\r\nmuscles being thus nourished at the expense of the mind, I leave\r\nphysiologists to say. But certainly be the physical cause what it may,\r\nwe must all allow that in each of the classes above-mentioned, there\r\nis a greater development of the animal than of the intellectual or\r\nmoral nature of man, and that they are all more or less distinguished\r\nfor their high cheek-bones and protruding jaws--for their use of a\r\nslang language--for their lax ideas of property--for their general\r\nimprovidence--their repugnance to continuous labour--their disregard of\r\nfemale honour--their love of cruelty--their pugnacity--and their utter\r\nwant of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LONDON STREET-FOLK.\r\n\r\nThose who obtain their living in the streets of the metropolis are a\r\nvery large and varied class; indeed, the means resorted to in order “to\r\npick up a crust,” as the people call it, in the public thoroughfares\r\n(and such in many instances it _literally_ is,) are so multifarious\r\nthat the mind is long baffled in its attempts to reduce them to\r\nscientific order or classification.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that the street-people may be all arranged\r\nunder six distinct genera or kinds.\r\n\r\nThese are severally:\r\n\r\n    I. STREET-SELLERS.\r\n   II. STREET-BUYERS.\r\n  III. STREET-FINDERS.\r\n   IV. STREET-PERFORMERS, ARTISTS, AND SHOWMEN.\r\n    V. STREET-ARTIZANS, or WORKING PEDLARS; and\r\n   VI. STREET-LABOURERS.\r\n\r\nThe first of these divisions--the STREET-SELLERS--includes many\r\nvarieties; viz.--\r\n\r\n1. _The Street-sellers of Fish, &c._--“wet,” “dry,” and shell-fish--and\r\npoultry, game, and cheese.\r\n\r\n2. _The Street-sellers of Vegetables_, fruit (both “green” and “dry”),\r\nflowers, trees, shrubs, seeds, and roots, and “green stuff” (as\r\nwater-cresses, chickweed and grun’sel, and turf).\r\n\r\n3. _The Street-sellers of Eatables and Drinkables_,--including the\r\nvendors of fried fish, hot eels, pickled whelks, sheep’s trotters,\r\nham sandwiches, peas’-soup, hot green peas, penny pies, plum “duff,”\r\nmeat-puddings, baked potatoes, spice-cakes, muffins and crumpets,\r\nChelsea buns, sweetmeats, brandy-balls, cough drops, and cat and dog’s\r\nmeat--such constituting the principal eatables sold in the street;\r\nwhile under the head of street-drinkables may be specified tea and\r\ncoffee, ginger-beer, lemonade, hot wine, new milk from the cow, asses\r\nmilk, curds and whey, and occasionally water.\r\n\r\n4. _The Street-sellers of Stationery, Literature, and the Fine\r\nArts_--among whom are comprised the flying stationers, or standing and\r\nrunning patterers; the long-song-sellers; the wall-song-sellers (or\r\n“pinners-up,” as they are technically termed); the ballad sellers; the\r\nvendors of play-bills, second editions of newspapers, back numbers of\r\nperiodicals and old books, almanacks, pocket books, memorandum books,\r\nnote paper, sealing-wax, pens, pencils, stenographic cards, valentines,\r\nengravings, manuscript music, images, and gelatine poetry cards.\r\n\r\n5. _The Street-sellers of Manufactured Articles_, which class\r\ncomprises a large number of individuals, as, (_a_) the vendors\r\nof chemical articles of manufacture--viz., blacking, lucifers,\r\ncorn-salves, grease-removing compositions, plating-balls, poison for\r\nrats, crackers, detonating-balls, and cigar-lights. (_b_) The vendors\r\nof metal articles of manufacture--razors and pen-knives, tea-trays,\r\ndog-collars, and key-rings, hardware, bird-cages, small coins, medals,\r\njewellery, tin-ware, tools, card-counters, red-herring-toasters,\r\ntrivets, gridirons, and Dutch ovens. (_c_) The vendors of china and\r\nstone articles of manufacture--as cups and saucers, jugs, vases,\r\nchimney ornaments, and stone fruit. (_d_) The vendors of linen,\r\ncotton, and silken articles of manufacture--as sheeting, table-covers,\r\ncotton, tapes and thread, boot and stay-laces, haberdashery, pretended\r\nsmuggled goods, shirt-buttons, etc., etc.; and (_e_) the vendors\r\nof miscellaneous articles of manufacture--as cigars, pipes, and\r\nsnuff-boxes, spectacles, combs, “lots,” rhubarb, sponges, wash-leather,\r\npaper-hangings, dolls, Bristol toys, sawdust, and pin-cushions.\r\n\r\n6. _The Street-sellers of Second-hand Articles_, of whom there are\r\nagain four separate classes; as (_a_) those who sell old metal\r\narticles--viz. old knives and forks, keys, tin-ware, tools, and\r\nmarine stores generally; (_b_) those who sell old linen articles--as\r\nold sheeting for towels; (_c_) those who sell old glass and\r\ncrockery--including bottles, old pans and pitchers, old looking\r\nglasses, &c.; and (_d_) those who sell old miscellaneous articles--as\r\nold shoes, old clothes, old saucepan lids, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n7. _The Street-sellers of Live Animals_--including the dealers in dogs,\r\nsquirrels, birds, gold and silver fish, and tortoises.\r\n\r\n8. _The Street-sellers of Mineral Productions and Curiosities_--as red\r\nand white sand, silver sand, coals, coke, salt, spar ornaments, and\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThese, so far as my experience goes, exhaust the whole class of\r\nstreet-sellers, and they appear to constitute nearly three-fourths of\r\nthe entire number of individuals obtaining a subsistence in the streets\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nThe next class are the STREET-BUYERS, under which denomination come the\r\npurchasers of hareskins, old clothes, old umbrellas, bottles, glass,\r\nbroken metal, rags, waste paper, and dripping.\r\n\r\nAfter these we have the STREET-FINDERS, or those who, as I said before,\r\nliterally “pick up” their living in the public thoroughfares. They are\r\nthe “pure” pickers, or those who live by gathering dogs’-dung; the\r\ncigar-end finders, or “hard-ups,” as they are called, who collect the\r\nrefuse pieces of smoked cigars from the gutters, and having dried them,\r\nsell them as tobacco to the very poor; the dredgermen or coal-finders;\r\nthe mud-larks, the bone-grubbers; and the sewer-hunters.\r\n\r\nUnder the fourth division, or that of the STREET-PERFORMERS, ARTISTS,\r\nAND SHOWMEN, are likewise many distinct callings.\r\n\r\n1. _The Street-Performers_, who admit of being classified into (_a_)\r\nmountebanks--or those who enact puppet-shows, as Punch and Judy, the\r\nfantoccini, and the Chinese shades. (_b_) The street-performers\r\nof feats of strength and dexterity--as “acrobats” or posturers,\r\n“equilibrists” or balancers, stiff and bending tumblers, jugglers,\r\nconjurors, sword-swallowers, “salamanders” or fire-eaters, swordsmen,\r\netc. (_c_) The street-performers with trained animals--as dancing dogs,\r\nperforming monkeys, trained birds and mice, cats and hares, sapient\r\npigs, dancing bears, and tame camels. (_d_) The street-actors--as\r\nclowns, “Billy Barlows,” “Jim Crows,” and others.\r\n\r\n2. _The Street Showmen_, including shows of (_a_) extraordinary\r\npersons--as giants, dwarfs, Albinoes, spotted boys, and pig-faced\r\nladies. (_b_) Extraordinary animals--as alligators, calves, horses\r\nand pigs with six legs or two heads, industrious fleas, and happy\r\nfamilies. (_c_) Philosophic instruments--as the microscope, telescope,\r\nthaumascope. (_d_) Measuring-machines--as weighing, lifting, measuring,\r\nand striking machines; and (_e_) miscellaneous shows--such as\r\npeep-shows, glass ships, mechanical figures, wax-work shows, pugilistic\r\nshows, and fortune-telling apparatus.\r\n\r\n3. _The Street-Artists_--as black profile-cutters, blind paper-cutters,\r\n“screevers” or draughtsmen in coloured chalks on the pavement, writers\r\nwithout hands, and readers without eyes.\r\n\r\n4. _The Street Dancers_--as street Scotch girls, sailors, slack and\r\ntight rope dancers, dancers on stilts, and comic dancers.\r\n\r\n5. _The Street Musicians_--as the street bands (English and German),\r\nplayers of the guitar, harp, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, dulcimer, musical\r\nbells, cornet, tom-tom, &c.\r\n\r\n6. _The Street Singers_, as the singers of glees, ballads, comic songs,\r\nnigger melodies, psalms, serenaders, reciters, and improvisatori.\r\n\r\n7. _The Proprietors of Street Games_, as swings, highflyers,\r\nroundabouts, puff-and-darts, rifle shooting, down the dolly,\r\nspin-’em-rounds, prick the garter, thimble-rig, etc.\r\n\r\nThen comes the Fifth Division of the Street-Folk, viz., the\r\nSTREET-ARTIZANS, or WORKING PEDLARS;\r\n\r\nThese may be severally arranged into three distinct groups--(1) Those\r\nwho _make_ things in the streets; (2) Those who _mend_ things in the\r\nstreets; and (3) Those who _make_ things _at home_ and _sell_ them in\r\nthe _streets_.\r\n\r\n1. Of _those who make things in the streets_ there are the\r\nfollowing varieties: (_a_) the metal workers--such as toasting-fork\r\nmakers, pin makers, engravers, tobacco-stopper makers. (_b_) The\r\ntextile-workers--stocking-weavers, cabbage-net makers, night-cap\r\nknitters, doll-dress knitters. (_c_) The miscellaneous workers,--the\r\nwooden spoon makers, the leather brace and garter makers, the printers,\r\nand the glass-blowers.\r\n\r\n2. _Those who mend things in the streets_, consist of broken china and\r\nglass menders, clock menders, umbrella menders, kettle menders, chair\r\nmenders, grease removers, hat cleaners, razor and knife grinders,\r\nglaziers, travelling bell hangers, and knife cleaners.\r\n\r\n3. _Those who make things at home and sell them in the streets_, are\r\n(_a_) the wood workers--as the makers of clothes-pegs, clothes-props,\r\nskewers, needle-cases, foot-stools and clothes-horses, chairs\r\nand tables, tea-caddies, writing-desks, drawers, work-boxes,\r\ndressing-cases, pails and tubs. (_b_) The trunk, hat, and bonnet-box\r\nmakers, and the cane and rush basket makers. (_c_) The toy makers--such\r\nas Chinese roarers, children’s windmills, flying birds and fishes,\r\nfeathered cocks, black velvet cats and sweeps, paper houses, cardboard\r\ncarriages, little copper pans and kettles, tiny tin fireplaces,\r\nchildren’s watches, Dutch dolls, buy-a-brooms, and gutta-percha heads.\r\n(_d_) The apparel makers--viz., the makers of women’s caps, boys and\r\nmen’s cloth caps, night-caps, straw bonnets, children’s dresses,\r\nwatch-pockets, bonnet shapes, silk bonnets, and gaiters. (_e_) The\r\nmetal workers,--as the makers of fire-guards, bird-cages, the wire\r\nworkers. (_f_) The miscellaneous workers--or makers of ornaments\r\nfor stoves, chimney ornaments, artificial flowers in pots and in\r\nnose-gays, plaster-of-Paris night-shades, brooms, brushes, mats, rugs,\r\nhearthstones, firewood, rush matting, and hassocks.\r\n\r\nOf the last division, or STREET-LABOURERS, there are four classes:\r\n\r\n1. _The Cleansers_--such as scavengers, nightmen, flushermen,\r\nchimney-sweeps, dustmen, crossing-sweepers, “street-orderlies,”\r\nlabourers to sweeping-machines and to watering-carts.\r\n\r\n2. _The Lighters and Waterers_--or the turncocks and the lamplighters.\r\n\r\n3. _The Street-Advertisers_--viz., the bill-stickers, bill-deliverers,\r\nboardmen, men to advertising vans, and wall and pavement stencillers.\r\n\r\n4. _The Street-Servants_--as horse holders, link-men, coach-hirers,\r\nstreet-porters, shoe-blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NUMBER OF COSTERMONGERS AND OTHER STREET-FOLK.\r\n\r\nThe number of costermongers,--that it is to say, of those\r\nstreet-sellers attending the London “green” and “fish\r\nmarkets,”--appears to be, from the best data at my command, now 30,000\r\nmen, women, and children. The census of 1841 gives only 2,045 “hawkers,\r\nhucksters, and pedlars,” in the metropolis, and no costermongers or\r\nstreet-sellers, or street-performers at all. This number is absurdly\r\nsmall, and its absurdity is accounted for by the fact that not one in\r\ntwenty of the costermongers, or of the people with whom they lodged,\r\ntroubled themselves to fill up the census returns--the majority of them\r\nbeing unable to read and write, and others distrustful of the purpose\r\nfor which the returns were wanted.\r\n\r\nThe costermongering class extends itself yearly; and it is computed\r\nthat for the last five years it has increased considerably faster than\r\nthe general metropolitan population. This increase is derived partly\r\nfrom _all_ the children of costermongers following the father’s trade,\r\nbut chiefly from working men, such as the servants of greengrocers or\r\nof innkeepers, when out of employ, “taking to a coster’s barrow” for a\r\nlivelihood; and the same being done by mechanics and labourers out of\r\nwork. At the time of the famine in Ireland, it is calculated, that the\r\nnumber of Irish obtaining a living in the London streets must have been\r\nat least doubled.\r\n\r\nThe great discrepancy between the government returns and the accounts\r\nof the costermongers themselves, concerning the number of people\r\nobtaining a living by the sale of fish, fruit, and vegetables, in the\r\nstreets of London, caused me to institute an inquiry at the several\r\nmetropolitan markets concerning the number of street-sellers attending\r\nthem: the following is the result:\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months and fruit season, the average number of\r\ncostermongers attending Covent-garden market is about 2,500 per\r\nmarket-day. In the strawberry season there are nearly double as many,\r\nthere being, at that time, a large number of Jews who come to buy;\r\nduring that period, on a Saturday morning, from the commencement to\r\nthe close of the market, as many as 4,000 costers have been reckoned\r\npurchasing at Covent-garden. Through the winter season, however, the\r\nnumber of costermongers does not exceed upon the average 1,000 per\r\nmarket morning. About one-tenth of the fruit and vegetables of the\r\nleast expensive kind sold at this market is purchased by the costers.\r\nSome of the better class of costers, who have their regular customers,\r\nare very particular as to the quality of the articles they buy; but\r\nothers are not so particular; so long as they can get things cheap, I\r\nam informed, they do not care much about the quality. The Irish more\r\nespecially look out for damaged articles, which they buy at a low\r\nprice. One of my informants told me that the costers were the best\r\ncustomers to the growers, inasmuch as when the market is flagging\r\non account of the weather, they (the costers) wait and make their\r\npurchases. On other occasions, such as fine mornings, the costers\r\npurchase as early as others. There is no trust given to them--to use\r\nthe words of one of my informants, they are such slippery customers;\r\nhere to-day and gone to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAt Leadenhall market, during the winter months, there are from 70 to\r\n100 costermongers general attendants; but during the summer not much\r\nmore than one-half that number make their appearance. Their purchases\r\nconsist of warren-rabbits, poultry, and game, of which about one-eighth\r\nof the whole amount brought to this market is bought by them. When the\r\nmarket is slack, and during the summer, when there is “no great call”\r\nfor game, etc., the costers attending Leadenhall-market turn their hand\r\nto crockery, fruit, and fish.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers frequenting Spitalfields-market average all the year\r\nthrough from 700 to 1,000 each market-day. They come from all parts, as\r\nfar as Edmonton, Edgeware, and Tottenham; Highgate, Hampstead, and even\r\nfrom Greenwich and Lewisham. Full one-third of the produce of this\r\nmarket is purchased by them.\r\n\r\nThe number of costermongers attending the Borough-market is about 250\r\nduring the fruit season, after which time they decrease to about 200\r\nper market morning. About one-sixth of the produce that comes into this\r\nmarket is purchased by the costermongers. One gentleman informed me,\r\nthat the salesmen might shut up their shops were it not for these men.\r\n“In fact,” said another, “I don’t know what would become of the fruit\r\nwithout them.”\r\n\r\nThe costers at Billingsgate-market, daily, number from 3,000 to 4,000\r\nin winter, and about 2,500 in summer. A leading salesman told me that\r\nhe would rather have an order from a costermonger than a fishmonger;\r\nfor the one paid ready money, while the other required credit. The same\r\ngentleman assured me, that the costermongers bought excellent fish, and\r\nthat very largely. They themselves aver that they purchase half the\r\nfish brought to Billingsgate--some fish trades being entirely in their\r\nhands. I ascertained, however, from the authorities at Billingsgate,\r\nand from experienced salesmen, that of the quantity of fish conveyed\r\nto that great mart, the costermongers bought one-third; another third\r\nwas sent into the country; and another disposed of to the fishmongers,\r\nand to such hotel-keepers, or other large purchasers, as resorted to\r\nBillingsgate.\r\n\r\nThe salesmen at the several markets all agreed in stating that no\r\ntrust was given to the costermongers. “Trust them!” exclaimed one, “O,\r\ncertainly, as far as I can see them.”\r\n\r\nNow, adding the above figures together, we have the subjoined sum for\r\nthe gross number of\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTERMONGERS ATTENDING THE LONDON MARKETS.\r\n\r\n  Billingsgate-market   3,500\r\n  Covent-garden         4,000\r\n  Spitalfields          1,000\r\n  Borough                 250\r\n  Leadenhall              100\r\n                        -----\r\n                        8,850\r\n                        -----\r\n\r\nBesides these, I am credibly informed, that it may be assumed there\r\nare full 1,000 men who are unable to attend market, owing to the\r\ndissipation of the previous night; another 1,000 are absent owing to\r\ntheir having “stock on hand,” and so requiring no fresh purchases;\r\nand further, it may be estimated that there are at least 2,000 boys\r\nin London at work for costers, at half profits, and who consequently\r\nhave no occasion to visit the markets. Hence, putting these numbers\r\ntogether, we arrive at the conclusion that there are in London upwards\r\nof 13,000 street-sellers, dealing in fish, fruit, vegetables, game,\r\nand poultry alone. To be on the safe side, however, let us assume the\r\nnumber of London costermongers to be 12,000, and that one-half of these\r\nare married and have two children (which from all accounts appears to\r\nbe about the proportion); and then we have 30,000 for the sum total\r\nof men, women, and children dependent on “costermongering” for their\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nLarge as this number may seem, still I am satisfied it is rather\r\nwithin than beyond the truth. In order to convince myself of its\r\naccuracy, I caused it to be checked in several ways. In the first\r\nplace, a survey was made as to the number of stalls in the streets of\r\nLondon--forty-six miles of the principal thoroughfares were travelled\r\nover, and an account taken of the “standings.” Thus it was found that\r\nthere were upon an average upwards of fourteen stalls to the mile,\r\nof which five-sixths were fish and fruit-stalls. Now, according to\r\nthe Metropolitan Police Returns, there are 2,000 miles of street\r\nthroughout London, and calculating that the stalls through the whole\r\nof the metropolis run upon an average only four to the mile, we shall\r\nthus find that there are 8,000 stalls altogether in London; of these\r\nwe may reckon that at least 6,000 are fish and fruit-stalls. I am\r\ninformed, on the best authority, that twice as many costers “go rounds”\r\nas have standings; hence we come to the conclusion that there are\r\n18,000 itinerant and stationary street-sellers of fish, vegetables, and\r\nfruit, in the metropolis; and reckoning the same proportion of wives\r\nand children as before, we have thus 45,000 men, women, and children,\r\nobtaining a living in this manner. Further, “to make assurance doubly\r\nsure,” the street-markets throughout London were severally visited,\r\nand the number of street-sellers at each taken down on the spot.\r\nThese gave a grand total of 3,801, of which number two-thirds were\r\ndealers in fish, fruit, and vegetables; and reckoning that twice as\r\nmany costers again were on their rounds, we thus make the total number\r\nof London costermongers to be 11,403, or calculating men, women, and\r\nchildren, 28,506. It would appear, therefore, that if we estimate the\r\ngross number of individuals subsisting on the sale of fish, fruit, and\r\nvegetables, in the streets of London, at between twenty-five and thirty\r\nthousand, we shall not be very wide of the truth.\r\n\r\nBut, great as is this number, still the costermongers are only a\r\nportion of the street-folk. Besides these, there are, as we have\r\nseen, many other large classes obtaining their livelihood in the\r\nstreets. The street musicians, for instance, are said to number 1,000,\r\nand the old clothesmen the same. There are supposed to be at the\r\nleast 500 sellers of water-cresses; 200 coffee-stalls; 300 cats-meat\r\nmen; 250 ballad-singers; 200 play-bill sellers; from 800 to 1,000\r\nbone-grubbers and mud-larks; 1,000 crossing-sweepers; another thousand\r\nchimney-sweeps, and the same number of turncocks and lamp-lighters;\r\nall of whom, together with the street-performers and showmen, tinkers,\r\nchair, umbrella, and clock-menders, sellers of bonnet-boxes, toys,\r\nstationery, songs, last dying-speeches, tubs, pails, mats, crockery,\r\nblacking, lucifers, corn-salves, clothes-pegs, brooms, sweetmeats,\r\nrazors, dog-collars, dogs, birds, coals, sand,--scavengers, dustmen,\r\nand others, make up, it may be fairly assumed, full thirty thousand\r\nadults, so that, reckoning men, women, and children, we may truly\r\nsay that there are upwards of fifty thousand individuals, or about a\r\nfortieth-part of the entire population of the metropolis getting their\r\nliving in the streets.\r\n\r\nNow of all modes of obtaining subsistence, that of street-selling is\r\nthe most precarious. Continued wet weather deprives those who depend\r\nfor their bread upon the number of people frequenting the public\r\nthoroughfares of all means of living; and it is painful to think of the\r\nhundreds belonging to this class in the metropolis who are reduced\r\nto starvation by three or four days successive rain. Moreover, in the\r\nwinter, the street-sellers of fruit and vegetables are cut off from the\r\nordinary means of gaining their livelihood, and, consequently, they\r\nhave to suffer the greatest privations at a time when the severity\r\nof the season demands the greatest amount of physical comforts. To\r\nexpect that the increased earnings of the summer should be put aside\r\nas a provision against the deficiencies of the winter, is to expect\r\nthat a precarious occupation should beget provident habits, which is\r\nagainst the nature of things, for it is always in those callings which\r\nare the most uncertain, that the greatest amount of improvidence and\r\nintemperance are found to exist. It is not the well-fed man, be it\r\nobserved, but the starving one that is in danger of surfeiting himself.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when the religious, moral, and intellectual degradation of\r\nthe great majority of these fifty thousand people is impressed upon\r\nus, it becomes positively appalling to contemplate the vast amount of\r\nvice, ignorance and want, existing in these days in the very heart of\r\nour land. The public have but to read the following plain unvarnished\r\naccount of the habits, amusements, dealings, education, politics, and\r\nreligion of the London costermongers in the nineteenth century, and\r\nthen to say whether they think it safe--even if it be thought fit--to\r\nallow men, women, and children to continue in such a state.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE VARIETIES OF STREET-FOLK IN GENERAL, AND COSTERMONGERS IN\r\nPARTICULAR.\r\n\r\nAmong the street-folk there are many distinct characters of\r\npeople--people differing as widely from each in tastes, habits,\r\nthoughts and creed, as one nation from another. Of these the\r\ncostermongers form by far the largest and certainly the mostly\r\nbroadly marked class. They appear to be a distinct race--perhaps,\r\noriginally, of Irish extraction--seldom associating with any other of\r\nthe street-folks, and being all known to each other. The “patterers,”\r\nor the men who cry the last dying-speeches, &c. in the street, and\r\nthose who help off their wares by long harrangues in the public\r\nthoroughfares, are again a separate class. These, to use their own\r\nterm, are “the aristocracy of the street-sellers,” despising the\r\ncosters for their ignorance, and boasting that they live by their\r\nintellect. The public, they say, do not expect to receive from them an\r\nequivalent for their money--they pay to hear them talk. Compared with\r\nthe costermongers, the patterers are generally an educated class, and\r\namong them are some classical scholars, one clergyman, and many sons of\r\ngentlemen. They appear to be the counterparts of the old mountebanks\r\nor street-doctors. As a body they seem far less improvable than the\r\ncosters, being more “knowing” and less impulsive. The street-performers\r\ndiffer again from those; these appear to possess many of the\r\ncharacteristics of the lower class of actors, viz., a strong desire to\r\nexcite admiration, an indisposition to pursue any settled occupation,\r\na love of the tap-room, though more for the society and display than\r\nfor the drink connected with it, a great fondness for finery and\r\npredilection for the performance of dexterous or dangerous feats.\r\nThen there are the street mechanics, or artizans--quiet, melancholy,\r\nstruggling men, who, unable to find any regular employment at their\r\nown trade, have made up a few things, and taken to hawk them in the\r\nstreets, as the last shift of independence. Another distinct class of\r\nstreet-folk are the blind people (mostly musicians in a rude way), who,\r\nafter the loss of their eyesight, have sought to keep themselves from\r\nthe workhouse by some little excuse for alms-seeking. These, so far\r\nas my experience goes, appear to be a far more deserving class than\r\nis usually supposed--their affliction, in most cases, seems to have\r\nchastened them and to have given a peculiar religious cast to their\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nSuch are the several varieties of street-folk, intellectually\r\nconsidered--looked at in a national point of view, they likewise\r\ninclude many distinct people. Among them are to be found the Irish\r\nfruit-sellers; the Jew clothesmen; the Italian organ boys, French\r\nsinging women, the German brass bands, the Dutch buy-a-broom girls, the\r\nHighland bagpipe players, and the Indian crossing-sweepers--all of whom\r\nI here shall treat of in due order.\r\n\r\nThe costermongering class or order has also its many varieties. These\r\nappear to be in the following proportions:--One-half of the entire\r\nclass are costermongers proper, that is to say, the calling with them\r\nis hereditary, and perhaps has been so for many generations; while\r\nthe other half is composed of three-eighths Irish, and one-eighth\r\nmechanics, tradesmen, and Jews.\r\n\r\nUnder the term “costermonger” is here included only such\r\n“street-sellers” as deal in fish, fruit, and vegetables, purchasing\r\ntheir goods at the wholesale “green” and fish markets. Of these some\r\ncarry on their business at the same stationary stall or “standing” in\r\nthe street, while others go on “rounds.” The itinerant costermongers,\r\nas contradistinguished from the stationary street-fishmongers and\r\ngreengrocers, have in many instances regular rounds, which they go\r\ndaily, and which extend from two to ten miles. The longest are those\r\nwhich embrace a suburban part; the shortest are through streets\r\nthickly peopled by the poor, where duly to “work” a single street\r\nconsumes, in some instances, an hour. There are also “chance” rounds.\r\nMen “working” these carry their wares to any part in which they hope to\r\nfind customers. The costermongers, moreover, diversify their labours by\r\noccasionally going on a country round, travelling on these excursions,\r\nin all directions, from thirty to ninety and even a hundred miles from\r\nthe metropolis. Some, again, confine their callings chiefly to the\r\nneighbouring races and fairs.\r\n\r\nOf all the characteristics attending these diversities of traders,\r\nI shall treat severally. I may here premise, that the regular or\r\n“thorough-bred costermongers,” repudiate the numerous persons who sell\r\nonly nuts or oranges in the streets, whether at a fixed stall, or any\r\ngiven locality, or who hawk them through the thoroughfares or parks.\r\nThey repudiate also a number of Jews, who confine their street-trading\r\nto the sale of “coker-nuts” on Sundays, vended from large barrows. Nor\r\ndo they rank with themselves the individuals who sell tea and coffee in\r\nthe streets, or such condiments as peas-soup, sweetmeats, spice-cakes,\r\nand the like; those articles not being purchased at the markets. I\r\noften heard all such classes called “the illegitimates.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF COSTERMONGERING MECHANICS.\r\n\r\n“From the numbers of mechanics,” said one smart costermonger to me,\r\n“that I know of in my own district, I should say there’s now more than\r\n1,000 costers in London that were once mechanics or labourers. They\r\nare driven to it as a last resource, when they can’t get work at their\r\ntrade. They don’t do well, at least four out of five, or three out\r\nof four don’t. They’re not up to the dodges of the business. They go\r\nto market with fear, and don’t know how to venture a bargain if one\r\noffers. They’re inferior salesmen too, and if they have fish left that\r\nwon’t keep, it’s a dead loss to them, for they aren’t up to the trick\r\nof selling it cheap at a distance where the coster ain’t known; or of\r\nquitting it to another, for candle-light sale, cheap, to the Irish\r\nor to the ‘lushingtons,’ that haven’t a proper taste for fish. Some\r\nof these poor fellows lose every penny. They’re mostly middle-aged\r\nwhen they begin costering. They’ll generally commence with oranges or\r\nherrings. We pity them. We say, ‘Poor fellows! they’ll find it out\r\nby-and-bye.’ It’s awful to see some poor women, too, trying to pick up\r\na living in the streets by selling nuts or oranges. It’s awful to see\r\nthem, for they can’t set about it right; besides that, there’s too many\r\nbefore they start. They don’t find a living, _it’s only another way of\r\nstarving_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT CALLING OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of London cries is, according to Mr. Charles\r\nKnight, in Lydgate’s poem of “London Lyckpeny,” which is as old as the\r\ndays of Henry V., or about 430 years back. Among Lydgate’s cries are\r\nenumerated “Strawberries ripe and cherries in the rise;” the _rise_\r\nbeing a twig to which the cherries were tied, as at present. Lydgate,\r\nhowever, only indicates costermongers, but does not mention them by\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, as my inquiries are directed to the _present_\r\ncondition of the costermongers, to dwell on this part of the question,\r\nbut some historical notice of so numerous a body is indispensable. I\r\nshall confine myself therefore to show from the elder dramatists, how\r\nthe costermongers flourished in the days of Elizabeth and James I.\r\n\r\n“Virtue,” says Shakespeare, “is of so little regard in these\r\n_coster-monger times_, that true valour is turned bear-herd.”\r\nCostermonger times are as old as any trading times of which our\r\nhistory tells; indeed, the stationary costermonger of our own day is\r\na legitimate descendant of the tradesmen of the olden time, who stood\r\nby their shops with their open casements, loudly inviting buyers by\r\npraises of their wares, and by direct questions of “What d’ye buy? What\r\nd’ye lack?”\r\n\r\nBen Jonson makes his _Morose_, who hated all noises, and sought for\r\na silent wife, enter “upon divers treaties with the fish-wives and\r\norange-women,” to moderate their clamour; but _Morose_, above all other\r\nnoisy people, “cannot endure a costard-monger; he swoons if he hear\r\none.”\r\n\r\nIn Ford’s “Sun’s Darling” I find the following: “Upon my life he means\r\nto turn costermonger, and is projecting how to forestall the market. I\r\nshall cry pippins rarely.”\r\n\r\nIn Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Scornful Lady” is the following:\r\n\r\n  “Pray, sister, do not laugh; you’ll anger him,\r\n  And then he’ll rail like a rude costermonger.”\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, gives the derivation of costard-monger (the orthography he\r\nuses), as derived from the sale of apples or costards, “round and bulky\r\nlike the head;” and he cites Burton as an authority: “Many country\r\nvicars,” writes Burton, “are driven to shifts, and if our great patrons\r\nhold us to such conditions, they will make us _costard-mongers_,\r\ngraziers, or sell ale.”\r\n\r\n“The costard-monger,” says Mr. Charles Knight, in his “London,” “was\r\noriginally an apple-seller, whence his name, and, from the mention\r\nof him in the old dramatists, he appears to have been frequently an\r\nIrishman.”\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the word “costermonger” is almost unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE OBSOLETE CRIES OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nA brief account of the cries once prevalent among the street-sellers\r\nwill show somewhat significantly the change in the diet or regalements\r\nof those who purchase their food in the street. Some of the articles\r\nare not vended in the public thoroughfares now, while others are still\r\nsold, but in different forms.\r\n\r\n“Hot sheep’s feet,” for instance, were cried in the streets in the\r\ntime of Henry V.; they are now sold _cold_, at the doors of the\r\nlower-priced theatres, and at the larger public-houses. Among the\r\nstreet cries, the following were common prior to the wars of the Roses:\r\n“Ribs of beef,”--“Hot peascod,”--and “Pepper and saffron.” These\r\ncertainly indicate a different street diet from that of the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe following are more modern, running from Elizabeth’s days down to\r\nour own. “Pippins,” and, in the times of Charles II., and subsequently,\r\noranges were sometimes cried as “Orange pips,”--“Fair lemons and\r\noranges; oranges and citrons,”--“New Wall-fleet oysters,” [“_fresh_”\r\nfish was formerly cried as “new,”]--“New-river water,” [I may here\r\nmention that water-carriers still ply their trade in parts of\r\nHampstead,]--“Rosemary and lavender,”--“Small coals,” [a cry rendered\r\nalmost poetical by the character, career, and pitiful end, through a\r\npractical joke, of Tom Britton, the “small-coal man,”]--“Pretty pins,\r\npretty women,”--“Lilly-white vinegar,”--“Hot wardens” (pears)--“Hot\r\ncodlings,”--and lastly the greasy-looking beverage which Charles\r\nLamb’s experience of London at early morning satisfied him was of all\r\npreparations the most grateful to the stomach of the then existing\r\nclimbing-boys--viz., “Sa-loop.” I may state, for the information of\r\nmy younger readers, that saloop (spelt also “salep” and “salop”) was\r\nprepared, as a powder, from the root of the _Orchis mascula_, or\r\nRed-handed Orchis, a plant which grows luxuriantly in our meadows and\r\npastures, flowering in the spring, though never cultivated to any\r\nextent in this country; that required for the purposes of commerce was\r\nimported from India. The saloop-stalls were superseded by the modern\r\ncoffee-stalls.\r\n\r\nThere were many other cries, now obsolete, but what I have cited were\r\nthe most common.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS “ECONOMICALLY” CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nPolitical economy teaches us that, between the two great classes of\r\nproducers and consumers, stand the distributors--or dealers--saving\r\ntime, trouble, and inconvenience to, the one in disposing of, and to\r\nthe other in purchasing, their commodities.\r\n\r\nBut the distributor was not always a part and parcel of the economical\r\narrangements of the State. In olden times, the producer and consumer\r\nwere brought into immediate contact, at markets and fairs, holden\r\nat certain intervals. The inconvenience of this mode of operation,\r\nhowever, was soon felt; and the pedlar, or wandering distributor,\r\nsprang up as a means of carrying the commodities to those who were\r\nunable to attend the public markets at the appointed time. Still the\r\npedlar or wandering distributor was not without _his_ disadvantages.\r\nHe only came at certain periods, and commodities were occasionally\r\nrequired in the interim. Hence the shopkeeper, or stationary\r\ndistributor, was called into existence, so that the consumer might\r\nobtain any commodity of the producer at any time he pleased. Hence we\r\nsee that the pedlar is the primitive tradesman, and that the one is\r\ncontradistinguished from the other by the fact, that the pedlar carries\r\nthe goods to the consumer, whereas, in the case of the shopkeeper,\r\nthe consumer goes after the goods. In country districts, remote from\r\ntowns and villages, the pedlar is not yet wholly superseded; “but a\r\ndealer who has a fixed abode, and fixed customers, is so much more\r\nto be depended on,” says Mr. Stewart Mill, “that consumers prefer\r\nresorting to him if he is conveniently accessible, and dealers,\r\ntherefore, find their advantage in establishing themselves in every\r\nlocality where there are sufficient customers near at hand to afford\r\nthem a remuneration.” Hence the pedlar is now chiefly confined to the\r\npoorer districts, and is consequently distinguished from the stationary\r\ntradesman by the character and means of his customers, as well as\r\nby the amount of capital and extent of his dealings. The shopkeeper\r\nsupplies principally the noblemen and gentry with the necessaries and\r\nluxuries of life, but the pedlar or hawker is the purveyor in general\r\nto the poor. He brings the greengrocery, the fruit, the fish, the\r\nwater-cresses, the shrimps, the pies and puddings, the sweetmeats, the\r\npine-apples, the stationery, the linendrapery, and the jewellery, such\r\nas it is, to the very door of the working classes; indeed, the poor\r\nman’s food and clothing are mainly supplied to him in this manner.\r\nHence the class of travelling tradesmen are important, not only as\r\nforming a large portion of the poor themselves, but as being the\r\npersons through whom the working people obtain a considerable part of\r\ntheir provisions and raiment.\r\n\r\nBut the itinerant tradesman or street-seller is still further\r\ndistinguished from the regular fixed dealer--the _stall_keeper from the\r\n_shop_keeper--the _street_-wareman from the ware_house_man, by the arts\r\nthey respectively employ to attract custom. The street-seller cries\r\nhis goods aloud at the head of his barrow; the enterprising tradesman\r\ndistributes bills at the door of his shop. The one appeals to the ear,\r\nthe other to the eye. The cutting costermonger has a drum and two boys\r\nto excite attention to his stock; the spirited shopkeeper has a column\r\nof advertisements in the morning newspapers. They are but different\r\nmeans of attaining the same end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON STREET MARKETS ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe street sellers are to be seen in the greatest numbers at the\r\nLondon street markets on a Saturday night. Here, and in the shops\r\nimmediately adjoining, the working-classes generally purchase their\r\nSunday’s dinner; and after pay-time on Saturday night, or early on\r\nSunday morning, the crowd in the New-cut, and the Brill in particular,\r\nis almost impassable. Indeed, the scene in these parts has more of\r\nthe character of a fair than a market. There are hundreds of stalls,\r\nand every stall has its one or two lights; either it is illuminated\r\nby the intense white light of the new self-generating gas-lamp, or\r\nelse it is brightened up by the red smoky flame of the old-fashioned\r\ngrease lamp. One man shows off his yellow haddock with a candle stuck\r\nin a bundle of firewood; his neighbour makes a candlestick of a huge\r\nturnip, and the tallow gutters over its sides; whilst the boy shouting\r\n“Eight a penny, stunning pears!” has rolled his dip in a thick coat of\r\nbrown paper, that flares away with the candle. Some stalls are crimson\r\nwith the fire shining through the holes beneath the baked chestnut\r\nstove; others have handsome octohedral lamps, while a few have a candle\r\nshining through a sieve: these, with the sparkling ground-glass globes\r\nof the tea-dealers’ shops, and the butchers’ gaslights streaming and\r\nfluttering in the wind, like flags of flame, pour forth such a flood of\r\nlight, that at a distance the atmosphere immediately above the spot is\r\nas lurid as if the street were on fire.\r\n\r\nThe pavement and the road are crowded with purchasers and\r\nstreet-sellers. The housewife in her thick shawl, with the\r\nmarket-basket on her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now to look at\r\nthe stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys,\r\nholding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people,\r\nwriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in\r\nwhining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand\r\ndifferent cries of the eager dealers, all shouting at the top of their\r\nvoices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. “So-old\r\nagain,” roars one. “Chestnuts all ’ot, a penny a score,” bawls another.\r\n“An ’aypenny a skin, blacking,” squeaks a boy. “Buy, buy, buy, buy,\r\nbuy--bu-u-uy!” cries the butcher. “Half-quire of paper for a penny,”\r\nbellows the street stationer. “An ’aypenny a lot ing-uns.” “Twopence a\r\npound grapes.” “Three a penny Yarmouth bloaters.” “Who’ll buy a bonnet\r\nfor fourpence?” “Pick ’em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny,\r\nbootlaces.” “Now’s your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot.” “Here’s\r\nha’p’orths,” shouts the perambulating confectioner. “Come and look at\r\n’em! here’s toasters!” bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a\r\ntoasting-fork. “Penny a lot, fine russets,” calls the apple woman: and\r\nso the Babel goes on.\r\n\r\nOne man stands with his red-edged mats hanging over his back and chest,\r\nlike a herald’s coat; and the girl with her basket of walnuts lifts\r\nher brown-stained fingers to her mouth, as she screams, “Fine warnuts!\r\nsixteen a penny, fine war-r-nuts.” A bootmaker, to “ensure custom,”\r\nhas illuminated his shop-front with a line of gas, and in its full\r\nglare stands a blind beggar, his eyes turned up so as to show only “the\r\nwhites,” and mumbling some begging rhymes, that are drowned in the\r\nshrill notes of the bamboo-flute-player next to him. The boy’s sharp\r\ncry, the woman’s cracked voice, the gruff, hoarse shout of the man, are\r\nall mingled together. Sometimes an Irishman is heard with his “fine\r\nating apples;” or else the jingling music of an unseen organ breaks\r\nout, as the trio of street singers rest between the verses.\r\n\r\nThen the sights, as you elbow your way through the crowd, are equally\r\nmultifarious. Here is a stall glittering with new tin saucepans; there\r\nanother, bright with its blue and yellow crockery, and sparkling\r\nwith white glass. Now you come to a row of old shoes arranged along\r\nthe pavement; now to a stand of gaudy tea-trays; then to a shop with\r\nred handkerchiefs and blue checked shirts, fluttering backwards and\r\nforwards, and a counter built up outside on the kerb, behind which are\r\nboys beseeching custom. At the door of a tea-shop, with its hundred\r\nwhite globes of light, stands a man delivering bills, thanking the\r\npublic for past favours, and “defying competition.” Here, alongside\r\nthe road, are some half-dozen headless tailors’ dummies, dressed in\r\nChesterfields and fustian jackets, each labelled, “Look at the prices,”\r\nor “Observe the quality.” After this is a butcher’s shop, crimson\r\nand white with meat piled up to the first-floor, in front of which\r\nthe butcher himself, in his blue coat, walks up and down, sharpening\r\nhis knife on the steel that hangs to his waist. A little further on\r\nstands the clean family, begging; the father with his head down as if\r\nin shame, and a box of lucifers held forth in his hand--the boys in\r\nnewly-washed pinafores, and the tidily got-up mother with a child at\r\nher breast. This stall is green and white with bunches of turnips--that\r\nred with apples, the next yellow with onions, and another purple with\r\npickling cabbages. One minute you pass a man with an umbrella turned\r\ninside up and full of prints; the next, you hear one with a peepshow\r\nof Mazeppa, and Paul Jones the pirate, describing the pictures to\r\nthe boys looking in at the little round windows. Then is heard the\r\nsharp snap of the percussion-cap from the crowd of lads firing at the\r\ntarget for nuts; and the moment afterwards, you see either a black\r\nman half-clad in white, and shivering in the cold with tracts in his\r\nhand, or else you hear the sounds of music from “Frazier’s Circus,” on\r\nthe other side of the road, and the man outside the door of the penny\r\nconcert, beseeching you to “Be in time--be in time!” as Mr. Somebody\r\nis just about to sing his favourite song of the “Knife Grinder.” Such,\r\nindeed, is the riot, the struggle, and the scramble for a living,\r\nthat the confusion and uproar of the New-cut on Saturday night have a\r\nbewildering and saddening effect upon the thoughtful mind.\r\n\r\nEach salesman tries his utmost to sell his wares, tempting the\r\npassers-by with his bargains. The boy with his stock of herbs offers\r\n“a double ’andful of fine parsley for a penny;” the man with the\r\ndonkey-cart filled with turnips has three lads to shout for him\r\nto their utmost, with their “Ho! ho! hi-i-i! What do you think of\r\nthis here? A penny a bunch--hurrah for free trade! _Here’s_ your\r\nturnips!” Until it is seen and heard, we have no sense of the\r\nscramble that is going on throughout London for a living. The same\r\nscene takes place at the Brill--the same in Leather-lane--the same in\r\nTottenham-court-road--the same in Whitecross-street; go to whatever\r\ncorner of the metropolis you please, either on a Saturday night or a\r\nSunday morning, and there is the same shouting and the same struggling\r\nto get the penny profit out of the poor man’s Sunday’s dinner.\r\n\r\nSince the above description was written, the New Cut has lost much\r\nof its noisy and brilliant glory. In consequence of a New Police\r\nregulation, “stands” or “pitches” have been forbidden, and each coster,\r\non a market night, is now obliged, under pain of the lock-up house, to\r\ncarry his tray, or keep moving with his barrow. The gay stalls have\r\nbeen replaced by deal boards, some sodden with wet fish, others stained\r\npurple with blackberries, or brown with walnut-peel; and the bright\r\nlamps are almost totally superseded by the dim, guttering candle. Even\r\nif the pole under the tray or “shallow” is seen resting on the ground,\r\nthe policeman on duty is obliged to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe mob of purchasers has diminished one-half; and instead of the road\r\nbeing filled with customers and trucks, the pavement and kerb-stones\r\nare scarcely crowded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNDAY MORNING MARKETS.\r\n\r\nNearly every poor man’s market does its Sunday trade. For a few hours\r\non the Sabbath morning, the noise, bustle, and scramble of the Saturday\r\nnight are repeated, and but for this opportunity many a poor family\r\nwould pass a dinnerless Sunday. The system of paying the mechanic late\r\non the Saturday night--and more particularly of paying a man his wages\r\nin a public-house--when he is tired with his day’s work, lures him to\r\nthe tavern, and there the hours fly quickly enough beside the warm\r\ntap-room fire, so that by the time the wife comes for her husband’s\r\nwages, she finds a large portion of them gone in drink, and the streets\r\nhalf cleared, so that the Sunday market is the only chance of getting\r\nthe Sunday’s dinner.\r\n\r\nOf all these Sunday-morning markets, the Brill, perhaps, furnishes the\r\nbusiest scene; so that it may be taken as a type of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe streets in the neighbourhood are quiet and empty. The shops are\r\nclosed with their different-coloured shutters, and the people round\r\nabout are dressed in the shiney cloth of the holiday suit. There are no\r\n“cabs,” and but few omnibuses to disturb the rest, and men walk in the\r\nroad as safely as on the footpath.\r\n\r\nAs you enter the Brill the market sounds are scarcely heard. But at\r\neach step the low hum grows gradually into the noisy shouting, until\r\nat last the different cries become distinct, and the hubbub, din, and\r\nconfusion of a thousand voices bellowing at once again fill the air.\r\nThe road and footpath are crowded, as on the over-night; the men are\r\nstanding in groups, smoking and talking; whilst the women run to and\r\nfro, some with the white round turnips showing out of their filled\r\naprons, others with cabbages under their arms, and a piece of red meat\r\ndangling from their hands. Only a few of the shops are closed, but the\r\nbutcher’s and the coal-shed are filled with customers, and from the\r\ndoor of the shut-up baker’s, the women come streaming forth with bags\r\nof flour in their hands, while men sally from the halfpenny barber’s\r\nsmoothing their clean-shaved chins. Walnuts, blacking, apples, onions,\r\nbraces, combs, turnips, herrings, pens, and corn-plaster, are all\r\nbellowed out at the same time. Labourers and mechanics, still unshorn\r\nand undressed, hang about with their hands in their pockets, some with\r\ntheir pet terriers under their arms. The pavement is green with the\r\nrefuse leaves of vegetables, and round a cabbage-barrow the women stand\r\nturning over the bunches, as the man shouts, “Where you like, only a\r\npenny.” Boys are running home with the breakfast herring held in a\r\npiece of paper, and the side-pocket of the apple-man’s stuff coat hangs\r\ndown with the weight of the halfpence stored within it. Presently the\r\ntolling of the neighbouring church bells breaks forth. Then the bustle\r\ndoubles itself, the cries grow louder, the confusion greater. Women run\r\nabout and push their way through the throng, scolding the saunterers,\r\nfor in half an hour the market will close. In a little time the butcher\r\nputs up his shutters, and leaves the door still open; the policemen in\r\ntheir clean gloves come round and drive the street-sellers before them,\r\nand as the clock strikes eleven the market finishes, and the Sunday’s\r\nrest begins.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the street-markets, and the number of\r\ncosters usually attending:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETS ON THE SURREY SIDE.\r\n\r\n  New-cut, Lambeth        300\r\n  Lambeth-walk            104\r\n  Walworth-road            22\r\n  Camberwell               15\r\n  Newington                45\r\n  Kent-street, Borough     38\r\n  Bermondsey              107\r\n  Union-street, Borough    29\r\n  Great Suffolk-street     46\r\n  Blackfriars-road         58\r\n                         ----\r\n                          764\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETS ON THE MIDDLESEX SIDE.\r\n\r\n  Brill and Chapel-st., Somers’ Town                300\r\n  Camden Town                                        50\r\n  Hampstead-rd. and Tottenham-ct.-rd.               333\r\n  St. George’s Market, Oxford-street                177\r\n  Marylebone                                         37\r\n  Edgeware-road                                      78\r\n  Crawford-street                                   145\r\n  Knightsbridge                                      46\r\n  Pimlico                                            32\r\n  Tothill-st. & Broadway, Westminster               119\r\n  Drury-lane                                         22\r\n  Clare-street                                      139\r\n  Exmouth-street and Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell  142\r\n  Leather-lane                                      150\r\n  St. John’s-street                                  47\r\n  Old-street (St. Luke’s)                            46\r\n  Whitecross-street, Cripplegate                    150\r\n  Islington                                          79\r\n  City-road                                          49\r\n  Shoreditch                                        100\r\n  Bethnal-green                                     100\r\n  Whitechapel                                       258\r\n  Mile End                                          105\r\n  Commercial-rd.

The total number of\r\nhucksters attending these markets is 3,911, giving an average of 105\r\nto each market.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS AND AMUSEMENTS OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI find it impossible to separate these two headings; for the habits\r\nof the costermonger are not domestic. His busy life is past in the\r\nmarkets or the streets, and as his leisure is devoted to the beer-shop,\r\nthe dancing-room, or the theatre, we must look for his habits to his\r\ndemeanour at those places. Home has few attractions to a man whose\r\nlife is a street-life. Even those who are influenced by family ties\r\nand affections, prefer to “home”--indeed that word is rarely mentioned\r\namong them--the conversation, warmth, and merriment of the beer-shop,\r\nwhere they can take their ease among their “mates.” Excitement or\r\namusement are indispensable to uneducated men. Of beer-shops resorted\r\nto by costermongers, and principally supported by them, it is computed\r\nthat there are 400 in London.\r\n\r\nThose who meet first in the beer-shop talk over the state of trade and\r\nof the markets, while the later comers enter at once into what may be\r\nstyled the serious business of the evening--amusement.\r\n\r\nBusiness topics are discussed in a most peculiar style. One man takes\r\nthe pipe from his mouth and says, “Bill made a doogheno hit this\r\nmorning.” “Jem,” says another, to a man just entering, “you’ll stand\r\na top o’ reeb?” “On,” answers Jem, “I’ve had a trosseno tol, and\r\nhave been doing dab.” For an explanation of what may be obscure in\r\nthis dialogue, I must refer my readers to my remarks concerning the\r\nlanguage of the class. If any strangers are present, the conversation\r\nis still further clothed in slang, so as to be unintelligible even to\r\nthe partially initiated. The evident puzzlement of any listener is of\r\ncourse gratifying to the costermonger’s vanity, for he feels that he\r\npossesses a knowledge peculiarly his own.\r\n\r\nAmong the in-door amusements of the costermonger is card-playing,\r\nat which many of them are adepts. The usual games are all-fours,\r\nall-fives, cribbage, and put. Whist is known to a few, but is never\r\nplayed, being considered dull and slow. Of short whist they have not\r\nheard; “but,” said one, whom I questioned on the subject, “if it’s come\r\ninto fashion, it’ll soon be among us.” The play is usually for beer,\r\nbut the game is rendered exciting by bets both among the players and\r\nthe lookers-on. “I’ll back Jem for a yanepatine,” says one. “Jack for a\r\ngen,” cries another. A penny is the lowest sum laid, and five shillings\r\ngenerally the highest, but a shilling is not often exceeded. “We play\r\nfair among ourselves,” said a costermonger to me--“aye, fairer than\r\nthe aristocrats--but we’ll take in anybody else.” Where it is known\r\nthat the landlord will not supply cards, “a sporting coster” carries a\r\npack or two with him. The cards played with have rarely been stamped;\r\nthey are generally dirty, and sometimes almost illegible, from long\r\nhandling and spilled beer. Some men will sit patiently for hours at\r\nthese games, and they watch the dealing round of the dingy cards\r\nintently, and without the attempt--common among politer gamesters--to\r\nappear indifferent, though they bear their losses well. In a full room\r\nof card-players, the groups are all shrouded in tobacco-smoke, and from\r\nthem are heard constant sounds--according to the games they are engaged\r\nin--of “I’m low, and Ped’s high.” “Tip and me’s game.” “Fifteen four\r\nand a flush of five.” I may remark it is curious that costermongers,\r\nwho can neither read nor write, and who have no knowledge of the\r\nmultiplication table, are skilful in all the intricacies and\r\ncalculations of cribbage. There is not much quarrelling over the cards,\r\nunless strangers play with them, and then the costermongers all take\r\npart one with another, fairly or unfairly.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that there is a close resemblance between many of the\r\ncharacteristics of a very high class, socially, and a very low class.\r\nThose who remember the disclosures on a trial a few years back, as to\r\nhow men of rank and wealth passed their leisure in card-playing--many\r\nof their lives being one continued leisure--can judge how far the\r\nanalogy holds when the card-passion of the costermongers is described.\r\n\r\n“Shove-halfpenny” is another game played by them; so is “Three up.”\r\nThree halfpennies are thrown up, and when they fall all “heads” or all\r\n“tails,” it is a mark; and the man who gets the greatest number of\r\nmarks out of a given amount--three, or five, or more--wins. “Three-up”\r\nis played fairly among the costermongers; but is most frequently\r\nresorted to when strangers are present to “make a pitch,”--which is, in\r\nplain words, to cheat any stranger who is rash enough to bet upon them.\r\n“This is the way, sir,” said an adept to me; “bless you, I can make\r\nthem fall as I please. If I’m playing with Jo, and a stranger bets with\r\nJo, why, of course, I make Jo win.” This adept illustrated his skill\r\nto me by throwing up three halfpennies, and, five times out of six,\r\nthey fell upon the floor, whether he threw them nearly to the ceiling\r\nor merely to his shoulder, all heads or all tails. The halfpence were\r\nthe proper current coins--indeed, they were my own; and the result\r\nis gained by a peculiar position of the coins on the fingers, and a\r\npeculiar jerk in the throwing. There was an amusing manifestation of\r\nthe pride of art in the way in which my obliging informant displayed\r\nhis skill.\r\n\r\n“Skittles” is another favourite amusement, and the costermongers class\r\nthemselves among the best players in London. The game is always for\r\nbeer, but betting goes on.\r\n\r\nA fondness for “sparring” and “boxing” lingers among the rude members\r\nof some classes of the working men, such as the tanners. With the great\r\nmajority of the costermongers this fondness is still as dominant as it\r\nwas among the “higher classes,” when boxers were the pets of princes\r\nand nobles. The sparring among the costers is not for money, but for\r\nbeer and “a lark”--a convenient word covering much mischief. Two out\r\nof every ten landlords, whose houses are patronised by these lovers of\r\n“the art of self-defence,” supply gloves. Some charge 2_d._ a night\r\nfor their use; others only 1_d._ The sparring seldom continues long,\r\nsometimes not above a quarter of an hour; for the costermongers, though\r\nexcited for a while, weary of sports in which they cannot personally\r\nparticipate, and in the beer-shops only two spar at a time, though\r\nfifty or sixty may be present. The shortness of the duration of this\r\npastime may be one reason why it seldom leads to quarrelling. The stake\r\nis usually a “top of reeb,” and the winner is the man who gives the\r\nfirst “noser;” a _bloody_ nose however is required to show that the\r\nblow was veritably a noser. The costermongers boast of their skill in\r\npugilism as well as at skittles. “We are all handy with our fists,”\r\nsaid one man, “and are matches, aye, and more than matches, for anybody\r\nbut reg’lar boxers. We’ve stuck to the ring, too, and gone reg’lar to\r\nthe fights, more than any other men.”\r\n\r\n“Twopenny-hops” are much resorted to by the costermongers, men and\r\nwomen, boys and girls. At these dances decorum is sometimes, but not\r\noften, violated. “The women,” I was told by one man, “doesn’t show\r\ntheir necks as I’ve seen the ladies do in them there pictures of high\r\nlife in the shop-winders, or on the stage. Their Sunday gowns, which\r\nis their dancing gowns, ain’t made that way.” At these “hops” the\r\nclog-hornpipe is often danced, and sometimes a collection is made\r\nto ensure the performance of a first-rate professor of that dance;\r\nsometimes, and more frequently, it is volunteered gratuitously. The\r\nother dances are jigs, “flash jigs”--hornpipes in fetters--a dance\r\nrendered popular by the success of the acted “Jack Sheppard”--polkas,\r\nand country-dances, the last-mentioned being generally demanded by\r\nthe women. Waltzes are as yet unknown to them. Sometimes they do the\r\n“pipe-dance.” For this a number of tobacco-pipes, about a dozen, are\r\nlaid close together on the floor, and the dancer places the toe of his\r\nboot between the different pipes, keeping time with the music. Two\r\nof the pipes are arranged as a cross, and the toe has to be inserted\r\nbetween each of the angles, without breaking them. The numbers present\r\nat these “hops” vary from 30 to 100 of both sexes, their ages being\r\nfrom 14 to 45, and the female sex being slightly predominant as to the\r\nproportion of those in attendance. At these “hops” there is nothing\r\nof the leisurely style of dancing--half a glide and half a skip--but\r\nvigorous, laborious capering. The hours are from half-past eight to\r\ntwelve, sometimes to one or two in the morning, and never later than\r\ntwo, as the costermongers are early risers. There is sometimes a good\r\ndeal of drinking; some of the young girls being often pressed to drink,\r\nand frequently yielding to the temptation. From 1_l._ to 7_l._ is\r\nspent in drink at a hop; the youngest men or lads present spend the\r\nmost, especially in that act of costermonger politeness--“treating\r\nthe gals.” The music is always a fiddle, sometimes with the addition\r\nof a harp and a cornopean. The band is provided by the costermongers,\r\nto whom the assembly is confined; but during the present and the last\r\nyear, when the costers’ earnings have been less than the average, the\r\nlandlord has provided the harp, whenever that instrument has added to\r\nthe charms of the fiddle. Of one use to which these “hops” are put I\r\nhave given an account, under the head of “Marriage.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONDON COSTERMONGER.\r\n\r\n“Here Pertaters! Kearots and Turnups! Fine Brockello-o-o!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe other amusements of this class of the community are the theatre\r\nand the penny concert, and their visits are almost entirely confined\r\nto the galleries of the theatres on the Surrey-side--the Surrey, the\r\nVictoria, the Bower Saloon, and (but less frequently) Astley’s. Three\r\ntimes a week is an average attendance at theatres and dances by the\r\nmore prosperous costermongers. The most intelligent man I met with\r\namong them gave me the following account. He classes himself with the\r\nmany, but his tastes are really those of an educated man:--“Love and\r\nmurder suits us best, sir; but within these few years I think there’s\r\na great deal more liking for deep tragedies among us. They set men a\r\nthinking; but then we all consider them too long. Of _Hamlet_ we can\r\nmake neither end nor side; and nine out of ten of us--ay, far more\r\nthan that--would like it to be confined to the ghost scenes, and the\r\nfuneral, and the killing off at the last. _Macbeth_ would be better\r\nliked, if it was only the witches and the fighting. The high words in a\r\ntragedy we call jaw-breakers, and say we can’t tumble to that barrikin.\r\nWe always stay to the last, because we’ve paid for it all, or very few\r\ncosters would see a tragedy out if any money was returned to those\r\nleaving after two or three acts. We are fond of music. Nigger music was\r\nvery much liked among us, but it’s stale now. Flash songs are liked,\r\nand sailors’ songs, and patriotic songs. Most costers--indeed, I can’t\r\ncall to mind an exception--listen very quietly to songs that they don’t\r\nin the least understand. We have among us translations of the patriotic\r\nFrench songs. ‘Mourir pour la patrie’ is very popular, and so is the\r\n‘Marseillaise.’ A song to take hold of us must have a good chorus.”\r\n“They like something, sir, that is worth hearing,” said one of my\r\ninformants, “such as the ‘Soldier’s Dream,’ ‘The Dream of Napoleon,’ or\r\n‘I ’ad a dream--an ’appy dream.’”\r\n\r\nThe songs in ridicule of Marshal Haynau, and in laudation of Barclay\r\nand Perkin’s draymen, were and are very popular among the costers;\r\nbut none are more popular than Paul Jones--“A noble commander, Paul\r\nJones was his name.” Among them the chorus of “Britons never shall be\r\nslaves,” is often rendered “Britons always shall be slaves.” The most\r\npopular of all songs with the class, however, is “Duck-legged Dick,” of\r\nwhich I give the first verse.\r\n\r\n  “Duck-legged Dick had a donkey,\r\n    And his lush loved much for to swill,\r\n  One day he got rather lumpy,\r\n    And got sent seven days to the mill.\r\n  His donkey was taken to the green-yard,\r\n    A fate which he never deserved.\r\n  Oh! it was such a regular mean yard,\r\n    That alas! the poor moke got starved.\r\n  Oh! bad luck can’t be prevented,\r\n    Fortune she smiles or she frowns,\r\n  He’s best off that’s contented,\r\n    To mix, sirs, the ups and the downs.”\r\n\r\nTheir sports, are enjoyed the more, if they are dangerous and require\r\nboth courage and dexterity to succeed in them. They prefer, if crossing\r\na bridge, to climb over the parapet, and walk along on the stone\r\ncoping. When a house is building, rows of coster lads will climb up the\r\nlong ladders, leaning against the unslated roof, and then slide down\r\nagain, each one resting on the other’s shoulders. A peep show with a\r\nbattle scene is sure of its coster audience, and a favourite pastime\r\nis fighting with cheap theatrical swords. They are, however, true to\r\neach other, and should a coster, who is the hero of his court, fall ill\r\nand go to a hospital, the whole of the inhabitants of his quarter will\r\nvisit him on the Sunday, and take him presents of various articles so\r\nthat “he may live well.”\r\n\r\nAmong the men, rat-killing is a favourite sport. They will enter an\r\nold stable, fasten the door and then turn out the rats. Or they will\r\nfind out some unfrequented yard, and at night time build up a pit with\r\napple-case boards, and lighting up their lamps, enjoy the sport. Nearly\r\nevery coster is fond of dogs. Some fancy them greatly, and are proud\r\nof making them fight. If when out working, they see a handsome stray,\r\nwhether he is a “toy” or “sporting” dog, they whip him up--many of the\r\nclass not being _very_ particular whether the animals are stray or not.\r\n\r\nTheir dog fights are both cruel and frequent. It is not uncommon to see\r\na lad walking with the trembling legs of a dog shivering under a bloody\r\nhandkerchief, that covers the bitten and wounded body of an animal\r\nthat has been figuring at some “match.” These fights take place on the\r\nsly--the tap-room or back-yard of a beer-shop, being generally chosen\r\nfor the purpose. A few men are let into the secret, and they attend to\r\nbet upon the winner, the police being carefully kept from the spot.\r\n\r\nPigeons are “fancied” to a large extent, and are kept in lath cages on\r\nthe roofs of the houses. The lads look upon a visit to the Red-house,\r\nBattersea, where the pigeon-shooting takes place, as a great treat.\r\nThey stand without the hoarding that encloses the ground, and watch for\r\nthe wounded pigeons to fall, when a violent scramble takes place among\r\nthem, each bird being valued at 3_d._ or 4_d._ So popular has this\r\nsport become, that some boys take dogs with them trained to retrieve\r\nthe birds, and two Lambeth costers attend regularly after their\r\nmorning’s work with their guns, to shoot those that escape the ‘shots’\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nA good pugilist is looked up to with great admiration by the costers,\r\nand fighting is considered to be a necessary part of a boy’s education.\r\nAmong them cowardice in any shape is despised as being degrading and\r\nloathsome, indeed the man who would avoid a fight, is scouted by the\r\nwhole of the court he lives in. Hence it is important for a lad and\r\neven a girl to know how to “work their fists well”--as expert boxing\r\nis called among them. If a coster man or woman is struck they are\r\nobliged to fight. When a quarrel takes place between two boys, a ring\r\nis formed, and the men urge them on to have it out, for they hold that\r\nit is a wrong thing to stop a battle, as it causes bad blood for life;\r\nwhereas, if the lads fight it out they shake hands and forget all about\r\nit. Everybody practises fighting, and the man who has the largest and\r\nhardest muscle is spoken of in terms of the highest commendation. It\r\nis often said in admiration of such a man that “he could muzzle half a\r\ndozen bobbies before breakfast.”\r\n\r\nTo serve out a policeman is the bravest act by which a costermonger\r\ncan distinguish himself. Some lads have been imprisoned upwards of\r\na dozen times for this offence; and are consequently looked upon by\r\ntheir companions as martyrs. When they leave prison for such an act,\r\na subscription is often got up for their benefit. In their continual\r\nwarfare with the force, they resemble many savage nations, from\r\nthe cunning and treachery they use. The lads endeavour to take the\r\nunsuspecting “crusher” by surprise, and often crouch at the entrance of\r\na court until a policeman passes, when a stone or a brick is hurled at\r\nhim, and the youngster immediately disappears. Their love of revenge\r\ntoo, is extreme--their hatred being in no way mitigated by time;\r\nthey will wait for months, following a policeman who has offended or\r\nwronged them, anxiously looking out for an opportunity of paying back\r\nthe injury. One boy, I was told, vowed vengeance against a member of\r\nthe force, and for six months never allowed the man to escape his\r\nnotice. At length, one night, he saw the policeman in a row outside a\r\npublic-house, and running into the crowd kicked him savagely, shouting\r\nat the same time: “Now, you b----, I’ve got you at last.” When the boy\r\nheard that his persecutor was injured for life, his joy was very great,\r\nand he declared the twelvemonth’s imprisonment he was sentenced to\r\nfor the offence to be “dirt cheap.” The whole of the court where the\r\nlad resided sympathized with the boy, and vowed to a man, that had he\r\nescaped, they would have subscribed a pad or two of dry herrings, to\r\nsend him into the country until the affair had blown over, for he had\r\nshown himself a “plucky one.”\r\n\r\nIt is called “plucky” to bear pain without complaining. To flinch\r\nfrom expected suffering is scorned, and he who does so is sneered at\r\nand told to wear a gown, as being more fit to be a woman. To show a\r\ndisregard for pain, a lad, when without money, will say to his pal,\r\n“Give us a penny, and you may have a punch at my nose.” They also\r\ndelight in tattooing their chests and arms with anchors, and figures\r\nof different kinds. During the whole of this painful operation, the boy\r\nwill not flinch, but laugh and joke with his admiring companions, as if\r\nperfectly at ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMBLING OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find in the whole of this numerous class, a\r\nyoungster who is not--what may be safely called--a desperate gambler.\r\nAt the age of fourteen this love of play first comes upon the lad, and\r\nfrom that time until he is thirty or so, not a Sunday passes but he is\r\nat his stand on the gambling ground. Even if he has no money to stake,\r\nhe will loll away the morning looking on, and so borrow excitement\r\nfrom the successes of others. Every attempt made by the police, to\r\ncheck this ruinous system, has been unavailing, and has rather given a\r\ngloss of daring courage to the sport, that tends to render it doubly\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nIf a costermonger has an hour to spare, his first thought is to gamble\r\naway the time. He does not care what he plays for, so long as he can\r\nhave a chance of winning something. Whilst waiting for a market to\r\nopen, his delight is to find out some pieman and toss him for his\r\nstock, though, by so doing, he risks his market-money and only chance\r\nof living, to win that which he will give away to the first friend he\r\nmeets. For the whole week the boy will work untiringly, spurred on by\r\nthe thought of the money to be won on the Sunday. Nothing will damp his\r\nardour for gambling, the most continued ill-fortune making him even\r\nmore reckless than if he were the luckiest man alive.\r\n\r\nMany a lad who had gone down to the gambling ground, with a good warm\r\ncoat upon his back and his pocket well filled from the Saturday night’s\r\nmarket, will leave it at evening penniless and coatless, having lost\r\nall his earnings, stock-money, and the better part of his clothing.\r\nSome of the boys, when desperate with “bad luck,” borrow to the\r\nutmost limit of their credit; then they mortgage their “king’s-man”\r\nor neck-tie, and they will even change their cord trousers, if better\r\nthan those of the winner, so as to have one more chance at the turn of\r\nfortune. The coldest winter’s day will not stop the Sunday’s gathering\r\non the river-side, for the heat of play warms them in spite of the\r\nsharp wind blowing down the Thames. If the weather be wet, so that the\r\nhalf-pence stick to the ground, they find out some railway-arch or else\r\na beer-shop, and having filled the tap-room with their numbers, they\r\nmuffle the table with handkerchiefs, and play secretly. When the game\r\nis very exciting, they will even forget their hunger, and continue\r\nto gamble until it is too dark to see, before they think of eating.\r\nOne man told me, that when he was working the races with lemonade,\r\nhe had often seen in the centre of a group, composed of costers,\r\nthimble-riggers and showmen, as much as 100_l._ on the ground at one\r\ntime, in gold and silver. A friend of his, who had gone down in company\r\nwith him, with a pony-truck of toys, lost in less than an hour his\r\nearnings, truck, stock of goods, and great-coat. Vowing to have his\r\nrevenge next time, he took his boy on his back, and started off on the\r\ntramp to London, there to borrow sufficient money to bring down a fresh\r\nlot of goods on the morrow, and then gamble away his earnings as before.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly immaterial to the coster with whom he plays, whether it\r\nbe a lad from the Lambeth potteries, or a thief from the Westminster\r\nslums. Very often, too, the gamblers of one costermonger district,\r\nwill visit those of another, and work what is called “a plant” in this\r\nway. One of the visitors will go before hand, and, joining a group of\r\ngamblers, commence tossing. When sufficient time has elapsed to remove\r\nall suspicion of companionship, his mate will come up and commence\r\nbetting on each of his pals’ throws with those standing round. By a\r\ncurious quickness of hand, a coster can make the toss tell favourably\r\nfor his wagering friend, who meets him after the play is over in the\r\nevening, and shares the spoil.\r\n\r\nThe spots generally chosen for the Sunday’s sport are in secret\r\nplaces, half-hidden from the eye of the passers, where a scout can\r\ngive quick notice of the approach of the police: in the fields about\r\nKing’s-cross, or near any unfinished railway buildings. The Mint, St.\r\nGeorge’s-fields, Blackfriars’-road, Bethnal-green, and Marylebone,\r\nare all favourite resorts. Between Lambeth and Chelsea, the shingle\r\non the left side of the Thames, is spotted with small rings of lads,\r\nhalf-hidden behind the barges. One boy (of the party) is always on\r\nthe look out, and even if a stranger should advance, the cry is given\r\nof “Namous” or “Kool Eslop.” Instantly the money is whipped-up and\r\npocketed, and the boys stand chattering and laughing together. It is\r\nnever difficult for a coster to find out where the gambling parties\r\nare, for he has only to stop the first lad he meets, and ask him where\r\nthe “erht pu” or “three up” is going on, to discover their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nIf during the game a cry of “Police!” should be given by the\r\nlooker-out, instantly a rush at the money is made by any one in the\r\ngroup, the costers preferring that a stranger should have the money\r\nrather than the policeman. There is also a custom among them, that\r\nthe ruined player should be started again by a gift of 2_d._ in every\r\nshilling lost, or, if the loss is heavy, a present of four or five\r\nshillings is made; neither is it considered at all dishonourable for\r\nthe party winning to leave with the full bloom of success upon him.\r\n\r\nThat the description of one of these Sunday scenes might be more\r\ntruthful, a visit was paid to a gambling-ring close to ----. Although\r\nnot twenty yards distant from the steam-boat pier, yet the little\r\nparty was so concealed among the coal-barges, that not a head could\r\nbe seen. The spot chosen was close to a small narrow court, leading\r\nfrom the street to the water-side, and here the lad on the look-out\r\nwas stationed. There were about thirty young fellows, some tall\r\nstrapping youths, in the costers’ cable-cord costume,--others, mere\r\nboys, in rags, from the potteries, with their clothes stained with\r\nclay. The party was hidden from the river by the black dredger-boats\r\non the beach; and it was so arranged, that should the alarm be given,\r\nthey might leap into the coal-barges, and hide until the intruder\r\nhad retired. Seated on some oars stretched across two craft, was a\r\nmortar-stained bricklayer, keeping a look-out towards the river, and\r\nacting as a sort of umpire in all disputes. The two that were tossing\r\nhad been playing together since early morning; and it was easy to tell\r\nwhich was the loser, by the anxious-looking eye and compressed lip. He\r\nwas quarrelsome too; and if the crowd pressed upon him, he would jerk\r\nhis elbow back savagely, saying, “I wish to C----t you’d stand backer.”\r\nThe winner, a short man, in a mud-stained canvas jacket, and a week’s\r\nyellow beard on his chin, never spake a word beyond his “heads,” or\r\n“tails;” but his cheeks were red, and the pipe in his mouth was unlit,\r\nthough he puffed at it.\r\n\r\nIn their hands they each held a long row of halfpence, extending to\r\nthe wrist, and topped by shillings and half-crowns. Nearly every one\r\nround had coppers in his hands, and bets were made and taken as rapidly\r\nas they could be spoken. “I lost a sov. last night in less than no\r\ntime,” said one man, who, with his hands in his pockets, was looking\r\non; “never mind--I musn’t have no wenson this week, and try again next\r\nSunday.”\r\n\r\nThe boy who was losing was adopting every means to “bring back his\r\nluck again.” Before crying, he would toss up a halfpenny three times,\r\nto see what he should call. At last, with an oath, he pushed aside the\r\nboys round him, and shifted his place, to see what that would do; it\r\nhad a good effect, for he won toss after toss in a curiously fortunate\r\nway, and then it was strange to watch his mouth gradually relax and\r\nhis brows unknit. His opponent was a little startled, and passing his\r\nfingers through his dusty hair, said, with a stupid laugh, “Well, I\r\nnever see the likes.” The betting also began to shift. “Sixpence Ned\r\nwins!” cried three or four; “Sixpence he loses!” answered another;\r\n“Done!” and up went the halfpence. “Half-a-crown Joe loses!”--“Here\r\nyou are,” answered Joe, but he lost again. “I’ll try you a ‘gen’”\r\n(shilling) said a coster; “And a ‘rouf yenap’” (fourpence), added the\r\nother. “Say a ‘exes’” (sixpence).--“Done!” and the betting continued,\r\ntill the ground was spotted with silver and halfpence.\r\n\r\n“That’s ten bob he’s won in five minutes,” said Joe (the loser),\r\nlooking round with a forced smile; but Ned (the winner) never spake a\r\nword, even when he gave any change to his antagonist; and if he took\r\na bet, he only nodded to the one that offered it, and threw down his\r\nmoney. Once, when he picked up more than a sovereign from the ground,\r\nthat he had won in one throw, a washed sweep, with a black rim round\r\nhis neck, said, “There’s a hog!” but there wasn’t even a smile at the\r\njoke. At last Joe began to feel angry, and stamping his foot till the\r\nwater squirted up from the beach, cried, “It’s no use; luck’s set in\r\nhim--he’d muck a thousand!” and so he shifted his ground, and betted\r\nall round on the chance of better fortune attending the movement. He\r\nlost again, and some one bantering said, “You’ll win the shine-rag,\r\nJoe,” meaning that he would be “cracked up,” or ruined, if he continued.\r\n\r\nWhen one o’clock struck, a lad left, saying, he was “going to get an\r\ninside lining” (dinner). The sweep asked him what he was going to have.\r\n“A two-and-half plate, and a ha’p’orth of smash” (a plate of soup and\r\na ha’p’orth of mashed potatoes), replied the lad, bounding into the\r\ncourt. Nobody else seemed to care for his dinner, for all stayed to\r\nwatch the gamblers.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then some one would go up the court to see if the lad\r\nwatching for the police was keeping a good look-out; but the boy never\r\ndeserted his post, for fear of losing his threepence. If he had, such\r\nis the wish to protect the players felt by every lad, that even whilst\r\nat dinner, one of them, if he saw a policeman pass, would spring up and\r\nrush to the gambling ring to give notice.\r\n\r\nWhen the tall youth, “Ned,” had won nearly all the silver of the group,\r\nhe suddenly jerked his gains into his coat-pocket, and saying, “I’ve\r\ndone,” walked off, and was out of sight in an instant. The surprise of\r\nthe loser and all around was extreme. They looked at the court where he\r\nhad disappeared, then at one another, and at last burst out into one\r\nexpression of disgust. “There’s a scurf!” said one; “He’s a regular\r\nscab,” cried another; and a coster declared that he was “a trosseno,\r\nand no mistake.” For although it is held to be fair for the winner to\r\ngo whenever he wishes, yet such conduct is never relished by the losers.\r\n\r\nIt was then determined that “they would have him to rights” the next\r\ntime he came to gamble; for every one would set at him, and win his\r\nmoney, and then “turn up,” as he had done.\r\n\r\nThe party was then broken up, the players separating to wait for the\r\nnew-comers that would be sure to pour in after dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n“VIC. GALLERY.”\r\n\r\nOn a good attractive night, the rush of costers to the threepenny\r\ngallery of the Coburg (better known as “the Vic”) is peculiar and\r\nalmost awful.\r\n\r\nThe long zig-zag staircase that leads to the pay box is crowded to\r\nsuffocation at least an hour before the theatre is opened; but, on the\r\noccasion of a piece with a good murder in it, the crowd will frequently\r\ncollect as early as three o’clock in the afternoon. Lads stand upon the\r\nbroad wooden bannisters about 50 feet from the ground, and jump on each\r\nothers’ backs, or adopt any expedient they can think of to obtain a\r\ngood place.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the well-staircase having a remarkably fine echo, and the\r\nwooden floor of the steps serving as a sounding board, the shouting,\r\nwhistling, and quarrelling of the impatient young costers is increased\r\ntenfold. If, as sometimes happens, a song with a chorus is started,\r\nthe ears positively ache with the din, and when the chant has finished\r\nit seems as though a sudden silence had fallen on the people. To the\r\ncentre of the road, and all round the door, the mob is in a ferment of\r\nexcitement, and no sooner is the money-taker at his post than the most\r\nfrightful rush takes place, every one heaving with his shoulder at the\r\nback of the person immediately in front of him. The girls shriek, men\r\nshout, and a nervous fear is felt lest the massive staircase should\r\nfall in with the weight of the throng, as it lately did with the most\r\nterrible results. If a hat tumbles from the top of the staircase, a\r\nhundred hands snatch at it as it descends. When it is caught a voice\r\nroars above the tumult, “All right, Bill, I’ve got it”--for they all\r\nseem to know one another--“Keep us a pitch and I’ll bring it.”\r\n\r\nTo any one unaccustomed to be pressed flat it would be impossible\r\nto enter with the mob. To see the sight in the gallery it is better\r\nto wait until the first piece is over. The ham-sandwich men and\r\npig-trotter women will give you notice when the time is come, for with\r\nthe first clatter of the descending footsteps they commence their cries.\r\n\r\nThere are few grown-up men that go to the “Vic” gallery. The generality\r\nof the visitors are lads from about twelve to three-and-twenty, and\r\nthough a few black-faced sweeps or whitey-brown dustmen may be among\r\nthe throng, the gallery audience consists mainly of costermongers.\r\nYoung girls, too, are very plentiful, only one-third of whom now take\r\ntheir babies, owing to the new regulation of charging half-price for\r\ninfants. At the foot of the staircase stands a group of boys begging\r\nfor the return checks, which they sell again for 1-1/2_d._ or 1_d._,\r\naccording to the lateness of the hour.\r\n\r\nAt each step up the well-staircase the warmth and stench increase,\r\nuntil by the time one reaches the gallery doorway, a furnace-heat\r\nrushes out through the entrance that seems to force you backwards,\r\nwhilst the odour positively prevents respiration. The mob on the\r\nlanding, standing on tiptoe and closely wedged together, resists any\r\ncivil attempt at gaining a glimpse of the stage, and yet a coster lad\r\nwill rush up, elbow his way into the crowd, then jump up on to the\r\nshoulders of those before him, and suddenly disappear into the body of\r\nthe gallery.\r\n\r\nThe gallery at “the Vic” is one of the largest in London. It will hold\r\nfrom 1500 to 2000 people, and runs back to so great a distance, that\r\nthe end of it is lost in shadow, excepting where the little gas-jets,\r\nagainst the wall, light up the two or three faces around them. When the\r\ngallery is well packed, it is usual to see piles of boys on each others\r\nshoulders at the back, while on the partition boards, dividing off the\r\nslips, lads will pitch themselves, despite the spikes.\r\n\r\nAs you look up the vast slanting mass of heads from the upper boxes,\r\neach one appears on the move. The huge black heap, dotted with faces,\r\nand spotted with white shirt sleeves, almost pains the eye to look at,\r\nand should a clapping of hands commence, the twinkling nearly blinds\r\nyou. It is the fashion with the mob to take off their coats; and the\r\ncross-braces on the backs of some, and the bare shoulders peeping out\r\nof the ragged shirts of others, are the only variety to be found. The\r\nbonnets of the “ladies” are hung over the iron railing in front, their\r\nnumbers nearly hiding the panels, and one of the amusements of the lads\r\nin the back seats consists in pitching orange peel or nutshells into\r\nthem, a good aim being rewarded with a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\nWhen the orchestra begins playing, before “the gods” have settled into\r\ntheir seats, it is impossible to hear a note of music. The puffed-out\r\ncheeks of the trumpeters, and the raised drumsticks tell you that the\r\noverture has commenced, but no tune is to be heard. An occasional burst\r\nof the full band being caught by gushes, as if a high wind were raging.\r\nRecognitions take place every moment, and “Bill Smith” is called to\r\nin a loud voice from one side, and a shout in answer from the other\r\nasks “What’s up?” Or family secrets are revealed, and “Bob Triller” is\r\nasked where “Sal” is, and replies amid a roar of laughter, that she is\r\n“a-larning the pynanney.”\r\n\r\nBy-and-by a youngster, who has come in late, jumps up over the\r\nshoulders at the door, and doubling himself into a ball, rolls down\r\nover the heads in front, leaving a trail of commotion for each one\r\nas he passes aims a blow at the fellow. Presently a fight is sure to\r\nbegin, and then every one rises from his seat whistling and shouting;\r\nthree or four pairs of arms fall to, the audience waving their hands\r\ntill the moving mass seems like microscopic eels in paste. But the\r\ncommotion ceases suddenly on the rising of the curtain, and then the\r\ncries of “Silence!” “Ord-a-a-r!” “Ord-a-a-r!” make more noise than ever.\r\n\r\nThe “Vic” gallery is not to be moved by touching sentiment. They prefer\r\nvigorous exercise to any emotional speech. “The Child of the Storm’s”\r\ndeclaration that she would share her father’s “death or imprisonment\r\nas her duty,” had no effect at all, compared with the split in the\r\nhornpipe. The shrill whistling and brayvos that followed the tar’s\r\nperformance showed how highly it was relished, and one “god” went so\r\nfar as to ask “how it was done.” The comic actor kicking a dozen Polish\r\npeasants was encored, but the grand banquet of the Czar of all the\r\nRussias only produced merriment, and a request that he would “give them\r\na bit” was made directly the Emperor took the willow-patterned plate in\r\nhis hand. All affecting situations were sure to be interrupted by cries\r\nof “orda-a-r;” and the lady begging for her father’s life was told to\r\n“speak up old gal;” though when the heroine of the “dummestic dreamer”\r\n(as they call it) told the general of all the Cossack forces “not to be\r\na fool,” the uproar of approbation grew greater than ever,--and when\r\nthe lady turned up her swan’s-down cuffs, and seizing four Russian\r\nsoldiers shook them successively by the collar, then the enthusiasm\r\nknew no bounds, and the cries of “Bray-vo Vincent! Go it my tulip!”\r\nresounded from every throat.\r\n\r\nAltogether the gallery audience do not seem to be of a gentle nature.\r\nOne poor little lad shouted out in a crying tone, “that he couldn’t\r\nsee,” and instantly a dozen voices demanded “that he should be thrown\r\nover.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the pieces are going on, brown, flat bottles are frequently\r\nraised to the mouth, and between the acts a man with a tin can,\r\nglittering in the gas-light, goes round crying, “Port-a-a-a-r! who’s\r\nfor port-a-a-a-r.” As the heat increased the faces grew bright red,\r\nevery bonnet was taken off, and ladies could be seen wiping the\r\nperspiration from their cheeks with the play-bills.\r\n\r\nNo delay between the pieces will be allowed, and should the\r\ninterval appear too long, some one will shout out--referring to the\r\ncurtain--“Pull up that there winder blind!” or they will call to the\r\norchestra, saying, “Now then you catgut-scrapers! Let’s have a ha’purth\r\nof liveliness.” Neither will they suffer a play to proceed until they\r\nhave a good view of the stage, and “Higher the blue,” is constantly\r\nshouted, when the sky is too low, or “Light up the moon,” when the\r\ntransparency is rather dim.\r\n\r\nThe dances and comic songs, between the pieces, are liked better than\r\nanything else. A highland fling is certain to be repeated, and a\r\nstamping of feet will accompany the tune, and a shrill whistling, keep\r\ntime through the entire performance.\r\n\r\nBut the grand hit of the evening is always when a song is sung to which\r\nthe entire gallery can join in chorus. Then a deep silence prevails\r\nall through the stanzas. Should any burst in before his time, a shout\r\nof “orda-a-r” is raised, and the intruder put down by a thousand\r\nindignant cries. At the proper time, however, the throats of the mob\r\nburst forth in all their strength. The most deafening noise breaks\r\nout suddenly, while the cat-calls keep up the tune, and an imitation\r\nof a dozen Mr. Punches squeak out the words. Some actors at the minor\r\ntheatres make a great point of this, and in the bill upon the night of\r\nmy visit, under the title of “There’s a good time coming, boys,” there\r\nwas printed, “assisted by the most numerous and effective chorus in\r\nthe metropolis--” meaning the whole of the gallery. The singer himself\r\nstarted the mob, saying, “Now then, the Exeter Hall touch if you please\r\ngentlemen,” and beat time with his hand, parodying M. Jullien with\r\nhis _baton_. An “angcore” on such occasions is always demanded, and,\r\ndespite a few murmurs of “change it to ‘Duck-legged Dick,’” invariably\r\ninsisted on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICS OF COSTERMONGERS.--POLICEMEN.\r\n\r\nThe notion of the police is so intimately blended with what may be\r\ncalled the politics of the costermongers that I give them together.\r\n\r\nThe politics of these people are detailed in a few words--they\r\nare nearly all Chartists. “You might say, sir,” remarked one of\r\nmy informants, “that they _all_ were Chartists, but as its better\r\nyou should rather be under than over the mark, say _nearly_ all.”\r\nTheir ignorance, and their being impulsive, makes them a dangerous\r\nclass. I am assured that in every district where the costermongers\r\nare congregated, one or two of the body, more intelligent than the\r\nothers, have great influence over them; and these leading men are all\r\nChartists, and being industrious and not unprosperous persons, their\r\npecuniary and intellectual superiority cause them to be regarded\r\nas oracles. One of these men said to me: “The costers think that\r\nworking-men know best, and so they have confidence in us. I like to\r\nmake men discontented, and I will make them discontented while the\r\npresent system continues, because it’s all for the middle and the\r\nmoneyed classes, and nothing, in the way of rights, for the poor.\r\nPeople fancy when all’s quiet that all’s stagnating. Propagandism is\r\ngoing on for all that. It’s when all’s quiet that the seed’s a growing.\r\nRepublicans and Socialists are pressing their doctrines.”\r\n\r\nThe costermongers have very vague notions of an aristocracy; they call\r\nthe more prosperous of their own body “aristocrats.” Their notions of\r\nan aristocracy of birth or wealth seem to be formed on their opinion of\r\nthe rich, or reputed rich salesmen with whom they deal; and the result\r\nis anything but favourable to the nobility.\r\n\r\nConcerning free-trade, nothing, I am told, can check the costermongers’\r\nfervour for a cheap loaf. A Chartist costermonger told me that he\r\nknew numbers of costers who were keen Chartists without understanding\r\nanything about the six points.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers frequently attend political meetings, going there\r\nin bodies of from six to twelve. Some of them, I learned, could not\r\nunderstand why Chartist leaders exhorted them to peace and quietness,\r\nwhen they might as well fight it out with the police at once. The\r\ncosters boast, moreover, that they stick more together in any “row”\r\nthan any other class. It is considered by them a reflection on the\r\ncharacter of the thieves that they are seldom true to one another.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of marvel to many of this class that people can live\r\nwithout working. The ignorant costers have no knowledge of “property,”\r\nor “income,” and conclude that the non-workers all live out of the\r\ntaxes. Of the taxes generally they judge from their knowledge that\r\ntobacco, which they account a necessary of life, pays 3_s._ per lb.\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nAs regards the police, the hatred of a costermonger to a “peeler” is\r\nintense, and with their opinion of the police, all the more ignorant\r\nunite that of the governing power. “Can you wonder at it, sir,” said a\r\ncostermonger to me, “that I hate the police? They drive us about, we\r\nmust move on, we can’t stand here, and we can’t pitch there. But if\r\nwe’re cracked up, that is if we’re forced to go into the Union (I’ve\r\nknown it both at Clerkenwell and the City of London workhouses,) why\r\nthe parish gives us money to buy a barrow, or a shallow, or to hire\r\nthem, and leave the house and start for ourselves: and what’s the use\r\nof that, if the police won’t let us sell our goods?--Which is right,\r\nthe parish or the police?”\r\n\r\nTo thwart the police in any measure the costermongers readily aid\r\none another. One very common procedure, if the policeman has seized\r\na barrow, is to whip off a wheel, while the officers have gone for\r\nassistance; for a large and loaded barrow requires two men to convey it\r\nto the green-yard. This is done with great dexterity; and the next step\r\nis to dispose of the stock to any passing costers, or to any “standing”\r\nin the neighbourhood, and it is honestly accounted for. The policemen,\r\non their return, find an empty, and unwheelable barrow, which they must\r\ncarry off by main strength, amid the jeers of the populace.\r\n\r\nI am assured that in case of a political riot every “coster” would\r\nseize his policeman.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND CONCUBINAGE OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nOnly one-tenth--at the outside one-tenth--of the couples living\r\ntogether and carrying on the costermongering trade, are married. In\r\nClerkenwell parish, however, where the number of married couples is\r\nabout a fifth of the whole, this difference is easily accounted for,\r\nas in Advent and Easter the incumbent of that parish marries poor\r\ncouples without a fee. Of the rights of “legitimate” or “illegitimate”\r\nchildren the costermongers understand nothing, and account it a mere\r\nwaste of money and time to go through the ceremony of wedlock when a\r\npair can live together, and be quite as well regarded by their fellows,\r\nwithout it. The married women associate with the unmarried mothers of\r\nfamilies without the slightest scruple. There is no honour attached\r\nto the marriage state, and no shame to concubinage. Neither are the\r\nunmarried women less faithful to their “partners” than the married; but\r\nI understand that, of the two classes, the unmarried betray the most\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nAs regards the fidelity of these women I was assured that, “in anything\r\nlike good times,” they were rigidly faithful to their husbands or\r\nparamours; but that, in the worst pinch of poverty, a departure\r\nfrom this fidelity--if it provided a few meals or a fire--was not\r\nconsidered at all heinous. An old costermonger, who had been mixed\r\nup with other callings, and whose prejudices were certainly not in\r\nfavour of his present trade, said to me, “What I call the working\r\ngirls, sir, are as industrious and as faithful a set as can well be.\r\nI’m satisfied that they’re more faithful to their mates than other\r\npoor working women. I never knew one of these working girls do wrong\r\nthat way. They’re strong, hearty, healthy girls, and keep clean rooms.\r\nWhy, there’s numbers of men leave their stock-money with their women,\r\njust taking out two or three shillings to gamble with and get drunk\r\nupon. They sometimes take a little drop themselves, the women do,\r\nand get beaten by their husbands for it, and hardest beaten if the\r\nman’s drunk himself. They’re sometimes beaten for other things too,\r\nor for nothing at all. But they seem to like the men better for their\r\nbeating them. I never could make that out.” Notwithstanding this\r\nfidelity, it appears that the “larking and joking” of the young, and\r\nsometimes of the middle-aged people, among themselves, is anything but\r\ndelicate. The unmarried separate as seldom as the married. The fidelity\r\ncharacterizing the women does not belong to the men.\r\n\r\nThe dancing-rooms are the places where matches are made up. There the\r\nboys go to look out for “mates,” and sometimes a match is struck up the\r\nfirst night of meeting, and the couple live together forthwith. The\r\ngirls at these dances are all the daughters of costermongers, or of\r\npersons pursuing some other course of street life. Unions take place\r\nwhen the lad is but 14. Two or three out of 100 have their female\r\nhelpmates at that early age; but the female is generally a couple of\r\nyears older than her partner. Nearly all the costermongers form such\r\nalliances as I have described, when both parties are under twenty.\r\nOne reason why these alliances are contracted at early ages is, that\r\nwhen a boy has assisted his father, or any one engaging him, in the\r\nbusiness of a costermonger, he knows that he can borrow money, and hire\r\na shallow or a barrow--or he may have saved 5_s._--“and then if the\r\nfather vexes him or snubs him,” said one of my informants, “he’ll tell\r\nhis father to go to h--l, and he and his gal will start on their own\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\nMost of the costermongers have numerous families, but not those who\r\ncontract alliances very young. The women continue working down to the\r\nday of their confinement.\r\n\r\n“Chance children,” as they are called, or children unrecognised by any\r\nfather, are rare among the young women of the costermongers.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent and trustworthy man, until very recently actively\r\nengaged in costermongering, computed that not 3 in 100 costermongers\r\nhad ever been in the interior of a church, or any place of worship,\r\nor knew what was meant by Christianity. The same person gave me the\r\nfollowing account, which was confirmed by others:\r\n\r\n“The costers have no religion at all, and very little notion, or none\r\nat all, of what religion or a future state is. Of all things they\r\nhate tracts. They hate them because the people leaving them never\r\ngive them anything, and as they can’t read the tract--not one in\r\nforty--they’re vexed to be bothered with it. And really what is the\r\nuse of giving people reading before you’ve taught them to read? Now,\r\nthey respect the City Missionaries, because they read to them--and\r\nthe costers will listen to reading when they don’t understand it--and\r\nbecause they visit the sick, and sometimes give oranges and such like\r\nto them and the children. I’ve known a City Missionary buy a shilling’s\r\nworth of oranges of a coster, and give them away to the sick and the\r\nchildren--most of them belonging to the costermongers--down the court,\r\nand that made him respected there. I think the City Missionaries\r\nhave done good. But I’m satisfied that if the costers had to profess\r\nthemselves of some religion to-morrow, they would all become Roman\r\nCatholics, every one of them. This is the reason:--London costers live\r\nvery often in the same courts and streets as the poor Irish, and if the\r\nIrish are sick, be sure there comes to them the priest, the Sisters\r\nof Charity--they _are_ good women--and some other ladies. Many a man\r\nthat’s not a Catholic, has rotted and died without any good person near\r\nhim. Why, I lived a good while in Lambeth, and there wasn’t one coster\r\nin 100, I’m satisfied, knew so much as the rector’s name,--though\r\nMr. Dalton’s a very good man. But the reason I was telling you of,\r\nsir, is that the costers reckon _that_ religion’s the best that gives\r\nthe most in charity, and they think the Catholics do this. I’m not a\r\nCatholic myself, but I believe every word of the Bible, and have the\r\ngreater belief that it’s the word of God because it teaches democracy.\r\nThe Irish in the courts get sadly chaffed by the others about their\r\npriests,--but they’ll die for the priest. Religion is a regular puzzle\r\nto the costers. They see people come out of church and chapel, and as\r\nthey’re mostly well dressed, and there’s very few of their own sort\r\namong the church-goers, the costers somehow mix up being religious with\r\nbeing respectable, and so they have a queer sort of feeling about it.\r\nIt’s a mystery to them. It’s shocking when you come to think of it.\r\nThey’ll listen to any preacher that goes among them; and then a few\r\nwill say--I’ve heard it often--‘A b--y fool, why don’t he let people go\r\nto h-ll their own way?’ There’s another thing that makes the costers\r\nthink so well of the Catholics. If a Catholic coster--there’s only very\r\nfew of them--is ‘cracked up’ (penniless), he’s often started again, and\r\nthe others have a notion that it’s through some chapel-fund. I don’t\r\nknow whether it is so or not, but I know the cracked-up men are started\r\nagain, if they’re Catholics. It’s still the stranger that the regular\r\ncostermongers, who are nearly all Londoners, should have such respect\r\nfor the Roman Catholics, when they have such a hatred of the Irish,\r\nwhom they look upon as intruders and underminers.”--“If a missionary\r\ncame among us with plenty of money,” said another costermonger, “he\r\nmight make us all Christians or Turks, or anything he liked.” Neither\r\nthe Latter-day Saints, nor any similar sect, have made converts among\r\nthe costermongers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE UNEDUCATED STATE OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI have stated elsewhere, that only about one in ten of the regular\r\ncostermongers is able to read. The want of education among both men\r\nand women is deplorable, and I tested it in several instances. The\r\nfollowing statement, however, from one of the body, is no more to be\r\ntaken as representing the ignorance of the class generally, than are\r\nthe clear and discriminating accounts I received from intelligent\r\ncostermongers to be taken as representing the intelligence of the body.\r\n\r\nThe man with whom I conversed, and from whom I received the following\r\nstatement, seemed about thirty. He was certainly not ill-looking, but\r\nwith a heavy cast of countenance, his light blue eyes having little\r\nexpression. His statements, or opinions, I need hardly explain, were\r\ngiven both spontaneously in the course of conversation, and in answer\r\nto my questions. I give them almost verbatim, omitting oaths and slang:\r\n\r\n“Well, times is bad, sir,” he said, “but it’s a deadish time. I don’t\r\ndo so well at present as in middlish times, I think. When I served the\r\nPrince of Naples, not far from here (I presume that he alluded to the\r\nPrince of Capua), I did better and times was better. That was five\r\nyears ago, but I can’t say to a year or two. He was a good customer,\r\nand was very fond of peaches. I used to sell them to him, at 12_s._ the\r\nplasket when they was new. The plasket held a dozen, and cost me 6_s._\r\nat Covent-garden--more sometimes; but I didn’t charge him more when\r\nthey did. His footman was a black man, and a ignorant man quite, and\r\nhis housekeeper was a Englishwoman. He was the Prince o’ Naples, was my\r\ncustomer; but I don’t know what he was like, for I never saw him. I’ve\r\nheard that he was the brother of the king of Naples. I can’t say where\r\nNaples is, but if you was to ask at Euston-square, they’ll tell you the\r\nfare there and the time to go it in. It may be in France for anything\r\nI know may Naples, or in Ireland. Why don’t you ask at the square? I\r\nwent to Croydon once by rail, and slept all the way without stirring,\r\nand so you may to Naples for anything I know. I never heard of the\r\nPope being a neighbour of the King of Naples. Do you mean living next\r\ndoor to him? But I don’t know nothing of the King of Naples, only the\r\nprince. I don’t know what the Pope is. Is he any trade? It’s nothing to\r\nme, when he’s no customer of mine. I have nothing to say about nobody\r\nthat ain’t no customers. My crabs is caught in the sea, in course. I\r\ngets them at Billingsgate. I never saw the sea, but it’s salt-water,\r\nI know. I can’t say whereabouts it lays. I believe it’s in the hands\r\nof the Billingsgate salesmen--all of it? I’ve heard of shipwrecks at\r\nsea, caused by drownding, in course. I never heard that the Prince\r\nof Naples was ever at sea. I like to talk about him, he was such a\r\ncustomer when he lived near here.” (Here he repeated his account of\r\nthe supply of peaches to his Royal Highness.) “I never was in France,\r\nno, sir, never. I don’t know the way. Do you think I could do better\r\nthere? I never was in the Republic there. What’s it like? Bonaparte?\r\nO, yes; I’ve heard of him. He was at Waterloo. I didn’t know he’d been\r\nalive now and in France, as you ask me about him. I don’t think you’re\r\nlarking, sir. Did I hear of the French taking possession of Naples,\r\nand Bonaparte making his brother-in-law king? Well, I didn’t, but it\r\nmay be true, because I served the Prince of Naples, what _was_ the\r\nbrother of the king. I never heard whether the Prince was the king’s\r\nolder brother or his younger. I wish he may turn out his older if\r\nthere’s property coming to him, as the oldest has the first turn; at\r\nleast so I’ve heard--first come, first served. I’ve worked the streets\r\nand the courts at all times. I’ve worked them by moonlight, but you\r\ncouldn’t see the moonlight where it was busy. I can’t say how far the\r\nmoon’s off us. It’s nothing to me, but I’ve seen it a good bit higher\r\nthan St. Paul’s. I don’t know nothing about the sun. Why do you ask?\r\nIt must be nearer than the moon for it’s warmer,--and if they’re both\r\nfire, that shows it. It’s like the tap-room grate and that bit of a\r\ngas-light; to compare the two is. What was St. Paul’s that the moon\r\nwas above? A church, sir; so I’ve heard. I never was in a church. O,\r\nyes, I’ve heard of God; he made heaven and earth; I never heard of his\r\nmaking the sea; that’s another thing, and you can best learn about that\r\nat Billingsgate. (He seemed to think that the sea was an appurtenance\r\nof Billingsgate.) Jesus Christ? Yes. I’ve heard of him. Our Redeemer?\r\nWell, I only wish I could redeem my Sunday togs from my uncle’s.”\r\n\r\nAnother costermonger, in answer to inquiries, said: “I ’spose you think\r\nus ’riginal coves that you ask. We’re not like Methusalem, or some such\r\nswell’s name, (I presume that Malthus was meant) as wanted to murder\r\nchildren afore they was born, as I once heerd lectured about--we’re\r\nnothing like that.”\r\n\r\nAnother on being questioned, and on being told that the information was\r\nwanted for the press, replied: “The press? I’ll have nothing to say to\r\nit. We are oppressed enough already.”\r\n\r\nThat a class numbering 30,000 should be permitted to remain in a state\r\nof almost brutish ignorance is a national disgrace. If the London\r\ncosters belong especially to the “dangerous classes,” the danger of\r\nsuch a body is assuredly an evil of our own creation; for the gratitude\r\nof the poor creatures to any one who seeks to give them the least\r\nknowledge is almost pathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe slang language of the costermongers is not very remarkable for\r\noriginality of construction; it possesses no humour: but they boast\r\nthat it is known only to themselves; it is far beyond the Irish, they\r\nsay, and puzzles the Jews. The _root_ of the costermonger tongue, so to\r\nspeak, is to give the words spelt backward, or rather pronounced rudely\r\nbackward,--for in my present chapter the language has, I believe,\r\nbeen reduced to orthography for the first time. With this backward\r\npronunciation, which is very arbitrary, are mixed words reducible to no\r\nrule and seldom referrable to any origin, thus complicating the mystery\r\nof this unwritten tongue; while any syllable is added to a proper slang\r\nword, at the discretion of the speaker.\r\n\r\nSlang is acquired very rapidly, and some costermongers will converse\r\nin it by the hour. The women use it sparingly; the girls more than\r\nthe women; the men more than the girls; and the boys most of all. The\r\nmost ignorant of all these classes deal most in slang and boast of\r\ntheir cleverness and proficiency in it. In their conversations among\r\nthemselves, the following are invariably the terms used in money\r\nmatters. A rude back-spelling may generally be traced:\r\n\r\n  _Flatch_         Halfpenny.\r\n  _Yenep_          Penny.\r\n  _Owt-yenep_      Twopence.\r\n  _Erth-yenep_     Threepence.\r\n  _Rouf-yenep_     Fourpence.\r\n  _Ewif-yenep_     Fivepence.\r\n  _Exis-yenep_     Sixpence.\r\n  _Neves-yenep_    Sevenpence.\r\n  _Teaich-yenep_   Eightpence.\r\n  _Enine-yenep_    Ninepence.\r\n  _Net-yenep_      Tenpence.\r\n  _Leven_          Elevenpence.\r\n  _Gen_            Twelvepence.\r\n  _Yenep-flatch_   Three half-pence.\r\n\r\nand so on through the penny-halfpennies.\r\n\r\nIt was explained to me by a costermonger, who had introduced some\r\nnew words into the slang, that “leven” was allowed so closely\r\nto resemble the proper word, because elevenpence was almost an\r\nunknown sum to costermongers, the transition--weights and measures\r\nnotwithstanding--being immediate from 10_d._ to 1_s._\r\n\r\n“Gen” is a shilling and the numismatic sequence is pursued with the\r\ngens, as regards shillings, as with the “yeneps” as regards pence. The\r\nblending of the two is also according to the same system as “Owt-gen,\r\nteaich-yenep” two-and-eightpence. The exception to the uniformity\r\nof the “gen” enumeration is in the sum of 8_s._, which instead of\r\n“teaich-gen” is “teaich-guy:” a deviation with ample precedents in all\r\ncivilised tongues.\r\n\r\nAs regards the larger coins the translation into slang is not reducible\r\ninto rule. The following are the costermonger coins of the higher\r\nvalue:\r\n\r\n  _Couter_                       Sovereign.\r\n  _Half-Couter_, or _Net-gen_    Half-sovereign.\r\n  _Ewif-gen_                     Crown.\r\n  _Flatch-ynork_                 Half-crown.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers still further complicate their slang by a mode of\r\nmultiplication. They thus say, “Erth Ewif-gens” or 3 times 5_s._, which\r\nmeans of course 15_s._\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this language, a costermonger said to me: “The Irish can’t\r\ntumble to it anyhow; the Jews can tumble better, but we’re _their_\r\nmasters. Some of the young salesmen at Billingsgate understand us,--but\r\nonly at Billingsgate; and they think they’re uncommon clever, but\r\nthey’re not quite up to the mark. The police don’t understand us at\r\nall. It would be a pity if they did.”\r\n\r\nI give a few more phrases:\r\n\r\n  _A doogheno or dabheno?_      Is it a good or bad market?\r\n  _A regular trosseno_          A regular bad one.\r\n  _On_                          No.\r\n  _Say_                         Yes.\r\n  _Tumble to your barrikin_     Understand you.\r\n  _Top o’ reeb_                 Pot of beer.\r\n  _Doing dab_                   Doing badly.\r\n  _Cool him_                    Look at him.\r\n\r\nThe latter phrase is used when one costermonger warns another of\r\nthe approach of a policeman “who might order him to move on, or be\r\notherwise unpleasant.” “Cool” (look) is exclaimed, or “Cool him” (look\r\nat him). One costermonger told me as a great joke that a very stout\r\npoliceman, who was then new to the duty, was when in a violent state of\r\nperspiration, much offended by a costermonger saying “Cool him.”\r\n\r\n  _Cool the esclop_           Look at the police.\r\n  _Cool the namesclop_        Look at the policeman.\r\n  _Cool ta the dillo nemo_    Look at the old woman;\r\n\r\nsaid of any woman, young or old, who, according to costermonger\r\nnotions, is “giving herself airs.”\r\n\r\nThis language seems confined, in its general use, to the immediate\r\nobjects of the costermonger’s care; but is, among the more acute\r\nmembers of the fraternity, greatly extended, and is capable of\r\nindefinite extension.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers oaths, I may conclude, are all in the vernacular; nor\r\nare any of the common salutes, such as “How d’you do?” or “Good-night”\r\nknown to their slang.\r\n\r\n    _Kennetseeno_               Stinking;\r\n  (applied principally to the quality of fish.)\r\n    _Flatch kanurd_             Half-drunk.\r\n    _Flash it_                  Show it;\r\n  (in cases of bargains offered.)\r\n    _On doog_                   No good.\r\n    _Cross chap_                A thief.\r\n    _Showfulls_                 Bad money;\r\n  (seldom in the hands of costermongers.)\r\n    _I’m on to the deb_         I’m going to bed.\r\n    _Do the tightner_           Go to dinner.\r\n    _Nommus_                    Be off.\r\n    _Tol_                       Lot, Stock, or Share.\r\n\r\nMany costermongers, “but principally--perhaps entirely,”--I was told,\r\n“those who had not been regular born and bred to the trade, but had\r\ntaken to it when cracked up in their own,” do not trouble themselves\r\nto acquire any knowledge of slang. It is not indispensable for the\r\ncarrying on of their business; the grand object, however, seems to be,\r\nto shield their bargainings at market, or their conversation among\r\nthemselves touching their day’s work and profits, from the knowledge of\r\nany Irish or uninitiated fellow-traders.\r\n\r\nThe simple principle of costermonger slang--that of pronouncing\r\nbackward, may cause its acquirement to be regarded by the educated\r\nas a matter of ease. But it is a curious fact that lads who become\r\ncostermongers’ boys, without previous association with the class,\r\nacquire a very ready command of the language, and this though they are\r\nnot only unable to spell, but don’t “know a letter in a book.” I saw\r\none lad, whose parents had, until five or six months back, resided\r\nin the country. The lad himself was fourteen; he told me he had not\r\nbeen “a costermongering” more than three months, and prided himself on\r\nhis mastery over slang. To test his ability, I asked him the coster’s\r\nword for “hippopotamus;” he answered, with tolerable readiness,\r\n“musatoppop.” I then asked him for the like rendering of “equestrian”\r\n(one of Astley’s bills having caught my eye). He replied, but not quite\r\nso readily, “nirtseque.” The last test to which I subjected him was\r\n“good-naturedly;” and though I induced him to repeat the word twice,\r\nI could not, on any of the three renderings, distinguish any precise\r\nsound beyond an indistinct gabbling, concluded emphatically with\r\n“doog:”--“good” being a word with which all these traders are familiar.\r\nIt must be remembered, that the words I demanded were remote from the\r\nyoung costermonger’s vocabulary, if not from his understanding.\r\n\r\nBefore I left this boy, he poured forth a minute or more’s gibberish,\r\nof which, from its rapid utterance, I could distinguish nothing; but I\r\nfound from his after explanation, that it was a request to me to make a\r\nfurther purchase of his walnuts.\r\n\r\nThis slang is utterly devoid of any applicability to humour. It gives\r\nno new fact, or approach to a fact, for philologists. One superior\r\ngenius among the costers, who has invented words for them, told me\r\nthat he had no system for coining his term. He gave to the known words\r\nsome terminating syllable, or, as he called it, “a new turn, just,”\r\nto use his own words, “as if he chorussed them, with a tol-de-rol.”\r\nThe intelligence communicated in this slang is, in a great measure,\r\ncommunicated, as in other slang, as much by the inflection of the\r\nvoice, the emphasis, the tone, the look, the shrug, the nod, the wink,\r\nas by the words spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NICKNAMES OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nLike many rude, and almost all wandering communities, the\r\ncostermongers, like the cabmen and pickpockets, are hardly ever known\r\nby their real names; even the honest men among them are distinguished\r\nby some strange appellation. Indeed, they are all known one to another\r\nby nicknames, which they acquire either by some mode of dress, some\r\nremark that has ensured costermonger applause, some peculiarity in\r\ntrading, or some defect or singularity in personal appearance. Men are\r\nknown as “Rotten Herrings,” “Spuddy” (a seller of bad potatoes, until\r\nbeaten by the Irish for his bad wares,) “Curly” (a man with a curly\r\nhead), “Foreigner” (a man who had been in the Spanish-Legion), “Brassy”\r\n(a very saucy person), “Gaffy” (once a performer), “The One-eyed\r\nBuffer,” “Jaw-breaker,” “Pine-apple Jack,” “Cast-iron Poll” (her\r\nhead having been struck with a pot without injury to her), “Whilky,”\r\n“Blackwall Poll” (a woman generally having two black eyes), “Lushy\r\nBet,” “Dirty Sall” (the costermongers generally objecting to dirty\r\nwomen), and “Dancing Sue.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EDUCATION OF COSTERMONGERS’ CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nI have used the heading of “Education,” but perhaps to say\r\n“non-education,” would be more suitable. Very few indeed of the\r\ncostermongers’ children are sent even to the Ragged Schools; and if\r\nthey are, from all I could learn, it is done more that the mother\r\nmay be saved the trouble of tending them at home, than from any\r\ndesire that the children shall acquire useful knowledge. Both boys\r\nand girls are sent out by their parents in the evening to sell nuts,\r\noranges, &c., at the doors of the theatres, or in any public place,\r\nor “round the houses” (a stated circuit from their place of abode).\r\nThis trade they pursue eagerly for the sake of “bunts,” though some\r\ncarry home the money they take, very honestly. The costermongers are\r\nkind to their children, “perhaps in a rough way, and the women make\r\nregular pets of them very often.” One experienced man told me, that\r\nhe had seen a poor costermonger’s wife--one of the few who could\r\nread--instructing her children in reading; but such instances were\r\nvery rare. The education of these children is such only as the streets\r\nafford; and the streets teach them, for the most part--and in greater\r\nor lesser degrees,--acuteness--a precocious acuteness--in all that\r\nconcerns their immediate wants, business, or gratifications; a patient\r\nendurance of cold and hunger; a desire to obtain money without working\r\nfor it; a craving for the excitement of gambling; an inordinate love\r\nof amusement; and an irrepressible repugnance to any settled in-door\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITERATURE OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nWe have now had an inkling of the London costermonger’s notions upon\r\npolitics and religion. We have seen the brutified state in which he is\r\nallowed by society to remain, though possessing the same faculties and\r\nsusceptibilities as ourselves--the same power to perceive and admire\r\nthe forms of truth, beauty, and goodness, as even the very highest\r\nin the state. We have witnessed how, instinct with all the elements\r\nof manhood and beasthood, the qualities of the beast are principally\r\ndeveloped in him, while those of the man are stunted in their growth.\r\nIt now remains for us to look into some other matters concerning this\r\ncurious class of people, and, first, of their literature:\r\n\r\nIt may appear anomalous to speak of the literature of an uneducated\r\nbody, but even the costermongers have their tastes for books. They\r\nare very fond of hearing any one read aloud to them, and listen very\r\nattentively. One man often reads the Sunday paper of the beer-shop to\r\nthem, and on a fine summer’s evening a costermonger, or any neighbour\r\nwho has the advantage of being “a schollard,” reads aloud to them\r\nin the courts they inhabit. What they love best to listen to--and,\r\nindeed, what they are most eager for--are Reynolds’s periodicals,\r\nespecially the “Mysteries of the Court.” “They’ve got tired of Lloyd’s\r\nblood-stained stories,” said one man, who was in the habit of reading\r\nto them, “and I’m satisfied that, of all London, Reynolds is the\r\nmost popular man among them. They stuck to him in Trafalgar-square,\r\nand would again. They all say he’s ‘a trump,’ and Feargus O’Connor’s\r\nanother trump with them.”\r\n\r\nOne intelligent man considered that the spirit of curiosity manifested\r\nby costermongers, as regards the information or excitement derived from\r\nhearing stories read, augured well for the improvability of the class.\r\n\r\nAnother intelligent costermonger, who had recently read some of\r\nthe cheap periodicals to ten or twelve men, women, and boys, all\r\ncostermongers, gave me an account of the comments made by his auditors.\r\nThey had assembled, after their day’s work or their rounds, for the\r\npurpose of hearing my informant read the last number of some of the\r\npenny publications.\r\n\r\n“The costermongers,” said my informant, “are very fond of\r\nillustrations. I have known a man, what couldn’t read, buy a periodical\r\nwhat had an illustration, a little out of the common way perhaps, just\r\nthat he might learn from some one, who _could_ read, what it was all\r\nabout. They have all heard of Cruikshank, and they think everything\r\nfunny is by him--funny scenes in a play and all. His ‘Bottle’ was very\r\nmuch admired. I heard one man say it was very prime, and showed what\r\n‘lush’ did, but I saw the same man,” added my informant, “drunk three\r\nhours afterwards. Look you here, sir,” he continued, turning over a\r\nperiodical, for he had the number with him, “here’s a portrait of\r\n‘Catherine of Russia.’ ‘Tell us all about her,’ said one man to me\r\nlast night; ‘read it; what was she?’ When I had read it,” my informant\r\ncontinued, “another man, to whom I showed it, said, ‘Don’t the cove\r\nas did that know a deal?’ for they fancy--at least, a many do--that\r\none man writes a whole periodical, or a whole newspaper. Now here,”\r\nproceeded my friend, “you see’s an engraving of a man hung up, burning\r\nover a fire, and some costers would go mad if they couldn’t learn\r\nwhat he’d been doing, who he was, and all about him. ‘But about the\r\npicture?’ they would say, and this is a very common question put by\r\nthem whenever they see an engraving.\r\n\r\n“Here’s one of the passages that took their fancy wonderfully,” my\r\ninformant observed:\r\n\r\n ‘With glowing cheeks, flashing eyes, and palpitating bosom, Venetia\r\n Trelawney rushed back into the refreshment-room, where she threw\r\n herself into one of the arm-chairs already noticed. But scarcely\r\n had she thus sunk down upon the flocculent cushion, when a sharp\r\n click, as of some mechanism giving way, met her ears; and at the same\r\n instant her wrists were caught in manacles which sprang out of the\r\n arms of the treacherous chair, while two steel bands started from the\r\n richly-carved back and grasped her shoulders. A shriek burst from her\r\n lips--she struggled violently, but all to no purpose: for she was a\r\n captive--and powerless!\r\n\r\n ‘We should observe that the manacles and the steel bands which had\r\n thus fastened upon her, were covered with velvet, so that they\r\n inflicted no positive injury upon her, nor even produced the slightest\r\n abrasion of her fair and polished skin.’\r\n\r\nHere all my audience,” said the man to me, “broke out with--‘Aye!\r\nthat’s the way the harristocrats hooks it. There’s nothing o’ that sort\r\namong us; the rich has all that barrikin to themselves.’ ‘Yes, that’s\r\nthe b---- way the taxes goes in,’ shouted a woman.\r\n\r\n“Anything about the police sets them a talking at once. This did when I\r\nread it:\r\n\r\n ‘The Ebenezers still continued their fierce struggle, and, from\r\n the noise they made, seemed as if they were tearing each other\r\n to pieces, to the wild roar of a chorus of profane swearing. The\r\n alarm, as Bloomfield had predicted, was soon raised, and some two or\r\n three policemen, with their bull’s-eyes, and still more effective\r\n truncheons, speedily restored order.’\r\n\r\n‘The blessed crushers is everywhere,’ shouted one. ‘I wish I’d been\r\nthere to have had a shy at the eslops,’ said another. And then a man\r\nsung out: ‘O, don’t I like the Bobbys?’\r\n\r\n“If there’s any foreign language which can’t be explained, I’ve seen\r\nthe costers,” my informant went on, “annoyed at it--quite annoyed.\r\nAnother time I read part of one of Lloyd’s numbers to them--but they\r\nlike something spicier. One article in them--here it is--finishes in\r\nthis way:\r\n\r\n “The social habits and costumes of the Magyar _noblesse_ have almost\r\n all the characteristics of the corresponding class in Ireland. This\r\n word _noblesse_ is one of wide signification in Hungary; and one may\r\n with great truth say of this strange nation, that ‘_qui n’est point\r\n noble n’est rien_.’”\r\n\r\n‘I can’t tumble to that barrikin,’ said a young fellow; ‘it’s a\r\njaw-breaker. But if this here--what d’ye call it, you talk about--was\r\nlike the Irish, why they was a rum lot.’ ‘Noblesse,’ said a man that’s\r\nconsidered a clever fellow, from having once learned his letters,\r\nthough he can’t read or write. ‘Noblesse! Blessed if I know what he’s\r\nup to.’ Here there was a regular laugh.”\r\n\r\nFrom other quarters I learned that some of the costermongers who were\r\nable to read, or loved to listen to reading, purchased their literature\r\nin a very commercial spirit, frequently buying the periodical which is\r\nthe largest in size, because when “they’ve got the reading out of it,”\r\nas they say, “it’s worth a halfpenny for the barrow.”\r\n\r\nTracts they will rarely listen to, but if any persevering man\r\n_will_ read tracts, and state that he does it for their benefit and\r\nimprovement, they listen without rudeness, though often with evident\r\nunwillingness. “Sermons or tracts,” said one of their body to me,\r\n“gives them the ’orrors.” Costermongers purchase, and not unfrequently,\r\nthe first number of a penny periodical, “to see what it’s like.”\r\n\r\nThe tales of robbery and bloodshed, of heroic, eloquent, and\r\ngentlemanly highwaymen, or of gipsies turning out to be nobles, now\r\ninterest the costermongers but little, although they found great\r\ndelight in such stories a few years back. Works relating to Courts,\r\npotentates, or “harristocrats,” are the most relished by these rude\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HONESTY OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI heard on all hands that the costers never steal from one another,\r\nand never wink at any one stealing from a neighbouring stall. Any\r\nstall-keeper will leave his stall untended to get his dinner, his\r\nneighbour acting for him; sometimes he will leave it to enjoy a game\r\nat skittles. It was computed for me, that property worth 10,000_l._\r\nbelonging to costers is daily left exposed in the streets or at the\r\nmarkets, almost entirely unwatched, the policeman or market-keeper\r\nonly passing at intervals. And yet thefts are rarely heard of, and\r\nwhen heard of are not attributable to costermongers, but to regular\r\nthieves. The way in which the sum of 10,000_l._ was arrived at, is\r\nthis: “In Hooper-street, Lambeth,” said my informant, “there are thirty\r\nbarrows and carts exposed on an evening, left in the street, with\r\nnobody to see to them; left there all night. That is only one street.\r\nEach barrow and board would be worth, on the average, 2_l._ 5_s._,\r\nand that would be 67_l._ 10_s._ In the other bye-streets and courts\r\noff the New-cut are six times as many, Hooper-street having the most.\r\nThis would give 405_l._ in all, left unwatched of a night. There are,\r\nthroughout London, twelve more districts besides the New-cut--at least\r\ntwelve districts--and, calculating the same amount in these, we have,\r\naltogether, 4,860_l._ worth of barrows. Taking in other bye-streets, we\r\nmay safely reckon it at 4,000 barrows; for the numbers I have given in\r\nthe thirteen places are 2,520, and 1,480 added is moderate. At least\r\nhalf of those which are in use next day, are left unwatched; more, I\r\nhave no doubt, but say half. The stock of these 2,000 will average\r\n10_s._ each, or 1,000_l._; and the barrows will be worth 4,500_l._; in\r\nall 5,500_l._, and the property exposed on the stalls and the markets\r\nwill be double in amount, or 11,000_l._ in value, every day, but say\r\n10,000_l._\r\n\r\n“Besides, sir,” I was told, “the thieves won’t rob the costers so often\r\nas they will the shopkeepers. It’s easier to steal from a butcher’s or\r\nbacon-seller’s open window than from a costermonger’s stall or barrow,\r\nbecause the shopkeeper’s eye can’t be always on his goods. But there’s\r\nalways some one to give an eye to a coster’s property. At Billingsgate\r\nthe thieves will rob the salesmen far readier than they will us. They\r\nknow we’d take it out of them readier if they were caught. It’s Lynch\r\nlaw with us. We never give them in charge.”\r\n\r\nThe costermongers’ boys will, I am informed, cheat their employers, but\r\nthey do not steal from them. The costers’ donkey stables have seldom\r\neither lock or latch, and sometimes oysters, and other things which the\r\ndonkey will not molest, are left there, but are never stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CONVEYANCES OF THE COSTERMONGERS AND OTHER STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the matters relating more particularly to the\r\ncommercial life of the costermonger.\r\n\r\nAll who pass along the thoroughfares of the Metropolis, bestowing\r\nmore than a cursory glance upon the many phases of its busy street\r\nlife, must be struck with astonishment to observe the various modes of\r\nconveyance, used by those who resort to the public thoroughfares for\r\na livelihood. From the more provident costermonger’s pony and donkey\r\ncart, to the old rusty iron tray slung round the neck by the vendor\r\nof blacking, and down to the little grey-eyed Irish boy with his\r\nlucifer-matches, in the last remains of a willow hand-basket--the shape\r\nand variety of the means resorted to by the costermongers and other\r\nstreet-sellers, for carrying about their goods, are almost as manifold\r\nas the articles they vend.\r\n\r\nThe pony--or donkey--carts (and the latter is by far the more usual\r\nbeast of draught), of the prosperous costermongers are of three\r\nkinds:--the first is of an oblong shape, with a rail behind, upon which\r\nis placed a tray filled with bunches of greens, turnips, celery, &c.,\r\nwhilst other commodities are laid in the bed of the cart. Another kind\r\nis the common square cart without springs, which is so constructed\r\nthat the sides, as well as the front and back, will let down and form\r\nshelves whereon the stock may be arranged to advantage. The third sort\r\nof pony-cart is one of home manufacture, consisting of the framework\r\nof a body without sides, or front, or hind part. Sometimes a coster’s\r\nbarrow is formed into a donkey cart merely by fastening, with cord, two\r\nrough poles to the handles. All these several kinds of carts are used\r\nfor the conveyance of either fruit, vegetables, or fish; but besides\r\nthose, there is the salt and mustard vendor’s cart, with and without\r\nthe tilt or covering, and a square piece of tin (stuck into a block of\r\nsalt), on which is painted “salt 3 lbs. a penny,” and “mustard a penny\r\nan ounce.” Then there is the poultry cart, with the wild-ducks, and\r\nrabbits dangling at its sides, and with two uprights and a cross-stick,\r\nupon which are suspended birds, &c., slung across in couples.\r\n\r\nThe above conveyances are all of small dimensions, the barrows being\r\ngenerally about five feet long and three wide, while the carts are\r\nmostly about four feet square.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of harness is used; some is well blacked and greased and\r\nglittering with brass, others are almost as grey with dust as the\r\ndonkey itself. Some of the jackasses are gaudily caparisoned in an old\r\ncarriage-harness, which fits it like a man’s coat on a boy’s back,\r\nwhile the plated silver ornaments are pink, with the copper showing\r\nthrough; others have rope traces and belly-bands, and not a few indulge\r\nin old cotton handkerchiefs for pads.\r\n\r\nThe next conveyance (which, indeed, is the most general) is the\r\ncostermonger’s hand-barrow. These are very light in their make, with\r\nsprings terminating at the axle. Some have rails behind for the\r\narrangement of their goods; others have not. Some have side rails,\r\nwhilst others have only the frame-work. The shape of these barrows is\r\noblong, and sloped from the hind-part towards the front; the bottom of\r\nthe bed is not boarded, but consists of narrow strips of wood nailed\r\nathwart and across. When the coster is hawking his fish, or vending his\r\ngreen stuff, he provides himself with a wooden tray, which is placed\r\nupon his barrow. Those who cannot afford a tray get some pieces of\r\nboard and fasten them together, these answering their purpose as well.\r\nPine-apple and pine-apple rock barrows are not unfrequently seen with\r\nsmall bright coloured flags at the four corners, fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe knife-cleaner’s barrow, which has lately appeared in the streets,\r\nmust not be passed over here. It consists of a huge sentry-box, with\r\na door, and is fixed upon two small wheels, being propelled in the\r\nsame way as a wheel-barrow. In the interior is one of Kent’s Patent\r\nKnife-cleaning Machines, worked by turning a handle. Then there are\r\nthe cat and dog’s-meat barrows. These, however, are merely common\r\nwheelbarrows, with a board in front and a ledge or shelf, formed by\r\na piece of board nailed across the top of the barrow, to answer the\r\npurpose of a cutting-board. Lastly, there is the hearth-stone barrow,\r\npiled up with hearth-stone, Bath-brick, and lumps of whiting.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of conveying the goods through the streets, is by baskets\r\nof various kinds; as the sieve or head basket; the square and oval\r\n“shallow,” fastened in front of the fruit-woman with a strap round the\r\nwaist; the hand-basket; and the “prickle.” The sieve, or head-basket,\r\nis a round willow basket, containing about one-third of a bushel.\r\nThe square and oval shallows are willow baskets, about four inches\r\ndeep, and thirty inches long, by eighteen broad. The hand-basket is\r\nthe common oval basket, with a handle across to hang upon the arm;\r\nthe latter are generally used by the Irish for onions and apples. The\r\nprickle is a brown willow basket, in which walnuts are imported into\r\nthis country from the Continent; they are about thirty inches deep, and\r\nin bulk rather larger than a gallon measure; they are used only by the\r\nvendors of walnuts.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal forms of the costermongers’ conveyances; but\r\nbesides carts, barrows, and baskets, there are many other means adopted\r\nby the London street-sellers for carrying their goods from one part\r\nof the metropolis to another. The principal of these are cans, trays,\r\nboxes, and poles.\r\n\r\nThe baked potato-cans sometimes are square and sometimes oval; they are\r\nmade with and without legs, a lid fastened on with hinges, and have a\r\nsmall charcoal fire fixed at the bottom of the can, so as to keep the\r\npotatoes hot, while there is a pipe at top to let off the steam. On\r\none side of the can is a little compartment for the salt, and another\r\non the other side for the butter. The hot pie-can is a square tin can,\r\nstanding upon four legs, with a door in front, and three partitions\r\ninside; a fire is kept in the bottom, and the pies arranged in order\r\nupon the iron plates or shelves. When the pies at the bottom are\r\nsufficiently hot they are taken out, and placed on the upper shelf,\r\nwhilst those above are removed to the lower compartments, by which\r\nmeans all the pies are kept “hot and hot.”\r\n\r\nThe muffin and crumpet-boy carries his articles in a basket, covered\r\noutside with oil-cloth and inside with green-baize, either at his back,\r\nor slung over his arm, and rings his bell as he walks.\r\n\r\nThe blacking boy, congreve-match and water-cress girl, use a rusty\r\ntray, spread over with their “goods,” and suspended to the neck by a\r\npiece of string.\r\n\r\nThe vendors of corn-salve, plating balls, soap for removing grease\r\nspots, paper, steel pens, envelopes, &c., carry their commodities in\r\nfront of them in boxes, suspended round the neck by a narrow leather\r\nstrap.\r\n\r\nRabbits and game are sometimes carried in baskets, and at other\r\ntimes tied together and slung over a pole upon the shoulder. Hat and\r\nbonnet-boxes are likewise conveyed upon a pole.\r\n\r\nDoor-mats, baskets and “duffer’s” packs, wood pails, brushes, brooms,\r\nclothes-props, clothes-lines and string, and grid-irons, Dutch-ovens,\r\nskewers and fire-shovels, are carried across the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “SMITHFIELD RACES.”\r\n\r\nHaving set forth the costermonger’s usual mode of conveying his\r\ngoods through the streets of London, I shall now give the reader a\r\ndescription of the place and scene where and when he purchases his\r\ndonkeys.\r\n\r\nWhen a costermonger wishes to sell or buy a donkey, he goes to\r\nSmithfield-market on a Friday afternoon. On this day, between the hours\r\nof one and five, there is a kind of fair held, attended solely by\r\ncostermongers, for whose convenience a long paved slip of ground, about\r\neighty feet in length, has been set apart. The animals for sale are\r\ntrotted up and down this--the “race-course,” as it is called--and on\r\neach side of it stand the spectators and purchasers, crowding among the\r\nstalls of peas-soup, hot eels, and other street delicacies.\r\n\r\nEvery thing necessary for the starting of a costermonger’s barrow\r\ncan be had in Smithfield on a Friday,--from the barrow itself to the\r\nweights--from the donkey to the whip. The animals can be purchased at\r\nprices ranging from 5_s._ to 3_l._ On a brisk market-day as many as two\r\nhundred donkeys have been sold. The barrows for sale are kept apart\r\nfrom the steeds, but harness to any amount can be found everywhere,\r\nin all degrees of excellence, from the bright japanned cart saddle\r\nwith its new red pads, to the old mouldy trace covered with buckle\r\nmarks. Wheels of every size and colour, and springs in every stage of\r\nrust, are hawked about on all sides. To the usual noise and shouting\r\nof a Saturday night’s market is added the shrill squealing of distant\r\npigs, the lowing of the passing oxen, the bleating of sheep, and the\r\nbraying of donkeys. The paved road all down the “race-course” is level\r\nand soft, with the mud trodden down between the stones. The policeman\r\non duty there wears huge fishermen’s or flushermen’s boots, reaching\r\nto their thighs; and the trouser ends of the costers’ corduroys are\r\nblack and sodden with wet dirt. Every variety of odour fills the air;\r\nyou pass from the stable smell that hangs about the donkeys, into an\r\natmosphere of apples and fried fish, near the eating-stalls, while a\r\nfew paces further on you are nearly choked with the stench of goats.\r\nThe crowd of black hats, thickly dotted with red and yellow plush caps,\r\nreels about; and the “hi-hi-i-i” of the donkey-runners sounds on all\r\nsides. Sometimes a curly-headed bull, with a fierce red eye, on its way\r\nto or from the adjacent cattle-market, comes trotting down the road,\r\nmaking all the visitors rush suddenly to the railings, for fear--as a\r\ncoster near me said--of “being taught the hornpipe.”\r\n\r\nThe donkeys standing for sale are ranged in a long line on both sides\r\nof the “race-course,” their white velvetty noses resting on the wooden\r\nrail they are tied to. Many of them wear their blinkers and head\r\nharness, and others are ornamented with ribbons, fastened in their\r\nhalters. The lookers-on lean against this railing, and chat with the\r\nboys at the donkeys’ heads, or with the men who stand behind them, and\r\nkeep continually hitting and shouting at the poor still beasts to make\r\nthem prance. Sometimes a party of two or three will be seen closely\r\nexamining one of these “Jerusalem ponys,” passing their hands down its\r\nlegs, or looking quietly on, while the proprietor’s ash stick descends\r\non the patient brute’s back, making a dull hollow sound. As you walk\r\nin front of the long line of donkeys, the lads seize the animals by\r\ntheir nostrils, and show their large teeth, asking if you “want a\r\nhass, sir,” and all warranting the creature to be “five years old next\r\nbuff-day.” Dealers are quarrelling among themselves, downcrying each\r\nother’s goods. “A hearty man,” shouted one proprietor, pointing to his\r\nrival’s stock, “could eat three sich donkeys as yourn at a meal.”\r\n\r\nOne fellow, standing behind his steed, shouts as he strikes, “Here’s\r\nthe real Brittannia mettle;” whilst another asks, “Who’s for the Pride\r\nof the Market?” and then proceeds to flip “the pride” with his whip,\r\ntill she clears away the mob with her kickings. Here, standing by its\r\nmother, will be a shaggy little colt, with a group of ragged boys\r\nfondling it, and lifting it in their arms from the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring all this the shouts of the drivers and runners fill the air,\r\nas they rush past each other on the race-course. Now a tall fellow,\r\ndragging a donkey after him, runs by crying, as he charges in amongst\r\nthe mob, “Hulloa! Hulloa! hi! hi!” his mate, with his long coat-tails\r\nflying in the wind, hurrying after and roaring, between his blows,\r\n“Keem-up!”\r\n\r\nOn nearly every post are hung traces or bridles; and in one place, on\r\nthe occasion of my visit, stood an old collar with a donkey nibbling at\r\nthe straw that had burst out. Some of the lads, in smock-frocks, walk\r\nabout with cart-saddles on their heads, and crowds gather round the\r\ntrucks, piled up with a black heap of harness studded with brass. Those\r\nwithout trays have spread out old sacks on the ground, on which are\r\nlaid axle-trees, bound-up springs, and battered carriage-lamps. There\r\nare plenty of rusty nails and iron bolts to be had, if a barrow should\r\nwant mending; and if the handles are broken, an old cab-shaft can be\r\nbought cheap, to repair them.\r\n\r\nIn another “race-course,” opposite to the donkeys,--the ponies are\r\nsold. These make a curious collection, each one showing what was his\r\nlast master’s whim. One has its legs and belly shorn of its hair,\r\nanother has its mane and tail cut close, and some have switch tails,\r\nmuddy at the end from their length. A big-hipped black nag, with red\r\ntinsel-like spots on its back, had its ears cut close, and another\r\ncurly-haired brute that was wet and steaming with having been shown\r\noff, had two huge letters burnt into its hind-quarters. Here the\r\nclattering of the hoofs and the smacking of whips added to the din; and\r\none poor brute, with red empty eye-holes, and carrying its head high\r\nup--as a blind man does--sent out showers of sparks from its hoofs as\r\nit spluttered over the stones, at each blow it received. Occasionally,\r\nin one part of the pony market, there may be seen a crowd gathered\r\nround a nag, that some one swears has been stolen from him.\r\n\r\nRaised up over the heads of the mob are bundles of whips, and men push\r\ntheir way past, with their arms full of yellow-handled curry-combs;\r\nwhilst, amongst other cries, is heard that of “Sticks 1/2_d._ each!\r\nsticks--real smarters.” At one end of the market the barrows for sale\r\nare kept piled up one on another, or filled with old wheels, and some\r\nwith white unpainted wood, showing where they have been repaired. Men\r\nare here seen thumping the wooden trays, and trying the strength of\r\nthe springs by leaning on them; and here, too, stood, on the occasion\r\nof my visit, a ragged coster lad trying to sell his scales, now the\r\ncherry-season had past.\r\n\r\nOn all sides the refreshment-barrows are surrounded by customers.\r\nThe whelk-man peppers his lots, and shouts, “A lumping penn’orth for\r\na ha’penny;” and a lad in a smock-frock carries two full pails of\r\nmilk, slopping it as he walks, and crying, “Ha’penny a mug-full, new\r\nmilk from the ke-ow!” The only quiet people to be seen are round the\r\npeas-soup stall, with their cups in their hands; and there is a huge\r\ncrowd covering in the hot-eel stand, with the steam rising up in the\r\ncentre. Baskets of sliced cake, apples, nuts, and pine-apple rock,\r\nblock up the pathway; and long wicker baskets of live fowls hem you in,\r\nround which are grouped the costers, handling and blowing apart the\r\nfeathers on the breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DONKEYS OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers almost universally treat their donkeys with kindness.\r\nMany a costermonger will resent the ill-treatment of a donkey, as\r\nhe would a personal indignity. These animals are often not only\r\nfavourites, but pets, having their share of the costermonger’s dinner\r\nwhen bread forms a portion of it, or pudding, or anything suited to\r\nthe palate of the brute. Those well-used, manifest fondness for their\r\nmasters, and are easily manageable; it is, however, difficult to get\r\nan ass, whose master goes regular rounds, away from its stable for\r\nany second labour during the day, unless it has fed and slept in the\r\ninterval. The usual fare of a donkey is a peck of chaff, which costs\r\n1_d._, a quart of oats and a quart of beans, each averaging 1-1/2_d._,\r\nand sometimes a pennyworth of hay, being an expenditure of 4_d._ or\r\n5_d._ a day; but some give double this quantity in a prosperous time.\r\nOnly one meal a day is given. Many costermongers told me, that their\r\ndonkeys lived well when they themselves lived well.\r\n\r\n“It’s all nonsense to call donkeys stupid,” said one costermonger to\r\nme; “them’s stupid that calls them so: they’re sensible. Not long since\r\nI worked Guildford with my donkey-cart and a boy. Jack (the donkey) was\r\nslow and heavy in coming back, until we got in sight of the lights at\r\nVauxhall-gate, and then he trotted on like one o’clock, he did indeed!\r\njust as if he smelt it was London besides seeing it, and knew he was\r\nat home. He had a famous appetite in the country, and the fresh grass\r\ndid him good. I gave a country lad 2_d._ to mind him in a green lane\r\nthere. I wanted my own boy to do so, but he said, ‘I’ll see you further\r\nfirst.’ A London boy hates being by himself in a lone country part.\r\nHe’s afraid of being burked; he is indeed. One can’t quarrel with a lad\r\nwhen he’s away with one in the country; he’s very useful. I feed my\r\ndonkey well. I sometimes give him a carrot for a luxury, but carrots\r\nare dear now. He’s fond of mashed potatoes, and has many a good mash\r\nwhen I can buy them at 4lb. a penny.”\r\n\r\n“There was a friend of mine,” said another man, “had great trouble\r\nabout his donkey a few months back. I saw part of it, and knew all\r\nabout it. He was doing a little work on a Sunday morning at Wandsworth,\r\nand the poor thing fell down dead. He was very fond of his donkey and\r\nkind to it, and the donkey was very fond of him. He thought he wouldn’t\r\nleave the poor creature he’d had a good while, and had been out with\r\nin all weathers, by the road side; so he dropped all notion of doing\r\nbusiness, and with help got the poor dead thing into his cart; its\r\nhead lolloping over the end of the cart, and its poor eyes staring at\r\nnothing. He thought he’d drag it home and bury it somewheres. It wasn’t\r\nfor the value he dragged it, for what’s a dead donkey worth? There\r\nwas a few persons about him, and they was all quiet and seemed sorry\r\nfor the poor fellow and for his donkey; but the church-bells struck\r\nup, and up came a ‘crusher,’ and took the man up, and next day he was\r\nfined 10_s._, I can’t exactly say for what. He never saw no more of the\r\nanimal, and lost his stock as well as his donkey.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS’ CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers, though living by buying and selling, are seldom\r\nor never capitalists. It is estimated that not more than one-fourth\r\nof the entire body trade upon their own property. Some borrow their\r\nstock money, others borrow the stock itself, others again borrow the\r\ndonkey-carts, barrows, or baskets, in which their stock is carried\r\nround, whilst others borrow even the weights and measures by which it\r\nis meted out.\r\n\r\nThe reader, however uninformed he may be as to the price the poor\r\nusually have to pay for any loans they may require, doubtlessly\r\nneed not be told that the remuneration exacted for the use of the\r\nabove-named commodities is not merely confined to the legal 5_l._ per\r\ncentum per annum; still many of even the most “knowing” will hardly\r\nbe able to credit the fact that the ordinary rate of interest in the\r\ncostermongers’ money-market amounts to 20 per cent. per week, or no\r\nless than 1040_l._ a year, for every 100_l._ advanced.\r\n\r\nBut the iniquity of this usury in the present instance is felt, not\r\nso much by the costermongers themselves, as by the poor people whom\r\nthey serve; for, of course, the enormous rate of interest must be paid\r\nout of the profits on the goods they sell, and consequently added to\r\nthe price, so that coupling this overcharge with the customary short\r\nallowance--in either weight or measure, as the case may be--we can\r\nreadily perceive how cruelly the poor are defrauded, and how they not\r\nonly get often too little for what they do, but have as often to pay\r\ntoo much for what they buy.\r\n\r\nPremising thus much, I shall now proceed to describe the terms upon\r\nwhich the barrow, the cart, the basket, the weights, the measures,\r\nthe stock-money, or the stock, is usually advanced to the needy\r\ncostermongers by their more thrifty brethren.\r\n\r\nThe hire of a barrow is 3_d._ a day, or 1_s._ a week, for the six\r\nwinter months; and 4_d._ a day, or 1_s._ 6_d._ a week, for the six\r\nsummer months. Some are to be had rather lower in the summer, but never\r\nfor less than 4_d._--sometimes for not less than 6_d._ on a Saturday,\r\nwhen not unfrequently every barrow in London is hired. No security\r\nand no deposit is required, but the lender satisfies himself that the\r\nborrower is really what he represents himself to be. I am informed that\r\n5,000 hired barrows are now in the hands of the London costermongers,\r\nat an average rental of 3_l._ 5_s._ each, or 16,250_l._ a year. One\r\nman lets out 120 yearly, at a return (dropping the 5_s._) of 360_l._;\r\nwhile the cost of a good barrow, new, is 2_l._ 12_s._, and in the\r\nautumn and winter they may be bought new, or “as good as new,” at\r\n30_s._ each; so that reckoning each to cost this barrow-letter 2_l._,\r\nhe receives 360_l._ rent or interest--exactly 150 per cent. per annum\r\nfor property which originally cost but 240_l._, and property which is\r\nstill as good for the ensuing year’s business as for the past. One man\r\nhas rented a barrow for eight years, during which period he has paid\r\n26_l._ for what in the first instance did not cost more than twice as\r\nmany shillings, and which he must return if he discontinues its use. “I\r\nknow men well to do,” said an intelligent costermonger, “who have paid\r\n1_s._ and 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for a barrow for three, four, and five\r\nyears; and they can’t be made to understand that it’s rather high rent\r\nfor what might cost 40_s._ at first. They can’t see they are losers.\r\nOne barrow-lender sends his son out, mostly on a Sunday, collecting\r\nhis rents (for barrows), but he’s not a hard man.” Some of the\r\nlenders complain that their customers pay them irregularly and cheat\r\nthem often, and that in consequence they must charge high; while the\r\n“borrowers” declare that it is very seldom indeed that a man “shirks”\r\nthe rent for his barrow, generally believing that he has made an\r\nadvantageous bargain, and feeling the want of his vehicle, if he lose\r\nit temporarily. Let the lenders, however, be deceived by many, still,\r\nit is evident, that the rent charged for barrows is most exorbitant, by\r\nthe fact, that all who take to the business become men of considerable\r\nproperty in a few years.\r\n\r\nDonkey-carts are rarely hired. “If there’s 2,000 donkey and pony-carts\r\nin London, more or less, not 200 of them’s borrowed; but of barrows\r\nfive to two is borrowed.” A donkey-cart costs from 2_l._ to 10_l._;\r\n3_l._ 10_s._ being an average price. The hire is 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nweek. The harness costs 2_l._ 10_s._ new, but is bought, nineteen times\r\nout of twenty, second-hand, at from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 20_s._ The donkeys\r\nthemselves are not let out on hire, though a costermonger may let\r\nout his donkey to another in the trade when he does not require its\r\nservices; the usual sum paid for the hire of a donkey is 2_s._ 6_d._ or\r\n3_s._ per week. The cost price of a pony varies from 5_l._ to 13_l._;\r\nthat of a donkey from 1_l._ to 3_l._ There may be six donkeys, or more,\r\nin costermonger use, to one pony. Some traffic almost weekly in these\r\nanimals, liking the excitement of such business.\r\n\r\nThe repairs to barrows, carts, and harness are almost always effected\r\nby the costermongers themselves.\r\n\r\n“Shallows” (baskets) which cost 1_s._ and 1_s._ 6_d._, are let out\r\nat 1_d._ a day; but not five in 100 of those in use are borrowed, as\r\ntheir low price places them at the costermonger’s command. A pewter\r\nquart-pot, for measuring onions, &c., is let out at 2_d._ a day, its\r\ncost being 2_s._ Scales are 2_d._, and a set of weights 1_d._ a day.\r\n\r\nAnother common mode of usury is in the lending of stock-money. This\r\nis lent by the costermongers who have saved the means for such use of\r\ntheir funds, and by beer-shop keepers. The money-lending costermongers\r\nare the most methodical in their usury--1,040_l._ per cent. per annum,\r\nas was before stated, being the rate of interest usually charged. It\r\nis seldom that a lower sum than 10_s._ is borrowed, and never a higher\r\nsum than 2_l._ When a stranger applies for a loan, the money-lender\r\nsatisfies himself as I have described of the barrow-lender. He charges\r\n2_d._ a day for a loan of 2_s._ 6_d._; 3_d._ a day for 5_s._; 6_d._ a\r\nday for 10_s._; and 1_s._ a day for 1_l._ If the daily payments are\r\nrendered regularly, at a month’s end the terms are reduced to 6_d._ a\r\nweek for 5_s._; 1_s._ for 10_s._; and 2_s._ for 1_l._ “That’s reckoned\r\nan extraordinary small interest,” was said to me, “only 4_d._ a day\r\nfor a pound.” The average may be 3_s._ a week for the loan of 20_s._;\r\nit being only to a few that a larger sum than 20_s._ is lent. “I paid\r\n2_s._ a week for 1_l._ for a whole year,” said one man, “or 5_l._ 4_s._\r\nfor the use of a pound, and then I was liable to repay the 1_l._” The\r\nprincipal, however, is seldom repaid; nor does the lender seem to\r\nexpect it, though he will occasionally demand it. One money-lender\r\nis considered to have a floating capital of 150_l._ invested in\r\nloans to costermongers. If he receive 2_s._ per week per 1_l._ for\r\nbut twenty-six weeks in the year (and he often receives it for the\r\nfifty-two weeks)--his 150_l._ brings him in 390_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nSometimes a loan is effected only for a day, generally a Saturday, as\r\nmuch as 2_s._ 6_d._ being sometimes given for the use of 5_s._; the\r\n5_s._ being of course repaid in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe money-lenders are subject to at least twice the extent of loss to\r\nwhich the barrow-lender is exposed, as it is far oftener that money is\r\nsquandered (on which of course no interest can be paid) than that a\r\nbarrow is disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe money-lenders, (from the following statement, made to me by one\r\nwho was in the habit of borrowing,) pursue their business in a not\r\nvery dissimilar manner to that imputed to those who advance larger\r\nsums:--“If I want to borrow in a hurry,” said my informant, “as I\r\nmay hear of a good bargain, I run to my neighbour L----’s, and he\r\nfirst says he hasn’t 20_s._ to lend, and his wife’s by, and she says\r\nshe hasn’t 2_s._ in her pocket, and so I can’t be accommodated. Then\r\nhe says if I must have the money he’ll have to pawn his watch,--or\r\nto borrow it of Mr. ----, (an innkeeper) who would charge a deal of\r\ninterest, for he wasn’t paid all he lent two months back, and 1_s._\r\nwould be expected to be spent in drink--though L---- don’t drink--or\r\nhe must try if his sister would trust him, but she was sick and wanted\r\nall her money--or perhaps his barrow-merchant would lend him 10_s._, if\r\nhe’d undertake to return 15_s._ at night; and it ends by my thinking\r\nI’ve done pretty well if I can get 1_l._ for 5_s._ interest, for a\r\nday’s use of it.”\r\n\r\nThe beer-shop keepers lend on far easier terms, perhaps at half\r\nthe interest exacted by the others, and without any regular system\r\nof charges; but they look sharp after the repayment, and expect a\r\nconsiderable outlay in beer, and will only lend to good customers; they\r\nhowever have even lent money without interest.\r\n\r\n“In the depth of last winter,” said a man of good character to me, “I\r\nborrowed 5_s._ The beer-shop keeper wouldn’t lend; he’ll rather lend to\r\nmen doing well and drinking. But I borrowed it at 6_d._ a day interest,\r\nand that 6_d._ a day I paid exactly four weeks, Sundays and all; and\r\nthat was 15_s._ in thirty days for the use of 5_s._ I was half starving\r\nall the time, and then I had a slice of luck, and paid the 5_s._ back\r\nslap, and got out of it.”\r\n\r\nMany shopkeepers lend money to the stall-keepers, whom they know from\r\nstanding near their premises, and that without interest. They generally\r\nlend, however, to the women, as they think the men want to get drunk\r\nwith it. “Indeed, if it wasn’t for the women,” said a costermonger to\r\nme, “half of us might go to the Union.”\r\n\r\nAnother mode of usurious lending or trading is, as I said before, to\r\nprovide the costermonger--not with the stock-money--but with the stock\r\nitself. This mode also is highly profitable to the usurer, who is\r\nusually a costermonger, but sometimes a greengrocer. A stock of fruit,\r\nfish, or vegetables, with a barrow for its conveyance, is entrusted to\r\na street-seller, the usual way being to “let him have a sovereign’s\r\nworth.” The value of this, however, at the market cost, rarely exceeds\r\n14_s._, still the man entrusted with it must carry 20_s._ to his\r\ncreditor, or he will hardly be trusted a second time. The man who\r\ntrades with the stock is not required to pay the 20_s._ on the first\r\nday of the transaction, as he may not have realised so much, but he\r\nmust pay some of it, generally 10_s._, and must pay the remainder the\r\nnext day or the money-lender will decline any subsequent dealings.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought, as no security is given, and as the costermongering\r\nbarrow, stock, or money-lender never goes to law for the recovery of\r\nany debt or goods, that the per centage is not so very exorbitant\r\nafter all. But I ascertained that not once in twenty times was the\r\nmoney lender exposed to any loss by the non-payment of his usurious\r\ninterest, while his profits are enormous. The borrower knows that if\r\nhe fail in his payment, the lender will acquaint the other members of\r\nhis fraternity, so that no future loan will be attainable, and the\r\ncostermonger’s business may be at an end. One borrower told me that\r\nthe re-payment of his loan of 2_l._, borrowed two years ago at 4_s._\r\na week, had this autumn been reduced to 2_s._ 6_d._ a week: “He’s a\r\ndecent man I pay now,” he said; “he has twice forgiven me a month at a\r\ntime when the weather was very bad and the times as bad as the weather.\r\nBefore I borrowed of him I had dealings with ----. He _was_ a scurf. If\r\nI missed a week, and told him I would make it up next week, ‘That won’t\r\ndo,’ he’d say, ‘I’ll turn you up. I’ll take d----d good care to stop\r\nyou. _I’ll_ have you to rights.’ If I hadn’t satisfied him, as I did at\r\nlast, I could never have got credit again; never.” I am informed that\r\nmost of the money-lenders, if a man has paid for a year or so, will now\r\n“drop it for a month or so in a very hard-up time, and go on again.”\r\nThere is no I.O.U. or any memorandum given to the usurer. “There’s\r\nnever a slip of paper about it, sir,” I was told.\r\n\r\nI may add that a very intelligent man from whom I derived information,\r\nsaid to me concerning costermongers never going to law to recover money\r\nowing to them, nor indeed for any purpose: “If any one steals anything\r\nfrom me--and that, as far as I know, never happened but once in ten\r\nyears--and I catch him, I take it out of him on the spot. I give him\r\na jolly good hiding and there’s an end of it. I know very well, sir,\r\nthat costers are ignorant men, but in my opinion” (laughing) “our\r\nnever going to law shows that in _that_ point we are in advance of the\r\naristocrats. I never heard of a coster in a law court, unless he was\r\nin trouble (charged with some offence)--for assaulting a crusher, or\r\nanybody he had quarrelled with, or something of that kind.”\r\n\r\nThe barrow-lender, when not regularly paid, sends some one, or goes\r\nhimself, and carries away the barrow.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience with this peculiar class justifies me in saying\r\nthat they are far less dishonest than they are usually believed to\r\nbe, and much more honest than their wandering habits, their want of\r\neducation and “principle” would lead even the most charitable to\r\nsuppose. Since I have exhibited an interest in the sufferings and\r\nprivations of these neglected people, I have, as the reader may readily\r\nimagine, had many applications for assistance, and without vanity, I\r\nbelieve I may say, that as far as my limited resources would permit,\r\nI have striven to extricate the street-sellers from the grasp of the\r\nusurer. Some to whom I have _lent_ small sums (for gifts only degrade\r\nstruggling honest men into the apathy of beggars) have taken the money\r\nwith many a protestation that they would repay it in certain weekly\r\ninstalments, which they themselves proposed, but still have never made\r\ntheir appearance before me a second time--it may be from dishonesty\r\nand it may be from inability and shame--others, however, and they are\r\nnot a few, have religiously kept faith with me, calling punctually\r\nto pay back a sixpence or a shilling as the precariousness of their\r\ncalling would permit, and doing this, though they knew that I abjured\r\nall claims upon them but through their honour, and was, indeed, in\r\nmost cases, ignorant where to find them, even if my inclination led me\r\nto seek or enforce a return of the loan. One case of this kind shows\r\nso high a sense of honour among a class, generally considered to rank\r\namong the most dishonourable, that, even at the risk of being thought\r\negotistical, I will mention it here:--“Two young men, street-sellers,\r\ncalled upon me and begged hard for the loan of a little stock-money.\r\nThey made needle-cases and hawked them from door to door at the east\r\nend of the town, and had not the means of buying the wood. I agreed to\r\nlet them have ten shillings between them; this they promised to repay\r\nat a shilling a week. They were utter strangers to me; nevertheless, at\r\nthe end of the first week one shilling of the sum was duly returned.\r\nThe second week, however, brought no shilling, nor did the third, nor\r\nthe fourth, by which time I got to look upon the money as lost; but\r\nat the end of the fifth week one of the men called with his sixpence,\r\nand told me how he should have been with me before but his mate had\r\npromised each week to meet him with his sixpence, and each week\r\ndisappointed him; so he had come on alone. I thanked him, and the next\r\nweek he came again; so he did the next, and the next after that. On the\r\nlatter occasion he told me that in five more weeks he should have paid\r\noff his half of the amount advanced, and that then, as he had come with\r\nthe other man, he would begin paying off _his_ share as well!”\r\n\r\nThose who are unacquainted with the character of the people may feel\r\ninclined to doubt the trustworthiness of the class, but it is an\r\nextraordinary fact that but few of the costermongers fail to repay the\r\nmoney advanced to them, even at the present ruinous rate of interest.\r\nThe poor, it is my belief, have not yet been sufficiently tried in this\r\nrespect;--pawnbrokers, loan-offices, tally-shops, dolly-shops, are the\r\nonly parties who will trust them--but, as a startling proof of the good\r\nfaith of the humbler classes generally, it may be stated that Mrs.\r\nChisholm (the lady who has exerted herself so benevolently in the cause\r\nof emigration) has lent out, at different times, as much as 160,000_l._\r\nthat has been entrusted to her for the use of the “lower orders,”\r\nand that the whole of this large amount has been returned--_with the\r\nexception of_ 12_l._!\r\n\r\nI myself have often given a sovereign to professed thieves to get\r\n“changed,” and never knew one to make off with the money. Depend upon\r\nit, if we would really improve, we must begin by elevating instead of\r\ndegrading.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “SLANG” WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\nAll counterfeit weights and measures, the costermongers call by the\r\nappropriate name of “slang.” “There are not half so many slangs as\r\nthere was eighteen months ago,” said a ‘general dealer’ to me. “You\r\nsee, sir, the letters in the _Morning Chronicle_ set people a talking,\r\nand some altered their way of business. Some was very angry at what was\r\nsaid in the articles on the street-sellers, and swore that costers was\r\ngentlemen, and that they’d smash the men’s noses that had told you,\r\nsir, if they knew who they were. There’s plenty of costers wouldn’t\r\nuse slangs at all, if people would give a fair price; but you see the\r\nboys _will_ try it on for their bunts, and how is a man to sell fine\r\ncherries at 4_d._ a pound that cost him 3-1/2_d._, when there’s a kid\r\nalongside of him a selling his ‘tol’ at 2_d._ a pound, and singing it\r\nout as bold as brass? So the men slangs it, and cries ‘2_d._ a pound,’\r\nand gives half-pound, as the boy does; which brings it to the same\r\nthing. We doesn’t ’dulterate our goods like the tradesmen--that is, the\r\nregular hands doesn’t. It wouldn’t be easy, as you say, to ’dulterate\r\ncabbages or oysters; but we deals fair to all that’s fair to us,--and\r\nthat’s more than many a tradesman does, for all their juries.”\r\n\r\nThe slang quart is a pint and a half. It is made precisely like the\r\nproper quart; and the maker, I was told, “knows well enough what it’s\r\nfor, as it’s charged, new, 6_d._ more than a true quart measure; but\r\nit’s nothing to him, as he says, what it’s for, so long as he gets\r\nhis price.” The slang quart is let out at 2_d._ a day--1_d._ extra\r\nbeing charged “for the risk.” The slang pint holds in some cases\r\nthree-fourths of the just quantity, having a very thick bottom; others\r\nhold only half a pint, having a false bottom half-way up. These are\r\nused chiefly in measuring nuts, of which the proper quantity is hardly\r\never given to the purchaser; “but, then,” it was often said, or implied\r\nto me, the “price is all the lower, and people just brings it on\r\nthemselves, by wanting things for next to nothing; so it’s all right;\r\nit’s people’s own faults.” The hire of the slang pint is 2_d._ per day.\r\n\r\nThe scales used are almost all true, but the weights are often beaten\r\nout flat to look large, and are 4, 5, 6, or even 7 oz. deficient in\r\na pound, and in the same relative proportion with other weights. The\r\ncharge is 2_d._, 3_d._, and 4_d._ a day for a pair of scales and a set\r\nof slang weights.\r\n\r\nThe wooden measures--such as pecks, half pecks, and quarter pecks--are\r\nnot let out slang, but the bottoms are taken out by the costers, and\r\nput in again half an inch or so higher up. “I call this,” said a\r\nhumorous dealer to me, “slop-work, or the cutting-system.”\r\n\r\nOne candid costermonger expressed his perfect contempt of slangs, as\r\nfit only for bunglers, as _he_ could always “work slang” with a true\r\nmeasure. “Why, I can cheat any man,” he said. “I can manage to measure\r\nmussels so as you’d think you got a lot over, but there’s a lot under\r\nmeasure, for I holds them up with my fingers and keep crying, ‘Mussels!\r\nfull measure, live mussels!’ I can do the same with peas. I delight\r\nto do it with stingy aristocrats. We don’t work slang in the City.\r\nPeople know what they’re a buying on there. There’s plenty of us would\r\npay for an inspector of weights; I would. We might do fair without an\r\ninspector, and make as much if we only agreed one with another.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is but just I should add that there seems to be a\r\nstrong disposition on the part of the more enlightened of the class\r\nto adopt the use of fair weights and measures; and that even among\r\nthe less scrupulous portion of the body, short allowance seems to be\r\ngiven chiefly from a desire to be _even_ with a “scaly customer.” The\r\ncoster makes it a rule never to refuse an offer, and if people _will_\r\ngive him less than what he considers his proper price, why--he gives\r\nthem less than their proper quantity. As a proof of the growing honesty\r\namong this class, many of the better disposed have recently formed\r\nthemselves into a society, the members of which are (one and all)\r\npledged not only to deal fairly with their customers, but to compel\r\nall other street-sellers to do the same. With a view of distinguishing\r\nthemselves to the public, they have come to the resolution of wearing a\r\nmedal, on which shall be engraved a particular number, so that should\r\nany imposition be practised by any of their body, the public will have\r\nthe opportunity of complaining to the Committee of the Association, and\r\nhaving the individual (if guilty) immediately expelled from the society.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF HALF PROFITS.\r\n\r\nBesides the modes of trading on borrowed capital above described,\r\nthere is still another means of obtaining stock prevalent among the\r\nLondon costermongers. It is a common practice with some of the more\r\nprovident costermongers, who buy more largely--for the sake of buying\r\ncheaply--than is required for the supply of their own customers, to\r\nplace goods in the hands of young men who are unable to buy goods on\r\ntheir own account, “on half profits,” as it is called. The man adopting\r\nthis means of doing a more extensive business, says to any poor fellow\r\nwilling to work on those terms, “Here’s a barrow of vegetables to carry\r\nround, and the profit on them will be 2_s._; you sell them, and half\r\nis for yourself.” The man sells them accordingly; if however he fail\r\nto realize the 2_s._ anticipated profit, his employer must still be\r\npaid 1_s._, even if the “seller” prove that only 13_d._ was cleared; so\r\nthat the costermonger capitalist, as he may be described, is always, to\r\nuse the words of one of my informants, “on the profitable side of the\r\nhedge.”\r\n\r\nBoys are less frequently employed on half-profits than young men; and\r\nI am assured that instances of these young men wronging their employers\r\nare hardly ever known.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BOYS OF THE COSTERMONGERS, AND THEIR BUNTS.\r\n\r\nBut there are still other “agents” among the costermongers, and\r\nthese are the “boys” deputed to sell a man’s goods for a certain\r\nsum, all over that amount being the boys’ profit or “bunts.” Almost\r\nevery costermonger who trades through the streets with his barrow is\r\naccompanied by a boy. The ages of these lads vary from ten to sixteen,\r\nthere are few above sixteen, for the lads think it is then high time\r\nfor them to start on their own account. These boys are useful to the\r\nman in “calling,” their shrill voices being often more audible than\r\nthe loudest pitch of an adult’s lungs. Many persons, moreover, I am\r\nassured, prefer buying of a boy, believing that if the lad did not\r\nsucceed in selling his goods he would be knocked about when he got\r\nhome; others think that they are safer in a boy’s hands, and less\r\nlikely to be cheated; these, however, are equally mistaken notions.\r\nThe boys also are useful in pushing at the barrow, or in drawing it\r\nalong by tugging at a rope in front. Some of them are the sons of the\r\ncostermongers; some go round to the costermongers’ abodes and say:\r\n“Will you want me to-morrow?” “Shall I come and give you a lift?”\r\nThe parents of the lads thus at large are, when they _have_ parents,\r\neither unable to support them, or, if able, prefer putting their money\r\nto other uses, (such as drinking); and so the lads have to look out\r\nfor themselves, or, as they say, “pick up a few halfpence and a bit\r\nof grub as we can.” Such lads, however, are the smallest class of\r\ncostermongering youths; and are sometimes called “cas’alty boys,” or\r\n“nippers.”\r\n\r\nThe boys--and nearly the whole of them--soon become very quick, and\r\ngrow masters of slang, in from six weeks to two or three months. “I\r\nsuppose,” said one man familiar with their character, “they’d learn\r\nFrench as soon, if they was thrown into the way of it. They must learn\r\nslang to live, and as they have to wait at markets every now and then,\r\nfrom one hour to six, they associate one with another and carry on\r\nconversations in slang about the “penny gaffs” (theatres), criticising\r\nthe actors; or may be they toss the pieman, if they’ve got any\r\nha’pence, or else they chaff the passers by. The older ones may talk\r\nabout their sweethearts; but they always speak of them by the name of\r\n‘nammow’ (girls).\r\n\r\n“The boys are severe critics too (continued my informant) on dancing. I\r\nheard one say to another; ‘What do you think of Johnny Millicent’s new\r\nstep?’ for they always recognise a new step, or they discuss the female\r\ndancer’s legs, and not very decently. At other times the boys discuss\r\nthe merits or demerits of their masters, as to who feeds them best. I\r\nhave heard one say, ‘O, aint Bob stingy? We have bread and cheese!’\r\nAnother added; ‘_We_ have steak and beer, and I’ve the use of Bill’s,\r\n(the master’s) ’baccy box.’”\r\n\r\nSome of these lads are paid by the day, generally from 2_d._ or 3_d._\r\nand their food, and as much fruit as they think fit to eat, as by that\r\nthey soon get sick of it. They generally carry home fruit in their\r\npockets for their playmates, or brothers, or sisters; the costermongers\r\nallow this, if they are satisfied that the pocketing is not for sale.\r\nSome lads are engaged by the week, having from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._,\r\nand their food when out with their employer. Their lodging is found\r\nonly in a few cases, and then they sleep in the same room with their\r\nmaster and mistress. Of master or mistress, however, they never speak,\r\nbut of Jack and Bet. They behave respectfully to the women, who are\r\ngenerally kind to them. They soon desert a very surly or stingy master;\r\nthough such a fellow could get fifty boys next day if he wanted them,\r\nbut not lads used to the trade, for to these he’s well known by their\r\ntalk one with another, and they soon tell a man his character very\r\nplainly--“_very_ plainly indeed, sir, and to his face too,” said one.\r\n\r\nSome of these boys are well beaten by their employers; this they put up\r\nwith readily enough, if they experience kindness at the hands of the\r\nman’s wife; for, as I said before, parties that have never thought of\r\nmarriage, if they live together, call one another husbands and wives.\r\n\r\nIn “working the country” these lads are put on the same footing as\r\ntheir masters, with whom they eat, drink, and sleep; but they do not\r\ngamble with them. A few, however, go out and tempt country boys to\r\ngamble, and--as an almost inevitable consequence--to lose. “Some of\r\nthe boys,” said one who had seen it often, “will keep a number of\r\ncountrymen in a beer-shop in a roar for the hour, while the countrymen\r\nply them with beer, and some of the street-lads can drink a good deal.\r\nI’ve known three bits of boys order a pot of beer each, one after\r\nthe other, each paying his share, and a quartern of gin each after\r\nthat--drunk neat; they don’t understand water. Drink doesn’t seem to\r\naffect them as it does men. I don’t know why.” “Some costermongers,”\r\nsaid another informant, “have been known, when they’ve taken a fancy\r\nto a boy--I know of two--to dress him out like themselves, silk\r\nhandkerchiefs and all; for if they didn’t find them silk handkerchiefs,\r\nthe boys would soon get them out of their ‘_bunts_.’ They like silk\r\nhandkerchiefs, for if they lose all their money gambling, they can then\r\npledge their handkerchiefs.”\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the term “_bunts_.” Bunts is the money made by\r\nthe boys in this manner:--If a costermonger, after having sold a\r\nsufficiency, has 2_s._ or 3_s._ worth of goods left, and is anxious\r\nto get home, he says to the boy, “Work these streets, and bring me\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ for the tol,” (lot) which the costermonger knows by his\r\neye--for he seldom measures or counts--is easily worth that money. The\r\nlad then proceeds to sell the things entrusted to him, and often shows\r\ngreat ingenuity in so doing. If, for instance, turnips be tied up in\r\npenny bunches, the lad will open some of them, so as to spread them\r\nout to nearly twice their previous size, and if any one ask if that\r\nbe a penn’orth, he will say, “Here’s a larger for 1-1/2_d._, marm,”\r\nand so palm off a penny bunch at 1-1/2_d._ Out of each bunch of onions\r\nhe takes one or two, and makes an extra bunch. All that the lad can\r\nmake in this way over the half-crown is his own, and called “bunts.”\r\nBoys have made from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ “bunts,” and this day after\r\nday. Many of them will, in the course of their traffic, beg old boots\r\nor shoes, if they meet with better sort of people, and so “work it to\r\nrights,” as they call it among themselves; servants often give them\r\ncast-off clothes. It is seldom that a boy carries home less than the\r\nstipulated sum.\r\n\r\nThe above is what is understood as “fair bunts.”\r\n\r\n“Unfair bunts” is what the lad may make unknown to his master; as, if a\r\ncustomer call from the area for goods cried at 2_d._, the lad may get\r\n2-1/2_d._, by pretending what he had carried was a superior sort to\r\nthat called at 2_d._,--or by any similar trick.\r\n\r\n“I have known some civil and industrious boys,” said a costermonger\r\nto me, “get to save a few shillings, and in six months start with\r\na shallow, and so rise to a donkey-cart. The greatest drawback to\r\nstruggling boys is their sleeping in low lodging-houses, where they are\r\nfrequently robbed, or trepanned to part with their money, or else they\r\nget corrupted.”\r\n\r\nSome men employ from four to twelve boys, sending them out with\r\nshallows and barrows, the boys bringing home the proceeds. The men who\r\nsend lads out in this way, count the things, and can tell to a penny\r\nwhat can be realised on them. They neither pay nor treat the boys\r\nwell, I am told, and are looked upon by the other costermongers as\r\nextortioners, or unfair dealers, making money by trading on poor lads’\r\nnecessities, who serve them to avoid starvation. These men are called\r\n“Scurfs.” If the boys working for them make bunts, or are suspected of\r\nmaking bunts, there is generally “a row” about it.\r\n\r\nThe bunts is for the most part the gambling money, as well as the money\r\nfor the “penny gaff,” the “twopenny hop,” the tobacco, and the pudding\r\nmoney of the boys. “More would save their wages and their bunts,” was\r\nsaid to me on good authority, “but they have no place to keep their\r\nmoney in, and don’t understand anything about savings banks. Many of\r\nthese lads are looked on with suspicion by the police, and treated\r\nlike suspected folks; but in my opinion they are not thieves, or they\r\nwouldn’t work so hard; for a thief’s is a much easier life than a\r\ncostermonger’s.”\r\n\r\nWhen a boy begins business on his own account, or “sets up,” as they\r\ncall it, he purchases a shallow, which costs at least 1_s._, and a\r\nhalf hundred of herrings, 1_s._ 6_d._ By the sale of the herrings he\r\nwill clear 1_s._, going the round he has been accustomed to, and then\r\ntrade on the 2_s._ 6_d._ Or, if it be fruit time, he will trade in\r\napples until master of 5_s._, and then “take to a barrow,” at 3_d._ a\r\nday hire. By this system the ranks of the costermongers are not only\r\nrecruited but increased. There is one grand characteristic of these\r\nlads; I heard on all hands they are, every one of them, what the\r\ncosters call--“wide awake.”\r\n\r\nThere are I am assured from 200 to 300 costers, who, in the busier\r\ntimes of the year, send out four youths or lads each on an average. The\r\nyoung men thus sent out generally live with the costermonger, paying\r\n7_s._ a week for board, lodging and washing. These youths, I was told\r\nby one who knew them well, were people who “didn’t care to work for\r\nthemselves, because they couldn’t keep their money together; it would\r\nsoon all go; and they _must_ keep it together for their masters. They\r\nare not fed badly, but then they make ‘bunts’ sometimes, and it goes\r\nfor grub when they’re out, so they eat less at home.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE JUVENILE TRADING OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nMy inquiries among the costermongers induced one of their number\r\nto address me by letter. My correspondent--a well-informed and\r\nwell-educated man--describes himself as “being one of those that have\r\nbeen unfortunately thrust into that precarious way of obtaining a\r\nliving, not by choice but circumstances.” The writer then proceeds to\r\nsay: “No person but those actually connected with the streets can tell\r\nthe exertion, anxiety, and difficulties we have to undergo; and I know\r\nfor a fact it induces a great many to drink that would not do so, only\r\nto give them a stimulant to bear up against the troubles that they have\r\nto contend with; and so it ultimately becomes habitual. I could point\r\nout many instances of the kind. My chief object in addressing you is\r\nto give my humble suggestion as to the best means of alleviating our\r\npresent position in society, and establishing us in the eyes of the\r\npublic as a respectable body of men, honestly endeavouring to support\r\nour families, without becoming chargeable to the parish, and to show\r\nthat we are not all the degraded class we are at present thought to\r\nbe, subject to the derision of every passer by, and all looked upon as\r\nextortioners and the confederates of thieves. It is grievous to see\r\nchildren, as soon as they are able to speak, thrust into the streets\r\nto sell, and in many instances, I am sorry to state, to support their\r\nparents. Kind sir, picture to yourself a group of those children mixing\r\ntogether indiscriminately--the good with the bad--all uneducated--and\r\nwithout that parental care which is so essential for youth--and judge\r\nfor yourself the result: the lads in some instances take to thieving,\r\n(this being easier for a living), and the girls to prostitution; and so\r\nthey pass the greater part of their time in gaol, or get transported.\r\nEven those who are honestly disposed cannot have a chance of bettering\r\ntheir condition, in consequence of their being uneducated, so that\r\nthey often turn out brutal husbands and bad fathers. Surely, sir,\r\nGovernment could abolish in a measure this juvenile trading, so\r\nconducive to crime and so injurious to the shopkeeper, who is highly\r\nrated. How is it possible, if children congregate around his door\r\nwith the very articles he may deal in, that he can meet the demands\r\nfor rates and taxes; whereas the educated man, brought by want to\r\nsell in the streets, would not do so, but keep himself apart from the\r\nshopkeeper, and not merit his enmity, and the interference of the\r\npolice, which he necessarily claims. I have procured an existence\r\n(with a few years’ exception) in the streets for the last twenty-five\r\nyears as a general salesman of perishable and imperishable articles,\r\nand should be most happy to see anything done for the benefit of my\r\nclass. This juvenile trading I consider the root of the evil; after\r\nthe removal of this, the costermongers might, by classifying and\r\nco-operation, render themselves comparatively happy, in their position,\r\nand become acknowledged members of society.”\r\n\r\nAnother costermonger, in conversing with me concerning these young\r\ntraders, said, that many of them would ape the vices of men:\r\nmere urchins would simulate drunkenness, or boast, with many an\r\nexaggeration, of their drinking feats. They can get as much as they\r\nplease at the public-houses; and this too, I may add, despite the 43rd\r\nclause in the Police Act, which enacts, that “every person, licensed\r\nto deal in exciseable liquors within the said (Metropolitan Police)\r\nDistrict, who shall knowingly supply any sort of distilled exciseable\r\nliquor to be drunk upon the premises, to any boy or girl, apparently\r\nunder the age of sixteen years, shall be liable to a penalty of not\r\nmore than 20_s._;” and upon a second conviction to 40_s._ penalty; and\r\non a third to 5_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EDUCATION OF THE “COSTER-LADS.”\r\n\r\nAmong the costers the term education is (as I have already intimated)\r\nmerely understood as meaning a complete knowledge of the art of “buying\r\nin the cheapest market and selling in the dearest.” There are few lads\r\nwhose training extends beyond this. The father is the tutor, who takes\r\nthe boy to the different markets, instructs him in the art of buying,\r\nand when the youth is perfect on this point, the parent’s duty is\r\nsupposed to have been performed. Nearly all these boys are remarkable\r\nfor their precocious sharpness. To use the words of one of the class,\r\n“these young ones are as sharp as terriers, and learns every dodge of\r\nbusiness in less than half no time. There’s one I knows about three\r\nfeet high, that’s up to the business as clever as a man of thirty.\r\nThough he’s only twelve years old he’ll chaff down a peeler so uncommon\r\nsevere, that the only way to stop him is to take him in charge!”\r\n\r\nIt is idle to imagine that these lads, possessed of a mental acuteness\r\nalmost wonderful, will not educate themselves in vice, if we neglect\r\nto train them to virtue. At their youthful age, the power of acquiring\r\nknowledge is the strongest, and some kind of education is continually\r\ngoing on. If they are not taught by others, they will form their own\r\ncharacters--developing habits of dissipation, and educing all the\r\ngrossest passions of their natures, and learning to indulge in the\r\ngratification of every appetite without the least restraint.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a boy is old enough to shout well and loudly, his father\r\ntakes him into the streets. Some of these youths are not above seven\r\nyears of age, and it is calculated that not more than one in a hundred\r\nhas ever been to a school of any kind. The boy walks with the barrow,\r\nor guides the donkey, shouting by turns with the father, who, when the\r\ngoods are sold, will as a reward, let him ride home on the tray. The\r\nlad attends all markets with his father, who teaches him his business\r\nand shows him his tricks of trade; “for,” said a coster, “a governor in\r\nour line leaves the knowledge of all his dodges to his son, jist as the\r\nrich coves do their tin.”\r\n\r\nThe life of a coster-boy is a very hard one. In summer he will have\r\nto be up by four o’clock in the morning, and in winter he is never in\r\nbed after six. When he has returned from market, it is generally his\r\nduty to wash the goods and help dress the barrow. About nine he begins\r\nhis day’s work, shouting whilst the father pushes; and as very often\r\nthe man has lost his voice, this share of the labour is left entirely\r\nto him. When a coster has regular customers, the vegetables or fish\r\nare all sold by twelve o’clock, and in many coster families the lad is\r\nthen packed off with fruit to hawk in the streets. When the work is\r\nover, the father will perhaps take the boy to a public-house with him,\r\nand give him part of his beer. Sometimes a child of four or five is\r\ntaken to the tap-room, especially if he be pretty and the father proud\r\nof him. “I have seen,” said a coster to me, “a baby of five year old\r\nreeling drunk in a tap-room. His governor did it for the lark of the\r\nthing, to see him chuck hisself about--sillyfied like.”\r\n\r\nThe love of gambling soon seizes upon the coster boy. Youths of\r\nabout twelve or so will as soon as they can get away from work go to\r\na public-house and play cribbage for pints of beer, or for a pint\r\na corner. They generally continue playing till about midnight, and\r\nrarely--except on a Sunday--keep it up all night.\r\n\r\nIt ordinarily happens that when a lad is about thirteen, he quarrels\r\nwith his father, and gets turned away from home. Then he is forced to\r\nstart for himself. He knows where he can borrow stock-money and get his\r\nbarrow, for he is as well acquainted with the markets as the oldest\r\nhand at the business, and children may often be seen in the streets\r\nunder-selling their parents. “How’s it possible,” said a woman, “for\r\npeople to live when there’s their own son at the end of the court\r\na-calling his goods as cheap again as we can afford to sell ourn.”\r\n\r\nIf the boy is lucky in trade, his next want is to get a girl to keep\r\nhome for him. I was assured, that it is not at all uncommon for a lad\r\nof fifteen to be living with a girl of the same age, as man and wife.\r\nIt creates no disgust among his class, but seems rather to give him a\r\nposition among such people. Their courtship does not take long when\r\nonce the mate has been fixed upon. The girl is invited to “raffles,”\r\nand treated to “twopenny hops,” and half-pints of beer. Perhaps a silk\r\nneck handkerchief--a “King’s-man” is given as a present; though some of\r\nthe lads will, when the arrangement has been made, take the gift back\r\nagain and wear it themselves. The boys are very jealous, and if once\r\nmade angry behave with great brutality to the offending girl. A young\r\nfellow of about sixteen told me, as he seemed to grow angry at the very\r\nthought, “If I seed my gal a talking to another chap I’d fetch her sich\r\na punch of the nose as should plaguy quick stop the whole business.”\r\nAnother lad informed me, with a knowing look, “that the gals--it was\r\na rum thing now he come to think on it--axully liked a feller for\r\nwalloping them. As long as the bruises hurted, she was always thinking\r\non the cove as gived ’em her.” After a time, if the girl continues\r\nfaithful, the young coster may marry her; but this is rarely the case,\r\nand many live with their girls until they have grown to be men, or\r\nperhaps they may quarrel the very first year, and have a fight and part.\r\n\r\nThese boys hate any continuous work. So strong is this objection to\r\ncontinuity that they cannot even remain selling the same article for\r\nmore than a week together. Moreover none of them can be got to keep\r\nstalls. They must be perpetually on the move--or to use their own words\r\n“they like a roving life.” They all of them delight in dressing “flash”\r\nas they call it. If a “governor” was to try and “palm off” his old cord\r\njacket upon the lad that worked with him, the boy wouldn’t take it.\r\n“Its too big and seedy for me,” he’d say, “and I aint going to have\r\nyour leavings.” They try to dress like the men, with large pockets in\r\ntheir cord jackets and plenty of them. Their trowsers too must fit\r\ntight at the knee, and their boots they like as good as possible. A\r\ngood “King’s-man,” a plush skull cap, and a seam down the trowsers are\r\nthe great points of ambition with the coster boys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COSTER-GIRL.\r\n\r\n“Apples! An ’aypenny a lot, Apples!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nA lad about fourteen informed me that “brass buttons, like a huntman’s,\r\nwith foxes’ heads on em, looked stunning flash, and the gals liked em.”\r\nAs for the hair, they say it ought to be long in front, and done in\r\n“figure-six” curls, or twisted back to the ear “Newgate-knocker style.”\r\n“But the worst of hair is,” they add, “that it is always getting cut\r\noff in quod, all along of muzzling the bobbies.”\r\n\r\nThe whole of the coster-boys are fond of good living. I was told that\r\nwhen a lad started for himself, he would for the first week or so\r\nlive almost entirely on cakes and nuts. When settled in business they\r\nalways manage to have what they call “a relish” for breakfast and tea,\r\n“a couple of herrings, or a bit of bacon, or what not.” Many of them\r\nnever dine excepting on the Sunday--the pony and donkey proprietors\r\nbeing the only costers whose incomes will permit them to indulge in\r\na “fourpenny plate of meat at a cook’s shop.” The whole of the boys\r\ntoo are extremely fond of pudding, and should the “plum duff” at an\r\neating-house contain an unusual quantity of plums, the news soon\r\nspreads, and the boys then endeavour to work that way so as to obtain\r\na slice. While waiting for a market, the lads will very often spend\r\na shilling in the cakes and three cornered puffs sold by the Jews.\r\nThe owners toss for them, and so enable the young coster to indulge\r\nhis two favourite passions at the same time--his love of pastry, and\r\nhis love of gambling. The Jews crisp butter biscuits also rank very\r\nhigh with the boys, who declare that they “slip down like soapsuds\r\ndown a gully hole.” In fact it is curious to notice how perfectly\r\nunrestrained are the passions and appetites of these youths. The only\r\nthoughts that trouble them are for their girls, their eating and their\r\ngambling--beyond the love of self they have no tie that binds them to\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF A COSTER-LAD.\r\n\r\nOne lad that I spoke to gave me as much of his history as he could\r\nremember. He was a tall stout boy, about sixteen years old, with a face\r\nutterly vacant. His two heavy lead-coloured eyes stared unmeaningly at\r\nme, and, beyond a constant anxiety to keep his front lock curled on his\r\ncheek, he did not exhibit the slightest trace of feeling. He sank into\r\nhis seat heavily and of a heap, and when once settled down he remained\r\nmotionless, with his mouth open and his hands on his knees--almost as\r\nif paralyzed. He was dressed in all the slang beauty of his class, with\r\na bright red handkerchief and unexceptionable boots.\r\n\r\n“My father” he told me in a thick unimpassioned voice, “was a waggoner,\r\nand worked the country roads. There was two on us at home with mother,\r\nand we used to play along with the boys of our court, in Golding-lane,\r\nat buttons and marbles. I recollects nothing more than this--only the\r\nbig boys used to cheat like bricks and thump us if we grumbled--that’s\r\nall I recollects of my infancy, as you calls it. Father I’ve heard\r\ntell died when I was three and brother only a year old. It was worse\r\nluck for us!--Mother was so easy with us. I once went to school for\r\na couple of weeks, but the cove used to fetch me a wipe over the\r\nknuckles with his stick, and as I wasn’t going to stand that there,\r\nwhy you see I aint no great schollard. We did as we liked with mother,\r\nshe was so precious easy, and I never learned anything but playing\r\nbuttons and making leaden ‘bonces,’ that’s all,” (here the youth\r\nlaughed slightly.) “Mother used to be up and out very early washing in\r\nfamilies--anything for a living. She was a good mother to us. We was\r\nleft at home with the key of the room and some bread and butter for\r\ndinner. Afore she got into work--and it was a goodish long time--we was\r\nshocking hard up, and she pawned nigh everything. Sometimes, when we\r\nhad’nt no grub at all, the other lads, perhaps, would give us some of\r\ntheir bread and butter, but often our stomachs used to ache with the\r\nhunger, and we would cry when we was werry far gone. She used to be at\r\nwork from six in the morning till ten o’clock at night, which was a\r\nlong time for a child’s belly to hold out again, and when it was dark\r\nwe would go and lie down on the bed and try and sleep until she came\r\nhome with the food. I was eight year old then.\r\n\r\n“A man as know’d mother, said to her, ‘Your boy’s got nothing to do,\r\nlet him come along with me and yarn a few ha’pence,’ and so I became a\r\ncoster. He gave me 4_d._ a morning and my breakfast. I worked with him\r\nabout three year, until I learnt the markets, and then I and brother\r\ngot baskets of our own, and used to keep mother. One day with another,\r\nthe two on us together could make 2_s._ 6_d._ by selling greens of a\r\nmorning, and going round to the publics with nuts of a evening, till\r\nabout ten o’clock at night. Mother used to have a bit of fried meat or\r\na stew ready for us when we got home, and by using up the stock as we\r\ncouldn’t sell, we used to manage pretty tidy. When I was fourteen I\r\ntook up with a girl. She lived in the same house as we did, and I used\r\nto walk out of a night with her and give her half-pints of beer at the\r\npublics. She were about thirteen, and used to dress werry nice, though\r\nshe weren’t above middling pretty. Now I’m working for another man as\r\ngives me a shilling a week, victuals, washing, and lodging, just as if\r\nI was one of the family.\r\n\r\n“On a Sunday I goes out selling, and all I yarns I keeps. As for\r\ngoing to church, why, I can’t afford it,--besides, to tell the truth,\r\nI don’t like it well enough. Plays, too, ain’t in my line much; I’d\r\nsooner go to a dance--its more livelier. The ‘penny gaffs’ is rather\r\nmore in my style; the songs are out and out, and makes our gals laugh.\r\nThe smuttier the better, I thinks; bless you! the gals likes it as\r\nmuch as we do. If we lads ever has a quarrel, why, we fights for it.\r\nIf I was to let a cove off once, he’d do it again; but I never give\r\na lad a chance, so long as I can get anigh him. I never heard about\r\nChristianity; but if a cove was to fetch me a lick of the head, I’d\r\ngive it him again, whether he was a big ’un or a little ’un. I’d\r\nprecious soon see a henemy of mine shot afore I’d forgive him,--where’s\r\nthe use? Do I understand what behaving to your neighbour is?--In coorse\r\nI do. If a feller as lives next me wanted a basket of mine as I wasn’t\r\nusing, why, he might have it; if I was working it though, I’d see him\r\nfurther! I can understand that all as lives in a court is neighbours;\r\nbut as for policemen, they’re nothing to me, and I should like to pay\r\n’em all off well. No; I never heerd about this here creation you speaks\r\nabout. In coorse God Almighty made the world, and the poor bricklayers’\r\nlabourers built the houses arterwards--that’s _my_ opinion; but I\r\ncan’t say, for I’ve never been in no schools, only always hard at\r\nwork, and knows nothing about it. I have heerd a little about our\r\nSaviour,--they seem to say he were a goodish kind of a man; but if he\r\nsays as how a cove’s to forgive a feller as hits you, I should say he\r\nknow’d nothing about it. In coorse the gals the lads goes and lives\r\nwith thinks our walloping ’em wery cruel of us, but we don’t. Why don’t\r\nwe?--why, because we don’t. Before father died, I used sometimes to\r\nsay my prayers, but after that mother was too busy getting a living to\r\nmind about my praying. Yes, I knows!--in the Lord’s prayer they says,\r\n‘Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgives them as trespasses agin us.’\r\nIt’s a very good thing, in coorse, but no costers can’t do it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “PENNY GAFF.”\r\n\r\nIn many of the thoroughfares of London there are shops which have\r\nbeen turned into a kind of temporary theatre (admission one penny),\r\nwhere dancing and singing take place every night. Rude pictures of\r\nthe performers are arranged outside, to give the front a gaudy and\r\nattractive look, and at night-time coloured lamps and transparencies\r\nare displayed to draw an audience. These places are called by\r\nthe costers “Penny Gaffs;” and on a Monday night as many as six\r\nperformances will take place, each one having its two hundred visitors.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to contemplate the ignorance and immorality of so\r\nnumerous a class as that of the costermongers, without wishing to\r\ndiscover the cause of their degradation. Let any one curious on this\r\npoint visit one of these penny shows, and he will wonder that _any_\r\ntrace of virtue and honesty should remain among the people. Here the\r\nstage, instead of being the means for illustrating a moral precept, is\r\nturned into a platform to teach the cruelest debauchery. The audience\r\nis usually composed of children so young, that these dens become the\r\nschool-rooms where the guiding morals of a life are picked up; and so\r\nprecocious are the little things, that the girl of nine will, from\r\nconstant attendance at such places, have learnt to understand the\r\nfilthiest sayings, and laugh at them as loudly as the grown-up lads\r\naround her. What notions can the young female form of marriage and\r\nchastity, when the penny theatre rings with applause at the performance\r\nof a scene whose sole point turns upon the pantomimic imitation of the\r\nunrestrained indulgence of the most corrupt appetites of our nature?\r\nHow can the lad learn to check his hot passions and think honesty\r\nand virtue admirable, when the shouts around him impart a glory to a\r\ndescriptive song so painfully corrupt, that it can only have been made\r\ntolerable by the most habitual excess? The men who preside over these\r\ninfamous places know too well the failings of their audiences. They\r\nknow that these poor children require no nicely-turned joke to make the\r\nevening pass merrily, and that the filth they utter needs no double\r\nmeaning to veil its obscenity. The show that will provide the most\r\nunrestrained debauchery will have the most crowded benches; and to gain\r\nthis point, things are acted and spoken that it is criminal even to\r\nallude to.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to believe in the description which some of the more\r\nintelligent of the costermongers had given of these places, it was\r\nthought better to visit one of them, so that all exaggeration might be\r\navoided. One of the least offensive of the exhibitions was fixed upon.\r\n\r\nThe “penny gaff” chosen was situated in a broad street near Smithfield;\r\nand for a great distance off, the jingling sound of music was heard,\r\nand the gas-light streamed out into the thick night air as from a\r\ndark lantern, glittering on the windows of the houses opposite, and\r\nlighting up the faces of the mob in the road, as on an illumination\r\nnight. The front of a large shop had been entirely removed, and the\r\nentrance was decorated with paintings of the “comic singers,” in their\r\nmost “humourous” attitudes. On a table against the wall was perched\r\nthe band, playing what the costers call “dancing tunes” with great\r\neffect, for the hole at the money-taker’s box was blocked up with\r\nhands tendering the penny. The crowd without was so numerous, that a\r\npoliceman was in attendance to preserve order, and push the boys off\r\nthe pavement--the music having the effect of drawing them insensibly\r\ntowards the festooned green-baize curtain.\r\n\r\nThe shop itself had been turned into a waiting-room, and was crowded\r\neven to the top of the stairs leading to the gallery on the first\r\nfloor. The ceiling of this “lobby” was painted blue, and spotted\r\nwith whitewash clouds, to represent the heavens; the boards of the\r\ntrap-door, and the laths that showed through the holes in the plaster,\r\nbeing all of the same colour. A notice was here posted, over the\r\ncanvass door leading into the theatre, to the effect that “LADIES AND\r\nGENTLEMEN TO THE FRONT PLACES MUST PAY TWOPENCE.”\r\n\r\nThe visitors, with a few exceptions, were all boys and girls,\r\nwhose ages seemed to vary from eight to twenty years. Some of the\r\ngirls--though their figures showed them to be mere children--were\r\ndressed in showy cotton-velvet polkas, and wore dowdy feathers in\r\ntheir crushed bonnets. They stood laughing and joking with the lads,\r\nin an unconcerned, impudent manner, that was almost appalling. Some\r\nof them, when tired of waiting, chose their partners, and commenced\r\ndancing grotesquely, to the admiration of the lookers-on, who expressed\r\ntheir approbation in obscene terms, that, far from disgusting the poor\r\nlittle women, were received as compliments, and acknowledged with\r\nsmiles and coarse repartees. The boys clustered together, smoking\r\ntheir pipes, and laughing at each other’s anecdotes, or else jingling\r\nhalfpence in time with the tune, while they whistled an accompaniment\r\nto it. Presently one of the performers, with a gilt crown on his well\r\ngreased locks, descended from the staircase, his fleshings covered by\r\na dingy dressing-gown, and mixed with the mob, shaking hands with old\r\nacquaintances. The “comic singer,” too, made his appearance among the\r\nthrong--the huge bow to his cravat, which nearly covered his waistcoat,\r\nand the red end to his nose, exciting neither merriment nor surprise.\r\n\r\nTo discover the kind of entertainment, a lad near me and my companion\r\nwas asked “if there was any flash dancing.” With a knowing wink the boy\r\nanswered, “Lots! show their legs and all, prime!” and immediately the\r\nboy followed up his information by a request for a “yennep” to get a\r\n“tib of occabot.” After waiting in the lobby some considerable time,\r\nthe performance inside was concluded, and the audience came pouring\r\nout through the canvass door. As they had to pass singly, I noticed\r\nthem particularly. Above three-fourths of them were women and girls,\r\nthe rest consisting chiefly of mere boys--for out of about two hundred\r\npersons I counted only eighteen men. Forward they came, bringing an\r\noverpowering stench with them, laughing and yelling as they pushed\r\ntheir way through the waiting-room. One woman carrying a sickly child\r\nwith a bulging forehead, was reeling drunk, the saliva running down her\r\nmouth as she stared about her with a heavy fixed eye. Two boys were\r\npushing her from side to side, while the poor infant slept, breathing\r\nheavily, as if stupified, through the din. Lads jumping on girls’\r\nshoulders, and girls laughing hysterically from being tickled by the\r\nyouths behind them, every one shouting and jumping, presented a mad\r\nscene of frightful enjoyment.\r\n\r\nWhen these had left, a rush for places by those in waiting began, that\r\nset at defiance the blows and strugglings of a lady in spangles who\r\nendeavoured to preserve order and take the checks. As time was a great\r\nobject with the proprietor, the entertainment within began directly the\r\nfirst seat was taken, so that the lads without, rendered furious by the\r\nrattling of the piano within, made the canvass partition bulge in and\r\nout, with the strugglings of those seeking admission, like a sail in a\r\nflagging wind.\r\n\r\nTo form the theatre, the first floor had been removed; the whitewashed\r\nbeams however still stretched from wall to wall. The lower room had\r\nevidently been the warehouse, while the upper apartment had been the\r\nsitting-room, for the paper was still on the walls. A gallery, with\r\na canvass front, had been hurriedly built up, and it was so fragile\r\nthat the boards bent under the weight of those above. The bricks in\r\nthe warehouse were smeared over with red paint, and had a few black\r\ncurtains daubed upon them. The coster-youths require no very great\r\nscenic embellishment, and indeed the stage--which was about eight feet\r\nsquare--could admit of none. Two jets of gas, like those outside a\r\nbutcher’s shop, were placed on each side of the proscenium, and proved\r\nvery handy for the gentlemen whose pipes required lighting. The band\r\ninside the “theatre” could not compare with the band without. An old\r\ngrand piano, whose canvass-covered top extended the entire length of\r\nthe stage, sent forth its wiry notes under the be-ringed fingers of\r\na “professor Wilkinsini,” while another professional, with his head\r\nresting on his violin, played vigorously, as he stared unconcernedly at\r\nthe noisy audience.\r\n\r\nSinging and dancing formed the whole of the hours’ performance, and,\r\nof the two, the singing was preferred. A young girl, of about fourteen\r\nyears of age, danced with more energy than grace, and seemed to be\r\nwell-known to the spectators, who cheered her on by her Christian name.\r\nWhen the dance was concluded, the proprietor of the establishment threw\r\ndown a penny from the gallery, in the hopes that others might be moved\r\nto similar acts of generosity; but no one followed up the offering,\r\nso the young lady hunted after the money and departed. The “comic\r\nsinger,” in a battered hat and the huge bow to his cravat, was received\r\nwith deafening shouts. Several songs were named by the costers, but\r\nthe “funny gentleman” merely requested them “to hold their jaws,” and\r\nputting on a “knowing” look, sang a song, the whole point of which\r\nconsisted in the mere utterance of some filthy word at the end of each\r\nstanza. Nothing, however, could have been more successful. The lads\r\nstamped their feet with delight; the girls screamed with enjoyment.\r\nOnce or twice a young shrill laugh would anticipate the fun--as if\r\nthe words were well known--or the boys would forestall the point by\r\nshouting it out before the proper time. When the song was ended the\r\nhouse was in a delirium of applause. The canvass front to the gallery\r\nwas beaten with sticks, drum-like, and sent down showers of white\r\npowder on the heads in the pit. Another song followed, and the actor\r\nknowing on what his success depended, lost no opportunity of increasing\r\nhis laurels. The most obscene thoughts, the most disgusting scenes\r\nwere coolly described, making a poor child near me wipe away the tears\r\nthat rolled down her eyes with the enjoyment of the poison. There were\r\nthree or four of these songs sung in the course of the evening, each\r\none being encored, and then changed. One written about “Pine-apple\r\nrock,” was the grand treat of the night, and offered greater scope to\r\nthe rhyming powers of the author than any of the others. In this, not a\r\nsingle chance had been missed; ingenuity had been exerted to its utmost\r\nlest an obscene thought should be passed by, and it was absolutely\r\nawful to behold the relish with which the young ones jumped to the\r\nhideous meaning of the verses.\r\n\r\nThere was one scene yet to come, that was perfect in its wickedness.\r\nA ballet began between a man dressed up as a woman, and a country\r\nclown. The most disgusting attitudes were struck, the most immoral\r\nacts represented, without one dissenting voice. If there had been any\r\nfeat of agility, any grimacing, or, in fact, anything with which the\r\nlaughter of the uneducated classes is usually associated, the applause\r\nmight have been accounted for; but here were two ruffians degrading\r\nthemselves each time they stirred a limb, and forcing into the brains\r\nof the childish audience before them thoughts that must embitter a\r\nlifetime, and descend from father to child like some bodily infirmity.\r\n\r\nWhen I had left, I spoke to a better class costermonger on this\r\nsaddening subject. “Well, sir, it is frightful,” he said, “but the boys\r\n_will_ have their amusements. If their amusements is bad they don’t\r\ncare; they only wants to laugh, and this here kind of work does it.\r\nGive ’em better singing and better dancing, and they’d go, if the price\r\nwas as cheap as this is. I’ve seen, when a decent concert was given at\r\na penny, as many as four thousand costers present, behaving themselves\r\nas quietly and decently as possible. Their wives and children was with\r\n’em, and no audience was better conducted. It’s all stuff talking about\r\nthem preferring this sort of thing. Give ’em good things at the same\r\nprice, and I _know_ they will like the good, better than the bad.”\r\n\r\nMy own experience with this neglected class goes to prove, that if\r\nwe would really lift them out of the moral mire in which they are\r\nwallowing, the first step must be to provide them with _wholesome_\r\namusements. The misfortune, however, is, that when we seek to elevate\r\nthe character of the people, we give them such mere dry abstract\r\ntruths and dogmas to digest, that the uneducated mind turns with\r\nabhorrence from them. We forget how we ourselves were originally won\r\nby our _emotions_ to the consideration of such subjects. We do not\r\nremember how our own tastes have been formed, nor do we, in our zeal,\r\nstay to reflect how the tastes of a people generally are created; and,\r\nconsequently, we cannot perceive that a habit of enjoying any matter\r\nwhatsoever can only be induced in the mind by linking with it some\r\næsthetic affection. The heart is the mainspring of the intellect, and\r\nthe feelings the real educers and educators of the thoughts. As games\r\nwith the young destroy the fatigue of muscular exercise, so do the\r\nsympathies stir the mind to action without any sense of effort. It is\r\nbecause “serious” people generally object to enlist the emotions in the\r\neducation of the poor, and look upon the delight which arises in the\r\nmind from the mere perception of the beauty of sound, motion, form,\r\nand colour--or from the apt association of harmonious or incongruous\r\nideas--or from the sympathetic operation of the affections; it is\r\nbecause, I say, the zealous portion of society look upon these matters\r\nas “_vanity_,” that the amusements of the working-classes are left to\r\nvenal traders to provide. Hence, in the low-priced entertainments\r\nwhich necessarily appeal to the poorer, and, therefore, to the least\r\neducated of the people, the proprietors, instead of trying to develop\r\nin them the purer sources of delight, seek only to gratify their\r\naudience in the coarsest manner, by appealing to their most brutal\r\nappetites. And thus the emotions, which the great Architect of the\r\nhuman mind gave us as the means of quickening our imaginations and\r\nrefining our sentiments, are made the instruments of crushing every\r\noperation of the intellect and debasing our natures. It is idle and\r\nunfeeling to believe that the great majority of a people whose days are\r\npassed in excessive toil, and whose homes are mostly of an uninviting\r\ncharacter, will forego _all_ amusements, and consent to pass their\r\nevenings by their _no_ firesides, reading tracts or singing hymns.\r\nIt is folly to fancy that the mind, spent with the irksomeness of\r\ncompelled labour, and depressed, perhaps, with the struggle to live\r\nby that labour after all, will not, when the work is over, seek out\r\nsome place where at least it can forget its troubles or fatigues in\r\nthe temporary pleasure begotten by some mental or physical stimulant.\r\nIt is because we exact too much of the poor--because we, as it were,\r\nstrive to make true knowledge and true beauty as forbidding as possible\r\nto the uneducated and unrefined, that they fly to their penny gaffs,\r\ntheir twopenny-hops, their beer-shops, and their gambling-grounds for\r\npleasures which we deny them, and which we, in our arrogance, believe\r\nit is possible for them to do without.\r\n\r\nThe experiment so successfully tried at Liverpool of furnishing music\r\nof an enlivening and yet elevating character at the same price as the\r\nconcerts of the lowest grade, shows that the people may be won to\r\ndelight in beauty instead of beastiality, and teaches us again that\r\nit is _our_ fault to allow them to be as they are and not their’s to\r\nremain so. All men are compound animals, with many inlets of pleasure\r\nto their brains, and if one avenue be closed against them, why it but\r\nforces them to seek delight through another. So far from the perception\r\nof beauty inducing habits of gross enjoyment as “serious” people\r\ngenerally imagine, a moment’s reflection will tell us that these very\r\nhabits are only the necessary consequences of the non-development\r\nof the æsthetic faculty; for the two assuredly cannot co-exist. To\r\ncultivate the sense of the beautiful is necessarily to inculcate a\r\ndetestation of the sensual. Moreover, it is impossible for the mind\r\nto be accustomed to the contemplation of what is admirable without\r\ncontinually mounting to higher and higher forms of it--from the beauty\r\nof nature to that of thought--from thought to feeling, from feeling\r\nto action, and lastly to the fountain of all goodness--the great\r\nmunificent Creator of the sea, the mountains, and the flowers--the\r\nstars, the sunshine, and the rainbow--the fancy, the reason, the love\r\nand the heroism of man and womankind--the instincts of the beasts--the\r\nglory of the angels--and the mercy of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTER-GIRLS.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers, taken as a body, entertain the most imperfect idea\r\nof the sanctity of marriage. To their undeveloped minds it merely\r\nconsists in the fact of a man and woman living together, and sharing\r\nthe gains they may each earn by selling in the street. The father and\r\nmother of the girl look upon it as a convenient means of shifting the\r\nsupport of their child over to another’s exertions; and so thoroughly\r\ndo they believe this to be the end and aim of matrimony, that the\r\nexpense of a church ceremony is considered as a useless waste of money,\r\nand the new pair are received by their companions as cordially as if\r\nevery form of law and religion had been complied with.\r\n\r\nThe notions of morality among these people agree strangely, as I have\r\nsaid, with those of many savage tribes--indeed, it would be curious if\r\nit were otherwise. They are a part of the Nomades of England, neither\r\nknowing nor caring for the enjoyments of home. The hearth, which is\r\nso sacred a symbol to all civilized races as being the spot where the\r\nvirtues of each succeeding generation are taught and encouraged, has\r\nno charms to them. The tap-room is the father’s chief abiding place;\r\nwhilst to the mother the house is only a better kind of _tent_. She\r\nis away at the stall, or hawking her goods from morning till night,\r\nwhile the children are left to play away the day in the court or\r\nalley, and pick their morals out of the gutter. So long as the limbs\r\ngain strength the parent cares for nothing else. As the young ones\r\ngrow up, their only notions of wrong are formed by what the policeman\r\nwill permit them to do. If we, who have known from babyhood the kindly\r\ninfluences of a home, require, before we are thrust out into the world\r\nto get a living for ourselves, that our perceptions of good and evil\r\nshould be quickened and brightened (the same as our perceptions of\r\ntruth and falsity) by the experience and counsel of those who are wiser\r\nand better than ourselves,--if, indeed, it needed a special creation\r\nand example to teach the best and strongest of us the law of right,\r\nhow bitterly must the children of the street-folk require tuition,\r\ntraining, and advice, when from their very cradles (if, indeed, they\r\never knew such luxuries) they are doomed to witness in their parents,\r\nwhom they naturally believe to be their superiors, habits of life in\r\nwhich passion is the sole rule of action, and where every appetite of\r\nour animal nature is indulged in without the least restraint.\r\n\r\nI say thus much because I am anxious to make others feel, as I do\r\nmyself, that _we_ are the culpable parties in these matters. That they\r\npoor things should do as they do is but human nature--but that _we_\r\nshould allow them to remain thus destitute of every blessing vouchsafed\r\nto ourselves--that we should willingly share what we enjoy with our\r\nbrethren at the Antipodes, and yet leave those who are nearer and who,\r\ntherefore, should be dearer to us, to want even the commonest moral\r\nnecessaries is a paradox that gives to the zeal of our Christianity a\r\nstrong savour of the chicanery of Cant.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers strongly resemble the North American Indians in their\r\nconduct to their wives. They can understand that it is the duty of\r\nthe woman to contribute to the happiness of the man, but cannot feel\r\nthat there is a reciprocal duty from the man to the woman. The wife\r\nis considered as an inexpensive servant, and the disobedience of a\r\nwish is punished with blows. She must work early and late, and to the\r\nhusband must be given the proceeds of her labour. Often when the man\r\nis in one of his drunken fits--which sometimes last two or three days\r\ncontinuously--she must by her sole exertions find food for herself and\r\nhim too. To live in peace with him, there must be no murmuring, no\r\ntiring under work, no fancied cause for jealousy--for if there be, she\r\nis either beaten into submission or cast adrift to begin life again--as\r\nanother’s leavings.\r\n\r\nThe story of one coster girl’s life may be taken as a type of the many.\r\nWhen quite young she is placed out to nurse with some neighbour, the\r\nmother--if a fond one--visiting the child at certain periods of the\r\nday, for the purpose of feeding it, or sometimes, knowing the round she\r\nhas to make, having the infant brought to her at certain places, to be\r\n“suckled.” As soon as it is old enough to go alone, the court is its\r\nplay-ground, the gutter its school-room, and under the care of an elder\r\nsister the little one passes the day, among children whose mothers\r\nlike her own are too busy out in the streets helping to get the food,\r\nto be able to mind the family at home. When the girl is strong enough,\r\nshe in her turn is made to assist the mother by keeping guard over\r\nthe younger children, or, if there be none, she is lent out to carry\r\nabout a baby, and so made to add to the family income by gaining her\r\nsixpence weekly. Her time is from the earliest years fully occupied;\r\nindeed, her parents cannot afford to keep her without doing and getting\r\n_something_. Very few of the children receive the least education. “The\r\nparents,” I am told, “never give their minds to learning, for they say,\r\n‘What’s the use of it? _that_ won’t yarn a gal a living.’” Everything\r\nis sacrificed--as, indeed, under the circumstances it must be--in the\r\nstruggle to live--aye! and to live _merely_. Mind, heart, soul, are all\r\nabsorbed in the belly. The rudest form of animal life, physiologists\r\ntell us, is simply a locomotive stomach. Verily, it would appear as if\r\nour social state had a tendency to make the highest animal sink into\r\nthe lowest.\r\n\r\nAt about seven years of age the girls first go into the streets to\r\nsell. A shallow-basket is given to them, with about two shillings for\r\nstock-money, and they hawk, according to the time of year, either\r\noranges, apples, or violets; some begin their street education with\r\nthe sale of water-cresses. The money earned by this means is strictly\r\ngiven to the parents. Sometimes--though rarely--a girl who has been\r\nunfortunate during the day will not dare to return home at night, and\r\nthen she will sleep under some dry arch or about some market, until the\r\nmorrow’s gains shall ensure her a safe reception and shelter in her\r\nfather’s room.\r\n\r\nThe life of the coster-girls is as severe as that of the boys. Between\r\nfour and five in the morning they have to leave home for the markets,\r\nand sell in the streets until about nine. Those that have more kindly\r\nparents, return then to breakfast, but many are obliged to earn the\r\nmorning’s meal for themselves. After breakfast, they generally remain\r\nin the streets until about ten o’clock at night; many having nothing\r\nduring all that time but one meal of bread and butter and coffee, to\r\nenable them to support the fatigue of walking from street to street\r\nwith the heavy basket on their heads. In the course of a day, some\r\ngirls eat as much as a pound of bread, and very seldom get any meat,\r\nunless it be on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nThere are many poor families that, without the aid of these girls,\r\nwould be forced into the workhouse. They are generally of an\r\naffectionate disposition, and some will perform acts of marvellous\r\nheroism to keep together the little home. It is not at all unusual\r\nfor mere children of fifteen to walk their eight or ten miles a day,\r\ncarrying a basket of nearly two hundred weight on their heads. A\r\njourney to Woolwich and back, or to the towns near London, is often\r\nundertaken to earn the 1_s._ 6_d._ their parents are anxiously waiting\r\nfor at home.\r\n\r\nVery few of these girls are married to the men they afterwards live\r\nwith. Their courtship is usually a very short one; for, as one told\r\nme, “the life is such a hard one, that a girl is ready to get rid of\r\na _little_ of the labour at any price.” The coster-lads see the girls\r\nat market, and if one of them be pretty, and a boy take a fancy to\r\nher, he will make her bargains for her, and carry her basket home.\r\nSometimes a coster working his rounds will feel a liking for a wench\r\nselling her goods in the street, and will leave his barrow to go and\r\ntalk with her. A girl seldom takes up with a lad before she is sixteen,\r\nthough some of them, when barely fifteen or even fourteen, will pair\r\noff. They court for a time, going to raffles and “gaffs” together, and\r\nthen the affair is arranged. The girl tells her parents “she’s going to\r\nkeep company with so-and-so,” packs up what things she has, and goes\r\nat once, without a word of remonstrance from either father or mother.\r\nA furnished room, at about 4_s._ a week is taken, and the young couple\r\nbegin life. The lad goes out as usual with his barrow, and the girl\r\ngoes out with her basket, often working harder for her lover than she\r\nhad done for her parents. They go to market together, and at about nine\r\no’clock her day’s selling begins. Very often she will take out with her\r\nin the morning what food she requires during the day, and never return\r\nhome until eleven o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nThe men generally behave very cruelly to the girls they live with.\r\nThey are as faithful to them as if they were married, but they\r\nare jealous in the extreme. To see a man talking to their girl is\r\nsufficient to ensure the poor thing a beating. They sometimes ill-treat\r\nthem horribly--most unmercifully indeed--nevertheless the girls say\r\nthey cannot help loving them still, and continue working for them, as\r\nif they experienced only kindness at their hands. Some of the men are\r\ngentler and more considerate in their treatment of them, but by far\r\nthe larger portion are harsh and merciless. Often when the Saturday\r\nnight’s earnings of the two have been large, the man will take the\r\nentire money, and as soon as the Sunday’s dinner is over, commence\r\ndrinking hard, and continue drunk for two or three days together, until\r\nthe funds are entirely exhausted. The women never gamble; they say, “it\r\ngives them no excitement.” They prefer, if they have a spare moment\r\nin the evening, sitting near the fire making up and patching their\r\nclothes. “Ah, sir,” said a girl to me, “a neat gown does a deal with a\r\nman; he always likes a girl best when everybody else likes her too.” On\r\na Sunday they clean their room for the week and go for a treat, if they\r\ncan persuade their young man to take them out in the afternoon, either\r\nto Chalk Farm or Battersea Fields--“where there’s plenty of life.”\r\n\r\nAfter a girl has once grown accustomed to a street-life, it is almost\r\nimpossible to wean her from it. The muscular irritability begotten by\r\ncontinued wandering makes her unable to rest for any time in one place,\r\nand she soon, if put to any _settled_ occupation, gets to crave for the\r\nsevere exercise she formerly enjoyed. The least restraint will make\r\nher sigh after the perfect liberty of the coster’s “roving life.” As\r\nan instance of this I may relate a fact that has occurred within the\r\nlast six months. A gentleman of high literary repute, struck with the\r\nheroic strugglings of a coster Irish girl to maintain her mother, took\r\nher to his house, with a view of teaching her the duties of a servant.\r\nAt first the transition was a painful one to the poor thing. Having\r\ntravelled barefoot through the streets since a mere child, the pressure\r\nof shoes was intolerable to her, and in the evening or whenever a few\r\nminutes’ rest could be obtained, the boots were taken off, for with\r\nthem on she could enjoy no ease. The perfect change of life, and the\r\nnovelty of being in a new place, reconciled her for some time to the\r\nloss of her liberty. But no sooner did she hear from her friends, that\r\nsprats were again in the market, than, as if there were some magical\r\ninfluence in the fish, she at once requested to be freed from the\r\nconfinement, and permitted to return to her old calling.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the lower class of girls, though this lower\r\nclass, I regret to say, constitutes by far the greater portion of the\r\nwhole. Still I would not for a moment have it inferred that _all_\r\nare bad. There are many young girls getting their living, or rather\r\nhelping to get the living of others in the streets, whose goodness,\r\nconsidering the temptations and hardships besetting such an occupation,\r\napproximates to the marvellous. As a type of the more prudent class of\r\ncoster girls, I would cite the following narrative received from the\r\nlips of a young woman in answer to a series of questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF A COSTER GIRL.\r\n\r\nI wished to have obtained a statement from the girl whose portrait is\r\nhere given, but she was afraid to give the slightest information about\r\nthe habits of her companions, lest they should recognize her by the\r\nengraving and persecute her for the revelations she might make. After\r\ndisappointing me some dozen times, I was forced to seek out some other\r\ncoster girl.\r\n\r\nThe one I fixed upon was a fine-grown young woman of eighteen. She\r\nhad a habit of curtsying to every question that was put to her. Her\r\nplaid shawl was tied over the breast, and her cotton-velvet bonnet was\r\ncrushed in with carrying her basket. She seemed dreadfully puzzled\r\nwhere to put her hands, at one time tucking them under her shawl,\r\nwarming them at the fire, or measuring the length of her apron, and\r\nwhen she answered a question she invariably addressed the fireplace.\r\nHer voice was husky from shouting apples.\r\n\r\n“My mother has been in the streets selling all her lifetime. Her uncle\r\nlearnt her the markets and she learnt me. When business grew bad she\r\nsaid to me, ‘Now you shall take care on the stall, and I’ll go and\r\nwork out charing.’ The way she learnt me the markets was to judge of\r\nthe weight of the baskets of apples, and then said she, ‘Always bate\r\n’em down, a’most a half.’ I always liked the street-life very well,\r\nthat was if I was selling. I have mostly kept a stall myself, but I’ve\r\nknown gals as walk about with apples, as have told me that the weight\r\nof the baskets is sich that the neck cricks, and when the load is took\r\noff, its just as if you’d a stiff neck, and the head feels as light as\r\na feather. The gals begins working very early at our work; the parents\r\nmakes them go out when a’most babies. There’s a little gal, I’m sure\r\nshe an’t more than half-past seven, that stands selling water-cresses\r\nnext my stall, and mother was saying, ‘Only look there, how that little\r\none has to get her living afore she a’most knows what a penn’orth\r\nmeans.’\r\n\r\n“There’s six on us in family, and father and mother makes eight.\r\nFather used to do odd jobs with the gas-pipes in the streets, and\r\nwhen work was slack we had very hard times of it. Mother always liked\r\nbeing with us at home, and used to manage to keep us employed out of\r\nmischief--she’d give us an old gown to make into pinafores for the\r\nchildren and such like! She’s been very good to us, has mother, and\r\nso’s father. She always liked to hear us read to her whilst she was\r\nwashing or such like! and then we big ones had to learn the little\r\nones. But when father’s work got slack, if she had no employment\r\ncharing, she’d say, ‘Now I’ll go and buy a bushel of apples,’ and then\r\nshe’d turn out and get a penny that way. I suppose by sitting at the\r\nstall from nine in the morning till the shops shuts up--say ten o’clock\r\nat night, I can earn about 1_s._ 6_d._ a day. It’s all according to the\r\napples--whether they’re good or not--what we makes. If I’m unlucky,\r\nmother will say, ‘Well, I’ll go out to-morrow and see what _I_ can\r\ndo;’ and if I’ve done well, she’ll say ‘Come you’re a good hand at it;\r\nyou’ve done famous.’ Yes, mother’s very fair that way. Ah! there’s many\r\na gal I knows whose back has to suffer if she don’t sell her stock\r\nwell; but, thank God! I never get more than a blowing up. My parents is\r\nvery fair to me.\r\n\r\n“I dare say there ain’t ten out of a hundred gals what’s living with\r\nmen, what’s been married Church of England fashion. I know plenty\r\nmyself, but I don’t, indeed, think it right. It seems to me that the\r\ngals is fools to be ’ticed away, but, in coorse, they needn’t go\r\nwithout they likes. This is why I don’t think it’s right. Perhaps a\r\nman will have a few words with his gal, and he’ll say, ‘Oh! I ain’t\r\nobligated to keep her!’ and he’ll turn her out: and then where’s that\r\npoor gal to go? Now, there’s a gal I knows as came to me no later than\r\nthis here week, and she had a dreadful swole face and a awful black\r\neye; and I says, ‘Who’s done that?’ and she says, says she, ‘Why,\r\nJack’--just in that way; and then she says, says she, ‘I’m going to\r\ntake a warrant out to-morrow.’ Well, he gets the warrant that same\r\nnight, but she never appears again him, for fear of getting more\r\nbeating. That don’t seem to me to be like married people ought to be.\r\nBesides, if parties is married, they ought to bend to each other; and\r\nthey won’t, for sartain, if they’re only living together. A man as is\r\nmarried is obligated to keep his wife if they quarrels or not; and he\r\nsays to himself, says he, ‘Well, I may as well live happy, like.’ But\r\nif he can turn a poor gal off, as soon as he tires of her, he begins\r\nto have noises with her, and then gets quit of her altogether. Again,\r\nthe men takes the money of the gals, and in coorse ought to treat ’em\r\nwell--which they don’t. This is another reason: when the gal is in the\r\nfamily way, the lads mostly sends them to the workhouse to lay in, and\r\nonly goes sometimes to take them a bit of tea and shuggar; but, in\r\ncoorse, married men wouldn’t behave in such likes to their poor wives.\r\nAfter a quarrel, too, a lad goes and takes up with another young gal,\r\nand that isn’t pleasant for the first one. The first step to ruin is\r\nthem places of ‘penny gaffs,’ for they hears things there as oughtn’t\r\nto be said to young gals. Besides, the lads is very insinivating, and\r\nafter leaving them places will give a gal a drop of beer, and make her\r\nhalf tipsy, and then they makes their arrangements. I’ve often heerd\r\nthe boys boasting of having ruined gals, for all the world as if they\r\nwas the first noblemen in the land.\r\n\r\n“It would be a good thing if these sort of goings on could be stopped.\r\nIt’s half the parents’ fault; for if a gal can’t get a living, they\r\nturns her out into the streets, and then what’s to become of her? I’m\r\nsure the gals, if they was married, would be happier, because they\r\ncouldn’t be beat worse. And if they was married, they’d get a nice\r\nhome about ’em; whereas, if they’s only living together, they takes a\r\nfurnished room. I’m sure, too, that it’s a bad plan; for I’ve heerd\r\nthe gals themselves say, ‘Ah! I wish I’d never seed Jack’ (or Tom, or\r\nwhatever it is); ‘I’m sure I’d never be half so bad but for him.’\r\n\r\n“Only last night father was talking about religion. We often talks\r\nabout religion. Father has told me that God made the world, and I’ve\r\nheerd him talk about the first man and woman as was made and lived--it\r\nmust be more than a hundred years ago--but I don’t like to speak on\r\nwhat I don’t know. Father, too, has told me about our Saviour what\r\nwas nailed on a cross to suffer for such poor people as we is. Father\r\nhas told us, too, about his giving a great many poor people a penny\r\nloaf and a bit of fish each, which proves him to have been a very kind\r\ngentleman. The Ten Commandments was made by him, I’ve heerd say, and\r\nhe performed them too among other miracles. Yes! this is part of what\r\nour Saviour tells us. We are to forgive everybody, and do nobody no\r\ninjury. I don’t think I could forgive an enemy if she injured me very\r\nmuch; I’m sure I don’t know why I couldn’t, unless it is that I’m poor,\r\nand never learnt to do it. If a gal stole my shawl and didn’t return\r\nit back or give me the value on it, I couldn’t forgive her; but if she\r\ntold me she lost it off her back, I shouldn’t be so hard on her. We\r\npoor gals ain’t very religious, but we are better than the men. We all\r\nof us thanks God for everything--even for a fine day; as for sprats,\r\nwe always says they’re God’s blessing for the poor, and thinks it hard\r\nof the Lord Mayor not to let ’em come in afore the ninth of November,\r\njust because he wants to dine off them--which he always do. Yes, we\r\nknows for certain that they eats plenty of sprats at the Lord Mayor’s\r\n‘blanket.’ They say in the Bible that the world was made in six days:\r\nthe beasts, the birds, the fish, and all--and sprats was among them in\r\ncoorse. There was only one house at that time as was made, and that\r\nwas the Ark for Adam and Eve and their family. It seems very wonderful\r\nindeed how all this world was done so quick. I should have thought\r\nthat England alone would have took double the time; shouldn’t you,\r\nsir? But then it says in the Bible, God Almighty’s a just and true\r\nGod, and in coorse time would be nothing to him. When a good person is\r\ndying, we says, ‘The Lord has called upon him, and he must go,’ but I\r\ncan’t think what it means, unless it is that an angel comes--like when\r\nwe’re a-dreaming--and tells the party he’s wanted in heaven. I know\r\nwhere heaven is; it’s above the clouds, and they’re placed there to\r\nprevent us seeing into it. That’s where all the good people go, but I’m\r\nafeerd,”--she continued solemnly--“there’s very few costers among the\r\nangels--’specially those as deceives poor gals.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think this world could well go on for ever. There’s\r\na great deal of ground in it, certainly, and it seems very strong\r\nat present; but they say there’s to be a flood on the earth, and\r\nearthquakes, and that will destroy it. The earthquake ought to have\r\ntook place some time ago, as people tells me, but I never heerd any\r\nmore about it. If we cheats in the streets, I know we shan’t go to\r\nHeaven; but it’s very hard upon us, for if we didn’t cheat we couldn’t\r\nlive, profits is so bad. It’s the same with the shops, and I suppose\r\nthe young men there won’t go to Heaven neither; but if people won’t\r\ngive the money, both costers and tradesmen must cheat, and that’s very\r\nhard. Why, look at apples! customers want them for less than they cost\r\nus, and so we are forced to shove in bad ones as well as good ones; and\r\nif we’re to suffer for that, it does seem to me dreadful cruel.”\r\n\r\nCurious and extravagant as this statement may perhaps appear to the\r\nuninitiated, nevertheless it is here given as it was spoken; and it was\r\nspoken with an earnestness that proved the poor girl looked upon it as\r\na subject, the solemnity of which forced her to be truthful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF COSTERMONGERS AND THIEVES.\r\n\r\nConcerning the connection of these two classes I had the following\r\naccount from a costermonger: “I’ve known the coster trade for twelve\r\nyears, and never knew thieves go out a costering as a cloak; they may\r\nhave done so, but I very much doubt it. Thieves go for an idle life,\r\nand costermongering don’t suit them. Our chaps don’t care a d--n who\r\nthey associate with,--if they’re thieves they meet ’em all the same,\r\nor anything that way. But costers buy what they call ‘a gift,’--may-be\r\nit’s a watch or coat wot’s been stolen--from any that has it to sell. A\r\nman will say: ‘If you’ve a few shillings, you may make a good thing of\r\nit. Why this identical watch is only twenty shillings, and it’s worth\r\nfifty;’ so if the coster has money, he buys. Thieves will get 3_d._\r\nwhere a mechanic or a coster will earn 1/2_d._, and the most ignorant\r\nof our people has a queer sort of respect for thieves, because of the\r\nmoney they make. Poverty’s as much despised among costers as among\r\nother people. People that’s badly off among us are called ‘cursed.’\r\nIn bad weather it’s common for costers to ‘curse themselves,’ as they\r\ncall having no trade. ‘Well, I’m cursed,’ they say when they can make\r\nno money. It’s a common thing among them to shout after any one they\r\ndon’t like, that’s reduced, ‘Well, ain’t you cursed?’” The costers, I\r\nam credibly informed, gamble a great deal with the wealthier class of\r\nthieves, and win of them the greater part of the money they get.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MORE PROVIDENT COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nConcerning this head, I give the statement of a man whose information\r\nI found fully confirmed:--“We are not such a degraded set as some\r\nbelieve; sir, but a living doesn’t tumble into a man’s mouth, now a\r\ndays. A good many of us costers rises into greengrocers and coal-sheds,\r\nand still carries on their rounds as costers, all the same. Why, in\r\nLock’s-fields, I could show you twenty such, and you’d find them very\r\ndecent men, sir--very. There’s one man I know, that’s risen that way,\r\nwho is worth hundreds of pounds, and keeps his horse and cart like a\r\ngentleman. They rises to be voters, and they all vote liberal. Some\r\nmarry the better kind of servants,--such servant-maids as would’nt\r\nmarry a rag and bottle shop, but doesn’t object to a coal shed. It’s\r\nmostly younger men that manages this. As far as I have observed, these\r\ncosters, after they has settled and got to be housekeepers, don’t turn\r\ntheir backs on their old mates. They’d have a nice life of it if they\r\ndid--yes! a very nice life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HOMES OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers usually reside in the courts and alleys in the\r\nneighbourhood of the different street-markets. They themselves\r\ndesignate the locality where, so to speak, a colony of their people has\r\nbeen established, a “coster district,” and the entire metropolis is\r\nthus parcelled out, almost as systematically as if for the purposes of\r\nregistration. These costermonger districts are as follows, and are here\r\nplaced in the order of the numerical importance of the residents:\r\n\r\n  The New Cut (Lambeth).\r\n  Whitecross-street.\r\n  Leather-lane.\r\n  The Brill, Somers’ Town.\r\n  Whitechapel.\r\n  Camberwell.\r\n  Walworth.\r\n  Peckham.\r\n  Bermondsey.\r\n  The Broadway, Westminster.\r\n  Shoreditch.\r\n  Paddington and Edgeware Road.\r\n  Tottenham-court Road.\r\n  Drury-lane.\r\n  Old-street Road.\r\n  Clare Market.\r\n  Ratcliffe Highway.\r\n  Lisson-grove.\r\n  Petticoat and Rosemary-lane.\r\n  Marylebone-lane.\r\n  Oxford-street.\r\n  Rotherhithe.\r\n  Deptford.\r\n  Dockhead.\r\n  Greenwich.\r\n  Commercial-road (East).\r\n  Poplar.\r\n  Limehouse.\r\n  Bethnal-green.\r\n  Hackney-road.\r\n  Kingsland.\r\n  Camden Town.\r\n\r\nThe homes of the costermongers in these places, may be divided into\r\nthree classes; firstly, those who, by having a regular trade or by\r\nprudent economy, are enabled to live in comparative ease and plenty;\r\nsecondly, those who, from having a large family or by imprudent\r\nexpenditure, are, as it were, struggling with the world; and thirdly,\r\nthose who for want of stock-money, or ill success in trade are nearly\r\ndestitute.\r\n\r\nThe first home I visited was that of an old woman, who with the\r\nassistance of her son and girls, contrived to live in a most\r\npraiseworthy and comfortable manner. She and all her family were\r\nteetotallers, and may be taken as a fair type of the thriving\r\ncostermonger.\r\n\r\nAs I ascended a dark flight of stairs, a savory smell of stew grew\r\nstronger at each step I mounted. The woman lived in a large airy room\r\non the first floor (“the drawing-room” as she told me laughing at her\r\nown joke), well lighted by a clean window, and I found her laying out\r\nthe savory smelling dinner looking most temptingly clean. The floor\r\nwas as white as if it had been newly planed, the coke fire was bright\r\nand warm, making the lid of the tin saucepan on it rattle up and down\r\nas the steam rushed out. The wall over the fire-place was patched\r\nup to the ceiling with little square pictures of saints, and on the\r\nmantel-piece, between a row of bright tumblers and wine glasses filled\r\nwith odds and ends, stood glazed crockeryware images of Prince Albert\r\nand M. Jullien. Against the walls, which were papered with “hangings”\r\nof four different patterns and colours, were hung several warm shawls,\r\nand in the band-box, which stood on the stained chest of drawers, you\r\ncould tell that the Sunday bonnet was stowed safely away from the\r\ndust. A turn-up bedstead thrown back, and covered with a many-coloured\r\npatch-work quilt, stood opposite to a long dresser with its mugs and\r\ncups dangling from the hooks, and the clean blue plates and dishes\r\nranged in order at the back. There were a few bushel baskets piled up\r\nin one corner, “but the apples smelt so,” she said, “they left them in\r\na stable at night.”\r\n\r\nBy the fire sat the woman’s daughter, a pretty meek-faced gray-eyed\r\ngirl of sixteen, who “was home nursing” for a cold. “Steve” (her boy)\r\nI was informed, was out working. With his help, the woman assured me,\r\nshe could live very comfortably--“God be praised!” and when he got the\r\nbarrow he was promised, she gave me to understand, that their riches\r\nwere to increase past reckoning. Her girl too was to be off at work\r\nas soon as sprats came in. “Its on Lord Mayor’s-day they comes in,”\r\nsaid a neighbour who had rushed up to see the strange gentleman, “they\r\nsays he has ’em on his table, but I never seed ’em. They never gives\r\nus the pieces, no not even the heads,” and every one laughed to their\r\nutmost. The good old dame was in high spirits, her dark eyes sparkling\r\nas she spoke about her “Steve.” The daughter in a little time lost\r\nher bashfulness, and informed me “that one of the Polish refugees was\r\na-courting Mrs. M----, who had given him a pair of black eyes.”\r\n\r\nOn taking my leave I was told by the mother that their silver gilt\r\nDutch clock--with its glass face and blackleaded weights--“was the best\r\none in London, and might be relied on with the greatest safety.”\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the dwellings of the struggling costers, the following\r\nmay be cited:\r\n\r\nThe man, a tall, thick-built, almost good-looking fellow, with a large\r\nfur cap on his head, lived with his family in a front kitchen, and as\r\nthere were, with his mother-in-law, five persons, and only one bed, I\r\nwas somewhat puzzled to know where they could _all_ sleep. The barrow\r\nstanding on the railings over the window, half shut out the light,\r\nand when any one passed there was a momentary shadow thrown over the\r\nroom, and a loud rattling of the iron gratings above that completely\r\nprevented all conversation. When I entered, the mother-in-law was\r\nreading aloud one of the threepenny papers to her son, who lolled on\r\nthe bed, that with its curtains nearly filled the room. There was the\r\nusual attempt to make the fireside comfortable. The stone sides had\r\nbeen well whitened, and the mantel-piece decorated with its small tin\r\ntrays, tumblers, and a piece of looking-glass. A cat with a kitten\r\nwere seated on the hearth-rug in front. “They keeps the varmint away,”\r\nsaid the woman, stroking the “puss,” “and gives a look of home.” By\r\nthe drawers were piled up four bushel baskets, and in a dark corner\r\nnear the bed stood a tall measure full of apples that scented the room.\r\nOver the head, on a string that stretched from wall to wall, dangled\r\na couple of newly-washed shirts, and by the window were two stone\r\nbarrels, for lemonade, when the coster visited the fairs and races.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were talking, the man’s little girl came home. For a poor\r\nman’s child she was dressed to perfection; her pinafore was clean, her\r\nface shone with soap, and her tidy cotton print gown had clearly been\r\nnewly put on that morning. She brought news that “Janey” was coming\r\nhome from auntey’s, and instantly a pink cotton dress was placed by the\r\nmother-in-law before the fire to air. (It appeared that Janey was out\r\nat service, and came home once a week to see her parents and take back\r\na clean frock.) Although these people were living, so to speak, in a\r\ncellar, still every endeavour had been made to give the home a look of\r\ncomfort. The window, with its paper-patched panes, had a clean calico\r\nblind. The side-table was dressed up with yellow jugs and cups and\r\nsaucers, and the band-boxes had been stowed away on the flat top of the\r\nbedstead. All the chairs, which were old fashioned mahogany ones, had\r\nsound backs and bottoms.\r\n\r\nOf the third class, or the very poor, I chose the following “type” out\r\nof the many others that presented themselves. The family here lived in\r\na small slanting-roofed house, partly stripped of its tiles. More than\r\none half of the small leaden squares of the first-floor window were\r\ncovered with brown paper, puffing out and crackling in the wind, while\r\nthrough the greater part of the others were thrust out ball-shaped\r\nbundles of rags, to keep out the breeze. The panes that did remain were\r\nof all shapes and sizes, and at a distance had the appearance of yellow\r\nglass, they were so stained with dirt. I opened a door with a number\r\nchalked on it, and groped my way up a broken tottering staircase.\r\n\r\nIt took me some time after I had entered the apartment before I could\r\nget accustomed to the smoke, that came pouring into the room from the\r\nchimney. The place was filled with it, curling in the light, and making\r\nevery thing so indistinct that I could with difficulty see the white\r\nmugs ranged in the corner-cupboard, not three yards from me. When the\r\nwind was in the north, or when it rained, it was always that way, I was\r\ntold, “but otherwise,” said an old dame about sixty, with long grisly\r\nhair spreading over her black shawl, “it is pretty good for that.”\r\n\r\nOn a mattrass, on the floor, lay a pale-faced girl--“eighteen years old\r\nlast twelfth-cake day”--her drawn-up form showing in the patch-work\r\ncounterpane that covered her. She had just been confined, and the child\r\nhad died! A little straw, stuffed into an old tick, was all she had to\r\nlie upon, and even that had been given up to her by the mother until\r\nshe was well enough to work again. To shield her from the light of the\r\nwindow, a cloak had been fastened up slantingly across the panes; and\r\non a string that ran along the wall was tied, amongst the bonnets, a\r\nclean nightcap--“against the doctor came,” as the mother, curtsying,\r\ninformed me. By the side of the bed, almost hidden in the dark shade,\r\nwas a pile of sieve baskets, crowned by the flat shallow that the\r\nmother “worked” with.\r\n\r\nThe room was about nine feet square, and furnished a home for three\r\nwomen. The ceiling slanted like that of a garret, and was the colour of\r\nold leather, excepting a few rough white patches, where the tenants had\r\nrudely mended it. The white light was easily seen through the laths,\r\nand in one corner a large patch of the paper looped down from the wall.\r\nOne night the family had been startled from their sleep by a large mass\r\nof mortar--just where the roof bulged in--falling into the room. “We\r\nnever want rain water,” the woman told me, “for we can catch plenty\r\njust over the chimney-place.”\r\n\r\nThey had made a carpet out of three or four old mats. They were\r\n“obligated to it, for fear of dropping anything through the boards into\r\nthe donkey stables in the parlour underneath. But we only pay ninepence\r\na week rent,” said the old woman, “and mustn’t grumble.”\r\n\r\nThe only ornament in the place was on the mantel-piece--an old\r\nearthenware sugar-basin, well silvered over, that had been given by the\r\neldest girl when she died, as a remembrance to her mother. Two cracked\r\ntea-cups, on their inverted saucers, stood on each side, and dressed up\r\nthe fire-side into something like tidiness. The chair I sat on was by\r\nfar the best out of the three in the room, and that had no back, and\r\nonly half its quantity of straw.\r\n\r\nThe parish, the old woman told me, allowed her 1_s._ a week and two\r\nloaves. But the doctor ordered her girl to take sago and milk, and she\r\nwas many a time sorely puzzled to get it. The neighbours helped her a\r\ngood deal, and often sent her part of their unsold greens;--even if it\r\nwas only the outer leaves of the cabbages, she was thankful for them.\r\nHer other girl--a big-boned wench, with a red shawl crossed over her\r\nbosom, and her black hair parted on one side--did all she could, and\r\nso they lived on. “As long as they kept out of the ‘big house’ (the\r\nworkhouse) she would not complain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OYSTER STALL.\r\n\r\n“Penny a lot, Oysters! Penny a lot!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nI never yet beheld so much destitution borne with so much content.\r\nVerily the acted philosophy of the poor is a thing to make those who\r\nwrite and preach about it hide their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DRESS OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nFrom the homes of the costermongers we pass to a consideration of their\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger’s ordinary costume partakes of the durability of\r\nthe warehouseman’s, with the quaintness of that of the stable-boy. A\r\nwell-to-do “coster,” when dressed for the day’s work, usually wears a\r\nsmall cloth cap, a little on one side. A close-fitting worsted tie-up\r\nskull-cap, is very fashionable, just now, among the class, and ringlets\r\nat the temples are looked up to as the height of elegance. Hats they\r\nnever wear--excepting on Sunday--on account of their baskets being\r\nfrequently carried on their heads. Coats are seldom indulged in; their\r\nwaistcoats, which are of a broad-ribbed corduroy, with fustian back\r\nand sleeves, being made as long as a groom’s, and buttoned up nearly\r\nto the throat. If the corduroy be of a light sandy colour, then plain\r\nbrass, or sporting buttons, with raised fox’s or stag’s heads upon\r\nthem--or else black bone-buttons, with a flower-pattern--ornament the\r\nfront; but if the cord be of a dark rat-skin hue, then mother-of-pearl\r\nbuttons are preferred. Two large pockets--sometimes four--with huge\r\nflaps or lappels, like those in a shooting-coat, are commonly worn. If\r\nthe costermonger be driving a good trade and have his set of regular\r\ncustomers, he will sport a blue cloth jacket, similar in cut to the\r\ncord ones above described; but this is looked upon as an extravagance\r\nof the highest order, for the slime and scales of the fish stick to the\r\nsleeves and shoulders of the garment, so as to spoil the appearance of\r\nit in a short time. The fashionable stuff for trousers, at the present,\r\nis a dark-coloured “cable cord,” and they are made to fit tightly at\r\nthe knee and swell gradually until they reach the boot, which they\r\nnearly cover. Velveteen is now seldom worn, and knee-breeches are quite\r\nout of date. Those who deal wholly in fish wear a blue serge apron,\r\neither hanging down or tucked up round their waist. The costermonger,\r\nhowever, prides himself most of all upon his neckerchief and boots.\r\nMen, women, boys and girls, all have a passion for these articles. The\r\nman who does not wear his silk neckerchief--his “King’s-man” as it is\r\ncalled--is known to be in desperate circumstances; the inference being\r\nthat it has gone to supply the morning’s stock-money. A yellow flower\r\non a green ground, or a red and blue pattern, is at present greatly\r\nin vogue. The women wear their kerchiefs tucked-in under their gowns,\r\nand the men have theirs wrapped loosely round the neck, with the ends\r\nhanging over their waistcoats. Even if a costermonger has two or three\r\nsilk handkerchiefs by him already, he seldom hesitates to buy another,\r\nwhen tempted with a bright showy pattern hanging from a Field-lane\r\ndoor-post.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger’s love of a good strong boot is a singular prejudice\r\nthat runs throughout the whole class. From the father to the youngest\r\nchild, all will be found well shod. So strong is their predilection in\r\nthis respect, that a costermonger may be immediately known by a glance\r\nat his feet. He will part with everything rather than his boots, and to\r\nwear a pair of second-hand ones, or “translators” (as they are called),\r\nis felt as a bitter degradation by them all. Among the men, this pride\r\nhas risen to such a pitch, that many will have their upper-leathers\r\ntastily ornamented, and it is not uncommon to see the younger men of\r\nthis class with a heart or a thistle, surrounded by a wreath of roses,\r\nworked below the instep, on their boots. The general costume of the\r\nwomen or girls is a black velveteen or straw bonnet, with a few ribbons\r\nor flowers, and almost always a net cap fitting closely to the cheek.\r\nThe silk “King’s-man” covering their shoulders, is sometimes tucked\r\ninto the neck of the printed cotton-gown, and sometimes the ends are\r\nbrought down outside to the apron-strings. Silk dresses are never worn\r\nby them--they rather despise such articles. The petticoats are worn\r\nshort, ending at the ankles, just high enough to show the whole of the\r\nmuch-admired boots. Coloured, or “illustrated shirts,” as they are\r\ncalled, are especially objected to by the men.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday no costermonger will, if he can possibly avoid it,\r\nwheel a barrow. If a shilling be an especial object to him, he may,\r\nperhaps, take his shallow and head-basket as far as Chalk-farm, or\r\nsome neighbouring resort; but even then he objects strongly to the\r\nSunday-trading. They leave this to the Jews and Irish, who are always\r\nwilling to earn a penny--as they say.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous coster _will_ have his holiday on the Sunday, and, if\r\npossible, his Sunday suit as well--which usually consists of a rough\r\nbeaver hat, brown Petersham, with velvet facings of the same colour,\r\nand cloth trousers, with stripes down the side. The women, generally,\r\nmanage to keep by them a cotton gown of a bright showy pattern, and a\r\nnew shawl. As one of the craft said to me--“Costers likes to see their\r\ngals and wives look lady-like when they takes them out.” Such of the\r\ncosters as are not in a flourishing way of business, seldom make any\r\nalteration in their dress on the Sunday.\r\n\r\nThere are but five tailors in London who make the garb proper to\r\ncostermongers; one of these is considered somewhat “slop,” or as a\r\ncoster called him, a “springer-up.”\r\n\r\nThis springer-up is blamed by some of the costermongers, who\r\ncondemn him for employing women at reduced wages. A whole court of\r\ncostermongers, I was assured, would withdraw their custom from a\r\ntradesman, if one of their body, who had influence among them, showed\r\nthat the tradesman was unjust to his workpeople. The tailor in question\r\nissues bills after the following fashion. I give one verbatim, merely\r\nwithholding the address for obvious reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n“ONCE TRY YOU’LL COME AGAIN.\r\n\r\n_Slap-up Tog and out-and-out Kicksies Builder._\r\n\r\nMr. ---- nabs the chance of putting his customers awake, that he has\r\njust made his escape from Russia, not forgetting to clap his mawleys\r\nupon some of the right sort of Ducks, to make single and double backed\r\nSlops for gentlemen in black, when on his return home he was stunned\r\nto find one of the top manufacturers of Manchester had cut his lucky\r\nand stepped off to the Swan Stream, leaving behind him a valuable stock\r\nof Moleskins, Cords, Velveteens, Plushes, Swandowns, &c., and I having\r\nsome ready in my kick, grabbed the chance, and stepped home with my\r\nswag, and am now safe landed at my crib.

Gentlemen finding their own Broady can be accommodated.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DIET AND DRINK OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nIt is less easy to describe the diet of costermongers than it is to\r\ndescribe that of many other of the labouring classes, for their diet,\r\nso to speak, is an “out-door diet.” They breakfast at a coffee-stall,\r\nand (if all their means have been expended in purchasing their stock,\r\nand none of it be yet sold) they expend on the meal only 1_d._,\r\nreserved for the purpose. For this sum they can procure a small cup of\r\ncoffee, and two “thin” (that is to say two thin slices of bread and\r\nbutter). For dinner--which on a week-day is hardly ever eaten at the\r\ncostermonger’s abode--they buy “block ornaments,” as they call the\r\nsmall, dark-coloured pieces of meat exposed on the cheap butchers’\r\nblocks or counters. These they cook in a tap-room; half a pound\r\ncosting 2_d._ If time be an object, the coster buys a hot pie or two;\r\npreferring fruit-pies when in season, and next to them meat-pies. “We\r\nnever eat eel-pies,” said one man to me, “because we know they’re often\r\nmade of large dead eels. _We_, of all people, are not to be had that\r\nway. But the haristocrats eats ’em and never knows the difference.” I\r\ndid not hear that these men had any repugnance to meat-pies; but the\r\nuse of the dead eel happens to come within the immediate knowledge of\r\nthe costermongers, who are, indeed, its purveyors. Saveloys, with a\r\npint of beer, or a glass of “short” (neat gin) is with them another\r\ncommon week-day dinner. The costers make all possible purchases of\r\nstreet-dealers, and pride themselves in thus “sticking to their own.”\r\nOn Sunday, the costermonger, when not “cracked up,” enjoys a good\r\ndinner at his own abode. This is always a joint--most frequently a\r\nshoulder or half-shoulder of mutton--and invariably with “lots of good\r\ntaturs baked along with it.” In the quality of their potatoes these\r\npeople are generally particular.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger’s usual beverage is beer, and many of them drink hard,\r\nhaving no other way of spending their leisure but in drinking and\r\ngambling. It is not unusual in “a good time,” for a costermonger to\r\nspend 12_s._ out of every 20_s._ in beer and pleasure.\r\n\r\nI ought to add, that the “single fellows,” instead of living on “block\r\nornaments” and the like, live, when doing well, on the best fare, at\r\nthe “spiciest” cook-shops on their rounds, or in the neighbourhood of\r\ntheir residence.\r\n\r\nThere are some families of costermongers who have persevered in\r\ncarrying out the principles of teetotalism. One man thought there might\r\nbe 200 individuals, including men, women, and children, who practised\r\ntotal abstinence from intoxicating drinks. These parties are nearly\r\nall somewhat better off than their drinking companions. The number of\r\nteetotallers amongst the costers, however, was more numerous three or\r\nfour years back.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CRIES, ROUNDS, AND DAYS OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to treat of the London costermongers’ mode of doing\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn the first place all the goods they sell are cried or “hawked,” and\r\nthe cries of the costermongers in the present day are as varied as the\r\narticles they sell. The principal ones, uttered in a sort of cadence,\r\nare now, “Ni-ew mackerel, 6 a shilling.” (“I’ve got a good jacketing\r\nmany a Sunday morning,” said one dealer, “for waking people up with\r\ncrying mackerel, but I’ve said, ‘I must live while you sleep.’”) “Buy a\r\npair of live soles, 3 pair for 6_d._”--or, with a barrow, “Soles, 1_d._\r\na pair, 1_d._ a pair;” “Plaice alive, alive, cheap;” “Buy a pound crab,\r\ncheap;” “Pine-apples, 1/2_d._ a slice;” “Mussels a penny a quart;”\r\n“Oysters, a penny a lot;” “Salmon alive, 6_d._ a pound;” “Cod alive,\r\n2_d._ a pound;” “Real Yarmouth bloaters, 2 a penny;” “New herrings\r\nalive, 16 a groat” (this is the loudest cry of any); “Penny a bunch\r\nturnips” (the same with greens, cabbages, &c.); “All new nuts, 1_d._\r\nhalf-pint;” “Oranges, 2 a penny;” “All large and alive-O, new sprats,\r\nO, 1_d._ a plate;” “Wi-ild Hampshire rabbits, 2 a shilling;” “Cherry\r\nripe, 2_d._ a pound;” “Fine ripe plums, 1_d._ a pint;” “Ing-uns, a\r\npenny a quart;” “Eels, 3lbs. a shilling--large live eels 3lbs. a\r\nshilling.”\r\n\r\nThe continual calling in the streets is very distressing to the voice.\r\nOne man told me that it had broken his, and that very often while out\r\nhe lost his voice altogether. “They seem to have no breath,” the men\r\nsay, “after calling for a little while.” The repeated shouting brings\r\non a hoarseness, which is one of the peculiar characteristics of\r\nhawkers in general. The costers mostly go out with a boy to cry their\r\ngoods for them. If they have two or three hallooing together, it makes\r\nmore noise than one, and the boys can shout better and louder than\r\nthe men. The more noise they can make in a place the better they find\r\ntheir trade. Street-selling has been so bad lately that many have been\r\nobliged to have a drum for their bloaters, “to drum the fish off,” as\r\nthey call it.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the costermongers, as I said before, have mostly\r\ntheir little bit of a “round;” that is, they go only to certain places;\r\nand if they don’t sell their goods they “work back” the same way again.\r\nIf they visit a respectable quarter, they confine themselves to the\r\nmews near the gentlemen’s houses. They generally prefer the poorer\r\nneighbourhoods. They go down or through almost all the courts and\r\nalleys--and avoid the better kind of streets, unless with lobsters,\r\nrabbits, or onions. If they have anything inferior, they visit the low\r\nIrish districts--for the Irish people, they say, want only quantity,\r\nand care nothing about quality--_that_ they don’t study. But if they\r\nhave anything they wish to make a price of, they seek out the mews, and\r\ntry to get it off among the gentlemen’s coachmen, for _they_ will have\r\nwhat is good; or else they go among the residences of mechanics,--for\r\ntheir wives, they say, like good-living as well as the coachmen. Some\r\ncosters, on the other hand, go chance rounds.\r\n\r\nConcerning the busiest days of the week for the coster’s trade, they\r\nsay Wednesdays and Fridays are the best, because they are regular fish\r\ndays. These two days are considered to be those on which the poorer\r\nclasses generally run short of money. Wednesday night is called “draw\r\nnight” among some mechanics and labourers--that is, they then get a\r\nportion of their wages in advance, and on Friday they run short as well\r\nas on the Wednesday, and have to make shift for their dinners. With\r\nthe few halfpence they have left, they are glad to pick up anything\r\ncheap, and the street-fishmonger never refuses an offer. Besides, he\r\ncan supply them with a cheaper dinner than any other person. In the\r\nseason the poor generally dine upon herrings. The poorer classes live\r\nmostly on fish, and the “dropped” and “rough” fish is bought chiefly\r\nfor the poor. The fish-huckster has no respect for persons, however;\r\none assured me that if Prince Halbert was to stop him in the street to\r\nbuy a pair of soles of him, he’d as soon sell him a “rough pair as any\r\nother man--indeed, I’d take in my own father,” he added, “if he wanted\r\nto deal with me.” Saturday is the worst day of all for fish, for then\r\nthe poor people have scarcely anything at all to spend; Saturday night,\r\nhowever, the street-seller takes more money than at any other time in\r\nthe week.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS ON THEIR COUNTRY ROUNDS.\r\n\r\nSome costermongers go what they term “country rounds,” and they speak\r\nof their country expeditions as if they were summer excursions of mere\r\npleasure. They are generally variations from a life growing monotonous.\r\nIt was computed for me that at present three out of every twenty\r\ncostermongers “take a turn in the country” at least once a year. Before\r\nthe prevalence of railways twice as many of these men carried their\r\nspeculations in fish, fruit, or vegetables to a country mart. Some did\r\nso well that they never returned to London. Two for instance, after a\r\ncountry round, settled at Salisbury; they are now regular shopkeepers,\r\n“and very respectable, too,” was said to me, “for I believe they are\r\nboth pretty tidy off for money; and are growing rich.” The railway\r\ncommunication supplies the local-dealer with fish, vegetables, or any\r\nperishable article, with such rapidity and cheapness that the London\r\nitinerant’s occupation in the towns and villages about the metropolis\r\nis now half gone.\r\n\r\nIn the following statement by a costermonger, the mode of life on\r\na country round, is detailed with something of an assumption of\r\nmetropolitan superiority.\r\n\r\n“It was fine times, sir, ten year back, aye, and five year back, in\r\nthe country, and it ain’t so bad now, if a man’s known. It depends on\r\nthat now far more than it did, and on a man’s knowing how to work a\r\nvillage. Why, I can tell you if it wasn’t for such as me, there’s many\r\na man working on a farm would never taste such a nice thing as a fresh\r\nherring--never, sir. It’s a feast at a poor country labourer’s place,\r\nwhen he springs six-penn’orth of fresh herrings, some for supper, and\r\nsome in salt for next day. I’ve taken a shillings’-worth to a farmer’s\r\ndoor of a darkish night in a cold autumn, and they’d a warm and good\r\ndish for supper, and looked on me as a sort of friend. We carry them\r\nrelishes from London; and they like London relishes, for we know how\r\nto set them off. I’ve fresh herringed a whole village near Guildford,\r\nfirst thing in the morning. I’ve drummed round Guildford too, and done\r\nwell. I’ve waked up Kingston with herrings. I’ve been as welcome as\r\nanything to the soldiers in the barracks at Brentwood, and Romford,\r\nand Maidstone with my fresh herrings; for they’re good customers. In\r\ntwo days I’ve made 2_l._ out of 10_s._ worth of fresh herrings, bought\r\nat Billingsgate. I always lodge at a public-house in the country; so\r\ndo all of us, for the publicans are customers. We are well received at\r\nthe public-houses; some of us go there for the handiness of the ‘lush.’\r\nI’ve done pretty well with red herrings in the country. A barrel holds\r\n(say) 800. We sell the barrels at 6_d._ a piece, and the old women\r\nfight after them. They pitch and tar them, to make water-barrels. More\r\nof us would settle in the country, only there’s no life there.”\r\n\r\nThe most frequented round is from Lambeth to Wandsworth, Kingston,\r\nRichmond, Guildford, and Farnham. The costermonger is then “sold out,”\r\nas he calls it,--he has disposed of his stock, and returns by the way\r\nwhich is most lightly tolled, no matter if the saving of 1_d._ or 2_d._\r\nentail some miles extra travelling. “It cost me 15_d._ for tolls from\r\nGuildford for an empty cart and donkey,” said a costermonger just up\r\nfrom the country.\r\n\r\nAnother round is to Croydon, Reigate, and the neighbourhoods; another\r\nto Edgeware, Kilburn, Watford, and Barnet; another to Maidstone; but\r\nthe costermonger, if he starts trading at a distance, as he now does\r\nfrequently, has his barrow and goods sent down by railway to such towns\r\nas Maidstone, so he saves the delay and cost of a donkey-cart. A “mate”\r\nsees to the transmission of the goods from London, the owner walking\r\nto Maidstone to be in readiness to “work” them immediately he receives\r\nthem. “The railway’s an ease and a saving,” I was told; “I’ve got a\r\nstock sent for 2_s._, and a donkey’s keep would cost that for the time\r\nit would be in travelling. There’s 5,000 of us, I think, might get a\r\nliving in the country, if we stuck to it entirely.”\r\n\r\nIf the country enterprise be a failure, the men sometimes abandon it in\r\n“a pet,” sell their goods at any loss, and walk home, generally getting\r\ndrunk as the first step to their return. Some have been known to pawn\r\ntheir barrow on the road for drink. This they call “doing queer.”\r\n\r\nIn summer the costermongers carry plums, peas, new potatoes, cucumbers,\r\nand quantities of pickling vegetables, especially green walnuts, to\r\nthe country. In winter their commodities are onions, fresh and red\r\nherrings, and sprats. “I don’t know how it is,” said one man to me,\r\n“but we sell ing-uns and all sorts of fruits and vegetables, cheaper\r\nthan they can buy them where they’re grown; and green walnuts, too,\r\nwhen you’d think they had only to be knocked off a tree.”\r\n\r\nAnother costermonger told me that, in the country, he and his\r\nmates attended every dance or other amusement, “if it wasn’t too\r\nrespectable.” Another said: “If I’m idle in the country on a Sunday, I\r\nnever go to church. I never was in a church; I don’t know why, for my\r\nsilk handkerchief’s worth more than one of their smock-frocks, and is\r\nquite as respectable.”\r\n\r\nSome costermongers confine their exertions to the fairs and races, and\r\nmany of them are connected with the gipsies, who are said to be the\r\nusual receivers of the stolen handkerchiefs at such places.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EARNINGS OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of the costermonger--the next subject of inquiry that,\r\nin due order, presents itself--vary as much as in more fashionable\r\ncallings, for he is greatly dependent on the season, though he may be\r\nlittle affected by London being full or empty.\r\n\r\nConcurrent testimony supplied me with the following estimate of their\r\nearnings. I cite the average earnings (apart from any charges or\r\ndrawbacks), of the most staple commodities:\r\n\r\nIn January and February the costers generally sell fish. In these\r\nmonths the wealthier of the street fishmongers, or those who can always\r\ncommand “money to go to market,” enjoy a kind of monopoly. The wintry\r\nseason renders the supply of fish dearer and less regular, so that the\r\npoorer dealers cannot buy “at first hand,” and sometimes cannot be\r\nsupplied at all; while the others monopolise the fish, more or less,\r\nand will not sell it to any of the other street-dealers until a profit\r\nhas been realised out of their own regular customers, and the demand\r\npartially satisfied. “Why, I’ve known one man sell 10_l._ worth of\r\nfish--most of it mackarel--at his stall in Whitecross-street,” said\r\na costermonger to me, “and all in one snowy day, in last January. It\r\nwas very stormy at that time, and fish came in unregular, and he got\r\na haul. I’ve known him sell 2_l._ worth in an hour, and once 2_l._\r\n10_s._ worth, for I then helped at his stall. If people has dinner\r\nparties they must have fish, and gentlemen’s servants came to buy.” The\r\n_average_ earnings however of those that “go rounds” in these months\r\nare computed not to exceed 8_s._ a week; Monday and Saturday being days\r\nof little trade in fish.\r\n\r\n“March is dreadful,” said an itinerant fish seller to me; “we don’t\r\naverage, I’m satisfied, more nor 4_s._ a week. I’ve had my barrow idle\r\nfor a week sometimes--at home every day, though it had to be paid for,\r\nall the same. At the latter end of March, if it’s fine, it’s 1_s._ a\r\nweek better, because there’s flower roots in--‘all a-growing,’ you\r\nknow, sir. And that lasts until April, and we then make above 6_s._\r\na week. I’ve heard people say when I’ve cried ‘all a-growing’ on a\r\nfine-ish day, ‘Aye, now summer’s a-coming.’ I wish you may get it, says\r\nI to myself; for I’ve studied the seasons.”\r\n\r\nIn May the costermonger’s profit is greater. He vends fresh fish--of\r\nwhich there is a greater supply and a greater demand, and the fine and\r\noften not very hot weather insures its freshness--and he sells dried\r\nherrings and “roots” (as they are called) such as wall-flowers and\r\nstocks. The average earnings then are from 10_s._ to 12_s._ a week.\r\n\r\nIn June, new potatoes, peas, and beans tempt the costermongers’\r\ncustomers, and then his earnings rise to 1_l._ a week. In addition to\r\nthis 1_l._, if the season allow, a costermonger at the end of the week,\r\nI was told by an experienced hand, “will earn an extra 10_s._ if he has\r\nanything of a round.” “Why, I’ve cleared thirty shillings myself,” he\r\nadded, “on a Saturday night.”\r\n\r\nIn July cherries are the principal article of traffic, and then the\r\nprofit varies from 4_s._ to 8_s._ a day, weather permitting, or 30_s._\r\na week on a low average. On my inquiry if they did not sell fish in\r\nthat month, the answer was, “No, sir; we pitch fish to the ----; we\r\nstick to cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and ripe currants and\r\ngooseberries. Potatoes is getting good and cheap then, and so is peas.\r\nMany a round’s worth a crown every day of the week.”\r\n\r\nIn August, the chief trading is in Orleans plums, green-gages, apples\r\nand pears, and in this month the earnings are from 5_s._ to 6_s._ a\r\nday. [I may here remark that the costermongers care little to deal in\r\neither vegetables or fish, “when the fruit’s in,” but they usually\r\ncarry a certain supply of vegetables all the year round, for those\r\ncustomers who require them.]\r\n\r\nIn September apples are vended, and about 2_s._ 6_d._ a day made.\r\n\r\nIn October “the weather gets cold,” I was told, “and the apples gets\r\nfewer, and the day’s work’s over at four; we then deals most in fish,\r\nsuch as soles; there’s a good bit done in oysters, and we may make\r\n1_s._ or 1_s._ 6_d._ a day, but it’s uncertain.”\r\n\r\nIn November fish and vegetables are the chief commodities, and then\r\nfrom 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ a day is made; but in the latter part of the\r\nmonth an extra 6_d._ or 1_s._ a day may be cleared, as sprats come in\r\nand sell well when newly introduced.\r\n\r\nIn December the trade is still principally in fish, and 12_d._ or\r\n18_d._ a day is the costermonger’s earnings. Towards the close of the\r\nmonth he makes rather more, as he deals in new oranges and lemons,\r\nholly, ivy, &c., and in Christmas week he makes 3_s._ or 4_s._ a day.\r\n\r\nThese calculations give an average of about 14_s._ 6_d._ a week, when a\r\nman pursues his trade regularly. One man calculated it for me at 15_s._\r\naverage the year through--that is supposing, of course, that the larger\r\nearnings of the summer are carefully put by to eke out the winter’s\r\nincome. This, I need hardly say, is never done. Prudence is a virtue,\r\nwhich is comparatively unknown to the London costermongers. They have\r\nno knowledge of savings’-banks; and to expect that they themselves\r\nshould keep their money by them untouched for months (even if they had\r\nthe means of so doing) is simply to expect impossibilities--to look for\r\nthe continued withstanding of temptation among a class who are unused\r\nto the least moral or prudential restraint.\r\n\r\n_Some_ costers, I am told, make upwards of 30_s._ a week all the year\r\nround; but allowing for cessations in the street-trade, through bad\r\nweather, neglect, ill-health, or casualty of any kind, and taking the\r\nmore prosperous costers with the less successful--the English with the\r\nIrish--the men with the women--perhaps 10_s._ a week may be a fair\r\naverage of the earnings of the entire body the year through.\r\n\r\nThese earnings, I am assured, were five years ago at least 25 per cent.\r\nhigher; some said they made half as much again: “I can’t make it out\r\nhow it is,” said one man, “but I remember that I could go out and sell\r\ntwelve bushel of fruit in a day, when sugar was dear, and now, when\r\nsugar’s cheap, I can’t sell three bushel on the same round. Perhaps we\r\nwant thinning.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of the working-classes; say all the costers, they\r\nhave little or no money to spend. “Why, I can assure you,” declared\r\none of the parties from whom I obtained much important information,\r\n“there’s my missis--she sits at the corner of the street with fruit.\r\nEight years ago she would have taken 8_s._ out of that street on a\r\nSaturday, and last Saturday week she had one bushel of apples, which\r\ncost 1_s._ 6_d._ She was out from ten in the morning till ten at night,\r\nand all she took that day was 1_s._ 7-1/2_d._ Go to whoever you will,\r\nyou will hear much upon the same thing.” Another told me, “The costers\r\nare often obliged to sell the things for what they gave for them. The\r\npeople haven’t got money to lay out with them--they tell us so; and\r\nif they are poor we must be poor too. If we can’t get a profit upon\r\nwhat goods we buy with our stock-money, let it be our own or anybody’s\r\nelse, we are compelled to live upon it, and when that’s broken into, we\r\nmust either go to the workhouse or starve. If we go to the workhouse,\r\nthey’ll give us a piece of dry bread, and abuse us worse than dogs.”\r\nIndeed, the whole course of my narratives shows how the costers\r\ngenerally--though far from universally--complain of the depressed\r\nstate of their trade. The following statement was given to me by a man\r\nwho, for twelve years, had been a stall-keeper in a street-market. It\r\nshows to what causes he (and I found others express similar opinions)\r\nattributes the depression:--\r\n\r\n“I never knew things so bad as at present--never! I had six prime\r\ncod-fish, weighing 15lbs. to 20lbs. each, yesterday and the day\r\nbefore, and had to take two home with me last night, and lost money\r\non the others--besides all my time, and trouble, and expense. I had\r\n100 herrings, too, that cost 3_s._--prime quality, and I only sold ten\r\nout of them in a whole day. I had two pads of soles, sir, and lost\r\n4_s._--that is one pad--by them. I took only 4_s._ the first day I laid\r\nin this stock, and only 2_s._ 6_d._ the next; I then had to sell for\r\nanything I could get, and throw some away. Yet, people say mine’s a\r\nlazy, easy life. I think the fall off is owing to meat being so cheap,\r\n’cause people buy that rather than my goods, as they think there’s more\r\nstay in it. I’m afeard things will get worse too.” (He then added by\r\nway of _sequitur_, though it is difficult to follow the reasoning,) “If\r\nthis here is free-trade, then to h-- with it, I say!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI shall now pass, from the consideration of the individual earnings, to\r\nthe income and capital of the entire body. Great pains have been taken\r\nto ensure exactitude on these points, and the following calculations\r\nare certainly below the mark. In order to be within due bounds, I\r\nwill take the costermongers, exclusive of their wives and families,\r\nat 10,000, whereas it would appear that their numbers are upwards of\r\n11,000.\r\n\r\n  1,000 carts, at 3_l._ 3_s._ each                 £3,150\r\n    [Donkeys, and occasionally ponies, are\r\n      harnessed to barrows.]\r\n  5,000 barrows, at 2_l._ each                     10,000\r\n  1,500 donkeys, at 1_l._ 5_s._ each                1,875\r\n    [One intelligent man thought there were\r\n      2,000 donkeys, but I account that in\r\n      excess.]\r\n  200 ponies, at 5_l._ each                         1,000\r\n    [Some of these ponies, among the very\r\n      first-class men, are worth 20_l._: one\r\n      was sold by a coster for 30_l._]\r\n  1,700 sets of harness, at 5_s._ each                425\r\n    [All calculated as worn and second-hand.]\r\n  4,000 baskets (or shallows), at 1_s._ each          200\r\n  3,500 stalls or standings, at 5_s._ each            875\r\n    [The stall and barrow men have generally\r\n      baskets to be used when required.]\r\n  10,000 weights, scales, and measures,\r\n      at 2_s._ 6_d._ each                           1,250\r\n    [It is difficult to estimate this item with\r\n      exactitude. Many averaged the value\r\n      at 3_s._ 4_d._]\r\n  Stock-money for 10,000 costers, at\r\n      10_s._ each                                   5,000\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                   Total capital                  £23,775\r\n                                                  -------\r\n\r\nVery nearly 24,000_l._, then, at the most moderate computation,\r\nrepresents the value of the animals, vehicles, and stock, belonging to\r\nthe costermongers in the streets of London.\r\n\r\nThe keep of the donkeys is not here mixed up with their value, and I\r\nhave elsewhere spoken of it.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of my narrative shows that the bulk of the property\r\nin the street goods, and in the appliances for their sale, is in the\r\nhands of usurers as well as of the costers. The following account shows\r\nthe sum paid yearly by the London costermongers for the hire, rent, or\r\ninterest (I have heard each word applied) of their barrows, weights,\r\nbaskets, and stock:\r\n\r\n  Hire of 3,000 barrows, at 1_s._ 3_d._ a week          £9,750\r\n  Hire of 600 weights, scales, &c., at\r\n      1_s._ 6_d._ a week for 2, and 6_d._ a week\r\n      for 10 months                                      1,020\r\n  Hire of 100 baskets, &c., at 6_d._ a week                130\r\n  Interest on 2,500_l._ stock-money, at\r\n      125_l._ per week                                   6,500\r\n    [Calculating at 1_s._ interest weekly for 20_s._]\r\n                                                       -------\r\n          Total paid for hire and interest             £17,400\r\n                                                       -------\r\n\r\nConcerning the income of the entire body of costermongers in the\r\nmetropolis, I estimate the earnings of the 10,000 costermongers, taking\r\nthe average of the year, at 10_s._ weekly. My own observation, the\r\nresult of my inquiries, confirmed by the opinion of some of the most\r\nintelligent of the costermongers, induce me to adopt this amount.\r\nIt must be remembered, that if some costermongers do make 30_s._ a\r\nweek through the year, others will not earn a fourth of it, and hence\r\nmany of the complaints and sufferings of the class. Then there is the\r\ndrawback in the sum paid for “hire,” “interest,” &c., by numbers of\r\nthese people; so that it appears to me, that if we assume the income\r\nof the entire body--including Irish and English--to be 15_s._ a week\r\nper head in the summer, and 5_s._ a week each in the winter, as the\r\ntwo extremes, or a mean of 10_s._ a week all the year through, we\r\nshall not be far out either way. The aggregate earnings of the London\r\ncostermongers, at this rate, are 5,000_l._ per week, or 260,000_l._\r\nyearly. Reckoning that 30,000 individuals have to be supported out of\r\nthis sum, it gives an average of 3_s._ 4_d._ a week per head.\r\n\r\nBut it is important to ascertain not only the earnings or aggregate\r\namount of profit made by the London costermongers in the course\r\nof the year, but likewise their receipts, or aggregate amount of\r\n“takings,” and thus to arrive at the gross sum of money annually laid\r\nout by the poorer classes of the metropolis in the matter of fish,\r\nfruit, and vegetables alone. Assuming that the average profits of\r\nthe costermongers are at the rate of 25 per cent. (and this, I am\r\nsatisfied, is a high estimate--for we should remember, that though\r\ncent. per cent. may be frequently obtained, still their “goods,”\r\nbeing of a “perishable” nature, are as frequently lost or sold off at\r\na “tremendous sacrifice”); assuming then, I say, that the _average_\r\nprofits of the entire 10,000 individuals are 25 per cent. on the\r\ncost-price of their stock, and that the aggregate amount of their\r\nprofits or earnings is upwards of 260,000_l._, it follows that the\r\ngross sum of money laid out with the London costers in the course of\r\nthe twelvemonth is 1,040,000_l._ sterling--a sum so enormous as almost\r\nto make us believe that the tales of individual want are matters of\r\npure fiction. Large, however, as the amount appears in the mass, still,\r\nif distributed among the families of the working men and the poorer\r\nclass of Londoners, it will be found that it allows but the merest\r\npittance per head per week for the consumption of those articles, which\r\nmay be fairly said to constitute the staple commodities of the dinners\r\nand “desserts!” of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PROVIDENCE AND IMPROVIDENCE OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers, like all wandering tribes, have generally no\r\nforesight; only an exceptional few are provident--and these are\r\nmostly the more intelligent of the class--though some of the very\r\nignorant do occasionally save. The providence of the more intelligent\r\ncostermonger enables him in some few cases to become “a settled man,”\r\nas I have before pointed out. He perhaps gets to be the proprietor\r\nof a coal-shed, with a greengrocery and potato business attached to\r\nit; and with the usual trade in oysters and ginger-beer. He may too,\r\nsometimes, have a sum of money in the savings’-bank, or he may invest\r\nit in the purchase of a lease of the premises he occupies, or expend\r\nit in furnishing the rooms of his house to let them out to single-men\r\nlodgers; or he may become an usurer, and lend out his money to his\r\nless provident brethren at 1040_l._ per cent. per annum; or he may\r\npurchase largely at the markets, and engage youths to sell his surplus\r\nstock at half profits.\r\n\r\nThe provident costermonger, who has thus “got on in the world,” is\r\nrarely speculative. He can hardly be induced to become a member of\r\na “building” or “freehold land” society, for instance. He has been\r\naccustomed to an almost _immediate_ return for his outlays, and\r\ndistrusts any remote or contingent profit. A regular costermonger--or\r\nany one who has been a regular costermonger, in whatever trade he may\r\nbe afterwards engaged--generally dies intestate, let his property be\r\nwhat it may; but there is seldom any dispute as to the disposition of\r\nhis effects: the widow takes possession of them, as a matter of course.\r\nIf there be grown-up children, they may be estranged from home, and not\r\ntrouble their heads about the matter; or, if not estranged, an amicable\r\narrangement is usually come to. The costermongers’ dread of all courts\r\nof law, or of anything connected with the law, is only second to their\r\nhatred of the police.\r\n\r\nThe more ignorant costermonger, on the other hand, if he be of a\r\nsaving turn, and have no great passion for strong drink or gaming, is\r\noften afraid to resort to the simple modes of investment which I have\r\nmentioned. He will rather keep money in his pocket; for, though it does\r\nnot fructify there, at least it is safe. But this is only when provided\r\nwith a donkey or pony “what suits;” when not so provided, he will “suit\r\nhimself” forthwith. If, however, he have saved a little money, and have\r\na craving after gambling or amusements, he is sure at last to squander\r\nit that way. Such a man, without any craving for drink or gaming,\r\nwill often continue to pay usuriously for the hire of his barrow, not\r\nsuspecting that he is purchasing it over and over and over again, in\r\nhis weekly payments. To suggest to him that he might place his money in\r\na bank, is to satisfy him that he would be “had” in some way or other,\r\nas he believes all banks and public institutions to be connected with\r\ngovernment, and the taxes, and the police. Were any one to advise a\r\nman of this class--and it must be remembered that I am speaking of the\r\n_ignorant_ costers--to invest a spare 50_l._ (supposing he possessed\r\nit) in the “three per cents.,” it would but provoke a snappish remark\r\nthat he knew nothing about them, and would have nothing to do with\r\nthem; for he would be satisfied that there was “some cheatery at the\r\nbottom.” If he could be made to understand what is meant by 3_l._ per\r\ncentum per annum, he would be sure to be indignant at the robbery of\r\ngiving only 7-1/2_d._ for the use of 1_l._ for a whole year!\r\n\r\nI may state, in conclusion, that a costermonger of the class I have\r\nbeen describing, mostly objects to give change for a five-pound note;\r\nhe will sooner give credit--when he knows “the party”--than change,\r\neven if he have it. If, however, he feels compelled, rather than offend\r\na regular customer, to take the note, he will not rest until he has\r\nobtained sovereigns for it at a neighbouring innkeeper’s, or from some\r\ntradesman to whom he is known. “Sovereigns,” said one man, and not a\r\nvery ignorant man, to me, “is something to lay hold on; a note ain’t.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, should one of the more ignorant, having tastes for the\r\nbeer-shop, &c., meet with “a great haul,” or save 5_l._ by some\r\ncontinuous industry (which he will most likely set down as “luck”),\r\nhe will spend it idly or recklessly in dissipation and amusement,\r\nregardless of the coming winter, whatever he may have suffered during\r\nthe past. Nor, though they know, from the bitterest experience, that\r\ntheir earnings in the winter are not half those of the rest of the\r\nyear, and that they are incapacitated from pursuing their trade in bad\r\nweather, do they endeavour to make the extra gains of their best time\r\nmitigate the want of the worst.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS IN BAD WEATHER AND DURING THE CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n“Three wet days,” I was told by a clergyman, who is now engaged in\r\nselling stenographic cards in the streets, “will bring the greater part\r\nof 30,000 street-people to the brink of starvation.” This statement,\r\nterrible as it is, is not exaggerated. The average number of wet days\r\nevery year in London is, according to the records of the Royal Society,\r\n161--that is to say, rain falls in the metropolis more than three days\r\nin each week, and very nearly every other day throughout the year. How\r\nprecarious a means of living then must street-selling be!\r\n\r\nWhen a costermonger cannot pursue his out-door labour, he leaves it to\r\nthe women and children to “work the public-houses,” while he spends his\r\ntime in the beer-shop. Here he gambles away his stock-money oft enough,\r\n“if the cards or the luck runs again him;” or else he has to dip into\r\nhis stock-money to support himself and his family. He must then borrow\r\nfresh capital at any rate of interest to begin again, and he begins on\r\na small scale. If it be in the cheap and busy seasons, he may buy a pad\r\nof soles for 2_s._ 6_d._, and clear 5_s._ on them, and that “sets him\r\na-going again, and then he gets his silk handkerchief out of pawn, and\r\ngoes as usual to market.”\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the costermongers during the prevalence of the\r\ncholera in 1849, were intense. Their customers generally relinquished\r\nthe consumption of potatoes, greens, fruit, and fish; indeed, of almost\r\nevery article on the consumption of which the costermongers depend\r\nfor his daily bread. Many were driven to apply to the parish; “many\r\nhad relief and many hadn’t,” I was told. Two young men, within the\r\nknowledge of one of my informants, became professional thieves, after\r\nenduring much destitution. It does not appear that the costermongers\r\nmanifested any personal dread of the visitation of the cholera, or\r\nthought that their lives were imperilled: “We weren’t a bit afraid,”\r\nsaid one of them, “and, perhaps, that was the reason so few costers\r\ndied of the cholera. I knew them all in Lambeth, I think, and I knew\r\nonly one die of it, and he drank hard. Poor Waxy! he was a good fellow\r\nenough, and was well known in the Cut. But it was a terrible time for\r\nus, sir. It seems to me now like a shocking dream. Fish I could’nt\r\nsell a bit of; the people had a perfect dread of it--all but the poor\r\nIrish, and there was no making a crust out of them. _They_ had no\r\ndread of fish, however; indeed, they reckon it a religious sort of\r\nliving, living on fish,--but they _will_ have it dirt cheap. We were in\r\nterrible distress all that time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS’ RAFFLES.\r\n\r\nIn their relief of the sick, if relief it is to be called, the\r\ncostermongers resort to an exciting means; something is raffled, and\r\nthe proceeds given to the sufferer. This mode is common to other\r\nworking-classes; it partakes of the excitement of gambling, and is\r\nencouraged by the landlords of the houses to which the people resort.\r\nThe landlord displays the terms of the raffle in his bar a few days\r\nbefore the occurrence, which is always in the evening. The raffle\r\nis not confined to the sick, but when any one of the class is in\r\ndistress--that is to say, without stock-money, and unable to borrow\r\nit,--a raffle for some article of his is called at a public-house in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Cards are printed, and distributed among his mates.\r\nThe article, let it be whatever it may--perhaps a handkerchief--is\r\nput up at 6_d._ a member, and from twenty to forty members are got,\r\naccording as the man is liked by his “mates,” or as he has assisted\r\nothers similarly situated. The paper of every raffle is kept by the\r\nparty calling it, and before he puts his name down to a raffle for\r\nanother party, he refers to the list of subscribers to _his_ raffle,\r\nin order to see if the person ever assisted him. Raffles are very\r\n“critical things, the pint pots fly about wonderful sometimes”--to\r\nuse the words of one of my informants. The party calling the raffle\r\nis expected to take the chair, if he can write down the subscribers’\r\nnames. One who had been chairman at one of these meetings assured me\r\nthat on a particular occasion, having called a “general dealer” to\r\norder, the party very nearly split his head open with a quart measure.\r\nIf the hucksters know that the person calling the raffle is “down,”\r\nand that it is necessity that has made him call it, they will not\r\nallow the property put up to be thrown for. “If you was to go to the\r\nraffle to-night, sir,” said one of them to me, many months ago, before\r\nI became known to the class, “they’d say to one another directly you\r\ncome in, ‘Who’s this here swell? What’s he want?’ And they’d think you\r\nwere a ‘cad,’ or else a spy, come from the police. But they’d treat you\r\ncivilly, I’m sure. Some very likely would fancy you was a fast kind of\r\na gentleman, come there for a lark. But you need have no fear, though\r\nthe pint pots _does_ fly about sometimes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MARKETS AND TRADE RIGHTS OF THE COSTERMONGERS, AND OF THE LAWS\r\nAFFECTING THEM.\r\n\r\nThe next point of consideration is what are the legal regulations under\r\nwhich the several descriptions of hawkers and pedlars are allowed to\r\npursue their occupations.\r\n\r\nThe laws concerning hawkers and pedlars, (50 Geo. III., c. 41, and 6\r\nGeo. IV., c. 80,) treat of them as identical callings. The “hawker,”\r\nhowever, is, strictly speaking, one who sells wares by _crying_\r\nthem in the streets of towns, while the _pedlar_ travels _on foot_\r\nthrough the country with his wares, not publicly proclaiming them, but\r\nvisiting the houses on his way to solicit private custom. Until the\r\ncommencement of the present century--before the increased facilities\r\nfor conveyance--the pedlars were a numerous body in the country. The\r\nmajority of them were Scotchmen and some amassed considerable wealth.\r\nRailways, however, have now reduced the numbers to insignificance.\r\n\r\nHawkers and pedlars are required to pay 4_l._ yearly for a license, and\r\nan additional 4_l._ for every horse or ass employed in the conveyance\r\nof wares. The hawking or exposing for sale of fish, fruit, or victuals,\r\ndoes not require a license; and further, it is lawful for any one\r\n“being the maker of any home manufacture,” to expose it for sale in\r\nany fair or market, without a warrant. Neither does anything in either\r\nof the two acts in question prohibit “any tinker, cooper, glazier,\r\nplumber, harness-mender, or other person, from going about and carrying\r\nthe materials proper to their business.”\r\n\r\nThe right of the costermongers, then, to “hawk” their wares through\r\nthe streets is plainly inferred by the above acts; that is to say,\r\nnothing in them extends to prohibit persons “going about,” unlicensed,\r\nand at their own discretion, and selling fish, vegetables, fruit, or\r\nprovisions generally.\r\n\r\nThe law acknowledges none of the street “markets.” These congregatings\r\nare, indeed, in antagonism to the municipal laws of London, which\r\nprovide that no market, or public place where provisions are sold,\r\nshall be held within seven miles of the city. The law, though it\r\npermits butchers and other provisionmongers to hire stalls and\r\nstandings in the flesh and other markets, recognised by custom or\r\nusage, gives no such permission as to street-trading.\r\n\r\nThe right to sell provisions from stands in the streets of the\r\nmetropolis, it appears, is merely permissive. The regulation observed\r\nis this: where the costermongers or other street-dealers have been in\r\nthe habit of standing to sell their goods, they are not to be disturbed\r\nby the police unless on complaint of an adjacent shopkeeper or other\r\ninhabitant. If such a person shows that the costermonger, whose stand\r\nis near his premises, is by his improper conduct a nuisance, or that,\r\nby his clamour or any peculiarity in his mode of business, he causes a\r\ncrowd to gather and obstruct the thoroughfare, the policeman’s duty\r\nis to remove him. If the complaint from the inhabitants against the\r\nstreet-sellers be at all general the policemen of the beat report it to\r\nthe authorities, taking no steps until they receive instructions.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat anomalous, however, that the law now\r\nrecognises--inferentially it is true--the right of costermongers to\r\ncarry about their goods for sale. Formerly the stands were sometimes\r\ntolerated, but not the itinerancy.\r\n\r\nThe enactments of the Common-council from the time of Elizabeth are\r\nstringent against itinerant traders of all descriptions, but stringent\r\nto no purpose of prevention. In 1607, a Common-council enactment sets\r\nforth, that “many People of badd and lewde Condicon daylie resorte\r\nfrom the most Parte of this Realme to the said Cyttie, Suburbes, and\r\nPlaces adjoininge, procuringe themselves small Habytacons, namely, one\r\nChamber-Roome for a poore Forreynor and his Familye, in a small Cottage\r\nwith some other as poore as himself in the Cyttie, Suburbes, or Places\r\nadjacente, to the great Increase and Pestringe of this Cyttie with\r\npoore People; many of them proovinge Shifters, lyvinge by Cozeninge,\r\nStealinge, and Imbeazellinge of Mens Gooddes as Opportunitye may serve\r\nthem, remoovinge from Place to Place accordinglye; many Tymes runninge\r\naway, forsakinge their Wives and Children, leavinge them to the Charge\r\nof the said Cyttie, and the Hospitalles of the same.”\r\n\r\nIt was towards this class of men who, by their resort to the capital,\r\nrecruited the numbers of the street-sellers and public porters\r\nand others that the jealousy of the Corporation was directed. The\r\ncity shop-keepers, three centuries ago, complained vehemently and\r\ncontinuously of the injuries inflicted on their trade by itinerant\r\ndealers, complaints which led to bootless enactments. In Elizabeth’s\r\nreign the Court of Common Council declared that the streets of the city\r\nshould be used, as in ancient times, for the common highway, and not\r\nfor the traffic of hucksters, pedlars, and hagglers. But this traffic\r\nincreased, and in 1632 another enactment was accounted necessary.\r\nOyster-wives, herb-wives, tripe-wives, and all such “unruly people,”\r\nwere threatened with the full pains and penalties of the outraged\r\nlaw if they persevered in the prosecution of their callings, which\r\nare stigmatised as “a way whereby to live a more easie life than by\r\nlabour.” In 1694 the street-sellers were menaced with the punishments\r\nthen deemed suitable for arrant rogues and sturdy beggars--whipping;\r\nand that remedy to be applied alike to males and females!\r\n\r\nThe tenor of these Vagrant Laws not being generally known, I here\r\ntranscribe them, as another proof of the “wisdom” and mercy of our\r\n“ancestors” in “the good old times!”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1530 the English Parliament enacted, that, while the\r\nimpotent poor should receive licenses from the justices of the peace\r\nto beg within certain limits, all men and _women_, “being whole and\r\nmighty in body, and able to labour,” if found vagrant and unable\r\nto give an account as to how they obtained their living, should be\r\napprehended by the constables, tied to the tail of a cart _naked_,\r\nand beaten with whips through the nearest market-town, or hamlet,\r\n“till their bodies be bloody by reason of such whipping!” Five years\r\nafterwards it was added, that, if the individual had been once already\r\nwhipped, he or she should not only be whipped again, but “also shall\r\nhave the upper part of the gristle of his ear clean cut off, so as\r\nit may appear for a perpetual token hereafter that he hath been a\r\ncontemner of the good order of the commonwealth.” And finally, in 1562,\r\nit was directed that any beggar convicted of being a vagabond should,\r\nafter being grievously whipped, be burnt through the gristle of the\r\nright ear “with a hot iron of the compass of an inch about,” unless\r\nsome person should agree to take him as a servant--of course without\r\nwages--for a year; then, that if he twice ran away from such master, he\r\nshould be adjudged a felon; and that if he ran away a third time, he\r\nshould “suffer pains of death and loss of land and goods as a felon,\r\nwithout benefit of clergy or sanctuary.”\r\n\r\nThe only acts now in force which regulate the government of the\r\nstreets, so to speak, are those best known as Michael Angelo Taylor’s\r\nAct, and the 2 & 3 Vic., best known as the Police Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE REMOVALS OF COSTERMONGERS FROM THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nSuch are the laws concerning street trading: let us now see the effect\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWithin these three months, or little more, there have been many\r\nremovals of the costermongers from their customary standings in the\r\nstreets. This, as I have stated, is never done, unless the shopkeepers\r\nrepresent to the police that the costermongers are an injury and a\r\nnuisance to them in the prosecution of their respective trades. The\r\ncostermongers, for the most part, know nothing of the representation\r\nof the shopkeepers, so that perhaps the first intimation that they\r\nmust “quit” comes from the policemen, who thus incur the full odium\r\nof the measure, the majority of the street people esteeming it a mere\r\narbitrary act on the part of the members of the force.\r\n\r\nThe first removal, recently, took place in Leather-lane, Holborn,\r\nbetween three and four months back. It was effected in consequence of\r\nrepresentations from the shopkeepers of the neighbourhood. But the\r\nremoval was of a brief continuance. “Leather-lane,” I was told, “looked\r\nlike a desert compared to what it was. People that had lived there for\r\nyears hardly knew their own street; and those that had complained,\r\nmight twiddle their thumbs in their shops for want of something better\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\nThe reason, or one reason, why the shopkeepers’ trade is co-existent\r\nwith that of the street-sellers was explained to me in this way by a\r\ntradesman perfectly familiar with the subject. “The poorer women, the\r\nwives of mechanics or small tradesmen, who have to prepare dinners\r\nfor their husbands, like, as they call it, ‘to make one errand do.’\r\nIf the wife buys fish or vegetables in the street, as is generally\r\ndone, she will, at the same time, buy her piece of bacon or cheese\r\nat the cheesemonger’s, her small quantity of tea and sugar at the\r\ngrocer’s, her fire-wood at the oilman’s, or her pound of beef or liver\r\nat the butcher’s. In all the street-markets there are plenty of such\r\ntradesmen, supplying necessaries not vended in the streets, and so\r\none errand is sufficient to provide for the wants of the family. Such\r\ncustomers--that is, such as have been used to buy in the streets--will\r\n_not_ be driven to buy at the shops. They can’t be persuaded that\r\nthey can buy as cheap at the shops; and besides they are apt to think\r\nshopkeepers are rich and street-sellers poor, and that they may as\r\nwell encourage the poor. So if one street-market is abolished, they’ll\r\ngo to another, or buy of the itinerant costermongers, and they’ll get\r\ntheir bits of groceries and the like at the shops in the neighbourhood\r\nof the other street-market, even if they have a walk for it; and thus\r\neverybody’s injured by removing markets, except a few, and they are\r\nthose at the nearest markets that’s not disturbed.”\r\n\r\nIn Leather-lane the shopkeepers speedily retrieved what many soon\r\ncame to consider the false step (as regards their interests) which\r\nthey had taken, and in a fortnight or so, they managed, by further\r\nrepresentations to the police authorities, and by agreement with the\r\nstreet-sellers, that the street-market people should return. In little\r\nmore than a fortnight from that time, Leather-lane, Holborn, resumed\r\nits wonted busy aspect.\r\n\r\nIn Lambeth the case at present is different. The men, women, and\r\nchildren, between two and three months back, were all driven by the\r\npolice from their standings. These removals were made, I am assured,\r\nin consequence of representations to the police from the parishioners,\r\nnot of Lambeth, but of the adjoining parish of Christchurch,\r\nBlackfriars-road, who described the market as an injury and a hindrance\r\nto their business. The costermongers, etc., were consequently driven\r\nfrom the spot.\r\n\r\nA highly respectable tradesman in “the Cut” told me, that he and\r\nall his brother shopkeepers had found their receipts diminished a\r\nquarter, or an eighth at least, by the removal; and as in all populous\r\nneighbourhoods profits were small, this falling off was a very serious\r\nmatter to them.\r\n\r\nIn “the Cut” and its immediate neighbourhood, are tradesmen who\r\nsupply street-dealers with the articles they trade in,--such as cheap\r\nstationery, laces, children’s shoes, braces, and toys. They, of course,\r\nhave been seriously affected by the removal; but the pinch has fallen\r\nsorest upon the street-sellers themselves. These people depend a good\r\ndeal one upon another, as they make mutual purchases; now, as they have\r\nneither stalls nor means, such a source of profit is abolished.\r\n\r\n“It is hard on such as me,” said a fruit-seller to me, “to be driven\r\naway, for nothing that I’ve done wrong as I knows of, and not let me\r\nmake a living, as I’ve been brought up to. I can’t get no work at any\r\nof the markets. I’ve tried Billingsgate and the Borough hard, but\r\nthere is so many poor men trying for a crust, they’re fit to knock a\r\nnew-comer’s head off, though if they did, it wouldn’t be much matter.\r\nI had 9_s._ 6_d._ stock-money, and I sold the apples and a few pears I\r\nhad for 3_s._ 9_d._, and that 13_s._ 3_d._ I’ve been spinning out since\r\nI lost my pitch. But it’s done now, and I haven’t had two meals a day\r\nfor a week and more--and them not to call meals--only bread and coffee,\r\nor bread and a drink of beer. I tried to get a round of customers, but\r\nall the rounds was full, and I’m a very bad walker, and a weak man\r\ntoo. My wife’s gone to try the country--I don’t know where she is now.\r\nI suppose I shall lose my lodging this week, and then I must see what\r\n‘the great house’ will say to me. Perhaps they’ll give me nothing, but\r\ntake me in, and that’s hard on a man as don’t want to be a pauper.”\r\n\r\nAnother man told me that he now paid 3_s._ a week for privilege to\r\nstand with two stalls on a space opposite the entrance into the\r\nNational Baths, New Cut; and that he and his wife, who had stood for\r\neleven years in the neighbourhood, without a complaint against them,\r\ncould hardly get a crust.\r\n\r\nOne man, with a fruit-stall, assured me that nine months ago he\r\nwould not have taken 20_l._ for his pitch, and now he was a “regular\r\nbankrupt.” I asked a girl, who stood beside the kerb with her load in\r\nfront strapped round her loins, whether her tray was heavy to carry.\r\n“After eight hours at it,” she answered, “it swaggers me, like drink.”\r\nThe person whom I was with brought to me two girls, who, he informed\r\nme, had been forced to go upon the streets to gain a living. Their\r\nstall on the Saturday night used to have 4_l._ worth of stock; but\r\ntrade had grown so bad since the New Police order, that after living on\r\ntheir wares, they had taken to prostitution for a living, rather than\r\ngo to the “house.” The ground in front of the shops has been bought\r\nup by the costermongers at any price. Many now give the tradesmen six\r\nshillings a week for a stand, and one man pays as much as eight for the\r\nright of pitching in front.\r\n\r\nThe applications for parochial relief, in consequence of these\r\nremovals, have been fewer than was anticipated. In Lambeth parish,\r\nhowever, about thirty families have been relieved, at a cost of 50_l._\r\nStrange to say, a quarter, or rather more, of the very applicants for\r\nrelief had been furnished by the parish with money to start the trade,\r\ntheir expulsion from which had driven them to pauperism.\r\n\r\nIt consequently becomes a question for serious consideration, whether\r\nany particular body of householders should, for their own interest,\r\nconvenience, or pleasure, have it in their power to deprive so many\r\npoor people of their only means of livelihood, and so either force\r\nthe rate-payers to keep them as paupers, or else drive the women, who\r\nobject to the imprisonment of the Union, to prostitution, and the\r\nmen to theft--especially when the very occupation which they are not\r\nallowed to pursue, not only does no injury to the neighbourhood, but\r\nis, on the contrary, the means of attracting considerable custom to the\r\nshops in the locality, and has, moreover, been provided for them by\r\nthe parish authorities as a means of enabling them to get a living for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TRICKS OF COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nI shall now treat of the tricks of trade practised by the London\r\ncostermongers. Of these the costers speak with as little reserve and\r\nas little shame as a fine gentleman of his peccadilloes. “I’ve boiled\r\nlots of oranges,” chuckled one man, “and sold them to Irish hawkers,\r\nas wasn’t wide awake, for stunning big uns. The boiling swells the\r\noranges and so makes ’em look finer ones, but it spoils them, for it\r\ntakes out the juice. People can’t find that out though until it’s too\r\nlate. I boiled the oranges only a few minutes, and three or four dozen\r\nat a time.” Oranges thus prepared will not keep, and any unfortunate\r\nIrishwoman, tricked as were my informant’s customers, is astonished\r\nto find her stock of oranges turn dark-coloured and worthless in\r\nforty-eight hours. The fruit is “cooked” in this way for Saturday night\r\nand Sunday sale--times at which the demand is the briskest. Some prick\r\nthe oranges and express the juice, which they sell to the British\r\nwine-makers.\r\n\r\nApples cannot be dealt with like oranges, but they are mixed. A cheap\r\nred-skinned fruit, known to costers as “gawfs,” is rubbed hard, to\r\nlook bright and feel soft, and is mixed with apples of a superior\r\ndescription. “Gawfs are sweet and sour at once,” I was told, “and fit\r\nfor nothing but mixing.” Some foreign apples, from Holland and Belgium,\r\nwere bought very cheap last March, at no more than 16_d._ a bushel, and\r\non a fine morning as many as fifty boys might be seen rubbing these\r\napples, in Hooper-street, Lambeth. “I’ve made a crown out of a bushel\r\nof ’em on a fine day,” said one sharp youth. The larger apples are\r\nrubbed sometimes with a piece of woollen cloth, or on the coat skirt,\r\nif that appendage form part of the dress of the person applying the\r\nfriction, but most frequently they are rolled in the palms of the\r\nhand. The smaller apples are thrown to and fro in a sack, a lad holding\r\neach end. “I wish I knew how the shopkeepers manages _their_ fruit,”\r\nsaid one youth to me; “I should like to be up to some of their moves;\r\nthey do manage their things so plummy.”\r\n\r\nCherries are capital for mixing, I was assured by practical men. They\r\npurchase three sieves of indifferent Dutch, and one sieve of good\r\nEnglish cherries, spread the English fruit over the inferior quality,\r\nand sell them as the best. Strawberry pottles are often half cabbage\r\nleaves, a few tempting strawberries being displayed on the top of the\r\npottle. “Topping up,” said a fruit dealer to me, “is the principal\r\nthing, and we are perfectly justified in it. You ask any coster that\r\nknows the world, and he’ll tell you that all the salesmen in the\r\nmarkets tops up. It’s only making the best of it.” Filberts they bake\r\nto make them look brown and ripe. Prunes they boil to give them a\r\nplumper and finer appearance. The latter trick, however, is not unusual\r\nin the shops.\r\n\r\nThe more honest costermongers will throw away fish when it is unfit\r\nfor consumption, less scrupulous dealers, however, only throw away\r\nwhat is utterly unsaleable; but none of them fling away the dead eels,\r\nthough their prejudice against such dead fish prevents their indulging\r\nin eel-pies. The dead eels are mixed with the living, often in the\r\nproportion of 20 lb. dead to 5 lb. alive, equal quantities of each\r\nbeing accounted very fair dealing. “And after all,” said a street fish\r\ndealer to me, “I don’t know why dead eels should be objected to; the\r\naristocrats don’t object to them. Nearly all fish is dead before it’s\r\ncooked, and why not eels? Why not eat them when they’re sweet, if\r\nthey’re ever so dead, just as you eat fresh herrings? I believe it’s\r\nonly among the poor and among our chaps, that there’s this prejudice.\r\nEels die quickly if they’re exposed to the sun.”\r\n\r\nHerrings are made to look fresh and bright by candle-light, by the\r\nlights being so disposed “as to give them,” I was told, “a good\r\nreflection. Why I can make them look splendid; quite a pictur. I can do\r\nthe same with mackerel, but not so prime as herrings.”\r\n\r\nThere are many other tricks of a similar kind detailed in the course of\r\nmy narrative. We should remember, however, that _shopkeepers_ are not\r\nimmaculate in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE KIND AND QUANTITIES OF FISH SOLD BY THE LONDON COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nHaving now given the reader a general view of the numbers, characters,\r\nhabits, tastes, amusements, language, opinions, earnings, and\r\nvicissitudes of the London costermongers,--having described their usual\r\nstyle of dress, diet, homes, conveyances, and street-markets,--having\r\nexplained where their donkeys are bought, or the terms on which they\r\nborrow them, their barrows, their stock-money, and occasionally\r\ntheir stock itself,--having shown their ordinary mode of dealing,\r\neither in person or by deputy, either at half-profits or by means\r\nof boys,--where they go and how they manage on their rounds in town\r\nand in the country,--what are the laws affecting them, as well as\r\nthe operation of those laws upon the rest of the community,--having\r\ndone all this by way of giving the reader a general knowledge of the\r\nstreet-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables,--I now proceed to treat\r\nmore particularly of each of these classes _seriatim_. Beginning\r\nwith the street-fishmongers, I shall describe, in due order, the\r\nseason when, the market where, and the classes of people by whom, the\r\nwet-fish, the dry-fish, and the shell-fish are severally sold and\r\npurchased in the London streets, together with all other concomitant\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe facilities of railway conveyance, by means of which fish can be\r\nsent from the coast to the capital with much greater rapidity, and\r\ntherefore be received much fresher than was formerly the case, have\r\nbrought large supplies to London from places that before contributed\r\nno quantity to the market, and so induced, as I heard in all quarters\r\nat Billingsgate, an extraordinary lowness of price in this species of\r\ndiet. This cheap food, through the agency of the costermongers, is\r\nconveyed to every poor man’s door, both in the thickly-crowded streets\r\nwhere the poor reside--a family at least in a room--in the vicinity of\r\nDrury-lane and of Whitechapel, in Westminster, Bethnal-green, and St.\r\nGiles’s, and through the long miles of the suburbs. For all low-priced\r\nfish the poor are the costermongers’ best customers, and a fish diet\r\nseems becoming almost as common among the ill-paid classes of London,\r\nas is a potato diet among the peasants of Ireland. Indeed, now, the\r\nfish season of the poor never, or rarely, knows an interruption. If\r\nfresh herrings are not in the market, there are sprats; and if not\r\nsprats, there are soles, or whitings, or mackarel, or plaice.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the very neediest of our needy metropolitan population,\r\nalways smell of fish; most frequently of herrings. So much so, indeed,\r\nthat to those who, like myself, have been in the habit of visiting\r\ntheir dwellings, the smell of herrings, even in comfortable homes,\r\nsavours from association, so strongly of squalor and wretchedness, as\r\nto be often most oppressive. The volatile oil of the fish seems to\r\nhang about the walls and beams of the rooms for ever. Those who have\r\nexperienced the smell of fish only in a well-ordered kitchen, can\r\nform no adequate notion of this stench, in perhaps a dilapidated and\r\nill-drained house, and in a rarely-cleaned room; and I have many a time\r\nheard both husband and wife--one couple especially, who were “sweating”\r\nfor a gorgeous clothes’ emporium--say that they had not time to be\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger supplies the poor with every kind of fish, for he\r\ndeals, usually, in every kind when it is cheap. Some confine their\r\ndealings to such things as shrimps, or periwinkles, but the adhering\r\nto one particular article is the exception and not the rule; while\r\nshrimps, lobsters, &c., are rarely bought by the very poor. Of the\r\nentire quantity of fish sent to Billingsgate-market, the costermongers,\r\nstationary and itinerant, may be said to sell one-third, taking one\r\nkind with another.\r\n\r\nThe fish sent to London is known to Billingsgate salesmen as “red”\r\nand “white” fish. The red fish is, as regards the metropolitan mart,\r\nconfined to the salmon. The other descriptions are known as “white.”\r\nThe costermongers classify the fish they vend as “wet” and “dry.”\r\nAll fresh fish is “wet;” all cured or salted fish, “dry.” The fish\r\nwhich is sold “pickled,” is known by that appellation, but its street\r\nsale is insignificant. The principal fish-staple, so to speak of the\r\nstreet-fishmonger, is soles, which are in supply all, or nearly all,\r\nthe year. The next are herrings, mackarel, whitings, Dutch eels, and\r\nplaice. The trade in plaice and sprats is almost entirely in the hands\r\nof the costermongers; their sale of shrimps is nearer a half than a\r\nthird of the entire quantity sent to Billingsgate; but their purchase\r\nof cod, or of the best lobsters, or crabs, is far below a third. The\r\ncostermonger rarely buys turbot, or brill, or even salmon, unless he\r\ncan retail it at 6_d._ the pound. When it is at that price, a street\r\nsalmon-seller told me that the eagerness to buy it was extreme. He had\r\nknown persons, who appeared to him to be very poor, buy a pound of\r\nsalmon, “just for a treat once in a way.” His best, or rather readiest\r\ncustomers--for at 6_d._ a pound all classes of the community may be\r\nsaid to be his purchasers--were the shopkeepers of the busier parts,\r\nand the occupants of the smaller private houses of the suburbs. During\r\nthe past year salmon was scarce and dear, and the costermongers bought,\r\ncomparatively, none of it. In a tolerably cheap season they do not sell\r\nmore than from a fifteenth to a twentieth of the quantity received at\r\nBillingsgate.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to arrive at the quantity or weight of the\r\nseveral kinds of fish sold by the costermongers in the streets of\r\nLondon, it is necessary that we should know the entire amount sent\r\nto Billingsgate-market, for it is only by estimating the proportion\r\nwhich the street-sale bears to the whole, that we can attain even an\r\napproximation to the truth. The following Table gives the results of\r\ncertain information collected by myself for the first time, I believe,\r\nin this country. The facts, as well as the estimated proportions of\r\neach kind of fish sold by the costermongers, have been furnished me\r\nby the most eminent of the Billingsgate salesmen--gentlemen to whom\r\nI am under many obligations for their kindness, consideration, and\r\nassistance, at all times and seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE, SHOWING THE QUANTITY, WEIGHT, OR MEASURE OF THE FOLLOWING KINDS\r\n OF FISH

sprats.\r\n\r\n[2] The half-bushel measure at Billingsgate is double quantity--or,\r\nmore correctly, a bushel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COSTERMONGERS’ FISH SEASON.\r\n\r\nThe season for the street-fishmongers begins about October and ends in\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nIn October, or a month or two earlier, may-be, they generally deal\r\nin fresh herrings, the supply of which lasts up to about the middle\r\nor end of November. This is about the best season. The herrings are\r\nsold to the poor, upon an average, at twelve a groat, or from 3_s._\r\nto 4_s._ the hundred. After or during November, the sprat and plaice\r\nseason begins. The regular street-fishmonger, however, seldom deals\r\nin sprats. He “works” these only when there is no other fish to be\r\ngot. He generally considers this trade beneath him, and more fit for\r\nwomen than men. Those costers who do sell them dispose of them now by\r\nweight at the rate of 1_d._ to 2_d._ the pound--a bushel averaging from\r\n40 to 50 pounds. The plaice season continues to the first or second\r\nweek in May. During May the casualty season is on, and there is little\r\nfish certain from that time till salmon comes in, and this is about\r\nthe end of the month. The salmon season lasts till about the middle\r\nof July. The selling of salmon is a bad trade in the poor districts,\r\nbut a very good one in the better streets or the suburbs. At this work\r\nthe street-fishmonger will sometimes earn on a fine day from 5_s._\r\nto 12_s._ The losses, however, are very great in this article if the\r\nweather prove bad. If kept at all “over” it loses its colour, and\r\nturns to a pale red, which is seen immediately the knife goes into the\r\nfish. While I was obtaining this information some months back, a man\r\nwent past the window of the house in which I was seated, with a barrow\r\ndrawn by a donkey. He was crying, “Fresh cod, oh! 1-1/2_d._ a pound,\r\ncod alive, oh!” My informant called me to the window, saying, “Now,\r\nhere is what we call rough cod.” He told me it was three days old. He\r\nthought it was eatable _then_, he said. The eyes were dull and heavy\r\nand sunken, and the limp tails of the fish dangled over the ends of\r\nthe barrow. He said it was a hanging market that day--that is to say,\r\nthings had been dear, and the costers couldn’t pay the price for them.\r\nHe should fancy, he told me, the man had paid for the fish from 9_d._\r\nto 1_s._ each, which was at the rate of 1_d._ per pound. He was calling\r\nthem at 1-1/2_d._ He would not take less than this until he had “got\r\nhis own money in;” and then, probably, if he had one or two of the fish\r\nleft, he would put up with 1_d._ per pound. The weight he was “working”\r\nwas 12 oz. to the pound. My informant assured me he knew this, because\r\nhe had borrowed _his_ 12 oz. pound weight that morning. This, with\r\nthe draught of 2 oz. in the weighing-machine, and the ounce gained by\r\nplacing the fish at the end of the pan, would bring the actual weight\r\ngiven to 9 oz. per pound, and probably, he said the man had even a\r\nlighter pound weight in his barrow ready for a “scaly” customer.\r\n\r\nAfter the street-fishmonger has done his morning’s work, he sometimes\r\ngoes out with his tub of pickled salmon on a barrow or stall, and\r\nsells it in saucers at 1_d._ each, or by the piece. This he calls as\r\n“fine Newcastle salmon.” There is generally a great sale for this at\r\nthe races; and if country-people begin with a pennyworth they end with\r\na shillingsworth--a pennyworth, the costers say, makes a fool of the\r\nmouth. If they have any on hand, and a little stale, at the end of\r\nthe week, they sell it at the public-houses to the “Lushingtons,” and\r\nto them, with plenty of vinegar, it goes down sweet. It is generally\r\nbought for 7_s._ a kit, a little bit “pricked;” but, if good, the price\r\nis from 12_s._ to 18_s._ “We’re in no ways particular to that,” said\r\none candid coster to me. “We don’t have the eating on it ourselves, and\r\npeople a’n’t always got their taste, especially when they have been\r\ndrinking, and we sell a great deal to parties in that way. We think it\r\nno sin to cheat ’em of 1_d._ while the publicans takes 1_s._”\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of June the street-fishmonger looks for mackerel,\r\nand he is generally employed in selling this fish up to the end of\r\nJuly. After July the Billingsgate season is said to be finished.\r\nFrom this time to the middle of October, when the herrings return,\r\nhe is mostly engaged selling dried haddocks and red herrings,\r\nand other “cas’alty fish that may come across him.” Many of the\r\nstreet-fishmongers object to deal in periwinkles, or stewed mussels,\r\nor boiled whelks, because, being accustomed to take their money\r\nin sixpences at a time, they do not like, they say, to traffic in\r\nhalfpennyworths. The dealers in these articles are generally looked\r\nupon as an inferior class.\r\n\r\nThere are, during the day, two periods for the sale of street-fish--the\r\none (the morning trade) beginning about ten, and lasting till one\r\nin the day--and the other (the night trade) lasting from six in the\r\nevening up to ten at night. What fish is left in the forenoon is\r\ngenerally disposed of cheap at night. That sold at the latter time is\r\ngenerally used by the working-class for supper, or kept by them with a\r\nlittle salt in a cool place for the next day’s dinner, if it will last\r\nas long. Several articles are sold by the street-fishmonger chiefly by\r\nnight. These are oysters, lobsters, pickled salmon, stewed mussels,\r\nand the like. The reason why the latter articles sell better by night\r\nis, my informant says, “Because people are lofty-minded, and don’t\r\nlike to be seen eating on ’em in the street in the day-time.” Shrimps\r\nand winkles are the staple commodities of the afternoon trade, which\r\nlasts from three to half-past five in the evening. These articles are\r\ngenerally bought by the working-classes for their tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE.\r\n\r\nTo see this market in its busiest costermonger time, the visitor should\r\nbe there about seven o’clock on a Friday morning. The market opens at\r\nfour, but for the first two or three hours, it is attended solely by\r\nthe regular fishmongers and “bummarees” who have the pick of the best\r\nthere. As soon as these are gone, the costers’ sale begins.\r\n\r\nMany of the costers that usually deal in vegetables, buy a little fish\r\non the Friday. It is the fast day of the Irish, and the mechanics’\r\nwives run short of money at the end of the week, and so make up their\r\ndinners with fish; for this reason the attendance of costers’ barrows\r\nat Billingsgate on a Friday morning is always very great. As soon as\r\nyou reach the Monument you see a line of them, with one or two tall\r\nfishmonger’s carts breaking the uniformity, and the din of the cries\r\nand commotion of the distant market, begins to break on the ear like\r\nthe buzzing of a hornet’s nest. The whole neighbourhood is covered with\r\nthe hand-barrows, some laden with baskets, others with sacks. Yet as\r\nyou walk along, a fresh line of costers’ barrows are creeping in or\r\nbeing backed into almost impossible openings; until at every turning\r\nnothing but donkeys and rails are to be seen. The morning air is filled\r\nwith a kind of seaweedy odour, reminding one of the sea-shore; and\r\non entering the market, the smell of fish, of whelks, red herrings,\r\nsprats, and a hundred others, is almost overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe wooden barn-looking square where the fish is sold, is soon after\r\nsix o’clock crowded with shiny cord jackets and greasy caps. Everybody\r\ncomes to Billingsgate in his worst clothes, and no one knows the\r\nlength of time a coat can be worn until they have been to a fish sale.\r\nThrough the bright opening at the end are seen the tangled rigging of\r\nthe oyster-boats and the red worsted caps of the sailors. Over the hum\r\nof voices is heard the shouts of the salesmen, who, with their white\r\naprons, peering above the heads of the mob, stand on their tables,\r\nroaring out their prices.\r\n\r\nAll are bawling together--salesmen and hucksters of provisions,\r\ncapes, hardware, and newspapers--till the place is a perfect Babel\r\nof competition. “Ha-a-ansome cod! best in the market! All alive!\r\nalive! alive O!” “Ye-o-o! Ye-o-o! here’s your fine Yarmouth bloaters!\r\nWho’s the buyer?” “Here you are, governor, splendid whiting! some\r\nof the right sort!” “Turbot! turbot! all alive! turbot!” “Glass of\r\nnice peppermint! this cold morning a ha’penny a glass!” “Here you\r\nare at your own price! Fine soles, O!” “Oy! oy! oy! Now’s your time!\r\nfine grizzling sprats! all large and no small!” “Hullo! hullo here!\r\nbeautiful lobsters! good and cheap! fine cock crabs all alive O!”\r\n“Five brill and one turbot--have that lot for a pound! Come and\r\nlook at ’em, governor; you wont see a better sample in the market.”\r\n“Here, this way! this way for splendid skate! skate O! skate O!”\r\n“Had--had--had--had--haddick! all fresh and good!” “Currant and meat\r\npuddings! a ha’penny each!” “Now, you mussel-buyers, come along! come\r\nalong! come along! now’s your time for fine fat mussels!” “Here’s food\r\nfor the belly, and clothes for the back, but I sell food for the mind”\r\n(shouts the newsvender). “Here’s smelt O!” “Here ye are, fine Finney\r\nhaddick!” “Hot soup! nice peas-soup! a-all hot! hot!” “Ahoy! ahoy here!\r\nlive plaice! all alive O!” “Now or never! whelk! whelk! whelk!” “Who’ll\r\nbuy brill O! brill O!” “Capes! water-proof capes! sure to keep the\r\nwet out! a shilling a piece!” “Eels O! eels O! Alive! alive O!” “Fine\r\nflounders, a shilling a lot! Who’ll have this prime lot of flounders?”\r\n“Shrimps! shrimps! fine shrimps!” “Wink! wink! wink!” “Hi! hi-i! here\r\nyou are, just eight eels left, only eight!” “O ho! O ho! this way--this\r\nway--this way! Fish alive! alive! alive O!”\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the shed, the white bellies of the turbots, strung\r\nup bow-fashion, shine like mother-of-pearl, while, the lobsters, lying\r\nupon them, look intensely scarlet, from the contrast. Brown baskets\r\npiled up on one another, and with the herring-scales glittering like\r\nspangles all over them, block up the narrow paths. Men in coarse canvas\r\njackets, and bending under huge hampers, push past, shouting “Move\r\non! move on, there!” and women, with the long limp tails of cod-fish\r\ndangling from their aprons, elbow their way through the crowd. Round\r\nthe auction-tables stand groups of men turning over the piles of soles,\r\nand throwing them down till they slide about in their slime; some are\r\nsmelling them, while others are counting the lots. “There, that lot of\r\nsoles are worth your money,” cries the salesman to one of the crowd as\r\nhe moves on leisurely; “none better in the market. You shall have ’em\r\nfor a pound and half-a-crown.” “Oh!” shouts another salesman, “it’s no\r\nuse to bother him--he’s no go.” Presently a tall porter, with a black\r\noyster-bag, staggers past, trembling under the weight of his load, his\r\nback and shoulders wet with the drippings from the sack. “Shove on one\r\nside!” he mutters from between his clenched teeth, as he forces his\r\nway through the mob. Here is a tray of reddish-brown shrimps piled up\r\nhigh, and the owner busy sifting his little fish into another stand,\r\nwhile a doubtful customer stands in front, tasting the flavour of the\r\nstock and consulting with his companion in speculation. Little girls\r\ncarrying matting-bags, that they have brought from Spitalfields, come\r\nup, and ask you in a begging voice to buy their baskets; and women with\r\nbundles of twigs for stringing herrings, cry out, “Half-penny a bunch!”\r\nfrom all sides. Then there are blue-black piles of small live lobsters,\r\nmoving about their bound-up claws and long “feelers,” one of them\r\noccasionally being taken up by a looker-on, and dashed down again, like\r\na stone. Everywhere every one is asking, “What’s the price, master?”\r\nwhile shouts of laughter from round the stalls of the salesmen,\r\nbantering each other, burst out, occasionally, over the murmuring noise\r\nof the crowd. The transparent smelts on the marble-slabs, and the\r\nbright herrings, with the lump of transparent ice magnifying their eyes\r\nlike a lens, are seldom looked at until the market is over, though the\r\nhampers and piles of huge maids, dropping slime from the counter, are\r\neagerly examined and bartered for.\r\n\r\nOne side of the market is set apart for whelks. There they stand in\r\nsackfulls, with the yellow shells piled up at the mouth, and one or\r\ntwo of the fish, curling out like corkscrews, placed as a sample. The\r\ncoster slips one of these from its shell, examines it, pushes it back\r\nagain, and then passes away, to look well round the market. In one part\r\nthe stones are covered with herring-barrels, packed closely with dried\r\nfish, and yellow heaps of stiff haddock rise up on all sides. Here a\r\nman walks up with his knot on his shoulder, waiting for a job to carry\r\nfish to the trucks. Boys in ragged clothes, who have slept during the\r\nnight under a railway-arch, clamour for employment; while the heads of\r\nthose returning from the oyster-boats, rise slowly up the stone sides\r\nof the wharf.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers have nicknamed the long row of oyster boats moored\r\nclose alongside the wharf “Oyster-street.” On looking down the line\r\nof tangled ropes and masts, it seems as though the little boats would\r\nsink with the crowds of men and women thronged together on their decks.\r\nIt is as busy a scene as one can well behold. Each boat has its black\r\nsign-board, and salesman in his white apron walking up and down “his\r\nshop,” and on each deck is a bright pewter pot and tin-covered plate,\r\nthe remains of the salesman’s breakfast. “Who’s for Baker’s?” “Who’s\r\nfor Archer’s?” “Who’ll have Alston’s?” shout the oyster-merchants, and\r\nthe red cap of the man in the hold bobs up and down as he rattles the\r\nshells about with his spade. These holds are filled with oysters--a\r\ngray mass of sand and shell--on which is a bushel measure well piled\r\nup in the centre, while some of them have a blue muddy heap of\r\nmussels divided off from the “natives.” The sailors in their striped\r\nguernseys sit on the boat sides smoking their morning’s pipe, allowing\r\nthemselves to be tempted by the Jew boys with cloth caps, old shoes,\r\nand silk handkerchiefs. Lads with bundles of whips skip from one boat\r\nto another, and, seedy-looking mechanics, with handfuls of tin fancy\r\ngoods, hover about the salesmen, who are the principal supporters\r\nof this trade. The place has somewhat the appearance of a little\r\nHolywell-street; for the old clothes’ trade is entirely in the hands\r\nof the Jew boys, and coats, caps, hats, umbrellas, and old shoes, are\r\nshouted out in a rich nasal twang on all sides.\r\n\r\nPassing by a man and his wife who were breakfasting on the stone\r\ncoping, I went to the shore where the watermen ply for passengers\r\nto the eel boats. Here I found a crowd of punts, half filled with\r\nflounders, and small closely-packed baskets of them ranged along the\r\nseats. The lads, who act as jacks-in-the-water, were busy feeling in\r\nthe mud for the fish that had fallen over board, little caring for the\r\nwater that dashed over their red swollen feet. Presently a boat, piled\r\nup with baskets, shot in, grazing the bottom, and men and women, blue\r\nwith the cold morning air, stepped out.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch built eel-boats, with their bulging polished oak sides, were\r\nhalf-hidden in the river mist. They were surrounded by skiffs, that\r\nply from the Surrey and Middlesex shores, and wait whilst the fares\r\nbuy their fish. The holds of these eel-boats are fitted up with long\r\ntanks of muddy water, and the heads of the eels are seen breathing\r\non the surface--a thick brown bubble rising slowly, and floating to\r\nthe sides. Wooden sabots and large porcelain pipes are ranged round\r\nthe ledges, and men in tall fur caps with high cheek bones, and rings\r\nin their ears, walk the decks. At the stern of one boat was moored a\r\ncoffin-shaped barge pierced with holes, and hanging in the water were\r\nbaskets, shaped like olive jars--both to keep the stock of fish alive\r\nand fresh. In the centre of the boat stood the scales,--a tall heavy\r\napparatus, one side fitted up with the conical net-bag to hold the\r\neels, and the other with the weights, and pieces of stone to make up\r\nfor the extra draught of the water hanging about the fish. When a skiff\r\nload of purchasers arrives, the master Dutchman takes his hands from\r\nhis pockets, lays down his pipe, and seizing a sort of long-handled\r\nlanding-net scoops from the tank a lot of eels. The purchasers examine\r\nthem, and try to beat down the price. “You calls them eels do you?”\r\nsaid a man with his bag ready opened. “Yeas,” answered the Dutchman\r\nwithout any show of indignation. “Certainly, there is a few among\r\nthem,” continued the customer; and after a little more of this kind of\r\nchaffering the bargain is struck.\r\n\r\nThe visitors to the eel-boats were of all grades; one was a\r\nneatly-dressed girl to whom the costers showed the utmost gallantry,\r\ncalling her “my dear,” and helping her up the shining sides of the\r\nboat; and many of the men had on their blue serge apron, but these\r\nwere only where the prices were high. The greatest crowd of customers\r\nis in the heavy barge alongside of the Dutch craft. Here a stout\r\nsailor in his red woollen shirt, and canvass petticoat, is surrounded\r\nby the most miserable and poorest of fish purchasers--the men with\r\ntheir crushed hats, tattered coats, and unshorn chins, and the women\r\nwith their pads on their bonnets, and brown ragged gowns blowing in\r\nthe breeze. One, in an old table-cover shawl, was beating her palms\r\ntogether before the unmoved Dutchman, fighting for an abatement, and\r\nshowing her stock of halfpence. Others were seated round the barge,\r\nsorting their lots in their shallows, and sanding the fish till they\r\nwere quite yellow. Others, again, were crowding round the scales\r\nnarrowly watching the balance, and then begging for a few dead eels to\r\nmake up any doubtful weight.\r\n\r\nAs you walk back from the shore to the market, you see small groups\r\nof men and women dividing the lot of fish they have bought together.\r\nAt one basket, a coster, as you pass, calls to you, and says, “Here,\r\nmaster, just put these three halfpence on these three cod, and obleege\r\na party.” The coins are placed, and each one takes the fish his coin is\r\non; and so there is no dispute.\r\n\r\nAt length nearly all the busy marketing has finished, and the costers\r\nhurry to breakfast. At one house, known as “Rodway’s Coffee-house,”\r\na man can have a meal for 1_d._--a mug of hot coffee and two slices\r\nof bread and butter, while for two-pence what is elegantly termed “a\r\ntightner,” that is to say, a most plentiful repast, may be obtained.\r\nHere was a large room, with tables all round, and so extremely silent,\r\nthat the smacking of lips and sipping of coffee were alone heard.\r\nUpwards of 1,500 men breakfast here in the course of the morning,\r\nmany of them taking as many as three such meals. On the counter was a\r\npile of white mugs, and the bright tin cans stood beside the blazing\r\nfire, whilst Rodway himself sat at a kind of dresser, cutting up and\r\nbuttering the bread, with marvellous rapidity. It was a clean, orderly,\r\nand excellent establishment, kept by a man, I was told, who had risen\r\nfrom a saloop stall.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the Coal Exchange were ranged the stalls and barrows with\r\nthe street eatables, and the crowds round each showed the effects of\r\nthe sharp morning air. One--a Jew’s--had hot-pies with lids that rose\r\nas the gravy was poured in from an oil can; another carried a stone jar\r\nof peppermint-water, at 1/2_d._ a glass; and the pea-soup stand was\r\nhemmed in by boys and men blowing the steam from their cups. Beside\r\nthese were Jews with cloth caps and knives, and square yellow cakes;\r\none old man, in a corner, stood examining a thread-bare scarf that\r\na cravatless coster had handed to him. Coffee-stalls were in great\r\nplenty; and men left their barrows to run up and have “an oyster,”\r\nor “an ’ot heel.” One man here makes his living by selling sheets\r\nof old newspapers, at 1/2_d._ each, for the costers to dress their\r\ntrays with. Though seemingly rather out of place, there was a Mosaic\r\njewellery stand; old umbrellas, too, were far from scarce; and one had\r\nbrought a horse-hair stool for sale.\r\n\r\nEverybody was soon busy laying out their stock. The wrinkled dull-eyed\r\ncod was freshened up, the red-headed gurnet placed in rows, the eels\r\nprevented from writhing over the basket sides by cabbage-leaves, and\r\nthe soles paired off like gloves. Then the little trucks began to\r\nleave, crawling, as it were, between the legs of the horses in the vans\r\ncrowding Thames-street, and plunging in between huge waggons, but still\r\nappearing safely on the other side; and the 4,000 costers who visit\r\nBillingsgate on the Friday morning were shortly scattered throughout\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FORESTALLING OF MARKETS AND THE BILLINGSGATE BUMMAREES.\r\n\r\n“Forestalling,” writes Adam Smith, “is the buying or contracting for\r\nany cattle, provisions, or merchandize, on its way to the market (or\r\nat market), or dissuading persons from buying their goods there, or\r\npersuading them to raise the price, or spreading any false rumour with\r\nintent to enhance the value of any article. In the remoter periods of\r\nour history several statutes were passed, prohibiting forestalling\r\nunder severe penalties; but as more enlarged views upon such subjects\r\nbegan to prevail, their impolicy became obvious, and they were\r\nconsequently repealed in 1772. But forestalling is still punishable by\r\nfine and imprisonment; though it be doubtful whether any jury would now\r\nconvict an individual accused of such practices.”\r\n\r\nIn Billingsgate the “forestallers” or middlemen are known as\r\n“bummarees,” who, as regards means, are a far superior class to the\r\n“hagglers” (the forestallers of the “green” markets). The bummaree is\r\nthe jobber or speculator on the fish-exchange. Perhaps on every busy\r\nmorning 100 men buy a quantity of fish, which they account likely\r\nto be remunerative, and retail it, or dispose of it in lots to the\r\nfishmongers or costermongers. Few if any of these dealers, however,\r\nare merely bummarees. A salesman, if he have disposed of the fish\r\nconsigned to himself, will turn bummaree if any bargain tempt him. Or\r\na fishmonger may purchase twice the quantity he requires for his own\r\ntrade, in order to procure a cheaper stock, and “bummaree” what he does\r\nnot require. These speculations in fish are far more hazardous than\r\nthose in fruit or vegetables, for later in the day a large consignment\r\nby railway may reach Billingsgate, and, being thrown upon the market,\r\nmay reduce the price one half. In the vegetable and fruit markets there\r\nis but one arrival. The costermongers are among the best customers of\r\nthe bummarees.\r\n\r\nI asked several parties as to the origin of the word “bummaree,” and\r\nhow long it had been in use. “Why, bless your soul, sir,” said one\r\nBillingsgate labourer, “there always was bummarees, and there always\r\nwill be; just as Jack there is a ‘rough,’ and I’m a blessed ‘bobber.’”\r\nOne man assured me it was a French name; another that it was Dutch. A\r\nfishmonger, to whom I was indebted for information, told me he thought\r\nthat the bummaree was originally a bum-boat man, who purchased of\r\nthe wind-bound smacks at Gravesend or the Nore, and sent the fish up\r\nrapidly to the market by land.\r\n\r\nI may add, as an instance of the probable gains of the forestallers, in\r\nthe olden time, that a tradesman whose family had been long connected\r\nwith Billingsgate, showed me by his predecessors’ books and memoranda,\r\nthat in the depth of winter, when the Thames was perhaps choked with\r\nice, and no supply of fish “got up” to London, any, that might, by\r\nmanagement, reach Billingsgate used to command exorbitant prices.\r\nTo speak only of the present century: March 11th, 1802, a cod fish\r\n(8 lbs.) was bought by Messrs. Phillips and Robertson, fishmongers,\r\nBond-street, for 1_l._ 8_s._ February, 1809, a salmon (19 lbs.) was\r\nbought by Mr. Phillips at a guinea a pound, 19_l._ 19_s._ for the fish!\r\nMarch 24th, 1824, three lobsters were sold for a guinea each.\r\n\r\nThe “haggler,” I may here observe, is the bummaree or forestaller or\r\nmiddleman of the green markets; as far as the costermonger’s trade is\r\nconcerned, he deals in fruit and vegetables. Of these trafficers there\r\nare fully 200 in Covent-garden-market; from 60 to 70 in Farringdon;\r\nfrom 40 to 50 in the Borough; from 50 to 60 in Spitalfields; and none\r\nin Portman-market; such being the only wholesale green-markets for the\r\npurposes of the costermongers. The haggler is a middleman who makes\r\nhis purchases of the growers when the day is somewhat advanced, and\r\nthe whole produce conveyed to the market has not been disposed of. The\r\ngrower will then, rather than be detained in town, sell the whole lot\r\nremaining in his cart or wagon to a haggler, who re-sells it to the\r\ncosters, or to any other customer, from a stand which he hires by the\r\nday. The costermongers who are the most provident, and either have\r\nmeans or club their resources for a large purchase, often buy early in\r\nthe morning, and so have the advantage of anticipating their fellows in\r\nthe street-trade, with the day before them. Those who buy later are the\r\ncustomers of the hagglers, and are street-sellers, whose means do not\r\ncommand an extensive purchase, or who do not care to venture upon one\r\nunless it be very cheap. These men speak very bitterly of the hagglers,\r\ncalling them “cracked-up shop-keepers” and “scurfs,” and declaring that\r\nbut for them the growers must remain, and sell off their produce cheap\r\nto the costermongers.\r\n\r\nA species of forestalling is now not uncommon, and is on the increase\r\namong the costermongers themselves. There are four men, having the\r\ncommand of money, who attend the markets and buy either fish or\r\nvegetables largely. One man especially buys almost daily as much fruit\r\nand vegetables as will supply thirty street-dealers. He adds 3_d._ a\r\nbushel to the wholesale market price of apples; 6_d._ to that of pears;\r\n9_d._ to plums; and 1_s._ to cherries. A purchaser can thus get a\r\nsmaller quantity than he can always buy at market, and avails himself\r\nof the opportunity.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a good many of the more intelligent street-dealers now club\r\ntogether--six of them, for instance--contributing 15_s._ each, and\r\na quantity of fish is thus bought by one of their body (a smaller\r\ncontribution suffices to buy vegetables). Perhaps, on an equal\r\npartition, each man thus gets for his 15_s._ as much as might have cost\r\nhim 20_s._, had he bought “single-handed.” This mode of purchase is\r\nalso on the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “WET” FISH-SELLERS IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nConcerning the sale of “wet” or fresh fish, I had the following account\r\nfrom a trustworthy man, of considerable experience and superior\r\neducation:\r\n\r\n“I have sold ‘wet fish’ in the streets for more than fourteen years,”\r\nhe said; “before that I was a gentleman, and was brought up a\r\ngentleman, if I’m a beggar now. I bought fish largely in the north of\r\nEngland once, and now I must sell it in the streets of London. Never\r\nmind talking about that, sir; there’s some things won’t bear talking\r\nabout. There’s a wonderful difference in the streets since I knew them\r\nfirst; I could make a pound then, where I can hardly make a crown now.\r\nPeople had more money, and less meanness then. I consider that the\r\nrailways have injured me, and all wet fish-sellers, to a great extent.\r\nFish now, you see, sir, comes in at all hours, so that nobody can\r\ncalculate on the quantity that will be received--nobody. That’s the\r\nmischief of it; we are afraid to buy, and miss many a chance of turning\r\na penny. In my time, since railways were in, I’ve seen cod-fish sold at\r\na guinea in the morning that were a shilling at noon; for either the\r\nwind and the tide had served, or else the railway fishing-places were\r\nmore than commonly supplied, and there was a glut to London. There’s\r\nno trade requires greater judgment than mine--none whatever. Before\r\nthe railways--and I never could see the good of them--the fish came in\r\nby the tide, and we knew how to buy, for there would be no more till\r\nnext tide. Now, we don’t know. I go to Billingsgate to buy my fish,\r\nand am very well known to Mr. ---- and Mr. ---- (mentioning the names\r\nof some well-known salesmen). The Jews are my ruin there now. When I\r\ngo to Billingsgate, Mr. ---- will say, or rather, I will say to him,\r\n‘How much for this pad of soles?’ He will answer, ‘Fourteen shillings.’\r\n‘Fourteen shillings!’ I say, ‘I’ll give you seven shillings,--that’s\r\nthe proper amount;’ then the Jew boys--none of them twenty that are\r\nthere--ranged about will begin; and one says, when I bid 7_s._, ‘I’ll\r\ngive 8_s_;’ ‘nine,’ says another, close on my left; ‘ten,’ shouts\r\nanother, on my right, and so they go offering on; at last Mr. ----\r\nsays to one of them, as grave as a judge, ‘Yours, sir, at 13_s_,’\r\nbut it’s all gammon. The 13_s._ buyer isn’t a buyer at all, and isn’t\r\nrequired to pay a farthing, and never touches the goods. It’s all done\r\nto keep up the price to poor fishmen, and so to poor buyers that are\r\nour customers in the streets. Money makes money, and it don’t matter\r\nhow. Those Jew boys--I dare say they’re the same sort as once sold\r\noranges about the streets--are paid, I know 1_s._ for spending three\r\nor four hours that way in the cold and wet. My trade has been injured,\r\ntoo, by the great increase of Irish costermongers; for an Irishman will\r\nstarve out an Englishman any day; besides if a tailor can’t live by his\r\ntrade, he’ll take to fish, or fruit and cabbages. The month of May is a\r\nfine season for plaice, which is bought very largely by my customers.\r\nPlaice are sold at 1/2_d._ and 1_d._ a piece. It is a difficult fish\r\nto manage, and in poor neighbourhoods an important one to manage well.\r\nThe old hands make a profit out of it; new hands a loss. There’s not\r\nmuch cod or other wet fish sold to the poor, while plaice is in. My\r\ncustomers are poor men’s wives,--mechanics, I fancy. They want fish\r\nat most unreasonable prices. If I could go and pull them off a line\r\nflung off Waterloo-bridge, and no other expense, I couldn’t supply\r\nthem as cheap as they expect them. Very cheap fish-sellers lose their\r\ncustomers, through the Billingsgate bummarees, for they have pipes,\r\nand blow up the cod-fish, most of all, and puff up their bellies till\r\nthey are twice the size, but when it comes to table, there’s hardly to\r\nsay any fish at all. The Billingsgate authorities would soon stop it,\r\nif they knew all I know. They won’t allow any roguery, or any trick,\r\nif they only come to hear of it. These bummarees have caused many\r\nrespectable people to avoid street-buying, and so fair traders like me\r\nare injured. I’ve nothing to complain of about the police. Oft enough,\r\nif I could be allowed ten minutes longer on a Saturday night, I could\r\nget through all my stock without loss. About a quarter to twelve I\r\nbegin to halloo away as hard as I can, and there’s plenty of customers\r\nthat lay out never a farthing till that time, and then they can’t be\r\nserved fast enough, so they get their fish cheaper than I do. If any\r\nhalloos out that way sooner, we must all do the same. Anything rather\r\nthan keep fish over a warm Sunday. I have kept mine in ice; I haven’t\r\nopportunity now, but it’ll keep in a cool place this time of year. I\r\nthink there’s as many sellers as buyers in the streets, and there’s\r\nscores of them don’t give just weight or measure. I wish there was good\r\nmoral rules in force, and everybody gave proper weight. I often talk\r\nto street-dealers about it. I’ve given them many a lecture; but they\r\nsay they only do what plenty of shopkeepers do, and just get fined\r\nand go on again, without being a pin the worse thought of. They are\r\nabusive sometimes, too; I mean the street-sellers are, because they are\r\nignorant. I have no children, thank God, and my wife helps me in my\r\nbusiness. Take the year through, I clear from 10_s._ to 12_s._ every\r\nweek. That’s not much to support two people. Some weeks I earn only\r\n4_s._,--such as in wet March weather. In others I earn 18_s._ or 1_l._\r\nNovember, December, and January are good months for me. I wouldn’t\r\nmind if they lasted all the year round. I’m often very badly off\r\nindeed--very badly; and the misery of being hard up, sir, is not when\r\nyou’re making a struggle to get out of your trouble; no, nor to raise\r\na meal off herrings that you’ve given away once, but when your wife\r\nand you’s sitting by a grate without a fire, and putting the candle\r\nout to save it, a planning how to raise money. ‘Can we borrow there?’\r\n‘Can we manage to sell if we can borrow?’ ‘Shall we get from very bad\r\nto the parish?’ Then, perhaps, there’s a day lost, and without a bite\r\nin our mouths trying to borrow. Let alone a little drop to give a body\r\ncourage, which perhaps is the only good use of spirit after all. That’s\r\nthe pinch, sir. When the rain you hear outside puts you in mind of\r\ndrownding!”\r\n\r\nSubjoined is the amount (in round numbers) of wet fish annually\r\ndisposed of in the metropolis by the street-sellers:\r\n\r\n                           No. of Fish.      lbs. weight.\r\n  Salmon                         20,000           175,000\r\n  Live-cod                      100,000         1,000,000\r\n  Soles                       6,500,000         1,650,000\r\n  Whiting                     4,440,000         1,680,000\r\n  Haddock                       250,000           500,000\r\n  Plaice                     29,400,000        29,400,000\r\n  Mackarel                   15,700,000        15,700,000\r\n  Herrings                  875,000,000       210,000,000\r\n  Sprats                         „              3,000,000\r\n  Eels, from Holland            400,000            65,000\r\n  Flounders                     260,000            43,000\r\n  Dabs                          270,000            48,000\r\n                            -----------       -----------\r\n  Total quantity of    }\r\n  wet fish sold in the }    932,340,000       263,261,000\r\n  streets of London    }\r\n\r\nFrom the above Table we perceive that the fish, of which the greatest\r\nquantity is eaten by the poor, is herrings; of this, compared with\r\nplaice there is upwards of thirty times the number consumed. After\r\nplaice rank mackerel, and of these the consumption is about one-half\r\nless in number than plaice, while the number of soles vended in the\r\nstreets, is again half of that of mackerel. Then come whiting, which\r\nare about two-thirds the number of the soles, while the consumption\r\nto the poor of haddock, cod, eels, and salmon, is comparatively\r\ninsignificant. Of sprats, which are estimated by weight, only one-fifth\r\nof the number of pounds are consumed compared with the weight of\r\nmackerel. The pounds’ weight of herrings sold in the streets, in\r\nthe course of a year, is upwards of seven times that of plaice, and\r\nfourteen times that of mackerel. Altogether more than 260,000,000\r\npounds, or 116,000 tons weight of wet fish are yearly purchased in the\r\nstreets of London, for the consumption of the humbler classes. Of this\r\naggregate amount, no less than five-sixths consists of herrings; which,\r\nindeed, constitute the great slop diet of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SPRAT-SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nSprats--one of the cheapest and most grateful luxuries of the poor--are\r\ngenerally introduced about the 9th of November. Indeed “Lord Mayor’s\r\nday” is sometimes called “sprat day.” They continue in about ten weeks.\r\nThey are sold at Billingsgate by the “toss,” or “chuck,” which is about\r\nhalf a bushel, and weighs from 40lbs. to 50lbs. The price varies from\r\n1_s._ to 5_s._ Sprats are, this season, pronounced remarkably fine.\r\n“Look at my lot sir,” said a street-seller to me; “they’re a heap of\r\nnew silver,” and the bright shiny appearance of the glittering little\r\nfish made the comparison not inappropriate. In very few, if in any,\r\ninstances does a costermonger confine himself to the sale of sprats,\r\nunless his means limit him to that one branch of the business. A more\r\nprosperous street-fishmonger will sometimes detach the sprats from his\r\nstall, and his wife, or one of his children will take charge of them.\r\nOnly a few sprat-sellers are itinerant, the fish being usually sold\r\nby stationary street-sellers at “pitches.” One who worked his sprats\r\nthrough the streets, or sold them from a stall as he thought best, gave\r\nme the following account. He was dressed in a newish fustian-jacket,\r\nbuttoned close up his chest, but showing a portion of a clean cotton\r\nshirt at the neck, with a bright-coloured coarse handkerchief round\r\nit; the rest of his dress was covered by a white apron. His hair, as\r\nfar as I could see it under his cloth cap, was carefully brushed, and\r\n(it appeared) as carefully oiled. At the first glance I set him down\r\nas having been a gentleman’s servant. He had a somewhat deferential,\r\nthough far from cringing manner with him, and seemed to be about\r\ntwenty-five or twenty-six--he thought he was older, he said, but did\r\nnot know his age exactly.\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir,” he began, in a tone according with his look, “sprats _is_ a\r\nblessing to the poor. Fresh herrings is a blessing too, and sprats is\r\nyoung herrings, and is a blessing in ’portion” [for so he pronounced\r\nwhat seemed to be a favourite word with him “proportion”]. “It’s only\r\nfour years--yes, four, I’m sure of that--since I walked the streets\r\nstarving, in the depth of winter, and looked at the sprats, and said,\r\nI wish I could fill my belly off you. Sir, I hope it was no great sin,\r\nbut I could hardly keep my hands from stealing some and eating them\r\nraw. If they make me sick, thought I, the police’ll take care of me,\r\nand that’ll be something. While these thoughts was a passing through\r\nmy mind, I met a man who was a gentleman’s coachman; I knew him a\r\nlittle formerly, and so I stopped him and told him who I was, and that\r\nI hadn’t had a meal for two days. ‘Well, by G--,’ said the coachman,\r\n‘you look like it, why I shouldn’t have known you. Here’s a shilling.’\r\nAnd then he went on a little way, and then stopped, and turned back and\r\nthrust 3-1/2_d._ more into my hand, and bolted off. I’ve never seen him\r\nsince. But I’m grateful to him in the same ’portion (proportion) as if\r\nI had. After I’d had a penn’orth of bread and a penn’orth of cheese,\r\nand half-a-pint of beer, I felt a new man, and I went to the party as\r\nI’d longed to steal the sprats from, and told him what I’d thought\r\nof. I can’t say what made me tell him, but it turned out for good. I\r\ndon’t know much about religion, though I can read a little, but may\r\nbe that had something to do with it.” The rest of the man’s narrative\r\nwas--briefly told--as follows. He was the only child of a gentleman’s\r\ncoachman. His father had deserted his mother and him, and gone abroad,\r\nhe believed, with some family. His mother, however, took care of him\r\nuntil her death, which happened “when he was a little turned thirteen,\r\nhe had heard, but could not remember the year.” After that he was “a\r\nhelper and a jobber in different stables,” and “anybody’s boy,” for a\r\nfew years, until he got a footman’s, or rather footboy’s place, which\r\nhe kept above a year. After that he was in service, in and out of\r\ndifferent situations, until the time he specified, when he had been out\r\nof place for nearly five weeks, and was starving. His master had got in\r\ndifficulties, and had gone abroad; so he was left without a character.\r\n“Well, sir,” he continued, “the man as I wanted to steal the sprats\r\nfrom, says to me, says he, ‘Poor fellow; I know what a hempty belly is\r\nmyself--come and have a pint.’ And over that there pint, he told me,\r\nif I could rise 10_s._ there might be a chance for me in the streets,\r\nand he’d show me how to do. He died not very long after that, poor\r\nman. Well, after a little bit, I managed to borrow 10_s._ of Mr. ----\r\n(I thought of him all of a sudden). He was butler in a family that I\r\nhad lived in, and had a charitable character, though he was reckoned\r\nvery proud. But I plucked up a spirit, and told him how I was off, and\r\nhe said, ‘Well, I’ll try you,’ and he lent me 10_s._, which I paid\r\nhim back, little by little, in six or eight weeks; and so I started\r\nin the costermonger line, with the advice of my friend, and I’ve\r\nmade from 5_s._ to 10_s._, sometimes more, a week, at it ever since.\r\nThe police don’t trouble me much. They is civil to me in ’portion\r\n(proportion) as I am civil to them. I never mixed with the costers but\r\nwhen I’ve met them at market. I stay at a lodging-house, but it’s very\r\ndecent and clean, and I have a bed to myself, at 1_s._ a week, for\r\nI’m a regular man. I’m on sprats now, you see, sir, and you’d wonder,\r\nsometimes, to see how keen people looks to them when they’re new.\r\nThey’re a blessing to the poor, in ’portion (proportion) of course. Not\r\ntwenty minutes before you spoke to me, there was two poor women came\r\nup--they was sickly-looking, but I don’t know what they was--perhaps\r\nshirt-makers--and they says to me, says they, ‘Show us what a penny\r\nplateful is.’ ‘Sart’nly, ladies,’ says I. Then they whispered together,\r\nand at last one says, says she, ‘We’ll have two platefuls.’ I told you\r\nthey was a blessing to the poor, sir--’specially to such as them, as\r\nlives all the year round on bread and tea. But it’s not only the poor\r\nas buys; others in ’portion (proportion). When they’re new they’re a\r\ntreat to everybody. I’ve sold them to poor working-men, who’ve said,\r\n‘I’ll take a treat home to the old ’oman and the kids; they dotes on\r\nsprats.’ Gentlemen’s servants is very fond of them, and mechanics comes\r\ndown--such as shoemakers in their leather aprons, and sings out, ‘Here,\r\nold sprats, give us two penn’orth.’ They’re _such_ a relish. I sell\r\nmore to men than to women, perhaps, but there’s little difference.\r\nThey’re best stewed, sir, I think--if you’re fond of sprats--with\r\nvinegar and a pick of allspice; that’s my opinion, and, only yesterday,\r\nan old cook said I was right. I makes 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a day,\r\nand sometimes rather more, on my sprats, and sticks to them as much as\r\nI can. I sell about my ‘toss’ a day, seldom less. Of course I can make\r\nas many penn’orths of it as I please, but there’s no custom without one\r\ngives middling penn’orths. If a toss costs me 3_s._, I may make sixty\r\npenn’orths of it sometimes--sometimes seventy or more--and sometimes\r\nless than sixty. There’s many turns over as much as me and more than\r\nthat. I’m thinking that I’ll work the country with a lot; they’ll keep\r\nto a second day, when they’re fresh to start, ’specially if its frosty\r\nweather, too, and then they’re better than ever--yes, and a greater\r\ntreat--scalding hot from the fire, they’re the cheapest and best of all\r\nsuppers in the winter time. I hardly know which way I’ll go. If I can\r\nget anythink to do among horses in the country, I’ll never come back.\r\nI’ve no tie to London.”\r\n\r\nTo show how small a sum of money will enable the struggling striving\r\npoor to obtain a living, I may here mention that, in the course of\r\nmy inquiries among the mudlarks, I casually gave a poor shoeless\r\nurchin, who was spoken of by one of the City Missionaries as being a\r\nwell-disposed youth, 1_s._ out of the funds that had been entrusted\r\nto me to dispense. Trifling as the amount appears, it was the means\r\nof keeping his mother, sister, and himself through the winter. It was\r\ninvested in sprats, and turned over and over again.\r\n\r\nI am informed, by the best authorities, that near upon 1000 “tosses” of\r\nsprats are sold daily in London streets, while the season lasts. These,\r\nsold retail in pennyworths, at very nearly 5_s._ the toss, give about\r\n150_l._ a day, or say 1,000_l._ a week spent on sprats by the poorer\r\nclasses of the metropolis; so that, calculating the sprat season to\r\nlast ten weeks, about 10,000_l._ would be taken by the costermongers\r\nduring that time from the sale of this fish alone.\r\n\r\nAnother return, furnished me by an eminent salesman at Billingsgate,\r\nestimates the gross quantity of sprats sold by the London costers in\r\nthe course of the season at three millions of pounds weight, and this\r\ndisposed of at the rate of 1_d._ per pound, gives upwards of 12,000_l._\r\nfor the sum of money spent upon this one kind of fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SHELL-FISH SELLERS IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nI had the following account from an experienced man. He lived with\r\nhis mother, his wife, and four children, in one of the streets near\r\nGray’s-inn-lane. The street was inhabited altogether by people of\r\nhis class, the women looking sharply out when a stranger visited the\r\nplace. On my first visit to this man’s room, his wife, who is near her\r\nconfinement, was at dinner with her children. The time was 1/4 to 12.\r\nThe meal was tea, and bread with butter very thinly spread over it.\r\nOn the wife’s bread was a small piece of pickled pork, covering about\r\none-eighth of the slice of a quartern loaf cut through. In one corner\r\nof the room, which is on the ground-floor, was a scantily-covered bed.\r\nA few dingy-looking rags were hanging up to dry in the middle of the\r\nroom, which was littered with baskets and boxes, mixed up with old\r\nfurniture, so that it was a difficulty to stir. The room (although\r\nthe paper, covering the broken panes in the window, was torn and\r\nfull of holes) was most oppressively close and hot, and there was a\r\nfetid smell, difficult to sustain, though it was less noticeable on a\r\nsubsequent call. I have often had occasion to remark that the poor,\r\nespecially those who are much subjected to cold in the open air, will\r\nsacrifice much for heat. The adjoining room, which had no door, seemed\r\nlittered like the one where the family were. The walls of the room\r\nI was in were discoloured and weather-stained. The only attempt at\r\nornament was over the mantel-shelf, the wall here being papered with\r\nred and other gay-coloured papers, that once had been upholsterer’s\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nOn my second visit, the husband was at dinner with the family, on good\r\nboiled beef and potatoes. He was a small-featured man, with a head of\r\nvery curly and long black hair, and both in mien, manners, and dress,\r\nresembled the mechanic far more than the costermonger. He said:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve been twenty years and more, perhaps twenty-four, selling\r\nshell-fish in the streets. I was a boot-closer when I was young,\r\nand have made my 20_s._ and 30_s._, and sometimes 40_s._, and then\r\nsometimes not 10_s._ a week; but I had an attack of rheumatic-fever,\r\nand lost the use of my hands for my trade. The streets hadn’t any great\r\nname, as far as I knew, then, but as I couldn’t work, it was just a\r\nchoice between street-selling and starving, so I didn’t prefer the\r\nlast. It was reckoned degrading to go into the streets--but I couldn’t\r\nhelp that. I was astonished at my success when I first began, and\r\ngot into the business--that is into the understanding of it--after a\r\nweek, or two, or three. Why, I made 3_l._ the first week I knew my\r\ntrade, properly; yes, I cleared 3_l._! I made, not long after, 5_l._\r\na week--but not often. I was giddy and extravagant. Indeed, I was a\r\nfool, and spent my money like a fool. I could have brought up a family\r\nthen like a gentleman--I send them to school as it is--but I hadn’t\r\na wife and family then, or it might have been better; it’s a great\r\ncheck on a man, is a family. I began with shell-fish, and sell it\r\nstill; very seldom anything else. There’s more demand for shells, no\r\ndoubt, because its far cheaper, but then there’s so many more sellers.\r\nI don’t know why exactly. I suppose it’s because poor people go into\r\nthe streets when they can’t live other ways, and some do it because\r\nthey think it’s an idle life; but it ain’t. Where I took 35_s._ in a\r\nday at my stall--and well on to half of it profit--I now take 5_s._\r\nor 6_s._, or perhaps 7_s._, in the day and less profit on that less\r\nmoney. I don’t clear 3_s._ a day now, take the year through. I don’t\r\nkeep accounts, but I’m certain enough that I average about 15_s._ a\r\nweek the year through, and my wife has to help me to make that. She’ll\r\nmind the stall, while I take a round sometimes. I sell all kinds of\r\nshell-fish, but my great dependence is on winkles. I don’t do much in\r\nlobsters. Very few speculate in them. The price varies very greatly.\r\nWhat’s 10_s._ a score one day may be 25_s._ the next. I sometimes get\r\na score for 5_s._ or 6_s._, but it’s a poor trade, for 6_d._ is the\r\ntop of the tree, with me, for a price to a seller. I never get more.\r\nI sell them to mechanics and tradesmen. I do more in pound crabs.\r\nThere’s a great call for haporths and pennorths of lobster or crab,\r\nby children; that’s their claws. I bile them all myself, and buy them\r\nalive. I can bile twenty in half an hour, and do it over a grate in a\r\nback-yard. Lobsters don’t fight or struggle much in the hot water, if\r\nthey’re properly packed. It’s very few that knows how to bile a lobster\r\nas he should be biled. I wish I knew any way of killing lobsters\r\nbefore biling them. I can’t kill them without smashing them to bits,\r\nand that won’t do at all. I kill my crabs before I bile them. I stick\r\nthem in the throat with a knife and they’re dead in an instant. Some\r\nsticks them with a skewer, but they kick a good while with the skewer\r\nin them. It’s a shame to torture anything when it can be helped. If I\r\ndidn’t kill the crabs they’d shed every leg in the hot water; they’d\r\ncome out as bare of claws as this plate. I’ve known it oft enough, as\r\nit is; though I kill them uncommon quick, a crab will be quicker and\r\nshed every leg--throw them off in the moment I kill them, but that\r\ndoesn’t happen once in fifty times. Oysters are capital this season, I\r\nmean as to quality, but they’re not a good sale. I made 3_l._ a week in\r\noysters, not reckoning anything else, eighteen or twenty years back. It\r\nwas easy to make money then; like putting down one sovereign and taking\r\ntwo up. I sold oysters then oft enough at 1_d._ a piece. Now I sell far\r\nfiner at three a penny and five for 2_d._ People can’t spend money in\r\nshell-fish when they haven’t got any. They say that fortune knocks once\r\nat every man’s door. I wish I’d opened my door when he knocked at it.”\r\n\r\nThis man’s wife told me afterwards, that last winter, after an attack\r\nof rheumatism, all their stock-money was exhausted, and her husband\r\nsat day by day at home almost out of his mind; for nothing could tempt\r\nhim to apply to the parish, and “he would never have mentioned his\r\nsufferings to me,” she said; “he had too much pride.” The loan of a\r\nfew shillings from a poor costermonger enabled the man to go to market\r\nagain, or he and his family would now have been in the Union.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of shell-fish sold in the streets of London, the\r\nreturns before-cited give the following results:\r\n\r\n  Oysters       124,000,000\r\n  Lobsters           60,000\r\n  Crabs              50,000\r\n  Shrimps           770,000 pts.\r\n  Whelks          4,950,000\r\n  Mussels         1,000,000 qts.\r\n  Cockles           750,000 qts.\r\n  Periwinkles     3,640,000 pts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SHRIMP SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nShrimp selling, as I have stated, is one of the trades to which the\r\nstreet-dealer often confines himself throughout the year. The sale is\r\nabout equally divided between the two sexes, but the men do the most\r\nbusiness, walking some of them fifteen to twenty miles a day in a\r\n“round” of “ten miles there and ten back.”\r\n\r\nThe shrimps vended in the streets are the Yarmouth prawn shrimps,\r\nsold at Billingsgate at from 6_d._ to 10_d._ a gallon, while the best\r\nshrimps (chiefly from Lee, in Essex,) vary in price from 10_d._ to\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ a gallon; 2_s._ being a common price. The shrimps are\r\nusually mixed by the street-dealers, and they are cried, from stalls\r\nor on rounds, “a penny half-pint, fine fresh s’rimps.” (I heard them\r\ncalled nothing but “s’rimps” by the street-dealers.) The half-pint,\r\nhowever, is in reality but half that quantity. “It’s the same measure\r\nas it was thirty years back,” I was told, in a tone as if its antiquity\r\nremoved all imputation of unfair dealing. Some young men “do well on\r\ns’rimps,” sometimes taking 5_s._ in an hour on a Saturday evening,\r\n“when people get their money, and wants a relish.” The females in the\r\nshrimp line are the wives, widows, or daughters of costermongers. They\r\nare computed to average 1_s._ 6_d._ a day profit in fine, and from\r\n9_d._ to 1_s._ in bad weather; and, in snowy, or very severe weather,\r\nsometimes nothing at all.\r\n\r\nOne shrimp-seller, a middle-aged woman, wrapped up in a hybrid sort of\r\ncloak, that was half a man’s and half a woman’s garment, gave me the\r\nfollowing account. There was little vulgarity in either her language or\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“I was in the s’rimp trade since I was a girl. I don’t know how long.\r\nI don’t know how old I am. I never knew; but I’ve two children, one’s\r\nsix and t’other’s near eight, both girls; I’ve kept count of that as\r\nwell as I can. My husband sells fish in the street; so did father,\r\nbut he’s dead. We buried him without the help of the parish, as many\r\ngets--that’s something to say. I’ve known the trade every way. It never\r\nwas any good in public-houses. They want such great ha’p’orths there.\r\nThey’ll put up with what isn’t very fresh, to be sure, sometimes; and\r\ngood enough for them too, I say, as spoils their taste with drink.”\r\n[This was said very bitterly.] “If it wasn’t for my husband’s drinking\r\nfor a day together now and then we’d do better. He’s neither to have\r\nnor to hold when he’s the worse for liquor; and it’s the worse with\r\nhim, for he’s a quiet man when he’s his own man. Perhaps I make 9_d._ a\r\nday, perhaps 1_s._ or more. Sometimes my husband takes my stand, and I\r\ngo a round. Sometimes, if he gets through his fish, he goes my round.\r\nI give good measure, and my pint’s the regular s’rimp pint.” [It was\r\nthe _half_-pint I have described.] “The trade’s not so good as it was.\r\nPeople hasn’t the money, they tells me so. It’s bread before s’rimps,\r\nsays they. I’ve heard them say it very cross, if I’ve wanted hard to\r\nsell. Some days I can sell nothing. My children stays with my sister,\r\nwhen me and my old man’s out. They don’t go to school, but Jane (the\r\nsister) learns them to sew. She makes drawers for the slopsellers, but\r\nhas very little work, and gets very little for the little she does; she\r\nwould learn them to read if she knew how. She’s married to a pavior,\r\nthat’s away all day. It’s a hard life mine, sir. The winter’s a coming,\r\nand I’m now sometimes ’numbed with sitting at my stall in the cold.\r\nMy feet feels like lumps of ice in the winter; and they’re beginning\r\nnow, as if they weren’t my own. Standing’s far harder work than going\r\na round. I sell the best s’rimps. My customers is judges. If I’ve any\r\ns’rimps over on a night, as I often have one or two nights a week, I\r\nsells them for half-price to an Irishwoman, and she takes them to the\r\nbeer-shops, and the coffee-shops. She washes them to look fresh. I\r\ndon’t mind telling that, because people should buy of regular people.\r\nIt’s very few people know how to pick a s’rimp properly. You should\r\ntake it by the head and the tail and jam them up, and then the shell\r\nseparates, and the s’rimp comes out beautifully. That’s the proper way.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the sale on the rounds may be the same as that at the\r\nstalls, or 10 or 20 per cent. more or less, according to the weather,\r\nas shrimps can be sold by the itinerant dealers better than by the\r\nstall-keepers in wet weather, when people prefer buying at their doors.\r\nBut in hot weather the stall trade is the best, “for people often fancy\r\nthat the s’rimps is sent out to sell ’cause they’ll not keep no longer.\r\nIt’s only among customers as knows you, you can do any good on a round\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nThe costermongers sell annually, it appears, about 770,000 pints of\r\nshrimps. At 2_d._ a pint (a very low calculation) the street sale of\r\nshrimps amount to upwards of 6,400_l._ yearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORANGE MART, DUKE’S PLACE.--[_From a Daguerreotype by_\r\nBEARD.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF OYSTER SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe trade in oysters is unquestionably one of the oldest with which the\r\nLondon--or rather the English--markets are connected; for oysters from\r\nBritain were a luxury in ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nOysters are now sold out of the smacks at Billingsgate, and a few at\r\nHungerford. The more expensive kind such as the real Milton, are never\r\nbought by the costermongers, but they buy oysters of a “good middling\r\nquality.” At the commencement of the season these oysters are 14_s._\r\na “bushel,” but the measure contains from a bushel and a half to two\r\nbushels, as it is more or less heaped up. The general price, however,\r\nis 9_s._ or 10_s._, but they _have_ been 16_s._ and 18_s._ The “big\r\ntrade” was unknown until 1848, when the very large shelly oysters, the\r\nfish inside being very small, were introduced from the Sussex coast.\r\nThey were sold in Thames-street and by the Borough-market. Their sale\r\nwas at first enormous. The costermongers distinguished them by the name\r\nof “scuttle-mouths.” One coster informant told me that on the Saturdays\r\nhe not unfrequently, with the help of a boy and a girl, cleared 10_s._\r\nby selling these oysters in the streets, disposing of four bags. He\r\nthus sold, reckoning twenty-one dozen to the bag, 2,016 oysters; and\r\nas the price was two for a penny, he took just 4_l._ 4_s._ by the sale\r\nof oysters in the streets in one night. With the scuttle-mouths the\r\ncostermonger takes no trouble: he throws them into a yard, and dashes\r\na few pails of water over them, and then places them on his barrow, or\r\nconveys them to his stall. Some of the better class of costermongers,\r\nhowever, lay down their oysters carefully, giving them oatmeal “to\r\nfatten on.”\r\n\r\nIn April last, some of the street-sellers of this article established,\r\nfor the first time, “oyster-rounds.” These were carried on by\r\ncostermongers whose business was over at twelve in the day, or a little\r\nlater; they bought a bushel of scuttle-mouths (never the others), and,\r\nin the afternoon, went a round with them to poor neighbourhoods, until\r\nabout six, when they took a stand in some frequented street. Going\r\nthese oyster-rounds is hard work, I am told, and a boy is generally\r\ntaken to assist. Monday afternoon is the best time for this trade, when\r\n10_s._ is sometimes taken, and 4_s._ or 5_s._ profit made. On other\r\nevenings only from 1_s._ to 5_s._ is taken--very rarely the larger\r\nsum--as the later the day in the week the smaller is the receipt, owing\r\nto the wages of the working classes getting gradually exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe women who sell oysters in the street, and whose dealings are\r\nlimited, buy either of the costermongers or at the coal-sheds. But\r\nnearly all the men buy at Billingsgate, where as small a quantity as a\r\npeck can be had.\r\n\r\nAn old woman, who had “seen better days,” but had been reduced to keep\r\nan oyster-stall, gave me the following account of her customers. She\r\nshowed much shrewdness in her conversation, but having known better\r\ndays, she declined to enter upon any conversation concerning her\r\nformer life:--\r\n\r\n“As to my customers, sir,” she said, “why, indeed, they’re all sorts.\r\nIt’s not a very few times that gentlemen (I call them so because\r\nthey’re mostly so civil) will stop--just as it’s getting darkish,\r\nperhaps,--and look about them, and then come to me and say very quick:\r\n‘Two penn’orth for a whet.’ Ah! some of ’em will look, may be, like\r\npoor parsons down upon their luck, and swallow their oysters as if they\r\nwas taking poison in a hurry. They’ll not touch the bread or butter\r\nonce in twenty times, but they’ll be free with the pepper and vinegar,\r\nor, mayhap, they’ll say quick and short, ‘A crust off that.’ I many\r\na time think _that_ two penn’orth is a poor gentleman’s dinner. It’s\r\nthe same often--but only half as often, or not half--with a poor lady,\r\nwith a veil that once was black, over a bonnet to match, and shivering\r\nthrough her shawl. She’ll have the same. About two penn’orth is the\r\nmark still; it’s mostly two penn’orth. My son says, it’s because that’s\r\nthe price of a glass of gin, and some persons buy oysters instead--but\r\nthat’s only his joke, sir. It’s not the vulgar poor that’s our chief\r\ncustomers. There’s many of them won’t touch oysters, and I’ve heard\r\nsome of them say: ‘The sight on ’em makes me sick; it’s like eating\r\nsnails.’ The poor girls that walk the streets often buy; some are\r\nbrazen and vulgar, and often the finest dressed are the vulgarest; at\r\nleast, I think so; and of those that come to oyster stalls, I’m sure\r\nit’s the case. Some are shy to such as me, who may, perhaps, call their\r\nown mothers to their minds, though it aint many of them that is so.\r\nOne of them always says that she must keep at least a penny for gin\r\nafter her oysters. One young woman ran away from my stall once after\r\nswallowing one oyster out of six that she’d paid for. I don’t know\r\nwhy. Ah! there’s many things a person like me sees that one may say,\r\n‘I don’t know why’ to; that there is. My heartiest customers, that I\r\nserve with the most pleasure, are working people, on a Saturday night.\r\nOne couple--I think the wife always goes to meet her husband on a\r\nSaturday night--has two, or three, or four penn’orth, as happens, and\r\nit’s pleasant to hear them say, ‘Won’t you have another, John?’ or,\r\n‘Do have one or two more, Mary Anne.’ I’ve served them that way two or\r\nthree years. They’ve no children, I’m pretty sure, for if I say, ‘Take\r\na few home to the little ones,’ the wife tosses her head, and says,\r\nhalf vexed and half laughing, ‘_Such_ nonsense.’ I send out a good\r\nmany oysters, opened, for people’s suppers, and sometimes for supper\r\nparties--at least, I suppose so, for there’s five or six dozen often\r\nordered. The maid-servants come for them then, and I give them two or\r\nthree for themselves, and say, jokingly-like, ‘It’s no use offering you\r\nany, perhaps, because you’ll have plenty that’s left.’ They’ve mostly\r\none answer: ‘Don’t we wish we may get ’em?’ The _very_ poor never buy\r\nof me, as I told you. A penny buys a loaf, you see, or a ha’porth\r\nof bread and a ha’porth of cheese, or a half-pint of beer, with a\r\nfarthing out. My customers are mostly working people and tradespeople.\r\nAh! sir, I wish the parson of the parish, or any parson, sat with me a\r\nfortnight; he’d see what life is then. ‘It’s different,’ a learned man\r\nused to say to me--that’s long ago--‘from what’s noticed from the pew\r\nor the pulpit.’ I’ve missed the gentleman as used to say that, now many\r\nyears--I don’t know how many. I never knew his name. He was drunk now\r\nand then, and used to tell me he was an author. I felt for him. A dozen\r\noysters wasn’t much for him. We see a deal of the world, sir--yes, a\r\ndeal. Some, mostly working people, take quantities of pepper with their\r\noysters in cold weather, and say it’s to warm them, and no doubt it\r\ndoes; but frosty weather is very bad oyster weather. The oysters gape\r\nand die, and then they are not so much as manure. They are very fine\r\nthis year. I clear 1_s._ a day, I think, during the season--at least\r\n1_s._, taking the fine with the wet days, and the week days with the\r\nSundays, though I’m not out then; but, you see, I’m known about here.”\r\n\r\nThe number of oysters sold by the costermongers amounts to 124,000,000\r\na year. These, at four a penny, would realise the large sum of\r\n129,650_l._ We may therefore safely assume that 125,000_l._ is spent\r\nyearly in oysters in the streets of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF PERIWINKLE SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThere are some street people who, nearly all the year through, sell\r\nnothing but periwinkles, and go regular rounds, where they are well\r\nknown. The “wink” men, as these periwinkle sellers are called,\r\ngenerally live in the lowest parts, and many in lodging-houses. They\r\nare forced to live in low localities, they say, because of the smell\r\nof the fish, which is objected to. The city district is ordinarily the\r\nbest for winkle-sellers, for there are not so many cheap shops there\r\nas in other parts. The summer is the best season, and the sellers then\r\nmake, upon the average, 12_s._ a week clear profit; in the winter,\r\nthey get upon the average, 5_s._ a week clear, by selling mussels and\r\nwhelks--for, as winkles last only from March till October, they are\r\nthen obliged to do what they can in the whelk and mussel way. “I buy\r\nmy winks,” said one, “at Billingsgate, at 3_s._ and 4_s._ the wash.\r\nA wash is about a bushel. There’s some at 2_s._, and some sometimes\r\nas low as 1_s._ the wash, but they wouldn’t do for me, as I serve\r\nvery respectable people. If we choose we can boil our winkles at\r\nBillingsgate by paying 4_d._ a week for boiling, and 1/2_d._ for salt,\r\nto salt them after they are boiled. Tradesmen’s families buy them for a\r\nrelish to their tea. It’s reckoned a nice present from a young man to\r\nhis sweetheart, is winks. Servant girls are pretty good customers, and\r\nwant them cheaper when they say it’s for themselves; but I have only\r\none price.”\r\n\r\nOne man told me he could make as much as 12_s._ a week--sometimes more\r\nand sometimes less.\r\n\r\nHe made no speeches, but sung--“Winketty-winketty-wink-wink-wink--\r\nwink-wink--wicketty-wicketty-wink--fine fresh winketty-winks wink wink.”\r\nHe was often so sore in the stomach and hoarse with hallooing that\r\nhe could hardly speak. He had no child, only himself and wife to keep\r\nout of his earnings. His room was 2_s._ a week rent. He managed to get\r\na bit of meat every day, he said, “somehow or ’nother.”\r\n\r\nAnother, more communicative and far more intelligent man, said to me\r\nconcerning the character of his customers: “They’re people I think\r\nthat like to daddle” (dawdle, I presume) “over their teas or such\r\nlike; or when a young woman’s young man takes tea with her mother and\r\nher, then they’ve winks; and then there’s joking, and helping to pick\r\nwinks, between Thomas and Betsy, while the mother’s busy with her\r\ntea, or is wiping her specs, ’cause she _can’t_ see. Why, sir, I’ve\r\nknown it! I was a Thomas that way myself when I was a tradesman. I was\r\na patten-maker once, but pattens is no go now, and hasn’t been for\r\nfifteen year or more. Old people, I think, that lives by themselves,\r\nand has perhaps an annuity or the like of that, and nothing to do\r\npertickler, loves winks, for they likes a pleasant way of making time\r\nlong over a meal. They’re the people as reads a newspaper, when it’s a\r\nweek old, all through. The other buyers, I think, are tradespeople or\r\nworking-people what wants a relish. But winks is a bad trade now, and\r\nso is many that depends on relishes.”\r\n\r\nOne man who “works” the New Cut, has the “best wink business of all.”\r\nHe sells only a little dry fish with his winks, never wet fish, and\r\nhas “got his name up,” for the superiority of that shell-fish--a\r\nsuperiority which he is careful to ensure. He pays 8_s._ a week for\r\na stand by a grocer’s window. On an ordinary afternoon he sells from\r\n7_s._ to 10_s._ worth of periwinkles. On a Monday afternoon he often\r\ntakes 20_s._; and on the Sunday afternoon 3_l._ and 4_l._ He has two\r\ncoster lads to help him, and sometimes on a Sunday from twenty to\r\nthirty customers about him. He wraps each parcel sold in a neat brown\r\npaper bag, which, I am assured, is of itself, an inducement to buy of\r\nhim. The “unfortunate” women who live in the streets contiguous to the\r\nWaterloo, Blackfriars, and Borough-roads, are among his best customers,\r\non Sundays especially. He is rather a public character, getting up\r\ndances and the like. “_He_ aint bothered--not he--with ha’p’orths or\r\npenn’orths of a Sunday,” said a person who had assisted him. “It’s\r\nthe top of the tree with his customers; 3_d._ or 6_d._ at a go.” The\r\nreceipts are one-half profit. I heard from several that he was “the\r\nbest man for winks a-going.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of periwinkles disposed of by the London street-sellers\r\nis 3,600,000 pints, which, at 1_d._ per pint, gives the large sum\r\nof 15,000_l._ expended annually in this street luxury. It should be\r\nremembered, that a very large consumption of periwinkles takes place\r\nin public-houses and suburban tea-gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “DRY” FISH SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe dealing in “dry” or salt fish is never carried on as a totally\r\ndistinct trade in the streets, but some make it a principal part of\r\ntheir business; and many wet fish-dealers whose “wet fish” is disposed\r\nof by noon, sell dry fish in the afternoon. The dry fish, proper,\r\nconsists of dried mackerel, salt cod--dried or barrelled--smoked or\r\ndried haddocks (often called “finnie haddies”), dried or pickled salmon\r\n(but salmon is only salted or pickled for the streets when it can be\r\nsold cheap), and salt herrings.\r\n\r\nA keen-looking, tidily-dressed man, who was at one time a dry\r\nfish-seller principally, gave me the following account. For the last\r\ntwo months he has confined himself to another branch of the business,\r\nand seemed to feel a sort of pleasure in telling of the “dodges” he\r\nonce resorted to:\r\n\r\n“There’s Scotch haddies that never knew anything about Scotland,” he\r\nsaid, “for I’ve made lots of them myself by Tower-street, just a jump\r\nor two from the Lambeth station-house. I used to make them on Sundays.\r\nI was a wet fish-seller then, and when I couldn’t get through my\r\nhaddocks or my whitings of a Saturday night, I wasn’t a-going to give\r\nthem away to folks that wouldn’t take the trouble to lift me out of\r\na gutter if I fell there, so I presarved them. I’ve made haddies of\r\nwhitings, and good ones too, and Joe made them of codlings besides. I\r\nhad a bit of a back-yard to two rooms, one over the other, that I had\r\nthen, and on a Sunday I set some wet wood a fire, and put it under a\r\ngreat tub. My children used to gut and wash the fish, and I hung them\r\non hooks all round the sides of the tub, and made a bit of a chimney\r\nin a corner of the top of the tub, and that way I gave them a jolly\r\ngood smoking. My wife had a dry fish-stall and sold them, and used\r\nto sing out ‘Real Scotch haddies,’ and tell people how they was from\r\nAberdeen; I’ve often been fit to laugh, she did it so clever. I had a\r\nway of giving them a yellow colour like the real Scotch, but that’s a\r\nsecret. After they was well smoked they was hung up to dry all round\r\nthe rooms we lived in, and we often had stunning fires that answered\r\nas well to boil crabs and lobsters when they was cheap enough for the\r\nstreets. I’ve boiled a mate’s crabs and lobsters for 2-1/2_d._; it was\r\ntwo boilings and more, and 2-1/2_d._ was reckoned the price of half\r\na quarter of a hundred of coals and the use of the pan. There’s more\r\nways than one of making 6_d._, if a man has eyes in his head and keeps\r\nthem open. Haddocks that wouldn’t fetch 1_d._ a piece, nor any money\r\nat all of a Saturday night, I’ve sold--at least she has” (indicating\r\nhis wife by a motion of his thumb)--“at 2_d._, and 3_d._, and 4_d._\r\nI’ve bought fish of costers that was over on a Saturday night, to make\r\nScotch haddies of them. I’ve tried experience” (experiments) “too.\r\nIvy, burnt under them, gave them, I thought, a nice sort of flavour,\r\nrather peppery, for I used always to taste them; but I hate living\r\non fish. Ivy with brown berries on it, as it has about this time o’\r\nyear, I liked best. Holly wasn’t no good. A black-currant bush was,\r\nbut it’s too dear; and indeed it couldn’t be had. I mostly spread\r\nwetted fire-wood, as green as could be got, or damp sticks of any kind,\r\nover shavings, and kept feeding the fire. Sometimes I burnt sawdust.\r\nSomehow, the dry fish trade fell off. People does get so prying and so\r\nknowing, there’s no doing nothing now for no time, so I dropped the\r\ndry fish trade. There’s few up to smoking them proper; they smoke ’em\r\nblack, as if they was hung up in a chimbley.”\r\n\r\nAnother costermonger gave me the following account:\r\n\r\n“I’ve salted herrings, but the commonest way of salting is by the Jews\r\nabout Whitechapel. They make real Yarmouth bloaters and all sorts\r\nof fish. When I salted herrings, I bought them out of the boats at\r\nBillingsgate by the hundred, which is 120 fish. We give them a bit of\r\na clean--hardly anything--then chuck them into a tub of salt, and keep\r\nscattering salt over them, and let them lie a few minutes, or sometimes\r\nhalf an hour, and then hang them up to dry. They eat well enough, if\r\nthey’re eaten in time, for they won’t keep. I’ve known three day’s\r\nold herrings salted, just because there was no sale for them. One Jew\r\nsends out six boys crying ‘real Yarmouth bloaters.’ People buy them\r\nin preference, they look so nice and clean and fresh-coloured. It’s\r\nquite a new trade among the Jews. They didn’t do much that way until\r\ntwo years back. I sometimes wish I was a Jew, because they help one\r\nanother, and start one another with money, and so they thrive where\r\nChristians are ruined. I smoked mackerel, too, by thousands; that’s a\r\nnew trade, and is done the same way as haddocks. Mackerel that won’t\r\nbring 1_d._ a piece fresh, bring 2_d._ smoked; they are very nice\r\nindeed. I make about 10_s._ or 11_s._ a week by dry fish in the winter\r\nmonths, and about as much by wet,--but I have a tidy connection.\r\nPerhaps I make 17_s._ or 18_s._ a week all the year round.”\r\n\r\nThe aggregate quantity of dry fish sold by the London costermongers\r\nthroughout the year is as follows--the results being deduced from the\r\ntable before given:\r\n\r\n  Wet salt cod                           93,750\r\n  Dry    do.                          1,000,000\r\n  Smoked Haddocks                     4,875,000\r\n  Bloaters                           36,750,000\r\n  Red-herrings                       25,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS VALUE OF THE SEVERAL KINDS OF FISH ANNUALLY SOLD IN THE STREETS\r\nOF LONDON.\r\n\r\nIt now but remains for me, in order to complete this account of the\r\n“street-sellers of fish,” to form an estimate of the amount of money\r\nannually expended by the labourers and the poorer classes of London\r\nupon the different kinds of wet, dry, and shell-fish. This, according\r\nto the best authorities, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                      _Wet Fish._                         £\r\n      175,000 lbs. of salmon, at 6_d._ per lb.            4,000\r\n    1,000,000 lbs. of live cod, at 1-1/2_d._ per lb.      5,000\r\n    3,250,000 pairs of soles, at 1-1/2_d._ per pair      20,000\r\n    4,400,000 whiting, at 1/2_d._ each                    9,000\r\n   29,400,000 plaice, at 3/4_d._                         90,000\r\n   15,700,000 mackarel, at 6 for 1_s._                  130,000\r\n  875,000,000 herrings, at 16 a groat                   900,000\r\n    3,000,000 lbs. of sprats, at 1_d._ per lb.           12,000\r\n      400,000 lbs. of eels, at 3 lb. for 1_s._            6,000\r\n      260,000 flounders, at 1_d._ per dozen                 100\r\n      270,000 dabs, at 1_d._ per dozen                      100\r\n                                                      ---------\r\n  Sum total expended yearly in wet fish               1,177,000\r\n\r\n                      _Dry Fish._\r\n     525,000 lbs. barrelled cod, at 1-1/2_d._             3,000\r\n     500,000 lbs. dried salt cod, at 2_d._                4,000\r\n   4,875,000 smoked haddock, at 1_d._                    20,000\r\n  36,750,000 bloaters, at 2 for 1_d._                    75,000\r\n  25,000,000 red herrings, at 4 for 1_d._                25,000\r\n                                                        -------\r\n  Sum total expended yearly in dry fish                 127,000\r\n\r\n                      _Shell Fish._\r\n  124,000,000 oysters, at 4 a penny                     125,000\r\n       60,000 lobsters, at 3_d._                            750\r\n       50,000 crabs, at 2_d._                               400\r\n      770,000 pints of shrimps, at 2_d._                  6,000\r\n    1,000,000 quarts of mussels, at 1_d._                 4,000\r\n      750,000 quarts of cockles, at 1_d._                 3,000\r\n    4,950,000 whelks, at 8 for 1_d._                      2,500\r\n    3,600,000 pints of periwinkles, at 1_d._             15,000\r\n                                                        -------\r\n  Sum total expended yearly in shell-fish               156,650\r\n\r\nAdding together the above totals, we have the following result as\r\nto the gross money value of the fish purchased yearly in the London\r\nstreets:\r\n\r\n                            £\r\n  Wet fish              1,177,200\r\n  Dry fish                127,000\r\n  Shell fish              156,650\r\n                        ---------\r\n          Total        £1,460,850\r\n\r\nHence we find that there is nearly a million and a half of money\r\nannually spent by the poorer classes of the metropolis in fish; a sum\r\nso prodigious as almost to discredit every statement of want, even if\r\nthe amount said to be so expended be believed. The returns from which\r\nthe above account is made out have been obtained, however, from such\r\nunquestionable sources--not from one salesman alone, but checked and\r\ncorrected by many gentlemen who can have no conceivable motive for\r\nexaggeration either one way or the other--that, sceptical as our utter\r\nignorance of the subject must necessarily make us, still if we will\r\nbut examine for ourselves, we shall find there is no gainsaying the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nMoreover as to the enormity of the amount dispelling all ideas of\r\nprivation among the industrious portion of the community, we shall also\r\nfind on examination that assuming the working-men of the metropolis to\r\nbe 500,000 in number (the Occupation Abstract of 1841, gives 773,560\r\nindividuals following _some_ employment in London, but these include\r\nmerchants, employers, shopkeepers, Government-officers and others),\r\nand that they, with their wives and children, make up one million\r\nindividuals, it follows that the sum per head, expended in fish by the\r\npoorer classes every week, is a fraction more than 6-3/4_d._, or, in\r\nother words not quite one penny a day.\r\n\r\nIf the diet of a people be a criterion, as has been asserted, of their\r\ncharacter, it may be feared that the present extensive fish-diet of the\r\nworking-people of London, is as indicative of degeneracy of character,\r\nas Cobbett insisted must result from the consumption of tea, and “the\r\ncursed root,” the potato. “The flesh of fish,” says Pereira on Diet,\r\n“is less satisfying than the flesh of either quadrupeds or birds. As\r\nit contains a larger proportion of water (about 80 per cent.), it is\r\nobviously less nourishing.” Haller tells us he found himself weakened\r\nby a fish-diet; and he states that Roman Catholics are generally\r\ndebilitated during Lent. Pechlin also affirms that a mechanic,\r\nnourished merely by fish, has less muscular power than one who lives on\r\nthe flesh of warm-blooded animals. Jockeys, who _waste themselves_ in\r\norder to reduce their weight, live principally on fish.\r\n\r\nThe classes of fish above given, are, when considered in a “dietetical\r\npoint of view,” of two distinct kinds; viz., those which form the\r\nstaple commodity of the dinners and suppers of the poor, and those\r\nwhich are mere relishes or stimuli to failing, rather than stays\r\nto, eager appetites. Under the former head, I include red-herrings,\r\nbloaters, and smoked haddocks; such things are not merely provocatives\r\nto eat, among the poor, as they are at the breakfast-table of many an\r\nover-fed or intemperate man. With the less affluent these salted fish\r\nare not a “relish,” but a meal.\r\n\r\nThe shell-fish, however, can only be considered as luxuries. The\r\n150,000_l._ thus annually expended in the streets, represents the sum\r\nlaid out in mere relishes or stimuli to sluggish appetites. A very\r\nlarge proportion of this amount, I am inclined to believe, is spent by\r\npersons whose stomachs have been disordered by drink. A considerable\r\npart of the trade in the minor articles, as winks, shrimps, &c.,\r\nis carried on in public-houses, while a favourite pitch for an\r\noyster-stall is outside a tavern-door. If, then, so large an amount is\r\nlaid out in an endeavour to restore the appetite after drinking, how\r\nmuch money must be squandered in destroying it by the same means?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE KINDS AND QUANTITY OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES SOLD IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of fruit sold in the streets--“green fruit” and\r\n“dry fruit.”\r\n\r\nIn commerce, all fruit which is edible as it is taken from the tree or\r\nthe ground, is known as “green.” A subdivision of this green fruit is\r\ninto “fresh” or “tender” fruit, which includes currants, gooseberries,\r\nstrawberries, and, indeed, all fruits that demand immediate\r\nconsumption, in contradistinction to such productions as nuts which\r\nmay be kept without injury for a season. All fruit which is “cured”\r\nis known as “dry” fruit. In summer the costers vend “green fruit,”\r\nand in the winter months, or in the early spring, when the dearness\r\nor insufficiency of the supply of green fruit renders it unsuited for\r\ntheir traffic, they resort, but not extensively, to “dry fruit.” It is\r\nprincipally, however, when an abundant season, or the impossibility of\r\nkeeping the dry fruit much longer, has tended to reduce the price of\r\nit, that the costlier articles are to be found on the costermonger’s\r\nbarrow.\r\n\r\nFruit is, for the most part, displayed on barrows, by the\r\nstreet-dealers in it. Some who supply the better sort of houses--more\r\nespecially those in the suburbs--carry such things as apples and plums,\r\nin clean round wicker-baskets, holding pecks or half-pecks.\r\n\r\nThe commoner “green” fruits of home produce are bought by the\r\ncostermonger in the markets. The foreign green fruit, as pine-apples,\r\nmelons, grapes, chestnuts, coker-nuts, Brazil-nuts, hazel-nuts, and\r\noranges, are purchased by them at the public sales of the brokers, and\r\nof the Jews in Duke’s-place. The more intelligent and thrifty of the\r\ncosters buy at the public sales on the principle of association, as I\r\nhave elsewhere described. Some costermongers expend as much as 20_l._\r\nat a time in such green fruit, or dry fruit, as is not immediately\r\nperishable, at a public sale, or at a fruit-warehouse, and supply the\r\nother costers.\r\n\r\nThe regular costermongers seldom deal in oranges and chestnuts. If\r\nthey sell walnuts, they reserve these, they say, for their Sunday\r\nafternoon’s pastime. The people who carry oranges, chestnuts, or\r\nwalnuts, or Spanish nuts about the town, are not considered as\r\ncostermongers, but are generally, though not always, classed, by\r\nthe regular men, with the watercress-women, the sprat-women, the\r\nwinkle-dealers, and such others, whom they consider beneath them. The\r\norange season is called by the costermonger the “Irishman’s harvest.”\r\nIndeed, the street trade in oranges and nuts is almost entirely in\r\nthe hands of the Irish and their children; and of the children of\r\ncostermongers. The costers themselves would rather starve--and do\r\nstarve now and then--than condescend to it. The trade in coker-nuts is\r\ncarried on greatly by the Jews on Sundays, and by young men and boys\r\nwho are not on other days employed as street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe usual kinds of fruit the regular costers deal in are strawberries,\r\nraspberries (plain and stalked), cherries, apricots, plums,\r\ngreen-gages, currants, apples, pears, damsons, green and ripe\r\ngooseberries, and pine-apples. They also deal in vegetables, such\r\nas turnips, greens, brocoli, carrots, onions, celery, rhubarb, new\r\npotatoes, peas, beans (French and scarlet, broad and Windsor),\r\nasparagus, vegetable marrow, seakale, spinach, lettuces, small\r\nsalads, radishes, etc. Their fruit and vegetables they usually buy at\r\nCovent-garden, Spitalfields, or the Borough markets. Occasionally they\r\nbuy some at Farringdon, but this they reckon to be very little better\r\nthan a “haggler’s market,”--a “haggler” being, as I before explained,\r\nthe middle-man who attends in the fruit and vegetable-markets, and buys\r\nof the salesman to sell again to the retail dealer or costermonger.\r\n\r\nConcerning the quantity of fruit and vegetables sold in the streets,\r\nby the London costermongers. This, as I said, when treating of the\r\nstreet-trade in fish, can only be arrived at by ascertaining the entire\r\nquantity sold wholesale at the London markets, and then learning\r\nfrom the best authorities the proportion retailed in the public\r\nthoroughfares. Fully to elucidate this matter, both as to the extent of\r\nthe metropolitan supply of vegetables and fruit, (“foreign” as well as\r\n“home-grown,” and “green” as well as “dry”) and the relative quantity\r\nof each, vended through the agency of the costermongers, I caused\r\ninquiries to be instituted at all the principal markets and brokers\r\n(for not even the vaguest return on the subject had, till then, been\r\nprepared), and received from all the gentlemen connected therewith,\r\nevery assistance and information, as I have here great pleasure in\r\nacknowledging.\r\n\r\nTo carry out my present inquiry, I need not give returns of the\r\narticles _not_ sold by the costermongers, nor is it necessary for me to\r\ncite any but those dealt in by them generally. Their exceptional sales,\r\nsuch as of mushrooms, cucumbers, &c., are not included here.\r\n\r\nThe following Table shows the ordinary annual supply of _home grown\r\nfruit_ (nearly all produced within a radius of twelve miles from the\r\nBank) to each of the London “green” markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n A TABLE SHOWING THE QUANTITY OR MEASURE OF THE UNDERMENTIONED\r\n HOME-GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SOLD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHOLESALE,\r\n IN THE METROPOLITAN “GREEN” MARKETS, WITH THE PROPORTION SOLD RETAIL\r\n IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\n    Description of\r\n  Fruits and Vegetables.

The currants, I am\r\ninformed, are one-fifteenth foreign. The foreign “tender” fruit being\r\nsent to the markets, it is impossible to obtain separate returns.\r\n\r\n[4] A common sale of strawberries in the markets is “rounds.” I have,\r\nhowever, given the quantity thus sold less technically, and in the\r\nmeasures most familiar to the general public.\r\n\r\n[5] The cabbages, turnips, &c. are brought in loads to the great\r\nwholesale markets, a load varying from 150 to 200 dozen, but being\r\nmore frequently nearer 200, and not unfrequently to fully that amount.\r\nNot to perplex my reader with too great a multiplicity of figures\r\nin a tabular arrangement, I have given the quantity of individual\r\narticles in a load, without specifying it. In the smaller market (for\r\nvegetables) of Portman, the cabbages, &c., are not conveyed in waggons,\r\nas to the other markets, but in carts containing generally sixty\r\ndozens.\r\n\r\nThe various proportions of the several kinds of fruit and vegetables\r\nsold by the costermongers are here calculated for _all_ the markets,\r\nfrom returns which have been obtained from each market separately.\r\nTo avoid unnecessary detail, however, these several items are lumped\r\ntogether, and the aggregate proportion above given.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Table, however, relates chiefly to “home grown” supplies.\r\nConcerning the quantity of foreign fruit and vegetables imported into\r\nthis country, the proportion consumed in London, and the relative\r\namount sold by the costers, I have obtained the following returns:--\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE, SHOWING THE QUANTITY OR MEASURE OF THE UNDERMENTIONED FOREIGN\r\n GREEN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SOLD WHOLESALE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN\r\n LONDON, WITH THE PROPORTION SOLD RETAIL IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------\r\n                 | Quantity sold  | Proportion sold\r\n   Description.  |  wholesale in  |  retail in\r\n                 |    London.     |  the streets.\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------\r\n     FRUIT.      |                |\r\n  Apples         | 39,561 bush.   | seven-eighths.\r\n  Pears          | 19,742   „     | seven-eighths.\r\n  Cherries       | 264,240 lbs.   | two-thirds.\r\n  Grapes         | 1,328,190 „    | one-fiftieth.\r\n  Pine-apples    | 200,000 fruit  | one-tenth.\r\n  Oranges        | 61,635,146 „   | one-fourth.\r\n  Lemons         | 15,408,789 „   | one-hundredth.\r\n                 |                |\r\n     NUTS.       |                |\r\n  Spanish Nuts } | 72,509 bush.   | one-third.\r\n  Barcelona „  } |                |\r\n  Brazil    „    | 11,700   „     | one-fourth.\r\n  Chestnuts      | 26,250   „     | one-fourth.\r\n  Walnuts        | 36,088   „     | two-thirds.\r\n  “Coker”-nuts   | 1,255,000 nuts | one-third.\r\n                 |                |\r\n   VEGETABLES.   |                |\r\n  Potatoes       | 79,654,400 lbs.| one-half.\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the entire metropolitan supply of the principal\r\nvegetables and green fruit (both home grown and foreign), as well\r\nas the relative quantity “distributed” throughout London by the\r\ncostermongers; it now but remains for me, in order to complete the\r\naccount, to do the same for “the dry fruit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE, SHOWING THE QUANTITY OF “DRY” FRUIT SOLD WHOLESALE IN LONDON\r\n THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WITH THE PROPORTION SOLD RETAIL IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------------\r\n                 | Quantity sold  | Proportion sold retail\r\n   Description.  |   wholesale    |    in the streets.\r\n                 |  in London.    |\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------------\r\n  Shell Almonds  |  12,500 cwt.   | half per cent.\r\n  Raisins        | 135,000  „     | quarter per cent.\r\n  Currants       | 250,000  „     | none.\r\n  Figs           |  21,700  „     | one per cent.\r\n  Prunes         |  15,000  „     | quarter per cent.\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SEASON OF THE COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry season begins about June, and continues till about the\r\nmiddle of July. From the middle to the end of July the costers “work”\r\nraspberries. During July cherries are “in” as well as raspberries; but\r\nmany costers prefer working raspberries, because “they’re a quicker\r\nsixpence.” After the cherries, they go to work upon plums, which they\r\nhave about the end of August. Apples and pears come in after the plums\r\nin the month of September, and the apples last them all through the\r\nwinter till the month of May. The pears last only till Christmas.\r\nCurrants they work about the latter end of July, or beginning of August.\r\n\r\nConcerning the costermonger’s vegetable season, it may be said that\r\nhe “works” greens during the winter months, up to about March; from\r\nthat time they are getting “leathery,” the leaves become foxy, I was\r\ntold, and they eat tough when boiled. The costers generally do not like\r\ndealing either in greens or turnips, “they are such heavy luggage,”\r\nthey say. They would sooner “work” green peas and new potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger, however, does the best at fruit; but this he cannot\r\nwork--with the exception of apples--for more than four months in the\r\nyear. They lose but little from the fruit spoiling. “If it doesn’t\r\nfetch a good price, it must fetch a bad one,” they say; but they are\r\nnever at a great loss by it. They find the “ladies” their hardest\r\nor “scaliest” customers. Whatever price they ask, they declare the\r\n“ladies” will try to save the market or “gin” penny out of it, so that\r\nthey may have “a glass of something short” before they go home.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF COVENT GARDEN MARKET.\r\n\r\nOn a Saturday--the coster’s business day--it is computed that as many\r\nas 2,000 donkey-barrows, and upwards of 3,000 women with shallows and\r\nhead-baskets visit this market during the forenoon. About six o’clock\r\nin the morning is the best time for viewing the wonderful restlessness\r\nof the place, for then not only is the “Garden” itself all bustle and\r\nactivity, but the buyers and sellers stream to and from it in all\r\ndirections, filling every street in the vicinity. From Long Acre to\r\nthe Strand on the one side, and from Bow-street to Bedford-street on\r\nthe other, the ground has been seized upon by the market-goers. As you\r\nglance down any one of the neighbouring streets, the long rows of carts\r\nand donkey-barrows seem interminable in the distance. They are of all\r\nkinds, from the greengrocer’s taxed cart to the coster’s barrow--from\r\nthe showy excursion-van to the rude square donkey-cart and bricklayer’s\r\ntruck. In every street they are ranged down the middle and by the\r\nkerb-stones. Along each approach to the market, too, nothing is to be\r\nseen, on all sides, but vegetables; the pavement is covered with heaps\r\nof them waiting to be carted; the flagstones are stained green with\r\nthe leaves trodden under foot; sieves and sacks full of apples and\r\npotatoes, and bundles of brocoli and rhubarb, are left unwatched upon\r\nalmost every door-step; the steps of Covent Garden Theatre are covered\r\nwith fruit and vegetables; the road is blocked up with mountains of\r\ncabbages and turnips; and men and women push past with their arms bowed\r\nout by the cauliflowers under them, or the red tips of carrots pointing\r\nfrom their crammed aprons, or else their faces are red with the weight\r\nof the loaded head-basket.\r\n\r\nThe donkey-barrows, from their number and singularity, force you to\r\nstop and notice them. Every kind of ingenuity has been exercised to\r\nconstruct harness for the costers’ steeds; where a buckle is wanting,\r\ntape or string make the fastening secure; traces are made of rope and\r\nold chain, and an old sack or cotton handkerchief is folded up as a\r\nsaddle-pad. Some few of the barrows make a magnificent exception,\r\nand are gay with bright brass; while one of the donkeys may be seen\r\ndressed in a suit of old plated carriage-harness, decorated with\r\ncoronets in all directions. At some one of the coster conveyances\r\nstands the proprietor, arranging his goods, the dozing animal starting\r\nup from its sleep each time a heavy basket is hoisted on the tray.\r\nOthers, with their green and white and red load neatly arranged, are\r\nready for starting, but the coster is finishing his breakfast at the\r\ncoffee-stall. On one barrow there may occasionally be seen a solitary\r\nsieve of apples, with the horse of some neighbouring cart helping\r\nhimself to the pippins while the owner is away. The men that take\r\ncharge of the trucks, whilst the costers visit the market, walk about,\r\nwith their arms full of whips and sticks. At one corner a donkey has\r\nslipped down, and lies on the stones covered with the cabbages and\r\napples that have fallen from the cart.\r\n\r\nThe market itself presents a beautiful scene. In the clear morning air\r\nof an autumn day the whole of the vast square is distinctly seen from\r\none end to the other. The sky is red and golden with the newly-risen\r\nsun, and the rays falling on the fresh and vivid colours of the fruit\r\nand vegetables, brightens up the picture as with a coat of varnish.\r\nThere is no shouting, as at other markets, but a low murmuring hum\r\nis heard, like the sound of the sea at a distance, and through each\r\nentrance to the market the crowd sweeps by. Under the dark Piazza\r\nlittle bright dots of gas-lights are seen burning in the shops; and\r\nin the paved square the people pass and cross each other in all\r\ndirections, hampers clash together, and excepting the carters from the\r\ncountry, every one is on the move. Sometimes a huge column of baskets\r\nis seen in the air, and walks away in a marvellously steady manner,\r\nor a monster railway van, laden with sieves of fruit, and with the\r\ndriver perched up on his high seat, jolts heavily over the stones.\r\nCabbages are piled up into stacks as it were. Carts are heaped high\r\nwith turnips, and bunches of carrots like huge red fingers, are seen in\r\nall directions. Flower-girls, with large bundles of violets under their\r\narms, run past, leaving a trail of perfume behind them. Wagons, with\r\ntheir shafts sticking up in the air, are ranged before the salesmen’s\r\nshops, the high green load railed in with hurdles, and every here and\r\nthere bunches of turnips are seen flying in the air over the heads of\r\nthe people. Groups of apple-women, with straw pads on their crushed\r\nbonnets, and coarse shawls crossing their bosoms, sit on their porter’s\r\nknots, chatting in Irish, and smoking short pipes; every passer-by\r\nis hailed with the cry of, “Want a baskit, yer honor?” The porter,\r\ntrembling under the piled-up hamper, trots along the street, with his\r\nteeth clenched and shirt wet with the weight, and staggering at every\r\nstep he takes.\r\n\r\nInside, the market all is bustle and confusion. The people walk along\r\nwith their eyes fixed on the goods, and frowning with thought. Men in\r\nall costumes, from the coster in his corduroy suit to the greengrocer\r\nin his blue apron, sweep past. A countryman, in an old straw hat and\r\ndusty boots, occasionally draws down the anger of a woman for walking\r\nabout with his hands in the pockets of his smock-frock, and is asked,\r\n“if that is the way to behave on a market-day?” Even the granite\r\npillars cannot stop the crowd, for it separates and rushes past them,\r\nlike the tide by a bridge pier. At every turn there is a fresh odour to\r\nsniff at; either the bitter aromatic perfume of the herbalists’ shops\r\nbreaks upon you, or the scent of oranges, then of apples, and then of\r\nonions is caught for an instant as you move along. The brocoli tied up\r\nin square packets, the white heads tinged slightly red, as it were,\r\nwith the sunshine,--the sieves of crimson love-apples, polished like\r\nchina,--the bundles of white glossy leeks, their roots dangling like\r\nfringe,--the celery, with its pinky stalks and bright green tops,--the\r\ndark purple pickling-cabbages,--the scarlet carrots,--the white knobs\r\nof turnips,--the bright yellow balls of oranges, and the rich brown\r\ncoats of the chesnuts--attract the eye on every side. Then there are\r\nthe apple-merchants, with their fruit of all colours, from the pale\r\nyellow green to the bright crimson, and the baskets ranged in rows on\r\nthe pavement before the little shops. Round these the customers stand\r\nexamining the stock, then whispering together over their bargain, and\r\ncounting their money. “Give you four shillings for this here lot,\r\nmaster,” says a coster, speaking for his three companions. “Four and\r\nsix is my price,” answers the salesman. “Say four, and it’s a bargain,”\r\ncontinues the man. “I said my price,” returns the dealer; “go and look\r\nround, and see if you can get ’em cheaper; if not, come back. I only\r\nwants what’s fair.” The men, taking the salesman’s advice, move on.\r\nThe walnut merchant, with the group of women before his shop, peeling\r\nthe fruit, their fingers stained deep brown, is busy with the Irish\r\npurchasers. The onion stores, too, are surrounded by Hibernians,\r\nfeeling and pressing the gold-coloured roots, whose dry skins crackle\r\nas they are handled. Cases of lemons in their white paper jackets, and\r\nblue grapes, just seen above the sawdust are ranged about, and in some\r\nplaces the ground is slippery as ice from the refuse leaves and walnut\r\nhusks scattered over the pavement.\r\n\r\nAgainst the railings of St. Paul’s Church are hung baskets and slippers\r\nfor sale, and near the public-house is a party of countrymen preparing\r\ntheir bunches of pretty coloured grass--brown and glittering, as if it\r\nhad been bronzed. Between the spikes of the railing are piled up square\r\ncakes of green turf for larks; and at the pump, boys, who probably\r\nhave passed the previous night in the baskets about the market, are\r\nwashing, and the water dripping from their hair that hangs in points\r\nover the face. The kerb-stone is blocked up by a crowd of admiring\r\nlads, gathered round the bird-catcher’s green stand, and gazing at\r\nthe larks beating their breasts against their cages. The owner, whose\r\nboots are red with the soil of the brick-field, shouts, as he looks\r\ncarelessly around, “A cock linnet for tuppence,” and then hits at the\r\nyouths who are poking through the bars at the fluttering birds.\r\n\r\nUnder the Piazza the costers purchase their flowers (in pots) which\r\nthey exchange in the streets for old clothes. Here is ranged a small\r\ngarden of flower-pots, the musk and mignonette smelling sweetly, and\r\nthe scarlet geraniums, with a perfect glow of coloured air about the\r\nflowers, standing out in rich contrast with the dark green leaves of\r\nthe evergreens behind them. “There’s myrtles, and larels, and boxes,”\r\nsays one of the men selling them, “and there’s a harbora witus, and\r\nlauristiners, and that bushy shrub with pink spots is heath.” Men and\r\nwomen, selling different articles, walk about under the cover of the\r\ncolonnade. One has seed-cake, another small-tooth and other combs,\r\nothers old caps, or pig’s feet, and one hawker of knives, razors, and\r\nshort hatchets, may occasionally be seen driving a bargain with a\r\ncountryman, who stands passing his thumb over the blade to test its\r\nkeenness. Between the pillars are the coffee-stalls, with their large\r\ntin cans and piles of bread and butter, and protected from the wind\r\nby paper screens and sheets thrown over clothes-horses; inside these\r\nlittle parlours, as it were, sit the coffee-drinkers on chairs and\r\nbenches, some with a bunch of cabbages on their laps, blowing the steam\r\nfrom their saucers, others, with their mouths full, munching away at\r\ntheir slices, as if not a moment could be lost. One or two porters are\r\nthere besides, seated on their baskets, breakfasting with their knots\r\non their heads.\r\n\r\nAs you walk away from this busy scene, you meet in every street barrows\r\nand costers hurrying home. The pump in the market is now surrounded by\r\na cluster of chattering wenches quarrelling over whose turn it is to\r\nwater their drooping violets, and on the steps of Covent Garden Theatre\r\nare seated the shoeless girls, tying up the halfpenny and penny bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “GREEN” FRUIT SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe fruit selling of the streets of London is of a distinct character\r\nfrom that of vegetable or fish selling, inasmuch as fruit is for the\r\nmost part a luxury, and the others are principally necessaries.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the consumption of fruit supplies a fair\r\ncriterion of the condition of the working classes, but the\r\ncostermongers, as a body of traders, are little observant, so that it\r\nis not easy to derive from them much information respecting the classes\r\nwho are their customers, or as to how their custom is influenced by\r\nthe circumstances of the times. One man, however, told me that during\r\nthe last panic he sold hardly anything beyond mere necessaries. Other\r\nstreet-sellers to whom I spoke could not comprehend what a panic meant.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligent costers whom I conversed with agreed that they\r\nnow sold less fruit than ever to working people, but perhaps more\r\nthan ever to the dwellers in the smaller houses in the suburbs, and\r\nto shopkeepers who were not in a large way of business. One man sold\r\nbaking apples, but not above a peck on an average weekly, to women whom\r\nhe knew to be the wives of working men, for he had heard them say,\r\n“Dear me, I didn’t think it had been so late, there’s hardly time to\r\nget the dumplings baked before my husband leaves work for his dinner.”\r\nThe course of my inquiries has shown me--and many employers whom I\r\nhave conversed with are of a similar opinion--that the well-conducted\r\nand skilful artisan, who, in spite of slop competition, continues to\r\nenjoy a fair rate of wages, usually makes a prudent choice of a wife,\r\nwho perhaps has been a servant in a respectable family. Such a wife is\r\nprobably “used to cooking,” and will oft enough make a pie or pudding\r\nto eke out the cold meat of the Monday’s dinner, or “for a treat for\r\nthe children.” With the mass of the working people, however, it is\r\notherwise. The wife perhaps has been reared to incessant toil with\r\nher needle, and does not know how to make even a dumpling. Even if\r\nshe possess as much knowledge, she may have to labour as well as her\r\nhusband, and if their joint earnings enable them to have “the added\r\npudding,” there is still the trouble of making it; and, after a weary\r\nweek’s work, rest is often a greater enjoyment than a gratification\r\nof the palate. Thus something easily prepared, and carried off to the\r\noven, is preferred. The slop-workers of all trades never, I believe,\r\ntaste either fruit pie or pudding, unless a penny one be bought at a\r\nshop or in the street; and even among mechanics who are used to better\r\ndiet, the pies and puddings, when wages are reduced, or work grows\r\nslack, are the first things that are dispensed with. “When the money\r\ndoesn’t come in, sir,” one working-man said to me, “we mustn’t think of\r\npuddings, but of _bread_.”\r\n\r\nA costermonger, more observant than the rest, told me that there were\r\nsome classes to whom he had rarely sold fruit, and whom he had seldom\r\nseen buy any. Among these he mentioned sweeps, scavengers, dustmen,\r\nnightmen, gas-pipe-layers, and sewer-men, who preferred to any fruit,\r\n“something to bite in the mouth, such as a penn’orth of gin.” My\r\ninformant believed that this abstinence from fruit was common to all\r\npersons engaged in such offensive trades as fiddle-string making,\r\ngut-dressing for whip-makers or sausage-makers, knackers, &c. He\r\nwas confident of it, as far as his own experience extended. It is,\r\nmoreover, less common for the women of the town, of the poorer sort,\r\nto expend pence in fruit than in such things as whelks, shrimps, or\r\nwinks, to say nothing of gin. Persons, whose stomachs may be one week\r\njaded to excess, and the next be deprived of a sufficiency of proper\r\nfood, seek for stimulants, or, as they term it, “relishes.”\r\n\r\nThe fruit-sellers, meaning thereby those who deal principally in fruit\r\nin the season, are the more intelligent costermongers. The calculation\r\nas to what a bushel of apples, for instance, will make in half or\r\nquarter pecks, puzzles the more ignorant, and they buy “second-hand,”\r\nor of a middle-man, and consequently dearer. The Irish street-sellers\r\ndo not meddle much with fruit, excepting a few of the very best class\r\nof them, and they “do well in it,” I was told, “they have such tongue.”\r\n\r\nThe improvement in the quality of the fruit and vegetables now in our\r\nmarkets, and consequently in the necessaries and luxuries of the poorer\r\nclasses, is very great. Prizes and medals have been deservedly awarded\r\nto the skilled and persevering gardeners who have increased the size\r\nand heightened the flavour of the pine-apple or the strawberry--who\r\nhave given a thinner rind to the peach, or a fuller gush of juice to\r\nthe apricot,--or who have enhanced alike the bloom, the weight, and\r\nthe size of the fruit of the vine, whether as regards the classic\r\n“bunch,” or the individual grape. Still these are benefits confined\r\nmainly to the rich. But there is another class of growers who have\r\nrendered greater services and whose services have been comparatively\r\nunnoticed. I allude to those gardeners who have improved or introduced\r\nour _every day_ vegetables or fruit, such as now form the cheapest\r\nand most grateful and healthy enjoyments of the humbler portion of\r\nthe community. I may instance the introduction of rhubarb, which was\r\ncomparatively unknown until Mr. Myatt, now of Deptford, cultivated it\r\nthirty years ago. He then, for the first time, carried seven bundles\r\nof rhubarb into the Borough market. Of these he could sell only three,\r\nand he took four back with him. Mr. Myatt could not recollect the price\r\nhe received for the first rhubarb he ever sold in public, but he told\r\nme that the stalks were only about half the substance of those he now\r\nproduces. People laughed at him for offering “physic pies,” but he\r\npersevered, and I have shown what the sale of rhubarb now is.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the importation of foreign “pines” may be cited as another\r\ninstance of the increased luxuries of the poor. The trade in this\r\ncommodity was unknown until the year 1842. At that period Mr. James\r\nWood and Messrs. Claypole and Son, of Liverpool, imported them from\r\nthe Bahamas, a portion being conveyed to Messrs. Keeling and Hunt, of\r\nLondon. Since that period the trade has gradually increased until,\r\ninstead of 1000 pines being sent to Liverpool, and a portion of them\r\nconveyed to London, as at first, 200,000 pines are now imported to\r\nLondon alone. The fruit is brought over in “trees,” stowed in numbers\r\nfrom ten to thirty thousand, in galleries constructed fore and aft\r\nin the vessel, which is so extravagantly fragrant, that it has to\r\nbe ventilated to abate the odour. But for this importation, and but\r\nfor the trade having become a part of the costermonger’s avocation,\r\nhundreds and thousands in London would never have tasted a pine-apple.\r\nThe quality of the fruit has, I am informed, been greatly improved\r\nsince its first introduction; the best description of “pines” which\r\nCovent-garden can supply having been sent out to graft, to increase\r\nthe size and flavour of the Bahaman products, and this chiefly for the\r\nregalement of the palates of the humbler classes of London. The supply\r\nfrom the Bahamas is considered inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nPine-apples, when they were first introduced, were a rich harvest to\r\nthe costermonger. They made more money “working” these than any other\r\narticle. The pines cost them about 4_d._ each, one with the other, good\r\nand bad together, and were sold by the costermonger at from 1_s._ to\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ The public were not aware then that the pines they sold\r\nwere “salt-water touched,” and the people bought them as fast as they\r\ncould be sold, not only by the whole one, but at 1_d._ a slice,--for\r\nthose who could not afford to give 1_s._ for the novelty, had a slice\r\nas a taste for 1_d._ The costermongers used then to have flags flying\r\nat the head of their barrows, and gentlefolk would stop them in the\r\nstreets; indeed, the sale for pines was chiefly among “the gentry.” The\r\npoorer people--sweeps, dustmen, cabmen--occasionally had pennyworths,\r\n“just for the fun of the thing;” but gentlepeople, I was told, used\r\nto buy a whole one to take home, so that all the family might have\r\na taste. One costermonger assured me that he had taken 22_s._ a day\r\nduring the rage for pines, when they first came up.\r\n\r\nI have before stated that when the season is in its height the\r\ncostermonger prefers the vending of fruit to the traffic in either\r\nfish or vegetables; those, however, who have regular rounds and “a\r\nconnection,” must supply their customers with vegetables, if not\r\nfish, as well as fruit, but the costers prefer to devote themselves\r\nprincipally to fruit. I am unable, therefore, to draw a comparison\r\nbetween what a coster realises in fruit, and what in fish, as the two\r\nseasons are not contemporary. The fruit sale is, however, as I have\r\nshown in p. 54, the costermonger’s harvest.\r\n\r\nAll the costermongers with whom I conversed represented that the\r\ngreater cheapness and abundance of fruit had been anything but a\r\nbenefit to them, nor did the majority seem to know whether fruit was\r\nscarcer or more plentiful one year than another, unless in remarkable\r\ninstances. Of the way in which the introduction of foreign fruit\r\nhad influenced their trade, they knew nothing. If questioned on the\r\nsubject, the usual reply was, that things got worse, and people didn’t\r\nbuy so much fruit as they did half-a-dozen years back, and so less was\r\nsold. That these men hold such opinions must be accounted for mainly by\r\nthe increase in their numbers, of which I have before spoken, and from\r\ntheir general ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of which there is the readiest sale in the streets is one\r\nusually considered among the least useful--cherries. Probably, the\r\ngreater eagerness on the part of the poorer classes to purchase this\r\nfruit arises from its being the first of the fresh “green” kind which\r\nour gardens supply for street-sale after the winter and the early\r\nspring. An intelligent costermonger suggested other reasons. “Poor\r\npeople,” he said, “like a _quantity_ of any fruit, and no fruit is\r\ncheaper than cherries at 1_d._ a pound, at which I have sold some\r\nhundreds of pounds’ weight. I’m satisfied, sir, that if a cherry could\r\nbe grown that weighed a pound, and was of a finer flavour than ever was\r\nknown before, poor people would rather have a number of little ones,\r\neven if they was less weight and inferior quality. Then boys buy, I\r\nthink, more cherries than other fruit; because, after they have eaten\r\n’em, they can play at cherry-stones.”\r\n\r\nFrom all I can learn, the halfpenny-worth of fruit purchased most\r\neagerly by a poor man, or by a child to whom the possession of a\r\nhalfpenny is a rarity, is cherries. I asked a man “with a good\r\nconnection,” according to his own account, as to who were his customers\r\nfor cherries. He enumerated ladies and gentlemen; working-people;\r\nwagoners and carters (who “slipped them quietly into their pockets,”\r\nhe said); parlour-livers (so he called the occupants of parlours);\r\nmaid-servants; and soldiers. “Soldiers,” I was told, “are very fond of\r\nsomething for a change from their feed, which is about as regular as a\r\nprison’s.”\r\n\r\nThe currant, and the fruit of the same useful genus, the gooseberry,\r\nare sold largely by the costermongers. The price of the currants is\r\n1_d._ or 2_d._ the half-pint, 1_d._ being the more usual charge. Of red\r\ncurrants there is the greatest supply, but the black “go off better.”\r\nThe humbler classes buy a half-pint of the latter for a dumpling, and\r\n“they’re reckoned,” said my informant, “capital for a sore throat,\r\neither in jam or a pudding.” Gooseberries are also retailed by the\r\nhalf-pint, and are cheaper than currants--perhaps 1/2_d._ the half-pint\r\nis the average street-price. The working-classes do not use ripe\r\ngooseberries, as they do ripe currants, for dumplings, but they are\r\nsold in greater quantities and may be said to constitute, when first\r\nintroduced, as other productions do afterwards, the working-people’s\r\nSunday dessert. “Only you go on board a cheap steamer to Greenwich,\r\non a fine summer Sunday,” observed a street-seller to me, “and you’ll\r\nsee lots of young women with gooseberries in their handkerchiefs in\r\ntheir laps. Servant-maids is very good customers for such things as\r\ngooseberries, for they always has a penny to spare.” The costers sell\r\ngreen gooseberries for dumplings, and sometimes to the extent of a\r\nfourth of the ripe fruit. The price of green gooseberries is generally\r\n1/2_d._ a pint dearer than the ripe.\r\n\r\nWhen strawberries descend to such a price as places them at the\r\ncostermonger’s command, the whole fraternity is busily at work, and as\r\nthe sale can easily be carried on by women and children, the coster’s\r\nfamily take part in the sale, offering at the corners of streets the\r\nfragrant pottle, with the crimson fruit just showing beneath the green\r\nleaves at the top. Of all cries, too, perhaps that of “hoboys” is the\r\nmost agreeable. Strawberries, however, according to all accounts,\r\nare consumed least of all fruits by the poor. “They like something\r\nmore solid,” I was told, “something to bite at, and a penny pottle\r\nof strawberries is only like a taste; what’s more, too, the really\r\ngood fruit never finds its way into penny pottles.” The coster’s best\r\ncustomers are dwellers in the suburbs, who purchase strawberries on\r\na Sunday especially, for dessert, for they think that they get them\r\nfresher in that way than by reserving them from the Saturday night, and\r\nmany are tempted by seeing or hearing them cried in the streets. There\r\nis also a good Sunday sale about the steam-wharfs, to people going\r\n“on the river,” especially when young women and children are members\r\nof a party, and likewise in the “clerk districts,” as Camden-town and\r\nCamberwell. Very few pottles, comparatively, are sold in public-houses;\r\n“they don’t go well down with the beer at all,” I was told. The city\r\npeople are good customers for street strawberries, conveying them home.\r\nGood strawberries are 2_d._ a pottle in the streets when the season is\r\nat its height. Inferior are 1_d._ These are the most frequent prices.\r\nIn raspberries the coster does little, selling them only to such\r\ncustomers as use them for the sake of jam or for pastry. The price is\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ the pottle, 9_d._ being the average.\r\n\r\nThe great staple of the street trade in green fruit is apples. These\r\nare first sold by the travelling costers, by the measure, for pies,\r\n&c., and to the classes I have described as the makers of pies. The\r\napples, however, are soon vended in penny or halfpenny-worths, and\r\nthen they are bought by the poor who have a spare penny for the\r\nregalement of their children or themselves, and they are eaten without\r\nany preparation. Pears are sold to the same classes as are apples.\r\nThe average price of apples, as sold by the costermonger, is 4_s._ a\r\nbushel, and six a penny. The sale in halfpenny and pennyworths is very\r\ngreat. Indeed the costermongers sell about half the apples brought to\r\nthe markets, and I was told that for one pennyworth of apples bought\r\nin a shop forty were bought in the street. Pears are 9_d._ a bushel,\r\ngenerally, dearer than apples, but, numerically, they run more to the\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nThe costers purchase the French apples at the wharf, close to\r\nLondon-bridge, on the Southwark side. They give 10_s._, 12_s._, 18_s._,\r\nor 20_s._ for a case containing four bushels. They generally get from\r\n9_d._ to 1_s._ profit on a bushel of English, but on the French apples\r\nthey make a clear profit of from 1_s._ 3_d._ to 2_s._ a bushel, and\r\nwould make more, but the fruit sometimes “turns out damaged.” This\r\nextra profit is owing to the French giving better measure, their four\r\nbushels being about five market bushels, as there is much straw packed\r\nup with the English apples, and none with the French.\r\n\r\nPlums and damsons are less purchased by the humbler classes than\r\napples, or than any other larger sized fruit which is supplied\r\nabundantly. “If I’ve worked plums or damsons,” said an experienced\r\ncostermonger, “and have told any woman pricing them: ‘They don’t look\r\nso ripe, but they’re all the better for a pie,’ she’s answered, ‘O, a\r\nplum pie’s too fine for us, and what’s more, it takes too much sugar.’”\r\nThey are sold principally for desserts, and in penny-worths, at 1_d._\r\nthe half-pint for good, and 1/2 _d._ for inferior. Green-gages are\r\n50 per cent. higher. Some costers sell a cheap lot of plums to the\r\neating-house keepers, and sell them more readily than they sell apples\r\nto the same parties.\r\n\r\nWest Indian pine-apples are, as regards the street sale, disposed\r\nof more in the city than elsewhere. They are bought by clerks and\r\nwarehousemen, who carry them to their suburban homes. The slices at\r\n1/2_d._ and 1_d._ are bought principally by boys. The average price of\r\na “good street pine” is 9_d._\r\n\r\nPeaches are an occasional sale with the costermongers’, and are\r\ndisposed of to the same classes as purchase strawberries and pines. The\r\nstreet sale of peaches is not practicable if the price exceed 1_d._ a\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nOf other fruits, vended largely in the streets, I have spoken under\r\ntheir respective heads.\r\n\r\nThe returns before cited as to the quantity of home-grown and foreign\r\ngreen fruit sold in London, and the _proportion_ disposed of by the\r\ncostermongers give the following results (in round numbers), as to the\r\nabsolute quantity of the several kinds of green fruit (oranges and nuts\r\nexcepted) “distributed” throughout the metropolis by the street-sellers.\r\n\r\n    343,000  bushels of apples, (home-grown)\r\n     34,560     „       apples, (foreign)\r\n    176,500     „       pears,  (home-grown)\r\n     17,235     „       pears,  (foreign)\r\n  1,039,200  lbs. of cherries,  (home-grown)\r\n    176,160    „     cherries,  (foreign)\r\n     11,766  bushels of plums,\r\n        100     „       greengages,\r\n        548     „       damsons,\r\n      2,450     „       bullaces,\r\n    207,525     „       gooseberries,\r\n     85,500  sieves of red currants,\r\n     13,500     „      black currants,\r\n      3,000     „      white currants,\r\n    763,750  pottles of strawberries,\r\n      1,762     „       raspberries,\r\n     30,485     „       mulberries,\r\n      6,012  bushels of hazel nuts,\r\n     17,280  lbs. of filberts,\r\n     26,563    „     grapes,\r\n     20,000  pines.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ORANGE AND NUT MARKET.\r\n\r\nIn Houndsditch there is a market supported principally by\r\ncostermongers, who there purchase their oranges, lemons, and nuts.\r\nThis market is entirely in the hands of the Jews; and although a few\r\ntradesmen may attend it to buy grapes, still it derives its chief\r\ncustom from the street-dealers who say they can make far better\r\nbargains with the Israelites, (as they never refuse an offer,) than\r\nthey can with the Covent-garden salesmen, who generally cling to their\r\nprices. This market is known by the name of “Duke’s-place,” although\r\nits proper title is St. James’s-place. The nearest road to it is\r\nthrough Duke’s-street, and the two titles have been so confounded that\r\nat length the mistake has grown into a custom.\r\n\r\nDuke’s-place--as the costers call it--is a large square yard, with the\r\niron gates of a synagogue in one corner, a dead wall forming one entire\r\nside of the court, and a gas-lamp on a circular pavement in the centre.\r\nThe place looks as if it were devoted to money-making--for it is quiet\r\nand dirty. Not a gilt letter is to be seen over a doorway; there is\r\nno display of gaudy colour, or sheets of plate-glass, such as we see\r\nin a crowded thoroughfare when a customer is to be caught by show. As\r\nif the merchants knew their trade was certain, they are content to\r\nlet the London smoke do their painter’s work. On looking at the shops\r\nin this quarter, the idea forces itself upon one that they are in\r\nthe last stage of dilapidation. Never did property in Chancery look\r\nmore ruinous. Each dwelling seems as though a fire had raged in it,\r\nfor not a shop in the market has a window to it; and, beyond the few\r\nsacks of nuts exposed for sale, they are empty, the walls within being\r\nblackened with dirt, and the paint without blistered in the sun, while\r\nthe door-posts are worn round with the shoulders of the customers, and\r\nblack as if charred. A few sickly hens wander about, turning over the\r\nheaps of dried leaves that the oranges have been sent over in, or roost\r\nthe time away on the shafts and wheels of the nearest truck. Excepting\r\non certain days, there is little or no business stirring, so that many\r\nof the shops have one or two shutters up, as if a death had taken\r\nplace, and the yard is quiet as an inn of court. At a little distance\r\nthe warehouses, with their low ceilings, open fronts, and black sides,\r\nseem like dark holes or coal-stores; and, but for the mahogany backs\r\nof chairs showing at the first floors, you would scarcely believe the\r\nhouses to be inhabited, much more to be elegantly furnished as they\r\nare. One of the drawing-rooms that I entered here was warm and red with\r\nmorocco leather, Spanish mahogany, and curtains and Turkey carpets;\r\nwhile the ormolu chandelier and the gilt frames of the looking-glass\r\nand pictures twinkled at every point in the fire-light.\r\n\r\nThe householders in Duke’s-place are all of the Jewish persuasion, and\r\namong the costers a saying has sprung up about it. When a man has been\r\nout of work for some time, he is said to be “Cursed, like a pig in\r\nDuke’s-place.”\r\n\r\nAlmost every shop has a Scripture name over it, and even the\r\npublic-houses are of the Hebrew faith, their signs appealing to the\r\nfollowers of those trades which most abound with Jews. There is the\r\n“Jeweller’s Arms,” patronised greatly of a Sunday morning, when the\r\nIsraelite jewellers attend to exchange their trinkets and barter\r\namongst themselves. Very often the counter before “the bar” here may\r\nbe seen covered with golden ornaments, and sparkling with precious\r\nstones, amounting in value to thousands of pounds. The landlord of this\r\nhouse of call is licensed to _manufacture_ tobacco and cigars. There\r\nis also the “Fishmongers’ Arms,” the resort of the vendors of fried\r\nsoles; here, in the evening, a concert takes place, the performers and\r\naudience being Jews. The landlord of this house too is licensed to\r\nmanufacture tobacco and cigars. Entering one of these houses I found a\r\nbill announcing a “Bible to be raffled for, the property of ----.” And,\r\nlastly, there is “Benjamin’s Coffee-house,” open to old clothesmen;\r\nand here, again, the proprietor is a licensed tobacco-manufacturer.\r\nThese facts are mentioned to show the untiring energy of the Jew when\r\nanything is to be gained, and to give an instance of the curious manner\r\nin which this people support each other.\r\n\r\nSome of the nut and orange shops in Duke’s-place it would be impossible\r\nto describe. At one sat an old woman, with jet-black hair and a\r\nwrinkled face, nursing an infant, and watching over a few matted\r\nbaskets of nuts ranged on a kind of carpenter’s bench placed upon the\r\npavement. The interior of the house was as empty as if it had been to\r\nlet, excepting a few bits of harness hanging against the wall, and an\r\nold salt-box nailed near the gas-lamp, in which sat a hen, “hatching,”\r\nas I was told. At another was an excessively stout Israelite mother,\r\nwith crisp negro’s hair and long gold earrings, rolling her child on\r\nthe table used for sorting the nuts. Here the black walls had been\r\nchalked over with scores, and every corner was filled up with sacks and\r\norange-cases. Before one warehouse a family of six, from the father\r\nto the infant, were busy washing walnuts in a huge tub with a trap in\r\nthe side, and around them were ranged measures of the wet fruit. The\r\nJewish women are known to make the fondest parents; and in Duke’s-place\r\nthere certainly was no lack of fondlings. Inside almost every parlour\r\na child was either being nursed or romped with, and some little things\r\nwere being tossed nearly to the ceiling, and caught, screaming with\r\nenjoyment, in the jewelled hands of the delighted mother. At other\r\nshops might be seen a circle of three or four women--some old as if\r\ngrandmothers, grouped admiringly round a hook-nosed infant, tickling it\r\nand poking their fingers at it in a frenzy of affection.\r\n\r\nThe counters of these shops are generally placed in the open streets\r\nlike stalls, and the shop itself is used as a store to keep the stock\r\nin. On these counters are ranged the large matting baskets, some\r\npiled up with dark-brown polished chestnuts--shining like a racer’s\r\nneck--others filled with wedge-shaped Brazil-nuts, and rough hairy\r\ncocoa-nuts. There are heaps, too, of newly-washed walnuts, a few\r\nshowing their white crumpled kernels as a sample of their excellence.\r\nBefore every doorway are long pot-bellied boxes of oranges, with the\r\nyellow fruit just peeping between the laths on top, and lemons--yet\r\ngreen--are ranged about in their paper jackets to ripen in the air.\r\n\r\nIn front of one store the paving-stones were soft with the sawdust\r\nemptied from the grape-cases, and the floor of the shop itself was\r\nwhitened with the dry powder. Here stood a man in a long tasselled\r\nsmoking-cap, puffing with his bellows at the blue bunches on a tray,\r\nand about him were the boxes with the paper lids thrown back, and\r\nthe round sea-green berries just rising above the sawdust as if\r\nfloating in it. Close by, was a group of dark-eyed women bending over\r\nan orange-case, picking out the rotten from the good fruit, while a\r\nsallow-complexioned girl was busy with her knife scooping out the\r\ndamaged parts, until, what with sawdust and orange-peel, the air smelt\r\nlike the pit of a circus.\r\n\r\nNothing could be seen in this strange place that did not, in some way\r\nor another, appertain to Jewish customs. A woman, with a heavy gold\r\nchain round her neck, went past, carrying an old green velvet bonnet\r\ncovered with feathers, and a fur tippet, that she had either recently\r\npurchased or was about to sell. Another woman, whose features showed\r\nher to be a Gentile, was hurrying toward the slop-shop in the Minories\r\nwith a richly quilted satin-lined coat done up in her shawl, and the\r\nmarket-basket by her side, as if the money due for the work were to be\r\nspent directly for housekeeping.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Duke’s-street was a stall kept by a Jew, who sold\r\nthings that are eaten only by the Hebrews. Here in a yellow pie-dish\r\nwere pieces of stewed apples floating in a thick puce-coloured sauce.\r\n\r\nOne man that I spoke to told me that he considered his Sunday morning’s\r\nwork a very bad one if he did not sell his five or six hundred bushels\r\nof nuts of different kinds. He had taken 150_l._ that day of the\r\nstreet-sellers, and usually sold his 100_l._ worth of goods in a\r\nmorning. Many others did the same as himself. Here I met with every\r\nattention, and was furnished with some valuable statistical information\r\nconcerning the street-trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ORANGE AND LEMON SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nOf foreign fruits, the oranges and nuts supply by far the greater\r\nstaple for the street trade, and, therefore, demand a brief, but still\r\na fuller, notice than other articles.\r\n\r\nOranges were first sold in the streets at the close of Elizabeth’s\r\nreign. So rapidly had the trade increased, that four years after her\r\ndeath, or in 1607, Ben Jonson classes “orange-wives,” for noisiness,\r\nwith “fish-wives.” These women at first carried the oranges in baskets\r\non their heads; barrows were afterwards used; and now trays are usually\r\nslung to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nOranges are brought to this country in cases or boxes, containing from\r\n500 to 900 oranges. From official tables, it appears that between\r\n250,000,000 and 300,000,000 of oranges and lemons are now yearly\r\nshipped to England. They are sold wholesale, principally at public\r\nsales, in lots of eight boxes, the price at such sales varying greatly,\r\naccording to the supply and the quality. The supply continues to arrive\r\nfrom October to August.\r\n\r\nOranges are bought by the retailers in Duke’s-place and in\r\nCovent-Garden; but the costermongers nearly all resort to Duke’s-place,\r\nand the shopkeepers to Covent-Garden. They are sold in baskets of 200\r\nor 300; they are also disposed of by the hundred, a half-hundred being\r\nthe smallest quantity sold in Duke’s-place. These hundreds, however,\r\nnumber 110, containing 10 double “hands,” a single hand being 5\r\noranges. The price in December was 2_s._ 6_d._, 3_s._ 6_d._, and 4_s._\r\nthe hundred. They are rarely lower than 4_s._ about Christmas, as there\r\nis then a better demand for them. The damaged oranges are known as\r\n“specks,” and the purchaser runs the risk of specks forming a portion\r\nof the contents of a basket, as he is not allowed to empty it for the\r\nexamination of the fruit: but some salesmen agree to change the specks.\r\nA month after Christmas, oranges are generally cheaper, and become\r\ndearer again about May, when there is a great demand for the supply of\r\nthe fairs and races.\r\n\r\nOranges are sold by all classes connected with the fruit, flower, or\r\nvegetable trade of the streets. The majority of the street-sellers are,\r\nhowever, women and children, and the great part of these are Irish. It\r\nhas been computed that, when oranges are “at their best” (generally\r\nabout Easter), there are 4,000 persons, including stall-keepers,\r\nselling oranges in the metropolis and its suburbs; while there are\r\ngenerally 3,000 out of this number “working” oranges--that is, hawking\r\nthem from street to street: of these, 300 attend at the doors of the\r\ntheatres, saloons, &c. Many of those “working” the theatres confine\r\ntheir trade to oranges, while the other dealers rarely do so, but\r\nunite with them the sale of nuts of some kind. Those who sell only\r\noranges, or only nuts, are mostly children, and of the poorest class.\r\nThe smallness of the sum required to provide a stock of oranges (a\r\nhalf-hundred being 15_d._ or 18_d._), enables the poor, who cannot\r\nraise “stock-money” sufficient to purchase anything else, to trade upon\r\na few oranges.\r\n\r\nThe regular costers rarely buy oranges until the spring, except,\r\nperhaps, for Sunday afternoon sale--though this, as I said before, they\r\nmostly object to. In the spring, however, they stock their barrows with\r\noranges. One man told me that, four or five years back, he had sold in\r\na day 2,000 oranges that he picked up as a bargain. They did not cost\r\nhim half a farthing each; he said he “cleared 2_l._ by the spec.” At\r\nthe same period he could earn 5_s._ or 6_s._ on a Sunday afternoon by\r\nthe sale of oranges in the street; but now he could not earn 2_s._\r\n\r\nA poor Irishwoman, neither squalid in appearance nor ragged in dress,\r\nthough looking pinched and wretched, gave me the subjoined account;\r\nwhen I saw her, resting with her basket of oranges near Coldbath-fields\r\nprison, she told me she almost wished she was inside of it, but for the\r\n“childer.” Her history was one common to her class--\r\n\r\n“I was brought over here, sir, when I was a girl, but my father and\r\nmother died two or three years after. I was in service then, and very\r\ngood service I continued in as a maid-of-all-work, and very kind people\r\nI met; yes, indeed, though I was Irish and a Catholic, and they was\r\nEnglish Protistants. I saved a little money there, and got married. My\r\nhusband’s a labourer; and when he’s in full worruk he can earn 12_s._\r\nor 14_s._ a week, for he’s a good hand and a harrud-worruking man, and\r\nwe do middlin’ thin. He’s out of worruk now, and I’m forced to thry and\r\nsill a few oranges to keep a bit of life in us, and my husband minds\r\nthe childer. Bad as I do, I can do 1_d._ or 2_d._ a day profit betther\r\nthan him, poor man! for he’s tall and big, and people thinks, if he\r\ngoes round with a few oranges, it’s just from idleniss; and the Lorrud\r\nabove knows he’ll always worruk whin he can. He goes sometimes whin I’m\r\nharrud tired. One of us must stay with the childer, for the youngist\r\nis not three and the ildest not five. We don’t live, we starruve. We\r\ngit a few ’taties, and sometimes a plaice. To-day I’ve not taken 3_d._\r\nas yit, sir, and it’s past three. Oh, no, indeed and indeed, thin, I\r\ndont make 9_d._ a day. We live accordingly, for there’s 1_s._ 3_d._ a\r\nweek for rint. I have very little harrut to go into the public-houses\r\nto sill oranges, for they begins flying out about the Pope and Cardinal\r\nWiseman, as if I had anything to do with it. And that’s another reason\r\nwhy I like my husband to stay at home, and me to go out, because he’s a\r\nhasty man, and might get into throuble. I don’t know what will become\r\nof us, if times don’t turn.”\r\n\r\nOn calling upon this poor woman on the following day, I found her and\r\nher children absent. The husband had got employment at some distance,\r\nand she had gone to see if she could not obtain a room 3_d._ a week\r\ncheaper, and lodge near the place of work.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Board of Trade returns, there are nearly two hundred\r\nmillions of oranges annually imported into this country. About\r\none-third of these are sold wholesale in London, and one-fourth of the\r\nlatter quantity disposed of retail in the streets. The returns I have\r\nprocured, touching the London sale, prove that no less than 15,500,000\r\nare sold yearly by the street-sellers. The retail price of these may\r\nbe said to be, upon an average, 5_s._ per 110, and this would give us\r\nabout 35,000_l._ for the gross sum of money laid out every year, in the\r\nstreets, in the matter of oranges alone.\r\n\r\nThe street lemon-trade is now insignificant, lemons having become a\r\nmore important article of commerce since the law required foreign-bound\r\nships to be provided with lemon-juice. The street-sale is chiefly in\r\nthe hands of the Jews and the Irish. It does not, however, call for\r\nspecial notice here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF NUT SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of foreign hazel nuts are principally women and children,\r\nbut the stall-keepers, and oftentimes the costermongers, sell them with\r\nother “goods.” The consumption of them is immense, the annual export\r\nfrom Tarragona being little short of 8,000 tons. They are to be found\r\nin every poor shop in London, as well as in the large towns; they are\r\ngenerally to be seen on every street-stall, in every country village,\r\nat every fair, and on every race-ground. The supply is from Gijon and\r\nTarragona. The Gijon nuts are the “Spanish,” or “fresh” nuts. They are\r\nsold at public sales, in barrels of three bushels each, the price being\r\nfrom 35_s._ to 40_s._ The nuts from Tarragona, whence comes the great\r\nsupply, are known as “Barcelonas,” and they are kiln-dried before they\r\nare shipped. Hence the Barcelonas will “keep,” and the Spanish will\r\nnot. The Spanish are coloured with the fumes of sulphur, by the Jews in\r\nDuke’s-place.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that nuts supply employment to a number of\r\ngirls in Spain, and then yield the means of a scanty subsistence to a\r\nnumber of girls (with or without parents) in England.\r\n\r\nThe prattle and the laughter (according to Inglis) of the Spanish\r\ngirls who sort, find no parallel however among the London girls who\r\nsell the nuts. The appearance of the latter is often wretched. In the\r\nwinter months they may be seen as if stupified with cold, and with\r\nthe listlessness, not to say apathy, of those whose diet is poor in\r\nquantity and insufficient in amount.\r\n\r\nVery few costermongers buy nuts (as hazel nuts are always called)\r\nat the public sales--only those whose dealings are of a wholesale\r\ncharacter, and they are anything but regular attendants at the sales.\r\nThe street-sellers derive nearly the whole of their supply from\r\nDuke’s-place. The principal times of business are Friday afternoons\r\nand Sunday mornings. Those who have “capital” buy on the Friday, when\r\nthey say they can make 10_s._ go as far as 12_s._ on the Sunday. The\r\n“Barcelonas” are from 4-1/2_d._ to 6_d._ a quart to the street-sellers.\r\nThe cob-nuts, which are the large size, used by the pastry-cooks for\r\nmottos, &c., are 2_d._ and 2-1/2_d._ the quart, but they are generally\r\ndestitute of a kernel. A quart contains from 100 to 180 nuts, according\r\nto the size. The costermongers buy somewhat largely when nuts are 3_d._\r\nthe quart; they then, and not unfrequently, stock their barrows with\r\nnuts entirely, but 2_s._ a day is reckoned excellent earnings at this\r\ntrade. “It’s the worst living of all, sir,” I was told, “on nuts.”\r\nThe sale in the streets is at the fruit-stalls, in the public-houses,\r\non board the steamers, and at the theatre doors. They are sold by the\r\nsame class as the oranges, and a stock may be procured for a smaller\r\nsum even than is required for oranges. By the outlay of 1_s._ many an\r\nIrishwoman can send out her two or three children with nuts, reserving\r\nsome for herself. Seven-eighths of the nuts imported are sold, I am\r\nassured, in the open air.\r\n\r\nSome of the costermongers who are to be found in Battersea-fields,\r\nand who attend the fairs and races, get through 5_s._ worth of nuts\r\nin a day, but only exceptionally. These men have a sort of portable\r\nshooting-gallery. The customer fires a kind of rifle, loaded with a\r\ndart, and according to the number marked on the centre, or on the\r\nencircling rings of a board which forms the head of the stall, and\r\nwhich may be struck by the dart, is the number of nuts payable by the\r\nstall-keeper for the halfpenny “fire.”\r\n\r\nThe Brazil nuts, which are now sold largely in the streets at twelve\r\nto sixteen a penny, were not known in this country as an article of\r\ncommerce before 1824. They are sold by the peck--2_s._ being the\r\nordinary price--in Duke’s-place.\r\n\r\nCoker-nuts--as they are now generally called, and indeed “entered”\r\nas such at the Custom-house, and so written by Mr. Mc Culloch, to\r\ndistinguish them from cocoa, or the berries of the cacâo, used for\r\nchocolate, etc.--are brought from the West Indies, both British and\r\nSpanish, and Brazil. They are used as dunnage in the sugar ships, being\r\ninterposed between the hogsheads, to steady them and prevent their\r\nbeing flung about. The coker-nut was introduced into England in 1690.\r\nThey are sold at public sales and otherwise, and bring from 10_s._ to\r\n14_s._ per 100. Coker-nuts are now used at fairs to “top” the sticks.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers rarely speculate in coker-nuts now, as the boys will\r\nnot buy them unless cut, and it is almost impossible to tell how the\r\ncoker-nut will “open.” The interior is sold in halfpenny-worths and\r\npenny-worths. These nuts are often “worked with a drum.” There may\r\nbe now forty coker-nut men in the street trade, but not one in ten\r\nconfines himself to the article.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the dry or ripe walnuts sold in the streets is\r\nfrom Bordeaux. They are sold at public sales, in barrels of three\r\nbushels each, realising 21_s._ to 25_s._ a barrel. They are retailed\r\nat from eight to twenty a penny, and are sold by all classes of\r\nstreet-traders.\r\n\r\nA little girl, who looked stunted and wretched, and who did not know\r\nher age (which might be eleven), told me she was sent out by her mother\r\nwith six halfpenny-worth of nuts, and she must carry back 6_d._ or she\r\nwould be beat. She had no father, and could neither read nor write.\r\nHer mother was an Englishwoman, _she believed_, and sold oranges. She\r\nhad heard of God; he was “Our Father who art in heaven.” She’d heard\r\nthat said. She did not know the Lord’s Prayer; had never heard of it;\r\ndid not know who the Lord was; perhaps the Lord Mayor, but she had\r\nnever been before him. She went into public-houses with her nuts, but\r\ndid not know whether she was ever insulted or not; she did not know\r\nwhat insulted was, but she was never badly used. She often went into\r\ntap-rooms with her nuts, just to warm herself. A man once gave her some\r\nhot beer, which made her ill. Her mother was kind enough to her, and\r\nnever beat her but for not taking home 6_d._ She had a younger brother\r\nthat did as she did. She had bread and potatoes to eat, and sometimes\r\ntea, and sometimes herrings. Her mother didn’t get tipsy (at first she\r\ndid not know what was meant by tipsy) _above_ once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ROASTED CHESTNUTS AND APPLES.\r\n\r\nHow long the street-trade in roasted chestnuts has been carried on\r\nI find no means of ascertaining precisely, but it is unquestionably\r\none of the oldest of the public traffics. Before potato-cans were\r\nintroduced, the sale of roasted chestnuts was far greater than it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to compute the number of roasted chestnut-sellers at\r\npresent in the streets. It is probable that they outnumber 1,000, for\r\nI noticed that on a cold day almost every street fruit-seller, man or\r\nwoman, had roasted chestnuts for sale.\r\n\r\nSometimes the chestnuts are roasted in the streets, in a huge iron\r\napparatus, made expressly for the purpose, and capable of cooking\r\nperhaps a bushel at a time--but these are to be found solely at the\r\nstreet-markets.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary street apparatus for roasting chestnuts is simple. A\r\nround pan, with a few holes punched in it, costing 3_d._ or 4_d._ in a\r\nmarine-store shop, has burning charcoal within it, and is surmounted by\r\na second pan, or kind of lid, containing chestnuts, which are thus kept\r\nhot. During my inquiry, chestnuts were dear. “People don’t care,” I\r\nwas told, “whether chestnuts is three and six, as they are now, or one\r\nand six a peck, as I hope they will be afore long; they wants the same\r\npennyworths.”\r\n\r\nChestnuts are generally bought wholesale in Duke’s-place, on the\r\nSunday mornings, for street sale; but some street-dealers buy them of\r\nthose costermongers, whose means enable them “to lay in” a quantity.\r\nThe retail customers are, for the most part, boys and girls, or a few\r\nlabourers or street people. The usual price is sixteen a penny.\r\n\r\nRoasted apples used to be vended in the streets, and often along with\r\nroasted chestnuts, but it is a trade which has now almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, and its disappearance is attributed to the prevalence of\r\npotato cans.\r\n\r\nI had the following account from a woman, apparently between sixty and\r\nseventy, though she said she was only about fifty. What she was in\r\nher youth, she said, she neither knew nor cared. At any rate she was\r\nunwilling to converse about it. I found her statement as to chestnuts\r\ncorroborated:--\r\n\r\n“The trade’s nothing to what it was, sir,” she said. “Why when the\r\nhackney coaches was in the streets, I’ve often sold 2_s._ worth of\r\na night at a time, for a relish, to the hackneymen that was waiting\r\ntheir turn over their beer. Six and eight a penny was enough then;\r\nnow people must have sixteen; though I pays 3_s._ a peck, and to get\r\nthem at that’s a favour. I could make my good 12_s._ a week on roasted\r\nchestnuts and apples, and as much on other things in them days, but I’m\r\nhalf-starved now. There’ll never be such times again. People didn’t\r\nwant to cut one another’s throats in the street business then. O, I\r\ndon’t know anything about how long ago, or what year--years is nothing\r\nto me--but I only know that it was so. I got a penny a piece then for\r\nmy roasted apples, and a halfpenny for sugar to them. I _could_ live\r\nthen. Roasted apples was reckoned good for the tooth-ache in them days,\r\nbut, people change so, they aren’t now. I don’t know what I make now in\r\nchestnuts and apples, which is all I sells--perhaps 5_s._ a week. My\r\nrent’s 1_s._ 3_d._ a week. I lives on a bit of fish, or whatever I can\r\nget, and that’s all about it.”\r\n\r\nThe absolute quantity of oranges, lemons, and nuts sold annually in the\r\nLondon streets is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Oranges                      15,400,000\r\n  Lemons                          154,000\r\n  Spanish and Barcelona nuts       24,000 bushels\r\n  Brazil do.                        3,000    „\r\n  Chestnuts                         6,500    „\r\n  Walnuts                          24,000    „\r\n  Coker-nuts                      400,000 nuts\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “DRY” FRUIT SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of “dry fruit” cannot be described as a class, for, with\r\nthe exception of one old couple, none that I know of confine themselves\r\nto its sale, but resort to it merely when the season prevents their\r\ndealing in “green fruit” or vegetables. I have already specified what\r\nin commerce is distinguished as “dry fruit,” but its classification\r\namong the costers is somewhat narrowed.\r\n\r\nThe dry-fruit sellers derive their supplies partly from Duke’s-place,\r\npartly from Pudding-lane, but perhaps principally from the costers\r\nconcerning whom I have spoken, who buy wholesale at the markets and\r\nelsewhere, and who will “clear out a grocer,” or buy such figs, &c.\r\nas a leading tradesman will not allow to be sent, or offered, to\r\nhis regular customers, although, perhaps, some of the articles are\r\ntolerably good. Or else the dry-fruit men buy a damaged lot of a broker\r\nor grocer, and pick out all that is eatable, or rather saleable.\r\n\r\nThe sale of dry fruit is unpopular among the costermongers. Despite\r\ntheir utmost pains, they cannot give to figs, or raisins, or currants,\r\nwhich may be old and stale, anything of the bloom and plumpness of\r\ngood fruit, and the price of good fruit is too high for them. Moreover,\r\nif the fruit be a “damaged lot,” it is almost always discoloured, and\r\nthe blemish cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give the average price of dry fruit to the\r\ncostermonger. The quality and the “harvest” affect the price materially\r\nin the regular trade.\r\n\r\nThe rule which I am informed the costermonger, who sometimes “works”\r\na barrow of dried fruit, observes, is this: he will aim at cent. per\r\ncent., and, to accomplish it, “slang” weights are not unfrequently\r\nused. The stale fruit is sold by the grocers, and the damaged fruit\r\nby the warehouses to the costers, at from a half, but much more\r\nfrequently a fourth to a twentieth of its prime cost. The principal\r\nstreet-purchasers are boys.\r\n\r\nA dry-fruit seller gave me the following account:--By “half profits” he\r\nmeant cent. per cent., or, in other words, that the money he received\r\nfor his stock was half of it cost price and half profit.\r\n\r\n“I sell dry fruit, sir, in February and March, because I must be doing\r\nsomething, and green fruit’s not my money then. It’s a poor trade. I’ve\r\nsold figs at 1_d._ a pound,--no, sir, not slang the time I mean--and\r\nI could hardly make 1_s._ a day at it, though it was half profits.\r\nOur customers look at them quite particler. ‘Let’s see the other side\r\nof them figs,’ the boys’ll say, and then they’ll out with--‘I say,\r\nmaster, d’you see any green about me?’ Dates I can hardly get off at\r\nall, no!--not if they was as cheap as potatoes, or cheaper. I’ve been\r\nasked by women if dates was good in dumplings? I’ve sometimes said\r\n‘yes,’ though I knew nothing at all about them. They’re foreign. I\r\ncan’t say where they’re grown. Almonds and raisins goes off best with\r\nus. I don’t sell them by weight, but makes them up in ha’penny or penny\r\nlots. There’s two things, you see, and one helps off the other. Raisins\r\nis dry grapes, I’ve heard. I’ve sold grapes before they was dried, at\r\n1_d._ and 2_d._ the pound. I didn’t do no good in any of ’em; 1_s._ a\r\nday on ’em was the topper, for all the half profits. I’ll not touch ’em\r\nagain if I aint forced.”\r\n\r\nThere are a few costers who sell tolerable dry fruit, but not to any\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe old couple I have alluded to stand all the year round at the corner\r\nof a street running into a great city thoroughfare. They are supplied\r\nwith their fruit, I am told, through the friendliness of a grocer who\r\ncharges no profit, and sometimes makes a sacrifice for their benefit.\r\nAs I was told that this old couple would not like inquiries to be made\r\nof them, I at once desisted.\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes twenty costermongers selling nothing but dry fruit,\r\nbut more frequently only ten, and sometimes only five; while, perhaps,\r\nfrom 300 to 400 sell a few figs, &c., with other things, such as late\r\napples, the dry fruit being then used “just as a fill up.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the returns before given, the gross quantity of dry fruit\r\ndisposed of yearly in the streets of London may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n   7,000 lbs. of shell almonds,\r\n  37,800    „    raisins,\r\n  24,300    „    figs,\r\n   4,200    „    prunes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nThe seller of fruit in the streets confines his traffic far more\r\nclosely to fruit, than does the vegetable-dealer to vegetables. Within\r\nthese three or four years many street-traders sell only fruit the year\r\nthrough; but the purveyor of vegetables now usually sells fish with his\r\ncabbages, turnips, cauliflowers, or other garden stuff. The fish that\r\nhe carries out on his round generally consists of soles, mackerel, or\r\nfresh or salt herrings. This combination of the street-green-grocer and\r\nstreet-fishmonger is called a “general dealer.”\r\n\r\nThe general dealers are usually accompanied by boys (as I have\r\nelsewhere shown), and sometimes by their wives. If a woman be a general\r\ndealer, she is mostly to be found at a stall or standing, and not\r\n“going a round.”\r\n\r\nThe general dealer “works” everything through the season. He generally\r\nbegins the year with sprats or plaice: then he deals in soles until\r\nthe month of May. After this he takes to mackerel, haddocks, or red\r\nherrings. Next he trades in strawberries or raspberries. From these\r\nhe will turn to green and ripe gooseberries; thence he will go to\r\ncherries; from cherries he will change to red or white currants; from\r\nthem to plums or green-gages, and from them again to apples and pears,\r\nand damsons. After these he mostly “works” a few vegetables, and\r\ncontinues with them until the fish season begins again. Some general\r\ndealers occasionally trade in sweetmeats, but this is not usual, and is\r\nlooked down upon by the “trade.”\r\n\r\n“I am a general dealer,” said one of the better class; “my missis is\r\nin the same line as myself, and sells everything that I do (barring\r\ngreen stuff.) She follows me always in what I sell. She has a stall,\r\nand sits at the corner of the street. I have got three children. The\r\neldest is ten, and goes out with me to call my goods for me. I have had\r\ninflammation in the lungs, and when I call my goods for a little while\r\nmy voice leaves me. My missis is lame. She fell down a cellar, when a\r\nchild, and injured her hip. Last October twelvemonth I was laid up with\r\ncold, which settled on my lungs, and laid me in my bed for a month. My\r\nmissis kept me all that time. She was ‘working’ fresh herrings; and if\r\nit hadn’t been for her we must all have gone into the workhouse. We\r\nare doing very badly now. I have no work to do. I have no stock-money\r\nto work with, and I object to pay 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for the loan of\r\n10_s._ Once I gave a man 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for ten months for the\r\nloan of 10_s._, and that nearly did me up. I have had 8_s._ of the\r\nsame party since, and paid 1_s._ a week for eight weeks for the loan\r\nof it. I consider it most extortionate to have to pay 2_d._ a day for\r\nthe loan of 8_s._, and won’t do it. When the season gets a bit better\r\nI shall borrow a shilling of one friend and a shilling of another, and\r\nthen muddle on with as much stock-money as I can scrape together. My\r\nmissis is at home now doing nothing. Last week it’s impossible to say\r\nwhat she took, for we’re obliged to buy victuals and firing with it as\r\nwe take it. She can’t go out charing on account of her hip. When she is\r\nout, and I am out, the children play about in the streets. Only last\r\nSaturday week she was obligated to take the shoes off her feet to get\r\nthe children some victuals. We owe two weeks’ rent, and the landlord,\r\nthough I’ve lived in the house five years, is as sharp as if I was a\r\nstranger.”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” said another vegetable-dealer, who was a robust-looking\r\nyoung man, very clean in his person, and dressed in costermonger\r\ncorduroy, “I can hardly say what my business is worth to me, for I’m\r\nno scholard. I was brought up to the business by my mother. I’ve a\r\nmiddling connection, and perhaps clear 3_s._ a day, every fine day, or\r\n15_s._ or 16_s._ a week; but out of that there’s my donkey to keep,\r\nwhich I suppose costs 6_d._ a day, that’s seven sixpences off. Wet or\r\nfine, she must be fed, in coorse. So must I; but I’ve only myself to\r\nkeep at present, and I hire a lad when I want one. I work my own trap.\r\nThen things is so uncertain. Why, now, look here, sir. Last Friday,\r\nI think it was--but that don’t matter, for it often happens--fresh\r\nherrings was 4_s._ the 500 in the morning, and 1_s._ 6_d._ at night,\r\nso many had come in. I buy at Billingsgate-market, and sometimes of a\r\nlarge shopkeeper, and at Covent-garden and the Borough. If I lay out\r\n7_s._ in a nice lot of cabbages, I may sell them for 10_s._ 6_d._, or\r\nif it isn’t a lucky day with me for 8_s._, or less. Sometimes people\r\nwon’t buy, as if the cholera was in the cabbages. Then turnips isn’t\r\nsuch good sale yet, but they may be soon, for winter’s best for them.\r\nThere’s more bilings then than there’s roastings, I think. People like\r\nbroth in cold weather. I buy turnips by the ‘tally.’ A tally’s five\r\ndozen bunches. There’s no confinement of the number to a bunch; it’s\r\nby their size; I’ve known twelve, and I’ve known twice that. I sell\r\nthree parts of the turnips at 1_d._ a bunch, and the other part at\r\n1-1/2_d._ If I get them at 3_s._ 6_d._ the tally I do well on turnips.\r\nI go the same rounds pretty regularly every day, or almost every day. I\r\ndon’t object to wet weather so much, because women don’t like to stir\r\nout then, and so they’ll buy of me as I pass. Carrots I do little in;\r\nthey’re dear, but they’ll be cheaper in a month or two. They always\r\nare. I don’t work on Sundays. If I did, I’d get a jacketing. Our chaps\r\nwould say: ‘Well, you _are_ a scurf. _You_ have a round; give another\r\nman a Sunday chance.’ A gentleman once said to me, when I was obligated\r\nto work on a Sunday: ‘Why don’t you leave it off, when you know it\r\nain’t right?’ ‘Well, sir,’ said I, and he spoke very kind to me,\r\n‘well, sir, I’m working for my dinner, and if you’ll give me 4_s._ or\r\n3_s._ 6_d._, I’ll tumble to your notion and drop it, and I’ll give you\r\nthese here cowcumbers,’ (I was working cowcumbers at that time) ‘to do\r\nwhat you like with, and they cost me half-a-crown.’ In potatoes I don’t\r\ndo a great deal, and it’s no great trade. If I did, I should buy at the\r\nwarehouses in Tooley-street, where they are sold in sacks of 1 cwt.;\r\n150 lbs. and 200 lbs., at 2_s._ 9_d._ and 3_s._ the cwt. I sell mine,\r\ntidy good, at 3 pound 2_d._, and a halfpenny a pound, but as I don’t do\r\nmuch, not a bushel a day, I buy at market by the bushel at from 1_s._\r\n6_d._ to 2_s._ I never uses slangs. I sold three times as many potatoes\r\nas I do now four years back. I don’t know why, ’cept it be that the rot\r\nset people again them, and their taste’s gone another way. I sell a few\r\nmore greens than I did, but not many. Spinach I don’t do only a little\r\nin it. Celery I’m seldom able to get rid on. It’s more women’s work.\r\nIng-uns the same.”\r\n\r\nI may add that I found the class, who confined their business\r\nprincipally to the sale of vegetables, the dullest of all the\r\ncostermongers. Any man may labour to make 1_s._ 6_d._ of cabbages or\r\nturnips, which cost him 1_s._, when the calculation as to the relative\r\nproportion of measures, &c. is beyond his comprehension.\r\n\r\nPursuing the same mode of calculation as has been heretofore adopted,\r\nwe find that the absolute quantity of vegetables sold in the London\r\nstreets by the costers is as follows:\r\n\r\n  20,700,000 lbs. of potatoes (home grown)\r\n  39,800,000         „        (foreign)\r\n  23,760,133 cabbages,\r\n   3,264,800 turnips,\r\n     616,666 junks of turnip tops,\r\n     601,000 carrots,\r\n     567,300 brocoli and cauliflowers,\r\n     219,000 bushels of peas,\r\n       8,893     „      beans,\r\n      22,110     „      french beans,\r\n      25,608 dozens of vegetable marrows,\r\n         489 dozen bundles of asparagus,\r\n       9,120     „      rhubarb,\r\n       4,350     „      celery,\r\n     561,600 lettuces,\r\n      13,291 dozen hands of radishes,\r\n     499,533 bushels of onions,\r\n      23,600 dozen bunches of spring onions,\r\n      10,920 bushels of cucumbers,\r\n       3,290 dozen bunches of herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “ARISTOCRATIC” VEGETABLE-SALE.\r\n\r\nIn designating these dealers I use a word not uncommon among the\r\ncostermongers. These aristocratic sellers, who are not one in twenty,\r\nor perhaps in twenty-five, of the whole body of costermongers, are\r\ngenerally men of superior manners and better dressed than their\r\nbrethren. The following narrative, given to me by one of the body,\r\nshows the nature of the trade:--\r\n\r\n“It depends a good deal upon the season and the price, as to what I\r\nbegin with in the ‘haristocratic’ way. My rounds are always in the\r\nsuburbs. I sell neither in the streets, nor squares in town. I like it\r\nbest where there are detached villas, and best of all where there are\r\nkept mistresses. They are the best of all customers to men like me. We\r\ntalk our customers over among ourselves, and generally know who’s who.\r\nOne way by which we know the kept ladies is, they never sell cast-off\r\nclothes, as some ladies do, for new potatoes or early peas. Now, my\r\nworst customers, as to price, are the ladies--or gentlemen--they’re\r\nboth of a kidney--what keeps fashionable schools. _They_ are the people\r\nto drive a bargain, but then they buy largely. Some buy entirely of\r\ncostermongers. There’s one gent. of a school-keeper buys so much and\r\nknows so well what o’clock it is, that I’m satisfied he saves many a\r\npound a year by buying of us ’stead of the greengrocers.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I begin the season in the haristocratic way, with early\r\nlettuces for salads. I carry my goods in handsome baskets, and\r\nsometimes with a boy, or a boy and a girl, to help me. I buy my\r\nlettuces by the score (of heads) when first in, at 1_s._ 6_d._, and\r\nsell them at 1-1/2_d._ each, which is 1_s._ profit on a score. I have\r\nsold twenty, and I once sold thirty score, that way in a day. The\r\nprofit on the thirty was 2_l._ 5_s._, but out of that I had to pay\r\nthree boys, for I took three with me, and our expenses was 7_s._ But\r\nyou must consider, sir, that this is a precarious trade. Such goods are\r\ndelicate, and spoil if they don’t go off. I give credit sometimes, if\r\nanybody I know says he has no change. I never lost nothing.\r\n\r\n“Then there’s grass (asparagus), and that’s often good money. I buy all\r\nmine at Covent-garden, where it’s sold in bundles, according to the\r\nearliness of the season, at from 5_s._ to 1_s._, containing from six to\r\nten dozen squibs (heads). These you have to take home, untie, cut off\r\nthe scraggy ends, trim, and scrape, and make them level. Children help\r\nme to do this in the court where I live. I give them a few ha’pence,\r\nthough they’re eager enough to do it for nothing but the fun. I’ve had\r\n10_s._ worth made ready in half an hour.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, sir, about grass, there’s not a coster in London, I’m sure,\r\never tasted it; and how it’s eaten puzzles us.” [I explained the manner\r\nin which asparagus was brought to table.] “That’s the ticket, is it,\r\nsir? Well, I was once at the Surrey, and there was some macaroni eaten\r\non the stage, and I thought grass was eaten in the same way, perhaps;\r\nswallowed like one o’clock,” [rather a favourite comparison among the\r\ncosters.]\r\n\r\n“I have the grass--it’s always called, when cried in the streets,\r\n‘Spar-row gra-ass’--tied up in bundles of a dozen, twelve to a dozen,\r\nor one over, and for these I never expect less than 6_d._ For a three\r\nor four dozen lot, in a neat sieve, I ask 2_s._ 6_d._, and never take\r\nless than 1_s._ 3_d._ I once walked thirty-five miles with grass, and\r\nhave oft enough been thirty miles. I made 7_s._ or 8_s._ a day by it,\r\nand next day or two perhaps nothing, or may-be had but one customer.\r\nI’ve sold half-crown lots, on a Saturday night, for a sixpence; and\r\nit _was_ sold some time back at 2_d._ a bundle, in the New Cut, to\r\npoor people. I dare say some as bought it had been maid-servants and\r\nunderstood it. I’ve raffled 5_s._ worth of grass in the parlour of a\r\nrespectable country inn of an evening.\r\n\r\n“The costers generally buy new potatoes at 4_s._ to 5_s._ the bushel,\r\nand cry them at ‘three-pound-tuppence;’ but I’ve given 7_s._ a bushel,\r\nfor choice and early, and sold them at 2_d._ a pound. It’s no great\r\ntrade, for the bushel may weigh only 50 lb., and at 2_d._ a pound\r\nthat’s only 8_s._ 4_d._ The schools don’t buy at all until they’re\r\n1_d._ the pound, and don’t buy in any quantity until they’re 1_s._\r\n6_d._ the 25 lb. One day a school ’stonished me by giving me 2_s._\r\n6_d._ for 25 lb., which is the general weight of the half bushel.\r\nPerhaps the master had taken a drop of something short that morning.\r\nThe schools are dreadful screws, to be sure.\r\n\r\n“Green peas, early ones, I don’t buy when they first come in, for then\r\nthey’re very dear, but when they’re 4_s._ or 3_s._ 6_d._ a bushel, and\r\nthat’s pretty soon. I can make five pecks of a bushel. Schools don’t\r\ntouch peas ’till they’re 2_s._ a bushel.\r\n\r\n“Cowcumbers were an aristocratic sale. Four or five years ago they\r\nwere looked upon, when first in, and with a beautiful bloom upon them,\r\nas the finest possible relish. But the cholera came in 1849, and\r\neverybody--’specially the women--thought the cholera was in cowcumbers,\r\nand I’ve known cases, foreign and English, sent from the Borough Market\r\nfor manure.\r\n\r\n“I sell a good many mushrooms. I sometimes can pick up a cheap lot at\r\nCovent Garden. I make them up in neat sieves of three dozen to eight\r\ndozen according to size, and I have sold them at 4_s._ the sieve, and\r\nmade half that on each sieve I sold. They are down to 1_s._ or 1_s._\r\n6_d._ a sieve very soon.\r\n\r\n“Green walnuts for pickling I sell a quantity of. One day I sold 20_s._\r\nworth--half profit--I got them so cheap, but that was an exception. I\r\nsold them cheap too. One lady has bought a bushel and a half at a time.\r\nFor walnut catsup the refuse of the walnut is used; it’s picked up in\r\nthe court, where I’ve got children or poor fellows for a few ha’pence\r\nor a pint of beer to help me to peel the walnuts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ONION SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of onions in the streets is immense. They are now sold at\r\nthe markets at an average of 2_s._ a bushel. Two years ago they were\r\n1s., and they have been 4_s._ and up to 7_s._ the bushel. They are now\r\ntwisted into “ropes” for street sale. The ropes are of straw, into\r\nwhich the roots are platted, and secured firmly enough, so that the\r\nropes can be hung up; these have superseded the netted onions, formerly\r\nsold by the Jew boys. The plaiting, or twisting, is done rapidly by the\r\nwomen, and a straw-bonnet-maker described it to me as somewhat after\r\nthe mode of her trade, only that the top, or projecting portion of the\r\nstem of the onion, was twisted within the straw, instead of its being\r\nplaited close and flat together. The trade in rope onions is almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Irish women and girls. There are now, it\r\nis said, from 800 to 1000 persons engaged in it. Onion selling can\r\nbe started on a small amount of capital, from 6_d._ to 1_s._, which\r\nis no doubt one inducement for those poor persons to resort to it.\r\nThe sixpenny ropes, bunches, or strings (I heard each word applied),\r\ncontain from three to four dozen; the penny bunches, from six to twenty\r\nroots, according to size; and the intermediate and higher priced\r\nbunches in proportion. Before Christmas, a good many shilling lots\r\nare sold. Among the costermongers I heard this useful root--which the\r\nlearned in such matters have pronounced to be, along with the mushroom,\r\nthe foundation of every sauce, ancient or modern--called ing-guns,\r\ning-ans, injens, injyens, inions, innons, almost everything but onions.\r\n\r\nAn Irishwoman, apparently of thirty-five, but in all probability\r\nyounger--she did not know her age--gave me the following account. Her\r\nface, with its strongly-marked Irish features, was almost purpled\r\nfrom constant exposure to the weather. She was a teetotaller. She\r\nwas communicative and garrulous, even beyond the average of her\r\ncountrywomen. She was decently clad, had been in London fifteen years\r\n(she thought) having been brought from Ireland, _viâ_ Bristol, by\r\nher parents (both dead). She herself was a widow, her husband, “a\r\nbricklayer” she called him (probably a bricklayer’s labourer), having\r\ndied of the cholera in 1849. I take up her statement from that period:\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, sir, he died--the heavins be his bed!--and he was\r\nprepared by Father M----. We had our thrials togither, but sore’s been\r\nthe cross and heavy the burthin since it plased God to call him. Thin,\r\nthere’s the two childer, Biddy and Ned. They’ll be tin and they’ll be\r\neight come their next burreth-days, ’plase the Lorrud. They can hilp\r\nme now, they can. They sells ing-uns as well. I ropes ’em for ’em. How\r\nis ing-uns roped? Shure, thin--but it’s not mocking me your ’onnur\r\nis--shure, thin, a gintleman like you, that can write like a horrus\r\na-galloping, and perhaps is as larned as a praste, glory be to God!\r\n_must_ know how to rope ing-uns! Poor people can do it. Some say it’s\r\na sacrit, but that’s all a say, or there couldn’t be so many ropes\r\na-silling. I buy the sthraw at a sthraw-daler’s; twopinn’orth at a\r\ntime; that’ll make six or twilve ropes, according to what they are,\r\nsixpinny or what. It’s as sthraight as it can be grown, the sthraw,\r\nthat it is indeed. Och, sir, we’ve had many’s the black day, me and\r\nthe childer, poor things; it’s thim I care about, but--God’s name be\r\npraised!--we’ve got on somehow. Another poor woman--she’s a widdur\r\ntoo, hilp her!--and me has a 2_s._ room for the two of us. We’ve our\r\nsiprate furnithur. She has only hersilf, but is fond of the childer, as\r\nyou or your lady--bliss her! if you’ve got one--might be, if you was\r\nwith them. I can read a little mysilf, at laste I could oncte, and I\r\ngits them a bit o’ schoolin’ now and thin, whin I can, of an evenin’\r\nmostly. I can’t write a letther; I wish I could. Shure, thin, sir, I’ll\r\ntell you the thruth--we does best on ing-uns. Oranges is nixt, and nuts\r\nisn’t near so good. The three of us now makes 1_s._ and sometimes 1_s._\r\n6_d._ a day, and that’s grand doin’s. We may sill bechuxt us from two\r\nto three dozin ropes a day. I’m quick at roping the ing-uns. I never\r\nnoted how many ropes an hour. I buy them of a thradesman, an honist\r\ngintleman, I know, and I see him at mass ivery Sunday, and he gives me\r\nas many as he can for 1_s._ or what it is. We has 1_d._, plase God,\r\non ivery 6_d._; yis, sir, perhaps more sometimes. I’ll not tell your\r\n’onnur a bit of a lie. And so we now get a nice bit o’ fish, with a\r\nbit of liver on a Sunday. I sell to the thradesmen, and the lodgers of\r\nthem, about here (Tottenham-court-road), and in many other parruts, for\r\nwe thravels a dale. The childer always goes the same round. We follows\r\none another. I’ve sould in the sthreets ever since I’ve been in this\r\ncounthry.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest sum of money expended by the poor upon any vegetable\r\n(after potatoes) is spent upon onions--99,900_l._ being annually\r\ndevoted to the purchase of that article. To those who know the habits\r\nof the poor, this will appear in no way singular--a piece of bread and\r\nan onion being to the English labourer what bread and an apple or a\r\nbunch of grapes is to the French peasant--often his dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF POT-HERBS AND CELERY.\r\n\r\nI use the old phrase, _pot-herbs_, for such productions as sage, thyme,\r\nmint, parsley, sweet marjoram, fennel, (though the last is rarely sold\r\nby the street-people), &c.; but “herbs” is the usual term. More herbs,\r\nsuch as agrimony, balm (balsam), wormwood, tansy, &c., used to be sold\r\nin the streets. These were often used for “teas,” medicinally perhaps,\r\nexcept tansy, which, being a strong aromatic, was used to flavour\r\npuddings. Wormwood, too, was often bought to throw amongst woollen\r\nfabrics, as a protective against the attack of moths.\r\n\r\nThe street herb-trade is now almost entirely in the hands of\r\nIrishwomen, and is generally carried on during the autumn and winter\r\nat stalls. With it, is most commonly united the sale of celery. The\r\nherbs are sold at the several markets, usually in shilling lots, but a\r\nquarter of a shilling lot may be purchased. The Irishwoman pursues a\r\nsimple method of business. What has cost her 1_s._ she divides into 24\r\nlots, each of 1_d._, or she will sell half of a lot for a halfpenny. An\r\nIrishwoman said to me:\r\n\r\n“Thrade isn’t good, sir; it falls and it falls. I don’t sell so many\r\nherrubs or so much ciliry as I did whin mate was higher. Poor people\r\nthin, I’ve often been said it, used to buy bones and bile them for\r\nbroth with ciliry and the beautiful herrubs. Now they buys a bit of\r\nmate and ates it without brothing. It’s good one way and it’s bad\r\nanother. Only last Sathurday night my husband--and a good husband\r\nhe’s to me, though he is a London man, for he knows how to make a\r\nbargain--he bought a bit of mutton, afore the stroke of twilve, in\r\nNewgit-markit, at 2-1/2_d._ the pound. I don’t know what parrut it\r\nwas. I don’t understand that, but he does, and tills me how to cook\r\nit. He has worruk at the docks, but not very rigular. I think I sill\r\nmost parrusley. Whin frish herrings is chape, some biles them with\r\nparrusley, and some fries them with ing-uns. No, sir; I don’t make\r\nsixpence a day; not half-a-crown a week, I’m shure. Whin herrubs isn’t\r\nin--and they’re autumn and winther things, and so is ciliry--I sills\r\nanything; gooseberries and currints, or anything. If I’d had a family,\r\nI couldn’t have had a shoe to my futt.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS VALUE OF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES SOLD ANNUALLY IN THE LONDON\r\nSTREETS.\r\n\r\nTo complete the present account of the costermonger’s trade, we must\r\nnow estimate the money value of the fruit and vegetables disposed\r\nof by them throughout the year. The money annually spent in fish\r\nby the humbler portion of the metropolitan population comes to, as\r\nwe have seen, very nearly one million five hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling--the sum laid out in fruit and vegetables we shall find is but\r\nlittle more than a third of this amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN FRUIT.\r\n\r\n     377,500 bushels of apples, at six a\r\n             penny or 4_s._ per bush.\r\n             (288 to the bushel)                 £75,500\r\n     193,700 bushels of pears, at 5_s._ per\r\n             bushel                               48,400\r\n   1,215,360 lbs. of

83,000\r\n      85,500 sieves of red currants, at\r\n             1_d._ per pint (three half-sieves\r\n             to the bushel)                       15,200\r\n      13,500 sieves of black currants, at\r\n             1_d._ per pint (three half-sieves\r\n             to the bushel)                        2,400\r\n       3,000 sieves of white currants, at\r\n             1_d._ per pint

costermongers\r\nno less a sum than £2,086,490.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STATIONARY STREET-SELLERS OF FISH, FRUIT, AND VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NUMBER OF STREET STALLS.\r\n\r\nThus far we have dealt only with the itinerant dealers in fish, fruit,\r\nor vegetables; but there are still a large class of street-sellers, who\r\nobtain a living by the sale of the same articles at some fixed locality\r\nin the public thoroughfares; and as these differ from the others in\r\ncertain points, they demand a short special notice here. First, as\r\nto the number of stalls in the streets of London, I caused personal\r\nobservations to be made; and in a walk of 46 miles, 632 stalls were\r\ncounted, which is at the rate of very nearly 14 to the mile. This, too,\r\nwas in bad weather,--was not on a Saturday night,--and at a season when\r\nthe fruit-sellers all declare that “things is dull.” The routes taken\r\nin this inquiry were:--No. 1, from Vauxhall to Hatton-garden; No. 2,\r\nfrom Baker-street to Bermondsey; No. 3, from Blackwall to Brompton; No.\r\n4, from the Hackney-road to the Edgeware-road. I give the results.\r\n\r\n             F.    FR.    V.    M.    T.\r\n  No. 1      9     28     5     7     49\r\n   „  2     37     50     4    14    105\r\n   „  3     90    153    30    40    313\r\n   „  4     75     52    23    15    165\r\n            --     --    --    --     --\r\n           211    283    62    76    632\r\n\r\nF. denotes fish-stalls; Fr. fruit-stalls; V. vegetable-stalls; M.\r\nmiscellaneous; and T. presents the total.\r\n\r\nThe miscellaneous stalls include peas-soup, pickled whelks, sweetmeats,\r\ntoys, tin-ware, elder-wine, and jewellery stands. Of these, the\r\ntoy-stalls were found to be the most numerous; sweetmeats the next;\r\ntin-ware the next; while the elder-wine stalls were least numerous.\r\n\r\nSome of the results indicate, curiously enough, the character of\r\nthe locality. Thus, in Fleet-street there were 3, in the Haymarket\r\n5, in Regent-street 6, and in Piccadilly 14 fruit-stalls, and no\r\nfish-stalls--these streets not being resorted to by the poor, to whom\r\nfruit is a luxury, but fish a necessity. In the Strand were 17 fruit\r\nand 2 fish-stalls; and in Drury-lane were 8 stalls of fish to 6 of\r\nfruit. On the other hand, there were in Ratcliffe-highway, 38 fish\r\nand 23 fruit-stalls; in Rosemary-lane, 13 fish and 8 fruit-stalls; in\r\nShoreditch, 28 fish and 13 fruit-stalls; and in Bethnal-green Road\r\n(the poorest district of all), 14 of the fish, and but 3 of the fruit\r\nstalls. In some places, the numbers were equal, or nearly so; as in the\r\nMinories, for instance, the City-road, the New-road, Goodge-street,\r\nTottenham-court Road, and the Camberwell-road; while in Smithfield were\r\n5, and in Cow-cross 2 fish-stalls, and no fruit-stalls at all. In this\r\nenumeration the street-markets of Leather-lane, the New Cut, the Brill,\r\n&c., are not included.\r\n\r\nThe result of this survey of the principal London thoroughfares is\r\nthat in the _mid-route_ (viz., from Brompton, along Piccadilly, the\r\nStrand, Fleet-street, and so _viâ_ the Commercial-road to Blackwall),\r\nthere are twice as many stalls as in the great _northern thoroughfare_\r\n(that is to say, from the Edgeware-road, along the New-road, to the\r\nHackney-road); the latter route, however, has more than one-third\r\nas many stalls as route No. 2, and that again more than double the\r\nnumber of route No. 1. Hence it appears that the more frequented the\r\nthoroughfare, the greater the quantity of street-stalls.\r\n\r\nThe number of miles of streets contained within the inner police\r\ndistrict of the metropolis, are estimated by the authorities at 2,000\r\n(including the city), and assuming that there are on an average only\r\nfour stalls to the mile throughout London, we have thus a grand total\r\nof 8,000 fish, fruit, vegetable, and other stalls dispersed throughout\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IRISH STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\n“Sweet Chany! Two a pinny Or-r-ranges--two a pinny!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nConcerning the character of the stalls at the street-markets, the\r\nfollowing observations have been made:--At the New-cut there were,\r\nbefore the removals, between the hours of eight and ten on a Saturday\r\nevening, ranged along the kerb-stone on the north side of the\r\nroad, beginning at Broad-wall to Marsh-gate (a distance of nearly\r\nhalf-a-mile), a dense line of “pitches”--at 77 of which were vegetables\r\nfor sale, at 40 fruit, 25 fish, 22 boots and shoes, 14 eatables,\r\nconsisting of cakes and pies, hot eels, baked potatoes, and boiled\r\nwhelks; 10 dealt in nightcaps, lace, ladies’ collars, artificial\r\nflowers, silk and straw bonnets; 10 in tinware--such as saucepans,\r\ntea-kettles, and Dutch-ovens; 9 in crockery and glass, 7 in brooms\r\nand brushes, 5 in poultry and rabbits, 6 in paper, books, songs, and\r\nalmanacs; and about 60 in sundries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHARACTER OF THE STREET-STALLS.\r\n\r\nThe stalls occupied by costermongers for the sale of fish, fruit,\r\nvegetables, &c., are chiefly constructed of a double cross-trestle\r\nor moveable frame, or else of two trestles, each with three legs,\r\nupon which is laid a long deal board, or tray. Some of the stalls\r\nconsist merely of a few boards resting upon two baskets, or upon\r\ntwo herring-barrels. The fish-stalls are mostly covered with\r\npaper--generally old newspapers or periodicals--but some of the\r\nstreet-fishmongers, instead of using paper to display their fish upon,\r\nhave introduced a thin marble slab, which gives the stall a cleaner,\r\nand, what they consider a high attribute, a “respectable” appearance.\r\n\r\nMost of the fruit-stalls are, in the winter time, fitted up with an\r\napparatus for roasting apples and chestnuts; this generally consists\r\nof an old saucepan with a fire inside; and the woman who vends\r\nthem, huddled up in her old faded shawl or cloak, often presents a\r\npicturesque appearance, in the early evening, or in a fog, with the\r\ngleam of the fire lighting up her half somnolent figure. Within the\r\nlast two or three years, however, there has been so large a business\r\ncarried on in roasted chestnuts, that it has become a distinct\r\nstreet-trade, and the vendors have provided themselves with an iron\r\napparatus, large enough to roast nearly half a bushel at a time. At\r\nthe present time, however, the larger apparatus is less common in the\r\nstreets, and more frequent in the shops, than in the previous winter.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, peculiar kinds of stalls--such as the hot eels and\r\nhot peas-soup stalls, having tin oval pots, with a small chafing-dish\r\ncontaining a charcoal fire underneath each, to keep the eels or soup\r\nhot. The early breakfast stall has two capacious tin cans filled with\r\ntea or coffee, kept hot by the means before described, and some are\r\nlighted up by two or three large oil-lamps; the majority of these\r\nstalls, in the winter time, are sheltered from the wind by a screen\r\nmade out of an old clothes horse covered with tarpaulin. The cough-drop\r\nstand, with its distilling apparatus, the tin worm curling nearly the\r\nwhole length of the tray, has but lately been introduced. The nut-stall\r\nis fitted up with a target at the back of it. The ginger-beer stand may\r\nbe seen in almost every street, with its French-polished mahogany frame\r\nand bright polished taps, and its foot-bath-shaped reservoir of water,\r\nto cleanse the glasses. The hot elder wine stand, with its bright brass\r\nurns, is equally popular.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of plum-pudding, “cake, a penny a slice,” sweetmeats,\r\ncough-drops, pin-cushions, jewellery, chimney ornaments, tea and\r\ntable-spoons, make use of a table covered over, some with old\r\nnewspapers, or a piece of oil-cloth, upon which are exposed their\r\narticles for sale.\r\n\r\nSuch is the usual character of the street-stalls. There are, however,\r\n“stands” or “cans” peculiar to certain branches of the street-trade.\r\nThe most important of these, such as the baked-potato can, and the\r\nmeat-pie stand, I have before described, p. 27.\r\n\r\nThe other means adopted by the street-sellers for the exhibition of\r\ntheir various goods at certain “pitches” or fixed localities are\r\nas follows. Straw bonnets, boys’ caps, women’s caps, and prints,\r\nare generally arranged for sale in large umbrellas, placed “upside\r\ndown.” Haberdashery, with rolls of ribbons, edgings, and lace, some\r\nstreet-sellers display on a stall; whilst others have a board at the\r\nedge of the pavement, and expose their wares upon it as tastefully\r\nas they can. Old shoes, patched up and well blacked, ready for the\r\npurchaser’s feet, and tin ware, are often ranged upon the ground, or,\r\nwhere the stock is small, a stall or table is used.\r\n\r\nMany stationary street-sellers use merely baskets, or trays, either\r\nsupported in their hand, or on their arm, or else they are strapped\r\nround their loins, or suspended round their necks. These are mostly\r\nfruit-women, watercress, blacking, congreves, sheep’s-trotters, and\r\nham-sandwich sellers.\r\n\r\nMany stationary street-sellers stand on or near the bridges; others\r\nnear the steam-packet wharfs or the railway terminuses; a great number\r\nof them take their pitch at the entrance to a court, or at the corners\r\nof streets; and stall-keepers with oysters stand opposite the doors of\r\npublic-houses.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for a street-seller who wants to “pitch” in a new\r\nlocality to solicit the leave of the housekeeper, opposite whose\r\npremises he desires to place his stall. Such leave obtained, no other\r\ncourse is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF FRUIT-STALL KEEPERS.\r\n\r\nI had the following statement from a woman who has “kept a stall”\r\nin Marylebone, at the corner of a street, which she calls “my\r\ncorner,” for 38 years. I was referred to her as a curious type of the\r\nclass of stall-keepers, and on my visit, found her daughter at the\r\n“pitch.” This daughter had all the eloquence which is attractive in\r\na street-seller, and so, I found, had her mother when she joined us.\r\nThey are profuse in blessings; and on a bystander observing, when he\r\nheard the name of these street-sellers, that a jockey of that name\r\nhad won the Derby lately, the daughter exclaimed, “To be sure he did;\r\nhe’s my own uncle’s relation, and what a lot of money came into the\r\nfamily! Bless God for all things, and bless every body! Walnuts, sir,\r\nwalnuts, a penny a dozen! Wouldn’t give you a bad one for the world,\r\nwhich is a great thing for a poor ’oman for to offer to do.” The\r\ndaughter was dressed in a drab great-coat, which covered her whole\r\nperson. When I saw the mother, she carried a similar great-coat, as\r\nshe was on her way to the stall; and she used it as ladies do their\r\nmuffs, burying her hands in it. The mother’s dark-coloured old clothes\r\nseemed, to borrow a description from Sir Walter Scott, flung on with\r\na pitchfork. These two women were at first very suspicious, and could\r\nnot be made to understand my object in questioning them; but after a\r\nlittle while, the mother became not only communicative, but garrulous,\r\nconversing--with no small impatience at any interruption--of the doings\r\nof the people in her neighbourhood. I was accompanied by an intelligent\r\ncostermonger, who assured me of his certitude that the old woman’s\r\nstatement was perfectly correct, and I found moreover from other\r\ninquiries that it was so.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” she began, “what is it that you want of me? Do I owe\r\nyou anything? There’s half-pay officers about here for no good; what\r\nis it you want? Hold your tongue, you young fool,” (to her daughter,\r\nwho was beginning to speak;) “what do you know about it?” [On my\r\nsatisfying her that I had no desire to injure her, she continued to\r\nsay after spitting, a common practice with her class, on a piece of\r\nmoney, “for luck,”] “Certainly, sir, that’s very proper and good. Aye,\r\nI’ve seen the world--the town world and the country. I don’t know\r\nwhere I was born; never mind about that--it’s nothing to nobody. I\r\ndon’t know nothing about my father and mother; but I know that afore\r\nI was eleven I went through the country with my missis. She was a\r\nsmuggler. I didn’t know then what smuggling was--bless you, sir, I\r\ndidn’t; I knew no more nor I know who made that lamp-post. I didn’t\r\nknow the taste of the stuff we smuggled for two years--didn’t know it\r\nfrom small beer; I’ve known it well enough since, God knows. My missis\r\nmade a deal of money that time at Deptford Dockyard. The men wasn’t\r\npaid and let out till twelve of a night--I hardly mind what night it\r\nwas, days was so alike then--and they was our customers till one,\r\ntwo, or three in the morning--Sunday morning, for anything I know. I\r\ndon’t know what my missis gained; something jolly, there’s not a fear\r\nof it. She was kind enough to me. I don’t know how long I was with\r\nmissis. After that I was a hopping, and made my 15_s._ regular at it,\r\nand a haymaking; but I’ve had a pitch at my corner for thirty-eight\r\nyear--aye! turned thirty-eight. It’s no use asking me what I made at\r\nfirst--I can’t tell; but I’m sure I made more than twice as much as my\r\ndaughter and me makes now, the two of us. I wish people that thinks\r\nwe’re idle now were with me for a day. I’d teach them. I don’t--that’s\r\nthe two of us don’t--make 15_s._ a week now, nor the half of it, when\r\nall’s paid. D--d if I do. The d--d boys take care of that.” [Here I\r\nhad a statement of the boys’ tradings, similar to what I have given.]\r\n“There’s ‘Canterbury’ has lots of boys, and they bother me. I can tell,\r\nand always could, how it is with working men. When mechanics is in\r\ngood work, their children has halfpennies to spend with me. If they’re\r\nhard up, there’s no halfpennies. The pennies go to a loaf or to buy a\r\ncandle. I might have saved money once, but had a misfortunate family.\r\nMy husband? O, never mind about him. D--n him. I’ve been a widow many\r\nyears. My son--it’s nothing how many children I have--is married; he\r\nhad the care of an ingine. But he lost it from ill health. It was in\r\na feather-house, and the flue got down his throat, and coughed him;\r\nand so he went into the country, 108 miles off, to his wife’s mother.\r\nBut his wife’s mother got her living by wooding, and other ways, and\r\ncouldn’t help him or his wife; so he left, and he’s with me now. He\r\nhas a job sometimes with a greengrocer, at 6_d._ a day and a bit of\r\ngrub; a little bit--very. I must shelter him. I couldn’t turn him out.\r\nIf a Turk I knew was in distress, and I had only half a loaf, I’d\r\ngive him half of that, if he was ever such a Turk--I would, sir! Out\r\nof 6_d._ a day, my son--poor fellow, he’s only twenty-seven!--wants a\r\nbit of ’baccy and a pint of beer. It ’ud be unnatural to oppose that,\r\nwouldn’t it, sir? He frets about his wife, that’s staying with her\r\nmother, 108 miles off; and about his little girl; but I tell him to\r\nwait, and he may have more little girls. God knows, they come when\r\nthey’re not wanted a bit. I joke and say all my old sweethearts is\r\ndying away. Old Jemmy went off sudden. He lent me money sometimes, but\r\nI always paid him. He had a public once, and had some money when he\r\ndied. I saw him the day afore he died. He was in bed, but wasn’t his\r\nown man quite; though he spoke sensible enough to me. He said, said\r\nhe, ‘Won’t you have half a quartern of rum, as we’ve often had it?’\r\n‘Certainly, Jemmy,’ says I, ‘I came for that very thing.’ Poor fellow!\r\nhis friends are quarrelling now about what he left. It’s 56_l._ they\r\nsay, and they’ll go to law very likely, and lose every thing. There’ll\r\nbe no such quarrelling when I die, unless it is for the pawn-tickets.\r\nI get a meal now, and got a meal afore; but it was a better meal then,\r\nsir. Then look at my expenses. I was a customer once. I used to buy,\r\nand plenty such did, blue cloth aprons, opposite Drury-lane theatre:\r\nthe very shop’s there still, but I don’t know what it is now; I can’t\r\ncall to mind. I gave 2_s._ 6_d._ a yard, from twenty to thirty years\r\nago, for an apron, and it took two yards, and I paid 4_d._ for making\r\nit, and so an apron cost 5_s._ 4_d._--that wasn’t much thought of in\r\nthose times. I used to be different off then. I never go to church; I\r\nused to go when I was a little child at Sevenoaks. I suppose I was born\r\nsomewhere thereabouts. I’ve forgot what the inside of a church is like.\r\nThere’s no costermongers ever go to church, except the rogues of them,\r\nthat wants to appear good. I buy my fruit at Covent-garden. Apples is\r\nnow 4_s._ 6_d._ a bushel there. I may make twice that in selling them;\r\nbut a bushel may last me two, three, or four days.”\r\n\r\nAs I have already, under the street-sale of fish, given an account of\r\nthe oyster stall-keeper, as well as the stationary dealers in sprats,\r\nand the principal varieties of wet fish, there is no necessity for me\r\nto continue this part of my subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now, in a measure, finished with the metropolitan\r\ncostermongers. We have seen that the street-sellers of fish, fruit, and\r\nvegetables constitute a large proportion of the London population;\r\nthe men, women, and children numbering at the least 30,000, and taking\r\nas much as 2,000,000_l._ per annum. We have seen, moreover, that these\r\nare the principal purveyors of food to the poor, and that consequently\r\nthey are as important a body of people as they are numerous. Of all\r\nclasses they _should_ be the most honest, since the poor, least of\r\nall, can afford to be cheated; and yet it has been shown that the\r\nconsciences of the London costermongers, generally speaking, are as\r\nlittle developed as their intellects; indeed, the moral and religious\r\nstate of these men is a foul disgrace to us, laughing to scorn our zeal\r\nfor the “propagation of the gospel in _foreign_ parts,” and making\r\nour many societies for the civilization of savages on the other side\r\nof the globe appear like a “delusion, a mockery, and a snare,” when\r\nwe have so many people sunk in the lowest depths of barbarism round\r\nabout our very homes. It is well to have Bishops of New Zealand when we\r\nhave Christianized all _our own_ heathen; but with 30,000 individuals,\r\nin merely _one_ of our cities, utterly creedless, mindless, and\r\nprincipleless, surely it would look more like earnestness on our parts\r\nif we created Bishops of the New-Cut, and sent “right reverend fathers”\r\nto watch over the “cure of souls” in the Broadway and the Brill. If our\r\nsense of duty will not rouse us to do this, at least our regard for our\r\nown interests should teach us, that it is not safe to allow this vast\r\ndungheap of ignorance and vice to seethe and fester, breeding a social\r\npestilence in the very heart of our land. That the costermongers belong\r\nessentially to the dangerous classes none can doubt; and those who know\r\na coster’s hatred of a “crusher,” will not hesitate to believe that\r\nthey are, as they themselves confess, one and all ready, upon the least\r\ndisturbance, to seize and disable their policeman.\r\n\r\nIt would be a marvel indeed if it were otherwise. Denied the right of\r\ngetting a living by the street authorities, after having, perhaps, been\r\nsupplied with the means of so doing by the parish authorities--the\r\nstock which the one had provided seized and confiscated by the\r\nother--law seems to them a mere farce, or at best, but the exercise\r\nof an arbitrary and despotic power, against which they consider\r\nthemselves justified, whenever an opportunity presents itself, of using\r\nthe same physical force as it brings to bear against them. That they\r\nare ignorant and vicious as they are, surely is not their fault. If\r\nwe were all born with learning and virtue, then might we, with some\r\nshow of justice, blame the costermongers for their want of both; but\r\nseeing that even the most moral and intelligent of us owe the greater\r\npart, if not the whole, of our wisdom and goodness to the tuition of\r\nothers, we must not in the arrogance of our self-conceit condemn these\r\nmen because they are not like ourselves, when it is evident that we\r\nshould have been as they are, had not some one done for us what we\r\nrefuse to do for them. We leave them destitute of all perception of\r\nbeauty, and therefore without any means of pleasure but through their\r\nappetites, and then we are surprized to find their evenings are passed\r\neither in brutalizing themselves with beer, or in gloating over the\r\nmimic sensuality of the “penny gaff.” Without the least intellectual\r\nculture is it likely, moreover, that they should have that perception\r\nof antecedents and consequents which enables us to see in the shadows\r\nof the past the types of the future--or that power of projecting the\r\nmind into the space, as it were, of time, which we in Saxon-English\r\ncall fore-sight, and in Anglo-Latin pro-vidence--a power so godlike\r\nthat the latter term is often used by us to express the Godhead itself?\r\nIs it possible, then, that men who are as much creatures of the present\r\nas the beasts of the field--instinctless animals--should have the least\r\nfaculty of pre-vision? or rather is it not natural that, following\r\nthe most precarious of all occupations--one in which the subsistence\r\ndepends upon the weather of this the most variable climate of any--they\r\nshould fail to make the affluence of the fine days mitigate the\r\nstarvation of the rainy ones? or that their appetites, made doubly\r\neager by the privations suffered in their adversity, should be indulged\r\nin all kinds of excess in their prosperity--their lives being thus, as\r\nit were, a series of alternations between starvation and surfeit?\r\n\r\nThe fate of children brought up amid the influence of such scenes--with\r\nparents starving one week and drunk all the next--turned loose into\r\nthe streets as soon as they are old enough to run alone--sent out to\r\nsell in public-houses almost before they know how to put two halfpence\r\ntogether--their tastes trained to libidinism long before puberty at\r\nthe penny concert, and their passions inflamed with the unrestrained\r\nintercourse of the twopenny hops--the fate of the young, I say,\r\nabandoned to the blight of such associations as these, cannot well be\r\notherwise than it is. If the child be father to the man, assuredly it\r\ndoes not require a great effort of imagination to conceive the manhood\r\nthat such a childhood must necessarily engender.\r\n\r\nSome months back Mr. Mayhew, with a view to mitigate what appeared\r\nto him to be the chief evils of a street-seller’s life, founded “The\r\nFriendly Association of London Costermongers,” the objects of which\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To establish a Benefit and Provident Fund for insuring to each\r\nMember a small weekly allowance in Sickness or Old Age, as well as a\r\ncertain sum to his family at his death, so that the Costermongers, when\r\nincapacitated from labour, may not be forced to seek parochial relief,\r\nnor, at their decease, be left to be buried by the parish.\r\n\r\n2. To institute a Penny Savings’ Bank and Winter Fund, where the\r\nsmallest deposits will be received and bear interest, so that the\r\nCostermongers may be encouraged to lay by even the most trivial sums,\r\nnot only as a provision for future comfort, but as the means of\r\nassisting their poorer brethren with future loans.\r\n\r\n3. To form a Small Loan Fund for supplying the more needy Costermongers\r\nwith Stock-Money, &c., at a fair and legitimate interest, instead of\r\nthe exorbitant rates that are now charged.\r\n\r\n4. To promote the use of full weights and measures by every Member of\r\nthe Association, as well as a rigid inspection of the scales, &c., of\r\nall other Costermongers, so that the honestly disposed Street-sellers\r\nmay be protected, and the public secured against imposition.\r\n\r\n5. To protect the Costermongers from interference when lawfully\r\npursuing their calling, by placing it in their power to employ counsel\r\nto defend them, if unjustly prosecuted.\r\n\r\n6. To provide harmless, if not rational, amusements at the same\r\ncheap rate as the pernicious entertainments now resorted to by the\r\nStreet-sellers.\r\n\r\n7. To adopt means for the gratuitous education of the children of the\r\nCostermongers, in the day time, and the men and women themselves in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThis institution remains at present comparatively in abeyance, from the\r\nwant of funds to complete the preliminary arrangements. Those, however,\r\nwho may feel inclined to contribute towards its establishment, will\r\nplease to pay their subscriptions into Messrs. Twinings’ Bank, Strand,\r\nto the account of Thomas Hughes, Esq. (of 63, Upper Berkeley-street,\r\nPortman-square), who has kindly consented to act as Treasurer to the\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A PUBLIC MEETING OF STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe Association above described arose out of a meeting of costermongers\r\nand other street-folk, which was held, at my instance, on the evening\r\nof the 12th of June last, in the National Hall, Holborn. The meeting\r\nwas announced as one of “street-sellers, street-performers, and\r\nstreet-labourers,” but the costermongers were the great majority\r\npresent. The admission was by ticket, and the tickets, which were\r\nof course gratuitous, were distributed by men familiar with all the\r\nclasses invited to attend. These men found the tickets received by\r\nsome of the street-people with great distrust; others could not be\r\nmade to understand why any one should trouble himself on their behoof;\r\nothers again, cheerfully promised their attendance. Some accused\r\nthe ticket distributors with having been bribed by the Government\r\nor the police, though for what purpose was not stated. Some abused\r\nthem heartily, and some offered to treat them. At least 1,000 persons\r\nwere present at the meeting, of whom 731 presented their tickets; the\r\nothers were admitted, because they were known to the door-keepers,\r\nand had either lost their tickets or had not the opportunity to\r\nobtain them. The persons to whom cards of admission were given were\r\ninvited to write their names and callings on the backs, and the\r\ncards so received gave the following result. Costermongers, 256;\r\nfish-sellers, 28; hucksters, 23; lot-sellers, 18; street-labourers, 16;\r\npaper-sellers and workers, 13; toy-sellers, 11; ginger-beer-sellers,\r\n9; hardware-sellers, 9; general-dealers, 7; street-musicians, 5;\r\nstreet-performers, 5; cakes and pastry-sellers, fried-fish-vendors, and\r\ntinkers, each, 4; turf-vendors, street-exhibitors, strolling-players,\r\ncat’s-meat-men, water-cress-sellers, stay-lace, and cotton-sellers,\r\neach, 3; board-carriers, fruit-sellers, street-tradesmen, hawkers,\r\nstreet-greengrocers, shell-fish-vendors, poulterers, mud-larks,\r\nwire-workers, ballad-singers, crock-men, and booksellers, each, 2; the\r\ncards also gave one each of the following avocations:--fly-cage-makers,\r\nfly-paper-sellers, grinders, tripe-sellers, pattern-printers,\r\nblind-paper-cutters, lace-collar-sellers, bird-sellers, bird-trainers,\r\npen-sellers, lucifer-merchants, watch-sellers, decorators, and\r\nplay-bill-sellers. 260 cards were given in without being indorsed with\r\nany name or calling.\r\n\r\nMy object in calling this meeting was to ascertain from the men\r\nthemselves what were the grievances to which they considered themselves\r\nsubjected; what were the peculiarities and what the privations of a\r\nstreet-life. Cat-calls, and every description of discordant sound,\r\nprevailed, before the commencement of the proceedings, but there was\r\nalso perfect good-humour. Although it had been announced that all the\r\nspeakers were to address the meeting from the platform, yet throughout\r\nthe evening some man or other would occasionally essay to speak from\r\nthe body of the hall. Some of those present expressed misgivings that\r\nthe meeting was got up by the Government, or by Sir R. Peel, and\r\nthat policemen, in disguise, were in attendance. The majority showed\r\nan ignorance of the usual forms observed at public meetings, though\r\nsome manifested a thorough understanding of them. Nor was there much\r\ndelicacy observed--but, perhaps, about as much as in some assemblages\r\nof a different character--in clamouring down any prosy speaker. Many\r\npresent were without coats (for it was a warm evening), some were\r\nwithout waistcoats, many were in tatters, hats and caps were in\r\ninfinite varieties of shape and shade, while a few were well and even\r\ngenteelly dressed. The well dressed street-sellers were nearly all\r\nyoung men, and one of these wore moustachios. After I had explained,\r\namidst frequent questions and interruptions, the purpose for which\r\nI had summoned the meeting, and had assured the assembly that, to\r\nthe best of my knowledge, no policemen were present, I invited free\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that some one person should address the meeting as the\r\nrepresentative of each particular occupation. An elderly man of small\r\nstature and lively intelligent features, stood up to speak on behalf\r\nof the “paper-workers,” “flying-stationers,” and “standing-patterers.”\r\nHe said, that “for twenty-four years he had been a penny-showman, a\r\nstreet-seller, and a patterer.” He dwelt upon the difference of a\r\nstreet-life when he was young and at the present time, the difference\r\nbeing between meals and no meals; and complained that though he had\r\nbeen well educated, had friends in a respectable way of life, and had\r\nnever been accused of any dishonesty, such was the “moral brand,” of\r\nhaving been connected with a street life, that it was never got rid of.\r\nHe more than once alluded to this “moral brand.” The question was, he\r\nconcluded, in what way were they to obtain an honest livelihood, so as\r\nto keep their wives and children decently, without being buffeted about\r\nlike wild beasts in the open streets? This address was characterised\r\nby propriety in the delivery, and by the absence of any grammatical\r\ninaccuracy, or vulgarity of tone or expression.\r\n\r\nA costermonger, a quiet-looking man, tidily clad, said he was the son\r\nof a country auctioneer, now dead; and not having been brought up to\r\nany trade, he came to London to try his luck. His means were done\r\nbefore he could obtain employment; and he was in a state of starvation.\r\nAt last he was obliged to apply to the parish. The guardians took him\r\ninto the workhouse, and offered to pass him home: but as he could do no\r\ngood there, he refused to go. Whereupon, giving him a pound of bread,\r\nhe was turned into the streets, and had nowhere to lay his head. In\r\nwandering down the New-cut a costermonger questioned him, and then took\r\nhim into his house and fed him. This man kept him for a year and a\r\nhalf; he showed him how to get a living in the street trade; and when\r\nhe left, gave him 20_s._ to start with. With this sum he got a good\r\nliving directly; and he could do so now, were it not for the police,\r\nwhose conduct, he stated, was sometimes very tyrannical. He had been\r\ndragged to the station-house, for standing to serve customers, though\r\nhe obstructed nobody; the policeman, however, called it an obstruction,\r\nand he (the speaker) was fined 2_s._ 6_d._; whereupon, because he had\r\nnot the half-crown, his barrow and all it contained were taken from\r\nhim, and he had heard nothing of them since. This almost broke him\r\ndown. There was no redress for these things, and he thought they ought\r\nto be looked into.\r\n\r\nThis man spoke with considerable energy; and when he had concluded,\r\nmany costermongers shouted, at the top of their voices, that they could\r\nsubstantiate every word of what he had said.\r\n\r\nA young man, of superior appearance, said he was the son of a gentleman\r\nwho had held a commission as Lieutenant in the 20th Foot, and as\r\nCaptain in the 34th Infantry, and afterwards became Sub-director of\r\nthe Bute Docks; in which situation he died, leaving no property. He\r\n(the speaker) was a classical scholar; but having no trade, he was\r\ncompelled, after his father’s death, to come to London in search of\r\nemployment, thinking that his pen and his school acquirements would\r\nsecure it. But in this expectation he was disappointed,--though for a\r\nshort period he was earning two guineas a week in copying documents for\r\nthe House of Commons. That time was past; and he was a street-patterer\r\nnow through sheer necessity. He could say from experience that the\r\nearnings of that class were no more than from 8_s._ to 10_s._ a week.\r\nHe then declaimed at some length against the interference of the police\r\nwith the patterers, considering it harsh and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAfter some noisy and not very relevant discussion concerning the true\r\namount of a street-patterer’s earnings, a clergyman of the Established\r\nChurch, now selling stenographic cards in the street, addressed the\r\nmeeting. He observed, that in every promiscuous assembly there would\r\nalways be somebody who might be called unfortunate. Of this number he\r\nwas one; for when, upon the 5th September, 1831, he preached a funeral\r\nsermon before a fashionable congregation, upon Mr. Huskisson’s death\r\nby a railway accident, he little thought he should ever be bound over\r\nin his own recognizances in 10_l._ for obstructing the metropolitan\r\nthoroughfares. He was a native of Hackney, but in early life he went to\r\nScotland, and upon the 24th June, 1832, he obtained the presentation to\r\na small extra-parochial chapel in that country, upon the presentation\r\nof the Rev. Dr. Bell. His people embraced Irvingism, and he was\r\nobliged to leave; and in January, 1837, he came to the metropolis.\r\nHis history since that period he need not state. His occupation was\r\nwell known, and he could confirm what had been stated with regard to\r\nthe police. The Police Act provided, that all persons selling goods\r\nin the streets were to keep five feet off the pavement, the street\r\nnot being a market. He had always kept with his wares and his cards\r\nbeyond the prohibited distance of five feet; and for six years and a\r\nhalf he had sold his cards without molesting or being molested. After\r\nsome severe observations upon the police, he narrated several events\r\nin his personal history to account for his present condition, which\r\nhe attributed to misfortune and the injustice of society. In the\r\ncourse of these explanations he gave an illustration of his classical\r\nacquirements, in having detected a grammatical error in a Latin\r\ninscription upon the plate of a foundation-stone for a new church in\r\nWestminster. He wrote to the incumbent, pointing out the error, and\r\nthe incumbent asked the beadle who he was. “Oh,” said the beadle, “he\r\nis a fellow who gets his living in the streets.” This was enough. He\r\ngot no answer to his letter, though he knew the incumbent and his four\r\ncurates, and had attended his church for seven years. After dwelling\r\non the sufferings of those whose living was gained in the streets, he\r\nsaid, that if persons wished really to know anything of the character\r\nor habits of life of the very poor, of whom he was one, the knowledge\r\ncould only be had from a personal survey of their condition in their\r\nown homes. He ended, by expressing his hope that by better treatment,\r\nand an earnest attention--moral, social, and religious--to their\r\ncondition, the poor of the streets might be gathered to the church, and\r\nto God.\r\n\r\nA “wandering musician” in a Highland garb, worn and dirty, complained\r\nat some length of the way in which he was treated by the police.\r\n\r\nA hale-looking man, a costermonger, of middle age--who said he had\r\na wife and four children dependent upon him--then spoke. It was a\r\npositive fact, he said, notwithstanding their poverty, their hardships,\r\nand even their degradation in the eyes of some, that the first markets\r\nin London were mainly supported by costermongers. What would the Duke\r\nof Bedford’s market in Covent-garden be without them? This question\r\nelicited loud applause.\r\n\r\nSeveral other persons followed with statements of a similar character,\r\nwhich were listened to with interest; but from their general sameness\r\nit is not necessary to repeat them here. After occupying nearly four\r\nhours, the proceedings were brought to a close by a vote of thanks, and\r\nthe “street-sellers, performers, and labourers,” separated in a most\r\norderly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-IRISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish street-sellers are both a numerous and peculiar class of\r\npeople. It therefore behoves me, for the due completeness of this work,\r\nto say a few words upon their numbers, earnings, condition, and mode of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe number of Irish street-sellers in the metropolis has increased\r\ngreatly of late years. One gentleman, who had every means of being\r\nwell-informed, considered that it was not too much to conclude, that,\r\nwithin these five years, the numbers of the poor Irish people who gain\r\na scanty maintenance, or what is rather a substitute for a maintenance,\r\nby trading, or begging, or by carrying on the two avocations\r\nsimultaneously in the streets of London, had been doubled in number.\r\n\r\nI found among the English costermongers a general dislike of the Irish.\r\nIn fact, next to a policeman, a genuine London costermonger hates an\r\nIrishman, considering him an intruder. Whether there be any traditional\r\nor hereditary ill-feeling between them, originating from a clannish\r\nfeeling, I cannot ascertain. The costermongers whom I questioned had no\r\nknowledge of the feelings or prejudices of their predecessors, but I am\r\ninclined to believe that the prejudice is modern, and has originated in\r\nthe great influx of Irishmen and women, intermixing, more especially\r\nduring the last five years, with the costermonger’s business. An Irish\r\ncostermonger, however, is no novelty in the streets of London. “From\r\nthe mention of the costardmonger,” says Mr. Charles Knight, “in the old\r\ndramatists, he appears to have been frequently an Irishman.”\r\n\r\nOf the Irish street-sellers, at present, it is computed that there\r\nare, including men, women, and children, upwards of 10,000. Assuming\r\nthe street-sellers attending the London fish and green markets to be,\r\nwith their families, 30,000 in number, and 7 in every 20 of these to\r\nbe Irish, we shall have rather more than the total above given. Of\r\nthis large body three-fourths sell only fruit, and more especially\r\nnuts and oranges; indeed, the orange-season is called the “Irishman’s\r\nharvest.” The others deal in fish, fruit, and vegetables, but these are\r\nprincipally men. Some of the most wretched of the street-Irish deal in\r\nsuch trifles as lucifer-matches, water-cresses, &c.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the great mass of these people have been connected,\r\nin some capacity or other, with the culture of the land in Ireland.\r\nThe mechanics who have sought the metropolis from the sister kingdom\r\nhave become mixed with their respective handicrafts in England, some\r\nof the Irish--though only a few--taking rank with the English skilled\r\nlabourers. The greater part of the Irish artizans who have arrived\r\nwithin the last five years are to be found among the most degraded\r\nof the tailors and shoemakers who work at the East-end for the\r\nslop-masters.\r\n\r\nA large class of the Irish who were agricultural labourers in their\r\ncountry are to be found among the men working for bricklayers, as well\r\nas among the dock-labourers and excavators, &c. Wood chopping is an\r\noccupation greatly resorted to by the Irish in London. Many of the\r\nIrish, however, who are not regularly employed in their respective\r\ncallings, resort to the streets when they cannot obtain work otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Irish women and girls who sell fruit, &c., in the streets, depend\r\nalmost entirely on that mode of traffic for their subsistence. They\r\nare a class not sufficiently taught to avail themselves of the\r\nordinary resources of women in the humbler walk of life. Unskilled\r\nat their needles, working for slop employers, even at the commonest\r\nshirt-making, is impossible to them. Their ignorance of household work,\r\nmoreover (for such description of work is unknown in their wretched\r\ncabins in many parts of Ireland), incapacitates them in a great\r\nmeasure for such employments as “charing,” washing, and ironing, as\r\nwell as from regular domestic employment. Thus there seems to remain\r\nto them but one thing to do--as, indeed, was said to me by one of\r\nthemselves--viz., “to sell for a ha’pinny the three apples which cost a\r\nfarruthing.”\r\n\r\nVery few of these women (nor, indeed, of the men, though rather more\r\nof them than the women) can read, and they are mostly all wretchedly\r\npoor; but the women present two characteristics which distinguish them\r\nfrom the London costerwomen generally--they are chaste, and, unlike the\r\n“coster girls,” very seldom form any connection without the sanction\r\nof the marriage ceremony. They are, moreover, attentive to religious\r\nobservances.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Irish street-sellers of both sexes beg, and often\r\nvery eloquently, as they carry on their trade; and I was further\r\nassured, that, but for this begging, some of them might starve outright.\r\n\r\nThe greater proportion of the Irish street-sellers are from Leinster\r\nand Munster, and a considerable number come from Connaught.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE MADE THE IRISH TURN COSTERMONGERS.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prejudices of the English costers, I am of opinion\r\nthat the Irishmen and women who have become costermongers, belong to a\r\nbetter class than the Irish labourers. The Irishman may readily adapt\r\nhimself, in a strange place, to labour, though not to trade; but these\r\ncosters are--or the majority at least are--poor persevering traders\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligent and prosperous of the street-Irish are those who\r\nhave “risen”--for so I heard it expressed--“into regular costers.” The\r\nuntaught Irishmen’s capabilities, as I have before remarked, with all\r\nhis powers of speech and quickness of apprehension, are far less fitted\r\nfor “buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest” than for\r\nmere physical employment. Hence those who take to street-trading for\r\na living seldom prosper in it, and three-fourths of the street-Irish\r\nconfine their dealings to such articles as are easy of sale, like\r\napples, nuts, or oranges, for they are rarely masters of purchasing to\r\nadvantage, and seem to know little about tale or measure, beyond the\r\nmost familiar quantities. Compared with an acute costermonger, the mere\r\napple-seller is but as the labourer to the artizan.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal causes why the Irish costermongers have increased\r\nso extensively of late years, is to be found in the fact that the\r\nlabouring classes, (and of them chiefly the class employed in the\r\nculture of land,) have been driven over from “the sister Isle” more\r\nthickly for the last four or five years than formerly. Several\r\ncircumstances have conspired to effect this.--First, they were driven\r\nover by the famine, when they could not procure, or began to fear that\r\nsoon they could not procure, food to eat. Secondly, they were forced\r\nto take refuge in this country by the evictions, when their landlords\r\nhad left them no roof to shelter them in their own. (The shifts, the\r\ndevices, the plans, to which numbers of these poor creatures had\r\nrecourse, to raise the means of quitting Ireland for England--or\r\nfor anywhere--will present a very remarkable chapter at some future\r\nperiod.) Thirdly, though the better class of small farmers who have\r\nemigrated from Ireland, in hopes of “bettering themselves,” have mostly\r\nsought the shores of North America, still some who have reached this\r\ncountry have at last settled into street-sellers. And, fourthly, many\r\nwho have come over here only for the harvest have been either induced\r\nor compelled to stay.\r\n\r\nAnother main cause is, that the Irish, as labourers, can seldom\r\nobtain work all the year through, and thus the ranks of the Irish\r\nstreet-sellers are recruited every winter by the slackness of certain\r\nperiodic trades in which they are largely employed--such as hodmen,\r\ndock-work, excavating, and the like. They are, therefore, driven by\r\nwant of employment to the winter sale of oranges and nuts. These\r\ncircumstances have a doubly malefic effect, as the increase of costers\r\naccrues in the winter months, and there are consequently the most\r\nsellers when there are the fewest buyers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the cessation of work in the construction of railways,\r\ncompared with the abundance of employment which attracted so many to\r\nthis country during the railway mania, has been another fertile cause\r\nof there being so many Irish in the London streets.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of Irish women and children among street-sellers is\r\neasily accounted for--they are, as I said before, unable to do anything\r\nelse to eke out the means of their husbands or parents. A needle is as\r\nuseless in their fingers as a pen.\r\n\r\nBitterly as many of these people suffer in this country, grievous and\r\noften eloquent as are their statements, I met with _none_ who did not\r\nmanifest repugnance at the suggestion of a return to Ireland. If asked\r\nwhy they objected to return, the response was usually in the form of a\r\nquestion: “Shure thin, sir, and what good could I do there?” Neither\r\ncan I say that I heard any of these people express any love for their\r\ncountry, though they often spoke with great affection of their friends.\r\n\r\nFrom an Irish costermonger, a middle-aged man, with a physiognomy\r\nbest known as “Irish,” and dressed in corduroy trousers, with a\r\nloose great-coat, far too big for him, buttoned about him, I had the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n“I had a bit o’ land, yer honor, in County Limerick. Well, it wasn’t\r\njust a farrum, nor what ye would call a garden here, but my father\r\nlived and died on it--glory be to God!--and brought up me and my sister\r\non it. It was about an acre, and the taties was well known to be good.\r\nBut the sore times came, and the taties was afflicted, and the wife\r\nand me--I have no childer--hadn’t a bite nor a sup, but wather to\r\nlive on, and an igg or two. I filt the famine a-comin’. I saw people\r\na-feedin’ on the wild green things, and as I had not such a bad take,\r\nI got Mr. ---- (he was the head master’s agent) to give me 28_s._ for\r\npossission in quietness, and I sould some poulthry I had--their iggs\r\nwas a blessin’ to keep the life in us--I sould them in Limerick for\r\n3_s._ 3_d._--the poor things--four of them. The furnithur’ I sould to\r\nthe nabors, for somehow about 6_s._ Its the thruth I’m ay-tellin’ of\r\nyou, sir, and there’s 2_s._ owin’ of it still, and will be a perpitual\r\nloss. The wife and me walked to Dublin, though we had betther have\r\ngone by the ‘long say,’ but I didn’t understand it thin, and we got\r\nto Liverpool. Then sorrow’s the taste of worruk could I git, beyant\r\noncte 3_s._ for two days harrud porthering, that broke my back half in\r\ntwo. I was tould I’d do betther in London, and so, glory be to God! I\r\nhave--perhaps I have. I knew Mr. ----, he porthers at Covent-garden,\r\nand I made him out, and hilped him in any long distance of a job.\r\nAs I’d been used to farrumin’ I thought it good raison I should be\r\na costermonger, as they call it here. I can read and write too. And\r\nsome good Christian--the heavens light him to glory when he’s gone!--I\r\ndon’t know who he was--advanced me 10_s._--or he gave it me, so to\r\nspake, through Father ----,” (a Roman Catholic priest.) “We earrun what\r\nkeeps the life in us. I don’t go to markit, but buy of a fair dealin’\r\nman--so I count him--though he’s harrud sometimes. I can’t till how\r\nmany Irishmen is in the thrade. There’s many has been brought down to\r\nit by the famin’ and the changes. I don’t go much among the English\r\nstreet-dalers. They talk like haythens. I never miss mass on a Sunday,\r\nand they don’t know what the blissed mass manes. I’m almost glad I\r\nhave no childer, to see how they’re raired here. Indeed, sir, they’re\r\nnot raired at all--they run wild. They haven’t the fear of God or the\r\nsaints. They’d hang a praste--glory be to God! they would.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE STREET-IRISH DISPLANTED THE STREET-JEWS IN THE ORANGE TRADE.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, in the streets, while acting as costermongers, never “worked\r\na barrow,” nor dealt in the more ponderous and least profitable\r\narticles of the trade, such as turnips and cabbages. They however, had,\r\nat one period, the chief possession of a portion of the trade which the\r\n“regular hands” do not consider proper costermongering, and which is\r\nnow chiefly confined to the Irish--viz.: orange selling.\r\n\r\nThe trade was, not many years ago, confined almost entirely to the\r\nJew boys, who kept aloof from the vagrant lads of the streets, or\r\nmixed with them only in the cheap theatres and concert-rooms. A\r\nperson who had had great experience at what was, till recently, one\r\nof the greatest “coaching inns,” told me that, speaking within his\r\nown recollection and from his own observation, he thought the sale\r\nof oranges was not so much in the hands of the Jew lads until about\r\nforty years back. The orange monopoly, so to speak, was established by\r\nthe street-Jews, about 1810, or three or four years previous to that\r\ndate, when recruiting and local soldiering were at their height, and\r\nwhen a great number of the vagabond or “roving” population, who in one\r\ncapacity or other now throng the streets, were induced to enlist. The\r\nyoung Jews never entered the ranks of the army. The streets were thus\r\nin a measure cleared for them, and the itinerant orange-trade fell\r\nalmost entirely into their hands. Some of the young Jews gained, I\r\nam assured, at least 100_l._ a year in this traffic. The numbers of\r\ncountry people who hastened to London on the occasion of the Allied\r\nSovereigns’ visit in 1814--many wealthy persons then seeing the capital\r\nfor the first time--afforded an excellent market to these dealers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the perseverance of the Jew orange boys was not to be\r\novercome; they would follow a man who even looked encouragingly\r\nat their wares for a mile or two. The great resort of these Jew\r\ndealers--who eschewed night-work generally, and left the theatre-doors\r\nto old men and women of all ages--was at the coaching inns; for year\r\nby year, after the peace of 1815, the improvement of the roads and the\r\nconsequent increase of travellers to London, progressed.\r\n\r\nAbout 1825, as nearly as my informant could recollect, these keen\r\nyoung traders began to add the sale of other goods to their oranges,\r\npressing them upon the notice of those who were leaving or visiting\r\nLondon by the different coaches. So much was this the case, that it\r\nwas a common remark at that time, that no one could reach or leave\r\nthe metropolis, even for the shortest journey, without being expected\r\nto be in urgent want of oranges and lemons, black-lead pencils,\r\nsticks of sealing-wax, many-bladed pen-knives, pocket-combs, razors,\r\nstrops, braces, and sponges. To pursue the sale of the last-mentioned\r\narticles--they being found, I presume, to be more profitable--some of\r\nthe street-Jews began to abandon the sale of oranges and lemons; and it\r\nwas upon this, that the trade was “taken up” by the wives and children\r\nof the Irish bricklayers’ labourers, and of other Irish work-people\r\nthen resident in London. The numbers of Irish in the metropolis at that\r\ntime began to increase rapidly; for twenty years ago, they resorted\r\nnumerously to England to gather in the harvest, and those who had been\r\nemployed in contiguous counties during the autumn, made for London in\r\nthe winter. “I can’t say they were well off, sir,” said one man to\r\nme, “but they liked bread and herrings, or bread and tea--better than\r\npotatoes without bread at home.” From 1836 to 1840, I was informed,\r\nthe Irish gradually superseded the Jews in the fruit traffic about\r\nthe coaching-houses. One reason for this was, that they were far\r\nmore eloquent, begging pathetically, and with many benedictions on\r\ntheir listeners. The Jews never begged, I was told; “they were merely\r\ntraders.” Another reason was, that the Irish, men or lads, who had\r\nentered into the fruit trade in the coach-yards, would not only\r\nsell and beg, but were ready to “lend a hand” to any over-burthened\r\ncoach-porter. This the Jews never did, and in that way the people of\r\nthe yard came to encourage the Irish to the prejudice of the Jews. At\r\npresent, I understand that, with the exception of one or two in the\r\ncity, no Jews vend oranges in the streets, and that the trade is almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Irish.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the Irish could supersede and even undersell the\r\nJews and regular costermongers was this, as I am informed on excellent\r\nauthority:--Father Mathew, a dozen years back, made temperance\r\nsocieties popular in Ireland. Many of the itinerant Irish, especially\r\nthe younger classes, were “temperance men.” Thus the Irish could live\r\nas sparely as the Jew, but they did not, like him, squander any money\r\nfor the evening’s amusement, at the concert or the theatre.\r\n\r\nI inquired what might be the number of the Jews plying, so to speak, at\r\nthe coaching inns, and was assured that it was less numerous than was\r\ngenerally imagined. One man computed it at 300 individuals, all under\r\n21; another at only 200; perhaps the mean, or 250, might be about the\r\nmark. The number was naturally considered greater, I was told, because\r\nthe same set of street traders were seen over and over again. The\r\nJews knew when the coaches were to arrive and when they started, and\r\nthey would hurry, after availing themselves of a departure, from one\r\ninn--the Belle Sauvage, Ludgate-hill, for instance--to take advantage\r\nof an arrival at another--say the Saracen’s Head, Snow-hill. Thus they\r\nappeared everywhere, but were the same individuals.\r\n\r\nI inquired to what calling the youthful Jews, thus driven from their\r\npartially monopolized street commerce, had devoted themselves, and was\r\ntold that even when the orange and hawking trade was at the best, the\r\nJews rarely carried it on after they were twenty-two or twenty-three,\r\nbut that they then resorted to some more wholesale calling, such as the\r\npurchase of nuts or foreign grapes, at public sales. At present, I am\r\ninformed, they are more thickly than ever engaged in these trades, as\r\nwell as in two new avocations, that have been established within these\r\nfew years,--the sale of the Bahama pine-apples and of the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese onions.\r\n\r\nAbout the Royal Exchange, Jew boys still hawk pencils, etc., but the\r\nnumber engaged in this pursuit throughout London is not, as far as I\r\ncan ascertain, above one-eighth--if an eighth--of what it was even\r\ntwelve years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RELIGION OF THE STREET-IRISH.\r\n\r\nHaving now given a brief sketch as to how the Irish people have come\r\nto form so large a proportion of the London street-sellers, I shall\r\nproceed, as I did with the English costermongers, to furnish the reader\r\nwith a short account of their religious, moral, intellectual, and\r\nphysical condition, so that he may be able to contrast the habits and\r\ncircumstances of the one class with those of the other. First, of the\r\nreligion of the Irish street-folk.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the street-Irish are Roman Catholics. Of course I can but\r\nspeak generally; but during my inquiry I met with only two who said\r\nthey were Protestants, and when I came to converse with them, I found\r\nout that they were partly ignorant of, and partly indifferent to, any\r\nreligion whatever. An Irish Protestant gentleman said to me: “You may\r\ndepend upon it, if ever you meet any of my poor countrymen who will\r\nnot talk to you about religion, they either know or care nothing about\r\nit; for the religious spirit runs high in Ireland, and Protestants and\r\nCatholics are easily led to converse about their faith.”\r\n\r\nI found that _some_ of the Irish Roman Catholics--but they had been for\r\nmany years resident in England, and that among the poorest or vagrant\r\nclass of the English--had become indifferent to their creed, and did\r\nnot attend their chapels, unless at the great fasts or festivals, and\r\nthis they did only occasionally. One old stall-keeper, who had been in\r\nLondon nearly thirty years, said to me: “Ah! God knows, sir, I ought\r\nto attend mass every Sunday, but I haven’t for a many years, barrin’\r\nChristmas-day and such times. But I’ll thry and go more rigular, plase\r\nGod.” This man seemed to resent, as a sort of indignity, my question if\r\nhe ever attended any other place of worship. “Av coorse not!” was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nOne Irishman, also a fruit-seller, with a well-stocked barrow, and\r\nwithout the complaint of poverty common among his class, entered\r\nkeenly into the subject of his religious faith when I introduced it.\r\nHe was born in Ireland, but had been in England since he was five or\r\nsix. He was a good-looking, fresh-coloured man, of thirty or upwards,\r\nand could read and write well. He spoke without bitterness, though\r\nzealously enough. “Perhaps, sir, you are a gintleman connected with\r\nthe Protistant clargy,” he asked, “or a missionary?” On my stating\r\nthat I had no claim to either character, he resumed: “Will, sir,\r\nit don’t matther. All the worruld may know my riligion, and I wish\r\nall the worruld was of my riligion, and betther min in it than I\r\nam; I do, indeed. I’m a Roman Catholic, sir;” [here he made the\r\nsign of the cross]; “God be praised for it! O yis, I know all about\r\nCardinal Wiseman. It’s the will of God, I feel sure, that he’s to be\r\n’stablished here, and it’s no use ribillin’ against that. I’ve nothing\r\nto say against Protistints. I’ve heard it said, ‘It’s best to pray\r\nfor them.’ The street-people that call thimselves Protistants are no\r\nriligion at all at all. I serruve Protistant gintlemen and ladies too,\r\nand sometimes they talk to me kindly about religion. They’re good\r\ncusthomers, and I have no doubt good people. I can’t say what their lot\r\nmay be in another worruld for not being of the true faith. No, sir,\r\nI’ll give no opinions--none.”\r\n\r\nThis man gave me a clear account of his belief that the Blessed Virgin\r\n(he crossed himself repeatedly as he spoke) was the mother of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, and was a mediator with our Lord, who was God of heaven\r\nand earth--of the duty of praying to the holy saints--of attending\r\nmass--(“but the priest,” he said, “won’t exact too much of a poor\r\nman, either about that or about fasting”)--of going to confession at\r\nEaster and Christmas times, at the least--of receiving the body of\r\nChrist, “the rale prisince,” in the holy sacrament--of keeping all\r\nGod’s commandments--of purgatory being a purgation of sins--and of\r\nheaven and hell. I found the majority of those I spoke with, at least\r\nas earnest in their faith, if they were not as well instructed in it\r\nas my informant, who may be cited as an example of the better class of\r\nstreet-sellers.\r\n\r\nAnother Irishman,--who may be taken as a type of the less informed,\r\nand who had been between two and three years in England, having\r\nbeen disappointed in emigrating to America with his wife and two\r\nchildren,--gave me the following account, but not without considering\r\nand hesitating. He was a very melancholy looking man, tall and spare,\r\nand decently clad. He and his family were living upon 8_d._ a day,\r\nwhich he earned by sweeping a crossing. He had been prevented by ill\r\nhealth from earning 2_l._, which he could have made, he told me, in\r\nharvest time, as a store against winter. He had been a street-seller,\r\nand so had his wife; and she would be so again as soon as he could\r\nraise 2_s._ to buy her a stock of apples. He said, touching his hat at\r\neach holy name,--\r\n\r\n“Sure, yis, sir, I’m a Roman Cartholic, and go to mass every Sunday.\r\nJesus Christ? O yis,” (hesitating, but proceeding readily after a word\r\nof prompting), “he is the Lord our Saviour, and the Son of the Holy\r\nVirgin. The blessed saints? Yis, sir, yis. The praste prays for them.\r\nI--I mane prays to them. O yis. I pray to them mysilf ivery night for a\r\nblissin’, and to rise me out of my misery. No, sir, I can’t say I know\r\nwhat the mass is about. I don’t know what I’m prayin’ for thin, only\r\nthat it’s right. A poor man, that can neither read nor write--I wish I\r\ncould and I might do betther--can’t understand it; it’s all in Latin.\r\nI’ve heard about Cardinal Wiseman. It’ll do us no good sir; it’ll only\r\nset people more against us. But it ain’t poor min’s fault.”\r\n\r\nAs I was anxious to witness the religious zeal that characterizes\r\nthese people, I obtained permission to follow one of the priests as\r\nhe made his rounds among his flock. Everywhere the people ran out to\r\nmeet him. He had just returned to them I found, and the news spread\r\nround, and women crowded to their door-steps, and came creeping up from\r\nthe cellars through the trap-doors, merely to curtsey to him. One old\r\ncrone, as he passed, cried, “You’re a good father, Heaven comfort you,”\r\nand the boys playing about stood still to watch him. A lad, in a man’s\r\ntail coat and a shirt-collar that nearly covered in his head--like the\r\npaper round a bouquet--was fortunate enough to be noticed, and his eyes\r\nsparkled, as he touched his hair at each word he spoke in answer. At a\r\nconversation that took place between the priest and a woman who kept\r\na dry fish-stall, the dame excused herself for not having been up to\r\ntake tea “with his rivirince’s mother lately, for thrade had been so\r\nbisy, and night was the fullest time.” Even as the priest walked along\r\nthe street, boys running at full speed would pull up to touch their\r\nhair, and the stall-women would rise from their baskets; while all\r\nnoise--even a quarrel--ceased until he had passed by. Still there was\r\nno look of fear in the people. He called them all by their names, and\r\nasked after their families, and once or twice the “father” was taken\r\naside and held by the button while some point that required his advice\r\nwas whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\nThe religious fervour of the people whom I saw was intense. At one\r\nhouse that I entered, the woman set me marvelling at the strength of\r\nher zeal, by showing me how she contrived to have in her sitting-room\r\na sanctuary to pray before every night and morning, and even in the\r\nday, “when she felt weary and lonesome.” The room was rudely enough\r\nfurnished, and the only decent table was covered with a new piece of\r\nvarnished cloth; still before a rude print of our Saviour there were\r\nplaced two old plated candlesticks, pink, with the copper shining\r\nthrough; and here it was that she told her beads. In her bed-room, too,\r\nwas a coloured engraving of the “Blessed Lady,” which she never passed\r\nwithout curtseying to.\r\n\r\nOf course I detail these matters as mere facts, without desiring to\r\noffer any opinion here, either as to the benefit or otherwise of the\r\ncreed in question. As I had shown how the English costermonger neither\r\nhad nor knew any religion whatever, it became my duty to give the\r\nreader a view of the religion of the Irish street-sellers. In order\r\nto be able to do so as truthfully as possible, I placed myself in\r\ncommunication with those parties who were in a position to give me the\r\nbest information on the subject. The result is given above, in all the\r\nsimplicity and impartiality of history.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EDUCATION, LITERATURE, AMUSEMENTS, AND POLITICS OF THE\r\nSTREET-IRISH.\r\n\r\nThese several heads have often required from me lengthened notices,\r\nbut as regards the class I am now describing they may be dismissed\r\nbriefly enough. The majority of the street-Irish whom I saw were unable\r\nto read, but I found those who had no knowledge of reading--(and the\r\nsame remark applies to the English street-sellers as well)--regret\r\ntheir inability, and say, “I wish I could read, sir; I’d be better\r\noff now.” On the other hand, those who had a knowledge of reading and\r\nwriting, said frequently enough, “Why, yes, sir, I _can_ read and\r\nwrite, but it’s been no good to me,” as if they had been disappointed\r\nin their expectations as to the benefits attendant upon scholarship. I\r\nam inclined to think, however, that a greater anxiety exists among the\r\npoor generally, to have some schooling provided for their children,\r\nthan was the case a few years back. One Irishman attributed this to the\r\nincreased number of Roman Catholic schools, “for the more schools there\r\nare,” he said, “the more people think about schooling their children.”\r\n\r\nThe literature, or reading, of the street-Irish is, I believe, confined\r\nto Roman Catholic books, such as the “Lives of the Saints,” published\r\nin a cheap form; one, and only one, I found with the “Nation”\r\nnewspaper. The very poor have no leisure to read. During three days\r\nspent in visiting the slop-workers at the East end of the town, not so\r\nmuch as the fragment of a leaf of a book was seen.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the street-Irish are not those of the English\r\ncostermongers--though there are exceptions, of course, to the remark.\r\nThe Irish fathers and mothers do not allow their daughters, even when\r\nthey possess the means, to resort to the “penny gaffs” or the “twopenny\r\nhops,” unaccompanied by them. Some of the men frequent the beer-shops,\r\nand are inveterate drinkers and smokers too. I did not hear of any\r\namusements popular among, or much resorted to, by the Irishmen, except\r\ndancing parties at one another’s houses, where they jig and reel\r\nfuriously. They frequent raffles also, but the article is often never\r\nthrown for, and the evening is spent in dancing.\r\n\r\nI may here observe--in reference to the statement that Irish parents\r\nwill not expose their daughters to the risk of what they consider\r\ncorrupt influences--that when a young Irishwoman _does_ break through\r\nthe pale of chastity, she often becomes, as I was assured, one of the\r\nmost violent and depraved of, perhaps, _the_ most depraved class.\r\n\r\nOf politics, I think, the street-Irish understand nothing, and my own\r\nobservations in this respect were confirmed by a remark made to me by\r\nan Irish gentleman: “Their politics are either a dead letter, or the\r\npolitics of their priests.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMES OF THE STREET-IRISH.\r\n\r\nIn almost all of the poorer districts of London are to be found “nests\r\nof Irish”--as they are called--or courts inhabited solely by the Irish\r\ncostermongers. These people form separate colonies, rarely visiting or\r\nmingling with the English costers. It is curious, on walking through\r\none of these settlements, to notice the manner in which the Irish deal\r\namong themselves--street-seller buying of street-seller. Even in some\r\nof the smallest courts there may be seen stalls of vegetables, dried\r\nherrings, or salt cod, thriving, on the associative principle, by\r\nmutual support.\r\n\r\nThe parts of London that are the most thickly populated with\r\nIrish lie about Brook-street, Ratcliff-cross, down both sides\r\nof the Commercial-road, and in Rosemary-lane, though nearly\r\nall the “coster-districts” cited at p. 47, have their Irish\r\nsettlements--Cromer-street, Saffron-hill and King-street, Drury-lane,\r\nfor instance, being thickly peopled with the Irish; but the places I\r\nhave mentioned above are peculiarly distinguished, by being almost\r\nentirely peopled by visitors from the sister isle.\r\n\r\nThe same system of immigration is pursued in London as in America. As\r\nsoon as the first settler is thriving in his newly chosen country, a\r\ncertain portion of his or her earnings are carefully hoarded up, until\r\nthey are sufficient to pay for the removal of another member of the\r\nfamily to England; then one of the friends left “at home” is sent for;\r\nand thus by degrees the entire family is got over, and once more united.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no quarter of London where the habits and habitations\r\nof the Irish can be better seen and studied than in Rosemary-lane, and\r\nthe little courts and alleys that spring from it on each side. Some of\r\nthese courts have other courts branching off from them, so that the\r\nlocality is a perfect labyrinth of “blind alleys;” and when once in the\r\nheart of the maze it is difficult to find the path that leads to the\r\nmain-road. As you walk down “the lane,” and peep through the narrow\r\nopenings between the houses, the place seems like a huge peep-show,\r\nwith dark holes of gateways to look through, while the court within\r\nappears bright with the daylight; and down it are seen rough-headed\r\nurchins running with their feet bare through the puddles, and\r\nbonnetless girls, huddled in shawls, lolling against the door-posts.\r\nSometimes you see a long narrow alley, with the houses so close\r\ntogether that opposite neighbours are talking from their windows; while\r\nthe ropes, stretched zig-zag from wall to wall, afford just room enough\r\nto dry a blanket or a couple of shirts, that swell out dropsically in\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nI visited one of the paved yards round which the Irish live, and found\r\nthat it had been turned into a complete drying-ground, with shirts,\r\ngowns, and petticoats of every description and colour. The buildings at\r\nthe end were completely hidden by “the things,” and the air felt damp\r\nand chilly, and smelt of soap-suds. The gutter was filled with dirty\r\ngray water emptied from the wash-tubs, and on the top were the thick\r\nbubbles floating about under the breath of the boys “playing at boats”\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom with the inhabitants of these courts and alleys\r\nto assemble at the entrance with their baskets, and chat and smoke\r\naway the morning. Every court entrance has its little group of girls\r\nand women, lolling listlessly against the sides, with their heads\r\nuncovered, and their luxuriant hair fuzzy as oakum. It is peculiar\r\nwith the Irish women that--after having been accustomed to their\r\nhoods--they seldom wear bonnets, unless on a long journey. Nearly all\r\nof them, too, have a thick plaid shawl, which they keep on all the day\r\nthrough, with their hands covered under it. At the mouth of the only\r\nthoroughfare deserving of the name of street--for a cart could just go\r\nthrough it--were congregated about thirty men and women, who rented\r\nrooms in the houses on each side of the road. Six women, with baskets\r\nof dried herrings, were crouching in a line on the kerb-stone with the\r\nfish before them; their legs were drawn up so closely to their bodies\r\nthat the shawl covered the entire figure, and they looked very like\r\nthe podgy “tombolers” sold by the Italian boys. As all their wares\r\nwere alike, it was puzzling work to imagine how, without the strongest\r\nopposition, they could each obtain a living. The men were dressed in\r\nlong-tail coats, with one or two brass buttons. One old dame, with a\r\nface wrinkled like a dried plum, had her cloak placed over her head\r\nlike a hood, and the grisly hair hung down in matted hanks about her\r\nface, her black eyes shining between the locks like those of a Skye\r\nterrier; beside her was another old woman smoking a pipe so short that\r\nher nose reached over the bowl.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the low foreheads and long bulging upper lips of some\r\nof the group, it was pleasant to gaze upon the pretty faces of the one\r\nor two girls that lolled against the wall. Their black hair, smoothed\r\nwith grease, and shining almost as if “japanned,” and their large gray\r\neyes with the thick dark fringe of lash, seemed out of place among the\r\nhard features of their companions. It was only by looking at the short\r\npetticoats and large feet you could assure yourself that they belonged\r\nto the same class.\r\n\r\nIn all the houses that I entered were traces of household care and\r\nneatness that I had little expected to have seen. The cupboard fastened\r\nin the corner of the room, and stocked with mugs and cups, the\r\nmantelpiece with its images, and the walls covered with showy-coloured\r\nprints of saints and martyrs, gave an air of comfort that strangely\r\ndisagreed with the reports of the cabins in “ould Ireland.” As the\r\ndoors to the houses were nearly all of them kept open, I could, even\r\nwhilst walking along, gain some notion of the furniture of the homes.\r\nIn one house that I visited there was a family of five persons, living\r\non the ground floor and occupying two rooms. The boards were strewn\r\nwith red sand, and the front apartment had three beds in it, with the\r\nprinted curtains drawn closely round. In a dark room, at the back,\r\nlived the family itself. It was fitted up as a parlour, and crowded\r\nto excess with chairs and tables, the very staircase having pictures\r\nfastened against the wooden partition. The fire, although it was\r\nmidday, and a warm autumn morning, served as much for light as for\r\nheat, and round it crouched the mother, children, and visitors, bending\r\nover the flame as if in the severest winter time. In a room above this\r\nwere a man and woman lately arrived in England. The woman sat huddled\r\nup in a corner smoking, with the husband standing over her in, what\r\nappeared at first, a menacing attitude; I was informed, however, that\r\nthey were only planning for the future. This room was perfectly empty\r\nof furniture, and the once white-washed walls were black, excepting the\r\nlittle square patches which showed where the pictures of the former\r\ntenants had hung. In another room, I found a home so small and full\r\nof furniture, that it was almost a curiosity for domestic management.\r\nThe bed, with its chintz curtains looped up, filled one end of the\r\napartment, but the mattress of it served as a long bench for the\r\nvisitors to sit on. The table was so large that it divided the room in\r\ntwo, and if there was one picture there must have been thirty--all of\r\n“holy men,” with yellow glories round their heads. The window-ledge\r\nwas dressed out with crockery, and in a tumbler were placed the\r\nbeads. The old dame herself was as curious as her room. Her shawl was\r\nfastened over her large frilled cap. She had a little “button” of a\r\nnose, with the nostrils entering her face like bullet holes. She wore\r\nover her gown an old pilot coat, well-stained with fish slime, and her\r\npetticoats being short, she had very much the appearance of a Dutch\r\nfisherman or stage smuggler.\r\n\r\nHer story was affecting--made more so, perhaps, by the emotional\r\nmanner in which she related it. Nine years ago “the father” of the\r\ndistrict--“the Blissed Lady guard him!”--had found her late at night,\r\nrolling in the gutter, and the boys pelting her with orange-peel\r\nand mud. She was drunk--“the Lorrud pass by her”--and when she came\r\nto, she found herself in the chapel, lying before the sanctuary,\r\n“under the shadow of the holy cross.” Watching over her was the “good\r\nfather,” trying to bring back her consciousness. He spoke to her of\r\nher wickedness, and before she left she took the pledge of temperance.\r\nFrom that time she prospered, and the 1_s._ 6_d._ the “father” gave\r\nher “had God’s blissin’ in it,” for she became the best dressed woman\r\nin the court, and in less than three years had 15_l._ in the savings’\r\nbank, “the father--Heaven chirish him”--keeping her book for her, as\r\nhe did for other poor people. She also joined “the Association of the\r\nBlissed Lady,” (and bought herself the dress of the order “a beautiful\r\ngrane vilvit, which she had now, and which same cost her 30_s._”), and\r\nthen she was secure against want in old age and sickness. But after\r\nnine years prudence and comfort, a brother of hers returned home from\r\nthe army, with a pension of 1_s._ a day. He was wild, and persuaded\r\nher to break her pledge, and in a short time he got all her savings\r\nfrom her and spent every penny. She could’nt shake him off, “for he was\r\nthe only kin she had on airth,” and “she must love her own flish and\r\nbones.” Then began her misery. “It plased God to visit her ould limbs\r\nwith aches and throubles, and her hips swole with the cowld,” so that\r\nshe was at last forced into a hospital, and all that was left of her\r\nstore was “aten up by sufferin’s.” This, she assured me, all came about\r\nby the “good father’s” leaving that parish for another one, but now he\r\nhad returned to them again, and, with his help and God’s blessing, she\r\nwould yet prosper once more.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was in the room, the father entered, and “old Norah,”\r\nhalf-divided between joy at seeing him and shame at “being again a\r\nbeggar,” laughed and wept at the same time. She stood wiping her eyes\r\nwith the shawl, and groaning out blessings on “his rivirince’s hid,”\r\nbegging of him not “to scould her for she was a wake woman.” The\r\nrenegade brother was had in to receive a lecture from “his rivirince.”\r\nA more sottish idiotic face it would be difficult to imagine. He stood\r\nwith his hands hanging down like the paws of a dog begging, and his\r\ntwo small eyes stared in the face of the priest, as he censured him,\r\nwithout the least expression even of consciousness. Old Norah stood by,\r\ngroaning like a bagpipe, and writhing while the father spoke to her\r\n“own brother,” as though every reproach were meant for her.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that struck me during my visit to this neighbourhood,\r\nwas the apparent listlessness and lazy appearance of the people. The\r\nboys at play were the only beings who seemed to have any life in their\r\nactions. The women in their plaid shawls strolled along the pavements,\r\nstopping each friend for a chat, or joining some circle, and leaning\r\nagainst the wall as though utterly deficient in energy. The men smoked,\r\nwith their hands in their pockets, listening to the old crones talking,\r\nand only now and then grunting out a reply when a question was directly\r\nput to them. And yet it is curious that these people, who here seemed\r\nas inactive as negroes, will perform the severest bodily labour,\r\nundertaking tasks that the English are almost unfitted for.\r\n\r\nTo complete this account, I subjoin a brief description of the\r\nlodging-houses resorted to by the Irish immigrants on their arrival in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH LODGING-HOUSES FOR IMMIGRANTS.\r\n\r\nOften an Irish immigrant, whose object is to settle in London, arrives\r\nby the Cork steamer without knowing a single friend to whom he can\r\napply for house-room or assistance of any kind. Sometimes a whole\r\nfamily is landed late at night, worn out by sickness and the terrible\r\nfatigues of a three days’ deck passage, almost paralysed by exhaustion,\r\nand scarcely able to speak English enough to inquire for shelter till\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIf the immigrants, however, are bound for America, their lot is very\r\ndifferent. Then they are consigned to some agent in London, who is\r\nalways on the wharf at the time the steamer arrives, and takes the\r\nstrangers to the homes he has prepared for them until the New York\r\npacket starts. During the two or three days’ necessary stay in London,\r\nthey are provided for at the agent’s expense, and no trouble is\r\nexperienced by the travellers. A large provision-merchant in the city\r\ntold me that he often, during the season, had as many as 500 Irish\r\nconsigned to him by one vessel, so that to lead them to their lodgings\r\nwas like walking at the head of a regiment of recruits.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the immigrants in London have caused several\r\nof their countrymen to open lodging-houses in the courts about\r\nRosemary-lane; these men attend the coming in of the Cork steamer, and\r\nseek for customers among the poorest of the poor, after the manner of\r\ntouters to a sea-side hotel.\r\n\r\nThe immigrants’-houses are of two kinds--clean and dirty. The better\r\nclass of Irish lodging-houses almost startle one by the comfort and\r\ncleanliness of the rooms; for after the descriptions you hear of the\r\nstate in which the deck passengers are landed from the Irish boats,\r\ntheir clothes stained with the manure of the pigs, and drenched with\r\nthe spray, you somehow expect to find all the accommodations disgusting\r\nand unwholesome. But one in particular, that I visited, had the floor\r\nclean, and sprinkled with red sand, while the windows were sound,\r\nbright, and transparent. The hobs of the large fire-place were piled up\r\nwith bright tin pots, and the chimney piece was white and red with the\r\nchina images ranged upon it. In one corner of the principal apartment\r\nthere stood two or three boxes still corded up, and with bundles\r\nstrung to the sides, and against the wall was hung a bunch of blue\r\ncloaks, such as the Irishwomen wear. The proprietor of the house, who\r\nwas dressed in a gray tail-coat and knee-breeches, that had somewhat\r\nthe effect of a footman’s livery, told me that he had received seven\r\nlodgers the day before, but six were men, and they were all out seeking\r\nfor work. In front of the fire sat a woman, bending over it so close\r\nthat the bright cotton gown she had on smelt of scorching. Her feet\r\nwere bare, and she held the soles of them near to the bars, curling\r\nher toes about with the heat. She was a short, thick-set woman, with a\r\npair of wonderfully muscular arms crossed over her bosom, and her loose\r\nrusty hair streaming over her neck. It was in vain that I spoke to her\r\nabout her journey, for she wouldn’t answer me, but kept her round, open\r\neyes fixed on my face with a wild, nervous look, following me about\r\nwith them everywhere.\r\n\r\nAcross the room hung a line, with the newly-washed and well-patched\r\nclothes of the immigrants hanging to it, and on a side-table were\r\nthe six yellow basins that had been used for the men’s breakfasts.\r\nDuring my visit, the neighbours, having observed a strange gentleman\r\nenter, came pouring in, each proffering some fresh bit of news about\r\ntheir newly-arrived countrymen. I was nearly stunned by half-a-dozen\r\nvoices speaking together, and telling me how the poor people had been\r\nfour days “at say,” so that they were glad to get near the pigs for\r\n“warrumth,” and instructing me as to the best manner of laying out the\r\nsum of money that it was supposed I was about to shower down upon the\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nIn one of the worst class of lodging-houses I found ten human beings\r\nliving together in a small room. The apartment was entirely devoid of\r\nall furniture, excepting an old mattrass rolled up against the wall,\r\nand a dirty piece of cloth hung across one corner, to screen the women\r\nwhilst dressing. An old man, the father of five out of the ten, was\r\nseated on a tea-chest, mending shoes, and the other men were looking on\r\nwith their hands in their pockets. Two girls and a woman were huddled\r\ntogether on the floor in front of the fire, talking in Irish. All these\r\npeople seemed to be utterly devoid of energy, and the men moved about\r\nso lazily that I couldn’t help asking some of them if they had tried\r\nto obtain work. Every one turned to a good-looking young fellow lolling\r\nagainst the wall, as if they expected him to answer for them. “Ah,\r\nsure, and that they have,” was the reply; “it’s the docks they have\r\ntried, worrus luck.” The others appeared struck with the truthfulness\r\nof the answer, for they all shook their heads, and said, “Sure an’\r\nthat’s thruth, anyhow.” Here my Irish guide ventured an observation,\r\nby remarking solemnly, “It’s no use tilling a lie;” to which the whole\r\nroom assented, by exclaiming altogether, “Thrue for you, Norah.” The\r\nchosen spokesman then told me, “They paid half-a-crown a week for the\r\nroom, and that was as much as they could earrun, and it was starruve\r\nthey should if the neighbours didn’t hilp them a bit.” I asked them\r\nif they were better off over here than when in Ireland, but could\r\nget no direct answer, for my question only gave rise to a political\r\ndiscussion. “There’s plenty of food over here,” said the spokesman,\r\naddressing his companions as much as myself, “plenty of ’taties--plenty\r\nof mate--plenty of porruk.” “But where the use,” observed my guide,\r\n“if there’s no money to buy ’em wid?” to which the audience muttered,\r\n“Thrue for you again, Norah;” and so it went on, each one pleading\r\npoverty in the most eloquent style.\r\n\r\nAfter I had left, the young fellow who had acted as spokesman followed\r\nme into the street, and taking me into a corner, told me that he was\r\na “sailor by thrade, but had lost his ‘rigisthration-ticket,’ or he’d\r\nhave got a berruth long since, and that it was all for 3_s._ 6_d._ he\r\nwasn’t at say.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the number of Irish immigrants, I have obtained the\r\nfollowing information:\r\n\r\nThe great influx of the Irish into London was in the year of the\r\nfamine, 1847-8. This cannot be better shown than by citing the returns\r\nof the number of persons admitted into the Asylum for the Houseless\r\nPoor, in Playhouse-yard, Cripplegate. These returns I obtained for\r\nfourteen years, and the average number of admissions of the applicants\r\nfrom all parts during that time was 8,794 yearly. Of these, the Irish\r\naveraged 2,455 yearly, or considerably more than a fourth of the whole\r\nnumber received. The total number of applicants thus sheltered in the\r\nfourteen years was 130,625, of which the Irish numbered 34,378. The\r\nsmallest number of Irish (men, women, and children) admitted, was in\r\n1834-5, about 300; in 1846-7, it was as many as 7,576, while in 1847-8,\r\nit was 10,756, and in 1848-9, 5,068.\r\n\r\nBut it was into Liverpool that the tide of immigration flowed the\r\nstrongest, in the calamitous year of the famine. “Between the 13th\r\nJan., and the 13th Dec., both inclusive,” writes Mr. Rushton, the\r\nLiverpool magistrate, to Sir G. Grey, on the 21st April last, “296,231\r\npersons landed in this port (Liverpool) from Ireland. Of this vast\r\nnumber, about 130,000 emigrated to the United States; some 50,000 were\r\npassengers on business; and the remainder (161,231), mere paupers,\r\nhalf-naked and starving, landed, for the most part, during the winter,\r\nand became, immediately on landing, applicants for parochial relief.\r\nYou already know the immediate results of this accumulation of misery\r\nin the crowded town of Liverpool; of the cost of relief at once\r\nrendered necessary to prevent the thousands of hungry and naked Irish\r\nperishing in our streets; and also of the cost of the pestilence which\r\ngenerally follows in the train of famine and misery such as we then had\r\nto encounter.... Hundreds of patients perished, notwithstanding all\r\nefforts made to save them; and ten Roman Catholic and one Protestant\r\nclergyman, many parochial officers, and many medical men, who devoted\r\nthemselves to the task of alleviating the sufferings of the wretched,\r\ndied in the discharge of these high duties.”\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of these people were, at the same time, also conveyed\r\nfrom Ireland to Wales, especially to Newport. They were brought over\r\nby coal-vessels as a return cargo--a living ballast--2_s._ 6_d._ being\r\nthe highest fare, and were huddled together like pigs. The manager\r\nof the Newport tramp-house has stated concerning these people, “They\r\ndon’t live long, diseased as they are. They are very remarkable; they\r\nwill eat salt by basons-full, and drink a great quantity of water\r\nafter. I have frequently known those who could not have been hungry eat\r\ncabbage-leaves and other refuse from the ash-heap.”\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that I should thus briefly allude to this matter,\r\nas there is no doubt that some of these people, making their way to\r\nLondon, soon became street-sellers there, and many of them took to the\r\nbusiness subsequently, when there was no employment in harvesting,\r\nhop-picking, &c. Of the poor wretches landed at Liverpool, many (Mr.\r\nRushton states) became beggars, and many thieves. Many, there is no\r\ndoubt, tramped their way to London, sleeping at the “casual wards” of\r\nthe Unions on their way; but I believe that of those who had become\r\nhabituated to the practice of beggary or theft, few or none would\r\nfollow the occupation of street-selling, as even the half-passive\r\nindustry of such a calling would be irksome to the apathetic and\r\ndishonest.\r\n\r\nOf the immigration, direct by the vessels trading from Ireland to\r\nLondon, there are no returns such has have been collected by Mr.\r\nRushton for Liverpool, but the influx is comparatively small, on\r\naccount of the greater length and cost of the voyage. During the last\r\nyear I am informed that 15,000 or 16,000 passengers were brought\r\nfrom Ireland to London direct, and, in addition to these, 500 more\r\nwere brought over from Cork in connection with the arrangements for\r\nemigration to the United States, and consigned to the emigration\r\nagent here. Of the 15,500 (taking the mean between the two numbers\r\nabove given) 1,000 emigrated to the United States. It appears, on\r\nthe authority of Mr. Rushton, that even in the great year of the\r\nimmigration, more than one-sixth of the passengers from Ireland to\r\nDublin came on business. It may, then, be reasonable to calculate that\r\nduring last year one-fourth at least of the passengers to London had\r\nthe same object in view, leaving about 10,000 persons who have either\r\nemigrated to British North America, Australia, &c., or have resorted\r\nto some mode of subsistence in the metropolis or the adjacent parts.\r\nBesides these there are the numbers who make their way up to London,\r\ntramping it from the several provincial ports--namely, Liverpool,\r\nBristol, Newport, and Glasgow. Of these I have no means of forming\r\nany estimate, or of the proportion who adopt street-selling on their\r\narrival here--all that can be said is, that the influx of Irish into\r\nthe street-trade every year must be very considerable. I believe,\r\nhowever, that only those who “have friends in the line” resort to\r\nstreet-selling on their arrival in London, though all may make it a\r\nresource when other endeavours fail. The great immigration into London\r\nis from Cork, the average cost of a deck passage being 5_s._ The\r\nimmigrants direct to London from Cork are rarely of the poorest class.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DIET, DRINK, AND EXPENSE OF LIVING OF THE STREET-IRISH.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Irish men, women, and children, who obtain a livelihood\r\n(or what is so designated) by street-sale in London, has, I am told,\r\non good authority, experienced a change. In the lodging-houses that\r\nthey resorted to, their breakfast, two or three years ago, was a\r\ndish of potatoes--two, three, or four lbs., or more, in weight--for\r\na family. Now half an ounce of coffee (half chicory) costs 1/2_d._,\r\nand that, with the half or quarter of a loaf, according to the number\r\nin family, is almost always their breakfast at the present time. When\r\ntheir constant diet was potatoes, there were frequent squabbles at the\r\nlodging-houses--to which many of the poor Irish on their first arrival\r\nresort--as to whether the potato-pot or the tea-kettle should have the\r\npreference on the fire. A man of superior intelligence, who had been\r\ndriven to sleep and eat occasionally in lodging-houses, told me of some\r\ndialogues he had heard on these occasions:--“It’s about three years\r\nago,” he said, “since I heard a bitter old Englishwoman say, ‘To ----\r\nwith your ’taty-pot; they’re only meat for pigs.’ ‘Sure, thin,’ said\r\na young Irishman--he was a nice ’cute fellow--‘sure, thin, ma’am, I\r\nshould be afther offering you a taste.’ I heard that myself, sir. You\r\nmay have noticed, that when an Irishman doesn’t get out of temper, he\r\nnever loses his politeness, or rather his blarney.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner, or second meal of the day--assuming that there has been\r\na breakfast--ordinarily consists of cheap fish and potatoes. Of the\r\ndiet of the poor street-Irish I had an account from a little Irishman,\r\nthen keeping an oyster-stall, though he generally sold fruit. In all\r\nsuch details I have found the Irish far more communicative than the\r\nEnglish. Many a poor untaught Englishman will shrink from speaking of\r\nhis spare diet, and his trouble to procure that; a reserve, too, much\r\nmore noticeable among the men than the women. My Irish informant told\r\nme he usually had his breakfast at a lodging-house--he preferred a\r\nlodging-house, he said, on account of the warmth and the society. Here\r\nhe boiled half an ounce of coffee, costing a 1/2_d._ He purchased of\r\nhis landlady the fourth of a quartern loaf (1-1/4_d._ or 1-1/2_d._),\r\nfor she generally cut a quartern loaf into four for her single men\r\nlodgers, such as himself, clearing sometimes a farthing or two thereby.\r\nFor dinner, my informant boiled at the lodging-house two or three lbs.\r\nof potatoes, costing usually 1_d._ or 1-1/4_d._, and fried three, or\r\nfour herrings, or as many as cost a penny. He sometimes mashed his\r\npotatoes, and spread over them the herrings, the fatty portion of which\r\nflavoured the potatoes, which were further flavoured by the roes of the\r\nherrings being crushed into them. He drank water to this meal, and the\r\ncost of the whole was 2_d._ or 2-1/2_d._ A neighbouring stall-keeper\r\nattended to this man’s stock in his absence at dinner, and my informant\r\ndid the same for him in his turn. For “tea” he expended 1_d._ on\r\ncoffee, or 1-1/2_d._ on tea, being a “cup” of tea, or “half-pint\r\nof coffee,” at a coffee-shop. Sometimes he had a halfpenny-worth\r\nof butter, and with his tea he ate the bread he had saved from his\r\nbreakfast, and which he had carried in his pocket. He had no butter to\r\nhis breakfast, he said, for he could not buy less than a pennyworth\r\nabout where he lodged, and this was too dear for one meal. On a Sunday\r\nmorning however he generally had butter, sometimes joining with a\r\nfellow-lodger for a pennyworth; for his Sunday dinner he had a piece of\r\nmeat, which cost him 2_d._ on the Saturday night. Supper he dispensed\r\nwith, but if he felt much tired he had a half-pint of beer, which was\r\nthree farthings “in his own jug,” before he went to bed, about nine or\r\nten, as he did little or nothing late at night, except on Saturday.\r\nHe thus spent 4-1/2_d._ a day for food, and reckoning 2-1/2_d._ extra\r\nfor somewhat better fare on a Sunday, his board was 2_s._ 10_d._ a\r\nweek. His earnings he computed at 5_s._, and thus he had 2_s._ 2_d._\r\nweekly for other expenses. Of these there was 1_s._ for lodging; 2_d._\r\nor 3_d._ for washing (but this not every week); 1/2_d._ for a Sunday\r\nmorning’s shave; 1_d._ “for his religion” (as he worded it); and 6_d._\r\nfor “odds and ends,” such as thread to mend his clothes, a piece of\r\nleather to patch his shoes, worsted to darn his stockings, &c. He was\r\nsubject to rheumatism, or “he might have saved a trifle of money.”\r\nJudging by his methodical habits, it was probable he had done so. He\r\nhad nothing of the eloquence of his countrymen, and seemed indeed of\r\nrather a morose turn.\r\n\r\nA family boarding together live even cheaper than this man, for more\r\npotatoes and less fish fall to the share of the children. A meal too\r\nis not unfrequently saved in this manner:--If a man, his wife, and\r\ntwo children, all go out in the streets selling, they breakfast before\r\nstarting, and perhaps agree to re-assemble at four o’clock. Then the\r\nwife prepares the dinner of fish and potatoes, and so tea is dispensed\r\nwith. In that case the husband’s and wife’s board would be 4_d._ or\r\n4-1/2_d._ a day each, the children’s 3_d._ or 3-1/2_d._ each, and\r\ngiving 1-1/2_d._ extra to each for Sunday, the weekly cost is 10_s._\r\n3_d._ Supposing the husband and wife cleared 5_s._ a week each, and the\r\nchildren each 3_s._, their earnings would be 16_s._ The balance is the\r\nsurplus left to pay rent, washing, firing, and clothing.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can ascertain, the Irish street-seller can always live\r\nat about half the cost of the English costermonger; the Englishman\r\nmust have butter for his bread, and meat at no long intervals, for he\r\n“hates fish more than once a week.” It is by this spareness of living,\r\nas well as by frequently importunate and mendacious begging, that the\r\nstreet-Irish manage to save money.\r\n\r\nThe diet I have spoken of is _generally_, but not universally, that of\r\nthe poor street-Irish; those who live differently, do not, as a rule,\r\nincur greater expense.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain in what proportion the Irish\r\nstreet-sellers consume strong drink, when compared with the consumption\r\nof the English costers; as a poor Irishman, if questioned on that\r\nor any subject, will far more frequently shape his reply to what he\r\nthinks will please his querist and induce a trifle for himself, than\r\nanswer according to the truth. The landlord of a large public-house,\r\nafter inquiring of his assistants, that his opinions might be checked\r\nby theirs, told me that in one respect there was a marked difference\r\nbetween the beer-drinking of the two people. He considered that in the\r\npoor streets near his house there were residing quite as many Irish\r\nstreet-sellers and labourers as English, but the instances in which the\r\nIrish conveyed beer to their own rooms, as a portion of their meals,\r\nwas not as 1 in 20 compared with the English: “I have read your work,\r\nsir,” he said, “and I know that you are quite right in saying that\r\nthe costermongers go for a good Sunday dinner. I don’t know what my\r\ncustomers are except by their appearance, but I do know that many are\r\ncostermongers, and by the best of all proofs, for I have bought fish,\r\nfruit, and vegetables of them. Well, now, we’ll take a fine Sunday in\r\nspring or summer, when times are pretty good with them; and, perhaps,\r\nin the ten minutes after my doors are opened at one on the Sunday,\r\nthere are 100 customers for their dinner-beer. Nearly three-quarters of\r\nthese are working men and their wives, working either in the streets,\r\nor at their indoor trades, such as tailoring. But among the number,\r\nI’m satisfied, there are not more than two Irishmen. There may be\r\nthree or four Irishwomen, but one of my barmen tells me he knows that\r\ntwo of them--very well-behaved and good-looking women--are married to\r\nEnglishmen. In my opinion the proportion, as to Sunday dinner-beer,\r\nbetween English and Irish, may be two or three in 70.”\r\n\r\nAn Irish gentleman and his wife, who are both well acquainted with\r\nthe habits and condition of the people in their own country, informed\r\nme, that among the classes who, though earning only scant incomes,\r\ncould not well be called “impoverished,” the use of beer, or even\r\nof small ale--known, now or recently--as “Thunder’s thruppeny,” was\r\nvery unfrequent. Even in many “independent” families, only water is\r\ndrunk at dinner, with punch to follow. This shows the accuracy of\r\nthe information I derived from Mr. ---- (the innkeeper), for persons\r\nunused to the drinking of malt liquor in their own country are not\r\nlikely to resort to it afterwards, when their means are limited. I was\r\nfurther informed, that reckoning the teetotallers among the English\r\nstreet-sellers at 300, there are 600 among the Irish,--teetotallers\r\ntoo, who, having taken the pledge, under the sanction of their priests,\r\nand looking upon it as a religious obligation, keep it rigidly.\r\n\r\nThe Irish street-sellers who frequent the gin-palaces or public-houses,\r\ndrink a pot of beer, in a company of three or four, but far more\r\nfrequently, a quartern of gin (very seldom whisky) oftener than do the\r\nEnglish. Indeed, from all I could ascertain, the Irish street-sellers,\r\nwhether from inferior earnings, their early training, or the restraints\r\nof their priests, drink less beer, by one-fourth, than their English\r\nbrethren, but a larger proportion of gin. “And you must bear this in\r\nmind, sir,” I was told by an innkeeper, “I had rather have twenty\r\npoor Englishmen drunk in my tap-room than a couple of poor Irishmen.\r\nThey’ll quarrel with anybody--the Irish will--and sometimes clear the\r\nroom by swearing they’ll ‘use their knives, by Jasus;’ and if there’s\r\na scuffle they’ll kick like devils, and scratch, and bite, like women\r\nor cats, instead of using their fists. I wish all the drunkards were\r\nteetotallers, if it were only to be rid of them.”\r\n\r\nWhiskey, I was told, would be drunk by the Irish, in preference to\r\ngin, were it not that gin was about half the price. One old Irish\r\nfruit-seller--who admitted that he was fond of a glass of gin--told\r\nme that he had not tasted whiskey for fourteen years, “becase of the\r\nprice.” The Irish, moreover, as I have shown, live on stronger and\r\ncoarser food than the English, buying all the rough (bad) fish, for, to\r\nuse the words of one of my informants, they look to quantity more than\r\nquality; this may account for their preferring a stronger and fiercer\r\nstimulant by way of drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RESOURCES OF THE STREET-IRISH AS REGARDS “STOCK-MONEY,”\r\nSICKNESS, BURIALS, &C.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to ascertain from the poor Irish themselves how they\r\nraise their stock-money, for their command of money is a subject on\r\nwhich they are not communicative, or, if communicative, not truthful.\r\n“My opinion is,” said an Irish gentleman to me, “that some of these\r\npoor fellows would declare to God that they hadn’t the value of a\r\nhalfpenny, even if you heard the silver chink in their pockets.” It is\r\ncertain that they never, or very rarely, borrow of the usurers like\r\ntheir English brethren.\r\n\r\nThe more usual custom is, that if a poor Irish street-seller be in\r\nwant of 5_s._, it is lent to him by the more prosperous people of his\r\ncourt--bricklayers’ labourers, or other working-men--who club 1_s._\r\na piece. This is always repaid. An Irish bricklayer, when in full\r\nwork, will trust a needy countryman with some article to pledge, on\r\nthe understanding that it is to be redeemed and returned when the\r\nborrower is able. Sometimes, if a poor Irishwoman need 1_s._ to buy\r\noranges, four others--only less poor than herself, because not utterly\r\npenniless--will readily advance 3_d._ each. Money is also advanced to\r\nthe deserving Irish through the agency of the Roman Catholic priests,\r\nwho are the medium through whom charitable persons of their own faith\r\nexercise good offices. Money, too, there is no doubt, is often advanced\r\nout of the priest’s own pocket.\r\n\r\nOn all the kinds of loans with which the poor Irish are aided by their\r\ncountrymen no interest is ever charged. “I don’t like the Irish,” said\r\nan English costermonger to me; “but they _do_ stick to one another far\r\nmore than we do.”\r\n\r\nThe Irish costers hire barrows and shallows like the English, but,\r\nif they “get on” at all, they will possess themselves of their own\r\nvehicles much sooner than an English costermonger. A quick-witted\r\nIrishman will begin to ponder on his paying 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for the\r\nhire of a barrow worth 20_s._, and he will save and hoard until a pound\r\nis at his command to purchase one for himself; while an obtuse English\r\ncoster (who will yet buy cheaper than an Irishman) will probably pride\r\nhimself on his cleverness in having got the charge for his barrow\r\nreduced, in the third year of its hire, to 1_s._ a week the twelvemonth\r\nround!\r\n\r\nIn cases of sickness the mode of relief adopted is similar to that of\r\nthe English. A raffle is got up for the benefit of the Irish sufferer,\r\nand, if it be a bad case, the subscribers pay their money without\r\ncaring what trifle they throw for, or whether they throw at all. If\r\nsickness continue and such means as raffles cannot be persevered in,\r\nthere is one resource from which a poor Irishman never shrinks--the\r\nparish. He will apply for and accept parochial relief without the least\r\nsense of shame, a sense which rarely deserts an Englishman who has been\r\nreared apart from paupers. The English costers appear to have a horror\r\nof the Union. If the Irishman be taken into the workhouse, his friends\r\ndo not lose sight of him. In case of his death, they apply for, and\r\ngenerally receive his body, from the parochial authorities, undertaking\r\nthe expence of the funeral, when the body is duly “waked.” “I think\r\nthere’s a family contract among the Irish,” said a costermonger to me;\r\n“that’s where it is.”\r\n\r\nThe Irish street-folk are, generally speaking, a far more provident\r\nbody of people than the English street-sellers. To save, the Irish will\r\noften sacrifice what many Englishmen consider a necessary, and undergo\r\nmany a hardship.\r\n\r\nFrom all I could ascertain, the saving of an Irish street-seller does\r\nnot arise from any wish to establish himself more prosperously in his\r\nbusiness, but for the attainment of some cherished project, such as\r\nemigration. Some of the objects, however, for which these struggling\r\nmen hoard money, are of the most praiseworthy character. They will\r\ntreasure up halfpenny after halfpenny, and continue to do so for\r\nyears, in order to send money to enable their wives and children, and\r\neven their brothers and sisters, when in the depth of distress in\r\nIreland, to take shipping for England. They will save to be able to\r\nremit money for the relief of their aged parents in Ireland. They will\r\nsave to defray the expense of their marriage, an expense the English\r\ncostermonger so frequently dispenses with--but they will _not_ save to\r\npreserve either themselves or their children from the degradation of a\r\nworkhouse; indeed they often, with the means of independence secreted\r\non their persons, apply for parish relief, and that principally to\r\nsave the expenditure of their own money. Even when detected in such\r\nan attempt at extortion an Irishman betrays no passion, and hardly\r\nmanifests any emotion--he has speculated and failed. Not one of them\r\nbut has a positive genius for begging--both the taste and the faculty\r\nfor alms-seeking developed to an extraordinary extent.\r\n\r\nOf the amount “saved” by the patience of the poor Irishmen, I can form\r\nno conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HISTORY OF SOME IRISH STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nIn order that the following statements might be as truthful as\r\npossible, I obtained permission to use the name of a Roman Catholic\r\nclergyman, to whom I am indebted for much valuable information touching\r\nthis part of my subject.\r\n\r\nA young woman, of whose age it was not easy to form a conjecture, her\r\nfeatures were so embrowned by exposure to the weather, and perhaps when\r\nI saw her a little swollen from cold, gave me the following account as\r\nto her living. Her tone and manner betrayed indifference to the future,\r\ncaused perhaps by ignorance,--for uneducated persons I find are apt\r\nto look on the future as if it must needs be but a repetition of the\r\npresent, while the past in many instances is little more than a blank\r\nto them. This young woman said, her brogue being little perceptible,\r\nthough she spoke thickly:\r\n\r\n“I live by keepin’ this fruit stall. It’s a poor livin’ when I see\r\nhow others live. Yes, in thruth, sir, but it’s thankful I am for to\r\nbe able to live at all, at all; troth is it, in these sore times. My\r\nfather and mother are both did. God be gracious to their sowls! They\r\nwas evicted. The family of us was. The thatch of the bit o’ home was\r\ntuk off above our hids, and we were lift to the wide worruld--yis,\r\nindeed, sir, and in the open air too. The rint wasn’t paid and it\r\ncouldn’t be paid, and so we had to face the wither. It was a sorrowful\r\ntime. But God was good, and so was the neighbours. And when we saw the\r\npraste, he was a frind to us. And we came to this counthry, though I’d\r\nalways heard it called a black counthry. Sure, an’ there’s much in it\r\nto indhure. There’s goin’s on it, sir, that the praste, God rewarrud\r\nhim! wouldn’t like to see. There’s bad ways. I won’t talk about thim,\r\nand I’m sure you are too much of a gintlemin to ask me; for if you\r\nknow Father ----, that shows you are the best of gintlemin, sure. It\r\nwas the eviction that brought us here. I don’t know about where we was\r\njust; not in what county; nor parish. I was so young whin we lift the\r\nland. I belave I’m now 19, perhaps only 18” (she certainly looked much\r\nolder, but I have often noticed that of her class). “I can’t be more, I\r\nthink, for sure an’ its only 5 or 6 years since we left Watherford and\r\ncome to Bristol. I’m sure it was Watherford, and a beautiful place it\r\nis, and I know it was Bristol we come to. We walked all the long way to\r\nLondon. My parints died of the cholera, and I live with mysilf, but my\r\naunt lodges me and sees to me. She sills in the sthreets too. I don’t\r\nmake 7_d._ a day. I may make 6_d._ There’s a good many young payple I\r\nknow is now sillin’ in the streets becase they was evicted in their\r\nown counthry. I suppose they had no where ilse to come to. I’m nivir\r\nout of a night. I sleep with my aunt, and we keep to oursilves sure.\r\nI very sildom taste mate, but perhaps I do oftener than before we was\r\nevicted--glory be to God.”\r\n\r\nOne Irish street-seller I saw informed me that she was a “widdy wid\r\nthree childer.” Her husband died about four years since. She had then\r\nfive children, and was near her confinement with another. Since the\r\ndeath of her husband she had lost three of her children; a boy about\r\ntwelve years died of stoppage on his lungs, brought on, she said,\r\nthrough being in the streets, and shouting so loud “to get sale of the\r\nfruit.” She has been in Clare-street, Clare-market, seven years with a\r\nfruit stall. In the summer she sells green fruit, which she purchases\r\nat Covent-garden. When the nuts, oranges, &c., come in season, she\r\nfurnishes her stall with that kind of fruit, and continues to sell\r\nthem until the spring salad comes in. During the spring and summer her\r\nweekly average income is about 5_s._, but the remaining portion of the\r\nyear her income is not more than 3_s._ 6_d._ weekly, so that taking\r\nthe year through, her average weekly income is about 4_s._ 3_d._; out\r\nof this she pays 1_s._ 6_d._ a week rent, leaving only 2_s._ 9_d._ a\r\nweek to find necessary comforts for herself and family. For fuel the\r\nchildren go to the market and gather up the waste walnuts, bring them\r\nhome and dry them, and these, with a pennyworth of coal and coke, serve\r\nto warm their chilled feet and hands. They have no bedstead, but in\r\none corner of a room is a flock bed upon the floor, with an old sheet,\r\nblanket, and quilt to cover them at this inclement season. There is\r\nneither chair nor table; a stool serves for the chair, and two pieces\r\nof board upon some baskets do duty for a table, and an old penny\r\ntea-canister for a candlestick. She had parted with every article of\r\nfurniture to get food for her family. She received nothing from the\r\nparish, but depended upon the sale of her fruit for her living.\r\n\r\nThe Irishmen who are in this trade are also very poor; and I learned\r\nthat both Irishmen and Irishwomen left the occupation now and then,\r\nand took to begging, as a more profitable calling, often going begging\r\nthis month and fruit-selling the next. This is one of the causes which\r\nprompt the London costermongers’ dislike of the Irish. “They’ll beg\r\nthemselves into a meal, and work us out of one,” said an English coster\r\nto me. Some of them are, however, less “poverty-struck” (a word in\r\ncommon use among the costermongers); but these for the most part are\r\nmen who have been in the trade for some years, and have got regular\r\n“pitches.”\r\n\r\nThe woman who gave me the following statement seemed about twenty-two\r\nor twenty-three. She was large-boned, and of heavy figure and\r\ndeportment. Her complexion and features were both coarse, but her voice\r\nhad a softness, even in its broadest brogue, which is not very frequent\r\namong poor Irishwomen. The first sentence she uttered seems to me\r\ntersely to embody a deplorable history of the poverty of a day. It was\r\nbetween six and seven in the evening when I saw the poor creature:--\r\n\r\n“Sure, thin, sir, it’s thrippince I’ve taken to-day, and tuppince is\r\nto pay for my night’s lodgin’. I shall do no more good to-night, and\r\nshall only stay in the cowld, if I stay in it, for nothing. I’m an\r\norphand, sir,” (she three or four times alluded to this circumstance,)\r\n“and there’s nobody to care for me but God, glory be to his name! I\r\ncame to London to join my brother, that had come over and did will,\r\nand he sint for me, but whin I got here I couldn’t find him in it\r\nanyhow. I don’t know how long that’s ago. It may be five years; it may\r\nbe tin; but” (she added, with the true eloquence of beggary,) “sure,\r\nthin, sir, I had no harrut to keep count, if I knew how. My father and\r\nmother wasn’t able to keep me, nor to keep thimsilves in Ireland, and\r\nso I was sint over here. They was counthry payple. I don’t know about\r\ntheir landlorrud. They died not long afther I came here. I don’t know\r\nwhat they died of, but sure it was of the will of God, and they hadn’t\r\nmuch to make them love this worruld; no more have I. Would I like\r\nto go back to my own counthry? Will, thin, what would be the use? I\r\nsleep at a lodging-house, and it’s a dacint place. It’s mostly my own\r\ncounthrywomen that’s in it; that is, in the women’s part. I pay 1_s._\r\na week, that’s 2_d._ a night, for I’m not charged for Sundays. I live\r\non brid, and ’taties and salt, and a herrin’ sometimes. I niver taste\r\nbeer, and not often tay, but I sit here all day, and I feel the hunger\r\nthis day and that day. It goes off though, if I have nothin’ to ate.\r\nI don’t know why, but I won’t deny the goodness of God to bring such\r\na thing about. I have lived for a day on a pinny, sir: a ha’pinny for\r\nbrid, and a ha’pinny for a herrin’, or two herrin’s for a ha’pinny,\r\nand ’taties for the place of brid. I’ve changed apples for a herrin’\r\nwith a poor man, God rewarrud him. Sometimes I make on to 6_d._ a day,\r\nand sometimes I _have_ made 1_s._ 6_d._, but I think that I don’t make\r\n5_d._ a day--arrah, no, thin, sir! one day with the other, and I don’t\r\nworruk on Sunday, not often. If I’ve no mate to ate, I’d rather rist. I\r\nnever miss mass on a Sunday. A lady gives me a rag sometimes, but the\r\nbitther time’s comin’. If I was sick I don’t know what I’d do, but I\r\nwould sind for the praste, and he’d counsil me. I could read a little\r\noncte, but I can’t now.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE IRISH “REFUSE”-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be described one branch of the Irish\r\nstreet-trade which is peculiar to the class--viz., the sale of\r\n“refuse,” or such fruit and vegetables as are damaged, and suited only\r\nto the very poorest purchasers.\r\n\r\nIn assorting his goods, a fruit-salesman in the markets generally\r\nthrows to one side the shrivelled, dwarfish, or damaged fruit--called\r\nby the street-traders the “specks.” If the supply to the markets be\r\nlarge, as in the pride of the season, he will put his several kinds\r\nof specks in separate baskets. At other times all kinds are tossed\r\ntogether, and sometimes with an admixture of nuts and walnuts. The\r\nIrish women purchase these at a quarter, or within a quarter, of the\r\nregular price, paying from 6_d._ to 1_s._ a bushel for apples; 9_d._\r\nto 1_s._ 6_d._ for pears; 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ for plums. They\r\nare then sorted into halfpenny-worths for sale on the stalls. Among\r\nthe refuse is always a portion of what is called “tidy” fruit, and\r\nthis occupies the prominent place in the “halfpenny lots”--for they\r\nare usually sold at a halfpenny. Sometimes, too, a salesman will throw\r\nin among the refuse a little good fruit, if he happen to have it over,\r\neither gratuitously or at the refuse price; and this, of course, is\r\nalways made the most conspicuous on the stalls. Of other fruits,\r\nperhaps, only a small portion is damaged, from over-ripeness, or by\r\nthe aggression of wasps and insects, the remainder being very fine, so\r\nthat the retail “lots” are generally cheap. The sellers aim at “half\r\nprofits,” or cent. per cent.\r\n\r\nThe “refuse” trade in fruit--and the refuse-trade is mainly confined to\r\nfruit--is principally in the hands of the Irish. The persons carrying\r\nit on are nearly all middle-aged and elderly women. I once or twice\r\nsaw a delicate and pretty-looking girl sitting with the old “refuse”\r\nwomen; but I found that she was not a “regular hand,” and only now and\r\nthen “minded the stall” in her mother’s absence. She worked with her\r\nneedle, I was told.\r\n\r\nOf the women who confine themselves to this trade there are never less\r\nthan twenty, and frequently thirty. Sometimes, when the refuse is very\r\ncheap and very abundant, as many as 100 fruit-sellers, women and girls,\r\nwill sell it in halfpenny-worths, along with better articles. These\r\nwomen also sell refuse dry-fruit, purchased in Duke’s-place, but only\r\nwhen they cannot obtain green-fruit, or cannot obtain it sufficiently.\r\nAll is sold at stalls; as these dealers seem to think that if it were\r\nhawked, the police might look too inquisitively at a barrow stocked\r\nwith refuse. The “refuse-sellers” buy at all the markets. The poorer\r\nstreet-sellers, whose more staple trade is in oranges or nuts, are\r\n_occasional_ dealers in it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the regular refuse-buyers are not among the _very_ poorest\r\nclass, as their sale is tolerably quick and certain, but with the usual\r\ndrawbacks of wet weather. They make, I was told, from 4_d._ to 1_s._ a\r\nday the year round, or perhaps 7_d._ or 8_d._ a day, Sunday included.\r\nThey are all Roman Catholics, and resort to the street-sale after\r\nmass. They are mostly widows, or women who have reached middle-age,\r\nunmarried. Some are the wives of street-sellers. Two of their best\r\npitches are on Saffron-hill and in Petticoat-lane. It is somewhat\r\ncurious to witness these women sitting in a line of five or six, and\r\nnotwithstanding their natural garrulity, hardly exchanging a word one\r\nwith another. Some of them derive an evident solace from deliberate\r\npuffs at a short black pipe.\r\n\r\nA stout, healthy-looking woman of this class said:--“Sure thin, sir,\r\nI’ve sat and sould my bit of fruit in this place, or near it, for\r\ntwinty year and more, as is very well known indeed, is it. I could make\r\ntwice the money twinty year ago that I can now, for the boys had the\r\nha’pinnies more thin than they has now, more’s the pity. The childer\r\nis my custhomers, very few beyant--such as has only a ha’pinny now and\r\nthin, God hilp them. They’ll come a mile from any parrut, to spind it\r\nwith such as me, for they know it’s chape we sill! Yis, indeed, or\r\nthey’ll come with a fardin either, for it’s a ha’pinny lot we’ll split\r\nfor them any time. The boys buys most, but they’re dridful tazes. It’s\r\nthe patience of the divil must be had to dale wid the likes of thim.\r\nThey was dridful about the Pope, but they’ve tired of it now. O, no, it\r\nwasn’t the boys of my counthry that demaned themselves that way. Well,\r\nI make 4_d._ some days, and 6_d._ some, and 1_s._ 6_d._ some, and I\r\nhave made 3_s._ 6_d._, and I have made nothing. Perhaps I make 5_s._ or\r\n6_s._ a week rigular, but I’m established and well-known you see.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of refuse at the metropolitan “green” markets varies\r\nwith the different descriptions of fruit. Of apples it averages\r\none-twentieth, and of plums and greengages one-fifteenth, of the\r\nentire supply. With pears, cherries, gooseberries, and currants,\r\nhowever, the damaged amounts to one-twelfth, while of strawberries and\r\nmulberries it reaches as high as one-tenth of the aggregate quantity\r\nsent to market.\r\n\r\nThe Irish street-sellers, I am informed, buy full two-thirds of all the\r\nrefuse, the other third being purchased by the lower class of English\r\ncostermongers--“the illegitimates,”--as they are called. We must not\r\nconsider the sale of the damaged fruit so great an evil as it would,\r\nat the first blush, appear, for it constitutes perhaps the sole luxury\r\nof poor children, as well as of the poor themselves, who, were it\r\nnot for the halfpenny and farthing lots of the refuse-sellers, would\r\ndoubtlessly never know the taste of such things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this part of the subject, it may be as well to say\r\na few words concerning the curious revelations made by the returns\r\nfrom Billingsgate, Covent-garden, and the other London markets, as\r\nto the diet of the poor. In the first place, then, it appears that\r\nin the matter of fish, herrings constitute the chief article of\r\nconsumption--no less than 210,000,000 lbs. weight of this fish in a\r\n“fresh” state, and 60,000,000 lbs. in a “dried” state, being annually\r\neaten by the humbler classes of the metropolis and the suburbs. Of\r\nsprats there are 3,000,000 lbs. weight consumed--and these, with the\r\naddition of plaice, are the staple comestibles at the dinners and\r\nsuppers of the ichthyophagous part of the labouring population of\r\nLondon. One of the reasons for this is doubtless the extraordinary\r\ncheapness of these kinds of fish. The sprats are sold at a penny per\r\npound; the herrings at the same rate; and the plaice at a fraction\r\nless, perhaps; whereas a pound of butcher’s meat, even “pieces,” or\r\nthe “block ornaments,” as they are sometimes called, cannot be got for\r\nless than twopence-halfpenny or threepence. But the relative cheapness\r\nof these two kinds of food can only be tested by the proportionate\r\nquantity of nutrition in each. According to Liebig, butcher’s meat\r\ncontains 26 per cent. of solid matter, and 74 per cent. of water;\r\nwhereas, according to Brande, fish consists of 20 parts of solid\r\nmatter, and 80 parts water in every 100. Hence it would appear that\r\nbutcher’s meat is five per cent. more nutritive than fish--or, in\r\nother words, that if the two were equally cheap, the prices, according\r\nto the quantity of nutrition in each, should be for fish one penny\r\nper pound, and butcher’s meat not five farthings; so that even at\r\ntwopence-halfpenny the pound, meat is more than twice as dear an\r\narticle of diet as fish.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only on account of their cheapness that herrings and\r\nsprats are consumed in such vast quantities by the labouring people of\r\nLondon. Salmon, eels, herrings, pilchards, and sprats, Dr. Pereira\r\ntells us, abound in oil; and oleaginous food, according to Leibig,\r\nis an “element of respiration,” consisting of nearly 80 per cent.\r\ncharcoal, which burns away in the lungs, and so contributes to the\r\nwarmth of the system. Fat, indeed, may be said to act as fuel to the\r\nvital fire; and we now know, from observations made upon the average\r\ndaily consumption of food by 28 soldiers of the Grand Duke of Hesse\r\nDarmstadt, in barracks, for a month--which is the same as 840 men for\r\none day--that an adult taking moderate exercise consumes, in the act of\r\nrespiration, very nearly a pound of charcoal every day, which of course\r\nmust be supplied in his food. “But persons who take much exercise, or\r\nlabour hard,” says Dr. Pereira, “require more frequent and copious\r\nmeals than the indolent or sedentary. In the active man the number of\r\nrespirations is greater than in the inactive, and therefore a more\r\nfrequent supply of food is required to furnish the increased quantity\r\nof carbon and hydrogen to be consumed in the lungs.” “A bird deprived\r\nof food,” says Liebig, “dies on the third day; while a serpent, with\r\nits sluggish respiration, can live without food three months, or\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Parry, in his account of one of the Polar expeditions (1827),\r\nstates, that both himself and Mr. Beverley, the surgeon, were of\r\nopinion, that, in order to maintain the strength of the men during\r\ntheir harassing journey across the ice, living constantly in the\r\nopen air, and exposed to the wet and cold for twelve hours a day,\r\nan addition was requisite of at least one-third to the quantity of\r\nprovisions daily issued. So, in the gaol dietaries, the allowance to\r\nprisoners sentenced to hard labour for three months is one-third more\r\nthan the scale for those sentenced to hard labour for three days--the\r\nformer having 254 ounces, and the latter only 168 ounces of solid food\r\nserved out to them every week.\r\n\r\nBut the hard-working poor not only require more food than the\r\nnon-working rich, but it is mainly because the rich are better fed\r\nthat they are more lethargic than the poor; for the greater the supply\r\nof nutriment to the body, the more inactive does the system become.\r\nFrom experiments made a few years ago at the Zoological Gardens, it\r\nwas found, that, by feeding the animals twice, instead of once, in the\r\ntwenty-four hours, their habits, as regards exercise, were altered--a\r\nfact which readily explains how the fat and overfed are always the\r\nleast energetic; fat being at once the cause and consequence of\r\ninaction. It is well to hear an obese citizen tell a hollow-cheeked\r\nman, who begs a penny of him, “to go and work--a lazy scoundrel;” but\r\nphysiology assures us that the fat tradesman is naturally the laziest\r\nof the two. In a word, he is fat because he is lazy, and lazy because\r\nhe is fat.\r\n\r\nThe industrious poor, however, not only require more food than the\r\nindolent rich, but, getting less, they become more susceptible of cold,\r\nand, therefore, more eager for all that tends to promote warmth. I\r\nhave often had occasion to remark the sacrifices that the ill-fed\r\nwill make to have “a bit of fire.” “He who is well fed,” observes\r\nSir John Ross, “resists cold better than the man who is stinted,\r\nwhile starvation from cold follows but too soon a starvation in food.\r\nThis doubtlessly explains in a great measure the resisting powers\r\nof the natives of frozen climates, their consumption of food being\r\nenormous, and often incredible.” Captain Cochrane, in his “Journey\r\nthrough Russia and Siberian Tartary,” tells us that he has repeatedly\r\nseen a Yakut or Tongouse devour forty pounds of meat in a day; and\r\none of the Yakuti he speaks of as having consumed, in twenty-four\r\nhours, “the hind-quarter of a large ox, twenty pounds of fat, and a\r\nproportionate quantity of melted butter for his drink.” (Vol. i. p.\r\n255). Much less heat is evolved, physiologists tell us, where there is\r\na deficiency of food. “During the whole of our march,” says Sir John\r\nFranklin, “we experienced that no quantity of clothing could keep us\r\nwarm while we fasted; but, on those occasions on which we were enabled\r\nto go to bed with full stomachs, we passed the night in a warm and\r\ncomfortable manner.” Hence, it is evident, that in summer a smaller\r\nquantity of food suffices to keep up the temperature of the body. I\r\nknow of no experiments to show the different proportions of aliment\r\nrequired at different seasons of the year. In winter, however, when a\r\ngreater supply is certainly needed, the labouring man, unfortunately,\r\nhas less means of obtaining it--nearly all trades slacken as the\r\ncold weather comes on, and some, as brick-making, market-gardening,\r\nbuilding, &c., then almost entirely cease--so that, were it not for\r\nthe cheapness of fish, and, moreover, the oleaginous quality of those\r\nkinds which are most plentiful in the winter time, the metropolitan\r\npoor would be very likely to suffer that “starvation from cold which,”\r\nin the words of Sir John Ross, “follows but too soon a starvation in\r\nfood.” Hence we can readily understand the remark of the enthusiastic\r\nstreet-seller--“Sprats _is_ a blessing to the poor.”\r\n\r\nThe returns as to the other articles of food sold in the streets are\r\nequally curious. The 1,500,000_l._ spent yearly in fish, and the\r\ncomparatively small amount expended on vegetables, viz., 290,000_l._,\r\nis a circumstance which seems to show that the labouring population of\r\nLondon have a greater relish for animal than vegetable diet. “It is\r\nquite certain,” says Dr. Carpenter, “that the most perfect physical\r\ndevelopment and the greatest intellectual vigour are to be found\r\namong those races in which a mixed diet of animal and vegetable food\r\nis the prevalent habit.” And yet, in apparent contradiction to the\r\nproposition asserted with so much confidence by Dr. Carpenter, we have\r\nthe following curious fact cited by Mr. Jacob Bentley:--\r\n\r\n “It is, indeed, a fact worthy of remark, and one that seems never to\r\n have been noticed, that throughout the whole animal creation, in every\r\n country and clime of the earth the most useful animals cost nature the\r\n least waste to sustain them with food. For instance, all animals that\r\n work, live on vegetable or fruit food; and no animal that eats flesh,\r\n works. The all-powerful elephant, and the patient, untiring camel in\r\n the torrid zone; the horse, the ox, or the donkey in the temperate,\r\n and the rein-deer in the frigid zone; obtain all their muscular\r\n power for enduring labour, from Nature’s simplest productions,--the\r\n vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n “But all the flesh-eating animals, keep the rest of the animated\r\n creation in constant dread of them. They seldom eat vegetable food\r\n till some other animal has eaten it first, and made it into flesh.\r\n Their only use seems to be, to destroy life; their own flesh is unfit\r\n for other animals to eat, having been itself made out of flesh,\r\n and is most foul and offensive. Great strength, fleetness of foot,\r\n usefulness, cleanliness and docility, are then always characteristic\r\n of vegetable-eating animals, while all the world dreads flesh-eaters.”\r\n\r\nOf vegetables we have seen that the greatest quantity consumed by the\r\npoor consists of potatoes, of which 60,500,000 lbs. are annually sold\r\nin the streets; but ten pounds of potatoes are only equal in nutritive\r\npower to one pound of butcher’s meat, which contains one-fifth more\r\nsolid food than fish,--so that a pound of fish may be said to equal\r\neight pounds of potatoes, and thus the 60,000,000 lbs. of vegetable\r\nis dietetically equivalent to nearly 7,000,000 lbs. of fish diet.\r\nThe cost of the potatoes, at five pounds for 2_d._, is, as we have\r\nseen, 100,000_l._; whereas the cost of the same amount of nutritive\r\nmatter in the form of fish, at 1_d._ per pound, would have been only\r\n30,000_l._, or upwards of two-thirds less. The vegetable of which there\r\nis the next greatest street sale is onions, upon which 90,000_l._ are\r\nannually expended. This has been before accounted for, by saying, that\r\na piece of bread and an onion are to the English labourer what bread\r\nand grapes are to the Frenchman--oftentimes a meal. The relish for\r\nonions by the poorer classes is not difficult to explain. Onions are\r\nstrongly stimulating substances, and they owe their peculiar odour and\r\nflavour, as well as their pungent and stimulating qualities, to an\r\nacrid volatile oil which contains sulphur. This oil becomes absorbed,\r\nquickens the circulation, and occasions thirst. The same result takes\r\nplace with the oil of fish. It not only proves a stimulant to the\r\ngeneral system, but we are told that the thirst and uneasy feeling\r\nat the stomach, frequently experienced after the use of the richer\r\nspecies of fish, have led to the employment of spirit to this kind of\r\nfood. Hence, says Dr. Pereira, the vulgar proverb, “Brandy is Latin\r\nfor Fish.” Moreover, the two classes of food are similar in their\r\ncomparative indigestibility, for the uneducated palates of the poor not\r\nonly require a more pungent kind of diet, but their stronger stomachs\r\nneed something that will resist the action of the gastric juice for a\r\nconsiderable time. Hence their love of shell-fish.\r\n\r\nThe small quantity of fruit, too, sold to the poor is a further\r\nproof of what is here stated. The amount of the street sale of this\r\nluxury is no criterion as to the quantity purchased by the London\r\nlabourers; for according to all accounts the fruit-buyers in the\r\nstreets consist mostly of clerks, shopmen, small tradesmen, and the\r\nchildren of mechanics or the lower grade of middle class people.\r\nThose who may be said strictly to belong to the poor,--viz. those\r\nwhose incomes are barely sufficient for their support--seldom purchase\r\nfruit. In the first place they have no money to spend on such a mere\r\ntoothsome extravagance; and, secondly, they require a stronger and\r\nmore stimulating, and “_staying_” kind of food. The delights of the\r\npalate, we should remember, are studied only when the cravings of the\r\nstomach are satisfied, so that those who have strong stomachs have\r\nnecessarily dull palates, and, therefore, prefer something that “bites\r\nin the mouth,”--to use the words of one of my informants--like gin,\r\nonions, sprats, or pickled whelks. What the poor term “relishes” are\r\nvery different things from what the rich style the “delicacies of the\r\nseason.”\r\n\r\nI have no means of ascertaining the average number of ounces of solid\r\nfood consumed by the poorer class of the metropolis. The _whole_ of the\r\nfish, fruit, and vegetables, sold to the London costermongers, is not\r\ndisposed of in the London streets--many of the street-sellers going,\r\nas we have seen, country excursions with their goods. According to\r\nthe result of the Government Commissioners of Inquiry, the labourers\r\nin the country are unable to procure for themselves and families an\r\naverage allowance of more than 122 ounces of solid food--principally\r\nbread--every week; hence it has been justly said we may infer that the\r\nman consumes, as his share, 140 ounces (134 bread and 6 meat). The gaol\r\ndietaries allow 254 ounces, or nearly twice as much to all prisoners,\r\nwho undergo continuous hard labour. In the construction of these\r\ndietaries Sir James Graham--the then Secretary of State--says, in his\r\n“Letter to the Chairman of Quarter Sessions” (January 27th, 1843), “I\r\nhave consulted not only the Prison Inspectors, but medical men of the\r\ngreatest eminence possessing the advantage of long experience.” They\r\nare proposed, he adds, “as the _minimum_ amount which can be safely\r\nafforded to prisoners without the risk of inflicting a punishment\r\nnot contemplated by law and which it is unjust and cruel to inflict;\r\nnamely, loss of health and strength through the inadequacy of the food\r\nsupplied.” Hence it appears not that the thief gets too much, but the\r\nhonest working man too little--or, in other words, that the labourer\r\nof this country is able to procure, by his industry, only half the\r\nquantity of food that is considered by “medical men of the greatest\r\neminence” to be “the _minimum_ amount” that can be _safely_ afforded\r\nfor the support of the criminals--a fact which it would be out of place\r\nto comment upon here.\r\n\r\nOne word concerning the incomes of the London costermongers, and I have\r\ndone. It has been before shown that the gross sum of money _taken_\r\nyearly, in the streets, by the sale of fish, fruit, and vegetables,\r\namounts, in round numbers, to two million pounds--a million and a\r\nhalf being expended in fish, and a quarter of a million upon fruit\r\nand vegetables respectively. In estimating the yearly receipts of\r\nthe costermongers, from their average gains, the gross “takings” of\r\nthe entire body were concluded to be between a million and a quarter\r\nand a million and a half sterling--that is to say, each one of the\r\n10,000 street-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables, was supposed to\r\nclear ten shillings a week all the year through, and to _take_ fifty\r\nshillings. But, according to the returns furnished me by the salesmen,\r\nat the several metropolitan markets, the weekly “_takings_” of the\r\nten thousand men and their families--for often both wife and children\r\nsell--cannot be less than four pounds per week all the year round, out\r\nof which it would seem that the clear weekly _gains_ are about fifteen\r\nshillings. (Some costers we have seen take pounds in a day, others--as\r\nthe nut and orange-women and children--only a few shillings a week;\r\nsome, again, make cent. per cent. profit, whilst others are obliged\r\nto sell at a loss.) This, from all I can gather, as well as from a\r\ncomparison of the coster’s style of living with other classes whose\r\nweekly income is nearly the same, appears to be very close upon the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWe may then, I think, safely assert, that the gross yearly receipts of\r\nthe London costermongers are two millions of money; that their clear\r\nannual gain, or income, is 425,000_l._; and that the capital invested\r\nin their business, in the form of donkey-carts, barrows, baskets,\r\nweights, and stock-money, is 25,000_l._;--half of this being borrowed,\r\nfor which they pay upwards of 20,000_l._ interest per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GAME, POULTRY (LIVE AND DEAD), RABBITS,\r\nBUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class who sell game and poultry in the public thoroughfares of the\r\nmetropolis are styled hawkers, both in Leadenhall and Newgate-market.\r\nThe number of these dealers in London is computed at between 200\r\nand 300. Of course, legally to sell game, a license, which costs\r\n2_l._ 2_s._ yearly, is required; but the street-seller laughs at the\r\nnotion of being subjected to a direct tax; which, indeed, it might be\r\nimpossible to levy on so “slippery” a class.\r\n\r\nThe sale of game, even with a license, was not legalised until 1831;\r\nand, prior to that year, the mere killing of game by an “unqualified”\r\nperson was an offence entailing heavy penalties. The “qualification”\r\nconsisted of the possession of a freehold estate of 100_l._ a year, or\r\na leasehold for ninety-nine years of 150_l._ a year! By an Act, passed\r\nin the 25th year of George III., it was provided that a certificate\r\n(costing 3_l._ 13_s._ 6_d._) must be taken out by all qualified\r\npersons killing game. Since 1831 (1 & 2 William IV., c. 32,) a\r\ncertificate, without any qualification, is all that is required from\r\nthe game-killer.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes carry on the trade in game-hawking, but there are more\r\nthan thrice as many men as women engaged in the business, the weight\r\noccasionally carried being beyond a woman’s strength. The most\r\ncustomary dress of the game or poultry-hawker is a clean smock-frock\r\ncovering the whole of his other attire, except the ends of his\r\ntrousers and his thick boots or shoes. Indeed he often, but less\r\nfrequently than was the case five years ago, assumes the dress of a\r\ncountry labourer, although he may have been for years a resident in\r\nLondon. About forty years ago, I am informed, it was the custom for\r\ncountrymen, residing at no great distance, to purchase a stock of\r\nchickens or ducks; and, taking their places in a wagon, to bring their\r\nbirds to London, and hawk them from door to door. Some of these men’s\r\nsmock-frocks were a convenient garb, for they covered the ample pockets\r\nof the coat beneath, in which were often a store of partridges, or an\r\noccasional pheasant or hare. This game, illegally killed--for it was\r\nall poached--was illegally sold by the hawker, and illegally bought\r\nby the hotel-keepers and the richer tradesmen. One informant (an old\r\nman) was of opinion that the game was rarely offered for sale by these\r\ncountrymen at the West-end mansions of the aristocracy. “In fact,” he\r\nsaid, “I knew one country fellow--though he was sharp enough in his\r\ntrade of game and poultry-selling--who seemed to think that every fine\r\nhouse, without a shop, and where there were livery servants, must needs\r\nbe inhabited by a magistrate! But, as the great props of poaching were\r\nthe rich--for, of course, the poor couldn’t buy game--there was, no\r\ndoubt, a West-end as well as a City trade in it. I have bought game of\r\na country poultry-hawker,” continued my informant, “when I lived in the\r\nCity at the beginning of this century, and generally gave 3_s._ 6_d._\r\na brace for partridges. I have bid it, and the man has left, refusing\r\nto take it; and has told me afterwards, and, I dare say, he spoke the\r\ntruth, that he had sold his partridges at 5_s._ or 6_s._ or more. I\r\nbelieve 5_s._ a brace was no uncommon price in the City. I have given\r\nas much as 10_s._ for a pheasant for a Christmas supper. The hawker,\r\nbefore offering the birds for sale, used to peer about him, though we\r\nwere alone in my counting-house, and then pull his partridges out of\r\nhis pockets, and say, ‘Sir, do you want any very young chickens?’--for\r\nso he called them. Hares he called ‘lions;’ and they cost often,\r\nenough, 5_s._ each of the hawker. The trade had all the charms and\r\nrecommendations of a mystery and a risk about it, just like smuggling.”\r\n\r\nThe sale of game in London, however, was not confined to the\r\nstreet-hawkers, who generally derived their stock-in-trade immediately\r\nfrom the poacher. Before the legalisation of the sale, the trade was\r\ncarried on, under the rose, by the salesmen in Leadenhall-market,\r\nand that to an extent of not less than a fifteenth of the sale now\r\naccomplished there. The purveyors for the London game-market--I learned\r\nfrom leading salesmen in Leadenhall--were not then, as now, noble\r\nlords and honourable gentlemen, but peasant or farmer poachers, who\r\ncarried on the business systematically. The guards and coachmen of the\r\nstage-coaches were the media of communication, and had charge of the\r\nsupply to the London market. The purchasers of the game thus supplied\r\nto a market, which is mostly the property of the municipality of the\r\nCity of London, were not only hotel-keepers, who required it for public\r\ndinners presided over by princes, peers, and legislators, but the\r\npurveyors for the civic banquets--such as the Lord Mayor’s ninth of\r\nNovember dinner, at which the Ministers of State always attended.\r\n\r\nThis street-hawking of _poached_ game, as far as I could ascertain\r\nfrom the best-informed quarters, hardly survived the first year of the\r\nlegalised sale.\r\n\r\nThe female hawkers of game are almost all the wives of the men so\r\nengaged, or are women living with them as their wives. The trade is\r\nbetter, as regards profit, than the costermonger’s ordinary pursuits,\r\nbut only when the season is favourable; it is, however, more uncertain.\r\n\r\nThere is very rarely a distinction between the hawkers of game and of\r\npoultry. A man will carry both, or have game one day and poultry the\r\nnext, as suits his means, or as the market avails. The street-sellers\r\nof cheese are generally costers, while the vendors of butter and eggs\r\nare almost extinct.\r\n\r\nGame, I may mention, consists of grouse (including black-cocks, and all\r\nthe varieties of heath or moor-game), partridges, pheasants, bustards,\r\nand hares. Snipe, woodcocks, plovers, teal, widgeons, wild ducks, and\r\nrabbits are not game, but can only be taken or killed by certificated\r\npersons, who are owners or occupiers of the property on which they are\r\nfound, or who have the necessary permission from such persons as are\r\nduly authorised to accord it. Poultry consists of chickens, geese,\r\nducks, and turkeys, while some persons class pigeons as poultry.\r\n\r\nBirds are dietetically divided into three classes: (1) the\r\nwhite-fleshed, as the common fowl and the turkey; (2) the dark-fleshed\r\ngame, as the grouse and the black-cock; and (3) the aquatic (including\r\nswimmers and waders), as the goose and the duck; the flesh of the\r\nlatter is penetrated with fat, and difficult of digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE QUANTITY OF GAME, RABBITS, AND POULTRY, SOLD IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nIt appears from inquiries that I instituted, and from authentic returns\r\nwhich I procured on the subject, that the following is the quantity\r\nof game and poultry sold yearly, as an average, in the markets of the\r\nmetropolis. I give it exclusive of such birds as wild-ducks, woodcocks,\r\n&c., the supply of which depends upon the severity of the winter. I\r\ninclude all wild birds or animals, whether considered game or not, and\r\nI use round numbers, but as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nDuring the past Christmas, however, I may observe, that the supply of\r\npoultry to the markets has been greater than on any previous occasion.\r\nThe immensity of the supply was favourable to the hawker’s profit, as\r\nthe glut enabled him to purchase both cheaply and largely. One young\r\npoultry-hawker told me that he had cleared 3_l._ in the Christmas\r\nweek, and had spent it all in four days--except 5_s._ reserved for\r\nstock-money. It was not spent _entirely_ in drunkenness, a large\r\nportion of it being expended in treats and amusements. So great,\r\nindeed, has been the supply of game and poultry this year, that a\r\nstranger, unused to the grand scale on which provisions are displayed\r\nin the great metropolitan marts, on visiting Leadenhall, a week before\r\nor after Christmas, might have imagined that the staple food of the\r\nLondon population consisted of turkeys, geese, and chickens. I give,\r\nhowever, an _average_ yearly supply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------+----------+----------+--------------\r\n                     |           |          |          | Proportion\r\n     Description.    |Leadenhall.| Newgate. |  Total.  |   sold in\r\n                     |           |          |          | the Streets.\r\n  -------------------+-----------+----------+----------+--------------\r\n       GAME, &C.     |           |          |          |\r\n  Grouse             |  45,000   |   12,000 |   57,000 |One-eleventh.\r\n  Partridges         |  85,000   |   60,000 |  145,000 |One-seventh.\r\n  Pheasants          |  44,000   |   20,000 |   64,000 |One-fifth.\r\n  Snipes             |  60,000   |   47,000 |  107,000 |One-twentieth.\r\n  Wild Birds         |  40,000   |   20,000 |   60,000 |None.\r\n  Plovers            |  28,000   |   18,000 |   46,000 |None.\r\n  Larks              | 213,000   |  100,000 |  313,000 |None.\r\n  Teals              |  10,000   |    5,000 |   15,000 |None.\r\n  Widgeons           |  30,000   |    8,000 |   38,000 |None.\r\n  Hares              |  48,000   |   55,000 |  102,000 |One-fifth.\r\n  Rabbits            | 680,000   |  180,000 |  860,000 |Three-fourths.\r\n                     +-----------+----------+----------+\r\n                     |1,283,000  |  525,000 |1,807,000 |\r\n      POULTRY.       |           |          |          |\r\n  Domestic Fowls     |1,266,000  |  490,000 |1,756,000 |One-third.\r\n  ---- ---- (alive)  |   45,000  |   15,000 |   60,000 |One-tenth.\r\n  Geese              |  888,000  |  114,000 |1,002,000 |One-fifth.\r\n  Ducks              |  235,000  |  148,000 |  383,000 |One-fourth.\r\n  ---- (alive)       |   20,000  |   20,000 |   40,000 |One-tenth.\r\n  Turkeys            |   69,000  |   55,000 |  124,000 |One-fourth.\r\n  Pigeons            |  285,000  |   98,000 |  383,000 |None.\r\n                     +-----------+----------+----------+\r\n                     |2,808,000  |  940,000 |3,748,000 |\r\n          Game, &c.  |1,283,000  |  525,000 |1,807,000 |\r\n                     +-----------+----------+----------+\r\n                     |4,091,000  | 1,465,000|5,555,000 |\r\n  -------------------+-----------+----------+----------+--------------\r\n\r\nIn the above return wild ducks and woodcocks are not included, because\r\nthe quantity sent to London is dependent entirely upon the severity\r\nof the winter.

The\r\ngreat stock of wild ducks for the London tables is from Holland, where\r\nthe duck decoys are objects of great care. Less than a fifth of the\r\nimportation from Holland is from Lincolnshire. These birds, and even\r\nthe finest and largest, have been sold during a glut at 1_s._ each.\r\nWoodcocks, under similar circumstances, number with plovers (45,000),\r\nnearly all of which are “golden plovers;” but of woodcocks the\r\ncostermongers buy very few: “They’re only a mouthful and a half,” said\r\none of them, “and don’t suit our customers.” In severe weather a few\r\nptarmigan are sent to London from Scotland, and in 1841-2 great numbers\r\nwere sent to the London markets from Norway. One salesman received\r\nnearly 10,000 ptarmigan in one day. A portion of these were disposed\r\nof to the costers, but the sale was not such as to encourage further\r\nimportations.\r\n\r\nThe returns I give show, that, at the two great game and\r\npoultry-markets, 5,500,000 birds and animals, wild and tame, are yearly\r\nsent to London. To this must be added all that may be consigned direct\r\nto metropolitan game-dealers and poulterers, besides what may be sent\r\nas presents from the country, &c., so that the London supply may be\r\nsafely estimated, I am assured, at 6,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at any very precise computation of the\r\nquantity of game and poultry sold by the costers, or rather at the\r\nmoney value (or price) of what they sell. The most experienced\r\nsalesmen agree, that, as to _quantity_, including everything popularly\r\nconsidered game (and I have so given it in the return), they sell\r\none-third. As regards _value_, however, their purchases fall very short\r\nof a third. Of the best qualities of game, and even more especially\r\nof poultry, a third of the hawkers may buy a fifteenth, compared with\r\ntheir purchases in the lower-priced kinds. The others buy none of the\r\nbest qualities. The more “aristocratic” of the poultry-hawkers will,\r\nas a rule, only buy, “when they have an order” or a sure sale, the\r\nbest quality of English turkey-cocks; which cannot be wondered at,\r\nseeing that the average price of the English turkey-cock is 12_s._ One\r\nsalesman this year sold (at Leadenhall) several turkey-cocks at 30_s._\r\neach, and one at 3_l._ The average price of an English turkey-hen\r\nis 4_s._ 6_d._, and of these the costers buy a few: but their chief\r\ntrade is in foreign turkey-hens; of which the average price (when of\r\ngood quality and in good condition) is 3_s._ The foreign turkey-cocks\r\naverage half the price of the English (or 6_s._). Of Dorking fat\r\nchickens, which average 6_s._ the couple, the hawkers buy none (save as\r\nin the case of the turkey-cocks); but of the Irish fowls, which, this\r\nseason, have averaged 2_s._ 6_d._ the couple, they buy largely. On the\r\nother hand they buy nearly all the rabbits sent from Scotland, and half\r\nof those sent from Ostend, while they “clear the market”--no matter of\r\nwhat the glut may consist--when there _is_ a glut. There is another\r\ndistinction of which the hawker avails himself. The average price of\r\nyoung plump partridges is 2_s._ 6_d._ the brace, of old partridges,\r\n2_s._; accordingly, the coster buys the old. It is the same with\r\npheasants, the young averaging 7_s._ the brace, the old 6_s._: “And I\r\ncan sell them best,” said one man; “for my customers say they’re more\r\ntastier-like. I’ve sold game for twelve years, or more, but I never\r\ntasted any of any kind, so I can’t say who’s right and who’s wrong.”\r\n\r\nThe hawkers buy, also, game and poultry which will not “keep” another\r\nday. Sometimes they puff out the breast of a chicken with fresh pork\r\nfat, which melts as the bird roasts. “It freshens the fowl, I’ve been\r\ntold, and improves it,” said one man; “and the shopkeepers now and\r\nthen, does the same. It’s a improvement, sir.”\r\n\r\nIn the present season the costers have bought of wild ducks,\r\ncomparatively, none, and of teal, widgeons, wild birds, and larks, none\r\nat all; or so sparely, as to require no notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-PURCHASERS OF GAME AND POULTRY.\r\n\r\nAs the purchasers of game and poultry are of a different class to\r\nthe costermongers’ ordinary customers, I may devote a few words to\r\nthem. From all the information that I could acquire, they appear to\r\nconsist, principally, of those who reside at a distance from any cheap\r\nmarket, and buy a cheap luxury when it is brought to their doors,\r\nas well as of those who are “always on the look-out for something\r\ntoothy, such as the shabby genteels, as they’re called, who never\r\ngives nothing but a scaly price. They’ve bargained with me till I was\r\nhard held from pitching into them, and over and over again I should,\r\nonly it would have been fourteen days anyhow. They’ll tell me my birds\r\nstinks, when they’re as sweet as flowers. They’d go to the devil to\r\nsave three farthings on a partridge.” Other buyers are old gourmands,\r\nliving perhaps on small incomes, or if possessed of ample incomes,\r\nbut confining themselves to a small expenditure; others, again, are\r\nmen who like a cheap dinner, and seldom enjoy it, at their own cost,\r\nunless it be cheap, and who best of all like “such a thing as a moor\r\nbird (grouse),” said one hawker, “which can be eat up to a man’s own\r\ncheek.” This was also the opinion of a poulterer and game-dealer, who\r\nsometimes sold “goods” to the hawkers. Of this class of “patrons” many\r\nshopkeepers, in all branches of business, have a perfect horror, as\r\nthey will care nothing for having occupied the tradesmen’s time to no\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe game and poultry street-sellers, I am told, soon find out when a\r\ncustomer is bent upon a bargain, and shape their prices accordingly.\r\nAlthough these street-sellers may generally take as their motto the\r\nannouncement so often seen in the shops of competitive tradesmen, “no\r\nreasonable offer refused,” they are sometimes so worried in bargaining\r\nthat they _do_ refuse.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation I had with a “retired” game salesman, he said it\r\nmight be curious to trace the history of a brace of birds--of grouse,\r\nfor instance--sold in the streets; and he did it after this manner.\r\nThey were shot in the Highlands of Scotland by a member of parliament\r\nwho had gladly left the senate for the moors. They were transferred\r\nto a tradesman who lived in or near some Scotch town having railway\r\ncommunication, and with whom “the honourable gentleman,” or “the\r\nnoble lord,” had perhaps endeavoured to drive a hard bargain. He (the\r\nsenator) _must_ have a good price for his birds, as he had given a\r\nlarge sum for the moor: and the season was a bad one: the birds were\r\nscarce and wild: they would soon be “packed” (be in flocks of twenty\r\nor thirty instead of in broods), and then there would be no touching a\r\nfeather of them. The canny Scot would quietly say that it was early in\r\nthe season, and the birds never packed so early; that as to price, he\r\ncould only give what he could get from a London salesman, and he was\r\n“nae just free to enter into any agreement for a fixed price at a’.”\r\nThe honourable gentleman, after much demurring, gives way, feeling\r\nperhaps that he cannot well do anything else. In due course the grouse\r\nare received in Leadenhall, and unpacked and flung about with as little\r\nceremony as if they had been “slaughtered” by a Whitechapel journeyman\r\nbutcher, at so much a head. It is a thin market, perhaps, when they\r\ncome to hand. A dealer, fashionable in the parish of St. George,\r\nHanover-square, has declined to give the price demanded; they were not\r\nhis money; “he had to give such long credit.” A dealer, popular in\r\nthe ward of Cheap, has also declined to buy, and for the same alleged\r\nreason. The salesman, knowing that some of these dealers _must_ buy,\r\nquietly says that he will take no less, and as he is known to be a\r\nman of his word, little is said upon the subject. As the hour arrives\r\nat which fashionable game-dealers are compelled to buy, or disappoint\r\ncustomers who will not brook such disappointment, the market, perhaps,\r\nis glutted, owing to a very great consignment by a later railway train.\r\nThe _Inverness Courier_, or the _North of Scotland Gazette_, are in due\r\ncourse quoted by the London papers, touching the “extraordinary sport”\r\nof a party of lords and gentlemen in the Highlands; and the “heads” of\r\ngame are particularized with a care that would do honour to a _Price\r\nCurrent_. The salesman then disposes rapidly of divers “brace” to the\r\n“hawkers,” at 1_s._ or 2_s._ the brace, and the hawker offers them to\r\nhotel-keepers, and shop-keepers, and housekeepers, selling some at\r\n3_s._ 6_d._ the brace, some at 3_s._, at 2_s._ 6_d._, at 2_s._, and at\r\nless. “At last,” said my informant, “he may sell the finest brace of\r\nhis basket, which he has held back to get a better price for, at 6_d._\r\na-piece, rather than keep them over-night, and that to a woman of the\r\ntown, whom he may have met reeling home with money in her purse. Thus\r\nthe products of an honourable gentleman’s skilful industry, on which\r\nhe greatly prided himself, are eaten by the woman and her ‘fancy man,’\r\ngrumblingly enough, for they pronounce the birds inferior to tripe.”\r\n\r\nThe best quarters for the street-sale of game and poultry are, I\r\nam informed from several sources, either the business parts of the\r\nmetropolis, or else the houses in the several suburbs which are the\r\nfurthest from a market or from a business part. The squares, crescents,\r\nplaces, and streets, that do not partake of one or the other of these\r\ncharacteristics, are pronounced “no good.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A GAME HAWKER.\r\n\r\nThe man who gave me the following information was strong and robust,\r\nand had a weather-beaten look. He seemed about fifty. He wore when I\r\nsaw him a large velveteen jacket, a cloth waistcoat which had been once\r\ngreen, and brown corduroy trousers. No part of his attire, though it\r\nseemed old, was patched, his shirt being clean and white. He evidently\r\naimed at the gamekeeper style of dress. He affected some humour, and\r\nwas dogged in his opinions:\r\n\r\n“I was a gentleman’s footman when I was a young man,” he said, “and\r\nsaw life both in town and country; so I knows what things belongs.” [A\r\ncommon phrase among persons of his class to denote their being men of\r\nthe world.] “I never liked the confinement of service, and besides\r\nthe upper servants takes on so. The others puts up with it more than\r\nthey would, I suppose, because they hopes to be butlers themselves in\r\ntime. The only decent people in the house I lived in last was master\r\nand missus. I won 20_l._, and got it too, on the Colonel, when he\r\nwon the Leger. Master was a bit of a turf gentleman, and so we all\r\ndabbled--like master like man, you know, sir. I think that was in 1828,\r\nbut I’m not certain. We came to London not long after Doncaster” [he\r\nmeant Doncaster races], “something about a lawsuit, and that winter I\r\nleft service and bought the goodwill of a coffee-shop for 25_l._ It\r\ndidn’t answer. I wasn’t up to the coffee-making, I think; there’s a\r\ndeal of things belongs to all things; so I got out of it, and after\r\nthat I was in service again, and then I was a boots at an inn. But\r\nI couldn’t settle to nothing long; I’m of a free spirit, you see. I\r\nwas hard up at last, and I popped my watch for a sovereign, because\r\na friend of mine--we sometimes drank together of a night--said he\r\ncould put me in the pigeon and chicken line; that was what he called\r\nit, but it meant game. This just suited me, for I’d been out with\r\nthe poachers when I was a lad, and indeed when I was in service, out\r\nof a night on the sly; so I knew they got stiffish prices. My friend\r\ngot me the pigeons. I believe he cheated me, but he’s gone to glory.\r\nThe next season game was made legal eating. Before that I cleared\r\nfrom 25_s._ to 40_s._ a week by selling my ‘pigeons.’ I carried real\r\npigeons as well, which I said was my own rearing at Gravesend. I sold\r\nmy game pigeons--there was all sorts of names for them--in the City,\r\nand sometimes in the Strand, or Charing-cross, or Covent-garden. I\r\nsold to shopkeepers. Oft enough I’ve been offered so much tea for a\r\nhare. I sometimes had a hare in each pocket, but they was very awkward\r\ncarriage; if one was sold, the other sagged so. I very seldom sold\r\nthem, at that time, at less than 3_s._ 6_d._, often 4_s._ 6_d._, and\r\nsometimes 5_s._ or more. I once sold a thumping old jack-hare to a\r\ndraper for 6_s._; it was Christmas time, and he thought it was a\r\nbeauty. I went into the country after that, among my friends, and had\r\na deal of ups and downs in different parts. I was a navvy part of the\r\ntime, till five or six year back I came to London again, and got into\r\nmy old trade; but it’s quite a different thing now. I hawks grouse,\r\nand every thing, quite open. Leadenhall and Newgate is my markets.\r\nSix of one and half-a-dozen of t’other. When there’s a great arrival\r\nof game, after a game battle” (he would so call a _battue_) “and it’s\r\nwarm weather, that’s my time of day, for then I can buy cheap. A muggy\r\nday, when it’s close and warm, is best of all. I have a tidy bit of\r\nconnection now in game, and don’t touch poultry when I can get game.\r\nGrouse is the first thing I get to sell. They are legal eating on the\r\n12th of August, but as there’s hundreds of braces sold in London that\r\nday, and as they’re shot in Scotland and Yorkshire, and other places\r\nwhere there’s moors, in course they’re killed before it’s legal. It’s\r\nnot often I can get them early in the season; not the first week,\r\nbut I have had three brace two days before they were legal, and sold\r\nthem at 5_s._ a brace; they cost me 3_s._ 3_d._, but I was told I\r\nwas favoured. I got them of a dealer, but that’s a secret. I sold a\r\nfew young partridges with grouse this year at 1_s._ 6_d._ and 1_s._\r\n9_d._ a piece, allowing 2_d._ or 3_d._ if a brace was taken. They\r\nweren’t legal eating till the 1st of September, but they was shot by\r\ngrouse shooters, and when I hawked them I called them quails. Lord,\r\nsir, gentlefolks--and I serve a good many, leastways their cooks, and\r\nnow and then themselves--_they_ don’t make a fuss about Game Laws;\r\nthey’ve too much sense. I’ve bought grouse quite fresh and fine when\r\nthere’s been a lot, and bad keeping weather, at 1_s._ and 15_d._\r\neach. I’ve sold them sometimes at 1_s._ 6_d._ and 2_s._ each, and\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ the big ones, but only twice or thrice. If you ask very\r\nlow at first, people won’t buy, only a few good judges, ’cause they\r\nthink something must be amiss. I once bought a dozen good hares, on\r\na Saturday afternoon, for 10_s._ 6_d._ It was jolly hot, and I could\r\nhardly sell them. I got 1_s._ 6_d._ a piece for three of them; 2_s._\r\nfor the finest one; 1_s._ 3_d._ for five, no, for four; 1_s._ 10_d._\r\nfor two; and I had a deal of trouble to get a landlord to take the last\r\ntwo for 1_s._ 6_d._, to wipe off a bit of a drink score. I didn’t do\r\nso bad as it was, but if it hadn’t been Saturday, I should have made\r\na good thing of ’em. It’s very hard work carrying a dozen hares; and\r\nevery one of that lot--except two, and _they_ was fine leverets--was\r\nas cheap as butcher’s meat at half-a-crown a piece. I’ve done middling\r\nin partridges this year. I’ve bought them, but mixed things they was,\r\nas low as from 10_d._ to 16_d._ a brace, and have made a profit, big\r\nor little as happened, on every one. People that’s regular customers I\r\nalways charge 6_d._ profit in 2_s._ 6_d._ to, and that’s far cheaper\r\nthan they can get served other ways. It’s chiefly the game battles that\r\ndoes so much to cheapen partridges or peasants” (so he always called\r\npheasants); “and it’s only then I meddles with peasants. They’re sold\r\nhandier than the other birds at the shops, I think. They’re legal\r\neating on the 1st of October. Such nonsense! why isn’t mutton made\r\nlegal eating, only just at times, as well? In very hard weather I’ve\r\ndone well on wild ducks. They come over here when the weather’s a\r\nclipper, for you see cold weather suits some birds and kills others.\r\nIt aint hard weather that’s driven them here; the frost has drawed\r\nthem here, because it’s only then they’re cheap. I’ve bought beauties\r\nat 1_s._ a piece, and one day I cleared 10_s._ 6_d._ out of twelve\r\nbrace of them. I’ve often cleared 6_s._ and 7_s._--at least as often\r\nas there’s been a chance. I knew a man that did uncommon well on them;\r\nand he once told a parson, or a journeyman parson, I don’t know what\r\nhe was, that if ever _he_ prayed it was for a hard winter and lots of\r\nwild ducks. I’ve done a little sometimes in plover, and woodcock, and\r\nsnipe, but not so much. I never plays no tricks with _my_ birds. I\r\ntrims them up to look well, certainly. If they won’t keep, and won’t\r\nsell, I sticks them into a landlord I knows, as likes them high, for\r\na quartern or a pot, or anything. It’s often impossible to keep them.\r\nIf they’re hard hit it’s soon up with them. A sportsman, if he has a\r\ngood dog--but you’ll know that if you’ve ever been a shooting, sir--may\r\nget close upon a covey of young partridges before he springs them, and\r\nthen give them his one, two, with both barrels, and they’re riddled to\r\nbits. I may make 18_s._ a week all the year round, because I have a\r\nconnection. I’m very much respected, I thinks, on my round, for I deal\r\nfair; that there, sir, breeds respect, you know. When I can’t get game\r\n(birds) I can sometimes, indeed often, get hares, and mostly rabbits.\r\nI’ve hawked venson, but did no good--though I cried it at 4_d._ the lb.\r\nMy best weeks is worth 30_s._ to 35_s._, my worst is 6_s._ to 10_s._\r\nI’m a good deal in the country, working it. I’m forced to sell fish\r\nsometimes. Geese I sometimes join a mate in selling. I don’t mix much\r\nwith the costermongers; in coorse I knows some. I live middling. Do I\r\never eat my own game if it’s high? No, sir, never. I couldn’t stand\r\nsuch cag-mag--my stomach couldn’t--though I’ve been a gentleman’s\r\nservant. Such stuff don’t suit nobody but rich people, whose stomach’s\r\ndiseased by over-feeding, and that’s been brought up to it, like. I’ve\r\nonly myself to keep now. I’ve had a wife or two, but we parted” (this\r\nwas said gravely enough); “there was nothing to hinder us. I see them\r\nsometimes and treat them.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of game annually sold in the London streets is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Grouse        5,000\r\n  Partridges   20,000\r\n  Pheasants    12,000\r\n  Snipes        5,000\r\n  Hares        20,000\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF TWO POULTRY HAWKERS.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers, both good-looking and well-spoken young men--one I\r\nmight characterise as handsome--gave me the following account. I\r\nfound them unwilling to speak of their youth, and did not press them.\r\nI was afterwards informed that their parents died within the same\r\nmonth, and that the family was taken into the workhouse; but the two\r\nboys left it in a little time, and before they could benefit by any\r\nschooling. Neither of them could read or write. They left, I believe,\r\nwith some little sum in hand, to “start theirselves.” An intelligent\r\ncostermonger, who was with me when I saw the two brothers, told me that\r\n“a costermonger would rather be thought to have come out of prison\r\nthan out of a workhouse,” for his “mates” would say, if they heard he\r\nhad been locked up, “O, he’s only been quodded for pitching into a\r\ncrusher.” The two brothers wore clean smock country frocks over their\r\ndress, and made a liberal display of their clean, but coarse, shirts.\r\nIt was on a Monday that I saw them. What one brother said, the other\r\nconfirmed: so I use the plural “we.”\r\n\r\n“We sell poultry and game, but stick most to poultry, which suits\r\nour connection best. We buy at Leadenhall. We’re never cheated in\r\nthe things we buy; indeed, perhaps, we could’nt be. A salesman will\r\nsay--Mr. H---- will--‘Buy, if you like, I can’t recommend them. Use\r\nyour own judgment. They’re cheap.’ He has only one price, and that’s\r\noften a low one. We give from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 9_d._ for good chickens,\r\nand from 2_s._ 6_d._ mostly for geese and turkeys. Pigeons is 1_s._\r\n9_d._ to 3_s._ a dozen. We aim at 6_d._ profit on chickens; and 1_s._,\r\nif we can get it, or 6_d._ if we can do no better, on geese and\r\nturkeys. Ducks are the same as chickens. All the year through, we may\r\nmake 12_s._ a week a piece. We work together, one on one side of the\r\nstreet and the other on the other. It answers best that way. People\r\nfind we can’t undersell one another. We buy the poultry, whenever\r\nwe can, undressed, and dress them ourselves; pull the feathers off\r\nand make them ready for cooking. We sell cheaper than the shops, or\r\nwe couldn’t sell at all. But you must be known, to do any trade, or\r\npeople will think your poultry’s bad. We work game as well, but mostly\r\npoultry. We’ve been on hares to-day, mostly, and have made about\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ a piece, but that’s an extra day. Our best customers are\r\ntradesmen in a big way, and people in the houses a little way out of\r\ntown. Working people don’t buy of us now. We’re going to a penny gaff\r\nto-night” (it was then between four and five); “we’ve no better way of\r\nspending our time when our day’s work is done.”\r\n\r\nFrom the returns before given, the street-sale of poultry amounts\r\nyearly to\r\n\r\n  500,000  fowls.\r\n   80,000  ducks.\r\n   20,000  geese.\r\n   30,000  turkeys.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF LIVE POULTRY.\r\n\r\nThe street trade in live poultry is not considerable, and has become\r\nless considerable every year, since the facilities of railway\r\nconveyance have induced persons in the suburbs to make their purchases\r\nin London rather than of the hawkers. Geese used to be bought very\r\nlargely by the hawkers in Leadenhall, and were driven in flocks to the\r\ncountry, 500 being a frequent number of a flock. Their sale commenced\r\nabout six miles from town in all directions, the purchasers being\r\nthose who, having the necessary convenience, liked to fatten their own\r\nChristmas geese, and the birds when bought were small and lean. A few\r\nflocks, with 120 or 150 in each, are still disposed of in this way; but\r\nthe trade is not a fifth of what it was. As this branch of the business\r\nis not in the hands of the hawkers, but generally of country poulterers\r\nresident in the towns not far from the metropolis, I need but allude to\r\nit. A few flocks of ducks are driven in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe street trade in live poultry continues only for three months--from\r\nthe latter part of June to the latter part of September. At this\r\nperiod, the hawkers say, as they can’t get “dead” they must get\r\n“live.” During these three months the hawkers sell 500 chickens and\r\n300 ducks weekly, by hawking, or 10,400 in the season of 13 weeks.\r\nOccasionally, as many as 50 men and women--the same who hawk dead game\r\nand poultry--are concerned in the traffic I am treating of. At other\r\ntimes there are hardly 30, and in some not 20 so employed, for if the\r\nweather be temperate, dead poultry is preferred to live by the hawkers.\r\nTaking the average of “live” sellers at 25 every week, it gives only a\r\ntrade of 32 birds each weekly. Some, however, will sell 18 in a day;\r\nbut others, who occasionally resort to the trade, only a dozen in a\r\nweek. The birds are sometimes carried in baskets on the hawker’s arm,\r\ntheir heads being let through network at the top; but more frequently\r\nthey are hawked in open wicker-work coops carried on the head. The best\r\nlive poultry are from Surrey and Sussex; the inferior from Ireland, and\r\nperhaps more than three-fourths of that sold by the hawkers is Irish.\r\n\r\nThe further nature of the trade, and the class of customers, is shown\r\nin the following statement, given to me by a middle-aged man, who had\r\nbeen familiar with the trade from his youth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” he said, “I’ve had a turn at live poultry for--let me\r\nsee--someways between twenty and twenty-five years. The business is\r\na sweater, sir; it’s heavy work, but ‘live’ aint so heavy as ‘dead.’\r\nThere’s fewer of them to carry in a round, that’s it. Ah! twenty years\r\nago, or better, live poultry was worth following. I did a good bit in\r\nit. I’ve sold 160 fowls and ducks, and more, in a week, and cleared\r\nabout 4_l._ But out of that I had to give a man 1_s._ a day, and his\r\npeck, to help me. At that time I sold my ducks and chickens--I worked\r\nnothing else--at from 2_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ a piece, according to size\r\nand quality. Now, if I get from 14_d._ to 2_s._ it’s not so bad. I\r\nsell more, I think, however, over 1_s._ 6_d._ than under it, but I’m\r\nperticler in my ‘live.’ I never sold to any but people out of town that\r\nhad convenience to keep them, and Lord knows, I’ve seen ponds I could\r\njump over reckoned prime for ducks. Them that keeps their gardens nice\r\nwon’t buy live poultry. I’ve seldom sold to the big houses anything\r\nlike to what I’ve done to the smaller. The big houses, you see, goes\r\nfor fancy bantems, such as Sir John Seabright’s, or Spanish hens, or\r\na bit of a game cross, or real game--just for ornament, and not for\r\nfighting--or for anything that’s got its name up. I’ve known young\r\ncouples buy fowls to have their breakfast eggs from them. One young\r\nlady told me to bring her--that’s fifteen year ago, it is so--six\r\ncouples, that I knew would lay. I told her she’d better have five hens\r\nto a cock, and she didn’t seem pleased, but I’m sure I don’t know why,\r\nfor I hope I’m always civil. I told her there would be murder if there\r\nwas a cock to every hen. I supplied her, and made 6_s._ by the job. I\r\n_have_ sold live fowls to the Jews about Whitechapel, on my way to\r\nStratford and Bow, but only when I’ve bought a bargain and sold one.\r\nI don’t know nothing how the Jews kills their fowls. Last summer I\r\ndidn’t make 1_s._ 6_d._ a day; no, nor more than three half-crowns a\r\nweek in ‘live.’ But that’s only part of my trade. I don’t complain,\r\nso it’s nothing to nobody what I makes. From Beever (De Beauvoir)\r\nTown to Stamford Hill, and on to Tottenham and Edmonton, and turning\r\noff Walthamstow way is as good a round as any for live; it is so; but\r\nnothing to what it was. Highgate and Hampstead is middling. The t’other\r\nside the water isn’t good at all.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALLFLOWER GIRL.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nFancy chickens, I may add, are never hawked, nor are live pigeons, nor\r\ngeese, nor turkeys.\r\n\r\nThe hawkers’ sale of live poultry may be taken, at a moderate\r\ncomputation, as 6,500 chickens, and 3,900 ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF RABBIT SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nRabbit-selling cannot be said to be a distinct branch of\r\ncostermongering, but some street-sellers devote themselves to it more\r\nexclusively than to other “goods,” and, for five or six months of the\r\nyear, sell little else. It is not often, though it is sometimes, united\r\nwith the game or poultry trade, as a stock of rabbits, of a dozen or a\r\ndozen and a half, is a sufficient load for one man. The best sale for\r\nrabbits is in the suburbs. They are generally carried slung two and\r\ntwo on a long pole, which is supported on the man’s shoulders, or on a\r\nshort one which is carried in the hand. Lately, they have been hawked\r\nabout hung up on a barrow. The trade is the briskest in the autumn and\r\nwinter months; but some men carry them, though they do not confine\r\nthemselves to the traffic in them, all the year round. The following\r\nstatement shows the nature of the trade.\r\n\r\n“I was born and bred a costermonger,” he said, “and I’ve been concerned\r\nwith everything in the line. I’ve been mostly ‘on rabbits’ these five\r\nor six years, but I always sold a few, and now sometimes I sell a\r\nhare or two, and, if rabbits is too dear, I tumble on to fish. I buy\r\nat Leadenhall mainly. I’ve given from 6_s._ to 14_s._ a dozen for my\r\nrabbits. The usual price is from 5_s._ to 8_s._ a dozen. [I may remark\r\nthat the costers buy nearly all the Scotch rabbits, at an average of\r\n6_s._ the dozen; and the Ostend rabbits, which are a shilling or two\r\ndearer.] They’re Hampshire rabbits; but I don’t know where Hampshire\r\nis. I know they’re from Hampshire, for they’re called ‘Wild Hampshire\r\nrabbits, 1_s._ a pair.’ But still, as you say, that’s only a call.\r\nI never sell a rabbit at 6_d._, in course--it costs more. My way in\r\nbusiness is to get 2_d._ profit, and the skin, on every rabbit. If they\r\ncost me 8_d._, I try to get 10_d._ It’s the skins is the profit. The\r\nskins now brings me from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 9_d._ a dozen. They’re best\r\nin frosty weather. The fur’s thickest then. It grows best in frost, I\r\nsuppose. If I sell a dozen, it’s a tidy day’s work. If I get 2_d._\r\na-piece on them, and the skins at 1_s._ 3_d._, it’s 3_s._ 3_d._, but I\r\ndont sell above 5 dozen in a week--that’s 16_s._ 3_d._ a week, sir, is\r\nit? Wet and dark weather is against me. People won’t often buy rabbits\r\nby candlelight, if they’re ever so sweet. Some weeks in spring and\r\nsummer I can’t sell above two dozen rabbits. I have sold two dozen and\r\nten on a Saturday in the country, but then I had a young man to help\r\nme. I sell the skins to a warehouse for hatters. My old ’oman works a\r\nlittle fish at a stall sometimes, but she only can in fine weather,\r\nfor we’ve a kid that can hardly walk, and it don’t do to let it stand\r\nout in the cold. Perhaps I may make 10_s._ to 14_s._ a week all the\r\nyear round. I’m paying 1_s._ a week for 1_l._ borrowed, and paid 2_s._\r\nall last year; but I’ll pay no more after Christmas. I did better on\r\nrabbits four or five year back, because I sold more to working-people\r\nand small shopkeepers than I do now. I suppose it’s because they’re not\r\nso well off now as they was then, and, as you say, butchers’-meat may\r\nbe cheaper now, and tempts them. I do best short ways in the country.\r\nWandsworth way ain’t bad. No more is parts of Stoke-Newington and\r\nStamford-hill. St. John’s Wood and Hampstead is middling. Hackney’s\r\nbad. I goes all ways. I dont know what sort of people’s my best\r\ncustomers. Two of ’em, I’ve been told, is banker’s clerks, so in course\r\nthey is rich.”\r\n\r\nThere are 600,000 rabbits sold every year in the streets of London;\r\nthese, at 7_d._ a-piece, give 17,500_l._ thus expended annually in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.\r\n\r\nAll these commodities used to be hawked in the streets, and to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Until, as nearly as I can ascertain, between\r\ntwenty and thirty years back, butter was brought from Epping, and\r\nother neighbouring parts, where good pasture existed, and hawked in\r\nthe streets of London, usually along with poultry and eggs. This trade\r\nis among the more ancient of the street-trades. Steam-vessels and\r\nrailways, however, have so stocked the markets, that no hawking of\r\nbutter or eggs, from any agricultural part, even the nearest to London,\r\nwould be remunerative now. Eggs are brought in immense quantities from\r\nFrance and Belgium, though thirty, or even twenty years ago the notion\r\nhaving of a good French egg, at a London breakfast-table, would have\r\nbeen laughed at as an absurd attempt at an impossible achievement. The\r\nnumber of eggs now annually imported into this kingdom, is 98,000,000,\r\nhalf of which may be said to be the yearly consumption of London. No\r\nbutter is now hawked, but sometimes a few “new laid” eggs are carried\r\nfrom a rural part to the nearest metropolitan suburb, and are sold\r\nreadily enough, if the purveyor be known. Mr. M’Culloch estimates the\r\naverage consumption of butter, in London, at 6,250,000 lbs. per annum,\r\nor 5 oz., weekly, each individual.\r\n\r\nThe hawking of cheese was never a prominent part of the street-trade.\r\nOf late, its sale in the streets, may be described as accidental. A\r\nconsiderable quantity of American cheese was hawked, or more commonly\r\nsold at a standing, five or six years ago; unto December last, and for\r\nthree months preceding, cheese was sold in the streets which had been\r\nrejected from Government stores, as it would not “keep” for the period\r\nrequired; but it was good for immediate consumption, for which all\r\nstreet-goods are required. This, and the American cheese, were both\r\nsold in the streets at 3_d._ the pound; usually, at fair weights, I am\r\ntold, for it might not be easy to deceive the poor in a thing of such\r\nfrequent purchase as “half a quarter or a quarter” (of a pound) of\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of foreign cheese consumed, yearly, in the\r\nmetropolis may be estimated at 25,000,000 lbs. weight, or half of the\r\ngross quantity annually imported.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows the quantity and sum paid for the game\r\nand poultry sold in London streets:\r\n\r\n                                                      £\r\n    5,000 grouse, at 1_s._ 9_d._ each                437\r\n   20,000 partridges, at 1_s._ 6_d._               1,500\r\n   12,000 pheasants, at 3_s._ 6_d._                2,100\r\n    5,000 snipes, at 8_d._                           166\r\n   20,000 hares, at 2_s._ 3_d._                    2,250\r\n  600,000 rabbits, at 7_d._                       17,500\r\n  500,000 fowls, at 1_s._ 6_d._                   37,500\r\n   20,000 geese, at 2_s._ 6_d._                    2,500\r\n   80,000 ducks, at 1_s._ 6_d._                    6,000\r\n   30,000 turkeys, at 3_s._ 6_d._                  5,250\r\n   10,000 live fowls and ducks, at 1_s._ 6_d._       750\r\n                                                 -------\r\n                                                 £75,953\r\n\r\nIn this table I do not give the _refuse_ game and poultry, bought\r\nsometimes for the mere feathers, when “undressed;” neither are the\r\nwild ducks nor woodcocks, nor those things of which the costers buy\r\nonly exceptionally, included. Adding these, it may be said, that with\r\nthe street sale of butter, cheese, and eggs, 80,000_l._ are annually\r\nexpended in the streets on this class of articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SELLERS OF TREES, SHRUBS, FLOWERS (CUT AND IN POTS), ROOTS,\r\nSEEDS, AND BRANCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of whom I have now to treat comprise those who\r\ndeal in trees and shrubs, in flowers (whether in pots, or merely with\r\nsoil attached to the roots, or cut from the plant as it grows in the\r\ngarden), and in seeds and branches (as of holly, mistletoe, ivy, yew,\r\nlaurel, palm, lilac, and may). The “root-sellers” (as the dealers in\r\nflowers in pots are mostly called) rank, when in a prosperous business,\r\nwith the highest “aristocracy” of the street-greengrocers. The\r\ncondition of a portion of them, may be characterised by a term which\r\nis readily understood as “comfortable,” that is to say, comparatively\r\ncomfortable, when the circumstances of other street-sellers are\r\nconsidered. I may here remark, that though there are a great number\r\nof Scotchmen connected with horticultural labour in England, but more\r\nin the provincial than the metropolitan districts, there is not one\r\nScotchman concerned in the metropolitan street-sale of flowers; nor,\r\nindeed, as I have good reason to believe, is there a single Scotchman\r\nearning his bread as a costermonger in London. A non-commissioned\r\nofficer in an infantry regiment, a Scotchman, whom I met with a few\r\nmonths back, in the course of my inquiries concerning street musicians,\r\ntold me that he thought any of his young countrymen, if hard pushed “to\r\nget a crust,” would enlist, rather than resort, even under favourable\r\ncircumstances, to any kind of street-sale in London.\r\n\r\nThe dealers in trees and shrubs are the same as the root-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said, but with some few exceptions, of the seed-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in holly, mistletoe, and all kinds of evergreens known\r\nas “Christmas,” is in the hands of the coster boys more than the men,\r\nwhile the trade in may, &c., is almost altogether confined to these\r\nlads.\r\n\r\nThe root-sellers do not reside in any particular localities, but there\r\nare more of them living in the outskirts than in the thickly populated\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of cut flowers present characteristics peculiarly\r\ntheir own. This trade is mostly in the hands of girls, who are of two\r\nclasses. This traffic ranks with the street sale of water-cresses and\r\ncongreves, that is to say, among the lowest grades of the street-trade,\r\nbeing pursued only by the very poor, or the very young.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE QUANTITY OF SHRUBS, “ROOTS,” FLOWERS, ETC., SOLD IN THE STREETS,\r\nAND OF THE BUYERS.\r\n\r\nThe returns which I caused to be procured, to show the extent of the\r\nbusiness carried on in the metropolitan markets, give the following\r\nresults as to the quantity of trees, shrubs, flowers, roots, and\r\nbranches, sold wholesale in London, as well as the proportion retailed\r\nin the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE SHOWING THE QUANTITY OF TREES, SHRUBS, FLOWERS, ROOTS, AND\r\n BRANCHES SOLD ANNUALLY, WHOLESALE, AT THE METROPOLITAN MARKETS, AND\r\n THE PROPORTION

is that of “All\r\na-growing--all a-blowing” heard for the first time in the season. It is\r\nthat of the “root-seller” who has stocked his barrow with primroses,\r\nviolets, and daisies. Their beauty and fragrance gladden the senses;\r\nand the first and, perhaps, unexpected sight of them may prompt hopes\r\nof the coming year, such as seem proper to the spring.\r\n\r\nCobbett has insisted, and with unquestioned truth, that a fondness\r\nfor bees and flowers is among the very best characteristics of the\r\nEnglish peasant. I consider it equally unquestionable that a fondness\r\nfor in-door flowers, is indicative of the good character and healthful\r\ntastes, as well as of the domestic and industrious habits, of the city\r\nartizan. Among some of the most intelligent and best-conducted of these\r\nartizans, I may occasionally have found, on my visits to their homes,\r\nneither flowers nor birds, but then I have found books.\r\n\r\nUnited with the fondness for the violet, the wallflower, the rose--is\r\nthe presence of the quality which has been pronounced the handmaiden of\r\nall the virtues--cleanliness. I believe that the bunch of violets, on\r\nwhich a poor woman or her husband has expended 1_d._, rarely ornaments\r\nan unswept hearth. In my investigations, I could not but notice how\r\nthe presence or absence of flowers, together with other indications\r\nof the better tastes, marked the difference between the well-paid\r\nand the ill-paid workman. Concerning the tailors, for instance, I\r\nhad occasion to remark, of the dwellings of these classes:--“In the\r\none, you occasionally find small statues of Shakspere beneath glass\r\nshades; in the other, all is dirt and fœtor. The working-tailor’s\r\ncomfortable first-floor at the West-end is redolent with the perfume\r\nof the small bunch of violets that stands in a tumbler over the\r\nmantel-piece; the sweater’s wretched garret is rank with the stench of\r\nfilth and herrings.” The presence of the bunch of flowers of itself\r\ntells us of “a better state of things” elevating the workman; for,\r\namidst the squalid poverty and fustiness of a slopworker’s garret, the\r\nnostril loses its daintiness of sense, so that even a freshly fragrant\r\nwallflower is only so many yellow petals and green leaves.\r\n\r\nA love of flowers is also observable among men whose avocations are out\r\nof doors, and those whose habits are necessarily those of order and\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nAmong this class are such persons as gentlemen’s coachmen, who\r\ndelight in the display of a flower or two in the button-holes of\r\ntheir coats when out of doors, and in small vases in their rooms in\r\ntheir masters’ mews. I have even seen the trellis work opposite the\r\nwindows of cabmen’s rooms, which were over stables, with a projecting\r\nroof covering the whole, thickly yellow and green with the flowers\r\nand leaves of the easily-trained nasturtium and herb “twopence.” The\r\nomnibus driver occasionally “sports a nosegay”--as he himself might\r\nword it--in his button-hole; and the stage-coachman of old felt he was\r\nimproperly dressed if a big bunch of flowers were not attached to his\r\ncoat. Sailors ashore are likewise generally fond of flowers.\r\n\r\nA delight in flowers is observable, also, among the workers whose\r\nhandicraft requires the exercise of taste, and whose eyes are sensible,\r\nfrom the nature of their employment, to the beauty of colour. To this\r\nclass belong especially the Spitalfields’ silk-weavers. At one time\r\nthe Spitalfields weavers were almost the only botanists in London, and\r\ntheir love of flowers is still strong. I have seen fuchsias gladdening\r\nthe weaver’s eyes by being placed near his loom, their crimson pendants\r\nswinging backwards and forwards to the motion of the treadles, while\r\nhis small back garden has been many-coloured with dahlias. These\r\nweavers, too, were at one time highly-successful as growers of tulips.\r\n\r\nThose out-door workmen, whose calling is of coarse character, are never\r\nknown to purchase flowers, which to them are mere trumpery. Perhaps no\r\none of my readers ever saw a flower in the possession of a flusherman,\r\nnightman, slaughterer, sweep, gaslayer, gut and tripe-preparer, or\r\nsuch like labourer. _Their_ eyes convey to the mind no appreciation of\r\nbeauty, and the sense of smell is actually dead in them, except the\r\nodour be rank exceedingly.\r\n\r\nThe fondness for flowers in London is strongest in the women, and,\r\nperhaps, strongest in those whose callings are in-door and sedentary.\r\nFlowers are to them a companionship.\r\n\r\nIt remains only for me to state that, in the poorest districts, and\r\namong people where there is no sense of refinement or but a small love\r\nfor natural objects, flowers are little known. Flowers are not bought\r\nby the slop-workers, the garret and chamber-masters of Bethnal-green,\r\nnor in the poor Irish districts, nor by the City people. Indeed, as I\r\nhave observed, there is not a flower-stand in the city.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that, in poor districts, the first appearance\r\nof flowers conveys to the slop-workman only one pleasurable\r\nassociation--that the season of warmth has arrived, and that he will\r\nnot only escape being chilled with cold, but that he will be delivered\r\nfrom the heavy burden of providing fire and candle.\r\n\r\nA pleasant-looking man, with an appearance which the vulgar\r\ncharacterise as “jolly,” and with hearty manners, gave me the following\r\naccount as to the character of his customers. He had known the business\r\nsince he was a boy, his friends having been in it previously. He said:\r\n\r\n“There’s one old gentleman a little way out of town, he always gives\r\n1_s._ for the first violet root that any such as me carries there. I’m\r\noften there before any others: ‘Ah!’ he says, ‘here you are; you’ve\r\ncome, like Buonaparte, with your violet.’ I don’t know exactly what he\r\nmeans. I don’t like to ask him you see; for, though he’s civil, he’s\r\nnot what you may call a free sort of man--that’s it.” [I explained\r\nto him that the allusion was to Buonaparte’s emblem of the violet,\r\nwith the interpretation he or his admirers gave to it--“I come in the\r\nspring.”] “That’s it, sir, is it?” he resumed; “well, I’m glad I know,\r\nbecause I don’t like to be puzzled. Mine’s a puzzling trade, though.\r\nViolets have a good sale. I’ve sold six dozen roots in a day, and only\r\nhalf as many primroses and double-daisies, if half. Everybody likes\r\nviolets. I’ve sold some to poor people in town, but they like their\r\nroots in pots. They haven’t a bit of a garden for ’em. More shame too\r\nI say, when they pays such rents. People that sits working all day is\r\nvery fond of a sweet flower. A gentleman that’s always a-writing or\r\na-reading in his office--he’s in the timber-trade--buys something of\r\nme every time I see him; twice or thrice a week, sometimes. I can’t\r\nsay what he does with them all. Barmaids, though you mightn’t think\r\nit, sir, is wery tidy customers. So, sometimes, is young women that’s\r\nin an improper way of life, about Lisson-grove, and in some parts near\r\nOxford-street. They buys all sorts. Perhaps more stocks than anything,\r\nfor they’re beautiful roots, and not dear. I’ve sold real beauties for\r\n2_d._--real beauties, but small; 6_d._ is a fair price; one stock will\r\nperfume a house. I tell my customers not to sleep with them in the\r\nroom; it isn’t good for the health. A doctor told me that, and said,\r\n‘You ought to give me a fuchsia for my opinion.’ That was his joke.\r\nPrimroses I sell most of--they’re not in pots--two or three or four\r\nmiles out of town, and most if a family’s come into a new house, or\r\nchanged their house, if there’s children. The young ones teases the old\r\nones to buy them to set in the garden, and when children gets fairly to\r\nwork that way, it’s a sure sale. If they can’t get over father, they’ll\r\nget over mother. Busy men never buy flowers, as far as I’ve seen.” [‘In\r\nno thoroughfare in the city, I am assured, is there a flower-stand--a\r\ncircumstance speaking volumes as to the habits and tastes of the\r\npeople. Of fruit-stalls and chop-houses there are in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Exchange, more than in any other part of London perhaps--the\r\nfaculty of perceiving the beauty of colour, form, and perfume, as\r\ncombined in flowers is not common to the man of business. The pleasures\r\nof the palate, however, they can all understand.’] “Parsons and doctors\r\nare often tidy customers,” resumed my informant. “They have a good deal\r\nof sitting and reading, I believe. I’ve heard a parson say to his wife,\r\n‘Do, my dear, go and buy a couple of those wallflowers for my study.’ I\r\ndon’t do much for working-men; the women’s my best customers. There’s a\r\nshoemaker to be sure comes down sometimes with his old woman to lay out\r\n2_d._ or 3_d._ on me; ‘Let’s have something that smells strong,’ he’ll\r\nsay, ‘stronger than cobbler’s wax; for, though I can’t smell that,\r\nothers can.’ I’ve sold him musks (musk-plants) as often as anything.\r\n\r\n“The poor people buy rather largely at times; that is, many of them\r\nbuy. One day last summer, my old woman and me sold 600 penny pots\r\nof mignonette; and all about you saw them--and it was a pleasure to\r\nsee them--in the poor women’s windows. The women are far the best\r\ncustomers. There was the mignonette behind the bits of bars they have,\r\nin the shape of gates and such like, in the front of their windows, in\r\nthe way of preventing the pots falling into the street. Mignonette’s\r\nthe best of all for a sure sale; where can you possibly have a sweeter\r\nor a nicer penn’orth, pot and all.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF TREES AND SHRUBS.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in trees and shrubs is an appendage of “root-selling,”\r\nand not an independent avocation. The season of supply at the markets\r\nextends over July, August, September, and October, with a smaller trade\r\nin the winter and spring months. At the nursery gardens, from the best\r\ndata I can arrive at, there are about twice as many trees and shrubs\r\npurchased as in the markets by the costermongers. Nor is this the only\r\ndifference. It is the more costly descriptions that are bought at the\r\nnursery grounds.\r\n\r\nThe trees and shrubs are bought at the gardens under precisely the\r\nsame circumstances as the roots, but the trade is by no means popular\r\nwith the root-sellers. They regard these heavy, cumbrous goods, as\r\nthe smarter costers do such things as turnips and potatoes, requiring\r\nmore room, and yielding less profit. “It breaks a man’s heart,” said\r\none dealer, “and half kills his beast, going round with a lot of heavy\r\nthings, that perhaps you can’t sell.” The street-dealers say they must\r\nkeep them, “or people will go, where they can get roots, and trees,\r\nand everything, all together.” In winter, or in early spring, the\r\nstreet-seller goes a round now and then, with evergreens and shrubs\r\nalone, and the trade is then less distasteful to him. The trees and\r\nshrubs are displayed, when the market-space allows, on a sort of\r\nstand near the flower-stand; sometimes they are placed on the ground,\r\nalong-side the flower-stand, but only when no better display can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe trees and shrubs sold by the costers are mezereons, rhododendrons,\r\nsavine, laurustinus, acacias (of the smaller genera, some being\r\nhighly aromatic when in flower), myrtles, guelder-roses (when small),\r\nprivet, genistas, broom, furze (when small), the cheaper heaths,\r\nsyringas (small), lilacs (almost always young and for transplanting),\r\nsouthernwood (when large), box (large) dwarf laurels, variegated\r\nlaurels (called a _cuber_ by the street-people), and young fir-trees,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe prices of trees vary far more than flower-roots, because they are\r\ndependent upon _size_ for value. “Why,” said one man, “I’ve bought\r\nroddies, as I calls them (rhododendrons), at 4_s._ a dozen, but they\r\nwas scrubby things, and I’ve bought them at 14_s._ 6_d._ I once gave\r\n5_s._ for two trees of them, which I had ordered, and there was a rare\r\ngrumbling about the price, though I only charged 7_s._ 6_d._ for the\r\ntwo, which was 1_s._ 3_d._ a piece for carriage, and hard earned too,\r\nto carry them near five miles in my cart, almost on purpose, but I\r\nthought I was pleasing a good customer. Then there’s myrtles, why I can\r\nget them at 5_d._ a piece, and at 5_s._, and a deal more if wanted.\r\nYou can have myrtles that a hat might be very big for them to grow in,\r\nand myrtles that will fill a great window in a fine house. I’ve bought\r\ncommon heaths at 1_s._ 3_d._ a dozen.”\r\n\r\nThe coster ordinarily confines himself to the cheaper sorts of plants,\r\nand rarely meddles with such things as acacias, mezereons, savines,\r\nsyringas, lilacs, or even myrtles, and with none of these things\r\nunless cheap. “Trees, real trees,” I was told, “are often as cheap as\r\nanything. Them young firs there was 4_s._ 6_d._ a dozen, and a man at\r\nmarket can buy four or six of them if he don’t want a dozen.”\r\n\r\nThe customers for trees and shrubs are generally those who inhabit\r\nthe larger sort of houses, where there is room in the hall or the\r\nwindows for display; or where there is a garden capacious enough for\r\nthe implantation of the shrubs. Three-fourths of the trees are sold\r\non a round, and when purchased at a stall the costermonger generally\r\nundertakes to deliver them at the purchaser’s residence, if not too\r\nmuch out of his way, in his regular rounds. Or he may diverge, and make\r\na round on speculation, purposely. There is as much bartering trees\r\nfor old clothes, as for roots, and as many, or more, complaints of the\r\nhard bargainings of ladies: “I’d rather sell polyanthuses at a farthing\r\na piece profit to poor women, if I could get no more,” said one man,\r\n“than I’d work among them screws that’s so fine in grand caps and so\r\ncivil. They’d skin a flea for his hide and tallow.”\r\n\r\nThe number of trees and shrubs sold annually, in the streets, are,\r\nas near as I can ascertain, as follows--I have added to the quantity\r\npurchased by the street-sellers, at the metropolitan markets, the\r\namount bought by them at the principal nursery-gardens in the environs\r\nof London:\r\n\r\n  Firs                9,576 roots\r\n  Laurels             1,152   „\r\n  Myrtles            23,040   „\r\n  Rhododendrons       2,160   „\r\n  Lilacs              2,304   „\r\n  Box                 2,880   „\r\n  Heaths             21,888   „\r\n  Broom               2,880   „\r\n  Furze               6,912   „\r\n  Laurustinus         6,480   „\r\n  Southernwood       25,920   „\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON FLOWER GIRLS.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to arrive at any accurate estimate of the number of\r\nflower-sellers in the streets of London. The cause of the difficulty\r\nlies in the fact that none can be said to devote themselves entirely\r\nto the sale of flowers in the street, for the flower-sellers, when\r\noranges are cheap and good, find their sale of the fruit more certain\r\nand profitable than that of flowers, and resort to it accordingly.\r\nAnother reason is, that a poor costermonger will on a fine summer’s\r\nday send out his children to sell flowers, while on other days they\r\nmay be selling water-cresses or, perhaps, onions. Sunday is the best\r\nday for flower-selling, and one experienced man computed, that in the\r\nheight and pride of the summer 400 children were selling flowers, on\r\nthe Sundays, in the streets. Another man thought that number too low\r\nan estimate, and contended that it was nearer 800. I found more of the\r\nopinion of my last mentioned informant than of the other, but I myself\r\nam disposed to think the smaller number nearer the truth. On week days\r\nit is computed there are about half the number of flower-sellers that\r\nthere are on the Sundays. The trade is almost entirely in the hands of\r\nchildren, the girls outnumbering the boys by more than eight to one.\r\nThe ages of the girls vary from six to twenty; few of the boys are\r\nolder than twelve, and most of them are under ten.\r\n\r\nOf flower-girls there are two classes. Some girls, and they are\r\ncertainly the smaller class of the two, avail themselves of the sale of\r\nflowers in the streets for immoral purposes, or rather, they seek to\r\neke out the small gains of their trade by such practises. They frequent\r\nthe great thoroughfares, and offer their bouquets to gentlemen, whom on\r\nan evening they pursue for a hundred yards or two in such places as the\r\nStrand, mixing up a leer with their whine for custom or for charity.\r\nTheir ages are from fourteen to nineteen or twenty, and sometimes they\r\nremain out offering their flowers--or dried lavender when no fresh\r\nflowers are to be had--until late at night. They do not care, to make\r\ntheir appearance in the streets until towards evening, and though they\r\nsolicit the custom of ladies, they rarely follow or importune them. Of\r\nthis class I shall treat more fully under another head.\r\n\r\nThe other class of flower-girls is composed of the girls who, wholly\r\nor partially, depend upon the sale of flowers for their own support\r\nor as an assistance to their parents. Some of them are the children\r\nof street-sellers, some are orphans, and some are the daughters of\r\nmechanics who are out of employment, and who prefer any course rather\r\nthan an application to the parish. These girls offer their flowers\r\nin the principal streets at the West End, and resort greatly to the\r\nsuburbs; there are a few, also, in the business thoroughfares. They\r\nwalk up and down in front of the houses, offering their flowers to any\r\none looking out of the windows, or they stand at any likely place. They\r\nare generally very persevering, more especially the younger children,\r\nwho will run along, barefooted, with their “Please, gentleman, do buy\r\nmy flowers. Poor little girl!”--“Please, kind lady, buy my violets. O,\r\ndo! please! Poor little girl! Do buy a bunch, please, kind lady!”\r\n\r\nThe statement I give, “of two orphan flower-sellers” furnishes another\r\nproof, in addition to the many I have already given, of the heroic\r\nstruggles of the poor, and of the truth of the saying, “What would the\r\npoor do without the poor?”\r\n\r\nThe better class of flower-girls reside in Lisson-grove, in the streets\r\noff Drury-lane, in St. Giles’s, and in other parts inhabited by the\r\nvery poor. Some of them live in lodging-houses, the stench and squalor\r\nof which are in remarkable contrast to the beauty and fragrance of the\r\nflowers they sometimes have to carry thither with them unsold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF TWO ORPHAN FLOWER GIRLS.\r\n\r\nOf these girls the elder was fifteen and the younger eleven. Both\r\nwere clad in old, but not torn, dark print frocks, hanging so\r\nclosely, and yet so loosely, about them as to show the deficiency of\r\nunder-clothing; they wore old broken black chip bonnets. The older\r\nsister (or rather half-sister) had a pair of old worn-out shoes on her\r\nfeet, the younger was barefoot, but trotted along, in a gait at once\r\nquick and feeble--as if the soles of her little feet were impervious,\r\nlike horn, to the roughness of the road. The elder girl has a modest\r\nexpression of countenance, with no pretensions to prettiness except in\r\nhaving tolerably good eyes. Her complexion was somewhat muddy, and her\r\nfeatures somewhat pinched. The younger child had a round, chubby, and\r\neven rosy face, and quite a healthful look. Her portrait is here given.\r\n\r\nThey lived in one of the streets near Drury-lane. They were inmates\r\nof a house, not let out as a lodging-house, in separate beds, but\r\nin rooms, and inhabited by street-sellers and street-labourers.\r\nThe room they occupied was large, and one dim candle lighted it so\r\ninsufficiently that it seemed to exaggerate the dimensions. The walls\r\nwere bare and discoloured with damp. The furniture consisted of a\r\ncrazy table and a few chairs, and in the centre of the room was an old\r\nfour-post bedstead of the larger size. This bed was occupied nightly\r\nby the two sisters and their brother, a lad just turned thirteen.\r\nIn a sort of recess in a corner of the room was the decency of an\r\nold curtain--or something equivalent, for I could hardly see in the\r\ndimness--and behind this was, I presume, the bed of the married couple.\r\nThe three children paid 2_s._ a week for the room, the tenant an\r\nIrishman out of work paying 2_s._ 9_d._, but the furniture was his,\r\nand his wife aided the children in their trifle of washing, mended\r\ntheir clothes, where such a thing was possible, and such like. The\r\nhusband was absent at the time of my visit, but the wife seemed of a\r\nbetter stamp, judging by her appearance, and by her refraining from any\r\ndirect, or even indirect, way of begging, as well as from the “Glory be\r\nto Gods!” “the heavens be your honour’s bed!” or “it’s the thruth I’m\r\ntelling of you sir,” that I so frequently meet with on similar visits.\r\n\r\nThe elder girl said, in an English accent, not at all garrulously, but\r\nmerely in answer to my questions: “I sell flowers, sir; we live almost\r\non flowers when they are to be got. I sell, and so does my sister,\r\nall kinds, but it’s very little use offering any that’s not sweet. I\r\nthink it’s the sweetness as sells them. I sell primroses, when they’re\r\nin, and violets, and wall-flowers, and stocks, and roses of different\r\nsorts, and pinks, and carnations, and mixed flowers, and lilies of\r\nthe valley, and green lavender, and mignonette (but that I do very\r\nseldom), and violets again at this time of the year, for we get them\r\nboth in spring and winter.” [They are forced in hot-houses for winter\r\nsale, I may remark.] “The best sale of all is, I think, moss-roses,\r\nyoung moss-roses. We do best of all on them. Primroses are good, for\r\npeople say: ‘Well, here’s spring again to a certainty.’ Gentlemen are\r\nour best customers. I’ve heard that they buy flowers to give to the\r\nladies. Ladies have sometimes said: ‘A penny, my poor girl, here’s\r\nthree-halfpence for the bunch.’ Or they’ve given me the price of two\r\nbunches for one; so have gentlemen. I never had a rude word said to me\r\nby a gentleman in my life. No, sir, neither lady nor gentleman ever\r\ngave me 6_d._ for a bunch of flowers. I never had a sixpence given\r\nto me in my life--never. I never go among boys, I know nobody but my\r\nbrother. My father was a tradesman in Mitchelstown, in the County\r\nCork. I don’t know what sort of a tradesman he was. I never saw him.\r\nHe was a tradesman I’ve been told. I was born in London. Mother was a\r\nchairwoman, and lived very well. None of us ever saw a father.” [It\r\nwas evident that they were illegitimate children, but the landlady had\r\nnever seen the mother, and could give me no information.] “We don’t\r\nknow anything about our fathers. We were all ‘mother’s children.’\r\nMother died seven years ago last Guy Faux day. I’ve got myself, and my\r\nbrother and sister a bit of bread ever since, and never had any help\r\nbut from the neighbours. I never troubled the parish. O, yes, sir, the\r\nneighbours is all poor people, very poor, some of them. We’ve lived\r\nwith her” (indicating her landlady by a gesture) “the two years, and\r\noff and on before that. I can’t say how long.” “Well, I don’t know\r\nexactly,” said the landlady, “but I’ve had them with me almost all\r\nthe time, for four years, as near as I can recollect; perhaps more.\r\nI’ve moved three times, and they always followed me.” In answer to my\r\ninquiries the landlady assured me that these two poor girls, were never\r\nout of doors all the time she had known them after six at night. “We’ve\r\nalways good health. We can all read.” [Here the three somewhat insisted\r\nupon proving to me their proficiency in reading, and having produced\r\na Roman Catholic book, the “Garden of Heaven,” they read very well.]\r\n“I put myself,” continued the girl, “and I put my brother and sister\r\nto a Roman Catholic school--and to Ragged schools--but _I_ could read\r\nbefore mother died. My brother can write, and I pray to God that he’ll\r\ndo well with it. I buy my flowers at Covent Garden; sometimes, but\r\nvery seldom, at Farringdon. I pay 1_s._ for a dozen bunches, whatever\r\nflowers are in. Out of every two bunches I can make three, at 1_d._ a\r\npiece. Sometimes one or two over in the dozen, but not so often as I\r\nwould like. We make the bunches up ourselves. We get the rush to tie\r\nthem with for nothing. We put their own leaves round these violets (she\r\nproduced a bunch). The paper for a dozen costs a penny; sometimes only\r\na halfpenny. The two of us doesn’t make less than 6_d._ a day, unless\r\nit’s very ill luck. But religion teaches us that God will support us,\r\nand if we make less we say nothing. We do better on oranges in March or\r\nApril, I think it is, than on flowers. Oranges keep better than flowers\r\nyou see, sir. We make 1_s._ a day, and 9_d._ a day, on oranges, the two\r\nof us. I wish they was in all the year. I generally go St. John’s-wood\r\nway, and Hampstead and Highgate way with my flowers. I can get them\r\nnearly all the year, but oranges is better liked than flowers, I think.\r\nI always keep 1_s._ stock-money, if I can. If it’s bad weather, so bad\r\nthat we can’t sell flowers at all, and so if we’ve had to spend our\r\nstock-money for a bit of bread, _she_ (the landlady) lends us 1_s._, if\r\nshe has one, or she borrows one of a neighbour, if she hasn’t, or if\r\nthe neighbours hasn’t it, she borrows it at a dolly-shop” (the illegal\r\npawn-shop). “There’s 2_d._ a week to pay for 1_s._ at a dolly, and\r\nperhaps an old rug left for it; if it’s very hard weather, the rug must\r\nbe taken at night time, or we are starved with the cold. It sometimes\r\nhas to be put into the dolly again next morning, and then there’s 2_d._\r\nto pay for it for the day. We’ve had a frock in for 6_d._, and that’s\r\na penny a week, and the same for a day. We never pawned anything; we\r\nhave nothing they would take in at the pawnshop. We live on bread and\r\ntea, and sometimes a fresh herring of a night. Sometimes we don’t eat a\r\nbit all day when we’re out; sometimes we take a bit of bread with us,\r\nor buy a bit. My sister can’t eat taturs; they sicken her. I don’t know\r\nwhat emigrating means.” [I informed her and she continued]: “No, sir,\r\nI wouldn’t like to emigrate and leave brother and sister. If they went\r\nwith me I don’t think I should like it, not among strangers. I think\r\nour living costs us 2_s._ a week for the two of us; the rest goes in\r\nrent. That’s all we make.”\r\n\r\nThe brother earned from 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ a week, with an occasional\r\nmeal, as a costermonger’s boy. Neither of them ever missed mass on a\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF A FLOWER GIRL.\r\n\r\nSome of these girls are, as I have stated, of an immoral character, and\r\nsome of them are sent out by their parents to make out a livelihood\r\nby prostitution. One of this class, whom I saw, had come out of prison\r\na short time previously. She was not nineteen, and had been sentenced\r\nabout a twelvemonth before to three months’ imprisonment with hard\r\nlabour, “for heaving her shoe,” as she said, “at the Lord Mayor, to get\r\na comfortable lodging, for she was tired of being about the streets.”\r\nAfter this she was locked up for breaking the lamps in the street.\r\nShe alleged that her motive for this was a belief that by committing\r\nsome such act she might be able to get into an asylum for females. She\r\nwas sent out into the streets by her father and mother, at the age of\r\nnine, to sell flowers. Her father used to supply her with the money to\r\nbuy the flowers, and she used to take the proceeds of the day’s work\r\nhome to her parents. She used to be out frequently till past midnight,\r\nand seldom or never got home before nine. She associated only with\r\nflower-girls of loose character. The result may be imagined. She could\r\nnot state positively that her parents were aware of the manner in which\r\nshe got the money she took home to them. She supposes that they must\r\nhave imagined what her practices were. He used to give her no supper\r\nif she “didn’t bring home a good bit of money.” Her father and mother\r\ndid little or no work all this while. They lived on what she brought\r\nhome. At thirteen years old she was sent to prison (she stated) “for\r\nselling combs in the street” (it was winter, and there were no flowers\r\nto be had). She was incarcerated fourteen days, and when liberated\r\nshe returned to her former practices. The very night that she came\r\nhome from gaol her father sent her out into the streets again. She\r\ncontinued in this state, her father and mother living upon her, until\r\nabout twelve months before I received this account from her, when her\r\nfather turned her out of his house, because she didn’t bring home money\r\nenough. She then went into Kent, hop-picking, and there fell in with a\r\nbeggar, who accosted her while she was sitting under a tree. He said,\r\n“You have got a very bad pair of shoes on; come with me, and you shall\r\nhave some better ones.” She consented, and walked with him into the\r\nvillage close by, where they stood out in the middle of the streets,\r\nand the man began addressing the people, “My kind good Christians, me\r\nand my poor wife here is ashamed to appear before you in the state we\r\nare in.” She remained with this person all the winter, and travelled\r\nwith him through the country, begging. He was a beggar by trade. In the\r\nspring she returned to the flower-selling, but scarcely got any money\r\neither by that or other means. At last she grew desperate, and wanted\r\nto get back to prison. She broke the lamps outside the Mansion-house,\r\nand was sentenced to fourteen days’ imprisonment. She had been out of\r\nprison nearly three weeks when I saw her, and was in training to go\r\ninto an asylum. She was sick and tired, she said, of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF LAVENDER.\r\n\r\nThe sale of green lavender in the streets is carried on by the same\r\nclass as the sale of flowers, and is, as often as flowers, used for\r\nimmoral purposes, when an evening or night sale is carried on.\r\n\r\nThe lavender is sold at the markets in bundles, each containing a dozen\r\nbranches. It is sold principally to ladies in the suburbs, who purchase\r\nit to deposit in drawers and wardrobes; the odour communicated to linen\r\nfrom lavender being, perhaps, more agreeable and more communicable\r\nthan that from any other flower. Nearly a tenth of the market sale may\r\nbe disposed of in this way. Some costers sell it cheap to recommend\r\nthemselves to ladies who are customers, that they may have the better\r\nchance for a continuance of those ladies’ custom.\r\n\r\nThe number of lavender-sellers can hardly be given as distinct from\r\nthat of flower-sellers, because any flower-girl will sell lavender,\r\n“when it is in season.” The season continues from the beginning of\r\nJuly to the end of September. In the winter months, generally after\r\nday-fall, dried lavender is offered for sale; it is bought at the\r\nherb-shops. There is, however, an addition to the number of the\r\nflower-girls of a few old women, perhaps from twenty to thirty, who\r\nvary their street-selling avocations by going from door to door in the\r\nsuburbs with lavender for sale, but do not stand to offer it in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe street-seller’s profit on lavender is now somewhat more than cent.\r\nper cent., as the bundle, costing 2-1/2_d._, brings when tied up in\r\nsprigs, at least, 6_d._ The profit, I am told, was, six or seven years\r\nago, 200 per cent.; “but people will have better penn’orths now.” I\r\nwas informed, by a person long familiar with the trade in flowers,\r\nthat, from twenty to twenty-five years ago, the sale was the best. It\r\nwas a fashionable amusement for ladies to tie the sprigs of lavender\r\ntogether, compressing the stems very tightly with narrow ribbon of any\r\nfavourite colour, the heads being less tightly bound, or remaining\r\nunbound; the largest stems were in demand for this work. The lavender\r\nbundle, when its manufacture was complete, was placed in drawers, or\r\nbehind books in the shelves of a glazed book-case, so that a most\r\npleasant atmosphere was diffused when the book-case was opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUT FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nI now give the quantity of cut flowers sold in the streets. The returns\r\nhave been derived from nursery-men and market-salesmen. It will be\r\nseen how fully these returns corroborate the statement of the poor\r\nflower-girl--(p. 135)--“it’s very little use offering anything that’s\r\nnot sweet.”\r\n\r\nI may remark, too, that at the present period, from “the mildness of\r\nthe season,” wallflowers, primroses, violets, and polyanthuses are\r\nalmost as abundant as in spring sunshine.\r\n\r\n  Violets                            65,280 bunches.\r\n  Wallflowers                       115,200    „\r\n  Lavender                          296,640    „\r\n  Pinks and Carnations               63,360    „\r\n  Moss Roses                        172,800    „\r\n  China ditto                       172,800    „\r\n  Mignonette                         86,400    „\r\n  Lilies of the Valley                1,632    „\r\n  Stocks                             20,448    „\r\n                                    -------\r\n  Cut flowers sold yearly in the }\r\n    streets                      }  994,560    „\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF FLOWERS IN POTS, ROOTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe “flower-root sellers”--for I heard them so called to distinguish\r\nthem from the sellers of “cut flowers”--are among the best-mannered and\r\nthe best-dressed of all the street-sellers I have met with, but that\r\nonly as regards a portion of them. Their superiority in this respect\r\nmay perhaps be in some measure attributable to their dealing with a\r\nbetter class of customers--with persons who, whether poor or rich,\r\nexercise healthful tastes.\r\n\r\nI may mention, that I found the street-sellers of “roots”--always\r\nmeaning thereby flower-roots in bloom--more attached to their trade\r\nthan others of their class.\r\n\r\nThe roots, sold in the streets, are bought in the markets and at the\r\nnursery-gardens; but about three-fourths of those required by the\r\nbetter class of street-dealers are bought at the gardens, as are “cut\r\nflowers” occasionally. Hackney is the suburb most resorted to by the\r\nroot-sellers. The best “pitches” for the sale of roots in the street\r\nare situated in the New-road, the City-road, the Hampstead-road, the\r\nEdgeware-road, and places of similar character, where there is a\r\nconstant stream of passers along, who are not too much immersed in\r\nbusiness. Above three-fourths of the sale is effected by itinerant\r\ncostermongers. For this there is one manifest reason: a flower-pot,\r\nwith the delicate petals of its full-blown moss-rose, perhaps, suffers\r\neven from the trifling concussion in the journey of an omnibus, for\r\ninstance. To carry a heavy flower-pot, even any short distance, cannot\r\nbe expected, and to take a cab for its conveyance adds greatly to the\r\nexpense. Hence, flower-roots are generally purchased at the door of the\r\nbuyer.\r\n\r\nFor the flowers of commoner or easier culture, the root-seller receives\r\nfrom 1_d._ to 3_d._ These are primroses, polyanthuses, cowslips (but\r\nin small quantities comparatively), daisies (single and double,--and\r\nsingle or wild, daisies were coming to be more asked for, each 1_d._),\r\nsmall early wallflowers, candy-tufts, southernwood (called “lad’s love”\r\nor “old man” by some), and daffodils, (but daffodils were sometimes\r\ndearer than 3_d._). The plants that may be said to struggle against\r\nfrost and snow in a hard season, such as the snowdrop, the crocus, and\r\nthe mezereon, are rarely sold by the costers; “They come too soon,” I\r\nwas told. The primroses, and the other plants I have enumerated, are\r\nsold, for the most part, not in pots, but with soil attached to the\r\nroots, so that they may be planted in a garden (as they most frequently\r\nare) or in a pot.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of May, in an early season, and in the two following\r\nmonths, the root-trade is at its height. Many of the stalls and\r\nbarrows are then exceedingly beautiful, the barrow often resembling a\r\nmoving garden. The stall-keepers have sometimes their flowers placed\r\non a series of shelves, one above another, so as to present a small\r\namphitheatre of beautiful and diversified hues; the purest white, as\r\nin the lily of the valley, to the deepest crimson, as in the fuschia;\r\nthe bright or rust-blotted yellow of the wallflower, to the many hues\r\nof the stock. Then there are the pinks and carnations, double and\r\nsingle, with the rich-coloured and heavily scented “clove-pinks;”\r\nroses, mignonette, the velvetty pansies (or heart’s-ease), the white\r\nand orange lilies, calceolarias, balsams (a flower going out of\r\nfashion), geraniums (flowers coming again into fashion), musk-plants,\r\nLondon pride (and other saxifrages; the species known, oddly enough, as\r\nLondon pride being a native of wild and mountainous districts, such as\r\nbotanists call “Alpine habitats,”) and the many coloured lupins. Later\r\nagain come the China-asters, the African marigolds, the dahlias, the\r\npoppies, and the common and very aromatic marigold. Later still there\r\nare the Michaelmas daisies--the growth of the “All-Hallow’n summer,” to\r\nwhich Falstaff was compared.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of “roots” in which the street-sellers, on account of\r\ntheir general dearness, deal so sparingly, that I cannot class them as\r\na part of the business. Among these are anemones, hyacinths, tulips,\r\nranunculuses, and the orchidaceous tribe. Neither do the street people\r\nmeddle, unless very exceptionally, with the taller and statelier\r\nplants, such as foxgloves, hollyoaks, and sunflowers; these are too\r\ndifficult of carriage for their purpose. Nor do they sell, unless again\r\nas an exception, such flowers as require support--the convolvolus and\r\nthe sweet-pea, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe plants I have specified vary in price. Geraniums are sold at from\r\n3_d._ to 5_s._; pinks at from 3_d._ for the common pink, to 2_s._ for\r\nthe best single clove, and 4_s._ for the best double; stocks, as they\r\nare small and single, to their being large and double, from 3_d._ (and\r\nsometimes less) to 2_s._; dahlias from 6_d._ to 5_s._; fuschias, from\r\n6_d._ to 4_s._; rose-bushes from 3_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._, and sometimes,\r\nbut not often, much higher; musk-plants, London pride, lupins, &c., are\r\n1_d._ and 2_d._, pots generally included.\r\n\r\nTo carry on his business efficiently, the root-seller mostly keeps a\r\npony and a cart, to convey his purchases from the garden to his stall\r\nor his barrow, and he must have a sheltered and cool shed in which to\r\ndeposit the flowers which are to be kept over-night for the morrow’s\r\nbusiness. “It’s a great bother, sir,” said a root-seller, “a man having\r\nto provide a shed for his roots. It wouldn’t do at all to have them\r\nin the same room as we sleep in--they’d droop. I have a beautiful big\r\nshed, and a snug stall for a donkey in a corner of it; but he won’t\r\nbear tying up--he’ll fight against tying all night, and if he was\r\nloose, why in course he’d eat the flowers I put in the shed. The price\r\nis nothing to him; he’d eat the Queen’s camellias, if he could get at\r\nthem, if they cost a pound a-piece. So I have a deal of trouble, for I\r\nmust block him up somehow; but he’s a first-rate ass.” To carry on a\r\nconsiderable business, the services of a man and his wife are generally\r\nrequired, as well as those of a boy.\r\n\r\nThe purchases wholesale are generally by the dozen roots, all ready\r\nfor sale in pots. Mignonette, however, is grown in boxes, and sold\r\nby the box at from 5_s._ to 20_s._, according to the size, &c. The\r\ncostermonger buys, for the large sale to the poor, at a rate which\r\nbrings the mignonette roots into his possession at something less,\r\nperhaps, than a halfpenny each. He then purchases a gross of small\r\ncommon pots, costing him 1-1/2_d._ a dozen, and has to transfer the\r\nroots and soil to the pots, and then offer them for sale. The profit\r\nthus is about 4_s._ per hundred, but with the drawback of considerable\r\nlabour and some cost in the conveyance of the boxes. The same method is\r\nsometimes pursued with young stocks.\r\n\r\nThe cheapness of pots, I may mention incidentally, and the more\r\nfrequent sale of roots in them, has almost entirely swept away the\r\nfragment of a pitcher and “the spoutless tea-pot,” which Cowper\r\nmentions as containing the poor man’s flowers, that testified an\r\ninextinguishable love of rural objects, even in the heart of a city.\r\nThere are a few such things, however, to be seen still.\r\n\r\nOf root-sellers there are, for six months of the year, about 500 in\r\nLondon. Of these, one-fifth devote themselves principally, but none\r\nentirely, to the sale of roots; two-fifths sell roots regularly, but\r\nonly as a portion, and not a larger portion of their business; and the\r\nremaining two-fifths are casual dealers in roots, buying them--almost\r\nalways in the markets--whenever a bargain offers. Seven-eighths of\r\nthe root-sellers are, I am informed, regular costers, occasionally a\r\ngardener’s assistant has taken to the street trade in flowers, “but I\r\nfancy, sir,” said an experienced man to me, “they’ve very seldom done\r\nany good at it. They’re always _gardening_ at their roots, trimming\r\nthem, and such like, and they overdo it. They’re too careful of their\r\nplants; people like to trim them theirselves.”\r\n\r\n“I did well on fuschias last season,” said one of my informants;\r\n“I sold them from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ The ‘Globes’ went off well.\r\nGeraniums was very fair. The ‘Fairy Queens’ of them sold faster than\r\nany, I think. It’s the ladies out of town a little way, and a few in\r\ntown, that buy them, and buy the fuschias too. They require a good\r\nwindow. The ‘Jenny Linds’--they was geraniums and other plants--didn’t\r\nsell so well as the Fairy Queens, though they was cheaper. Good\r\ncloves (pinks) sell to the better sort of houses; so do carnations.\r\nMignonette’s everybody’s money. Dahlias didn’t go off so well. I\r\nhad very tidy dahlias at 6_d._ and 1_s._, and some 1_s._ 6_d._ I do\r\na goodish bit in giving flowers for old clothes. I very seldom do\r\nit, but to ladies. I deal mostly with them for their husbands’ old\r\nhats, or boots, or shoes; yes, sir, and their trowsers and waistcoats\r\nsometimes--very seldom their coats--and ladies boots and shoes too.\r\nThere’s one pleasant old lady, and her two daughters, they’ll talk\r\nme over any day. I very seldom indeed trade for ladies’ clothes. I\r\nhave, though. Mostly for something in the shawl way, or wraps of some\r\nkind. Why, that lady I was telling you of and her daughters, got me to\r\ntake togs that didn’t bring the prime cost of my roots and expenses.\r\nThey called them by such fine names, that I was had. Then they was so\r\npolite; ‘O, my good man,’ says one of the young daughters, ‘I must have\r\nthis geranium in ’change.’ It was a most big and beautiful Fairy Queen,\r\nwell worth 4_s._ The tog--I didn’t know what they called it--a sort\r\nof cloak, fetched short of half-a-crown, and that just with cheaper\r\ntogs. Some days, if it’s very hot, and the stall business isn’t good in\r\n_very_ hot weather, my wife goes a round with me, and does considerable\r\nin swopping with ladies. They can’t do her as they can me. The same\r\non wet days, if it’s not very wet, when I has my roots covered in the\r\ncart. Ladies is mostly at home such times, and perhaps they’re dull,\r\nand likes to go to work at a bargaining. My wife manages them. In\r\ngood weeks, I can clear 3_l._ in my trade; the two of us can, anyhow.\r\nBut then there’s bad weather, and there’s sometimes roots spoiled if\r\nthey’re not cheap, and don’t go off--but I’ll sell one that cost me\r\n1_s._ for 2_d._ to get rid of it; and there’s always the expenses to\r\nmeet, and the pony to keep, and everything that way. No, sir, I don’t\r\nmake 2_l._ a week for the five months--its nearer five than six--the\r\nseason lasts; perhaps something near it. The rest of the year I sell\r\nfruit, or anything, and may clear 10_s._ or 15_s._ a week, but, some\r\nweeks, next to nothing, and the expenses all going on.\r\n\r\n“Why, no, sir; I can’t say that times is what they was. Where I made\r\n4_l._ on my roots five or six years back, I make only 3_l._ now. But\r\nit’s no use complaining; there’s lots worse off than I am--lots. I’ve\r\ngiven pennies and twopences to plenty that’s seen better days in the\r\nstreets; it might be their own fault. It is so mostly, but perhaps only\r\npartly. I keep a connection together as well as I can.

As my informant had a superior trade, his business is not to\r\nbe taken as an average; but, reckoning that he averages six dozen a\r\nday for 20 weeks--he said 26--it shows that one man alone sells 8,640\r\nflowers in pots in the season. The principal sellers carry on about\r\nthe same extent of business.\r\n\r\nAccording to similar returns, the number of the several kinds of\r\nflowers in pots and flower roots sold annually in the London streets,\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS IN POTS.\r\n\r\n  Moss-roses                     38,880\r\n  China-roses                    38,880\r\n  Fuschias                       38,800\r\n  Geraniums                      12,800\r\n                                -------\r\n  Total number of flowers in }\r\n    pots sold in the streets }  129,360\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWER-ROOTS.\r\n\r\n  Primroses                         24,000\r\n  Polyanthuses                      34,560\r\n  Cowslips                          28,800\r\n  Daisies                           33,600\r\n  Wallflowers                       46,080\r\n  Candytufts                        28,800\r\n  Daffodils                         28,800\r\n  Violets                           38,400\r\n  Mignonette                        30,384\r\n  Stocks                            23,040\r\n  Pinks and Carnations              19,200\r\n  Lilies of the Valley               3,456\r\n  Pansies                           12,960\r\n  Lilies                               660\r\n  Tulips                               852\r\n  Balsams                            7,704\r\n  Calceolarias                       3,180\r\n  Musk Plants                      253,440\r\n  London Pride                      11,520\r\n  Lupins                            25,596\r\n  China-asters                       9,156\r\n  Marigolds                         63,360\r\n  Dahlias                              852\r\n  Heliotrope                        13,356\r\n  Poppies                            1,920\r\n  Michaelmas Daisies                 6,912\r\n                                   -------\r\n  Total number of flower-roots }\r\n    sold in the streets        }   750,588\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF SEEDS.\r\n\r\nThe street sale of seeds, I am informed, is smaller than it was thirty,\r\nor even twenty years back. One reason assigned for this falling off\r\nis the superior cheapness of “flowers in pots.” At one time, I was\r\ninformed, the poorer classes who were fond of flowers liked to “grow\r\ntheir own mignonette.” I told one of my informants that I had been\r\nassured by a trustworthy man, that in one day he had sold 600 penny\r\npots of mignonette: “Not a bit of doubt of it, sir,” was the answer,\r\n“not a doubt about it; I’ve heard of more than that sold in a day by a\r\nman who set on three hands to help him; and that’s just where it is.\r\nWhen a poor woman, or poor man either--but its mostly the women--can\r\nbuy a mignonette pot, all blooming and smelling for 1_d._, why she\r\nwon’t bother to buy seeds and set them in a box or a pot and wait for\r\nthem to come into full blow. Selling seeds in the streets can’t be\r\ndone so well now, sir. Anyhow it ain’t done as it was, as I’ve often\r\nheard old folk say.” The reason assigned for this is that cottages in\r\nmany parts--such places as Lisson-grove, Islington, Hoxton, Hackney,\r\nor Stepney--where the inhabitants formerly cultivated flowers in\r\ntheir little gardens, are now let out in single apartments, and the\r\ngardens--or yards as they mostly are now--were used merely to hang\r\nclothes in. The only green thing which remained in some of these\r\ngardens, I was told, was horse-radish, a root which it is difficult\r\nto extirpate: “And it’s just the sort of thing,” said one man, “that\r\npoor people hasn’t no great call for, because they, you see, a’n’t not\r\noverdone with joints of roast beef, nor rump steaks.” In the suburbs\r\nwhere the small gardens are planted with flowers, the cultivators\r\nrarely buy seeds of the street-sellers, whose stands are mostly at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nNone of the street seed-vendors confine themselves to the sale. One\r\nman, whom I saw, told me that last spring he was penniless, after\r\nsickness, and a nurseryman, whom he knew, trusted him 5_s._ worth\r\nof seeds, which he continued to sell, trading in nothing else, for\r\nthree or four weeks, until he was able to buy some flowers in pots.\r\nThough the profit is cent. per cent. on most kinds, 1_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nday is accounted “good earnings, on seeds.” On wet days there is no\r\nsale, and, indeed, the seeds cannot be exposed in the streets. My\r\ninformant computed that he cleared 5_s._ a week. His customers were\r\nprincipally poor women, who liked to sow mignonette in boxes, or in\r\na garden-border, “if it had ever such a little bit of sun,” and who\r\nresided, he believed, in small, quiet streets, branching off from the\r\nthoroughfares. Of flower-seeds, the street-sellers dispose most largely\r\nof mignonette, nasturtium, and the various stocks; and of herbs, the\r\nmost is done in parsley. One of my informants, however, “did best in\r\ngrass-seeds,” which people bought, he said, “to mend their grass-plots\r\nwith,” sowing them in any bare place, and throwing soil loosely over\r\nthem. Lupin, larkspur, convolvulus, and Venus’s looking-glass had a\r\nfair sale.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade, in seeds, would be less than it is, were it not that\r\nthe dealers sell it in smaller quantities than the better class of\r\nshop-keepers. The street-traders buy their seeds by the quarter of a\r\npound--or any quantity not considered retail--of the nurserymen, who\r\noften write the names for the costers on the paper in which the seed\r\nhas to be inclosed. Seed that costs 4_d._, the street-seller makes\r\ninto eight penny lots. “Why, yes, sir,” said one man, in answer to\r\nmy inquiry, “people is often afraid that our seeds ain’t honest. If\r\nthey’re not, they’re mixed, or they’re bad, before they come into our\r\nhands. I don’t think any of our chaps does anything with them.”\r\n\r\nFourteen or fifteen years ago, although seeds, generally, were fifteen\r\nto twenty per cent. dearer than they are now, there was twice the\r\ndemand for them. An average price of good mignonette seed, he said,\r\nwas now 1_s._ the quarter of a pound, and it was then 1_s._ 2_d._ to\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ The shilling’s worth, is made, by the street-seller, into\r\ntwenty or twenty-four pennyworths. An average price of parsley, and of\r\nthe cheaper seeds, is less than half that of mignonette. Other seeds,\r\nagain, are not sold to the street-people by the weight, but are made\r\nup in sixpenny and shilling packages. Their extreme lightness prevents\r\ntheir being weighed to a customer. Of this class are, the African\r\nmarigold, the senecios (groundsel), and the china-aster; but of these\r\ncompound flowers, the street-traders sell very few. Poppy-seed used to\r\nbe in great demand among the street-buyers, but it has ceased to be\r\nso. “It’s a fine hardy plant, too, sir,” I was told, “but somehow, for\r\nall its variety in colours, it’s gone out of fashion, for fashion runs\r\nstrong in flowers.”\r\n\r\nOne long-established street-seller, who is well known to supply the\r\nbest seeds, makes for the five weeks or so of the season more than\r\ntwice the weekly average of 5_s._; perhaps 12_s._; but as he is a shop\r\nas well as a stall-keeper, he could not speak very precisely as to\r\nthe proportionate sale in the street or the shop. This man laughed at\r\nthe fondness some of his customers manifested for “fine Latin names.”\r\n“There are some people,” he said, “who will buy antirrhinum, and\r\nartemisia, and digitalis, and wouldn’t hear of snapdragon, or wormwood,\r\nor foxglove, though they’re the identical plants.” The same informant\r\ntold me that the railways in their approaches to the metropolis\r\nhad destroyed many small gardens, and had, he thought, injured his\r\ntrade. It was, also, a common thing now for the greengrocers and\r\ncorn-chandlers to sell garden-seeds, which until these six or eight\r\nyears they did much less extensively.\r\n\r\nLast spring, I was told, there were not more than four persons, in\r\nLondon, selling only seeds. The “root-sellers,” of whom I have treated,\r\ngenerally deal in seeds also, but the demand does not extend beyond\r\nfour or five weeks in the spring, though there was “a straggling trade\r\nthat way” two or three weeks longer. It was computed for me, that there\r\nwere fully one hundred persons selling seeds (with other things) in\r\nthe streets, and that each might average a profit of 5_s._ weekly, for\r\na month; giving 200_l._ expended in seeds, with 100_l._ profit to the\r\ncosters. Seeds are rarely hawked as flowers are.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give as minutely detailed an account of the\r\nstreet-sale of seeds as of flowers, as from their diversity in size,\r\nweight, quantity in a pennyworth, &c., no calculation can be prepared\r\nby weight or measure, only by _value_. Thus, I find it necessary\r\nto depart somewhat from the order hitherto observed. One seedsman,\r\nacquainted with the street-trade from his dealings with the vendors,\r\nwas of opinion that the following list and proportions were as nice an\r\napproximation as could be arrived at. It was found necessary to give\r\nit in proportions of twenty-fifths; but it must be borne in mind that\r\nthe _quantity_ in 3/25ths of parsley, for example, is more than double\r\nthat of 3/25ths of mignonette. I give, in unison, seeds of about equal\r\nsale, whether of the same botanical family or not. Many of the most\r\npopular flowers, such as polyanthuses, daisies, violets, and primroses,\r\nare not raised from seed, except in the nursery gardens:--\r\n\r\n  Seeds.

I\r\nhave appended a table of the quantity of these “branches” sold, nearly\r\n250,000, and of the money expended upon them in the streets. It must\r\nbe borne in mind, to account for this expenditure for a brief season,\r\nthat almost every housekeeper will expend something in “Christmasing;”\r\nfrom 2_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._, and the poor buy a pennyworth, or a\r\nhalfpennyworth each, and they are the coster’s customers. In some\r\nhouses, which are let off in rooms, floors, or suites of apartments,\r\nand not to the poorest class, every room will have the cheery\r\ndecoration of holly, its bright, and as if _glazed_ leaves and red\r\nberries, reflecting the light from fire or candle. “Then, look,” said a\r\ngardener to me, “what’s spent on a Christmasing the churches! Why, now,\r\nproperly to Christmas St. Paul’s, I say _properly_, mind, would take\r\n50_l._ worth at least; aye, more, when I think of it, nearer 100_l._\r\nI hope there’ll be no ‘No Popery’ nonsense against Christmasing this\r\nyear. I’m always sorry when anything of that kind’s afloat, because\r\nit’s frequently a hindrance to business.” This was said three weeks\r\nbefore Christmas. In London there are upwards of 300,000 inhabited\r\nhouses. The whole of the evergreen branches sold number 375,000.\r\n\r\nEven the ordinary-sized inns, I was informed, displayed holly\r\ndecorations, costing from 2_s._ to 10_s._; while in the larger inns,\r\nwhere, perhaps, an assembly-room, a concert-room, or a club-room,\r\nhad to be adorned, along with other apartments, 20_s._ worth of\r\nholly, &c., was a not uncommon outlay. “Well, then, consider,” said\r\nanother informant, “the plum-puddings! Why, at least there’s a hundred\r\nthousand of ’em eaten, in London, through the Christmas and the month\r\nfollowing. That’s nearly one pudding to every twenty of the population,\r\nis it, sir? Well, perhaps, that’s too much. But, then, there’s the\r\ngreat numbers eaten at public dinners and suppers; and there’s more\r\nplum-pudding clubs at the small grocers and public-houses than there\r\nused to be, so, say full a hundred thousand, flinging in any mince-pies\r\nthat may be decorated with evergreens. Well, sir, every plum-pudding\r\nwill have a sprig of holly in him. If it’s bought just for the\r\noccasion, it may cost 1_d._, to be really prime and nicely berried. If\r\nit’s part of a lot, why it won’t cost a halfpenny, so reckon it all at\r\na halfpenny. What does that come to? Above 200_l._ Think of that, then,\r\njust for sprigging puddings!”\r\n\r\nMistletoe, I am informed, is in somewhat less demand than it was,\r\nthough there might be no very perceptible difference. In many houses\r\nholly is now used instead of the true plant, for the ancient ceremonies\r\nand privileges observed “under the mistletoe bough.” The holly is not\r\nhalf the price of the mistletoe, which is one reason; for, though there\r\nis not any great disparity of price, wholesale, the holly, which costs\r\n6_d._ retail, is more than the quantity of mistletoe retailed for\r\n1_s._ The holly-tree may be grown in any hedge, and ivy may be reared\r\nagainst any wall; while the mistletoe is parasitical of the apple-tree,\r\nand, but not to half the extent, of the oak and other trees. It does\r\nnot grow in the northern counties of England. The purchasers of the\r\nmistletoe are, for the most part, the wealthier classes, or, at any\r\nrate, I was told, “those who give parties.” It is bought, too, by the\r\nmale servants in large establishments, and more would be so bought,\r\n“only so few of the great people, of the most fashionable squares and\r\nplaces, keep their Christmas in town.” Half-a-crown is a not uncommon\r\nprice for a handsome mistletoe bough.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers buy about a half of the holly, &c., brought to the\r\nmarkets; it is also sold either direct to those requiring evergreens,\r\nor to green-grocers and fruiterers who have received orders for it from\r\ntheir customers, or who know it will be wanted. A shilling’s worth may\r\nbe bought in the market, the bundles being divided. Mistletoe, the\r\ncosters--those having regular customers in the suburbs--receive orders\r\nfor. “Last December,” said a coster to me, “I remember a servant-girl,\r\nand she weren’t such a girl either, running after me in a regular\r\nflutter, to tell me the family had forgot to order 2_s._ worth of\r\nmistletoe of me, to be brought next day. Oh, yes, sir, if it’s ordered\r\nby, or delivered to, the servant-girls, they generally have a little\r\ngiggling about it. If I’ve said: ‘What are you laughing at?’ they’ll\r\nmostly say: ‘Me! I’m not laughing.’”\r\n\r\nThe costermongers go into the neighbourhood of London to procure the\r\nholly for street-sale. This is chiefly done, I was told, by those who\r\nwere “cracked up,” and some of them laboured at it “days and days.” It\r\nis, however, a very uncertain trade, as they must generally trespass,\r\nand if they are caught trespassing, by the occupier of the land, or\r\nany of his servants, they are seldom “given in charge,” but their\r\nstock of evergreens is not unfrequently taken from them, “and that,\r\nsir, that’s the cuttingest of all.” They do not so freely venture upon\r\nthe gathering of mistletoe, for to procure it they must trespass in\r\norchards, which is somewhat dangerous work, and they are in constant\r\napprehension of traps, spring-guns, and bull-dogs. Six or seven hundred\r\nmen or lads, the lads being the most numerous, are thus employed\r\nfor a week or two before Christmas, and, perhaps, half that number,\r\nirregularly at intervals, for a week or two after it. Some of the lads\r\nare not known as regular coster-lads, but they are _habitués_ of the\r\nstreets in some capacity. To procure as much holly one day, as will\r\nsell for 2_s._ 6_d._ the next, is accounted pretty good work, and 7_s._\r\n6_d._ would be thus realised in six days. But 5_s._ is more frequently\r\nthe return of six days’ labour and sale, though a very few have cleared\r\n10_s._, and one man, “with uncommon luck,” once cleared 20_s._ in six\r\ndays. The distance travelled in a short winter’s day, is sometimes\r\ntwenty miles, and, perhaps, the lad or man has not broken his fast,\r\non some days, until the evening, or even the next morning, for had he\r\npossessed a few pence he would probably have invested it in oranges or\r\nnuts, for street-sale, rather than “go a-gathering Christmas.”\r\n\r\nOne strong-looking lad, of 16 or 17, gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n“It’s hard work, is Christmasing; but, when you have neither money nor\r\nwork, you must do something, and so the holly may come in handy. I live\r\nwith a elder brother; he helps the masons, and as we had neither of us\r\neither work or money, he cut off Tottenham and Edmonton way, and me\r\nthe t’other side of the water, Mortlake way, as well as I know. We’d\r\nboth been used to costering, off and on. I was out, I think, ten days\r\naltogether, and didn’t make 6_s_. in it. I’d been out two Christmases\r\nbefore. O, yes, I’d forgot. I made 6_d._ over the 6_s._, for I had half\r\na pork-pie and a pint of beer, and the landlord took it out in holly.\r\nI meant to have made a quarter of pork do, but I was so hungry--and\r\nso would you, sir, if you’d been out a-Christmasing--that I had the\r\nt’other quarter. It’s 2_d._ a quarter. I did better when I was out\r\nafore, but I forget what I made. It’s often slow work, for you must\r\nwait sometimes ’till no one’s looking, and then you must work away like\r\nanything. I’d nothing but a sharp knife, I borrowed, and some bits\r\nof cord to tie the holly up. You _must_ look out sharp, because, you\r\nsee, sir, a man very likely won’t like his holly-tree to be stripped.\r\nWherever there is a berry, we goes for the berries. They’re poison\r\nberries, I’ve heard. Moonlight nights is the thing, sir, when you knows\r\nwhere you are. I never goes for mizzletoe. I hardly knows it when I\r\nsees it. The first time I was out, a man got me to go for some in a\r\norchard, and told me how to manage; but I cut my lucky in a minute.\r\nSomething came over me like. I felt sickish. But what can a poor fellow\r\ndo? I never lost my Christmas, but a little bit of it once. Two men\r\ntook it from me, and said I ought to thank them for letting me off\r\nwithout a jolly good jacketing, as they was gardeners. I believes they\r\nwas men out a-Christmasing, as I were. It was a dreadful cold time\r\nthat; and I was wet, and hungry,--and thirsty, too, for all I was so\r\nwet,--and I’d to wait a-watching in the wet. I’ve got something better\r\nto do now, and I’ll never go a-Christmasing again, if I can help it.”\r\n\r\nThis lad contrived to get back to his lodging, in town, every\r\nnight, but some of those out Christmasing, stay two or three days\r\nand nights in the country, sleeping in barns, out-houses, carts, or\r\nunder hay-stacks, inclement as the weather may be, when their funds\r\nare insufficient to defray the charge of a bed, or a part of one,\r\nat a country “dossing-crib” (low lodging-house). They resorted, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, to the casual wards of the workhouses, in\r\nCroydon, Greenwich, Reigate, Dartford, &c., when that accommodation was\r\nafforded them, concealing their holly for the night.\r\n\r\nAs in other matters, it may be a surprise to some of my readers to\r\nlearn in what way the evergreens, used on festive occasions in their\r\nhomes, may have been procured.\r\n\r\nThe costermongers who procure their own Christmasing, generally hawk\r\nit. A few sell it by the lot to their more prosperous brethren. What\r\nthe costers purchase in the market, they aim to sell at cent. per cent.\r\n\r\nSupposing that 700 men and lads gathered their own holly, &c., and each\r\nworked for three weeks (not regarding interruptions), and calculating\r\nthat, in the time they cleared even 15_s._ each, it amounts to 525_l._\r\n\r\nSome of the costermongers deck their carts and barrows, in the general\r\nline, with holly at Christmas. Some go out with their carts full of\r\nholly, for sale, and may be accompanied by a fiddler, or by a person\r\nbeating a drum. The cry is, “Holly! Green Holly!”\r\n\r\nOne of my informants alluded incidentally to the decoration of the\r\nchurches, and I may observe that they used to be far more profusely\r\ndecked with Christmas evergreens than at present; so much so, that a\r\nlady correspondent in January, 1712, complained to “Mr. _Spectator_”\r\nthat her church-going was bootless. She was constant at church, to hear\r\ndivine service and make conquests; but the clerk had so overdone the\r\ngreens in the church that, for three weeks, Miss Jenny Simper had not\r\neven seen the young baronet, whom she dressed at for divine worship,\r\nalthough he pursued his devotions only three pews from hers. The aisle\r\nwas a pretty shady walk, and each pew was an arbour. The pulpit was\r\nso clustered with holly and ivy that the congregation, like Moses,\r\nheard the word out of a bush. “Sir Anthony Love’s pew in particular,”\r\nconcludes the indignant Miss Simper, “is so well hedged, that all my\r\nbatteries have no effect. I am obliged to shoot at random among the\r\nboughs without taking any manner of aim. Mr. Spectator, unless you’ll\r\ngive orders for removing these greens, I shall grow a very awkward\r\ncreature at church, and soon have little else to do there but to say\r\nmy prayers.” In a subsequent number, the clerk glorifies himself that\r\nhe had checked the ogling of Miss Simper. He had heard how the Kentish\r\nmen evaded the Conqueror by displaying green boughs before them, and\r\nso he bethought him of a like device against the love-warfare of this\r\ncoquettish lady.\r\n\r\nOf all the “branches” in the markets, the costers buy one-half. This\r\nseason, holly has been cheaper than was ever known previously. In\r\nsome years, its price was double that cited, in some treble, when the\r\nDecember was very frosty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SALE OF MAY, PALM, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the May, the fragrant flower of the hawthorn, a tree\r\nindigenous to this country--Wordsworth mentions one which must have\r\nbeen 800 years old--is carried on by the coster boys (principally), but\r\nonly in a desultory way. The chief supply is brought to London in the\r\ncarts or barrows of the costers returning from a country expedition.\r\nIf the costermonger be accompanied by a lad--as he always is if the\r\nexpedition be of any length--the lad will say to his master, “Bill,\r\nlet’s have some May to take back.” The man will almost always consent,\r\nand often assist in procuring the thickly green branches with their\r\nwhite or rose-tinted, and _freshly_-smelling flowers. The odour of the\r\nhawthorn blossom is peculiar, and some eminent botanist--Dr. Withering\r\nif I remember rightly--says it may be best described as “fresh.” No\r\nflower, perhaps, is blended with more poetical, antiquarian, and\r\nbeautiful associations than the ever-welcome blossom of the may-tree.\r\nOne gardener told me that as the hawthorn was in perfection in June\r\ninstead of May, the name was not proper. But it must be remembered that\r\nthe name of the flower was given during the old style, which carried\r\nour present month of May twelve days into June, and the name would then\r\nbe more appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe May is obtained by the costermongers in the same way as the holly,\r\nby cutting it from the trees in the hedges. It has sometimes to be cut\r\nor broken off stealthily, for persons may no more like their hawthorns\r\nto be stripped than their hollies, and an ingenuous lad--as will have\r\nbeen observed--told me of “people’s” objections to the unauthorized\r\nstripping of their holly-bushes. But there is not a quarter of the\r\ndifficulty in procuring May that there is in procuring holly at\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nThe costermonger, if he has “done tidy” in the country will very\r\nprobably leave the May at the disposal of his boy; but a few men,\r\nthough perhaps little more than twenty, I was told, bring it on their\r\nown account. The lads then carry the branches about for sale; or if a\r\nconsiderable quantity has been brought, dispose of it to other boys or\r\ngirls, or entrust them with the sale of it, at “half-profits,” or any\r\nterms agreed upon. Costermongers have been known to bring home “a load\r\nof May,” and this not unfrequently, at the request, and for the benefit\r\nof a “cracked-up” brother-trader, to whom it has been at once delivered\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nA lad, whom I met with as he was selling holly, told me that he had\r\nbrought may from the country when he had been there with a coster. He\r\nhad also gone out of town a few miles to gather it on his own account.\r\n“But it ain’t no good;” he said; “you must often go a good way--I never\r\nknows anything about how many miles--and if it’s very ripe (the word he\r\nused) it’s soon shaken. There’s no sure price. You may get 4_d._ for a\r\nbig branch or you must take 1_d._ I may have made 1_s._ on a round but\r\nhardly ever more. It can’t be got near hand. There’s some stunning fine\r\ntrees at the top of the park there (the Regent’s Park) the t’other side\r\nof the ’logical Gardens, but there’s always a cove looking after them,\r\nthey say, and both night and day.”\r\n\r\nPalm, the flower of any of the numerous species of the willow, is sold\r\nonly on Palm Sunday, and the Saturday preceding. The trade is about\r\nequally in the hands of the English and Irish lads, but the English\r\nlads have a commercial advantage on the morning of Palm Sunday, when\r\nso many of the Irish lads are at chapel. The palm is all gathered by\r\nthe street-vendors. One costermonger told me that when he was a lad, he\r\nhad sold palm to a man who had managed to get half-drunk on a Sunday\r\nmorning, and who told him that he wanted it to show his wife, who very\r\nseldom stirred out, that he’d been taking a healthful walk into the\r\ncountry!\r\n\r\nLilac in flower is sold (and procured) in the same way as May, but in\r\nsmall quantities. Very rarely indeed, laburnum; which is too fragile;\r\nor syringa, which, I am told, is hardly saleable in the streets. One\r\ninformant remembered that forty years ago, when he was a boy, branches\r\nof elder-berry flowers were sold in the streets, but the trade has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to form a calculation as to the extent of this\r\ntrade. The best informed give me reason to believe that the sale\r\nof all these branches (apart from Christmas) ranges, according to\r\ncircumstances, from 30_l._ to 50_l._, the cost being the labour of\r\ngathering, and the subsistence of the labourer while at the work. This\r\nis independent of what the costers buy in the markets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now show the quantity of branches forming the street trade:--\r\n\r\n  Holly

treating--the\r\nfondness for the beautiful and the natural.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUT FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  Bunches of                       per bunch\r\n   65,280  Violets               at 1/2_d._         £136\r\n

being annually sold in\r\nthe streets; but locality affects the sale, as some dealers dispose of\r\nmore violets than roses, because violets are accounted less fragile.\r\nThe cheapness and hardihood of the musk-plant and marigold, to say\r\nnothing of their peculiar odour, has made them the most popular of\r\nthe “roots,” while the myrtle is the favourite among the “trees and\r\nshrubs.” The heaths, moreover, command an extensive sale,--a sale, I am\r\ntold, which was unknown, until eight or ten years ago, another instance\r\nof the “fashion in flowers,” of which an informant has spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET-SELLERS OF GREEN STUFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head I class the street-purveyors of water-cresses, and of\r\nthe chickweed, groundsel, plantain, and turf required for cage-birds.\r\nThese purveyors seem to be on the outskirts, as it were, of the\r\ncostermonger class, and, indeed, the regular costers look down upon\r\nthem as an inferior caste. The green-stuff trade is carried on by\r\nvery poor persons, and, generally, by children or old people, some of\r\nthe old people being lame, or suffering from some infirmity, which,\r\nhowever, does not prevent their walking about with their commodities.\r\nTo the children and infirm class, however, the turf-cutters supply an\r\nexception. The costermongers, as I have intimated, do not resort, and\r\ndo not let their children resort, to this traffic. If reduced to the\r\nlast shift, they will sell nuts or oranges in preference. The “old\r\nhands” have been “reduced,” as a general rule, from other avocations.\r\nTheir homes are in the localities I have specified as inhabited by the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nI was informed by a seller of birds, that he thought fewer birds\r\nwere kept by poor working-people, and even by working-people who had\r\nregular, though, perhaps, diminished earnings, than was the case six\r\nor eight years ago. At one time, it was not uncommon for a young man\r\nto present his betrothed with a pair of singing-birds in a neat cage;\r\nnow such a present, as far as my informant’s knowledge extended--and\r\nhe was a sharp intelligent man--was but rarely made. One reason this\r\nman had often heard advanced for poor persons not renewing their\r\nbirds, when lost or dead, is pitiful in its plainness--“they eat too\r\nmuch.” I do not know, that, in such a gift as I have mentioned, there\r\nwas any intention on the part of the lover to typify the beauty of\r\ncheerfulness, even in a very close confinement to home. “I can’t tell,\r\nsir,” was said to me, “how it may have been originally, but I never\r\nheard such a thing said much about, though there’s been joking about\r\nthe matter, as when would the birds have young ones, and such like. No,\r\nsir; I think it was just a fashion.” Contrary to the custom in more\r\nprosperous establishments, I am satisfied, that, among the labouring\r\nclasses, birds are more frequently the pets of the men than of the\r\nwomen. My bird-dealing informant cited merely his own experience, but\r\nthere is no doubt that cage-birds are more extensively kept than ever\r\nin London; consequently there is a greater demand for the “green stuff”\r\nthe birds require.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WATERCRESS-SELLING, IN FARRINGDON-MARKET.\r\n\r\nThe first coster-cry heard of a morning in the London streets is\r\nthat of “Fresh wo-orter-creases.” Those that sell them have to be on\r\ntheir rounds in time for the mechanics’ breakfast, or the day’s gains\r\nare lost. As the stock-money for this calling need only consist of\r\na few halfpence, it is followed by the very poorest of the poor;\r\nsuch as young children, who have been deserted by their parents,\r\nand whose strength is not equal to any very great labour, or by old\r\nmen and women, crippled by disease or accident, who in their dread\r\nof a workhouse life, linger on with the few pence they earn by\r\nstreet-selling.\r\n\r\nAs winter draws near, the Farringdon cress-market begins long before\r\ndaylight. On your way to the City to see this strange sight, the\r\nstreets are deserted; in the squares the blinds are drawn down before\r\nthe windows, and the shutters closed, so that the very houses seem\r\nasleep. All is so silent that you can hear the rattle of the milkmaids’\r\ncans in the neighbouring streets, or the noisy song of three or four\r\ndrunken voices breaks suddenly upon you, as if the singers had turned a\r\ncorner, and then dies away in the distance. On the cab-stands, but one\r\nor two crazy cabs are left, the horses dozing with their heads down to\r\ntheir knees, and the drawn-up windows covered with the breath of the\r\ndriver sleeping inside. At the corners of the streets, the bright fires\r\nof the coffee-stalls sparkle in the darkness, and as you walk along,\r\nthe policeman, leaning against some gas-lamp, turns his lantern full\r\nupon you, as if in suspicion that one who walks abroad so early could\r\nmean no good to householders. At one house there stands a man, with\r\ndirty boots and loose hair, as if he had just left some saloon, giving\r\nsharp single knocks, and then going into the road and looking up at the\r\nbed-rooms, to see if a light appeared in them. As you near the City,\r\nyou meet, if it be a Monday or Friday morning, droves of sheep and\r\nbullocks, tramping quietly along to Smithfield, and carrying a fog of\r\nsteam with them, while behind, with his hands in his pockets, and his\r\ndog panting at his heels, walks the sheep-drover.\r\n\r\nAt the principal entrance to Farringdon-market there is an open space,\r\nrunning the entire length of the railings in front, and extending from\r\nthe iron gates at the entrance to the sheds down the centre of the\r\nlarge paved court before the shops. In this open space the cresses are\r\nsold, by the salesmen or saleswomen to whom they are consigned, in the\r\nhampers they are brought in from the country.\r\n\r\nThe shops in the market are shut, the gaslights over the iron gates\r\nburn brightly, and every now and then you hear the half-smothered\r\ncrowing of a cock, shut up in some shed or bird-fancier’s shop.\r\nPresently a man comes hurrying along, with a can of hot coffee in\r\neach hand, and his stall on his head, and when he has arranged his\r\nstand by the gates, and placed his white mugs between the railings\r\non the stone wall, he blows at his charcoal fire, making the bright\r\nsparks fly about at every puff he gives. By degrees the customers are\r\ncreeping up, dressed in every style of rags; they shuffle up and down\r\nbefore the gates, stamping to warm their feet, and rubbing their hands\r\ntogether till they grate like sandpaper. Some of the boys have brought\r\nlarge hand-baskets, and carry them with the handles round their necks,\r\ncovering the head entirely with the wicker-work as with a hood; others\r\nhave their shallows fastened to their backs with a strap, and one\r\nlittle girl, with the bottom of her gown tattered into a fringe like\r\na blacksmith’s apron, stands shivering in a large pair of worn-out\r\nVestris boots, holding in her blue hands a bent and rusty tea-tray.\r\nA few poor creatures have made friends with the coffee-man, and are\r\nallowed to warm their fingers at the fire under the cans, and as the\r\nheat strikes into them, they grow sleepy and yawn.\r\n\r\nThe market--by the time we reach it--has just begun; one dealer has\r\ntaken his seat, and sits motionless with cold--for it wants but a month\r\nto Christmas--with his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his gray\r\ndriving coat. Before him is an opened hamper, with a candle fixed in\r\nthe centre of the bright green cresses, and as it shines through the\r\nwicker sides of the basket, it casts curious patterns on the ground--as\r\na night shade does. Two or three customers, with their “shallows” slung\r\nover their backs, and their hands poked into the bosoms of their gowns,\r\nare bending over the hamper, the light from which tinges their swarthy\r\nfeatures, and they rattle their halfpence and speak coaxingly to the\r\ndealer, to hurry him in their bargains.\r\n\r\nJust as the church clocks are striking five, a stout saleswoman enters\r\nthe gates, and instantly a country-looking fellow, in a wagoner’s cap\r\nand smock-frock, arranges the baskets he has brought up to London.\r\nThe other ladies are soon at their posts, well wrapped up in warm\r\ncloaks, over their thick shawls, and sit with their hands under their\r\naprons, talking to the loungers, whom they call by their names. Now\r\nthe business commences; the customers come in by twos and threes, and\r\nwalk about, looking at the cresses, and listening to the prices asked.\r\nEvery hamper is surrounded by a black crowd, bending over till their\r\nheads nearly meet, their foreheads and cheeks lighted up by the candle\r\nin the centre. The saleswomen’s voices are heard above the noise of the\r\nmob, sharply answering all objections that may be made to the quality\r\nof their goods. “They’re rather spotty, mum,” says an Irishman, as\r\nhe examines one of the leaves. “No more spots than a newborn babe,\r\nDennis,” answers the lady tartly, and then turns to a new comer. At\r\none basket, a street-seller in an old green cloak, has spread out a\r\nrusty shawl to receive her bunches, and by her stands her daughter, in\r\na thin cotton dress, patched like a quilt. “Ah! Mrs. Dolland,” cried\r\nthe saleswoman in a gracious tone, “can you keep yourself warm? it\r\nbites the fingers like biling water, it do.” At another basket, an old\r\nman, with long gray hair streaming over a kind of policeman’s cape,\r\nis bitterly complaining of the way he has been treated by another\r\nsaleswoman. “He bought a lot of her, the other morning, and by daylight\r\nthey were quite white; for he only made threepence on his best day.”\r\n“Well, Joe,” returns the lady, “you should come to them as knows you,\r\nand allers treats you well.”\r\n\r\nThese saleswomen often call to each other from one end of the market\r\nto the other. If any quarrel take place at one of the hampers, as\r\nfrequently it does, the next neighbour is sure to say something. “Pinch\r\nhim well, Sally,” cried one saleswoman to another; “pinch him well; _I_\r\ndo when I’ve a chance.” “It’s no use,” was the answer; “I might as well\r\ntry to pinch a elephant.”\r\n\r\nOne old wrinkled woman, carrying a basket with an oilcloth bottom, was\r\nasked by a buxom rosy dealer, “Now, Nancy, what’s for you?” But the\r\nold dame was surly with the cold, and sneering at the beauty of the\r\nsaleswoman, answered, “Why don’t you go and get a sweetheart; sich as\r\nyou aint fit for sich as we.” This caused angry words, and Nancy was\r\nsolemnly requested “to draw it mild, like a good soul.”\r\n\r\nAs the morning twilight came on, the paved court was crowded with\r\npurchasers. The sheds and shops at the end of the market grew every\r\nmoment more distinct, and a railway-van, laden with carrots, came\r\nrumbling into the yard. The pigeons, too, began to fly on to the sheds,\r\nor walk about the paving-stones, and the gas-man came round with his\r\nladder to turn out the lamps. Then every one was pushing about; the\r\nchildren crying, as their naked feet were trodden upon, and the women\r\nhurrying off, with their baskets or shawls filled with cresses, and\r\nthe bunch of rushes in their hands. In one corner of the market,\r\nbusily tying up their bunches, were three or four girls seated on the\r\nstones, with their legs curled up under them, and the ground near them\r\nwas green with the leaves they had thrown away. A saleswoman, seeing\r\nme looking at the group, said to me, “Ah! you should come here of a\r\nsummer’s morning, and then you’d see ’em, sitting tying up, young and\r\nold, upwards of a hundred poor things as thick as crows in a ploughed\r\nfield.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GROUNDSEL MAN\r\n\r\n“Chick-weed and Grun-sell!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nAs it grew late, and the crowd had thinned; none but the very poorest\r\nof the cress-sellers were left. Many of these had come without money,\r\nothers had their halfpence tied up carefully in their shawl-ends, as\r\nthough they dreaded the loss. A sickly-looking boy, of about five,\r\nwhose head just reached above the hampers, now crept forward, treading\r\nwith his blue naked feet over the cold stones as a cat does over wet\r\nground. At his elbows and knees, his skin showed in gashes through\r\nthe rents in his clothes, and he looked so frozen, that the buxom\r\nsaleswoman called to him, asking if his mother had gone home. The\r\nboy knew her well, for without answering her question, he went up to\r\nher, and, as he stood shivering on one foot, said, “Give us a few old\r\ncresses, Jinney,” and in a few minutes was running off with a green\r\nbundle under his arm. All of the saleswomen seemed to be of kindly\r\nnatures, for at another stall an old dame, whose rags seemed to be\r\nbeyond credit, was paying for some cresses she had long since been\r\ntrusted with, and excusing herself for the time that had passed since\r\nthe transaction. As I felt curious on the point of the honesty of the\r\npoor, I asked the saleswoman when she was alone, whether they lost much\r\nby giving credit. “It couldn’t be much,” she answered, “if they all of\r\nthem decamped.” But they were generally honest, and paid back, often\r\nreminding her of credit given that she herself had forgotten. Whenever\r\nshe lost anything, it was by the very very poor ones; “though it aint\r\ntheir fault, poor things,” she added in a kindly tone, “for when they\r\nkeeps away from here, it’s either the workhouse or the churchyard as\r\nstops them.”\r\n\r\nAs you walk home--although the apprentice is knocking at the master’s\r\ndoor--the little water-cress girls are crying their goods in every\r\nstreet. Some of them are gathered round the pumps, washing the leaves\r\nand piling up the bunches in their baskets, that are tattered and\r\nworn as their own clothing; in some of the shallows the holes at the\r\nbottom have been laced up or darned together with rope and string, or\r\ntwigs and split laths have been fastened across; whilst others are\r\nlined with oilcloth, or old pieces of sheet-tin. Even by the time the\r\ncress-market is over, it is yet so early that the maids are beating\r\nthe mats in the road, and mechanics, with their tool-baskets swung\r\nover their shoulders, are still hurrying to their work. To visit\r\nFarringdon-market early on a Monday morning, is the only proper way to\r\njudge of the fortitude and courage and perseverance of the poor. As\r\nDouglas Jerrold has beautifully said, “there is goodness, like wild\r\nhoney, hived in strange nooks and corners of the earth.” These poor\r\ncress-sellers belong to a class so poor that their extreme want alone\r\nwould almost be an excuse for theft, and they can be trusted paying\r\nthe few pence they owe even though they hunger for it. It must require\r\nno little energy of conscience on the part of the lads to make them\r\nresist the temptations around them, and refuse the luring advice of\r\nthe young thieves they meet at the low lodging-house. And yet they\r\nprefer the early rising--the walk to market with naked feet along the\r\ncold stones--the pinched meal--and the day’s hard labour to earn the\r\nfew halfpence--to the thief’s comparatively easy life. The heroism of\r\nthe unknown poor is a thing to set even the dullest marvelling, and in\r\nno place in all London is the virtue of the humblest--both young and\r\nold--so conspicuous as among the watercress-buyers at Farringdon-market.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF WATER-CRESS.\r\n\r\nThe dealers in water-cresses are generally very old or very young\r\npeople, and it is a trade greatly in the hands of women. The cause\r\nof this is, that the children are sent out by their parents “to\r\nget a loaf of bread somehow” (to use the words of an old man in the\r\ntrade), and the very old take to it because they are unable to do\r\nhard labour, and they strive to keep away from the workhouse--(“I’d\r\ndo anything before I’d go there--sweep the crossings, or anything:\r\nbut I should have had to have gone to the house before, if it hadn’t\r\nbeen for my wife. I’m sixty-two,” said one who had been sixteen\r\nyears at the trade). The old people are both men and women. The men\r\nhave been sometimes one thing, and sometimes another. “I’ve been a\r\nporter myself,” said one, “jobbing about in the markets, or wherever\r\nI could get a job to do. Then there’s one old man goes about selling\r\nwater-cresses who’s been a seafaring man; he’s very old, he is--older\r\nthan what I am, sir. Many a one has been a good mechanic in his younger\r\ndays, only he’s got too old for labour. The old women have, many of\r\nthem, been laundresses, only they can’t now do the work, you see, and\r\nso they’re glad to pick up a crust anyhow. Nelly, I know, has lost her\r\nhusband, and she hasn’t nothing else but her few creases to keep her.\r\nShe’s as good, honest, hard-working a creature as ever were, for what\r\nshe can do--poor old soul! The young people are, most of them, girls.\r\nThere are some boys, but girls are generally put to it by the poor\r\npeople. There’s Mary Macdonald, she’s about fourteen. Her father is a\r\nbricklayer’s labourer. He’s an Englishman, and he sends little Mary out\r\nto get a halfpenny or two. He gets sometimes a couple of days’ work in\r\nthe week. He don’t get more now, I’m sure, and he’s got three children\r\nto keep out of that; so all on ’em that can work are obligated to do\r\nsomething. The other two children are so small they can’t do nothing\r\nyet. Then there’s Louisa; she’s about twelve, and she goes about with\r\ncreases like I do. I don’t think she’s got ne’er a father. I know she’s\r\na mother alive, and _she_ sells creases like her daughter. The mother’s\r\nabout fifty odd, I dare say. The sellers generally go about with an\r\narm-basket, like a greengrocer’s at their side, or a ‘shallow’ in front\r\nof them; and plenty of them carry a small tin tray before them, slung\r\nround their neck. Ah! it would make your heart ache if you was to go\r\nto Farringdon-market early, this cold weather, and see the poor little\r\nthings there without shoes and stockings, and their feet quite blue\r\nwith the cold--oh, that they are, and many on ’em don’t know how to set\r\none foot before the t’other, poor things. You would say they wanted\r\nsomething give to ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe small tin tray is generally carried by the young children. The\r\ncresses are mostly bought in Farringdon-market: “The usual time to go\r\nto the market is between five and six in the morning, and from that to\r\nseven,” said one informant; “myself, I am generally down in the market\r\nby five. I was there this morning at five, and bitter cold it was, I\r\ngive you my word. We poor old people feel it dreadful. Years ago I\r\ndidn’t mind cold, but I feel it now cruel bad, to be sure. Sometimes,\r\nwhen I’m turning up my things, I don’t hardly know whether I’ve got\r\n’em in my hands or not; can’t even pick off a dead leaf. But that’s\r\nnothing to the poor little things without shoes. Why, bless you, I’ve\r\nseen ’em stand and cry two and three together, with the cold. Ah!\r\nmy heart has ached for ’em over and over again. I’ve said to ’em,\r\nI wonder why your mother sends you out, that I have; and they said\r\nthey was obligated to try and get a penny for breakfast. We buy the\r\nwater-cresses by the ‘hand.’ One hand will make about five halfpenny\r\nbundles. There’s more call for ’em in the spring of the year than what\r\nthere is in the winter. Why, they’re reckoned good for sweetening the\r\nblood in the spring; but, for my own eating, I’d sooner have the crease\r\nin the winter than I would have it in the spring of the year. There’s\r\nan old woman sits in Farringdon-market, of the name of Burrows, that’s\r\nsot there twenty-four years, and she’s been selling out creases to us\r\nall that time.\r\n\r\n“The sellers goes to market with a few pence. I myself goes down there\r\nand lays out sometimes my 4_d._; that’s what I laid out this morning.\r\nSometimes I lay out only 2_d._ and 3_d._, according as how I has the\r\nhalfpence in my pocket. Many a one goes down to the market with only\r\nthree halfpence, and glad to have that to get a halfpenny, or anything,\r\nso as to earn a mouthful of bread--a bellyful that they can’t get no\r\nhow. Ah, many a time I walked through the streets, and picked a piece\r\nof bread that the servants chucked out of the door--may be to the\r\nbirds. I’ve gone and picked it up when I’ve been right hungry. Thinks\r\nI, I can eat that as well as the birds. None of the sellers ever goes\r\ndown to the market with less than a penny. They won’t make less than\r\na pennorth, that’s one ‘hand,’ and if the little thing sells that,\r\nshe won’t earn more than three halfpence out of it. After they have\r\nbought the creases they generally take them to the pump to wet them.\r\nI generally pump upon mine in Hatton-garden. It’s done to make them\r\nlook nice and fresh all the morning, so that the wind shouldn’t make\r\nthem flag. You see they’ve been packed all night in the hamper, and\r\nthey get dry. Some ties them up in ha’porths as they walks along. Many\r\nof them sit down on the steps of St. Andrew’s Church and make them up\r\ninto bunches. You’ll see plenty of them there of a morning between\r\nfive and six. Plenty, poor little dear souls, sitting there,” said the\r\nold man to me. There the hand is parcelled out into five halfpenny\r\nbunches. In the summer the dealers often go to market and lay out as\r\nmuch as 1_s._ “On Saturday morning, this time of year, I buys as many\r\nas nine hands--there’s more call for ’em on Saturday and Sunday morning\r\nthan on any other days; and we always has to buy on Saturdays what\r\nwe want for Sundays--there an’t no market on that day, sir. At the\r\nmarket sufficient creases are bought by the sellers for the morning\r\nand afternoon as well. In the morning some begin crying their creases\r\nthrough the streets at half-past six, and others about seven. They go\r\nto different parts, but there is scarcely a place but what some goes\r\nto--there are so many of us now--there’s twenty to one to what there\r\nused to be. Why, they’re so thick down at the market in the summer\r\ntime, that you might bowl balls along their heads, and all a fighting\r\nfor the creases. There’s a regular scramble, I can assure you, to get\r\nat ’em, so as to make a halfpenny out of them. I should think in the\r\nspring mornings there’s 400 or 500 on ’em down at Farringdon-market\r\nall at one time--between four and five in the morning--if not more\r\nthan that, and as fast as they keep going out, others keep coming\r\nin. I think there is more than a thousand, young and old, about the\r\nstreets in the trade. The working classes are the principal of the\r\ncustomers. The bricklayers, and carpenters, and smiths, and plumbers,\r\nleaving work and going home to breakfast at eight o’clock, purchase the\r\nchief part of them. A great many are sold down the courts and mews,\r\nand bye streets, and very few are got rid of in the squares and the\r\nneighbourhood of the more respectable houses. Many are sold in the\r\nprincipal thoroughfares--a large number in the City. There is a man who\r\nstands close to the Post-office, at the top of Newgate-street, winter\r\nand summer, who sells a great quantity of bunches every morning. This\r\nman frequently takes between 4_s._ and 5_s._ of a winter’s morning,\r\nand about 10_s._ a day in the summer.” “Sixteen years ago,” said the\r\nold man who gave me the principal part of this information, “I could\r\ncome out and take my 18_s._ of a Saturday morning, and 5_s._ on a\r\nSunday morning as well; but now I think myself very lucky if I can\r\ntake my 1_s._ 3_d._, and it’s only on two mornings in the week that I\r\ncan get that.” The hucksters of watercresses are generally an honest,\r\nindustrious, striving class of persons. The young girls are said to\r\nbe well-behaved, and to be the daughters of poor struggling people.\r\nThe old men and women are persons striving to save themselves from the\r\nworkhouse. The old and young people generally travel nine and ten miles\r\nin the course of the day. They start off to market at four and five,\r\nand are out on their morning rounds from seven till nine, and on their\r\nafternoon rounds from half-past two to five in the evening. They travel\r\nat the rate of two miles an hour. “If it wasn’t for my wife, I must go\r\nto the workhouse outright,” said the old watercress man. “Ah, I do’nt\r\nknow what I should do without her, I can assure you. She earns about\r\n1_s._ 3_d._ a day. She takes in a little washing, and keeps a mangle.\r\nWhen I’m at home I turn the mangle for her. The mangle is my own. When\r\nmy wife’s mother was alive she lent us the money to buy it, and as we\r\nearnt the money we paid her back so much a week. It is _that_ what has\r\nkept us together, or else we shouldn’t have been as we are. The mangle\r\nwe give 50_s._ for, and it brings us in now 1_s._ 3_d._ a day with the\r\nwashing. My wife is younger than I am. She is about thirty-five years\r\nold. We have got two children. One is thirteen and the other fifteen.\r\nThey’ve both got learning, and are both in situations. I always sent\r\n’em to school. Though I can’t neither read nor write myself, I wished\r\nto make them some little scholards. I paid a penny a week for ’em at\r\nthe school. Lady M---- has always given me my Christmas dinner for the\r\nlast five years, and God bless her for it--that I _do_ say indeed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERCRESS GIRL.\r\n\r\nThe little watercress girl who gave me the following statement,\r\nalthough only eight years of age, had entirely lost all childish ways,\r\nand was, indeed, in thoughts and manner, a woman. There was something\r\ncruelly pathetic in hearing this infant, so young that her features had\r\nscarcely formed themselves, talking of the bitterest struggles of life,\r\nwith the calm earnestness of one who had endured them all. I did not\r\nknow how to talk with her. At first I treated her as a child, speaking\r\non childish subjects; so that I might, by being familiar with her,\r\nremove all shyness, and get her to narrate her life freely. I asked\r\nher about her toys and her games with her companions; but the look of\r\namazement that answered me soon put an end to any attempt at fun on\r\nmy part. I then talked to her about the parks, and whether she ever\r\nwent to them. “The parks!” she replied in wonder, “where are they?” I\r\nexplained to her, telling her that they were large open places with\r\ngreen grass and tall trees, where beautiful carriages drove about, and\r\npeople walked for pleasure, and children played. Her eyes brightened\r\nup a little as I spoke; and she asked, half doubtingly, “Would they\r\nlet such as me go there--just to look?” All her knowledge seemed to\r\nbegin and end with water-cresses, and what they fetched. She knew no\r\nmore of London than that part she had seen on her rounds, and believed\r\nthat no quarter of the town was handsomer or pleasanter than it was at\r\nFarringdon-market or at Clerkenwell, where she lived. Her little face,\r\npale and thin with privation, was wrinkled where the dimples ought to\r\nhave been, and she would sigh frequently. When some hot dinner was\r\noffered to her, she would not touch it, because, if she eat too much,\r\n“it made her sick,” she said; “and she wasn’t used to meat, only on a\r\nSunday.”\r\n\r\nThe poor child, although the weather was severe, was dressed in a thin\r\ncotton gown, with a threadbare shawl wrapped round her shoulders. She\r\nwore no covering to her head, and the long rusty hair stood out in all\r\ndirections. When she walked she shuffled along, for fear that the large\r\ncarpet slippers that served her for shoes should slip off her feet.\r\n\r\n“I go about the streets with water-creases, crying, ‘Four bunches a\r\npenny, water-creases.’ I am just eight years old--that’s all, and I’ve\r\na big sister, and a brother and a sister younger than I am. On and off,\r\nI’ve been very near a twelvemonth in the streets. Before that, I had\r\nto take care of a baby for my aunt. No, it wasn’t heavy--it was only\r\ntwo months old; but I minded it for ever such a time--till it could\r\nwalk. It was a very nice little baby, not a very pretty one; but, if\r\nI touched it under the chin, it would laugh. Before I had the baby, I\r\nused to help mother, who was in the fur trade; and, if there was any\r\nslits in the fur, I’d sew them up. My mother learned me to needle-work\r\nand to knit when I was about five. I used to go to school, too; but\r\nI wasn’t there long. I’ve forgot all about it now, it’s such a time\r\nago; and mother took me away because the master whacked me, though the\r\nmissus use’n’t to never touch me. I didn’t like him at all. What do you\r\nthink? he hit me three times, ever so hard, across the face with his\r\ncane, and made me go dancing down stairs; and when mother saw the marks\r\non my cheek, she went to blow him up, but she couldn’t see him--he was\r\nafraid. That’s why I left school.\r\n\r\n“The creases is so bad now, that I haven’t been out with ’em for three\r\ndays. They’re so cold, people won’t buy ’em; for when I goes up to\r\nthem, they say, ‘They’ll freeze our bellies.’ Besides, in the market,\r\nthey won’t sell a ha’penny handful now--they’re ris to a penny and\r\ntuppence. In summer there’s lots, and ’most as cheap as dirt; but I\r\nhave to be down at Farringdon-market between four and five, or else\r\nI can’t get any creases, because everyone almost--especially the\r\nIrish--is selling them, and they’re picked up so quick. Some of the\r\nsaleswomen--we never calls ’em ladies--is very kind to us children,\r\nand some of them altogether spiteful. The good one will give you a\r\nbunch for nothing, when they’re cheap; but the others, cruel ones, if\r\nyou try to bate them a farden less than they ask you, will say, ‘Go\r\nalong with you, you’re no good.’ I used to go down to market along with\r\nanother girl, as must be about fourteen, ’cos she does her back hair\r\nup. When we’ve bought a lot, we sits down on a door-step, and ties\r\nup the bunches. We never goes home to breakfast till we’ve sold out;\r\nbut, if it’s very late, then I buys a penn’orth of pudden, which is\r\nvery nice with gravy. I don’t know hardly one of the people, as goes\r\nto Farringdon, to talk to; they never speaks to me, so I don’t speak\r\nto them. We children never play down there, ’cos we’re thinking of\r\nour living. No; people never pities me in the street--excepting one\r\ngentleman, and he says, says he, ‘What do you do out so soon in the\r\nmorning?’ but he gave me nothink--he only walked away.\r\n\r\n“It’s very cold before winter comes on reg’lar--specially getting up\r\nof a morning. I gets up in the dark by the light of the lamp in the\r\ncourt. When the snow is on the ground, there’s no creases. I bears the\r\ncold--you must; so I puts my hands under my shawl, though it hurts ’em\r\nto take hold of the creases, especially when we takes ’em to the pump\r\nto wash ’em. No; I never see any children crying--it’s no use.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I make a great deal of money. One day I took 1_s._ 6_d._,\r\nand the creases cost 6_d._; but it isn’t often I get such luck as\r\nthat. I oftener makes 3_d._ or 4_d._ than 1_s._; and then I’m at work,\r\ncrying, ‘Creases, four bunches a penny, creases!’ from six in the\r\nmorning to about ten. What do you mean by mechanics?--I don’t know what\r\nthey are. The shops buys most of me. Some of ’em says, ‘Oh! I ain’t\r\na-goin’ to give a penny for these;’ and they want ’em at the same price\r\nas I buys ’em at.\r\n\r\n“I always give mother my money, she’s so very good to me. She don’t\r\noften beat me; but, when she do, she don’t play with me. She’s very\r\npoor, and goes out cleaning rooms sometimes, now she don’t work at the\r\nfur. I ain’t got no father, he’s a father-in-law. No; mother ain’t\r\nmarried again--he’s a father-in-law. He grinds scissors, and he’s very\r\ngood to me. No; I dont mean by that that he says kind things to me,\r\nfor he never hardly speaks. When I gets home, after selling creases,\r\nI stops at home. I puts the room to rights: mother don’t make me do\r\nit, I does it myself. I cleans the chairs, though there’s only two to\r\nclean. I takes a tub and scrubbing-brush and flannel, and scrubs the\r\nfloor--that’s what I do three or four times a week.\r\n\r\n“I don’t have no dinner. Mother gives me two slices of bread-and-butter\r\nand a cup of tea for breakfast, and then I go till tea, and has the\r\nsame. We has meat of a Sunday, and, of course, I should like to have\r\nit every day. Mother has just the same to eat as we has, but she takes\r\nmore tea--three cups, sometimes. No; I never has no sweet-stuff;\r\nI never buy none--I don’t like it. Sometimes we has a game of\r\n‘honey-pots’ with the girls in the court, but not often. Me and Carry\r\nH---- carries the little ’uns. We plays, too, at ‘kiss-in-the-ring.’\r\nI knows a good many games, but I don’t play at ’em, ’cos going out\r\nwith creases tires me. On a Friday night, too, I goes to a Jew’s house\r\ntill eleven o’clock on Saturday night. All I has to do is to snuff the\r\ncandles and poke the fire. You see they keep their Sabbath then, and\r\nthey won’t touch anything; so they gives me my wittals and 1-1/2_d._,\r\nand I does it for ’em. I have a reg’lar good lot to eat. Supper of\r\nFriday night, and tea after that, and fried fish of a Saturday morning,\r\nand meat for dinner, and tea, and supper, and I like it very well.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I’ve got some toys at home. I’ve a fire-place, and a box of\r\ntoys, and a knife and fork, and two little chairs. The Jews gave ’em\r\nto me where I go to on a Friday, and that’s why I said they was very\r\nkind to me. I never had no doll; but I misses little sister--she’s only\r\ntwo years old. We don’t sleep in the same room; for father and mother\r\nsleeps with little sister in the one pair, and me and brother and other\r\nsister sleeps in the top room. I always goes to bed at seven, ’cos I\r\nhas to be up so early.\r\n\r\n“I am a capital hand at bargaining--but only at buying watercreases.\r\nThey can’t take me in. If the woman tries to give me a small handful of\r\ncreases, I says, ‘I ain’t a goin’ to have that for a ha’porth,’ and I\r\ngo to the next basket, and so on, all round. I know the quantities very\r\nwell. For a penny I ought to have a full market hand, or as much as I\r\ncould carry in my arms at one time, without spilling. For 3_d._ I has\r\na lap full, enough to earn about a shilling; and for 6_d._ I gets as\r\nmany as crams my basket. I can’t read or write, but I knows how many\r\npennies goes to a shilling, why, twelve, of course, but I don’t know\r\nhow many ha’pence there is, though there’s two to a penny. When I’ve\r\nbought 3_d._ of creases, I ties ’em up into as many little bundles\r\nas I can. They must look biggish, or the people won’t buy them, some\r\npuffs them out as much as they’ll go. All my money I earns I puts in a\r\nclub and draws it out to buy clothes with. It’s better than spending\r\nit in sweet-stuff, for them as has a living to earn. Besides it’s like\r\na child to care for sugar-sticks, and not like one who’s got a living\r\nand vittals to earn. I aint a child, and I shan’t be a woman till I’m\r\ntwenty, but I’m past eight, I am. I don’t know nothing about what I\r\nearns during the year, I only know how many pennies goes to a shilling,\r\nand two ha’pence goes to a penny, and four fardens goes to a penny. I\r\nknows, too, how many fardens goes to tuppence--eight. That’s as much as\r\nI wants to know for the markets.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe market returns I have obtained show the following result of\r\nthe quantity vended in the streets, and of the receipts by the\r\ncress-sellers:--\r\n\r\n A TABLE SHOWING THE QUANTITY OF WATERCRESSES SOLD WHOLESALE THROUGHOUT\r\n THE YEAR IN LONDON, WITH THE PROPORTION RETAILED IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+---------------------+--------------\r\n                 |                     |  Proportion\r\n                 |  Quantity sold      |  retailed in\r\n      Market.    |    wholesale.       |  the Streets.\r\n  ---------------+---------------------+--------------\r\n  Covent Garden  |  1,578,000 bunches  |  one-eighth.\r\n  Farringdon     | 12,960,000    „     |  one-half.\r\n  Borough        |    180,000    „     |  one-half.\r\n  Spitalfields   |    180,000    „     |  one-half.\r\n  Portman        |     60,000    „     |  one-third.\r\n                 | ----------          |\r\n    Total        | 14,958,000    „     |\r\n  ---------------+---------------------+--------------\r\n\r\nFrom this sale the street cress-sellers receive:--\r\n\r\n                  Bunches.

Of this description of cress they purchase\r\none-half of all that is sold in Farringdon; of the finer, and smaller,\r\nand brown-leaved cress sold there, they purchase hardly any. At Covent\r\nGarden only the finer sorts of cress are in demand, and, consequently,\r\nthe itinerants buy only an eighth in that market, and they are not\r\nencouraged there. They purchase half the quantity in the Borough,\r\nand the same in Spitalfields, and a third at Portman. I have before\r\nmentioned that 500 might be taken as the number supported by the sale\r\nof “creases;” that is, 500 families, or at least 1,000 individuals. The\r\ntotal amount received is nearly 14,000_l._, and this apportioned among\r\n1,000 street-sellers, gives a weekly receipt of 5_s._ 5_d._, with a\r\nprofit of 3_s._ 3_d._ per individual.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy is further accounted for because the other market\r\nsalesmen buy cresses at Farringdon; but I have given under the head of\r\nFarringdon _all_ that is sold to those other markets to be disposed to\r\nthe street-sellers, and the returns from the other markets are of the\r\ncresses carried _direct_ there, apart from any purchases at Farringdon.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF GROUNDSEL AND CHICKWEED SELLERS.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion (in the _Morning Chronicle_) I mentioned that\r\nI received a letter informing me that a woman, residing in one of\r\nthe courts about Saffron-hill, was making braces, and receiving only\r\n1_s._ for four dozen of them. I was assured she was a most deserving\r\ncharacter, strictly sober, and not receiving parochial relief. “Her\r\nhusband,” my informant added, “was paralysed, and endeavoured to\r\nassist his family by gathering green food for birds. They are in deep\r\ndistress, but their character is irreproachable.” I found the couple\r\nlocated up a court, the entrance to which was about as narrow as the\r\nopening to a sentry-box, and on each side lolled groups of labourers\r\nand costermongers, with short black pipes in their mouths. As I dived\r\ninto the court, a crowd followed me to see whither I was going. The\r\nbrace-maker lived on the first floor of a crazy, fœtid house. I\r\nascended the stairs, and the banisters, from which the rails had all\r\nbeen purloined, gave way in my hands. I found the woman, man, and\r\ntheir family busy at their tea-dinner. In a large broken chair, beside\r\nthe fire-place, was the old paralysed man, dressed in a ragged greasy\r\nfustian coat, his beard unshorn, and his hair in the wildest disorder.\r\nOn the edge of the bed sat a cleanly looking woman, his wife, with a\r\nblack apron on. Standing by the table was a blue-eyed laughing and\r\nshoeless boy, with an old camlet cape pinned over his shoulders. Next\r\nhim was a girl in a long grey pinafore, with her hair cut close to her\r\nhead, with the exception of a few locks in front, which hung down over\r\nher forehead like a dirty fringe. On a chair near the window stood a\r\nbasket half full of chickweed and groundsel, and two large cabbages.\r\nThere was a stuffed linnet on the mantel-piece and an empty cage\r\nhanging outside the window. In front of the window-sill was the small\r\nimitation of a gate and palings, so popular among the workpeople. On\r\nthe table were a loaf, a few mugs of milkless tea and a small piece of\r\nbutter in a saucer. I had scarcely entered when the mother began to\r\nremove the camlet cape from the boy’s shoulders, and to slip a coarse\r\nclean pinafore over his head instead. At present I have only to deal\r\nwith the trade of the husband, who made the following statement:\r\n\r\n“I sell chickweed and grunsell, and turfs for larks. That’s all I\r\nsell, unless it’s a few nettles that’s ordered. I believe they’re for\r\ntea, sir. I gets the chickweed at Chalk Farm. I pay nothing for it. I\r\ngets it out of the public fields. Every morning about seven I goes for\r\nit. The grunsell a gentleman gives me leave to get out of his garden:\r\nthat’s down Battle-bridge way, in the Chalk-road, leading to Holloway.\r\nI gets there every morning about nine. I goes there straight. After I\r\nhave got my chickweed, I generally gathers enough of each to make up\r\na dozen halfpenny bunches. The turfs I buys. A young man calls here\r\nwith them. I pay 2_d._ a dozen for ’em to him. He gets them himself.\r\nSometimes he cuts ’em at Kilburn Wells; and Notting-hill he goes to\r\nsometimes, I believe. He hires a spring barrow, weekly, to take them\r\nabout. He pays 4_d._ a day, I believe, for the barrow. He sells the\r\nturfs to the bird-shops, and to such as me. He sells a few to some\r\nprivate places. I gets the nettles at Highgate. I don’t do much in\r\nthe nettle line--there ain’t much call for it. After I’ve gathered\r\nmy things I puts them in my basket, and slings ’em at my back, and\r\nstarts round London. Low Marrabun I goes to always of a Saturday and\r\nWednesday. I goes to St. Pancras on a Tuesday. I visit Clerkenwell, and\r\nRussell-square, and round about there, on a Monday. I goes down about\r\nCovent-garden and the Strand on a Thursday. I does High Marrabun on a\r\nFriday, because I aint able to do so much on that day, for I gathers\r\nmy stuff on the Friday for Saturday. I find Low Marrabun the best of\r\nmy beats. I cry ‘chickweed and grunsell’ as I goes along. I don’t say\r\n‘for young singing birds.’ It is usual, I know, but _I_ never did.\r\nI’ve been at the business about eighteen year. I’m out in usual till\r\nabout five in the evening. I never stop to eat. I’m walking all the\r\ntime. I has my breakfast afore I starts, and my tea when I comes home.”\r\nHere the woman shivered. I turned round and found the fire was quite\r\nout. I asked them whether they usually sat without one. The answer\r\nwas, “We most generally raise a pennyworth, some how, just to boil the\r\nkettle with.” I inquired whether she was cold, and she assured me she\r\nwasn’t. “It was the blood,” she said, “that ran through her like ice\r\nsometimes.” “I am a walking ten hours every day--wet or dry,” the man\r\ncontinued. “I don’t stand nice much about that. I can’t go much above\r\none mile and a half an hour, owing to my right side being paralysed.\r\nMy leg and foot and all is quite dead. I goes with a stick.” [The\r\nwife brought the stick out from a corner of the room to show me. It\r\nwas an old peculiarly carved one, with a bird rudely cut out of wood\r\nfor the handle, and a snake twisting itself up the stick.] “I walk\r\nfifteen miles every day of my life, that I do--quite that--excepting\r\nSunday, in course. I generally sell the chickweed and grunsell and\r\nturfs, all to the houses, not to the shops. The young man as cut the\r\nturf gathers grunsell as well for the shops. They’re tradespeople and\r\ngentlefolks’ houses together that I sells to--such as keeps canaries,\r\nor goldfinches, or linnets. I charge 1/2_d._ a bunch for chickweed and\r\ngrunsell together. It’s the regular charge. The nettles is ordered in\r\ncertain quantities; I don’t get them unless they’re ordered: I sells\r\nthese in three-pennn’orths at a time. Why, Saturday is my best day,\r\nand that’s the reason why I can’t spare time to gather on that day. On\r\nSaturday I dare say I gets rid on two dozen bunches of chickweed and\r\ngrunsell. On the other days, sometimes, I goes out and don’t sell above\r\nfive or six bunches; at other times I get rid on a dozen; that I call\r\na tidy day’s work for any other day but a Saturday, and some days I\r\ndon’t sell as much as a couple of bunches in the whole day. Wednesday\r\nis my next best day after Saturday. On a Wednesday, sometimes, I sell\r\na dozen and a half. In the summer I does much better than in winter.\r\nThey gives it more to the birds then, and changes it oftener. I’ve\r\nseed a matter of eight or nine people that sell chickweed and grunsell\r\nlike myself in the fields where I goes to gather it. They mostly all\r\ngoes to where I do to get mine. They are a great many that sells\r\ngrunsell about the streets in London, like I do. I dare say there is a\r\nhundred, and far more nor that, taking one place with another. I takes\r\nmy nettles to ladies’ houses. They considers the nettles good for the\r\nblood, and drinks ’em at tea, mostly in the spring and autumn. In the\r\nspring I generally sells three threepenn’orths of ’em a week, and in\r\nthe autumn about two threepenn’orths. The ladies I sell the nettles to\r\nare mostly sickly, but sometimes they aint, and has only a breaking\r\nout in the skin, or in their face. The nettles are mostly taken in Low\r\nMarrabun. I gathers more than all for Great Titchfield-street. The\r\nturfs I sell mostly in London-street, in Marrabun and John-street,\r\nand Carburton-street, and Portland-street, and Berners, and all about\r\nthere. I sells about three dozen of turfs a week. I sells them at three\r\nand four a penny. I charges them at three a penny to gentlefolks and\r\nfour a penny to tradespeople. I pays 2_d._ a dozen for ’em and so makes\r\nfrom 1_d._ to 2_d._ a dozen out of ’em. I does trifling with these\r\nin the winter--about two dozen a week, but always three dozen in the\r\nsummer. Of the chickweed and grunsell I sells from six to seven dozen\r\nbunches a week in the summer, and about four or five dozen bunches\r\nin the winter. I sells mostly to regular customers, and a very few\r\nto chance ones that meet me in the street. The chance customers come\r\nmostly in the summer times. Altogether I should say with my regular\r\nand chance customers I make from 4_s._ to 5_s._ a week in the summer,\r\nand from 3_s._ to 4_s._ in the winter. That’s as near as I can tell.\r\nLast Monday I was out all day, and took 1-1/2_d._; Tuesday I took\r\nabout 5-1/2_d._; Wednesday I got 9-1/2_d._; Thursday I can’t hardly\r\nrecollect, not to tell the truth about it. But oh, dear me, yes I\r\nwasn’t allowed to go out on that day. We was given to understand\r\nnothing was allowed to be sold on that day. They told us it were the\r\nThanksgiving-day. I was obliged to fast on that day. We did have a\r\nlittle in the morning, a trifle, but not near enough. Friday I came\r\nhome with nigh upon 6_d._, and Saturday I got 1_s._, and 3_d._ after\r\nwhen I went out at night. I goes into Leather-lane every Saturday\r\nnight, and stands with my basket there, so that altogether, last week\r\nI made 3_s._ 1-1/2_d._ But that was a slack week with me, owing to my\r\nhaving lost Thursday. If it hadn’t been for that I should have made\r\nnear upon 4_s._ We felt the loss very severely. Prices have come down\r\ndreadful with us. The same bunches as I sell now for 1/2_d._ I used to\r\nget 1_d._ for nine or ten years ago. I dare say I could earn then, take\r\none day with another, such a thing as 7_s._ a week, summer and winter\r\nthrough. There’s so many at it now to what there was afore, that it’s\r\ndifficult to get a living, and the ladies are very hard with a body.\r\nThey tries to beat me down, and particular in the matter of turfs. They\r\ntell me they can buy half-a-dozen for 1_d._, so I’m obligated to let\r\n’em have three or four. There’s a many women at the business. I hardly\r\nknow which is the most, men or women. There’s pretty nigh as much of\r\none as the other, I think. I am a bed-sacking weaver by trade. When I\r\nworked at it I used to get 15_s._ a week regularly. But I was struck\r\nwith paralysis nearly nineteen years ago, and lost the use of all one\r\nside, so I was obleeged to turn to summut else. Another grunseller\r\ntold me on the business, and what he got, and I thought I couldn’t do\r\nno better. That’s a favourite linnet. We had that one stuffed there. A\r\nyoung man that I knew stuffed it for me. I was very sorry when the poor\r\nthing died. I’ve got another little linnet up there.” “I’m particular\r\nfond of little birds,” said the wife. “I never was worse off than I am\r\nnow. I pays 2_s._ a week rent, and we has, take one time with another,\r\nabout 3_s._ for the four of us to subsist upon for the whole seven\r\ndays; yes, that, take one time with another, is generally what I do\r\nhave. We very seldom has any meat. This day week we got a pound of\r\npieces. I gave 4_d._ for ’em. Everything that will pledge I’ve got in\r\npawn. I’ve been obliged to let them go. I can’t exactly say how much\r\nI’ve got in pledge, but you can see the tickets.” [The wife brought out\r\na tin box full of duplicates. They were for the usual articles--coats,\r\nshawls, shirts, sheets, handkerchiefs, indeed almost every article\r\nof wearing-apparel and bedding. The sums lent were mostly 6_d._ and\r\n9_d._, while some ran as high as 2_s._ The dates of many were last\r\nyear, and these had been backed for three months.] “I’ve been paying\r\ninterest for many of the things there for seven years. I pay for the\r\nbacking 2-1/2_d._, that is 1_d._ for the backing, and 1-1/2_d._ for the\r\nthree months’ interest. I pay 6_d._ a year interest on every one of the\r\ntickets. If its only 3_d._, I have to pay 1/2_d._ a month interest just\r\nthe same, but nothing for the ticket when we put it in.” The number of\r\nduplicates was 26, and the gross sum amounted to 1_l._ 4_s._ 8_d._ One\r\nof the duplicates was for 4_d._; nine were for 6_d._, two for 9_d._,\r\nnine were for 1_s._, two for 1_s._ 6_d._, one for 1_s._ 3_d._, one for\r\n1_s._ 7_d._ and two for 2_s._ “The greatest comfort I should like to\r\nhave would be something more on our beds. We lay dreadful cold of a\r\nnight, on account of being thin clad. I have no petticoats at all. We\r\nhave no blankets--of late years I haven’t had any. The warm clothing\r\nwould be the greatest blessing I could ask. I’m not at all discontented\r\nat my lot. That wouldn’t mend it. We strive and do the best we can, and\r\nmay as well be contented over it. I think its God’s will we should be\r\nas we are. Providence is kind to me, even badly off as we are. I know\r\nit’s all for the best.”\r\n\r\nThere are no “pitches,” or stands, for the sale of groundsel in the\r\nstreets; but, from the best information I could acquire, there are now\r\n1,000 itinerants selling groundsel, each person selling, as an average,\r\n18 bunches a day. We thus have 5,616,000 bunches a year, which, at\r\n1/2_d._ each, realise 11,700_l._--about 4_s._ 2_d._ per week per head\r\nof sellers of groundsel. The “oldest hand” in the trade is the man\r\nwhose statement and likeness I give. The sale continues through the\r\nyear, but “the groundsel” season extends from April to September; in\r\nthose months 24 bunches, per individual seller, is the extent of the\r\ntraffic, in the other months half that quantity, giving the average of\r\n18 bunches.\r\n\r\nThe capital required for groundsel-selling is 4_d._ for a brown\r\nwicker-basket; leather strap to sling it from the shoulder, 6_d._; in\r\nall, 10_d._ No knife is necessary; they pluck the groundsel.\r\n\r\nChickweed is only sold in the summer, and is most generally mixed with\r\ngroundsel and plantain. The chickweed and plantain, together, are but\r\nhalf the sale of groundsel, and that only for five months, adding, to\r\nthe total amount, 2,335_l._ But this adds little to the profits of the\r\nregular itinerants; for, when there is the best demand, there are the\r\ngreatest number of sellers, who in winter seek some other business. The\r\ntotal amount of “green stuff” expended upon birds, as supplied by the\r\nstreet-sellers, I give at the close of my account of the trade of those\r\npurveyors.\r\n\r\nMany of the groundsel and chickweed-sellers--for the callings are\r\ncarried on together--who are aged men, were formerly brimstone-match\r\nsellers, who “didn’t like to take to the lucifers.”\r\n\r\nOn the publication of this account in the _Morning Chronicle_,\r\nseveral sums were forwarded to the office of that journal for the\r\nbenefit of this family. These were the means of removing them to a\r\nmore comfortable home, of redeeming their clothing, and in a measure\r\nrealizing the wishes of the poor woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF TURF CUTTING AND SELLING.\r\n\r\nA man long familiar with this trade, and who knew almost every\r\nmember of it individually, counted for me 36 turf-cutters, to his\r\nown knowledge, and was confident that there were 40 turf-cutters and\r\n60 sellers in London; the addition of the sellers, however, is but\r\nthat of 10 women, who assist their husbands or fathers in the street\r\nsales,--but no women cut turf,--and of 10 men who sell, but buy of the\r\ncutters.\r\n\r\nThe turf is simply a sod, but it is considered indispensable that it\r\nshould contain the leaves of the “small Dutch clover,” (the shamrock\r\nof the Irish), the most common of all the trefoils. The turf is\r\nused almost entirely for the food and roosting-place of the caged\r\nsky-larks. Indeed one turf-cutter said to me: “It’s only people that\r\ndon’t understand it that gives turf to other birds, but of course if\r\nwe’re asked about it, we say it’s good for every bird, pigeons and\r\nchickens and all; and very likely it is if they choose to have it.”\r\nThe principal places for the cutting of turf are at present Shepherd’s\r\nBush, Notting Hill, the Caledonian Road, Hampstead, Highgate, Hornsey,\r\nPeckham, and Battersea. Chalk Farm was an excellent place, but it is\r\nnow exhausted, “fairly flayed” of the shamrocks. Parts of Camden Town\r\nwere also fertile in turf, but they have been built over. Hackney was a\r\ndistrict to which the turf-cutters resorted, but they are now forbidden\r\nto cut sods there. Hampstead Heath used to be another harvest-field\r\nfor these turf-purveyors, but they are now prohibited from “so much\r\nas sticking a knife into the Heath;” but turf-cutting is carried on\r\nsurreptitiously on all the outskirts of the Heath, for there used\r\nto be a sort of feeling, I was told, among some real Londoners that\r\nHampstead Heath yielded the best turf of any place. All the “commons”\r\nand “greens,” Paddington, Camberwell, Kennington, Clapham, Putney, &c.\r\nare also forbidden ground to the turf-cutter. “O, as to the parks and\r\nPrimrose Hill itself--round about it’s another thing--nobody,” it was\r\nanswered to my inquiry, “ever thought of cutting their turf there. The\r\npeople about, if they was only visitors, wouldn’t stand it, and right\r\ntoo. I wouldn’t, if I wasn’t in the turf-cutting myself.”\r\n\r\nThe places where the turf is principally cut are the fields, or plots,\r\nin the suburbs, in which may be seen a half-illegible board, inviting\r\nthe attention of the class of speculating builders to an “eligible\r\nsite” for villas. Some of these places are open, and have long been\r\nopen, to the road; others are protected by a few crazy rails, and the\r\nturf-cutters consider that outside the rails, or between them and the\r\nroad, they have a _right_ to cut turf, unless forbidden by the police.\r\nThe fact is, that they cut it on sufferance; but the policeman never\r\ninterferes, unless required to do so by the proprietor of the land\r\nor his agent. One gentleman, who has the control over a considerable\r\nquantity of land “eligible” for building, is very inimical to the\r\npursuits of the turf-cutters, who, of course, return his hostility. One\r\nman told me that he was required, late on a Saturday night, some weeks\r\nago, to supply six dozen of turfs to a very respectable shopkeeper, by\r\nten or eleven on the Sunday morning. The shopkeeper had an aristocratic\r\nconnection, and durst not disappoint his customers in their demands\r\nfor fresh turf on the Sunday, so that the cutter must supply it. In\r\ndoing so, he encountered Mr. ---- (the gentleman in question), who\r\nwas exceedingly angry with him: “You d--d poaching thief!” said the\r\ngentleman, “if this is the way you pass your Sunday, I’ll give you\r\nin charge.” One turf-cutter, I was informed, had, within these eight\r\nyears, paid 3_l._ 15_s._ fines for trespassing, besides losing his\r\nbarrow, &c., on every conviction: “But he’s a most outdacious fellor,”\r\nI was told by one of his mates, “and won’t mind spoiling anybody’s\r\nground to save hisself a bit of trouble. There’s too many that way,\r\nwhich gives us a bad name.” Some of the managers of the land to\r\nbe built upon give the turf-cutters free leave to labour in their\r\nvocation; others sell the sods for garden-plots, or use them to set out\r\nthe gardens to any small houses they may be connected with, and with\r\nthem the turf-cutters have no chance of turning a sod or a penny.\r\n\r\nI accompanied a turf-cutter, to observe the manner of his work. We\r\nwent to the neighbourhood of Highgate, which we reached a little\r\nbefore nine in the morning. There was nothing very remarkable to be\r\nobserved, but the scene was not without its interest. Although it was\r\nnearly the middle of January, the grass was very green and the weather\r\nvery mild. There happened to be no one on the ground but my companion\r\nand myself, and in some parts of our progress nothing was visible\r\nbut green fields with their fringe of dark-coloured leafless trees;\r\nwhile in other parts, which were somewhat more elevated, glimpses of\r\nthe crowded roof of an omnibus, or of a line of fleecy white smoke,\r\nshowing the existence of a railway, testified to the neighbourhood of\r\na city; but no sound was heard except, now and then, a distant railway\r\nwhistle. The turf-cutter, after looking carefully about him--the result\r\nof habit, for I was told afterwards, by the policeman, that there was\r\nno trespass--set rapidly to work. His apparatus was a sharp-pointed\r\ntable-knife of the ordinary size, which he inserted in the ground,\r\nand made it rapidly describe a half-circle; he then as rapidly ran\r\nhis implement in the opposite half-circle, flung up the sod, and,\r\nafter slapping it with his knife, cut off the lower part so as to\r\nleave it flat--working precisely as does a butcher cutting out a joint\r\nor a chop, and reducing the fat. Small holes are thus left in the\r\nground--of such shape and size as if deep saucers were to be fitted\r\ninto them--and in the event of a thunder-shower in droughty weather,\r\nthey become filled with water, and have caused a puzzlement, I am\r\ntold, to persons taking their quiet walk when the storm had ceased, to\r\ncomprehend why the rain should be found to gather in little circular\r\npools in some parts, and not in others.\r\n\r\nThe man I accompanied cut and shaped six of these turfs in about a\r\nminute, but he worked without intermission, and rather to show me\r\nwith what rapidity and precision he could cut, than troubling himself\r\nto select what was saleable. After that we diverged in the direction\r\nof Hampstead; and in a spot not far from a temporary church, found\r\nthree turf-cutters at work,--but they worked asunder, and without\r\ncommunication one with another. The turfs, as soon as they are cut\r\nand shaped, are thrown into a circular basket, and when the basket\r\nis full it is emptied on to the barrow (a costermonger’s barrow),\r\nwhich is generally left untended at the nearest point: “We can trust\r\none another, as far as I know,” said one turf-man to me, “and nobody\r\nelse would find it worth while to steal turfs.” The largest number\r\nof men that my most intelligent informant had ever seen at work in\r\none locality was fourteen, and that was in a field just about to be\r\nbuilt over, and “where they had leave.” Among the turf-purveyors there\r\nis no understanding as to where they are to “cut.” Wet weather does\r\nnot interfere with turf procuring; it merely adds to the weight, and\r\nconsequently to the toil of drawing the barrow. Snow is rather an\r\nadvantage to the street-seller, as purchasers are apt to fancy that\r\nif the storm continues, turfs will not be obtainable, and so they buy\r\nmore freely. The turf-man clears the snow from the ground in any known\r\nlocality--the cold pinching his ungloved hands--and cuts out the turf,\r\n“as green,” I was told, “as an April sod.” The weather most dreaded is\r\nthat when hoar frost lies long and heavy on the ground, for the turf\r\ncut with the rime upon it soon turns black, and is unsaleable. Foggy\r\ndark weather is also prejudicial, “for then,” one man said, “the days\r\nclips it uncommon short, and people won’t buy by candlelight, no more\r\nwill the shops. Birds has gone to sleep then, and them that’s fondest\r\non them says, ‘We can get fresher turf to-morrow.’” The gatherers\r\ncannot work by moonlight; “for the clover leaves then shuts up,” I was\r\ntold by one who said he was a bit of a botanist, “like the lid of a\r\nbox, and you can’t tell them.”\r\n\r\nOne of my informants told me that he cut 25 dozen turfs every Friday\r\n(the great working turf-day) of the year on an average (he sometimes\r\ncut on that day upwards of 30 dozen); 17 dozen on a Tuesday; and 6\r\ndozen on the other days of the week, more or less, as the demand\r\njustified--but 6 dozen was an average. He had also cut a few turfs on\r\na Sunday morning, but only at long intervals, sometimes only thrice a\r\nyear. Thus one man will cut 2,496 dozen, or 29,952 turfs in a year, not\r\nreckoning the product of any Sunday. From the best information I could\r\nacquire, there seems no doubt but that one-half of the turf-cutters\r\n(20) exert a similar degree of industry to that detailed; and the\r\nother 20 procure a moiety of the quantity cut and disposed of by their\r\nstronger and more fortunate brethren. This gives an aggregate, for an\r\naverage year, of 598,560 turfs, or including Sunday turf-cutting, of\r\n600,000. Each turf is about 6 inches diameter at the least; so that the\r\nwhole extent of turf cut for London birds yearly, if placed side by\r\nside, would extend fifty-six miles, or from London to Canterbury.\r\n\r\nIn wet weather, 6 dozen turfs weigh, on an average, 1 cwt.; in dry\r\nweather, 8 dozen weigh no more; if, therefore, we take 7 dozen as the\r\nusual hundred-weight, a turf-cutter of the best class carries, in\r\nbasket-loads, to his barrow, and when his stock is completed, drags\r\ninto town from the localities I have specified, upwards of 3-1/2 cwt.\r\nevery Friday, nearly 2-1/2 every Tuesday, and about 7 cwt. in the\r\ncourse of a week; the smaller traders drag half the quantity,--and the\r\ntotal weight of turf disposed of for the cage-birds of London, every\r\nyear, is 546 tons.\r\n\r\nOf the supply of turf, obtained as I have described, at least\r\nthree-fourths is sold to the bird-shops, who retail it to their\r\ncustomers. The price paid by these shopkeepers to the labourers for\r\ntheir turf trade is 2_d._ and 2-1/2_d._ a dozen, but rarely 2-1/2_d._\r\nThey retail it at from 3_d._ to 6_d._ a dozen, according to connection\r\nand locality. The remainder is sold by the cutters on their rounds from\r\nhouse to house, at two and three a penny.\r\n\r\nNone of the turf-cutters confine themselves to it. They sell in\r\naddition groundsel, chickweed, plaintain, very generally; and a few\r\nsupply nettles, dandelion, ground-ivy, snails, worms, frogs, and toads.\r\nThe sellers of groundsel and chickweed are far more numerous, as I have\r\nshown, than the turf-cutters--indeed many of them are incapable of\r\ncutting turf or of dragging the weight of the turfs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE AND CUSTOMERS OF A TURF-CUTTER.\r\n\r\nA short but strongly-built man, of about thirty, with a very English\r\nface, and dressed in a smock-frock, wearing also very strong unblacked\r\nboots, gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n“My father,” he said, “was in the Earl of ----’s service, and I was\r\nbrought up to stable-work. I was employed in a large coaching inn,\r\nin Lancashire, when I was last employed in that way, but about ten\r\nyears ago a railway line was opened, and the coaching was no go any\r\nlonger; it hadn’t a chance to pay, so the horses and all was sold, and\r\nI was discharged with a lot of others. I walked from Manchester to\r\nLondon--for I think most men when they don’t know what in the world\r\nto do, come to London--and I lived a few months on what little money\r\nI had, and what I could pick up in an odd job about horses. I had\r\nsome expectations when I came up that I might get something to do\r\nthrough my lord, or some of his people--they all knew me: but my lord\r\nwas abroad, and his establishment wasn’t in town, and I had to depend\r\nentirely on myself. I was beat out three or four times, and didn’t\r\nknow what to do, but somehow or other I got over it. At last--it’s\r\nbetween eight and nine years ago--I was fairly beat out. I was taking a\r\nwalk--I can’t say just now in what way I went, for it was all one which\r\nway--but I remember I saw a man cutting turf, and I remembered then\r\nthat a man that lived near me lived pretty middling by turf-cutting.\r\nSo I watched how it was done, and then I inquired how I could get into\r\nit, and as I’d paid my way I could give reference to show I might be\r\ntrusted; so I got a barrow on hire, and a basket, and bought a knife\r\nfor 3_d._ at a marine-shop, and set to work. At first I only supplied\r\nshops, but in a little time I fell into a private round, and that pays\r\nbetter. I’ve been at it almost every day, I may say, ever since. My\r\nbest customers are working people that’s fond of birds; they’re far\r\nthe best. It’s the ready penny with them, and no grumbling. I’ve lost\r\nmoney by trusting noblemen; of course I blame their servants. You’d be\r\nsurprised, sir, to hear how often at rich folks’ houses, when they’ve\r\ntaken their turf or what they want, they’ll take credit and say, ‘O,\r\nI’ve got no change,’ or ‘I can’t be bothered with ha’pence,’ or ‘you\r\nmust call again.’ There’s one great house in Cavendish-square always\r\ntakes a month’s credit, and pays one month within another (pays the\r\nfirst month as the second is falling due), and not always that very\r\nregular. They can’t know how poor men has to fight for a bit of bread.\r\nSome people are very particular about their turfs, and look very sharp\r\nfor the small clover leaves. We never have turfs left on hand: in\r\nsummer we water them to keep them fresh; in wet weather they don’t\r\nrequire it; they’ll keep without. I think I make on turf 9_s._ a week\r\nall the year round; the summer’s half as good again as the winter.\r\nSupposing I make 3_s._ a week on groundsel, and chickweed, and snails,\r\nand other things, that’s 12_s._--but look you here, sir. I pay 3_s._\r\n6_d._ a week for my rent--it’s a furnished room--and 1_s._ 6_d._ a week\r\nfor my barrow; that’s 5_s._ off the 12_s._; and I’ve a wife and one\r\nlittle boy. My wife may get a day at least every week at charring; she\r\nhas 1_s._ for it and her board. She helps me when she’s not out, and if\r\nshe is out, I sometimes have to hire a lad, so it’s no great advantage\r\nthe shilling a day. I’ve paid 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for my barrow--it’s a\r\nvery good and big one--for four years. Before that I paid 2_s._ a week.\r\nO yes, sir, I know very well, that at 1_s._ 6_d._ a week I’ve paid\r\nnearly 14_l._ for a barrow worth only 2_l._ 2_s._; but I can’t help\r\nit; I really can’t. I’ve tried my hardest to get money to have one of\r\nmy own, and to get a few sticks (furniture) of my own too. It’s no use\r\ntrying any more. If I have ever got a few shillings a-head, there’s a\r\npair of shoes wanted, or there’s something else, or my wife has a fit\r\nof sickness, or my little boy has, or something’s sure to happen that\r\nway, and it all goes. Last winter was a very hard time for people in my\r\nway, from hoar frost and fogs. I ran near 3_l._ into debt; greater part\r\nof it for house-rent and my barrow; the rest was small sums borrowed\r\nof shopkeepers that I served. I paid all up in the summer, but I’m now\r\n14_s._ in debt for my barrow; it always keeps me back; the man that\r\nowns it calls every Sunday morning, but he don’t press me, if I haven’t\r\nmoney. I would get out of the life if I could, but will anybody take a\r\ngroom out of the streets? and I’m not master of anything but grooming.\r\nI can read and write. I was brought up a Roman Catholic, and was\r\nchristened one. I never go to mass now. One gets out of the way of such\r\nthings, having to fight for a living as I have. It seems like mocking\r\ngoing to chapel, when you’re grumbling in your soul.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF PLANTAIN-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nPlantain is sold extensively, and is given to canaries, but water-cress\r\nis given to those birds more than any other green thing. It is the ripe\r\nseed, in a spike, of the “great” and the “ribbed” plantain. The green\r\nleaves of the last-mentioned plant used to be in demand as a styptick.\r\nShenstone speaks of “plantain ribbed, that heals the reaper’s wound.”\r\nI believe that it was never sold in the streets of London. The most of\r\nthe plantain is gathered in the brick-fields, wherever they are found,\r\nas the greater plantain, which gives three-fourths of the supply, loves\r\nan arid situation. It is sold in hands to the shops, about 60 “heads”\r\ngoing to a “hand,” at a price, according to size, &c., from 1_d._ to\r\n4_d._ On a private round, five or six are given for a halfpenny. It is,\r\nhowever, generally gathered and sold with chickweed, and along with\r\nchickweed I have shown the quantity used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe money-value of the several kinds and quantities of “green-stuff”\r\nannually purchased in the streets of London is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  6,696,450 bunches of water-cresses, at 1/2_d._ per bunch   £13,950\r\n  5,616,000    „       groundsel, at 1/2_d._                  11,700\r\n  1,120,800    „       chickweed and plantain                  2,335\r\n  660,000 turfs, at 2-1/2_d._ per doz.                           572\r\n                                                             -------\r\n                                                              28,557\r\n\r\nOf the above amount, it may be said that upwards of 14,000_l._ are\r\nspent yearly on what may be called the bird-food of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF EATABLES AND DRINKABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese dealers were more numerous, even when the metropolitan population\r\nwas but half its present extent. I heard several causes assigned for\r\nthis,--such as the higher rate of earnings of the labouring people\r\nat that time, as well as the smaller number of shopkeepers who deal\r\nin such cheap luxuries as penny pies, and the fewer places of cheap\r\namusement, such as the “penny gaffs.” These places, I was told, “run\r\naway with the young people’s pennies,” which were, at one period,\r\nexpended in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe class engaged in the manufacture, or in the sale, of these\r\narticles, are a more intelligent people than the generality of\r\nstreet-sellers. They have nearly all been mechanics who, from inability\r\nto procure employment at their several crafts--from dislike to an\r\nirksome and, perhaps, sedentary confinement--or from an overpowering\r\ndesire “to be their own masters,” have sought a livelihood in the\r\nstreets. The purchase and sale of fish, fruit, or vegetables require\r\nno great training or deftness; but to make the dainties, in which\r\nstreet-people are critical, and to sell them at the lowest possible\r\nprice, certainly requires some previous discipline to produce the skill\r\nto combine and the taste to please.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that I found it common enough among these\r\nstreet-sellers to describe themselves and their fraternity not by\r\ntheir names or callings, but by the article in which they deal. This\r\nis sometimes ludicrous enough: “Is the man you’re asking about a\r\npickled whelk, sir?” was said to me. In answer to another inquiry, I\r\nwas told, “Oh, yes, I know him--he’s a sweet-stuff.” Such ellipses, or\r\nabbreviations, are common in all mechanical or commercial callings.\r\n\r\nMen and women, and most especially boys, purchase their meals day\r\nafter day in the streets. The coffee-stall supplies a warm breakfast;\r\nshell-fish of many kinds tempt to a luncheon; hot-eels or pea-soup,\r\nflanked by a potato “all hot,” serve for a dinner; and cakes and tarts,\r\nor nuts and oranges, with many varieties of pastry, confectionary, and\r\nfruit, woo to indulgence in a dessert; while for supper there is a\r\nsandwich, a meat pudding, or a “trotter.”\r\n\r\nThe street provisions consist of cooked or prepared victuals, which may\r\nbe divided into solids, pastry, confectionary, and drinkables.\r\n\r\nThe “solids” however, of these three divisions, are such as only\r\nregular street-buyers consider to be sufficing for a substantial meal,\r\nfor it will be seen that the comestibles accounted “good for dinner,”\r\nare all of a _dainty_, rather than a solid character. Men whose lives,\r\nas I have before stated, are alternations of starvation and surfeit,\r\nlove some easily-swallowed and comfortable food, better than the most\r\napproved substantiality of a dinner-table. I was told by a man, who was\r\nonce foodless for thirty-eight hours, that in looking into the window\r\nof a cook-shop--he longed far more for a basin of soup than for a cut\r\nfrom the boiled round, or the roasted ribs, of beef. He felt a gnawing\r\nrather than a ravenous desire, and some tasty semi-liquid was the\r\nincessant object of his desires.\r\n\r\nThe solids then, according to street estimation, consist of hot-eels,\r\npickled whelks, oysters, sheep’s-trotters, pea-soup, fried fish,\r\nham-sandwiches, hot green peas, kidney puddings, boiled meat puddings,\r\nbeef, mutton, kidney, and eel pies, and baked potatos. In each of these\r\nprovisions the street poor find a mid-day or mid-night meal.\r\n\r\nThe pastry and confectionary which tempt the street eaters are tarts of\r\nrhubarb, currant, gooseberry, cherry, apple, damson, cranberry, and (so\r\ncalled) mince pies; plum dough and plum-cake; lard, currant, almond and\r\nmany other varieties of cakes, as well as of tarts; gingerbread-nuts\r\nand heart-cakes; Chelsea buns; muffins and crumpets; “sweet stuff”\r\nincludes the several kinds of rocks, sticks, lozenges, candies, and\r\nhard-bakes; the medicinal confectionary of cough-drops and horehound;\r\nand, lastly, the more novel and aristocratic luxury of street-ices; and\r\nstrawberry cream, at 1_d._ a glass, (in Greenwich Park).\r\n\r\nThe drinkables are tea, coffee, and cocoa; ginger-beer, lemonade,\r\nPersian sherbet, and some highly-coloured beverages which have no\r\nspecific name, but are introduced to the public as “cooling” drinks;\r\nhot elder cordial or wine; peppermint water; curds and whey; water (as\r\nat Hampstead); rice milk; and milk in the parks.\r\n\r\nAt different periods there have been attempts to introduce more\r\nsubstantial viands into the street provision trade, but all within\r\nthese twenty years have been exceptional and unsuccessful. One man\r\na few years back established a portable cook-shop in Leather-lane,\r\ncutting out portions of the joints to be carried away or eaten on the\r\nspot, at the buyer’s option. But the speculation was a failure. Black\r\npuddings used to be sold, until a few years back, smoking from cans,\r\nnot unlike potato cans, in such places as the New Cut; but the trade in\r\nthese rather suspicious articles gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\nMr. Albert Smith, who is an acute observer in all such matters, says,\r\nin a lively article on the Street Boys of London:\r\n\r\n“The kerb is his club, offering all the advantages of one of those\r\ninstitutions without any subscription or ballot. Had he a few pence,\r\nhe might dine equally well as at Blackwall, and with the same variety\r\nof delicacies without going twenty yards from the pillars of St.\r\nClement’s churchyard. He might begin with a water _souchée_ of eels,\r\nvarying his first course with pickled whelks, cold fried flounders,\r\nor periwinkles. Whitebait, to be sure, he would find a difficulty\r\nin procuring, but as the more cunning gourmands do not believe these\r\ndelicacies to be fish at all, but merely little bits of light pie-crust\r\nfried in grease;--and as moreover, the brown bread and butter is after\r\nall the grand attraction,--the boy might soon find a substitute. Then\r\nwould come the potatos, apparently giving out so much steam that the\r\ncan which contains them seems in momentary danger of blowing up;\r\nlarge, hot, mealy fellows, that prove how unfounded were the alarms\r\nof the bad-crop-ites; and he might next have a course of boiled feet\r\nof some animal or other, which he would be certain to find in front\r\nof the gin-shop. Cyder-cups perhaps he would not get; but there would\r\nbe ‘ginger-beer from the fountain, at 1_d._ per glass;’ and instead\r\nof mulled claret, he could indulge in hot elder cordial; whilst for\r\ndessert he could calculate upon all the delicacies of the season, from\r\nthe salads at the corner of Wych-street to the baked apples at Temple\r\nBar. None of these things would cost more than a penny a piece; some\r\nof them would be under that sum; and since as at Verey’s, and some\r\nother foreign restaurateurs, there is no objection to your dividing the\r\n“portions,” the boy might, if he felt inclined to give a dinner to a\r\nfriend, get off under 6_d._ There would be the digestive advantage too\r\nof moving leisurely about from one course to another; and, above all,\r\nthere would be no fee to waiters.” After alluding to the former glories\r\nof some of the street-stands, more especially of the kidney pudding\r\nestablishments which displayed rude transparencies, one representing\r\nthe courier of St. Petersburg riding six horses at once for a kidney\r\npudding, Mr. Smith continues,--“But of all these eating-stands the\r\nchief favourite with the boy is the potato-can. They collect around\r\nit as they would do on ’Change, and there talk over local matters, or\r\ndiscuss the affairs of the adjacent cab-stand, in which they are at\r\ntimes joined by the waterman whom they respect, more so perhaps than\r\nthe policeman; certainly more than they do the street-keeper, for him\r\nthey especially delight to annoy, and they watch any of their fellows\r\neating a potato, with a curiosity and an attention most remarkable, as\r\nif no two persons fed in the same manner, and they expected something\r\nstrange or diverting to happen at every mouthful.”\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who has taken an artist’s interest in all connected\r\nwith the streets, and has been familiar with their daily and nightly\r\naspect from the commencement of the present century, considers that\r\nthe great change is not so much in what has ceased to be sold, but\r\nin the introduction of fresh articles into street-traffic--such as\r\npine-apples and Brazil-nuts, rhubarb and cucumbers, ham-sandwiches,\r\nginger-beer, &c. The coffee-stall, he represents, has but superseded\r\nthe saloop-stall (of which I have previously spoken); while the class\r\nof street-customers who supported the saloop-dealer now support the\r\npurveyor of coffee. The _appearance_ of the two stalls, however, seen\r\nbefore daybreak, with their respective customers, on a bleak winter’s\r\nmorning, was very different. Round the saloop-stall was a group--hardly\r\ndiscernible at a little distance in the dimly-lighted streets--the\r\nprominent figures being of two callings now extinct--the climbing-boy\r\nand the old hackney-coachman.\r\n\r\nThe little sweep _would_ have his saloop smoking hot--and there was the\r\ncommon appliance of a charcoal grate--regaling himself with the savoury\r\nsteam until the mess was cool enough for him to swallow; whilst he\r\nsought to relieve his naked feet from the numbing effects of the cold\r\nby standing now on the right foot and now on the left, and swinging the\r\nother to and fro, until a change of posture was necessitated; his white\r\nteeth the while gleamed from his sooty visage as he gleefully licked\r\nhis lips at the warm and oily breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe old hackney-coachman was wrapped up in a many-caped great coat,\r\ndrab--when it left the tailor’s hands some years before--but then\r\nworn and discoloured, and, perhaps, patched or tattered; its weight\r\nalone, however, communicated a sort of warmth to the wearer; his legs\r\nwere closely and artistically “wisped” with hay-bands; and as he kept\r\nsmiting his chest with his arms, “to keep the cold out,” while his\r\nsaloop was cooling, he would, in no very gentle terms, express his\r\ndesire to add to its comforting influence the stimulant of a “flash of\r\nlightning,” a “go of rum,” or a “glass of max,”--for so a dram of neat\r\nspirit was then called.\r\n\r\nThe old watchman of that day, too, almost as heavily coated as the\r\nhackneyman, would sometimes partake of the street “Saloop-loop-loop!\r\n_Sa_-loop!” The woman of the town, in “looped and windowed raggedness,”\r\nthe outcast of the very lowest class, was at the saloop, as she is\r\nnow and then at the coffee-stall, waiting until daylight drove her to\r\nher filthy lodging-house. But the climbing-boy has, happily, left no\r\nsuccessor; the hackneyman has been succeeded by the jauntier cabman;\r\nand the taciturn old watchman by the lounging and trim policeman.\r\n\r\nAnother class of street-sellers, no longer to be seen, were the\r\n“barrow-women.” They sold fruit of all kinds, little else, in very\r\nclean white barrows, and their fruit was excellent, and purchased by\r\nthe wealthier classes. They were, for the most part, Irish women, and\r\nsome were remarkable for beauty. Their dress was usually a good chintz\r\ngown, the skirt being tidily tucked or pinned up behind, “in a way,”\r\nsaid one informant, “now sometimes seen on the stage when correctness\r\nof costume is cared for.” These women were prosperous in their calling,\r\nnor was there any imputation on their chastity, as the mothers were\r\nalmost always wives.\r\n\r\nConcerning the bygone street-cries, I had also the following account\r\nfrom the personal observation of an able correspondent:--\r\n\r\n“First among the old ‘musical cries,’ may be cited the ‘Tiddy\r\nDoll!’--immortalised by Hogarth--then comes the last person, who, with\r\na fine bass voice, coaxed his customers to buy _sweets_ with, ‘Quack,\r\nquack, quack, quack! Browns, browns, browns! have you got any mouldy\r\nbrowns?’ There was a man, too, who sold tripe, &c., in this way, and\r\nto some purpose; he was as fine a man as ever stepped, and his deep\r\nrich voice would ring through a whole street, ‘Dog’s-meat! cat’s-meat!\r\nnice tripe! neat’s feet! Come buy my trotters!’ The last part would\r\nnot have disgraced Lablache. He discovered a new way of pickling\r\ntripe--got on--made contracts for supplying the Navy during the war,\r\nand acquired a large property. One of our most successful artists is\r\nhis grandson. Then there was that delight of our childhood--the eight\r\no’clock ‘Hot spiced gingerbread! hot spiced gingerbread! buy my spiced\r\ngingerbread! sm-o-o-king hot!’” Another informant remembered a very\r\npopular character (among the boys), whose daily cry was: “Hot spiced\r\ngingerbread nuts, nuts, nuts! If _one_’ll warm you, _wha-at_’ll a pound\r\ndo?--_Wha-a-a-at_’ll a pound do?” Gingerbread was formerly in much\r\ngreater demand than it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PEA-SOUP AND HOT EELS.\r\n\r\nTwo of the condiments greatly relished by the chilled labourers and\r\nothers who regale themselves on street luxuries, are “pea-soup” and\r\n“hot eels.” Of these tradesmen there may be 500 now in the streets on\r\na Saturday. As the two trades are frequently carried on by the same\r\nparty, I shall treat of them together. The greatest number of these\r\nstands is in Old-street, St. Luke’s, about twenty. In warm weather\r\nthese street-cooks deal only in “hot eels” and whelks; as the whelk\r\ntrade is sometimes an accompaniment of the others, for then the\r\nsoup will not sell. These dealers are stationary, having stalls or\r\nstands in the street, and the savoury odour from them attracts more\r\nhungry-looking gazers and longers than does a cook-shop window. They\r\nseldom move about, but generally frequent the same place. A celebrated\r\ndealer of this class has a stand in Clare-street, Clare-market,\r\nopposite a cat’s-meat shop; he has been heard to boast, that he\r\nwouldn’t soil his hands at the business if he didn’t get his 30_s._ a\r\nday, and his 2_l._ 10_s._ on a Saturday. Half this amount is considered\r\nto be about the truth. This person has mostly all the trade for hot\r\neels in the Clare-market district. There is another “hot eel purveyor”\r\nat the end of Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road, that does a very\r\ngood trade. It is thought that he makes about 5_s._ a day at the\r\nbusiness, and about 10_s._ on Saturday. There was, before the removals,\r\na man who came out about five every afternoon, standing in the New-cut,\r\nnearly opposite the Victoria Theatre, his “girl” always attending to\r\nthe stall. He had two or three lamps with “hot eels” painted upon\r\nthem, and a handsome stall. He was considered to make about 7_s._ a\r\nday by the sale of eels alone, but he dealt in fried fish and pickled\r\nwhelks as well, and often had a pile of fried fish a foot high. Near\r\nthe Bricklayers’ Arms, at the junction of the Old and New Kent-roads,\r\na hot-eel man dispenses what a juvenile customer assured me was “as\r\nspicy as any in London, as if there was gin in it.” But the dealer in\r\nClare-market does the largest trade of all in the hot-eel line. He is\r\n“the head man.” On one Saturday he was known to sell 100lbs. of eels,\r\nand on most Saturdays he will get rid of his four “draughts” of eels (a\r\ndraught being 20lbs.) He and his son are dressed in Jenny Lind hats,\r\nbound with blue velvet, and both dispense the provisions, while the\r\ndaughter attends to wash the cups. “On a Sunday, anybody,” said my\r\ninformant, “would think him the first nobleman or squire in the land,\r\nto see him dressed in his white hat, with black crape round it, and his\r\ndrab paletot and mother-o’-pearl buttons, and black kid gloves, with\r\nthe fingers too long for him.”\r\n\r\nI may add, that even the very poorest, who have only a halfpenny to\r\nspend, as well as those with better means, resort to the stylish\r\nstalls in preference to the others. The eels are all purchased at\r\nBillingsgate early in the morning. The parties themselves, or their\r\nsons or daughters, go to Billingsgate, and the watermen row them to\r\nthe Dutch eel vessels moored off the market. The fare paid to the\r\nwatermen is 1_d._ for every 10lbs. purchased and brought back in the\r\nboat, the passenger being gratis. These dealers generally trade on\r\ntheir own capital; but when some have been having “a flare up,” and\r\nhave “broke down for stock,” to use the words of my informant, they\r\nborrow 1_l._, and pay it back in a week or a fortnight at the outside,\r\nand give 2_s._ for the loan of it. The money is usually borrowed of\r\nthe barrow, truck, and basket-lenders. The amount of capital required\r\nfor carrying on the business of course depends on the trade done;\r\nbut even in a small way, the utensils cost 1_l._ They consist of one\r\nfish-kettle and one soup-kettle, holding upon an average three gallons\r\neach; besides these, five basins and five cups and ten spoons are\r\nrequired, also a washhand basin to wash the cups, basins, and spoons\r\nin, and a board and tressel on which the whole stand. In a large way,\r\nit requires from 3_l._ to 4_l._ to fit up a handsome stall. For this\r\nthe party would have “two fine kettles,” holding about four gallons\r\neach, and two patent cast-iron fireplaces (the 1_l._ outfit only admits\r\nof the bottoms of two tin saucepans being used as fireplaces, in which\r\ncharcoal is always burning to keep the eels and soup hot; the whelks\r\nare always eaten cold). The crockery and spoons would be in no way\r\nsuperior. A small dealer requires, over and above this sum, 10_s._ to\r\ngo to market with and purchase stock, and the large dealer about 30_s._\r\nThe class of persons belonging to the business have either been bred to\r\nit, or taken to it through being out of work. Some have been disabled\r\nduring their work, and have resorted to it to save themselves from the\r\nworkhouse. The price of the hot eels is a halfpenny for five or seven\r\npieces of fish, and three-parts of a cupfull of liquor. The charge\r\nfor a half-pint of pea-soup is a halfpenny, and the whelks are sold,\r\naccording to the size, from a halfpenny each to three or four for the\r\nsame sum. These are put out in saucers.\r\n\r\nThe eels are Dutch, and are cleaned and washed, and cut in small pieces\r\nof from a half to an inch each. [The daughter of one of my informants\r\nwas busily engaged, as I derived this information, in the cutting of\r\nthe fish. She worked at a blood-stained board, with a pile of pieces\r\non one side and a heap of entrails on the other.] The portions so cut\r\nare then boiled, and the liquor is thickened with flour and flavoured\r\nwith chopped parsley and mixed spices. It is kept hot in the streets,\r\nand served out, as I have stated, in halfpenny cupfulls, with a small\r\nquantity of vinegar and pepper. The best purveyors add a little butter.\r\nThe street-boys are extravagant in their use of vinegar.\r\n\r\nTo dress a draught of eels takes three hours--to clean, cut them up,\r\nand cook them sufficiently; and the cost is now 5_s._ 2_d._ (much\r\nlower in the summer) for the draught (the 2_d._ being the expense of\r\n“shoring”), 8_d._ for 4 lb. of flour to thicken the liquor, 2_d._ for\r\nthe parsley to flavour it, and 1_s._ 6_d._ for the vinegar, spices,\r\nand pepper (about three quarts of vinegar and two ounces of pepper).\r\nThis quantity, when dressed and seasoned, will fetch in halfpennyworths\r\nfrom 15_s._ to 18_s._ The profit upon this would be from 7_s._ to 9_s._\r\n6_d._; but the cost of the charcoal has to be deducted, as well as the\r\nsalt used while cooking. These two items amount to about 5_d._\r\n\r\nThe pea-soup consists of split peas, celery, and beef bones. Five\r\npints, at 3-1/2_d._ a quart, are used to every three gallons; the\r\nbones cost 2_d._, carrots 1_d._, and celery 1/2_d._--these cost 1_s._\r\n0-1/4_d._; and the pepper, salt, and mint, to season it, about 2_d._\r\nThis, when served in halfpenny basinfulls, will fetch from 2_s._ 3_d._\r\nto 2_s._ 4_d._, leaving 1_s._ 1_d._ profit. But from this the expenses\r\nof cooking must be taken; so that the clear gain upon three gallons\r\ncomes to about 11_d._ In a large trade, three kettles, or twelve\r\ngallons, of pea-soup will be disposed of in the day, and about four\r\ndraughts, or 80 lbs., of hot eels on every day but Saturday,--when\r\nthe quantity of eels disposed of would be about five draughts, or 100\r\nlbs. weight, and about 15 gallons of pea-soup. Hence the profits of\r\na good business in the hot-eel and pea-soup line united will be from\r\n7_l._ to 7_l._ 10_s._ per week, or more. But there is only one man in\r\nLondon does this amount of business, or rather makes this amount of\r\nmoney. A small business will do about 15 lbs. of eels in the week,\r\nincluding Saturday, and about 12 gallons of soup. Sometimes credit is\r\ngiven for a halfpennyworth, or a pennyworth, at the outside; but very\r\nlittle is lost from bad debts. Boys who are partaking of the articles\r\nwill occasionally say to the proprietor of the stall, “Well, master,\r\nthey _are_ nice; trust us another ha’p’orth, and I’ll pay you when I\r\ncomes again;” but they are seldom credited, for the stall-keepers know\r\nwell they would never see them again. Very often the stock cooked is\r\nnot disposed of, and then it is brought home and eaten by the family.\r\nThe pea-soup will seldom keep a night, but what is left the family\r\ngenerally use for supper.\r\n\r\nThe dealers go out about half-past ten in the morning, and remain out\r\ntill about ten at night. Monday is the next best day to Saturday.\r\nThe generality of the customers are boys from 12 to 16 years of age.\r\nNewsboys are very partial to hot eels--women prefer the pea-soup. Some\r\nof the boys will have as many as six halfpenny cupfulls consecutively\r\non a Saturday night; and some women will have three halfpenny\r\nbasinsfull of soup. Many persons in the cold weather prefer the hot\r\nsoup to beer. On wet, raw, chilly days, the soup goes off better than\r\nusual, and in fine weather there is a greater demand for the hot eels.\r\nOne dealer assured me that he once _did_ serve two gentlemen’s servants\r\nwith twenty-eight halfpenny cupfulls of hot eels one after another.\r\nOne servant had sixteen, and the other twelve cupfulls, which they ate\r\nall at one standing; and one of these customers was so partial to hot\r\neels, that he used to come twice a day every day for six months after\r\nthat, and have eight cupfulls each day, four at noon and four in the\r\nevening. These two persons were the best customers my informant ever\r\nhad. Servants, however, are not generally partial to the commodity. Hot\r\neels are not usually taken for dinner, nor is pea-soup, but throughout\r\nthe whole day, and just at the fancy of the passers-by. There are no\r\nshops for the sale of these articles. The dealers keep no accounts of\r\nwhat their receipts and expenditure are.\r\n\r\nThe best time of the year for the hot eels is from the middle of June\r\nto the end of August. On some days during that time a person in a small\r\nway of business will clear upon an average 1_s._ 6_d._ a day, on other\r\ndays 1_s._; on some days, during the month of August, as much as 2_s._\r\n6_d._ a day. Some cry out “Nice hot eels--nice hot eels!” or “Warm your\r\nhands and fill your bellies for a halfpenny.” One man used to give his\r\nsurplus eels, when he considered his sale completed on a night, to the\r\npoor creatures refused admission into a workhouse, lending them his\r\ncharcoal fire for warmth, which was always returned to him. The poor\r\ncreatures begged cinders, and carried the fire under a railway arch.\r\nThe general rule, however, is for the dealer to be silent, and merely\r\nexpose the articles for sale. “I likes better,” said one man to me, “to\r\ntouch up people’s noses than their heyes or their hears.” There are\r\nnow in the trade almost more than can get a living at it, and their\r\nearnings are less than they were formerly. One party attributed this\r\nto the opening of a couple of penny-pie shops in his neighbourhood.\r\nBefore then he could get 2_s._ 6_d._ a day clear, take one day with\r\nanother; but since the establishment of the business in the penny-pie\r\nline he cannot take above 1_s._ 6_d._ a day clear. On the day the\r\nfirst of these pie-shops opened, it made as much as 10 lbs., or half a\r\ndraught of eels, difference to him. There was a band of music and an\r\nillumination at the pie-shop, and it was impossible to stand against\r\n_that_. The fashionable dress of the trade is the “Jenny Lind” or\r\n“wide-awake” hat, with a broad black ribbon tied round it, and a white\r\napron and sleeves. The dealers usually go to Hampton-court or Greenwich\r\non a fine Sunday. They are partial to the pit of Astley’s. One of them\r\ntold his waterman at Billingsgate the other morning that “he and his\r\ngood lady had been werry amused with the osses at Hashley’s last night.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A HOT-EEL AND PEA-SOUP MAN.\r\n\r\n“I was a coalheaver,” said one of the class to me, as I sat in his\r\nattic up a close court, watching his wife “thicken the liquor;” “I was\r\na-going along the plank, from one barge to another, when the swell of\r\nsome steamers throwed the plank off the ‘horse,’ and chucked me down,\r\nand broke my knee agin the side of the barge. Before that I was yarning\r\nupon an average my 20_s._ to 30_s._ a week. I was seven months and four\r\ndays in King’s College Hospital after this. I found they was a-doing me\r\nno good there, so I come out and went over to Bartholemy’s Hospital.\r\nI was in there nineteen months altogether, and after that I was a\r\nmonth in Middlesex Hospital, and all on ’em turned me out oncurable.\r\nYou see, the bone’s decayed--four bits of bone have been taken from\r\nit. The doctor turned me out three times ’cause I wouldn’t have it\r\noff. He asked my wife if she would give consent, but neither she nor\r\nmy daughter would listen to it, so I was turned out on ’em all. How\r\nmy family lived all this time it’s hard to tell. My eldest boy did a\r\nlittle--got 3_s._ 6_d._ a week as an errand-boy, and my daughter was\r\nin service, and did a little for me; but that was all we had to live\r\nupon. There was six children on my hands, and however they _did_ manage\r\nI can’t say. After I came out of the hospital I applied to the parish,\r\nand was allowed 2_s._ 6_d._ a week and four loaves. But I was anxious\r\nto do something, so a master butcher, as I knowed, said he would get\r\nme ‘a pitch’ (the right to fix a stall), if I thought I could sit at a\r\nstall and sell a few things. I told him I thought I could, and would be\r\nvery thankful for it. Well, I had heard how the man up in the market\r\nwas making a fortune at the hot-eel and pea-soup line. [A paviour as\r\nleft his barrow and two shovels with me told me to-day, said the man,\r\nby way of parenthesis--‘that he knowed for a fact he was clearing 6_l._\r\na week regular.’] So I thought I’d have a touch at the same thing.\r\nBut you see, I never could rise money enough to get sufficient stock\r\nto make a do of it, and never shall, I expect--it don’t seem like it,\r\nhowever. I ought to have 5_s._ to go to market with to-morrow, and\r\nI ain’t got above 1_s._ 6_d._; and what’s that for stock-money, I’d\r\nlike to know? Well, as I was saying, the master butcher lent me 10_s._\r\nto start in the line. He was the best friend I ever had. But I’ve\r\nnever been able to do anything at it--not to say to get a living.” “He\r\ncan’t carry anything now, sir,” said his wife, as the old man strove\r\nto get the bellows to warm up the large kettle of pea-soup that was\r\non the fire. “Aye, I can’t go without my crutch. My daughter goes to\r\nBillingsgate for me. I’ve got nobody else; and she cuts up the eels.\r\nIf it warn’t for her I must give it up altogether, and go into the\r\nworkhouse outright. I couldn’t fetch ’em. I ought to have been out\r\nto-night by rights till ten, if I’d had anything to have sold. My wife\r\ncan’t do much; she’s troubled with the rheumatics in her head and\r\nlimbs.” “Yes,” said the old body, with a sigh, “I’m never well, and\r\nnever shall be again, I know.” “Would you accept on a drop of soup,\r\nsir?” asked the man; “you’re very welcome, I can assure you. You’ll\r\nfind it very good, sir.” I told him I had just dined, and the poor old\r\nfellow proceeded with his tale. “Last week I earned clear about 8_s._,\r\nand that’s to keep six on us. I didn’t pay no rent last week nor yet\r\nthis, and I don’t know when I shall again, if things goes on in this\r\nway. The week before there was a fast-day, and I didn’t earn above\r\n6_s._ that week, if I did that. My boy can’t go to school. He’s got no\r\nshoes nor nothing to go in. The girls go to the ragged-school, but we\r\ncan’t send them of a Sunday nowhere.” “Other people can go,” said one\r\nof the young girls nestling round the fire, and with a piece of sacking\r\nover her shoulders for a shawl--“them as has got things to go in; but\r\nmother don’t like to let us go as we are.” “She slips her mother’s\r\nshoes on when she goes out. It would take 1_l._ to start me well.\r\nWith that I could go to market, and buy my draught of eels a shilling\r\ncheaper, and I could afford to cut my pieces a little bigger; and\r\npeople where they gets used well comes again--don’t you see? I could\r\nhave sold more eels if I’d had ’em to-day, and soup too. Why, there’s\r\nfour hours of about the best time to-night that I’m losing now ’cause\r\nI’ve nothing to sell. The man in the market can give more than we can.\r\nHe gives what is called the lumping ha’p’orth--that is, seven or eight\r\npieces; ah, that I daresay he does; indeed, some of the boys has told\r\nme he gives as many as eight pieces. And then the more eels you biles\r\nup, you see, the richer the liquor is, and in our little tin-pot way\r\nit’s like biling up a great jint of meat in a hocean of water. In\r\ncourse we can’t compete agin the man in the market, and so we’re being\r\nruined entirely. The boys very often comes and asks me if I’ve got a\r\nfarden’s-worth of heads. The woman at Broadway, they tells me, sells\r\n’em at four a farden and a drop of liquor, but we chucks ’em away,\r\nthere’s nothing to eat on them; the boys though will eat anything.”\r\n\r\nIn the hot-eel trade are now 140 vendors, each selling 6 lb. of eels\r\ndaily at their stands; 60 sell 40 lb. daily; and 100 are itinerant,\r\nselling 5 lb. nightly at the public-houses. The first mentioned take\r\n2_s._ daily; the second 16_s._; and the third 1_s._ 8_d._ This gives a\r\nstreet expenditure in the trade in hot eels of 21,910_l._ for the year.\r\n\r\nTo start in this business a capital is required after this rate:--stall\r\n6_s._; basket 1_s._; eel-kettle 3_s._ 6_d._; jar 6_d._; ladle 4_d._;\r\n12 cups 1_s._; 12 spoons 1_s._; stew-pan 2_s._; chafing-dish 6_d._;\r\nstrainer 1_s._; 8 cloths 2_s._ 8_d._; a pair sleeves 4_d._; apron\r\n4_d._; charcoal 2_s._ (4_d._ being an average daily consumption); 1/4\r\ncwt. coal 3-1/2_d._; 1/2 lb. butter (the weekly average) 4_d._; 1\r\nquartern flour 5_d._; 4 oz. pepper 4_d._; 1 quart vinegar 10_d._; 1 lb.\r\nsalt 1/2_d._; 1 lb. candles for stall 6_d._; parsley 3_d._; stock-money\r\n10_s._ In all 1_l._ 15_s._ In the course of a year the property which\r\nmay be described as fixed, as in the stall, &c., and the expenditure\r\ndaily occurring as for stock, butter, coal, according to the foregoing\r\nstatement, amounts to 15,750_l._ The eels purchased for this trade at\r\nBillingsgate are 1,166,880 lb., costing, at 3_d._ per lb., 14,586_l._\r\n\r\nIn the pea-soup trade there are now one half of the whole number of\r\nthe hot-eel vendors; of whom 100 will sell, each 4 gallons daily; and\r\nof the remaining 50 vendors, each will sell upon an average 10 gallons\r\ndaily. The first mentioned take 3_s._ daily; and the last 7_s._ 6_d._\r\nThis gives a street expenditure of 4,050_l._ during the winter season\r\nof five months.\r\n\r\nTo commence business in the street sale of pea-soup a capital is\r\nrequired after this rate: soup-kettle 4_s._; peas 2_s._; soup-ladle\r\n6_d._; pepper-box 1_d._; mint-box 3_d._; chafing-dish 6_d._; 12 basons\r\n1_s._; 12 spoons 1_s._; bones, celery, mint, carrots, and onions, 1_s._\r\n6_d._ In all 10_s._ 10_d._ The hot-eel trade being in conjunction with\r\nthe pea-soup, the same stall, candles, towels, sleeves, and aprons,\r\ndoes for both, and the quantity of extra coal and charcoal; pepper and\r\nsalt given in the summary of hot-eels serves in cooking, &c., both eels\r\nand pea-soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PICKLED WHELKS.\r\n\r\nThe trade in whelks is one of which the costermongers have the\r\nundisputed monopoly. The wholesale business is all transacted in\r\nBillingsgate, where this shell-fish is bought by the measure (a double\r\npeck or gallon), half-measure, or wash. A wash is four measures, and is\r\nthe most advantageous mode of purchase; “It’s so much cheaper by taking\r\nthat quantity,” I was told, “it’s as good as having a half-measure in.”\r\nAn average price for the year may be 4_s._ the wash; “But I’ve given\r\n21_s._ for three wash,” said one costermonger, and he waxed indignant\r\nas he spoke, “one Saturday, when there was a great stock in too, just\r\nbecause there was a fair coming on on Monday, and the whelkmen, who\r\nare the biggest rogues in Billingsgate, always have the price up then,\r\nand hinder a poor man doing good--they’ve a great knack of that.” A\r\nwash weighs about 60 lbs. On rare occasions it has been as low as 2_s._\r\n6_d._, and even 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nAbout one-half of the whelks are sold alive (wholesale), and the other\r\nhalf “cooked” (boiled), some of the salesmen having “convenience for\r\ncooking” near the market; but they are all brought to London alive,\r\n“or what should be alive.” When bought alive, which ensures a better\r\nquality, I was told--for “whelks’ll boil after they’re dead and gone,\r\nyou see, sir, as if they was alive and hungry”--the costermonger boils\r\nthem in the largest saucepan at his command for about ten minutes, and\r\nthen leaves them until they cool. “They never kicks as they boils,\r\nlike lobsters or crabs,” said one whelk dealer, “they takes it quiet.\r\nA missionary cove said to me, ‘Why don’t you kill them first? it’s\r\nmurder.’ _They_ doesn’t suffer; _I’ve_ suffered more with a toothach\r\nthan the whole of a measure of whelks has in a boiling, that I’m clear\r\nupon.” The boiling is generally the work of the women. The next process\r\nis to place them in a tub, throw boiling water over them, and stir them\r\nup for ten or fifteen minutes with a broom-handle. If the quantity be a\r\nwash, two broom-handles, usually wielded by the man and his wife, are\r\nemployed. This is both to clean them and “to make them come out easier\r\nto be wormed.” The “worming” is equivalent to the removing of the beard\r\nof an oyster or mussel. The whelks are wormed one by one. The operator\r\ncuts into the fish, rapidly draws out the “worm,” and pushes the\r\nsevered parts together, which closes. The small whelks are not wormed,\r\n“because it’s not reckoned necessary, and they’re sold to poor lads and\r\nsuch like, that’s not particular; but nearly all the women, and a good\r\nmany of the boys, are very particular. They think the worm’s poison.”\r\nThe whelks are next shaken in a tub, in cold water, and are then ready\r\nfor sale. The same process, after the mere boiling, is observed, when\r\nthe whelks are bought “cooked.”\r\n\r\nSome whelk-sellers, who wish to display a superior article, engage\r\nchildren for a few halfpence to rub the shell of every whelk, so that\r\nit looks clean and even bright.\r\n\r\nI find a difficulty, common in the course of this inquiry, of\r\nascertaining precisely the number of whelk-sellers, because the sale\r\nis often carried on simultaneously with that of other things, (stewed\r\neels, for instance,) and because it is common for costermongers to\r\nsell whelks on a Saturday night only, both at stalls and “round to the\r\npublic-houses,” but only when they are cheap at Billingsgate. On a\r\nSaturday night there may be 300 whelk-sellers in the streets, nearly\r\nhalf at stalls, and half, or more, “working the public-houses.” But\r\nof this number it must be understood that perhaps the wife is at the\r\nstall while the husband is on a round, and some whelks are sent out\r\nby a man having an extra stock. This, therefore, reduces the number\r\nof independent dealers, but not the actual number of sellers. On all\r\nother nights there may be half the number engaged in this traffic, in\r\nthe streets regularly all the year; and more than half on a Monday,\r\nas regards the public-house business, in which little is done between\r\nMonday and Saturday nights. But a man will, in some instances, work the\r\npublic-houses every night (the wife tending the stall), and the more\r\nassiduously if the weather be bad or foggy, when a public-house custom\r\nis the best. A fair week’s earnings in whelks, “when a man’s known,” is\r\n1_l._; a bad week is from 5_s._ to 8_s._ I am assured that bad weeks\r\nare “as plenty as good, at least, the year round;” and thus the average\r\nto the street whelk-sellers, in whelks alone, is about 13_s._ when the\r\ntrade is carried on daily and regularly, and 5_s._ a week by those who\r\noccasionally resort to it; and as the occasional hands are the more\r\nnumerous, the average may be struck at 7_s._\r\n\r\nThe whelks are sold at the stalls at two, three, four, six, and eight\r\na penny, according to size. Four is an average pennyworth for good\r\nwhelks; the six a penny are small, and the eight a penny very small.\r\nThe principal place for their sale is in Old-street, City-road. The\r\nother principal places are the street-markets, which I have before\r\nparticularised. The whelks are sold in saucers, generally small and\r\nwhite, and of common ware, and are contained in jars, ready to be\r\n“shelled” into any saucer that may have been emptied. Sometimes a\r\nsmall pyramid of shells, surmounted by a candle protected by a shade,\r\nattracts the regard of the passer-by. The man doing the best business\r\nin London was to be found, before the removals of which I have spoken,\r\nin Lambeth-walk, but he has now no fixed locality. His profits, I\r\nam informed, were regularly 3_l._ a week; but out of this he had to\r\npay for the assistance of two or sometimes three persons, in washing\r\nhis whelks, boiling them, &c.; besides that, his wife was as busy as\r\nhimself. To the quality and cleanliness of his whelks he was very\r\nattentive, and would sell no mediocre article if better could be\r\nbought. “He deserved all he earned, sir,” said another street-dealer\r\nto me; “why, in Old-street now they’ll have the old original saucers,\r\nmiserable things, such as they had fifty years back; but the man we’re\r\ntalking of, about two years ago, brought in very pretty plates, quite\r\nenterprising things, and they answered well. His example’s spreading,\r\nbut it’s slowly.” The whelks are eaten with vinegar and pepper.\r\n\r\nFor sale in the public-houses, the whelks are most frequently carried\r\nin jars, and transferred in a saucer to the consumer. “There’s often\r\na good sale,” said a man familiar with the business, “when a public\r\nroom’s filled. People drinking there always want to eat. They buy\r\nwhelks, not to fill themselves, but for a relish. A man that’s used to\r\nthe trade will often get off inferior sorts to the lushingtons; he’ll\r\nhave them to rights. Whelks is all the same, good, bad, or middling,\r\nwhen a man’s drinking, if they’re well seasoned with pepper and\r\nvinegar. Oh yes; any whelk-man will take in a drunken fellow, and he\r\nwill do it all the same, if he’s made up his mind to, get drunk hisself\r\nthat very night.”\r\n\r\nThe trade is carried on by the regular costers, but of the present\r\nnumber of whelk-sellers, about twenty have been mechanics or servants.\r\nThe whelk-trade is an evening trade, commencing generally about six,\r\nsummer and winter, or an hour earlier in winter.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start in the whelk-business is: stall,\r\n2_s._ 6_d._; saucers, vinegar-bottle, jar, pepper-castor, and small\r\nwatering-pan (used only in dusty weather), 2_s._ 6_d._; a pair of\r\nstilts (supports for the stall), 1_s._ 6_d._; stock-money, 5_s._;\r\npepper and vinegar, 6_d._, or 12_s._ in all. If the trade be commenced\r\nin a round basket, for public-house sale, 7_s._ or 8_s._ only is\r\nrequired, but it is a hazardous experiment for a person unpractised in\r\nstreet business.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CUSTOMERS, ETC., OF PICKLED WHELK-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man gave me the following account. He had been connected\r\nwith street-trading from his youth up, and is now about thirty:\r\n\r\n“The chief customers for whelks, sir, are working people and poor\r\npeople, and they prefer them to oysters; I do myself, and I think\r\nthey’re not so much eaten because they’re not fashionable like oysters.\r\nBut I’ve sold them to first-rate public-houses, and to doctors’\r\nshops--more than other shops, I don’t know why--and to private houses.\r\nMasters have sent out their servant-maids to me for three or four\r\npenn’orths for supper. I’ve offered the maids a whelk, but they won’t\r\neat them in the street; I dare say they’re afraid their young men\r\nmay be about, and might think they wasn’t ladies if they eat whelks\r\nin the street. Boys are the best customers for ‘small,’ but if you\r\ndon’t look sharp, you’ll be done out of three-ha’porth of vinegar to\r\na ha’porth of whelks. I can’t make out why they like it so. They’re\r\nparticular enough in their way. If the whelks are thin, as they will\r\nbe sometimes, the lads will say, ‘What a lot of snails you’ve gathered\r\nto-night!’ If they’re plump and fine, then they’ll say, ‘Fat ’uns\r\nto-night--stunners!’ Some people eat whelks for an appetite; they give\r\nme one, and more in summer than winter. The women of the town are\r\ngood customers, at least they are in the Cut and Shoreditch, for I\r\nknow both. If they have five-penn’orth, when they’re treated perhaps,\r\nthere’s always sixpence. They come on the sly sometimes, by themselves,\r\nand make what’s a meal, I’m satisfied, on whelks, and they’ll want\r\ncredit sometimes. I’ve given trust to a woman of that sort as far\r\nas 2_s._ 6_d._ I’ve lost very little by them; I don’t know how much\r\naltogether. I keep no account, but carry any credit in my head. Those\r\nwomen’s good pay, take it altogether, for they know how hard it is to\r\nget a crust, and have a feeling for a poor man, if they haven’t for a\r\nrich one--that’s my opinion, sir. Costermongers in a good time are\r\ncapital customers; they’ll buy five or six penn’orths at a time. The\r\ndust’s a great injury to the trade in summer time; it dries the whelks\r\nup, and they look old. I wish whelks were cheaper at Billingsgate, and\r\nI could do more business; and I could do more if I could sell a few\r\nminutes after twelve on a Saturday night, when people must leave the\r\npublic-house. I have sold three wash of a Saturday night, and cleared\r\n15_s._ on them. I one week made 3_l._, but I had a few stewed eels\r\nto help,--that is, I cleared 2_l._, and had a pound’s worth over on\r\nthe Saturday night, and sent them to be sold--and they were sold--at\r\nBattersea on the Sunday; I never went there myself. I’ve had twenty\r\npeople round my stall at one time on a Saturday. Perhaps my earnings\r\non that (and other odd things) may come to 1_l._ a week, or hardly\r\nso much, the year round. I can’t say exactly. The shells are no use.\r\nBoys have asked me for them ‘to make sea-shells of,’ they say--to hold\r\nthem to their ears when they’re big, and there’s a sound like the sea\r\nrolling. Gentlemen have sometimes told me to keep a dozen dozen or\r\ntwenty dozen, for borders to a garden. I make no charge for them--just\r\nwhat a gentleman may please to give.”\r\n\r\nThe information given shows an outlay of 5,250_l._ yearly for street\r\nwhelks, and as the return I have cited shows the money spent in whelks\r\nat Billingsgate to be 2,500_l._, the number of whelks being 4,950,000,\r\nthe account is correct, as the coster’s usual “half-profits” make up\r\nthe sum expended.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SELLERS, AND OF THE PREPARATION OF FRIED FISH.\r\n\r\nAmong the cooked food which has for many years formed a portion of the\r\nstreet trade is fried fish. The sellers are about 350, as a maximum\r\nand 250 as a minimum, 300 being an average number. The reason of the\r\nvariation in number is, that on a Saturday night, and occasionally on\r\nother nights, especially on Mondays, stall-keepers sell fried fish,\r\nand not as an ordinary article of their trade. Some men, too, resort\r\nto the trade for a time, when they cannot be employed in any way more\r\nprofitable or suitable to them. The dealers in this article are, for\r\nthe most part, old men and boys, though there may be 30 or 40 women\r\nwho sell it, but only 3 or 4 girls, and they are the daughters of the\r\nmen in the business as the women are the wives. Among the fried-fish\r\nsellers there are not half a dozen Irish people, although fish is so\r\nespecial a part of the diet of the poor Irish. The men in the calling\r\nhave been, as regards the great majority, mechanics or servants; none,\r\nI was told, had been fishmongers, or their assistants.\r\n\r\nThe fish fried by street dealers is known as “plaice dabs” and “sole\r\ndabs,” which are merely plaice and soles, “dab” being a common word\r\nfor any flat fish. The fish which supplies upwards of one half the\r\nquantity fried for the streets is plaice; the other fishes used are\r\nsoles, haddocks, whitings, flounders, and herrings, but very sparingly\r\nindeed as regards herrings. Soles are used in as large a quantity as\r\nthe other kinds mentioned altogether. On my inquiry as to the precise\r\nquantity of each description fried, the answer from the traders was\r\nuniform: “I can’t say, sir. I buy whatever’s cheapest.” The fish is\r\nbought at Billingsgate, but some of the street dealers obtain another\r\nand even a cheaper commodity than at that great mart. This supply is\r\nknown in the trade as “friers,” and consists of the overplus of a\r\nfishmonger’s stock, of what he has not sold overnight, and does not\r\ncare to offer for sale on the following morning, and therefore vends\r\nit to the costermongers, whose customers are chiefly among the poor.\r\nThe friers are sometimes half, and sometimes more than half, of the\r\nwholesale price in Billingsgate. Many of the friers are good, but some,\r\nI was told, “in any thing like muggy or close weather were very queer\r\nfish, very queer indeed,” and they are consequently fried with a most\r\nliberal allowance of oil, “which will conceal anything.”\r\n\r\nThe fish to be fried is first washed and gutted; the fins, head, and\r\ntail are then cut off, and the trunk is dipped in flour and water, so\r\nthat in frying, oil being always used, the skin will not be scorched by\r\nthe, perhaps, too violent action of the fire, but merely browned. Pale\r\nrape oil is generally used. The sellers, however, are often twitted\r\nwith using lamp oil, even when it is dearer than that devoted to the\r\npurpose. The fish is cooked in ordinary frying-pans. One tradesman in\r\nCripplegate, formerly a costermonger, has on his premises a commodious\r\noven which he had built for the frying, or rather baking, of fish.\r\nHe supplies the small shopkeepers who deal in the article (although\r\nsome prepare it themselves), and sells his fish retail also, but the\r\nstreet-sellers buy little of him, as they are nearly all “their own\r\ncooks.” Some of the “illegitimates,” however, lay in their stock by\r\npurchase of the tradesman in question. The fish is cut into portions\r\nbefore it is fried, and the frying occupies about ten minutes. The\r\nquantity prepared together is from six to twenty portions, according to\r\nthe size of the pans; four dozen portions, or “pieces,” as the street\r\npeople call them, require a quart of oil.\r\n\r\nThe fried fish-sellers live in some out of the way alley, and not\r\nunfrequently in garrets; for among even the poorest class there are\r\ngreat objections to their being fellow-lodgers, on account of the odour\r\nfrom the frying. Even when the fish is fresh (as it most frequently\r\nis), and the oil pure, the odour is rank. In one place I visited, which\r\nwas, moreover, admirable for cleanliness, it was very rank. The cooks,\r\nhowever, whether husbands or wives--for the women often attend to the\r\npan--when they hear of this disagreeable rankness, answer that it\r\nmay be so, many people say so; but for their parts they cannot smell\r\nit at all. The garments of the fried-fish sellers are more strongly\r\nimpregnated with the smell of fish than were those of any “wet” or\r\nother fish-sellers whom I met with. Their residences are in some of\r\nthe labyrinths of courts and alleys that run from Gray’s-inn-lane to\r\nLeather-lane, and similar places between Fetter and Chancery-lanes.\r\nThey are to be found, too, in the courts running from Cow-cross,\r\nSmithfield; and from Turnmill-street and Ray-street, Clerkenwell; also,\r\nin the alleys about Bishopsgate-street and the Kingsland-road, and some\r\nin the half-ruinous buildings near the Southwark and Borough-roads.\r\nNone, or very few, of those who are their own cooks, reside at a\r\ngreater distance than three miles from Billingsgate. A gin-drinking\r\nneighbourhood, one coster said, suits best, “for people hasn’t their\r\nsmell so correct there.”\r\n\r\nThe sale is both on rounds and at stalls, the itinerants being twice\r\nas numerous as the stationary. The round is usually from public-house\r\nto public-house, in populous neighbourhoods. The itinerants generally\r\nconfine themselves to the trade in fried fish, but the stall-keepers\r\nalways sell other articles, generally fish of some kind, along with it.\r\nThe sale in the public-houses is the greatest.\r\n\r\nAt the neighbouring races and fairs there is a great sale of fried\r\nfish. At last Epsom races, I was told, there were at least fifty\r\npurveyors of that dainty from London, half of them perhaps being\r\ncostermongers, who speculated in it merely for the occasion, preparing\r\nit themselves. Three men joined in one speculation, expending 8_l._ in\r\nfish, and did well, selling at the usual profit of cent. per cent.,\r\nbut with the drawback of considerable expenses. Their customers at the\r\nraces and fairs are the boys who hold horses or brush clothes, or who\r\nsell oranges or nuts, or push at roundabouts, and the costers who are\r\nthere on business. At Epsom races there was plenty of bread, I was\r\ninformed, to be picked up on the ground; it had been flung from the\r\ncarriages after luncheon, and this, with a piece of fish, supplied a\r\nmeal or “a relish” to hundreds.\r\n\r\nIn the public-houses, a slice of bread, 16 or 32 being cut from a\r\nquartern loaf--as they are whole or half slices--is sold or offered\r\nwith the fish for a penny. The cry of the seller is, “fish and bread,\r\na penny.” Sometimes for an extra-sized piece, with bread, 2_d._ is\r\nobtained, but very seldom, and sometimes two pieces are given for\r\n1-1/2_d._ At the stalls bread is rarely sold with the edible in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAKED POTATO MAN.\r\n\r\n“Baked ’taturs! All ’ot, all ’ot!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nFor the itinerant trade, a neatly painted wooden tray, slung by a\r\nleathern strap from the neck, is used: the tray is papered over\r\ngenerally with clean newspapers, and on the paper is spread the\r\nshapeless brown lumps of fish. Parsley is often strewn over them, and a\r\nsalt-box is placed at the discretion of the customer. The trays contain\r\nfrom two to five dozen pieces. I understand that no one has a trade\r\ngreatly in advance of his fellows. The whole body complain of their\r\nearnings being far less than was the case four or five years back.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant fried fish-sellers, when pursuing their avocation, wear\r\ngenerally a jacket of cloth or fustian buttoned round them, but the\r\nrest of their attire is hidden by the white sleeves and apron some\r\nwear, or by the black calico sleeves and dark woollen aprons worn by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start properly in the business is:--frying-pan\r\n2_s._ (second-hand 9_d._); tray 2_s._ 6_d._ (second-hand 8_d._);\r\nsalt-box 6_d._ (second-hand 1_d._); and stock-money 5_s._--in all\r\n10_s._ A man has gone into the trade, however, with 1_s._, which he\r\nexpended in fish and oil, borrowed a frying-pan, borrowed an old\r\ntea-board, and so started on his venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A FRIED FISH-SELLER, AND OF THE CLASS OF CUSTOMERS.\r\n\r\nThe man who gave me the following information was well-looking, and\r\nmight be about 45 or 50. He was poorly dressed, but his old brown\r\nsurtout fitted him close and well, was jauntily buttoned up to his\r\nblack satin stock, worn, but of good quality; and, altogether, he\r\nhad what is understood among a class as “a _betterly_ appearance\r\nabout him.” His statement, as well as those of the other vendors of\r\nprovisions, is curious in its details of public-house vagaries:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the trade,” he said, “seventeen years. Before that, I\r\nwas a gentleman’s servant, and I married a servant-maid, and we had a\r\nfamily, and, on that account, couldn’t, either of us, get a situation,\r\nthough we’d good characters. I was out of employ for seven or eight\r\nmonths, and things was beginning to go to the pawn for a living; but at\r\nlast, when I gave up any hope of getting into a gentleman’s service, I\r\nraised 10_s._, and determined to try something else. I was persuaded,\r\nby a friend who kept a beer-shop, to sell oysters at his door. I took\r\nhis advice, and went to Billingsgate for the first time in my life,\r\nand bought a peck of oysters for 2_s._ 6_d._ I was dressed respectable\r\nthen--nothing like the mess and dirt I’m in now” [I may observe, that\r\nthere was no dirt about him]; “and so the salesman laid it on, but I\r\ngave him all he asked. I know a deal better now. I’d never been used\r\nto open oysters, and I couldn’t do it. I cut my fingers with the knife\r\nslipping all over them, and had to hire a man to open for me, or the\r\nblood from my cut fingers would have run upon the oysters. For all\r\nthat, I cleared 2_s._ 6_d._ on that peck, and I soon got up to the\r\ntrade, and did well; till, in two or three months, the season got over,\r\nand I was advised, by the same friend, to try fried fish. That suited\r\nme. I’ve lived in good families, where there was first-rate men-cooks,\r\nand I know what good cooking means. I bought a dozen plaice; I forget\r\nwhat I gave for them, but they were dearer then than now. For all that,\r\nI took between 11_s._ and 12_s._ the first night--it was Saturday--that\r\nI started; and I stuck to it, and took from 7_s._ to 10_s._ every\r\nnight, with more, of course, on Saturday, and it was half of it profit\r\nthen. I cleared a good mechanic’s earnings at that time--30_s._ a week\r\nand more. Soon after, I was told that, if agreeable, my wife could\r\nhave a stall with fried fish, opposite a wine-vaults just opened,\r\nand she made nearly half as much as I did on my rounds. I served the\r\npublic-houses, and soon got known. With some landlords I had the\r\nprivilege of the parlour, and tap-room, and bar, when other tradesmen\r\nhave been kept out. The landlords will say to me still: ‘_You_ can go\r\nin, Fishy.’ Somehow, I got the name of ‘Fishy’ then, and I’ve kept it\r\never since. There was hospitality in those days. I’ve gone into a room\r\nin a public-house, used by mechanics, and one of them has said: ‘I’ll\r\nstand fish round, gentlemen;’ and I’ve supplied fifteen penn’orths.\r\nPerhaps he was a stranger, such a sort of customer, that wanted to be\r\nagreeable. Now, it’s more likely I hear: ‘Jack, lend us a penny to\r\nbuy a bit of fried;’ and then Jack says: ‘You be d--d! here, lass,\r\nlet’s have another pint.’ The insults and difficulties I’ve had in\r\nthe public-house trade is dreadful. I once sold 16_d._ worth to three\r\nrough-looking fellows I’d never seen before, and they seemed hearty,\r\nand asked me to drink with them, so I took a pull; but they wouldn’t\r\npay me when I asked, and I waited a goodish bit before I did ask. I\r\nthought, at first, it was their fun, but I waited from four to seven,\r\nand I found it was no fun. I felt upset, and ran out and told the\r\npoliceman, but he said it was only a debt, and he couldn’t interfere.\r\nSo I ran to the station, but the head man there said the same, and told\r\nme I should hand over the fish with one hand, and hold out the other\r\nhand for my money. So I went back to the public-house, and asked for my\r\nmoney--and there was some mechanics that knew me there then--but I got\r\nnothing but ‘---- you’s!’ and one of ’em used most dreadful language.\r\nAt last, one of the mechanics said: ‘Muzzle him, Fishy, if he won’t\r\npay.’ He was far bigger than me, him that was one in debt; but my\r\nspirit was up, and I let go at him and gave him a bloody nose, and the\r\nnext hit I knocked him backwards, I’m sure I don’t know how, on to a\r\ntable; but I fell on him, and he clutched me by the coat-collar--I was\r\nrespectable dressed then--and half smothered me. He tore the back of my\r\ncoat, too, and I went home like Jim Crow. The pot-man and the others\r\nparted us, and they made the man give me 1_s._, and the waiter paid me\r\nthe other 4_d._, and said he’d take his chance to get it--but he never\r\ngot it. Another time I went into a bar, and there was a ball in the\r\nhouse, and one of the ball gents came down and gave my basket a kick\r\nwithout ever a word, and started the fish; and in a scuffle--he was a\r\nlittle fellow, but my master--I had this finger put out of joint--you\r\ncan see that, sir, still--and was in the hospital a week from an\r\ninjury to my leg; the tiblin bone was hurt, the doctors said” [the\r\ntibia.] “I’ve had my tray kicked over for a lark in a public-house,\r\nand a scramble for my fish, and all gone, and no help and no money\r\nfor me. The landlords always prevent such things, when they can, and\r\ninterfere for a poor man; but then it’s done sudden, and over in an\r\ninstant. That sort of thing wasn’t the worst. I once had some powdery\r\nstuff flung sudden over me at a parlour door. My fish fell off, for I\r\njumped, because I felt blinded, and what became of them I don’t know;\r\nbut I aimed at once for home--it was very late--and had to feel my way\r\nalmost like a blind man. I can’t tell what I suffered. I found it was\r\nsomething black, for I kept rubbing my face with my apron, and could\r\njust tell it came away black. I let myself in with my latch, and my\r\nwife was in bed, and I told her to get up and look at my face and get\r\nsome water, and she thought I was joking, as she was half asleep; but\r\nwhen she got up and got a light, and a glass, she screamed, and said I\r\nlooked such a shiny image; and so I did, as well as I could see, for\r\nit was black lead--such as they use for grates--that was flung on me.\r\nI washed it off, but it wasn’t easy, and my face was sore days after.\r\nI had a respectable coat on then, too, which was greatly spoiled, and\r\nno remedy at all. I don’t know who did it to me. I heard some one say:\r\n‘You’re served out beautiful.’ Its men that calls themselves gentlemen\r\nthat does such things. I know the style of them then--it was eight or\r\nten years ago; they’d heard of Lord ----, and his goings on. That way\r\nit’s better now, but worse, far, in the way of getting a living. I dare\r\nsay, if I had dressed in rough corderoys, I shouldn’t have been larked\r\nat so much, because they might have thought I was a regular coster, and\r\na fighter; but I don’t like that sort of thing--I like to be decent and\r\nrespectable, if I can.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the ‘fried’ trade ever since, except about three months\r\nthat I tried the sandwiches. I didn’t do so well in them, but it\r\nwas a far easier trade; no carrying heavy weights all the way from\r\nBillingsgate: but I went back to the fried. Why now, sir, a good week\r\nwith me--and I’ve only myself in the trade now” [he was a widower]--“is\r\nto earn 12_s._, a poor week is 9_s._; and there’s as many of one as of\r\nthe other. I’m known to sell the best of fish, and to cook it in the\r\nbest style. I think half of us, take it round and round for a year,\r\nmay earn as much as I do, and the other half about half as much. I\r\nthink so. I might have saved money, but for a family. I’ve only one\r\nat home with me now, and he really _is_ a good lad. My customers are\r\npublic-house people that want a relish or a sort of supper with their\r\nbeer, not so much to drinkers. I sell to tradesmen, too; 4_d._ worth\r\nfor tea or supper. Some of them send to my place, for I’m known. The\r\nGreat Exhibition can’t be any difference to me. I’ve a regular round.\r\nI used to sell a good deal to women of the town, but I don’t now. They\r\nhaven’t the money, I believe. Where I took 10_s._ of them, eight or\r\nten years ago, I now take only 6_d._ They may go for other sorts of\r\nrelishes now; I can’t say. The worst of my trade is, that people must\r\nhave as big penn’orths when fish is dear as when its cheap. I never\r\nsold a piece of fish to an Italian boy in my life, though they’re\r\nCatholics. Indeed, I never saw an Italian boy spend a halfpenny in the\r\nstreets on anything.”\r\n\r\nA working-man told me that he often bought fried fish, and accounted it\r\na good to men like himself. He was fond of fried fish to his supper;\r\nhe couldn’t buy half so cheap as the street-sellers, perhaps not a\r\nquarter; and, if he could, it would cost him 1_d._ for dripping to fry\r\nthe fish in, and he got it ready, and well fried, and generally good,\r\nfor 1_d._\r\n\r\nSubsequent inquiries satisfied me that my informant was correct as\r\nto his calculations of his fellows’ earnings, judging from his own.\r\nThe price of plaice at Billingsgate is from 1/2_d._ to 2_d._ each,\r\naccording to size (the fried fish purveyors never calculate by the\r\nweight), 3/4_d._ being a fair average. A plaice costing 1_d._ will now\r\nbe fried into four pieces, each 1_d._; but the addition of bread, cost\r\nof oil, &c., reduces the “fried” peoples’ profits to rather less than\r\ncent. per cent. Soles and the other fish are, moreover, 30 per cent.\r\ndearer than plaice. As 150 sellers make as much weekly as my informant,\r\nand the other 150 half that amount, we have an average yearly earning\r\nof 27_l._ 6_s._ in one case, and of 13_l._ 13_s._ in the other. Taking\r\nonly 20_l._ a year as a medium earning, and adding 90 per cent. for\r\nprofit, the outlay on the fried fish supplied by London street-sellers\r\nis 11,400_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PREPARATION AND QUANTITY OF SHEEP’S TROTTERS, AND OF THE\r\nSTREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of sheep’s trotters, as a regular street-trade, is confined\r\nto London, Liverpool, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and a few more of our greater\r\ntowns. The “trotter,” as it is commonly called, is the boiled foot of\r\nthe sheep. None of my readers can have formed any commensurate notion\r\nof the extent of the sale in London, and to some readers the very\r\nexistence of such a comestible may be unknown. The great supply now\r\nrequired is readily attained. The wholesale trade is now in the hands\r\nof one fellmongering firm, though until within these twenty months\r\nor so there were two, and the feet are cut off the sheep-skins by\r\nthe salesmen in the skin-market, in Bermondsey, and conveyed to the\r\nfellmonger’s premises in carts and in trucks.\r\n\r\nSheep’s trotters, one of my informants could remember, were sold in the\r\nstreets fifty years ago, but in such small quantities that it could\r\nhardly be called a trade. Instead of being prepared wholesale as at\r\npresent, and then sold out to the retailers, the trotters were then\r\nprepared by the individual retailers, or by small traders in tripe\r\nand cow-heel. Twenty-five years ago nearly all the sheep’s trotters\r\nwere “lined and prepared,” when the skin came into the hands of the\r\nfellmonger, for the glue and size makers. Twenty years ago only about\r\none-twentieth of the trotters now prepared for eating were devoted to\r\nthe same purpose; and it was not until about fifteen years back that\r\nthe trade began to reach its present magnitude; and for the last twelve\r\nyears it has been about stationary, but there were never more sold than\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nFrom fifteen to twenty years ago glue and size, owing principally to\r\nimproved modes of manufacture, became cheaper, so that it paid the\r\nfellmonger better to dispose of the trotters as an article “cooked” for\r\nthe poor, than to the glue-boiler.\r\n\r\nThe process of cookery is carried on rapidly at the fellmonger’s in\r\nquestion. The feet are first scalded for about half an hour. After\r\nthat from ten to fifteen boys are employed in scooping out the hoofs,\r\nwhich are sold for manure or to manufacturers of Prussian blue, which\r\nis extensively used by painters. Women are then employed, forty\r\nbeing an average number, “to scrape the hair off,”--for hair it is\r\ncalled--quickly, but softly, so that the skin should not be injured,\r\nand after that the trotters are boiled for about four hours, and they\r\nare then ready for market.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of this establishment, after he had obligingly given\r\nme the information I required, invited me to walk round his premises\r\nunaccompanied, and observe how the business was conducted. The premises\r\nare extensive, and are situated, as are nearly all branches of the\r\ngreat trade connected with hides and skins, in Bermondsey. The trotter\r\nbusiness is kept distinct from the general fellmongering. Within a long\r\nshed are five coppers, each containing, on an average, 250 “sets,”\r\na set being the complement of the sheep’s feet, four. Two of these\r\ncoppers, on my visit, were devoted to the scalding, and three to the\r\nboiling of the trotters. They looked like what one might imagine to be\r\nwitches’ big caldrons; seething, hissing, boiling, and throwing forth\r\na steam not peculiarly grateful to the nostrils of the uninitiated.\r\nThus there are, weekly, “cooking” in one form or other, the feet of\r\n20,000 sheep for the consumption of the poorer classes, or as a relish\r\nfor those whose stomachs crave after edibles of this description. At\r\none extremity of this shed are the boys, who work in a place open at\r\nthe side, but the flues and fires make all parts sufficiently warm.\r\nThe women have a place to themselves on the opposite side of the\r\nyard. The room where they work has forms running along its sides, and\r\neach woman has a sort of bench in front of her seat, on which she\r\nscrapes the trotters. One of the best of these workwomen can scrape\r\n150 sets, or 600 feet in a day, but the average of the work is 500\r\nsets a week, including women and girls. I saw no girls but what seemed\r\nabove seventeen or eighteen, and none of the women were old. They were\r\nexceedingly merry, laughing and chatting, and appearing to consider\r\nthat a listener was not of primary consequence, as they talked pretty\r\nmuch altogether. I saw none but what were decently dressed, some were\r\ngood-looking, and none seemed sickly.\r\n\r\nIn this establishment are prepared, weekly, 20,000 sets, or 80,000\r\nfeet; a yearly average of 4,160,000 trotters, or the feet of 1,040,000\r\nsheep. Of this quantity the street-folk buy seven-eighths; 3,640,000\r\ntrotters yearly, or 70,000 weekly. The number of sheep trotter-sellers\r\nmay be taken at 300, which gives an average of nearly sixty sets a week\r\nper individual.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price, at the “trotter yard,” is five a penny, which\r\ngives an outlay by the street-sellers of 3,033_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ yearly.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole of the trade. Lamb’s trotters are also\r\nprepared, but only to one-twentieth of the quantity of sheep’s\r\ntrotters, and that for only three months of the year. These are all\r\nsold to the street-sellers. The lamb’s foot is usually left appended\r\nto the leg and shoulder of lamb. It is weighed with the joint, but\r\nthe butcher’s man or boy will say to the purchaser: “Do you want the\r\nfoot?” As the answer is usually in the negative, it is at once cut off\r\nand forms a “perquisite.” There are some half dozen men, journeymen\r\nbutchers not fully employed, who collect these feet, prepare and sell\r\nthem to the street-people, but as the lamb’s feet are very seldom as\r\nfresh as those of the sheep carried direct from the skin market to--so\r\nto speak--the great trotter kitchen, the demand for “lamb’s” falls off\r\nyearly. Last year the sale may be taken at about 14,000 sets, selling,\r\nwholesale, at about 46_l._, the same price as the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of trotters, who are stationary at publichouse and theatre\r\ndoors, and at street corners, and itinerant, but itinerant chiefly from\r\none public house to another are a wretchedly poor class. Three fourths\r\nof them are elderly women and children, the great majority being Irish\r\npeople, and there are more boys than girls in the trade. The capital\r\nrequired to start in the business is very small. A hand basket of the\r\nlarger size costs 1_s._ 9_d._, but smaller or second-hand only 1_s._,\r\nand the white cotton cloth on which the trotters are displayed costs\r\n4_d._ or 6_d._; stock-money need not exceed 1_s._, so that 3_s._\r\nis all that is required. This is one reason, I heard from several\r\ntrotter-sellers, why the business is over-peopled.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS OF SHEEP’S TROTTER WOMEN.\r\n\r\nFrom one woman, who, I am assured, may be taken as a fair type of the\r\nbetter class of trotter-sellers--some of the women being sottish and\r\naddicted to penn’orths of gin beyond their means--I had the following\r\nstatement. I found her in the top room of a lofty house in Clerkenwell.\r\nShe was washing when I called, and her son, a crippled boy of 16, with\r\nhis crutch by his side, was cleaning knives, which he had done for many\r\nmonths for a family in the neighbourhood, who paid for his labour in\r\nwhat the mother pronounced better than money--broken victuals, because\r\nthey were of such good, wholesome quality. The room, which is of a\r\ngood size, had its red-brown plaster walls, stained in parts with damp,\r\nbut a great portion was covered with the cheap engravings “given away\r\nwith No. 6” (or any other number) of some periodical “of thrilling\r\ninterest;” while the narrow mantel-shelf was almost covered with\r\npot figures of dumpy men, red-breeched and blue-coated, and similar\r\nornaments. I have often noted such attempts to subdue, as it were, the\r\ngrimness of poverty, by the poor who had “seen better days.” The mother\r\nwas tall and spare, and the boy had that look of premature sedateness,\r\nhis face being of a sickly hue, common to those of quiet dispositions,\r\nwho have been afflicted from their childhood:--\r\n\r\n“I’m the widow of a sawyer, sir,” said Mrs. ----, with a very slight\r\nbrogue, for she was an Irishwoman, “and I’ve been a widow 18 long\r\nyears. I’m 54, I believe, but that 18 years seems longer than all\r\nthe rest of my life together. My husband earned hardly ever less\r\nthan 30_s._ a week, sometimes 3_l._, and I didn’t know what pinching\r\nwas. But I was left destitute with four young children, and had to\r\nbring them up as well as I could, by what I could make by washing\r\nand charing, and a hard fight it was. One of my children went for a\r\nsoldier, one’s dead, another’s married, and that’s the youngest there.\r\nAh! poor fellow, what he’s gone through! He’s had 18 abscesses, one\r\nafter another, and he has been four times in Bartholomew’s. There’s\r\nonly God above to help him when I’m gone. My health broke six years\r\nago, and I couldn’t do hard work in washing, and I took to trotter\r\nselling, because one of my neighbours was in that way, and told me how\r\nto go about it. My son sells trotters too; he always sits at the corner\r\nof this street. I go from one public-house to another, and sometimes\r\nstand at the door, or sit inside, because I’m known and have leave. But\r\nI can’t either sit, or stand, or walk long at a time, I’m so rheumatic.\r\nNo, sir, I can’t say I was ever badly insulted in a public-house; but\r\nI only go to those I know. Others may be different. We depend mostly\r\non trotters, but I have a shilling and my meat, for charing, a day in\r\nevery week. I’ve tried ’winks and whelks too, ’cause I thought they\r\nmight be more in my pocket than trotters, but they don’t suit a poor\r\nwoman that’s begun a street-trade when she’s not very young. And the\r\ntrotters can be carried on with so little money. It’s not so long\r\nago that I’ve sold three-penn’orth of trotters--that is, him and me\r\nhas--pretty early in the evening; I’d bought them at Mr. ----’s, in\r\nBermondsey, in the afternoon, for we can buy three penn’orth, and I\r\nwalked there again--perhaps it’s four miles there and back--and bought\r\nanother 3_d._ worth. The first three-pence was all I could rise. It’s a\r\nlong weary way for me to walk, but some walk from Poplar and Limehouse.\r\nIf I lay out 2_s._ on the Saturday--there’s 15 sets for 1_s._, that’s\r\n60 trotters--they’ll carry us on to Monday night, and sometimes, if\r\nthey’ll keep, to Tuesday night. Sometimes I could sell half-a-crown’s\r\nworth in less time. I have to go to Bermondsey three or four times\r\na week. The trade was far better six years ago, though trotters were\r\ndearer then, only 13 sets 1_s._, then 14, now 15. For some very few,\r\nthat’s very fine and very big, I get a penny a piece; for some I get\r\n1-1/2_d._ for two; the most’s 1/2_d._ each; some’s four for 1-1/2_d._;\r\nand some I have to throw into the dust-hole. The two of us earns\r\n5_s._ a week on trotters, not more, I’m sure. I sell to people in the\r\npublic-houses; some of them may be rather the worse for drink, but not\r\nso many; regular drunkards buys nothing but drink. I’ve sold them too\r\nto steady, respectable gentlemen, that’s been passing in the street,\r\nwho put them in their pockets for supper. My rent’s 1_s._ a week.”\r\n\r\nI then had some conversation with the poor lad. He’d had many a bitter\r\nnight, he told me, from half-past five to twelve, for he knew there was\r\nno breakfast for his mother and him if he couldn’t sell some trotters.\r\nHe had a cry sometimes. He didn’t know any good it did him, but he\r\ncouldn’t help it. The boys gathered round him sometimes, and teased\r\nhim, and snatched at his crutch; and the policeman said that he must\r\nmake him “move on,” as he encouraged the boys about him. He didn’t like\r\nthe boys any more than they were fond of the policemen. He had often\r\nsad thoughts as he sat with his trotters before him, when he didn’t\r\ncry; he wondered if ever he would be better off; but what could he do?\r\nHe could read, but not write; he liked to read very well when he had\r\nanything to read. His mother and he never missed mass.\r\n\r\nAnother old woman, very poorly, but rather tidily dressed, gave me the\r\nfollowing account, which shows a little of public-house custom:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen better days, sir, I have indeed; I don’t like to talk about\r\nthat, but now I’m only a poor sheep’s trotter seller, and I’ve been one\r\na good many years. I don’t know how long, and I don’t like to think\r\nabout it. It’s a shocking bad trade, and such insults as we have to\r\nput up with. I serve some public-houses, and I stand sometimes at a\r\nplayhouse-door. I make 3_s._ or 3_s._ 6_d._ a week, and in a very good\r\nweek 4_s._, but, then, I sometimes make only 2_s._ I’m infirm now, God\r\nhelp me! and I can do nothing else. Another old woman and me has a room\r\nbetween us, at 1_s._ 4_d._ a week. Mother’s the best name I’m called in\r\na public-house, and it ain’t a respectable name. ‘Here, mother, give us\r\none of your b-- trotters,’ is often said to me. One customer sometimes\r\nsays: ‘The stuff’ll choke me, but that’s as good as the Union.’\r\n_He_ ain’t a bad man, though. He sometimes treats me. He’ll bait my\r\ntrotters, but that’s his larking way, and then he’ll say:\r\n\r\n  ‘A pennorth o’ gin,\r\n  ’ll make your old body spin.’\r\n\r\nIt’s his own poetry, he says. I don’t know what he is, but he’s often\r\ndrunk, poor fellow. Women’s far worse to please than men. I’ve known\r\na woman buy a trotter, put her teeth into it, and then say it wasn’t\r\ngood, and return it. It wasn’t paid for when she did so, and because\r\nI grumbled, I was abused by her, as if I’d been a Turk. The landlord\r\ninterfered, and he said, said he, ‘I’ll not have this poor woman\r\ninsulted; she’s here for the convenience of them as requires trotters,\r\nand she’s a well-conducted woman, and I’ll not have her insulted,’ he\r\nsays, says he, lofty and like a gentleman, sir. ‘Why, who’s insulting\r\nthe old b--h?’ says the woman, says she. ‘Why, you are,’ says the\r\nlandlord, says he, ‘and you ought to pay her for her trotter, or how is\r\nshe to live?’ ‘What the b-- h--ll do I care how she lives,’ says the\r\nwoman, ‘its nothing to me, and I won’t pay her.’ ‘Then I will,’ says\r\nthe landlord, says he, ‘here’s 6_d._,’ and he wouldn’t take the change.\r\nAfter that I soon sold all my trotters, and some gave me double price,\r\nwhen the landlord showed himself such a gentleman, and I went out and\r\nbought nine trotters more, another woman’s stock, that she was dreading\r\nshe couldn’t sell, and I got through them in no time. It was the best\r\ntrotter night I ever had. She wasn’t a woman of the town as used me so.\r\nI have had worse sauce from modest women, as they called themselves,\r\nthan from the women of the town, for plenty of _them_ knows what\r\npoverty is, and is civiler, poor things--yes, I’m sure of that, though\r\nit’s a shocking life--O, shocking! I never go to the playhouse-door but\r\non a fine night. Young men treats their sweethearts to a trotter, for\r\na relish, with a drop of beer between the acts. Wet nights is the best\r\nfor public-houses. ‘They’re not salt enough,’ has been said to me, oft\r\nenough, ‘they don’t make a man thirsty.’ It’ll come to the workhouse\r\nwith me before long, and, perhaps, all the better. It’s warm in the\r\npublic-house, and that draws me to sell my trotters there sometimes. I\r\nlive on fish and bread a good deal.”\r\n\r\nThe returns I collected show that there is expended yearly in London\r\nstreets on trotters, calculating their sale, retail, at 1/2_d._ each,\r\n6,500_l._, but though the regular price is 1/2_d._, some trotters are\r\nsold at four for 1-1/2_d._, very few higher than 1/2_d._, and some are\r\nkept until they are unsaleable, so that the amount may be estimated\r\nat 6,000_l._, a receipt of 7_s._ 6_d._ weekly, per individual seller,\r\nrather more than one-half of which sum is profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET TRADE IN BAKED POTATOES.\r\n\r\nThe _baked potato trade_, in the way it is at present carried on, has\r\nnot been known more than fifteen years in the streets. Before that,\r\npotatoes were sometimes roasted as chestnuts are now, but only on a\r\nsmall scale. The trade is more profitable than that in fruit, but\r\ncontinues for but six months of the year.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes, for street-consumption, are bought of the greengrocers,\r\nat the rate of 5_s._ 6_d._ the cwt. They are usually a large-sized\r\n“fruit,” running about two or three to the pound. The kind generally\r\nbought is what are called the “French Regent’s.” French potatoes\r\nare greatly used now, as they are cheaper than the English. The\r\npotatoes are picked, and those of a large size, and with a rough skin,\r\nselected from the others, because they are the mealiest. A waxy potato\r\nshrivels in the baking. There are usually from 280 to 300 potatoes in\r\nthe cwt.; these are cleaned by the huckster, and, when dried, taken\r\nin baskets, about a quarter cwt. at a time, to the baker’s, to be\r\ncooked. They are baked in large tins, and require an hour and a half\r\nto do them well. The charge for baking is 9_d._ the cwt., the baker\r\nusually finding the tins. They are taken home from the bakehouse in\r\na basket, with a yard and a half of green baize in which they are\r\ncovered up, and so protected from the cold. The huckster then places\r\nthem in his can, which consists of a tin with a half-lid; it stands\r\non four legs, and has a large handle to it, while an iron fire-pot is\r\nsuspended immediately beneath the vessel which is used for holding\r\nthe potatoes. Directly over the fire-pot is a boiler for hot water.\r\nThis is concealed within the vessel, and serves to keep the potatoes\r\nalways hot. Outside the vessel where the potatoes are kept is, at\r\none end, a small compartment for butter and salt, and at the other\r\nend another compartment for fresh charcoal. Above the boiler, and\r\nbeside the lid, is a small pipe for carrying off the steam. These\r\npotato-cans are sometimes brightly polished, sometimes painted red,\r\nand occasionally brass-mounted. Some of the handsomest are all brass,\r\nand some are highly ornamented with brass-mountings. Great pride is\r\ntaken in the cans. The baked-potato man usually devotes half an hour to\r\npolishing them up, and they are mostly kept as bright as silver. The\r\nhandsomest potato-can is now in Shoreditch. It cost ten guineas, and\r\nis of brass mounted with German silver. There are three lamps attached\r\nto it, with coloured glass, and of a style to accord with that of the\r\nmachine; each lamp cost 5_s._ The expense of an ordinary can, tin and\r\nbrass-mounted, is about 50_s._ They are mostly made by a tinman in\r\nthe Ratcliffe-highway. The usual places for these cans to stand are\r\nthe principal thoroughfares and street-markets. It is considered by\r\none who has been many years at the business, that there are, taking\r\nthose who have regular stands and those who are travelling with their\r\ncans on their arm, at least two hundred individuals engaged in the\r\ntrade in London. There are three at the bottom of Farringdon-street,\r\ntwo in Smithfield, and three in Tottenham-court-road (the two places\r\nlast named are said to be the best ‘pitches’ in all London), two in\r\nLeather-lane, one on Holborn-hill, one at King’s-cross, three at the\r\nBrill, Somers-town, three in the New-cut, three in Covent-garden (this\r\nis considered to be on market-days the second-best pitch), two at\r\nthe Elephant and Castle, one at Westminster-bridge, two at the top\r\nof Edgeware-road, one in St. Martin’s-lane, one in Newport-market,\r\ntwo at the upper end of Oxford-street, one in Clare-market, two in\r\nRegent-street, one in Newgate-market, two at the Angel, Islington,\r\nthree at Shoreditch church, four about Rosemary-lane, two at\r\nWhitechapel, two near Spitalfields-market, and more than double the\r\nabove number wandering about London. Some of the cans have names--as\r\nthe “Royal Union Jack” (engraved in a brass plate), the “Royal George,”\r\nthe “Prince of Wales,” the “Original Baked Potatoes,” and the “_Old_\r\nOriginal Baked Potatoes.”\r\n\r\nThe business begins about the middle of August and continues to the\r\nlatter end of April, or as soon as the potatoes get to any size,--until\r\nthey are pronounced ‘bad.’ The season, upon an average, lasts about\r\nhalf the year, and depends much upon the weather. If it is cold and\r\nfrosty, the trade is brisker than in wet weather; indeed then little\r\nis doing. The best hours for business are from half-past ten in the\r\nmorning till two in the afternoon, and from five in the evening till\r\neleven or twelve at night. The night trade is considered the best. In\r\ncold weather the potatoes are frequently bought to warm the hands.\r\nIndeed, an eminent divine classed them, in a public speech, among\r\nthe best of modern improvements, it being a cheap luxury to the poor\r\nwayfarer, who was benumbed in the night by cold, and an excellent\r\nmedium for diffusing warmth into the system, by being held in the\r\ngloved hand. Some buy them in the morning for lunch and some for\r\ndinner. A newsvender, who had to take a hasty meal in his shop, told me\r\nhe was “always glad to hear the baked-potato cry, as it made a dinner\r\nof what was only a snack without it.” The best time at night, is about\r\nnine, when the potatoes are purchased for supper.\r\n\r\nThe customers consist of all classes. Many gentlefolks buy them in\r\nthe street, and take them home for supper in their pockets; but the\r\nworking classes are the greatest purchasers. Many boys and girls lay\r\nout a halfpenny in a baked potato. Irishmen are particularly fond of\r\nthem, but they are the worst customers, I am told, as they want the\r\nlargest potatoes in the can. Women buy a great number of those sold.\r\nSome take them home, and some eat them in the street. Three baked\r\npotatoes are as much as will satisfy the stoutest appetite. One potato\r\ndealer in Smithfield is said to sell about 2-1/2 cwt. of potatoes on a\r\nmarket-day; or, in other words, from 900 to 1,000 potatoes, and to take\r\nupwards of 2_l._ One informant told me that he himself had often sold\r\n1-1/2 cwt. of a day, and taken 1_l._ in halfpence. I am informed, that\r\nupon an average, taking the good stands with the bad ones throughout\r\nLondon, there are about 1 cwt. of potatoes sold by each baked-potato\r\nman--and there are 200 of these throughout the metropolis--making\r\nthe total quantity of baked potatoes consumed every day 10 tons. The\r\nmoney spent upon these comes to within a few shillings of 125_l._\r\n(calculating 300 potatoes to the cwt., and each of those potatoes to\r\nbe sold at a halfpenny). Hence, there are 60 tons of baked potatoes\r\neaten in London streets, and 750_l._ spent upon them every week\r\nduring the season. Saturdays and Mondays are the best days for the\r\nsale of baked potatoes in those parts of London that are not near the\r\nmarkets; but in those in the vicinity of Clare, Newport, Covent-garden,\r\nNewgate, Smithfield, and other markets, the trade is briskest on\r\nthe market-days. The baked-potato men are many of them broken-down\r\ntradesmen. Many are labourers who find a difficulty of obtaining\r\nemployment in the winter time; some are costermongers; some have been\r\nartisans; indeed, there are some of all classes among them.\r\n\r\nAfter the baked potato season is over, the generality of the hucksters\r\ntake to selling strawberries, raspberries, or anything in season. Some\r\ngo to labouring work. One of my informants, who had been a bricklayer’s\r\nlabourer, said that after the season he always looked out for work\r\namong the bricklayers, and this kept him employed until the baked\r\npotato season came round again.\r\n\r\n“When I first took to it,” he said, “I was very badly off. My master\r\nhad no employment for me, and my brother was ill, and so was my\r\nwife’s sister, and I had no way of keeping ’em, or myself either. The\r\nlabouring men are mostly out of work in the winter time, so I spoke\r\nto a friend of mine, and he told me how he managed every winter, and\r\nadvised me to do the same. I took to it, and have stuck to it ever\r\nsince. The trade was much better then. I could buy a hundred-weight\r\nof potatoes for 1_s._ 9_d._ to 2_s._ 3_d._, and there were fewer to\r\nsell them. We generally use to a cwt. of potatoes three-quarters of a\r\npound of butter--tenpenny salt butter is what we buy--a pennyworth of\r\nsalt, a pennyworth of pepper, and five pennyworth of charcoal. This,\r\nwith the baking, 9_d._, brings the expenses to just upon 7_s._ 6_d._\r\nper cwt., and for this our receipts will be 12_s._ 6_d._, thus leaving\r\nabout 5_s._ per cwt. profit.” Hence the average profits of the trade\r\nare about 30_s._ a week--“and more to some,” said my informant. A man\r\nin Smithfield-market, I am credibly informed, clears at the least 3_l._\r\na week. On the Friday he has a fresh basket of hot potatoes brought to\r\nhim from the baker’s every quarter of an hour. Such is his custom that\r\nhe has not even time to take money, and his wife stands by his side to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nAnother potato-vender who shifted his can, he said, “from a\r\npublic-house where the tap dined at twelve,” to another half-a-mile\r\noff, where it “dined at one, and so did the parlour,” and afterwards\r\nto any place he deemed best, gave me the following account of his\r\ncustomers:--\r\n\r\n“Such a day as this, sir [Jan. 24], when the fog’s like a cloud come\r\ndown, people looks very shy at my taties, very; they’ve been more\r\nsuspicious ever since the taty rot. I thought I should never have\r\nrekivered it; never, not the rot. I sell most to mechanics--I was a\r\ngrocer’s porter myself before I was a baked taty--for their dinners,\r\nand they’re on for good shops where I serves the taps and parlours,\r\nand pays me without grumbling, like gentlemen. Gentlemen does grumble\r\nthough, for I’ve sold to them at private houses when they’ve held the\r\ndoor half open as they’ve called me--aye, and ladies too--and they’ve\r\nsaid, ‘Is _that_ all for 2_d._?’ If it’d been a peck they’d have said\r\nthe same, I know. Some customers is very pleasant with me, and says\r\nI’m a blessing. One always says he’ll give me a ton of taties when his\r\nship comes home, ’cause he can always have a hot murphy to his cold\r\nsaveloy, when tin’s short. He’s a harness-maker, and the railways has\r\ninjured him. There’s Union-street and there’s Pearl-row, and there’s\r\nMarket-street, now,--they’re all off the Borough-road--if I go there\r\nat ten at night or so, I can sell 3_s._ worth, perhaps, ’cause they\r\nknow me, and I have another baked taty to help there sometimes. They’re\r\nwomen that’s not reckoned the best in the world that buys there, but\r\nthey pay me. I know why I got my name up. I had luck to have good fruit\r\nwhen the rot was about, and they got to know me. I only go twice or\r\nthrice a week, for it’s two miles from my regular places. I’ve trusted\r\nthem sometimes. They’ve said to me, as modest as could be, ‘Do give me\r\ncredit, and ’pon my word you shall be paid; there’s a dear!’ I am paid\r\nmostly. Little shopkeepers is fair customers, but I do best for the\r\ntaps and the parlours. Perhaps I make 12_s._ or 15_s._ a week--I hardly\r\nknow, for I’ve only myself and keep no ’count--for the season; money\r\ngoes one can’t tell how, and ’specially if you drinks a drop, as I do\r\nsometimes. Foggy weather drives me to it, I’m so worritted; that is,\r\nnow and then, you’ll mind, sir.”\r\n\r\nThere are, at present, 300 vendors of hot baked potatoes getting their\r\nliving in the streets of London, each of whom sell, upon an average,\r\n3/4 cwt. of potatoes daily. The average takings of each vendor is 6_s._\r\na day; and the receipts of the whole number throughout the season\r\n(which lasts from the latter end of September till March inclusive), a\r\nperiod of 6 months, is 14,000_l._\r\n\r\nA capital is required to start in this trade, as follows:--can, 2_l._;\r\nknife, 3_d._; stock-money, 8_s._; charge for baking 100 potatoes,\r\n1_s._; charcoal, 4_d._; butter, 2_d._; salt, 1_d._, and pepper, 1_d._;\r\naltogether, 2_l._ 9_s._ 11_d._ The can and knife is the only property\r\ndescribed as fixed, stock-money, &c., being daily occurring, amounts to\r\n75_l._ during the season.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “TROTTING,” OR “HAWKING” BUTCHERS.\r\n\r\nThese two appellations are, or have been, used somewhat confusedly in\r\nthe meat trade. Thirty, or forty, or fifty years ago--for each term was\r\nmentioned to me--the butcher in question was a man who went “trotting”\r\non his small horse to the more distant suburbs to sell meat. This was\r\nwhen the suburbs, in any direction, were “not built up to” as they are\r\nnow, and the appearance of the trotting butcher might be hailed as\r\nsaving a walk of a mile, or a mile and a half, to a butcher’s shop,\r\nfor only tradesmen of a smaller capital then opened butcher’s shops in\r\nthe remoter suburbs. For a suburban butcher to send round “for orders”\r\nat that period would have occupied too much time, for a distance must\r\nbe traversed; and to have gone, or sent, on horseback, would have\r\nentailed the keeping or hiring of a horse which was in those days an\r\nexpensive matter. One butcher who told me that he had known the trade,\r\nman and boy, for nearly fifty years, said: “As to ‘trotting,’ a small\r\nman couldn’t so well do it, for if 20_l._ was offered for a tidy horse\r\nin the war time it would most likely be said, ‘I’ll get more for it in\r\nthe cavaldry--for it was often called cavaldry then--there’s better\r\nplunder there.’ (_Plunder_, I may explain, is a common word in the\r\nhorse trade to express _profit_.) So it wasn’t so easy to get a horse.”\r\nThe trotting butchers were then men sent or going out from the more\r\nfrequented parts to supply the suburbs, but in many cases only when a\r\ntradesman was “hung up” with meat. They carried from 20 to 100 lb. of\r\nmeat generally in one basket, resting on the pommel of the saddle, and\r\nattached by a long leathern strap to the person of the “trotter.” The\r\ntrade, however, was irregular and, considering the expenses, little\r\nremunerative; neither was it extensive, but what might be the extent\r\nI could not ascertain. There then sprung up the class of butchers--or\r\nrather the class became greatly multiplied--who sent their boys or\r\nmen on fast trotting horses to take orders from the dwellers in the\r\nsuburbs, and even in the streets, not suburbs, which were away from\r\nthe shop thoroughfares, and afterwards to deliver the orders--still\r\ntravelling on horseback--at the customer’s door. This system still\r\ncontinues, but to nothing like its former extent, and as it does\r\nnot pertain especially to the street-trade I need not dwell upon it\r\nat present, nor on the competition that sprung up as to “trotting\r\nbutcher’s ponies,”--in the “matching” of which “against time” sporting\r\nmen have taken great interest.\r\n\r\nOf “trotting” butchers, keeping their own horses, there are now none,\r\nbut there are still, I am told, about six of the class who contrive, by\r\nhiring, or more frequently borrowing, horses of some friendly butcher,\r\nto live by trotting. These men are all known, and all call upon known\r\ncustomers--often those whom they have served in their prosperity, for\r\nthe trotting butcher is a “reduced” man--and are not likely to be\r\nsucceeded by any in the same line, or--as I heard it called--“ride” of\r\nbusiness. These traders not subsisting exactly upon street traffic,\r\nor on any adventure depending upon door by door, or street by street,\r\ncommerce, but upon a _connection_ remaining from their having been in\r\nbusiness on their own accounts, need no further mention.\r\n\r\nThe present class of street-traders in raw meat are known to the trade\r\nas “hawking” butchers, and they are as thoroughly street-sellers as\r\nare the game and poultry “hawkers.” Their number, I am assured, is\r\nnever less than 150, and sometimes 200 or even 250. They have all\r\nbeen butchers, or journeymen butchers, and are broken down in the one\r\ncase, or unable to obtain work in the other. They then “watch the\r\nturn of the markets,” as small meat “jobbers,” and--as on the Stock\r\nExchange--“invest,” when they account the market at the lowest. The\r\nmeat so purchased is hawked in a large basket carried on the shoulders,\r\nif of a weight too great to be sustained in a basket on the arm. The\r\nsale is confined almost entirely to public-houses, and those at no\r\ngreat distance from the great meat marts of Newgate, Leadenhall, and\r\nWhitechapel. The hawkers do not go to the suburbs. Their principal\r\ntrade is in pork and veal,--for those joints weigh lighter, and present\r\na larger surface in comparison with the weight, than do beef or mutton.\r\nThe same may be said of lamb; but of that they do not buy one quarter\r\nso much as of pork or veal.\r\n\r\nThe hawking butcher bought his meat last year at from 2-1/2_d._ to\r\n5-1/2_d._ the pound, according to kind and quality. He seldom gave\r\n6_d._, even years ago, when meat was dearer; for it is difficult--I\r\nwas told by one of these hawkers--to get more than 6_d._ per lb. from\r\nchance customers, no matter what the market price. “If I ask 7-1/2_d._\r\nor 7_d._,” he said, “I’m sure of one answer--‘Nonsense!’ I never goes\r\nno higher nor 6_d._” Sometimes--and especially if he can command credit\r\nfor two or three days--the hawking butcher will buy the whole carcass\r\nof a sheep. If he reside near the market, he may “cut it up” in his own\r\nroom; but he can generally find the necessary accommodation at some\r\nfriendly butcher’s block. If the weather be “bad for keeping,” he will\r\ndispose of a portion of the carcass to his brother-hawkers; if cold,\r\nhe will persevere in hawking the whole himself. He usually, however,\r\nbuys only a hind or fore-quarter of mutton, or other meat, except\r\nbeef, which he buys by the joint, and more sparingly than he buys any\r\nother animal food. The hawker generally has his joints weighed before\r\nhe starts, and can remember the exact pounds and ounces of each, but\r\nthe purchasers generally weigh them before payment; or, as one hawker\r\nexpressed it, “They goes to the scales before they come to the tin.”\r\n\r\nMany of these hawkers drink hard, and, being often men of robust\r\nconstitution, until the approach of age, can live “hard,”--as regards\r\nlodging, especially. One hawker I heard of slept in a slaughter-house,\r\non the bare but clean floor, for nearly two years: “But that was seven\r\nyears ago, and no butcher would allow it now.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A HAWKING BUTCHER.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged man, the front of his head being nearly bald, and the\r\nfew hairs there were to be seen shining strongly and lying flat, as if\r\nrubbed with suet or dripping, gave me the following account. He was\r\ndressed in the usual blue garb of the butcher:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve hawked, sir--well, perhaps for fifteen years. My father was a\r\njourneyman butcher, and I helped him, and so grew up to it. I never\r\nhad to call regular work, and made it out with hawking. Perhaps I’ve\r\nhawked, take it altogether, nearly three quarters of every year. The\r\nother times I’ve had a turn at slaughtering. But I haven’t slaughtered\r\nfor these three or four years; I’ve had turns as a butcher’s porter,\r\nand wish I had more, as it’s sure browns, if it’s only 1_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nday: but there’s often a bit of cuttings. I sell most pork of anything\r\nin autumn and winter, and most mutton in summer; but the summer\r\nisn’t much more than half as good as the winter for my trade. When I\r\nslaughtered I had 3_s._ for an ox, 4_d._ for a sheep, and 1_s._ for\r\na pig. Calves is slaughtered by the master’s people generally. Well,\r\nI dare say it _is_ cruel the way they slaughter calves; you would\r\nthink it so, no doubt. I believe they slaughter cheaper now. If I buy\r\ncheap--and on a very hot day and a slow market, I have bought a fore,\r\naye, and a hind, quarter of mutton, about two and a half stone each\r\n(8 lbs. to the stone), at 2_d._ a pound; but that’s only very, very\r\nseldom--when I buy cheap sir, I aim at 2_d._ a pound over what I give,\r\nif not so cheap at 1_d._, and then its low to my customers. But I cut\r\nup the meat, you see, myself, and I carry it. I sell eight times as\r\nmuch to public-houses and eating-houses as anywhere else; most to the\r\npublics if they’ve ordinaries, and a deal for the publics’ families’\r\neating, ’cause a landlord knows I wouldn’t deceive _him_,--and there’s\r\na part of it taken out in drink, of course, and landlords is good\r\njudges. Trade was far better years back. I’ve heard my father and his\r\npals talk about a hawking butcher that twenty years ago was imprisoned\r\nfalsely, and got a honest lawyer to bring his haction, and had 150_l._\r\ndamages for false imprisonment. It was in the Lord Mayor’s Court of\r\nEquity, I’ve heard. It was a wrong arrest. I don’t understand the\r\nparticulars of it, but it’s true; and the damages was for loss of time\r\nand trade. I’m no lawyer myself; not a bit. I have sold the like of a\r\nloin of mutton, when it was small, in a tap-room, to make chops for the\r\npeople there. They’ll cook chops and steaks for a pint of beer, at a\r\npublic; that is, you must order a pint--but I’ve sold it very seldom.\r\nWhen mutton was dearer it was easier to sell it that way, for I sold\r\ncheap; and at one public the mechanics--I hardly know just what they\r\nwas, something about building--used to gather there at one o’clock and\r\nwait for ‘Giblets’; so they called me there. I live a good bit on the\r\ncuttings of the meat I hawk, or I chop a meal off if I can manage or\r\nafford it, or my wife--(I’ve only a wife and she earns never less than\r\n2_s._ a week in washing for a master butcher--I wish I was a master\r\nbutcher,--and that covers the rent)--my wife makes it into broth.\r\nTake it all the year round, I s’pose I sell three stun a day (24 lb.),\r\nand at 1_d._ a pound profit. Not a farthing more go round and round. I\r\ndon’t think the others, altogether, do as much, for I’m known to a many\r\nlandlords. But some make 3_s._ and 4_s._ a day oft enough. I’ve made as\r\nmuch myself sometimes. We all aim at 1_d._ a pound profit, but have to\r\ntake less in hot weather sometimes. Last year 4_d._ the pound has been\r\na haverage price to me for all sorts.”\r\n\r\n“Dead salesmen,” as they are called--that is, the market salesmen\r\nof the meat sent so largely from Scotland and elsewhere, ready\r\nslaughtered--expressed to me their conviction that my informant’s\r\ncalculation was correct, and might be taken as an average; so did\r\nbutchers. Thus, then, we find that the hawking butchers, taking\r\ntheir number at 150, sell 747,000 lbs. of meat, producing 12,450_l._\r\nannually, one-fourth being profit; this gives an annual receipt of\r\n83_l._ each, and an annual earning of 20_l._ 15_s._ The capital\r\nrequired to start in this trade is about 20_s._, which is usually laid\r\nout as follows:--A basket for the shoulders, which costs 4_s._ 6_d._; a\r\nleathern strap, 1_s._; a basket for the arm, 2_s._ 6_d._; a butcher’s\r\nknife, 1_s._; a steel, 1_s._ 6_d._; a leather belt for the waist to\r\nwhich the knife is slung, 6_d._; a chopper, 1_s._ 6_d._; and a saw,\r\n2_s._; 6_s._ stock-money, though credit is sometimes given.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF HAM-SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\nThe ham-sandwich-seller carries his sandwiches on a tray or flat\r\nbasket, covered with a clean white cloth; he also wears a white apron,\r\nand white sleeves. His usual stand is at the doors of the theatres.\r\n\r\nThe trade was unknown until eleven years ago, when a man who had\r\nbeen unsuccessful in keeping a coffee-shop in Westminster, found it\r\nnecessary to look out for some mode of living, and he hit upon the plan\r\nof vending sandwiches, precisely in the present style, at the theatre\r\ndoors. The attempt was successful; the man soon took 10_s._ a night,\r\nhalf of which was profit. He “attended” both the great theatres, and\r\nwas “doing well;” but at five or six weeks’ end, competitors appeared\r\nin the field, and increased rapidly, and so his sale was affected,\r\npeople being regardless of his urging that he “was the original\r\nham-sandwich.” The capital required to start in the trade was small; a\r\nfew pounds of ham, a proportion of loaves, and a little mustard was all\r\nthat was required, and for this 10_s._ was ample. That sum, however,\r\ncould not be commanded by many who were anxious to deal in sandwiches;\r\nand the man who commenced the trade supplied them at 6_d._ a dozen, the\r\ncharge to the public being 1_d._ a-piece. Some of the men, however,\r\nmurmured, because they thought that what they thus bought were not\r\nequal to those the wholesale sandwich-man offered for sale himself; and\r\nhis wholesale trade fell off, until now, I am told, he has only two\r\ncustomers among street-sellers.\r\n\r\nHam sandwiches are made from any part of the bacon which may be\r\nsufficiently lean, such as “the gammon,” which now costs 4_d._ and\r\n5_d._ the pound. It is sometimes, but very rarely, picked up at\r\n3-1/2_d._ When the trade was first started, 7_d._ a pound was paid for\r\nthe ham, but the sandwiches are now much larger. To make three dozen a\r\npound of meat is required, and four quartern loaves. The “ham” may cost\r\n5_d._, the bread 1_s._ 8_d._ or 1_s._ 10_d._, and the mustard 1_d._ The\r\nproceeds for this would be 3_s._, but the trade is very precarious:\r\nlittle can be done in wet weather. If unsold, the sandwiches spoil, for\r\nthe bread gets dry, and the ham loses its fresh colour; so that those\r\nwho depend upon this trade are wretchedly poor. A first-rate week is\r\nto clear 10_s._; a good week is put at 7_s._; and a bad week at 3_s._\r\n6_d._ On some nights they do not sell a dozen sandwiches. There are\r\nhalfpenny sandwiches, but these are only half the size of those at a\r\npenny.\r\n\r\nThe persons carrying on this trade have been, for the most part, in\r\nsome kind of service--errand-boys, pot-boys, foot-boys (or pages), or\r\nlads engaged about inns. Some few have been mechanics. Their average\r\nweekly earnings hardly exceed 5_s._, but some “get odd jobs” at other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“There are now, sir, at the theatres this (the Strand) side the\r\nwater, and at Ashley’s, the Surrey, and the Vic., two dozen and nine\r\nsandwiches.” So said one of the trade, who counted up his brethren for\r\nme. This man calculated also that at the Standard, the saloons, the\r\nconcert-rooms, and at Limehouse, Mile-end, Bethnal-green-road, and\r\nelsewhere, there might be more than as many again as those “working”\r\nthe theatres--or 70 in all. They are nearly all men, and no boys or\r\ngirls are now in the trade. The number of these people, when the large\r\ntheatres were open with the others, was about double what it is now.\r\n\r\nThe information collected shows that the expenditure in ham-sandwiches,\r\nsupplied by street-sellers, is 1,820_l._ yearly, and a consumption of\r\n436,800 sandwiches.\r\n\r\nTo start in the ham-sandwich street-trade requires 2_s._ for a basket,\r\n2_s._ for kettle to boil ham in, 6_d._ for knife and fork, 2_d._ for\r\nmustard-pot and spoon, 7_d._ for 1/2 cwt. of coals, 5_s._ for ham,\r\n1_s._ 3_d._ for bread, 4_d._ for mustard, 9_d._ for basket, cloth, and\r\napron, 4_d._ for over-sleeves--or a capital of 12_s._ 11_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A HAM SANDWICH-SELLER.\r\n\r\nA young man gave me the following account. His look and manners were\r\nsubdued; and, though his dress was old and worn, it was clean and\r\nunpatched:--\r\n\r\n“I hardly remember my father, sir,” he said; “but I believe, if\r\nhe’d lived, I should have been better off. My mother couldn’t keep\r\nmy brother and me--he’s older than me--when we grew to be twelve or\r\nthirteen, and we had to shift for ourselves. She works at the stays,\r\nand now makes only 3_s._ a week, and we can’t help her. I was first\r\nin place as a sort of errand-boy, then I was a stationer’s boy, and\r\nthen a news agent’s boy. I wasn’t wanted any longer, but left with a\r\ngood character. My brother had gone into the sandwich trade--I hardly\r\nknow what made him--and he advised me to be a ham sandwich-man, and\r\nso I started as one. At first, I made 10_s._, and 7_s._, and 8_s._\r\na week--that’s seven years, or so--but things are worse now, and\r\nI make 3_s._ 6_d._ some weeks, and 5_s._ others, and 6_s._ is an\r\nout-and-outer. My rent’s 2_s._ a week, but I haven’t my own things. I\r\nam so sick of this life, I’d do anything to get out of it; but I don’t\r\nsee a way. Perhaps I might have been more careful when I was first\r\nin it; but, really, if you do make 10_s._ a week, you want shoes, or\r\na shirt--so what is 10_s._ after all? I wish I had it now, though. I\r\nused to buy my sandwiches at 6_d._ a dozen, but I found that wouldn’t\r\ndo; and now I buy and boil the stuff, and make them myself. What _did_\r\ncost 6_d._, now only costs me 4_d._ or 4-1/2_d._ I work the theatres\r\nthis side of the water, chiefly the ’Lympic and the ’Delphi. The best\r\ntheatre I ever had was the Garding, when it had two galleries, and was\r\ndramatic--the operas there wasn’t the least good to me. The Lyceum was\r\ngood, when it was Mr. Keeley’s. I hardly know what sort my customers\r\nare, but they’re those that go to theaytres: shopkeepers and clerks,\r\nI think. Gentlemen don’t often buy of me. They _have_ bought, though.\r\nOh, no, they never give a farthing over; they’re more likely to want\r\nseven for 6_d._ The women of the town buy of me, when it gets late, for\r\nthemselves and their fancy men. They’re liberal enough when they’ve\r\nmoney. They sometimes treat a poor fellow in a public-house. In summer\r\nI’m often out ’till four in the morning, and then must lie in bed half\r\nnext day. The ’Delphi was better than it is. I’ve taken 3_s._ at the\r\nfirst “turn out” (the leaving the theatre for a short time after the\r\nfirst piece), “but the turn-outs at the Garding was better than that.\r\nA penny pie-shop has spoiled us at the ’Delphi and at Ashley’s. I go\r\nout between eight and nine in the evening. People often want more in\r\nmy sandwiches, though I’m starving on them. ‘Oh,’ they’ll say, ‘you’ve\r\nbeen ’prenticed to Vauxhall, you have.’ ‘They’re 1_s._ there,’ says I,\r\n‘and no bigger. I haven’t Vauxhall prices.’ I stand by the night-houses\r\nwhen it’s late--not the fashionables. Their customers would’nt look\r\nat me; but I’ve known women, that carried their heads very high, glad\r\nto get a sandwich afterwards. Six times I’ve been upset by drunken\r\nfellows, on purpose, I’ve no doubt, and lost all my stock. Once, a\r\ngent. kicked my basket into the dirt, and he was going off--for it\r\nwas late--but some people by began to make remarks about using a poor\r\nfellow that way, so he paid for all, after he had them counted. I am\r\n_so_ sick of this life, sir. I _do_ dread the winter so. I’ve stood up\r\nto the ankles in snow till after midnight, and till I’ve wished I was\r\nsnow myself, and could melt like it and have an end. I’d do anything\r\nto get away from this, but I can’t. Passion Week’s another dreadful\r\ntime. It drives us to starve, just when we want to get up a little\r\nstock-money for Easter. I’ve been bilked by cabmen, who’ve taken a\r\nsandwich; but, instead of paying for it, have offered to fight me.\r\nThere’s no help. We’re knocked about sadly by the police. Time’s very\r\nheavy on my hands, sometimes, and that’s where you feel it. I read a\r\nbit, if I can get anything to read, for I was at St. Clement’s school;\r\nor I walk out to look for a job. On summer-days I sell a trotter or\r\ntwo. But mine’s a wretched life, and so is most ham sandwich-men. I’ve\r\nno enjoyment of my youth, and no comfort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir! I live very poorly. A ha’porth or a penn’orth of cheap\r\nfish, which I cook myself, is one of my treats--either herrings or\r\nplaice--with a ’tatur, perhaps. Then there’s a sort of meal, now and\r\nthen, off the odds and ends of the ham, such as isn’t quite viewy\r\nenough for the public, along with the odds and ends of the loaves. I\r\ncan’t boil a bit of greens with my ham, ’cause I’m afraid it might\r\nrather spoil the colour. I don’t slice the ham till it’s cold--it cuts\r\neasier, and is a better colour then, I think. I wash my aprons, and\r\nsleeves, and cloths myself, and iron them too. A man that sometimes\r\nmakes only 3_s._ 6_d._ a week, and sometimes less, and must pay 2_s._\r\nrent out of that, must look after every farthing. I’ve often walked\r\neight miles to see if I could find ham a halfpenny a pound cheaper\r\nanywhere. If it was tainted, I know it would be flung in my face. If I\r\nwas sick there’s only the parish for me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BREAD.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in bread is not so extensive as might be expected,\r\nfrom the universality of the consumption. It is confined to\r\nPetticoat-lane and the poorer districts in that neighbourhood. A person\r\nwho has known the East-end of town for nearly fifty years, told me\r\nthat as long as he could recollect, bread was sold in the streets,\r\nbut not to the present extent. In 1812 and 1813, when bread was the\r\ndearest, there was very little sold in the streets. At that time,\r\nand until 1815, the Assize Acts, regulating the bread-trade, were in\r\nforce, and had been in force in London since 1266. Previously to 1815\r\nbakers were restricted, by these Acts, to the baking of three kinds\r\nof bread--wheaten, standard wheaten, and household. The wheaten was\r\nmade of the best flour, the standard wheaten of the different kinds of\r\nflour mixed together, and the household of the coarser and commoner\r\nflour. In 1823, however, it was enacted that within the City of London\r\nand ten miles round, “it shall be lawful for the bakers to make and\r\nsell bread made of wheat, barley, rye, oats, buck-wheat, Indian-corn,\r\npeas, beans, rice, or potatoes, or any of them, along with common salt,\r\npure-water, eggs, milk, barm-leaven, potato, or other yeast, and mixed\r\nin such proportions as they shall think fit.” I mention this because\r\nmy informant, as well as an old master baker with whom I conversed on\r\nthe subject, remembered that every now and then, after 1823, but only\r\nfor two or three years, some speculative trader, both in shops and in\r\nthe streets, would endeavour to introduce an inferior, but still a\r\nwholesome, bread, to his customers, such as an admixture of barley with\r\nwheat-flour, but no one--as far as I could learn--persevered in the\r\nspeculation for more than a week or so. Their attempts were not only\r\nunsuccessful but they met with abuse, from street-buyers especially,\r\nfor endeavouring to palm off “brown” bread as “good enough for poor\r\npeople.” One of my elder informants remembered his father telling\r\nhim that in 1800 and 1801, George III. had set the example of eating\r\nbrown bread at his one o’clock dinner, but he was sometimes assailed\r\nas he passed in his carriage, with the reproachful epithet of “_Brown_\r\nGeorge.” This feeling continues, for the poor people, and even the more\r\nintelligent working-men, if cockneys, have still a notion that only\r\n“white” bread is fit for consumption. Into the question of the relative\r\nnutrition of breads, I shall enter when I treat of the bakers.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of about four months in the summer, there are from\r\ntwenty to thirty men daily selling stale bread. Of these only twelve\r\nsell it regularly every day of the year, and they trade chiefly on\r\ntheir own account. Of the others, some are sent out by their masters,\r\nreceiving from 1_s._ to 2_s._ for their labour. Those who sell on their\r\nown account, go round to the bakers’ shops about Stepney, Mile-end,\r\nand Whitechapel, and purchase the stale-bread on hand. It is sold to\r\nthem at 1/2_d._, 1_d._ and 1-1/2_d._ per quartern less than the retail\r\nshop price; but when the weather is very hot, and the bakers have a\r\nlarge quantity of stale-bread on hand, the street-sellers sometimes\r\nget the bread at 2_d._ a quartern less than the retail price. All the\r\nstreet-sellers of bread have been brought up as bakers. Some have\r\nresorted to the street-trade, I am told, when unable to procure work;\r\nothers because it is a less toilsome, and sometimes a more profitable\r\nmeans of subsistence, than the labour of an operative baker. It is very\r\nrarely that any of the street-traders leave their calling to resume\r\nworking as journeymen. Some of these traders have baskets containing\r\nthe bread offered for street-sale; others have barrows, and one has a\r\nbarrow resembling a costermonger’s, with a long basket made to fit upon\r\nit. The dress of these vendors is a light coat of cloth or fustian;\r\ncorduroy, fustian, or cloth trousers, and a cloth cap or a hat, the\r\nwhole attire being, what is best understood as “dusty,” ingrained as it\r\nis with flour.\r\n\r\nFrom one bread-seller, a middle-aged man, with the pale look and\r\nhabitual stoop of a journeyman baker, I had the following account:\r\n\r\n“I’ve known the street-trade a few years; I can’t say exactly how\r\nmany. I was a journeyman baker before that, and can’t say but what I\r\nhad pretty regular employment; but then, sir, what an employment it\r\nis! So much night-work, and the heat of the oven, with the close air,\r\nand sleeping on sacks at nights (for you can’t leave the place), so\r\nthat altogether it’s a slave’s life. A journeyman baker hasn’t what\r\ncan be called a home, for he’s so much away at the oven; he’d better\r\nnot be a married man, for if his wife isn’t very careful there’s talk,\r\nand there’s unhappiness about nothing perhaps. I can’t be thought to\r\nspeak feelingly that way though, for I’ve been fortunate in a wife.\r\nBut a journeyman baker’s life drives him to drink, almost whether he\r\nwill or not. A street life’s not quite so bad. I was out of work two\r\nor three weeks, and I certainly lushed too much, and can’t say as I\r\ntried very hard to get work, but I had a pound or two in hand, and\r\nthen I began to think I’d try and sell stale bread in the streets, for\r\nit’s a healthfuller trade than the other; so I started, and have been\r\nat it ever since, excepting when I work a few days, or weeks, for a\r\nmaster baker; but he’s a relation, and I assist him when he’s ill. My\r\ncustomers are all poor persons,--some in rags, and some as decent as\r\ntheir bad earnings’ll let them. No doubt about it, sir, there’s poor\r\nwomen buy of me that’s wives of mechanics working slop, and that’s\r\nforced to live on stale bread. Where there’s a family of children,\r\nstale bread goes so very much further. I think I sell to few but what\r\nhas families, for a quartern’s too much at a time for a single woman.\r\nI often hear my customers talk about their children, and say they must\r\nmake haste, as the poor things are hungry, and they couldn’t get them\r\nany bread sooner. O, it’s a hard fight to live, all Spitalfields and\r\nBethnal-green way, for I know it all. There are first the journeyman\r\nbakers over-worked and fretted into drinking, a-making the bread, and\r\nthere are the poor fellows in all sorts of trade over-worked to get\r\nmoney to buy it. I’ve had women that looked as if they was ‘reduced,’\r\ncome to me of an evening as soon as it was dusk, and buy stale bread,\r\nas if they was ashamed to be seen. Yes, I give credit. Some has a\r\nweek’s credit regular, and pays every Saturday night. I lose very\r\nlittle in trusting. I sometimes have bread over and sell it--rather\r\nthan hold it over to next day--for half what it cost me. I have given\r\nit away to begging people, sooner than keep it to be too stale, and\r\nthey would get something for it at a lodging-house. The lodging-house\r\nkeepers never buy of me that I know of. They can buy far cheaper than\r\nI can--you understand, sir. Perhaps, altogether, I make about a guinea\r\nevery week; wet weather and short days are against me. I don’t sell\r\nmore, I think, on a Saturday than on other nights. The nights are much\r\nof a muchness that way.”\r\n\r\nThe average quantity sold by each vendor during the summer months\r\nis 150 quarterns daily, usually at 4_d._, but occasionally at 3_d._\r\nthe quartern. One man informed me that he had sold in one day 350\r\nquarterns, receiving 5_l._ 16_s._ 8_d._ for them.\r\n\r\nThe number of men (for if there be women they are the men’s wives)\r\nengaged daily throughout the year in the street-sale of bread is 12.\r\nThese sell upon an average 100 quarterns each per day: taking every day\r\nin the year 1_l._ 12_s._ each (a few being sold at 3_d._)\r\n\r\nCalculating then the four months’ trade in summer at 150 quarterns per\r\nday per man, and reckoning 15 men so selling, and each receiving 45_s._\r\n(thus allowing for the threepenny sale); and taking the receipts of the\r\n12 regular traders at 1_l._ 12_s._ per day, we find nearly 9,000_l._\r\nannually expended in the street purchase of 700,000 quartern loaves\r\nof bread. The profits of the sellers vary from 1_l._ to 2_l._ a week,\r\naccording to the extent of their business.\r\n\r\nTo start in this branch of the street-trade a capital is required\r\naccording to the following rate:--Stock-money for bread, average 1_l._;\r\n(largest amount required, 5_l._; smallest, 10_s._); a basket, 4_s._\r\n6_d._ Of those who are employed in the summer, one-half have baskets,\r\nand the other half bakers’ barrows; while of those who attend the year\r\nthrough, 8 have baskets at 4_s._ 6_d._ each, 3 have barrows at 40_s._\r\neach, and one a barrow and the long basket, before mentioned. The\r\nbarrow costs 30_s._, and the basket 2_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF HOT GREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of hot green peas in the streets is of great antiquity, that\r\nis to say, if the cry of “hot peas-cod,” recorded by Lydgate (and\r\nformerly alluded to), may be taken as having intimated the sale of the\r\nsame article. In many parts of the country it is, or was, customary\r\nto have “_scaldings_ of peas,” often held as a sort of rustic feast.\r\nThe peas were not shelled, but boiled in the pod, and eaten by the\r\npod being dipped in melted butter, with a little pepper, salt, and\r\nvinegar, and then drawn through the teeth to extract the peas, the\r\npod being thrown away. The mention of _peas-cod_ (or pea-shell) by\r\nLydgate renders it probable that the “scalding” method was that then in\r\nuse in the streets. None of the street-sellers, however, whom I saw,\r\nremembered the peas being vended in any other form than shelled and\r\nboiled as at present.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of green peas have no stands, but carry a round or oval tin\r\npot or pan, with a swing handle; the pan being wrapped round with a\r\nthick cloth, to retain the heat. The peas are served out with a ladle,\r\nand eaten by the customers, if eaten in the street, out of basins,\r\nprovided with spoons, by the pea-man. Salt, vinegar, and pepper, are\r\napplied from the vendor’s store, at the customer’s discretion.\r\n\r\nThere are now four men carrying on this trade. They wear no particular\r\ndress, “just what clothes we can get,” said one of them. One, who has\r\nbeen in the trade twenty-five years, was formerly an inn-porter; the\r\nother three are ladies’ shoemakers in the day-time, and pea-sellers\r\nin the evening, or at early morning, in any market. Their average\r\nsale is three gallons daily, with a receipt of 7_s._ per man. Seven\r\ngallons a day is accounted a large sale; but the largest of all is at\r\nGreenwich fair, when each pea-man will take 35_s._ in a day. Each\r\nvendor has his district. One takes Billingsgate, Rosemary-lane, and its\r\nvicinity; another, the Old Clothes Exchange, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch,\r\nand Bethnal-green; a third, Mile-end and Stepney; and a fourth,\r\nRatcliffe-highway, Limehouse, and Poplar. Each man resides in his\r\n“round,” for the convenience of boiling his peas, and introducing them\r\nto his customers “hot and hot.”\r\n\r\nThe peas used in this traffic are all the dried field pea, but dried\r\ngreen and whole, and not split, or prepared, as are the yellow peas\r\nfor soup or puddings. They are purchased at the corn-chandlers’ or\r\nthe seed-shops, the price being 2_s._ the peck (or two gallons.) The\r\npeas are soaked before they are boiled, and swell considerably, so\r\nthat one gallon of the dried peas makes rather more than two gallons\r\nof the boiled. The hot green peas are sold in halfpennyworths; a\r\nhalfpennyworth being about a quarter of a pint. The cry of the sellers\r\nis, “Hot green peas! all hot, all hot! Here’s your peas hot, hot, hot!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A HOT GREEN PEA SELLER.\r\n\r\nThe most experienced man in the trade gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n“Come the 25th of March, sir, and I shall have been 26 years in the\r\nbusiness, for I started it on the 25th of March--it’s a day easy for\r\nto remember, ’cause everybody knows it’s quarter-day--in 1825. I was a\r\nporter in coaching-inns before; but there was a mishap, and I had to\r\ndrop it. I didn’t leave ’cause I thought the pea line might be better,\r\nbut because I must do something, and knew a man in the trade, and\r\nall about it. It was a capital trade then, and for a good many years\r\nafter I was in it. Many a day I’ve taken a guinea, and, sometimes,\r\n35_s._; and I have taken two guineas at Greenwich Fair, but then I\r\nworked till one or two in the morning from eleven the day before.\r\nMoney wasn’t so scarce then. Oh, sir, as to what my profit was or is,\r\nI never tell. I wouldn’t to my own wife; neither her that’s living nor\r\nher that’s dead.” [A person present intimated that the secret might be\r\nsafely confided to the dead wife, but the pea-seller shook his head.]\r\n“Now, one day with another, except Sundays, when I don’t work, I may\r\ntake 7_s._ I always use the dried peas. They pay better than fresh\r\ngarden-peas would at a groat a peck. People has asked for young green\r\npeas, but I’ve said that I didn’t have them. Billingsgate’s my best\r\nground. I sell to the costers, and the roughs, and all the parties that\r\nhas their dinners in the tap-rooms--they has a bit of steak, or a bit\r\nof cold meat they’ve brought with them. There’s very little fish eat\r\nin Billingsgate, except, perhaps, at the ord’n’ries (ordinaries). I’m\r\nlooked for as regular as dinner-time. The landlords tell me to give\r\nmy customers plenty of pepper and salt, to make them thirsty. I go on\r\nboard the Billingsgate ships, too, and sometimes sell 6_d._ worth to\r\ncaptain and crew. It’s a treat, after a rough voyage. Oh, no, sir, I\r\nnever go on board the Dutch eel-vessels. There’s nothing to be got out\r\nof scaly fur’ners (foreigners.) I sell to the herring, and mackarel,\r\nand oyster-boats, when they’re up. My great sale is in public-houses,\r\nbut I sometimes sell 2_d._ or 3_d._ worth to private houses. I go out\r\nmorning, noon, and night; and at night I go my round when people’s\r\nhaving a bite of supper, perhaps, in the public-houses. I sell to\r\nthe women of the town then. Yes, I give them credit. To-night, now\r\n(Saturday), I expect to receive 2_s._ 3_d._, or near on to it, that\r\nI’ve trusted them this week. They mostly pay me on a Saturday night.\r\nI lose very little by them. I’m knocked about in public-houses by the\r\nBillingsgate roughs, and I’ve been bilked by the prigs. I’ve known at\r\nleast six people try my trade, and fail in it, and I was glad to see\r\nthem broke. I sell twice as much in cold weather as in warm.”\r\n\r\nI ascertained that my informant sold three times as much as the\r\nother dealers, who confine their trade principally to an evening\r\nround. Reckoning that the chief man of business sells 3 gallons a day\r\n(which, at 1_d._ the quarter-pint, would be 8_s._, my informant said\r\n7_s._), and that the other three together sell the same quantity, we\r\nfind a street-expenditure on hot green peas of 250_l._ and a street\r\nconsumption of 1870 gallons. The peas, costing 2_s._ the two gallons,\r\nare vended for 4_s._ or 5_s._, at the least, as they boil into more\r\nthan double the quantity, and a gallon, retail, is 2_s._ 8_d._; but the\r\naddition of vinegar, pepper, &c., may reduce the profit to cent. per\r\ncent., while there is the heaping up of every measure retail to reduce\r\nthe profit. Thus, independent of any consideration as to the labour in\r\nboiling, &c. (generally done by the women), the principal man’s profit\r\nis 21_s._ a week; that of the others 7_s._ each weekly.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start in the business is--can, 2_s._ 6_d._;\r\nvinegar-bottle and pepper-box, 4_d._; saucers and spoons, 6_d._;\r\nstock-money, about 2_s._; cloth to wrap over the peas, 4_d._ (a vendor\r\nwearing out a cloth in three months); or an average of 9_s._ or 10_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF CATS’ AND DOGS’-MEAT DEALERS.\r\n\r\nThe supply of food for cats and dogs is far greater than may be\r\ngenerally thought. “Vy, sir,” said one of the dealers to me, “can you\r\ntell me ’ow many people’s in London?” On my replying, upwards of two\r\nmillions; “I don’t know nothing vatever,” said my informant, “about\r\nmillions, but I think there’s a cat to every ten people, aye, and more\r\nthan that; and so, sir, you can reckon.” [I told him this gave a total\r\nof 200,000 cats in London; but the number of inhabited houses in the\r\nmetropolis was 100,000 more than this, and though there was not a cat\r\nto every house, still, as many lodgers as well as householders kept\r\ncats, I added that I thought the total number of cats in London might\r\nbe taken at the same number as the inhabited houses, or 300,000 in\r\nall.] “There’s not near half so many dogs as cats. I must know, for\r\nthey all knows me, and I sarves about 200 cats and 70 dogs. Mine’s a\r\nmiddling trade, but some does far better. Some cats has a hap’orth a\r\nday, some every other day; werry few can afford a penn’orth, but times\r\nis inferior. Dogs is better pay when you’ve a connection among ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe cat and dogs’-meat dealers, or “carriers,” as they call themselves,\r\ngenerally purchase the meat at the knackers’ (horse-slaughterers’)\r\nyards. There are upwards of twenty of such yards in London; three or\r\nfour are in Whitechapel, one in Wandsworth, two in Cow-cross--one of\r\nthe two last mentioned is the largest establishment in London--and\r\nthere are two about Bermondsey. The proprietors of these yards purchase\r\nlive and dead horses. They contract for them with large firms, such\r\nas brewers, coal-merchants, and large cab and ’bus yards, giving so\r\nmuch per head for their old live and dead horses through the year. The\r\nprice varies from 2_l._ to 50_s._ the carcass. The knackers also have\r\ncontractors in the country (harness-makers and others), who bring or\r\nsend up to town for them the live and dead stock of those parts. The\r\ndead horses are brought to the yard--two or three upon one cart, and\r\nsometimes five. The live ones are tied to the tail of these carts,\r\nand behind the tail of each other. Occasionally a string of fourteen\r\nor fifteen are brought up, head to tail, at one time. The live horses\r\nare purchased merely for slaughtering. If among the lot bought there\r\nshould chance to be one that is young, but in bad condition, it is\r\nplaced in the stable, fed up, and then put into the knacker’s carts,\r\nor sold by them, or let on hire. Occasionally a fine horse has been\r\nrescued from death in this manner. One person is known to have bought\r\nan animal for 15_s._, for which he afterwards got 150_l._ Frequently\r\nyoung horses that will not work in cabs--such as “jibs”--are sold to\r\nthe horse-slaughterers as useless. They are kept in the yard, and\r\nafter being well fed, often turn out good horses. The live horses\r\nare slaughtered by the persons called “knackers.” These men get upon\r\nan average 4_s._ a day. They begin work at twelve at night, because\r\nsome of the flesh is required to be boiled before six in the morning;\r\nindeed, a great part of the meat is delivered to the carriers before\r\nthat hour. The horse to be slaughtered has his mane clipped as short\r\nas possible (on account of the hair, which is valuable). It is then\r\nblinded with a piece of old apron smothered in blood, so that it may\r\nnot see the slaughterman when about to strike. A pole-axe is used,\r\nand a cane, to put an immediate end to the animal’s sufferings. After\r\nthe animal is slaughtered, the hide is taken off, and the flesh cut\r\nfrom the bones in large pieces. These pieces are termed, according\r\nto the part from which they are cut, hind-quarters, fore-quarters,\r\ncram-bones, throats, necks, briskets, backs, ribs, kidney pieces,\r\nhearts, tongues, liver and lights. The bones (called “racks” by the\r\nknackers) are chopped up and boiled, in order to extract the fat,\r\nwhich is used for greasing common harness, and the wheels of carts\r\nand drags, &c. The bones themselves are sold for manure. The pieces\r\nof flesh are thrown into large coppers or pans, about nine feet in\r\ndiameter and four feet deep. Each of these pans will hold about three\r\ngood-sized horses. Sometimes two large brewers’ horses will fill them,\r\nand sometimes as many as four “poor” cab-horses may be put into them.\r\nThe flesh is boiled about an hour and 20 minutes for a “killed” horse,\r\nand from two hours to two hours and 20 minutes for a dead horse (a\r\nhorse dying from age or disease). The flesh, when boiled, is taken from\r\nthe coppers, laid on the stones, and sprinkled with water to cool it.\r\nIt is then weighed out in pieces of 112, 56, 28, 21, 14, 7, and 3-1/2\r\nlbs. weight. These are either taken round in a cart to the “carriers,”\r\nor, at about five, the carriers call at the yard to purchase, and\r\ncontinue doing so till twelve in the day. The price is 14_s._ per cwt.\r\nin winter, and 16_s._ in summer. The tripe is served out at 12 lb. for\r\n6_d._ All this is for cats and dogs. The carriers then take the meat\r\nround town, wherever their “walk” may lie. They sell it to the public\r\nat the rate of 2-1/2_d._ per lb., and in small pieces, on skewers, at\r\na farthing, a halfpenny, and a penny each. Some carriers will sell as\r\nmuch as a hundred-weight in a day, and about half a hundred-weight is\r\nthe average quantity disposed of by the carriers in London. Some sell\r\nmuch cheaper than others. These dealers will frequently knock at the\r\ndoors of persons whom they have seen served by another on the previous\r\nday, and show them that they can let them have a larger quantity of\r\nmeat for the same money. The class of persons belonging to the business\r\nare mostly those who have been unable to obtain employment at their\r\ntrade. Occasionally a person is bred to it, having been engaged as a\r\nlad by some carrier to go round with the barrow and assist him in his\r\nbusiness. These boys will, after a time, find a “walk” for themselves,\r\nbeginning first with a basket, and ultimately rising to a barrow. Many\r\nof the carriers give light weight to the extent of 2 oz. and 4 oz. in\r\nthe pound. At one yard alone near upon 100 carriers purchase meat, and\r\nthere are, upon an average, 150 horses slaughtered there every week.\r\nEach slaughter-house may be said to do, one with another, 60 horses per\r\nweek throughout the year, which, reckoning the London slaughter-houses\r\nat 12, gives a total of 720 horses killed every week in the metropolis,\r\nor, in round numbers, 37,500 in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe London cat and dogs’-meat carriers or sellers--nearly all\r\nmen--number at the least 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe slaughtermen are said to reap large fortunes very rapidly--indeed,\r\nthe carriers say they coin the money. Many of them retire after a few\r\nyears, and take large farms. One, after 12 years’ business, retired\r\nwith several thousand pounds, and has now three large farms. The\r\ncarriers are men, women, and boys. Very few women do as well as the men\r\nat it. The carriers “are generally sad drunkards.” Out of five hundred,\r\nit is said three hundred at least spend 1_l._ a head a week in drink.\r\nOne party in the trade told me that he knew a carrier who would often\r\nspend 10_s._ in liquor at one sitting. The profit the carriers make\r\nupon the meat is at present only a penny per pound. In the summer time\r\nthe profit per pound is reduced to a halfpenny, owing to the meat being\r\ndearer on account of its scarcity. The carriers give a great deal of\r\ncredit--indeed, they take but little ready money. On some days they do\r\nnot come home with more than 2_s._ One with a middling walk pays for\r\nhis meat 7_s._ 6_d._ per day. For this he has half a hundred-weight.\r\nThis produces him as much as 11_s._ 6_d._, so that his profit is 4_s._;\r\nwhich, I am assured, is about a fair average of the earnings of the\r\ntrade. One carrier is said to have amassed 1,000_l._ at the business.\r\nHe usually sold from 1-1/2 to 2 cwt. every morning, so that his profits\r\nwere generally from 16_s._ to 1_l._ per day. But the trade is much\r\nworse now. There are so many at it, they say, that there is barely a\r\nliving for any. A carrier assured me that he seldom went less than\r\n30, and frequently 40 miles, through the streets every day. The best\r\ndistricts are among the houses of tradesmen, mechanics, and labourers.\r\nThe coachmen in the mews at the back of the squares are very good\r\ncustomers. “The work lays thicker there,” said my informant. Old maids\r\nare bad, though very plentiful, customers. They cheapen the carriers\r\ndown so, that they can scarcely live at the business. “They will pay\r\none halfpenny and owe another, and forget that after a day or two.” The\r\ncats’ meat dealers generally complain of their losses from bad debts.\r\nTheir customers require credit frequently to the extent of 1_l._ “One\r\nparty owes me 15_s._ now,” said a carrier to me, “and many 10_s._; in\r\nfact, very few people pay ready money for the meat.”\r\n\r\nThe carriers frequently serve as much as ten pennyworths to one person\r\nin a day. One gentleman has as much as 4 lbs. of meat each morning for\r\ntwo Newfoundland dogs; and there was one woman--a black--who used to\r\nhave as much as 16 pennyworth every day. This person used to get out on\r\nthe roof of the house and throw it to the cats on the tiles. By this\r\nshe brought so many stray cats round about the neighbourhood, that\r\nthe parties in the vicinity complained; it was quite a nuisance. She\r\n_would_ have the meat always brought to her before ten in the morning,\r\nor else she would send to a shop for it, and between ten and eleven in\r\nthe morning the noise and cries of the hundreds of stray cats attracted\r\nto the spot was “terrible to hear.” When the meat was thrown to the\r\ncats on the roof, the riot, and confusion, and fighting, was beyond\r\ndescription. “A beer-shop man,” I was told, “was obliged to keep five\r\nor six dogs to drive the cats from his walls.” There was also a mad\r\nwoman in Islington, who used to have 14 lbs. of meat a day. The party\r\nwho supplied her had his money often at 2_l._ and 3_l._ at a time. She\r\nhad as many as thirty cats at times in her house. Every stray one that\r\ncame she would take in and support. The stench was so great that she\r\nwas obliged to be ejected. The best days for the cats’ meat business\r\nare Mondays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays. A double quantity of meat is sold\r\non the Saturday; and on that day and Monday and Tuesday the weekly\r\ncustomers generally pay.\r\n\r\n“My father was a baker by trade,” said a carrier to me, “but through\r\nan enlargement of the heart he was obliged to give up working at his\r\ntrade; leaning over the trough increased his complaint so severely,\r\nthat he used to fall down, and be obliged to be brought home. This made\r\nhim take to the cats’ and dogs’ meat trade, and he brought me up to it.\r\nI do pretty comfortably. I have a very good business, having been all\r\nmy life at it. If it wasn’t for the bad debts I should do much better;\r\nbut some of the people I trust leave the houses, and actually take in\r\na double quantity of meat the day before. I suppose there is at the\r\npresent moment as much as 20_l._ owing to me that I never expect to see\r\na farthing of.”\r\n\r\nThe generality of the dealers wear a shiny hat, black plush waistcoat\r\nand sleeves, a blue apron, corduroy trousers, and a blue and white\r\nspotted handkerchief round their necks. Some, indeed, will wear two and\r\nthree handkerchiefs round their necks, this being fashionable among\r\nthem. A great many meet every Friday afternoon in the donkey-market,\r\nSmithfield, and retire to a public-house adjoining, to spend the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nA “cats’ meat carrier” who supplied me with information was more\r\ncomfortably situated than any of the poorer classes that I have yet\r\nseen. He lived in the front room of a second floor, in an open and\r\nrespectable quarter of the town, and his lodgings were the perfection\r\nof comfort and cleanliness in an humble sphere. It was late in the\r\nevening when I reached the house. I found the “carrier” and his family\r\npreparing for supper. In a large morocco leather easy chair sat the\r\ncats’ meat carrier himself; his “blue apron and black shiny hat” had\r\ndisappeared, and he wore a “dress” coat and a black satin waistcoat\r\ninstead. His wife, who was a remarkably pretty woman, and of very\r\nattractive manners, wore a “Dolly Varden” cap, placed jauntily at\r\nthe back of her head, and a drab merino dress. The room was cosily\r\ncarpeted, and in one corner stood a mahogany “crib” with cane-work\r\nsides, in which one of the children was asleep. On the table was a\r\nclean white table-cloth, and the room was savoury with the steaks, and\r\nmashed potatoes that were cooking on the fire. Indeed, I have never\r\nyet seen greater comfort in the abodes of the poor. The cleanliness\r\nand wholesomeness of the apartment were the more striking from the\r\nunpleasant associations connected with the calling.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by one who has been engaged at the business for 25\r\nyears, that there are from 900 to 1,000 horses, averaging 2 cwt. of\r\nmeat each--little and big--boiled down every week; so that the quantity\r\nof cats’ and dogs’ meat used throughout London is about 200,000 lbs.\r\nper week, and this, sold at the rate of 2-1/2_d._ per lb., gives\r\n2,000_l._ a week for the money spent in cats’ and dogs’ meat, or\r\nupwards of 100,000_l._ a year, which is at the rate of 100_l._-worth\r\nsold annually by each carrier. The profits of the carriers may be\r\nestimated at about 50_l._ each per annum.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start in this business varies from 1_l._ to\r\n2_l._ The stock-money needed is between 5_s._ and 10_s._ The barrow and\r\nbasket, weights and scales, knife and steel, or black-stone, cost about\r\n2_l._ when new, and from 15_s._ to 4_s._ second-hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF DRINKABLES.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of the drinkables, who have now to be considered,\r\nbelong to the same class as I have described in treating of the sale\r\nof street-provisions generally. The buyers are not precisely of the\r\nsame class, for the street-eatables often supply a meal, but with the\r\nexception of the coffee-stalls, and occasionally of the rice-milk,\r\nthe drinkables are more of a luxury than a meal. Thus the buyers are\r\nchiefly those who have “a penny to spare,” rather than those who have\r\n“a penny to dine upon.” I have described the different classes of\r\npurchasers of each potable, and perhaps the accounts--as a picture\r\nof street-life--are even more curious than those I have given of the\r\npurchasers of the eatables--of (literally) the diners _out_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF COFFEE-STALL KEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThe vending of tea and coffee, in the streets, was little if at all\r\nknown twenty years ago, saloop being then the beverage supplied from\r\nstalls to the late and early wayfarers. Nor was it until after 1842\r\nthat the stalls approached to anything like their present number, which\r\nis said to be upwards of 300--the majority of the proprietors being\r\nwomen. Prior to 1824, coffee was in little demand, even among the\r\nsmaller tradesmen or farmers, but in that year the duty having been\r\nreduced from 1_s._ to 6_d._ per lb., the consumption throughout the\r\nkingdom in the next seven years was nearly trebled, the increase being\r\nfrom 7,933,041 lbs., in 1824, to 22,745,627 lbs., in 1831. In 1842, the\r\nduty on coffee, was fixed at 4_d._, from British possessions, and from\r\nforeign countries at 6_d._\r\n\r\nBut it was not owing solely to the reduced price of coffee, that the\r\nstreet-vendors of it increased in the year or two subsequent to 1842,\r\nat least 100 per cent. The great facilities then offered for a cheap\r\nadulteration, by mixing ground chicory with the ground coffee, was an\r\nenhancement of the profits, and a greater temptation to embark in the\r\nbusiness, as a smaller amount of capital would suffice. Within these\r\ntwo or three years, this cheapness has been still further promoted,\r\nby the medium of adulteration, the chicory itself being, in its turn,\r\nadulterated by the admixture of baked carrots, and the like saccharine\r\nroots, which, of course, are not subjected to any duty, while foreign\r\nchicory is charged 6_d._ per lb. English chicory is not chargeable\r\nwith duty, and is now cultivated, I am assured, to the yield of\r\nbetween 4,000 and 5,000 tons yearly, and this nearly all used in the\r\nadulteration of coffee. Nor is there greater culpability in this trade\r\namong street-venders, than among “respectable” shopkeepers; for I was\r\nassured, by a leading grocer, that he could not mention twenty shops in\r\nthe city, of which he could say: “You can go and buy a pound of ground\r\ncoffee there, and it will not be adulterated.” The revelations recently\r\nmade on this subject by the _Lancet_ are a still more convincing proof\r\nof the _general_ dishonesty of grocers.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-stall keepers generally stand at the corner of a street.\r\nIn the fruit and meat markets there are usually two or three\r\ncoffee-stalls, and one or two in the streets leading to them; in\r\nCovent-garden there are no less than four coffee-stalls. Indeed, the\r\nstalls abound in all the great thoroughfares, and the most in those not\r\naccounted “fashionable” and great “business” routes, but such as are\r\nfrequented by working people, on their way to their day’s labour. The\r\nbest “pitch” in London is supposed to be at the corner of Duke-street,\r\nOxford-street. The proprietor of that stall is said to take full\r\n30_s._ of a morning, in halfpence. One stall-keeper, I was informed,\r\nwhen “upon the drink” thinks nothing of spending his 10_l._ or 15_l._\r\nin a week. A party assured me that once, when the stall-keeper above\r\nmentioned was away “on the spree,” he took up his stand there, and got\r\nfrom 4_s._ to 5_s._ in the course of ten minutes, at the busy time of\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-stall usually consists of a spring-barrow, with two, and\r\noccasionally four, wheels. Some are made up of tables, and some have\r\na tressel and board. On the top of this are placed two or three, and\r\nsometimes four, large tin cans, holding upon an average five gallons\r\neach. Beneath each of these cans is a small iron fire-pot, perforated\r\nlike a rushlight shade, and here charcoal is continually burning, so\r\nas to keep the coffee or tea, with which the cans are filled, hot\r\nthroughout the early part of the morning. The board of the stall has\r\nmostly a compartment for bread and butter, cake, and ham sandwiches,\r\nand another for the coffee mugs. There is generally a small tub under\r\neach of the stalls, in which the mugs and saucers are washed. The\r\n“grandest” stall in this line is the one before-mentioned, as standing\r\nat the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street (of which an engraving\r\nis here given). It is a large truck on four wheels, and painted a\r\nbright green. The cans are four in number, and of bright polished\r\ntin, mounted with brass-plates. There are compartments for bread\r\nand butter, sandwiches, and cake. It is lighted by three large oil\r\nlamps, with bright brass mountings, and covered in with an oil-cloth\r\nroof. The coffee-stalls, generally, are lighted by candle-lamps. Some\r\ncoffee-stalls are covered over with tarpaulin, like a tent, and others\r\nscreened from the sharp night or morning air by a clothes-horse\r\ncovered with blankets, and drawn half round the stall.\r\n\r\nSome of the stall-keepers make their appearance at twelve at night,\r\nand some not till three or four in the morning. Those that come out\r\nat midnight, are for the accommodation of the “night-walkers”--“fast\r\ngentlemen” and loose girls; and those that come out in the morning, are\r\nfor the accommodation of the working men.\r\n\r\nIt is, I may add, piteous enough to see a few young and good-looking\r\ngirls, some without the indelible mark of habitual depravity on their\r\ncountenances, clustering together for warmth round a coffee-stall,\r\nto which a penny expenditure, or the charity of the proprietor, has\r\nadmitted them. The thieves do not resort to the coffee-stalls, which\r\nare so immediately under the eye of the policeman.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-stall keepers usually sell coffee and tea, and some of them\r\ncocoa. They keep hot milk in one of the large cans, and coffee, tea,\r\nor cocoa in the others. They supply bread and butter, or currant cake,\r\nin slices--ham sandwiches, water-cresses, and boiled eggs. The price\r\nis 1_d._ per mug, or 1/2_d._ per half-mug, for coffee, tea, or cocoa;\r\nand 1/2_d._ a slice the bread and butter or cake. The ham sandwiches\r\nare 2_d._ (or 1_d._) each, the boiled eggs 1_d._, and the water-cresses\r\na halfpenny a bunch. The coffee, tea, cocoa, and sugar they generally\r\npurchase by the single pound, at a grocer’s. Those who do an extensive\r\ntrade purchase in larger quantities. The coffee is usually bought in\r\nthe berry, and ground by themselves. All purchase chicory to mix with\r\nit. For the coffee they pay about 1_s._; for the tea about 3_s._; for\r\nthe cocoa 6_d._ per lb.; and for the sugar 3-1/2_d._ to 4_d._ For the\r\nchicory the price is 6_d._ (which is the amount of the duty alone on\r\nforeign chicory), and it is mixed with the coffee at the rate of 6\r\nozs. to the pound; many use as much as 9 and 12 ozs. The coffee is\r\nmade of a dark colour by means of what are called “finings,” which\r\nconsist of burnt sugar--such, as is used for browning soups. Coffee\r\nis the article mostly sold at the stalls; indeed, there is scarcely\r\none stall in a hundred that is supplied with tea, and not more than a\r\ndozen in all London that furnish cocoa. The stall-keepers usually make\r\nthe cake themselves. A 4 lb. cake generally consists of half a pound\r\nof currants, half a pound of sugar, six ounces of beef dripping, and\r\na quartern of flour. The ham for sandwiches costs 5-1/2_d._ or 6_d._\r\nper lb.; and when boiled produces in sandwiches about 2_s._ per lb. It\r\nis usually cut up in slices little thicker than paper. The bread is\r\nusually “second bread;” the butter, salt, at about 8_d._ the pound.\r\nSome borrow their barrows, and pay 1_s._ a week for the hire of them.\r\nMany borrow the capital upon which they trade, frequently of their\r\nlandlord. Some get credit for their grocery--some for their bread.\r\nIf they borrow, they pay about 20 per cent. per week for the loan. I\r\nwas told of one man that makes a practice of lending money to the\r\ncoffee-stall-keepers and other hucksters, at the rate of at least 20\r\nper cent. a week. If the party wishing to borrow a pound or two is\r\nunknown to the money-lender, he requires security, and the interest\r\nto be paid him weekly. This money-lender, I am informed, has been\r\ntransported once for receiving stolen property, and would now purchase\r\nany amount of plate that might be taken to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONDON COFFEE-STALL.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe class of persons usually belonging to the business have been either\r\ncab-men, policemen, labourers, or artisans. Many have been bred to\r\ndealing in the streets, and brought up to no other employment, but many\r\nhave taken to the business owing to the difficulty of obtaining work at\r\ntheir own trade. The generality of them are opposed to one another. I\r\nasked one in a small way of business what was the average amount of his\r\nprofits, and his answer was,--\r\n\r\n“I usually buy 10 ounces of coffee a night. That costs, when good,\r\n1_s._ 0-1/2_d._ With this I should make five gallons of coffee, such as\r\nI sell in the street, which would require 3 quarts of milk, at 3_d._\r\nper quart, and 1-1/2 lb. of sugar, at 3-1/2_d._ per lb., there is some\r\nat 3_d._ This would come to 2_s._ 2-3/4_d._; and, allowing 1-1/4_d._\r\nfor a quarter of a peck of charcoal to keep the coffee hot, it would\r\ngive 2_s._ 4_d._ for the cost of five gallons of coffee. This I should\r\nsell out at about 1-1/2_d._ per pint; so that the five gallons would\r\nproduce me 5_s._, or 2_s._ 8_d._ clear. I generally get rid of one\r\nquartern loaf and 6 oz. of butter with this quantity of coffee, and for\r\nthis I pay 5_d._ the loaf and 3_d._ the butter, making 8_d._; and these\r\nI make into twenty-eight slices at 1/2_d._ per slice; so the whole\r\nbrings me in 1_s._ 2_d._, or about 6_d._ clear. Added to this, I sell\r\na 4 lb. cake, which costs me 3-1/2_d._ per lb. 1_s._ 2_d._ the entire\r\ncake; and this in twenty-eight slices, at 1_d._ per slice, would yield\r\n2_s._ 4_d._, or 1_s._ 2_d._ clear; so that altogether my clear gains\r\nwould be 4_s._ 4_d._ upon an expenditure of 2_s._ 2_d._--say 200 per\r\ncent.”\r\n\r\nThis is said to be about the usual profit of the trade. Sometimes they\r\ngive credit. One person assured me he trusted as much as 9-1/2_d._ that\r\nmorning, and out of that he was satisfied there was 4_d._, at least,\r\nhe should never see. Most of the stalls are stationary, but some are\r\nlocomotive. Some cans are carried about with yokes, like milk-cans,\r\nthe mugs being kept in a basket. The best district for the night-trade\r\nis the City, and the approaches to the bridges. There are more men\r\nand women, I was told, walking along Cheapside, Aldersgate-street,\r\nBishopsgate-street, and Fleet-street. In the latter place a good trade\r\nis frequently done between twelve at night and two in the morning. For\r\nthe morning trade the best districts are the Strand, Oxford-street,\r\nCity-road, New-road (from one end to the other), the markets,\r\nespecially Covent Garden, Billingsgate, Newgate, and the Borough. There\r\nare no coffee-stalls in Smithfield. The reason is that the drovers,\r\non arriving at the market, are generally tired and cold, and prefer\r\nsitting down to their coffee in a warm shop rather than drink it in\r\nthe open street. The best days for coffee-stalls are market mornings,\r\nviz. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On these days the receipts are\r\ngenerally half as much again as those of the other mornings. The best\r\ntime of the year for the business is the summer. This is, I am told,\r\nbecause the workpeople and costermongers have more money to spend.\r\nSome stall-keepers save sufficient to take a shop, but these are\r\nonly such as have a “pitch” in the best thoroughfares. One who did a\r\nlittle business informed me that he usually cleared, including Sunday,\r\n14_s._--last week his gains were 15_s._; the week before that he could\r\nnot remember. He is very frequently out all night, and does not earn\r\nsixpence. This is on wet and cold nights, when there are few people\r\nabout. His is generally the night-trade. The average weekly earnings\r\nof the trade, throughout the year, are said to be 1_l._ The trade, I\r\nam assured by all, is overstocked. They are half too many, they say.\r\n“Two of us,” to use their own words, “are eating one man’s bread.”\r\n“When coffee in the streets first came up, a man could go and earn,” I\r\nam told, “his 8_s._ a night at the very lowest; but now the same class\r\nof men cannot earn more than 3_s._” Some men may earn comparatively a\r\nlarge sum, as much as 38_s._ or 2_l._, but the generality of the trade\r\ncannot make more than 1_l._ per week, if so much. The following is the\r\nstatement of one of the class:--\r\n\r\n“I was a mason’s labourer, a smith’s labourer, a plasterer’s labourer,\r\nor a bricklayer’s labourer. I was, indeed, a labouring man. I could not\r\nget employment. I was for six months without any employment. I did not\r\nknow which way to support my wife and child (I have only one child).\r\nBeing so long out of employment, I saw no other means of getting a\r\nliving but out of the streets. I was almost starving before I took to\r\nit--that I certainly was. I’m not ashamed of telling anybody that,\r\nbecause it’s true, and I sought for a livelihood wherever I could. Many\r\nsaid they wouldn’t do such a thing as keep a coffee-stall, but I said\r\nI’d do anything to get a bit of bread honestly. Years ago, when I was\r\na boy, I used to go out selling water-cresses, and apples, oranges,\r\nand radishes, with a barrow, for my landlord; so I thought, when I\r\nwas thrown out of employment, I would take to selling coffee in the\r\nstreets. I went to a tinman, and paid him 10_s._ 6_d._ (the last of my\r\nsavings, after I’d been four or five months out of work) for a can,\r\nI didn’t care how I got my living so long as I could turn an honest\r\npenny. Well; I went on, and knocked about, and couldn’t get a pitch\r\nanywhere; but at last I heard that an old man, who had been in the\r\nhabit of standing for many years at the entrance of one of the markets,\r\nhad fell ill; so, what did I do, but I goes and pops into his pitch,\r\nand there I’ve done better than ever I did afore. I get 20_s._ now\r\nwhere I got 10_s._ one time; and if I only had such a thing as 5_l._\r\nor 10_l._, I might get a good living for life. I cannot do half as much\r\nas the man that was there before me. He used to make his coffee down\r\nthere, and had a can for hot water as well; but I have but one can to\r\nkeep coffee and all in; and I have to borrow my barrow, and pay 1_s._\r\na week for it. If I sell my can out, I can’t do any more. The struggle\r\nto get a living is so great, that, what with one and another in the\r\ncoffee-trade, it’s only those as can get good ‘pitches’ that can get a\r\ncrust at it.”\r\n\r\nAs it appears that each coffee-stall keeper on an average, clears 1_l._\r\na week, and his takings may be said to be at least double that sum, the\r\nyearly street expenditure for tea, coffee, &c., amounts to 31,200_l._\r\nThe quantity of coffee sold annually in the streets, appears to be\r\nabout 550,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nTo commence as a coffee-stall keeper in a moderate manner requires\r\nabout 5_l._ capital. The truck costs 2_l._, and the other utensils and\r\nmaterials 3_l._ The expense of the cans is near upon 16_s._ each. The\r\nstock-money is a few shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF GINGER-BEER, SHERBET, LEMONADE, &C.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in ginger-beer--now a very considerable traffic--was\r\nnot known to any extent until about thirty years ago. About that\r\ntime (1822) a man, during a most sultry drought, sold extraordinary\r\nquantities of “cool ginger-beer” and of “soda-powders,” near the Royal\r\nExchange, clearing, for the three or four weeks the heat continued,\r\n30_s._ a day, or 9_l._ weekly. Soda-water he sold “in powders,” the\r\nacid and the alkali being mixed in the water of the glass held by the\r\ncustomer, and drunk whilst effervescing. His prices were 2_d._ and\r\n3_d._ a glass for ginger-beer; and 3_d._ and 4_d._ for soda-water,\r\n“according to the quality;” though there was in reality no difference\r\nwhatever in the quality--only in the price. From that time, the numbers\r\npursuing this street avocation increased gradually; they have however\r\nfallen off of late years.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers who “brew their own beer” generally prepare half\r\na gross (six dozen) at a time. For a “good quality” or the “penny\r\nbottle” trade, the following are the ingredients and the mode of\r\npreparation:--3 gallons of water; 1 lb. of ginger, 6_d._; lemon-acid,\r\n2_d._; essence of cloves, 2_d._; yeast, 2_d._; and 1 lb. of raw sugar,\r\n7_d._ This admixture, the yeast being the last ingredient introduced,\r\nstands 24 hours, and is then ready for bottling. If the beverage\r\nbe required in 12 hours, double the quantity of yeast is used. The\r\nbottles are filled only “to the ridge,” but the liquid and the froth\r\nmore than fill a full-sized half-pint glass. “Only half froth,” I was\r\ntold, “is reckoned very fair, and it’s just the same in the shops.”\r\nThus, 72 bottles, each to be sold at 1_d._, cost--apart from any\r\noutlay in utensils, or any consideration of the value of labour--only\r\n1_s._ 7_d._, and yield, at 1_d._ per bottle, 6_s._ For the cheaper\r\nbeverage--called “playhouse ginger-beer” in the trade--instead of\r\nsugar, molasses from the “private distilleries” is made available.\r\nThe “private” distilleries are the illicit ones: “‘Jiggers,’ we call\r\nthem,” said one man; “and I could pass 100 in 10 minutes’ walk from\r\nwhere we’re talking.” Molasses, costing 3_d._ at a jigger’s, is\r\nsufficient for a half-gross of bottles of ginger-beer; and of the other\r\ningredients only half the quantity is used, the cloves being altogether\r\ndispensed with, but the same amount of yeast is generally applied. This\r\nquality of “beer” is sold at 1/2_d._ the glass.\r\n\r\nAbout five years ago “fountains” for the production of ginger-beer\r\nbecame common in the streets. The ginger-beer trade in the open air\r\nis only for a summer season, extending from four to seven months,\r\naccording to the weather, the season last year having been over in\r\nabout four months. There were then 200 fountains in the streets,\r\nall of which, excepting 20 or 30 of the best, were hired of the\r\nginger-beer manufacturers, who drive a profitable trade in them. The\r\naverage value of a street-fountain, with a handsome frame or stand,\r\nwhich is usually fixed on a wheeled and movable truck, so as one man’s\r\nstrength may be sufficient to propel it, is 7_l._; and, for the rent\r\nof such a fountain, 6_s._ a week is paid when the season is brisk,\r\nand 4_s._ when it is slack; but last summer, I am told, 4_s._ 6_d._\r\nwas an average. The largest and handsomest ginger-beer fountain in\r\nLondon was--I speak of last summer--in use at the East-end, usually\r\nstanding in Petticoat-lane, and is the property of a dancing-master.\r\nIt is made of mahogany, and presents somewhat the form of an upright\r\npiano on wheels. It has two pumps, and the brass of the pump-handles\r\nand the glass receivers is always kept bright and clean, so that the\r\nwhole glitters handsomely to the light. Two persons “serve” at this\r\nfountain; and on a fine Sunday morning, from six to one, that being\r\nthe best trading time, they take 7_l._ or 8_l._ in halfpennies--for\r\n“the beer” is 1/2_d._ a glass--and 2_l._ each other day of the week.\r\nThis machine, as it may be called, is drawn by two ponies, said to be\r\nworth 10_l._ a-piece; and the whole cost is pronounced--perhaps with a\r\nsufficient exaggeration--to have been 150_l._ There were, in the same\r\nneighbourhood, two more fountains on a similar scale, but commoner,\r\neach drawn by only one pony instead of the aristocratic “pair.”\r\n\r\nThe ingredients required to feed the “ginger-beer” fountains are of a\r\nvery cheap description. To supply 10 gallons, 2 quarts of lime-juice\r\n(as it is called, but it is, in reality, lemon-juice), costing 3_s._\r\n6_d._, are placed in the recess, sometimes with the addition of a pound\r\nof sugar (4_d._); while some, I am assured, put in a smaller quantity\r\nof juice, and add two-pennyworth of oil of vitriol, which “brings out\r\nthe sharpness of the lime-juice.” The rest is water. No process of\r\nbrewing or fermentation is necessary, for the fixed air pumped into\r\nthe liquid as it is drawn from the fountain, communicates a sufficient\r\nbriskness or effervescence. “The harder you pumps,” said one man who\r\nhad worked a fountain, “the frothier it comes; and though it seems\r\nto fill a big glass--and the glass an’t so big for holding as it\r\nlooks--let it settle, and there’s only a quarter of a pint.” The hirer\r\nof a fountain is required to give security. This is not, as in some\r\nslop-trades, a deposit of money; but a householder must, by written\r\nagreement, make himself responsible for any damage the fountain may\r\nsustain, as well as for its return, or make good the loss: the street\r\nginger-beer seller is alone responsible for the rent of the machine.\r\nIt is however, only men that are known, who are trusted in this\r\nway. Of the fountains thus hired, 50 are usually to be found at the\r\nneighbouring fairs and races. As the ginger-beer men carry lime-juice,\r\n&c., with them, only water is required to complete the “brewing of the\r\nbeer” and so conveyance is not difficult.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of “ginger-beer,” or rather of “small acid tiff,”\r\nwhich is sold out of barrels at street-stalls at 1/2_d._ the glass. To\r\nmake 2-1/2 gallons of this, there is used 1/2lb. tartaric, or other\r\nacid, 1_s._; 1/2 lb. alkali (soda), 10_d._; 1/2 lb. lump sugar, bruised\r\nfine, 4_d._; and yeast 1_d._ Of these “barrel-men” there are now about\r\none hundred.\r\n\r\nAnother class of street-sellers obtain their stock of ginger-beer\r\nfrom the manufacturers. One of the largest manufacturers for the\r\nstreet-trade resides near Ratcliffe-highway, and another in the\r\nCommercial-road. The charge by the wholesale traders is 8_d._ the\r\ndoz., while to a known man, or for ready money, 13 are given to the\r\ndozen. The beer, however, is often let out on credit--or in some cases\r\nsecurity is given in the same way as for the fountains--and the empty\r\nbottles must be duly returned. It is not uncommon for two gross of\r\nbeer to be let out in this way at a time. For the itinerant trade\r\nthese are placed on a truck or barrow, fitted up with four shelves,\r\non which are ranged the bottles. These barrows are hired in the same\r\nway as the costers’ barrows. Some sell their beer at stalls fitted up\r\nexclusively for the trade, a kind of tank being let into the centre of\r\nthe board and filled with water, in which the glasses are rinsed or\r\nwashed. Underneath the stall there is usually a reserve of the beer,\r\nand a keg containing water. Some of the best frequented stalls were\r\nin Whitechapel, Old-street-road, City-road, Tottenham-court-road, the\r\nNew-cut, Elephant and Castle, the Commercial-road, Tower-hill, the\r\nStrand, and near Westminster-bridge.\r\n\r\nThe stationary beer business is, for the most part, carried on in the\r\nmore public streets, such as Holborn and Oxford-street, and in the\r\nmarkets of Covent-garden, Smithfield, and Billingsgate; while the\r\nperipatetic trade, which is briskest on the Sundays--when, indeed, some\r\nof the stationary hands become itinerant--is more for the suburbs;\r\nVictoria-park, Battersea-fields, Hampstead-heath, Primrose-hill,\r\nKennington-common, and Camberwell-green, being approved Sunday haunts.\r\n\r\nThe London street-sellers of ginger-beer, say the more experienced, may\r\nbe computed at 3,000--of whom about one-third are women. I heard them\r\nfrequently estimated at 5,000, and some urged that the number was at\r\nleast as near 5,000 as 3,000. For my own part I am inclined to believe\r\nthat half the smaller number would be nearer the truth. Judging by the\r\nnumber of miles of streets throughout the metropolis, and comparing\r\nthe street-sellers of ginger-beer with the fruit-stall keepers, I am\r\nsatisfied that in estimating the ginger-beer-sellers at 1,500 we are\r\nrather over than under the truth. This body of street-sellers were more\r\nnumerous five years back by 15 or 20 per cent., but the introduction of\r\nthe street fountains, and the trade being resorted to by the keepers\r\nof coal-sheds and the small shopkeepers--who have frequently a stand\r\nwith ginger-beer in front of their shops--have reduced the amount of\r\nthe street-sellers. In 1842, there were 1,200 ginger-beer sellers in\r\nthe streets who had attached to their stalls or trucks labels, showing\r\nthat they were members--or assumed to be members--of the Society of Odd\r\nFellows. This was done in hopes of a greater amount of custom from the\r\nother members of the Society, but the expectation was not realised--and\r\nso the Odd Fellowship of the ginger-beer people disappeared. Of the\r\nstreet-traders 200 work fountains; and of the remaining portion the\r\nstationary and the itinerant are about equally divided. Of the whole\r\nnumber, however, not above an eighth confine themselves to the trade,\r\nbut usually sell with their “pop” some other article of open-air\r\ntraffic--fruit, sweet-stuff, or shell-fish. There are of the entire\r\nnumber about 350, who, whenever the weather permits, stay out all night\r\nwith their stands or barrows, and are to be found especially in all the\r\napproaches to Covent-garden, and the other markets to which there is a\r\nresort during the night or at day-break. These men, I was told by one\r\nof their body, worked from eight in the evening to eight or ten next\r\nmorning, then went to bed, rose at three, and “plenty of ’em then goes\r\nto the skittles or to get drunk.”\r\n\r\nThe character of the ginger-beer-sellers does not differ from what\r\nI have described as pertaining to the costermonger class, and to\r\nstreet-traders generally. There is the same admixture of the reduced\r\nmechanic, the broken-down gentleman’s servant, the man of any class in\r\nlife who cannot brook the confinement and restraint of ordinary in-door\r\nlabour, and of the man “brought up to the streets.” One experienced\r\nand trustworthy man told me that from his own knowledge he could\r\ncount up twenty “classical men,” as he styled them, who were in the\r\nstreet ginger-beer-trade, and of these four had been, or were said to\r\nhave been “parsons,” two being of the same name (Mr. S ----); but my\r\ninformant did not know if they stood in any degree of consanguinity\r\none to another. The women are the wives, daughters, or other\r\nconnections of the men.\r\n\r\nSome of the stalls at which ginger-beer is sold--and it is the same\r\nat the coal-sheds and the chandlers’ shops--are adorned pictorially.\r\nErected at the end of a stall is often a painting, papered on a\r\nboard, in which a gentleman, with the bluest of coats, the whitest of\r\ntrousers, the yellowest of waistcoats, and the largest of guard-chains\r\nor eye-glasses, is handing a glass of ginger-beer, frothed up like a\r\npot of stout, and containing, apparently, a pint and a half, to some\r\nlady in flowing white robes, or gorgeous in purple or orange.\r\n\r\nTo commence in this branch of the street business requires, in all\r\n18_s._ 3_d._: six glasses, 2_s._ 9_d._; board, 5_s._; tank, 1_s._; keg,\r\n1_s._; gross of beer, 8_s._ (this is where the seller is not also the\r\nmaker); and for towels, &c., 6_d._; if however the street-seller brew\r\nhis own beer, he will require half a gross of bottles, 5_s._ 6_d._; and\r\nthe ingredients I have enumerated, 1_s._ 7_d._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the street-sale of ginger-beer is that of other\r\nsummer-drinks. Of these, the principal is lemonade, the consumption\r\nof which is as much as that of all the others together. Indeed, the\r\nhigh-sounding names given to some of these beverages--such as “Nectar”\r\nand “Persian Sherbet”--are but other names for lemonade, in a slightly\r\ndifferent colour or fashion.\r\n\r\nLemonade is made, by those vendors who deal in the best articles,\r\nafter the following method: 1 lb. of carbonate of soda, 6_d._; 1 lb.\r\nof tartaric acid, 1_s._ 4_d._ (“at least,” said an informant, “_I_\r\npay 1_s._ 4_d._ at ’Pothecaries Hall, but it can be had at 1_s._”); 1\r\nlb. of loaf-sugar, 5-1/2_d._; essence of lemon, 3_d._ This admixture\r\nis kept, in the form of a powder, in a jar, and water is drawn from\r\nwhat the street-sellers call a “stone-barrel”--which is a stone jar,\r\nsomething like the common-shaped filters, with a tap--and a larger\r\nor smaller spoonful of the admixture in a glass of water supplies\r\nan effervescing draught for 1_d._ or 1/2_d._ “There’s sometimes\r\nshocking roguishness in the trade,” said one man, “and there is in\r\na many trades--some uses vitriol!” Lemonade, made after the recipe\r\nI have given, is sometimes bottled by the street-sellers, and sold\r\nin the same way as ginger-beer. It is bought, also, for street sale\r\nof the ginger-beer manufacturers--the profit being the same--but\r\nso bought to less than a twentieth of the whole sale. The water in\r\nthe stone barrel is spring-water, obtained from the nearest pump,\r\nand in hot weather obtained frequently, so as to be “served” in as\r\ncool a state as possible. Sometimes lemonade powders are used; they\r\nare bought at a chemist’s, at 1_s._ 6_d._ the pound. “Sherbet” is\r\nthe same admixture, with cream of tartar instead of tartaric acid.\r\n“Raspberry” has, sometimes, the addition of a few crusted raspberries,\r\nand a colouring of cochineal, with, generally, a greater degree of\r\nsweetening than lemonade. “If cochineal is used for colouring,” said\r\none man, “it sometimes turns brown in the sun, and the rasberry don’t\r\nsell. A little lake’s better.” “Lemon-juice” is again lemonade, with a\r\nslight infusion of saffron to give it a yellow or pale orange colour.\r\n“Nectar,” in imitation of Soyer’s, has more sugar and less acid than\r\nthe lemonade; spices, such as cinnamon, is used to flavour it, and the\r\ncolouring is from lake and saffron.\r\n\r\nThese “cooling drinks” are sold from the powder or the jar, as I have\r\ndescribed, from fountains, and from bottles. The fountain sale is not\r\nabove a tenth of the whole. All is sold in 1/2_d._ and 1_d._ glasses,\r\nexcept the nectar, which is never less than 1_d._ The customers are\r\nthe same as those who buy ginger-beer; but one “lemonader” with\r\nwhom I conversed, seemed inclined to insist that they were a “more\r\nrespectabler class.” Boys are good customers--better, perhaps, than for\r\nthe beer,--as “the colour and the fine names attracts them.”\r\n\r\nThe “cooling drink” season, like that of the ginger-beer, is determined\r\nby the weather, and last summer it was only four months. It was\r\ncomputed for me that there were 200 persons, chiefly men, selling\r\nsolely lemonade, &c., and an additional 300 uniting the sale with that\r\nof ginger-beer. One man, whose statement was confirmed by others, told\r\nme that on fine days he took 3_s._ 6_d._, out of which he cleared 2_s._\r\nto 2_s._ 6_d._; and he concluded that his brother tradesmen cleared as\r\nmuch every fine day, and so, allowing for wet weather and diminished\r\nreceipts, made 10_s._ a week. The receipts, then, for this street\r\nluxury--a receipt of 17_s._ 6_d._ affording a profit of 10_s._--show a\r\nstreet expenditure in such a summer as the last, of 2,800_l._, by those\r\nwho do not unite ginger-beer with the trade. Calculating that those who\r\ndo unite ginger-beer with it sell only one-half as much as the others,\r\nwe find a total outlay of 4,900_l._ One of the best trades is in the\r\nhands of a man who “works” Smithfield, and on the market days clears\r\ngenerally from 6_s._ to 9_s._\r\n\r\nThe stalls, &c., are of the same character as those of the ginger-beer\r\nsellers. The capital required to start is:--stone barrel, with brass\r\ntap, 5_s._ 6_d._; stand and trestle, 6_s._; 6 tumbler glasses, 2_s._\r\n3_d._; 2 towels, 6_d._; stock money, 2_s._ 6_d._; jar, 2_s._; 12\r\nbottles (when used), 3_s._ 6_d._; in all, about a guinea.\r\n\r\nIn showing the money expended in the ginger-beer trade it must be\r\nborne in mind that a large portion of the profits accrues to persons\r\nwho cannot be properly classed with the regular street-traders. Such\r\nis the proprietor of the great fountain of which I have spoken, who\r\nis to be classed as a speculative man, ready to embark capital in\r\nany way--whether connected with street-traffic or not--likely to be\r\nremunerative. The other and large participants in the profits are the\r\nwholesale ginger-beer manufacturers, who are also the letters-out of\r\nfountains, one of them having generally nine let out at a time. For\r\na street trader to sell three gross of ginger-beer in bottle is now\r\naccounted a _good_ week, and for that the receipts will be 36_s._\r\nwith a profit in the penny bottle trade, to the seller, if he buy of\r\na manufacturer, of 12_s._; if he be his own brewer--reckoning a fair\r\ncompensation for labour, and for money invested in utensils, and in\r\nbottles, &c., of 20_s._ An ordinary week’s sale is two gross, costing\r\nthe public 24_s._, with the same proportion of profit in the same trade\r\nto the seller. In a _bad_ week, or “in a small way to help out other\r\nthings,” not more than one gross is sold.\r\n\r\nThe fountain trade is the most profitable to the proprietors, whether\r\nthey send out their machines on their own account, or let them out on\r\nhire; but perhaps there are only an eighth of the number not let out\r\non hire. Calculating that a fountain be let out for three successive\r\nseasons of twenty weeks each, at only 4_s._ the week, the gross\r\nreceipts are 12_l._ for what on the first day of hire was worth only\r\n7_l._; so that the returns from 200 machines let out for the same term,\r\nwould be 2,400_l._, or a profit of 1,000_l._ over and above the worth\r\nof the fountain, which having been thus paid for is of course in a\r\nsucceeding year the means of a clear profit of 4_l._ I am assured that\r\nthe weekly average of “a fountain’s takings,” when in the hands of the\r\nregular street-dealers, is 18_s._\r\n\r\nThe barrel traders may be taken as in the average receipt of 6_s._ a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the season was, last year, only sixteen weeks.\r\nCalculating from the best data I could acquire, it appears that for\r\nthis period 200 street-sellers of ginger-beer in the bottle trade of\r\nthe penny class take 30_s._ a week each (thus allowing for the inferior\r\nreceipts in bad weather); 300 take 20_s._ each, selling for the most\r\npart at 1/2_d._ the bottle, and that the remaining 400 “in a small\r\nway” take 6_s._ each; hence we find 11,480_l._ expended in the bottled\r\nginger-beer of the streets. Adding the receipts from the fountains and\r\nthe barrels, the barrel season continuing only ten weeks, the total sum\r\nexpended annually in street ginger-beer is altogether 14,660_l._ The\r\nbottles of ginger-beer sold yearly in the streets will number about\r\n4,798,000, and the total street consumption of the same beverage may be\r\nsaid to be about 250,000 gallons per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE AND CUSTOMERS OF A GINGER-BEER SELLER.\r\n\r\nA slim, well-spoken man, with a half-military appearance, as he had\r\na well trimmed moustache, and was very cleanlily dressed, gave me\r\nthe following account: “I have known the ginger-beer trade for eight\r\nyears, and every branch of it. Indeed I think I’ve tried all sorts of\r\nstreet business. I’ve been a costermonger, a lot-seller, a nut-seller,\r\na secret-paper-seller (with straws, you know, sir), a cap-seller, a\r\nstreet-printer, a cakeman, a clown, an umbrella-maker, a toasting-fork\r\nmaker, a sovereign seller, and a ginger-beer seller. I hardly know\r\nwhat I haven’t been. I made my own when last I worked beer. Sunday was\r\nmy best day, or rather Sunday mornings when there’s no public-houses\r\nopen. Drinking Saturday nights make dry Sunday mornings. Many a time\r\nmen have said to me: ‘Let’s have a bottle to quench a spark in my\r\nthroat,’ or ‘My mouth’s like an oven.’ I’ve had to help people to lift\r\nthe glass to their lips, their hands trembled so. They couldn’t have\r\nwritten their names plain if there was a sovereign for it. But these\r\nwas only chance customers; one or two in a morning, and five or six on\r\na Sunday morning. I’ve been a teetotaller myself for fifteen years. No,\r\nsir, I didn’t turn one--but I never was a drinker--not from any great\r\nrespect for the ginger-beer trade, but because I thought it gave one a\r\nbetter chance of getting on. I once had saved money, but it went in a\r\nlong sickness. I used to be off early on Sunday mornings sometimes to\r\nHackney Marsh, and sell my beer there to gentlemen--oldish gentlemen\r\nsome of them--going a fishing. Others were going there to swim. One\r\nweek I took 35_s._ at 1_d._ a bottle, by going out early in a morning;\r\nperhaps 20_s._ of it was profit, but my earnings in the trade in a good\r\nseason wasn’t more than 12_s._ one week with another. All the trades in\r\nthe streets are bad now, I think. Eight years back I could make half as\r\nmuch more in ginger-beer as could be made last summer. Working people\r\nand boys were my other customers. I stuck to ginger-beer in the season\r\nand then went into something else, for I can turn my hand to anything.\r\nI began a street life at eight years old by selling memorandum-books in\r\nthe bull-ring at Birmingham. My parents were ill and hadn’t a farthing\r\nin the house. I began with 1_d._ stock-money, and I bought three\r\nmemorandum-books for it at Cheap Jack’s thatched house. I’ve been in\r\nLondon seventeen or eighteen years. I’m a roulette-maker now; I mean\r\nthe roulette boxes that gentlemen take with them to play with when\r\ntravelling on a railway or such times. I make loaded dice, too, and\r\nsupply gaming-houses. I think I know more gaming-houses than any man in\r\nLondon. I’ve sold them to gentlemen and to parsons, that is ministers\r\nof religion. I can prove that. I don’t sell those sort of things in\r\nthe streets. I could do very well in the trade, but it’s so uncertain\r\nand so little’s wanted compared to what would keep a man going, and I\r\nhave a mother that’s sixty to support. Altogether my present business\r\nis inferior to the ginger-beer; but the fountains will destroy all the\r\nfair ginger-beer trade.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF HOT ELDER WINE.\r\n\r\nThe sale of hot elder wine in the streets is one of the trades which\r\nhave been long established, but it is only within these eight or ten\r\nyears that it has been carried on in its present form. It continues for\r\nabout four months in the winter.\r\n\r\nElder wine is made from the berries of the elder-tree. Elder\r\nsyrup--also made from the berries--was formerly famous in the north\r\nof England as a curative for colds, and was frequently taken, with a\r\nsmall admixture of rum, at bedtime. Some of the street-sellers make\r\nthe wine themselves; the majority, however, buy it of the British wine\r\nmakers. The berries must be gathered when fully ripe, and on a dry day.\r\nThey are picked, measured, and put into a copper, two gallons of water\r\nbeing added to every gallon of berries. They are then boiled till the\r\nberries are quite soft, when the liquor is strained and pressed from\r\nthem through a strong hair sieve. The liquor thus expressed is again\r\nput into the copper, boiled an hour, skimmed, and placed in a tub along\r\nwith a bread toast, on which yeast is spread thickly; it then stands\r\ntwo days, and is afterwards put into a cask, a few cloves and crusted\r\nginger being hung in a muslin bag from the bung-hole, so as to flavour\r\nthe liquor. Sometimes this spicing is added afterwards, when the\r\nliquor is warmed. The berries are sold in the markets, principally in\r\nCovent-garden,--the price varying, according to the season, from 1_s._\r\n6_d._ to 3_s._ a gallon. Of all elder-wine makers the Jews are the best\r\nas regards the street commodity. The costermongers say they “have a\r\nsecret;” a thing said frequently enough when superior skill is shown,\r\nand especially when, as in the case of the Jews’ elder wine, better\r\npennyworths are given. The Jews, I am told, add a small quantity of\r\nraspberry vinegar to their “elder,” so as to give it a “sharp pleasant\r\ntwang.” The heat and pungency of the elder wine sold in the streets is\r\nincreased by some street-sellers by means of whole black pepper and\r\ncapsicums.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus in which the wine is now kept for sale in the streets is\r\nof copper or brass, and is sometimes “handsome.” It is generally an\r\nurn of an oblong form, erected on a sort of pedestal, with the lid or\r\ntop ornamented with brass mouldings, &c. Three plated taps give vent\r\nto the beverage. Orifices are contrived and are generally hidden, or\r\npartially hidden, with some ornament, which act as safety-valves, or,\r\nas one man would have it, “chimneys.” The interior of these urns holds\r\nthree or four quarts of elder wine, which is surrounded with boiling\r\nwater, and the water and wine are kept up to the boiling pitch by means\r\nof a charcoal fire at the foot of the vessel. Fruit of some kind is\r\ngenerally sold by the elder-wine men at their stand.\r\n\r\nThe elder wine urn is placed on a stand covered with an oil-cloth, six\r\nor eight glasses being ranged about it. It is sold at a halfpenny and a\r\npenny a glass; but there is “little difference in some elder wines,” I\r\nwas told, “between the penn’orths and the ha’porths.” A wine glass of\r\nthe “regular” size is a half-quartern, or the eighth of a pint.\r\n\r\nAlong with each glass of hot elder wine is given a small piece of\r\ntoasted bread. Some buyers steep this bread in the wine, and so imbibe\r\nthe flavour. “It ain’t no good as I know on,” said an elder-wine\r\nseller, “but it’s the fashion, and so people must have it.” The\r\npurchasers of elder wine are the working classes--but not the better\r\norder of them--and the boys of the street. Some of these lads, I was\r\ntold, were very choice and critical in their elder wines. Some will\r\nsay: “It ain’t such bad wine, but not the real spicy.”--“The helder I\r\nthinks,” said another, “is middlin’, but somehow there’s nothing but\r\nhotness for to taste.”\r\n\r\nOf these traders there are now perhaps fifty in London. One man counted\r\nup thirty of his brethren whom he knew personally, or knew to be then\r\n“working elder,” and he thought that there might be as many more, but\r\nI am assured that fifty is about the mark. The sellers of elder wine\r\nhave been for the most part mechanics who have adopted the calling\r\nfor the reasons I have often given. None of them, in the course of my\r\ninquiry, depended entirely upon the sale of the wine, but sold fruit\r\nin addition to it. All complained of the bad state of trade. One man\r\nsaid, that four or five years back he had replenished the wine in a\r\nthree quart urn twelve times a day, a jar of the wine being kept at\r\nthe stall in readiness for that purpose. This amounted to 576 glasses\r\nsold in the course of the day, and a receipt--reckoning each glass at\r\na penny--of 48_s._; but probably not more than 40_s._ would be taken,\r\nas some would have halfpenny glasses. Now the same man rarely sells\r\nthree quarts in a day, except perhaps on a Saturday, and on wet days he\r\nsells none at all. The elder wine can be bought at almost any price at\r\nthe wine makers, from 4_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ the quart. The charge in the\r\npublic-houses is twice as high as in the streets, but the inn wine, I\r\nwas told by a person familiar with the trade, contains spirit, and is\r\nmore highly spiced.\r\n\r\nA decent-looking middle-aged man who had been in a gentleman’s service,\r\nbut was disabled by an accident which crushed his hand, and who\r\nthereupon resorted to street-selling and had since continued in it, in\r\ndifferent branches, from fifteen to twenty years, gave me an account\r\nof his customers. He had not been acquainted with the elder-wine trade\r\nabove four or five years when he bought an elder can for about 15_s._\r\namong a cheap miscellaneous “lot” in Smithfield one Friday afternoon,\r\nand so he commenced:\r\n\r\n“It’s a poor trade, sir,” he said. “I don’t suppose any of us make\r\n10_s._ a week at it alone, but it’s a good help to other things, and I\r\ndo middling. I should say less than a 1_s._ a day was above the average\r\nprofits of the trade. Say 5_s._ a week, for on wet days we can’t sell\r\nat all. No one will stop to drink elder wine in the wet. They’ll rather\r\nhave a pennor’th of gin, or half a pint of beer with the chill off,\r\nunder shelter. I sell sometimes to people that say they’re teetotallers\r\nand ask if there’s any spirit in my wine. I assure them there’s not,\r\njust the juice of the berry. I start when I think the weather’s cold\r\nenough, and keep at it as long as there’s any demand. My customers are\r\nboys and poor people, and I sell more ha’porths than pennor’ths. I’ve\r\nheard poor women that’s bought of me say it was the only wine they ever\r\ntasted. The boys are hard to please, but I won’t put up with their\r\nnonsense. It’s not once in fifty times that a girl of the town buys my\r\nwine. It’s not strong enough for her, I fancy. A sharp frosty dry day\r\nsuits me best. I may then sell three or four quarts. I don’t make it,\r\nbut buy it. It’s a poor trade, and I think it gets worse every year,\r\nthough I believe there’s far fewer of us.”\r\n\r\nOne elder-wine stand in Tottenham-court-road cost, when new, 7_l._,\r\nbut that was six or seven years ago. Calculating that 50 persons clear\r\n5_s._ a week for 16 weeks, their profit being at least cent. per cent.,\r\nthe street outlay in this very British wine will be only 200_l._, and\r\nthe street-consumption of it in the course of the year 1,500 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF PEPPERMINT-WATER.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only thing which can be called a cordial or a liqueur sold\r\nin the streets (if we except elder wine), is peppermint-water, and of\r\nthis the sale is very limited. For the first 15 or 20 years of the\r\npresent century, I was told by one who spoke from a personal knowledge,\r\n“a pepperminter” had two little taps to his keg, which had a division\r\nin the interior. From one tap was extracted “peppermint-water;” from\r\nthe other, “strong peppermint-water.” The one was at that time 1_d._\r\na glass, the other from 2_d._ to 4_d._, according to the size of the\r\nglass. With the “strong” beverage was mixed smuggled spirit, but so\r\nstrongly impregnated with the odour of the mint, that a passer-by could\r\nnot detect the presence of the illicit compound. There are six persons\r\nselling peppermint-water in the winter, and only half that number in\r\nthe summer. The trade is irregular, as some pursue it only of a night,\r\nand generally in the street markets; others sell at Billingsgate, and\r\nplaces of great traffic, when the traffic is being carried on. They\r\nare stationary for awhile, but keep shifting their ground. The vendors\r\ngenerally “distilled their own mint,” when the sale was greater, but\r\nwithin these six or eight years they have purchased it at a distilling\r\nchemist’s, and have only prepared it for sale. Water is added to the\r\ndistilled liquid bought of the chemist, to increase the quantity;\r\nbut to enhance the heat of the draught--which is a draw to some\r\nbuyers--black pepper (unground), or ginger, or, but rarely, capsicums,\r\nare steeped in the beverage. The peppermint-water is lauded by the\r\nvendors, when questioned concerning it, as an excellent stomachic;\r\nbut nothing is said publicly of its virtues, the cry being merely,\r\n“Pep-permint water, a halfpenny a glass.”\r\n\r\nThe sellers will generally say that they distil the peppermint-water\r\nthemselves, but this is not now commonly the case. The process,\r\nhowever, is simple enough. The peppermint used is gathered just as it\r\nis bursting into flower, and the leaves and buds are placed in a tub,\r\nwith just water enough to cover them. This steeping continues 24 hours,\r\nand then a still is filled three-parts full, and the water is “over”\r\ndrawn very slowly.\r\n\r\nThe price at the chemist’s is 1_s._ a quart for the common mint-water;\r\nthe street price is 1/2_d._ a glass, containing something short of the\r\neighth of a pint. What costs 1_s._, the street-seller disposes of for\r\n2_s._, so realising the usual cent. per cent.\r\n\r\nTo take 2_s._ is now accounted “a tidy day’s work;” and calculating\r\nthat four “pepperminters” take that amount the year round, Sundays\r\nexcepted, we find that nearly 125_l._ is spent annually in\r\npeppermint-water and 900 gallons of it consumed every year in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\nThe capital required is, keg, 3_s._ 6_d._, or jar, 2_s._ (for they\r\nare used indifferently); four glasses, 1_s._; towel, 4_d._, and\r\nstock-money, 4_s._; or, in all, about 8_s._ The “water”-keg, or jar,\r\nis carried by the vendor, but sometimes it is rested on a large\r\nstool carried for the purpose. A distilling apparatus, such as the\r\nstreet-sellers used, was worth about 10_s._ The vendors are of the same\r\nclass of street-sellers as the ginger-beer people.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF MILK SELLING IN ST. JAMES’S PARK.\r\n\r\nThe principal sale of milk from the cow is in St. James’s Park. The\r\nonce fashionable drink known as syllabubs--the milk being drawn warm\r\nfrom the cow’s udder, upon a portion of wine, sugar, spice, &c.--is now\r\nunknown. As the sellers of milk in the park are merely the servants of\r\ncow-keepers, and attend to the sale as a part of their business, no\r\nlengthened notice is required.\r\n\r\nThe milk-sellers obtain leave from the Home Secretary, to ply their\r\ntrade in the park. There are eight stands in the summer, and as many\r\ncows, but in the winter there are only four cows. The milk-vendors\r\nsell upon an average, in the summer, from eighteen to twenty quarts\r\nper day; in the winter, not more than a third of that quantity. The\r\ninterrupted milking of the cows, as practised in the Park, often\r\ncauses them to give less milk, than they would in the ordinary way.\r\nThe chief customers are infants, and adults, and others, of a delicate\r\nconstitution, who have been recommended to take new milk. On a wet day\r\nscarcely any milk can be disposed of. Soldiers are occasional customers.\r\n\r\nA somewhat sour-tempered old woman, speaking as if she had been crossed\r\nin love, but experienced in this trade, gave me the following account:\r\n\r\n“It’s not at all a lively sort of life, selling milk from the cows,\r\nthough some thinks it’s a gay time in the Park! I’ve often been dull\r\nenough, and could see nothing to interest one, sitting alongside a\r\ncow. People drink new milk for their health, and I’ve served a good\r\nmany such. They’re mostly young women, I think, that’s delicate, and\r\nmakes the most of it. There’s twenty women, and more, to one man what\r\ndrinks new milk. If they was set to some good hard work, it would do\r\nthem more good than new milk, or ass’s milk either, I think. Let them\r\ngo on a milk-walk to cure them--that’s what I say. Some children come\r\npretty regularly with their nurses to drink new milk. Some bring their\r\nown china mugs to drink it out of; nothing less was good enough for\r\nthem. I’ve seen the nurse-girls frightened to death about the mugs.\r\nI’ve heard one young child say to another: ‘I shall tell mama that\r\nCaroline spoke to a mechanic, who came and shook hands with her.’ The\r\ngirl was as red as fire, and said it was her brother. Oh, yes, there’s\r\na deal of brothers comes to look for their sisters in the Park. The\r\ngreatest fools I’ve sold milk to is servant-gals out for the day. Some\r\nmust have a day, or half a day, in the month. Their mistresses ought to\r\nkeep them at home, I say, and not let them out to spend their money,\r\nand get into nobody knows what company for a holiday; mistresses is too\r\neasy that way. It’s such gals as makes fools of themselves in liking a\r\nsoldier to run after them. I’ve seen one of them--yes, some would call\r\nher pretty, and the prettiest is the silliest and easiest tricked out\r\nof money, that’s my opinion, anyhow--I’ve seen one of them, and more\r\nthan one, walk with a soldier, and they’ve stopped a minute, and she’s\r\ntaken something out of her glove and given it to him. Then they’ve\r\ncome up to me, and he’s said to her, ‘Mayn’t I treat you with a little\r\nnew milk, my dear?’ and he’s changed a shilling. Why, of course, the\r\nsilly fool of a gal had given him that there shilling. I thought, when\r\nAnnette Myers shot the soldier, it would be a warning, but nothing’s\r\na warning to some gals. _She_ was one of those fools. It was a good\r\ndeal talked about at the stand, but I think none of us know’d her.\r\nIndeed, we don’t know our customers but by sight. Yes, there’s now\r\nand then some oldish gentlemen--I suppose they’re gentlemen, anyhow,\r\nthey’re idle men--lounging about the stand: but there’s no nonsense\r\nthere. They tell me, too, that there’s not so much lounging about as\r\nthere was; those that’s known the trade longer than me thinks so. Them\r\nchildren’s a great check on the nusses, and they can’t be such fools\r\nas the servant-maids. I don’t know how many of them I’ve served with\r\nmilk along with soldiers: I never counted them. They’re nothing to me.\r\nVery few elderly people drink new milk. It’s mostly the young. I’ve\r\nbeen asked by strangers when the Duke of Wellington would pass to the\r\nHorse-Guards or to the House of Lords. He’s pretty regular. I’ve had\r\n6_d._ given me--but not above once or twice a year--to tell strangers\r\nwhere was the best place to see him from as he passed. I don’t\r\nunderstand about this Great Exhibition, but, no doubt, more new milk\r\nwill be sold when it’s opened, and that’s all I cares about.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF MILK.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months milk is sold in Smithfield, Billingsgate, and\r\nthe other markets, and on Sundays in Battersea-fields, Clapham-common,\r\nCamberwell-green, Hampstead-heath, and similar places. About twenty\r\nmen are engaged in this sale. They usually wear a smock frock, and\r\nhave the cans and yoke used by the regular milk-sellers; they are not\r\nitinerant. The skim milk--for they sell none else--is purchased at the\r\ndairies at 1-1/2_d._ a quart, and even the skim milk is also further\r\nwatered by the street-sellers. Their cry is “Half-penny half-pint!\r\nMilk!” The tin measure however in which the milk-and-water is served is\r\ngenerally a “slang,” and contains but half of the quantity proclaimed.\r\nThe purchasers are chiefly boys and children; rarely men, and never\r\ncostermongers, I was told, “for they reckon milk sickly.” These\r\nstreet-sellers--who have most of them been employed in the more regular\r\nmilk-trade--clear about 1_s._ 6_d._ a day each, for three months; and\r\nas the profit is rather more than cent. per cent. it appears that about\r\n4,000 gallons of milk are thus sold, and upwards of 260_l._ laid out\r\nupon these persons, yearly in its purchase.\r\n\r\nA pair of cans with the yoke cost 15_s._, and 1_l._ is amply sufficient\r\nas capital to start in this trade, as the two measures used may be\r\nbought for 2_s._; and 3_s._ can be devoted to the purchase of the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF CURDS AND WHEY.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of milk which comprise the street-trade, are curds and\r\nwhey and rice-milk, the oldest street-sellers stating that these were a\r\nportion of the trade in their childhood. The one is a summer, and the\r\nother a winter traffic, and both are exclusively in the hands of the\r\nsame middle-aged and elderly women. The vendors prepare the curds and\r\nwhey in all cases themselves. “Skim-milk,” purchased at the dairies,\r\nis used by the street-purveyors, a gallon being the quantity usually\r\nprepared at a time. This milk gallon is double the usual quantity, or\r\neight quarts. The milk is first “scalded,” the pan containing it being\r\nclosely watched, in order that the contents may not boil. The scalding\r\noccupies 10 or 15 minutes, and it is then “cooled” until it attains\r\nthe lukewarmness of new milk. Half a pound of sugar is then dissolved\r\nin the milk, and a tea-spoonful of rennet is introduced, which is\r\nsufficient to “turn” a gallon. In an hour, or in some cases two, the\r\nmilk is curded, and is ready for use. The street-sale is confined to\r\nstalls; the stall, which is the ordinary stand, being covered with a\r\nwhite cloth, or in some cases an oil-cloth, and on this the curds, in\r\na bright tin kettle or pan, are deposited. There are six mugs on the\r\nboard, and a spoon in each, but those who affect a more modern style\r\nhave glasses. One of the neatest stalls, as regards the display of\r\nglass, and the bright cleanliness of the vessel containing the curds,\r\nis in Holborn; but the curd-seller there has only an average business.\r\nThe mugs or glasses hold about the third of a pint, and “the full of\r\none” is a penny-worth; for a halfpenny-worth the vessel is half filled.\r\nThe season is during the height of summer, and continues three or four\r\nmonths, or, as one woman tersely and commercially expressed it, “from\r\nEaster to fruit.” The number of street-saleswomen is about 100. Along\r\nwith the curds they generally sell oranges, or such early fruit as\r\ncherries.\r\n\r\nA woman who had sold “cruds”--as the street-people usually call it--for\r\neighteen years, gave me the following account:--“Boys and girls is\r\nmy best customers for cruds, sir. Perhaps I sell to them almost half\r\nof all I get rid of. Very little fellows will treat girls, often\r\nbigger than themselves, at my stall, and they have as much chaffing\r\nand nonsense about it’s being ‘stunning good for the teeth,’ and such\r\nlike, as if they was grown-up. Some don’t much like it at first, but\r\nthey gets to like it. One boy, whose young woman made faces at it--and\r\nit _was_ a little sour to be sure that morning--got quite vexed and\r\nsaid, ‘Wot a image you’re a-making on yourself!’ I don’t know what\r\nsort the boys are, only that they’re the street-boys mostly. Quiet\r\nworking people are my other customers, perhaps rather more women than\r\nmen. Some has told me they was teetotallers. Then there’s the women\r\nof the town of the poorer sort, _they’re_ good customers,--as indeed\r\nI think they are for most cooling drinks at times, for they seem to\r\nme to be _always_ thirsty. I never sell to dustmen or that sort of\r\npeople. Saturday is my best day. If it’s fine and warm, I sell a gallon\r\nthen, which makes about 40 penn’orths; sometimes it brings me 3_s._,\r\nsometimes 3_s._ 6_d._; it’s rather more than half profits. Take it\r\naltogether, I sell five gallons in fine dry weeks, and half that in\r\nwet; and perhaps there’s what I call a set down wet week for every two\r\ndry. Nobody has a better right to pray against wet weather than poor\r\nwomen like me. Ten years ago I sold almost twice as much as I can now.\r\nThere’s so many more of us at present, I think, and let alone that\r\nthere’s more shops keeps it too.”\r\n\r\nAnother old woman told me, that she used, “when days was longest,”\r\nto be up all night, and sell her “cruds” near Drury-lane theatre,\r\nand often received in a few hours 5_s._ or 6_s._, from “ladies and\r\ngentlemen out at night.” But the men were so rackety, she said, and\r\nshe’d had her stall so often kicked over by drunken people, and no\r\nhelp for it, that she gave up the night-trade, and she believed it was\r\nhardly ever followed now.\r\n\r\nTo start in the curds and whey line requires the following\r\ncapital:--Saucepan, for the scalding and boiling, 2_s._; stall, 5_s._;\r\n6 mugs, 6_d._; or 6 glasses, 2_s._ 6_d._; 6 spoons, 3_d._; tin kettle\r\non stall, 3_s._ 6_d._; pail for water to rinse glasses, 1_s._ Then for\r\nstock-money: 1 gallon skimmed milk, 1_s._ 6_d._ or 1_s._ 8_d._; and 1/2\r\nlb. sugar, 2_d._ In all, 14_s._ 1_d._, reckoning the materials to be\r\nof the better sort.\r\n\r\nOf the whole number of street curd-sellers, 50 dispose of as much as\r\nmy informant, or 12-1/2 gallons in 3 weeks; the other 50 sell only\r\nhalf as much. Taking the season at 3 months, we find the consumption\r\nof curds and whey in the street to be 2,812 double gallons (as regards\r\nthe ingredient of milk), at a cost to the purchasers of 421_l._, half\r\nof which is the profit accruing to the street-seller. The receipts\r\nof those having the better description of business being 9_s._ 4_d._\r\nweekly; those of the smaller traders being 4_s._ 8_d._ There is a\r\nslight and occasional loss by the “cruds” being kept until unsaleable,\r\nin which case they are “fit for nothing but the hog-wash man.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF RICE-MILK.\r\n\r\nTo make rice-milk, the street-seller usually boils four quarts, of\r\nthe regular measure, of “skim” with one pound of rice, which has been\r\npreviously boiled in water. An hour suffices for the boiling of the\r\nmilk; and the addition of the rice, swollen by the boiling water,\r\nincreases the quantity to six quarts. No other process is observed,\r\nexcept that some sweeten their rice-milk before they offer it for\r\nsale; the majority, however, sweeten it to the customer’s liking\r\nwhen he is “served,” unless--to use the words of one informant--“he\r\nhave a werry, werry sweet tooth indeed, sir; and that can’t be\r\nstood.” For the sweetening of six quarts, half a pound of sugar is\r\nused; for the “spicing,” half an ounce of allspice, dashed over the\r\nmilk freely enough from a pepper-castor. Rice-milk is always sold\r\nat stalls arranged for the purpose, and is kept in a tin pan fitted\r\nupon a charcoal brazier, so that the “drinkable” is always hot.\r\nThis apparatus generally stands on the ground alongside the stall,\r\nand is elevated only by the feet of the brazier. The “rice-milk\r\nwoman,”--for the street-sellers are generally females,--dips a large\r\nbreakfast-cup, holding half a pint, into the pan, puts a tea-spoonful\r\nof sugar into it, browns the whole with allspice, and receives 1_d._;\r\na halfpennyworth is, of course, half the quantity. The rice-milk women\r\nare also sellers of oranges, chestnuts, apples, or some other fruit, as\r\nwell as the rice-milk; but, sometimes, when the weather is _very_ cold\r\nand frosty, they sell rice-milk alone. There are fifty street-sellers\r\nof rice-milk in London. Saturday night is the best time of sale, when\r\nit is not uncommon for a rice-milk woman to sell six quarts; but, in a\r\ngood trade, four quarts a day for six days of the week is an average.\r\nThe purchasers are poor people; and a fourth of the milk is sold\r\nto boys and girls, to whom it is often a meal. “Ah, sir,” said one\r\nwoman, “you should have seen how a poor man, last winter, swallowed a\r\npenn’orth. He’d been a-wandering all night, he said, and he looked it,\r\nand a gentleman gave him 2_d._, for he took pity on his hungry look,\r\nand he spent 1_d._ with me, and I gave him another cup for charity.\r\n‘God bless the gentleman and you!’ says he, ‘it’s saved my life; if I’d\r\nbought a penny loaf, I’d have choked on it.’ He wasn’t a beggar, for I\r\nnever saw him before, and I’ve never seen him again from that day to\r\nthis.” The same informant told me, that she believed no rice-milk was\r\nbought by the women of the town: “it didn’t suit the likes of them.”\r\nNeither is it bought by those who are engaged in noisome trades. If\r\nthere be any of the rice-milk left at night, and the saleswoman have\r\ndoubts of its “keeping,” it is re-boiled with fresh rice and milk. The\r\nprofit is considerable; for the ingredients, which cost less than 1_s._\r\n6_d._, are made into 96 pennyworths, and so to realize 8_s._ In some of\r\nthe poorer localities, however, such as Rosemary-lane, only 1/2_d._ the\r\nhalf-pint can be obtained, and 4_s._ is then the amount received for\r\nsix quarts, instead of 8_s._\r\n\r\nTo start “in rice-milk” requires 13_s._ capital, which includes a pan\r\nfor boiling the milk, 2_s._; a kettle, with brazier, for stall, 4_s._;\r\nstall or stand, 5_s._; six cups, 9_d._; for stock-money 15-1/2_d._,\r\nwith which is bought 4 quarts of skim-milk, 9_d._; 1 lb. of rice,\r\n3_d._; 1/2 lb. of sugar, 2_d._; allspice, 1_d._\r\n\r\nThe season continues for four months; and calculating--a calculation\r\nwithin the mark--that one half of the 50 sellers have as good a trade\r\nas my informant--24 quarts weekly--and that, of the remaining 25, one\r\nhalf sell 12 quarts each weekly, at 1_d._ the half-pint, and the other\r\nhalf vend 24 quarts at 1/2_d._ the half-pint, we find that 320_l._\r\nis annually spent in rice-milk and about 3,000 gallons of it yearly\r\nconsumed in the streets of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WATER-CARRIERS.\r\n\r\nIt may surprise many to learn that there are still existing\r\nwater-carriers in London, and some of them depending upon the trade for\r\na livelihood; while others, the “odd men” of the neighbourhood, carry\r\npails of spring water to the publicans or eating-house keepers, who may\r\nnot have servants to send to the nearest pump for it, and who require\r\nit fresh and cool for those who drink it at their meals. Of these men\r\nthere are, as near as I can ascertain, from 100 to 150; their charge is\r\n1_d._ per pail. Their earnings per day 6_d._ to 1_s._ Perhaps none of\r\nthem depend solely upon this labour for their support.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise at Highgate and Hampstead, for in those places both\r\nmen and women depend entirely for their daily bread on water carrying.\r\nAt Hampstead the supply is derived from what may be called a double\r\nwell, known as “the Conduit.” The ground is flagged, and the water is\r\nseen at each corner of a wall built to the surface of the ground (about\r\neight feet) and surmounted by an iron rail. The water is covered over,\r\nin one corner and not in the other, and the carrier descends a step\r\nor two, dips in his pails and walks away with them when filled. The\r\nwater is carried by means of a “yoke,” in the same way as we see the\r\nmilk-pails carried in every street in London. The well and the field in\r\nwhich the Hampstead water is situated are the property of the Church,\r\nand the water is free to any one, in any quantity, either for sale or\r\nany other purpose, “without leave.” In droughts or frosts the supply\r\nfails, and the carriers have sometimes to wait hours for their “turn,”\r\nand then to bale the water into their pails with a basin. The nearest\r\nstreet to which the water is carried is half a mile distant. Some is\r\ncarried three quarters of a mile, and some (occasionally) a mile. The\r\ntwo pails full, which contain seven gallons, are sold at 1-1/2_d._\r\nThe weight is about 70 lbs. Seventeen years ago the price was 3_d._;\r\nafter which it fell to 2-1/2_d._, then to 2_d._, and has been 1-1/2_d._\r\nthese five or six years, while now there are three or four carriers who\r\neven “carry” at two pails a-penny to the nearer places. The supply of\r\nthe well (apart from drought or frost) is fifty-six gallons an hour.\r\nThe principal customers are the laundresses; but in wet weather their\r\ncisterns and water-tubs are filled, and the carriers, or the major part\r\nof them, are idle. The average earnings of the carriers are 5_s._ a\r\nweek the year through. Two of them are men of seventy. There is a bench\r\nabout midway to Hampstead, at which these labourers rest; and here on\r\nalmost every fine day sits with them a palsied old soldier, a pensioner\r\nof about eighty, who regales them, almost daily, with long tales of\r\nVinegar Hill, and Jemmy O’Brien (the informer), and all the terrors\r\nof the terrible times of the Irish rebellion of 1798; for the old man\r\n(himself an Irishman) had served through the whole of it. This appears\r\nto be a somewhat curious theme for constant expatiation to a band of\r\nLondon water-carriers.\r\n\r\nThere are now twenty individuals, fourteen men and six women, carrying\r\nat Hampstead, and twice that number at Highgate. Some leave the\r\ncarrying when they get better work,--but three-fourths of the number\r\nlive by it entirely. The women are the wives and widows of carriers.\r\nThe men have been either mechanics or labourers, except six or eight\r\nyouths (my informant was not certain which) who had been “brought up to\r\nthe water, but would willingly get away from it if they could.”\r\n\r\nA well-spoken and intelligent-looking man, dressed in thick fustian,\r\nold and greasy, “but good enough for the carrying,” gave me the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\n“I was a copper-plate printer,” he said, “and twenty years ago could\r\nearn my 25_s._ a week. But employment fell off. The lithographic\r\ninjured it, and at last I could get very little work, and then none\r\nat all, so I have been carrying now between three and four years. My\r\nfather-in-law was in the trade, and that made me think of it. My best\r\nday’s work, and it’s the same with all, is 2_s._, which is sixteen\r\nturns. It’s not possible to do more. If that could be done every day\r\nit would be very well, but in wet weather when the laundresses, who\r\nare my customers, don’t want water, I can’t make 1_s._ a week. Then\r\nin a drought or a frost one has to wait such a long time for his turn,\r\nthat it’s not 6_d._ a day; a dry spring’s the worst. Last March I had\r\nmany days to wait six turns, and it takes well on to an hour for a turn\r\nthen. We sit by the well and talk when we’re waiting. O, yes, sir,\r\nthe Pope has had his turn of talk. There’s water companies both at\r\nHampstead and Highgate, but our well water (Hampstead) is asked for,\r\nfor all that. It’s so with Highgate. It is beautiful water, either for\r\nwashing or drinking. Perhaps it’s better with a little drop of spirit\r\nfor drinking, but I seldom taste it that way. The fatigue’s so great\r\nthat we _must_ take a little drop of spirit on a long day. No, sir, we\r\ndon’t mix it; that spoils two good things. I’ve been at the well first\r\nlight in the morning, and in summer I’ve been at work at it all night.\r\nThere’s no rule among us, but it’s understood that every one has his\r\nturn. There’s a little chaff sometimes, and some get angry at having\r\nto wait, but I never knew a fight. I have a wife and three children.\r\nShe works for a laundress, and has 2_s._ 6_d._ a day. She has two days\r\nregular every week, and sometimes odd turns as well. I think that the\r\nwomen earn more than the men in Hampstead. My rent is 1_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nweek for an unfurnished room. There is no trade on Sundays, but on fine\r\nsummer Sundays old ---- attends at the well and sells glasses of cool\r\nwater. He gets 2_s._ 6_d._ some days. He makes no charge; just what any\r\none pleases to give. Any body might do it, but the old gentleman would\r\ngrumble that they were taking his post.”\r\n\r\nComputing the number of water carriers at the two places at sixty, and\r\ntheir average earnings through the year at 5_s._ a week, it appears\r\nthat these men receive 780_l._ yearly. The capital required to start in\r\nthe business is 9_s._, the cost of a pair of pails and a yoke.\r\n\r\nThe old man who sells water on the summer Sunday mornings, generally\r\nleaving off his sale at church-time, told me that his best customers\r\nwere ladies and gentlemen who loved an early walk, and bought of him\r\n“as it looked like a bit of country life,” he supposed, more than\r\nfrom being thirsty. When such customers were not inhabitants of the\r\nneighbourhood, they came to him to ask their way, or to make inquiries\r\nconcerning the localities. Sometimes he dispensed water to men who\r\n“looked as if they had been on the loose all night.” “One gentleman,”\r\nhe said, “looks sharp about him, and puts a dark-coloured stuff--very\r\nlikely it’s brandy--into the two or three glasses of water which he\r\ndrinks every Sunday, or which he used to drink rather, for I missed him\r\nall last summer, I think. His hand trembled like a aspen; he mostly\r\ngave me 6_d._” The water-seller spoke with some indignation of boys,\r\nand sometimes men, going to the well on a Sunday morning and “drinking\r\nout of their own tins that they’d taken with ’em.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PASTRY AND CONFECTIONARY.\r\n\r\nThe cooked provisions sold in the streets, it has been before stated,\r\nconsist of three kinds--solids, liquids, and pastry and confectionary.\r\nThe two first have now been fully described, but the last still remains\r\nto be set forth.\r\n\r\nThe street pastry may be best characterised as of a _strong_ flavour.\r\nThis is, for the most part, attributable to the use of old or rancid\r\nbutter,--possessing the all-important recommendation of cheapness,--or\r\nto the substitution of lard, dripping, or some congenial substance. The\r\n“strong” taste, however, appears to possess its value in the estimation\r\nof street pastry-buyers, especially among the boys. This may arise from\r\nthe palates of the consumers having been unaccustomed to more delicate\r\nflavours, and having become habituated to the relish of that which is\r\nsomewhat rank; just in the same way as the “_fumet_” of game or venison\r\nbecomes dear to the palate of the more aristocratic _gourmand_. To\r\nsome descriptions of street pastry the epithet strong-flavoured may\r\nseem inappropriate, but it is appropriate to the generality of these\r\ncomestibles,--especially to the tarts, which constitute a luxury, if\r\nnot to the meat pies or puddings that may supply a meal.\r\n\r\nThe articles of pastry sold in the London streets are meat and fruit\r\npies, boiled meat and kidney puddings, plum “duff” or pudding, and an\r\nalmost infinite variety of tarts, cakes, buns, and biscuits; while the\r\nconfectionary consists of all the several preparations included under\r\nthe wide denomination of “sweet-stuff,” as well as the more “medicinal”\r\nkind known as “cough drops;” in addition to these there are the more\r\n“aristocratic” delicacies recently introduced into street traffic,\r\nviz., penny raspberry creams and ices.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STREET PIEMEN.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant trade in pies is one of the most ancient of the street\r\ncallings of London. The meat pies are made of beef or mutton; the\r\nfish pies of eels; the fruit of apples, currants, gooseberries,\r\nplums, damsons, cherries, raspberries, or rhubarb, according to the\r\nseason--and occasionally of mince-meat. A few years ago the street\r\npie-trade was very profitable, but it has been almost destroyed by the\r\n“pie-shops,” and further, the few remaining street-dealers say “the\r\npeople now haven’t the pennies to spare.” Summer fairs and races are\r\nthe best places for the piemen. In London the best times are during any\r\ngrand sight or holiday-making, such as a review in Hyde-park, the Lord\r\nMayor’s show, the opening of Parliament, Greenwich fair, &c. Nearly\r\nall the men of this class, whom I saw, were fond of speculating as to\r\nwhether the Great Exposition would be “any good” to them, or not.\r\n\r\nThe London piemen, who may number about forty in winter, and twice\r\nthat number in summer, are seldom stationary. They go along with\r\ntheir pie-cans on their arms, crying, “Pies all ’ot! eel, beef, or\r\nmutton pies! Penny pies, all ’ot--all ’ot!” The “can” has been before\r\ndescribed. The pies are kept hot by means of a charcoal fire beneath,\r\nand there is a partition in the body of the can to separate the hot and\r\ncold pies. The “can” has two tin drawers, one at the bottom, where the\r\nhot pies are kept, and above these are the cold pies. As fast as the\r\nhot dainties are sold, their place is supplied by the cold from the\r\nupper drawer.\r\n\r\nA teetotal pieman in Billingsgate has a pony and “shay cart.” His\r\nbusiness is the most extensive in London. It is believed that he sells\r\n20_s._ worth or 240 pies a day, but his brother tradesmen sell no such\r\namount. “I was out last night,” said one man to me, “from four in the\r\nafternoon till half-past twelve. I went from Somers-town to the Horse\r\nGuards, and looked in at all the public-houses on my way, and I didn’t\r\ntake above 1_s._ 6_d._ I have been out sometimes from the beginning of\r\nthe evening till long past midnight, and haven’t taken more than 4_d._,\r\nand out of that I have to pay 1_d._ for charcoal.”\r\n\r\nThe pie-dealers usually make the pies themselves. The meat is bought\r\nin “pieces,” of the same part as the sausage-makers purchase--the\r\n“stickings”--at about 3_d._ the pound. “People, when I go into houses,”\r\nsaid one man, “often begin crying, ‘Mee-yow,’ or ‘Bow-wow-wow!’ at me;\r\nbut there’s nothing of that kind now. Meat, you see, is so cheap.”\r\nAbout five-dozen pies are generally made at a time. These require a\r\nquartern of flour at 5_d._ or 6_d._; 2 lbs. of suet at 6_d._; 1-1/2 lb.\r\nmeat at 3_d._, amounting in all to about 2_s._ To this must be added\r\n3_d._ for baking; 1_d._ for the cost of keeping hot, and 2_d._ for\r\npepper, salt, and eggs with which to season and wash them over. Hence\r\nthe cost of the five dozen would be about 2_s._ 6_d._, and the profit\r\nthe same. The usual quantity of meat in each pie is about half an\r\nounce. There are not more than 20 _hot_-piemen now in London. There are\r\nsome who carry pies about on a tray slung before them; these are mostly\r\nboys, and, including them, the number amounts to about sixty all the\r\nyear round, as I have stated.\r\n\r\nThe penny pie-shops, the street men say, have done their trade a great\r\ndeal of harm. These shops have now got mostly all the custom, as\r\nthey make the pies much larger for the money than those sold in the\r\nstreets. The pies in Tottenham-court-road are very highly seasoned.\r\n“I bought one there the other day, and it nearly took the skin off my\r\nmouth; it was full of pepper,” said a street-pieman, with considerable\r\nbitterness, to me. The reason why so large a quantity of pepper is put\r\nin is, because persons can’t exactly tell the flavour of the meat with\r\nit. Piemen generally are not very particular about the flavour of the\r\nmeat they buy, as they can season it up into anything. In the summer,\r\na street pieman thinks he is doing a good business if he takes 5_s._\r\nper day, and in the winter if he gets half that. On a Saturday night,\r\nhowever, he generally takes 5_s._ in the winter, and about 8_s._ in\r\nthe summer. At Greenwich fair he will take about 14_s._ At a review in\r\nHyde-park, if it is a good one, he will sell about 10_s._ worth. The\r\ngenerality of the customers are the boys of London. The women seldom,\r\nif ever, buy pies in the streets. At the public-houses a few pies\r\nare sold, and the pieman makes a practice of “looking in” at all the\r\ntaverns on his way. Here his customers are found principally in the\r\ntap-room. “Here’s all ’ot!” the pieman cries, as he walks in; “toss or\r\nbuy! up and win ’em!” This is the only way that the pies can be got rid\r\nof. “If it wasn’t for tossing we shouldn’t sell one.”\r\n\r\nTo “toss the pieman” is a favourite pastime with costermongers boys and\r\nall that class; some of whom aspire to the repute of being gourmands,\r\nand are critical on the quality of the comestible. If the pieman win\r\nthe toss, he receives 1_d._ without giving a pie; if he lose, he hands\r\nit over for nothing. The pieman himself never “tosses,” but always\r\ncalls head or tail to his customer. At the week’s end it comes to the\r\nsame thing, they say, whether they toss or not, or rather whether they\r\nwin or lose the toss: “I’ve taken as much as 2_s._ 6_d._ at tossing,\r\nwhich I shouldn’t have had if I had’nt done so. Very few people buy\r\nwithout tossing, and the boys in particular. Gentlemen ‘out on the\r\nspree’ at the late public-houses will frequently toss when they don’t\r\nwant the pies, and when they win they will amuse themselves by throwing\r\nthe pies at one another, or at me. Sometimes I have taken as much as\r\nhalf-a-crown, and the people of whom I had the money has never eaten a\r\npie. The boys has the greatest love of gambling, and they seldom, if\r\never, buys without tossing.” One of the reasons why the street boys\r\ndelight in tossing, is, that they can often obtain a pie by such means\r\nwhen they have only a halfpenny wherewith to gamble. If the lad wins he\r\ngets a penny pie for his halfpenny.\r\n\r\nFor street mince-meat pies the pieman usually makes 5lb. of mince-meat\r\nat a time, and for this he will put in 2 doz. of apples, 1lb. of sugar,\r\n1lb. of currants, 2lb. of “critlings” (critlings being the refuse left\r\nafter boiling down the lard), a good bit of spice to give the critlings\r\na flavour, and plenty of treacle to make the mince-meat look rich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COSTER BOY AND GIRL TOSSING THE PIEMAN.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe “gravy” which used to be given with the meat-pies was poured out\r\nof an oil-can, and consisted of a little salt and water browned. A\r\nhole was made with the little finger in the top of the meat pie, and\r\nthe “gravy” poured in until the crust rose. With this gravy a person\r\nin the line assured me that he has known pies four days old to go\r\noff very freely, and be pronounced excellent. The street piemen are\r\nmostly bakers, who are unable to obtain employment at their trade.\r\n“I myself,” said one, “was a bread and biscuit baker. I have been at\r\nthe pie business now about two years and a half, and I can’t get a\r\nliving at it. Last week my earnings were not more than 7_s._ all the\r\nweek through, and I was out till three in the morning to get that.”\r\nThe piemen seldom begin business till six o’clock, and some remain out\r\nall night. The best time for the sale of pies is generally from ten at\r\nnight to one in the morning.\r\n\r\nCalculating that there are only fifty street piemen plying their trade\r\nin London, the year through, and that their average earnings are 8_s._\r\na week, we find a street expenditure exceeding 1,040_l._, and a street\r\nconsumption of pies amounting nearly to three quarters of a million\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nTo start in the penny pie business of the streets requires 1_l._ for\r\na “can,” 2_s._ 6_d._ for a “turn-halfpenny” board to gamble with,\r\n12_s._ for a gross of tin pie-dishes, 8_d._ for an apron, and about\r\n6_s._ 6_d._ for stock money--allowing 1_s._ for flour, 1_s._ 3_d._ for\r\nmeat, 2_d._ for apples, 4_d._ for eels, 2_s._ for pork flare or fat,\r\n2_d._ for sugar, 1/2_d._ for cloves, 1_d._ for pepper and salt, 1_d._\r\nfor an egg to wash the pies over with, 6_d._ for baking, and 1_d._\r\nfor charcoal to keep the pies hot in the streets. Hence the capital\r\nrequired would be about 2_l._ in all.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BOILED PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of _boiled_ puddings, meat and currant--which might perhaps\r\nbe with greater correctness called dumplings--has not been known\r\nin London, I was informed by one in the trade, more than twelve\r\nor fourteen years. The ingredients for the meat puddings are not\r\ndissimilar to those I have described as required for the meat pies, but\r\nthe puddings are boiled, in cotton bags, in coppers or large pans, and\r\npresent the form of a round ball. The charge is a halfpenny each. Five\r\nor six years back a man embarked his means--said to be about 15_l._--in\r\nthe meat-pudding line, and prepared a superior article, which was\r\nkept warm in the street by means of steam, in a manner similar to\r\nthat employed by the pieman. A mechanic out of work was engaged by\r\nthis projector to aid him in the sale of his street luxuries, and the\r\nmechanic and his two boys made a living by this sale for two or three\r\nyears. The original pudding-projector relinquished the street trade to\r\ngo into business as a small shop-keeper, and the man who sold for him\r\non a sort of commission, earning from 12_s._ to 18_s._ a week, made the\r\npuddings on his own account. His earnings, however, on his own account\r\nwere not above from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a week beyond what he earned\r\nby commission, and a little while back he obtained work again at his\r\nown business, but his two boys still sell puddings in the street.\r\n\r\nThe sale of boiled meat puddings is carried on only in the autumn and\r\nwinter months, and only in the evenings, except on Saturdays, when\r\nthe business commences in the afternoon. The sale, I was informed by\r\none of the parties, has been as many as forty-five dozen puddings on\r\na Saturday evening. The tins in which the puddings are carried about\r\nhold from four to six dozen, and are replenished from the pans--the\r\nmakers always living contiguous to the street where the vend takes\r\nplace--as fast as the demand requires such replenishment. An average\r\nsale on a fine dry winter Saturday evening is thirty dozen, but then,\r\nas in most street callings, “the weather”--a remark often made to\r\nme--“has considerable to do with it.” A frost, I was told, helped\r\noff the puddings, and a rain kept them back. Next to Saturday the\r\nbest business night is Monday; but the average sale on the Monday is\r\nbarely half that on the Saturday, and on the other evenings of the\r\nweek about a third. This gives a weekly sale by each street-seller\r\nof 85 dozen, or 1,020 puddings, and as I am informed there are now\r\nbut six street-sellers (regularly) of this comestible, the weekly\r\naggregate would be--allowing for bad weather--5,400, or 129,600 in a\r\nseason of 24 weeks; an expenditure on the part of the street boys and\r\ngirls (who are the principal purchasers), and of the poor persons who\r\npatronise the street-trade, of about 270_l._ per annum. The wandering\r\nstreet-musicians of the poorer class--such as “Old Sarey” and the\r\nItalian boys--often make their dinner off a meat pudding purchased on\r\ntheir rounds; for it is the rule with such people never to return home\r\nafter starting in the morning till their day’s work is done.\r\n\r\nThe boys who ply their callings in the street, or are much in the\r\nopen air, are very fond of these puddings, and to witness the way\r\nin which they throw the pudding, when very hot, from hand to hand,\r\neyeing it with an expression that shows an eagerness to eat with\r\na fear of burning the mouth, is sometimes laughable and sometimes\r\npainful, because not unfrequently there is a look of keen hunger about\r\nthe--probably outcast--lad. The currant puddings are, I believe, sold\r\nonly at Billingsgate and Petticoat-lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PLUM “DUFF” OR DOUGH.\r\n\r\nPlum dough is one of the street-eatables--though perhaps it is rather a\r\nviolence to class it with the street-pastry--which is usually made by\r\nthe vendors. It is simply a boiled plum, or currant, pudding, of the\r\nplainest description. It is sometimes made in the rounded form of the\r\nplum-pudding; but more frequently in the “roly-poly” style. Hot pudding\r\nused to be of much more extensive sale in the streets. One informant\r\ntold me that twenty or thirty years ago, batter, or Yorkshire, pudding,\r\n“with plums in it,” was a popular street business. The “plums,” as\r\nin the orthodox plum-puddings, are raisins. The street-vendors of\r\nplum “duff” are now very few, only six as an average, and generally\r\nwomen, or if a man be the salesman he is the woman’s husband. The sale\r\nis for the most part an evening sale, and some vend the plum dough\r\nonly on a Saturday night. A woman in Leather-lane, whose trade is a\r\nSaturday night trade, is accounted “one of the best plum duffs” in\r\nLondon, as regards the quality of the comestible, but her trade is not\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe vendors of plum dough are the street-sellers who live by vending\r\nother articles, and resort to plum dough, as well as to other things,\r\n“as a help.” This dough is sold out of baskets in which it is kept hot\r\nby being covered with cloths, sometimes two and even three, thick; and\r\nthe smoke issuing out of the basket, and the cry of the street-seller,\r\n“Hot plum duff, hot plum,” invite custom. A quartern of flour,\r\n5_d._; 1/2 lb. Valentia raisins, 2_d._; dripping and suet in equal\r\nproportions, 2-1/2_d._; treacle, 1/2_d._; and allspice, 1/2_d._--in\r\nall 10-1/2_d._; supply a roly-poly of twenty pennyworths. The treacle,\r\nhowever, is only introduced “to make the dough look rich and spicy,”\r\nand must be used sparingly.\r\n\r\nThe plum dough is sold in slices at 1/2_d._ or 1_d._ each, and the\r\npurchasers are almost exclusively boys and girls--boys being at\r\nleast three-fourths of the revellers in this street luxury. I have\r\nascertained--as far as the information of the street-sellers enables me\r\nto ascertain--that take the year through, six “plum duffers” take 1_s._\r\na day each, for four winter months, including Sundays, when the trade\r\nis likewise prosecuted. Some will take from 4_s._ to 10_s._ (but rarely\r\n10_s._) on a Saturday night, and nothing on other nights, and some do\r\na little in the summer. The vendors, who are all stationary, stand\r\nchiefly in the street-markets and reside near their stands, so that\r\nthey can get relays of hot dough.\r\n\r\nIf we calculate then 42_s._ a week as the takings of six persons, for\r\nfive months, so including the summer trade, we find that upwards of\r\n200_l._ is expended in the street purchase of plum dough, nearly half\r\nof which is profit. The trade, however, is reckoned among those which\r\nwill disappear altogether from the streets.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start is: basket, 1_s._ 9_d._; cloths, 6_d._;\r\npan for boiling, 2_s._; knife, 2_d._; stock-money, 2_s._; in all about,\r\n7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CAKES, TARTS, &C.\r\n\r\nThese men and boys--for there are very few women or girls in the\r\ntrade--constitute a somewhat numerous class. They are computed\r\n(including Jews) at 150 at the least, all regular hands, with an\r\naddition, perhaps, of 15 or 20, who seek to earn a few pence on a\r\nSunday, but have some other, though poorly remunerative, employment on\r\nthe week-days. The cake and tart-sellers in the streets have been, for\r\nthe most part, mechanics or servants; a fifth of the body, however,\r\nhave been brought up to this or to some other street-calling.\r\n\r\nThe cake-men carry their goods on a tray slung round their shoulders\r\nwhen they are offering their delicacies for sale, and on their heads\r\nwhen not engaged in the effort to do business. They are to be found in\r\nthe vicinity of all public places. Their goods are generally arranged\r\nin pairs on the trays; in bad weather they are covered with a green\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nNone of the street-vendors make the articles they sell; indeed, the\r\ndiversity of those articles renders that impossible. Among the regular\r\narticles of this street-sale are “Coventrys,” or three-cornered puffs\r\nwith jam inside; raspberry biscuits; cinnamon biscuits; “chonkeys,”\r\nor a kind of mince-meat baked in crust; Dutch butter-cakes; Jews’\r\nbutter-cakes; “bowlas,” or round tarts made of sugar, apple, and bread;\r\n“jumbles,” or thin crisp cakes made of treacle, butter, and flour; and\r\njams, or open tarts with a little preserve in the centre.\r\n\r\nAll these things are made for the street-sellers by about a dozen Jew\r\npastry-cooks, the most of whom reside about Whitechapel. They confine\r\nthemselves to the trade, and make every description. On a fine holiday\r\nmorning their shops, or rather bake-houses, are filled with customers,\r\nas they supply the small shops as well as the street-sellers of London.\r\nEach article is made to be sold at a halfpenny, and the allowance\r\nby the wholesale pastry-cook is such as to enable his customers to\r\nrealise a profit of 4_d._ in 1_s._; thus he charges 4_d._ a dozen for\r\nthe several articles. Within the last seven years there has been, I\r\nam assured, a great improvement in the composition of these cakes,\r\n&c. This is attributable to the Jews having introduced superior\r\ndainties, and, of course, rendered it necessary for the others to vie\r\nwith them: the articles vended by these Jews (of whom there are from\r\n20 to 40 in the streets) are still pronounced, by many connoisseurs\r\nin street-pastry, as the best. Some sell penny dainties also, but\r\nnot to a twentieth part of the halfpenny trade. One of the wholesale\r\npastry-cooks takes 40_l._ a week. These wholesale men, who sometimes\r\ncredit the street-people, buy ten, fifteen, or twenty sacks of flour\r\nat a time whenever a cheap bargain offers. They purchase as largely\r\nin Irish butter, which they have bought at 3_d._ or 2-1/2_d._ the\r\npound. They buy also “scrapings,” or what remains in the butter-firkins\r\nwhen emptied by the butter-sellers in the shops. “Good scrapings” are\r\nused for the best cakes; the jam they make themselves. To commence\r\nthe wholesale business requires a capital of 600_l._ To commence the\r\nstreet-selling requires a capital of only 10_s._; and this includes the\r\ncost of a tray, about 1_s._ 9_d._; a cloth 1_s._; and a leathern strap,\r\nwith buckle, to go round the neck, 6_d._; while the rest is for stock,\r\nwith a shilling, or two as a reserve. All the street-sellers insist\r\nupon the impossibility of any general baker making cakes as cheap as\r\nthose they vend. “It’s impossible, sir,” said one man to me; “it’s a\r\ntrade by itself; nobody else can touch it. They was miserable little\r\nthings seven years ago.”\r\n\r\nAn acute-looking man, decently dressed, gave me the following account.\r\nHe resided with his wife--who went out charing--in a decent little\r\nback-room at the East-end, for which he paid 1_s._ a week. He had no\r\nchildren:--\r\n\r\n“I’m a ‘translator’ (a species of cobbler) by trade,” he said, “but\r\nI’ve been a cake and a tart-seller in the streets for seven or eight\r\nyears. I couldn’t make 1_s._ 3_d._ a day of twelve hours’ work, and\r\nsometimes nothing, by translating. Besides, my health was failing;\r\nand, as I used to go out on a Sunday with cakes to sell for a cousin\r\nof mine, I went into the trade myself, because I’d got up to it. I did\r\nmiddling the first three or four years, and I’d do middling still,\r\nif it wasn’t for the bad weather and the police. I’ve been up three\r\ntimes for ‘obstructing.’ Why, sir, I never obstructed a quarter as\r\nmuch as the print-shops and newspaper-shops down there” (pointing to\r\na narrow street in the City). “But the keepers of them shops can take\r\na sight at the Lord Mayor from behind their tills. The first time I\r\nwas up before the Lord Mayor--it’s a few years back--I thought he\r\ntalked like an old wife. ‘You mustn’t stand that way,’ he says, ‘and\r\nyou mustn’t do this, and you mustn’t do that.’ ‘Well, my lord,’ says\r\nI, ‘then I mustn’t live honestly. But if you’ll give me 9_s._ a week,\r\nI’ll promise not to stand here, and not to stand there; and neither to\r\ndo this, nor that, nor anything at all, if that pleases you better.’\r\nThey was shocked, they said, at my impudence--so young a fellow, too!\r\nI got off each time, but a deal of my things was spoiled. I work the\r\nCity on week-days, and Victoria Park on Sundays. In the City, my best\r\ncustomers is not children, but young gents; real gents, some of them\r\nwith gold watches. They buys twopenn’orth, mostly--that’s four of any\r\nsort, or different sorts. They’re clerks in banks and counting-houses,\r\nI suppose, that must look respectable like on a little, and so feeds\r\ncheap, poor chaps! for they dine or lunch off it, never doubt. Or they\r\nmay be keeping their money for other things. To sell eleven dozen is a\r\nfirst-rate days’ work; that’s 1_s._ 9_d._ or 1_s._ 10_d._ profit. But\r\nthen comes the wet days, and I can’t trade at all in the rain; and so\r\nthe things get stale, and I have to sell them in Petticoat-lane for two\r\na halfpenny. Victoria Park--I’m not let inside with my tray--is good\r\nand bad as happens. It’s chiefly a tossing trade there. Oh, I dare say\r\nI toss 100 times some Sundays. I don’t like tossing the coster lads,\r\nthey’re the wide-awakes that way. The thieves use ‘grays.’ They’re\r\nha’pennies, either both sides heads or both tails. Grays sell at from\r\n2_d._ to 6_d._ I’m not often had that way, though. Working-people buy\r\nvery few of me on Sundays; it’s mostly boys; and next to the gents.,\r\nwhy, perhaps, the boys is my best customers in the City. Only on Monday\r\na lad, that had been lucky ‘fiddling’” (holding horses, or picking up\r\nmoney anyhow) “spent a whole shilling on me. I clear, I think--and I’m\r\namong the cakes that’s the top of the tree--about 10_s._ a week in\r\nsummer, and hardly 7_s._ a week in winter. My old woman and me makes\r\nboth ends meet, and that’s all.”\r\n\r\nReckoning 150 cake-sellers, each clearing 6_s._ a week, a sufficiently\r\nlow average, the street outlay will be 2,340_l._, representing a\r\nstreet-consumption of 1,123,200 cakes, tarts, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF OTHER CAKE-SELLERS IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe street cake-selling of London is not _altogether_ confined to the\r\nclass I have described; but the others engaged in it are not regular\r\npursuers of the business, and do not exceed thirty in number. Some\r\nstock their trays with flare-cakes, which are round cakes, made of\r\nflour and “unrendered” (unmelted) lard, and stuck over freely with\r\ncurrants. They are sold at a farthing and a halfpenny each. Others,\r\nagain, carry only sponge-cakes, made of flour and eggs, packed closely\r\nand regularly together, so as to present an uniform and inviting\r\nsurface. Others carry only gingerbread, made of flour and treacle.\r\nThese small trades are sometimes resorted to for a temporary purpose,\r\nrather than a street-seller’s remaining in compulsory idleness. I\r\nlearned also that cake-sellers in the regular line, when unable to\r\ncommand sufficient capital to carry on their trade in the way they have\r\nbeen accustomed to, sell “flayers,” so called from being made with\r\npig’s or sheep’s “flay,” or any other cheap cakes, and so endeavour to\r\nretrieve themselves. The profits on these plainer sorts is 1_d._ in\r\n1_s._ more than that on the others, but the sale rarely exceeds half\r\nas much. I heard, however, of one man who deposited in pence, in eight\r\ndays, 1_s._ 10_d._ with a wholesale pastry-cook. He had saved this sum\r\nby almost starving himself, on the sale of the inferior cakes, and the\r\ndealer trusted him the 10_d._ to make up eight dozen in the regular\r\ncake business. To commence the street sale of cheap cakes requires a\r\ncapital of less than 5_s._; for tray, 1_s._ 6_d._; cloth, 6_d._; strap,\r\n6_d._; and stock-money, 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThree or four men are occupied in selling plum-cakes. These are\r\ngenerally sold in half-penny and penny lots. The plum-cake is made by\r\nthe same class of pastrycooks whom I have described as supplying the\r\ntarts, puffs, &c., and sold on the same terms. The profits are fifty\r\nper cent.--what cost 4_s._ bringing in 6_s._ One man who travels to all\r\nthe fairs and races, and is more in the country than town in the summer\r\nand autumn, sells large quantities of plum-cake in Smithfield when in\r\ntown, sometimes having 2_l._ worth and more on his stall. He sells\r\ncakes of a pound (ostensibly) at 4_d._, 6_d._, and 8_d._, according to\r\nquality. He sometimes supplies the street-sellers on the same terms as\r\nthe pastrycooks, for he was once a baker.\r\n\r\nFrom the best data at my command, it appears that the sale of these\r\ninferior cakes does not realise above a fifth of that taken by the\r\nother sellers, of whom I have treated, amounting to about 450_l._ in\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GINGERBREAD-NUTS, &C.\r\n\r\nThe sale of gingerbread, as I have previously observed, was much more\r\nextensive in the streets than it is at present. Indeed, what was\r\nformerly known in the trade as “toy” gingerbread is now unseen in the\r\nstreets, except occasionally, and that only when the whole has not been\r\nsold at the neighbouring fairs, at which it is still offered. But, even\r\nat these fairs, the principal, and sometimes the only, toy gingerbread\r\nthat is vended is the “cock in breeches;” a formidable-looking bird,\r\nwith his nether garments of gold. Twenty or thirty years ago, “king\r\nGeorge on horseback” was popular in gingerbread. His Majesty, wearing a\r\ngilt crown, gilt spurs, and a gilt sword, bestrode the gilt saddle of\r\nhis steed, and was eaten with great relish by his juvenile subjects.\r\nThere were also sheep, and dogs, and other animals, all adorned in a\r\nsimilar manner, and looking as if they had been formed in close and\r\nfaithful imitation of children’s first attempts at cattle drawing.\r\nThese edible toys were then sold in “white,” as well as in “brown”\r\ngingerbread, the white being the same in all other respects as the\r\nbrown, except that a portion of sugar was used in its composition\r\ninstead of treacle.\r\n\r\nThere are now only two men in London who make their own\r\ngingerbread-nuts for sale in the streets. This preparation of\r\ngingerbread is called by the street-sellers, after a common\r\nelliptical fashion, merely “nuts.” From the most experienced man in\r\nthe street trade I had the following account: he was an intelligent,\r\nwell-mannered, and well-spoken man, and when he laughed or smiled, had\r\nwhat may be best described as a pleasant look. After he had initiated\r\nme into the art and mystery of gingerbread making--which I shall detail\r\nseparately--he said,\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the ‘nut’ trade 25 years, or thereabouts, and have made\r\nmy own nuts for 20 years of that time. I bought of a gingerbread baker\r\nat first--there was plenty of them in them days--and the profit a\r\nliving profit, too. Certainly it was, for what I bought for 5_s._ I\r\ncould sell for 16_s._ I was brought up a baker, but the moment I was\r\nout of my time I started in the street nut trade for myself. I knew the\r\nprofits of it, and thought it better than the slavery of a journeyman\r\nbaker’s life. You’ve mentioned, sir, in your work, a musical sort of\r\na street-crier of gingerbread (see p. 160), and I think, and indeed\r\nI’m pretty certain, that it’s the same man as was my partner 20 years\r\nback; aye, more than 20, but I can’t tell about years.” [The reader\r\nwill have remarked how frequently this oblivion as to dates and periods\r\ncharacterises the statements of street-sellers. Perhaps no men take\r\nless note of time.] “At that time he was my partner in the pig trade.\r\nDairy-fed, d’you say, sir? Not in the slightest. The outsides of the\r\nhanimals was paste, and the insides on ’em was all mince-meat. Their\r\neyes was currants. We two was the original pigs, and, I believe, the\r\nonly two pigs in the streets. We often made 15_s._ between us, in a\r\nday, in pigs alone. The musical man, as you call him--poor fellow,\r\nhe dropped down dead in the street one day as he was crying; he was\r\nregular worn out--cried himself into his grave you _may_ say--poor\r\nfellow, he used to sing out\r\n\r\n  ‘Here’s a long-tailed pig, and a short-tailed pig,\r\n    And a pig with a curly tail:\r\n  Here’s a Yorkshire pig, and a Hampshire pig,\r\n    And a pig without e’er a tail.’\r\n\r\n“When I was first in the trade, I sold twice as many nuts as I do now,\r\nthough my nuts was only 12 a penny then, and they’re now 40. A little\r\nlarger the 12 were, but not very much. I have taken 20_s._ and 24_s._\r\nmany and many a Saturday. I then made from 2_l._ to 2_l._ 10_s._ a\r\nweek by sticking to it, and money might have been saved. I’ve taken\r\nbetween 7_l._ and 8_l._ at a Greenwich Fair in the three days, in them\r\ntimes, by myself. Indeed, last Easter, my wife and me--for she works\r\nas well as I do, and sells almost as much--took 5_l._ But gingerbread\r\nwas money in the old times, and I sold ‘lumps’ as well as ‘nuts;’ but\r\nnow lumps won’t go off--not in a fair, no how. I’ve been in the trade\r\never since I started in it, but I’ve had turns at other things. I was\r\nin the service of a Custom-house agency firm; but they got into bother\r\nabout contrabands, and the revenue, and cut off to America--I believe\r\nthey took money with them, a good bit of it--and I was indicted, or\r\nwhatever they call it, in the Court of Exchequer--I never was in\r\nthe Court in my life--and was called upon, one fine day, to pay to\r\nthe Crown 1,580_l._, and some odd pounds and shillings besides! I\r\nnever understood the rights of it, but it was about smuggling. I was\r\nindicted by myself, I believe. When Mr. Candy, and other great houses\r\nin the City, were found out that way, _they_ made it all right; paid\r\nsomething, as I’ve heard, and sacked the profits. Well; when _I_ was\r\ncalled on, it wasn’t, I assure you, sir--ha, ha, ha!--at all convenient\r\nfor a servant--and I was only that--to pay the fifteen hundred and odd;\r\nso I served 12 months and 2 days in prison for it. I’d saved a little\r\nmoney, and wasn’t so uncomfortable in prison. I could get a dinner, and\r\ngive a dinner. When I came out, I took to the nuts. It was lucky for me\r\nthat I had a trade to turn to; for, even if I could have shown I wasn’t\r\nat all to blame about the Exchequer, I could never have got another\r\nsituation--never. So the streets saved me: my nuts was my bread.\r\n\r\n“At this present time, sir, if I make, the year through, 9_s._ a week,\r\nand my wife 1_s._ or 2_s._ less, that’s the extent. When the Queen\r\nopened Parliament, the two on us took 10_s._ The Queen’s good for\r\nthat, anyhow, in person. If the opening was by proclamation” [so he\r\ncalled it, three or four times], “it wouldn’t have been worth while\r\ngoing to--not at all. If there’s not a crowd, the police interfere,\r\nand ‘move on!’ is the order. The Queen’s popular with me, for her\r\nopening Parliament herself. I count it her duty. The police are a\r\ngreat trouble. I can’t say they disturb me in the place (never mind\r\nmentioning it, sir) where you’ve seen me, but they do in other places.\r\nThey say there’s no rest for the wicked; but, in the streets, there’s\r\nno rest for a man trying to make an honest living, as I’m sure I do. I\r\ncould pitch anywhere, one time.\r\n\r\n“My chief dependence is on working-men, who buys my nuts to take home\r\nto their young ’uns. I never sell for parties, or desserts, that I know\r\nof. I take very little from boys--very little. The women of the town\r\nbuy hardly any of me. I used to sell a good many pigs to them, in some\r\nof the streets about Brunswick-square; kept misses, and such like--and\r\nvery pleasant customers they was, and good pay: but that’s all over\r\nnow. _They_ never ’bated me--never.”\r\n\r\nTo make about 56 lbs. of the gingerbread-nuts sold by my informant,\r\ntakes 28 lbs. of treacle, 7_s._; 48 lbs. of flour, 14_s._; 1/2 lb. of\r\nginger, 4_d._; and 1/2 lb. of allspice, 4_d._ From 18 to 20 dozen of\r\nsmall nuts go to the pound. This quantity, at 40 a penny, reckoning\r\n18 dozen to a pound, realises about 5_d._ per pound; or about 25_s._\r\nfor an outlay of 11_s._ 8_d._ The expense of baking, however, and of\r\n“appurtenances,” reduces the profit to little more than cent. per cent.\r\n\r\nThe other nut-sellers in the streets vend the “almond nuts.” Of these\r\nvendors there are not less than 150; of them, 100 buy their goods of\r\nthe bakers (what they sell for 1_s._ costing them 4_d._), and the\r\nother 50 make their own. The materials are the same as those of the\r\ngingerbread, with the addition of 4 lbs. of butter, 8_d._ per lb.;\r\n1 lb. of almonds, 1_s._ 4_d._; and 2 lbs. of volatile salts, 8_d._\r\nOut of this material, 60 lbs. of “almond nuts” may be made. A split\r\nalmond is placed in the centre of each of these nuts; and, as they\r\nare three times as large as the gingerbread nuts, 12 a penny is the\r\nprice. To sell 36 dozen a day--and so clearing 2_s._--is accounted a\r\n“very tidy day’s work.” With the drawback of wet weather, the average\r\nweekly earnings of the almond nut-sellers are, perhaps, the same as\r\nthe gingerbread nut man’s--9_s._ weekly. These almond nut-sellers are,\r\nfor the most part, itinerant, their localities of sale being the same\r\nas in the “cake and tart” line. They carry their goods, neatly done up\r\nin paper, on trays slung from the shoulder. The gingerbread-nuts are\r\ncarried in a large basket, and are ready packed in paper bags.\r\n\r\nSome of the “almond” men call at the public-houses, but the sale in\r\nsuch places is very small. Most of those who make their own nuts have\r\nbeen brought up as bakers--a class of workmen who seem to resort and\r\nadapt themselves to a street trade more readily than others. The nuts\r\nare baked in the usual way, spread on tin trays. To erect a proper oven\r\nfor the purpose costs about 5_l._, but most of the men hire the use of\r\none.\r\n\r\nI have already specified the materials required to make 56 lb. of\r\ngingerbread nuts, the cost being 11_s._ 8_d._ To that, the capital\r\nrequired to start in the business must be added, and this consists of\r\nbasket, 6_s._; baize cloth, 1_s._; pan for dough, 1_s._; rolling-pin,\r\n3_d._, and baking-tins, 1_s._ In all about 21_s._ To begin in a small\r\nway in the “almond” line, buying the nuts ready made, requires as\r\ncapital: tray, 2_s._; leather strap, 6_d._; baize, 1_s._; stock-money,\r\n1_s._ 6_d._--in all 5_s._ The sale is prosecuted through the year, but\r\nhot weather is unfavourable to it, as the nuts then turn soft.\r\n\r\nCalculating that 150 of these street-dealers take 17_s._ each weekly\r\n(clearing 9_s._), we find 6,630_l._ spent yearly in “spice” nuts in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF HOT-CROSS BUNS, AND OF CHELSEA BUNS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no cry--though it is only for one morning--is more familiar\r\nto the ears of a Londoner, than that of “One-a-penny, two-a-penny,\r\nhot-cross buns,” on Good Friday. The sale is unknown in the Irish\r\ncapital; for among Roman Catholics, Good Friday, I need hardly say,\r\nis a strict fast, and the eggs in the buns prevent their being used.\r\nOne London gentleman, who spoke of fifty years ago, told me that\r\nthe street-bun-sellers used to have a not unpleasing distich. On\r\nreflection, however, my informant could not be certain whether he had\r\nheard this distich cried, or had remembered hearing the elders of his\r\nfamily speak of it as having been cried, or how it was impressed upon\r\nhis memory. It seems hardly in accordance with the usual style of\r\nstreet poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “One-a-penny, two-a-penny, hot-cross buns!\r\n  If your daughters will not eat them, give them to your sons.\r\n  But if you hav’n’t any of those pretty little elves,\r\n  You cannot then do better than eat them all yourselves.”\r\n\r\nA tradesman who had resided more than fifty years in the Borough had,\r\nin his boyhood, heard, but not often, this ridiculous cry:--\r\n\r\n  “One-a-penny, poker; two-a-penny, tongs!\r\n  One-a-penny; two-a-penny, hot-cross buns.”\r\n\r\nThe sellers of the Good Friday buns are principally boys, and they are\r\nof mixed classes--costers’ boys, boys habitually and boys occasionally\r\nstreet-sellers, and boys street-sellers for that occasion only. One\r\ngreat inducement to embark in the trade is the hope of raising a little\r\nmoney for the Greenwich Fair of the following Monday.\r\n\r\nI am informed that 500 persons are employed on Good Friday in the\r\nstreets of London in the sale of hot-cross buns, each itinerant selling\r\nupon the day’s average six dozen halfpenny, and seven dozen penny buns,\r\nfor which he will take 12_s._ 6_d._ (his profits being 3_d._ in the\r\nshilling or 3_s._ 1-1/2_d._). One person informed me that last Good\r\nFriday he had sold during the day forty dozen penny buns, for which he\r\nreceived 50_s._\r\n\r\nThe bun-selling itinerants derive their supplies principally from the\r\nwholesale pastry-cooks, and, in a less degree, from the small bakers\r\nand pastrycooks, who work more for “the trade” than themselves. The\r\nstreet hot-cross bun trade is less than it was seven or eight years\r\nago, as the bakers have entered into it more freely, and send round\r\nfor orders: so that the itinerants complain that they have lost many\r\na good customer. One informant (a master pastry-cook, who had been in\r\nthe business nearly fifty years) said to me: “Times are sadly altered\r\nto what they were when I was a boy. Why I have known my master to\r\nbake five sacks of flour in nothing but hot-cross buns, and that is\r\nsufficient for 20,000 buns” (one sack of flour being used for 4,000\r\nbuns, or 500 lbs. of raw material to the same quantity of buns). The\r\nitinerants carry their baskets slung on their arm, or borne upon the\r\nhead. A flannel or green baize is placed at the bottom of the basket\r\nand brought over the buns, after which a white cloth is spread over the\r\ntop of the baize, to give it a clean appearance.\r\n\r\nA vendor of “hot-cross buns” has to provide himself with a basket,\r\na flannel (to keep the buns warm), and a cloth, to give a clean\r\nappearance to his commodities. These articles, if bought for the\r\npurpose, cost--basket, 2_s._ 6_d._; flannel and cloth, 2_s._;\r\nstock-money, average, 5_s._ (largest amount 15_s._, smallest 2_s._\r\n6_d._); or about 10_s._ in all.\r\n\r\nThere is expended in one day, in hot-cross buns purchased in the London\r\nstreets, 300_l._, and nearly 100,000 buns thus bought.\r\n\r\nThe Chelsea buns are now altogether superseded by the Bath and\r\nAlexander’s buns. “People,” the street-sellers say, “want so much for\r\ntheir money.” There are now but two Chelsea bun-houses; the one at\r\nPimlico, and the other at Chelsea. The principal times Chelsea buns\r\nwere sold in the streets was Good Friday, Easter, and Whitsuntide; and,\r\nwith the exception of Good Friday, the great sales were at Greenwich\r\nFair, and then they were sold with other cakes and sweetmeats. I am\r\ninformed that twenty years ago there was one man, with a rich musical\r\nvoice, who sold these buns, about Westminster principally, all the year\r\nround; his cry--which was one of the musical ones--was, “One a penny,\r\ntwo a penny, hot Chelsea buns! Burning hot! smoking hot! r-r-r-reeking\r\nhot! hot Chelsea buns!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF MUFFIN AND CRUMPET-SELLING IN THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of muffins and crumpets rank among the old\r\nstreet-tradesmen. It is difficult to estimate their numbers, but they\r\nwere computed for me at 500, during the winter months. They are for the\r\nmost part boys, young men, or old men, and some of them infirm. There\r\nare a few girls in the trade, but very few women.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the muffin-man’s bell--attached to which the pleasant\r\nassociations are not a few--was prohibited by a recent Act of\r\nParliament, but the prohibition has been as inoperative as that which\r\nforbad the use of a drum to the costermonger, for the muffin bell still\r\ntinkles along the streets, and is rung vigorously in the suburbs. The\r\nsellers of muffins and crumpets are a mixed class, but I am told that\r\nmore of them are the children of bakers, or worn-out bakers, than can\r\nbe said of any other calling. The best sale is in the suburbs. “As far\r\nas I know, sir,” said a muffin-seller, “it’s the best Hackney way, and\r\nStoke Newington, and Dalston, and Balls Pond, and Islington; where the\r\ngents that’s in banks--the steady coves of them--goes home to their\r\nteas, and the missuses has muffins to welcome them; that’s my opinion.”\r\n\r\nI did not hear of any street-seller who made the muffins or crumpets\r\nhe vended. Indeed, he could not make the small quantity required, so\r\nas to be remunerative. The muffins are bought of the bakers, and at\r\nprices to leave a profit of 4_d._ in 1_s._ Some bakers give thirteen\r\nto the dozen to the street-sellers whom they know. The muffin-man\r\ncarries his delicacies in a basket, wherein they are well swathed in\r\nflannel, to retain the heat: “People likes them warm, sir,” an old man\r\ntold me, “to satisfy them they’re fresh, and they almost always _are_\r\nfresh; but it can’t matter so much about their being warm, as they\r\nhave to be toasted again. I only wish good butter was a sight cheaper,\r\nand that would make the muffins go. Butter’s half the battle.” The\r\nbasket and flannels cost the muffin-man 2_s._ 6_d._ or 3_s._ 6_d._ His\r\nbell stands him in from 4_d._ to 2_s._, “according as the metal is.”\r\nThe regular price of good-sized muffins from the street-sellers is a\r\nhalfpenny each; the crumpets are four a penny. Some are sold cheaper,\r\nbut these are generally smaller, or made of inferior flour. Most of\r\nthe street-sellers give thirteen, and some even fourteen to the dozen,\r\nespecially if the purchase be made early in the day, as the muffin-man\r\ncan then, if he deem it prudent, obtain a further supply.\r\n\r\nA sharp London lad of fourteen, whose father had been a journeyman\r\nbaker, and whose mother (a widow) kept a small chandler’s shop, gave me\r\nthe following account:--\r\n\r\n“I turns out with muffins and crumpets, sir, in October, and continues\r\nuntil it gets well into the spring, according to the weather. I carries\r\na fust-rate article; werry much so. If you was to taste ’em, sir, you’d\r\nsay the same. If I sells three dozen muffins at 1/2_d._ each, and\r\ntwice that in crumpets, it’s a werry fair day, werry fair; all beyond\r\nthat is a _good_ day. The profit on the three dozen and the others is\r\n1_s._, but that’s a great help, really a wonderful help, to mother, for\r\nI should be only mindin’ the shop at home. Perhaps I clears 4_s._ a\r\nweek, perhaps more, perhaps less; but that’s about it, sir. Some does\r\nfar better than that, and some can’t hold a candle to it. If I has\r\na hextra day’s sale, mother’ll give me 3_d._ to go to the play, and\r\nthat hencourages a young man, you know, sir. If there’s any unsold, a\r\ncoffee-shop gets them cheap, and puts ’em off cheap again next morning.\r\nMy best customers is genteel houses, ’cause I sells a genteel thing.\r\nI likes wet days best, ’cause there’s werry respectable ladies what\r\ndon’t keep a servant, and they buys to save themselves going out.\r\nWe’re a great conwenience to the ladies, sir--a great conwenience to\r\nthem as likes a slap-up tea. I _have_ made 1_s._ 8_d._ in a day; that\r\nwas my best. I once took only 2-1/2_d._--I don’t know why--that was my\r\nworst. The shops don’t love me--I puts their noses out. Sunday is no\r\nbetter day than others, or werry little. I can read, but wish I could\r\nread easier.”\r\n\r\nCalculating 500 muffin-sellers, each clearing 4_s._ a week, we find\r\n100_l._ a week expended on the metropolitan street sale of muffins;\r\nor, in the course of twenty weeks, 2,000_l._ Five shillings, with the\r\nprice of a basket, &c., which is about 3_s._ 6_d._ more, is the capital\r\nrequired for a start.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SALE OF SWEET-STUFF.\r\n\r\nIn this sale there are now engaged, as one of the most intelligent of\r\nthe class calculated, 200 individuals, exclusive of twenty or thirty\r\nJew boys. The majority of the sellers are also the manufacturers of the\r\narticles they vend. They have all been brought up to the calling, their\r\nparents having been in it, or having been artizans (more especially\r\nbakers) who have adopted it for some of the general reasons I have\r\nbefore assigned. The non-makers buy of the cheap confectioners.\r\n\r\nThe articles now vended do not differ materially, I am informed by men\r\nwho have known the street trade for forty years, from those which were\r\nin demand when they began selling in the streets.\r\n\r\nA very intelligent man, who had succeeded his father and mother in\r\nthe “sweet-stuff” business--his father’s drunkenness having kept them\r\nin continual poverty--showed me his apparatus, and explained his mode\r\nof work. His room, which was on the second-floor of a house in a\r\nbusy thoroughfare, had what I have frequently noticed in the abodes\r\nof the working classes--the decency of a turn-up bedstead. It was\r\na large apartment, the rent being 3_s._ 6_d._ a week, unfurnished.\r\nThe room was cheerful with birds, of which there were ten or twelve.\r\nA remarkably fine thrush was hopping in a large wicker cage, while\r\nlinnets and bullfinches showed their quick bright eyes from smaller\r\ncages on all sides. These were not kept for sale but for amusement,\r\ntheir owner being seldom able to leave his room. The father and mother\r\nof this man cleared, twenty years ago, although at that time sugar was\r\n6_d._ or 7_d._ the pound, from 2_l._ to 3_l._ a week by the sale of\r\nsweet-stuff; half by keeping a stall, and half by supplying small shops\r\nor other stall-keepers. My present informant, however, who has--not the\r\nbest--but one of the best businesses in London, makes 24_s._ or 25_s._\r\na week from October to May, and scarcely 12_s._ a week during the\r\nsummer months, “when people love to buy any cool fresh fruit instead\r\nof sweet-stuff.” The average profits of the generality of the trade do\r\nnot perhaps exceed 10_s._ 6_d._ or 12_s._ a week, take the year round.\r\nThey reside in all parts.\r\n\r\nTreacle and sugar are the ground-work of the manufacture of all kinds\r\nof sweet-stuff. “Hardbake,” “almond toffy,” “halfpenny lollipops,”\r\n“black balls,” the cheaper “bulls eyes,” and “squibs” are all made of\r\ntreacle. One informant sold more of treacle rock than of anything else,\r\nas it was dispensed in larger halfpennyworths, and no one else made it\r\nin the same way. Of peppermint rock and sticks he made a good quantity.\r\nHalf-a-crown’s worth, as retailed in the streets, requires 4 lbs. of\r\nrough raw sugar at 4-1/4_d._ per lb., 1-1/2_d._ for scent (essence\r\nof peppermint), 1-1/2_d._ for firing, and 1/2_d._ for paper--in\r\nall 1_s._ 8-1/2_d._ calculating nothing for the labour and time\r\nexpended in boiling and making it. The profit on the other things was\r\nproportionate, except on almond rock, which does not leave 2-1/2_d._ in\r\na shilling--almonds being dear. Brandy balls are made of sugar, water,\r\npeppermint, and a little cinnamon. Rose acid, which is a “transparent”\r\nsweet, is composed of loaf sugar at 6-1/2_d._ per lb., coloured with\r\ncochineal. The articles sold in “sticks” are pulled into form along\r\na hook until they present the whitish, or speckled colour desired. A\r\nquarter of a stone of materials will, for instance, be boiled for forty\r\nminutes, and then pulled a quarter of an hour, until it is sufficiently\r\ncrisp and will “set” without waste. The flavouring--or “scent” as\r\nI heard it called in the trade--now most in demand is peppermint.\r\nGibraltar rock and Wellington pillars used to be flavoured with ginger,\r\nbut these “sweeties” are exploded.\r\n\r\nDr. Pereria, in his “Treatise on Diet,” enumerates as many as ten\r\ndifferent varieties and preparations of sugar used for dietetical\r\npurposes. These are (1) purified or refined sugar; (2) brown or\r\nraw sugar; (3) molasses or treacle--or fluid sugar; (4) aqueous\r\nsolutions of sugar--or syrups; (5) boiled sugars, or the softer kinds\r\nof confectionary; (6) sugar-candy, or crystallized cane sugar; (7)\r\nburnt sugar, or caramel; (8) hard confectionary; (9) liquorice; (10)\r\npreserves. The fifth and eighth varieties alone concern us here.\r\n\r\nOf the several preparations of _boiled sugar_, the Doctor thus speaks,\r\n“If a small quantity of water be added to sugar, the mixture heated\r\nuntil the sugar dissolves, and the solution boiled to drive off part of\r\nthe water, the tendency of the sugar to crystallise is diminished, or,\r\nin some cases, totally destroyed. To promote this effect, confectioners\r\nsometimes add a small portion of cream of tartar to the solution\r\nwhile boiling. Sugar, thus altered by heat, and sometimes variously\r\nflavoured, constitutes several preparations sold by the confectioner.\r\n_Barley-sugar_ and _acidulated drops_ are prepared in this way from\r\nwhite sugar: powdered tartaric acid being added to the sugar while\r\nsoft. _Hardbake_ and _toffee_ are made by a similar process from brown\r\nsugar. Toffee differs from hardbake from containing butter. The\r\nornamented sugar pieces, or _caramel_-tops, with which pastrycooks\r\ndecorate their tarts, &c., are prepared in the same way. If the boiled\r\nand yet soft sugar be rapidly and repeatedly extended, and pulled over\r\na hook, it becomes opaque and white, and then constitutes _pulled\r\nsugar_, or _penides_. Pulled sugar, variously flavoured and coloured,\r\nis sold in several forms by the preparers of hard confectionary.\r\n\r\n“Concerning this _hard confectionary_,” Dr. Pereira says, “sugar\r\nconstitutes the base of an almost innumerable variety of hard\r\nconfectionary, sold under the names of _lozenges_, _brilliants_,\r\n_pipe_, _rock_, _comfits_, _nonpareils_, &c. Besides sugar, these\r\npreparations contain some flavouring ingredient, as well as flour\r\nor gum, to give them cohesiveness, and frequently colouring matter.\r\nCarraway, fruits, almonds, and pine seeds, constitute the nuclei of\r\nsome of these preparations.”\r\n\r\nOne of the appliances of the street sweet-stuff trade which I saw in\r\nthe room of the seller before mentioned was--Acts of Parliament. A\r\npile of these, a foot or more deep, lay on a shelf. They are used to\r\nwrap up the rock, &c., sold. The sweet-stuff maker (I never heard them\r\ncalled confectioners) bought his “paper” of the stationers, or at the\r\nold book-shops. Sometimes, he said, he got works in this way in sheets\r\nwhich had never been cut (some he feared were stolen,) and which he\r\nretained to read at his short intervals of leisure, and then used\r\nto wrap his goods in. In this way he had read through two Histories\r\nof England! He maintained a wife, two young children, and a young\r\nsister, who could attend to the stall; his wife assisted him in his\r\nmanufactures. He used 1 cwt. of sugar a week on the year’s average, 1/2\r\ncwt. of treacle, and 5 oz. of scents, each 8_d._ an oz.\r\n\r\nThe man who has the best trade in London streets, is one who, about two\r\nyears ago, introduced--after much study, I was told--short sentences\r\ninto his “sticks.” He boasts of his secret. When snapped asunder, in\r\nany part, the stick presents a sort of coloured inscription. The four\r\nI saw were: “Do you love me?” The next was of less touching character,\r\n“Do you love sprats?” The others were, “Lord Mayor’s Day,” and “Sir\r\nRobert Peel.” This man’s profits are twice those of my respectable\r\ninformant’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CUSTOMERS OF THE SWEET-STUFF STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nAnother sweet-stuff man, originally a baker, but who, for a fortnight\r\nbefore I saw him, had been attending upon an old gentleman, disabled\r\nfrom an accident, gave me the following account of his customers. What\r\nI heard from the other street-sellers satisfies me of the correctness\r\nof the statement. It will be seen that he was possessed of some humour\r\nand observation:\r\n\r\n“Boys and girls are my best customers, sir, and mostly the smallest of\r\nthem; but then, again, some of them’s fifty, aye, turned fifty; Lor’\r\nlove you. An old fellow, that hasn’t a stump of a tooth in front, why,\r\n_he’ll_ stop and buy a ha’porth of hard-bake, and he’ll say, ‘I’ve a\r\ndeal of the boy left about me still.’ He doesn’t show it, anyhow, in\r\nhis look. I’m sometimes a thinking I’ll introduce a softer sort of\r\ntoffy--boiled treacle, such as they call Tom Trot in some parts, but\r\nit’s out of fashion now, just for old people that’s ‘boys still.’ It\r\nwas rolled in a ha’penny stick, sir, and sold stunnin’. The old ones\r\nwants something to suck, and not to chew. Why, when I was a lad at\r\nschool, there was Jews used to go about with boxes on their backs,\r\noffering rings and pencil-cases, and lots of things that’s no real\r\nuse to nobody, and they told everybody they asked to buy ‘that they\r\nsold everything,’ and us boys used to say--‘Then give’s a ha’porth of\r\nboiled treacle.’ It was a regular joke. I wish I’d stuck more to my\r\nbook then, but what can’t be cured must be endured, you know. Now,\r\nthose poor things that walks down there” (intimating, by a motion of\r\nthe head, a thoroughfare frequented by girls of the town), “they’re\r\noften customers, but not near so good as they was ten year ago; no,\r\nindeed, nor six or eight year. _They_ like something that bites in the\r\nmouth, such as peppermint-rock, or ginger-drops. They used to buy a\r\npenn’orth or two and offer it to people, but they don’t now, I think.\r\nI’ve trusted them ha’pennies and pennies, sometimes. They always paid\r\nme. Some that held their heads high like, might say: ‘I really have\r\nno change; I’ll pay you to-morrow.’ She hadn’t no change, poor lass,\r\nsure enough, and she hadn’t nothing to change either, I’ll go bail.\r\nI’ve known women, that seemed working men’s or little shopkeeper’s\r\nwives, buy of me and ask which of my stuffs took greatest hold of the\r\nbreath. I always knew what they was up to. They’d been having a drop,\r\nand didn’t want it to be detected. Why, it was only last Saturday week\r\ntwo niceish-looking and niceish-dressed women, comes up to me, and one\r\nwas going to buy peppermint-rock, and the other says to her: ‘Don’t,\r\nyou fool, he’ll only think you’ve been drinking gin-and-peppermint.\r\nCoffee takes it off best.’ So I lost my customers. They hadn’t had\r\na _single_ drain that night, I’ll go bail, but still they didn’t\r\nlook like regular lushingtons at all. I make farthing’s-worths of\r\nsweet-stuff, for children, but I don’t like it; it’s an injury to\r\ntrade. I _was_ afraid that when half-farthings was coined, they’d\r\ncome among children, and they’d want half a farthing of brandy-balls.\r\nNow, talking of brandy-balls, there’s a gentleman that sometimes has\r\na minute’s chat with me, as he buys a penn’orth to take home to his\r\nchildren--(every reasonable man ought to marry and have children for\r\nthe sake of the sweet-trade, but it ain’t the women’s fault that\r\nmany’s single still)--when one gentleman I knows buys brandy-balls,\r\nhe says, quite grave, ‘What kind o’ brandy do you put in them?’ ‘Not\r\na drop of British,’ says I, ‘I can assure you; not a single drop.’\r\nHe’s not finely dressed; indeed, he’s a leetle seedy, but I know he’s\r\na gentleman, or what’s the same thing, if he ain’t rich; for a common\r\nfellow’ll never have his boots polished that way, every day of his\r\nlife; _his_ blacking bills must come heavy at Christmas. I can tell a\r\ngentleman, too, by his way of talk, ’cause he’s never bumptious. It’s\r\nthe working people’s children that’s my great support, and they was\r\na better support, by 2_s._ in every 10_s._, and more, when times was\r\nbetter; and next to them among my patrons is poor people. Perhaps, this\r\nlast year, I’ve cleared 11_s._ a week, not more, all through. I make my\r\nown stuffs, except the drops, and they require machinery. I would get\r\nout of the streets if I could.”\r\n\r\nAnother of these traders told me, that he took more in farthings, than\r\nin halfpennies or pennies.\r\n\r\nCalculating 200 sweet-stuff sellers, each clearing 10_s._ weekly, the\r\noutlay in rocks, candies, hard-bakes, &c., in the streets is 5,200_l._\r\nyearly, or nearly two and a half millions of halfpenny-worths.\r\n\r\nTo start in the sweet-stuff business requires a capital of 35_s._,\r\nincluding a saucepan in which to boil sugar, 2_s._; weights and scales,\r\n4_s._; stock-money (average), 4_s._; and barrow, 25_s._ If the seller\r\nbe not his own manufacturer, then a tray, 1_s._ 9_d._; and stock-money,\r\n1_s._ 6_d._; or 3_s._ 3_d._ in all will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF COUGH DROPS AND OF MEDICAL CONFECTIONARY.\r\n\r\nMr. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of the People of England”\r\n(1800), says of the Mountebank: “It is uncertain at what period this\r\nvagrant dealer in physic made his appearance in England; it is clear,\r\nhowever, that he figured away with much success in this country\r\nduring the last two centuries.... The mountebanks usually preface\r\nthe vending of their medicines with pompous orations, in which they\r\npay as little regard to truth as to propriety.” I am informed by a\r\ngentleman observant of the matter, that within his knowledge, which\r\nextends to the commencement of the present century, no mountebank\r\n(proper) had appeared in the streets of London proclaiming the virtues\r\nof his medicines; neither with nor without his “fool.” The last\r\nseen by my informant, perhaps the latest mountebank in England, was\r\nabout twenty years ago, in the vicinity of Yarmouth. He was selling\r\n“cough drops” and infallible cures for asthma, and was dressed in a\r\nperiwig and an embroidered coat, with ruffles at his wrist, a sword\r\nto his side, and was a representation, in shabby genteel, of the\r\nfine gentleman of the reign of Queen Anne. The mountebank’s most\r\nlegitimate successor in the street cajolery of London, as regards his\r\n“orations,” is the “Patterer,” as I shall show in my account of the\r\nstreet trade in stationery literature. His successor in the vending of\r\ncurative confectionaries and (in a small degree) of nostrums, salves,\r\nointments, &c., are the sellers of “cough drops” and “horehound candy,”\r\nand of the corn salves, and cures for bruises, sprains, burns, &c.,\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe street-traders in cough drops and their accompaniments,\r\nhowever, do not now exceed six, and of them only two--who are near\r\nrelatives--manufacture their own stock-in-trade. I here treat of the\r\nstreet trade in “cough drops,” as a branch of the itinerant sweet-stuff\r\ntrade. The “mountebank” part of the business--that is to say, “the\r\nprefacing the vending of the medicines with _pompous orations_,” I\r\nshall reserve till its proper place--viz. the “_pattering_” part of the\r\nstreet trade, of which an account will be given in the next Chapter.\r\n\r\nThe two principal vendors of cough drops wheel their stalls, which are\r\nfixed upon barrows, to different parts of town, but one principal stand\r\nis in Holborn. On their boards are displayed the cough cures, both in\r\nthe form of “sticks” and “drops,” and a model of a small distillery.\r\nThe portion inclosing the still is painted to resemble brick-work, and\r\na tin tube, or worm, appears to carry the distillation to a receiver.\r\nHorehound, colts-foot, and some other herbs lie in a dried state on the\r\nstall, but principally horehound, to which popular (street) opinion\r\nseems to attach the most and the greatest virtues. There are also\r\non the stalls a few bottles, tied up in the way they are dispensed\r\nfrom a regular practitioner, while the cough drops are in the form of\r\nsticks (1/2_d._ each), also neatly wrapped in paper. The cry is both\r\nexpressive and simply descriptive--“Long life candy! Candy from herbs!”\r\n\r\nFrom the most experienced person in this curious trade, I had the\r\nfollowing statement. He entertained a full assurance, as far as I\r\ncould perceive, of the excellence of his remedies, and of the high art\r\nand mystery of his calling. In persons of his class, professing to\r\nheal, no matter in what capacity, or what may be the disease, this is\r\nan important element of success. My informant, whether answering my\r\nquestions or speaking of his own accord, always took time to consider,\r\nand sometimes, as will be seen, declined replying to my inquiries. From\r\nhim I received the following account:--\r\n\r\n“The cough drop and herb trade is nothing now to what it was long ago.\r\nThirty or forty years ago, it was as good as 3_l._ or 4_l._ a week to\r\na person, and was carried on by respectable men. I know nothing of\r\nany ‘humbugs’ in the respectable part of the trade. What’s done by\r\nthose who are ignorant, and not respectable, is nothing to me. I don’t\r\nknow how many there were in the trade thirty or forty years ago; but\r\nI know that, ten or eleven years since, I supplied seven persons who\r\nsold cough drops, and such like, in the streets, and now I supply only\r\nmyself and another. I sell only four or five months in the year--the\r\ncold months, in course; for, in the summer, people are not so subject\r\nto coughs and colds. I am the ‘original’ maker of my goods. I will\r\ncure any child of the hooping-cough, and very speedily. I defy any\r\nmedical man to dispute it, and I’ll do it--‘no cure, no pay.’ I never\r\nprofess to cure asthma. Nobody but a gravedigger can put an end to\r\nthat there; but I can relieve it. It’s the same with consumption; it\r\nmay be relieved, but the gravedigger is the only man as can put a\r\nstop to it. Many have tried to do it, but they’ve all failed. I sell\r\nto very respectable people, and to educated people, too; and, what’s\r\nmore, a good deal (of cough drops) to medical men. In course, they can\r\nanalyse it, if they please. They can taste the bitter, and judge for\r\nthemselves, just as they can taste wine in the Docks. Perhaps the wives\r\nof mechanics are among my best customers. They are the most numerous,\r\nbut they buy only ha’porths and penn’orths. Very likely, they would\r\nthink more of the remedy if they had to pay 13-1/2_d._ for it, instead\r\nof the 1-1/2_d._ The Government stamp makes many a stuff sell. Oh! I\r\nknow nothing about quackery: you must inquire at the Stamp-office, if\r\nyou want to know about them kind of medicines. _They’re_ the people\r\nthat help to sell them. Respectable people will pay me 1_s._ or 2_s._\r\nat a time; and those who buy once, buy again. I’m sent to from as far\r\noff as Woolwich. I’ll undertake to cure, or afford relief, in coughs,\r\ncolds, or wind in the chest, or forfeit 1_s._ I can dispel wind in two\r\nminutes. I sell bottles, too, for those cures (as well as the candy\r\nfrom herbs): I manufacture them myself. They’re decoctions of herbs,\r\nand the way to prepare them is my secret. I sell them at from 2_d._\r\nto 1_s._ Why, I use one article that costs 24_s._ a pound, foreign,\r\nand twice that English. I’ve sold hundred weights. The decoctions are\r\nmy secret. I will instruct any person--and have instructed a good\r\nmany--when I’m paid for it. In course, it would never do to publish it\r\nin your work, for thousands would then learn it for 2_d._ My secret was\r\nnever given to any person--only with what you may call a fee--except\r\none, and only to him when he got married, and started in the line. He’s\r\na connection of mine. All _we_ sell is genuine.\r\n\r\n“I sell herbs, too, but it’s not a street sale: I supply them to orders\r\nfrom my connection. It’s not a large trade. I sell horehound, for\r\ntea or decoctions; coltsfoot, for smoking as herb tobacco (I gather\r\nthe coltsfoot myself, but buy the horehound of a shopkeeper, as it’s\r\ncultivated); ground-ivy is sold only for the blood (but little of it);\r\nhyssop for wind; and Irish moss for consumption. I’m never asked for\r\nanything improper. They won’t ask _me_ for ---- or ----. And I’m never\r\nasked for washes or cosmetics; but a few nettles are ordered of me for\r\ncomplexions.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I’d rather not state the quantities I sell, or my profits,\r\nor prices. I make what keeps myself, my wife, and seven children, and\r\nthat’s all I need say about it. I’d rather say no more on that part\r\nof the business: and so, I’m sure you won’t press me. I don’t know\r\nwhat others in the trade make. They buy of confectioners, and are\r\nonly imitators of me. They buy coltsfoot-candy, and such like; how\r\nit’s made so cheap, I don’t know. In the summer, I give up cough-drop\r\nselling, and take to gold fish.”\r\n\r\nI am told that the cough-drop-makers, who are also street-sellers,\r\nprepare their sticks, &c., much in the same method as the manufacturers\r\nof the ordinary sweet-stuff (which I have described), using the\r\ndecoction, generally of horehound or coltsfoot, as the “scents” are\r\nused. In the old times, it would appear that the preparation of a\r\nmedicinal confection was a much more elaborate matter, if we may judge\r\nby the following extract from an obsolete medical work treating of the\r\nmatter. The author styles such preparations “lohochs,” which is an\r\nArabic word, he says, and signifies “a thing to be licked.” It would\r\nappear that the lohoch was not so hard as the present cough-drop. The\r\nfollowing is one of the receipts, “used generally against diseases in\r\nthe breast and lungs:”--\r\n\r\n\r\n “_Lohoch de farfara,” the Lohoch of Coltsfoot._\r\n\r\n Take of coltsfoot roots cleansed 8 ozs., marsh-mallow roots 4 ozs.,\r\n boil them in a sufficient quantity of water, and press the pulp\r\n through a sieve, dissolve it again in the decoction, and let it boil\r\n once or twice; then take it from the fire, and add 2 lbs. of white\r\n sugar, honey of raisins 14 ozs., juice of liquorice 2-1/2 drams, stir\r\n them well with a wooden pestle, sprinkling in of saffron and cloves\r\n in powder, of each 1 scruple, cinnamon and mace, of each 2 scruples;\r\n make them into a lohoch according to art. It is good for a cough and\r\n roughness of the windpipe.\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to infringe upon professional secrets, I may mention\r\nthat the earnings of the principal man in the trade may be taken at\r\n30_s._ a week for 20 weeks; that of another at 15_s._ for the same\r\nperiod; and those of the remaining four at 5_s._ each, weekly; but\r\nthe latter sell acid drops, and other things bought of the chemists.\r\nAllowing the usual cent. per cent., we then find 130_l._ expended by\r\nstreet-buyers on cough-drops.\r\n\r\nThe best cough-drop stall seen in the streets is a kind of barrow,\r\nwhich can be shut up like a piano: it cost 3_l._ 10_s._ complete\r\nwith the distilling apparatus before described. Scales and weights\r\ncost 5_s._, and the stock-money for the supply of such a stall need\r\nnot exceed 10_s._; or, in all, about 4_l._ 10_s._ For an ordinary\r\ntrade--ready-made articles forming the stock--the capital would be,\r\nstall and trestle, 7_s._; scales and weights (which are not always\r\nused), 3_s._ 6_d._, and stock-money, 2_s._ 6_d._; in all, 13_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF ICES AND OF ICE CREAMS.\r\n\r\nI have already treated of the street luxury of pine-apples, and have\r\nnow to deal with the greater street rarity of ice-creams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOCTOR BOKANKY, THE STREET HERBALIST.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]\r\n\r\n “Now then for the Kalibonca Root, that was brought from Madras in\r\n the East Indies. It’ll cure the toothache, head-ache, giddiness in\r\n the head, dimness of sight, rheumatics in the head, and is highly\r\n recommended for the ague; never known to fail; and I’ve sold it for\r\n this six and twenty year. From one penny to sixpence the packet. The\r\n best article in England.”]\r\n\r\nA quick-witted street-seller--but not in the “provision”\r\nline--conversing with me upon this subject, said: “Ices in the streets!\r\nAye, and there’ll be jellies next, and then mock turtle, and then\r\nthe real ticket, sir. I don’t know nothing of the difference between\r\nthe real thing and the mock, but I once had some cheap mock in an\r\neating-house, and it tasted like stewed tripe with a little glue.\r\nYou’ll keep your eyes open, sir, at the Great Exhibition; and you’ll\r\nsee a new move or two in the streets, take my word for it. Penny\r\nglasses of champagne, I shouldn’t wonder.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sanguine anticipations of my street friend, the\r\nsale of ices in the streets has not been such as to offer any great\r\nencouragement to a perseverance in the traffic.\r\n\r\nThe sale of ice-creams was unknown in the streets until last summer,\r\nand was first introduced, as a matter of speculation, by a man who\r\nwas acquainted with the confectionary business, and who purchased his\r\nices of a confectioner in Holborn. He resold these luxuries daily to\r\nstreet-sellers, sometimes to twenty of them, but more frequently to\r\ntwelve. The sale, however, was not remunerative, and had it not been\r\ngenerally united with other things, such as ginger-beer, could not\r\nhave been carried on as a means of subsistence. The supplier of the\r\nstreet-traders sometimes went himself, and sometimes sent another to\r\nsell ice-cream in Greenwich Park on fine summer days, but the sale was\r\nsometimes insufficient to pay his railway expenses. After three or\r\nfour weeks’ trial, this man abandoned the trade, and soon afterwards\r\nemigrated to America.\r\n\r\nNot many weeks subsequent to “the first start,” I was informed, the\r\ntrade was entered into by a street-seller in Petticoat-lane, who\r\nhad become possessed, it was said, of Masters’s Freezing Apparatus.\r\nHe did not vend the ices himself for more than two or three weeks,\r\nand moreover confined his sale to Sunday mornings; after a while he\r\nemployed himself for a short time in making ices for four or five\r\nstreet-sellers, some of whom looked upon the preparation as a wonderful\r\ndiscovery of his own, and he then discontinued the trade.\r\n\r\nThere were many difficulties attending the introduction of ices into\r\nstreet-traffic. The buyers had but a confused notion how the ice was\r\nto be swallowed. The trade, therefore, spread only very gradually, but\r\nsome of the more enterprising sellers purchased stale ices from the\r\nconfectioners. So little, however, were the street-people skilled in\r\nthe trade, that a confectioner told me they sometimes offered ice to\r\ntheir customers in the streets, and could supply only water! Ices were\r\nsold by the street-vendors generally at 1_d._ each, and the trade left\r\nthem a profit of 4_d._ in 1_s._, when they served them “without waste,”\r\nand some of the sellers contrived, by giving smaller modicums, to\r\nenhance the 4_d._ into 5_d._; the profit, however, was sometimes what\r\nis expressively called “nil.” Cent. per cent.--the favourite and simple\r\nrate known in the streets as “half-profits” was rarely attained.\r\n\r\nFrom a street-dealer I received the following account:--\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I mind very well the first time as I ever sold ices. I don’t\r\nthink they’ll ever take greatly in the streets, but there’s no saying.\r\nLord! how I’ve seen the people splutter when they’ve tasted them for\r\nthe first time. I did as much myself. They get among the teeth and\r\nmake you feel as if you tooth-ached all over. I sold mostly strawberry\r\nices. I haven’t an idee how they’re made, but it’s a most wonderful\r\nthing in summer--freezing fruits in that way. One young Irish fellow--I\r\nthink from his look and cap he was a printer’s or stationer’s boy--he\r\nbought an ice of me, and when he had scraped it all together with the\r\nspoon, he made a pull at it as if he was a drinking beer. In course\r\nit was all among his teeth in less than no time, and he stood like\r\na stattey for a instant, and then he roared out,--‘Jasus! I’m kilt.\r\nThe could shivers is on to me!’ But I said, ‘O, you’re all right, you\r\nare;’ and he says, ‘What d’you mane, you horrid horn,[8] by selling\r\nsuch stuff as that. An’ you must have the money first, bad scran to the\r\nlikes o’ you!’\r\n\r\n“The persons what enjoyed their ices most,” the man went on, “was, I\r\nthink, servant maids that gulped them on the sly. Pr’aps they’d been\r\nused, some on ’em, to get a taste of ices on the sly before, in their\r\nservices. We sees a many dodges in the streets, sir--a many. I knew one\r\nsmart servant maid, treated to an ice by her young man--they seemed as\r\nif they was keeping company--and he soon was stamping, with the ice\r\namong his teeth, but she knew how to take hern, put the spoon right\r\ninto the middle of her mouth, and when she’d had a clean swallow she\r\nsays: ‘O, Joseph, why didn’t you ask _me_ to tell you how to eat your\r\nice?’ The conceit of sarvant gals is ridiculous. Don’t you think so,\r\nsir? But it goes out of them when they gets married and has to think of\r\nhow to get broth before how to eat ices. One hot day, about eleven, a\r\nthin tall gentleman, not very young, threw down 1_d._ to me, and says,\r\nsays he, ‘As much ice as you can make for that.’ He knew how to take\r\nit. When he’d done, he says, says he, ‘By G--, my good feller, you’ve\r\nsaved my life. I’ve been keeping it up all night, and I was dying of a\r\nburnt-up throat, after a snooze, and had only 1_d._ So sick and hot was\r\nmy stomach, I could have knelt down and taken a pull at the Thames’--we\r\nwas near it at the time--‘You’ve saved my life, and I’ll see you\r\nagain.’ But I’ve never see’d him since. He was a gentleman, I think. He\r\nwas in black, and wore a big black and gold ring--only one.\r\n\r\n[8] I inquired as to what was meant by the reproachful appellation,\r\n“horrid horn,” and my informant declared that “to the best of his\r\nhearing,” those were the words used; but doubtless the word was\r\n“omad-haun,” signifying in the Erse tongue, a half-witted fellow. My\r\ninformant had often sold fruit to the same lad, and said he had little\r\nof the brogue, or of “old Irish words,” unless “his temper was riz, and\r\nthen it came out powerful.”\r\n\r\n“The rest of my customers for ices, was people that bought out of\r\ncuriosity, and there was gentlemen’s servants among ’em, very little\r\nfellows some of ’em; and doctors’ boys; and mechanics as was young and\r\nseemed of a smartish sort; and boys that seemed like schoolboys; and a\r\nfew women of the town,--but mine’s not much of a pitch for them.”\r\n\r\nFrom the information I obtained, I may state that, if the sale of\r\nstreet ices be calculated at twenty persons _taking_, not earning,\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ daily for four weeks, it is as near the mark as possible.\r\nThis gives an expenditure of 42_l._ in street ices, with a profit to\r\nthe vendors of from 10 to 25 per cent. I am told that an unsuccessful\r\nstart has characterised other street trades--rhubarb for instance, both\r\nin the streets and markets--which have been afterwards successful and\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\nFor capital in the ice trade a small sum was necessary, as the vendors\r\nhad all stalls and sold other commodities, except the “original street\r\nice man,” who was not a regular street trader, but a speculator. A\r\njar--in which the ices were neither sufficiently covered nor kept\r\ncooled, though it was often placed in a vessel or “cooler,” containing\r\ncold water--cost 1_s._, three cups, 3_d._ (or three glasses, 1_s._),\r\nand three spoons, 3_d._, with 2_s._ stock-money; the total is,\r\npresuming glasses were used, 4_s._, or, with a vessel for water, 5_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF EATABLES AND\r\nDRINKABLES.\r\n\r\nI now give a summary of the Capital and Income of the street-sellers of\r\neatables and drinkables. But, first, I will endeavour to arrive at an\r\nestimate of the total number of people belonging to the class.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers engaged in the sale of eatables and drinkables, are,\r\nsumming the several items before given, altogether 6,347: of whom 300\r\nsell pea-soup and hot eels; 150, pickled whelks; 300, fried fish; 300,\r\nsheeps’ trotters; 60, ham-sandwiches; 200, baked ’tatoes; 4, hot green\r\npeas; 150, meat; 25, bread; 1,000, cat and dogs’ meat; 300, coffee\r\nand tea; 1,700, ginger-beer, lemonade, sherbet, &c.; 50, elder-wine;\r\n4, peppermint-water; 28, milk; 100, curds and whey and rice-milk; 60,\r\nwater; 50, pies; 6, boiled pudding; 6, plum “duff”; 150, cakes and\r\ntarts; 4, plum-cakes; 30, other cheaper cakes; 150, gingerbread-nuts;\r\n500, cross-buns; 500, muffins and crumpets; 200, sweet stuff; 6,\r\ncough-drops; 20, ice-creams. But many of the above are only temporary\r\ntrades. The street-sale of hot cross-buns, for instance, lasts only\r\nfor a day; that of muffins and crumpets, baked potatoes, plum-“duff,”\r\ncough-drops, elder-wine, and rice-milk, are all purely winter trades,\r\nwhile the sale of ginger-beer, lemonade, ice-creams, and curds and\r\nwhey, is carried on solely in the summer. By this means the number of\r\nthe street-sellers of eatables and drinkables, never at any one time\r\nreaches the amount before stated. In summer there are, in addition to\r\nthe 10,000 costers before mentioned, about 3,000 people, and in winter\r\nbetween 4,000 and 5,000, engaged in the eatable and drinkable branch of\r\nthe street-traffic.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Capital and Income, many minute accounts have been\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nTo show the care, as well as the fulness with which these returns have\r\nbeen made, I give one of the Tables in its integrity, merely remarking,\r\nthat similar tables relative to all the other articles have been made;\r\nbut I condense the details, lest a repetition, however curious in its\r\nstatistics, should prove wearisome:\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL, OR STOCK IN TRADE, OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF EATABLES AND\r\nDRINKABLES.\r\n\r\n   _Street-sellers of Hot Eels._                £  _s._  _d._\r\n    200 stalls, at 6_s._                         60   0     0\r\n    100 baskets, at 1_s._                         5   0     0\r\n    200 eel-kettles, at 3_s._ 6_d._            35     0     0\r\n    100 jars for itinerants, at 6_d._           2    10     0\r\n    300 stew-pans, at 2_s._                    30     0     0\r\n    300 strainers, at 1_s._                    15     0     0\r\n    300 ladles, at 4_d._                        5     0     0\r\n  2,400 cups, at 1_d._                         10     0     0\r\n  2,400 spoons, at 1_d._                       10     0     0\r\n    200 chafing-dishes, at 6_d._                5     0     0\r\n    200 glasses for candles, at 3_d._           2    10     0\r\n    240 vendors’ stock-money, at 5_s._ each    60     0     0\r\n     60 ditto, at 25_s._ each                  75     0     0\r\n    100 itinerants’ ditto, at 2_s._ each       10     0     0\r\n    300 cloths, at 4_d._ each                   5     0     0\r\n    300 pairs of sleeves, at 4_d._ per pair     5     0     0\r\n    300 aprons at 4_d._ each                    5     0     0\r\n                                             ----------------\r\n                                             £339    10     0\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Pea Soup._\r\n\r\n  150 soup-kettles, 4_s._ each;

and 100 itinerant\r\n  sell 5 lbs. nightly at the public-houses.\r\n  The first mentioned take on an average\r\n  2_s._ daily; the second 16_s._; and the third\r\n  1_s._ 8_d._ This gives a yearly street expenditure\r\n  in the trade in hot eels amounting to                £19,448\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Pea-soup._\r\n\r\n  The annual street consumption of\r\n  pea-soup amounts to 1,680 gallons. 100\r\n  vendors sell each 4 gallons daily; and\r\n  50 vendors, each sell upon an average\r\n  10 gallons daily. The first mentioned\r\n  take 3_s._ a day; and the last, 7_s._ 6_d._\r\n  This gives a street expenditure during\r\n  the winter season of five months, of                  £4,050\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Pickled Whelks._\r\n\r\n  According to the Billingsgate returns,\r\n  there are nearly 5,000,000 of whelks sold\r\n  yearly in the streets of London. These\r\n  are retailed in a boiled state, and\r\n  flavoured with vinegar, at four a penny.\r\n  150 vendors take on an average 13_s._\r\n  weekly. This gives an annual street\r\n  expenditure, of                                       £5,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Fried Fish._\r\n\r\n  150 sellers make 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly, or\r\n  yearly 27_l._ 6_s._; and 150 sellers make\r\n  half that amount, 13_l._ 13_s._ per annum.\r\n  Reckoning 20_l._ a year as a medium\r\n  earning, and adding 90 per cent. for\r\n  profit, the annual consumption of fried\r\n  fish supplied by London street-sellers\r\n  amounts to 684,000 lbs., and the sum\r\n  expended thereupon to                                £11,400\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Sheep’s Trotters._\r\n\r\n  In the wholesale “trotter” establishment\r\n  there are prepared, weekly, 20,000\r\n  sets, or 80,000 feet; giving a yearly\r\n  average of 4,160,000 trotters, or the\r\n  feet of 1,040,000 sheep. Of this quantity\r\n  the street-folk buy seven-eighths, or\r\n  3,640,000 trotters yearly. The number\r\n  of sheep trotter-sellers may be taken at\r\n  300; which gives an average of nearly\r\n  60 sets a week per individual. There\r\n  is then expended yearly in London\r\n  streets on trotters, calculating their\r\n  sale, retail, at 1/2_d._ each, 6,500_l._; but\r\n  though the regular price is 1/2_d._, some\r\n  trotters are sold at four for 1-1/2_d._, very\r\n  few higher than 1/2_d._, and some are kept\r\n  until they are unsaleable, so that the\r\n  amount thus expended may be estimated at              £6,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Ham-sandwiches._\r\n\r\n  60 vendors, take 8_s._ a week, and sell\r\n  annually 486,800 sandwiches, at a cost of             £1,800\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Baked ’Tatoes._\r\n\r\n  300 vendors, sell upon an average\r\n  3/4 cwt. of baked potatoes daily, or 1,755\r\n  tons in the season. The average takings\r\n  of each vendor amount to 6_s._ a day; and\r\n  the receipts of the whole number throughout\r\n  the season (which lasts from the\r\n  latter end of September till March inclusive),\r\n  a period of 6 months, are                            £14,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Street-sellers of Hot Green Peas._\r\n\r\n  The chief man of business sells 3 gallons\r\n  a day (which, at 1_d._ the quarter-pint,\r\n  would be 8_s._, my informant said\r\n  7_s._), the other three together sell the\r\n  same quantity; hence there is an annual\r\n  street consumption of 1,870 gallons, and\r\n  a street expenditure on “hot green peas” of             £250\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Meat._\r\n\r\n  The hawking butchers, taking their\r\n  number at 150, sell 747,000 lbs. of meat,\r\n  and take annually                                    £12,450\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Bread._\r\n\r\n  25 men take 45_s._ a day for five\r\n  months in the summer, and 12 regular\r\n  traders take 1_l._ 12_s._ per day; this gives\r\n  an annual street consumption of 700,000\r\n  quartern loaves of bread, and a street\r\n  expenditure of                                        £9,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Cats and Dogs’ Meat._\r\n\r\n  There are 300,000 cats in the metropolis,\r\n  and from 900 to 1,000 horses,\r\n  averaging 2 cwt. of meat each, boiled\r\n  down every week; the quantity of cats’\r\n  and dogs’ meat used throughout London\r\n  is about 200,000 lbs. per week,\r\n  and this, sold at the rate of 2-1/2_d._ per lb.,\r\n  gives 2,000_l._ a week for the money spent\r\n  in cats’ and dogs’ meat, or per year,\r\n  upwards of                                          £100,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Coffee, Tea, &c._\r\n\r\n  Each coffee-stall keeper on an average\r\n  clears 1_l._ a week, and his takings may\r\n  be said to be at least double that sum;\r\n  hence the quantity of coffee sold annually\r\n  in the streets, is about 550,000 gallons,\r\n  while the yearly street expenditure\r\n  for tea, coffee, &c., amounts to                     £31,200\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Ginger-beer._\r\n\r\n  The bottles of ginger-beer sold yearly\r\n  in the streets number about 4,798,000,\r\n  and the total street consumption of the\r\n  same beverage may be said to be about\r\n  250,000 gallons per annum. 200 street-sellers\r\n  of ginger-beer in the bottle trade\r\n  of the penny class take 30_s._ a week each\r\n  (thus allowing for inferior receipts in\r\n  bad weather); 300 take 20_s._ each, selling\r\n  their “beer” for the most part at 1/2_d._ the\r\n  bottle, while the remaining 400 “in a\r\n  small way” take 6_s._ each; hence there\r\n  is expended in the bottled ginger-beer\r\n  of the streets 11,480_l._ Adding the receipts\r\n  from the fountains and the barrels,\r\n  the barrel season continuing only ten\r\n  weeks, the total sum expended annually\r\n  in street ginger-beer amounts altogether to          £14,660\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Lemonade, Sherbet, Nectar, &c._\r\n\r\n  There are 200 persons, chiefly men,\r\n  selling solely lemonade, &c., and an\r\n  additional 300 uniting the sale with that\r\n  of ginger-beer. Their average receipts\r\n  on fine days are 3_s._ 6_d._ a day, or, allowing\r\n  for wet weather and diminished receipts,\r\n  10_s._ a week. The receipts, then, for this\r\n  street luxury, show a street expenditure\r\n  in such a summer as the last, of 2,800_l._,\r\n  among those who do not unite ginger-beer\r\n  with the trade. Calculating that\r\n  those who _do_ unite ginger-beer with it\r\n  sell only one-half as much as the others,\r\n  we find a total outlay of                             £4,900\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Elder-wine._\r\n\r\n  50 vendors clear 5_s._ a week for 16\r\n  weeks by the sale of elder-wine in the\r\n  streets, their profit being at least cent.\r\n  per cent.; hence the street consumption\r\n  of this beverage in the course of the year\r\n  is 1,500 gallons, and the outlay                        £200\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Peppermint-water._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 4 “pepperminters”\r\n  take 2_s._ a day the year round, Sundays\r\n  excepted, we find that 900 gallons of\r\n  peppermint-water are consumed every\r\n  year in the streets of London, while the\r\n  sum expended in it amounts annually to                  £125\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Milk in the Markets, Parks, &c._\r\n\r\n  The vendors in the markets clear\r\n  about 1_s._ 6_d._ a day each, for three\r\n  months; and as the profit is rather\r\n  more than cent. per cent., there are\r\n  about 4,000 gallons of milk thus sold\r\n  yearly. The quantity sold in the park\r\n  averages 20 quarts a day for a period of\r\n  nine months, or 1,170 gallons in the\r\n  year. This is retailed at 4_d._ per quart;\r\n  hence the annual expenditure is                         £344\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Curds and Whey._\r\n\r\n  50 sellers dispose of 12-1/2 gallons in 3\r\n  weeks; the other 50 sell only half as\r\n  much. Taking the season at 3 months,\r\n  the annual consumption of curds and\r\n  whey in the streets is 2,812 double gallons\r\n  (as regards the ingredients of milk),\r\n  which is retailed at a cost to the purchasers\r\n  of                                                      £412\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Rice-milk._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 50 sellers dispose of\r\n  24 quarts weekly, while one-half of the\r\n  remaining 25 sell 12 quarts each per\r\n  week at 1_d._ the half-pint, and the other\r\n  half vend 24 quarts at 1/2_d._ the half-pint,\r\n  there are about 3,000 gallons of\r\n  rice-milk yearly consumed in the streets\r\n  of London, while the expenditure\r\n  amounts to                                              £320\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water-carriers._\r\n\r\n  The number of water-carriers are\r\n  sixty, and their average earnings through\r\n  the year 5_s._ a week; hence the sum annually\r\n  expended in water thus obtained\r\n  amounts to                                              £780\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street Piemen._\r\n\r\n  There are fifty street piemen plying\r\n  their trade in London, the year through,\r\n  their average takings are one guinea a\r\n  week; hence there is an annual street\r\n  consumption of pies of nearly to three-quarters\r\n  of a million, and a street expenditure\r\n  amounting to                                          £3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Meat and Currant Puddings._\r\n\r\n  Each street-seller gets rid of, on an\r\n  average, 85 dozen, or 1,020 puddings;\r\n  there are now but six street-sellers (regularly)\r\n  of these comestibles; hence the\r\n  weekly aggregate would be--allowing\r\n  for bad weather--5,400, and the total\r\n  129,600 meat and currant puddings sold\r\n  in the streets, in a season of 24 weeks.\r\n  This gives an annual expenditure on\r\n  the part of the street boys and girls\r\n  (who are the principal purchasers), and\r\n  of the poor persons who patronise the\r\n  street-trade, of about                                  £270\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Plum “duff.”_\r\n\r\n  Calculating 42_s._ a week as the takings\r\n  of six persons, for five months, we find\r\n  there is yearly expended in the street\r\n  purchase of plum dough upwards of                       £250\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Cakes, Tarts, &c._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning 150 cake-sellers, each\r\n  taking 6_s._ a week--a sufficiently low\r\n  average--the street consumption of\r\n  cakes, tarts, &c., will be 1,123,200 every\r\n  year, and the street outlay about                     £2,350\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of other and inferior Cakes._\r\n\r\n  The sale of the inferior street cakes\r\n  realises about a fifth of that taken by\r\n  the other cake-sellers; hence it may be\r\n  estimated yearly at                                     £450\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Gingerbread-nuts._\r\n\r\n  150 gingerbread-nut-sellers take 17_s._\r\n  each weekly (clearing 9_s._); at this rate\r\n  the sum spent yearly in “spice” nuts\r\n  in the streets of London amounts to                   £6,630\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Hot-cross Buns._\r\n\r\n  There are nearly 100,000 hot-cross\r\n  buns sold every Good Friday in the\r\n  streets of London; hence there is expended\r\n  in one day, upon the buns thus\r\n  bought about                                            £300\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Muffins and Crumpets._\r\n\r\n  There are 500 muffin-sellers, each\r\n  clearing 4_s._ and taking 12_s._ a week on\r\n  an average; hence the metropolitan\r\n  street sale of muffins and crumpets will\r\n  be in 20 weeks about 120,000 dozen,\r\n  and the sum expended thereon                          £6,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Sweet-stuff._\r\n\r\n  The number of sweet-stuff sellers in\r\n  London amounts to 200, each of whom,\r\n  on an average, clears 10_s._, and takes 20_s._\r\n  weekly; the yearly consumption, therefore,\r\n  of rocks, candies, hard-bakes, &c.,\r\n  purchased in the streets is nearly two\r\n  and a half millions of halfpenny-worths,\r\n  or (at the rate of 1/2_d._ an ounce) about\r\n  70 tons weight per annum, costing the\r\n  consumers about                                      £10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Cough-drops._\r\n\r\n  The earnings of the principal man in\r\n  the “cough-drop” street trade may be\r\n  taken at 30_s._ a week for twenty weeks;\r\n  that of another at 15_s._ for the same\r\n  period; and those of the remaining four\r\n  street-sellers of the same compound at\r\n  5_s._ each, weekly; allowing the usual\r\n  cent. per cent., we find there is annually\r\n  expended by street-buyers on cough-drops                £130\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Ice Creams._\r\n\r\n  The sale of street ices may be calculated\r\n  at twenty persons, taking 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n  daily for four weeks. This gives a street\r\n  consumption of 10,000 penny ices, and\r\n  an annual expenditure thereon of                         £42\r\n                                                      --------\r\n  TOTAL SUM EXPENDED YEARLY\r\n  ON STREET EATABLES AND DRINKABLES                   £203,115\r\n                                                      --------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF STATIONERY, LITERATURE, AND THE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to a class of street-folk wholly distinct from any before\r\ntreated of. As yet we have been dealing principally with the uneducated\r\nportion of the street-people--men whom, for the most part, are allowed\r\nto remain in nearly the same primitive and brutish state as the\r\nsavage--creatures with nothing but their appetites, instincts, and\r\npassions to move them, and made up of the same crude combination of\r\nvirtue and vice--the same generosity combined with the same predatory\r\ntendencies as the Bedouins of the desert--the same love of revenge and\r\ndisregard of pain, and often the same gratitude and susceptibility to\r\nkindness as the Red Indian--and, furthermore, the same insensibility\r\nto female honour and abuse of female weakness, and the same utter\r\nignorance of the Divine nature of the Godhead as marks either\r\nBosjesman, Carib, or Thug.\r\n\r\nThe costers and many other of the street-sellers before described,\r\nhowever, are bad--not so much from their own perversity as from our\r\nselfishness. That they partake of the natural evil of human nature is\r\nnot their fault but ours,--who would be like them if we had not been\r\ntaught by others better than ourselves to controul the bad and cherish\r\nthe good principles of our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of stationery, literature, and the fine arts,\r\nhowever, differ from all before treated of in the _general_, though\r\nfar from universal, education of the sect. They constitute principally\r\nthe class of street-orators, known in these days as “patterers,” and\r\nformerly termed “mountebanks,”--people who, in the words of Strutt,\r\nstrive to “help off their wares by pompous speeches, in which little\r\nregard is paid either to truth or propriety.” To patter, is a slang\r\nterm, meaning to speak. To indulge in this kind of oral puffery, of\r\ncourse, requires a certain exercise of the intellect, and it is the\r\nconsciousness of their mental superiority which makes the patterers\r\nlook down upon the costermongers as an inferior body, with whom they\r\nobject either to be classed or to associate. The scorn of some of the\r\n“patterers” for the mere costers is as profound as the contempt of the\r\npickpocket for the pure beggar. Those who have not witnessed this pride\r\nof class among even the most degraded, can form no adequate idea of\r\nthe arrogance with which the skilled man, no matter how base the art,\r\nlooks upon the unskilled. “We are the haristocracy of the streets,”\r\nwas said to me by one of the street-folks, who told penny fortunes\r\nwith a bottle. “People don’t pay us for what we gives ’em, but only\r\nto hear us talk. We live like yourself, sir, by the hexercise of our\r\nhintellects--we by talking, and you by writing.”\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the self-esteem of the patterers, I am inclined\r\nto think that they are less impressionable and less susceptible of\r\nkindness than the costers whom they despise. Dr. Conolly has told\r\nus that, even among the insane, the educated classes are the most\r\ndifficult to move and govern through their affections. They are\r\ninvariably suspicious, attributing unworthy motives to every benefit\r\nconferred, and consequently incapable of being touched by any sympathy\r\non the part of those who may be affected by their distress. So far\r\nas my experience goes it is the same with the street-patterers. Any\r\nattempt to befriend them is almost sure to be met with distrust. Nor\r\ndoes their mode of life serve in any way to lessen their misgivings.\r\nConscious how much their own livelihood depends upon assumption and\r\ntrickery, they naturally consider that others have some “dodge,” as\r\nthey call it, or some latent object in view when any good is sought\r\nto be done them. The impulsive costermonger, however, approximating\r\nmore closely to the primitive man, moved solely by his feelings, is as\r\neasily humanized by any kindness as he is brutified by any injury.\r\n\r\nThe patterers, again, though certainly more intellectual, are scarcely\r\nless immoral than the costers. Their superior cleverness gives them\r\nthe power of justifying and speciously glossing their evil practices,\r\nbut serves in no way to restrain them; thus affording the social\r\nphilosopher another melancholy instance of the evil of developing the\r\nintellect without the conscience--of teaching people to _know_ what is\r\nmorally beautiful and ugly, without teaching them at the same time to\r\nfeel and delight in the one and abhor the other--or, in other words, of\r\nquickening the cunning and checking the emotions of the individual.\r\n\r\nAmong the patterers marriage is as little frequent as among the\r\ncostermongers; with the exception of the older class, who “were perhaps\r\nmarried before they took to the streets.” Hardly one of the patterers,\r\nhowever, has been bred to a street life; and this constitutes another\r\nline of demarcation between them and the costermongers.\r\n\r\nThe costers, we have seen, are mostly hereditary wanderers--having been\r\nas it were born to frequent the public thoroughfares; some few of the\r\nitinerant dealers in fish, fruit, and vegetables, have it is true been\r\ndriven by want of employment to adopt street-selling as a means of\r\nliving, but these are, so to speak, the aliens rather than the natives\r\nof the streets. The patterers, on the other hand, have for the most\r\npart neither been born and bred nor driven to a street life--but have\r\nrather _taken_ to it from a natural love of what they call “roving.”\r\nThis propensity to lapse from a civilized into a nomad state--to pass\r\nfrom a settler into a wanderer--is a peculiar characteristic of the\r\npattering tribe. The tendency however is by no means extraordinary;\r\nfor ethnology teaches us, that whereas many abandon the habits of\r\ncivilized life to adopt those of a nomadic state of existence, but few\r\nof the wandering tribes give up vagabondising and betake themselves to\r\nsettled occupations. The innate “love of a roving life,” which many of\r\nthe street-people themselves speak of as the cause of their originally\r\ntaking to the streets, appears to be accompanied by several peculiar\r\ncharacteristics; among the most marked of these are an indomitable\r\n“self-will” or hatred of the least restraint or controul--an innate\r\naversion to every species of law or government, whether political,\r\nmoral, or domestic--a stubborn, contradictory nature--an incapability\r\nof continuous labour, or remaining long in the same place occupied\r\nwith the same object, or attending to the same subject--an unusual\r\npredilection for amusements, and especially for what partakes of the\r\nludicrous--together with a great relish of all that is ingenious, and\r\nso finding extreme delight in tricks and frauds of every kind. There\r\nare two patterers now in the streets (brothers)--well-educated and\r\nrespectably connected--who candidly confess they prefer that kind of\r\nlife to any other, and would not leave it if they could.\r\n\r\nNor are the patterers less remarkable than the costermongers for\r\ntheir utter absence of all religious feeling. There is, however, this\r\ndistinction between the two classes--that whereas the creedlessness\r\nof the one is but the consequence of brutish ignorance, that of the\r\nother is the result of natural perversity and educated scepticism--as\r\nthe street-patterers include many men of respectable connections, and\r\neven classical attainments. Among them, may be found the son of a\r\nmilitary officer, a clergyman, a man brought up to the profession of\r\nmedicine, two Grecians of the Blue-coat School, clerks, shopmen, and\r\na class who have been educated to no especial calling--some of the\r\nlatter being the natural sons of gentlemen and noblemen--and who, when\r\ndeprived of the support of their parents or friends, have taken to the\r\nstreets for bread. Many of the younger and smarter men, I am assured,\r\nreside with women of the town, though they may not be dependent for\r\ntheir livelihood on the wages got by the infamy of these women. Not a\r\nfew of the patterers, too, in their dress and appearance, present but\r\nlittle difference to that of the “gent.” Some wear a moustache, while\r\nothers indulge in a Henri-Quatre beard. The patterers are, moreover,\r\nas a body, not distinguished by that good and friendly feeling one\r\nto another which is remarkable among costermongers. If an absence of\r\nheartiness and good fellowship be characteristic of an aristocracy--as\r\nsome political philosophers contend--then the patterers may indeed be\r\nsaid to be the aristocrats of the streets.\r\n\r\nThe patterers or oratorical street-sellers include among their class\r\nmany itinerant traders, other than the wandering “paper-workers”--as\r\nthose vending the several varieties of street-literature are generally\r\ndenominated. The Cheap Jacks, or oratorical hucksters of hardware at\r\nfairs and other places, are among the most celebrated and humorous of\r\nthis class. The commercial arts and jests of some of these people,\r\ndisplay considerable cleverness. Many of their jokes, it is true, are\r\ntraditional--and as purely a matter of parrotry as the witticisms of\r\nthe “funny gentlemen” on the stage, but their ready adaptation of\r\naccidental circumstances to the purposes of their business, betrays a\r\nmodicum of wit far beyond that which falls to the share of ordinary\r\n“low comedians.” The street-vendors of cough drops--infallible cures\r\nfor the toothache and other ailments--also belong to the pattering\r\nclass. These are, as was before stated, the remains of the obsolete\r\nmountebanks of England and the _saltinbanque_ of France--a class of\r\n_al fresco_ orators who derived their names from the _bench_--the\r\nstreet pulpit, rostrum, or platform--that they ascended, in order\r\nthe better to deliver their harangues. The street jugglers, actors,\r\nand showmen, as well as the street-sellers of grease-removing\r\ncompositions, corn-salve, razor-paste, plating-balls, waterproof\r\nblacking, rat poisons, sovereigns sold for wagers, and a multiplicity\r\nof similar street-trickeries--such as oratorical begging--are other\r\ningenious and wordy members of the same chattering, jabbering, or\r\n“pattering” fraternity. These will all be spoken of under the head of\r\nthe different things they respectively sell or do. For the present\r\nwe have only to deal with that portion of the “pattering” body who\r\nare engaged in the street sale of literature--or the “paper-workers”\r\nas they call themselves. The latter include the “running patterers,”\r\nor “death-hunters;” being men (no women) engaged in vending last\r\ndying speeches and confessions--in hawking “se-cond edi-tions” of\r\nnewspapers--or else in “working,” that is to say, in getting rid of\r\nwhat are technically termed “cocks;” which, in polite language, means\r\naccounts of fabulous duels between ladies of fashion--of apocryphal\r\nelopements, or fictitious love-letters of sporting noblemen and\r\ncertain young milliners not a hundred miles from the spot--“cooked”\r\nassassinations and sudden deaths of eminent individuals--pretended\r\njealous affrays between Her Majesty and the Prince Consort (but these\r\npapers are now never worked)--or awful tragedies, including mendacious\r\nmurders, impossible robberies, and delusive suicides.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of these choice articles, however, belong more particularly\r\nto that order or species of the pattering genus known as “running\r\npatterers,” or “flying stationers,” from the fact of their being\r\ncontinually on the move while describing the attractions of the\r\n“papers” they have to sell. Contradistinguished from them, however,\r\nare the “standing patterers,” or those for whose less startling\r\nannouncements a crowd is necessary, in order that the audience may\r\nhave time to swallow the many marvels worked by their wares. The\r\nstanding patterers require, therefore, what they term a “pitch,” that\r\nis to say a fixed locality, where they can hold forth to a gaping\r\nmultitude for, at least, some few minutes continuously. They are mainly\r\nsuch street-sellers as deal in nostrums and the different kinds of\r\nstreet “wonders.” Occasionally, however, the running patterer (who\r\nis especially literary) transmigrates into a standing one, betaking\r\nhimself to “board work,” as it is termed in street technology, and\r\nstopping at the corners of thoroughfares with a large pictorial placard\r\nraised upon a pole, and glowing with a highly-coloured exaggeration\r\nof the interesting terrors of the pamphlet he has for sale. This\r\nis either “The Life of Calcraft, the Hangman,” “The Diabolical\r\nPractices of Dr. ---- on his Patients when in a state of Mesmerism,”\r\nor “The Secret Doings at the White House, Soho,” and other similar\r\nattractively-repulsive details. Akin to this “board work” is the\r\npractice of what is called “strawing,” or selling straws in the\r\nstreet, and giving away with them something that is either really or\r\nfictionally forbidden to be sold,--as indecent papers, political songs,\r\nand the like. This practice, however, is now seldom resorted to, while\r\nthe sale of “secret papers” is rarely carried on in public. It is\r\ntrue, there are three or four patterers who live chiefly by professing\r\nto dispose of “sealed packets” of obscene drawings and cards for\r\ngentlemen; but this is generally a trick adopted to extort money from\r\nold debauchees, young libertines, and people of degraded or diseased\r\ntastes; for the packets, on being opened, seldom contain anything\r\nbut an odd number of some defunct periodical. There is, however, a\r\nlarge traffic in such secret papers carried on in what is called “the\r\npublic-house trade,” that is to say, by itinerant “paper-workers”\r\n(mostly women), who never make their appearance in the streets, but\r\nobtain a livelihood by “busking,” as it is technically termed, or, in\r\nother words, by offering their goods for sale only at the bars and\r\nin the tap-rooms and parlours of taverns. The excessive indulgence\r\nof one appetite is often accompanied by the disease of a second; the\r\ndrunkard, of course, is supereminently a sensualist, and is therefore\r\neasily taken by anything that tends to stimulate his exhausted desires:\r\nso sure is it that one form of bestiality is a necessary concomitant\r\nof another. There is another species of patterer, who, though\r\nusually included among the standing patterers, belongs rather to an\r\nintermediate class, viz., those who neither stand nor “_run_,” as they\r\ndescant upon what they sell; but those walk at so slow a rate that,\r\nthough never stationary, they can hardly be said to move. These are the\r\nreciters of dialogues, litanies, and the various street “squibs” upon\r\npassing events; they also include the public propounders of conundrums,\r\nand the “hundred and fifty popular song” enumerators--such as are\r\nrepresented in the engraving here given. Closely connected with them\r\nare the “chaunters,” or those who do not cry, but (if one may so far\r\nstretch the English language) _sing_ the contents of the “papers” they\r\nvend.\r\n\r\nThese traffickers constitute the principal street-sellers of\r\nliterature, or “paper-workers,” of the “pattering” class. In addition\r\nto them there are many others vending “papers” in the public\r\nthoroughfares, who are mere traders resorting to no other acts for\r\nthe disposal of their goods than a simple cry or exposition of them;\r\nand many of these are but poor, humble, struggling, and inoffensive\r\ndealers. They do not puff or represent what they have to sell as what\r\nit is not--(allowing them a fair commercial latitude). They are not\r\nof the “enterprising” class of street tradesmen. Among these are the\r\nstreet-sellers of stationery--such as note-paper, envelopes, pens,\r\nink, pencils, sealing-wax, and wafers. Belonging to the same class,\r\ntoo, are the street-vendors of almanacs, pocket-books, memorandum and\r\naccount-books. Then there are the sellers of odd numbers of periodicals\r\nand broadsheets, and those who vend either playing cards, conversation\r\ncards, stenographic cards, and (at Epsom, Ascot, &c.) racing cards.\r\nBesides these, again, there are the vendors of illustrated cards, such\r\nas those embellished with engravings of the Crystal Palace, Views of\r\nthe Houses of Parliament, as well as the gelatine poetry cards--all\r\nof whom, with the exception of the racing-card sellers (who belong\r\ngenerally to the pattering tribe), partake of the usual characteristics\r\nof the street-selling class.\r\n\r\nAfter these may be enumerated the vendors of old engravings out of\r\ninverted umbrellas, and the hawkers of coloured pictures in frames.\r\nThen there are the old book-stalls and barrows, and “the pinners-up,”\r\nas they are termed, or sellers of old songs pinned against the wall,\r\nas well as the vendors of manuscript music. Moreover, appertaining to\r\nthe same class, there are the vendors of playbills and “books of the\r\nperformance” outside the theatre; and lastly, the pretended sellers of\r\ntracts--such as the Lascars and others, who use this kind of street\r\ntraffic as a cloak for the more profitable trade of begging. The\r\nstreet-sellers of images, although strictly comprised within those who\r\nvend fine art productions in the public thoroughfares will be treated\r\nof under the head of THE STREET ITALIANS, to which class they mostly\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FORMER AND PRESENT STREET-PATTERERS.\r\n\r\nOf the street-patterers the running (or flying) trader announces the\r\ncontents of the paper he is offering for sale, as he proceeds on his\r\nmission. It is usually the detail of some “barbarious and horrible\r\nmurder,” or of some extraordinary occurrence--such as the attack\r\non Marshal Haynau--which has roused public attention; or the paper\r\nannounced as descriptive of a murder, or of some exciting event, may in\r\nreality be some odd number of a defunct periodical. “It’s astonishing,”\r\nsaid one patterer to me, “how few people ever complain of having been\r\ntook in. It hurts their feelings to lose a halfpenny, but it hurts\r\ntheir pride too much, when they’re had, to grumble in public about it.”\r\nOn this head, then, I need give no further general explanation.\r\n\r\nIn times of excitement the running patterer (or “stationer,” as he was\r\nand is sometimes called) has reaped the best harvest. When the Popish\r\nplot agitated England in the reign of Charles II. the “Narratives” of\r\nthe design of a handful of men to assassinate a whole nation, were\r\neagerly purchased in the streets and taverns. And this has been the\r\ncase during the progress of any absorbing event subsequently. I was\r\ntold by a very old gentleman, who had heard it from his grandfather,\r\nthat in some of the quiet towns of the north of England, in Durham\r\nand Yorkshire, there was the greatest eagerness to purchase from the\r\nstreet-sellers any paper relative to the progress of the forces under\r\nCharles Edward Stuart, in 1745. This was especially the case when it\r\nbecame known that the “rebels” had gained possession of Carlisle, and\r\nit was uncertain what might be their route southward. About the period\r\nof the “affair of the ’45,” and in the autumn following the decisive\r\nbattle of Culloden (in April, 1746), the “Northern Lights” were more\r\nthan usually brilliant, or more than usually remarked, and a meteor or\r\ntwo had been seen. The street-sellers were then to be found in fairs\r\nand markets, vending wonderful accounts of these wonderful phenomena.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the character of the old mountebank, and\r\nto his “pompous orations,” having “as little regard to truth as to\r\npropriety.” There certainly is little pompousness in the announcements\r\nof the patterers, though in their general disregard of truth they\r\nresemble those of the mountebank. The mountebank, however, addressed\r\nhis audience from a stage, and made his address attractive by mixing up\r\nwith it music, dancing, and tumbling; sometimes, also, equestrianism\r\non the green of a village; and by having always the services of a\r\nmerry-andrew, or clown. The nostrums of these quacks were all as\r\nunequalled for cheapness as for infallibility, and their impudence\r\nand coolness ensured success. Their practices are as well exposed in\r\nsome of the _Spectators_ of 1711-12 as the puppet-playing of Powel was\r\ngood-humouredly ridiculed. One especial instance is cited, where a\r\nmountebank, announcing himself a native of Hammersmith, where he was\r\nholding forth, offered to make a present of 5_s._ to every brother\r\nnative of Hammersmith among his audience. The mountebank then drew from\r\na long bag a handful of little packets, each of which, he informed the\r\nspectators, was constantly sold for 5_s._ 6_d._, but that out of love\r\nto his native hamlet he would bate the odd 5_s._ to every inhabitant\r\nof the place. The whole assembly immediately closed with his generous\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nThere is a scene in Moncrieff’s popular farce of “_Rochester_,” where\r\nthe hero personates a mountebank, which may be here cited as affording\r\na good idea of the “pompous orations” indulged in by the street orators\r\nin days of yore:\r\n\r\n “Silence there, and hear me, for my words are more precious than\r\n gold; I am the renowned and far-famed Doctor Paracelsus Bombastes\r\n Esculapus Galen dam Humbug von Quack, member of all the colleges under\r\n the Moon: M.D., L.M.D., F.R.S., L.L.D., _A.S.S._--and all the rest\r\n of the letters in the alphabet: I am the seventh son of a seventh\r\n son--kill or cure is my motto--and I always do it; I cured the great\r\n Emperor of Nova Scotia, of a polypus, after he had been given over\r\n by all the faculty--he lay to all appearance dead; the first pill he\r\n took, he opened his eyes; the second, he raised his head; and the\r\n third, he jumped up and danced a hornpipe. I don’t want to sound\r\n my own praise--blow the trumpet, Balaam (_Balaam blows trumpet_);\r\n but I tapped the great Cham of Tartary at a sitting, of a terrible\r\n dropsy, so that I didn’t leave a drop in him! I cure the palsy, the\r\n dropsy, the lunacy, and all the sighs, without costing anybody a sigh;\r\n vertigo, pertigo, lumbago, and all the other go’s are sure to go,\r\n whenever I come.”\r\n\r\nIn his unscrupulousness and boldness in street announcements, and\r\nsometimes in his humour and satire, we find the patterer of the present\r\nday to be the mountebank of old descended from his platform into the\r\nstreets--but without his music, his clown, or his dress.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly, also, another class, differing little from the\r\nhabits of that variety of patterers of the present day who “busk” it,\r\nor “work the public-houses.”\r\n\r\n “The jestours,” says Mr. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of the\r\n People of England,” “or, as the word is often written in the old\r\n English dialect, ‘gesters,’ were the relaters of the gestes, that is,\r\n the actions of famous persons, whether fabulous or real; and these\r\n stories were of two kinds, the one to excite pity, and the other to\r\n move laughter, as we learn from Chaucer:\r\n\r\n  ‘And jestours that tellen tales,\r\n  Both of wepying and of game.’\r\n\r\n The tales of ‘game,’ as the poet expresses himself were short jocular\r\n stories calculated to promote merriment, in which the reciters paid\r\n little respect to the claims of propriety or even of common decency.\r\n The tales of ‘game,’ however, were much more popular than those\r\n of weeping, and probably for the very reason that ought to have\r\n operated the most powerfully for their suppression. The gestours,\r\n whose powers were chiefly employed in the hours of conviviality,\r\n finding by experience that lessons of instruction were much less\r\n seasonable at such times, than idle tales productive of mirth and\r\n laughter, accommodated their narrations to the general taste of the\r\n times, regardless of the mischiefs they occasioned by vitiating the\r\n morals of their hearers. Hence it is that the author of the ‘Vision\r\n of Pierce the Ploughman’ calls them contemptibly ‘japers and juglers,\r\n and janglers of gests.’ He describes them as haunters of taverns\r\n and common ale-houses, amusing the lower classes of the people with\r\n ‘myrth of minstrelsy and losels’ tales,’ (loose vulgar tales,) and\r\n calls them tale-tellers and ‘tutelers in ydell,’ (tutors of idleness,)\r\n occasioning their auditory, ‘for love of tales, in tavernes to drink,’\r\n where they learned from them to jangle and to jape, instead of\r\n attending to their more serious duties.\r\n\r\n “The japers, I apprehend, were the same as the bourdours, or\r\n rybauders, an inferior class of minstrels, and properly called jesters\r\n in the modern acceptation of the word; whose wit, like that of the\r\n merry-andrews of the present day (1800) consisted in low obscenity\r\n accompanied with ludicrous gesticulation. They sometimes, however,\r\n found admission into the houses of the opulent. Knighton, indeed,\r\n mentions one of these japers who was a favourite in the English court,\r\n and could obtain any grant from the king ‘a burdando,’ that is, by\r\n jesting. They are well described by the poet:\r\n\r\n  ‘As japers and janglers, Judas’ chyldren,\r\n  Fayneth them fantasies, and fooles them maketh.’\r\n\r\n “It was a very common and a very favourite amusement, so late as\r\n the 16th century, to hear the recital of verses and moral speeches,\r\n learned for that purpose by a set of men who obtained their livelihood\r\n thereby, and who, without ceremony, intruded themselves, not only into\r\n taverns and other places of public resort, but also into the houses of\r\n the nobility.”\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the modern patterer to the classes above mentioned\r\nwill be seen when I describe the public-house actor and reciter of the\r\npresent day, as well as the standing patterer, who does not differ so\r\nmuch from the running patterer in the quality of his announcements,\r\nas in his requiring more time to make an impression, and being indeed\r\na sort of lecturer needing an audience; also of the present reciters\r\n“of verses and moral speeches.” But of these curious classes I shall\r\nproceed to treat separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HABITS, OPINIONS, MORALS, AND RELIGION OF PATTERERS GENERALLY.\r\n\r\nIn order that I might omit nothing which will give the student of\r\nthat curious phase of London life in London streets--the condition\r\nof the patterers--a clear understanding of the subject, I procured\r\nthe following account from an educated gentleman (who has been before\r\nalluded to in this work), and as he had been driven to live among the\r\nclass he describes, and to support himself by street-selling, his\r\nremarks have of course all the weight due to personal experience, as\r\nwell as to close observation:--\r\n\r\n“If there is any truth in phrenology,” writes the gentleman in\r\nquestion, “the patterers--to a man--are very large in the organ of\r\n‘self-esteem,’ from which suggestion an enquiry arises, viz., whether\r\nthey possess that of which they may justly pique themselves. To arrive\r\nat truth about the patterers is very difficult, and indeed the persons\r\nwith whom they live are often quite in the dark about the history, or\r\nin some cases the pursuits of their lodgers.\r\n\r\n“I think that the patterers may be divided into three classes.\r\nFirst,--those who were well born and brought up. Secondly,--those\r\nwhose parents have been dissipated and gave them little education.\r\nThirdly,--those who--whatever their early history--will not be or do\r\nanything but what is of an itinerant character. I shall take a glance\r\nat the _first_ of these classes, presupposing that they were cradled in\r\nthe lap of indulgence, and trained to science and virtue.\r\n\r\n“If these people take to the streets, they become, with here and there\r\nan exception, the most reprobate and the least reclaimable. I was\r\nonce the inmate of a lodging-house, in which there were at one time\r\nfive University-men, three surgeons, and several sorts of broken-down\r\nclerks, or of other professional men. Their general habits were\r\ndemoralised to the last degree--their oaths more horrid, extravagant,\r\nand far-fetched than anything I ever heard: they were stupid in logic,\r\nbut very original in obscenity. Most of them scoffed at the Bible,\r\nor perverted its passages to extenuate fraud, to justify violence,\r\nor construct for themselves excuses for incontinence and imposition.\r\nIt will appear strange that these educated persons, when they turn\r\nout upon the street, generally sell articles which have no connection\r\nwith literature, and very little with art. The two brothers, who sell\r\nthat wonder-working paste which removes grease from the outside of\r\nyour collar by driving it further in, were both scholars of Christ’s\r\nHospital. They were second Grecians, and might have gone to college;\r\nbut several visits to suburban fairs, and their accompanying scenes\r\nof debauch, gave them a _penchant_ for a vagabond life, and they will\r\nprobably never relinquish it. The very tall man--there are several\r\nothers--who sells razors and paste on a red pagoda-looking stall, was\r\napprenticed to a surgeon in Colchester, with a premium of 300 guineas;\r\nand the little dark-visaged man, who sells children’s money-boxes\r\nand traps to catch vermin, is the son of a late upholsterer in Bath,\r\nwho was also a magistrate of that city. The poor man alluded to was\r\na law-student, and kept two terms in Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Many\r\nsimilar cases might be mentioned--cases founded on real observation and\r\nexperience. Some light may be thrown upon this subject by pointing out\r\nthe _modus operandi_ by which a friend of mine got initiated into the\r\n‘art and mystery of patterism.’ ‘I had lived,’ he said, ‘more than a\r\nyear among the tradesmen and tramps, who herd promiscuously together\r\nin low lodging-houses. One afternoon I was taking tea at the same\r\ntable with a brace of patterers. They eyed me with suspicion; but,\r\ndetermined to know their proceedings, I launched out the only cant\r\nword I had then learned. They spoke of going to Chatham. Of course, I\r\nknew the place, and asked them, “Where do you stall to in the huey?”\r\nwhich, fairly translated, means, “Where do you lodge in the town?”\r\nConvinced that I was “fly,” one of them said, “We drop the main toper\r\n(go off the main road) and slink into the crib (house) in the back drum\r\n(street).” After some altercation with the “mot” of the “ken” (mistress\r\nof the lodging-house) about the cleanliness of a knife or fork, my new\r\nacquaintance began to arrange “ground,” &c., for the night’s work. I\r\ngot into their confidence by degrees; and I give below a vocabulary of\r\ntheir talk to each other:’\r\n\r\n     Word.            Meaning.\r\n  _Crabshells_       Shoes.\r\n  _Kite_             Paper.\r\n  _Nests_            Varieties.\r\n  _Sticky_           Wax.\r\n  _Toff_             Gentleman.\r\n  _Burerk_           Lady.\r\n  _Camister_         Minister.\r\n  _Crocus_           Doctor.\r\n  _Bluff_            An excuse.\r\n  _Balmy_            Insane.\r\n  _Mill Tag_         A shirt.\r\n  _Smeesh_           A shift.\r\n  _Hay-bag_          A woman.\r\n  _Doxy_             A wife.\r\n  _Flam_             A lie.\r\n  _Teviss_           A shilling.\r\n  _Bull_             A crown.\r\n  _Flag_             An apron.\r\n\r\n“The cant or slang of the patterer is not the cant of the costermonger,\r\nbut a system of their own. As in the case of the costers, it is so\r\ninterlarded with their general remarks, while their ordinary language\r\nis so smothered and subdued, that unless when they are professionally\r\nengaged and talking of their wares, they might almost pass for\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt,” continues my informant, “that the _second_\r\nclass of street-patterers, to whom nature, or parents, or circumstances\r\nhave been unpropitious, are the most moral, and have a greater sense\r\nof right and wrong, with a quicksightedness about humane and generous\r\nthings, to which the ‘aristocratic’ patterer is a stranger. Of the\r\ndealers in useful or harmless wares--although, of course, they use\r\nallowable exaggeration as to the goodness of the article--many are\r\ndevout communicants at church, or members of dissenting bodies;\r\nwhile others are as careless about religion, and are still to be\r\nfound once or twice a week in the lecture-rooms of the Mechanics’\r\nInstitute nearest to their residence. Orchard-street, Westminster,\r\nis a great locality for this sort of patterers. Three well-known\r\ncharacters,--Bristol George, Corporal Casey, and Jemmy the Rake, with\r\na very respectable and highly-informed man called ‘Grocer,’ from his\r\nhaving been apprenticed to that business,--have maintained a character\r\nfor great integrity among the neighbours for many years.\r\n\r\n“I come now to the _third_ class of patterers,--those who, whatever\r\ntheir early pursuits and pleasures, have manifested a predilection\r\nfor vagrancy, and neither can nor will settle to any ordinary\r\ncalling. There is now on the streets a man scarcely thirty years old,\r\nconspicuous by the misfortune of a sabre-wound on the cheek. He is\r\na native of the Isle of Man. His father was a captain in the Buffs,\r\nand himself a commissioned officer at seventeen. He left the army,\r\ndesigning to marry and open a boarding-school. The young lady to whom\r\nhe was betrothed died, and _that_ event _might_ affect his mind; at any\r\nrate, he has had 38 situations in a dozen years, and will not keep one\r\na week. He has a mortal antipathy to good clothes, and will not keep\r\nthem one hour. He sells anything--chiefly needle-cases. He ‘patters’\r\nvery little in a _main drag_ (public street); but in the little private\r\nstreets he preaches an outline of his life, and makes no secret of\r\nhis wandering propensity. His aged mother, who still lives, pays his\r\nlodgings in Old Pye-street.\r\n\r\n“From the hasty glance I have taken at the patterers, any\r\nwell-constructed mind may deduce the following inference: although\r\na great amount of intelligence sometimes consists with a great want\r\nof principle, that an utter want of education, or _mis_-education,\r\nleaves man, like a reed floating on the stream of time, to follow every\r\ndirection which the current of affairs may give him.\r\n\r\n“There is yet another and a larger class, who are wanderers from\r\nchoice,--who would rather be street-orators, and quacks, and\r\nperformers, than anything else in the world. In nine cases out of ten,\r\nthe street-patterers are persons of intemperate habits, no veracity,\r\nand destitute of any desire to improve their condition, even where they\r\nhave the chance. One of this crew was lately engaged at a bazaar; he\r\nhad 18_s._ a week, and his only work was to walk up and down and extol\r\nthe articles exhibited. This was too monotonous a life; I happened to\r\npass him by as he was taking his wages for the week, and heard him say,\r\n‘I shall cut this b--y work; I can earn more on the streets, and be my\r\nown master.’”\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the patterers, although a\r\nvagrant, are a disorganized class. There is a telegraphic dispatch\r\nbetween them, through the length and breadth of the land. If two\r\npatterers (previously unacquainted) meet in the provinces, the\r\nfollowing, or something like it, will be their conversation:--“Can\r\nyou ‘voker romeny’ (can you speak cant)? What is your ‘monekeer’\r\n(name)?”--Perhaps it turns out that one is “White-headed Bob,” and the\r\nother “Plymouth Ned.” They have a “shant of gatter” (pot of beer) at\r\nthe nearest “boozing ken” (ale-house), and swear eternal friendship to\r\neach other. The old saying, that “When the liquor is in, the wit is\r\nout,” is remarkably fulfilled on these occasions, for they betray to\r\nthe “flatties” (natives) all their profits and proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that, in country districts, where there are no\r\nstreets, the patterer is obliged to call at the houses. As they are\r\nmostly without the hawker’s licence, and sometimes find wet linen\r\nbefore it is lost, the rural districts are not fond of their visits;\r\nand there are generally two or three persons in a village reported to\r\nbe “gammy,” that is (unfavourable). If a patterer has been “crabbed,”\r\nthat is (offended) at any of the “cribbs” (houses), he mostly chalks a\r\nsignal on or near the door. I give one or two instances:\r\n\r\n[diamond] “Bone,” meaning good.\r\n\r\n[triangle, point down] “Cooper’d,” spoiled by the imprudence\r\nof some other patterer.\r\n\r\n[square] “Gammy,” likely to have you taken up.\r\n\r\n[circle with dot] “Flummuxed,” sure of a month in quod.\r\n\r\nIn most lodging-houses there is an old man who is the guide to every\r\n“walk” in the vicinity, and who can tell every house, on every round,\r\nthat is “good for a cold ’tater.” In many cases there is over the\r\nkitchen mantle-piece a map of the district, dotted here and there with\r\nmemorandums of failure or success.\r\n\r\nPatterers are fond of carving their names and avocations about the\r\nhouses they visit. The old jail at Dartford has been some years a\r\n“padding-ken.” In one of the rooms appears the following autographs:\r\n\r\n“Jemmy, the Rake, bound to Bristol; bad beds, but no bugs. Thank God\r\nfor all things.”\r\n\r\n“Razor George and his moll slept here the day afore Christmas; just\r\nout of ‘stir’ (jail), for ‘muzzling a peeler.’”\r\n\r\n“Scotch Mary, with ‘driz’ (lace), bound to Dover and back, please God.”\r\n\r\nSometimes these inscriptions are coarse and obscene; sometimes very\r\nwell written and orderly. Nor do they want illustrations.\r\n\r\nAt the old factory, Lincoln, is a portrait of the town beadle, formerly\r\na soldier; it is drawn with different-coloured chalks, and ends with\r\nthe following couplet:\r\n\r\n  “You are a B for false swearing,\r\n  In hell they’ll roast you like a herring.”\r\n\r\nConcubinage is very common among patterers, especially on their\r\ntravels; they have their regular rounds, and call the peregrination\r\n“going on circuit.” For the most part they are early risers; this gives\r\nthem a facility for meeting poor girls who have had a night’s shelter\r\nin the union workhouses. They offer such girls some refreshment,--swear\r\nthey are single men,--and promise comforts certainly superior to the\r\nimmediate position of their victims. Consent is generally obtained;\r\nperhaps a girl of 14 or 15, previously virtuous, is induced to believe\r\nin a promise of constant protection, but finds herself, the next\r\nmorning, ruined and deserted; nor is it unlikely that, within a month\r\nor two, she will see her seducer in the company of a dozen incidental\r\nwives. A gray-headed miscreant called “Cutler Tom” boasts of 500 such\r\nexploits; and there is too great reason to believe that the picture of\r\nhis own drawing is not greatly overcharged.\r\n\r\nSome of the patterers are married men, but of this class very few\r\nare faithful to the solemn obligation. I have heard of a renowned\r\npatterer of this class who was married to four women, and had lived in\r\ncriminal intercourse with his own sister, and his own daughter by one\r\nof the wives. This sad rule has, however, I am happy to state, some\r\nsplendid exceptions. There is a man called “Andy”--well known as the\r\ncompanion of “Hopping Ned;” this “Andy” has a wife of great personal\r\nattractions, a splendid figure, and teeth without a parallel. She is\r\na strictly-virtuous woman, a most devoted wife, and tender mother;\r\nvery charitable to any one in want of a meal, and very constant (she\r\nis a Catholic) in her religious duties. Another man of the same\r\nschool, whose name has escaped me, is, with his wife, an exception to\r\nthe stigma on almost the whole class; the couple in question have no\r\nchildren. The wife, whose name is Maria, has been in every hospital for\r\nsome complaint in her knees, probably white swelling: her beauty is the\r\ntheme of applause, and whenever she opens her mouth silence pervades\r\nthe “paddin’ ken.” Her common conversation is music and mathematics\r\ncombined, her reading has been masculine and extensive, and the whisper\r\nof calumny has never yet attacked her own demeanour or her husband’s.\r\n\r\nOf patterers who have children, many are very exemplary; sending them\r\nto Day and Sunday-schools, causing them to say grace before and after\r\nmeals, to attend public worship, and always to speak the truth: these,\r\ninstances, however, stand in fearful contrast with the conduct of other\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n“I have seen,” proceeds my reverend informant, “fathers and mothers\r\nplace their boys and girls in positions of incipient enormity, and\r\ncommand them to use language and gestures to each other, which would\r\nmake an harlot blush, and almost a heathen tremble. I have hitherto\r\nviewed the patterer as a salesman,--having something in his hand, on\r\nwhose merits, real or pretended, he talks people out of their money. By\r\nslow degrees prosperity rises, but rapid is the advance of evil. The\r\npatterer sometimes gets ‘out of stock,’ and is obliged, at no great\r\nsacrifice of conscience, to ‘patter’ in another strain. In every large\r\ntown sham official documents, with crests, seals, and signatures,\r\ncan be got for half-a-crown. Armed with these, the patterer becomes\r\na ‘lurker,’--that is, an impostor; his papers certify any and every\r\n‘ill that flesh is heir to.’ Shipwreck is called a ‘shake lurk;’\r\nloss by fire is a ‘glim.’ Sometimes the petitioner has had a horse,\r\nwhich has dropped dead with the mad staggers; or has a wife ill or\r\ndying, and six or seven children at once sickening of the small-pox.\r\nChildren are borrowed to support the appearance; the case is certified\r\nby the minister and churchwardens of a parish which exists only in\r\nimagination; and as many people dislike the trouble of investigation,\r\nthe patterer gets enough to raise a stock in trade, and divides the\r\nspoil between the swag-shop and the gin-palace. Sometimes they are\r\ndetected, and get a ‘drag’ (three months in prison). They have many\r\nnarrow escapes: one occurs to me, of a somewhat ludicrous character. A\r\npatterer and lurker (now dead) known by the name of ‘Captain Moody,’\r\nunable to get a ‘fakement’ written or printed, was standing almost\r\nnaked in the streets of a neighbouring town. A gentleman stood still\r\nand heard his piteous tale, but having been ‘done’ more than once,\r\nhe resolved to examine the affair, and begged the petitioner to\r\nconduct him to his wife and children, who were in a garret on a bed of\r\nlanguishing, with neither clothes, food, nor fire, but, it appeared,\r\nwith faith enough to expect a supply from ‘Him who feedeth the ravens,’\r\nand in whose sacred name even a cold ’tater was implored. The patterer,\r\nor half-patterer and half-beggar, took the gentleman (who promised a\r\nsovereign if every thing was square) through innumerable and intricate\r\nwindings, till he came to an outhouse or sort of stable. He saw the\r\nkey outside the door, and begged the gentleman to enter and wait\r\ntill he borrowed a light of a neighbour, to show him up-stairs. The\r\nillumination never arrived, and the poor charitable man found that the\r\nmiscreant had locked him into the stable. The patterer went to the\r\npadding-ken,--told the story with great glee, and left that locality\r\nwithin an hour of the occurrence.”\r\n\r\n[Concerning the mendicancy and vagrancy of patterers, I shall have\r\nmore to say when I speak of vagrancy in general, and when I describe\r\nthe general state and characteristics of the low lodging-houses in\r\nLondon, and those in the country, which are in intimate connection with\r\nthe metropolitan abodes of the vagrant. My present theme is the London\r\npatterer, who is also a street-seller.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS OF STREET-LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe best known, and the most successful printer and publisher of all\r\nwho have directed their industry to supply the “paper” in demand for\r\nstreet sale, and in every department of street literature, was the late\r\n“Jemmy Catnach,” who is said to have amassed upwards of 10,000_l._ in\r\nthe business. He is reported to have made the greater part of this\r\nsum during the trial of Queen Caroline, by the sale of whole-sheet\r\n“papers,” descriptive of the trial, and embellished with “splendid\r\nillustrations.” The next to Catnach stood the late “Tommy Pitt,” of\r\nthe noted toy and marble-warehouse. These two parties were the Colburn\r\nand Bentley of the “paper” trade. Catnach retired from business some\r\nyears ago, and resided in a country-house at Barnet, but he did not\r\nlong survive his retirement. “He was an out and out sort,” said one old\r\npaper-worker to me, “and if he knew you--and he could judge according\r\nto the school you belonged to, if he hadn’t known you long--he was\r\nfriendly for a bob or two, and sometimes for a glass. He knew the\r\nmen that was stickers though, and there was no glass for them. Why,\r\nsome of his customers, sir, would have stuck to him long enough, if\r\nthere’d been a chance of another glass--supposing they’d managed to get\r\n_one_--and then would have asked him for a coach home! When I called on\r\nhim, he used to say, in his north country way--he wasn’t Scotch, but\r\nsomewhere north of England--and he was pleasant with it, ‘Well, d--\r\nyou, how are you?’ He got the cream of the pail, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe present street literature printers and publishers are, Mrs. Ryle\r\n(Catnach’s niece and successor), Mr. Birt, and Mr. Paul (formerly with\r\nCatnach), all of the Seven Dials; Mr. Powell (formerly of Lloyd’s),\r\nBrick-lane, Whitechapel; and Mr. Good, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell.\r\nMr. Phairs, of Westminster; Mr. Taylor, of the Waterloo-road; and Mr.\r\nSharp, of Kent-street, Borough, have discontinued street printing. One\r\nman greatly regretted Mr. Taylor’s discontinuing the business; “he was\r\nso handy for the New-cut, when it _was_ the New-cut.” Some classes of\r\npatterers, I may here observe, work in “schools” or “mobs” of two,\r\nthree, or four, as I shall afterwards show.\r\n\r\nThe authors and poets who give its peculiar literature, alike in\r\nprose or rhyme, to the streets, are now six in number. They are all\r\nin some capacity or other connected with street-patter or song, and\r\nthe way in which a narrative or a “copy of werses” is prepared for\r\npress is usually this:--The leading members of the “schools,” some\r\nof whom refer regularly to the evening papers, when they hear of\r\nany out-of-the-way occurrence, resort to the printer and desire its\r\npublication in a style proper for the streets. This is usually done\r\nvery speedily, the school (or the majority of them) and the printer\r\nagreeing upon the author. Sometimes an author will voluntarily prepare\r\na piece of street literature and submit it to a publisher, who, as in\r\nthe case of other publishers, accepts or declines, as he believes the\r\nproduction will or will not prove remunerative. Sometimes the school\r\ncarry the manuscript with them to the printer, and undertake to buy a\r\ncertain quantity, to insure publication. The payment to the author is\r\nthe same in all cases--a shilling.\r\n\r\nConcerning the history and character of our street and public-house\r\nliterature, I shall treat hereafter, when I can comprise the whole, and\r\nafter the descriptions of the several classes engaged in the trade will\r\nhave paved the way for the reader’s better appreciation of the curious\r\nand important theme. I say, _important_; because the street-ballad and\r\nthe street-narrative, like all popular things, have their influence on\r\nmasses of the people. Specimens will be found adduced, as I describe\r\nthe several classes, or in the statements of the patterers.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the street author is closely restricted\r\nin the quality of his effusion. It must be such as the patterers\r\napprove, as the chaunters can chaunt, the ballad-singers sing,\r\nand--above all--such as street-buyers will buy. One chaunter, who was a\r\ngreat admirer of the “Song of the Shirt,” told me that if Hood himself\r\nhad written the “Pitiful Case of Georgy Sloan and his Wife,” it would\r\nnot have sold so well as a ballad he handed to me, from which I extract\r\na verse:\r\n\r\n  “Jane Willbred we did starve and beat her very hard\r\n      I confess we used her very cruel,\r\n  But now in a jail two long years we must bewail,\r\n      We don’t fancy mustard in the gruel.”\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the _necessity_ which controls street authorship,\r\nmay also be said of the art which is sometimes called in to illustrate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe paper now published for the streets is classed as quarter sheets,\r\nwhich cost (wholesale) 1_s._ a gross; half sheets, which cost 2_s._;\r\nand whole or broad sheets (such as for executions), which cost 3_s._\r\n6_d._ a gross the first day, and 3_s._ the next day or two, and\r\nafterwards, but only if a ream be taken, 5_s._ 6_d._; a ream contains\r\nforty dozen. When “illustrated,” the charge is from 3_d._ to 1_s._ per\r\nream extra. The books, for such cases as the Sloanes, or the murder of\r\nJael Denny, are given in books--which are best adapted for the suburban\r\nand country trade, when London is “worked” sufficiently--are the “whole\r\nsheet” printed so as to fold into eight pages, each side of the paper\r\nbeing then, of course, printed upon. A book is charged from 6_d._ to\r\n1_s._ extra (to a whole sheet) per gross, and afterwards the same extra\r\nper ream.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF LONG SONG-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nI have this week given a daguerreotype of a well-known long-song\r\nseller, and have preferred to give it as the trade, especially as\r\nregards London, has all but disappeared, and it was curious enough.\r\n“Long songs” first appeared between nine and ten years ago.\r\n\r\nThe long-song sellers did not depend upon patter--though some of them\r\npattered a little--to attract customers, but on the veritable cheapness\r\nand novel form in which they vended popular songs, printed on paper\r\nrather wider than this page, “three songs abreast,” and the paper\r\nwas about a yard long, which constituted the “three” yards of song.\r\nSometimes three slips were pasted together. The vendors paraded the\r\nstreets with their “three yards of new and popular songs” for a penny.\r\nThe songs are, or were, generally fixed to the top of a long pole, and\r\nthe vendor “cried” the different titles as he went along. This branch\r\nof “the profession” is confined solely to the summer; the hands in\r\nwinter usually taking to the sale of song-books, it being impossible\r\nto exhibit “the three yards” in wet or foggy weather. The paper songs,\r\nas they fluttered from a pole, looked at a little distance like\r\nhuge much-soiled white ribbons, used as streamers to celebrate some\r\nauspicious news. The cry of one man, in a sort of recitative, or, as\r\nI heard it called by street-patterers, “sing-song,” was, “Three yards\r\na penny! Three yards a penny! Beautiful songs! Newest songs! Popular\r\nSongs! Three yards a penny! Song, song, songs!” Others, however,\r\nwere generally content to announce merely “Three yards a penny!” One\r\ncried “Two under fifty a fardy!” As if two hundred and fifty songs\r\nwere to be sold for a farthing. The whole number of songs was about\r\n45. They were afterwards sold at a halfpenny, but were shorter and\r\nfewer. It is probable that at the best had the songs been subjected\r\nto the admeasurement of a jury, the result might have been as little\r\nsatisfactory as to some tradesmen who, however, after having been\r\ndetected in attempts to cheat the poor in weights and scales, and to\r\ncheat them hourly, are still “good men and true” enough to be jurymen\r\nand parliamentary electors. The songs, I am informed, were often about\r\n2-1/2 yards, (not as to paper but as to admeasurement of type); 3\r\nyards, occasionally, at first, and not often less than 2 yards.\r\n\r\nThe crying of the titles was not done with any other design than that\r\nof expressing the great number of songs purchasable for “the small\r\ncharge of one penny.” Some of the patterers I conversed with would\r\nhave made it sufficiently droll. One man told me that he had cried the\r\nfollowing songs in his three yards, and he believed in something like\r\nthe following order, but he had cried penny song books, among other\r\nthings, lately, and might confound his more ancient and recent cries:\r\n\r\n“I sometimes began,” he said, “with singing, or trying to sing, for\r\nI’m no vocalist, the first few words of any song, and them quite loud.\r\nI’d begin\r\n\r\n  ‘The Pope he leads a happy life,\r\n    He knows no care’----\r\n\r\n‘Buffalo gals, come out to-night;’ ‘Death of Nelson;’ ‘The gay\r\ncavalier;’ ‘Jim along Josey;’ ‘There’s a good time coming;’ ‘Drink\r\nto me only;’ ‘Kate Kearney;’ ‘Chuckaroo-choo, choo-choo-choot-lah;’\r\n‘Chockala-roony-ninkaping-nang;’ ‘Paga-daway-dusty-kanty-key;’\r\n‘Hottypie-gunnypo-china-coo’ (that’s a Chinese song, sir); ‘I dreamed\r\nthat I dwelt in marble halls;’ ‘The standard bearer;’ ‘Just like love;’\r\n‘Whistle o’er the lave o’t;’ ‘Widow Mackree;’ ‘I’ve been roaming;’ ‘Oh!\r\nthat kiss;’ ‘The old English gentleman,’ &c., &c. &c. I dares say they\r\nwas all in the three yards, or was once, and if they wasn’t there was\r\nothers as good.”\r\n\r\nThe chief purchasers of the “long songs” were boys and girls, but\r\nmostly boys, who expended 1_d._ or 1/2_d._ for the curiosity and\r\nnovelty of the thing, as the songs were not in the most readable form.\r\nA few working people bought them for their children, and some women of\r\nthe town, who often buy anything fantastic, were also customers.\r\n\r\nWhen “the three yards was at their best,” the number selling them\r\nwas about 170; the wholesale charge is from 3_d._ to 5_d._ a dozen,\r\naccording to size. The profit of the vendors in the first instance\r\nwas about 8_d._ a dozen. When the trade had all the attractions of\r\nnovelty, some men sold ten dozen on fine days, and for three or four\r\nof the summer months; so clearing between 6_s._ and 7_s._ a day. This,\r\nhowever, was not an average, but an average might be at first 21_s._\r\na week profit. I am assured that if twenty persons were selling long\r\nsongs in the street last summer it was “the outside,” as long songs\r\nare now “for fairs and races and country work.” Calculating that each\r\ncleared 9_s._ in a week, and to clear that took 15_s._, the profit\r\nbeing smaller than it used to be, as many must be sold at 1/2_d._\r\neach--we find 120_l._ expended in long songs in the streets. The\r\ncharacter of the vendor is that of a patterer of inferior genius.\r\n\r\nThe stock-money required is 1_s._ to 2_s._; which with 2_d._ for a\r\npole, and 1/2_d._ for paste, is all the capital needed. Very few were\r\nsold in the public-houses, as the vendors scrupled to expose them\r\nthere, “for drunken fellows would snatch them, and make belts of them\r\nfor a lark.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF RUNNING PATTERERS.\r\n\r\nFew of the residents in London--but chiefly those in the quieter\r\nstreets--have not been aroused, and most frequently in the evening,\r\nby a hurly-burly on each side of the street. An attentive listening\r\nwill not lead any one to an accurate knowledge of what the clamour is\r\nabout. It is from a “mob” or “school” of the running patterers (for\r\nboth those words are used), and consists of two, three, or four men.\r\nAll these men state that the greater the noise they make, the better\r\nis the chance of sale, and better still when the noise is on each\r\nside of a street, for it appears as if the vendors were proclaiming\r\nsuch interesting or important intelligence, that they were vieing\r\nwith one another who should supply the demand which must ensue. It\r\nis not possible to ascertain with any certitude _what_ the patterers\r\nare so anxious to sell, for only a few leading words are audible. One\r\nof the cleverest of running patterers repeated to me, in a subdued\r\ntone, his announcements of murders. The words “Murder,” “Horrible,”\r\n“Barbarous,” “Love,” “Mysterious,” “Former Crimes,” and the like, could\r\nonly be caught by the ear, but there was no announcement of anything\r\nlike “particulars.” If, however, the “paper” relate to any well-known\r\ncriminal, such as Rush, the name is given distinctly enough, and so\r\nis any new or pretended fact. The running patterers describe, or\r\nprofess to describe, the contents of their papers as they go rapidly\r\nalong, and they seldom or ever stand still. They usually deal in\r\nmurders, seductions, crim.-cons., explosions, alarming accidents,\r\n“assassinations,” deaths of public characters, duels, and love-letters.\r\nBut popular, or notorious, murders are the “great goes.” The running\r\npatterer cares less than other street-sellers for bad weather, for\r\nif he “work” on a wet and gloomy evening, and if the work be “a\r\ncock,” which is a fictitious statement or even a pretended fictitious\r\nstatement, there is the less chance of any one detecting the _ruse_.\r\nBut of late years no new “cocks” have been printed, excepting for\r\ntemporary purposes, such as I have specified as under its appropriate\r\nhead in my account of “Death and Fire-Hunters.” Among the old\r\nstereotyped “cocks” are love-letters. One is well known as “The Husband\r\ncaught in a Trap,” and being in an epistolary form subserves any\r\npurpose: whether it be the patterer’s aim to sell the “Love Letters” of\r\nany well-known person, such as Lola Montes, or to fit them for a local\r\n(pretended) scandal, as the “Letters from a Lady in this neighbourhood\r\nto a Gentleman not 100 miles off.”\r\n\r\nOf running patterers there are now in London from 80 to 100. They\r\nreside--some in their own rooms, but the majority in lodging-houses--in\r\nor near Westminster, St Giles’s, Whitechapel, Stratford, Deptford,\r\nWandsworth, and the Seven Dials. The “Dials,” however, is their chief\r\nlocality, being the residence of the longest-established printers, and\r\nis the “head meet” of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to specify with exactitude the number of running or\r\nflying patterers at any one time in London. Some of these men become,\r\noccasionally, standing patterers, chaunters, or ballad-singers--classes\r\nI shall subsequently describe--and all of them resort at intervals\r\nto country rounds. I heard, also, many complaints of boys having of\r\nlate “taken to the running patter” when anything attractive was before\r\nthe public, and of ignorant fellows--that wouldn’t have thought of it\r\nat one time--“trying their hands at it.” Waiving these exceptional\r\naugmentations of the number, I will take the body of running patterers,\r\ngenerally employed in their peculiar craft in London, at 90. To\r\nascertain their earnings presents about the same difficulties as to\r\nascertain their number; for as all they earn is spent--no patterer ever\r\nsaving money--they themselves are hardly able to tell their incomes.\r\nIf any new and exciting fact be before the public, these men may each\r\nclear 20_s._ a week; when there is no such fact, they may not earn\r\n5_s._ The profit is contingent, moreover, upon their being able to\r\nobtain 1_d._, or only 1/2_d._, for their paper. Some represented their\r\naverage weekly earnings at 12_s._ 6_d._ the year through; some at\r\n10_s._ 6_d._; and others at less than half of 12_s._ 6_d._ Reckoning,\r\nhowever, that only 9_s._ weekly is an average profit per individual,\r\nand that 14_s._ be taken to realise that profit, we find 3,276_l._\r\nexpended yearly on running patterers in London; but in that sum the\r\ntakings of the chaunters must be included, as they are members of the\r\nsame fraternity, and work with the patterers.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to commence as a running patterer is but the\r\nprice of a few papers--from 2_d._ to 1_s._ The men have no distinctive\r\ndress: “our togs,” said one of them, “is in the latest fashion of\r\nPetticoat-lane;” unless on the very rare occasions, when some character\r\nhas to be personated, and then coloured papers and glazed calicoes are\r\nmade available. But this is only a venture of the old hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-SONG SELLER.\r\n\r\n“Two under fifty for a fardy’!”\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE OF A RUNNING PATTERER.\r\n\r\nFrom a running patterer, who has been familiar with the trade for\r\nmany years, I received, upwards of a twelvemonth ago, the following\r\nstatement. He is well known for his humour, and is a leading man in his\r\nfraternity. After some conversation about “cocks,” the most popular of\r\nwhich, my informant said, was the murder at Chigwell-row, he continued:\r\n\r\n“That’s a trump, to the present day. Why, I’d go out now, sir, with\r\na dozen of Chigwell-rows, and earn my supper in half an hour off of\r\n’em. The murder of Sarah Holmes at Lincoln is good, too--that there\r\nhas been worked for the last five year successively every winter. Poor\r\nSarah Holmes! Bless her! she has saved me from walking the streets all\r\nnight many a time. Some of the best of these have been in work twenty\r\nyears--the Scarborough murder has full twenty years. It’s called ‘THE\r\nSCARBOROUGH TRAGEDY.’ I’ve worked it myself. It’s about a noble and\r\nrich young naval officer seducing a poor clergyman’s daughter. She is\r\nconfined in a ditch, and destroys the child. She is taken up for it,\r\ntried, and executed. This has had a great run. It sells all round the\r\ncountry places, and would sell now if they had it out. Mostly all our\r\ncustomers is females. They are the chief dependence we have. The\r\nScarborough Tragedy is very attractive. It draws tears to the women’s\r\neyes to think that a poor clergyman’s daughter, who is remarkably\r\nbeautiful, should murder her own child; it’s very touching to every\r\nfeeling heart. There’s a copy of verses with it, too. Then there’s the\r\nLiverpool Tragedy--that’s very attractive. It’s a mother murdering\r\nher own son, through gold. He had come from the East Indies, and\r\nmarried a rich planter’s daughter. He came back to England to see his\r\nparents after an absence of thirty years. They kept a lodging-house\r\nin Liverpool for sailors; the son went there to lodge, and meant to\r\ntell his parents who he was in the morning. His mother saw the gold\r\nhe had got in his boxes, and cut his throat--severed his head from\r\nhis body; the old man, upwards of seventy years of age, holding the\r\ncandle. They had put a washing-tub under the bed to catch his blood.\r\nThe morning after the murder, the old man’s daughter calls and inquires\r\nfor a young man. The old man denies that they have had any such person\r\nin the house. She says he had a mole on his arm, in the shape of a\r\nstrawberry. The old couple go up-stairs to examine the corpse, and find\r\nthey have murdered their own son, and then they both put an end to\r\ntheir existence. This is a deeper tragedy than the Scarborough Murder.\r\nThat suits young people better; they like to hear about the young woman\r\nbeing seduced by the naval officer; but the mothers take more to the\r\nLiverpool Tragedy--it suits them better. Some of the ‘cocks’ were in\r\nexistence long before ever I was born or thought of. The ‘Great and\r\nimportant battle between the two young ladies of fortune,’ is what we\r\ncalls ‘a ripper.’ I should like to have that there put down correct,”\r\nhe added, “’cause I’ve taken a tidy lot of money out of it.”\r\n\r\nMy informant, who had been upwards of 20 years in the running patter\r\nline, told me that he commenced his career with the “Last Dying Speech\r\nand Full Confession of William Corder.” He was sixteen years of age,\r\nand had run away from his parents. “I worked that there,” he said,\r\n“down in the very town (at Bury) where he was executed. I got a whole\r\nhatful of halfpence at that. Why, I wouldn’t even give ’em seven for\r\nsixpence--no, that I wouldn’t. A gentleman’s servant come out and\r\nwanted half a dozen for his master and one for himself in, and I\r\nwouldn’t let him have no such thing. We often sells more than that at\r\nonce. Why, I sold six at one go to the railway clerks at Norwich about\r\nthe Manning affair, only a fortnight back. But Steinburgh’s little\r\njob--you know he murdered his wife and family, and committed suicide\r\nafter--that sold as well as any ‘die.’ Pegsworth was an out-and-out\r\nlot. I did tremendous with him, because it happened in London, down\r\nRatcliff-highway--that’s a splendid quarter for working--there’s\r\nplenty of feelings--but, bless you, some places you go to you can’t\r\nmove no how, they’ve hearts like paving-stones. They wouldn’t have\r\n‘the papers’ if you’d give them to ’em--especially when they knows\r\nyou. Greenacre didn’t sell so well as might have been expected, for\r\nsuch a diabolical out-and-out crime as he committed; but you see he\r\ncame close after Pegsworth, and that took the beauty off him. Two\r\nmurderers together is never no good to nobody. Why there was Wilson\r\nGleeson, as great a villain as ever lived--went and murdered a whole\r\nfamily at noon-day--but Rush coopered him--and likewise that girl\r\nat Bristol--made it no draw to any one. Daniel Good, though, was a\r\nfirst-rater; and would have been much better if it hadn’t been for\r\nthat there Madam Toosow. You see, she went down to Roehampton, and guv\r\n2_l._ for the werry clogs as he used to wash his master’s carriage\r\nin; so, in course, when the harristocracy could go and see the real\r\nthings--the werry identical clogs--in the Chamber of ’Orrors, why\r\nthe people wouldn’t look at our authentic portraits of the fiend in\r\nhuman form. Hocker wasn’t any particular great shakes. There was a\r\ndeal expected from him, but he didn’t turn out well. Courvoisier was\r\nmuch better; he sold wery well, but nothing to Blakesley. Why I worked\r\nhim for six weeks. The wife of the murdered man kept the King’s Head\r\nthat he was landlord on open on the morning of the execution, and the\r\nplace was like a fair. I even went and sold papers outside the door\r\nmyself. I thought if she war’n’t ashamed, why should I be? After that\r\nwe had a fine ‘fake’--that was the fire of the Tower of London--it\r\nsold rattling. Why we had about forty apprehended for that--first we\r\nsaid two soldiers was taken up that couldn’t obtain their discharge,\r\nand then we declared it was a well-known sporting nobleman who did it\r\nfor a spree. The boy Jones in the Palace wasn’t much of an affair for\r\nthe running patterers; the ballad singers--or street screamers, as we\r\ncalls ’em--had the pull out of that. The patter wouldn’t take; they had\r\nread it all in the newspapers before. Oxford, and Francis, and Bean\r\nwere a little better, but nothing to crack about. The people doesn’t\r\ncare about such things as them. There’s nothing beats a stunning good\r\nmurder, after all. Why there was Rush--I lived on him for a month or\r\nmore. When I commenced with Rush, I was 14_s._ in debt for rent, and\r\nin less than fourteen days I astonished the wise men in the east by\r\npaying my landlord all I owed him. Since Dan’el Good there had been\r\nlittle or nothing doing in the murder line--no one could cap him--till\r\nRush turned up a regular trump for us. Why I went down to Norwich\r\nexpressly to work the execution. I worked my way down there with ‘_a\r\nsorrowful lamentation_’ of his own composing, which I’d got written\r\nby the blind man expressly for the occasion. On the morning of the\r\nexecution we beat all the regular newspapers out of the field; for we\r\nhad the full, true, and particular account down, you see, by our own\r\nexpress, and that can beat anything that ever they can publish; for we\r\ngets it printed several days afore it comes off, and goes and stands\r\nwith it right under the drop; and many’s the penny I’ve turned away\r\nwhen I’ve been asked for an account of the whole business _before_ it\r\nhappened. So you see, for herly and correct hinformation, we can beat\r\nthe _Sun_--aye, or the moon either, for the matter of that. Irish Jem,\r\nthe Ambassador, never goes to bed but he blesses Rush the farmer; and\r\nmany’s the time he’s told me we should never have such another windfall\r\nas that. But I told him not to despair; there’s a good time coming,\r\nboys, says I, and, sure enough, up comes the Bermondsey tragedy. We\r\nmight have done very well, indeed, out of the Mannings, but there was\r\ntoo many examinations for it to be any great account to us. I’ve been\r\naway with the Mannings in the country ever since. I’ve been through\r\nHertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Suffolk, along with George Frederick\r\nManning and his wife--travelled from 800 to 1,000 miles with ’em, but I\r\ncould have done much better if I had stopped in London. Every day I was\r\nanxiously looking for a confession from Mrs. Manning. All I wanted was\r\nfor her to clear her conscience afore she left this here whale of tears\r\n(that’s what I always calls it in the patter), and when I read in the\r\npapers (mind they was none of my own) that her last words on the brink\r\nof heternity was, ‘I’ve nothing to say to you, Mr. Rowe, but to thank\r\nyou for your kindness,’ I guv her up entirely--had completely done\r\nwith her. In course the public looks to us for the last words of all\r\nmonsters in human form, and as for Mrs. Manning’s, they were not worth\r\nthe printing.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RECENT EXPERIENCE OF A RUNNING PATTERER.\r\n\r\nFrom the same man I had the following account of his vocation up to the\r\npresent time:\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he said, “I think, take them altogether, things hasn’t\r\nbeen so good this last year as the year before. But the Pope, God bless\r\nhim! he’s been the best friend I’ve had since Rush, but Rush licked\r\nhis Holiness. You see, the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman is a one-sided\r\naffair; of course the Catholics won’t buy anything against the Pope,\r\nbut _all_ religions could go for Rush. Our mob once thought of starting\r\na cardinal’s dress, and I thought of wearing a red hat myself. I did\r\nwear a shovel hat when the Bishop of London was our racket; but I\r\nthought the hat began to feel too hot, so I shovelled it off. There was\r\nplenty of paper that would have suited to work with a cardinal’s hat.\r\nThere was one,--‘Cardinal Wiseman’s Lament,’--and it was giving his own\r\nwords like, and a red hat would have capped it. It used to make the\r\npeople roar when it came to snivelling, and grumbling at little Jack\r\nRussell--by Wiseman, in course; and when it comes to this part--which\r\nalludes to that ’ere thundering letter to the Bishop of Durham--the\r\npeople was stunned:\r\n\r\n  ‘He called me a buffalo, bull, and a monkey,\r\n  And then with a soldier called Old Arthur conkey\r\n  Declared they would buy me a ninepenny donkey,\r\n      And send me to Rome to the Pope.’\r\n\r\n“They shod me, sir. _Who’s_ they? Why, the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman. I\r\ncall my clothes after them I earn money by to buy them with. My shoes\r\nI call Pope Pius; my trowsers and braces, Calcraft; my waistcoat and\r\nshirt, Jael Denny; and my coat, Love Letters. A man must show a sense\r\nof gratitude in the best way he can. But I didn’t start the cardinal’s\r\nhat; I thought it might prove disagreeable to Sir Robert Peel’s dress\r\nlodgers.” [What my informant said further of the Pope, I give under the\r\nhead of the Chaunter.] “There was very little doing,” he continued,\r\n“for some time after I gave you an account before; hardly a slum worth\r\na crust and a pipe of tobacco to us. A slum’s a paper fake,--make a\r\nfoot-note of that, sir. I think Adelaide was the first thing I worked\r\nafter I told you of my tomfooleries. Yes it was,--her helegy. She\r\nweren’t of no account whatsomever, and Cambridge was no better nor\r\nAdelaide. But there was poor Sir Robert Peel,--he _was_ some good;\r\nindeed, I think he was as good as 5_s._ a day to me for the four or\r\nfive days when he was freshest. Browns were thrown out of the windows\r\nto us, and one copper cartridge was sent flying at us with 13-1/2_d._\r\nin it, all copper, as if it had been collected. I worked Sir Robert at\r\nthe West End, and in the quiet streets and squares. Certainly we had a\r\nmost beautiful helegy. Well, poor gentleman, what we earned on him was\r\nsome set-off to us for his starting his new regiment of the Blues--the\r\nCook’s Own. Not that they’ve troubled me much. I was once before\r\nAlderman Kelly, when he was Lord Mayor, charged with obstructing, or\r\nsome humbug of that sort. ‘What are you, my man?’ says he quietly, and\r\nlike a gentleman. ‘In the same line as yourself, my lord,’ says I.\r\n‘How’s that?’ says he. ‘I’m a paper-worker for my living, my lord,’\r\nsays I. I was soon discharged; and there was such fun and laughing,\r\nthat if I’d had a few slums in my pocket, I believe I could have sold\r\nthem all in the justice-room.\r\n\r\n“Haynau was a stunner, and the drayman came their caper just in the\r\ncritical time for us, as things was growing very taper. But I did best\r\nwith him in chaunting; and so, as you want to hear about chaunting,\r\nI’ll tell you after. We’re forced to change our patter--first running,\r\nthen chaunting, and then standing--oftener than we used to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS OF STREET-ART--No. I.\r\n\r\n  Horrible and Bar-bari-ous Murder of Poor\r\n  =JAEL DENNY=,\r\n  THE ILL-FATED VICTIM OF THOMAS DRORY.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Then Calcraft was pretty tidy browns. He was up for starving his\r\nmother,--and what better can you expect of a hangman? Me and my mate\r\nworked him down at Hatfield, in Essex, where his mother lives. It’s\r\nhis native, I believe. We sold her one. She’s a limping old body. I\r\nsaw the people look at her, and they told me arterards who she was.\r\n‘How much?’ says she. ‘A penny, marm,’ say I. ‘Sarve him right,’ says\r\nshe. We worked it, too, in the street in Hoxton where he lives, and\r\nhe sent out for two, which shows he’s a sensible sort of character in\r\nsome points, after all. Then we had a ‘Woice from the Gaol! or the\r\nHorrors of the Condemned Cell! Being the Life of William Calcraft,\r\nthe present Hangman.’ It’s written in the high style, and parts of it\r\nwill have astonished the hangman’s nerves before this. Here’s a bit of\r\nthe patter, now:\r\n\r\n “Let us look at William Calcraft,” says the eminent author, “in\r\n his earliest days. He was born about the year 1801, of humble but\r\n industrious parents, at a little village in Essex. His infant ears\r\n often listened to the children belonging to the Sunday schools of his\r\n native place, singing the well-known words of Watt’s beautiful hymn,\r\n\r\n  ‘When e’er I take my walks abroad,\r\n    How many poor I see, &c.’\r\n\r\n But alas for the poor farmer’s boy, he never had the opportunity of\r\n going to that school to be taught how to shun ‘the broad way leading\r\n to destruction.’ To seek a chance fortune he travelled up to London\r\n where his ignorance and folorn condition shortly enabled that fell\r\n demon which ever haunts the footsteps of the wretched, to mark him for\r\n her own.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that stunning, sir? Here it is in print for you. ‘Mark him\r\nfor her own!’ Then, poor dear, he’s so sorry to hang anybody. Here’s\r\nanother bit:\r\n\r\n ‘But in vain he repents, he has no real friend in the world but his\r\n wife, to whom he can communicate his private thoughts, and in return\r\n receive consolation, can any lot be harder than this? Hence his\r\n nervous system is fast breaking down, every day rendering him less\r\n able to endure the excruciating and agonizing torments he is hourly\r\n suffering, he is haunted by remorse heaped upon remorse, every fresh\r\n victim he is required to strangle being so much additional fuel thrown\r\n upon that mental flame which is scorching him.’\r\n\r\n“You may believe me, sir, and I can prove the fact--the author of that\r\nbeautiful writing ain’t in parliament! Think of the mental flame, sir!\r\nO, dear.\r\n\r\n“Sirrell was no good either. Not salt to a herring. Though we worked\r\nhim in his own neighbourhood, and pattered about gold and silver all\r\nin a row. ‘Ah!’ says one old woman, ‘he was a ’spectable man.’ ‘Werry,\r\nmarm,’ says I.\r\n\r\n“Hollest weren’t no good either, ’cause the wictim was a parson.\r\nIf it had happened a little later, _we’d_ have had it to rights;\r\nthe newspapers didn’t make much of it. We’d have shown it was the\r\n‘Commencement of a Most Horrid and Barbarious Plot got up by the\r\nPope and Cardinal Wiseman _for-r_ the Mas-ser-cree-ing of all good\r\nProtestant Ministers.’ That would have been the dodge, sir! A beautiful\r\nidear, now, isn’t it? But the murder came off badly, and you can’t\r\nexpect fellows like them murderers to have any regard for the interest\r\nof art and literature. Then there’s so long to wait between the murder\r\nand the trial, that unless the fiend in human form keeps writing\r\nbeautiful love-letters, the excitement can’t be kept up. _We_ can write\r\nthe love-letters for the fiend in human? That’s quite true, and we\r\nonce had a great pull that way over the newspapers. But Lord love you,\r\nthere’s plenty of ’em gets more and more into our line. They treads in\r\nour footsteps, sir; they follows our bright example. O! isn’t there a\r\nnice rubbing and polishing up. This here copy won’t do. This must be\r\nleft out, and that put in; ’cause it suits the walk of the paper. Why,\r\nyou must know, sir. _I_ know. Don’t tell me. You can’t have been on the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ for nothing.\r\n\r\n“Then there was the ‘Horrid and Inhuman Murder, Committed by T. Drory,\r\non the Body of Jael Denny, at Donninghurst, a Village in Essex.’ We\r\nworked it in every way. Drory had every chance given to him. We had\r\nhalf-sheets, and copies of werses, and books. A very tidy book it was,\r\nsetting off with showing how ‘The secluded village of Donninghurst\r\nhas been the scene of a most determined and diabolical murder, the\r\ndiscovery of which early on Sunday, the 12th, in the morning has\r\nthrown the whole of this part of the country into a painful state of\r\nexcitement.’ Well, sir, well--very well; that bit was taken from a\r\nnewspaper. Oh, we’re not above acknowledging when we condescends to\r\nborrow from any of ’em. If you remember, when I saw you about the\r\ntime, I told you I thought Jael Denny would turn out as good as Maria\r\nMartin. And without any joke or nonsense, sir, it really is a most\r\nshocking thing. But she didn’t. The weather coopered her, poor lass!\r\nThere was money in sight, and we couldn’t touch it; it seemed washed\r\naway from us, for you may remember how wet it was. I made a little by\r\nher, though. For all that, I haven’t done with Master Drory yet. If\r\nGod spares my life, he shall make it up to me. Why, now, sir, is it\r\nreasonable, that a poor man like me should take so much pains to make\r\nDrory’s name known all over the country, and walk miles and miles in\r\nthe rain to do it, and get only a few bob for my labour? It can’t be\r\nthought on. When the Wile and Inhuman Seducer takes his trial, he must\r\npay up my just claims. I’m not going to take all that trouble on his\r\naccount, and let him off so easy.”\r\n\r\nMy informant then gave me an account of his sale of papers relating\r\nto the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman, but as he was then a chaunter,\r\nrather than a patterer (the distinction is shown under another head),\r\nI give his characteristic account, as the statement of a chaunter. He\r\nproceeded after having finished his recital of the street business\r\nrelating to the Pope, &c.:\r\n\r\n“My last paying caper was the Sloanes. They beat Haynau. I declare to\r\nyou, sir, the knowingest among us couldn’t have invented a cock to\r\nequal the conduct of them Sloanes. Why, it’s disgusting to come near\r\nthe plain truth about them. I think, take it altogether, Sloane was as\r\ngood as the Pope, but he had a stopper like Pius the Ninth, for that\r\nwas a one-sided affair, and the Catholics wouldn’t buy; and Sloane was\r\ntoo disgusting for the gentry, or better sort, to buy him. But I’ve\r\nbeen in little streets where some of the windows was without sashes,\r\nand some that had sashes had stockings thrust between the frames, and\r\nI’ve taken half a bob in ha’pennies. Oh! you should have heard what\r\npoor women said about him, for it was women that bought him most.\r\nThey was more savage against him than against her. Why, they had fifty\r\ndeaths for him. Rolling in a barrel, with lots of sharp nails inside,\r\ndown Primrose-hill, and turned out to the women on Kennington-common,\r\nand boiled alive in oil or stuff that can’t be mentioned, or hung over\r\na slow fire. ‘O, the poor dear girl,’ says they, ‘what she’s suffered.’\r\nWe had accounts of Mistress Sloane’s apprehension before the papers.\r\nWe had it at Jersey, and they had it at Boulogne, but we were first.\r\nThen we discovered, because we _must_ be in advance of the papers, that\r\nMiss Devaux was Sloane’s daughter by a former wife, and Jane Wilbred\r\nwas Mrs. Sloane’s daughter by a former husband, and was entitled to\r\n1,000_l._ by rights. Haynau was a fool to Sloane.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know of anything fresh that’s in hand, sir. One of our authors\r\nis coming out with something spicy, against Lord John, for doing\r\nnothing about Wiseman; ’cause he says as no one thing that he’s written\r\nfor Lord John ever sold well, something against him may.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHAUNTERS.\r\n\r\n“As the minstrel’s art,” writes Mr. Strutt, in his “Sports and\r\nPastimes,” “consisted of several branches, the professors were\r\ndistinguished by different denominations, as ‘rimours, _chanterres_,\r\nconteours, jougleours or jongleurs, jestours, lecours, and troubadours\r\nor trouvers:’ in modern language, rhymers, singers, story-tellers,\r\njugglers, relaters of heroic actions, buffoons, and poets; but all\r\nof them were included under the general name of minstrel. An eminent\r\nFrench antiquary says of the minstrels, that some of them themselves\r\ncomposed the subjects they sang or related, as the trouvers and the\r\nconteurs; and some of them used the compositions of others, as the\r\njougleours and the chanteurs. He further remarks, that the trouvers\r\nmay be said to have embellished their productions with rhyme, while\r\nthe conteurs related their histories in prose; the jougleours, who in\r\nthe middle ages were famous for playing upon the vielle” [a kind of\r\nhurdy-gurdy], “accompanied the songs of the trouvers. These jougleours\r\nwere also assisted by the chanteurs; and this union of talents rendered\r\nthe compositions more harmonious and more pleasing to the auditory,\r\nand increased their rewards, so that they readily joined each other,\r\nand travelled together in large parties. It is, however, very certain\r\nthat the poet, the songster, and the musician were frequently united in\r\nthe same person.” My account of the authors, &c., of street literature\r\nshows that the analogy still holds.\r\n\r\nThe French antiquary quoted was Fauchet, in his “Origine de la Langue\r\net Poësie Françoise” (1581); and though he wrote concerning his own\r\ncountry, his descriptions apply equally to the English minstrels, who\r\nwere principally Normans, for many reigns after the Conquest, and were\r\nof the same race, and habits, and manners as on the French side of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nOf the minstrels, I shall have more to say when I treat of the\r\nballad-singers and the bands of street and public-house musicians\r\nof to-day, between whom and the minstrels of old there is, in many\r\nrespects, a somewhat close resemblance. Minstrelsy fell gradually from\r\nits high estate, and fell so low that, in the 39th year of Elizabeth’s\r\nreign--a period when the noblest poetry of any language was beginning\r\nto command the ear of the educated in England--the minstrels were\r\nclassed in a penal statute with rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars!\r\nPutenham, in his “Arte of English Poesie” (1589), speaks of “taverne\r\nminstrels that give a fit of mirth for a groat.” One of the statutes\r\nenacted in Cromwell’s Protectorate was directed against all persons\r\n“commonly called fidlers or minstrells.”\r\n\r\nIn the old times, then, the jougeleurs and jestours were assisted by\r\nthe chanteurs. In the present day the running patterer--who, as I\r\nhave shown, is the sufficiently legitimate descendant of the jestour,\r\nand in some respects of the mountebank--is accompanied generally by\r\na chaunter, so presenting a further point of resemblance between\r\nancient and modern street-folk. The chaunter now not only sings, but\r\nfiddles, for within these few years the running patterers, to render\r\ntheir performances more attractive, are sometimes accompanied by\r\nmusicians. The running performer then, instead of hurrying along with\r\nthe members of his mob, making sufficient noise to arouse a whole\r\nstreet, takes his stand with the chaunter in any promising place, and\r\nas the songs which are the most popular are--as is the case at many of\r\nthe concert-rooms--sometimes “spoken” as well as sung, the performers\r\nare in their proper capacity, for the patterer not only “speaks,” but\r\nspeaks more than is set down for him, while the chaunter fiddles and\r\nsings. Sometimes the one patters while the other sings, and their\r\nthemes are the same.\r\n\r\nI am told, however, that there are only fifty running patterers who\r\nare regularly their own chaunters, fiddling to their songs, while the\r\nmob work as usual, or one man sings, or speaks and sings, with the\r\nchaunter. Two of these men are known as Brummagem Jack, and the Country\r\nPaganini. From twenty to thirty patterers, however, are chaunters also,\r\nwhen they think the occasion requires it.\r\n\r\nFurther to elucidate chaunting, and to show the quality of the\r\ncanticles, and the way of proceeding, I cite a statement of his\r\nexperience as a chaunter, from the running patterer, whose details\r\nof his more especial business I have already given, but who also\r\noccasionally chaunts:--\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A CHAUNTER.\r\n\r\n“The Pope, sir,” he began, “was as one-sided to chaunt as to patter,\r\nin course. We had the Greeks (the lately-arrived Irish) down upon us\r\nmore than once. In Liverpool-street, on the night of the meeting at\r\nGuildhall about the Papal Aggression, we had a regular skrimmage.\r\nOne gentleman said: ‘Really, you shouldn’t sing such improper songs,\r\nmy men.’ Then up comes another, and he was a little crusted with port\r\nwine, and he says: ‘What, against that cove the Pope! Here, give me\r\nhalf a dozen of the papers.’ The city was tidy for the patter, sir, or\r\nthe chaunt; there was sixpences; but there was shillings at the West\r\nEnd. And for the first time in their innocent lives, the parsons came\r\nout as stunning patrons of the patter. One of ’em as we was at work\r\nin the street give a bit of a signal and was attended to without any\r\nparade to the next street, and was good for half-a-crown! Other two\r\nstopped, that wery same day, and sent a boy to us with a Joey. Then me\r\nand my mate went to the Rev. W.’s, him as came it so strong for the\r\nfire-works on the Fifth of November. And we pattered and we pattered,\r\nand we chaunted and we chaunted, but no go for a goodish bit. His\r\nservant said he weren’t at home. In course _that_ wouldn’t do for us,\r\nso down he came his-self at last, and says, werry soft: ‘Come to-morrow\r\nmorning, my men, and there’ll be two gentlemen to hear you.’ We stuck\r\nto him for something in hand, but he said the business had cost him\r\nso much already, he really couldn’t. Well, we bounced a bob out of\r\nhim, and didn’t go near him again. After all we did for his party, a\r\nshilling was black ingratitude. Of course _we_ has no feeling either\r\nfor or agin the Pope. _We_ goes to it as at an election; and let me\r\ntell you, sir, we got very poorly paid, it couldn’t be called paid, for\r\nworking for Lord John at the City Election; and I was the original of\r\nthe live rats, which took well. But there’s a good time coming to pay\r\nLord Johnny off.\r\n\r\n“Some of the tunes--there’s no act of parliament about tunes, you know,\r\nsir--was stunners on the fiddle; as if a thousand bricks was falling\r\nout of a cart at once. I think ‘The Pope and Cardinal Wiseman,’ one\r\nof the first of the songs, did as well as any. This werse was greatly\r\nadmired:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Now Lord John Russell did so bright,\r\n    to the Bishop of Durham a letter write\r\n  Saying while I’ve a hand I’ll fight,\r\n    The pope and cardinal wiseman,\r\n  Lord John’s ancestor as I tell,\r\n    Lord William Russell then known well\r\n  His true religion would not sell,\r\n    A martyr he in glory fell,\r\n  And now Lord John so bold and free,\r\n    Has got a rope as we may see,\r\n  To hang up on each side of a tree,\r\n    The pope and cardinal wiseman.’\r\n\r\n“This finishing werse, too, was effective, and out came a few browns:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Now we don’t care a fig for Rome,\r\n    why can’t they let the girls alone,\r\n  And mind their business at home,\r\n    the pope and cardinal wiseman.\r\n  With their monsical red cardinals hat,\r\n    And lots of wafers in a sack,\r\n  If they come here with all their clack,\r\n    we’ll wound them fil fal la ra whack,\r\n  In England they shall not be loose,\r\n    Their hum bugging is all no use,\r\n  If they come here we’ll cook their goose,\r\n    The pope and Cardinal Wiseman.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS\r\n\r\n  Monks and Nuns and fools afloat,\r\n    We’ll have no bulls shoved down our throat,\r\n  Cheer up and shout down with the Pope,\r\n    And his bishop cardinal Wiseman.’\r\n\r\n“Then there was another, sir. ‘The Pope he is coming; oh, crikey,\r\noh dear!’ to the tune of the ‘Camels are coming.’ There was one bit\r\nthat used to tickle them. I mayn’t exactly remember it, for I didn’t\r\ndo anything beyond a spurt in it, and haven’t a copy for you, but it\r\ntickled ’em with others. This was the bit:--\r\n\r\n  ‘I’ve heard my old grandmother’s grandmother say,\r\n  They burnt us in Smithfield full ten every day.\r\n  O, what shall I do, for I feel very queer,\r\n  The Pope he’s a-coming, oh! crikey, oh, dear!’\r\n\r\n“Bless you, sir, if I see a smart dressed servant girl looking shyly\r\nout of the street-door at us, or through the area railings, and I can\r\nget a respectful word in and say, ‘My good young lady, do buy of a poor\r\nfellow, we haven’t said a word to your servants, we hasn’t seen any on\r\n’em,’ then she’s had, sir, for 1_d._ at least, and twice out of thrice;\r\nthat ‘good young lady’ chloroforms her.\r\n\r\n“Then this one, now, is stunning. It’s part of what the Queen was a\r\ngoing to sing at the opening of the parliament, but she changed her\r\nmind, and more’s the pity, for it would have had a grand effect. It’s\r\ncalled ‘The Queen, the Pope, and the Parliament,’ and these is the best\r\nof the stanzas; I calls them werses in common, but stanzas for Wick:\r\n\r\n  ‘My lords and my gentlemen all,\r\n    The bishops and great house of commons\r\n  On you for protection I call,\r\n    For you know I am only a woman,\r\n  I am really quite happy indeed--\r\n    To meet you like birds of a feather,\r\n  So I hope you will all struggle with me,\r\n    And pull away boys altogether,\r\n  My name is Victoria the Queen.\r\n\r\n  ‘Our bishops and deans did relent,\r\n    And say they for ever was undone,\r\n  Bishop Philpott a long challenge sent\r\n    To his lordship the bishop of London,\r\n  To fight him on Hounslow Heath--\r\n    But the bishop of London was coosey,\r\n  He gave him one slap in the mouth,\r\n    And then sent a letter to pusey,\r\n  No humbuggery stories for vick--\r\n\r\n  ‘I heard my old grandfather say\r\n    His great grandmother easily loved reckon\r\n  When they made a fool run away,\r\n    Whose name was king Jemmy the second.\r\n  Billy gave him a ticket for soup,\r\n    Though Bill married old Jemmy’s daughter\r\n  He knocked him from old Palace yard,\r\n    To Ireland, across the Boyne water,\r\n  Long life to Victoria the Queen.\r\n\r\n  ‘Come here my old friend Joey Hume,\r\n    I know you in silence wont mope now,\r\n  Go up and get inside the moon\r\n    And make fast a great torry rope now,\r\n  And then give a spring and a jump\r\n    And you to a peerage shall rise then,\r\n  For we’ll swing up old Pius the Pope\r\n    And his eminence cardinal Wiseman,\r\n  Old England and down with the Pope.’\r\n\r\n“Then there wasn’t no risk with Haynau--I told you of the Pope first,\r\n’cause he was most chaunted--no fear of a _ferricadouzer_ for the\r\nbutcher. How is it spelled, sir? Well, if you can’t find it in the\r\ndictionary, you must use your own judgment. What does it mean? It means\r\na dewskitch (a good thrashing). I’ve been threatened with dark nights\r\nabout the Pope, after the Greeks has said: ‘Fat have you to say agin\r\nthe holy gintleman? To the divil wid all the likes o’ ye.’ Haynau was a\r\nfair stage and no favour. This werse was best liked:--\r\n\r\n  ‘The other day as you must know,\r\n    In Barclay’s brewhouse he did go\r\n  And signed his bloody name “Haynau.”\r\n    The fellow that flogged the women.\r\n  Baron Rothchild did him shend,\r\n    And in the letter which he penn’d\r\n  He shaid the sheneral wash his friend,\r\n    And so good a man he could not mend.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS\r\n\r\n  Rumpsey bumsy--bang him well--\r\n    Make his back and sides to swell\r\n  Till he roars aloud with dreadful yell,\r\n    The fellow that flogged the women.’\r\n\r\n“The women bought very free; poor women, mostly; we only worked him to\r\nany extent in the back drags. One old body at Stepney was so pleased\r\nthat she said, ‘O, the bloody-minded willain! Whenever you come this\r\nway again, sir, there’s always 1_d._ for you.’ She didn’t pay in\r\nadvance though.\r\n\r\n“Then it ended, sir, with a beautiful moral as appeals to every female\r\nbosom:--\r\n\r\n  ‘That man who would a female harm,\r\n    Is never fit to live.’\r\n\r\n“We always likes something for the ladies, bless ’em. They’re our best\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n“Then there was poor Jael Denny, but she was humped, sir, and I’ve told\r\nyou the reason. Her copy of werses began:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Since Corder died on Buystree,\r\n    No mortal man did read or see,\r\n  Of such a dreadful tragedy,\r\n    As I will now unfold.\r\n  A maid in bloom--to her silent tomb,\r\n    Is hurried in the prime of life,\r\n  How could a villain cause such strife\r\n    She worthy was a famous wife.\r\n      The like was seldom told.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  She was young and gay,\r\n    Like the flowers of may,\r\n  In youth and vigour health and bloom,\r\n    She is hurried to the silent tomb.\r\n  Through Essex, such a dreadfull gloom,\r\n    Jael Denny’s murder caused.’\r\n\r\n“My last chaunt was Jane Wilbred; and her werses--and they did tidy\r\nwell--began:--\r\n\r\n  ‘A Case like this you seldom read,\r\n    Or one so sad and true,\r\n  And we sincerely hope the perper-\r\n    trators both will rue\r\n  To serve a friendless servant girl,\r\n    Two years they did engage,\r\n  Her name it is Jane Willbred,\r\n    And eighteen years of age.’\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the Great Exhibition, sir? I shall be there. Me\r\nand my mates. We are going to send in a copy of werses in letters of\r\ngold for a prize. _We’ll_ let the foreigners know what the real native\r\nmelodies of England is, and no mistake.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DEATH AND FIRE HUNTERS.\r\n\r\nI have described the particular business of the running patterer,\r\nwho is known by another and a very expressive cognomen--as a “Death\r\nHunter.” This title refers not only to his vending accounts of all the\r\nmurders that become topics of public conversation, but to his being\r\na “murderer” on his own account, as in the sale of “cocks” mentioned\r\nincidentally in this narrative. If the truth be saleable, a running\r\npatterer prefers selling the truth, for then--as one man told me--he\r\ncan “go the same round comfortably another day.” If there be no truths\r\nfor sale--no stories of criminals’ lives and loves to be condensed from\r\nthe diffusive biographies in the newspapers--no “helegy” for a great\r\nman gone--no prophecy and no crim. con.--the death hunter invents, or\r\nrather announces, them. He puts some one to death for the occasion,\r\nwhich is called “a cock.” The paper he sells may give the dreadful\r\ndetails, or it may be a religious tract, “brought out in mistake,”\r\nshould the vendor be questioned on the subject; or else the poor fellow\r\nputs on a bewildered look and murmurs, “O, it’s shocking to be done\r\nthis way--but I can’t read.” The patterers pass along so rapidly that\r\nthis detection rarely happens.\r\n\r\nOne man told me that in the last eight or ten years, he, either singly\r\nor with his “mob,” had twice put the Duke of Wellington to death,\r\nonce by a fall from his horse, and the other time by a “sudden and\r\nmyst-_e_rious” death, without any condescension to particulars. He had\r\ntwice performed the same mortal office for Louis Phillipe, before that\r\npotentate’s departure from France; each death was by the hands of an\r\nassassin; “one was stabbing, and the other a shot from a distance.” He\r\nonce thought of poisoning the Pope, but was afraid of the street Irish.\r\nHe broke Prince Albert’s leg, or arm, (he was not sure which), when\r\nhis royal highness was out with his harriers. He never had much to say\r\nabout the Queen; “it wouldn’t go down,” he thought, and perhaps nothing\r\nhad lately been said. “Stop, there, sir,” said another patterer, of\r\nwhom I inquired as to the correctness of those statements, (after my\r\nconstant custom in sifting each subject thoroughly,) “stop, stop, sir.\r\nI _have_ had to say about the Queen lately. In coorse, nothing can be\r\nsaid against her, and nothing ought to; that’s true enough, but the\r\nlast time she was confined, I cried her _accouchement_ (the word was\r\npronounced as spelt to a merely English reader, or rather more broadly)\r\nof _three_! Lord love you, sir, it would have been no use crying _one_;\r\npeople’s so used to that; but a Bobby came up and he stops me, and\r\nsaid it was some impudence about the Queen’s _coachman_! Why look at\r\nit, says I, fat-head--I knew I was safe--and see if there’s anything\r\nin it about the Queen or her coachman! And he looked, and in coorse\r\nthere was nothing. I forget just now what the paper _was_ about.” My\r\nfirst-mentioned informant had apprehended Feargus O’Connor on a charge\r\nof high treason. He assassinated Louis Napoleon, “from a _fourth_\r\nedition of the _Times_,” which “did well.” He caused Marshal Haynau to\r\ndie of the assault by the draymen. He made Rush hang himself in prison.\r\nHe killed Jane Wilbred, and put Mrs. Sloane to death; and he announced\r\nthe discovery that Jane Wilbred was Mrs. Sloane’s daughter.\r\n\r\nThis informant did not represent that he had originated these little\r\npieces of intelligence, only that he had been a party to their\r\nsale, and a party to originating one or two. Another patterer--and\r\nof a higher order of genius--told me that all which was stated was\r\nundoubtedly correct, “but me and my mates, sir,” he said, “did Haynau\r\nin another style. A splendid slum, sir! Capital! We assassinated\r\nhim--_mys_-terious. Then about Rush. His hanging hisself in prison was\r\na fake, I know; but we’ve had him lately. His ghost appeared--as is\r\nshown in the Australian papers--to Emily Sandford, and threatened her;\r\nand took her by the neck, and there’s the red marks of his fingers to\r\nbe seen on her neck to this day!” The same informant was so loud in his\r\npraise of the “Ass-sass-sination” of Haynau that I give the account. I\r\nhave little doubt it was his own writing. It is confused in passages,\r\nand has a blending of the “I” and the “we:”--\r\n\r\n “We have just received upon undisputed authority, that, that savage\r\n and unmanly tyrant, that enemy to civil and religious liberty, the\r\n inhuman Haynau has at last finished his career of guilt by the hand of\r\n an assassin, the term assassin I have no doubt will greet harshly upon\r\n the ears of some of our readers, yet never the less I am compelled\r\n to use it although I would gladly say the _average_ of outraged\r\n innocence, which would be a name more suitable to one who has been the\r\n means of ridden the world of such a despicable monster.”\r\n\r\n[My informant complained bitterly, and not without reason, of the\r\nprinter. “Average,” for instance (which I have _italicised_), should be\r\n“avenger.” The “average of outraged innocence!”]\r\n\r\n “It appears by the Columns of the Corour le Constituonal of Brussels,”\r\n runs the paper, “that the evening before last, three men one of\r\n which is supposed to be the miscreant, Haynau entered a Cafe in the\r\n Neighbourhood of Brussels kept by a man in the name of Priduex,\r\n and after partaking of some refreshments which were ordered by his\r\n two companions they desired to be shown to their chambers, during\r\n their stay in the public or Travellers Room, they spoke but little\r\n and seemed to be very cautious as to joining in the conversations\r\n which was passing briskly round the festive board, which to use the\r\n landlord’s own words was rather strange, as his Cafe was mostly\r\n frequented by a set of jovial fellows. M. Priduex goes on to state\r\n that after the three strangers had retired to rest some time a tall\r\n and rather noble looking man enveloped in a large cloak entered and\r\n asked for a bed, and after calling for some wine he took up a paper\r\n and appeared to be reading it very attentively, in due time he was\r\n shown to bed and all passed on without any appearance of anything\r\n wrong until about 6 o’clock in the morning, when the landlord and his\r\n family, were roused by a noise over head and cries of murder, and\r\n upon going up stairs to ascertain the cause, he discovered the person\r\n who was [known] to be Marshal Haynau, lying on his bed with his throat\r\n cut in a frightful manner, and his two companions standing by his bed\r\n side bewailing his loss. On the table was discovered a card, on which\r\n was written these words ‘Monster, I am avenged at last.’ Suspicion\r\n went upon the tall stranger, who was not anywhere to be found, the\r\n Garde arms instantly were on the alert, and are now in active persuit\r\n of him but up to the time of our going to press nothing further has\r\n transpired.”\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to stigmatise the death-hunter when he sets off all\r\nthe attractions of a real or pretended murder,--when he displays\r\non a board, as does the standing patterer, “illustrations” of “the\r\n’dentical pick-axe” of Manning, or the stable of Good,--or when he\r\ninvents or embellishes atrocities which excite the public mind. He\r\ndoes, however, but follow in the path of those who are looked up to as\r\n“the press,”--as the “fourth estate.” The conductors of the _Lady’s\r\nNewspaper_ sent an artist to Paris to give drawings of the scene of\r\nthe murder by the Duc de Praslin,--to “illustrate” the blood-stains\r\nin the duchess’s bed-chamber. The _Illustrated London News_ is prompt\r\nin depicting the locality of any atrocity over which the curious in\r\ncrime may gloat. The _Observer_, in costly advertisements, boasts\r\nof its 20 columns (sometimes with a supplement) of details of some\r\nvulgar and mercenary bloodshed,--the details being written in a most\r\nhonest deprecation of the morbid and savage tastes to which the\r\nwriter is pandering. Other weekly papers have engravings--and only\r\nconcerning murder--of any wretch whom vice has made notorious. Many\r\nweekly papers had expensive telegraphic despatches of Rush’s having\r\nbeen hung at Norwich, which event, happily for the interest of Sunday\r\nnewspapers, took place in Norwich at noon on a Saturday. [I may here\r\nremark, that the patterers laugh at telegraphs and express trains for\r\nrapidity of communication, boasting that the press strives in vain to\r\nrival _them_,--as at a “hanging match,” for instance, the patterer\r\nhas the full particulars, dying speech, and confession included--if a\r\nconfession be feasible--ready for his customers the moment the drop\r\nfalls, and while the criminal may still be struggling, at the very\r\nscene of the hanging. At a distance he sells it before the hanging. “If\r\nthe _Times_ was cross-examined about it,” observed one patterer, “he\r\nmust confess he’s outdone, though he’s a rich _Times_, and we is poor\r\nfellows.” But to resume--]\r\n\r\nA penny-a-liner is reported, and without contradiction, to have\r\nmade a large sum by having hurried to Jersey in Manning’s business,\r\nand by being allowed to accompany the officers when they conducted\r\nthat paltry tool of a vindictive woman from Jersey to Southampton\r\nby steamer, and from Southampton to London by “special engine,” as\r\nbeseemed the popularity of so distinguished a rascal and homicide;\r\nand next morning the daily papers, in all the typographical honour\r\nof “leads” and “a good place,” gave details of this fellow’s--this\r\nManning’s--conversation, looks, and demeanour.\r\n\r\nUntil the “respectable” press become a more healthful public\r\ninstructor, we have no right to blame the death-hunter, who is but an\r\nimitator--a follower--and that for a meal. So strong has this morbid\r\nfeeling about criminals become, that an earl’s daughter, who had “an\r\norder” to see Bedlam, would not leave the place until she had obtained\r\nOxford’s autograph for her album! The rich vulgar are but the poor\r\nvulgar--without an excuse for their vulgarity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Next to murders, fires are tidy browns,” I was told by a patterer\r\nexperienced both in “murders” and “fires.” The burning of the old\r\nHouses of Parliament was very popular among street-sellers, and for\r\nthe reason which ensures popularity to a commercial people; it was a\r\nsource of profit, and was certainly made the most of. It was the work\r\nof incendiaries,--of ministers, to get rid of perplexing papers,--of\r\ngovernment officers with troublesome accounts to balance,--of a\r\nsporting lord, for a heavy wager,--of a conspiracy of builders,--and\r\nof “a unsuspected party.” The older “hands” with whom I conversed on\r\nthe subject, all agreed in stating that they “did well” on the fire.\r\nOne man said, “No, sir, it wasn’t only the working people that bought\r\nof me, but merchants and their clerks. I s’pose they took the papers\r\nhome with ’em for their wives and families, which is a cheap way of\r\ndoing, as a newspaper costs 3_d._ at least. But stop, sir,--stop; there\r\nwasn’t no threepennies then,--nothing under 6_d._, if they wasn’t more;\r\nI can’t just say, but it was better for us when newspapers was high. I\r\nnever heard no sorrow expressed,--not _in_ the least. Some said it was\r\na good job, and they wished the ministers was in it.” The burning of\r\nthe Royal Exchange was not quite so beneficial to the street-sellers,\r\nbut “was uncommon tidy.” The fire at the Tower, however, was almost as\r\ngreat a source of profit as that of the Houses of Parliament, and the\r\nfollowing statement shows the profit reaped.\r\n\r\nMy informant had been a gentleman’s servant, his last place being\r\nwith a gentleman in Russell-square, who went to the East Indies,\r\nand his servant was out of a situation so long that he “parted with\r\neverything.” When he was at the height of his distress, he went to see\r\nthe fire at the Tower, as he “had nothing better to do.” He remained\r\nout some hours, and before he reached his lodging, men passed him,\r\ncrying the full and true particulars of the fire. “I bought one,”\r\nsaid the man, “and changed my last shilling. It was a sudden impulse,\r\nfor I saw people buy keenly. I never read it, but only looked at the\r\nprinter’s name. I went to him at the Dials, and bought some, and so I\r\nwent into the paper trade. I made 6_s._ or 7_s._ some days, while the\r\nTower lasted; and 3_s._ and 4_s._ other days, when the first polish was\r\noff. I sold them mostly at 1_d._ a piece at first. It was good money\r\nthen. The Tower was good, or middling good, for from 14 to 20 days.\r\nThere was at least 100 men working nothing but the Tower. There’s\r\nno great chance of any more great buildings being burnt; worse luck.\r\nPeople don’t care much about private fires. A man in this street don’t\r\nheed so much who’s burnt to death in the next. But the foundation-stone\r\nof the new Royal Exchange--fire led to that--was pretty fair, and\r\nportraits of Halbert went off, so that it was for two or three days\r\nas good as the Tower. Fires is our best friends next to murders, if\r\nthey’re _good_ fires. The hopening of the Coal Exchange was rather\r\ntidy. I’ve been in the streets ever since, and don’t see how I could\r\npossibly get out of them. At first I felt a great degradation at being\r\ndriven to the life. I shunned grooms and coachmen, as I might be known\r\nto them. I didn’t care for others. That sort of feeling wears out\r\nthough. I’m a widower now, and my family feels, as I did at first,\r\nthat what I’m doing is ‘low.’ They won’t assist--though they may give\r\nme 1_s._ now and then--but they won’t assist me to leave the streets.\r\nThey’ll rather blame me for going into them, though there was only\r\nthat, or robbing, or starving. The fire at Ben. Caunt’s, where the\r\npoor children was burnt to hashes, was the best of the private house\r\nfires that I’ve worked, I think. I made 4_s._ on it one day. He was\r\nthe champion once, and was away at a fight at the time, and it was a\r\nshocking thing, and so people bought.”\r\n\r\nAfter the burning of York Minster by Jonathan Martin, I was told by an\r\nold hand, the (street) destruction of the best known public buildings\r\nin the country was tried; such as Canterbury Cathedral, Dover Castle,\r\nthe Brighton Pavilion, Edinburgh Castle, or Holyrood House--all known\r\nto “travelling” patterers--but the success was not sufficiently\r\nencouraging. It was no use, I was told, firing such places as Hampton\r\nCourt or Windsor Castle, for unless people _saw_ the reflection of a\r\ngreat fire, they wouldn’t buy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SELLERS OF SECOND EDITIONS.\r\n\r\nThese “second editions” are, and almost universally, second or later\r\neditions of the newspapers, morning and evening, but three-fourths\r\nof the sale may be of the evening papers, and more especially of the\r\n_Globe_ and _Standard_.\r\n\r\nI believe that there is not now in existence--unless it be in a\r\nworkhouse and unknown to his fellows, or engaged in some other\r\navocation and lost sight of by them--any one who sold “second editions”\r\n(the _Courier_ evening paper being then in the greatest demand) at\r\nthe time of the Duke of York’s Walcheren expedition, at the period\r\nof the battle of the Nile, during the continuance of the Peninsular\r\nwar, or even at the battle of Waterloo. There were a few old men--some\r\nof whom had been soldiers or sailors, and others who have simulated\r\nit--surviving within these 5 or 6 years, and some later, who “worked\r\nWaterloo,” but they were swept off, I was told, by the cholera.\r\n\r\nI was assured by a gentlemen who had a perfect remembrance of the\r\n“second editions” (as they were generally called) sold in the streets,\r\nand who had often bought them upwards of forty years ago, that a sketch\r\nin the “Monthly Review,” in a notice of Scott’s “Lord of the Isles”\r\n(published in 1815), gave the best notion he had met with of what the\r\nsecond edition sale really was. At the commencement of the sixth canto\r\nof his poem, Sir Walter, somewhat too grandiloquently, in the judgment\r\nof his reviewer, asks--\r\n\r\n  “O who, that shared them, ever shall forget\r\n  The emotions of the spirit-rousing time,\r\n  When breathless in the mart the couriers met,\r\n  Early and late, at evening and at prime?”\r\n\r\n“Who,” in his turn asks the reviewer, “can avoid conjuring up the idea\r\nof men with broad sheets of foolscap, scored with ‘VICTORIES’ rolled\r\nround their hats, and horns blowing loud defiance in each other’s\r\nmouth, from the top to the bottom of Pall-mall or the Haymarket, when\r\nhe reads such a passage? We actually hear the Park and Tower guns,\r\nand the clattering of ten thousand bells, as we read, and stop our\r\nears from the close and sudden intrusion of some hot and _horn-fisted_\r\npatriot, blowing ourselves, as well as Bonaparte to the devil!”\r\n\r\nThe horn carried by these “_horn_-fisted” men was a common tin tube,\r\nfrom two to three feet long, and hardly capable of being made to\r\nproduce any sound beyond a sudden and discordant “trump, trump.” The\r\nmen worked with papers round their hats, in a way not very dissimilar\r\nto that of the running patterers of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe “editions” cried by these men during the war-time often contained\r\nspurious intelligence, but for that the editors of the journals were\r\nresponsible--or the stock-jobbers who had imposed upon them. Any\r\none who has consulted a file of newspapers of the period to which\r\nI have referred, will remember how frequent, and how false, were\r\nthe announcements, or the rumours, of the deaths of Bonaparte, his\r\nbrothers, or his marshals, in battle or by assassination.\r\n\r\nAs there was no man who was personally conversant with this traffic in\r\nwhat is emphatically enough called the “war-time,” I sought out an old\r\nstreet-patterer who had been acquainted with the older hands in the\r\ntrade, whose experience stretched to the commencement of the present\r\ncentury, and from him I received the following account:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he began, “I’ve worked ‘seconds.’ We used to call the\r\neditions generally seconds, and cry them sometimes, as the _latest_\r\neditions, whatever it was. There was Jack Griffiths, sir,--now wasn’t\r\nhe a hand at a second edition? I believe you. I do any kind of patter\r\nnow myself, but I’ve done tidy on second editions, when seconds was to\r\nbe had. Why, Jack Griffiths, sir--he’d been a sailor and was fond of\r\ntalking about the sea--Jack Griffiths--you would have liked to have\r\nheard him--Jack told me that he once took 10_s._ 6_d._--it was Hyde\r\nPark way--for a second edition of a paper when Queen Caroline’s trial\r\nwas over. Besides Jack, there was Tom Cole, called the Wooden Leg\r\n(he’d been a soldier I believe), and Whitechapel, and Old Brummagem,\r\nand Hell-fire Jack. Hell-fire Jack was said to be something to a\r\nman that was a trainer, and a great favourite of the old Duke of\r\nQueensberry, and was called Hell-fire Dick; but I can’t say how it was.\r\nI began to work second editions, for the first time when George IV.\r\ndied. They went off pretty well at 1_s._ a piece, and for three or four\r\nI got 2_s._ 6_d._ If it’s anything good I get 1_s._ still, but very\r\nseldom any more. I always show anybody that asks that the paper _is_\r\njust what I’ve cried it. There’s no regular cry; we cries what’s up:\r\n‘_Here’s_ the second edition of the _Globe_ with the full perticlers of\r\nthe death of his Majesty King George IV.’ We work much in the same way\r\nas the running patter. Three of us shouts in the same spot. I was one\r\nof three who one night sold five quires, mostly _Globe_ and _Standard_.\r\nIt was at the Reform Bill time, and something about the Reform Bill. I\r\nnever much heeded what the paper was about. I only wanted the patter,\r\nand soon got it. A mate, or any of us, looks out for anything good in\r\nthe evening papers, to be ready. Why that night I speak of I was kept\r\nrunning backards and for’ards to the newspaper offices--and how they\r\ndoes keep you waiting at times!--mostly the _Globe_ and _Standard_;\r\nwe worked them all at the West End. There’s twenty-seven papers to a\r\nquire, and we gave 4_d._ a piece for ’em and sold none, as well as I\r\nmind, for under 1_s._ I carried them mostly under my arm or in my hat,\r\ntaking care they wasn’t spoiled. Belgrave-square way, and St. George’s,\r\nHanover-square way, and Hyde Park way, are the best. The City’s no\r\ngood. There’s only sixpences there. The coffee-shops has spoiled the\r\nCity, as I’m afeard they will other parts. Murders in second editions\r\ndon’t sell now, and aren’t tried much, beyond a few, if there’s a late\r\nverdict. Curviseer (Courvoisier) was tidy. The trial weren’t over ’til\r\nevening, and I sold six papers, and got 7_s._ for them, to gentlemen\r\ngoing away by the mail. I’ve heard that Greenacre was good in the same\r\nway, but I wasn’t in town at the time. The French Revolution--the last\r\none--was certainly a fairish go. Lewis Fillup was good many ways. When\r\nhe used to be shot at--if the news weren’t too early in the day--and\r\nwhen he got to England, and when he was said to have got back, or to\r\nhave been taken. Why, of course he wern’t to compare with Rush in the\r\nregular patter, but he was very fair. I have nothing to say against\r\nhim, and wish he was alive, and could do it all over again. Lord\r\nBrougham’s death wern’t worth much to us. You remember the time, I\r\ndare say, sir, when they said he killed hisself in the papers, to see\r\nwhat folks would say on him. The resignation of a prime minister is\r\nmostly pretty good. Lord Melbourne was, and so was Sir Robert Peel.\r\nThere’s always somebody to say, ‘Hurra! that’s right!’ and to buy a\r\npaper because he’s pleased. I had a red paper in my hat when I worked\r\nthe French Revolution. French news is generally liked in a fashionable\r\ndrag. Irish news is no good, for people don’t seem to believe it. Smith\r\nO’Brien’s battle, though, did sell a little. It’s not possible to tell\r\nyou exactly what I’ve made on seconds. How can I? One week I may have\r\ncleared 1_l._ in them, and for six months before not a blessed brown.\r\nPerhaps--as near as I can recollect and calculate--I’ve cleared 3_l._\r\n(if that) each year, one with another, in second editions in my time,\r\nand perhaps twenty others has done the same.”\r\n\r\nAnother man who also knew the old hands said to me: “Lord bless us,\r\nhow times is changed! you should have heard Jack Griffiths tell how\r\nhe cried his gazettes: ‘_He-ere’s_ the _London Gazette_ Ex-terornary,\r\ncontaining the hof-ficial account of the bloody and decisive wictory\r\nof Sally-manker.’ Something that way. Patter wern’t required then; the\r\nthings sold theirselves. Why, the other day I was talking to a young\r\nchap that conceits hisself to be a hout-and-houter in patter, and I\r\nmentions Jack’s crying Gazettes and getting 5_s._ apiece for many a one\r\non ’em, and this young chap says, says he: ‘_Gazettes!_ What did they\r\ncry _Gazettes_?--bankrupts, and all that?’ ‘Bankrupts be blowed!’ said\r\nI, ‘wictories!’ I heerd Waterloo cried when I was a little ’un. The\r\nspeeches on the opening of parliament, which the newspapers has ready,\r\nhas no sale in the crowd to what they had. I only sold two papers at\r\n6_d._ each this last go. I ventured on no more, or should have been\r\na loser. If the Queen isn’t there, none’s sold. But we always has a\r\nspeech ready, as close as can be got from what the morning papers says.\r\nOne gent. said to me: ‘But that ain’t the real speech!’ ‘It’s a far\r\nbetter,’ says I, and so it is. Why now, sir, there’s some reading and\r\nspirit in this bit. The Queen says:\r\n\r\n ‘It is my determination by the assistance of divine providence to\r\n uphold and protect the Protestant Church of the British Empire, which\r\n has been enjoyed three hundred years without interuption, the Religion\r\n which our ancestors struggled to obtain. And as long as it shall\r\n please God to spare me, I will endeavour to maintain the rights and\r\n perogatives of our holy Protestant Church. And now my Lords, I leave\r\n you to your duties, to the helm of the state, to the harbour of peace,\r\n and happiness.’”\r\n\r\nThis man showed me the street speech, which was on a broad sheet set\r\noff with the royal arms. The topics and arrangement were the same as\r\nthose in the speech delivered by her Majesty.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning last (Feb. 24), I asked the man who told me\r\nthat prime ministers’ resignations were “pretty good” for the\r\nstreet traffic, if he had been well remunerated by the sale of the\r\nevening papers of Saturday, with the account of Lord John Russell’s\r\nresignation. “It wern’t tried, sir,” he answered; “there was nothing\r\nnew in the evenings, and we thought nobody seemed to care about it.\r\nThe newspaper offices and their boarders (as he called the men going\r\nabout with announcements on boards) didn’t make very much of it, so\r\nwe got up a song instead, but it was no good,--not salt to a fresh\r\nherring--for there was some fresh herrings in. It was put strong,\r\nthough. This was the last verse:\r\n\r\n  ‘From the House to the Palace it has caused a bother,\r\n  Old women are tumbling one over another,\r\n  The Queen says it is with her, one thing or ’tother,\r\n        They must not discharge Little John;\r\n  Her Majesty vows that she is not contented,\r\n  And many ere long will have cause to repent it,\r\n  Had she been in the house she would nobly resent it,\r\n        And fought like a brick for Lord John.’”\r\n\r\nAdopting the calculation of my first informant, and giving a profit\r\nof 150 per cent., we find 150_l._ yearly expended in the streets, in\r\nsecond editions, or probably it might be more correct to say 200_l._ in\r\na year of great events, and 50_l._ in a year when such events are few.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STANDING PATTERERS.\r\n\r\nThe standing patterer I have already described in his resemblance to\r\nthe mountebank of old, and how, like his predecessor, he required\r\na “pitch” and an audience. I need but iterate that these standing\r\npatterers are men who remain in one place, until they think they have\r\nexhausted the custom likely to accrue there, or until they are removed\r\nby the police; and who endeavour to attract attention to their papers,\r\nor more commonly pamphlets, either by means of a board with coloured\r\npictures upon it, illustrative of the contents of what they sell, or\r\nelse by gathering a crowd round about them, in giving a lively or\r\nhorrible description of the papers or books they are “working.” The\r\nformer is what is usually denominated in street technology, “board\r\nwork.” A few of the standing patterers give street recitations or\r\ndialogues.\r\n\r\nSome of the “illustrations” most “in vogue” of late for the boards\r\nof the standing patterers were,--the flogging of the nuns of Minsk,\r\nthe blood streaming from their naked shoulders, (anything against\r\nthe Emperor of Russia, I was told, was a good street subject for a\r\npainting); the young girl, Sarah Thomas, who murdered her mistress\r\nin Bristol, dragged to the gallows by the turnkeys and Calcraft, the\r\nhangman; Calcraft himself, when charged with “starving his mother;”\r\nHaynau, in the hands of the draymen; the Mannings, and afterwards the\r\nSloanes. The two last-mentioned were among the most elaborate, each\r\nhaving a series of “compartments,” representing the different stages of\r\nthe events in which those heroes and heroines flourished. I shall speak\r\nafterwards of street-artists who are the painters of these boards,\r\nand then describe the pictures more fully. There are also, as before\r\nalluded to, what may be called “cocks” in street paintings, as well as\r\nstreet literature.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most favourite themes of the standing patterers were,\r\nhowever, the “Annals of the White House in Soho-square,” and the\r\n“Mysteries of Mesmerism.” Both supplied subjects to the boards.\r\n\r\nThe White House was a notorious place of ill fame. Some of the\r\napartments, it is said, were furnished in a style of costly\r\nluxury; while others were fitted up with springs, traps, and other\r\ncontrivances, so as to present no appearance other than that of an\r\nordinary room, until the machinery was set in motion. In one room,\r\ninto which some wretched girl might be introduced, on her drawing a\r\ncurtain as she would be desired, a skeleton, grinning horribly, was\r\nprecipitated forward, and caught the terrified creature in his, to all\r\nappearance, bony arms. In another chamber the lights grew dim, and then\r\nseemed gradually to go out. In a little time some candles, apparently\r\nself-ignited, revealed to a horror stricken woman, a black coffin, on\r\nthe lid of which might be seen, in brass letters, ANNE, or whatever\r\nname it had been ascertained the poor wretch was known by. A sofa, in\r\nanother part of the mansion, was made to descend into some place of\r\nutter darkness; or, it was alleged, into a room in which was a store of\r\nsoot or ashes.\r\n\r\nInto the truth or exaggeration of these and similar statements, it\r\nis not my business to inquire; but the standing patterer made the\r\nmost of them. Although the house in question has been either rebuilt\r\nor altered--I was told that each was the case--and its abominable\r\ncharacter has ceased to apply to it for some years, the patterer\r\ndid not scruple to represent it as still in existence (though he\r\nmight change the venue as to the square at discretion) and that all\r\nthe atrocities perpetrated--to which I have not ventured even to\r\nallude--were still the ordinary procedures of “high life.” Neither\r\ndid the standing patterer scruple, as one man assured me, to “name\r\nnames;” to attribute vile deeds to any nobleman or gentleman whose\r\nname was before the public; and to embellish his story by an allusion\r\nto a recent event. He not unfrequently ended with a moral exhortation\r\nto all ladies present to avoid this “abode of iniquity for the rich.”\r\nThe board was illustrated with skeletons, coffins, and other horrors;\r\nbut neither on it, nor in a hardly intelligible narrative which the\r\npatterer sold, was there anything indecent.\r\n\r\nThe “Mysteries of Mesmerism” was an account of the marvels of that\r\n“newly-discovered and most wonderful power in natur and art.” With\r\nit Dr. Elliotson’s, or some well-known name, was usually associated,\r\nand any marvel was “pattered,” according to the patterer’s taste and\r\njudgment. The illustrations were of persons, generally women, in a\r\nstate of coma, but in this also there was no indecency; nor was there\r\nin the narrative sold.\r\n\r\nOf these two popular exhibitions there are, I am informed, none now in\r\ntown, and both, I was told, was more the speculations of a printer, who\r\nsent out men, than in the hands of the regular patterers.\r\n\r\nIt may tend somewhat to elucidate the character of the patterers, if\r\nI here state, that in my conversation with the whole of them, I heard\r\nfrom their lips strong expressions of disgust at Sloane,--far stronger\r\nthan were uttered in abhorrence of any murderer. Rush, indeed, was, and\r\nis, a popular man among them. One of them told me, that not long before\r\nMadame Tussaud’s death, he thought of calling upon that “wenerable\r\nlady,” and asking her, he said, “to treat me to something to drink the\r\nimmortal memory of Mr. Rush, my friend and her’n.”\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by all concerned in the exercise of street elocution,\r\nthat “the stander” must have “the best of patter.” He usually works\r\nalone,--there are very rarely two at standing patter,--and beyond\r\nhis board he has no adventitious aids, as in the running patter, so\r\nthat he must be all the more effective; but the board is pronounced\r\n“as good as a man.” When the standing patterer visits the country, he\r\nis accompanied by a mate, and the “copy of werses” is then announced\r\nas being written by an “under-paid curate” within a day’s walk. “It\r\ntells mostly, sir,” said one man; “for it’s a blessing to us that\r\nthere always is a journeyman parson what the people knows, and what\r\nthe patter fits.” Sometimes the poetry is attributed to a sister of\r\nmercy, or to a popular poetess; very frequently, by the patterers who\r\nbest understand the labouring classes, to Miss Eliza Cook. Sometimes\r\nthe verses are written by “a sympathising gent. in that parish,” but\r\nhis name wasn’t to be mentioned. Another intelligent patterer whom I\r\nquestioned on the subject, told me that my information was correct.\r\n“It’s just the same in the newspapers,” he continued; “why the\r\n‘sympathising gent.’ is the same with us as what in the newspapers is\r\ncalled “other intelligence (about any crime), to publish which might\r\ndefeat the ends of justice.” That means, they know nothing at all about\r\nit, and can’t so much as venture on a guess. I’ve known a little about\r\nit for the papers, sir,--it doesn’t matter in what line.”\r\n\r\nSome standing patterers are brought up to the business from childhood.\r\nSome take to it through loss of character, or through their inability\r\nto obtain a situation from intemperate habits, and some because “a\r\nfree life suits me best.” In a former inquiry into a portion of this\r\nsubject, I sought a standing patterer, whom I found in a threepenny\r\nlodging-house in Mint-street, Southwark. On my inquiring what induced\r\nhim to adopt, or pursue, that line of life, he said:--\r\n\r\n“It was distress that first drove me to it. I had learnt to make willow\r\nbonnets, but that branch of trade went entirely out. So, having a wife\r\nand children, I was drove to write out a paper that I called ‘The\r\nPeople’s Address to the King on the Present State of the Nation.’ I got\r\nit printed, and took it into the streets and sold it. I did very well\r\nwith it, and made 5_s._ a day while it lasted. I never was brought up\r\nto any mechanical trade. My father was a clergyman” [here he cried\r\nbitterly]. “It breaks my heart when I think of it. I have as good a\r\nwife as ever lived, and I would give the world to get out of my present\r\nlife. It would be heaven to get away from the place where I am. I am\r\nobliged to cheer up my spirits. If I was to give way to it, I shouldn’t\r\nlive long. It’s like a little hell to be in the place where we live”\r\n[crying], “associated with the ruffians that we are. My distress of\r\nmind is awful, but it won’t do to show it at my lodgings--they’d only\r\nlaugh to see me down-hearted; so I keep my trouble all to myself. Oh,\r\nI am heartily sick of this street work--the insults I have to put up\r\nwith--the drunken men swearing at me. Yes, indeed, I am heartily sick\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nThis poor man had some assistance forwarded to him by benevolent\r\npersons, after his case had appeared in my letter in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_. This was the means of his leaving the streets, and starting\r\nin the “cloth-cap trade.” He seemed a deserving man.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE OF A STANDING PATTERER.\r\n\r\nFrom one of this body I received, at the period just alluded to, the\r\nfollowing information:--\r\n\r\n“I have taken my 5_s._ a day (said my informant); but ‘paper’ selling\r\nnow isn’t half so good as it used to be. People haven’t got the money\r\nto lay out; for it all depends with the working man. The least we take\r\nin a day is, upon an average, sixpence; but taking the good and bad\r\ntogether, I should say we take about 10_s._ a week. I know there’s some\r\nget more than that, but then there’s many take less. Lately, I know,\r\nI haven’t taken 9_s._ a week myself, and people reckon me one of the\r\nbest patterers in the trade. I’m reckoned to have the gift--that is,\r\nthe gift of the gab. I never works a last dying speech on any other\r\nthan the day of execution--all the edge is taken off of it after that.\r\nThe last dying speeches and executions are all printed the day before.\r\nThey’re always done on the Sunday, if the murderers are to be hung on\r\nthe Monday. I’ve been and got them myself on the Sunday night, over\r\nand over again. The flying stationers goes with the papers in their\r\npockets, and stand under the drop, and as soon as ever it falls, and\r\nlong before the breath is out of the body, they begin bawling out.”\r\n[Here my informant gave a further account of the flying stationers\r\nunder the gallows, similar to what I have given. He averred that they\r\n“invented every lie likely to go down.”] “‘Here you have also an exact\r\nlikeness,’ they say, ‘of the murderer, taken at the bar of the Old\r\nBailey!’ when all the time it is an old wood-cut that’s been used for\r\nevery criminal for the last forty years. I know the likeness that was\r\ngiven of Hocker was the one that was given for Fauntleroy; and the\r\nwood-cut of Tawell was one that was given for the Quaker that had\r\nbeen hanged for forgery twenty years before. Thurtell’s likeness was\r\ndone expressly for the ‘papers;’ and so was the Mannings’ and Rush’s\r\nlikenesses too. The murders are bought by men, women, and children.\r\nMany of the tradespeople bought a great many of the affair of the\r\nMannings. I went down to Deptford with mine, and did uncommonly well.\r\nI sold all off. Gentlefolks won’t have anything to do with murders\r\nsold in the street; they’ve got other ways of seeing all about it. We\r\nlay on the horrors, and picture them in the highest colours we can.\r\nWe don’t care what’s in the ‘papers’ in our hands. All we want to do\r\nis to sell ’em; and the more horrible we makes the affairs, the more\r\nsale we have. We do very well with ‘love-letters.’ They are ‘cocks;’\r\nthat is, they are all fictitious. We give it out that they are from\r\na tradesman in the neighbourhood, not a hundred yards from where we\r\nare a-standing. Sometimes we say it’s a well-known sporting butcher;\r\nsometimes it’s a highly respectable publican--just as it will suit\r\nthe tastes of the neighbourhood. I got my living round Cornwall for\r\none twelvemonth with nothing else than a love-letter. It was headed,\r\n‘A curious and laughable love-letter and puzzle, sent by a sporting\r\ngentleman to Miss H--s--m, in _this_ neighbourhood;’ that suits any\r\nplace that I may chance to be in; but I always patter the name of the\r\nstreet or village where I may be. This letter, I say, is so worded,\r\nthat had it fallen into the hands of her mamma or papa, they could\r\nnot have told what it meant; but the young lady, having so much wit,\r\nfound out its true meaning, and sent him an answer in the same manner.\r\nYou have here, we say, the number of the house, the name of the place\r\nwhere she lives (there is nothing of the kind, of course), and the\r\ninitials of all the parties concerned. We dare not give the real\r\nnames in full, we tell them; indeed, we do all we can to get up the\r\npeople’s curiosity. I did very well with the ‘Burning of the House of\r\nCommons.’ I happened by accident to put my pipe into my pocket amongst\r\nsome of my papers, and burnt them. Then, not knowing how to get rid\r\nof them, I got a few straws. I told the people that my burnt papers\r\nwere parliamentary documents that had been rescued from the flames,\r\nand that, as I dare not sell them, I would let them have a straw for\r\na penny, and give them one of the papers. By this trick I got rid of\r\nmy stock twice as fast, and got double the price that I should have\r\ndone. The papers had nothing at all to do with the House of Commons.\r\nSome was ‘Death and the Lady,’ and ‘Death and the Gentleman,’ and\r\nothers were the ‘Political Catechism,’ and 365 lies, Scotch, English,\r\nand Irish, and each lie as big round as St. Paul’s. I remember a party\r\nnamed Jack Straw, who laid a wager, half-a-gallon of beer, that he’d\r\nbring home the money for two dozen blank papers in one hour’s time.\r\nHe went out into the Old-street-road, and began a patter about the\r\npolitical affairs of the nation, and Sir Robert Peel, and the Duke of\r\nWellington, telling the public that he dared not sell his papers, they\r\nwere treasonable; so he gave them with a straw--that he sold for one\r\npenny. In less than the hour he was sold clean out, and returned and\r\ndrank the beer. The chief things that I work are quarter-sheets of\r\nrecitations and dialogues. One is ‘Good Advice to Young Men on Choosing\r\ntheir Wives.’ I have done exceedingly well with that--it’s a good moral\r\nthing. Another is the ‘Drunkard’s Catechism;’ another is ‘The Rent Day;\r\nor, the Landlord gathering his Rents.’ This is a dialogue between the\r\nlandlord and his tenant, beginning with ‘Good morning, Mrs. Longface;\r\nhave you got my rent ready, ma’am?’ The next one is ‘The Adventures\r\nof Larry O’Flinn.’ It’s a comic story, and a very good got-up thing.\r\nAnother is ‘A Hint to Husbands and Wives;’ and ‘A Pack of Cards turned\r\ninto a Bible, a Prayer-book, and an Almanack.’ These cards belonged\r\nto Richard Middleton, of the 60th regiment of foot, who was taken a\r\nprisoner for playing at cards in church during divine service. But the\r\nbest I do is ‘The Remarkable Dream of a Young Man of loose character,\r\nwho had made an agreement to break into a gentleman’s house at twelve\r\nat night on Whitsun Monday, but, owing to a little drink that he took,\r\nhe had a remarkable dream, and dreamed he was in hell. The dream had\r\nsuch influence on his mind that he refused to meet his comrade. His\r\ncomrade was taken up for the burglary, found guilty, and executed for\r\nit. This made such an impression on the young man’s mind that he became\r\na reformed character.’ There is a very beautiful description of hell in\r\nthis paper,” said my informant, “that makes it sell very well among the\r\nold women and the apprentice lads, for the young man was an apprentice\r\nhimself. It’s all in very pretty poetry, and a regular ‘cock.’ The\r\npapers that I work chiefly are what are called ‘the standing patters;’\r\nthey’re all of ’em stereotype, and some of them a hundred years old. We\r\nconsider the ‘death hunters’ are the lowest grade in the trade. We can\r\nmake most money of the murders while they last, but they don’t last,\r\nand they merely want a good pair of lungs to get them off. But it’s\r\nnot every one, sir, that can work the standing patters. Many persons\r\nI’ve seen try at it and fail. One old man I knew tried the ‘Drunkard’s\r\nCatechism’ and the ‘Soldier’s Prayer-book and Bible.’ He could manage\r\nto patter these because they’ll almost work themselves; but ‘Old Mother\r\nClifton’ he broke down in. I heard him do it in Sun-street and in the\r\nBlackfriars-road; but it was such a dreadful failure--he couldn’t\r\nhumour it a bit--that, thinks I to myself, you’ll soon have to give\r\nup, and sure enough he’s never been to the printer’s since. He’d a\r\nvery poor audience, chiefly boys and girls, and they were laughing at\r\nhim because he made so many blunders in it. A man that’s never been to\r\nschool an hour can go and patter a dying speech or ‘A Battle between\r\nTwo Ladies of Fortune.’ They require no scholarship. All you want is\r\nto stick a picture on your hat, to attract attention, and to make all\r\nthe noise you can. It’s all the same when they does an ‘Assassination\r\nof Louis Philippe,’ or a ‘Diabolical Attempt on the Life of the\r\nQueen’--a good stout pair of lungs and plenty of impudence is all that\r\nis required. But to patter ‘Bounce, the Workhouse Beadle, and the\r\nExamination of the Paupers before the Poor-law Commissioners,’ takes a\r\ngood head-piece and great gift of the gab, let me tell you. It’s just\r\nthe same as a play-actor. I can assure you I often feel very nervous.\r\nI begin it, and walk miles before I can get confidence in myself to\r\nmake the attempt. I got rid of two quire last night. I was up among\r\nthe gentlemen’s servants in Crawford-street, Baker-street, and I had\r\na very good haul out of the grown-up people. I cleared 1_s._ 8_d._\r\naltogether. I did that from seven till nine in the evening. It’s all\r\nchance-work. If it’s fine, and I can get a crowd of grown-up people\r\nround me, I can do very well, but I can’t do anything amongst the boys.\r\nThere’s very little to be done in the day-time. I begin at ten in the\r\nday, and stop out till one. After that I starts off again at five, and\r\nleaves off about ten at night. Marylebone, Paddington, and Westminster\r\nI find the best places. The West-end is very good the early part of\r\nthe week, for any thing that’s genteel, such as the ‘Rich Man and his\r\nWife quarrelling because they have no Family.’ Our customers there are\r\nprincipally the footmen, the grooms, and the maid-servants. The east\r\nend of the town is the best on Friday and Saturday evenings. I very\r\noften go to Limehouse on Friday evening. Most part of the dock-men are\r\npaid then, and anything comic goes off well among them. On Saturdays\r\nI go to the New-cut, Ratcliff-highway, the Brill, and such places. I\r\nmake mostly 2_s._ clear on a Saturday night. After nineteen years’\r\nexperience of the patter and paper line in the streets, I find that\r\na foolish nonsensical thing will sell twice as fast as a good moral\r\nsentimental one; and, while it lasts, a good murder will cut out the\r\nwhole of them. It’s the best selling thing of any. I used at one time\r\nto patter religious tracts in the street, but I found no encouragement.\r\nI did the ‘Infidel Blacksmith’--that would not sell. ‘What is\r\nHappiness? a Dialogue between Ellen and Mary’--that was no go. No more\r\nwas the ‘Sorrows of Seduction.’ So I was driven into the comic standing\r\npatters.”\r\n\r\nThe more recent “experiences” of standing patterers, as they were\r\ndetailed to me, differ so little in subject, or anything else, from\r\nwhat I have given concerning running patterers, that to cite them would\r\nbe a repetition.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information to be obtained, I have no doubt that there\r\nare always at least 20 standing patterers--sometimes they are called\r\n“boardmen”--at work in London. Some of them “run” occasionally, but an\r\nequal number or more, of the regular “runners” resort now and then to\r\nthe standing patter, so the sum is generally kept up.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the drawbacks of bad weather, which affects\r\nthe standing, and does not affect the running, patterer; and\r\nnotwithstanding the more frequent interruptions of the police, I am of\r\nopinion that the standing patterer earns on an average 1_s._ a week\r\nmore than his running brother. His earnings too are often all his own;\r\nwhereas the runners are a ‘school,’ and, their gains divided. More\r\nrunning patterers become, on favourable occasions, stationary, with\r\nboards, perhaps in the proportion of five to four, than the stationary\r\nbecome itinerant. One standing patterer told me, that, during the\r\nexcitement about the Sloanes, he cleared full 3_s._ a day for more than\r\na week; but at other times he had cleared only 1_s._ 6_d._ in a whole\r\nweek, and he had taken nothing when the weather was too wet for the\r\nstanding work, and there was nothing up to “run” with.\r\n\r\nIf, then, 20 standing patterers clear 10_s._ weekly, each, the year\r\nthrough--“taking” 15_s._ weekly--we find that 780_l._ is yearly\r\nexpended in the standing patter of London streets.\r\n\r\nThe capital required for the start of the standing is greater than that\r\nneeded by the running patterer. The painting for a board costs 3_s._\r\n6_d._; the board and pole, with feet, to which it is attached, 5_s._\r\n6_d._; and stock-money, 2_s._; in all, 11_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF POLITICAL LITANIES, DIALOGUES, ETC.\r\n\r\nTo “work a litany” in the streets is considered one of the higher\r\nexercises of professional skill on the part of the patterer. In working\r\nthis, a clever patterer--who will not scruple to introduce anything\r\nout of his head which may strike him as suitable to his audience--is\r\nvery particular in his choice of a mate, frequently changing his\r\nordinary partner, who may be good “at a noise” or a ballad, but not\r\nhave sufficient acuteness or intelligence to patter politics as if\r\nhe understood what he was speaking about. I am told that there are\r\nnot twelve patterers in London whom a critical professor of street\r\nelocution will admit to be capable of ‘working a catechism’ or a\r\nlitany. “Why, sir,” said one patterer, “I’ve gone out with a mate to\r\nwork a litany, and he’s humped it in no time.” To ‘hump,’ in street\r\nparlance, is equivalent to ‘botch,’ in more genteel colloquialism. “And\r\nwhen a thing’s humped,” my informant continued, “you can only ‘call a\r\ngo.’” To ‘call a go,’ signifies to remove to another spot, or adopt\r\nsome other patter, or, in short, to resort to some change or other in\r\nconsequence of a failure.\r\n\r\nAn elderly man, not now in the street trade, but who had “pattered off\r\na few papers” some years ago, told me that he had heard three or four\r\nold hands--“now all dead, for they’re a short-lived people”--talk of\r\nthe profits gained and the risk ran by giving Hone’s parodies on the\r\nCatechism, Litany, St. Athanasius’ Creed, &c. in the streets, after\r\nthe three consecutive trials and the three acquittals of Hone had made\r\nthe parodies famous and Hone popular. To work them in the streets was\r\ndifficult, “for though,” said my informant, “there was no new police\r\nin them days, there was plenty of officers and constables ready to\r\npull the fellows up, and though Hone was acquitted, a beak that wanted\r\nto please the high dons, would find some way of stopping them that\r\nsold Hone’s things in the street, and so next to nothing could be done\r\nthat way, but a little was done.” The greatest source of profit, I\r\nlearned from the reminiscences of the same man, was in the parlours and\r\ntap-rooms of public-houses, where the patterers or reciters were well\r\npaid “for going through their catechisms,” and sometimes, that there\r\nmight be no interruption, the door was locked, and even the landlord\r\nand his servants excluded. The charge was usually 2_d._ a copy, but\r\n1_d._ was not refused.\r\n\r\nDuring Queen Caroline’s trial there were the like interruptions and\r\nhindrances to similar performances; and the interruptions continued\r\nduring the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Bill until about the\r\nera of the Reform Bill, and then the hindrance was but occasional. “And\r\nperhaps it was our own fault, sir,” said one patterer, “that we was\r\nthen molested at all in the dialogues and catechisms and things; but we\r\nwas uncommon bold, and what plenty called sarcy, at that time: we was\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nThus this branch of a street profession continued to be followed, half\r\nsurreptitiously, until after the subsidence of the political ferment\r\nconsequent on the establishment of a new franchise and the partial\r\nabolition of an old one. The calling, however, has never been popular\r\namong street purchasers, and I believe that it is sometimes followed by\r\na street-patterer as much from the promptings of the pride of art as\r\nfrom the hope of gain.\r\n\r\nThe street-papers in the dialogue form have not been copied nor derived\r\nfrom popular productions--but even in the case of Political Litanies\r\nand Anti-Corn-law Catechisms and Dialogues are the work of street\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nOne intelligent man told me, that properly to work a political litany,\r\nwhich referred to ecclesiastical matters, he “made himself up,” as well\r\nas limited means would permit, as a bishop! and “did stunning, until\r\nhe was afraid of being stunned on skilly.” Of the late papers on the\r\nsubject of the Pope, I cite the one which was certainly the best of\r\nall that appeared, and concerning which indignant remonstrances were\r\naddressed to some of the newspapers. The “good child” in the patter,\r\nwas a tall bulky man; the examiner (also the author), was rather\r\ndiminutive:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “_The old English Bull John_ v. _the Pope’s Bull of Rome_.\r\n\r\n “My good Child as it is necessary at this very important crisis; when,\r\n that good pious and very reasonable old gentleman Pope Pi-ass the\r\n nineth has promised to favor us with his presence, and the pleasures\r\n of Popery--and trampled on the rights and privilages which, we, as\r\n Englishmen, and Protestants, have engaged for these last three hundred\r\n years--Since Bluff, king Hal. began to take a dislike to the broad\r\n brimmed hat of the venerable Cardinal Wolsey, and proclaimed himself\r\n an heretic; It is necessary I say, for you, and all of you, to be\r\n perfect in your Lessons so as you may be able to verbly chastize this\r\n saucy prelate, his newly made Cardinal Foolishman, and the whole\r\n host of Puseites and protect our beloved Queen, our Church, and our\r\n Constitution.\r\n\r\n “_Q._ Now my boy can you tell me what is your Name?\r\n\r\n “_A._ B---- Protestant.\r\n\r\n “_Q._ How came you by that name?\r\n\r\n “_A._ At the time of Harry the stout, when Popery was in a galloping\r\n consumption the people protested against the surpremacy and instalence\r\n of the Pope; and his Colleges had struck deep at the hallow tree of\r\n superstition I gained the name of Protestant, and proud am I, and ever\r\n shall be to stick to it till the day of my death.\r\n\r\n  “_Let us say._\r\n\r\n “From all Cardinals whether wise or foolish. Oh! Queen Spare us.\r\n\r\n  “_Spare us, Oh Queen._\r\n\r\n “From the pleasure of the Rack, and the friendship of the kind hearted\r\n officers of the Inquisition. Oh! Johnny hear us.\r\n\r\n  “_Oh! Russell hear us._\r\n\r\n “From the comforts of being frisled like a devil’d kindney. Oh! Nosey\r\n save us.\r\n\r\n  “_Hear us Oh Arthur._\r\n\r\n “From such saucy Prelates, as Pope Pi-ass. Oh! Cumming’s save us.\r\n\r\n  “_Save us good Cumming._\r\n\r\n “And let us have no more Burnings in smithfield, no more warm drinks\r\n in the shape of boiled oil, or, molten lead, and send the whole\r\n host of Pusyites along with the Pope, Cardinals to the top of mount\r\n Vesuvius there to dine off of hot lava, so that we may live in peace &\r\n shout long live our Queen, and No Popery!”\r\n\r\nFor some pitches the foregoing was sufficient, for a street auditory\r\n“hates too long a patter;” but where a favourable opportunity offered,\r\neasily tested by the pecuniary beginnings, the “Lesson of the Day” was\r\ngiven in addition, and was inserted after the second “Answer” in the\r\nforegoing parody, so preceding the “Let us say:”\r\n\r\n\r\n “_The Lesson of the Day._\r\n\r\n “You seem an intelligent lad, so I think you are quite capable of\r\n Reading with me the Lessons for this day’s service.\r\n\r\n “Now the Lesson for the day is taken from all parts of the Book of\r\n Martyr’s, beginning at just where you like.\r\n\r\n “It was about the year 1835, that a certain renagade of the name of\r\n Pussy--I beg his pardon, I mean Pusey, like a snake who stung his\r\n master commenced crawling step by step, from the master; he was bound\r\n to serve to worship a puppet, arrayed in a spangle and tincel of a\r\n romish showman.\r\n\r\n “And the pestelance that he shed around spread rapidly through the\r\n minds of many unworthy members of our established Church; even up to\r\n the present year, 1850, inasmuch that St Barnabus, of Pimlico, unable\r\n to see the truth by the aid of his occulars, mounted four pounds of\r\n long sixes in the mid-day, that he might see through the fog of his\r\n own folly, by which he was surrounded.\r\n\r\n “And Pope Pi-ass the nineth taking advantage of the hubub, did create\r\n unto himself a Cardinal in the person of one Wiseman of Westminster.\r\n\r\n “And Cardinal broadbrim claimed four counties in England as his\r\n dioces, and his master the Pope claimed as many more as his sees, but\r\n the people of England could not see that, so they declared aloud they\r\n would see them blowed first.\r\n\r\n “So when Jack Russell heard of his most impudent intentions, he sent\r\n him a Letter saying it was the intention of the people of England\r\n never again to submit to their infamous mumerys for the burnings in\r\n Smithfield was still fresh in their memory.\r\n\r\n “And behold great meetings were held in different parts of England\r\n where the Pope was burnt in effigy, like unto a Yarmouth Bloater, as a\r\n token of respect for him and his followers.\r\n\r\n “And the citizens of London were stanch to a man, and assembled\r\n together in the Guildhall of our mighty City and shouted with\r\n stentarian lungs, long live the Queen and down with the Pope, the\r\n sound of which might have been heard even unto the vatican of Rome.\r\n\r\n “And when his holyness the Pope heard that his power was set at\r\n naught, his nose became blue even as a bilberry with rage and declared\r\n Russell and Cummings or any who joined in the No Popery cry, should\r\n ever name the felisity of kissing his pious great toe.\r\n\r\n  “_Thus Endeth the Lesson._”\r\n\r\nIn the course of my inquiries touching this subject I had more than\r\nonce occasion to observe that an acute patterer had always a reason,\r\nor an excuse for anything. One quick-witted Irishman, whom I knew to\r\nbe a Roman Catholic, was “working” a “patter against the Pope,” (not\r\nthe one I have given), and on my speaking to him on the subject, and\r\nsaying that I supposed he did it for a living, he replied: “That’s it\r\nthen, sir. You’re right, sir, yes. I work it just as a Catholic lawyer\r\nwould plead against a Catholic paper for a libel on Protestants--though\r\nin his heart he knew the paper was right--and a Protestant lawyer\r\nwould defend the libel hammer and tongs. Bless you, sir, you’ll not\r\nfind much more honour that way among us (laughing) than among them\r\nlawyers; not much.” The readiness with which the sharpest of those men\r\nplead the doings not only of tradesmen, but of the learned and sacred\r\nprofessions, to justify themselves, is remarkable.\r\n\r\nSometimes a dialogue is of a satirical nature. One man told me that\r\nthe “Conversation between Achilles and the Wellington Statue,” of\r\nwhich I give the concluding moiety, was “among the best,” (he meant\r\nfor profit), “but no great thing.” My informant was Achilles--or, as\r\nhe pronounced it, Atchilees--and his mate was the statue, or “man on\r\nthe horse.” The two lines, in the couplet form, which precede every\r\ntwo paragraphs of dialogue, seem as if they represent the speakers\r\nwrongfully. The answer should be attributed, in each case, to Achilles.\r\n\r\n  “The hoarse voice it came from the statue of Achilles\r\n  And ’twas answer’d thus by the man on the horse.\r\n\r\n “Little man of little mind havn’t I now got iron blinds, and\r\n bomb-proof rails when danger assails, a cunning devised job, to keep\r\n out an unruly mob, with high and ambitious views and remarkable queer\r\n shoes; I say, Old Nakedness, I say, come and see my frontage over the\r\n way, but I believe you can’t get out after ten!\r\n\r\n “No, you’re as near where you are as at Quatre Bras, I hear a great\r\n deal what the public think and feel, plain as the nose on your face,\r\n we’re deemed a national disgrace; they grumble at your high-ness, and\r\n at my want of shyness, and say many unpleasant things of Ligny and\r\n Marchienne!\r\n\r\n  “The hoarse voice it came from the statue of Achilles\r\n  And ’twas answer’d thus by the man on the horse.\r\n\r\n “Ah! its a few days since the Nive, where Soult found me all alive,\r\n and the grand toralloo I made at Bordeaux; wasn’t I in a nice mess,\r\n when Boney left Elba and left no address, besides 150 other jobs with\r\n the chill off I could bring to view.\r\n\r\n “But then people will say, poor unfortunate Ney, and that you were\r\n dancing at a ball, and not near Hogumont at all, and that the job of\r\n St. Helena might have been done rather cleaner, and it was a shameful\r\n go to send Sir Hudson Lowe, and that you took particular care of No.\r\n 1, at Waterloo.\r\n\r\n  “The hoarse voice it came from the statue of Achilles\r\n  And ’twas answer’d thus by the man on the horse.\r\n\r\n “Why flog ’em and ’od ’rot em, who said ‘Up Guards and at ’em!’ and\r\n you know that nice treat I received in Downing Street, when hooted by\r\n a thousand or near, defended by an old grenadier, so no whopping I\r\n got, good luck to his old tin pot, oh! there’s a deal of brass in me\r\n I’ll allow.\r\n\r\n “Its prophecied you’ll break down, they’re crying it about town, and\r\n many jokes are past, that you’re brought to the scaffold at last,\r\n and they say I look black, because I’ve no shirt to my back, and its\r\n getting broad daylight, I vow!\r\n\r\n  “The hoarse voice it came from the statue of Achilles\r\n  But ’twas answer’d thus by the man on the horse.\r\n\r\n  “H. V. HOOKER.”\r\n\r\nOf parodies other than the sort of compound of the Litany and other\r\nportions of the Church Service, which I have given, there are none in\r\nthe streets--neither are there political duets. Such productions as\r\nparodies on popular songs, “Cab! cab! cab!” or “Trip! trip! trip!” are\r\nnow almost always derived, for street-service, from the concert-rooms.\r\nBut they relate more immediately to ballads, or street song; and not to\r\npatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “COCKS,” ETC.\r\n\r\nThese “literary forgeries,” if so they may be called, have already\r\nbeen alluded to under the head of the “Death and Fire Hunters,” but it\r\nis necessary to give a short account of a few of the best and longest\r\nknown of those stereotyped; no new cocks, except for an occasion, have\r\nbeen printed for some years.\r\n\r\nOne of the stereotyped cocks is, the “Married Man Caught in a Trap.”\r\nOne man had known it sold “for years and years,” and it served, he\r\nsaid, when there was any police report in the papers about sweethearts\r\nin coal-cellars, &c. The illustration embraces two compartments. In\r\none a severe-looking female is assaulting a man, whose hat has been\r\nknocked off by the contents of a water-jug, which a very stout woman is\r\npouring on his head from a window. In the other compartment, as if from\r\nan adjoining room, two women look on encouragingly. The subject matter,\r\nhowever, is in no accordance with the title or the embellishment. It is\r\na love-letter from John S--n to his most “adorable Mary.” He expresses\r\nthe ardour of his passion, and then twits his adored with something\r\nbeyond a flirtation with Robert E--, a “decoyer of female innocence.”\r\nPlacably overlooking this, however, John S--n continues:--\r\n\r\n “My dearest angel consent to my request, and keep me no longer in\r\n suspense--nothing, on my part, shall ever be wanting to make you\r\n happy and comfortable. My apprenticeship will expire in four months\r\n from hence, when I intend to open a shop in the small ware line, and\r\n your abilities in dress-making and self-adjusting stay-maker, and the\r\n assistance of a few female mechanics, we shall be able to realize an\r\n independency.”\r\n\r\n“Many a turn in seductions talked about in the papers and not talked\r\nabout nowhere,” said one man, “has that slum served for, besides other\r\nthings, such as love-letters, and confessions of a certain lady in this\r\nneighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nAnother old cock is headed, “Extraordinary and Funny Doings in this\r\nNeighbourhood.” The illustration is a young lady, in an evening dress,\r\nsitting with an open letter in her hand, on a sort of garden-seat, in\r\nwhat appears to be a churchyard. After a smart song, enforcing the\r\never-neglected advice that people should “look at home and mind their\r\nown business,” are two letters, the first from R. G.; the answer from\r\nS. H. M. The gentleman’s epistle commences:--\r\n\r\n  “Madam,\r\n\r\n  “The love and tenderness I have hitherto expressed for\r\n  you is false, and I now feel that my indifference towards\r\n  you increases every day, and the more I see you the more\r\n  you appear ridiculous in my eyes and contemptible--\r\n  I feel inclined & in every respect disposed & determined\r\n  to hate you. Believe me, I never had any inclination\r\n  to offer you my hand.”\r\n\r\nThe lady responds in a similar strain, and the twain appear very angry,\r\nuntil a foot-note offers an explanation: “By reading every other line\r\nof the above letters the true meaning will be found.”\r\n\r\nOf this class of cocks I need cite no other specimens, but pass on to\r\none of another species--the “Cruel and Inhuman Murder Committed on the\r\nBody of Capt. Lawson.” The illustration is a lady, wearing a coronet,\r\nstabbing a gentleman, in full dress, through the top button of his\r\nwaistcoat. The narrative commences:--\r\n\r\n “WITH surprise we have learned that this neighbourhood for a length\r\n of time was amazingly alarmed this day by a crowd of people carrying\r\n the body of Mr. James Lawless, to a doctor while streams of blood\r\n besmeared the way in such a manner that the cries of Murder re-echoed\r\n the sound of numerous voices. It appears that the cause of alarm,\r\n originated through a court-ship attended with a solemn promise of\r\n marriage between him and miss Lucy Guard, a handsome young Lady of\r\n refined feelings with the intercourse of a superior enlightened mind\r\n she lived with her aunt who spared neither pain nor cost to improve\r\n the talents of miss G. those seven years past, since the death of her\r\n mother in Ludgate Hill, London, and bore a most excellent character\r\n until she got entangled by the delumps alcurement of Mr. L.”\r\n\r\nThe writer then deplores Miss Guard’s fall from virtue, and her\r\ndesertion by her betrayer, “on account of her fortune being small.”\r\nCapt. Lawson, or Mr. James Lawless, next woos a wealthy City maiden,\r\nand the banns are published. What follows seems to me to be a rather\r\nintricate detail:--\r\n\r\n “We find that the intended bride learned that Miss Guard, held certain\r\n promissory letters of his, and that she was determined to enter an\r\n action against him for a breach of promise, which moved clouded\r\n Eclipse over the extacy of the variable miss Lawless who knew that\r\n Miss G had Letters of his sufficient to substantiate her claims in a\r\n court.”\r\n\r\nLawson visits Miss Guard to wheedle her out of his letters, but “she\r\ndrew a large carving-knife and stabbed him under the left breast.” At\r\nthe latest account the man was left without hope of recovery, while\r\n“the valiant victress” was “ordered to submit to judicial decorum in\r\nthe nineteenth year of her age.” The murders and other atrocities for\r\nwhich this “cock” has been sponsor, are--I was informed emphatically--a\r\nthundering lot!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS OF STREET-ART--No. II.\r\n\r\nMurder of Captain Lawson.\r\n\r\n(A “COCK.”)]\r\n\r\nI conclude with another cock, which may be called a narrative “on\r\na subject,” as we have “ballads on a subject” (afterwards to be\r\ndescribed), but with this difference, that the narrative is fictitious,\r\nand the ballad must be founded on a real event, however embellished.\r\nThe highest newspaper style, I was told, was aimed at. Part of the\r\nproduction reads as if it had done service during the Revolution of\r\nFebruary, 1848.\r\n\r\n “Express from Paris. Supposed Death of LOUIS NAPOLEON. We stop the\r\n press to announce, That Luis Napoleon has been assasinated, by some\r\n it is said he is shot dead, by others that he is only wounded in the\r\n right arm.\r\n\r\n “We have most important intelligence from Paris. That capital is in\r\n a state of insurrection. The vivacious people, who have herefore\r\n defeated the goverment by paving-stones, have again taken up those\r\n missiles. On Tuesday the Ministers forbade the reform banquet, and\r\n the prefect of police published a proclamation warning the people to\r\n respect the laws, which he declared were violated, and he meant to\r\n enforce them. But the people dispised the proclamation and rejected\r\n his authority. They assembled in great multitudes round the Chambers\r\n of Deputies, and forced their way over the walls. They were attacked\r\n by the troops and dispersed, but, re-assembled in various quarters.\r\n They showed their hatred of M. Guizot by demolishing his windows\r\n and attempting to force an entrance into his hotel, but were again\r\n repulced by the troops. All the military in Paris, and all the\r\n National Guard, have been summoned to arms, and every preparation made\r\n on the part of the government to put down the people.\r\n\r\n “The latter have raised barricades in various places, and have unpaved\r\n the streets, overturned omnibusses, and made preparations for a\r\n vigorous assault, or a protracted resistance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “Five o’Closk--At this moment the Rue St. Honore is blockaded by a\r\n detachment dragoons, who fill the market-place near the Rue des Petits\r\n Champs, and are charging the people sword in hand, carriages full of\r\n deople are being taken to the hospitals.\r\n\r\n “In fact the maddest excitement reigns throughout the capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “Half past Six.--During the above we have instituted enquiries at the\r\n Foreign office, they have not received any inteligence of the above\r\n report, if it has come, it must have been by pigeon express. We have\r\n not given the above in our columns with a view of its authenticity,\r\n any further information as soon as obtained shall be immediately\r\n announced to the public.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “STRAWING.”\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to “strawing,” which can hardly be described\r\nas quackery. It is rather a piece of mountebankery. Many a\r\nquack--confining the term to its most common signification, that of a\r\n“quack doctor”--has faith in the excellence of his own nostrums, and so\r\nproffers that which he believes to be curative: the strawer, however,\r\nsells what he _knows_ is not what he represents it.\r\n\r\nThe strawer offers to _sell_ any passer by in the streets a straw and\r\nto _give_ the purchaser a paper which he _dares not_ sell. Accordingly\r\nas he judges of the character of his audience, so he intimates that the\r\npaper is political, libellous, irreligious, or indecent.\r\n\r\nI am told that as far back as twenty-five or twenty-six years, straws\r\nwere sold, but only in the country, with leaves from the _Republican_,\r\na periodical published by Carlile, then of Fleet-street, which had\r\nbeen prosecuted by the government; but it seems that the trade died\r\naway, and was little or hardly known again until the time of the trial\r\nof Queen Caroline, and then but sparingly. The straw sale reached\r\nits highest commercial pitch at the era of the Reform Bill. The most\r\nsuccessful trader in the article is remembered among the patterers as\r\n“Jack Straw,” who was oft enough represented to me as the original\r\nstrawer. If I inquired further, the answer was: “He was the first in my\r\ntime.” This Jack Straw was, I am told, a fine-looking man, a natural\r\nson of Henry Hunt, the blacking manufacturer. He was described to me\r\nas an inveterate drunkard and a very reckless fellow. One old hand was\r\ncertain that this man was Hunt’s son, as he himself had “worked” with\r\nhim, and was sometimes sent by him when he was “in trouble,” or in\r\nany strait, to 32, Broadwall, Blackfriars, for assistance, which was\r\nusually rendered. (This was the place where Hunt’s “Matchless Blacking”\r\nand “Roasted Corn” were vended.) Jack Straw’s principal “pitch” was\r\nat Hyde Park Corner, “where,” said the man whom I have mentioned as\r\nworking with him, “he used to come it very strong against Old Nosey,\r\nthe Hyde Park bully as he called him. To my knowledge he’s made 10_s._,\r\nand he’s made 15_s._ on a night. O, it didn’t matter to him what he\r\nsold with his straws, religion or anything. There was no three-pennies\r\n(threepenny newspapers) then, and he had had a gentleman’s education,\r\nand knew what to say, and so the straws went off like smoke.” The\r\narticles which this man “durst not sell” were done up in paper, so that\r\nno one could very well peruse them on the spot, as a sort of stealth\r\nwas implied. On my asking Jack Straw’s co-worker if he had ever drank\r\nwith him, “Drank with him!” he answered, “Yes, many a time. I’ve gone\r\nout and pattered, or chaunted, or anything, to get money to buy him two\r\nglasses of brandy--and good brandy was very dear then--before he could\r\nstart, for he was all of a tremble until he had his medicine. If I\r\ncouldn’t get brandy, it was the best rum, ’cause he had all the tastes\r\nof a gentleman. Ah! he’s been dead some years, sir, but where he died I\r\ndon’t know. I only heard of his death. He was a nice kindly fellow.”\r\n\r\nThe _ruse_ in respect of strawing is not remarkable for its\r\noriginality. It was an old smuggler’s trick to _sell_ a sack and _give_\r\nthe keg of contraband spirit placed within it and padded out with straw\r\nso as to resemble a sack of corn. The hawkers, prior to 1826, when Mr.\r\nHuskisson introduced changes into the Silk Laws, _gave_ “real Ingy\r\nhandkerchiefs” (sham) to a customer, and _sold_ him a knot of tape for\r\nabout 4_s._ The price of a true Bandana, then prohibited, and sold\r\nopenly in the draper’s shops, was about 8_s._ The East India Company\r\nimported about a million of Bandanas yearly; they were sold by auction\r\nfor exportation to Hamburgh, &c., at about 4_s._ each, and were nearly\r\nall smuggled back again to England, and disposed of as I have stated.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give anything like statistics as to the money\r\nrealised by strawing. A well-informed man calculated that when the\r\ntrade was at its best, or from 1832 to 1836, there might be generally\r\nfifty working it in the country and twenty in London; they did not\r\nconfine themselves, however, to strawing, but resorted to it only on\r\nfavourable opportunities. Now there are none in London--their numbers\r\ndiminished gradually--and very rarely any in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SHAM INDECENT STREET-TRADE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those callings which are at once repulsive and\r\nludicrous; repulsive, when it is considered under what pretences the\r\npapers are sold, and ludicrous, when the disappointment of the gulled\r\npurchaser is contemplated.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that one of the allurements held out by the strawer\r\nwas that his paper--the words used by Jack Straw--could “not be\r\nadmitted into families.” Those following the “sham indecent trade” for\r\na time followed his example, and professed to sell straws and give away\r\npapers; but the London police became very observant of the sale of\r\nstraws--more especially under the pretences alluded to--and it has, for\r\nthe last ten years, been rarely pursued in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe plan now adopted is to sell the sealed packet itself, which the\r\n“patter” of the street-seller leads his auditors to believe to be some\r\nimproper or scandalous publication. The packet is some coloured paper,\r\nin which is placed a portion of an old newspaper, a Christmas carol, a\r\nreligious tract, or a slop-tailor’s puff (given away in the streets for\r\nthe behoof of another class of gulls). The enclosed paper is, however,\r\nnever indecent.\r\n\r\nFrom a man who had, not long ago, been in this trade, I had the\r\nfollowing account. He was very anxious that nothing should be said\r\nwhich would lead to a knowledge that he was my informant. After having\r\nexpressed his sorrow that he had ever been driven to this trade from\r\ndistress, he proceeded to justify himself. He argued--and he was not an\r\nignorant man--that there was neither common sense nor common justice\r\nin interfering with a man like him, who, “to earn a crust, pretended\r\nto sell what _shop-keepers_, that must pay church and all sorts of\r\nrates, sold without being molested.” The word “shopkeepers” was uttered\r\nwith a bitter emphasis. There are, or were, he continued, shops--for\r\nhe seemed to know them all--and some of them had been carried on for\r\nyears, in which shameless publications were not only sold, but exposed\r\nin the windows; and why should he be considered a greater offender\r\nthan a shopkeeper, and be knocked about by the police? There are,\r\nor lately were, he said, such shops in the Strand, Fleet-street, a\r\ncourt off Ludgate-hill, Holborn, Drury-lane, Wych-street, the courts\r\nnear Drury-lane Theatre, Haymarket, High-street, Bloomsbury, St.\r\nMartin’s-court, May’s buildings, and elsewhere, to say nothing of\r\nHolywell-street! Yet _he_ must be interfered with!\r\n\r\n[I may here remark, that I met with no street-sellers who did not\r\ndisbelieve, or affect to disbelieve, that they were really meddled\r\nwith by the police for obstructing the thoroughfare. They either\r\nhint, or plainly state, that they are removed solely to please the\r\nshop-keepers. Such was the reiterated opinion, real or pretended, of my\r\npresent informant.]\r\n\r\nI took a statement from this man, but do not care to dwell upon the\r\nsubject. The trade, in the form I have described, had been carried\r\non, he thought, for the last six years. At one time, 20 men followed\r\nit; at present, he believed there were only 6, and they worked only\r\nat intervals, and as opportunities offered: some going out, for\r\ninstance, to sell almanacs or memorandum books, and, when they met with\r\na favourable chance, offering their sealed packets. My informant’s\r\ncustomers were principally boys, young men, and old gentlemen; but old\r\ngentlemen chiefly when the trade was new. This street-seller’s “great\r\ngun,” as he called it, was to make up packets, as closely resembling as\r\nhe could accomplish it, those which were displayed in the windows of\r\nany of the shops I have alluded to. He would then station himself at\r\nsome little distance from one of those shops, and, if possible, so as\r\nto encounter those who had stopped to study the contents of the window,\r\nand would represent--broadly enough, he admitted, when he dared--that\r\nhe could sell for 6_d._ what was charged 5_s._, or 2_s._ 6_d._, or\r\nwhatever price he had seen announced, “in that very neighbourhood.” He\r\nsometimes ventured, also, to mutter something, unintelligibly, about\r\nthe public being imposed upon! On one occasion, he took 6_s._ in the\r\nstreet in about two hours. On another evening he took 4_s._ 8_d._ in\r\nthe street and was called aside by two old gentlemen, each of whom\r\ntold him to come to an address given (at the West-end), and ask for\r\nsuch and such initials. To one he sold two packets for 2_s._; to the\r\nother, five packets, each 1_s._--or 11_s._ 8_d._ in one evening. The\r\npackets were in different coloured papers, and had the impressions of\r\na large seal on red wax at the back; and he assured the old gents., as\r\nhe called them, one of whom, he thought, was “silly,” that they were\r\nall different. “And very likely,” he said, chucklingly, “they were\r\ndifferent; for they were made out of a lot of missionary tracts and old\r\nnewspapers that I got dirt cheap at a ‘waste’ shop. I should like to\r\nhave seen the old gent.’s face, as he opened his 5_s._ worth, one after\r\nanother!” This trade, however, among old gentlemen, was prosperous for\r\nbarely a month: “It got blown then, sir, and they wouldn’t buy any\r\nmore, except a very odd one.”\r\n\r\nThis man--and he believed it was the same with all the others in the\r\ntrade--never visited the public-houses, for a packet would soon have\r\nbeen opened and torn there, which, he said, people was ashamed to do\r\nin the public streets. As well as he could recollect, he had never\r\nsold a single packet to a girl or a woman. Drunken women of the town\r\nhad occasionally made loud comments on his calling, and offered to\r\npurchase; but on such occasions, fearful of a disturbance, he always\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\nI have said that the straw trade is now confined to the country, and\r\nI give a specimen of the article vended there, by the patterer in the\r\nsham indecent trade. It was purchased of a man, who sold it folded in\r\nthe form of a letter, and is addressed, “On Royal Service. By Express.\r\nPrivate. To Her Royal Highness, Victoria, Princess Royal. Kensington\r\nPalace, London. Entered at Stationer’s Hall.” The man who sold it had\r\na wisp of straw round his neck, and introduced his wares with the\r\nfollowing patter:\r\n\r\n“I am well aware that many persons here present will say what an absurd\r\nidea--the idea of selling straws for a halfpenny each, when there are\r\nso many lying about the street; but the reason is simply this: I am not\r\nallowed by the authorities to sell these papers, so I give them away\r\nand sell my straws. There are a variety of figures in these papers for\r\ngentlemen; some in the bed, some on the bed, some under the bed.” The\r\nfollowing is a copy of the document thus sold:--\r\n\r\n  “Bachelors or Maidens, Husbands and Wives,\r\n  Will love each other and lead happy lives;\r\n  If both these Letters to read are inclined,\r\n  Secrets worth knowing therein they will find.\r\n\r\n  “Dated from the Duchy of Coburg.\r\n\r\n “MY DEAREST VICTORIA,\r\n\r\n ----never did I enjoy greater bliss, than when I sat down to the\r\n delightful task of writing a love letter to thy royal highness--my\r\n sweetest angel, oh! how I do adore thy lovely form, and long for\r\n the happy hour when I shall clasp thee in my arms--My bosom heaves,\r\n my heart pants, my senses wander, my hair stands on end, my head is\r\n on fire, my feet stumbles--yea, my arms and my legs refuse to do\r\n their office; every one of my members are tantalised with varied and\r\n conflicting emotions, and my whole body is being consumed in the\r\n furnase of everlasting love! Then hasten my glorious cherub--thou\r\n heavenly samaritan, pass not away from thy adoring albert; but come\r\n and pour thy healing balsam into my smarting wounds--Then will I\r\n pleasantly repose myself on my _now_ sleepless couch, and resining my\r\n soul to the enjoyment of that balmy sleep I have been long wanting,\r\n I shall be enchanted with the most beautiful visions of futurity,\r\n and continue to dream of love and thee! My amiable Victoria, the\r\n most pure and spotless of virgins, come to my longing arams--it is\r\n only thy dear Albert who like a bird of paradise, is calling thee to\r\n listen to his charming notes, and with fluttering wings wishes to\r\n bury himself within thy own downy plumage! Most amiable of England’s\r\n princesses--and the most virtuous of all heirs to a british diadem--I\r\n implore thee on ny bended knees, to favour my suit, above any other\r\n prince in christendom; and when thou hast deigned to exhalt me to\r\n that envied station of being thy husband, rest assured on my princely\r\n honour, that I will award to my royal bride and future sovereign,\r\n very many and living pledges of affection--anxiously awaiting your\r\n royal-Highnesses’ answer, I beg leave to subscribe myself\r\n\r\n  “Your adored Lover,\r\n\r\n  “ALBERT,\r\n\r\n  “PRINCE OF COBURG.”\r\n\r\nOn the back of this page is the following cool initiation of the\r\npurchaser into the mysteries of the epistle:\r\n\r\n “Directions for the purchasers to understand the _Royal Love Letters_,\r\n and showing them how to practise the art of Secret Letter Writing:--\r\n\r\n “Proceed to lay open ‘Albert’s Letter’ by the side of ‘Victoria’s,’\r\n and having done so, then look carefully down them until you have come\r\n to a word at the left hand corner, near the end of each Letter, having\r\n two marks thus -- --, when you must commence with that word, and read\r\n from left to right after you have turned them bottom upwards before a\r\n looking glass so that you may peruse the copy reflected therein. But\r\n you must notice, throughout all the words every other letter is upside\r\n down, also every other word single; but the next two words being\r\n purposely joined together, therefore they are double; and in addition\r\n to those letters placed upside down, makes it more mysterious in the\r\n reading. The reader is recommended to copy each word in writing,\r\n when he will be able to read the letters forward, and after a little\r\n practice he can soon learn to form all his words in the same curious\r\n manner, when he wants to write a ‘secret letter.’\r\n\r\n “Be sure when holding it up side down before a looking-glass, that the\r\n light of a candle, is placed between then by the reflection it will\r\n show much plainer, and be sooner discovered.\r\n\r\n “If you intend to practise a _Joke_ and make it answer the purpose\r\n of a Valentine, write what you think necessary on the adjoining\r\n _blank page_; then post it, with the superscription filled up in this\r\n manner:--After the word To, _write the name and address of the party_\r\n also place the word FROM _before_ ‘VICTORIA’S’ name: then the address\r\n on the outside of this letter will read somewhat after the following\r\n fashion:--To Mr. or Mrs. so and so, (with the number if any,) in such\r\n and such a street: at the same time your letter will appear as if it\r\n came from Royalty.\r\n\r\n “N.B. You must first buy both the letters, as the other letter is\r\n an answer to this one; and because, without the reader has got both\r\n letters, he will not have the secrets perfect.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the injunction to buy _both_ letters, and the seeming\r\nnecessity of having both to understand the “directions,” the patterer\r\nwas selling only the one I have given.\r\n\r\nThat the trade in sham indecent publications was, at one time, very\r\nconsiderable, and was not unobserved by those who watch, as it is\r\ncalled, “the signs of the times,” is shown by the circumstance that the\r\nAnti-Corn-Law League paper, called the _Bread Basket_, could only be\r\ngot off by being done up in a sealed packet, and sold by patterers as a\r\npretended improper work.\r\n\r\nThe really indecent trade will be described hereafter.\r\n\r\nFor a month my informant thought he had cleared 35_s._ a week; for\r\nanother month, 20_s._; and as an average, since that time, from\r\n5_s._ to 7_s._ 6_d._ weekly, until he discontinued the trade. It is\r\nvery seldom practised, unless in the evening, and perhaps only one\r\nstreet-seller depends entirely upon it.\r\n\r\nSupposing that 6 men last year each cleared 6_s._ weekly, we find\r\nupwards of 93_l._ expended yearly in the streets on this rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start in the business is 6_d._ or 1_s._, to be\r\nexpended in paper, paste, and sometimes sealing-wax.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF RELIGIOUS TRACT SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of religious tracts are now, I am informed, at the least,\r\nabout 50, but they were at one time, far more numerous. When penny\r\nbooks were few and very small, religious tracts were by far the\r\ncheapest things in print. It is common, moreover, for a religious\r\nsociety, or an individual, to give a poor person, children especially,\r\ntracts for sale. A great many tract sellers, from 25 to 35 years ago,\r\nwere, or pretended to be, maimed old soldiers or sailors. The traffic\r\nis now in the hands of what may be called an anomalous body of men.\r\nMore than one half of the tract sellers are foreigners, such as Malays,\r\nHindoos, and Negros. Of them, some cannot speak English, and some--who\r\nearn a spare subsistence by selling Christian tracts--are Mahometans,\r\nor worshippers of Bramah! The man whose portrait supplies the\r\ndaguerreotyped illustration of this number is unable to speak a word\r\nof English, and the absence of an interpreter, through some accident,\r\nprevented his statement being taken at the time appointed. I shall give\r\nit, however, with the necessary details on the subject, under another\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nWith some men and boys, I am informed, tract-selling is but a pretext\r\nfor begging.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A BENEFIT SOCIETY OF PATTERERS.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my inquiries, I received an account of an effort made\r\nby a body of these people to provide against sickness,--a step so\r\nclearly in the right direction, and perhaps so little to be expected\r\nfrom the habits of the class, that I feel bound to notice it. It was\r\ncalled the “Street-sellers’ Society;” but as nearly all the _bonâ-fide_\r\nmembers (or those who sought benefit from its funds) were patterers\r\nin paper, or ballad-singers, I can most appropriately notice their\r\nproceedings here.\r\n\r\nThe society “sprung up accidental,” as it was expressed to me. A\r\nfew paper-workers were conversing of the desirableness of such an\r\ninstitution, and one of the body suggested a benefit club, which it was\r\nat once determined to establish. It was accordingly established between\r\nsix and seven years ago, and was carried on for about four years. The\r\nmembers varied in number from 40 to 50; but of a proportion of 40, as\r\nmany as 18 might be tradesmen who were interested in the street-trade,\r\neither in supplying the articles in demand for it, or from keeping\r\npublic-houses resorted to by the fraternity, or any such motive, or who\r\nwere merely curious to mix in such society. Mr. C---- was conductor;\r\nMr. J. H---- (a poet, and the writer of “Black Bess,” “the Demon of the\r\nSea,” and other things which “took” in the streets), secretary; and a\r\nwell-known patterer was under-conductor, with which office was mixed\r\nup the rather onerous duties of a kind of master of the ceremonies on\r\nmeeting-nights. None of the officers were paid.\r\n\r\nThe subscription was 2_d._ a week, and meetings of the members\r\nwere held once a week. Each member, not an officer, paid 1/2_d._\r\nfor admission to the fund, and could introduce a visitor, who also\r\npaid 1/2_d._ No charge was made for the use of the club-room (in a\r\npublic-house), which was entirely in the control of the members. Every\r\none using bad language, or behaving improperly, was fined 1/2_d._, and\r\non a second offence was ejected, and sometimes, if the misbehaviour\r\nwas gross, on the first. Any one called upon to sing, and refusing,\r\nor being unable, was fined 1/2_d._, and was liable to be called upon\r\nagain, and pay another fine. A visitor sometimes, instead of 1/2_d._,\r\noffered 6_d._ when fined; but this was not accepted,--only 1/2_d._\r\ncould be received. The members’ wives could and did often accompany\r\ntheir husbands to the meetings; but women of the town, whether\r\nintroduced by members or not, were not permitted to remain. “They found\r\ntheir way in a few times,” said the man who was under-conductor to\r\nme, “but I managed to work them out without any bother, and without\r\ninsulting them--God forbid!”\r\n\r\nThe assistance given was 5_s._ weekly to sick members, who were not in\r\narrear in their subscriptions. If the man had a family to support, a\r\ngathering was made for him, in addition to his weekly allowance,--for\r\nthe members were averse to “distress the box” (fund). There was no\r\nallowance for the burial of a member, but a gathering took place,\r\nand perhaps a raffle, to raise funds for a wake (sometimes) and an\r\ninterment; and during the existence of the society, three members,\r\nI was told, were buried that way “comfortably.” The subscriptions\r\nwere paid up regularly enough; “indeed,” said a member to me, “if a\r\nman earned anything, his mates knew of it: we all know how the cat\r\njumps that way, so he must either pay or be scratched.” The members\r\nnot unfrequently lent each other money to pay up their subscriptions.\r\nFashionable young “swells,” I was told, often visited the house,\r\nand stayed till 3 or 4 in the morning, but were very seldom in the\r\nclub-room, which was closed regularly at 12. After that hour, the\r\n“swells” who were bent upon seeing life--(and they are a class whom the\r\npatterers, on all such occasions, not so very unreasonably consider\r\n“fair game” for bamboozling)--could enjoy the society congenial to\r\ntheir tastes or gratifying to their curiosity. On one occasion two\r\npolicemen were among the visitors, and were on friendly terms enough\r\nwith the members, some of whom they had seen before.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning there seems to have been a distrust of one another\r\namong the members, but a distrust not invincible or the club would\r\nnever have been formed. Instead of the “box,” or fund (the money\r\nbeing deposited in a box), being allowed to accumulate, so that an\r\ninvestment might be realised, available for any emergency, the fund was\r\ndivided among the members quarterly, and then the subscription went\r\non anew. The payments, however, fell off. The calling of the members\r\nwas precarious, their absence in the country was frequent, and so the\r\nsociety ceased to exist, but the members were satisfied that every\r\nthing was done honourably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HINDOO TRACT-SELLER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe purpose to which the funds, on a quarterly division, were devoted,\r\nwas one not confined to such men as the patterers--to a supper. “None\r\nof your light suppers, sir,” said a member; “not by no means. And we\r\nwere too fly to send anybody to market but ourselves. We used to go to\r\nLeadenhall, and buy a cut off a sirloin, which was roasted prime,\r\nand smelt like a angel. But not so often, for its a dear jint, the\r\nbones is heavy. One of the favouritest jints was a boiled leg of mutton\r\nwith caper trimmings. That _is_ a good supper,--I believe you, my hero.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ABODES, TRICKS, MARRIAGE, CHARACTER, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE\r\nDIFFERENT GRADES OF PATTERERS.\r\n\r\nHaving now giving an account of those who may be called the literary\r\npatterers (proper), or at any rate of those who do not deem it vain so\r\nto account themselves, because they “work paper,” I proceed to adduce\r\nan account of the different grades of patterers generally, for patter\r\nhas almost as many divisions as literature. There is patter pathetic,\r\nas from beggars; bouncing, to puff off anything of little or no value;\r\ncomic, as by the clowns; descriptive, as in the cases where the\r\nvendor describes, however ornately, what he really sells; religious,\r\nas occasionally by the vendors of tracts; _real patter_ (as it is\r\nunderstood by the profession) to make a thing believed to be what it is\r\nnot; classical, as in the case of the sale of stenographic cards, &c.;\r\nand sporting, as in race cards.\r\n\r\nThe pattering tribe is by no means confined to the traffic in paper,\r\nthough it may be the principal calling as regards the acuteness\r\nof its professors. Among these street-folk are the running and\r\nstanding patterers (or stationers as they are sometimes, but rarely,\r\nstyled)--and in these are included, the Death and Fire Hunters of\r\nwhom I have spoken; Chaunters; Second Edition-sellers; Reciters;\r\nConundrum-sellers; Board-workers; Strawers; Sellers of (Sham)\r\nIndecent Publications; Street Auctioneers; Cheap Jacks; Mountebanks\r\n(quacks); Clowns; the various classes of Showmen; Jugglers;\r\nConjurors; Ring-sellers for wagers; Sovereign-sellers; Corn-curers;\r\nGrease-removers; French-polishers; Blacking-sellers; Nostrum-vendors;\r\nFortune-tellers; Oratorical-beggars; Turnpike-sailors; the classes of\r\nLurkers; Stenographic Card-sellers, and the Vendors of Race-cards or\r\nlists.\r\n\r\nThe following accounts have been written for me by the same gentleman\r\nwho has already described the Religion, Morals, &c., of patterers.\r\nHe has for some years resided among the class, and has pursued a\r\nstreet calling for his existence. What I have already said of his\r\nopportunities of personal observation and of dispassionate judgment I\r\nneed not iterate.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” says the writer in question, “in the disclosures I am now\r\nabout to make concerning the patterers generally, to _do more_ than\r\nmerely put the public on their guard. I take no cruel delight in\r\ndragging forth the follies of my fellow-men. Before I have done with my\r\nsubject, I hope to draw forth and exhibit some of the latent virtues of\r\nthe class under notice, many of whom I know to sigh in secret over that\r\n_one_ imprudent step (whatever its description), which has furnished\r\nthe censorious with a weapon they have been but too ready to wield.\r\nThe first thing for me to do is to give a glance at the _habitations_\r\nof these outcasts, and to set forth their usual conduct, opinions,\r\nconversation and amusements. As London (including the ten mile circle),\r\nis the head quarters of lodging-house life, and least known, because\r\nmost crowded, I shall lift the veil which shrouds the vagrant hovel\r\nwhere the patterer usually resides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“As there are many individuals in lodging-houses who are not regular\r\npatterers or professional vagrants, being rather, as they term\r\nthemselves, ‘travellers’ (or tramps), so there are multitudes who\r\ndo _not_ inhabit such houses who really belong to the fraternity,\r\npattering, or vagrant. Of these some take up their abode in what\r\nthey call ‘flatty-kens,’ that is, houses the landlord of which is\r\nnot ‘awake’ or ‘fly’ to the ‘moves’ and dodges of the trade; others\r\nresort to the regular ‘padding-kens,’ or houses of call for vagabonds;\r\nwhile others--and especially those who have families--live constantly\r\nin furnished rooms, and have little intercourse with the ‘regular’\r\ntravellers, tramps, or wanderers.\r\n\r\n“The medium houses the London vagrant haunts, (for I have no wish to go\r\nto extremes either way,) are probably in Westminster, and perhaps the\r\nfairest ‘model’ of the ‘_monkry_’ is the house in Orchard-street--once\r\nthe residence of royalty--which has been kept and conducted for half a\r\ncentury by the veteran who some fifty years ago was the _only_ man who\r\namused the population with that well-known ditty,\r\n\r\n  ‘If I’d as much money as I could tell,\r\n  I would not cry young lambs to sell.’\r\n\r\n_Mister_ (for that is the old man’s title) still manufactures lambs,\r\nbut seldom goes out himself; his sons (obedient and exemplary young\r\nmen) take the toys into the country, and dispose of them at fairs and\r\nmarkets. The wife of this man is a woman of some beauty and good sound\r\nsense, but far too credulous for the position of which she is the\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n“So much for the establishment. I have now to deal with the inmates.\r\n\r\n“No one could be long an inmate of Mr. ----’s without discerning in the\r\nmotley group persons who had seen better days, and, seated on the same\r\nbench, persons who are ‘seeing’ the best days they _ever_ saw. When I\r\ntook up my abode in the house under consideration, I was struck by the\r\nappearance of a middle-aged lady-like woman, a native of Worcester,\r\nbred to the glove trade, and brought up in the lap of plenty, and under\r\nthe high sanction of religious principle. She had evidently some source\r\nof mental anguish. I believe it was the conduct of her husband, by whom\r\nshe had been deserted, and who was living with a woman to whom, it is\r\nsaid, the wife had shown much kindness. By her sat a giant in size, and\r\ncandour demands that I should say a ‘giant in sin.’ When Navy Jem,\r\nas he is called, used to _work_ for his living (it was a long while\r\nago) he drove a barrow at the formation of the Great Western Railway.\r\nAt present the man lies in bed till mid-day, and when he makes his\r\nappearance in the kitchen,\r\n\r\n  ‘The very kittens on the hearth\r\n    They dare not even play.’\r\n\r\nHis breakfast embraces all the good things of the season. He divides\r\nhis delicacies with a silver fork--where did he get it? The mode in\r\nwhich this man obtains a livelihood is at once a mixture and a mystery.\r\nHis prevailing plan is to waylay gentlemen in the decline of life, and\r\nto extort money by threats of accusation and exposure, to which I can\r\ndo no more than allude. His wife, a notorious shoplifter, is now for\r\nthe third time ‘expiating her offences’ in Coldbath-fields.\r\n\r\n“Next to Navy Jem may be perceived a little stunted woman, of pretended\r\nScotch, but really Irish extraction, whose husband has died in the\r\nhospital for consumption at least as many times as the hero of Waterloo\r\nhas seen engagements. At last the man _did_ die, and his widow has been\r\ncollecting money to bury him for eight years past, but has not yet\r\nsecured the required sum. This woman, whose name I never knew, has a\r\nboy and a girl; to the former she is very kind, the latter she beats\r\nwithout mercy, always before breakfast, and with such (almost) unvaried\r\npunctuality that her brother will sometimes whisper (after saying\r\ngrace), ‘Mother, has our Poll had her licks yet?’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Among the records of mortality lately before the public, is the\r\naccount of a notorious woman, who was found suffocated in a stagnant\r\npool, whether from suicide or accident it was impossible to determine.\r\nShe had been in every hospital in town and country, suffering from a\r\ndisease, entirely self-procured. She applied strong acids to wounds\r\npreviously punctured with a pin, and so caused her body to present one\r\nmass of sores. She was deemed incurable by the hospital doctors, and\r\nliberal collections were made for her among the benevolent in various\r\nplaces. The trick, however, was ultimately discovered, and the failure\r\nof her plan (added to the bad state of health to which her bodily\r\ninjuries had gradually led) preyed upon her mind and hastened her death.\r\n\r\n“This woman had been the paramour of ‘Peter the crossing-sweeper,’ a\r\nman who for years went about showing similar wounds, which he pretended\r\nhad been inflicted while fighting in the Spanish Legion--though,\r\ntruth to say, he had never been nearer Spain than Liverpool is to New\r\nYork. He had followed the ‘monkry’ from a child, and chiefly, since\r\nmanhood, as a ‘broken-down weaver from Leicester,’ and after singing\r\nthrough every one of the provinces ‘We’ve got no work to do,’ he\r\nscraped acquaintance with a ‘school of shallow coves;’ that is, men\r\nwho go about half-naked, telling frightful tales about shipwrecks,\r\nhair-breadth escapes from houses on fire, and such like aqueous and\r\nigneous calamities. By these Peter was initiated into the ‘_scaldrum\r\ndodge_,’ or the art of burning the body with a mixture of acids and\r\ngunpowder, so as to suit the hues and complexions of the accident to\r\nbe deplored. Such persons hold every morning a ‘committee of ways\r\nand means,’ according to whose decision the movements of the day are\r\ncarried out. Sometimes when on their country rounds, they go singly up\r\nto the houses of the gentry and wealthy farmers, begging shirts, which\r\nthey hide in hedges while they go to another house and beg a similar\r\narticle. Sometimes they go in crowds, to the number of from twelve\r\nto twenty; they are most successful when the ‘swell’ is not at home;\r\nif they can meet with the ‘Burerk’ (Mistress), or the young ladies,\r\nthey ‘put it on them for dunnage’ (beg a stock of general clothing),\r\nflattering their victims first and frightening them afterwards. A\r\nfriend of mine was present in a lodging-house in Plymouth, when a\r\nschool of the shallow coves returned from their day’s work with _six\r\nsuits of clothes, and twenty-seven shirts, besides children’s apparel\r\nand shoes_, (all of which were sold to a broker in the same street),\r\nand, besides these, the donations in money received amounted to 4_s._\r\n4_d._ a man.\r\n\r\n“At this enterprise ‘Peter’ continued several years, but--to use his\r\nown words--‘everything has but a time,’ the country got ‘dead’ to\r\nhim, and people got ‘fly’ to the ‘shallow brigade;’ so Peter came up\r\nto London to ‘try his hand at something else.’ Housed in the domicile\r\nof ‘Sayer the barber,’ who has enriched himself by beer-shops and\r\nlodging-house-keeping, to the tune it is said of 20,000_l._, Peter\r\namused the ‘travellers’ of Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, with recitals\r\nof what he had seen and done. Here a profligate, but rather intelligent\r\nman, who had really been in the service of the Queen of Spain, gave\r\nhim an old red jacket, and with it such instructions as equipped him\r\nfor the imposition. One sleeve of this jacket usually hung loosely\r\nby his side, while the arm it should have covered was exposed naked,\r\nand to all appearance withered. His rule was to keep silence till a\r\ncrowd assembled around him, when he began to ‘_patter_’ to them to the\r\nfollowing effect: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, it is with feelings of no\r\ncommon reluctance that I stand before you at this time; but although I\r\nam not without _feelings_, I am totally without friends, and frequently\r\nwithout food. This wound (showing his disfigured arm) I received in the\r\nservice of the Queen of Spain, and I have many more on different parts\r\nof my person. I received a little praise for my brave conduct, but not\r\na penny of pension, and here I am (there’s no deception you see) ill in\r\nhealth--poor in pocket, and exposed without proper nourishment to wind\r\nand weather--the cold is blowing through me till I am almost perished.’\r\nHis ‘_Doxy_’ stood by and received the ‘voluntary contributions’\r\nof the audience in a soldier’s cap, which our hero emptied into his\r\npocket, and after snivelling out his thanks, departed to renew the\r\nexhibition in the nearest available thoroughfare. Peter boasted that\r\nhe could make on an average fifteen of these pitches a day, and as the\r\nproceeds were estimated at something considerable in each pitch (he has\r\nbeen known to take as much as half-a-crown in pence at one standing),\r\nhe was able to sport his figure at Astley’s in the evening--to eat\r\n‘spring lamb,’ and when reeling home under the influence of whiskey, to\r\nentertain the peaceful inhabitants with the music of--‘We won’t go home\r\ntill morning----’\r\n\r\n“Whether the _game_ got _stale_, or Peter became honest, is beyond the\r\npurport of my communication to settle. If any reader, however, should\r\nmake his purchases at the puffing fishmonger’s in Lombard-street, they\r\nmay find Peter now pursuing the more honest occupation of sweeping the\r\ncrossing, by the church of St. Gabriel, Fenchurch-street.\r\n\r\n“Among the most famous of the ‘lurking patterers’ was ‘Captain Moody,’\r\nthe son of poor but honest parents in the county of Cornwall, who\r\ndied during his boyhood, leaving him to the custody of a maiden aunt.\r\nThis lady soon, and not without reason, got tired of her incorrigible\r\ncharge. Young Moody was apprenticed successively to three trades,\r\nand wanted not ability to become expert in any of them, but having\r\noccasional interviews with some of the gipsey tribe, and hearing from\r\nthemselves of their wonderful achievements, he left the sober walks of\r\nlife and joined this vagrant fraternity.\r\n\r\n“His new position, however, was attractive only while it was novel.\r\nMoody, who had received a fair education, soon became disgusted with\r\nthe coarseness and vulgarity of his associates. At the solicitation\r\nof a neighbouring clergyman, he was restored to the friendship of his\r\naunt, who had soon sad reason to regret that her compassion had got the\r\nbetter of her prudence; for one Sunday afternoon, while she was absent\r\nat church, young Moody who had pleaded indisposition and so obtained\r\npermission to stay at home, decamped (after dispatching the servant\r\nto the town, a mile distant, to fetch the doctor) in the meantime,\r\nemptying his aunt’s ‘safety cupboard’ of a couple of gold watches and\r\n£72 in cash and country notes.\r\n\r\n“His roving disposition then induced him to try the sea, and the\r\nknowledge he obtained during several voyages fitted him for those\r\nmaritime frauds which got him the name of ‘Captain Moody, the lurker.’\r\nThe frauds of this person are well known, and often recounted with\r\ngreat admiration among the pattering fraternity. On one occasion,\r\nthe principal butcher in Gosport was summoned to meet a gentlemen at\r\nan hotel. The _Louisa_, a brig, had just arrived at Portsmouth, the\r\ncaptain’s name was Young, and this gentleman Moody personated for\r\nthe time being. ‘I have occasion,’ said he to the butcher, ‘for an\r\nadditional supply of beef for the _Louisa_; I have heard you spoken\r\nof by Captain Harrison’ (whom Moody knew to be an old friend of\r\nthe butcher’s), ‘and I have thus given you the preference. I want\r\na bullock, cut up in 12lb. pieces; it must be on board by three\r\nto-morrow.’ The price was agreed upon, and the captain threw down a\r\nfew sovereigns in payment, but, of course, discovered that he had not\r\ngold enough to cover the whole amount, so he proposed to give him a\r\ncheque he had just received from Captain Harrison for £100, and the\r\nbutcher could give him the difference. The tradesman was nothing loth,\r\nfor a cheque upon ‘Vallance, Mills, and West,’ with Captain Harrison’s\r\nsignature, was reckoned equal to money any day, and so the butcher\r\nconsidered the one he had received, until the next morning, when the\r\ndraft and the order proved to be forgeries. The culprit was, of course,\r\nnowhere to be found, nor, indeed, heard of till two years after, when\r\nhe had removed the scene of his depredations to Liverpool.\r\n\r\n“In that port he had a colleague, a man whose manners and appearance\r\nwere equally prepossessing. Moody sent his ‘pal’ into a jeweller’s\r\nshop, near the corner of Lord-street, who there purchased a small gold\r\nseal, paid for it, and took his leave. Immediately afterwards, Moody\r\nentered the shop under evident excitement, declaring that he had seen\r\nthe person, who had just left the shop secrete two, if not three, seals\r\nup his coat-sleeve; adding, that the fellow had just gone through the\r\nExchange, and that if the jeweller were quick he would be sure to catch\r\nhim. The jeweller ran out without his hat, leaving his kind friend in\r\ncharge of the shop, and soon returned with the supposed criminal in his\r\ncustody. The ‘captain,’ however, in the mean time, had decamped, taking\r\nwith him a tray from the window, containing precious materials to the\r\nvalue of 300_l._\r\n\r\n“At another time, the ‘captain’ prepared a document, setting forth\r\n‘losses in the Baltic trade,’ and a dismal variety of disasters; and\r\nconcluding with a melancholy shipwreck, which had really taken place\r\njust about that time in the German Ocean. With this he travelled\r\nover great part of Scotland, and with almost unprecedented success.\r\nJourneying near the Frith of Forth, he paid a visit to Lord Dalmeny--a\r\nnobleman of great benevolence--who had read the account of the\r\nshipwreck in the local journals, and wondered that the petition was not\r\nsigned by influential persons _on the spot_; and, somewhat suspicious\r\nof the reality of the ‘captain’s’ identity, placed a terrestrial globe\r\nbefore him, and begged to be shown ‘in what latitude he was cast\r\naway.’ The awkwardness with which Moody handled the globe showed that\r\n_he_ was ‘out of _his_ latitude’ altogether. His lordship thereupon\r\ncommitted the document to the flames, but generously gave the ‘captain’\r\na sovereign and some good advice; the former he appropriated at the\r\nnearest public-house, of the latter he never made the least use.\r\n\r\n“Old, and worn out by excesses and imprisonment, he subsists now by\r\n‘sitting pad’ about the suburban pavements; and when, on a recent\r\nevening, he was recognised in a low public-house in Deptford, he was\r\nheard to say, with a sigh: ‘Ah! once I could “screeve a fakement”\r\n(write a petition) or “cooper a monekur” (forge a signature) with any\r\nman alive, and my heart’s game now; but I’m old and asthmatic, and got\r\nthe rheumatis, so that I ain’t worth a d--n.’\r\n\r\n“‘The Lady Lurker.’--Of this person very little is known, and _that_\r\nlittle, it is said, makes her an object of pity. Her father was a\r\ndissenting minister in Bedfordshire. She has been twice married; her\r\nfirst husband was a schoolmaster at Hackney, and nephew of a famous\r\ndivine who wrote a Commentary on the Bible, and was chaplain to\r\nGeorge III. She afterwards married a physician in Cambridgeshire (a\r\nDr. S----), who is alleged to have treated her ill, and even to have\r\nattempted to poison her. She has no children; and, since the death\r\nof her husband, has passed through various grades, till she is now a\r\ncadger. She dresses becomingly in black, and sends in her card (Mrs.\r\nDr. S----) to the houses whose occupants are known, or supposed, to\r\nbe charitable. She talks with them for a certain time, and then draws\r\nforth a few boxes of lucifers, which, she says, she is compelled to\r\nsell for her living. These lucifers are merely excuses, of course,\r\nfor begging; still, nothing is known to have ever transpired in her\r\nbehaviour wholly unworthy of a distressed gentlewoman. She lives in\r\nprivate lodgings.”\r\n\r\nI continue the account of these habitations, and of their wretched\r\noccupants, from the pen of the same gentleman whose vicissitudes\r\n(partly self-procured) led him to several years’ acquaintance with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“Padding-kens” (lodging-houses) in the country are certainly preferable\r\nabodes to those of St. Giles’s, Westminster, or Whitechapel; but in\r\ncountry as in town, their condition is extremely filthy and disgusting;\r\nmany of them are scarcely ever washed, and as to sweeping, once a week\r\nis miraculous. In most cases they swarm with vermin, and, except where\r\ntheir position is very airy, the ventilation is imperfect, and frequent\r\nsickness the necessary result. It is a matter of surprise that the\r\nnobility, clergy, and gentry of the realm should permit the existence\r\nof such horrid dwellings.\r\n\r\n“I think,” continues my informant, “that the majority of these\r\npoor wretches are without even the idea of respectability or ‘home\r\ncomforts,’--many of them must be ranked among the worst of our\r\npopulation. Some, who could live elsewhere, prefer these wretched\r\nabodes, because they answer various evil purposes. With beggars,\r\npatterers, hawkers, tramps, and vendors of their own manufacture, are\r\nmingled thieves, women of easy virtue, and men of no virtue at all; a\r\nfew, and by far the smallest portion, are persons who once filled posts\r\nof credit and affluence, but whom bankruptcy, want of employment, or\r\nsickness has driven to these dismal retreats. The vast majority of\r\nLondon vagrants take their summer vacation in the country, and the\r\n‘dodges’ of both are interchanged, and every new ‘move’ circulates in\r\nalmost no time.\r\n\r\n“I will endeavour to sketch a few of the most renowned ‘performers’\r\non this theatre of action. By far the most illustrious is ‘Nicholas\r\nA----,’ an ame known to the whole cadging fraternity as a _real_\r\ndescendant from Bamfylde Moore Carew, and the ‘prince of lurkers’ and\r\npatterers for thirty years past. This man owes much of his success to\r\nhis confessedly imposing appearance, and many of his escapes to the\r\nknown respectability of his connections. His father--yet alive--is\r\na retired captain in the Royal Navy, a gentleman of good private\r\nproperty, and one of her Majesty’s justices of peace for the county of\r\nDevon--the southern extremity of which was the birth-place of Nicholas.\r\nBut little is known of his early days. He went to school at Tavistock,\r\nwhere he received a good education, and began life by cheating his\r\nschoolfellows.\r\n\r\n“The foolish fondness of an indulgent mother, and some want of firmness\r\nin paternal discipline, accelerated the growth of every weed of infamy\r\nin Nicholas, and baffled every experiment, by sea and land, to ‘set’\r\nhim up in life.\r\n\r\n“Scarcely was he out of his teens, when he honoured the sister\r\ncountry with his visits and his depredations. About the centre of\r\nSackville-street, Dublin, there lived a wealthy silversmith of the name\r\nof Wise. Into his shop (accompanied by one of his _pals_ in livery)\r\nwent Nicholas, whose gentlemanly exterior, as I have already hinted,\r\nwould disarm suspicion in a stranger.\r\n\r\n“‘Good morning sir, is your name Wise?--Yes, sir.--Well, that is\r\n_my_ name.--Indeed, of the English family, I suppose?--Yes, sir,\r\nEast Kent.--Oh, indeed! related to the ladies of Leeds Castle, I\r\npresume?--I have the honour to be their brother.--James, is your name\r\nJames or John?--Neither, sir, it is Jacob.--Oh, indeed! a very ancient\r\nname.--Well, I have occasion to give a party at the Corn Exchange\r\nTavern, and I want a little plate on hire, can you supply me?’--A very\r\npolite affirmative settled this part of the business. Plate to the\r\namount of 150_l._ was selected and arranged, when Nicholas discovered\r\nthat his pocket-book was at home (to complete the deception, his right\r\narm was in a sling). ‘Will you, Mr. Wise (you see my infirmity), write\r\nme a few lines?--With the greatest pleasure,’ was the silversmith’s\r\nreply.--‘Well, let me see. “_My dear, do not be surprised at this; I\r\nwant 150l., or all the money you can send, per bearer; I will explain\r\nat dinner-time._\r\n\r\n  J. WISE.”\r\n\r\n“‘Now, John, take this to your mistress, and be quick.’ As John was\r\nnot very hasty in his return, Nicholas went to look for him, leaving a\r\nstrict injunction that the plate should be sent to the Corn Exchange\r\nTavern, as soon as the deposit was received. This happened at eleven\r\nin the forenoon--the clock struck five and no return of either the\r\nmaster or the man.\r\n\r\n“The jeweller left a message with his apprentice, and went home to\r\nhis dinner. He was met at the door of his suburban villa by his\r\n‘better half,’ who wondered what made him so late, and wished to know\r\nthe nature of the exigency which had caused him to send home for so\r\nmuch money? The good man’s perplexity was at an end when he saw his\r\nown handwriting on the note; and every means within the range of\r\nconstabulary vigilance was taken to capture the offender, but Nicholas\r\nand his servant got clear off.\r\n\r\n“This man’s ingenuity was then taxed as to the next move, so he\r\nthought it expedient to _tax_ somebody else. He went with his\r\n‘pal’ to a miscellaneous repository, where they bought a couple of\r\nold ledgers--useful only as waste paper, a bag to hold money, two\r\nink-bottles, &c. Thus equipped, they waited on the farmers of the\r\ndistrict, and exhibited a ‘fakement,’ setting forth parliamentary\r\nauthority for imposing a tax upon the geese! They succeeded to\r\nadmiration, and weeks elapsed before the hoax was discovered. The\r\ncoolness of thus assuming legislatorial functions, and being, at the\r\nsame time, the executive power, has rarely been equalled.\r\n\r\n“There is an old proverb, that ‘It is an ill wind that blows _nobody_\r\ngood.’ The gallant ‘captain’ was domiciled at a lodging-house in\r\nGainsborough, Lincolnshire, where he found all the lodgers complaining\r\nof the badness of the times--most of them were makers of nets. He\r\nsallied forth to all the general shops, and left his (fictitious)\r\n‘captain’ card at each, with an order for an unusual number of nets.\r\nThis ‘dodge’ gave a week’s work to at least twenty poor people; but\r\nwhether the shopkeepers were ‘caught in a net,’ or the articles were\r\npaid for and removed by the ‘captain,’ or whether it was a piece of\r\npastime on his part, I did not stay long enough to ascertain.\r\n\r\n“Nicholas A---- is now in his sixty-second year, a perfect\r\nhypochondriac. On his own authority--and it is, no doubt, too true--he\r\nhas been ‘lurking’ on every conceivable system, from forging a bill of\r\nexchange down to ‘_maundering on the fly_,’ for the greater part of his\r\nlife; and, excepting the ‘hundred and thirteen times’ he has been in\r\nprovincial jails, society has endured the scourge of his deceptions for\r\na quarter of a century at least. He now lives with a young prostitute\r\nin Portsmouth, and contributes to her wretched earnings an allowance of\r\n5_s._ a week, paid to him by the attorney of a distant and disgusted\r\nrelative.”\r\n\r\nThe writer of this account was himself two whole years on the “monkry,”\r\nbefore he saw a lodging-house for tramps; and the first he _ever_ saw\r\nwas one well-known to every patterer in Christendom, and whose fame he\r\nsays is “gone out into all lands,” for its wayfaring inmates are very\r\nproud of its popularity.\r\n\r\n“It may be as well,” writes the informant in question, “before\r\nsubmitting the following account, to state that there are other, and\r\nmore elaborate marks--the hieroglyphics of tramping--than those already\r\ngiven. I will accordingly explain them.\r\n\r\n“Two hawkers (pals) go together, but separate when they enter a\r\nvillage, one taking each side of the road, and selling different\r\nthings; and, so as to inform each other as to the character of the\r\npeople at whose houses they call, they chalk certain marks on their\r\ndoor-posts:\r\n\r\n“[arch and dash] means ‘Go on. _I_ have called here; don’t\r\n_you_ call--it’s no go.’\r\n\r\n“[arch and plus sign] means ‘Stop--you may call here; they want’\r\n(for instance) ‘what _you_ sell, though not what _I_ sell;’ or\r\nelse, ‘They had no change when I was there, but may have it now;’ or,\r\n‘If they don’t buy, at least they’ll treat you civilly.’\r\n\r\n“[backward C and dash] on a corner-house, or a sign-post,\r\nmeans, ‘I went this way;’ or ‘Go on in this direction.’\r\n\r\n“[backward C and plus] on a corner-house, or sign-post,\r\nmeans ‘Stop--don’t go any further in this direction.’\r\n\r\n“[circle with dot] as before explained, means ‘danger.’\r\n\r\n“Like many other young men, I had lived above my income, and, too\r\nproud to crave parental forgiveness, had thrown off the bonds of\r\nauthority for a life of adventure. I was now homeless upon the world.\r\nWith a body capable of either exertion or fatigue, and a heart not\r\neasily terrified by danger, I endured rather than enjoyed my itinerant\r\nposition. I sold small articles of Tunbridge ware, perfumery, &c.,\r\n&c., and by ‘munging’ (begging) over them--sometimes in Latin--got a\r\nbetter living than I expected, or probably deserved. I was always of\r\ntemperate and rather abstemious habits, but ignorant of the haunts\r\nof other wanderers, (whom I saw in dozens every day upon every road,\r\nand every conceivable pursuit) I took up my nightly quarters at a\r\nsort of third-rate public-houses, and supposed that my contemporaries\r\ndid the same. How long my ignorance might have continued (if left\r\nto myself) I can hardly determine; an adventure at a road-side inn,\r\nhowever, removed the veil from my eyes, and I became gradually and\r\nspeedily ‘awake’ to ‘every move on the board.’ It was a lovely evening\r\nin July, the air was serene and the scenery romantic; my own feelings\r\nwere in unison with both, and enhanced perhaps by the fact that I had\r\nbeguiled the last two miles of my deliberate walk with a page out of\r\nmy pocket-companion, ‘Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful.’ I was now\r\nsmoking my pipe and quaffing a pint of _real_ ‘Yorkshire stingo’ in\r\nthe ‘keeping room’ (a term which combines parlour and kitchen in one\r\nword) of a _real_ ‘Yorkshire village,’ Dranfield, near Sheffield. A\r\nyoung person of the other sex was my only and accidental companion; she\r\nhad been driven into the house by the over-officiousness of a vigilant\r\nvillage constable, who finding that she sold lace without a license,\r\nand--infinitely worse--refused to listen to his advances, had warned\r\nher to ‘make herself scarce’ at her ‘earliest possible convenience.’\r\n\r\n“Having elicited what I did for a living, she popped the startling\r\nquestion to me, ‘Where do you “hang out” in Sheffield?’ I told her that\r\nI had never been in Sheffield, and did not ‘hang out’ my little wares,\r\nbut used my persuasive art to induce the purchase of them. The lady\r\nsaid, ‘Well, you are “green.” I mean, where do you _dos_?’ This was no\r\nbetter, it seemed something like Greek,--‘_delta, omicron, sigma_,’\r\n(I retain the “patterer’s” own words to show the education of the\r\nclass)--but the etymology was no relief to the perplexity. ‘Where do\r\nyou mean to sleep?’ she inquired. I referred to my usual practice of\r\nadjourning to an humble public-house. My companion at once threw off\r\nall manner of disguise, and said, ‘Well, sir, you are a young man that\r\nI have taken a liking to, and if you think you should like my company,\r\nI will take you to a lodging where there is plenty of travellers, and\r\nyou will see “all sorts of life.”’ I liked the girl’s company, and our\r\nmutual acquiescence made us companions on the road. We had not got far\r\nbefore we met the aforesaid constable in company with an unmistakeable\r\nmember of the Rural Police. They made some inquiries of me, which I\r\nthought exceeded their commission. I replied to them with a mutilated\r\nOde of Horace, when they both determined that I was a Frenchman, and\r\nallowed us to ‘go on our way rejoicing.’\r\n\r\n“The smoky, though well-built, town of Sheffield was now near at hand.\r\nThe daylight was past, and the ‘shades of the evening were stretching\r\nout;’ we were therefore enabled to journey through the thoroughfares\r\nwithout impertinent remarks, or perhaps any observation, except from\r\na toothless old woman, of John Wesley’s school, who was ‘sorry to see\r\ntwo such nice young people going about the country,’ and wondered if we\r\n‘ever thought of eternity!’\r\n\r\n“After a somewhat tedious ramble, we arrived at Water-lane;--at the\r\n‘Bug-trap,’ which from time immemorial has been the name of the most\r\nrenowned lodging-house in that or perhaps any locality. Water-lane is\r\na dark narrow street, crowded with human beings of the most degraded\r\nsort--the chosen atmosphere of cholera, and the stronghold of theft\r\nand prostitution. In less than half an hour, my fair companion and\r\nmyself were sipping our tea, and eating Yorkshire cake in this same\r\nlodging-house.\r\n\r\n“‘God bless every happy couple!’ was echoed from a rude stentorian\r\nvoice, while a still ruder hand bumped down upon our tea-table a red\r\nearthen dish of no small dimensions, into which was poured, from the\r\nmouth of a capacious bag, fragments of fish, flesh, and fowl, viands\r\nand vegetables of every sort, intermingled with bits of cheese and\r\ndollops of Yorkshire pudding. The man to whom this heterogeneous mass\r\nbelonged, appeared anything but satisfied with his lot. ‘Well,’ said\r\nhe, ‘I don’t know what this ’ere monkry _will_ come to, after a bit.\r\nThree bob and a tanner, and that there dish o’ scran’ (enough to feed\r\ntwo families for a fortnight) ‘is all I got this blessed day since\r\nseven o’clock in the morning, and now it’s nine at night.’ I ventured\r\nto say something, but a remark, too base for repetition, ‘put the\r\nstunners on me,’ and I held my peace.\r\n\r\n“I was here surprised, on conversing with my young female companion,\r\nto find that she went to church, said her prayers night and morning,\r\nand knew many of the collects, some of which she repeated, besides a\r\npleasing variety of Dr. Watts’s hymns. At the death of her mother, her\r\nfather had given up housekeeping; and, being too fond of a wandering\r\nlife, had led his only child into habits like his own.\r\n\r\n“As the night advanced, the party at the ‘Bug-trap’ more than doubled.\r\nHigh-flyers, shallow-coves, turnpike-sailors, and swells out of luck,\r\nmade up an assembly of fourscore human beings, more than half of whom\r\nwere doomed to sleep on a ‘make-shift’--in other words, on a platform,\r\nraised just ten inches above the floor of the garret, which it nearly\r\nequalled in dimensions. Here were to be huddled together, with very\r\nlittle covering, old men and women, young men and children, with no\r\nregard to age, sex, or propensities.\r\n\r\n“The ‘mot’ of the ‘ken’ (nickname for ‘matron of the _establishment_’)\r\nhad discovered that I was a ‘more bettermost’ sort of person, and\r\nhinted that, if I would ‘come down’ with twopence more (threepence was\r\nthe regular nightly charge), I, ‘and the young gal as I was with,’\r\nmight have a little ‘crib’ to ourselves in a little room, along with\r\nanother woman wot was married and had a ‘kid,’ and whose husband had\r\ngot a month for ‘griddling in the main drag’ (singing in the high\r\nstreet), and being ‘cheekish’ (saucy) to the beadle.\r\n\r\n“Next morning I bade adieu to the ‘Bug-trap,’ and I hope for ever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same informant further stated that he was some time upon “tramp”\r\nbefore he even knew of the existence of a common lodging-house: “After\r\nI had ‘matriculated’ at Sheffield,” he says, “I continued some time\r\ngoing to public-houses to sleep, until my apparel having got shabby\r\nand my acquintance with misfortune more general, I submitted to be the\r\nassociate of persons whom I never spoke to out of doors, and whose even\r\nslight acquaintance I have long renounced. My first introduction to a\r\nLondon paddin’ ken was in Whitechapel, the place was then called Cat\r\nand Wheel-alley (now Commercial-street). On the spot where St. Jude’s\r\nchurch now stands was a double lodging-house, kept by a man named\r\nShirley--one side of it was for single men and women, the other married\r\ncouples; as these ‘couples’ made frequent exchanges, it is scarcely\r\nprobable that Mr. Shirley ever ‘asked to see their marriage lines.’\r\nThese changes were, indeed, as common as they were disgusting. I knew\r\ntwo brothers (Birmingham nailers) who each brought a young woman out\r\nof service from the country. After a while each became dissatisfied\r\nwith his partner. The mistress of the house (an old procuress from\r\nPortsmouth) proposed that they should change their wives. They did so,\r\nto the amusement of nine other couples sleeping on the same floor, and\r\nsome of whom followed the example, and more than once during the night.\r\n\r\n“When Cat and Wheel-alley was pulled down, the crew removed to\r\nGeorge-yard; the proprietor died, and his wife sold the concern to a\r\nwooden-legged Welshman named Hughes (commonly called ‘Taff’). I was\r\nthere some time. ‘Taff’ was a notorious receiver of stolen goods. I\r\nknew two little boys, who brought home six pairs of new Wellington\r\nboots, which this miscreant bought at 1_s._ per pair; and, when they\r\nhad no luck, he would take the strap off his wooden-leg, and beat them\r\nthrough the nakedness of their rags. He boarded and lodged about a\r\ndozen Chelsea and Greenwich pensioners. These he used to follow and\r\nwatch closely till they got paid; then (after they had settled with\r\nhim) he would make them drunk, and rob them of the few shillings they\r\nhad left.\r\n\r\n“One of these dens of infamy may be taken as a specimen of the whole\r\nclass. They have generally a spacious, though often ill-ventilated,\r\nkitchen, the dirty dilapidated walls of which are hung with prints,\r\nwhile a shelf or two are generally, though barely, furnished with\r\ncrockery and kitchen utensils. In some places knives and forks are\r\nnot provided, unless a penny is left with the ‘deputy,’ or manager,\r\ntill they are returned. A brush of any kind is a stranger, and a\r\nlooking-glass would be a miracle. The average number of nightly lodgers\r\nis in winter 70, and in summer (when many visit the provinces) from 40\r\nto 45. The general charge is, if two sleep together, 3_d._ per night,\r\nor 4_d._ for a single bed. In either case, it is by no means unusual to\r\nfind 18 or 20 in one small room, the heat and horrid smell from which\r\nare insufferable; and, where there are young children, the staircases\r\nare the lodgment of every kind of filth and abomination. In some houses\r\nthere are rooms for families, where, on a rickety machine, which they\r\ndignify by the name of a bedstead, may be found the man, his wife, and\r\na son or daughter, perhaps 18 years of age; while the younger children,\r\naged from 7 to 14, sleep on the floor. If they have linen, they take it\r\noff to escape vermin, and rise naked, one by one, or sometimes brother\r\nand sister together. This is no ideal picture; the subject is too\r\ncapable of being authenticated to need that meaningless or dishonest\r\nassistance called ‘allowable exaggeration.’ The amiable and deservedly\r\npopular minister of a district church, built among lodging-houses, has\r\nstated that he has found 29 human beings in one apartment; and that\r\nhaving with difficulty knelt down between two beds to pray with a dying\r\nwoman, his legs became so jammed that he could hardly get up again.\r\n\r\n“Out of some fourscore such habitations,” continues my informant, “I\r\nhave only found _two_ which had any sort of garden; and, I am happy to\r\nadd, that in neither of these two was there a single case of cholera.\r\nIn the others, however, the pestilence raged with terrible fury.\r\n\r\n“Of all the houses of this sort, the best I know is the one (previously\r\nreferred to) in Orchard-street, Westminister, and another in Seven\r\nDials, kept by a Mr. Mann (formerly a wealthy butcher). Cleanliness\r\nis inscribed on every wall of the house; utensils of every kind are\r\nin abundance, with a plentiful supply of water and gas. The beds do\r\nnot exceed five in a room, and they are changed every week. There is\r\nnot one disorderly lodger; and although the master has sustained heavy\r\nlosses, ill health, and much domestic affliction, himself and his house\r\nmay be regarded as patterns of what is wanted for the London poor.\r\n\r\n“As there is a sad similarity between these abodes, so there is a\r\nsort of _caste_ belonging in general to the inmates. Of them it\r\nmay be averred that whatever their pursuits, they are more or less\r\nalike in their views of men and manners. They hate the aristocracy.\r\nWhenever there is a rumour or an announcement of an addition to the\r\nRoyal Family, and the news reaches the padding-ken, the kitchen, for\r\nhalf-an-hour, becomes the scene of uproar--‘another expense coming\r\non the b--y country!’ The ‘patterers’ are very fond of the Earl of\r\nCarlisle, whom, in their attachment, they still call Lord Morpeth; they\r\nhave read many of his lordship’s speeches at _soirées_, &c., and they\r\nthink he wishes well to a poor man. Sir James Graham had better not\r\nshow face among them; they have an idea (whence derived we know not)\r\nthat this nobleman invented fourpenny-pieces, and now, they say, the\r\nswells give a ‘joey’ where they used to give a ‘tanner.’ The hero of\r\nWaterloo is not much amiss ‘if he lets politics alone.’ The name of\r\na bishop is but another name for a Beelzebub; but they are very fond\r\nof the inferior clergy. Lay-agents and tract-distributors they cannot\r\nbear; they think they are spies come to see how much ‘scran’ (food)\r\nthey have got, and then go and ‘pyson’ the minds of the public against\r\npoor people.\r\n\r\n“I was once (says our informant) in a house of this kind, in\r\nGeorge-street, St. Giles’s,--the missionary who visited them on that\r\noccasion (Sunday afternoon) had the misfortune to be suspected as the\r\nauthor of some recent exposure in the newspapers.--They accused him,\r\nand he rebutted the accusation; they replied, and he rejoined; at last\r\none of the men said, ‘What do you want poking your nose in here for?’\r\n‘The City Mission,’ was the answer, ‘had authorised ----.’ ‘Authorised\r\nbe d--d! are you ordained?’ ‘No, not yet, friend.’ The women then tore\r\nthe poor gentleman’s nether garments in a way I must not describe. The\r\nmen carried him into the yard, filled his mouth with flour of mustard\r\nand then put him in a water-butt.\r\n\r\n“It is, I am satisfied, quite a mistake to suppose that there is much\r\nreal infidelity among these outcast beings. They almost all believe in\r\na hereafter; most of them think that the wicked will be punished for\r\na few years, and then the whole universe of people be embraced in the\r\narms of one Great Forgiving Father. Some of them think that the wicked\r\nwill not rise at _all_; the punishment of ‘losing Heaven’ being as they\r\nsay ‘Hell enough for anybody.’ Points of doctrine they seldom meddle\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n“There are comparatively few Dissenters to be found in padding-kens,\r\nthough many whose parents were Dissenters. My own opinion (writes my\r\ninformant) is, that dissent seldom lasts long in one family. In eight\r\nyears’ experience I have found two hundred apparently pious men and\r\nwomen, and at least two thousand who call themselves Protestants, but\r\nnever go to any church or chapel.\r\n\r\n“The politics of these classes are, perhaps, for the most part,\r\n‘liberal Tory.’ In most lodging-houses they take one or two papers:\r\nthe _Weekly Dispatch_, and _Bell’s Weekly Messenger_, are the two\r\nusually taken. I know of no exception to this rule. The beggars hate\r\na Whig Ministry, and I know that many a tear was shed in the hovels\r\nand cellars of London when Sir Robert Peel died. I know a publican,\r\nin Westminster, whose daily receipts are enormous, and whose only\r\ncustomers are soldiers, thieves, and prostitutes, who closed his house\r\nthe day of the funeral, and put himself, his family, and even his\r\nbeer-machines and gas-pipes, into mourning for the departed statesman.\r\n\r\n“The pattering fraternity, that I write of, are generally much given\r\nto intemperance. Their amusements are the theatre, the free-and-easy,\r\nthe skittle-ground, and sometimes cards and dominoes. They read some\r\nlight works, and some of them subscribe to libraries, and a few, very\r\nfew, attend lectures. Eliza Cook is a favourite writer with them, and\r\nCapt. Marryatt, the ‘top-sawyer,’ as a novelist. Ainsworth is the idol\r\nof another class, when they can read. Mr. Dickens _was_ a favourite,\r\nbut he has gone down sadly in the scale since his _Household Words_\r\n‘came it so strong’ against the begging letter department. These poor\r\ncreatures seldom rise in society. They make no effort to extricate\r\nthemselves, while by others they are unpitied because unknown. To this\r\nrule, however, there are some happy and honourable exceptions.\r\n\r\n“Taken as a body, patterers, lurkers, &c. are by no means quick-sighted\r\nas to the sanctions of moral obligation. They would join the hue and\r\ncry against the persecutors of Jane Wilbred, but a promiscuous robbery,\r\neven accompanied by murder--if it was ‘got up clever’ and ‘done clean,’\r\nso long as the parties escaped detection--might call forth a remark\r\nthat ‘there was no great harm done,’ and perhaps some would applaud the\r\nperpetrators.”\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this part of my subject (viz. the character, habits,\r\nand opinions of _all_ classes of patterers), I will give an account\r\nof the pretended missionary proceedings of a man, well-known to the\r\nvagrant fraternity as “Chelsea George.” I received the following\r\nnarrative from the gentleman whose statements I have given previously.\r\nThe scheme was concocted in a low lodging-house:\r\n\r\n“After a career of incessant ‘lurking’ and deceit, Chelsea George left\r\nEngland, and remained abroad,” writes my informant, “four or five\r\nyears. Exposure to the sun, and allowing his beard to grow a prodigious\r\nlength, gave him the appearance of a foreigner. He had picked up enough\r\nFrench and Italian, with a little Dutch and German, and a smattering\r\nof Spanish, to enable him to ‘hail for any part of the globe,’ and\r\nfrom the designed inarticulateness with which he spoke (sometimes\r\nfour languages in one sentence) added to his sun-burnt and grotesque\r\nappearance, it was difficult to _pall_ him upon any _racket_ (detect\r\nhim in any pretence), so that the most incredulous,--though often\r\npreviously imposed upon--gave credence to his story, relief to his\r\nsupposed necessities, and sometimes letters of introduction to their\r\nfriends and neighbours.\r\n\r\n“Some time after his return to England, and while pursuing the course\r\nof a ‘high-flyer’ (genteel beggar), he met with an interruption to\r\nhis pursuits which induced him to alter his plan without altering his\r\nbehaviour. The newspapers of the district, where he was then located,\r\nhad raised before the eye and mind of the public, what the ‘patterers’\r\nof his class proverbially call a ‘stink,’--that is, had opened the eyes\r\nof the unwary to the movements of ‘Chelsea George;’ and although he\r\nceased to renew his appeals from the moment he heard of the notice of\r\nhim, his appearance was so accurately described that he was captured\r\nand committed to Winchester jail as a rogue and vagabond. The term of\r\nhis imprisonment has escaped my recollection. As there was no definite\r\ncharge against him, probably he was treated as an ordinary vagrant and\r\nsuffered a calendar month in durance. The silent system was not then\r\nin vogue, consequently there existed no barrier to mutual intercourse\r\nbetween prisoners, with all its train of conscience-hardening\r\ntendencies. I do not say this to intimate unqualified approval of the\r\nsolitary system, I merely state a fact which has an influence on my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“George had by this time scraped acquaintance with two\r\nfellow-prisoners--Jew Jem and Russia Bob. The former in ‘quod’ for\r\n‘pattering’ as a ‘converted Jew,’ the latter for obtaining money under\r\nequally false, though less theological, pretences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE KITCHEN,” FOX-COURT, GRAY’S-INN-LANE.]\r\n\r\n“Liberated about one time, this trio laid their heads together,--and\r\nthe result was a plan to evangelize, or rather victimize, the\r\ninhabitants of the collier villages in Staffordshire and the adjoining\r\ncounties. To accomplish this purpose, some novel and imposing\r\nrepresentation must be made, both to lull suspicion and give the air of\r\npiety to the plan, and disinterestedness to the agents by whom it was\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n“George and his two fellow-labourers were ‘square-rigged’--that is,\r\nwell dressed. Something, however, must be done to colour up the scene,\r\nand make the appeal for money touching, unsuspected, and successful.\r\nJust before the time to which I allude, a missionary from Sierra Leone\r\nhad visited the larger towns of the district in question, while the\r\ninhabitants of the surrounding hamlets had been left in ignorance of\r\nthe ‘progress of missions in Africa and the East.’ George and his\r\ncomrades thought it would be no great harm at once to enlighten and\r\nfleece this scattered and anxious population. The plan was laid in a\r\ntown of some size and facility. They ‘raised the wind’ to an extent\r\nadequate to some alteration of their appearances, and got bills printed\r\nto set forth the merits of the cause. The principal actor was Jew Jim,\r\na converted Israelite, with ‘reverend’ before his name, and half the\r\nletters of the alphabet behind it. He had been in all the islands of\r\nthe South Sea, on the coast of Africa, all over Hindostan, and half\r\nover the universe; and after assuring the villagers of Torryburn that\r\nhe had carried the Gospel to various dark and _uninhabited_ parts of\r\nthe earth, he introduced Russia Bob (an Irishman who had, however, been\r\nin Russia) as his worthy and self-denying colleague, and Chelsea George\r\nas the first-fruits of their ministry--as one who had left houses\r\nand land, wife and children, and taken a long and hazardous voyage\r\nto show Christians in England that their sable brethren, children of\r\none common Parent, were beginning to cast their idols to the moles\r\nand to the bats. Earnest was the gaze and breathless the expectation\r\nwith which the poor deluded colliers of Torry-burn listened to this\r\nharangue; and as argument always gains by illustration, the orator\r\npulled out a tremendous black doll, bought for a ‘flag’ (fourpence) of\r\na retired rag-merchant, and dressed up in Oriental style. This, Jew\r\nJim assured the audience, was an idol brought from Murat in Hindostan.\r\nHe presented it to Chelsea George for his worship and embraces. The\r\nconvert indignantly repelled the insinuation, pushed the idol from him,\r\nspat in its face, and cut as many capers as a dancing-bear. The trio at\r\nthis stage of the performances began ‘puckering’ (talking privately) to\r\neach other in murdered French, dashed with a little Irish; after which,\r\nthe missionaries said that their convert (who had only a few words of\r\nEnglish) would now profess his faith. All was attention as Chelsea\r\nGeorge came forward. He stroked his beard, put his hand in his breast\r\nto keep down his dickey, and turning his eyes upwards, said: ‘I believe\r\nin Desus Tist--dlory to ’is ’oly Name!’\r\n\r\n“This elicited some loud ‘amens’ from an assemblage of nearly 1,000\r\npersons, and catching the favourable opportunity, a ‘school of pals,’\r\nappointed for the purpose, went round and made the collection. Out of\r\nthe abundance of their credulity and piety the populace contributed\r\nsixteen pounds! The whole scene was enacted out of doors, and presented\r\nto a stranger very pleasing impressions. I was present on the\r\noccasion, but was not then aware of the dodge. One verse of a hymn,\r\nand the blessing pronounced, was the signal for separation. A little\r\nshaking of hands concluded the exhibition, and ‘every man went into his\r\nown house.’\r\n\r\n“The missionary party and their ‘pals’ took the train to Manchester,\r\nand as none of them were teetotallers, the proceeds of their imposition\r\ndid not last long. They were just putting on their considering caps,\r\nfor the contrivance of another dodge, when a gentleman in blue clothes\r\ncame into the tap-room, and informed Jew Jem that he was ‘wanted.’\r\nIt appears that ‘Jem’ had come out of prison a day or two before his\r\ncomrades, and being ‘hard up,’ had ill-used a lady, taken her purse,\r\nand appropriated its contents. Inquiries, at first useless, had now\r\nproved successful--the ‘missionary’ stood his trial, and got an\r\n‘appointment’ on Norfolk Island. Russia Bob took the cholera and died,\r\nand ‘George the convert’ was once more left alone to try his hand at\r\nsomething else.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LOW LODGING-HOUSES OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nThe patterers, as a class, usually frequent the low lodging-houses. I\r\nshall therefore now proceed to give some further information touching\r\nthe abodes of these people--reminding the reader that I am treating of\r\npatterers in general, and not of any particular order, as the “paper\r\nworkers.”\r\n\r\nIn applying the epithet “low” to these places, I do but adopt the\r\nword commonly applied, either in consequence of the small charge for\r\nlodging, or from the character of their frequenters. To some of these\r\ndomiciles, however, as will be shown, the epithet, in an opprobrious\r\nsense, is unsuited.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man, familiar for some years with some low lodging-house\r\nlife, specified the quarters where those abodes are to be found, and\r\ndivided them into the following districts, the correctness of which I\r\ncaused to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Drury-lane District._ Here the low lodging-houses are to be\r\nfound principally in the Coal-yard, Charles-street, King-street,\r\nParker-street, Short’s-gardens, Great and Little Wyld-streets,\r\nWyld-court, Lincoln-court, Newton-street, Star-court.\r\n\r\n_Gray’s-inn Lane._ Fox-court, Charlotte-buildings, Spread Eagle-court,\r\nPortpool-lane, Bell-court, Baldwin’s-gardens, Pheasant-court,\r\nUnion-buildings, Laystall-street, Cromer-street, Fulwood’s-rents (High\r\nHolborn).\r\n\r\n_Chancery-lane._ Church-passage, and the Liberty of the Rolls.\r\n\r\n_Bloomsbury._ George-street, Church-lane, Queen-street, Seven-dials,\r\nPuckeridge-street (commonly called the Holy Land).\r\n\r\n_Saffron-hill and Clerkenwell._ Peter-street, Cow-cross,\r\nTurnmill-street, Upper and Lower White-cross-street, St. Helen’s-place,\r\nPlayhouse-yard, Chequer-alley, Field-lane, Great Saffron-hill.\r\n\r\n_Westminster._ Old and New Pye-streets, Ann-street, Orchard-street,\r\nPerkins’s-rents, Rochester-row.\r\n\r\n_Lambeth._ Lambeth-walk, New-cut.\r\n\r\n_Marylebone._ York-court, East-street.\r\n\r\n_St. Pancras._ Brooke-street.\r\n\r\n_Paddington._ Chapel-street, Union-court.\r\n\r\n_Shoreditch._ Baker’s-rents, Cooper’s-gardens.\r\n\r\n_Islington._ Angel-yard.\r\n\r\n_Whitechapel, Spitalfields, &c._ George-yard, Thrawl-street, Flower\r\nand Dean-street, Wentworth-street, Keate-street, Rosemary-lane,\r\nGlasshouse-yard, St. George’s-street, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel,\r\nHigh-street.\r\n\r\n_Borough._ Mint-street, Old Kent-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey.\r\n\r\n_Stratford._ High-street.\r\n\r\n_Limehouse._ Hold (commonly called Hole).\r\n\r\n_Deptford._ Mill-lane, Church-street, Gifford-street.\r\n\r\nThere are other localities, (as in Mile-end, Ratcliffe-highway,\r\nShadwell, Wapping, and Lisson-grove,) where low lodging-houses are\r\nto be found; but the places I have specified may be considered the\r\n_districts_ of these hotels for the poor. The worst places, both as\r\nregards filth and immorality, are in St. Giles’s and Wentworth-street,\r\nWhitechapel. The best are in Orchard-street, Westminster (the thieves\r\nhaving left it in consequence of the recent alterations and gone to New\r\nPye-street), and in the Mint, Borough. In the last-mentioned district,\r\nindeed, some of the proprietors of the lodging-houses have provided\r\nconsiderable libraries for the use of the inmates. In the White Horse,\r\nMint-street, for instance, there is a collection of 500 volumes, on\r\nall subjects, bought recently, and having been the contents of a\r\ncirculating library, advertised for sale in the _Weekly Dispatch_.\r\n\r\nOf lodging-houses for “travellers” the largest is known as the Farm\r\nHouse, in the Mint: it stands away from any thoroughfare, and lying\r\nlow is not seen until the visitor stands in the yard. Tradition rumour\r\nstates that the house was at one time Queen Anne’s, and was previously\r\nCardinal Wolsey’s. It was probably some official residence. In this\r\nlodging-house are forty rooms, 200 beds (single and double), and\r\naccommodation for 200 persons. It contains three kitchens,--of which\r\nthe largest, at once kitchen and sitting-room, holds 400 people, for\r\nwhose uses in cooking there are two large fire-places. The other two\r\nkitchens are used only on Sundays; when one is a preaching-room, in\r\nwhich missionaries from Surrey Chapel (the Rev. James Sherman’s),\r\nor some minister or gentleman of the neighbourhood, officiates. The\r\nother is a reading-room, supplied with a few newspapers and other\r\nperiodicals; and thus, I was told, the religious and irreligious need\r\nnot clash. For the supply of these papers each person pays 1_d._\r\nevery Sunday morning; and as the sum so collected is more than is\r\nrequired for the expenses of the reading-room, the surplus is devoted\r\nto the help of the members in sickness, under the management of the\r\nproprietor of the lodging-house, who appears to possess the full\r\nconfidence of his inmates. The larger kitchen is detached from the\r\nsleeping apartments, so that the lodgers are not annoyed with the odour\r\nof the cooking of fish and other food consumed by the poor; for in\r\nlodging-houses every sojourner is his own cook. The meal in most demand\r\nis tea, usually with a herring, or a piece of bacon.\r\n\r\nThe yard attached to the Farm House, in Mint-street, covers an acre\r\nand a half; in it is a washing-house, built recently, the yard itself\r\nbeing devoted to the drying of the clothes--washed by the customers\r\nof the establishment. At the entrance to this yard is a kind of\r\nporter’s lodge, in which reside the porter and his wife who act as\r\nthe “deputies” of the lodging-house. This place has been commended\r\nin sanitary reports, for its cleanliness, good order, and care for\r\ndecency, and for a proper division of the sexes. On Sundays there is no\r\ncharge for lodging to known customers; but this is a general practice\r\namong the low lodging-houses of London.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this house I could cite many instances, but I need do\r\nno more in this place than refer to the statements, which I shall\r\nproceed to give; some of these were collected in the course of a\r\nformer inquiry, and are here given because the same state of things\r\nprevails now. I was told by a trustworthy man that not long ago he\r\nwas compelled to sleep in one of the lowest (as regards cheapness) of\r\nthe lodging-houses. All was dilapidation, filth, and noisomeness. In\r\nthe morning he drew, for purposes of ablution, a basinfull of water\r\nfrom a pailfull kept in the room. In the water were floating alive, or\r\napparently alive, bugs and lice, which my informant was convinced had\r\nfallen from the ceiling, shaken off by the tread of some one walking in\r\nthe rickety apartments above!\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” said another man with whom I conversed on the subject,\r\n“if you had lived in the lodging-houses, you would say what a vast\r\ndifference a penny made,--it’s often all in all. It’s 4_d._ in the Mint\r\nHouse you’ve been asking me about; you’ve sleep and comfort there, and\r\nI’ve seen people kneel down and say their prayers afore they went to\r\nbed. Not so many, though. Two or three in a week at nights, perhaps.\r\nAnd it’s wholesome and sweet enough there, and large separate beds;\r\nbut in other places there’s nothing to smell or feel but bugs. When\r\ndaylight comes in the summer--and it’s often either as hot as hell\r\nor as cold as icicles in those places; but in summer, as soon as its\r\nlight, if you turn down the coverlet, you’ll see them a-going it like\r\nCheapside when it’s throngest.” The poor man seemed to shudder at the\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nOne informant counted for me 180 of these low lodging-houses; and it\r\nis reasonable to say that there are, in London, at least 200 of them.\r\nThe average number of beds in each was computed for me, by persons\r\ncognizant of such matters, from long and often woful experience, at 52\r\nsingle or 24 double beds, where the house might be confined to single\r\nmen or single women lodgers, or to married or pretendedly married\r\ncouples, or to both classes. In either case, we may calculate the\r\nnumber that can be, and generally are, accommodated at 50 per house;\r\nfor children usually sleep with their parents, and 50 may be the lowest\r\ncomputation. We have thus no fewer than 10,000 persons domiciled, more\r\nor less permanently, in the low lodging-houses of London--a number more\r\nthan doubling the population of many a parliamentary borough.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of these lodging-houses mostly have been, I am assured,\r\nvagrants, or, to use the civiller and commoner word, “travellers”\r\nthemselves, and therefore sojourners, on all necessary occasions, in\r\nsuch places. In four cases out of five I believe this to be the case.\r\nThe proprietors have raised capital sufficient to start with, sometimes\r\nby gambling at races, sometimes by what I have often, and very vaguely,\r\nheard described as a “run of luck;” and sometimes, I am assured, by the\r\nproceeds of direct robbery. A few of the proprietors may be classed as\r\ncapitalists. One of them, who has a country house in Hampstead, has\r\nsix lodging-houses in or about Thrawl-street, Whitechapel. He looks\r\nin at each house every Saturday, and calls his deputies--for he has\r\na deputy in each house--to account; he often institutes a stringent\r\ncheck. He gives a poor fellow money to go and lodge in one of his\r\nhouses, and report the number present. Sometimes the person so sent\r\nmeets with the laconic repulse--“Full;” and woe to the deputy if his\r\nreturn do not evince this fulness. Perhaps one in every fifteen of the\r\nlow lodging-houses in town is also a beer-shop. Very commonly so in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo “start” a low lodging-house is not a very costly matter. Furniture\r\nwhich will not be saleable in the ordinary course of auction, or of\r\nany traffic, is bought by a lodging-house “starter.” A man possessed\r\nof some money, who took an interest in a bricklayer, purchased for\r\n20_l._, when the Small Pox Hospital, by King’s-cross, was pulled down,\r\na sufficiency of furniture for _four_ lodging-houses, in which he\r\n“started” the man in question. None others would buy this furniture,\r\nfrom a dread of infection.\r\n\r\nIt was the same at Marlborough-house, Peckham, after the cholera had\r\nbroken out there. The furniture was sold to a lodging-house keeper, at\r\n9_d._ each article. “Big and little, sir,” I was told; “a penny pot and\r\na bedstead--all the same; each 9_d._ Nobody else would buy.”\r\n\r\nTo about three-fourths of the low lodging-houses of London, are\r\n“deputies.” These are the conductors or managers of the establishment,\r\nand are men or women (and not unfrequently a married, or proclaimed\r\na married couple), and about in equal proportion. These deputies are\r\npaid from 7_s._ to 15_s._ a week each, according to the extent of\r\ntheir supervision; their lodging always, and sometimes their board,\r\nbeing at the cost of “the master.” According to the character of the\r\nlodging-house, the deputies are civil and decent, or roguish and\r\ninsolent. Their duty is not only that of general superintendence, but\r\nin some of the houses of a nocturnal inspection of the sleeping-rooms;\r\nthe deputy’s business generally keeping him up all night. At the\r\nbetter-conducted houses strangers are not admitted after twelve at\r\nnight; in others, there is no limitation as to hours.\r\n\r\nThe rent of the low lodging-houses varies, I am informed, from 8_s._ to\r\n20_s._ a week, the payment being for the most part weekly; the taxes\r\nand rates being of course additional. It is rarely that the landlord,\r\nor his agent, can be induced to expend any money in repairs,--the wear\r\nand tear of the floors, &c., from the congregating together of so many\r\nhuman beings being excessive: this expenditure in consequence falls\r\nupon the tenant.\r\n\r\nSome of the lodging-houses present no appearance differing from that\r\nof ordinary houses; except, perhaps, that their exterior is dirtier.\r\nSome of the older houses have long flat windows on the ground-floor,\r\nin which there is rather more paper, or other substitutes, than glass.\r\n“The windows there, sir,” remarked one man, “are not to let the light\r\nin, but to keep the cold out.”\r\n\r\nIn the abodes in question there seems to have become tacitly\r\nestablished an arrangement as to what character of lodgers shall\r\nresort thither; the thieves, the prostitutes, and the better class of\r\nstreet-sellers or traders, usually resorting to the houses where they\r\nwill meet the same class of persons. The patterers reside chiefly in\r\nWestminster and Whitechapel.\r\n\r\nSome of the lodging-houses are of the worst class of low brothels, and\r\nsome may even be described as brothels for children.\r\n\r\nOn many of the houses is a rude sign, “Lodgings for Travellers, 3_d._\r\na night. Boiling water always ready,” or the same intimation may be\r\npainted on a window-shutter, where a shutter is in existence. A few of\r\nthe better order of these housekeepers post up small bills, inviting\r\nthe attention of “travellers,” by laudations of the cleanliness, good\r\nbeds, abundant water, and “gas all night,” to be met with. The same\r\nparties also give address-cards to travellers, who can recommend one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe beds are of flock, and as regards the mere washing of the rug,\r\nsheet, and blanket, which constitute the bed-furniture, are in\r\nbetter order than they were a few years back; for the visitations of\r\nthe cholera alarmed even the reckless class of vagrants, and those\r\nwhose avocations relate to vagrants. In perhaps a tenth of the low\r\nlodging-houses of London, a family may have a room to themselves, with\r\nthe use of the kitchen, at so much a week--generally 2_s._ 6_d._ for a\r\ncouple without family, and 3_s._ 6_d._ where there are children. To let\r\nout “beds” by the night is however the general rule.\r\n\r\nThe illustration presented this week is of a place in Fox-court,\r\nGray’s-inn-lane, long notorious as a “thieves’ house,” but now far\r\nless frequented. On the visit, a few months back, of an informant\r\n(who declined staying there), a number of boys were lying on the\r\nfloor gambling with marbles and halfpennies, and indulging in savage\r\nor unmeaning blasphemy. One of the lads jumped up, and murmuring\r\nsomething that it wouldn’t do to be idle any longer, induced a woman\r\nto let him have a halfpenny for “a stall;” that is, as a pretext with\r\nwhich to enter a shop for the purpose of stealing, the display of the\r\ncoin forming an excuse for his entrance. On the same occasion a man\r\nwalked into “the kitchen,” and coolly pulled from underneath the back\r\nof his smock-frock a large flat piece of bacon, for which he wanted a\r\ncustomer. It would be sold at a fourth of its value.\r\n\r\nI am assured that the average takings of lodging-house keepers may\r\nbe estimated at 17_s._ 6_d._ a night, not to say 20_s._; but I adopt\r\nthe lower calculation. This gives a weekly payment by the struggling\r\npoor, the knavish, and the outcast, of 1,000 guineas weekly, or\r\n52,000 guineas in the year. Besides the rent and taxes, the principal\r\nexpenditure of the lodging-house proprietors is for coals and gas. In\r\nsome of the better houses, blacking, brushes, and razors are supplied,\r\nwithout charge, to the lodgers: also pen and ink, soap, and, almost\r\nalways, a newspaper. For the meals of the frequenters salt is supplied\r\ngratuitously, and sometimes, but far less frequently, pepper also;\r\nnever vinegar or mustard. Sometimes a halfpenny is charged for the\r\nuse of a razor and the necessary shaving apparatus. In one house in\r\nKent-street, the following distich adorns the mantel-piece:\r\n\r\n  “To save a journey up the town,\r\n  A razor lent here for a _brown_:\r\n  But if you think the price too high,\r\n  I beg you won’t the razor try.”\r\n\r\nIn some places a charge of a halfpenny is made for hot water, but that\r\nis very rarely the case. Strong drink is admitted at almost any hour in\r\nthe majority of the houses, and the deputy is generally ready to bring\r\nit; but little is consumed in the houses, those addicted to the use or\r\nabuse of intoxicating liquors preferring the tap-room or the beer-shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FILTH, DISHONESTY, AND IMMORALITY OF LOW LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nIn my former and my present inquiries, I received many statements\r\non this subject. Some details, given by coarse men and boys in the\r\ngrossest language, are too gross to be more than alluded to, but the\r\nfull truth must be manifested, if not detailed. It was remarked when\r\nmy prior account appeared, that the records of gross profligacy on\r\nthe part of some of the most licentious of the rich (such as the late\r\nMarquis of Hertford and other worthies of the same depraved habits)\r\nwere equalled, or nearly equalled, by the account of the orgies of\r\nthe lowest lodging-houses. Sin, in any rank of life, shows the same\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to the want of cleanliness, comfort, and decency: “Why,\r\nsir,” said one man, who had filled a commercial situation of no little\r\nimportance, but had, through intemperance, been reduced to utter\r\nwant, “I myself have slept in the top room of a house not far from\r\nDrury-lane, and you could study the stars, if you were so minded,\r\nthrough the holes left by the slates having been blown off the roof.\r\nIt was a fine summer’s night, and the openings in the roof were then\r\nrather an advantage, for they admitted air, and the room wasn’t so foul\r\nas it might have been without them. I never went there again, but you\r\nmay judge what thoughts went through a man’s mind--a man who had seen\r\nprosperous days--as he lay in a place like that, without being able to\r\nsleep, watching the sky.”\r\n\r\nThe same man told me (and I received abundant corroboration of his\r\nstatement, besides that incidental mention of the subject occurs\r\nelsewhere), that he had scraped together a handful of bugs from the\r\nbed-clothes, and crushed them under a candlestick, and had done that\r\nmany a time, when he could only resort to the lowest places. He had\r\nslept in rooms so crammed with sleepers--he believed there were 30\r\nwhere 12 would have been a proper number--that their breaths in the\r\ndead of night and in the unventilated chamber, rose (I use his own\r\nwords) “in one foul, choking steam of stench.” This was the case most\r\nfrequently a day or two prior to Greenwich Fair or Epsom Races, when\r\nthe congregation of the wandering classes, who are the supporters of\r\nthe low lodging-houses, was the thickest. It was not only that two\r\nor even three persons jammed themselves into a bed not too large for\r\none full-sized man; but between the beds--and their partition one\r\nfrom another admitted little more than the passage of a lodger--were\r\nplaced shakes-down, or temporary accommodation for nightly slumber.\r\nIn the better lodging-houses the shake-downs are small palliasses or\r\nmattresses; in the worst, they are bundles of rags of any kind; but\r\nloose straw is used only in the country for shake-downs. One informant\r\nsaw a traveller, who had arrived late, eye his shake-down in one of the\r\nworst houses with anything but a pleased expression of countenance; and\r\na surly deputy, observing this, told the customer he had his choice,\r\n“which,” the deputy added, “it’s not all men as has, or I shouldn’t\r\nhave been waiting here on you. But you has your choice, I tell\r\nyou;--sleep there on that shake-down, or turn out and be d----; that’s\r\nfair.” At some of the busiest periods, numbers sleep on the kitchen\r\nfloor, all huddled together, men and women (when indecencies are common\r\nenough), and without bedding or anything but their scanty clothes to\r\nsoften the hardness of the stone or brick floor. A penny is saved to\r\nthe lodger by this means. More than 200 have been accommodated in this\r\nway in a large house. The Irish, at harvest-time, very often resort to\r\nthis mode of passing the night.\r\n\r\nI heard from several parties, of the surprise, and even fear or horror,\r\nwith which a decent mechanic--more especially if he were accompanied by\r\nhis wife--regarded one of these foul dens, when destitution had driven\r\nhim there for the first time in his life. Sometimes such a man was seen\r\nto leave the place abruptly, though perhaps he had pre-paid his last\r\nhalfpenny for the refreshment of a night’s repose. Sometimes he was\r\nseized with sickness. I heard also from some educated persons who had\r\n“seen better days,” of the disgust with themselves and with the world,\r\nwhich they felt on first entering such places. “And I have some reason\r\nto believe,” said one man, “that a person, once well off, who has sunk\r\ninto the very depths of poverty, often makes his first appearance in\r\none of the worst of those places. Perhaps it is because he keeps away\r\nfrom them as long as he can, and then, in a sort of desperation fit,\r\ngoes into the cheapest he meets with; or if he knows it’s a vile place,\r\nhe very likely says to himself--I did--‘I may as well know the worst at\r\nonce.’”\r\n\r\nAnother man who had moved in good society, said, when asked about\r\nhis resorting to a low lodging-house: “When a man’s lost caste in\r\nsociety, he may as well go the whole hog, bristles and all, and a low\r\nlodging-house is the entire pig.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding many abominations, I am assured that the lodgers, in\r\neven the worst of these habitations, for the most part sleep soundly.\r\nBut they have, in all probability, been out in the open air the whole\r\nof the day, and all of them may go to their couches, after having\r\nwalked, perhaps, many miles, exceedingly fatigued, and some of them\r\nhalf-drunk. “Why, in course, sir,” said a “traveller,” whom I spoke\r\nto on this subject, “if you is in a country town or village, where\r\nthere’s only one lodging-house, perhaps, and that a bad one--an old\r\nhand can always suit his-self in London--you _must_ get half-drunk, or\r\nyour money for your bed is wasted. There’s so much rest owing to you,\r\nafter a hard day; and bugs and bad air’ll prevent its being paid, if\r\nyou don’t lay in some stock of beer, or liquor of some sort, to sleep\r\non. It’s a duty you owes yourself; but, if you haven’t the browns,\r\nwhy, then, in course, you can’t pay it.” I have before remarked, and,\r\nindeed, have given instances, of the odd and sometimes original manner\r\nin which an intelligent patterer, for example, will express himself.\r\n\r\nThe information I obtained in the course of this inquiry into the\r\ncondition of low lodging-houses, afforded a most ample corroboration\r\nof the truth of a remark I have more than once found it necessary to\r\nmake before--that persons of the vagrant class will sacrifice almost\r\nanything for warmth, not to say heat. Otherwise, to sleep, or even sit,\r\nin some of the apartments of these establishments would be intolerable.\r\n\r\nFrom the frequent state of weariness to which I have alluded, there\r\nis generally less conversation among the frequenters of the low\r\nlodging-houses than might be expected. Some are busy cooking, some\r\n(in the better houses) are reading, many are drowsy and nodding, and\r\nmany are smoking. In perhaps a dozen places of the worst and filthiest\r\nclass, indeed, smoking is permitted even in the sleeping-rooms; but\r\nit is far less common than it was even half-a-dozen years back, and\r\nbecomes still less common yearly. Notwithstanding so dangerous a\r\npractice, fires are and have been very unfrequent in these places.\r\nThere is always some one awake, which is one reason. The lack of\r\nconversation, I ought to add, and the weariness and drowsiness, are\r\nless observable in the lodging-houses patronised by thieves and women\r\nof abandoned character, whose lives are comparatively idle, and whose\r\nlabour a mere nothing. In their houses, if the conversation be at all\r\ngeneral, it is often of the most unclean character. At other times it\r\nis carried on in groups, with abundance of whispers, shrugs, and slang,\r\nby the members of the respective schools of thieves or lurkers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now to speak of the habitual violation of all the injunctions\r\nof law, of all the obligations of morality, and of all the restraints\r\nof decency, seen continually in the vilest of the lodging-houses. I\r\nneed but cite a few facts, for to detail minutely might be to disgust.\r\nIn some of these lodging-houses, the proprietor--or, I am told, it\r\nmight be more correct to say, the proprietress, as there are more\r\nwomen than men engaged in the nefarious traffic carried on in these\r\nhouses--are “fences,” or receivers of stolen goods in a small way.\r\n_Their_ “fencing,” unless as the very exception, does not extend to\r\nany plate, or jewellery, or articles of value, but is chiefly confined\r\nto provisions, and most of all to those which are of ready sale to the\r\nlodgers.\r\n\r\nOf very ready sale are “fish got from the gate” (stolen from\r\nBillingsgate); “sawney” (thieved bacon), and “flesh found in\r\nLeadenhall” (butcher’s-meat stolen from that market). I was told by one\r\nof the most respectable tradesmen in Leadenhall-market, that it was\r\ninfested--but not now to so great an extent as it was--with lads and\r\nyoung men, known there as “finders.” They carry bags round their necks,\r\nand pick up bones, or offal, or pieces of string, or bits of papers, or\r\n“anything, sir, please, that a poor lad, that has neither father nor\r\nmother, and is werry hungry, can make a ha’penny by to get him a bit\r\nof bread, please, sir.” This is often but a cover for stealing pieces\r\nof meat, and the finders, with their proximate market for disposal of\r\ntheir meat in the lowest lodging-houses in Whitechapel, go boldly about\r\ntheir work, for the butchers, if the “finder” be detected, “won’t,”\r\nI was told by a sharp youth who then was at a low lodging-house in\r\nKeate-street, “go bothering theirselves to a beak, but gives you a\r\nscruff of the neck and a kick and lets you go. But some of them kicks\r\nwerry hard.” The tone and manner of this boy--and it is a common case\r\nenough with the “prigs”--showed that he regarded hard kicking merely\r\nas one of the inconveniences to which his business-pursuits were\r\nunavoidably subjected; just as a struggling housekeeper might complain\r\nof the unwelcome calls of the tax-gatherers. These depredations\r\nare more frequent in Leadenhall-market than in any of the others,\r\non account of its vicinity to Whitechapel. Even the Whitechapel\r\nmeat-market is less the scene of prey, for it is a series of shops,\r\nwhile Leadenhall presents many stalls, and the finders seem loath to\r\nenter shops without some plausible pretext.\r\n\r\nGroceries, tea especially, stolen from the docks, warehouses, or shops,\r\nare things in excellent demand among the customers of a lodging-house\r\nfence. Tea, known or believed to have been stolen “genuine” from any\r\ndock, is bought and sold very readily; 1_s._ 6_d._, however, is a not\r\nunfrequent price for what is known as 5_s._ tea. Sugar, spices, and\r\nother descriptions of stolen grocery, are in much smaller request.\r\n\r\nWearing-apparel is rarely bought by the fences I am treating of; but\r\nthe stealers of it can and do offer their wares to the lodgers, who\r\nwill often, before buying, depreciate the garment, and say “It’s never\r\nbeen nothing better nor a Moses.”\r\n\r\n“Hens and chickens” are a favourite theft, and “go at once to the pot,”\r\nbut in no culinary sense. The hens and chickens of the roguish low\r\nlodging-houses are the publicans’ pewter measures; the bigger vessels\r\nare “hens;” the smaller are “chickens.” Facilities are provided for\r\nthe melting of these stolen vessels, and the metal is sold by the\r\nthief--very rarely if ever, by the lodging-house keeper, who prefers\r\ndealing with the known customers of the establishment--to marine-store\r\nbuyers.\r\n\r\nA man who at one time was a frequenter of a thieves’ lodging-house,\r\nrelated to me a conversation which he chanced to overhear--he himself\r\nbeing then in what his class would consider a much superior line of\r\nbusiness--between a sharp lad, apparently of twelve or thirteen years\r\nof age, and a lodging-house (female) fence. But it occurred some three\r\nor four years back. The lad had “found” a piece of Christmas beef,\r\nwhich he offered for sale to his landlady, averring that it weighed\r\n6 lbs. The fence said and swore that it wouldn’t weigh 3 lbs., but\r\nshe would give him 5_d._ for it. It probably weighed above 4 lbs.\r\n“Fip-pence!” exclaimed the lad, indignantly; “you haven’t no fairness.\r\nVy, its sixpun’ and Christmas time. Fip-pence! A tanner and a flag (a\r\nsixpence and a four-penny piece) is the werry lowest terms.” There was\r\nthen a rapid and interrupted colloquy, in which the most frequent words\r\nwere: “Go to blazes!” with retorts of “You go to blazes!” and after\r\nstrong and oathful imputations of dishonest endeavours on the part of\r\neach contracting party, to over-reach the other, the meat was sold to\r\nthe woman for 6_d._\r\n\r\nSome of the “fences” board, lodge, and clothe, two or three boys or\r\ngirls, and send them out regularly to thieve, the fence usually taking\r\nall the proceeds, and if it be the young thief has been successful, he\r\nis rewarded with a trifle of pocket-money, and is allowed plenty of\r\nbeer and tobacco.\r\n\r\nOne man, who keeps three low lodging-houses (one of which is a\r\nbeer-shop), not long ago received from a lodger a valuable great-coat,\r\nwhich the man said he had taken from a gig. The fence (who was in a\r\nlarger way of business than others of his class, and is reputed rich,)\r\ngave 10_s._ for the garment, asking at the same time, “Who was minding\r\nthe gig?” “A charity kid,” was the answer. “Give him a deuce” (2_d._),\r\n“and stall him off” (send him an errand), said the fence, “and bring\r\nthe horse and gig, and I’ll buy it.” It was done, and the property was\r\ntraced in two hours, but only as regarded the gig, which had already\r\nhad a new pair of wheels attached to it, and was so metamorphosed, that\r\nthe owner, a medical gentleman, though he had no moral doubt on the\r\nsubject, could not swear to his own vehicle. The thief received only\r\n4_l._ for gig and horse; the horse was never traced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe licentiousness of the frequenters, and more especially of the\r\njuvenile frequenters, of the low lodging-houses, must be even more\r\nbriefly alluded to. In some of these establishments, men and women,\r\nboys and girls,--but perhaps in no case, or in very rare cases, unless\r\nthey are themselves consenting parties, herd together promiscuously.\r\nThe information which I have given from a reverend informant\r\nindicates the nature of the proceedings, when the sexes are herded\r\nindiscriminately, and it is impossible to present to the reader, in\r\nfull particularity, the records of the vice practised.\r\n\r\nBoys have boastfully carried on loud conversations, and from distant\r\nparts of the room, of their triumphs over the virtue of girls, and\r\ngirls have laughed at and encouraged the recital. Three, four, five,\r\nsix, and even more boys and girls have been packed, head and feet,\r\ninto one small bed; some of them perhaps never met before. On such\r\noccasions any clothing seems often enough to be regarded as merely\r\nan incumbrance. Sometimes there are loud quarrels and revilings from\r\nthe jealousy of boys and girls, and more especially of girls whose\r\n“chaps” have deserted or been inveigled from them. At others, there\r\nis an amicable interchange of partners, and next day a resumption of\r\ntheir former companionship. One girl, then fifteen or sixteen, who had\r\nbeen leading this vicious kind of life for nearly three years, and had\r\nbeen repeatedly in prison, and twice in hospitals--and who expressed a\r\nstrong desire to “get out of the life” by emigration--said: “Whatever\r\nthat’s bad and wicked, that any one can fancy could be done in such\r\nplaces among boys and girls that’s never been taught, or won’t be\r\ntaught, better, _is_ done, and night after night.” In these haunts of\r\nlow iniquity, or rather in the room into which the children are put,\r\nthere are seldom persons above twenty. The younger lodgers in such\r\nplaces live by thieving and pocket-picking, or by prostitution. The\r\ncharge for a night’s lodging is generally 2_d._, but smaller children\r\nhave often been admitted for 1_d._ If a boy or girl resort to one of\r\nthese dens at night without the means of defraying the charge for\r\naccommodation, the “mot of the ken” (mistress of the house) will pack\r\nthem off, telling them plainly that it will be no use their returning\r\nuntil they have stolen something worth 2_d._ If a boy or girl do\r\nnot return in the evening, and have not been heard to express their\r\nintention of going elsewhere, the first conclusion arrived at by their\r\nmates is that they have “got into trouble” (prison).\r\n\r\nThe indiscriminate admixture of the sexes among adults, in many of\r\nthese places, is another evil. Even in some houses considered of\r\nthe better sort, men and women, husbands and wives, old and young,\r\nstrangers and acquaintances, sleep in the same apartment, and if\r\nthey choose, in the same bed. Any remonstrance at some act of gross\r\ndepravity, or impropriety on the part of a woman not so utterly\r\nhardened as the others, is met with abuse and derision. One man who\r\ndescribed these scenes to me, and had long witnessed them, said that\r\nalmost the only women who ever hid their faces or manifested dislike of\r\nthe proceedings they could not but notice (as far as he saw), were poor\r\nIrishwomen, generally those who live by begging: “But for all that,”\r\nthe man added, “an Irishman or Irishwoman of that sort will sleep\r\nanywhere, in any mess, to save a halfpenny, though they may have often\r\na few shillings, or a good many, hidden about them.”\r\n\r\nThere is no provision for purposes of decency in some of the places I\r\nhave been describing, into which the sexes are herded indiscriminately;\r\nbut to this matter I can only allude. A policeman, whose duty sometimes\r\ncalled him to enter one of those houses at night, told me that he never\r\nentered it without feeling sick.\r\n\r\nThere are now fewer of such filthy receptacles than there were.\r\nSome have been pulled down--especially for the building of\r\nCommercial-street, in Whitechapel, and of New Oxford-street--and some\r\nhave fallen into fresh and improved management. Of those of the worst\r\nclass, however, there may now be at least thirty in London; while the\r\nlow lodgings of all descriptions, good or bad, are more frequented than\r\nthey were a few years back. A few new lodging-houses, perhaps half a\r\ndozen, have been recently opened, in expectation of a great influx of\r\n“travellers” and vagrants at the opening of the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHILDREN IN LOW LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe informant whose account of patterers and of vagrant life in its\r\nother manifestations I have already given, has written from personal\r\nknowledge and observation the following account of the children in low\r\nlodging-houses:\r\n\r\n“Of the mass of the indigent and outcast,” he says, “of whom the\r\nbusy world know nothing, except from an occasional paragraph in the\r\nnewspaper, the rising generation, though most important, is perhaps\r\nleast considered. Every Londoner must have seen numbers of ragged,\r\nsickly, and ill-fed children, squatting at the entrances of miserable\r\ncourts, streets, and alleys, engaged in no occupation that is either\r\ncreditable to themselves or useful to the community. These are, in many\r\ncases, those whose sole homes are in the low lodging-houses; and I\r\nwill now exhibit a few features of the ‘juvenile performers’ among the\r\n‘London Poor.’\r\n\r\n“In many cases these poor children have lost _one_ of their parents;\r\nin some, they are without either father or mother; but even when both\r\nparents are alive, the case is little mended, for if the parents be of\r\nthe vagrant or dishonest class, their children are often neglected, and\r\nleft to provide for the cost of their food and lodging as they best\r\nmay. The following extract from the chaplain’s report of one of our\r\nprovincial jails, gives a melancholy insight into the training of many\r\nof the families. It is not, I know, without exception; but, much as we\r\ncould wish it to be otherwise, it is so general an occurrence, varied\r\ninto its different forms, that it may be safely accounted as the rule\r\nof action.\r\n\r\n“‘J. G. was born of poor parents. At five years old his father\r\nsucceeded to a legacy of 500_l._ He was quiet, indolent, fond of drink,\r\na good scholar, and had twelve children. He never sent any of them to\r\nschool! “Telling lies,” said the child, “I learned from my mother; she\r\ndid things unknown to father, and gave me a penny not to tell him!” The\r\nfather (on leaving home) left, by request of the mother, some money to\r\npay a man; she slipped up stairs, and told the children to say she was\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“‘From ten to twelve years of age I used to go to the ale-house. I\r\nstole the money from my father, and got very drunk. My father never\r\npunished me for all this, as he ought to have done. In course of time I\r\nwas apprenticed to a tanner; he ordered me to chapel, instead of which\r\nI used to play in the fields. When out of my time I got married, and\r\nstill carried on the same way, starving my wife and children. I used to\r\ntake my little boy, when only five years old, to the public-house, and\r\nmake him drunk with whatever I drank myself. A younger one could act\r\nwell a drunken man on the floor. My wife was a sober steady women; but,\r\nthrough coming to fetch me home she learned to drink too. One of our\r\nchildren used to say, “Mam, you are drunk, like daddy.”’\r\n\r\n“It may be argued that this awful ‘family portrait’ is not the average\r\ncharacter, but I have witnessed too many similar scenes to doubt the\r\n_general_ application of the sad rule.\r\n\r\n“Of those children of the poor, as has been before observed, the\r\nmost have either no parents, or have been deserted by them, and have\r\nno regular means of living, nor moral superintendance on the part\r\nof relatives or neighbours; consequently, they grow up in habits\r\nof idleness, ignorance, vagrancy, or crime. In some cases they are\r\ncountenanced and employed. Here and there may be seen a little urchin\r\nholding a few onions in a saucer, or a diminutive sickly girl standing\r\nwith a few laces or a box or two of lucifers. But even _these_ go\r\nwith the persons who have ‘set them up’ daily to the public-house\r\n(and to the lodging-house at night); and after they have satisfied\r\nthe cravings of hunger, frequently expend their remaining halfpence\r\n(if any) in gingerbread, and as frequently in gin. I have overheard a\r\nproposal for ‘half-a-quartern and a two-out’ (glass) between a couple\r\nof shoeless boys under nine years old. One little fellow of eleven, on\r\nbeing remonstrated with, said that it was the only pleasure in life\r\nthat he had, and he weren’t a-going to give that up. Both sexes of\r\nthis juvenile class frequent, when they can raise the means, the very\r\ncheap and ‘flash’ places of amusement, where the precocious delinquent\r\nacquires the most abandoned tastes, and are often allured by elder\r\naccomplices to commit petty frauds and thefts.\r\n\r\n“Efforts have been made to redeem these young recruits in crime from\r\ntheir sad career, with its inevitable results. In some cases, I rejoice\r\nto believe that success has crowned the endeavour. There is that,\r\nhowever, in the cunning hardihood of the majority of these immature\r\ndelinquents, which presents almost insuperable barriers to benevolence,\r\nand of this I will adduce an instance.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman, living at Islington, who attends one of the city\r\nchurches, is in the habit of crossing the piece of waste ground close\r\nto Saffron-hill. Here he often saw (close to the ragged school) a\r\nherd of boys, and as nearly as he could judge always the _same_ boys.\r\nOne of them always bowed to him as he passed. He thought--and thought\r\nright--that they were gambling, and after, on one occasion, talking\r\nto them very seriously, he gave each of them twopence and pursued his\r\nway. However, he found himself followed by the boy before alluded to,\r\naccompanied by a younger lad, who turned out to be his brother. Both\r\nin one breath begged to know if ‘his honour’ could please to give them\r\nany sort of a job. The gentleman gave them his card, inquired their\r\nplace of residence (a low lodging-house) and the next morning, at nine\r\no’clock, both youths were at his door. He gave them a substantial\r\nbreakfast, and then took them into an outhouse where was a truss of\r\nstraw, and having himself taken off the band, he desired them to\r\nconvey the whole, _one straw at a time_, across the garden and deposit\r\nit in another out-house. The work was easy and the terms liberal, as\r\neach boy was to get dinner and tea, and one shilling per day as long\r\nas his services should be required. Their employer had to go to town,\r\nand left orders with one of his domestics to see that the youths wanted\r\nnothing, and to watch their proceedings; their occupation was certainly\r\nnot laborious, but then it was _work_, and although that was the first\r\nof their requests, it was also the last of their wishes.\r\n\r\n“Taking advantage of an adjoining closet, the servant perceived\r\nthat the weight even of a straw had been too much for these hopeful\r\nboys. They were both seated on the truss, and glibly recounting some\r\nexploits of their own, and how they had been imposed upon by others.\r\nThe eldest--about fourteen--was vowing vengeance upon ‘Taylor Tom’\r\nfor attempting to ‘walk the barber’ (seduce his ‘gal’); while the\r\nyounger--who had scarcely seen eleven summers--averred that it was\r\n‘wery good of the swell to give them summut to eat,’ but ‘precious bad\r\nto be shut up in that crib all day without a bit o’ backer’. Before\r\nthe return of their patron they had transported all the straw to its\r\nappointed designation; as it was very discernible, however, that this\r\nhad been effected by a wholesale process, the boys were admonished,\r\npaid, and dismissed. They are now performing more ponderous work in one\r\nof the penal settlements. Whether the test adopted by the gentleman in\r\nquestion was the best that might have been resorted to, I need not now\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\n“It would be grateful to my feelings if in these disclosures I\r\ncould omit the misdemeanors of the other sex of juveniles; but I am\r\nobliged to own, on the evidence of personal observation, that there\r\nare girls of ages varying from eleven to fifteen who pass the day\r\nwith a ‘fakement’ before them (‘Pity a poor orphan’), and as soon as\r\nevening sets in, loiter at shop-windows and ogle gentlemen in public\r\nwalks, making requests which might be expected only from long-hardened\r\nprostitution. Their nights are generally passed in a low lodging-house.\r\nThey frequently introduce themselves with ‘Please, sir, can you tell\r\nme what time it is?’ If they get a kindly answer, some other casual\r\nobservations prepare the way for hints which are as unmistakeable as\r\nthey are unprincipled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LOW LODGING-HOUSES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nFurther to elucidate this subject, full of importance, as I have shown,\r\nI give an account of low lodging-houses (or “padding-kens”) at the\r\n“stages” (so to speak) observed by a patterer “travelling” from London\r\nto Birmingham.\r\n\r\nI give the several towns which are the usual sleeping places of the\r\ntravellers, with the character and extent of the accommodation provided\r\nfor them, and with a mention of such incidental matters as seemed\r\nto me, in the account I received, to be curious or characteristic.\r\nCircuitous as is the route, it is the one generally followed. Time\r\nis not an object with a travelling patterer. “If I could do better\r\nin the way of tin,” said one of the fraternity to me, “in a country\r\nvillage than in London, why I’d stick to the village--if the better tin\r\nlasted--for six months; aye, sir, for six years. What’s places to a man\r\nlike me, between grub and no grub?” It is probable that on a trial,\r\nsuch a man would soon be weary of the monotony of a village life; but\r\ninto that question I need not now enter.\r\n\r\nI give each stage without the repetition of stating that from “here to\r\nthere” is so many miles; and the charge for a lodging is at such and\r\nsuch a rate. The distance most frequently “travelled” in a day varies\r\nfrom ten to twenty miles, according to the proximity of the towns,\r\nand the character and capabilities (for the patterer’s purposes) of\r\nthe locality. The average charge for a lodging, in the better sort of\r\ncountry lodging-houses, is 4_d._ a night,--at others, 3_d._ In a slack\r\ntime, a traveller, for 4_d._, has a bed to himself. In a busy time--as\r\nat fairs or races--he will account himself fortunate if he obtain _any_\r\nshare of a bed for 4_d._ At some of the places characterised by my\r\ninformant as “rackety,” “queer,” or “Life in London,” the charge is as\r\noften 3_d._ as 4_d._\r\n\r\nThe first stage, then, most commonly attained on tramp, is--\r\n\r\n_Romford._--“It’s a good circuit, sir,” said my principal informant,\r\n“and if you want to see life between from London to Birmingham, why you\r\ncan stretch it and see it for 200 miles.” The Romford “house of call”\r\nmost frequented by the class of whom I treat, is the King’s Arms (a\r\npublic-house.) There is a back-kitchen for the use of travellers, who\r\npay something extra if they choose to resort, and are decent enough\r\nto be admitted, into the tap-room. “Very respectable, sir,” said an\r\ninformant, “and a proper division of married and single, of men and\r\nwomen. Of course they don’t ask any couple to show their marriage\r\nlines; no more than they do any lord and lady, or one that ain’t a\r\nlady, if she’s with a lord, at any fash’nable hotel at Brighton. I’ve\r\ndone tidy well on slums about ‘ladies in a Brighton hotel,’ just by the\r\nSteyne; werry tidy.” In this house they make up forty beds; some of\r\nthem with curtains.\r\n\r\n_Chelmsford._--The Three Queens (a beer-shop.) “A rackety place, sir,”\r\nsaid the man, “one of the showfuls; a dicky one; a free-and-easy. You\r\ncan get a pint of beer and a punch of the head, all for 2_d._ As for\r\nsleeping on a Saturday night there, ‘O, no, we never mention it.’ It\r\nmayn’t be so bad, indeed it ain’t, as some London lodging-houses,\r\nbecause there ain’t the chance, and there’s more known about it.”\r\nFourteen beds.\r\n\r\n_Braintree._--The Castle (a beer-shop.) “Takes in all sorts and all\r\nsizes; all colours and all nations; similar to what’s expected of\r\nthe Crystal Palace. I was a _muck-snipe_ when I was there--why, a\r\nmuck-snipe, sir, is a man regularly done up, coopered, and humped\r\naltogether--and it was a busyish time, and when the deputy paired\r\noff the single men, I didn’t much like my bed-mate. He was a\r\nshabby-genteel, buttoned up to the chin, and in the tract line. I\r\nthought of Old Scratch when I looked at him, though he weren’t a\r\nScotchman, I think. I tipped the wink to an acquaintance there, and\r\ntold him I thought my old complaint was coming on. That was, to kick\r\nand bite like a horse, in my sleep, a’cause my mother was terrified\r\nby a wicious horse not werry long afore I was born. So I dozed on the\r\nbed-side, and began to whinny; and my bed-mate jumped up frightened,\r\nand slept on the floor.” Twenty-two beds.\r\n\r\n_Thaxton._--“A poor place, but I stay two days, it’s so comfortable and\r\nso country, at the Rose and Crown. It’s a sort of rest. It’s decent and\r\ncomfortable too, and it’s about 6_d._ a night to me for singing and\r\npatter in the tap-room. That’s my cokum (advantage).” Ten beds.\r\n\r\n_Saffron Walden._--The Castle. “Better now--was very queer. Slovenly\r\nas could be, and you had to pay for fire, though it was a house of\r\ncall for curriers and other tradesmen, but they never mix with us.\r\nThe landlord don’t care much whose admitted, or how they go on.”\r\nTwenty-four beds.\r\n\r\n_Cambridge._--“The grand town of all. London in miniature. It would\r\nbe better but for the police. I don’t mean the college bull-dogs.\r\nThey don’t interfere with us, only with women. The last time I was\r\nat Cambridge, sir, I hung the Mannings. It was the day, or two days,\r\nI’m not sure which, after their trial. We pattered at night, too late\r\nfor the collegians to come out. We ‘worked’ about where we knew they\r\nlodged--I had a mate with me--and some of the windows of their rooms,\r\nin the colleges themselves, looks into the street. We pattered about\r\nlater news of Mr. and Mrs. Manning. Up went the windows, and cords was\r\nlet down to tie the papers to. But we always had the money first. We\r\nweren’t a-going to trust such out-and-out going young coves as them.\r\nOne young gent. said: ‘I’m a sucking parson; won’t you trust _me_?’\r\n‘No,’ says I, ‘we’ll not trust Father Peter.’ So he threw down 6_d._\r\nand let down his cord, and he says, ‘Send six up.’ We saw it was\r\nVictoria’s head all right, so we sends up three. ‘Where’s the others?’\r\nsays he. ‘O,’ says I, ‘they’re 1_d._ a piece, and 1_d._ a piece extra\r\nfor hanging Mr. and Mrs. Manning, as we have, to a cord; so it’s all\r\nright.’ Some laughed, and some said, ‘D--n you, wait till I see you\r\nin the town.’ But they hadn’t that pleasure. Yorkshire Betty’s is the\r\nhead quarters at Cambridge,--or in Barnwell, of course, there’s no\r\nsuch places in Cambridge. It’s known as ‘W-- and Muck Fort.’ It’s the\r\nreal college touch--the seat of learning, if you’re seeing life. The\r\ncollege lads used to look in there oftener than they do now. They’re\r\ngetting shyer. Men won’t put up with black eyes for nothing. Old\r\nYorkshire Betty’s a motherly body, but she’s no ways particular in her\r\nmanagement. Higgledy-piggledy; men and women; altogether.” Thirty beds.\r\n\r\n_Newmarket._--“The Woolpack. A lively place; middling other ways.\r\nThere’s generally money to be had at Newmarket. I don’t stay there\r\nso long as some, for I don’t care about racing; and the poorest snob\r\nthere’s a sporting character.” Six beds.\r\n\r\n_Bury St. Edmund’s._--“Old Jack Something’s. He was a publican for\r\nforty years. But he broke, and I’ve heard him say that if he hadn’t\r\nbeen a player on the fiddle, he should have destroyed his-self. But his\r\nfiddle diverted him in his troubles. He has a real Cremona, and can’t\r\nhe play it? He’s played at dances at the Duke of Norfolk’s. I’ve heard\r\nhim give the tune he played on his wedding night, years and years back,\r\nbefore I was born. He’s a noble-looking fellow; the fac-simile of Louis\r\nPhilippe. It’s a clean and comfortable, hard and honest place.” Twelve\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n_Mildenhall._--“A private house; I forget the landlord’s name. The\r\nmagistrates is queer there, and so very little work can be done in my\r\nway. I’ve been there when I was the only lodger.” Seven beds.\r\n\r\n_Ely._--“The Tom and Jerry. Very queer. No back kitchen or convenience.\r\nA regular rough place. Often quarrelling there all night long. Any\r\ncaper allowed among men and women. The landlord’s easy frightened.”\r\nFive beds.\r\n\r\n_St. Ives._--“Plume of Feathers. Passable.” Eleven beds.\r\n\r\n_St. Neot’s._--“Bell and Dicky, and very dicky too. Queer doings in the\r\ndos (sleeping) and everything. It’s an out-of-the-way place, or the\r\ntown’s people might see to it, but they won’t take any notice unless\r\nsome traveller complains, and they won’t complain. They’re a body of\r\nmen, sir, that don’t like to run gaping to a beak. The landlord seems\r\nto care for nothing but money. He takes in all that offer. Three in a\r\nbed often; men, women, and children mixed together. It’s anything but a\r\ntidy place.” Thirteen beds.\r\n\r\n_Bedford._--The Cock. “Life in London, sir; I can’t describe it better.\r\nLife in Keate-street, Whitechapel.” Fifteen beds.\r\n\r\n_Irchester._--“I don’t mind the name. A most particular place. You must\r\ngo to bed by nine, or be locked out. It’s hard and honest; clean and\r\nrough.” Six beds.\r\n\r\n_Wellingborough._--“A private house. Smith or Jones, I know, or some\r\ncommon name. Ducker, the soldier that was shot in the Park by Annette\r\nMeyers, lived there. I worked him there myself, and everybody bought. I\r\ndid the gun-trick, sir, (had great success.) It’s an inferior lodging\r\nplace. They’re in no ways particular, not they, who they admit or how\r\nthey dos. At a fair-time, the goings on is anything but fair.” Ten\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n_Northampton._--“Mrs. Bull’s. Comfortable and decent. She takes in\r\nthe _Dispatch_, to oblige her travellers. It’s a nice, quiet, Sunday\r\nhouse.” Twelve beds.\r\n\r\n_Market Harborough._--“There’s a good lady there gives away tracts and\r\nhalf-a-crown. A private house is the traveller’s house, and some new\r\nname. Middling accommodation.” Nine beds.\r\n\r\n_Lutterworth._--“A private house, and I’ll go there no more. Very\r\nqueer. Not the least comfort or decency. They’re above their business,\r\nI think, and take in too many, and care nothing what the travellers do.\r\nHiggledy-piggledy together.” Ten beds.\r\n\r\n_Leicester._--“The Rookery. Rosemary-lane over again, sir, especially\r\nat Black Jack’s. He shakes up the beds with a pitchfork, and brings in\r\nstraw if there’s more than can possibly be crammed into the beds. He’s\r\na fighting man, and if you say a word, he wants to fight you.” Twelve\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n_Hinckley._--“The Tea-board. Comfortable.” Eight beds.\r\n\r\n_Nuneaton._--“The same style as Hinckley. A private house.” Eight beds.\r\n\r\n_Coventry._--“Deserves to be sent further. Bill Cooper’s. A dilapidated\r\nplace, and no sleep, for there’s armies of bugs,--great black fellows.\r\nI call it the Sikh war there, and they’re called Sikhs there, or Sicks\r\nthere, is the vermin; but I’m sick of all such places. They’re not\r\nparticular there,--certainly not.” Twenty beds.\r\n\r\n_Birmingham._--“Mrs. Leach’s. Comfortable and decent, and a good\r\ncreature. I know there’s plenty of houses in Birmingham bad\r\nenough,--London reduced, sir; but I can’t tell you about them from my\r\nown observation, ’cause I always go to Mrs. Leach’s.” Thirty beds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the route most frequented by the pedestrian\r\n“travellers,” we find, taking merely the accommodation of one house\r\nin each place (and in some of the smaller towns there is but one),\r\na supply of beds which may nightly accommodate, on an average, 489\r\ninmates, reckoning at the rate of 12 sleepers to every 8 beds. At\r\nbusy times, double the number will be admitted. And to these places\r\nresort the beggar, the robber, and the pickpocket; the street-patterer\r\nand the street-trader; the musician, the ballad-singer, and the\r\nstreet-performer; the diseased, the blind, the lame, and the\r\nhalf-idiot; the outcast girl and the hardened prostitute; young and\r\nold, and of all complexions and all countries.\r\n\r\nNor does the enumeration end here. To these places must often resort\r\nthe wearied mechanic, travelling in search of employment, and even the\r\nbroken-down gentleman, or scholar, whose means do not exceed 4_d._\r\n\r\nA curious history might be written of the frequenters of low\r\nlodging-houses. Dr. Johnson relates, that when Dean Swift was a young\r\nman, he paid a yearly visit from Sir William Temple’s seat, Moor\r\nPark, to his mother at Leicester. “He travelled on foot, unless some\r\nviolence of weather drove him into a waggon; and at night he would\r\ngo to a penny lodging, where he purchased clean sheets for sixpence.\r\nThis practice Lord Orrery imputes to his (Swift’s) innate love of\r\ngrossness and vulgarity; some may ascribe it to his desire of surveying\r\nhuman life through all its varieties.” Perhaps it might not be very\r\ndifficult to trace, in Swift’s works, the influence upon his mind of\r\nhis lodging-house experience.\r\n\r\nThe same author shows that his friend, Richard Savage, in the\r\nbitterness of his poverty, was also a lodger in these squalid dens: “He\r\npassed the night sometimes in mean houses, which are set open at night\r\nto any casual wanderer; sometimes in cellars, among the riot and filth\r\nof the meanest and most profligate of the rabble.” A Richard Savage of\r\nto-day might, under similar circumstances, have the same thing said of\r\nhim, except that “cellars” might now be described as “ground-floors.”\r\n\r\nThe great, and sometimes the only, luxury of the frequenters of\r\nthese country lodging-houses is tobacco. A man or women who cannot\r\nsmoke, I was told, or was not “hardened” to tobacco smoke, in a low\r\nlodging-house was half-killed with coughing. Sometimes a couple of men,\r\nmay be seen through the thick vapour of the tobacco-smoke, peering\r\neagerly over soiled cards, as they play at all-fours. Sometimes there\r\nis an utter dulness and drowsiness in the common sitting-room, and\r\nhardly a word exchanged for many minutes. I was told by one man of\r\nexperience in these domiciles, that he had not very unfrequently heard\r\ntwo men who were conversing together in a low tone, and probably\r\nagreeing upon some nefarious course, stop suddenly, when there was\r\na pause in the general conversation, and look uneasily about them,\r\nas if apprehensive and jealous that they had been listened to. A\r\n“stranger” in the lodging-house is regarded with a minute and often a\r\nrude scrutiny, and often enough would not be admitted, were not the\r\nlodging-house keeper the party concerned, and he of course admits “all\r\nwhat pays.”\r\n\r\nOne patterer told me of two “inscriptions,” as he called them, which he\r\nhad noticed in country lodgings he had lately visited; the first was:--\r\n\r\n“He who smokes, thinks like a philosopher, and feels like a\r\nphilanthropist.”--_Bulwer’s Night and Morning._\r\n\r\nThe second was an intimation from the proprietor of the house, which,\r\nin spite of its halting explanation, is easily understood:--\r\n\r\n“No sickness allowed, unles by order of the Mare.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET STATIONERS, AND THE STREET CARD-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that the street-stationers--the sellers of\r\nwriting-paper, envelopes, pens, and of the other articles which\r\nconstitute the stationery in the most general demand--were not to be\r\nconfounded with the pattering “paper-workers.” They are, indeed, a\r\ndifferent class altogether. The majority of them have been mechanics,\r\nor in the employ of tradesmen whose callings were not mechanical (as\r\nregards handicraft labour), but what is best described perhaps as\r\ncommercial; or as selling but not producing; as in the instances of the\r\nlarge body of “warehousemen” in the different departments of trade. One\r\nstreet-stationer thought that of his entire body, not more than six had\r\nbeen gentlemen’s servants. He himself knew four who had been in such\r\nemployment, and one only as a boy--but there might be six.\r\n\r\nThe card-sellers are, in the instances I shall show, more akin to the\r\nclass of patterers, and I shall, therefore, give them first. The more\r\nespecially as I can so preserve the consecutiveness of the accounts, in\r\nthe present number, by presenting the reader with a sketch of the life\r\nof an informant, in whose revelations I find that many have taken a\r\nstrong interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SELLER OF THE PENNY SHORT-HAND CARDS.\r\n\r\nAll ladies and gentlemen who “take their walks abroad,” must have\r\nseen, and of course heard, a little man in humble attire engaged in\r\nselling at one penny each a small card, containing a few sentences of\r\nletter-press, and fifteen stenographic characters, with an example,\r\nby which, it is asserted, anybody and everybody may “learn to write\r\nshort-hand in a few hours.” With the merits of the production,\r\nself-considered, this is not the place to meddle; suffice it that it is\r\none of the many ways of getting a crust common to the great metropolis,\r\nand perhaps the most innocent of all the street performances. A kind\r\nof a street lecture is given by the vendor, in which the article is\r\nsufficiently puffed off. Of course this lecture is, so to speak,\r\nstereotyped, embracing the same ideas in nearly the same words over and\r\nover and over again. The exhibitor, however, pleads that the constant\r\nexchange and interchange of passengers, and his desire to give each\r\nand all a fair amount of information, makes the repetition admissible,\r\nand even necessary. It is here given as a specimen of the style of the\r\neducated “patterer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lecture._\r\n\r\n“Here is an opportunity which has seldom if ever been offered to\r\nthe public before, whereby any person of common intellect may learn\r\nto write short-hand in a few hours, without any aid from a teacher.\r\nThe system is entirely my own. It contains no vowels, no arbitrary\r\ncharacters, no double consonants, and no terminations; it may therefore\r\nproperly be called ‘stenography,’ an expression which conveys its own\r\nmeaning; it is derived from two Greek words; _stenos_, short, and\r\n_grapho_, I write, or _graphi_, the verb _to_ write, and embraces\r\nall that is necessary in fifteen characters. I know that a prejudice\r\nobtains to a great extent against anything and everything said or done\r\nin the street, but I have nothing to do with either the majority or\r\nminority of street pretenders. I am an educated man, and not a mere\r\npretender, and if the justice or genuineness of a man’s pretensions\r\nwould always lead him to success I had not been here to-day. But\r\nagainst the tide of human disappointment, the worthy and the\r\nundeserving are so equally compelled to struggle, and so equally liable\r\nto be overturned by competition, that till you can prove that wealth is\r\nthe gauge of character, it may be difficult to determine the ability or\r\nmorality of a man from his position. I was lately reading an account\r\nof the closing life of that leviathan in literature, Dr. Johnson,\r\nand an anecdote occurred, which I relate, conceiving that it applies\r\nto one of the points at issue--I mean the ridicule with which my\r\nlittle publication has sometimes been treated by passers-by, who have\r\nfound it easier to speculate on the texture of my coat, than on the\r\ncharacter of my language. The Doctor had a niece who had embraced the\r\npeculiarities of Quakerism; after he had scolded her some time, and in\r\nrather unmeasured terms, her mother interfered and said, ‘Doctor, don’t\r\nscold the girl--you’ll meet her in heaven, I hope.’--‘I hope not,’ said\r\nthe Doctor, ‘for I hate to meet _fools_ anywhere.’ I apply the same\r\nobservation to persons who bandy about the expressions ‘gift of the\r\ngab,’ ‘catch-penny,’ &c., &c., which in my case it is somewhat easier\r\nto circulate than to support. At any rate they ought to be addressed to\r\n_me_ and not to the atmosphere. The man who meets a foe to the face,\r\ngives him an equal chance of defence, and the sword openly suspended\r\nfrom the belt is a less dangerous, because a less cowardly weapon than\r\nthe one which, like that of Harmodius, is concealed under the wreaths\r\nof a myrtle.\r\n\r\n“If you imagine that professional disappointment is confined to people\r\nout of doors, you are very much mistaken. Look into some of the\r\nmiddle-class streets around where we are standing: you will find here\r\nand there, painted or engraved on a door, the words ‘Mr. So-and-so,\r\nsurgeon.’ The man I am pre-supposing shall be qualified,--qualified\r\nin the technical sense of the expression, a Member of the College of\r\nSurgeons, a Licentiate of Apothecaries’ Hall, and a Graduate of some\r\nUniversity. He may possess the talent of Galen or Hippocrates; or, to\r\ncome to more recent date, of Sir Astley Cooper himself, but he never\r\nbecomes popular, and dies unrewarded because unknown: before he dies,\r\nhe may crawl out of his concealed starvation into such a thoroughfare\r\nas this, and see Professor Morrison, or Professor Holloway, or the\r\nProprietor of Parr’s Life Pills, or some other quack, ride by in their\r\ncarriage; wealth being brought them by the same waves that have wafted\r\nmisfortune to himself; though that wealth has been procured by one\r\nundeviating system of Hypocrisy and Humbug, of Jesuitism and Pantomime,\r\nsuch as affords no parallel since the disgusting period of Oliverian\r\nascendancy. Believe me, my friends, a man may form his plans for\r\nsuccess with profound sagacity, and guard with caution against every\r\napproach to extravagance, but neither the boldness of enterprise nor\r\nthe dexterity of stratagem will always secure the distinction they\r\ndeserve. Else that policeman would have been an inspector!\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes been told, that if I possessed the facilities I\r\nprofessedly exhibit, I might turn them to greater personal advantage:\r\nin coarse, unfettered, Saxon English, ‘That’s a LIE;’ for on the\r\nauthority of a distinguished writer, there are 2,000 educated men in\r\nLondon and its suburbs, who rise every morning totally ignorant where\r\nto find a breakfast. Now I am not _quite_ so bad as that, so that\r\nit appears I am an exception to the rule, and not the rule open to\r\nexception. However, it is beyond all controversy, that the best way to\r\nkeep the fleas from biting you in bed is to ‘get out of bed;’ and by\r\na parity of reasoning, the best way for you to sympathize with me for\r\nbeing on the street is to take me off, as an evidence of your sympathy.\r\nI remember that, some twenty years ago, a poor man of foreign name,\r\nbut a native of this metropolis, made his appearance in Edinburgh, and\r\nadvertised that he would lecture on mnemonics, or the art of memory. As\r\nhe was poor, he had recourse to an humble lecture-room, situated up a\r\ndirty court. Its eligibility may be determined by the fact that sweeps’\r\nconcerts were held in it, at 1/2_d._ per head, and the handbill mostly\r\nended with the memorable words: ‘N.B.--No gentleman admitted without\r\nshoes and stockings.’ At the close of his first lecture (the admission\r\nto which was 2_d._), he was addressed by a scientific man, who gave him\r\n5_s._--(it will relieve the monotony of the present address if some\r\nof you follow his example)--and advised him to print and issue some\r\ncards about his design, which he did. I saw one of them--the ink on it\r\nscarcely dry--as he had got it back at the house of a physician, and\r\non it was inscribed: ‘Old birds are not caught with chaff. From Dr.\r\nM----, an old bird.’ The suspicious doctor, however, was advised to\r\nhear the poor man’s twopenny lecture, and was able, at the end of it,\r\nto display a great feat of memory himself. What was the result? The\r\npoor man no longer lectured for 2_d._ But it is tedious to follow him\r\nthrough a series of years. He was gradually patronised throughout the\r\nkingdom, and a few months ago he was lecturing in the Hanover-square\r\nRooms, with the Earl of Harrowby in the chair. Was he not as clever a\r\nman when he lectured in the sweeps’ concert-room? Yes; but he had not\r\nbeen brought _under the shadow of a great name_. Sometimes that ‘great\r\nname’ comes too late. You are familiar with the case of Chatterton. He\r\nhad existed, rather than lived, three days on a penny loaf; then he\r\ncommitted suicide, and was charitably buried by strangers. Fifty years\r\nor more had elapsed, when people found out how clever he had been, and\r\ncollected money for the erection of that monument which now stands to\r\nhis memory by St. Mary Redcliff Church, in Bristol. Now, if you have\r\nany idea of doing that for me, please to collect some of it while I am\r\n_alive_!”\r\n\r\nOn occasions when the audience is not very liberal, the lecturer treats\r\nthem to the following hint:\r\n\r\n“When in my golden days--or at the least they were silver ones compared\r\nto these--I was in the habit of lecturing on scientific subjects, I\r\nalways gave the introductory lecture _free_. I suppose this is an\r\n‘introductory lecture,’ for it yields very little money at present.\r\nI have often thought, that if everybody a little richer than myself\r\nwas half as conscientious, I should either make a rapid fortune, or\r\nhave nobody to listen to me at all; for I never sanction long with\r\nmy company anything I don’t believe. Now, if what I say is untrue or\r\ngrossly improbable, it does not deserve the sanction of an audience; if\r\notherwise, it must be meritorious, and deserve more efficient sanction.\r\nAs to any insults I receive, Christianity has taught me to forgive, and\r\nphilosophy to despise them.”\r\n\r\nThese very curious, and perhaps unique, specimens of street elocution\r\nare of course interrupted by the occasional sale of a card, and\r\nperhaps some conversation with the purchaser. The stenographic\r\ncard-seller states that he has sometimes been advised to use more\r\ncommonplace language. His reply is germane to the matter. He says\r\nthat a street audience, like some other audiences, is best pleased\r\nwith what they least understand, and that the way to appear sublime\r\nis to be incomprehensible. He can occasionally be a little sarcastic.\r\nA gentleman informed me that he passed him at Bagnigge-wells on one\r\noccasion, when he was interrupted by a “gent.” fearfully disfigured\r\nby the small-pox, who exclaimed: “It’s a complete humbug.” “No, sir,”\r\nretorted Mr. Shorthand, “but if any of the ladies present were to\r\ncall you handsome, _that_ would be a humbug.” On another occasion a\r\nman (half-drunk) had been annoying him some time, and getting tired\r\nof the joke, said: “Well--I see you are a learned man, you must\r\npity my ignorance.” “No,” was the reply, “but I pity your father.”\r\n“Pity my father!--why?” was the response. “Because Solomon says,\r\n‘He that begetteth a fool shall have sorrow of him.’” This little\r\n_jeu-d’ésprit_, I was told, brought forth loud acclamations from the\r\ncrowd, and a crown-piece from a lady who had been some minutes a\r\nlistener. These statements are among the most curious revelations of\r\nthe history of the streets.\r\n\r\nThe short-hand card-seller, as has partly appeared in a report I gave\r\nof a meeting of street-folk, makes no secret of having been fined for\r\nobstructing a thoroughfare,--having been bound down to keep the peace,\r\nand several times imprisoned as a defaulter. He tells me that he once\r\n“got a month” in one of the metropolitan jails. It was the custom of\r\nthe chaplain of the prison in which he was confined, to question the\r\nprisoners every Wednesday, from box to box (as they were arranged\r\nbefore him) on some portion of Holy Writ, and they were expected, if\r\nable, to answer. On one occasion, the subject being the Excellence of\r\nPrayer, the chaplain, remarked that, “even among the heathen, every\r\nauthor, without exception, had commended prayer to a real or supposed\r\nDeity.” The card-seller, I am told, cried out “Question!” “Who is\r\nthat?” said the chaplain. The turnkey pointed out the questioner.\r\n“Yes,” said the card-seller, “you know what Seneca says:--‘Quid opus\r\nvotis? Fac teipsum felicem, vel bonum.’ ‘What need of prayer? Make\r\nthou thyself happy and virtuous.’ Does _that_ recommend prayer?” The\r\nprisoners laughed, and to prevent a mutiny, the classical querist was\r\nlocked up, and the chaplain closed the proceedings. It is but justice,\r\nhowever, to the worthy minister to state, his querist came out of\r\ndurance vile better clothed than he went in.\r\n\r\nThe stenographic trade, of which the informant in question is the sole\r\npursuer, was commenced eleven years ago. At that time 300 cards were\r\nsold in a day; but the average is now 24, and about 50 on a Saturday\r\nnight. The card-seller tells me that he is more frequently than ever\r\ninterrupted by the police, and his health being delicate, wet days\r\nare “nuisances” to him. He makes an annual visit to the country, he\r\ntells me, to see his children, who have been provided for by some kind\r\nfriends. About two years ago he was returning to London and passed\r\nthrough Oxford. He was “hard up,” he says, having left his coat for his\r\nprevious night’s lodging. He attended prayers (without a coat) at St.\r\nMary’s church, and when he came out, seated himself on the pavement\r\nbeside the church, and wrote with chalk inside an oval border.\r\n\r\n  “Δε λίμῳ απολλυμαί.”--Lucam xv. 17.\r\n\r\n  “I perish with hunger.”\r\n\r\nHe was not long unnoticed, he tells me, by the scholars; some of whom\r\n“rigged him out,” and he left Oxford with 6_l._ 10_s._ in his pocket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Let us indulge the hope,” writes one who knows this man well, “that\r\nwhatever indiscretions may have brought a scholar, whom few behold\r\nwithout pity, or converse with without respect for his acquirements, to\r\nbe a street-seller, nevertheless his last days will be his best days,\r\nand that, as his talents are beyond dispute and his habits strictly\r\ntemperate, he may yet arise out of his degradation.”\r\n\r\nOf this gentleman’s history I give an account derived from the only\r\nauthentic source. It is, indeed, given in the words of the writer from\r\nwhom it was received.--\r\n\r\n“The _Reverend_ Mr. Shorthand” [his real name is of no\r\nconsequence--indeed, it would be contrary to the rule of this work\r\nto print it] “was born at Hackney, in the county of Middlesex, on\r\nGood Friday, the 15th of April, 1808; he is, therefore, now in his\r\n43rd year. Of his parents very little is known; he was brought up by\r\nguardians, who were ‘well to do,’ and who gave him every indulgence and\r\nevery good instruction and example. From the earliest dawn of reason\r\nhe manifested a strong predilection for the church; and, before he was\r\nseven years old, he had preached to an infant audience, read prayers\r\nover a dead animal, and performed certain mimic ceremonies of the\r\nchurch among his schoolfellows.\r\n\r\n“The directors of his youthful mind were strong Dissenters, of\r\nAntinomian sentiments. With half-a-dozen of the same denomination\r\nhe went, before he was thirteen, to the anniversary meeting of\r\nthe Countess of Huntingdon’s College, at Cheshunt. Here, with a\r\ncongregation of about forty persons, composed of the students and a few\r\nstrangers, he adjourned, while the parsons were dining at the ‘Green\r\nDragon,’ to the College Chapel, where, with closed doors, the future\r\nproprietor of the ‘penny short-hand’ delivered his first public sermon.\r\n\r\n“Before he was quite fourteen, the stenographic card-seller was\r\napprenticed to a draper in or near Smithfield. In this position he\r\nremained only a few months, when the indentures were cancelled by\r\nmutual consent, and he resumed his studies, first at his native place,\r\nand afterwards as a day-scholar at the Charterhouse. He was now\r\nsixteen, and it was deemed high time for him to settle to some useful\r\ncalling. He became a junior clerk in the office of a stock-broker,\r\nand afterwards amanuensis to an ‘M.D.,’ who encouraged his thirst\r\nfor learning, and gave him much leisure and many opportunities for\r\nimprovement. While in this position he obtained two small prizes in\r\nthe state lottery, gave up his situation, and went to Cambridge with\r\na private tutor. As economy was never any part of his character, he\r\nthere ‘overrun the constable,’ and to prevent,” he says, “any constable\r\nrunning after him. He decamped in the middle of the night, and came to\r\nLondon by a waggon--all his property consisting of a Greek Prayer-book,\r\nDodd’s Beauties of Shakspere, two shirts, and two half-crowns.\r\n\r\n“At this crisis a famous and worthy clergyman, forty years resident in\r\nHackney (the Rev. H. H. N----, lately deceased), had issued from the\r\npress certain strictures against the Society for promoting Christianity\r\namong the Jews. The short-hand seller wrote an appendix to this work,\r\nunder the title of the ‘Church in Danger.’ He took it to Mr. N----,\r\nwho praised the performance and submitted to the publication. The\r\nimpression cast off was limited, and the result unprofitable. It had,\r\nhowever, one favourable issue; it led to the engagement of its author\r\nas private and travelling tutor to the children of the celebrated Lady\r\nS----, who, though (for adultery) separated from her husband, retained\r\nthe exclusive custody of her offspring. While in this employment, my\r\ninformant resided chiefly at Clifton, sometimes in Bath, and sometimes\r\non her ladyship’s family property in Derbyshire. While here, he took\r\ndeacon’s orders, and became a popular preacher. In whatever virtues\r\nhe might be deficient, his charities, at least, were unbounded. This\r\nprofusion ill suited a limited income, and _a forgery_ was the first\r\nstep to suspension, disgrace, and poverty. In 1832 he married; the\r\nunion was not felicitous.\r\n\r\n“About this date my informant relates, that under disguise and\r\nchange of name he supplied the pulpits of several episcopal chapels\r\nin Scotland with that which was most acceptable to them. Unable to\r\nmaintain a _locus standi_ in connexion with the Protestant church, he\r\nmade a virtue of necessity, and avowed himself a seceder. In this new\r\ndisguise he travelled and lectured, proving to a demonstration (always\r\npecuniary) that ‘the Church of England was the hospital of Incurables.’\r\n\r\n“Always in delicate health, he found continued journeys inconvenient.\r\nThe oversight of a home missionary station, comprising five or six\r\nvillages, was advertised; the card-seller was the successful candidate,\r\nand for several years performed Divine service four times every Sunday,\r\nand opened and taught _gratuitously_ a school for the children of the\r\npoor. Here report says he was much beloved, and here he ought to have\r\nremained; but with that restlessness of spirit which is so marked\r\na characteristic of the class to which he now belongs, he thought\r\notherwise, and removed to a similar sphere of labour near Edinburgh.\r\nThe town, containing a population of 14,000, was visited to a dreadful\r\nextent with the pestilence of cholera. The future street-seller (to his\r\nhonour be it spoken) was the only one among eight or ten ministers who\r\nwas not afraid of the contagion. He visited many hundreds of cases,\r\nand, it is credibly asserted, added medicine, food, and nursing to\r\nhis spiritual consolations. The people of his charge here embraced\r\nthe Irving heresy; and unable, as he says, to determine the sense of\r\n‘the unknown tongues,’ he resigned his charge, and returned to London\r\nin 1837. After living some time upon his money, books, and clothes,\r\ntill all was expended, he tried his hand at the ‘begging-letter\r\ntrade.’ About this time, the card-seller declares that a man, also\r\nfrom Scotland, and of similar history and personal appearance, lodged\r\nwith him at a house in the Mint, and stole his coat, and with it\r\nhis official and other papers. This person had been either a city\r\nmissionary or scripture-reader, having been dismissed for intemperance.\r\nThe street card-seller states that he has ‘suffered much persecution\r\nfrom the officers of the Mendicity Society, and in the opinion of the\r\npublic, by the blending of his own history with that of the man who\r\nrobbed him.’ Be the truth as it may, or let his past faults have been\r\never so glaring, still it furnishes no present reason why he should be\r\nmaltreated in the streets, where he is _now_ striving for an honest\r\nliving. Since the card-seller’s return to London, he has been _five_\r\ntimes elected and re-elected to a temporary engagement in the Hebrew\r\nSchool, Goodman’s-fields; so that, at the worst, his habits of life\r\ncannot be _very_ outrageous.”\r\n\r\nThe “pomps and vanities of this wicked world,” have, according to his\r\nown account, had very little share in the experience of the short-hand\r\nparson. He states, and there is no reason for doubting him, that he\r\n_never witnessed any sort of public amusement in his life_; that he\r\nwas a hard student when he was young, and now keeps no company, living\r\nmuch in retirement. He “attends the ministry,” he says, “of the Rev.\r\nRobert Montgomery,--reads the daily lessons at home, and receives the\r\ncommunion twice every month at the early service in Westminster Abbey.”\r\n\r\nOf course these are matters that appear utterly inconsistent with his\r\npresent mode of life. One well-known peculiarity of this extraordinary\r\ncharacter is his almost idolatrous love of children, to whom, if he\r\n“makes a good Saturday night,” he is very liberal on his way home. This\r\nis, perhaps, his “ruling passion” (an acquaintance of his, without\r\nknowing why I inquired, fully confirmed this account); and it displays\r\nitself sometimes in strong emotion, of which the following anecdote may\r\nbe cited as an instance:--One of his favourite spots for stenographic\r\ndemonstration is the corner of Playhouse-yard, close to the _Times_\r\noffice. Directly opposite lives a tobacconist, who has a young family.\r\nOne of his little girls used to stand and listen to him; to her he was\r\nso strongly attached, that when he heard of her death (he had missed\r\nher several weeks), he went home much affected, and did not return to\r\nthe spot for many months. At the death of the notorious Dr. Dillon, the\r\ncard-seller offered himself to the congregation as a successor; they,\r\nhowever, declined the overture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SELLERS OF RACE CARDS AND LISTS.\r\n\r\nThis trade is not carried on in town; but at the neighbouring races of\r\nEpsom and Ascot Heath, and, though less numerously, at Goodwood, it is\r\npursued by persons concerned in the street paper-trade of London.\r\n\r\nAt Epsom I may state that the race-card sale is in the hands of two\r\nclasses (the paper or sheet-lists sale being carried on by the same\r\nparties)--viz. those who confine themselves to “working” the races, and\r\nthose who only resort to such work occasionally. The first-mentioned\r\nsellers usually live in the country, and the second in town.\r\n\r\nBetween these two classes, there is rather a strong distinction. The\r\ncountry race-card sellers are not unfrequently “sporting characters.”\r\nThe town professor of the same calling feels little interest in the\r\nintrigues or great “events” of the turf. Of the country traders in this\r\nline some act also as touters, or touts; they are for the most part\r\nmen, who having been in some capacity or other, connected with racing\r\nor with race-horses, and having fallen from their position or lost\r\ntheir employment, resort to the selling of race-cards as one means of\r\na livelihood, and to touting, or watching race-horses, and reporting\r\nanything concerning them to those interested, as another means. These\r\nmen, I am assured, usually “make a book” (a record and calculation of\r\ntheir bets) with grooms, or such gentlemen’s servants, as will bet with\r\nthem, and sometimes one with another.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious of the race-card selling fraternity is known as\r\nCaptain Carrot. He is the successor, I am told, of Gentleman Jerry,\r\nwho was killed some time back at Goodwood races--having been run over.\r\nGentleman Jerry’s attire, twenty-five to thirty-five years ago, was an\r\nexaggeration of what was then accounted a gentleman’s style. He wore a\r\nlight snuff-coloured coat, a “washing” waistcoat of any colour, cloth\r\ntrowsers, usually the same colour as his coat, and a white, or yellow\r\nwhite, and ample cravat of many folds. His successor wears a military\r\nuniform, always with a scarlet coat, Hessian boots, an old umbrella,\r\nand a tin eye-glass. Upon the card-sellers, however, who confine their\r\ntraffic to races, I need not dwell, but proceed to the metropolitan\r\ndealers, who are often patterers when in town.\r\n\r\nIt is common, for the smarter traders in these cards to be liberal of\r\ntitles, especially to those whom they address on the race-ground. “This\r\nis the sort of style, sir,” said one race-card-seller to me, “and it\r\ntells best with cockneys from their shops. ‘Ah, my lord. I hope your\r\nlordship’s well. I’ve backed your horse, my lord. He’ll win, he’ll win.\r\nCard, my lord, correct card, only 6_d._ I’ll drink your lordship’s\r\nhealth after the race.’ Perhaps this here ‘my lord,’ may be a barber,\r\nyou see, sir, and never had so much as a donkey in his life, and he\r\nforks out a bob; but before he can get his change, there always _is_\r\nsomebody or other to call for a man like me from a little distance,\r\nso I’m forced to run off and cry, ‘Coming, sir, coming. Coming, your\r\nhonour, coming.’”\r\n\r\nThe mass of these sellers, however, content themselves with the\r\ncustomary cry: “Here’s Dorling’s Correct Card of the Races.--Names,\r\nweights, and colours of the Riders.--Length of Bridle, and Weight of\r\nSaddle.”\r\n\r\nOne intelligent man computed that there were 500 men, women, and\r\nchildren, of all descriptions of street-callings, who on a “Derby day”\r\nleft London for Epsom. Another considered that there could not be fewer\r\nthan 600, at the very lowest calculation. Of these, I am informed, the\r\nfemale sellers may number something short of a twentieth part from\r\nLondon, while a twelfth of the whole number of regular street-sellers\r\nattending the races vend at the races cards. But card-selling is often\r\na cloak, for the females--and especially those connected with men\r\nwho depend solely on the races--vend improper publications (usually\r\nat 6_d._), making the sale of cards or lists a pretext for the more\r\nprofitable traffic.\r\n\r\nIf a man sell from ten to twelve dozen cards on the “Derby day,” it is\r\naccounted “a good day;” and so is the sale of three-fourths of that\r\nquantity on the Oaks day. On the other, or “off” days, 2_s._ is an\r\naverage earning.\r\n\r\nThe cards are all bought of Mr. Dorling, the printer, at 2_s._ 6_d._\r\na dozen. The price asked is always 6_d._ each. “But those fourpenny\r\nbits,” said one card-seller, “is the ruination of every thing. And\r\nnow that they say that the threepenny bits is coming in more, things\r\nwill be wuss and wuss.” The lists vary from 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nthe dozen, according to size. To clear 10_s._ and 8_s._ on the two\r\ngreat days is accounted “tidy doings,” but that is earned only by\r\nthose who devote themselves to the sale of the race-cards, which all\r\nthe sellers do not. Some, for instance, are ballad-singers, who sell\r\ncards immediately before a race comes off, as at that time they could\r\nobtain no auditory for their melodies. Ascot-heath races, I am told,\r\nare rather better for the card seller than Epsom, as “there’s more of\r\nthe nobs there,” and fewer of the London vendors of cards. The sale of\r\nthe “lists” is less than one-eighth that of the sale of cards. They\r\nare chiefly “return lists,” (lists with a specification of the winning\r\nhorses, &c., “returned” as they acquitted themselves in each race), and\r\nare sold in the evening, or immediately after the conclusion of the\r\n“sport,” for the purpose of being posted or kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GELATINE, OF ENGRAVED, AND OF PLAYING CARDS,\r\n&C.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other cards, the sale of which is carried on in the\r\nstreets; of these, the principal traffic has lately been in “gelatines”\r\n(gelatine cards). Those in the greatest demand contain representations\r\nof the Crystal Palace, the outlines of the structure being given in\r\ngold delineation on the deep purple, or mulberry, of the smooth and\r\nshining gelatine. These cards are sold in blank envelopes, for the\r\nconvenience of posting them as a present to a country friend; or of\r\nkeeping them unsoiled, if they are retained as a memento of a visit to\r\nso memorable a building. The principal sale was on Sunday mornings,\r\nin Hyde Park, and to the visitors who employed that day to enjoy the\r\nsight of the “palace.” But on the second Sunday in February--as well\r\nas my informant could recollect, for almost all street-traders will\r\ntell you, if not in the same words as one patterer used, that their\r\nrecollections are “not worth an old button without a neck”--the police\r\n“put down” the sale of these Exhibition cards in the Park, as well as\r\nthat of cakes, tarts, gingerbread, and such like dainties. This was a\r\nbitter disappointment to a host of street-sellers, who looked forward\r\nvery sanguinely to the profits they might realise when the Great\r\nExhibition was in full operation, and augured ill to their prospects\r\nfrom this interference. I am inclined to think, that, on this occasion,\r\nthe feelings of animosity entertained by the card-sellers towards the\r\npolice and the authorities were even bitterer than I have described as\r\naffecting the costermongers. “Why,” said one man, “when I couldn’t be\r\nlet sell my cards, I thrust my hands into my empty pockets, and went\r\namong the crowd near the Great Exhibition place to look about me. There\r\nwas plenty of ladies and gentlemen--say about 12 o’clock at Sunday\r\nnoon, and as many as could be. Plenty of ’em had nice paper bags of\r\nbiscuits, or cakes, that, of course, they’d bought that morning at a\r\npastrycook’s, and they handed ’em to their party. Some had newspapers\r\nthey was reading--about the Exhibition, I dare say--papers which was\r\nbought, and, perhaps, was printed that very blessed morning; but for us\r\nto offer to earn a crust then--oh, it’s agen the law. In course it is.”\r\n\r\nSome of the gelatine cards contain pieces of poetry, in letters\r\nof gold, always--at least, I could hear of no exceptions--of a\r\nreligious or sentimental character. “A Hymn,” “The Child’s Prayer,”\r\n“The Christian’s Hope,” “To Eliza,” “To a Daisy,” “Forget-me-not,”\r\nand “Affection’s Tribute,” were among the titles. Some contained\r\nlove-verses, and might be used for valentines, and some a sentimental\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nIn the open-air sale, nearly all the traffic was in “Exhibition\r\ngelatines,” and the great bulk were sold in and near Hyde Park. For two\r\nor three months, from as soon as the glass palace had been sufficiently\r\nelevated to command public attention, there were daily, I am told, 20\r\npersons selling those cards in the Park and its vicinity, and more than\r\ntwice that number on Sundays. One man told me, that, on one fine bright\r\nSunday, the sale being principally in the morning, he had sold 10\r\ndozen, with a profit of about 5_s._ On week-days three dozen was a good\r\nsale; but on wet, cold, or foggy days, none at all could be disposed\r\nof. If, therefore, we take as an average the sale of two dozen daily\r\nper each individual, and three dozen on a Sunday, we find that 180_l._\r\nwas expended on street-sold “gelatines.” The price to the retailer is\r\n5_d._ a dozen, with 1_d._ or 1-1/4_d._ for a dozen of the larger-sized\r\nenvelopes, so leaving the usual profit--cent. per cent. The sellers\r\nwere not a distinct class, but in the hands of the less enterprising\r\nof the paper-workers or patterers. The “poetry gelatines” were hardly\r\noffered at all in the streets, except by a few women and children, with\r\nwhom it was a pretext for begging.\r\n\r\nOf “engraved” Exhibition-cards, sold under similar circumstances, there\r\nmight be one third as many sold as of the gelatines, or an expenditure\r\nof 60_l._\r\n\r\nThe sale of playing-cards is only for a brief interval. It is most\r\nbrisk for a couple of weeks before Christmas, and is hardly ever\r\nattempted in any season but the winter. The price varies from 1_d._\r\nto 6_d._, but very rarely 6_d._; and seldom more than 3_d._ the pack.\r\nThe sellers for the most part announce their wares as “New cards.\r\nNew playing-cards. Two-pence a pack.” This subjects the sellers (the\r\ncards being unstamped) to a penalty of 10_l._, a matter of which the\r\nstreet-traders know and care nothing; but there is no penalty on the\r\nsale of second-hand cards. The best of the cards are generally sold by\r\nthe street-sellers to the landlords of the public-houses and beer-shops\r\nwhere the customers are fond of a “hand at cribbage,” a “cut-in at\r\nwhist,” or a “game at all fours,” or “all fives.” A man whose business\r\nled him to public-houses told me that for some years he had not\r\nobserved any other games to be played there, but he had heard an old\r\ntailor say that in his youth, fifty years ago, “put” was a common\r\npublic-house game. The cheaper cards are frequently imperfect packs.\r\nIf there be the full number of fifty-two, some perhaps are duplicates,\r\nand others are consequently wanting. If there be an ace of spades, it\r\nis unaccompanied by those flourishes which in the duly stamped cards\r\nset off the announcement, “Duty, One Shilling;” and sometimes a blank\r\ncard supplies its place. The smaller shop-keepers usually prefer to\r\nsell playing-cards with a piece cut off each corner, so as to give\r\nthem the character of being second-hand; but the street-sellers prefer\r\nvending them without this precaution. The cards--which are made up from\r\nthe waste and spoiled cards of the makers--are bought chiefly, by the\r\nretailers, at the “swag shops.”\r\n\r\nPlaying cards are more frequently sold with other articles--such as\r\nalmanacks--than otherwise. From the information I obtained, it appears\r\nthat if twenty dozen packs of cards are sold daily for fourteen days,\r\nit is about the quantity, but rather within it. The calculation\r\nwas formed on the supposition that there might be twenty street\r\nplaying-card sellers, each disposing (allowing for the hinderances of\r\nbad weather, &c.), of one dozen packs daily. Taking the average price\r\nat 3_d._ a pack, we find an outlay of 42_l._ The sale used to be far\r\nmore considerable and at higher prices, and was “often a good spec. on\r\na country round.”\r\n\r\nThere is still another description of cards sold in the streets of\r\nLondon; viz., conversation-cards; but the quantity disposed of is so\r\ntrifling as to require no special comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF STATIONERY.\r\n\r\nOf this body of street-traders there are two descriptions, the\r\nitinerant and the “pitching.” There are some also who unite the two\r\nqualities, so far as that they move a short distance, perhaps 200\r\nyards, along a thoroughfare, but preserve the same locality.\r\n\r\nOf the itinerant again, there are some who, on an evening, and more\r\nespecially a Saturday evening, take a stand in a street-market, and\r\npursue their regular “rounds” the other portions of the day.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant trader carries a tray, and in no few cases, as respects\r\nthe “display” of his wares, emulates the tradesman’s zeal in “dressing”\r\na window temptingly. The tray most in use is painted, or mahogany, with\r\n“ledges,” front and sides; or, as one man described it, “an upright\r\nfour-inch bordering, to keep things in their places.” The back of the\r\ntray, which rests against the bearer’s breast, is about twelve inches\r\nhigh. Narrow pink tapes are generally attached to the “ledges” and\r\nback, within which are “slipped” the articles for sale. At the bottom\r\nof the tray are often divisions, in which are deposited steel pens,\r\nwafers, wax, pencils, pen-holders, and, as one stationer expressed it,\r\n“packable things that you can’t get much show out of.” One man--who\r\nrather plumed himself on being a thorough master of his trade--said to\r\nme: “It’s a grand point to display, sir. Now, just take it in this way.\r\nSuppose you yourself, sir, lived in my round. Werry good. You hear me\r\ncry as I’m a approaching your door, and suppose you was a customer, you\r\nsays to yourself: ‘Here’s Penny-a-quire,’ as I’m called oft enough. And\r\nI’ll soon be with you, and I gives a extra emphasis at a customer’s\r\ndoor. Werry good, you buys the note. _As_ you buys the note, you gives\r\na look over my tray, and then you says, ‘O, I want some steel pens,\r\nand is your ink good?’ and you buys some. But for the ‘display,’ you’d\r\nhave sent to the shopkeeper’s, and I should have lost custom, ’cause it\r\nwouldn’t have struck you.”[12]\r\n\r\nThe articles more regularly sold by the street-sellers of stationery\r\nare note-paper, letter-paper, envelopes, steel pens, pen-holders,\r\nsealing-wax, wafers, black-lead pencils, ink in stonebottles,\r\nmemorandum-books, almanacks, and valentines. Occasionally, they sell\r\nIndia-rubber, slate-pencil, slates, copy-books, story-books, and\r\narithmetical tables.\r\n\r\nThe stationery is purchased, for the most part, in Budge-row and\r\nDrury-lane. The half-quires (sold at 1_d._) contain, generally, 10\r\nsheets; if the paper, however, be of superior quality, only 8 sheets.\r\nIn the paper-warehouses it is known as “outsides,” with no more than\r\n10 sheets to the half quire, the price varying from 4_s._ to 6_s._ the\r\nream (20 quires); or, if bought by weight, from 7_d._ to 9_d._ the\r\npound. The envelopes are sold (wholesale) at from 6_d._ to 15_d._ the\r\ndozen; the higher-priced being adhesive, and with impressions--now,\r\ngenerally, the Crystal Palace--on the place of the seal. The commoner\r\nare retailed in the streets at 12, and the better at 6, a penny.\r\nSometimes “a job-lot,” soiled, is picked up by the street-stationer\r\nat 4_d._ a pound. The sealing, a pound, retailed at 1/2_d._ each; the\r\n“flat” wax, however, is 1_s._ 4_d._ per lb., containing from 30 to 36\r\nsticks, retailed at 1_d._ each. Wafers (at the same swag shops) are\r\n3_d._ or 4_d._ the lb.--in small boxes, 9_d._ the gross; ink, 4-1/2_d._\r\nor 5_d._ the dozen bottles; pencils, 7_d._ to 8_s._ a gross; and steel\r\npens from 4_d._ (waste) to 3_s._ a gross; but the street-stationers do\r\nnot go beyond 2_s._ the gross, which is for magnum bonums.\r\n\r\n[12] I may here observe that I have rarely heard tradesmen dealing in\r\nthe same wares as street-sellers, described by those street-sellers by\r\nany other term than that of “shopkeepers.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A STREET-STATIONER.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged man gave me the following account. He had pursued the\r\ntrade for upwards of twelve years. He was a stout, cosey-looking man,\r\nwearing a loose great coat. The back of his tray rested against his\r\ndouble-breasted waistcoat; the pattern of which had become rather\r\nindistinct, but which was buttoned tightly up to his chin, as if to\r\natone for the looseness of his coat. The corner of his mouth, toward\r\nhis left ear, was slightly drawn down, for he seemed in “crying” to\r\npitch his voice (so that it could be heard a street off) out of the\r\ncorner of his only partially-opened mouth.\r\n\r\n“Middlin’, sir,” he said, “times is middlin’ with me; they might be\r\nbetter, but then they might be worse. I can manage to live. The times\r\nis changed since I was first in the business. There wasn’t no ’velops\r\n(envelopes) then, and no note-paper--least I had none; but I made\r\nas good or a better living than I do now; a better indeed. When the\r\npenny-postage came in--I don’t mind the year, but I hadn’t been long in\r\nthe trade [it was in 1840]--I cried some of the postage ’velops. They\r\nwas big, figured things at first, with elephants and such like on them,\r\nand I called them at prime cost, if anything was bought with ’em. The\r\nvery first time, a p’liceman says, ‘You mustn’t sell them covers. What\r\nauthority have you to do it?’ ‘Why, the authority to earn a dinner,’\r\nsays I; but it was no go. Another peeler came up and said I wasn’t to\r\ncry them again, or he’d have me up; and so that spec. came to nothing.\r\nI sell to ladies and gentlemen, and to servant-maids, and mechanics,\r\nand their wives; and indeed all sorts of people. Some fine ladies,\r\nthat call me to the door on the sly, do behave very shabby. Why, there\r\nwas one who wanted five half-quire of note for 4_d._, and I told her\r\nI couldn’t afford it, and so she said ‘that she knew the world, and\r\nnever gave nobody the price they first asked.’ ‘If that’s it, ma’am,’\r\nsays I, ‘people that knows your plan can ’commodate you.’ That knowing\r\ncard of a lady, sir, as she reckons herself, had as much velvet to her\r\nbody--such a gown!--as would pay _my_ tailor’s bills for twenty year.\r\nBut I don’t employ a fashionable tailor, and can patch a bit myself,\r\nas I was two years with a saddler, and was set to work to make girths\r\nand horse-clothes. My master died, and all went wrong, and I had to\r\nturn out, without nobody to help me,--for I had no parents living;\r\nbut I was a strong young fellow of sixteen. I first tried to sell a\r\nfew pairs of girths, and a roller or two, to livery-stable keepers,\r\nand horse-dealers, and job-masters. But I was next to starving. They\r\nwouldn’t look at anything but what was good, and the stuff was too\r\nhigh, and the profit too little--for I couldn’t get regular prices, in\r\ncourse--and so I dropped it. There’s no men in the world so particular\r\nabout good things as them as is about vallyable horses. I’ve often\r\nthought if rich people cared half as much about poor men’s togs, that\r\nwas working for them for next to nothing, as they cared for their\r\nhorse-clothes, it would be a better world. I was dead beat at last; but\r\nI went down to Epsom and sold a few race-cards. I’d borrowed 1_s._ of\r\na groom to start with, and he wouldn’t take it back when I offered it;\r\nand that wax is bought at general warehouses, known as “swag shops”\r\n(of which I may speak hereafter), at 8_d._ the pound, there being 48\r\nround sticks in, was my beginning in the paper trade. I felt queer\r\nat first, and queerer when I wasn’t among horses, as at the races\r\nlike--but one get’s reconciled to anything, ’cept, to a man like me, a\r\nlow lodging-house. A stable’s a palace to it. I got into stationery at\r\nlast, and it’s respectable.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard people say how well they could read and write, and it was\r\nno good to them. It has been, and is still, a few pence to me; though\r\nI can only read and write middlin’. I write notes and letters for some\r\nas buys paper of me. Never anything in the beggin’ way--never. It\r\nwouldn’t do to have my name mixed up that way. I’ve often got extra\r\npennies for directing and doing up valentines in nice ’velops. Why, I\r\nspoke to a servant girl the other day; she was at the door, and says I,\r\n‘Any nice paper to-day, to answer your young man’s last love-letter,\r\nor to write home and ask your mother’s consent to your being wed next\r\nMonday week?’ That’s the way to get them to listen, sir. Well, I finds\r\nthat she can’t write, and so I offers to do it for a pint of beer, and\r\nshe to pay for paper of course. And then there was so many orders what\r\nto say. Her love to no end of aunts, and all sorts of messages and\r\ninquiries about all sorts of things; and when I’d heard enough to fill\r\na long ‘letter’ sheet, she calls me back and says, ‘I’m afraid I’ve\r\nforgot uncle Thomas.’ I makes it all short enough in the letter, sir.\r\n‘My kind love to all inquiring friends,’ takes in all uncle Thomases.\r\nI writes them when I gets a bite of dinner. Sometimes I posts them,\r\nif I’m paid beforehand; at other times I leaves them next time I pass\r\nthe door. There’s no mystery made about it. If a missus says, ‘What’s\r\nthat?’ I’ve heard a girl answer, ‘It’s a letter I’ve got written home,\r\nma’am. I haven’t time myself,’ or ‘I’m no scholar, ma’am.’ But that’s\r\nonly where I’m known. I don’t write one a week the year round--perhaps\r\nforty in a year. I charge 1_d._ or 2_d._, or if it’s a very poor body,\r\nand no gammon about it, nothing. Well, then, I think I never wrote a\r\nlove-letter. Women does that one for another, I think, when the young\r\nhousemaid can’t write as well as she can talk. I jokes some as I knows,\r\nand says I writes all sorts of letters but love-letters, and for them,\r\nyou see, says I, there’s wanted the best gilt edge, and a fancy ’velop,\r\nand a Dictionary. I take more for note and ’velops than anything else,\r\nbut far the most for note. Some has a sheet folded and fitted into a\r\n’velop when they buys, as they can’t fit it so well theirselves, they\r\nsay. Perhaps I make 2_s._ a day, take it all round. Some days I may\r\nmake as much as 3_s._ 6_d._; at others, ’specially wet days, not 1_s._\r\nBut I call mine a tidy round, and better than an average. I’ve only\r\nmyself, and pays 1_s._ 9_d._ a week for a tidy room, with a few of\r\nmy own sticks in it. I buy sometimes in Budge-row, and sometimes in\r\nDrury-lane. Very seldom at a swag-shop (Birmingham house), for I don’t\r\nlike them.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, I’ve heard, sir, that poor men like me ain’t to be allowed\r\nto sell anything in the Park at the Great Exhibition. How’s that, sir?”\r\nI told him I could give no information on the subject.\r\n\r\n“It’s likely enough to be true,” he resumed; “the nobs’ll want to\r\nkeep it all to theirselves. I read _Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper_ on a\r\nSunday, and what murders and robberies there is now! What will there\r\nbe when the Great Exhibition opens! for rogues is worst in a crowd,\r\nand they say they’ll be plenty come to London from all arts and parts?\r\nNever mind; if I can see anything better to do in a fair way at the\r\nExhibition, I’ll cut the streets.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps my earnings is half from working people and half from private\r\nhouses; that’s about it. But working people’s easiest satisfied.”\r\n\r\nI have given this man’s statement more fully than I should have thought\r\nnecessary, that I might include his account of letter-writing. The\r\nletter-writer was at one period a regular street-labourer in London,\r\nas he is now in some continental cities--Naples, for instance. The\r\nvocation in London seems in some respects to have fallen into the\r\nhands of the street-stationer, but the majority of letters written\r\nfor the uneducated--and their letter-receiving or answering is seldom\r\narduous--is done, I believe, by those who are rather vaguely but\r\nemphatically described as--“friends.”\r\n\r\nI am told that there are 120 street-stationers in London, a small\r\nmajority of whom may be itinerant, but chiefly on regular rounds. On a\r\nSunday morning, in such places as the Brill, are two or three men, but\r\nnot regularly, who sell stationery only on Sunday mornings. Taking the\r\nnumber, however, at 120, I am assured that their average profits may\r\nbe taken at 8_s._ weekly, each stationer. On note-paper of the best\r\nsort the profit is sometimes only 50 per cent.; but, take the trade\r\naltogether, we may calculate it at cent. per cent. (on some things it\r\nis higher); and we find 4,992_l._ yearly expended in street-stationery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A “REDUCED” GENTLEWOMAN, AND A “REDUCED” TRADESMAN, AS STREET-SELLERS\r\nOF STATIONERY.\r\n\r\nI now give two statements, which show the correctness of my conclusion,\r\nthat among the street-stationers were persons of education who had\r\nknown prosperity, and that, as a body, those engaged in this traffic\r\nwere a better class than the mass of the “paper-workers.” They are also\r\nhere cited as illustrations of the causes which lead, or rather force,\r\nmany to a street-life.\r\n\r\nThe first statement is that of a lady:--\r\n\r\n“My father,” she said, “was an officer in the army, and related to the\r\nPitt family. After his death, I supported myself by teaching music.\r\nI was considered very talented by my profession, both as teacher and\r\ncomposer.” (I may here interrupt the course of the narrative by\r\nsaying, that I myself have had printed proofs of the lady’s talents in\r\nthis branch of art.) “A few years ago, a painful and protracted illness\r\ntotally incapacitated me from following my profession; consequently,\r\nI became reduced to a state of great destitution. For many weeks I\r\nremained ill in my own room. I often, during that time, went without\r\nnourishment the day through. I might have gone into an hospital; but\r\nI seemed to dread it so much, that it was not until I was obliged to\r\ngive up my room that I could make up my mind to enter one. From that\r\ntime, until within a few weeks ago, I have been an inmate of several\r\nhospitals: the last I was in was the Convalescent Establishment at\r\nCarshalton. On my coming to London, I found I had to begin the world\r\nagain, as it were, in a very different manner from what I have been\r\naccustomed to. I had no head to teach--I felt that; and what to do\r\nI hardly knew. I had no home to go to, and not a halfpenny in the\r\nworld. I had heard of the House of Charity, in Soho-square, and, as a\r\nlast resource, I went there; but before I could have courage to ask\r\nadmittance, I got a woman to go in and see what kind of a place it\r\nwas--I seemed to fear it so much. I met with great kindness there,\r\nhowever; and, by the time I left, the care they had bestowed upon me\r\nhad restored my health in a measure, but not my head. The doctors\r\nadvised me to get some out-door occupation (I am always better in the\r\nopen air); but what to do I could not tell. At last I thought of a man\r\nI had known, who made fancy envelopes. I went to him, and asked him\r\nto allow me to go round to a few houses with some of them for a small\r\nper centage. This he did, and I am thereby enabled, by going along the\r\nstreets and calling to offer my envelopes at any likely house, just to\r\nlive. None but those who have suffered misfortunes (as I have done) can\r\ntell what my feelings were on first going to a house. I _could_ not go\r\nwhere I was known; I had not the courage, nor would my pride allow me.\r\nMy pupils had been very kind to me during my illnesses, but I could not\r\nbear the idea of going to them and offering articles for sale.\r\n\r\n“My fear of strangers is so great, that I tremble when I knock at a\r\ndoor--lest I should meet with an angry word. How few have any idea of\r\nthe privations and suffering that have been endured before a woman\r\n(brought up as I have been) can make up her mind to do as I am obliged\r\nto do! I am now endeavouring to raise a little money to take a room,\r\nand carry on the envelope business myself. I might do pretty well,\r\nI think; and, should my head get better, in time I might get pupils\r\nagain. At present I could not teach, the distressed state of my mind\r\nwould not allow me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tradesman’s statement he forwarded to me in writing, supplying me\r\nwith every facility to test the full accuracy of his assertions, which\r\nit is right I should add I have done, and found all as he has stated.\r\nI give the narrative in the writer’s words (and his narrative will be\r\nfound at once diffuse and minute), as a faithful representation of a\r\n“reduced” tradesman’s struggles, thoughts, and endurances, before being\r\nforced into the streets.\r\n\r\n“I was brought up,” he writes, “as a linen-draper. After filling every\r\nsituation as an assistant, both in the wholesale and retail trade, I\r\nwas for a considerable time in business. Endeavouring to save another\r\nfrom ruin, I advanced what little money I had at my banker’s, and\r\nbecame security for more, as I thought I saw my way clear. But a bond\r\nof judgment was hanging over the concern (kept back from me of course)\r\nand the result was, I lost my money to the amount of some hundreds,\r\nof which I have not recovered one pound. Since that time I have\r\nendeavoured to gain a livelihood as a town traveller. In 1845 I became\r\nvery much afflicted, and the affliction continued the greater part of\r\nthe following year. At one time I had fifteen wounds on my body, and\r\nlost the use of one side. I was reduced by bodily disease, as well as\r\nin circumstances. My wife went to reside among her friends, and I,\r\nafter my being an out-patient of Bartholomew’s Hospital went, through\r\nnecessity, to Clerkenwell Workhouse. When recovered, I made another\r\neffort to do something among my own trade, and thought, after about two\r\nyears struggle, I should recover in a measure my position. In August,\r\n1849, I sent for a few shillings-worth of light articles from London\r\n(being then at Dunstable). I received them, and sold one small part; I\r\nwent the following day to the next village nearer London. There I had a\r\nviolent attack of cholera; which once more defeated my plans, leaving\r\nme in a weak condition. I was obliged to seek the refuge of my parish,\r\nand consider that very harshly was I treated there. They refused me\r\nadmittance, and suffered me to walk the street two days and two nights.\r\nI had no use of my arm, was ill and disabled. About half-past seven on\r\nthe third night, a gentleman, hearing of my sufferings, knocked at the\r\ndoor of the Union, took me inside, and dared them to turn me thence.\r\nThis was in October, 1849. I lay on my bed there for seven weeks\r\nnearly, and a few days before Christmas-day the parish authorities\r\nbrought me before the Board, and turned me out, with one shilling\r\nand a loaf; one of the overseers telling me to go to h--ll and lodge\r\nanywhere. I came to lodge at the Model Lodging-house, King-street,\r\nDrury-lane; but being winter-time they were full. Although I remained\r\nthere in the day-time, I was obliged to sleep at another house. At this\r\ndomicile I saw how many ways there were of getting what the very poor\r\ncall a living, and various suggestions were offered. I was promised\r\na gift of 2_s._ 6_d._ by an individual, on a certain day,--but I had\r\nto live till that day, and many were the feelings of my mind, how to\r\ndispose of what might remain when I received the 2_s._ 6_d._, as I was\r\ngetting a little into debt. My debt, when paid, left me but 9-1/2_d._\r\nout of the 2_s._ 6_d._ to trade with. I had never hawked an article\r\nbefore that time; to stand the streets was terrible to my mind, and\r\nhow to invest this small sum sadly perplexed me. My mind was racked\r\nby painful anxiety; one moment almost desponding, the next finding\r\nso much sterling value in a shilling, that I saw in it the means of\r\nrescuing me from my degradation. Wanting many of the necessaries of\r\nlife, but without suitable attire for my own business, and still weak\r\nfrom illness, I made up my mind. On the afternoon of 2nd Jan., 1850, I\r\npurchased 1-1/2 doz. memorandum-books, of a stationer in Clerkenwell,\r\ntelling him my capital. I obtained the name of ‘Ninepence-halfpenny\r\nMan’ (the amount of my funds) at that shop. The next step was how to\r\ndispose of my books. I thought I would go round to some coffee and\r\npublic-houses, as I could not endure the streets. I went into one,\r\nwhere I was formerly known, and sold 6_d._-worth, and meeting a person\r\nwho was once in my own line, at another house, I sold 4_d._-worth more.\r\nThe first night, therefore, I got over well. The next day I did a\r\nlittle, but not so well, and I found out that what I had bought was not\r\nthe most ready sale. My returns that week were only 6_s._ 2_d._ I found\r\nI must have something different,--one thing would not do alone; so I\r\nbought a few childrens’ books and almanacks--sometimes going to market\r\nwith as little as seven farthings. I could not rise to anything better\r\nin the way of provisions during this time than dry toast and coffee, as\r\nthe rent must be looked to. I struggled on, hoping against hope. At one\r\nperiod I had a cold and lost my voice. Two or three wet days in a week\r\nmade me a bankrupt. If I denied myself food, to increase my stock, and\r\nwent out for a day or two to some near town, I found that with small\r\nstock and small returns I could not stem the tide.\r\n\r\n“I always avoided associating with any but those a step higher in the\r\ngrades of society--a circumstance that caused me not to know as much\r\nof the market for my cheap articles as I might have done. I am perhaps\r\nlooked on as rather an ‘aristocrat,’ as I am not often seen by the\r\nstreet-sellers at a stand. My difficulties have been of no ordinary\r\nkind; with a desire for more domestic comfort on one hand, and painful\r\nreflections from want of means on the other, I have had to call to my\r\naid all the philosophy I possess, to keep up a proper equilibrium,\r\nlest I should be tempted to anything derogatory or dishonest. I am\r\ndesirous of a rescue at the only time likely for it to take place with\r\nadvantage, as I am persuaded when persons continue long in a course\r\nthat endangers their principles and self-respect, a rescue becomes\r\nhopeless. Should I have one small start with health, the privations I\r\nhave undergone show not what comforts I have had, or may hope ever to\r\nhave, but what I can absolutely do without.\r\n\r\n“I found the first six months not quite so good as the latter; March\r\nand May being the worst. The entire amount taken from January 2nd to\r\nDecember 31st, 1850; was 28_l._ 10_s._ 6_d._,--an average of about\r\n11_s._ 4_d._ a week; say for cost of goods, 6_s._ per week; and\r\nrent, 1_s._ 9_d._; leaving me but 3_s._ 7_d._ clear for living. This\r\nstatement, sir, is strictly correct, as I do not get cent. per cent. on\r\nall the articles; and yet with so small a return I am not behind one\r\nsingle crown at the present time.\r\n\r\n“On New Year’s-day last, I had but the cost price of stock, 5_d._ Up to\r\nthe evening of February 10th, I have taken 2_l._ 19_s._ 8_d._;--having\r\npaid for goods, 1_l._ 10_s._ 5_d._; and for rent, 8_s._ 10_d._: leaving\r\nme 1_l._ 5_d._ to exist on during nearly six weeks. These facts and\r\nfigures show that without a little assistance it is impossible to rise;\r\nand remember this circumstance--I have had to walk on some occasions as\r\nmuch as twenty or twenty-two miles in a day. If those whom Providence\r\nhas blessed with a little more than their daily wants would only enter\r\ninto the conflicts of the really reduced person, they would not be half\r\nso niggardly in spending a few coppers for useful articles, at least,\r\nnor overbearing in their requirements as to bulk, when purchasing of\r\nthe itinerant vendor. Did they but reflect that they themselves might\r\nbe in the same condition, or some of their families, I am sure they\r\nwould not act as they do; for I would venture to say that the common\r\nstreet beggar does not get more rebuffs or insults than the educated\r\nand unfortunate reduced tradesmen in the streets. The past year has\r\nbeen one of the most trying and painful, yet I hope instructive,\r\nperiods of my existence, and one of which I trust I never shall see the\r\nlike again.”\r\n\r\nI subjoin one of the testimonies that have been furnished me, as to\r\nthis man’s character, and which I thought it right to procure before\r\ngiving publicity to the above statement. It is from a minister of the\r\ngospel--the street-seller’s father-in-law.\r\n\r\n “DEAR SIR,--I received a letter, last Tuesday, from Mr. Knight,\r\n intimating that he was requested by you to inquire into the character\r\n of Mr. J---- N----.\r\n\r\n “It is quite correct, as he states, that his wife is my daughter.\r\n They lived together several years in London; but eventually,\r\n notwithstanding her efforts in the millinery and straw-work, they\r\n became so reduced that their circumstances obliged my daughter to take\r\n her two little girls with herself to us.\r\n\r\n “This was in the summer, 1845. His wife and children have been of no\r\n expense to Mr. N. since that time. The sole cause of their separation\r\n was poverty.\r\n\r\n “I consider him to have acted imprudently in giving up his situation\r\n to depend on an income arising from a small capital; whereas, if\r\n he had kept in a place, whilst she attended to her own business,\r\n they might have gone on comfortably; and should they, through the\r\n interposition of a kind Providence, gain that position again, it is\r\n to be hoped that they will improve the circumstance to the honour and\r\n glory of the Author of all our mercies, and with gratitude to the\r\n instrument who may be raised up for their good.\r\n\r\n  “I am, dear Sir, respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n  “J. D.”\r\n\r\nOther vouchers have been received, and all equally satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF MEMORANDUM-BOOKS AND ALMANACKS.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum-books in demand in street-sale are used for weekly\r\n“rent-books.” The payment of the rent is entered by the landlord, and\r\nthe production of one of these books, showing a punctuality of payment,\r\nperhaps for years, is one of the best “references” that can be given\r\nby any one in search of a new lodging. They are bought also for the\r\nentrance of orders, and then of prices, in the trade at chandler’s\r\nshops, &c., where weekly or monthly accounts are run. All, or nearly\r\nall, the street-stationers sell memorandum-books, and in addition to\r\nthem, there may be, I am told, sometimes as many as fifty poor persons,\r\nincluding women and children, who sell memorandum-books with other\r\ntrifling articles, not necessarily stationery, but such things as\r\nstay-laces or tapes. If a man sell memorandum-books alone it is because\r\nhis means limit him to that stock, he being at the time, what I heard a\r\npatterer describe as, a “dry-bread cove.” The price is 6_d._ the dozen,\r\nor 9_d._ (with almanacks pasted inside the cover), and thirteen to the\r\ndozen. No more than 1_d._ is obtained in the streets for any kind of\r\nmemorandum-books.\r\n\r\nThe almanack street trade, I heard on all hands, had become a mere\r\nnothing. “What else can you expect, sir,” said one street-seller,\r\n“when so many publicans sends almanacks round, or gives them away to\r\ntheir customers; and when the slop tailors’ shilling-a-day men thrust\r\none into people’s hands at every corner? It was a capital trade once,\r\nbefore the duty was taken off--capital! The duty wasn’t in our way so\r\nmuch as in the shop-keepers’, though _they_ did a good deal on the sly\r\nin unstamped almanacks. Why of a night in October I’ve many a time\r\ncleared 5_s._ and more by selling in the public-houses almanacks at\r\n2_d._ and 3_d._ a-piece (they cost me 1_s._ and 1_s._ 2_d._ a dozen\r\nat that time). Anything that way, when Government’s done, has a ready\r\nsale; people enjoys it; and I suppose no man, as ever was, thinks it\r\nmuch harm to do a tax-gatherer! I don’t pay the income-tax myself\r\n(laughing). One evening I sold, just by Blackfriars-bridge, fourteen\r\ndozen of diamond almanacks to fit into hat-crowns. I was liable, in\r\ncourse, and ran a risk. I sold them mostly at 1_d._ a piece, but\r\nsometimes got 6_d._ for three. I cleared between 6_s._ and 7_s._ The\r\n‘diamonds’ cost me 8_d._ a dozen.”\r\n\r\nThe street almanack trade is now carried on by the same parties as I\r\nhave specified in my account of memorandum-books. Those sold are of any\r\ncheap kind, costing wholesale 6_d._ a dozen, but they are almost always\r\nannounced as “Moore’s.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF POCKET-BOOKS AND DIARIES.\r\n\r\nThe sale of pocket-books, in the streets, is not, I was told by\r\nseveral persons, “a living for a man now-a-days.” Ten years ago it was\r\ncommon to find men in the streets offering “half-crown pocket-books”\r\nfor 1_s._, and holding them open so as to display the engravings, if\r\nthere were any. The street-sale usually takes place in March, when the\r\ndemand for the regular trade has ceased, and the publishers dispose\r\nof their unsold stock. The trade is now, I am assured, only about a\r\ntenth of its former extent. The reason assigned for the decline is that\r\nalmanacks, diaries, &c., are so cheap that people look upon 1_s._ as\r\nan enormous price, even for a “beautiful morocco-bound pocket-book,”\r\nas the street-seller proclaims it. The binding is roan (a dressed\r\nsheep-skin, morocco being a goat-skin), an imitation of morocco, but\r\nthe pocket-books are really those which in the October preceding have\r\nbeen published in the regular way of trade. Some few of them may,\r\nhowever, have been damaged, and these are bought by the street-people\r\nas a “job lot,” and at a lower price than that paid in the regular\r\nway; which is 4_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._ 6_d._ the dozen, thirteen to the\r\ndozen. The “job lot” is sometimes bought for 2_s._ 6_d._ a dozen, and\r\nsold at 6_d._ each, or as low as 4_d._,--for street-sellers generally\r\nbewail their having often to come down to “fourpenny-bits, as they’re\r\ngoing so much now.” One man told me that he was four days last March in\r\nselling a dozen pocket-books, though the weather was not unfavourable,\r\nand that his profit was 5_s._ Engravings of the “fashions,” the same\r\nman told me, were “no go now.” Even poorly-dressed women (but they\r\nmight, he thought, be dress-makers) had said to him the last time he\r\ndisplayed a pocket-book with fashions--“They’re out now.” The principal\r\nsupplier of pocket-books, &c., to the street-trade is in Bride-lane,\r\nFleet-street. Commercial diaries are bought and sold at the same rate\r\nas pocket-books; but the sale becomes smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nI am informed that “last season” there were twenty men, all\r\nstreet-traders in “paper,” or “anything that was up,” at other times,\r\nselling pocket-books and diaries. For this trade Leicester-square is a\r\nfavourite place. Calculating, from the best data I can command, that\r\neach of those men took 15_s._ weekly for a month (half of it their\r\nprofit), we find 60_l._ expended in the streets in this purchase.\r\nLedgers are sometimes sold in the streets; but as the sale is more a\r\nhawker’s than a regular street-seller’s, an account of the traffic is\r\nnot required by my present subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SONGS.\r\n\r\nThese street-traffickers, with the exception, in a great degree,\r\nof the “pinners-up,” are of the same class, but their callings are\r\ndiversified. There are long song-sellers, ballad-sellers (who are\r\ngenerally singers of the ballads they vend, unless they are old and\r\ninfirm, and offer ballads instead of begging), chaunters, pinners-up,\r\nand song-book-sellers. The three first-mentioned classes I have already\r\ndescribed in their connection with the patterers; and I now proceed to\r\ndeal with the two last-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe “pinners-up” (whom I have mentioned as an exceptional body), are\r\nthe men and women--the women being nearly a third of the number of\r\nthe men--who sell songs which they have “pinned” to a sort of screen\r\nor large board, or have attached them, in any convenient way, to a\r\nblank wall; and they differ from the other song-sellers, inasmuch as\r\nthat they are not at all connected with patter, and have generally been\r\nmechanics, porters, or servants, and reduced to struggle for a living\r\nas “pinners-up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET “PINNERS-UP,” OR WALL SONG-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThese street-traders, when I gave an account of them in the winter\r\nof 1849, were not 50 in number; they are now, I learn, about 30. One\r\ninformant counted 28, and thought “that was nearly all.”\r\n\r\nI have, in my account of street song-sellers, described the character\r\nof the class of pinners-up. Among the best-accustomed stands are\r\nthose in Tottenham-court Road, the New-road, the City-road, near the\r\nVinegar-works, the Westminster-road, and in Shoreditch, near the\r\nEastern Counties Station. One of the best-known of the pinners-up was a\r\nstout old man, wearing a great-coat in all weathers, who “pinned-up” in\r\nan alley leading from Whitefriars-street to the Temple, but now thrown\r\ninto an open street. He had old books for sale on a stall, in addition\r\nto his ballads, and every morning was seen reading the newspaper,\r\nborrowed from a neighbouring public-house which he “used,” for he was\r\na keen politician. “He would quarrel with any one,” said a person who\r\nthen resided in the neighbourhood--an account confirmed to me at the\r\npublic-house in question--“mostly about politics, or about the books\r\nand songs he sold. Why, sir, I’ve talked to him many a time, and have\r\nstood looking through his books; and if a person came up and said, ‘Oh,\r\nBurn’s Works, 1_s._; I can’t understand him,’--then the old boy would\r\nabuse him for a fool! Suppose another came and said--for I’ve noticed\r\nit myself--‘Ah! Burns--he was a poet!’ that didn’t pass; for the jolly\r\nold pinner-up would say, ‘Well, now, I don’t know about that.’ In my\r\nopinion, he cared nothing about this side or that--this notion or the\r\nopposite--but he liked to _shine_.” The old man was carried off in the\r\nprevalence of the cholera in 1849.\r\n\r\nAt the period I have specified, I received the following statement from\r\na man who at that time pinned-up by Harewood-place, Oxford-street:\r\n\r\n“I’m forty-nine,” he said. “I’ve no children, thank God, but a\r\ndaughter, who is eighteen, and no incumbrance to me, as she is in\r\na ‘house of business;’ and as she has been there nine years, her\r\ncharacter can’t be so very bad. (This was said proudly.) I worked\r\ntwenty-two years with a great sculptor as a marble polisher, and\r\nbesides that, I used to run errands for him, and was a sort of porter,\r\nlike, to him. I couldn’t get any work, because he hadn’t no more\r\nmarble-work to do; so nine or ten years back I went into this line. I\r\nknew a man what done well in it--but times was better then--and that\r\nput it into my head. It cost me 2_l._ 10_s._ to stock my stall, and\r\nget all together comfortable; for I started with old books as well as\r\nsongs. I got leave to stand here from the landlord. I sell ballads and\r\nmanuscript music (beautifully done these music sheets were), which is\r\n‘transposed’ (so he worded it) from the nigger songs. There’s two does\r\nthem for me. They’re transposed for the violin. One that does them is a\r\nmusicianer, who plays outside public-houses, but I think his daughter\r\ndoes most of it. I sell my songs at a halfpenny,--and, when I can get\r\nit, a penny a piece. Do I yarn a pound a week? Lor’ bless you, no. Nor\r\n15_s._, nor 12_s._ I don’t yarn, one week with another, not 10_s._,\r\nsometimes not 5_s._ My wife don’t yarn nothing. She used to go out\r\ncharing, but she can’t now. I am at my stall at nine in the morning,\r\nand sometimes I have walked five or six miles to buy my ‘pubs’ before\r\nthat. I stop till ten at night oft enough. The wet days is the ruin of\r\nus; and I think wet days increases. [This was said on a rainy day.]\r\nSuch a day as yesterday now I didn’t take, not make,--but I didn’t\r\n_take_ what would pay for a pint of beer and a bit of bread and cheese.\r\nMy rent’s 2_s._ 3_d._ a week for one room, and I’ve got my own bits of\r\nsticks there. I’ve always kept _them_, thank God!”\r\n\r\nGenerally, these dealers know little of the songs they sell,--taking\r\nthe printer’s word, when they purchase, as to “what was going.” The\r\nmost popular comic songs (among this class I heard the word _song_\r\nused far more frequently than _ballad_) are not sold so abundantly as\r\nothers,--because, I was told, boys soon picked _them_ up by heart,\r\nhearing them so often, and so did not buy them. Neither was there a\r\ngreat demand for nigger songs, nor for “flash ditties,” but for such\r\nproductions as “A Life on the Ocean Wave,” “I’m Afloat,” “There’s a\r\nGood Time coming,” “Farewell to the Mountain,” &c., &c. Three-fourths\r\nof the customers of these traders, one man assured me, were boys.\r\n\r\nIndecent songs are not sold by the pinners-up. One man of whom I made\r\ninquiries was quite indignant that I should even think it necessary to\r\nask such questions. The “songs” cost the pinners-up, generally, 2_d._ a\r\ndozen, sometimes 2-1/2_d._, and sometimes less than 2_d._, according to\r\nthe quality of the paper and the demand.\r\n\r\nOn fine summer days the wall song-sellers take 2_s._ on an average. On\r\nshort wintry days they may not take half so much, and on very foggy or\r\nrainy days they take nothing at all. Their ballads are of the same sort\r\nas those I proceed to describe under especial heads, and I have shown\r\nwhat are of readiest sale. Reckoning that each pinner-up, thirty in\r\nnumber, now takes 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly (7_s._ being the profit), we find\r\nthat 780 guineas are yearly expended in London streets, in the ballads\r\nof the pinners-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ANCIENT AND MODERN STREET BALLAD MINSTRELSY.\r\n\r\nMr. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of the People of England,”\r\nshows, as do other authorities, that in the reigns subsequent to the\r\nNorman Conquest the minstrels “were permitted to perform in the rich\r\nmonasteries, and in the mansions of the nobility, which they frequently\r\nvisited in large parties, and especially upon occasions of festivity.\r\nThey entered the castles without the least ceremony, rarely waiting for\r\nany previous invitation, and there exhibited their performances for the\r\nentertainment of the lord of the mansion and his guests. They were, it\r\nseems, admitted without any difficulty, and handsomely rewarded for the\r\nexertion of their talents.”\r\n\r\nOf the truth of this statement all contemporary history is a\r\ncorroboration. The minstrels then, indeed, constituted the theatre, the\r\nopera, and the concert of the powerful and wealthy. They were decried\r\nby some of the clergy of that day,--as are popular performers and opera\r\nsingers (occasionally) by some zealous divine in our own era. John of\r\nSalisbury stigmatizes minstrels as “ministers of the devil.”\r\n\r\n“The large gratuities collected by these artists,” the same antiquarian\r\nwriter further says, “not only occasioned great numbers to join their\r\nfraternity, but also induced many idle and dissipated persons to assume\r\nthe characters of minstrels, to the disgrace of the profession. These\r\nevils became at last so notorious, that in the reign of King Edward\r\nII. it was thought necessary to restrain them by a public edict, which\r\nsufficiently explains the nature of the grievance. It states, that many\r\nindolent persons, under the colour of minstrelsy, intruded themselves\r\ninto the residences of the wealthy, where they had both meat and drink,\r\nbut were not contented without the addition of large gifts from the\r\nhouseholder. To restrain this abuse, the mandate ordains, that no\r\nperson should resort to the houses of prelates, earls, or barons, to\r\neat, or to drink, who was not a professed minstrel; nor more than three\r\nor four minstrels of honour at most in one day (meaning, I presume, the\r\nking’s minstrels of honour and those retained by the nobility), except\r\nthey came by invitation from the lord of the house.”\r\n\r\nThe themes of the minstrels were the triumphs, victories, pageants, and\r\ngreat events of the day; commingled with the praise, or the satire of\r\nindividuals, as the humour of the patron or of the audience might be\r\ngratified. It is stated that Longchamp, the favourite and justiciary of\r\nRichard Cœur-de-lion, not only engaged poets to make songs and poems in\r\nhis, Bishop Longchamp’s, praise, but the best singers and minstrels to\r\nsing them in the public streets!\r\n\r\nIn the ninth year of the reign of Edward IV. another royal edict was\r\nissued, as little favourable to the minstrels as the one I have given\r\nan account of; and those functionaries seem to have gradually fallen\r\nin the estimation of the public, and to have been contemned by the\r\nlaw, down to the statute of Elizabeth, already alluded to, subjecting\r\nthem to the same treatment as rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars. A\r\nwriter of the period (1589) represents the (still-styled) minstrels,\r\nsinging “ballads and small popular musickes” for the amusement of boys\r\nand others “that passe by them in the streete.” It is related also that\r\ntheir “matters were for the most part stories of old time; as the tale\r\nof Sir Topas, Bevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwick, Adam Bell, and\r\nClymme of the Clough, and such other old romances or historical rhymes,\r\nmade purposely for the recreation of the common people at Christmas\r\ndinners and bride ales, and in tavernes and alehouses, and such other\r\nplaces of base resort.”\r\n\r\nThese “stories of old time” are now valuable as affording illustrations\r\nof ancient manners, and have been not unfertile as subjects of\r\nantiquarian annotation.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of the “Norman Minstrels,” Mr. Strutt says: “It is very\r\ncertain that the poet, the songster, and the musician were frequently\r\nunited in the same person.”\r\n\r\nFrom this historical sketch it appears evident that the ballad-singer\r\nand seller of to-day is the sole descendant, or remains, of the\r\nminstrel of old, as regards the business of the streets; he is, indeed,\r\nthe minstrel having lost caste, and being driven to play cheap.\r\n\r\nThe themes of the minstrels were wars, and victories, and revolutions;\r\nso of the modern man of street ballads. If the minstrel celebrated with\r\nharp and voice the unhorsings, the broken bones, the deaths, the dust,\r\nthe blood, and all the glory and circumstance of a tournament,--so does\r\nthe ballad-seller, with voice and fiddle, glorify the feelings, the\r\nbroken bones, the blood, the deaths, and all the glory and circumstance\r\nof a prize-fight. The minstrel did not scoff at the madness which\r\nprevailed in the lists, nor does the ballad-singer at the brutality\r\nwhich rules in the ring. The minstrels had their dirges for departed\r\ngreatness; the ballad-singer, like old Allan Bane, also “pours his\r\nwailing o’er the dead”--for are there not the street “helegies” on\r\nall departed greatness? In the bestowal of flattery or even of praise\r\nthe modern minstrel is far less liberal than was his prototype; but\r\nthe laudation was, in the good old times, very often “paid for” by\r\nthe person whom it was sung to honour. Were the same measure applied\r\nto the ballad-singer and writer of to-day, there can be no reason\r\nto doubt that it would be attended with the same result. In his\r\nsatire the modern has somewhat of an advantage over his predecessor.\r\nThe minstrel not rarely received a “largesse” to satirize some one\r\nobnoxious to a rival, or to a disappointed man. The ballad-singer (or\r\nchaunter, for these remarks apply with equal force to both of these\r\nstreet-professionals), is seldom hired to abuse. I was told, indeed, by\r\na clever chaunter, that he had been sent lately by a strange gentleman\r\nto sing a song--which he and his mate (a patterer) happened at the\r\ntime to be working--in front of a neighbouring house. The song was on\r\nthe rogueries of the turf; and the “move” had a doubly advantageous\r\neffect. “One gentleman, you see, sir, gave us 1_s._ to go and sing; and\r\nafore we’d well finished the chorus, somebody sent us from the house\r\nanother 1_s._ to go away agin.” I believe this to be the only way in\r\nwhich the satire of a ballad-singer is rewarded, otherwise than by sale\r\nto his usual class of customers in the streets or the public-houses.\r\nThe ancient professors of street minstrelsy unquestionably played and\r\nsung satirical lays, depending for their remuneration on the liberality\r\nof their out-of-door audience; so is it precisely with the modern. The\r\nminstrel played both singly and with his fellows; the ballad-singer\r\n“works” both alone (but not frequently) and with his “mates” or his\r\n“school.”\r\n\r\nIn the persons of some of these modern street professionals, as I have\r\nshown and shall further show, are united the functions of “the poet,\r\nthe songster, and the musician.” So in the days of yore. There are now\r\nfemale ballad-singers; there were female minstrels, or glee-women. The\r\nlays which were poured forth in our streets and taverns some centuries\r\nback, either for the regalement of a miscellaneous assemblage, or of a\r\nselect few, were sometimes of an immoral tendency. Such, it cannot be\r\ndenied, is the case in our more enlightened days at our Cyder-cellars,\r\nCoal-holes, Penny Gaffs, and such like places. Rarely, however, are\r\nsuch things sung in the streets of London; but sometimes at country\r\nfairs and races.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the analogy between the two ages of these promoters of\r\nstreet enjoyment does not hold. The minstrel’s garb was distinctive.\r\nIt was not always the short laced tunic, tight trousers, and russet\r\nboots, with a well plumed cap,--which seems to be the modern notion\r\nof this tuneful itinerant. The king’s and queen’s minstrels wore the\r\nroyal livery, but so altered as to have removed from its appearance\r\nwhat might seem menial. The minstrels of the great barons also assumed\r\ntheir patron’s liveries, with the like qualification. A minstrel of\r\nthe highest class might wear “a fayre gowne of cloth of gold,” or a\r\nmilitary dress, or a “tawnie coat,” or a foreign costume, or even an\r\necclesiastical garb,--and some of them went so far as to shave their\r\ncrowns, the better to resemble monks. Of course they were imitated\r\nby their inferiors. The minstrel, then, wore a particular dress; the\r\nballad-singer of the present day wears no particular dress. During the\r\nterrors of the reign of Henry VIII., and after the Reformation, a large\r\nbody of the minstrels fell into meanness of attire; and in that respect\r\nthe modern ballad-singer _is_ analogous.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that I have all along spoken--except when the\r\ndescription is necessarily general--of the _street_, or itinerant,\r\nminstrel of old. The highest professors of the art were poets and\r\ncomposers, men often of genius, learning, and gravity, and were no\r\nmore to be ranked with the mass of those I have been describing than\r\nis Alfred Tennyson with any Smithfield scribbler and bawler of some\r\nNewgate “Copy of Verses.”\r\n\r\nHow long “Sir Topas” and the other “old stories” continued to be\r\nsung in the streets there are no means of ascertaining. But there\r\nare old songs, as I ascertained from an intelligent and experienced\r\nstreet-singer, still occasionally heard in the open air, but more in\r\nthe country than the metropolis. Among those still heard, however\r\nrarely, are the Earl of Dorset’s song, written on the night before a\r\nnaval engagement with the Dutch, in 1665:\r\n\r\n  “To all you ladies now on land,\r\n    We men at sea indite.”\r\n\r\nI give the titles of the others, not chronologically, but as they\r\noccurred to my informant’s recollection--“A Cobbler there was, and he\r\nliv’d in a Stall”--Parnell’s song of “My Days have been so wond’rous\r\nFree,” now sung in the streets to the tune of “Gramachree.” A song (of\r\nwhich I could not procure a copy, but my informant had lately heard it\r\nin the street) about the Cock-lane Ghost--\r\n\r\n  “Now ponder well, you parents dear\r\n    The words which I shall write;\r\n  A doleful story you shall hear,\r\n    In time brought forth to light.”\r\n\r\nthe “Children in the Wood” and “Chevy-chase.” Concerning this old\r\nditty one man said to me: “Yes, sir, I’ve sung it at odd times and\r\nnot long ago in the north of England, and I’ve been asked whereabouts\r\nChevy-chase lay, but I never learned.”\r\n\r\n  “In Scarlet towne, where I was borne,\r\n    There was a faire maid dwellin’,\r\n  Made every youth crye, Well-awaye!\r\n    Her name was Barbara Allen.”\r\n\r\n“Barbara Allen’s selling yet,” I was told. “Gilderoy was a Bonnie Boy,”\r\nis another song yet sung occasionally in the streets.\r\n\r\n“The ballad,” says a writer on the subject, “may be considered as the\r\nnative species of poetry of this country. It very exactly answers the\r\nidea formerly given of original poetry, being the rude uncultivated\r\nverse in which the popular tale of the time was recorded. As our\r\nancestors partook of the fierce warlike character of the northern\r\nnations, the subjects of their poetry would chiefly consist of the\r\nmartial exploits of their heroes, and the military events of national\r\nhistory, deeply tinctured with that passion for the marvellous, and\r\nthat superstitious credulity, which always attend a state of ignorance\r\nand barbarism. Many of the ancient ballads have been transmitted to the\r\npresent times, and in them the character of the nation displays itself\r\nin striking colours.”\r\n\r\nThe “Ballads on a Subject,” of which I shall proceed to treat, are\r\ncertainly “the rude uncultivated verse in which the popular tale of the\r\ntimes is recorded,” and what may be the character of the nation as\r\ndisplayed in them I leave to the reader’s judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STREET “BALLADS ON A SUBJECT.”\r\n\r\nThere is a class of ballads which may with perfect propriety be called\r\n_street_ ballads, as they are written by street authors for street\r\nsinging (or chaunting) and street sale. These effusions, however,\r\nare known in the trade by a title appropriate enough--“Ballads on a\r\nSubject.” The most successful workers in this branch of the profession,\r\nare the men I have already described among the patterers and chaunters.\r\n\r\nThe “Ballads on a Subject” are always on a political, criminal, or\r\nexciting public event, or one that has interested the public, and\r\nthe celerity with which one of them is written, and then sung in the\r\nstreets, is in the spirit of “these railroad times.” After any great\r\nevent, “a ballad on the subject” is often enough written, printed, and\r\nsung in the street, in little more than an hour. Such was the case\r\nwith a song “in honour,” it was announced, “of Lord John Russell’s\r\nresignation.” Of course there is no time for either the correction\r\nof the rhymes or of the press; but this is regarded as of little\r\nconsequence--while an early “start” with a new topic is of great\r\nconsequence, I am assured; “yes, indeed, both for the sake of meals and\r\nrents.” If, however, the songs were ever so carefully revised, their\r\nsale would not be greater.\r\n\r\nI need not treat this branch of our street literature at any great\r\nlength, as specimens of the “Ballad on a Subject” will be found in many\r\nof the preceding statements of paper-workers.\r\n\r\nIt will have struck the reader that all the street lays quoted as\r\npopular have a sort of burthen or jingle at the end of each verse.\r\nI was corrected, however, by a street chaunter for speaking of this\r\nburthen as a jingle. “It’s a chorus, sir,” he said. “In a proper ballad\r\non a subject, there’s often twelve verses, none of them under eight\r\nlines,--and there’s a four-line chorus to every verse; and, if it’s the\r\nright sort, it’ll sell the ballad.” I was told, on all hands, that it\r\nwas not the words that ever “made a ballad, but the subject; and, more\r\nthan the subject,--the chorus; and, far more than either,--_the tune_!”\r\nIndeed, many of the street-singers of ballads on a subject have as\r\nsupreme a contempt for words as can be felt by any modern composer. To\r\nselect a tune for a ballad, however, is a matter of deep deliberation.\r\nTo adapt the ballad to a tune too common or popular is injudicious; for\r\nthen, I was told, any one can sing it--boys and all. To select a more\r\nelaborate and less-known air, however appropriate, may not be pleasing\r\nto some of the members of “the school” of ballad-singers, who may feel\r\nit to be beyond their vocal powers; neither may it be relished by the\r\ncritical in street song, whose approving criticism induces them to\r\npurchase as well as to admire.\r\n\r\nThe license enjoyed by the court jesters, and, in some respects, by\r\nthe minstrels of old, is certainly enjoyed, undiminished, by the\r\nstreet-writers and singers of ballads on a subject. They are unsparing\r\nsatirists, who, with a rare impartiality, lash all classes and all\r\ncreeds, as well as any individual. One man, upon whose information I\r\ncan rely, told me that, eleven years ago, he himself had “worked,” in\r\ntown and country, 23 different songs at the same period and on the same\r\nsubject--the marriage of the Queen. They all “sold,”--but the most\r\nprofitable was one “as sung by Prince Albert in character.” It was to\r\nthe air of the “Dusty Miller;” and “it was good,” said the ballad-man,\r\n“because we could easily dress up to the character given to Albert.” I\r\nquote a verse:\r\n\r\n  “Here I am in rags\r\n    From the land of All-dirt,\r\n  To marry England’s Queen,\r\n    And my name it is Prince Albert.”\r\n\r\n“And what’s more, sir,” continued my informant, “not very long after\r\nthe honeymoon, the Duchess of L---- drove up in her carriage to the\r\nprinter’s, and bought all the songs in honour of Victoria’s wedding,\r\nand gave a sovereign for them and wouldn’t take the change. It was a\r\nduchess. Why I’m sure about it--though I can’t say whether it were the\r\nDuchess of L---- or S----; for didn’t the printer, like an honest man,\r\nwhen he’d stopped the price of the papers, hand over to us chaps the\r\nbalance to drink, and _didn’t_ we drink it! There can’t be a mistake\r\nabout _that_.”\r\n\r\nOf street ballads on political subjects, or upon themes which have\r\ninterested the whole general public, I need not cite additional\r\ninstances. There are, however, other subjects, which, though not\r\nregarded as of great interest by the whole body of the people are still\r\neventful among certain classes, and for them the street author and\r\nballad-singer cater.\r\n\r\nI first give a specimen of a ballad on a Theatrical Subject. The best\r\nI find, in a large collection of these street effusions, is entitled\r\n“Jenny Lind and Poet B.” After describing how Mr. Bunn “flew to Sweden”\r\nand engaged Miss Lind, the poet proceeds,--the tune being “Lucy Long”:\r\n\r\n  “After Jenny sign’d the paper,\r\n  She repented what she’d done,\r\n  And said she must have been a cake,\r\n  To be tempted by A. Bunn.\r\n  The English tongue she must decline,\r\n  It was such awkward stuff,\r\n  And we find ’mongst our darling dames,\r\n  That one tongue’s quite enough.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n      So take your time Miss Jenny,\r\n      Oh, take your time Miss Lind,\r\n      You’re only to raise your voice,\r\n      John Bull, will raise the wind.\r\n\r\n  Says Alfred in the public eye,\r\n  My name you shan’t degrade,\r\n  So birds that can and won’t sing\r\n  Why in course they must be made\r\n  This put Miss Jenny’s pipe out,\r\n  Says Bunn your tricks I see,\r\n  Altho’ you are a Nightingale,\r\n  You shan’t play larks with me.\r\n\r\n  The Poet said he’d seek the law,\r\n  No chance away he’d throw;\r\n  Says Jenny if you think I’ll come,\r\n  You’ll find it is no go!\r\n  When a bird-catcher named ‘Lummy’\r\n  With independence big,\r\n  Pounced down upon the Nightingale,\r\n  And with her hopp’d the twig!”\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think--though I know it to be an unusual case--that\r\nin this theatrical ballad the street poet was what is tenderly called\r\na “plagiarist.” I was assured by a chaunter that it was written by\r\na street author,--but probably the chaunter was himself in error or\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nNext, there is the Ballad on a Civic Subject. In the old times the Lord\r\nMayor had his laureate. This writer, known as “poet to the City of\r\nLondon,” eulogised all lord mayors, and glorified all civic pageants.\r\nThat of the 9th November, especially, “lived in Settle’s numbers, one\r\nday more,”--but Elkanah Settle was the last of such scribes. After his\r\ndeath, the city eschewed a poet. The office has now descended to the\r\nstreet bard, who annually celebrates the great ceremony. I cite two\r\nstanzas and the chorus from the latest of these civic Odes:\r\n\r\n  “Now Farncombe’s out and Musgrove’s in,\r\n    And grand is his position,\r\n  Because he will be made a king,\r\n    At the Hyde Park Exhibition;\r\n  A feast he’ll order at Guildhall,\r\n    For hypocrites and sinners,\r\n  And he has sent Jack Forester to Rome,\r\n    To invite the Pope to dinner!\r\n\r\n  A day like this we never saw,\r\n    The truth I am confessing,\r\n  Batty’s astonishing menagerie,\r\n    Is in the great procession;\r\n  There’s lions, tigers, bears and wolves,\r\n    To please each smiling feature,\r\n  And elephants in harness drawing\r\n    Drury Lane Theatre!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    “It is not as it used to be,\r\n      Cut on so gay and thrifty,\r\n    The funny Lord Mayor’s Show to see,\r\n      In eighteen hundred and fifty.”\r\n\r\nThere is, beside the descriptions of ballads above cited, the Ballad\r\nLocal. One of these is headed the “Queer Doings in Leather-lane,” and\r\nis on a subject concerning which street-sellers generally express\r\nthemselves strongly--Sunday trading. The endeavour to stop street\r\ntrading (generally) in Leather-lane, with its injurious results to\r\nthe shopkeepers, has been already mentioned. The ballad on this local\r\nsubject presents a personality now, happily, almost confined to the\r\nstreet writers:\r\n\r\n  “A rummy saintly lot is there,\r\n    A domineering crew,\r\n  A Butcher, and a Baker,\r\n    And an Undertaker too,\r\n  Besides a cove who deals in wood,\r\n    And makes his bundles small,\r\n  And looks as black on Sunday\r\n    As the Undertaker’s pall.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  You must not buy, you must not sell,\r\n    Oh! is it not a shame?\r\n  It is a shocking place to dwell,\r\n    About sweet Leather Lane.\r\n\r\n  The Butcher does not like to hear\r\n    His neighbours holloa, buy!\r\n  Although he on the Sunday\r\n    Sells a little on the sly;\r\n  And the Coffin Maker struts along\r\n    Just like the great Lord Mayor,\r\n  To bury folks on Sundays,\r\n    Instead of going to prayers.”\r\n\r\nThere are yet three themes of these street songs, of which, though they\r\nhave been alluded to, no specimens have been given. I now supply them.\r\nThe first is the election ballad. I quote two stanzas from “Middlesex\r\nand Victory! or, Grosvenor and Osborne for ever!”\r\n\r\n  “Now Osborne is the man\r\n    To struggle for your rights,\r\n  He will vote against the Bishops,\r\n    You know, both day and night,\r\n  He will strive to crush the Poor Law Bill,\r\n    And that with all his might,\r\n  And he will never give his vote\r\n    To part a man from his wife.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  Then cheer Osborne and Lord Grosvenor,\r\n    Cheer them with three times three,\r\n  For they beat the soldier, Tommy Wood,\r\n    And gained the victory.\r\n\r\n    I have not forgot Lord Grosvenor,\r\n      Who nobly stood the test,\r\n    For the electors of great Middlesex\r\n      I know he’ll do his best;\r\n    He will pull old Nosey o’er the coals,\r\n      And lay him on his back,\r\n    And he swears that little Bob’s head\r\n      He will shove into a rat trap.”\r\n\r\nThen come the “elegies.” Of three of these I cite the opening stanza.\r\nThat on the “Death of Queen Adelaide” has for an illustration a figure\r\nof Britannia leaning on her shield, with the “Muse of History,” (as I\r\npresume from her attributes,) at Britannia’s feet. In the distance is\r\nthe setting sun:\r\n\r\n  “Old England may weep, her bright hopes are fled,\r\n    The friend of the poor is no more;\r\n  For Adelaide now is numbered with the dead,\r\n    And her loss we shall sadly deplore.\r\n  For though noble her birth, and high was her station\r\n    The poor of this nation will miss her,\r\n  For their wants she relieved without ostentation,\r\n    But now she is gone, God bless her!\r\n        God bless her! God bless her!\r\n        But now she is gone, God bless her!”\r\n\r\nThe elegy on the “Death of the Right Honourable Sir Robert Peel, Bart.\r\nM.P.,” is set off with a very fair portrait of that statesman.\r\n\r\n  “Britannia! Britannia! what makes thee complain,\r\n    O why so in sorrow relenting,\r\n  Old England is lost, we are borne down in pain,\r\n    And the nation in grief is lamenting,\r\n  That excellent man--the pride of the land,\r\n    Whom every virtue possessed him,\r\n  Is gone to that Home, from whence no one returns,\r\n    Our dear friend, Sir Robert, God rest him.”\r\n\r\nThe verses which bewail the “Death of H. R. H. the Duke of Cambridge,”\r\nand which are adorned with the same illustration as those upon Queen\r\nAdelaide, begin\r\n\r\n  “Oh! death, thou art severe, and never seems contented,\r\n  Prince Adolphus Frederick is summoned away,\r\n  The death of Royal Cambridge in sorrow lamented,\r\n  Like the good Sir Robert Peel, he no longer could stay;\r\n  His virtues were good, and noble was his actions,\r\n  His presence at all places caused much attraction,\r\n  Britannia for her loss is driven to distraction,\r\n    Royal Cambridge, we’ll behold thee no more!”\r\n\r\nThe third class of street-ballads relates to “fires.” The one I quote,\r\n“On the Awful Fire at B. Caunt’s, in St. Martin’s-lane,” is preceded by\r\nan engraving of a lady and a cavalier, the lady pointing to a column\r\nsurmounted by an urn. I again give the first stanza:\r\n\r\n  “I will unfold a tale of sorrow,\r\n    List, you tender parents dear,\r\n  It will thrill each breast with horror,\r\n    When the dreadful tale you hear.\r\n  Early on last Wednesday morning,\r\n    A raging fire as we may see,\r\n  Did occur, most sad and awful,\r\n    Between the hours of two and three.”\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent stanza are four lines, not without some rough pathos,\r\nand adapted to move the feelings of a street audience. The writer is\r\nalluding to the grief of the parents who had lost two children by a\r\nterrible death:\r\n\r\n  “No more their smiles they’ll be beholding,\r\n    No more their pretty faces see,\r\n  No more to their bosoms will they fold them,\r\n    Oh! what must their feelings be.”\r\n\r\nI find no difference in style between the ballads on a subject of\r\nto-day, and the oldest which I could obtain a sight of, which were sung\r\nin the present generation--except that these poems now begin far less\r\nfrequently with what at one time was as common as an invocation to the\r\nMuse--the invitation to good Christians to attend to the singer. One on\r\nthe Sloanes, however, opens in the old fashion:\r\n\r\n  “Come all good Christians and give attention,\r\n    Unto these lines I will unfold,\r\n  With heartfelt feelings to you I’ll mention,\r\n    I’m sure ’twill make your blood run cold.”\r\n\r\nI now conclude this account of street-ballads on a subject with\r\ntwo verses from one on the subject of “The Glorious Fight for the\r\nChampionship of England.” The celebration of these once-popular\r\nencounters is, as I have already stated, one of the points in which the\r\nmodern ballad-man emulates his ancient brother minstrel:\r\n\r\n  “On the ninth day of September,\r\n    Eighteen hundred and forty five,\r\n  From London down to Nottingham\r\n    The roads were all alive;\r\n  Oh! such a sight was never seen,\r\n    Believe me it is so,\r\n  Tens of thousands went to see the fight,\r\n    With Caunt and Bendigo.\r\n\r\n  And near to Newport Pagnell,\r\n    Those men did strip so fine,\r\n  Ben Caunt stood six feet two and a half,\r\n    And Bendigo five foot nine;\r\n  Ben Caunt, a giant did appear,\r\n    And made the claret flow,\r\n  And he seemed fully determined\r\n    Soon to conquer Bendigo.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    With their hit away and slash away,\r\n      So manfully you see,\r\n    Ben Caunt has lost and Bendigo\r\n      Has gained the victory.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET POETS AND AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n_Authorship_, for street sale, is chiefly confined to the production\r\nof verse, which, whatever be its nature, is known through the trade\r\nas “ballads.” Two distinctions, indeed, are recognised--“Ballads” and\r\n“Ballads on a Subject.” The last-mentioned is, as I have said and\r\nshown, the publication which relates to any specific event; national or\r\nlocal, criminal or merely extraordinary, true or false. Under the head\r\n“Ballads,” the street-sellers class all that does not come under the\r\ndescription of “Ballads on a Subject.”\r\n\r\nThe same street authors--now six in number--compose indiscriminately\r\nany description of ballad, including the copy of verses I have\r\nshown to be required as a necessary part of all histories or trials\r\nof criminals. When the printer has determined upon a “Sorrowful\r\nLamentation,” he sends to a poet for a copy of verses, which is\r\npromptly supplied. The payment I have already mentioned--1_s._; but\r\nsometimes, if the printer (and publisher) like the verses, he “throws a\r\npenny or two over;” and sometimes also, in case of a great sale, there\r\nis the same over-sum.\r\n\r\nFewer ballads, I was assured, than was the case ten or twelve years\r\nago, are now written expressly for street sale or street minstrelsy.\r\n“They come to the printer, for nothing, from the concert-room. He has\r\nonly to buy a ‘Ross’ or a ‘Sharp’” [song-books] “for 1_d._, and there’s\r\na lot of ’em; so, in course, a publisher ain’t a-going to give a bob,\r\nif he can be served for a farthing, just by buying a song-book.”\r\n\r\nAnother man, himself not a “regular poet,” but a little concerned in\r\nstreet productions, said to me, with great earnestness: “Now look at\r\nthis, sir, and I hope you’ll just say, sir, as I tell you. You’ve\r\ngiven the public a deal of information about men like me, and some of\r\nour chaps abuses you for it like mad; but I say it’s all right, for\r\nit’s all true. Now you’ll have learned, sir, or, any way, you will\r\nlearn, that there’s songs sung in the streets, and sometimes in some\r\ntap-rooms, that isn’t decent, and relates to nothing but wickedness.\r\nThere wasn’t a few of those songs once written for the streets,\r\nstraight away, and a great sale they had, I know--but far better at\r\ncountry fairs and races than in town. Since the singing-houses--I\r\ndon’t mean where you pay to go to a concert, no! but such as your\r\nCyder-cellars, and your night-houses, where there’s lords, and\r\ngentlemen, and city swells, and young men up from the colleges--since\r\nthese places has been up so flourishing, there hasn’t, I do believe,\r\nbeen _one_ such song written by one of our poets. They all come from\r\nthe places where the lords, and genelmen, and collegians is capital\r\ncustomers; and they never was a worse sort of ballads than now. In\r\ncourse those houses is licensed, and perticler respectable, or it\r\nwouldn’t be allowed; and if I was to go to the foot of the bridge, sir\r\n(Westminster-bridge), and chaunt any such songs, and my mate should\r\nsell them, why we should very soon be taking reg’lar exercise on\r\nColonel Chesterton’s everlasting staircase. We has a great respect for\r\nthe law--O, certainly!”\r\n\r\nParodies on any very popular song, which used to be prepared expressly\r\nfor street trade, are now, in like manner, derived from the night-house\r\nor the concert-room; but not entirely so. The parody “Cab, cab,\r\ncab!” which was heard in almost every street, was originated in a\r\nconcert-room.\r\n\r\nThe ballads which have lately been written, and published expressly for\r\nthe street sale, and have proved the most successful, are parodies or\r\nimitations of “The Gay Cavalier.” One street ballad, commencing in the\r\nfollowing words, was, I am told, greatly admired, both in the streets\r\nand the public-houses.\r\n\r\n  “’Twas a dark foggy night,\r\n  And the moon gave no light,\r\n    And the stars were all put in the shade:\r\n  When leary Joe Scott,\r\n  Dealt in ‘Donovan’s hot’\r\n    Said he’d go to court his fair maid.”\r\n\r\nI now give three stanzas of “The Way to Live Happy Together,”--a ballad\r\nsaid to have been written expressly for street sale. Its popularity is\r\nanything but discreditable to the street-buyers:\r\n\r\n  “From the time of this world’s first formation\r\n    You will find it has been the plan,\r\n  In every country and nation,\r\n    That woman was formed to please man;\r\n  And man for to love and protect them,\r\n    And shield them from the frowns of the world,\r\n  Through the smooth paths of life to direct them,\r\n    And he who would do less is a churl.\r\n\r\n            Then listen to me!\r\n  If you would live happy together,\r\n    As you steer through the troubles of life,\r\n  Depend that this world’s greatest treasure,\r\n    Is a kind and a good-tempered wife.\r\n\r\n  Some men will ill-use a good woman,\r\n    And say all they do turns out wrong,\r\n  But as I mean to offend no one,\r\n    You’ll find faults to both sides belong;\r\n  But if both were to look at the bright side,\r\n    And each other’s minds cease to pain,\r\n  They would find they have looked at the right side,\r\n    For all would be summer again.\r\n\r\n            Then listen to me!\r\n  If you would live happy together, &c.\r\n\r\n  Married women, don’t gossip or tattle,\r\n    Remember it oft stirs up strife,\r\n  But attend to your soft children’s soft prattle,\r\n    And the duties of mother and wife.\r\n  And men, if you need recreation,\r\n    With selfish companions don’t roam,\r\n  Who might lead you to sad degradation,\r\n    But think of your comforts at home.\r\n\r\n            Then listen to me!\r\n  If you would live happy together, &c.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all as one, sir,” was the answer of a man whom I questioned on\r\nthe subject; “it’s the same poet; and the same tip for any ballad. No\r\nmore nor a bob for nothing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS OF STREET-ART--No. III.\r\n\r\nMR.

They were of every class. I specify a few,\r\nto show the nature of the collection (not including ballads on a\r\nsubject): “Ye Banks and Braes o’ Bonnie Doun,” with (on the same sheet)\r\n“The Merry Fiddler,” (an indecent song)--“There’s a good Time coming,\r\nBoys,” “Nix, my Dolly,” “The Girls of ----shire,” (which of course is\r\navailable for any county)--“Widow Mahoney,” “Remember the Glories of\r\nBrian the Brave,” “Clementina Clemmins,” “Lucy Long,” “Erin Go Bragh,”\r\n“Christmas in 1850,” “The Death of Nelson,” “The Life and Adventures of\r\nJemmy Sweet,” “The Young May Moon,” “Hail to the Tyrol,” “He was sich a\r\nLushy Cove,” &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI may here mention--but a fuller notice may be necessary when I treat\r\nof street art--that some of these ballads have an “illustration” always\r\nat the top of the column. “The Heart that can Feel for Another” is\r\nillustrated by a gaunt and savage-looking lion. “The Amorous Waterman\r\nof St. John’s Wood,” presents a very short, obese, and bow-legged\r\ngrocer, in top-boots, standing at his door, while a lady in a huge\r\nbonnet is “taking a sight at him,” to the evident satisfaction of a\r\n“baked ’tater” man. “Rosin the Beau” is heralded by the rising sun.\r\n“The Poachers” has a cut of the Royal Exchange above the title. “The\r\nMiller’s Ditty” is illustrated by a perfect dandy, of the slimmest\r\nand straightest fashion; and “When I was first Breeched,” by an\r\nengraving of a Highlander. Many of the ballads, however have engravings\r\nappropriate enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A STREET AUTHOR, OR POET.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the present number of street authors, as I\r\nmost frequently heard them styled, though they write only verses. I\r\ncalled upon one on the recommendation of a neighbouring tradesman, of\r\nwhom I made some inquiries. He could not tell me the number of the\r\nhouse in the court where the man lived, but said I had only to inquire\r\nfor the Tinker, or the Poet, and any one would tell me.\r\n\r\nI found the poor poet, who bears a good character, on a sick bed; he\r\nwas suffering, and had long been suffering, from abscesses. He was\r\napparently about forty-five, with the sunken eyes, hollow cheeks,\r\nand, not pale but thick and rather sallow complexion, which indicate\r\nill-health and scant food. He spoke quietly, and expressed resignation.\r\nHis room was not very small, and was furnished in the way usual among\r\nthe very poor, but there were a few old pictures over the mantel-piece.\r\nHis eldest boy, a lad of thirteen or fourteen, was making dog-chains;\r\nat which he earned a shilling or two, sometimes 2_s._ 6_d._, by sale in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n“I was born at Newcastle-under-Lyne,” the man said, “but was brought to\r\nLondon when, I believe, I was only three months old. I was very fond\r\nof reading poems, in my youth, as soon as I could read and understand\r\nalmost. Yes, very likely, sir; perhaps it was that put it into my head\r\nto write them afterwards. I was taught wire-working, and jobbing,\r\nand was brought up to hawking wire-work in the streets, and all over\r\nEngland and Wales. It was never a very good trade--just a living.\r\nMany and many a weary mile we’ve travelled together,--I mean, my wife\r\nand I have: and we’ve sometimes been benighted, and had to wander or\r\nrest about until morning. It wasn’t that we hadn’t money to pay for a\r\nlodging, but we couldn’t get one. We lost count of the days sometimes\r\nin wild parts; but if we did lose count, or thought we had, I could\r\nalways tell when it was Sunday morning by the look of nature; there\r\nwas a mystery and a beauty about it as told me. I was very fond of\r\nGoldsmith’s poetry always. I can repeat ‘Edwin and Emma’ now. No, sir;\r\nI never read the ‘Vicar of Wakefield.’ I found ‘Edwin and Emma’ in a\r\nbook called the ‘Speaker.’ I often thought of it in travelling through\r\nsome parts of the country.\r\n\r\n“Above fourteen years ago I tried to make a shilling or two by selling\r\nmy verses. I’d written plenty before, but made nothing by them. Indeed\r\nI never tried. The first song I ever sold was to a concert-room\r\nmanager. The next I sold had great success. It was called the ‘Demon of\r\nthe Sea,’ and was to the tune of ‘The Brave Old Oak.’ Do I remember how\r\nit began? Yes, sir, I remember every word of it. It began:\r\n\r\n      Unfurl the sails,\r\n      We’ve easy gales;\r\n  And helmsman steer aright.\r\n  Hoist the grim death’s head--\r\n      The Pirate’s head--\r\n  For a vessel heaves in sight!\r\n\r\nThat song was written for a concert-room, but it was soon in the\r\nstreets, and ran a whole winter. I got only 1_s._ for it. Then I\r\nwrote the ‘Pirate of the Isles,’ and other ballads of that sort. The\r\nconcert-rooms pay no better than the printers for the streets.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the best thing I ever wrote was the ‘Husband’s Dream.’ I’m\r\nvery sorry indeed that I can’t offer you copies of some of my ballads,\r\nbut I haven’t a single copy myself of any of them, not one, and I dare\r\nsay I’ve written a thousand in my time, and most of them were printed.\r\nI believe 10,000 were sold of the ‘Husband’s Dream.’ It begins:\r\n\r\n  O Dermot, you look healthy now,\r\n    Your dress is neat and clean;\r\n  I never see you drunk about,\r\n    Then tell me where you’ve been.\r\n\r\n  Your wife and family--are they well?\r\n    You once did use them strange:\r\n  O, are you kinder to them grown,\r\n    How came this happy change?\r\n\r\n“Then Dermot tells how he dreamed of his wife’s sudden death, and his\r\nchildrens’ misery as they cried about her dead body, while he was drunk\r\nin bed, and as he calls out in his misery, he wakes, and finds his wife\r\nby his side. The ballad ends:\r\n\r\n  ‘I pressed her to my throbbing heart,\r\n    Whilst joyous tears did stream;\r\n  And ever since, I’ve heaven blest,\r\n    For sending me that dream.’\r\n\r\n“Dermot turned teetotaller. The teetotallers were very much pleased\r\nwith that song. The printer once sent me 5_s._ on account of it.\r\n\r\n“I have written all sorts of things--ballads on a subject, and copies\r\nof verses, and anything ordered of me, or on anything I thought would\r\nbe accepted, but now I can’t get about. I’ve been asked to write\r\nindecent songs, but I refused. One man offered me 5_s._ for six such\r\nsongs.--‘Why, that’s less than the common price,’ said I, ‘instead of\r\nsomething over to pay for the wickedness.’--All those sort of songs\r\ncome now to the streets, I believe all do, from the concert-rooms.\r\nI can imitate any poetry. I don’t recollect any poet I’ve imitated.\r\nNo, sir, not Scott or Moore, that I know of, but if they’ve written\r\npopular songs, then I dare say I have imitated them. Writing poetry\r\nis no comfort to me in my sickness. It might if I could write just\r\nwhat I please. The printers like hanging subjects best, and I don’t.\r\nBut when any of them sends to order a copy of verses for a ‘Sorrowful\r\nLamentation’ of course I must supply them. I don’t think much of what\r\nI’ve done that way. If I’d my own fancy, I’d keep writing acrostics,\r\nsuch as one I wrote on our rector.” “God bless him,” interrupted the\r\nwife, “he’s a good man.” “That he is,” said the poet, “but he’s never\r\nseen what I wrote about him, and perhaps never will.” He then desired\r\nhis wife to reach him his big Bible, and out of it he handed me a piece\r\nof paper, with the following lines written on it, in a small neat hand\r\nenough:\r\n\r\n  “C elestial blessings hover round his head,\r\n   H undreds of poor, by his kindness were fed,\r\n   A nd precepts taught which he himself obeyed.\r\n   M an, erring man, brought to the fold of God,\r\n   P reaching pardon through a Saviour’s blood.\r\n   N o lukewarm priest, but firm to Heaven’s cause;\r\n   E xamples showed how much he loved its laws.\r\n   Y outh and age, he to their wants attends,\r\n   S teward of Christ--the poor man’s sterling friend.”\r\n\r\n“There would be some comfort, sir,” he continued, “if one could go on\r\nwriting at will like that. As it is, I sometimes write verses all over\r\na slate, and rub them out again. Live hard! yes, indeed, we do live\r\nhard. I hardly know the taste of meat. We live on bread and butter, and\r\ntea; no, not any fish. As you see, sir, I work at tinning. I put new\r\nbottoms into old tin tea-pots, and such like. Here’s my sort of bench,\r\nby my poor bit of a bed. In the best weeks I earn 4_s._ by tinning,\r\nnever higher. In bad weeks I earn only 1_s._ by it, and sometimes not\r\nthat,--and there are more shilling than four shilling weeks by three\r\nto one. As to my poetry, a good week is 3_s._, and a poor week is\r\n1_s._--and sometimes I make nothing at all that way. So I leave you\r\nto judge, sir, whether we live hard; for the comings in, and what we\r\nhave from the parish, must keep six of us--myself, my wife, and four\r\nchildren. It’s a long, hard struggle.” “Yes, indeed,” said the wife,\r\n“it’s just as you’ve heard my husband tell, sir. We’ve 2_s._ a week and\r\nfour loaves of bread from the parish, and the rent’s 2_s._ 6_d._, and\r\nthe landlord every week has 2_s._,--and 6_d._ he has done for him in\r\ntinning work. Oh, we do live hard, indeed.”\r\n\r\nAs I was taking my leave, the poor man expressed a desire that I would\r\ntake a copy of an epitaph which he had written for himself. “If ever,”\r\nhe said, “I am rich enough to provide for a tomb-stone, or my family is\r\nrich enough to give me one, this shall be my epitaph” [I copied it from\r\na blank page in his Bible:]\r\n\r\n  “Stranger, pause, a moment stay,\r\n  Tread lightly o’er this mound of clay.\r\n  Here lies J---- H----, in hopes to rise,\r\n  And meet his Saviour in the skies.\r\n  Christ his refuge, Heaven his home,\r\n  Where pain and sorrow never come.\r\n  His journey’s done, his trouble’s past,\r\n  With God he sleeps in peace at last.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BROAD-SHEETS.\r\n\r\nThe broad-sheet known in street-sale is an unfolded sheet, varying in\r\nsize, and printed on one side. The word is frequently used to signify\r\nan account of a murder or execution, but it may contain an account\r\nof a fire, an “awful accident and great loss of life,” a series of\r\nconundrums, as in those called “Nuts to Crack,” a comic or intended\r\ncomic engraving, with a speech or some verses, as recently in satire\r\nof the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman (these are sometimes called “comic\r\nexhibitions”), or a “bill of the play.” The “cocks” are more frequently\r\na smaller size than the broad-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of these articles (play-bills excepted), are of the class\r\nI have described as patterers. The play-bill sellers are very rarely\r\npatterers on other “paper work.” Some of them are on the look-out\r\nduring the day for a job in porterage or such like, but they are not\r\nmixed up with any pattering,--and a regular patterer looks down upon a\r\nplay-bill seller as a poor creature, “fit for nothing but play-bills.”\r\nI now proceed to describe such of these classes as have not been\r\npreviously given.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “GALLOWS” LITERATURE OF THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I class all the street-sold publications which relate\r\nto the hanging of malefactors. That the question is not of any minor\r\nimportance must be at once admitted, when it is seen how very extensive\r\na portion of the reading of the poor is supplied by the “Sorrowful\r\nLamentations” and “Last Dying Speech, Confession, and Execution” of\r\ncriminals. One paper-worker told me, that in some small and obscure\r\nvillages in Norfolk, which, he believed, were visited only by himself\r\nin his line, it was not very uncommon for two poor families to _club_\r\nfor 1_d._ to purchase an execution broad-sheet! Not long after Rush was\r\nhung, he saw, one evening after dark, through the uncurtained cottage\r\nwindow, eleven persons, young and old, gathered round a scanty fire,\r\nwhich was made to blaze by being fed with a few sticks. An old man was\r\nreading, to an attentive audience, a broad-sheet of Rush’s execution,\r\nwhich my informant had sold to him; he read by the fire-light; for the\r\nvery poor in those villages, I was told, rarely lighted a candle on\r\na spring evening, saying that “a bit o’ fire was good enough to talk\r\nby.” The scene must have been impressive, for it had evidently somewhat\r\nimpressed the perhaps not very susceptible mind of my informant.\r\n\r\nThe procedure on the occasion of a “good” murder, or of a murder\r\nexpected to “turn out well,” is systematic. First appears a\r\nquarter-sheet (a hand-bill, 9-1/2 in. by 7-1/2 in.) containing the\r\nearliest report of the matter. Next come half-sheets (twice the\r\nsize) of later particulars, or discoveries, or--if the supposed\r\nmurderer be in custody--of further examinations. The sale of these\r\nbills is confined almost entirely to London, and in their production\r\nthe newspapers are for the most part followed closely enough. Then\r\nare produced the whole, or broad-sheets (twice the size of the\r\nhalf-sheets), and, lastly, but only on great occasions, the _double_\r\nbroad-sheet. [I have used the least technical terms that I might not\r\npuzzle the reader with accounts of “crowns,” “double-crowns,” &c.]\r\n\r\nThe most important of all the broad-sheets of executions, according\r\nto concurrent, and indeed unanimous, testimony is the case of Rush. I\r\nspeak of the testimony of the street-folk concerned, who all represent\r\nthe sale of the papers relative to Rush, both in town and country, as\r\nthe best in their experience of late years.\r\n\r\nThe sheet bears the title of “The Sorrowful Lamentation and Last\r\nFarewell of J. B. Rush, who is ordered for Execution on Saturday\r\nnext, at Norwich Castle.” There are three illustrations. The largest\r\nrepresents Rush, cloaked and masked, “shooting Mr. Jermy, Sen.” Another\r\nis of “Rush shooting Mrs. Jermy.” A prostrate body is at her feet,\r\nand the lady herself is depicted as having a very small waist and\r\ngreat amplitude of gown-skirts. The third is a portrait of Rush,--a\r\ncorrect copy, I was assured, and have no reason to question the\r\nassurance,--from one in the _Norwich Mercury_. The account of the trial\r\nand biography of Rush, his conduct in prison, &c., is a concise and\r\nclear enough condensation from the newspapers. Indeed, Rush’s Sorrowful\r\nLamentation is the best, in all respects, of any execution broad-sheet\r\nI have seen; even the “copy of verses” which, according to the\r\nestablished custom, the criminal composes in the condemned cell--his\r\nbeing unable, in some instances, to read or write being no obstacle\r\nto the composition--seems, in a literary point of view, of a superior\r\nstrain to the run of such things. The matters of fact, however, are\r\nintroduced in the same peculiar manner. The worst part is the morbid\r\nsympathy and intended apology for the criminal. I give the verses\r\nentire:\r\n\r\n  “This vain world I soon shall leave,\r\n  Dear friends in sorrow do not grieve;\r\n  Mourn not my end, though ’tis severe,\r\n  For death awaits the murderer.\r\n\r\n  Now in a dismal cell I lie,\r\n  For murder I’m condemn’d to die;\r\n  Some may pity when they read,\r\n  Oppression drove me to the deed.\r\n\r\n  My friends and home to me were dear,\r\n  The trees and flowers that blossom’d near;\r\n  The sweet loved spot where youth began\r\n  Is dear to every Englishman.\r\n\r\n  I once was happy--that is past,\r\n  Distress and crosses came at last;\r\n  False friendship smiled on wealth and me,\r\n  But shunned me in adversity.\r\n\r\n  The scaffold is awaiting me,\r\n  For Jermy I have murdered thee;\r\n  Thy hope and joys--thy son I slew,\r\n  Thy wife and servant wounded too.\r\n\r\n  I think I hear the world to say--\r\n  ‘Oh Rush, why didst thou Jermy slay?\r\n  His dear loved son why didst thou kill,\r\n  For he had done to thee no ill.’\r\n\r\n  If Jermy had but kindness shown,\r\n  And not have trod misfortune down,\r\n  I ne’er had fired the fatal ball\r\n  That caus’d his son and him to fall.\r\n\r\n  My cause I did defend alone,\r\n  For learned counsel I had none;\r\n  I pleaded hard and questions gave,\r\n  In hopes my wretched life to save.\r\n\r\n  The witness to confound did try,\r\n  But God ordained that I should die;\r\n  Eliza Chestney she was there,--\r\n  I’m sorry I have injured her.\r\n\r\n  Oh, Emily Sandford, was it due\r\n  That I should meet my death through you?\r\n  If you had wish’d me well indeed,\r\n  How could you thus against me plead?\r\n\r\n  I’ve used thee kind, though not my wife:\r\n  Your evidence has cost my life;\r\n  A child by me you have had born,\r\n  Though hard against me you have sworn.\r\n\r\n  The scaffold is, alas! my doom,--\r\n  I soon shall wither in the tomb:\r\n  God pardon me--no mercy’s here\r\n  For Rush--the wretched murderer!”\r\n\r\nAlthough the execution broad-sheet I have cited may be the best, taken\r\naltogether, which has fallen under my observation, nearly all I have\r\nseen have one characteristic--the facts can be plainly understood. The\r\nnarrative, embracing trial, biography, &c., is usually prepared by the\r\nprinter, being a condensation from the accounts in the newspapers, and\r\nis perhaps intelligible, simply because it _is_ a condensation. It is\r\nso, moreover, in spite of bad grammar, and sometimes perhaps from an\r\nunskilful connection of the different eras of the trial.\r\n\r\nWhen the circumstances of the case permit, or can be at all constrained\r\nto do so, the Last Sorrowful Lamentation contains a “Love Letter,”\r\nwritten--as one patterer told me he had occasionally expressed it,\r\nwhen he thought his audience suitable--“from the depths of the\r\ncondemned cell, with the condemned pen, ink, and paper.” The style is\r\nstereotyped, and usually after this fashion:\r\n\r\n “Dear ----,--Shrink not from receiving a letter from one who is\r\n condemned to die as a murderer. Here, in my miserable cell, I write to\r\n one whom I have from my first acquaintanceship, held in the highest\r\n esteem, and whom, I believe, has also had the same kindly feeling\r\n towards myself. Believe me, I forgive all my enemies and bear no\r\n malice. O, my dear ----, guard against giving way to evil passions,\r\n and a fondness for drink. Be warned by my sad and pitiful fate.”\r\n\r\nIf it be not feasible to have a love-letter--which can be addressed to\r\neither wife or sweetheart--in the foregoing style, a “last letter” is\r\ngiven, and this can be written to father, mother, son, daughter, or\r\nfriend; and is usually to the following purport:\r\n\r\n  “Condemned Cell, ----\r\n\r\n “My Dear ----,--By the time you receive this my hours, in this world,\r\n will indeed be short. It is an old and true saying, that murderers\r\n will one day meet their proper reward. No one can imagine the dreadful\r\n nights of anguish passed by me since the commital of the crime on poor\r\n ----. All my previous victims have appeared before me in a thousand\r\n different shapes and forms. My sufferings have been more than I can\r\n possibly describe. Let me entreat you to turn from your evil ways and\r\n lead a honest and sober life. I am suffering so much at the present\r\n moment both from mind and body that I can write no longer. Farewell!\r\n farewell!\r\n\r\n  “Your affectionate ----.”\r\n\r\nI have hitherto spoken of the Last Sorrowful Lamentation sheets. The\r\nnext broad-sheet is the “Life, Trial, Confession, and Execution.”\r\nThis presents the same matter as the “Lamentation,” except that\r\na part--perhaps the judge’s charge at the trial, or perhaps the\r\nbiography--is removed to make room for the “Execution,” and\r\noccasionally for a portion of the “Condemned Sermon.” To judge by the\r\nproductions I treat of, both subjects are marvelously similar on all\r\noccasions. I cite a specimen of the Condemned Sermon, as preached,\r\naccording to the broad-sheet, before Hewson, condemned for the murder\r\nof a turnkey. It will be seen that it is of a character to fit _any_\r\ncondemned sermon whatever:\r\n\r\n “The rev. gent. then turned his discourse particularly to the unhappy\r\n prisoner doomed to die on the morrow, and told him to call on Him who\r\n alone had the power of forgiveness; who had said, ‘though his sins\r\n were red as scarlet,’ he would ‘make them white as snow,’ though he\r\n had been guilty of many heinous crimes, there was yet an opportunity\r\n of forgiveness.--During the delivery of this address, the prisoner was\r\n in a very desponding state, and at its conclusion was helped out of\r\n the chapel by the turnkeys.”\r\n\r\nThe “Execution” is detailed generally in this manner. I cite the “Life,\r\nTrial, Confession and Execution of Mary May, for the Murder of W.\r\nConstable, her Half-brother, by Poison, at Wix, near Manningtree:”\r\n\r\n “At an early hour this morning the space before the prison was very\r\n much crowded by persons anxious to witness the execution of Mary\r\n May, for the murder of William Constable, her half-brother, by\r\n poison, at Wix, Manningtree, which gradually increased to such a\r\n degree, that a great number of persons suffered extremely from the\r\n pressure, and gladly gave up their places on the first opportunity\r\n to escape from the crowd. The sheriffs and their attendants arrived\r\n at the prison early this morning and proceeded to the condemn cell,\r\n were they found the reverend ordinary engaged in prayer with the\r\n miserable woman. After the usual formalities had been observed of\r\n demanding the body of the prisoner into their custody she was then\r\n conducted to the press-room. The executioner with his assistants\r\n then commenced pinioning her arms, which opperation they skillfully\r\n and quickly dispatched. During these awful preparations the unhappy\r\n woman appeared mently to suffer severely, but uttered not a word when\r\n the hour arrived and all the arrangements having been completed,\r\n the bell commenced tolling, and then a change was observed, to come\r\n over the face of the prisoner, who trembling violently, walked with\r\n the melancholy procession, proceeded by the reverend ordinary, who\r\n read aloud the funeral service for the dead. When the bell commenced\r\n tolling a moment was heard from without, and the words “Hats off,”\r\n and “Silence,” were distinctly heard, from which time nothing but a\r\n continual sobbing was heard. On arriving at the foot of the steps\r\n leading to the scaffold she thanked the sheriffs and the worthy\r\n governor of the prison, for their kind attentions to her during her\r\n confinement; & then the unfortunate woman was seen on the scaffold,\r\n there was a death like silence prevailed among the vast multitude of\r\n people assembled. In a few seconds the bolt was drawn, and, after a\r\n few convulsive struggles, the unhappy woman ceased to exist.”\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from calling the reader’s attention to the “copy of\r\nverses” touching Mary May. I give them entire, for they seem to me\r\nto contain all the elements which made the old ballads popular--the\r\nrushing at once into the subject--and the homely reflections, though\r\ncrude to all educated persons, are, nevertheless, well adapted to\r\nenlist the sympathy and appreciation of the class of hearers to whom\r\nthey are addressed:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF VERSES.\r\n\r\n  “The solemn bell for me doth toll,\r\n    And I am doom’d to die\r\n  (For murdering my brother dear,)\r\n    Upon a tree so high.\r\n  For gain I did premeditate\r\n    My brother for to slay,--\r\n  Oh, think upon the dreadful fate\r\n    Of wretched Mary May.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  Behold the fate of Mary May,\r\n  Who did for gain her brother slay.\r\n\r\n  In Essex boundry I did dwell,\r\n    My brother lived with me,\r\n  In a little village called Wix,\r\n    Not far from Manningtree.\r\n  In a burial club I entered him,\r\n    On purpose him to slay;\r\n  And to obtain the burial fees\r\n    I took his life away.\r\n\r\n  One eve he to his home return’d,\r\n    Not thinking he was doom’d,\r\n  To be sent by a sister’s hand\r\n    Unto the silent tomb.\r\n  His tea for him I did prepare,\r\n    And in it poison placed,\r\n  To which I did administer,--\r\n    How dreadful was his case.\r\n\r\n  Before he long the poison took\r\n    In agony he cried;\r\n  Upon him I in scorn did look,--\r\n    At length my brother died.\r\n  Then to the grave I hurried him,\r\n    And got him out of sight,\r\n  But God ordain’d this cruel deed\r\n    Should soon be brought to light.\r\n\r\n  I strove the money to obtain,\r\n    For which I did him slay,\r\n  By which, also, suspicion fell\r\n    On guilty Mary May.\r\n  The poison was discovered,\r\n    Which caused me to bewail,\r\n  And I my trial to await\r\n    Was sent to Chelmsford jail.\r\n\r\n  And for this most atrocious deed\r\n    I at the bar was placed,\r\n  The Jury found me guilty,--\r\n    How dreadful was my case.\r\n  The Judge the dreadful sentence pass’d,\r\n    And solemn said to me,\r\n  ‘You must return from whence you came,\r\n    And thence unto the tree.’\r\n\r\n  On earth I can no longer dwell,\r\n    There’s nothing can me save;\r\n  Hark! I hear the mournful knell\r\n    Which calls me to the grave.\r\n  Death appears in ghostly forms,\r\n    To summon me below;\r\n  See, the fatal bolt is drawn,\r\n    And Mary May must go.\r\n\r\n  Good people all, of each degree,\r\n    Before it is too late,\r\n  See me on the fatal tree,\r\n    And pity my sad fate.\r\n  My guilty heart stung with grief,\r\n    With agony and pain,--\r\n  My tender brother I did slay\r\n    That fatal day for gain.”\r\n\r\nThis mode of procedure in “gallows” literature, and this style of\r\ncomposition, have prevailed for from twenty to thirty years. I find\r\nmy usual impossibility to _fix_ a date among these street-folk;\r\nbut the Sorrowful Lamentation sheet was unknown until the law for\r\nprolonging the term of existence between the trial and death of the\r\ncapitally-convicted, was passed. “Before that, sir,” I was told, “there\r\nwasn’t no time for a Lamentation; sentence o’ Friday, and scragging\r\no’ Monday. So we had only the Life, Trial, and Execution.” Before the\r\nyear 1820, the Execution broad-sheets, &c., were “got up” in about the\r\nsame, though certainly in an inferior and more slovenly manner than at\r\npresent; and _one_ copy of verses often did service for the canticles\r\nof all criminals condemned to be hung. These verses were to sacred or\r\npsalm tunes, such as Job, or the Old Hundredth. I was told by an aged\r\ngentleman that he remembered, about the year 1812, hearing a song, or,\r\nas he called it, “stave,” of this description, not only given in the\r\nstreet with fiddle and nasal twang, to the tune of the Old Hundredth,\r\nbut commencing in the very words of Sternhold and Hopkins--\r\n\r\n  “All people that on earth do dwell.”\r\n\r\nThese “death-verses,” as they were sometimes called, were very\r\nfrequently sung by blind people, and in some parts of the country\r\nblind men and women still sing--generally to the accompaniment of a\r\nfiddle--the “copy of verses.” A London chaunter told me, that, a few\r\nyears back, he heard a blind man at York announce the “verses” as from\r\nthe “solitudes” of the condemned cell. At present the broad-sheet\r\nsellers usually sing, or chaunt, the copy of verses.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man, now himself a street-trader, told me that one of\r\nthe latest “execution songs” (as he called them) which he remembered\r\nto have heard in the old style--but “no doubt there were plenty after\r\nthat, as like one another as peas in a boiling”--was on the murder of\r\nWeare, at Elstree, in Hertfordshire. He took great interest in such\r\nthings when a boy, and had the song in question by heart, but could\r\nonly depend upon his memory for the first and second verses:\r\n\r\n  “Come, all good Christians, praise the Lord,\r\n    And trust to him in hope.\r\n  God in his mercy Jack Thurtell sent\r\n    To hang from Hertford gallows rope.\r\n\r\n  Poor Weare’s murder the Lord disclosed--\r\n    Be glory to his name:\r\n  And Thurtell, Hunt, and Probert too,\r\n    Were brought to grief and shame.”\r\n\r\nAnother street paper-worker whom I spoke to on the subject, and to\r\nwhom I read these two verses, said: “That’s just the old thing, sir;\r\nand it’s quite in old Jemmy Catnach’s style, for he used to write\r\nwerses--anyhow, he said he did, for I’ve heard him say so, and I’ve no\r\ndoubt he did in reality--it was just his favourite style, I know, but\r\nthe march of intellect put it out. It did so.”\r\n\r\nIn the most “popular” murders, the street “papers” are a mere recital\r\nfrom the newspapers, but somewhat more brief, when the suspected\r\nmurderer is in custody; but when the murderer has not been apprehended,\r\nor is unknown, “then,” said one Death-hunter, “we has our fling, and\r\nI’ve hit the mark a few chances that way. We had, at the werry least,\r\nhalf-a-dozen coves pulled up in the slums that we printed for the\r\nmurder of ‘The Beautiful Eliza Grimwood, in the Waterloo-road.’ I did\r\nbest on Thomas Hopkins, being the guilty man--I think he was Thomas\r\nHopkins--’cause a strong case was made out again him.”\r\n\r\nI received similar accounts of the street-doings in the case of\r\n“mysterious murders,” as those perpetrations are called by the paper\r\nworkers, when the criminal has escaped, or was unknown. Among those\r\nleaving considerable scope to the patterer’s powers of invention\r\nwere the murders of Mr. Westwood, a watchmaker in Prince’s-street,\r\nLeicester-square; of Eliza Davis, a bar-maid, in Frederick-street,\r\nHampstead-road; and of the policeman in Dagenham, Essex. One of the\r\nmost successful “cocks,” relating to murders which actually occurred,\r\nwas the “Confession to the Rev. Mr. Cox, Chaplain of Aylesbury Gaol,\r\nof John Tawell the Quaker.” I had some conversation with one of the\r\nauthors of this “Confession,”--for it was got up by three patterers;\r\nand he assured me that “it did well, and the facts was soon in some of\r\nthe newspapers--as what we ’riginates often is.” This sham confession\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n “The Rev. Mr. Cox, the chaplain of Aylesbury Gaol, having been taken\r\n ill, and finding his end approaching, sent for his son, and said,\r\n ‘Take this confession; now I am as good as my word; I promised that\r\n unhappy man, John Tawell, that while I lived his confession should not\r\n be made public, owing to the excited state of the public mind. Tawell\r\n confessed to me, that besides the murder of Sarah Hart, at Salt-hill,\r\n for which he suffered the last penalty of the law at Aylesbury, he was\r\n guilty of two other barbarous murders while abroad as a transport in\r\n Van Dieman’s Land. One of these barbarous and horrid murders was on\r\n the body of one of the keepers. He knocked him down with the keys,\r\n which he wrenched from him, and then cut his throat with his own\r\n knife, leaving the body locked up in his cell; and before that, to\r\n have the better opportunity of having the turnkey single-handed, John\r\n Tawell feigned illness. He then locked the keeper, in the cell, and\r\n went to a young woman in the town, a beautiful innkeeper’s daughter,\r\n whom he had seduced as he worked for her father, as he had the\r\n privilege of doing in the day-times. He went to her, and she, seeing\r\n him in a flurried state, with blood upon his hand, questioned him. He\r\n told the unhappy young woman how he had killed the keeper for the love\r\n of her, and the best thing to be done was for her to get possession of\r\n all the money she could, and escape with him to this country, where\r\n he would marry her, and support her like a lady. The unhappy young\r\n woman felt so terrified, that at the moment she was unable to say yes\r\n or no. He became alarmed for his safety, and with the identical knife\r\n that he killed the keeper with, he left his unhappy victim a weltering\r\n in her gore. He then fled from the house unobserved, and went into\r\n the bush, where he met three men, who had escaped through his killing\r\n the keeper. He advised them to go down with him to an English vessel\r\n lying off the coast. When they reached the shore, they met a crew in\r\n search of fresh water; to them they made out a pitiful story, and\r\n were taken on board the ship. All being young men, and the captain\r\n being short of hands, and one of them having been really a seaman\r\n transported for mutiny, the captain, after putting questions which the\r\n seaman answered, engaged them to work their passage home. Tawell was\r\n the captain of the gang, and was most looked up to. They worked their\r\n passage home, behaving well during the voyage, so that the captain\r\n said he would make each of them a present, and never divulge. When\r\n they reached Liverpool, Tawell robbed the captain’s cabin of all the\r\n money contained in it, which was a very considerable sum. After that\r\n he left Liverpool, and adopted the garb of a Quaker, in which he could\r\n not easily be recognized, and then pursued the course of wickedness\r\n and crime which led him to a shameful death.’”\r\n\r\nThe “confession” of Rush to the chaplain of Norwich Castle, was another\r\nproduction which was remunerative to the patterers. “There was soon a\r\nbit of it in the newspapers,” said one man, “for us and them treads\r\nclose on one another’s heels. The newspapers ‘screeved’ about Rush,\r\nand his mother, and his wife; but we, in our patter, made him confess\r\nto having murdered his old grandmother fourteen years back, and how he\r\nburied her under the apple-tree in the garden, and how he murdered his\r\nwife as well.”\r\n\r\nThese ulterior Confessions are very rarely introduced, in lieu of some\r\nmatter displaced, into the broad-sheet, but form separate bills. It was\r\nnecessary to mention them here, however, and so preserve the sequence\r\nof the whole of the traffic consequent upon a conviction for murder, in\r\nthis curious trade.\r\n\r\nSometimes the trial, &c., form also separate bills, as well as being\r\nembodied afterwards in the Sorrowful Lamentation. This is only,\r\nhowever, in cases which are deemed important. One of the papers I\r\nobtained, for instance, is the “Trial of Mr. and Mrs. Manning for\r\nthe Murder of Mr. Patrick O’Connor.” The trial alone occupies a\r\nbroad-sheet; it is fairly “got up.” A portrait of Mr. Patrick O’Connor\r\nheads the middle column. From the presence of a fur collar to the coat\r\nor cloak, and of what is evidently an order with its insignia, round\r\nthe neck, I have little doubt that the portrait of Mr. O’Connor was\r\noriginally that of the sovereign in whose service O’Connor was once an\r\nexcise-officer--King William IV.\r\n\r\nThe last publication to which the trade has recourse is “the book.”\r\nThis is usually eight pages, but sometimes only four of a larger\r\nsize. In authorship, matter, or compilation, it differs little from\r\nthe narratives I have described. The majority of these books are\r\nprepared by one man. They are in a better form for being preserved as\r\na record than is a broad-sheet, and are frequently sold, and almost\r\nalways offered by the patterers when they cry a new case on a sheet,\r\nas “people that loves such reading likes to keep a good account of\r\nthe best by them; and so, when I’ve sold Manning’s bills, I’ve often\r\nshoved off Rush’s books.” The books, like the bills, have generally the\r\nletters and the copy of verses.\r\n\r\nSome of these books have the title-page set forth in full display,--for\r\nexample: “_Horrible Murder and Mutilation of Lucy Game, aged 15, by her\r\nCruel Brother, William Game, aged 9, at Westmill, Hertfordshire. His\r\nCommittal and Confession. With a Copy of Letter. Also, Full Particulars\r\nof the Poisonings in Essex._” Here, as there was no execution, the\r\nmatter was extended, to include the poisonings in Essex. The title I\r\nhave quoted is expanded into thirteen lines. Sometimes the title-page\r\nis adorned with a portrait. One, I was told, which was last employed\r\nas a portrait of Calcraft, had done severe service since Courvoisier’s\r\ntime,--for my informant thought that Courvoisier was the original. It\r\nis the bust of an ill-looking man, with coat and waistcoat fitting with\r\nthat unwrinkled closeness which characterises the figures in tailors’\r\n“fashions.”\r\n\r\nThe above style of work is known in the trade as “the book;” but other\r\npublications, in the book or pamphlet form, are common enough. In\r\nsome I have seen, the title-page is a history in little. I cite one\r\nof these:--“_Founded on Facts. The Whitby Tragedy; or, the Gambler’s\r\nFate. Containing the Lives of Joseph Carr, aged 21, and his sweetheart,\r\nMaria Leslie, aged 19, who were found Dead, lying by each other, on\r\nthe morning of the 23rd of May. Maria was on her road to Town to buy\r\nsome Ribbon, &c., for her Wedding Day, when her lover in a state of\r\nintoxication fired at her, and then run to rob his prey, but finding it\r\nto be his Sweetheart, reloaded his Gun, placed the Muzzle to his Mouth,\r\nand blew out his Brains, all through cursed Cards, Drink, &c. Also, an\r\naffectionate Copy of Verses._”\r\n\r\nTo show the extent of the trade in execution broad-sheets, I obtained\r\nreturns of the number of copies relating to the principal executions of\r\nlate, that had been sold:\r\n\r\n  Of  Rush            2,500,000 copies.\r\n   „  the Mannings    2,500,000    „\r\n   „  Courvoisier     1,666,000    „\r\n   „  Good            1,650,000    „\r\n   „  Corder          1,650,000    „\r\n   „  Greenacre       1,666,000    „\r\n\r\nOf Thurtell I could obtain no accounts--“it was so long ago;” but the\r\nsale, I was told, was enormous. Reckoning that each copy was sold for\r\n1_d._ (the regular price in the country, where the great sale is,) the\r\nmoney expended for such things amounts to upwards of 48,500_l._ in the\r\ncase of the six murderers above given. All this number was printed and\r\ngot up in London; a few “broad-sheets” concerning Rush were printed\r\nalso in Norwich.\r\n\r\nTouching the issue of “cocks,” a person connected with the trade\r\ncalculated for me, from data at his command, that 3,456 copies were\r\nstruck off weekly, and sold in the streets, in the metropolis; and\r\nreckoning them at only a 1/2_d._ each, we have the sum of 7_l._ 4_s._\r\nspent every week in this manner. At this rate, there must be 179,712\r\ncopies of “cocks” printed in a year, on which the public expend no less\r\nthan 374_l._ 8_s._\r\n\r\nOf the style of illustrations usually accompanying this class of street\r\nliterature the two large engravings here given are _fac similes_--while\r\nthe smaller ones are faithful copies of the average embellishments to\r\nthe halfpenny ballads. On another occasion I shall speak at length on\r\n“Street-Art.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CONUNDRUMS.\r\n\r\nAmong the more modern street sales are “conundrums,” generally vended,\r\nboth in the shops and the streets, as “Nuts to Crack,” when not in\r\nthe form of books. This is another of the “broad-sheets,” and is\r\nsufficiently clever and curious in its way.\r\n\r\nIn the centre, at the top, is the “Wonderful Picture,” with the\r\nfollowing description: “This Picture when looked at from a particular\r\npoint of view, will not only appear perfect in all respects and free\r\nfrom distortion, but the figures will actually appear to stand out\r\nin relief from the paper.” The wonderful picture, which is a rude\r\nimitation of a similar toy picture sold in a box, “with eye-piece\r\ncomplete,” at the shops, presents a distorted view of a church-spire, a\r\nlight-house, a donjon-keep, castellated buildings backed by mountains,\r\na moat on which are two vessels, an arch surmounted by a Britannia,\r\na palm-tree (I presume), and a rampart, or pier, or something\r\nthat way, on which are depicted two figures, with the gestures of\r\nelocutionists. The buildings are elongated, like shadows at sunset or\r\nsunrise. What may be the “particular point of view” announced in the\r\ndescription of the Wonderful Picture, is not described in the “Nuts,”\r\nbut the following explanation is given in a little book, published\r\nsimultaneously, and entitled, “The Nutcrackers, a Key to Nuts to Crack,\r\nor Enigmatical Repository:”\r\n\r\n “THE WONDERFUL PICTURE.--Cut out a piece of cardboard 2-1/2 inches\r\n long, make a round hole about the size of a pea in the top of it;\r\n place this level with the right-hand side of the Engraving and just\r\n 1-1/2 inches distant from it, then apply your eye to the little hole\r\n and look at the picture, and you will find that a beautiful symmetry\r\n pervades the landscape, there is not the slightest appearance of\r\n distortion, and the different parts appear actually to stand up in\r\n relief on the paper.”\r\n\r\nBelow the “Wonderful Picture” are other illustrations; and the border\r\nof the broad-sheet presents a series of what may be called pictorial\r\nengravings. The first is,\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  D I O\r\n   C C\r\n\r\n1.--Lately presented to a “Wise man” by a usurper.]\r\n\r\nThe answer being evidently “Diocese.” No. 26 is\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  |----------\r\n\r\n  A 4\r\n\r\n26.--The Child’s “Tidy.”]\r\n\r\n“Pinafore” is the solution. Of the next “hieroglyphic”--for a second\r\ntitle to the “Nuts” tells of “200 Hieroglyphics, Enigmas, Conundrums,\r\nCurious Puzzles, and other Ingenious Devices,”--I cannot speak very\r\nhighly. It consists of “AIMER,” (a figure of a hare at full speed,) and\r\n“EKA.” Answer.--“America.”\r\n\r\nIn the body of the broad-sheet are the Enigmas, &c., announced; of\r\neach of which I give a specimen, to show the nature of this street\r\nperformance or entertainment. Enigma 107 is--\r\n\r\n  “I’ve got no wings, yet in the air\r\n    I often rise and fall;\r\n  I’ve got no feet, yet clogs I wear,\r\n    And shoes, and boots, and all.”\r\n\r\nAs the answer is foot-ball, the two last lines should manifestly have\r\nbeen placed first.\r\n\r\nThe “Conundrums” are next in the arrangement, and I cite one of them:\r\n\r\n “Why are there, strictly speaking, only 325 days in the year?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” is the reply, “forty of them are lent and never returned.”\r\nThe “Riddles” follow in this portion of the “Nuts to Crack.” Of these,\r\none is not very difficult to be solved, though it is distinguished for\r\nthe usual grammatical confusion of tenses:\r\n\r\n “A man has three daughters, and each of these have a brother. How many\r\n children had he?”\r\n\r\nThe “Charades” complete the series. Of these I select one of the best:\r\n\r\n  “I am a word of letters seven,\r\n  I’m sinful in the sight of heaven,\r\n  To every virtue I’m opposed,\r\n  Man’s weary life I’ve often closed.\r\n  If to me you prefix two letters more,\r\n  I mean exactly what I meant before.”\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the letter-press consist of “Anagrams,”\r\n“Transpositions,” &c.\r\n\r\nWhen a clever patterer “works conundrums”--for the trade is in the\r\nhands of the pattering class--he selects what he may consider the best,\r\nand reads or repeats them in the street, sometimes with and sometimes\r\nwithout the answer. But he does not cripple the probable quickness of\r\nhis sale by a slavish adherence to what is in type. He puts the matter,\r\nas it were, personally. “What gentleman is it,” one man told me he\r\nwould ask, “in this street, that has--\r\n\r\n  ‘Eyes like saucers, a back like a box,\r\n  A nose like a pen-knife, and a voice like a fox?’\r\n\r\nYou can learn for a penny. Or sometimes I’ll go on with the patter,\r\nthus,” he continued, “What lady is it that we have all seen, and who\r\ncan say truly--\r\n\r\n  ‘I am brighter than day, I am swifter than light,\r\n  And stronger than all the momentum of might?’\r\n\r\nMore than once people have sung out ‘the Queen,’ for they seem to think\r\nthat the momentum of might couldn’t fit any one else. It’s ‘thought’ as\r\nis the answer, but it wouldn’t do to let people think it’s anything of\r\nthe sort. It must seem to fit _somebody_. If I see a tailor’s name on a\r\ndoor, as soon as I’ve passed the corner of the street, and sometimes in\r\nthe same street, I’ve asked--\r\n\r\n ‘Why is Mr. So-and-so, the busy tailor of this (or the next street)\r\n never at home?’\r\n\r\n‘Because he’s always cutting out.’ I have the same questions for other\r\ntradesmen, and for gentlemen and ladies in this neighbourhood, and no\r\ngammon. All for a penny. Nuts to Crack, a penny. A pair of Nutcrackers\r\nto crack ’em, only one penny.”\r\n\r\nSometimes this man, who perhaps is the smartest in the trade, will\r\ntake a bolder flight still, and when he knows the residence of any\r\nprofessional or public man, he will, if the allusion be complimentary,\r\nannounce his name, or--if there be any satire--indicate by a motion of\r\nthe head, or a gesture of the hand, the direction of his residence. My\r\ningenuous, and certainly ingenious, informant obliged me with a few\r\ninstances:--“In Whitechapel parish I’ve said--it ain’t in the print, it\r\nwas only in the patter--‘Why won’t the Reverend Mr. Champneys lay up\r\ntreasures on earth?’--‘Because he’d rather lay up treasures in heaven.’\r\nThat’s the reverend gentleman not far from this spot; but in this\r\nsheet--with nearly 100 engravings by the first artists, only a penny--I\r\nhave other questions for other parsons, not so easy answered; nuts as\r\nis hard to crack. ‘Why is the Reverend Mr. Popjoy,’ or the Honourable\r\nLawyer Bully, or Judge Wiggem,--and then I just jerks my thumb, sir,\r\nif it’s where I know or think such people live--‘Why is the Reverend\r\nMr. Popjoy (or the others) like _two_ balloons, one in the air to the\r\neast, and the ’tother in the air to the west, in this parish of St.\r\nGeorge’s, Hanover-square?’ There’s no such question, and as it’s a\r\nsort of a ‘cock,’ of course there’s no answer. I don’t know one. But a\r\ngentleman’s servant once sung out: ‘’Cause he’s uppish.’ And a man in a\r\nleather apron once said: ‘He’s a raising the wind,’ which was nonsense.\r\nBut I like that sort of interruption, and have said--‘You’ll not find\r\n_that_ answer in the Nutcrackers,’ only a penny--and, Lord knows, I\r\ntold the truth when I said so, and it helps the sale. No fear of any\r\none’s finding out all what’s in the sheet before I’m out of the ‘drag.’\r\nNot a bit. And you must admit that any way it’s a cheap pennorth.” That\r\nit is a cheap harmless pennyworth is undeniable.\r\n\r\nThe street-sale of conundrums is carried on most extensively during a\r\nweek or two before Christmas; and on summer evenings, when the day’s\r\nwork is, or ought to be, over even among the operatives of the slop\r\nemployers. As the conundrum patterer requires an audience, he works\r\nthe quieter streets, preferring such as have no horse-thoroughfare--as\r\nin some of the approaches from the direction of Golden-square to\r\nRegent-street. The trade is irregularly pursued, none following it\r\nall the year; and from the best information I could acquire, it\r\nappears that fifteen men may be computed as working conundrums for\r\ntwo months throughout the twelve, and clearing 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly,\r\nper individual. The cost of the “Nuts to Crack” (when new) is 5_d._\r\na doz. to the seller; but old “Nuts” often answer the purpose of the\r\nstreet-seller, and may be had for about half the price; the cost of the\r\n“Nut-crackers” 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ It may be calculated, then, that to\r\nrealize the 10_s._ 6_d._, 15_s._ must be taken. This shows the street\r\nexpenditure in “Nuts to Crack” and “Nut-crackers” to be 90_l._ yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF COMIC EXHIBITIONS, MAGICAL DELUSIONS, &C.\r\n\r\nThe street sale of “Comic Exhibitions” (properly so called) is, of\r\ncourse, as modern as the last autumn and winter; and it is somewhat\r\ncurious that the sale of any humorous, or meant to be humorous sheet\r\nof engravings, is now becoming very generally known in the street sale\r\nas a “Comic Exhibition.” Among these--as I have before intimated--are\r\nmany caricatures of the Pope, the Church of Rome, Cardinal Wiseman, the\r\nChurch of England, the Bishop of London (or any bishop or dignitary),\r\nor of any characteristic of the conflicting creeds. In many of these,\r\nJohn Bull figures personally, and so does the devil.\r\n\r\nThe Comic Exhibition (proper) is certainly a very cheap pennyworth. No.\r\n1 is entitled, “The Ceremonial of the Opening of the Great Exhibition,\r\nin 1851, with Illustrations of the Contributions of All Nations.” The\r\n“contributions,” however, are reserved for Nos. 2 and 3. Two larger\r\n“cuts,” at the head of the broad-sheet, may be considered geographical,\r\nas regards the first, and allegorical as regards the second. “Table\r\nBay” presents a huge feeder (evidently), and the “Cape of Good Hope” is\r\na spare man obsequiously bowing to the table and its guest in good hope\r\nof a dinner. Of the Sandwich Islands and of Hung(a)ry, the “exhibition”\r\nis of the same description. The second larger cut shows the Crystal\r\nPalace ascending by the agency of a balloon, a host of people of all\r\ncountries looking on. Then comes the “Procession from Palace-yard\r\nto Hyde Park.” The first figure in this procession is described as\r\n“Beefeaters piping hot and well puffed out,” though there is but one\r\nbeefeater, with head larger than his body and legs ridiculously small,\r\n(as have nearly all the sequent figures), smoking a pipe as if it were\r\na trombone, duly followed by “Her Majesty’s Spiritual Body-guard” (five\r\nbeefeaters, drunk), and by “Prince Albert blowing his own trumpet”\r\n(from the back of a very sorry steed), with “Mops and brooms,” and\r\na “Cook-oo” (a housemaid and cook) as his supporters. Then follow\r\nfigures, grotesque enough, of which the titles convey the character: “A\r\nfamous Well-in-Town;” “Nae Peer-ye;” “Humorous Estimates” (Mr. Hume);\r\n“A Jew-d’ esprit” (Mr. D’Israeli); “An exemplification of Cupidity in\r\nPummicestone” (Lord Palmerston); “Old Geese” and “Young Ducks” (old\r\nand angry-looking and young and pretty women); “Some gentlemen who\r\npatronise Moses in the Minories” (certainly no credit to the skill of\r\na tailor); “A Jew Lion” (M. Jullien); “Fine high screams” (ice-creams)\r\nand “Capers” (chorister boys and ballet-girls); “Hey-day, you don’t\r\ntake advantage here” (Joseph Ady); and “Something to give the milk a\r\nhead” (a man with a horse’s head on a tray). These, however, are but a\r\nportion of the figures. The Comic Exhibition-sheet contains ninety such\r\nfigures, independent of those in the two cuts mentioned as headings.\r\n\r\n“Galleries of Comicalities,” or series of figures sometimes\r\nsatirically, sometimes grotesquely given without any aim at satire, are\r\nalso sold by the same parties, and are often announced as a “Threepenny\r\ngallery for a penny!--and dirt cheap at threepence. As big as a\r\nnewspaper.”\r\n\r\nAnother broad-sheet sold this winter in the streets is entitled,\r\n“Optical and Magical Delusions,” and was announced as “Dedicated to and\r\nPrepared for his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales--the only original\r\ncopy.” The engravings are six in number, and are in three rows, each\r\naccompanying engraving being reversed from its fellow: where the head\r\nis erect on one side, it is downward on the other. The first figure is\r\na short length of a very plain woman, while on the opposite side is\r\nthat of a very plain man, both pleased and smirking in accordance with\r\na line below: “O what joy when our lips shall meet!” “Cat-a-gorical”\r\nis a spectacled and hooded cat. “Dog-matical” is a dog with the hat,\r\nwig, and cane once held proper to a physician. “Cross purposes” is an\r\naustere lady in a monster cap, while her opposite husband is pointing\r\nbitterly to a long bill. The purport of these figures is shown in the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n “DIRECTIONS--Paste all over the Back of the sheet, and put a piece\r\n of thick paper between, to stiffen it, then fold it down the centre,\r\n so that the marginal lines fall exactly at the back of each other,\r\n (which may be ascertained by holding it to the light)--press it quite\r\n flat--when cut separate they will make three cards--shave them close\r\n to the margin--then take a needlefull of double thread and pass it\r\n through the dot at each end of the card; cut the thread off about\r\n three inches long. By twisting the threads between your fore fingers\r\n and thumbs, so as to spin the card round backwards and forwards with a\r\n rapid motion, the figures will appear to connect and form a pleasing\r\n delusion.”\r\n\r\nThen there are the “Magical Figures,” or rude street imitations of Dr.\r\nParis’ ingenious toy, called the “Thaumascope.” Beside these are what\r\nat the first glance appear mere black, and very black, marks, defining\r\nno object; but a closer examination shows the outlines of a face, or of\r\na face and figure. Of such there are sometimes four on a broad-sheet,\r\nbut they are also sold separately, both in the streets and the small\r\nstationers’ shops. When the white or black portion of the paper is cut\r\naway (for both colours are so prepared), what remains, by a disposition\r\nof the light, throws a huge shadow of a grotesque figure on the wall,\r\nwhich may be increased or diminished according to the motions of the\r\nexhibitor. The shadow-figures sold this winter by one of my informants\r\nwere of Mr. and Mrs. Manning, the Queen, Prince Albert, the Princess\r\nRoyal, and the Prince of Wales; “but you see, sir,” observed the man,\r\n“the Queen and the Prince does for any father and mother--for she\r\nhasn’t her crown on--and the Queen’s kids for anybody’s kids.”\r\n\r\nI mention these matters more particularly, as it certainly shows\r\nsomething of a change in the winter-evenings’ amusements of the\r\nchildren of the working-classes. The principal street customers for\r\nthese penny papers were mechanics, who bought them on their way home\r\nfor the amusement of their families. Boys, however, bought almost as\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nThe sale of these papers is carried on by the same men as I have\r\ndescribed working conundrums. A superior patterer, of course, shows\r\nthat his magical delusions and magical figures combine all the wonders\r\nof the magic lantern and the dissolving views, “and all for one penny.”\r\nThe trade is carried on only for a short time in the winter as regards\r\nthe magical portion; and I am informed that, including the “Comic\r\nExhibitions,” it extends to about half of the sum taken for conundrums,\r\nor to about 45_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PLAY-BILLS.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of play-bills carry on a trade which is exceedingly\r\nuncertain, and is little remunerative. There are now rather more than\r\n200 people selling play-bills in London, but the number has sometimes\r\nbeen as high as 400. “Yes, indeed,” a theatrical gentleman said to me,\r\n“and if a dozen more theatres were opened to-morrow, why each would\r\nhave more than its twenty bill-sellers the very first night. Where they\r\ncome from, or what they are, I haven’t a notion.”\r\n\r\nThe majority of the play-bill sellers are either old or young, the\r\nsexes being about equally engaged in this traffic. Some of them have\r\nfollowed the business from their childhood. I met with very few indeed\r\nwho knew anything of theatres beyond the names of the managers and\r\nof the principal performers, while some do not even enjoy that small\r\nmodicum of knowledge, and some can neither read nor write. The boys\r\noften run recklessly alongside the cabs which are conveying persons to\r\nthe theatre, and so offer their bills for sale. One of these youths\r\nsaid to me, when I spoke of the danger incurred, “The cabman knows\r\nhow to do it, sir, when I runs and patters; and so does his hoss.” An\r\nintelligent cabman, however, who was in the habit of driving parties\r\nto the Lyceum, told me that these lads clung to his cab as he drove\r\ndown to Wellington-street in such a way, for they seemed never to look\r\nbefore them, that he was in constant fear lest they should be run over.\r\nLadies are often startled by a face appearing suddenly at the cab\r\nwindow, “and thro’ my glass,” said my informant, “a face would look\r\ndirtier than it really is.” And certainly a face gliding along with\r\nthe cab, as it were, no accompanying body being visible, on a winter’s\r\nnight, while the sound of the runner’s footsteps is lost in the noise\r\nof the cab, has much the effect of an apparition.\r\n\r\nI did not hear of one person who had been in any way connected with\r\nthe stage, even as a supernumerary, resorting to play-bill selling\r\nwhen he could not earn a shilling within the walls of a theatre. These\r\nbill-sellers, for the most part, confine themselves, as far as I could\r\nascertain, to that particular trade. The youths say that they sometimes\r\nget a job in errand-going in the daytime, but the old men and women\r\ngenerally aver they can do nothing else. An officer, who, some years\r\nback, had been on duty at a large theatre, told me that at that time\r\nthe women bill-sellers earned a trifle in running errands for the\r\nwomen of the town who attended the theatres; but, as they were not\r\npermitted to send any communication into the interior of the house,\r\ntheir earnings that way were insignificant, for they could only send in\r\nmessages by any other “dress woman” entering the theatre subsequently.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my inquiries last year, I met with a lame woman of\r\nsixty-eight, who had been selling play-bills for the last twelve years.\r\nShe had been, for six or eight months before she adopted that trade,\r\nthe widow of a poor mechanic, a carpenter. She had first thought of\r\nresorting to that means of a livelihood owing to a neighbouring old\r\nwoman having been obliged to relinquish her post from sickness, when\r\nmy informant “succeeded her.” In this way, she said, many persons\r\n“succeeded” to the business, as the recognised old hands were jealous\r\nof and uncivil to any additional new comers, but did not object to a\r\n“successor.” These parties generally know each other; they murmur if\r\nthe Haymarket hands, for instance, resort to the Lyceum for any cause,\r\nor _vice versâ_, thus over-stocking the business, but they offer no\r\nother opposition. The old woman further informed me that she commenced\r\nselling play-bills at Astley’s, and then realized a profit of 4_s._\r\nper week. When the old Amphitheatre was burnt down, she went to the\r\nVictoria; but “business was not what it was,” and her earnings were\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 1_s._ a week less; and this, she said, although the\r\nVictoria was considered one of the most profitable stations for the\r\nplay-bill seller, the box-keeper there seldom selling any bill in the\r\ntheatre. “The boxes,” too, at this house, more frequently buy them\r\noutside. Another reason why “business” was better at the Victoria\r\nthan elsewhere was represented to me, by a person familiar with the\r\ntheatres, to be this: many go to the Victoria who cannot read, or who\r\ncan read but imperfectly, and they love to “make-believe” they are\r\n“good scholards” by parading the consulting of a play-bill!\r\n\r\nOn my visit the bill-sellers at the Victoria were two old women (each\r\na widow for many years), two young men, besides two or three, though\r\nthere are sometimes as many as six or seven children. The old women\r\n“fell into the business” as successors by virtue of their predecessors’\r\nleaving it on account of sickness. The children were generally\r\nconnected with the older dealers. The young men had been in this\r\nbusiness from boyhood; some sticking to the practice of their childhood\r\nunto manhood, or towards old age. The number at the Victoria is now, I\r\nam informed, two or three more, as the theatre is often crowded. The\r\nold woman told me that she had known two and even four visitors to the\r\ntheatre club for the purchase of a bill, and then she had sometimes to\r\nget farthings for them.\r\n\r\nA young fellow--who said he believed he was only eighteen, but\r\ncertainly looked older--told me that he was in the habit of selling\r\nplay-bills, but not regularly, as he sometimes had a job in carrying\r\na board, or delivering bills at a corner, “or the likes o’ that;”--he\r\nfavoured me with his opinion of the merits of the theatres he was\r\npractically acquainted with as regarded their construction for the\r\npurposes of the bill-seller. His mother, who had been dead a few years,\r\nhad sold bills, and had put him into the business. His ambition seemed\r\nto be to become a general bill-sticker. He could not write but could\r\nread very imperfectly.\r\n\r\n“Vy, you see, sir,” he said, “there’s sets off. At the Market\r\n(Haymarket), now, there’s this: there’s only one front, so you may look\r\nsharp about for there goes, boxes, pit, and gallery. The ’Delphis as\r\ngood that way, and so is the Surrey, but them one’s crowded too much.\r\nThe Lyceum’s built shocking orkered. Vy, the boxes is in one street,\r\nand the pit in another, and the gallery in another! It’s true, sir. The\r\npit’s the best customer in most theatres, I think. Ashley’s and the\r\nWick is both spoiled that way--Ashley’s perticler--as the gallery’s a\r\ngood step from the pit and boxes; at the Wick it’s round the corner.\r\nBut the shilling gallery aint so bad at Ashley’s. Sadler’s Wells I\r\nnever tried, it’s out of the way, and I can’t tell you much about the\r\n’Lympic or the Strand. The Lane is middling. I don’t know that either\r\nplays or actors makes much difference to me. Perhaps it’s rather\r\nvorser ven it’s anything werry prime, as everybody seems to know every\r\nthink about it aforehand. No, sir, I can’t say, sir, that Mr. Macready\r\ndid me much good. I sometimes runs along by a cab because I’ve got a\r\nsixpence from a swell for doing it stunnin’, but werry seldom, and I\r\ndon’t much like it; though ven you’re at it you don’t think of no fear.\r\nI makes 3_s._ or rather more a week at bill-selling, and as much other\r\nvays. I never saw a play but once at the Wick. I’d rather be at a Free\r\nand Heasy. I don’t know as I knows any of the actors or actresses,\r\neither hes or shes.”\r\n\r\nThe sellers of play-bills purchase their stock of the printer, at 3_s._\r\n4_d._ the hundred, or in that proportion for half or quarter-hundreds.\r\nIf a smaller quantity be purchased, the charge is usually thirteen\r\nfor 6_d._; though they used to be only twelve for 6_d._ These sellers\r\nare among the poorest of the poor; after they have had one meal, they\r\ndo not know how to get another. They reside in the lowest localities,\r\nand some few are abandoned and profligate in character. They reckon it\r\na good night to earn 1_s._ clear, but upon an average they clear but\r\n3_s._ per week. They lose sometimes by not selling out their nightly\r\nstock. What they have left, they are obliged to sell for waste-paper at\r\n2_d._ per lb. Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide are generally their\r\nbest times--they will then make 9_d._ per night clear. The printer of\r\nthe play-bills prints but a certain number, the demand being nearly\r\nascertained week by week. These are all sold (by the printer or some\r\nperson appointed) to the regular customers, in preference to others,\r\nbut the “irregulars” can get supplied, though often not without\r\ntrouble. The profit on all sold is rather more than cent. per cent. As\r\nI have intimated, when some theatres are closed, the bill-sellers are\r\ndriven to others; and as the demand is necessarily limited, a superflux\r\nof sellers affects the profits, and then 2_s._ 6_d._ is considered a\r\ngood week’s work. During the opera season, I am told, a few mechanics,\r\nout of work, will sell bills there and books of the opera, making about\r\n6_s._ a week, and doing better than the regular hands, as they have a\r\nbetter address and are better clad.\r\n\r\nTaking the profits at 3_s._ a week at cent. per cent. on the\r\noutlay, and reckoning 200 sellers, including those at the saloons,\r\nconcert-rooms, &c., we find that 60_l._ is now expended weekly on\r\nplay-bills purchased in the streets of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PERIODICALS, PAMPHLETS, TRACTS, BOOKS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThese street-sellers are a numerous body, and the majority of them\r\nshow a greater degree of industry and energy than is common to many\r\nclasses of street-folk. They have been for the most part connected\r\nwith the paper, newspaper, or publishing trade, and some of them have\r\n“known better days.” One intelligent man I met with, a dealer in\r\n“waste” (paper), had been brought up as a compositor, but late hours\r\nand glaring gas-lights in the printing-office affected his eyes, he\r\ntold me; and as a half-blind compositor was about of as little value,\r\nhe thought, as a “horse with a wooden leg,” he abandoned his calling\r\nfor out-of-door labour. Another had been a gun-smith, and when out of\r\nhis apprenticeship was considered a “don hand at hair triggers, for\r\nhair triggers were more wanted then,” but an injury to his right hand\r\nand arm had disabled him as a mechanic, and he had recourse to the\r\nstreets. A third had been an ink-maker’s “young man,” and had got to\r\nlike the streets by calling for orders, and delivering bottles of ink,\r\nat the shops of the small stationers and chandlers, and so he had taken\r\nto them for a living. Of the book-stall-keepers I heard of one man who\r\nhad died a short time before, and who “once had been in the habit of\r\nbuying better books for his own pleasure than he had afterwards to sell\r\nfor his bread.” Of the book-stall proprietors, I have afterwards spoken\r\nmore fully.\r\n\r\nAll the street-sellers in question are what street estimation\r\npronounces to be educated men; they can all, as far as I could\r\nascertain, read and write, and some of them were “keenish politicians,\r\nboth free-traders, and against free-trade when they was a-talking of\r\nthe better days when they was young.” Nearly all are married men with\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe divisions into which these street traffickers may be formed\r\nare--Odd Number-sellers--Steamboat Newsvendors--Railway Newsvendors,\r\n(though the latter is now hardly a street traffic),--the Sellers\r\nof Second Editions (which I have already given as a portion of the\r\npatterers)--Board-workers (also previously described, and for the same\r\nreason)--Tract-sellers (of whom I have given the number, character,\r\n&c., and who are regarded by the other street-sellers as the idlers,\r\nbeggars, and pretenders of the trade),--the Sellers of Childrens’ Books\r\nand Song Books--Book-auctioneers, and Book-stall-keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF BACK NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nThis trade is carried on by the same class of patterers as work\r\nrace-cards, second editions, &c. The collectors of waste-paper\r\nfrequently find back numbers of periodicals in “a lot” they may have\r\npurchased at a coffee-shop. These they sell to warehousemen who serve\r\nthe street-sellers. The largest lot ever sold at one time was some six\r\nor seven years ago, of the _Pictorial Times_, at least a ton weight. A\r\ndealer states--\r\n\r\n“I lost the use of this arm ever since I was three months old. My\r\nmother died when I was ten years of age, and after that my father took\r\nup with an Irishwoman, and turned me and my youngest sister (she was\r\ntwo years younger than me) out into the streets. My youngest sister got\r\nemployment at my father’s trade, but I couldn’t get no work because\r\nof my crippled arm. I walked about, till I fell down in the streets\r\nfor want. At last, a man, who had a sweetmeat-shop, took pity on me.\r\nHis wife made the sweetmeats, and minded the shop while he went out\r\na juggling in the streets, in the Ramo Samee line. He told me as how,\r\nif I would go round the country with him and sell a few prints while\r\nhe was a juggling in the public-houses, he’d find me in wittles, and\r\npay my lodging. I joined him, and stopped with him two or three year.\r\nAfter that I went to work for a werry large waste-paper dealer. He\r\nused to buy up all the old back numbers of the cheap periodicals and\r\npenny publications, and send me out with them to sell at a farden’\r\na piece. He used to give me 4_d._ out of every shilling, and I done\r\nvery well with that, till the periodicals came so low, and so many on\r\n’em, that they wouldn’t sell at all. Sometimes I could make 15_s._\r\non a Saturday night and a Sunday morning, a-selling the odd numbers\r\nof periodicals,--such as tales; ‘Tales of the Wars,’ ‘Lives of the\r\nPirates,’ ‘Lives of the Highwaymen,’ &c. I’ve often sold as many as\r\n2,000 numbers on a Saturday night in the New-cut, and the most of them\r\nwas works about thieves, and highwaymen, and pirates. Besides me, there\r\nwas three others at the same business. Altogether, I dare say my master\r\nalone used to get rid of 10,000 copies of such works on a Saturday\r\nnight and a Sunday morning. Our principal customers was young men. My\r\nmaster made a good bit of money at it. He had been about eighteen years\r\nin the business, and had begun with 2_s._ 6_d._ I was with him fifteen\r\nyear, on and off, and at the best time. I used to earn my 30_s._ a week\r\nfull at that time. But then I was foolish, and didn’t take care of my\r\nmoney. When I was at the ‘odd number business,’ I bought a peep-show,\r\nand left the trade to go into that line.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SALE OF WASTE NEWSPAPERS AT BILLINGSGATE.\r\n\r\nThis trade is so far peculiar that it is confined to Billingsgate,\r\nas in that market alone the demand supplies a livelihood to the\r\nman who carries it on. His principal sale is of newspapers to the\r\nstreet-fishmongers, as a large surface of paper is required for the\r\npurposes of a fish-stall. The “waste” trade--for “waste” and not\r\n“waste-paper” is the word always applied--is not carried on with such\r\nfacility as might be expected, for I was assured that “waste” is so\r\nscarce that only a very insufficient supply of paper can at present be\r\nobtained. “I hope things will change soon, sir,” said one collector,\r\ngravely to me, “or I shall hardly be able to keep myself and my family\r\non my waste.”\r\n\r\nThis difficulty, however, does not affect such a street-seller as the\r\nman at Billingsgate, who buys of the collectors--“collecting,” however,\r\na portion himself at the neighbouring coffee-shops, public houses, &c.;\r\nfor the wants of a regular customer must, by some means or other, be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nThe Billingsgate paper-seller carries his paper round, offering it\r\nto his customers, or to those he wishes to make purchasers; some\r\nfishmongers, however, obtain their “waste” first-hand from the\r\ncollectors, or buy it at a news-agent’s.\r\n\r\nThe retail price varies from 2_d._ to 3-1/2_d._ the pound, but\r\n3-1/2_d._ is only given for “very clean and prime, and perhaps uncut,”\r\nnewspapers; for when a newsvendor has, as it is called, “over-stocked”\r\nhimself, he sells the uncut papers at last to the collector, or the\r\n“waste” consumer. This happens, I was told, twenty times as often with\r\nthe “weeklys” as the “dailys;” for, said my informant, “suppose it’s\r\na wet Sunday morning--and all newsvendors as does pray, prays for wet\r\nSundays, because then people stays at home and buys a paper, or some\r\nnumber, to read and pass away the time. Well, sir, suppose it’s a\r\nsoaker in the morning, the newsman buys a good lot, an extra nine, or\r\ntwo extra nines, or the like of that, and then may be, after all, it\r\ncomes out a fine day, and so he’s over-stocked; in which case there’s\r\nsome for the waste.”\r\n\r\nWhen they consider it a favourable opportunity, the workers carry waste\r\nto offer to the Billingsgate salesmen; but the chief trade is in the\r\nhands of the regular frequenter of the market.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information I could obtain, it appears that from 70 to\r\n100 pounds weight of “waste”--about three-fourths being newspapers,\r\nof which some are foreign--is supplied to Billingsgate market and\r\nits visitants. Two numbers of the _Times_, with their supplements,\r\none paper-buyer told me, “when cleverly damped, and they’re never\r\nparticularly dry,” will weigh about a pound. The average price is not\r\nless than 2-1/2_d._ a pound, or from that to 3_d._ A single paper is\r\n1_d._ At 2-1/2_d._ per pound, and 85 pounds a day, upwards of 275_l._\r\nis spent yearly in waste paper at Billingsgate, in the street or\r\nopen-air purchase alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SALE OF PERIODICALS ON THE STEAM-BOATS AND STEAM-BOAT PIERS.\r\n\r\nIn this traffic are engaged about 20 men, “when the days are light\r\nuntil eight o’clock;” from 10 to 15, if the winter be a hard winter;\r\nand if the river steamers are unable to run--none at all. This winter,\r\nhowever, there has been no cessation in the running of the “boats,”\r\nexcept on a few foggy days. The steam-boat paper-sellers are generally\r\ntraders on their own account (all, I believe, have been connected with\r\nthe newsvendors’ trade); some few are the servants of newsvendors, sent\r\nout to deal at the wharfs and on board the boats.\r\n\r\nThe trade is not so remunerative that any payment is made to the\r\nproprietors of the boats or wharfs for the privilege of selling papers\r\nthere (as in the case of the railways), but it is necessary to “obtain\r\nleave,” from those who have authority to give it.\r\n\r\nThe steam-boat paper-seller steps on board a few minutes before the\r\nboat starts, when there are a sufficient number of voyagers assembled.\r\nHe traverses the deck and dives into the cabins, offering his “papers,”\r\nthe titles of which he announces: “Punch, penny Punch, _real_\r\nPunch, last number for 3_d._--comic sheets, a penny--all the London\r\nperiodicals--Guide to the Thames.”\r\n\r\nFrom one of these frequenters of steam-boats for the purposes of his\r\nbusiness, I had the following account:\r\n\r\n“I was a news-agent’s boy, sir, near a pier, for three or four year,\r\nthen I got a start for myself, and now I serve a pier. It’s not such\r\na trade as you might think, still it’s bread and cheese and a drop of\r\nbeer. I go on board to sell my papers. It’s seldom I sell a newspaper;\r\nthere’s no call for it on the river, except at the foreign-going\r\nships--a few as is sold to them--but I don’t serve none on ’em. People\r\nreads the news for nothing at the coffee-shops when they breakfasts,\r\nI s’pose, and goes on as if they took in the _Times_, _Chron_, and\r\n_’Tiser_--pubs. we calls the _’Tiser_--all to their own cheek. It’s\r\npenny works I sell the most of; indeed, it’s very seldom I offer\r\nanything else, ’cause it’s little use. Penny Punches is fair sale, and\r\nI calls it ‘Punch’--just Punch. It’s dead now, I believe, but there’s\r\nold numbers; still they’ll be done in time. The real Punch--I sell from\r\nsix to twelve a week--I call that there as the reel Punch. Galleries\r\nof Comicalities is a middling sale; people take them home with them,\r\nI think. Guides to the Thames is good in summer. They’re illustrated;\r\nbut people sometimes grumbles and calls them catchpennies. It ain’t my\r\nfault if they’re not all that’s expected, but people expects everything\r\nfor 1_d._ Joe Millers and ’Stophelees” (Mephistopheles) “I’ve sold,\r\nand said they was oppositions to Punch; that’s a year or more back,\r\nbut they was old, and to be had cheap. I sell Lloyd’s and Reynolds’s\r\npennies--fairish, both of them; so’s the Family Herald and the London\r\nJournal--very fair. I don’t venture on any three-halfpenny books on\r\nanything like a spec., acause people says at once: ‘A penny--I’ll\r\ngive you a penny.’ I sell seven out of eight of what I do sell to\r\ngents.; more than that, perhaps; for you’ll not often see a woman\r\nbuy nothing wots intended to improve her mind. A young woman, like a\r\nmaid of all work, buys sometimes and looks hard at the paper; but I\r\nsometimes thinks it’s to show she can read. A summer Sunday’s my best\r\ntime, out and out. There’s new faces then, and one goes on bolder.\r\nI’ve known young gents. buy, just to offer to young women, I’m pretty\r\nwell satisfied. It’s a introduction. _I have_ met with real gentlemen.\r\nThey’ve looked over all I offered for sale and then said: ‘Nothing I\r\nwant, my good fellow, but here’s a penny for your trouble.’ I wish\r\nthere was more of them. I do sincerely. Sometimes I’ve gone on board\r\nand not sold one paper. I buy in the regular way, 9_d._ for a dozen\r\n(sometimes thirteen to the dozen) of penny pubs. I don’t know what I\r\nmake, for I keep no count; perhaps a sov. in a good week and a half in\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nI am informed that the average earnings of these traders, altogether,\r\nmay be taken at 15_s._ weekly; calculating that twelve carry on the\r\ntrade the year through, we find that (assuming each man to sell at\r\nthirty-three per cent. profit--though in the case of old works it will\r\nbe cent. per cent.) upwards of 1,500_l._ are expended annually in\r\nsteam-boat papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SALE OF NEWSPAPERS, BOOKS, &C., AT THE RAILWAY STATIONS.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sale of newspapers at the railway termini, &c., cannot\r\nstrictly be classed as a street-sale, it is so far an open-air traffic\r\nas to require some brief notice, and it has now become a trade of no\r\nsmall importance.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of selling to railway-passengers, within the precincts\r\nof the terminus, is disposed of by tender. At present the newsvendor\r\non the North-Western Line, I am informed, pays to the company, for\r\nthe right of sale at the Euston-square terminus, and the provincial\r\nstations, as large a sum as 1,700_l._ per annum. The amount usually\r\ngiven is of course in proportion to the number of stations, and the\r\ntraffic of the railway.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser of this exclusive privilege sends his own servants\r\nto sell the newspapers and books, which he supplies to them in the\r\nquantity required. The men thus engaged are paid from 20_s._ to 30_s._\r\na week, and the boys receive from 6_s._ to 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly, but\r\nrarely 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nAll the morning and evening papers are sold at the Station, but of the\r\nweekly press, those are sent for sale which in the manager’s judgment\r\nare likely to sell, or which his agent informs him are “asked for.” It\r\nis the same with the weekly unstamped publications. The reason seems\r\nobvious; if there be more than can be sold, a dead loss is incurred,\r\nfor the surplusage, as regards newspapers, is only saleable as waste\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe books sold at railways are nearly all of the class best known\r\nas “light reading,” or what some account light reading. The price\r\ndoes not often exceed 1_s._; and among the books offered for sale in\r\nthese places are novels in one volume, published at 1_s._--sometimes\r\nin two volumes, at 1_s._ each; “monthly parts” of works issued in\r\nweekly numbers; shilling books of poetry; but rarely political or\r\ncontroversial pamphlets. One man, who understood this trade, told me\r\nthat “a few of the pamphlets about the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman sold\r\nat first; but in a month or six weeks, people began to say, ‘A shilling\r\nfor that! I’m sick of the thing.’”\r\n\r\nThe large sum given for the privilege of an exclusive sale, shows\r\nthat the number of books and papers sold at railway stations must be\r\nvery considerable. But it must be borne in mind, that the price, and\r\nconsequently the profit on the daily newspapers, sold at the railways,\r\nis greater than elsewhere. None are charged less than 6_d._, the\r\nregular price at a news-agent’s shop being 5_d._, so that as the cost\r\nprice is 4_d._ the profit is double. Nor is it unusual for a passenger\r\nby an early train, who grows impatient for his paper, to cry out,\r\n“A shilling for the _Times_!” This, however, is only the case, I am\r\ntold, with those who start very early in the morning; for the daily\r\npapers are obtained for the railway stations from among the earliest\r\nimpressions, and can be had at the accustomed price as early as six\r\no’clock, although, if there be exciting news and a great demand, a\r\nlarger amount may be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET BOOKSELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe course of my inquiry now leads me to consider one of the oldest,\r\nand certainly not least important of the street traffics--that of\r\nthe book-stalls. Of these there are now about twenty in the London\r\nstreets, but in this number I include only those which are _properly_\r\nstreet-stalls. Many book-stalls, as in such a locality as the\r\nLondon-road, are appendages to shops, being merely a display of wares\r\noutside the bookseller’s premises; and with these I do not now intend\r\nto deal.\r\n\r\nThe men in this trade I found generally to be intelligent. They\r\nhave been, for the most part, engaged in some minor department of\r\nthe book-selling or newspaper trade, in the regular way, and are\r\nunconnected with the street-sellers in other lines, of whose pursuits,\r\nhabits, and characters, they seem to know nothing.\r\n\r\nThe street book-stalls are most frequent in the thoroughfares which are\r\nwell-frequented, but which, as one man in the trade expressed himself,\r\nare not so “shoppy” as others--such as the City-road, the New-road,\r\nand the Old Kent-road. “If there’s what you might call a recess,”\r\nobserved another street book-stall-keeper, “_that’s_ the place for us;\r\nand you’ll often see us along with flower-stands and pinners-up.” The\r\nstalls themselves do not present any very smart appearance; they are\r\nusually of plain deal. If the stock of books be sufficiently ample,\r\nthey are disposed on the surface of the stall, “fronts up,” as I heard\r\nit described, with the titles, when lettered on the back, like as they\r\nare presented in a library. If the “front” be unlettered, as is often\r\nthe case with the older books, a piece of paper is attached, and on\r\nit is inscribed the title and the price. Sometimes the description is\r\nexceeding curt, as, “Poetry,” “French,” “Religious,” “Latin” (I saw an\r\nodd volume, in Spanish, of Don Quixote, marked “Latin,” but it was at\r\na shop-seller’s stall,) “Pamphlets,” and such like; or where it seems\r\nto have been thought necessary to give a somewhat fuller appellation,\r\nsuch titles are written out as “Locke’s Understanding,” “Watts’s Mind,”\r\nor “Pope’s Rape.” If the stock be rather scant, the side of the book\r\nis then shown, and is either covered with white paper, on which the\r\ntitle and price are written, or “brushed,” or else a piece of paper is\r\nattached, with the necessary announcement.\r\n\r\nSometimes these announcements are striking enough, as where a number\r\nof works of the same size have been bound together (which used to be\r\nthe case, I am told, more frequently than it is now); or where there\r\nhas been a series of stories in one volume. One such announcement was,\r\n“Smollett’s Peregrine Pickle Captain Kyd Pirate Prairie Rob of the\r\nBowl Bamfyeld Moore Carew 2_s._” Alongside this miscellaneous volume\r\nwas, “Wilberforce’s Practical View of Christianity, 1_s._;” “Fenelon’s\r\nAventures de Télémaque, plates, 9_d._;” “Arres, de Predestinatione,\r\n1_s._” (the last-mentioned work, which, at the first glance, seems as\r\nif it were an odd mixture of French and Latin, was a Latin quarto);\r\n“Coronis ad Collationem Hagiensem, &c. &c., Gulielmo Amesio.” Another\r\nwork, on another stall, had the following description: “Lord Mount\r\nEdgecumbe’s Opera What is Currency Watts’s Scripture History Thoughts\r\non Taxation only 1_s._ 3_d._” Another was, “Knickerbocker Bacon 1_s._”\r\nAs a rule, however, the correctness with which the work is described is\r\nrather remarkable.\r\n\r\nAt some few of the street-stalls, and at many of the shop-stalls,\r\nare boxes, containing works marked, “All 1_d._,” or 2_d._, 3_d._, or\r\n4_d._ Among these are old Court-Guides, Parliamentary Companions,\r\nRailway Plans, and a variety of sermons, and theological, as well as\r\neducational and political pamphlets. To show the character of the\r\npublications thus offered--not, perhaps, as a rule, but generally\r\nenough, for sale--I copied down the titles of some at 1_d._ and 2_d._\r\n\r\n“_All these at 1d._--‘Letters to the Right Honourable Lord John\r\nRussell, on State Education, by Edward Baines, jun.;’ ‘A Pastoral\r\nLetter to the Clergy and Members of the Protestant Episcopal Church in\r\nthe United States of America;’ ‘A Letter to the Protestant Dissenters\r\nof England and Wales, by the Rev. Robert Ainslie;’ ‘Friendly Advice to\r\nConservatives;’ ‘Elementary Thoughts on the Principles of Currency and\r\nWealth, and on the Means of Diminishing the Burthens of the People, by\r\nJ. D. Basset, Esq., price 2_s._ 6_d._’” The others were each published\r\nat 1_s._\r\n\r\n“_All these at 2d._--‘Poems, by Eleanor Tatlock, 1811, 2 vols., 9_s._;’\r\n‘Two Sermons, on the Fall and Final Restoration of the Jews, by the\r\nRev. John Stuart;’ ‘Thoughts and Feelings, by Arthur Brooke, 1820;’\r\n‘The Amours of Philander and Sylvia, being the third and last part of\r\nLove-letters between a Nobleman and his Sister. Volume the Second. The\r\nSeventh Edition. London.’”\r\n\r\nFrom a cursory examination of the last-mentioned twopenny volume, I\r\ncould see nothing of the nobleman or his sister. It is one of an inane\r\nclass of books, originated, I believe, in the latter part of the reign\r\nof Charles II. Such publications professed to be (and some few were)\r\nrecords of the court and city scandal of the day, but in general they\r\nwere works founded on the reputation of the current scandal. In short,\r\nto adopt the language of patterers, they were “cocks” issued by the\r\npublishers of that period; and they continued to be published until\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, or a little later. I notice\r\nthis description of literature the more, particularly as it is still\r\nfrequently to be met with in street-sale. “There’s oft enough,” one\r\nstreet-bookseller said to me, “works of that sort making up a ‘lot’ at\r\na sale, and in very respectable rooms. As if they were make-weights, or\r\nto make up a sufficient number of books, and so they keep their hold in\r\nthe streets.”\r\n\r\nAs many of my readers may have little, if any, knowledge of this class\r\nof street-sold works, I cite a portion of the “epistle dedicatory,” and\r\na specimen of the style, of “Philander and Sylvia,” to show the change\r\nin street, as well as in general literature, as no such works are now\r\npublished:\r\n\r\n “To the Lord Spencer, My Lord, when a new book comes into the world,\r\n the first thing we consider is the dedication; and according to the\r\n quality and humour of the patron, we are apt to make a judgment of\r\n the following subject. If to a statesman we believe it grave and\r\n politic; if to a gownman, law or divinity; if to the young and gay,\r\n love and gallantry. By this rule, I believe the gentle reader, who\r\n finds your lordship’s name prefixed before this, will make as many\r\n various opinions of it, as they do characters of your lordship, whose\r\n youthful sallies have been the business of so much discourse; and\r\n which, according to the relator’s sense or good nature, is either\r\n aggravated or excused; though the woman’s quarrel to your lordship has\r\n some more reasonable foundation, than that of your own sex; for your\r\n lordship being formed with all the beauties and graces of mankind, all\r\n the charms of wit, youth, and sweetness of disposition (derived to\r\n you from an illustrious race of heroes) adapting you to the noblest\r\n love and softness, they cannot but complain on that mistaken conduct\r\n of yours, that so lavishly deals out those agreeable attractions,\r\n squandering away that youth and time on many, which might be more\r\n advantageously dedicated to some one of the fair; and by a liberty\r\n (which they call not being discreet enough) rob them of all the hopes\r\n of conquest over that heart which they believe can fix no where; they\r\n cannot caress you into tameness; or if you sometimes appear so, they\r\n are still upon their guard with you; for like a young lion you are\r\n ever apt to leap into your natural wildness; the greatness of your\r\n soul disdaining to be confined to lazy repose; though the delicacy of\r\n your person and constitution so absolutely require it; your lordship\r\n not being made for diversions so rough and fatiguing, as those your\r\n active mind would impose upon it.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is very long, so that a shorter extract may serve as\r\na specimen of the staple of this book-making:\r\n\r\n “To Philander,--False and perjured as you are, I languish for a\r\n sight of you, and conjure you to give it me as soon as this comes to\r\n your hands. Imagine not that I have prepared those instruments of\r\n revenge that are so justly due to your perfidy; but rather, that I\r\n have yet too tender sentiments for you, in spite of the outrage you\r\n have done my heart; and that for all the ruin you have made, I still\r\n adore you; and though I know you are now another’s slave, yet I beg\r\n you would vouchsafe to behold the spoils you have made, and allow me\r\n this recompense for all, to say--Here was the beauty I once esteemed,\r\n though now she is no more Philander’s Sylvia.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus described what may be considered the divisional parts of\r\nthis stall trade, I proceed to the more general character of the class\r\nof books sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHARACTER OF BOOKS OF THE STREET-SALE.\r\n\r\nThere has been a change, and in some respects a considerable change, in\r\nthe character or class of books sold at the street-stalls, within the\r\nlast 40 or 50 years, as I have ascertained from the most experienced\r\nmen in the trade. Now sermons, or rather the works of the old divines,\r\nare rarely seen at these stalls, or if seen, are rarely purchased.\r\nBlack-letter editions are very unfrequent at street book-stalls, and\r\nit is twenty times more difficult, I am assured, for street-sellers to\r\npick up anything really rare and curious, than it was in the early part\r\nof the century.\r\n\r\nOne reason assigned for this change by an intelligent street-seller\r\nwas, that black-letter or any ancient works, were almost all purchased\r\nby the second-hand booksellers, who have shops and issue catalogues,\r\nas they had a prompt sale for them whenever they could pick them up\r\nat book-auctions or elsewhere. “Ay, indeed,” said another book-stall\r\nkeeper, “anything scarce or curious, when it’s an old book, is kept out\r\nof the streets; if it’s not particular decent, sir,” (with a grin),\r\n“why it’s reckoned all the more curious,--that’s the word, sir, I\r\nknow,--‘curious.’ I can tell how many beans make five as well as you or\r\nanybody. Why, now, there’s a second-hand bookseller not a hundred miles\r\nfrom Holborn--and a pleasant, nice man he is, and does a respectable\r\nbusiness--and he puts to the end of his catalogue--they all have\r\ncatalogues that’s in a good way--two pages that he calls ‘Facetiæ.’\r\nThey’re titles and prices of queer old books in all languages--indecent\r\nbooks, indeed. He sends his catalogues to a many clergymen and learned\r\npeople; and to any that he thinks wouldn’t much admire seeing his\r\n‘Facetiæ,’ he pulls the last leaf out, and sends his catalogue, looking\r\nfinished without it. Those last two pages aren’t at all the worst part\r\nof his trade among buyers that’s worth money.”\r\n\r\nIn one respect a characteristic of this trade is unaltered; I allude\r\nto the prevalence of “odd volumes” at the cheaper stalls,--not the odd\r\nvolumes of a novel, but more frequently of one of the essayists--the\r\n“Spectator” especially. One stall-keeper told me, that if he purchased\r\nan old edition of the “Spectator,” in eight vols., he could more\r\nreadily sell it in single volumes, at 4_d._ each, than sell the eight\r\nvols. altogether for 2_s._, or even 1_s._ 4_d._, though this was but\r\n2_d._ a volume.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing in my trade,” said one street-bookseller with whom I\r\nconversed on the subject, “that sells better, or indeed so well, as\r\nEnglish classics. I can’t offer to draw fine distinctions, and I’m just\r\nspeaking of my own plain way of trade; but _I_ call English classics\r\nsuch works as the ‘Spectator,’ ‘Tatler,’ ‘Guardian,’ ‘Adventurer,’\r\n‘Rambler,’ ‘Rasselas,’ ‘The Vicar of Wakefield,’ ‘Peregrine Pickle,’\r\n‘Tom Jones,’ ‘Goldsmith’s Histories of Greece, Rome, and England’\r\n(they all sell quick), ‘Enfield’s Speaker,’ ‘mixed plays,’ the\r\n‘Sentimental Journey,’ no, sir, ‘Tristram Shandy,’ rather hangs on\r\nhand, the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ (but it must be sold _very_ low),\r\n‘Robinson Crusoe,’ ‘Philip Quarles,’ ‘Telemachus,’ ‘Gil Blas,’ and\r\n‘Junius’s Letters.’ I don’t remember more at this moment, such as\r\nare of good sale. I haven’t included poetry, because I’m speaking\r\nof English classics, and of course they must be oldish works to be\r\nclassics.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the street sale of poetical works I learned from street\r\nbook-sellers, that their _readiest_ sale was of volumes of Shakespeare,\r\nPope, Thomson, Goldsmith, Cowper, Burns, Byron, and Scott. “You must\r\nrecollect, sir,” said one dealer, “that in nearly all those poets\r\nthere’s a double chance for sale at book-stalls. For what with old\r\neditions, and new and cheap editions, there’s always plenty in the\r\nmarket, and very low. No, I can’t say I could sell Milton as quickly as\r\nany of those mentioned, nor ‘Hudibras,’ nor ‘Young’s Night Thoughts,’\r\nnor Prior, nor Dryden, nor ‘Gay’s Fables.’ It’s seldom that we have\r\nany works of Hood, or Shelley, or Coleridge, or Wordsworth, or Moore\r\nat street stalls--you don’t often see them, I think, at booksellers’\r\nstalls--for they’re soon picked up. Poetry sells very fair, take it\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\nAnother dealer told me that from twenty to thirty years ago there were\r\nat the street-stalls a class of works rarely seen now. He had known\r\nthem in all parts and had disposed of them in his own way of business.\r\nHe specified the “Messiah” (Klopstock’s) as of this class, the “Death\r\nof Abel,” the “Castle of Otranto” (“but that’s seen occasionally\r\nstill,” he observed), the “Old English Baron” (“and that’s seen\r\nstill too, but nothing to what it were once”), the “Young Man’s Best\r\nCompanion,” “Zimmerman on Solitude,” and “Burke on the Sublime and\r\nBeautiful” (“but I have that yet sometimes.”) These works were of heavy\r\nsale in the streets, and my informant thought they had been thrown into\r\nthe street-trade because the publishers had not found them saleable in\r\nthe regular way. “I was dead sick of the ‘Death of Abel,’” observed the\r\nman, “before I could get out of him.” Occasionally are to be seen at\r\nmost of the stalls, works of which the majority of readers have heard,\r\nbut may not have met with. Among such I saw “Laura,” by Capel Lloftt,\r\n4 vols. 1_s._ 6_d._ “Darwin’s Botanic Garden,” 2_s._ “Alfred, an Epic\r\nPoem,” by H. J. Pye, Poet Laureate, 10_d._ “Cœlebs in search of a\r\nWife,” 2 vols. in one, 1_s._\r\n\r\nThe same informant told me that he had lived near an old man who died\r\ntwenty-five years ago, or it might be more, with whom he was somewhat\r\nintimate. This old man had been all his life familiar with the street\r\ntrade in books, which he had often hawked--a trade now almost unknown;\r\nhis neighbour had heard him say that fifty to seventy years ago, he\r\nmade his two guineas a week “without distressing hisself,” meaning, I\r\nwas told, that he was drinking every Monday at least. This old man used\r\nto tell that in his day, the “Whole Duty of Man,” and the “Tale of a\r\nTub,” and “Pomfret’s Poems,” and “Pamela,” and “Sir Charles Grandison”\r\nwent off _well_, but “Pamela” the best. “And I’ve heard the old man\r\nsay, sir,” I was further told, “how he had to tread his shoes straight\r\nabout what books he showed publicly. He sold ‘Tom Paine’ on the sly. If\r\nanybody bought a book and would pay a good price for it, three times\r\nas much as was marked, he’d _give_ the ‘Age of Reason’ in. I never see\r\nit now, but I don’t suppose anybody would interfere if it was offered.\r\nA sly trade’s always the best for paying, and for selling too. The old\r\nfellow used to laugh and say his stall was quite a godly stall, and he\r\nwasn’t often without a copy or two of the ‘Anti-Jacobin Review,’ which\r\nwas all for Church and State and all that, though he had ‘Tom Paine’ in\r\na drawer.”\r\n\r\nThe books sold at the street-stalls are purchased by the retailers\r\neither at the auctions of the regular trade, or at “chance,” or general\r\nauctions, or of the Jews or others who may have bought books cheap\r\nunder such circumstances. Often, however, the stall-keeper has a market\r\npeculiarly his own. It is not uncommon for working men or tradesmen, if\r\nthey become “beaten-down and poor” to carry a basket-full of books to\r\na stall-keeper, and say, “Here, give me half-a-crown for these.” One\r\nman had forty parts, each issued at 1_s._, of a Bible, offered to him\r\nat 1_d._ a part, by a mechanic who could not any longer afford to “take\r\nthem in,” and was at last obliged to sell off what he had. Of course\r\nsuch things are nearly valueless when imperfect. Very few works are\r\nbought for street-stall sale of the regular booksellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EXPERIENCE OF A STREET BOOK-SELLER.\r\n\r\nI now give a statement, furnished to me by an experienced man, as to\r\nthe nature of his trade, and the class of his customers. Most readers\r\nwill remember having seen an account in the life of some poor scholar,\r\nhaving read--and occasionally, in spite of the remonstrances of the\r\nstall-keeper--some work which he was too needy to purchase, and even of\r\nhis having read it through at intervals. That something of this kind is\r\nstill to be met with will be found from the following account:\r\n\r\n“My customers, sir, are of all sorts,” my informant said. “They’re\r\ngentlemen on their way from the City, that have to pass along here\r\nby the City-road. Bankers’ clerks, very likely, or insurance-office\r\nclerks, or such like. They’re fairish customers, but they often screw\r\nme. Why only last month a gentleman I know very well by sight, and\r\nI see him pass in his brougham in bad weather, took up an old Latin\r\nbook--if I remember right it was an odd volume of a French edition\r\nof Horace--and though it was marked only 8_d._, it was long before\r\nhe would consent to give more than 6_d._ And I should never have got\r\nmy price if I hadn’t heard him say quite hastily, when he took up\r\nthe book, ‘The very thing I’ve long been looking for!’ Mechanics are\r\ncapital customers for scientific or trade books, such as suit their\r\nbusiness; and so they often are for geography and history, and some\r\nfor poetry; but _they’re_ not so screwy. I know a many such who are\r\nrare ones for searching into knowledge. Women buy very little of me\r\nin comparison to men; sometimes an odd novel, in one volume, when its\r\ncheap, such as ‘The Pilot,’ or ‘The Spy,’ or ‘The Farmer of Inglewood\r\nForest,’ or ‘The Monk.’ No doubt some buy ‘The Monk,’ not knowing\r\nexactly what sort of a book it is, but just because it’s a romance;\r\nbut some young men buy it, I know, because they have learned what sort\r\nit’s like. Old three vol. novels won’t sell at all, if they’re ever so\r\ncheap. Boys very seldom buy of me, unless it’s a work about pigeons, or\r\nsomething that way.\r\n\r\n“I can’t say that odd vols. of Annual Registers are anything but a bad\r\nsale, but odd vols. of old Mags. (magazines), a year or half-year bound\r\ntogether, are capital. Old London Mags., or Ladies’, or Oxford and\r\nCambridges, or Town and Countrys, or Universals, or Monthly Reviews,\r\nor Humourists, or Ramblers, or Europeans, or any of any sort, that’s\r\nfrom 40 to 100 years old, no matter what they are, go off rapidly at\r\nfrom 1_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ each, according to size, and binding,\r\nand condition. Odd numbers of Mags. are good for little at a stall. The\r\nold Mags. in vols. are a sort of reading a great many are very fond of.\r\nLives of the Princess Charlotte are a ready penny enough. So are Queen\r\nCarolines, but not so good. Dictionaries of all kinds are nearly as\r\nselling as the old Mags., and so are good Latin books. French are only\r\nmiddling; not so well as you might think.”\r\n\r\nMy informant then gave me a similar account to what I had previously\r\nreceived concerning English classics, and proceeded: “Old religious\r\nbooks, they’re a fair trade enough, but they’re not so plentiful on\r\nthe stalls now, and if they’re black-letter they don’t find their way\r\nfrom the auctions or anywhere to any places but the shops or to private\r\npurchasers. Mrs. Rowe’s ‘Knowledge of the Heart’ goes off, if old.\r\nBibles, and Prayer-books, and Hymn-books, are very bad.” [This may be\r\naccounted for by the cheapness of these publications, when new, and\r\nby the facilities afforded to obtain them gratuitously.] “Annuals are\r\ndull in going off; very much so, though one might expect different.\r\nI can hardly sell ‘Keepsakes’ at all. Children’s books, such as are\r\nout one year at 2_s._ 6_d._ apiece, very nicely got up, sell finely\r\nnext year at the stalls for from 6_d._ to 10_d._ Genteel people buy\r\nthem of us for presents at holiday times. They’ll give an extra penny\r\nquite cheerfully if there’s ‘Price 2_s._ 6_d._’ or ‘Price 3_s._ 6_d._’\r\nlettered on the back or part of the title-page. School-books in good\r\ncondition don’t stay long on hand, especially Pinnock’s. There’s not\r\na few people who stand and read and read for half an hour or an hour\r\nat a time. It’s very trying to the temper when they take up room that\r\nway, and prevent others seeing the works, and never lay out a penny\r\ntheirselves. But they seem quite lost in a book. Well, I’m sure I don’t\r\nknow what they are. Some seem very poor, judging by their dress, and\r\nsome seem shabby genteels. I can’t help telling them, when I see them\r\ngoing, that I’m much obliged, and I hope that perhaps next time they’ll\r\nmanage to say ‘thank ye,’ for they don’t open their lips once in twenty\r\ntimes. I know a man in the trade that goes dancing mad when he has\r\ncustomers of this sort, who aren’t customers. I dare say, one day with\r\nanother, I earn 3_s._ the year through; wet days are greatly against\r\nus, for if we have a cover people won’t stop to look at a stall.\r\nPerhaps the rest of my trade earn the same.” This man told me that he\r\nwas not unfrequently asked, and by respectable people, for indecent\r\nworks, but he recommended them to go to Holywell-street themselves. He\r\nbelieved that some of his fellow-traders _did_ supply such works, but\r\nto no great extent.\r\n\r\nAn elderly man, who had known the street book-trade for many years,\r\nbut was not concerned in it when I saw him, told me that he was\r\nsatisfied he had sold old books, old plays often, to Charles Lamb,\r\nwhom he described as a stuttering man, who, when a book suited him,\r\nsometimes laid down the price, and smiled and nodded, and then\r\nwalked away with it in his pocket or under his arm, without a word\r\nhaving been exchanged. When we came to speak of dates, I found that\r\nmy informant--who had only conjectured that this was Lamb--was\r\nunquestionably mistaken. One of the best customers he ever had for\r\nanything old or curious, and in Italian, if he remembered rightly, as\r\nwell as in English, was the late Rev. Mr. Scott, who was chaplain on\r\nboard the Victory, at the time of Nelson’s death at Trafalgar. “He had\r\na living in Yorkshire, I believe it was,” said the man, “and used to\r\ncome up every now and then to town. I was always glad to see his white\r\nhead and rosy face, and to have a little talk with him about books and\r\ntrade, though it wasn’t always easy to catch what he said, for he spoke\r\nquick, and not very distinct. But he was a pleasant old gentleman, and\r\ntalked to a poor man as politely as he might to an admiral. He was very\r\nwell known in my trade, as I was then employed.”\r\n\r\nThe same man once sold to a gentleman, he told me, and he believed it\r\nwas somewhere about twenty-five years ago, if not more, a Spanish or\r\nPortuguese work, but what it was he did not know. It was marked 1_s._\r\n9_d._, being a good-sized book, but the stall-keeper was tired of\r\nhaving had it a long time, so that he gladly would have taken 9_d._ for\r\nit. The gentleman in question handed him half-a-crown, and, as he had\r\nnot the change, the purchaser said: “O, don’t mind; it’s worth far\r\nmore than half-a-crown to me.” When this liberal customer had walked\r\naway, a gentleman who had been standing at the stall all the time, and\r\nwho was an occasional buyer, said, “Do you know him?” and, on receiving\r\nan answer in the negative, he rejoined, “That’s Southey.”\r\n\r\nAnother stall-keeper told me that his customers--some of whom he\r\nsupplied with any periodical in the same way as a newsvendor--had now\r\nand then asked him, especially “the ladies of the family,” who glanced,\r\nwhen they passed, at the contents of his stall, why he had not newer\r\nworks? “I tell them,” said the stall-keeper, “that they haven’t become\r\ncheap enough yet for the streets, but that they would come to it in\r\ntime.” After some conversation about his trade, which only confirmed\r\nthe statements I have given, he said laughingly, “Yes, indeed, you\r\nall come to such as me at last. Why, last night I heard a song about\r\nall the stateliest buildings coming to the ivy, and I thought, as I\r\nlistened, it was the same with authors. The best that the best can do\r\nis the book-stall’s food at last. And no harm, for he’s in the best of\r\ncompany, with Shakespeare, and all the great people.”\r\n\r\nCalculating 15_s._ weekly as the average earnings of the street\r\nbook-stall keepers--for further information induces me to think that\r\nthe street bookseller who earned 18_s._ a week regularly, cleared it\r\nby having a “tidy pitch”--and reckoning that, to clear such an amount,\r\nthe bookseller takes, at least, 1_l._ 11_s._ 6_d._ weekly, we find\r\n5,460 guineas yearly expended in the purchase of books at the purely\r\nstreet-stalls, independently of what is laid out at the open-air stalls\r\nconnected with book-shops.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STREET BOOK-AUCTIONEERS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of books by auction, in the streets, is now inconsiderable\r\nand irregular. The “auctioning” of books--I mean of new books--some of\r\nwhich were published principally with a view to their sale by auction,\r\nwas, thirty to forty years ago, systematic and extensive. It was not\r\nstrictly a street-sale. The auctioneer offered his books to the public,\r\nnine cases out of ten, in town, in an apartment (now commonly known as\r\na “mock-auction room”), which was so far a portion of the street that\r\naccess was rendered easier by the removal of the door and window of any\r\nroom on a ground-floor, and some of the bidders could and did stand\r\nin the street and take part in the proceedings. In the suburbs--which\r\nat that period were not so integral a portion of the metropolis as at\r\npresent--the book-auction sales were carried on strictly in the open\r\nair, generally in front of a public-house, and either on a platform\r\nerected for the purpose, or from a covered cart; the books then being\r\ndeposited in the vehicle, and the auctioneer standing on a sort of\r\nstage placed on the propped-up shafts. In the country, however, the\r\nauction was often carried on in an inn.\r\n\r\nThe works thus sold were generally standard works. The poems were\r\nthose of Pope, Young, Thomson, Goldsmith, Falconer, Cowper, &c. The\r\nprose writings were such works as “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” “The\r\nTravels of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver,” “Johnson’s Lives of the Poets,”\r\n“The Vicar of Wakefield,” the most popular of the works of Defoe,\r\nFielding, and Smollett, and “Hervey’s Meditations among the Tombs”\r\n(at one time highly popular). These books were not correctly printed,\r\nthey were printed, too, on inferior paper, and the frontispiece--when\r\nthere _was_ a frontispiece--was often ridiculous. But they certainly\r\ngave to the public what is called an “impetus” for reading. Some were\r\npublished in London (chiefly by the late Mr. Tegg, who at one time,\r\nI am told, himself “offered to public competition,” by auction, the\r\nworks he published); others were printed in Edinburgh, Aberdeen,\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, Ipswich, Bungay, &c.\r\n\r\nOne of my informants remembered being present at a street-sale, about\r\ntwenty or thirty years ago; he perfectly remembered, however, the\r\noratory of the auctioneer, of whom he purchased some books. The sale\r\nwas in one of the streets in Stoke Newington, a door or two from a\r\nthoroughfare. My informant was there--as he called it--“accidentally,”\r\nand knew little of the neighbourhood. The auctioneer stood at the\r\ndoor of what appeared to have been a coach-house, and sold his books,\r\nwhich were arranged within, very rapidly: “Byron,” he exclaimed; “Lord\r\nByron’s latest and best po’ms. Sixpence! Sixpence! Eightpence! I take\r\npenny bids under a shilling. Eightpence for the poems written by a\r\nlord--Gone! Yours, sir” (to my informant). The auctioneer, I was told,\r\n“spoke very rapidly, and clipped many of his words.” The work thus\r\nsold consisted of some of Byron’s minor poems. It was in the pamphlet\r\nform, and published, I have no doubt, surreptitiously; for there was,\r\nin those days, a bold and frequent piracy of any work which was thought\r\ndistasteful to the Government, or to which the Court of Chancery might\r\nbe likely to refuse the protection of the law of copyright.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer went on: “Coop’r--Coop’r! Published at 3_s._ 6_d._, as\r\nprinted on the back. Superior to Byron--Coop’r’s ‘Task.’ No bidders?\r\nThank you, sir. One-and-six,--your’s, sir. Young--‘Young’s Night\r\nThoughts. Life, Death, and Immortality,’--great subjects. London\r\nedition, marked 3_s._ 6_d._ Going!--last bidder--two shillings--gone!”\r\nThe purchaser then complained that the frontispiece--a man seated on\r\na tombstone--was exactly the same as to a copy he had of “Hervey’s\r\nMeditations,” but the auctioneer said it was impossible.\r\n\r\nI have thus shown what _was_ the style and nature of the address of\r\nthe street book-auctioneer, formerly, to the public. If it were not\r\nstrictly “patter,” or “pompous oration,” it certainly partook of some\r\nof the characteristics of patter. At present, however, the street\r\nbook-auctioneer may be described as a true patterer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-STATIONER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the account I have given, that the books were\r\nthen really “sold by auction”--knocked down to the highest bidder.\r\nThis however was, and is not always the case. Legally to sell by\r\nauction, necessitates the obtaining of a licence, at an annual cost\r\nof 5_l._; and if the bookseller conveys his stock of books from place\r\nto place, a hawker’s licence is required as well,--which entails an\r\nadditional expenditure of 4_l._ The itinerant bookseller evades, or\r\nendeavours to evade, the payment for an auctioneer’s licence, by\r\n“putting-up” his books at a high price, and _himself_ decreasing the\r\nterms, instead of offering them at a low price, and allowing _the\r\npublic_ to make a series of “advances.” Thus, a book may be offered by\r\na street-auctioneer at half-a-crown--two shillings--eighteenpence--a\r\nshilling--tenpence, and the moment any one assents to a specified sum,\r\nthe volume handed to him; so that there is no competition--no bidding\r\nby the public one in advance of another. Auction, however, is resorted\r\nto as often as the bookseller dares.\r\n\r\nOne experienced man in the book-stall trade calculated that twenty\r\nyears ago there might be twelve book-auctioneers in the streets of\r\nLondon, or rather, of its suburbs. One of these was a frequenter of\r\nthe Old Kent-road; another, “Newington way;” and a third resorted to\r\n“any likely pitch in Pimlico”--all selling from a sort of van. Of\r\nthese twelve, however, my informant thought that there were never\r\nmore than six in London at one time, as they were all itinerant; and\r\nthey have gradually dwindled down to two, who are now not half their\r\ntime in town. These two traders are brothers, and sell their books\r\nfrom a sort of platform erected on a piece of waste-ground, or from a\r\nbarrow. The works they sell are generally announced as new, and are\r\noften uncut. They are all recommended as explanatory of every topic of\r\nthe day, and are often set forth as “spicy.” Three or four years ago,\r\na gentleman told me how greatly he was amused with the patter of one\r\nof these men, who was selling books at the entrance of a yard full of\r\ncaravans, not far from the School for the Blind, Lambeth. One work the\r\nstreet-auctioneer announced at the top of his voice, in the following\r\nterms, as far as a good memory could retain them: “‘The Rambler!’ Now\r\nyou rambling boys--now you young devils, that’s been staring those\r\npretty girls out of countenance--here’s the very book for you, and\r\nmore shame for you, and perhaps for me too; but I must sell--I must do\r\nbusiness. If any lady or gen’lman’ll stand treat to a glass of brandy\r\nand water, ‘warm with,’ I’ll tell more about this ‘Rambler’--I’m too\r\nbashful, as it is. Who bids? Fifteen-pence--thank’ee, sir. Sold again!”\r\nThe “Rambler” was Dr. Johnson’s!\r\n\r\nThe last time one of my informants heard the “patter” of the\r\nsmartest of the two brothers, it was to the following effect: “Here\r\nis the ‘History of the Real Flying Dutchman,’ and _no_ mistake; no\r\nfiction, I assure you, upon my honour. Published at 10_s._--who bids\r\nhalf-a-crown? Sixpence; thank you, sir. Ninepence; going--going! Any\r\nmore?--gone!”\r\n\r\nA book-stall-keeper, who had sold goods to a book-auctioneer, and\r\nattended the sales, told me he was astonished to hear how his own\r\nbooks--“old new books,” he called them, were set off by the auctioneer:\r\n“Why, there was a vol. lettered ‘Pamphlets,’ and I think there _was_\r\nsomething about Jack Sheppard in it, but it was all odds and ends of\r\nother things, I know. ‘Here’s the _real_ Jack Sheppard,’ sings out the\r\nman, ‘and no gammon!’ The real edition--no spooniness here, but set off\r\nwith other interesting histories, valuable for the rising generation\r\nand all generations. This is the real Jack. This will\r\n\r\n    ‘----put you up to the time o’ day,\r\n  Nix, my dolly pals, _bid_ away.’\r\n\r\n“Then he went on: ‘Goldsmith’s History of England. Continued by the\r\nfirst writers of the day--to the very last rumpus in the palace, and no\r\nmistake. Here it is; genuine.’ Well, sir,” the stall-keeper continued,\r\n“the man didn’t do well; perhaps he cleared 1_s._ 6_d._ or a little\r\nmore that evening on books. People laughed more than they bought. But\r\nit’s no wonder the trade’s going to the dogs--they’re not allowed to\r\nhave a pitch now; I shouldn’t be surprised if they was not _all_ driven\r\nout of London next year. It’s contrary to Act of Parliament to get an\r\nhonest living in the streets now-a-days.”\r\n\r\nA man connected with the street book-trade considered that if one of\r\nthese auctioneers earned a guinea in London streets in the six days it\r\nwas a “good week.” Half-a-guinea was nearer the average, he thought,\r\n“looking at the weather and everything.” What amount is expended to\r\nenable this street-dealer to earn his guinea or half-guinea, is so\r\nuncertain, from the very nature of an auction, that I can obtain no\r\ndata to rely upon.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant book-auctioneer is now confined chiefly to the provincial\r\ntowns, and especially the country markets. The reason for this is\r\ncorrectly given in the statement above cited. The street-auction\r\nrequires the gathering of so large a crowd that the metropolitan police\r\nconsider the obstruction to the public thoroughfares warrants their\r\ninterference. The two remaining book-auctioneers in London generally\r\nrestrict their operations to the outskirts--the small space which\r\nfronts “the George Inn” in the Commercial-road, and which lays a few\r\nyards behind the main thoroughfare, and similar suburban “retreats”\r\nbeing favourite “pitches.” The trade is, as regards profits, far\r\nfrom bad--the books sold consisting chiefly of those picked up in\r\ncheap “lots” at the regular auctions; so that what fetches 6_d._\r\nin the streets has generally been purchased for less than a penny.\r\nThe average rate of profit may be taken at 250_l._ per cent. at the\r\nleast. Exorbitant however as this return may appear, still it should\r\nbe remembered that the avocation is one that can be pursued only\r\noccasionally, and that solely in fine weather. Books are now more\r\nfrequently sold in the London streets from barrows. This change of\r\ntraffic has been forced upon the street-sellers by the commands of\r\nthe police--that the men should “keep moving.” Hence the well-known\r\nlight form of street conveyance is now fast superseding not only the\r\nbook-auctioneer, but the book-stall in the London streets. Of these\r\nbook-barrowmen there is now about fifty trading regularly in the\r\nmetropolis, and taking on an average from 3_s._ to 5_s._ 6_d._ a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SALE OF SONG-BOOKS, AND OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of song-books in the streets, at 1_d._ and at 1/2_d._ each,\r\nis smaller than it was two years ago. One reason that I heard assigned\r\nwas that the penny song-books--styled “The Universal Song-book,” “The\r\nNational,” “The Bijou,” &c.--were reputed to be so much alike (the same\r\nsongs under a different title), that people who had bought one book\r\nwere averse to buy another. “There’s the ‘Ross’ and the ‘Sam Hall’\r\nsong-books,” said one man, “the ‘eighteenth series,’ and I don’t know\r\nwhat; but I don’t like to venture on working them, though they’re only\r\na penny. There’s lots to be seen in the shop-windows; but they might be\r\nstopped in the street, for they an’t decent--’specially the flash ones.”\r\n\r\nOne of the books which a poor man had found the most saleable is\r\nentitled, “The Great Exhibition Song-book; a Collection of the Newest\r\nand Most Admired Songs. Embellished with upwards of one Hundred Toasts\r\nand Sentiments.” The toasts and sentiments are given in small type, as\r\na sort of border to the thirty-two pages of which the book consists.\r\nThe toast on the title-page is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I’ll toast England’s daughters, let all fill their glasses,\r\n  Whose beauty and virtue the whole world surpasses.”\r\n\r\nTo show the nature of the songs in street demand, I cite those in\r\nthe book: “The Gathering of the Nations,” “Bloom is on the Rye,”\r\n“Wilt thou Meet me there, Love?” “Minna’s Tomb,” “I’ll Love thee ever\r\nDearly” (Arnold), “When Phœbus wakes the Rosy Hours,” “Money is your\r\nFriend,” “Julia and Caspar” (G. M. Lewis), “That pretty word, Yes” (E.\r\nMackey), “Farewell, Forget me Not,” “The Queen and the Navy” (music\r\npublished by H. White, Great Marlborough-street), “I resign Thee every\r\nToken” (music published by Duff and Co.), “Sleep, gentle Lady;” a\r\nserenade (H. J. Payne), “The Warbling Waggoner,” “The Keepsake,” “A\r\nSequel to the Cavalier,” “There’s room enough for All” (music at Mr.\r\nDavidson’s), “Will you Come to the Dale?” “Larry O’Brian,” “Woman’s\r\nLove,” “Afloat on the Ocean” (sung by Mr. Weiss, in the Opera of the\r\n“Heart of Mid Lothian,” music published by Jefferys, Soho-square),\r\n“Together, Dearest, let us Fly” (sung by Mr. Braham, in the Opera of\r\nthe “Heart of Mid Lothian,” music published by Jefferys, Soho-square),\r\n“The Peremptory Lover” (Tune--“John Anderson, my Joe”). There are\r\nforty-seven songs in addition to those whose titles I have quoted, but\r\nthey are all of the same character.\r\n\r\nThe penny song-books (which are partly indecent), and entitled the “Sam\r\nHall” and “Ross” Songsters, are seldom or never sold in the streets.\r\nMany of those vended in the shops outrage all decency. Some of these\r\nare styled the “Coal-Hole Companion,” “Cider-Cellar Songs,” “Captain\r\nMorris’s Songs,” &c. (the filthiest of all.) These are generally marked\r\n1_s._ and sold at 6_d._; and have a coloured folded frontispiece. They\r\nare published chiefly by H. Smith, Holywell-street. The titles of some\r\nof the songs in these works are sufficient to indicate their character.\r\n“The Muff,” “The Two Miss Thys,” “George Robins’s Auction,” “The Woman\r\nthat studied the Stars,” “A Rummy Chaunt” (frequently with no other\r\ntitle), “The Amiable Family,” “Joe Buggins’ Wedding,” “Stop the Cart,”\r\n“The Mot that can feel for another,” “The Irish Giant,” “Taylor Tim,”\r\n“The Squire and Patty.”\r\n\r\nSome titles are unprintable.\r\n\r\nThe children’s books in best demand in the street-trade, are those\r\nwhich have long been popular: “Cinderella,” “Jack the Giant-killer,”\r\n“Baron Munchausen,” “Puss and the Seven-leagued Boots,” “The Sleeping\r\nBeauty,” “The Seven Champions of Christendom,” &c. &c. “There’s plenty\r\nof ‘Henry and Emmas,’” said a penny bookseller, “and ‘A Present for\r\nChristmas,’ and ‘Pictorial Alphabets,’ and ‘Good Books for Good Boys\r\nand Girls;’ but when people buys really for their children, they buys\r\nthe old stories--at least they does of me. I’ve sold ‘Penny Hymns’\r\n(hymn-books) sometimes; but when they’re bought, or ‘Good Books’ is\r\nbought, it’s from charity to a poor fellow like me, more than anything\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\nThe trade, both in songs and in children’s books, is carried on in much\r\nthe same way as I have described of the almanacks and memorandum-books,\r\nbut occasionally the singers of ballads sell books. Sometimes poor\r\nmen, old or infirm, offer them in a tone which seems a whine for\r\ncharity rather than an offer for sale, “Buy a penny book of a poor old\r\nman--very hungry, very hungry.” Children do the same, and all far more\r\nfrequently in the suburbs than in the busy parts of the metropolis.\r\nThose who purchase really for the sake of the books, say, one\r\nstreet-seller told me, “Give me something that’ll interest a child, and\r\nset him a-thinking. They can’t understand--poor little things!--your\r\nfine writing; do you understand that?” Another man had said, “Fairy\r\ntales! bring me nothing but fairies; they set children a-reading.”\r\nThe price asked is most frequently a penny, but some are offered at a\r\nhalfpenny, which is often given (without a purchase) out of compassion,\r\nor to be rid of importunity. The profit is at least cent. per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF ACCOUNT-BOOKS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of account-books is in the hands of about the same class of\r\nstreet-sellers as the stationery, but one man in the trade thought the\r\nregular hands were more trusted, if anything, than street-stationers.\r\n“People, you see,” he said, “won’t buy their ‘accounts’ of _raff_;\r\nthey won’t have them of any but respectable people.” The books sold\r\nare bought at 4_s._ the dozen, or 4-1/2_d._ a piece, up to 70_s._ the\r\ndozen, or 5_s._ 9_d._, or 6_s._ a piece. It is rarely, however, that\r\nthe street account-bookseller gives 4_s._ 9_d._, and very rarely that\r\nhe gives as much as 5_s._ 9_d._ for his account-books. His principal\r\nsale is of the smaller “waste,” or “day-books,” kept by the petty\r\ntraders; the average price of these being 1_s._ 9_d._ The principal\r\npurchasers are the chandlers, butchers, &c., in the quieter streets,\r\nand more especially “a little way out of town, where there ain’t so\r\nmany cheap shops.” A man, now a street-stationer, with a “fixed pitch,”\r\nhad carried on the account-book trade until an asthmatic affliction\r\ncompelled him to relinquish it, as the walking became impossible to\r\nhim, and he told me that the street-trade was nothing to what it\r\nonce was. “People,” he said, “aren’t so well off, I think, sir; and\r\nthey’ll buy half a quire of outside foolscap, or outside post, for\r\nfrom 5_d._ to 8_d._, and stitch it together, and rule it, and make a\r\nbook of it. Rich tradesmen do that, sir. I bought of a stationer some\r\nyears back, and he told me that he was a relation of a rich grocer,\r\nand had befriended him in his (the grocer’s) youth, but he wouldn’t\r\nbuy account-books, for he said, the make-shift books that his shopman\r\nstitched together for him opened so much easier. People never want a\r\ngood excuse for acting shabby.”\r\n\r\nThere are now, I am informed, twelve men selling account-books daily,\r\nwhich they carry in a covered basket, or in a waterproof bag, or, in\r\nfine weather, under the arm. Some of these street-sellers are not\r\nitinerant when there is a congregation of people for business, or\r\nindeed for any purpose; at other times they “keep moving.” The fixed\r\nlocalities are, on market days, at Smithfield and Mark-lane: and to\r\nHungerford-market, an old man, unable to “travel,” resorts daily. The\r\nchief trade, however, is in carrying, or hawking these account-books\r\nfrom door to door. A man, “having a connection,” does best “on a\r\nround;” if he be known, he is not distrusted, and sells as cheap, or\r\nrather cheaper, than the shop-keepers.\r\n\r\nThe twelve account-book sellers (with connections) may clear 2_s._\r\n6_d._ a day each, taking, for the realisation of such profit, 7_s._\r\nper diem. Thus 1,310_l._ will be taken by these street-sellers in\r\nthe course of a year. The capital required to start is, stock-money,\r\n15_s._; basket, 3_s._ 6_d._; waterproof bag, 2_s._ 6_d._; 21_s._ in all.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GUIDE-BOOKS, &C.\r\n\r\nThis trade, as regards a street-sale, has only been known for nine or\r\nten years, and had its origination in the exertions of Mr. Hume, M.P.,\r\nto secure to persons visiting the national exhibitions the advantage\r\nof a cheap catalogue. The guide-books were only sold, prior to this\r\ntime, _within_ any public exhibition; and the profits--as is the case\r\nat present--were the perquisite of some official. When the sale was\r\na monopoly, the profit must have been considerable, as the price was\r\nseldom less than 6_d._, and frequently 1_s._ The guide-books, or, as\r\nthey are more frequently called, catalogues, are now sold by men who\r\nstand at the entrance, the approaches, at a little distance on the\r\nline, or at the corners of the adjacent streets, at the following\r\nplaces:--The National Gallery, the Vernon Gallery, the British\r\nMuseum, Westminster Abbey, the House of Lords, the Society of Arts\r\n(occasionally), the Art-Union (when open “free”), Greenwich Hospital,\r\nthe Dulwich Gallery, Hampton Court, Windsor Castle, and Kew Gardens.\r\n\r\nAt any temporary exhibition, also, the same trade is carried on--as\r\nit was largely when the “designs,” &c., for the decoration of the New\r\nHouses of Parliament were exhibited in Westminster Hall. There are, of\r\ncourse, very many other catalogues, or explanatory guides, sold to the\r\nvisitors of other exhibitions, but I speak only of the _street_-sale.\r\n\r\nThere are now, at the National Gallery, three guidebook-sellers plying\r\ntheir trade in the streets; eight at the British Museum; two at\r\nWestminster Abbey; one at the House of Lords, but only on Saturdays,\r\nwhen the House is shown, by orders obtained gratuitously at the Lord\r\nChamberlain’s office, or “when appeals are on;” one at the Vernon\r\nGallery; two at Dulwich (but not regularly, as there are none at\r\npresent), two at Hampton Court, “one near each gate;” and one, and\r\nsometimes three, at Windsor (generally sent out by a shopkeeper there).\r\nThere used to be one at the Thames Tunnel, but “it grew so bad at\r\nlast,” I was told, “that a rat couldn’t have picked up his grub at\r\nit--let alone a man.”\r\n\r\nAmong all these sellers I heard statements of earning a most wretched\r\npittance, and all attributed it to the same cause. By the National\r\nGallery is a board, on which is an announcement that the only\r\nauthorized catalogue of the works of art can be obtained in the hall.\r\nThere are similar announcements at other public places. One man who\r\nhad been in this street trade, but had abandoned it, spoke of these\r\n“boards,” as he called them, with intense bitterness. “They’re the ruin\r\nof any trade in the streets,” he said. “You needn’t think because I’m\r\nout of it now, that I have a pleasure in abusing the regulations; no,\r\nsir, I look at it this way. Mr. Hume had trouble enough, I know, to get\r\nthe public a cheap catalogue, and poor men were allowed to earn honest\r\nbread by selling them in the streets, and honest bread they would earn\r\nstill, if it weren’t for the board. I declare solemnly a man can’t get\r\na living at the trade. The publishers can’t prepare their catalogues\r\nwithout leave, and when they’ve got leave, and do prepare and print\r\nthem, why isn’t a man allowed to sell them in the streets, as I’ve\r\nsold second editions of the _Globe_ without ever the office putting\r\nout a notice that the only authorized copy was to be had within? God\r\nbless your soul, sir, it’s shocking, shocking, poor men being hindered\r\nevery way. Anybody that looks on the board looks on us as cheats and\r\nhumbugs, and thinks that our catalogues are all takes-in. But I’ve\r\nheard gentlemen, that I’m sure knew what they were talking about, say,\r\nin case they’d bought in the street first, and then seen the board and\r\nbought within after, so as to be sure of the real thing--I’ve heard\r\ngentlemen, say, sir,--‘Why what we got in the street is the best after\r\nall.’ Free trade! There’s plenty said about free trade, but that board,\r\nsir, or call it what you please, gives a monopoly against us. What I\r\nhave said, when I was starving on catalogues, is this: Kick us out of\r\nthe streets, commit us for selling catalogues, as rogues and vagabonds;\r\nor give us a fair chance. If we _may_ sell, why is the only authorised\r\ncatalogue sold only within? I wish Mr. Hume, or Mr. Cobden, either,\r\nonly understood the rights of the matter--it’s of no account to me\r\nmyself now--and I think they’d soon set it to rights. Free trade! Over\r\nthe left, and with more hooks than one.”\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that this representation and this opinion would have\r\nbeen echoed by the street catalogue-sellers, but they were evidently\r\nunwilling to converse freely on this branch of the subject, knowing the\r\nobject for which I questioned them, and that publicity would follow. I\r\nattribute this reluctance chiefly to the fact that, all these poor men\r\nlook forward to the opening of the Great Exhibition with earnest hope\r\nand anxiety that the influx of visiters will add greatly to their sale\r\nand profits; and they are unwilling to jeopardise their privilege of\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nOne man told me that he believed, from his own knowledge, for he\r\nhad not always “sold outside,” that the largest buyers of these\r\npublications were country people, sight-seeing in London, for they\r\nbought the book not only as an explanatory guide, but to preserve as a\r\nmemento of their visit. Such customers, however, I heard from several\r\nquarters, the moment they saw a “notice” as to the only authorised\r\ncopy, looked upon the street-sellers as a systematised portion of the\r\nLondon sharpers, seeking whom they might devour, and so bought their\r\ncatalogues “within.”\r\n\r\nThe best customers in the streets for the catalogues are, I am assured,\r\nthe working-classes, who visit the national exhibitions on a holiday.\r\n“I’ve oft enough heard them say,” one man stated, “‘I’d rather pay a\r\npoor man 2_d._ any day, when I can spare it, than rich people 1_d._ I\r\nknow what it is to fight for a crust.’”\r\n\r\nAt the National Gallery, the street-sold catalogues are 1_d._, 3_d._,\r\nand 6_d._; in the hall, the authorised copy is sold at 4_d._ and\r\n1_s._ At the British Museum, the street-charges are 3_d._ and 6_d._;\r\nthere were 1_d._ catalogues of this institution, but they have been\r\ndiscontinued for the last half-year, being found too meagre. At the\r\nVernon Gallery, the charge is 1_d._; but the 6_d._ guide-book to the\r\nNational Gallery contains also an account of the pictures in the Vernon\r\nGallery. At Westminster Abbey the price is 6_d._, and the same at the\r\nHouse of Lords. At Hampton-court it is 2_d._, 4_d._, and 6_d._, and at\r\nthe same rate as regards the other places mentioned. At Hampton-court,\r\nI was told, the street-sellers were not allowed to approach the palace\r\nnearer than a certain space. One man told me that he was threatened\r\nwith being “had in for trespassing, and Mr. G---- would make him\r\nwheel a roller. Of course,” the man continued, “there’s an authorised\r\ncatalogue there.”\r\n\r\nThe best sale of catalogues in the streets was at the exhibition of the\r\nworks of art for the Houses of Parliament. The sellers, then--about 20\r\nin number, among whom were four women--cleared 2_s._ and 2_s._ 6_d._\r\neach daily. At present, I am assured, that a good week is considered\r\none in which 5_s._ is made, but that 3_s._ is more frequently the\r\nweekly earning. It must be borne in mind, that at the two places most\r\nresorted to--the National Gallery and the British Museum--the street\r\nsale is only for four days in the week at the first mentioned, and\r\nthree days at the second. “You may think that more is made,” said one\r\nman, “but it isn’t. Sweeping a good crossing is far better, far. Bless\r\nyour soul, only stand a few minutes looking on, any day, and see what\r\nnumbers and numbers of people pass in and out of a free admission place\r\nwithout ever laying out 1_d._ Why, only last Monday and Wednesday\r\n(March 17 and 19, both very rainy days) I took only 5_d._ I didn’t\r\n_take_ more than 5_d._, and I leave you to judge the living I shall\r\n_clear_ out of that; and I know that the man with the catalogue at\r\nanother place, didn’t take 1_d._ It’s sad work, sir, as you stand in\r\nthe wet and cold, with no dinner for yourself, and no great hope of\r\ntaking one home to your family.”\r\n\r\nThese street-sellers contrive, whenever they can, to mix up other\r\navocations with catalogue selling, as the public institutions close\r\nearly. One, on every occasion, sells second editions of the newspapers;\r\nanother has “odd turns at portering;” a third sells old umbrellas in\r\nthe streets; some sold exhibition cards in the Park, on Sundays, until\r\nthe sale was stopped; another sells a little stationery; and nearly\r\nthe whole of them resort, on favourable opportunities, to the sale of\r\n“books of the play,” or of “the opera.”\r\n\r\nReckoning that there are regularly sixteen street-sellers of\r\nguide-books--they do not interfere with each other’s stations--and\r\nthat each clears 4_s._ weekly, we find £832 expended in this street\r\ntraffic. I have calculated only on the usual bookseller’s allowance of\r\n25 per cent., though, in some instances, these sellers are supplied on\r\nlower terms--besides having, in some of the catalogues, thirteen to the\r\ndozen; but the amount specified does not exceed the mark.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of these guide-books which I heard of as having\r\nbeen sold, in any one day, was four dozen, disposed of on a fine\r\nWhit-Monday, and for these the street-seller only took 6_s._ 8_d._\r\nThere are, I was informed, half as many more “threepennies” as\r\n“sixpennies” sold, and three times as many “pennies” as the other two\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe capital required to start is what may suffice to “lay in” a stock\r\nof books--5_s._ generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\nThese traders may be described as partaking more of the characteristics\r\nof the street stationers than of the “paper-workers,” as they are not\r\npatterers. The trade is less exclusively than the “paper-trade” in\r\nthe hands of men. Those carrying on this branch of the street-traffic\r\nmay be divided into the sellers of pictures in frames, and of\r\nengravings (of all kinds), in umbrellas. Under this head may also be\r\nranked the street-artists (though this is a trade associated with\r\nstreet-life rather than forming an integrant part of it), I allude more\r\nparticularly to the illustrated “boards” which are prepared for the\r\npurposes of the street-patterers, and are adapted for no other use.\r\nThe same artist that executes the greater portion of the street-art,\r\nalso prepares the paintings which decorate the exterior of shows.\r\nThere are also the writers of manuscript music, and the makers and\r\nsellers of “images” of all descriptions, but this branch of the subject\r\nI shall treat under the head of the street-Italians. Under the same\r\ncurious head I shall also speak of the artists whose skill produces\r\nthe street-sold medallions, in wax or plaster, they being of the same\r\nclass as the “image” men. In both “images” and “casts” and “moulded”\r\nproductions of all kinds the change and improvement that have taken\r\nplace, from the pristine rudeness of “green parrots” is most remarkable\r\nand creditable to the taste of working people, who are the chief\r\npurchasers of the smaller articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STREET ART.\r\n\r\nThe artists who work for the street-sellers are less numerous than the\r\npoets for the same trade. Indeed, there is now but one man who can\r\nbe said to be _solely_ a street-artist. The inopportune illustration\r\nof ballads of which specimens have already been given--or of any of\r\nthe street papers--are the work of cheap wood-engravers, who give the\r\nexecution of these orders to their boys. But it is not often that\r\nillustrations are prepared expressly for anything but what I have\r\ndescribed as “Gallows literature.” Of these, samples have also been\r\nfurnished. The one of a real murder, and the other of a fabulous one,\r\nor “cock,” together with a sample (in the case of Mr. Patrick Connor)\r\nof the portraits given in such productions. The cuts for the heading of\r\nballads are very often such as have been used for the illustration of\r\nother works, and are “picked up cheap.”\r\n\r\nThe artist who works especially for the street trade--as in the case of\r\nthe man who paints the patterers’ boards--must address his art plainly\r\nto the eye of the spectator. He must use the most striking colours, be\r\nprofuse in the application of scarlet, light blue, orange--not yellow I\r\nwas told, it ain’t a good candlelight colour--and must leave nothing to\r\nthe imagination. Perspective and back-grounds are things of but minor\r\nconsideration. Everything must be sacrificed for effect.\r\n\r\nThese paintings are in water colours, and are rubbed over with a\r\nsolution of some gum-resin to protect them from the influence of rainy\r\nweather. Two of the subjects most in demand of late for the patterers’\r\nboards were “the Sloanes” and “the Mannings.” The treatment of Jane\r\nWilbred was “worked” by twenty boardmen, each with his “illustration”\r\nof the subject. The illustrations were in six “compartments.” In the\r\nfirst Mr. and Mrs. Sloane are “picking out” the girl from a line of\r\nworkhouse children. She is represented as plump and healthy, but with\r\na stupid expression of countenance. In another compartment, Sloane is\r\nbeating the girl, then attenuated and wretched-looking, with a shoe,\r\nwhile his wife and Miss Devaux (a name I generally heard pronounced\r\namong the street-people as it is spelt to an English reader) look\r\napprovingly on. The next picture was Sloane compelling the girl to\r\nswallow filth. The fourth represented her as in the hospital, with\r\nher ribs protruding from her wasted body--“just as I’ve worked Sarah\r\nSimpole,” said a patterer, “who was confined in a cellar and fed on\r\n’tato peels. Sarah was a cock, sir, and a ripper.” Then came the attack\r\nof the people on Sloane, one old woman dressed after the fashion of\r\nMrs. Gamp, “prodding” him with a huge and very green umbrella. The\r\nsixth and last was, as usual, the trial.\r\n\r\nI have described the “Sloanes’ board” first, as it may be more fresh\r\nin the remembrance of any reader observant of such things. In the\r\n“Mannings’ board” there were the same number of compartments as in\r\nthe Sloanes’; showing the circumstances of the murder, the discovery\r\nof the body of Connor, the trial, &c. One standing patterer, who\r\nworked a Mannings’ board, told me that the picture of Mrs. Manning,\r\nbeautifully “dressed for dinner” in black satin, with “a low front,”\r\nfiring a pistol at Connor, who was “washing himself,” while Manning,\r\nin his shirt sleeves, looked on in evident alarm, was greatly admired,\r\nespecially out of town. “The people said,” observed the patterer, “‘O,\r\nlook at him a-washing hisself; he’s a doing it so nattral, and ain’t\r\na-thinking he’s a-going to be murdered. But was he really so ugly as\r\nthat? Lor! such a beautiful woman to have to do with him.’ You see,\r\nsir, Connor weren’t flattered, and perhaps Mrs. Manning was. I have\r\nheard the same sort of remarks both in town and country. I patters hard\r\non the women such times, as I points them out on my board in murders or\r\nany crimes. I says: ‘When there’s mischief a woman’s always the first.\r\nLook at Mrs. Manning there on that werry board--the work of one of the\r\nfirst artists in London--it’s a faithful likeness, taken from life at\r\none of her examinations, look at _her_. She fires the pistol, as you\r\ncan see, and her husband was her tool.’ I said, too, that Sloane was\r\nMrs. Sloane’s tool. It answers best, sir, in my opinion, going on that\r\npatter. The men likes it, and the women doesn’t object, for they’ll\r\nsay: ‘Well, when a woman is bad, she _is_ bad, and is a disgrace to her\r\nsex.’ There’s the board before them when I runs on that line of patter,\r\nand when I appeals to the ’lustration, it seems to cooper the thing.\r\nThey _must_ believe their eyes.”\r\n\r\nWhen there is “a run” on any particular subject, there are occasionally\r\njarrings--I was informed by a “boardman”--between the artist and his\r\nstreet-customers. The standing patterers want “something more original”\r\nthan their fellows, especially if they are likely to work in the same\r\nlocality, while the artist prefers a faithful copy of what he has\r\nalready executed. The artist, moreover, and with all reasonableness,\r\nwill say: “Why, you must have the facts. Do you want me to make Eliza\r\nChestney killing Rush?” The matter is often compromised by some change\r\nbeing introduced, and by the characters being differently dressed. One\r\nman told me, that in town and country he had seen Mrs. Jermy shot in\r\nthe following costumes, “in light green welwet, sky-blue satin, crimson\r\nsilk, and vite muslin.” It was the same with Mrs. Manning.\r\n\r\nFor the last six or eight years, I am told, the artist in question has\r\nprepared all the boards in demand. Previously, the standing patterers\r\nprepared their own boards, when they fancied themselves capable of\r\nsuch a “reach of art,” or had them done by some unemployed painter,\r\nwhom they might fall in with at a lodging-house, or elsewhere. This\r\nis rarely done now, I am told; not perhaps more than six times in\r\na twelvemonth, and when done it is most frequently practised of\r\n“cock-boards;” for, as was said to me, “if a man thinks he’s getting up\r\na fakement likely to take, and wants a board to help him on with it,\r\nhe’ll try and keep it to hisself, and come out with it quite fresh.”\r\n\r\nThe charge of the popular street-artist for the painting of a board is\r\n3_s._ or 3_s._ 6_d._, according to the simplicity or elaborateness of\r\nthe details; the board itself is provided by the artist’s employer.\r\nThe demand for this peculiar branch of street art is very irregular,\r\ndepending entirely upon whether anything be “up” or not; that is,\r\nwhether there has or has not been perpetrated any act of atrocity,\r\nwhich has riveted, as it is called, the public attention. And so\r\ngreat is the uncertainty felt by the street-folk, whether “the most\r\nbeautiful murder will take or not,” that it is rarely the patterer will\r\norder, or the artist will speculate, in anticipation of a demand, upon\r\npreparing the painting of any event, until satisfied that it has become\r\n“popular.” A deed of more than usual daring, deceit, or mystery, may\r\nbe at once hailed by those connected with murder-patter, as “one that\r\nwill do,” and some speculation may be ventured upon; as it was, I am\r\ninformed, in the cases of Tawell, Rush, and the Mannings; but these are\r\nmerely exceptional. Thus, if the artist have a dozen boards ordered\r\n“for this ten days, he may have two, or one, or none for the next ten;”\r\nso uncertain, it appears, is all that depends, without intrinsic merit,\r\non mere popular applause.\r\n\r\nI am unable to give--owing to the want of account-books, &c., which I\r\nhave so often had to refer to as characteristic of street-people--a\r\nprecise account of the average number of boards thus prepared in\r\na year. Perhaps it may be as close to the fact as possible to\r\nconclude that the artist in question, who, unlike the majority of the\r\nstreet-poets, is not a street-seller, but works, as a professional man,\r\n_for_ but not _in_ the streets, realises on his boards a profit of\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ weekly. The pictorial productions for street-shows will be\r\nmore appropriately described in the account of street-performers and\r\nshowmen.\r\n\r\nThis artist, as I have shown concerning some of the street-professors\r\nof the sister art of poesy, has the quality of knowing how to adapt his\r\nworks exactly to the taste of his patrons the sellers, and of their\r\npatrons, the buyers in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF ENGRAVINGS, ETC., IN UMBRELLAS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe sale of “prints,” “pictures,” and “engravings”--I heard them\r\ndesignated by each term--in umbrellas in the streets, has been known,\r\nas far as I could learn from the street-folk for some fifteen years,\r\nand has been general from ten to twelve years. In this traffic the\r\numbrella is inverted and the “stock” is disposed within its expanse.\r\nSometimes narrow tapes are attached from rib to rib of the umbrella,\r\nand within these tapes are placed the pictures, one resting upon\r\nanother. Sometimes a few pins are used to attach the larger prints to\r\nthe cotton of the umbrella, the smaller ones being “fitted in at the\r\nside” of the bigger. “Pins is best, sir, in my opinion,” said a little\r\nold man, who used to have a “print umbrella” in the New Cut; “for the\r\npublic has a more unbrokener display. I used werry fine pins, though\r\nthey’s dearer, for people as has a penny to spare likes to see things\r\nnice, and big pins makes big holes in the pictures.”\r\n\r\nThis trade is most pursued on still summer evenings, and the use of an\r\ninverted umbrella seems so far appropriate that it can only be so used,\r\nin the street, in _dry_ weather. “I used to keep a sharp look-out,\r\nsir,” said the same informant, “for wind or rain, and many’s the time\r\nthem devils o’ boys--God forgive me, they’s on’y poor children--but\r\nthey _is_ devils--has come up to me and has said--one in particler,\r\nstandin’ afore the rest: ‘It’ll thunder in five minutes, old bloke, so\r\nhup with yer humbereller, and go ’ome; hup with it jist as it is; it’ll\r\nshow stunnin; and sell as yer goes.’ O, they’re a shocking torment,\r\nsir; nobody can feel it like people in the streets,--shocking.”\r\n\r\nThe engravings thus sold are of all descriptions. Some have evidently\r\nbeen the frontispieces of sixpenny or lower-priced works. These\r\nworks sometimes fall into hands of the “waste collectors,” and any\r\n“illustrations” are extracted from the letter-press and are disposed\r\nof by the collectors, by the gross or dozen, to those warehousemen who\r\nsupply the small shopkeepers and the street-sellers. Sometimes, I was\r\ninformed, a number of engravings, which had for a while appeared as\r\n“frontispieces” were issued for sale separately. Many of these were\r\nand are found in the “street umbrellas;” more especially the portraits\r\nof popular actors and actresses. “Mr. J. P. Kemble, as Hamlet”--“Mr.\r\nFawcett, as Captain Copp”--“Mr. Young, as Iago”--“Mr. Liston, as Paul\r\nPry”--“Mrs. Siddons, as Lady Macbeth”--“Miss O’Neil, as Belvidera,”\r\n&c., &c. In the course of an inquiry into the subject nearly a year and\r\na half ago, I learned from one “umbrella man” that, six or seven years\r\npreviously, he used to sell more portraits of “Mr. Edmund Kean, as\r\nRichard III.,” than of anything else. Engravings, too, which had first\r\nbeen admired in the “Annuals”--when half-a-guinea was the price of the\r\n“Literary Souvenir,” the “Forget-me-not,” “Friendship’s Offering,” the\r\n“Bijou,” &c., &c.--are frequently found in these umbrellas; and amongst\r\nthem are not unfrequently seen portraits of the aristocratic beauties\r\nof the day, from “waste” “Flowers of Loveliness” and old “Court\r\nMagazines,” which “go off very fair.” The majority of these street-sold\r\n“engravings” are “coloured,” in which state the street-sellers prefer\r\nthem, thinking them much more saleable, though the information I\r\nreceived hardly bears out their opinion.\r\n\r\nThe following statement, from a middle-aged woman, further shows the\r\nnature of the trade, and the class of customers:\r\n\r\n“I’ve sat with an umbrella,” she said, “these seven or eight years, I\r\nsuppose it is. My husband’s a penny lot-seller, with just a middling\r\npitch” [the vendor of a number of articles, sold at a penny “a lot”]\r\n“and in the summer I do a little in engravings, when I’m not minding\r\nmy husband’s ‘lots,’ for he has sometimes a day, and oftener a night,\r\nwith portering and packing for a tradesman, that’s known him long.\r\nWell, sir, I think I sell most ‘coloured.’ ‘Master Toms’ wasn’t bad\r\nlast summer. ‘Master Toms’ was pictures of cats, sir--you must have\r\nseen them--and I had them different colours. If a child looks on with\r\nits father, very likely, it’ll want ‘pussy,’ and if the child cries\r\nfor it, it’s almost a sure sale, and more, I think, indeed I’m sure,\r\nwith men than with women. Women knows the value of money better than\r\nmen, for men never understand what housekeeping is. I have no children,\r\nthank God, or they might be pinched, poor things. ‘Miss Kitties’ was\r\nthe same sale. Toms is hes, and Kitties is she cats. I’ve sometimes\r\nsold to poor women who was tiresome; they must have just what would fit\r\nover their mantel-pieces, that was papered with pictures.” [My readers\r\nmay remember that some of the descriptions I have given, long previous\r\nto the present inquiry, of the rooms of the poor, fully bear out this\r\nstatement.] “I seldom venture on anything above 1_d._, I mean to sell\r\nat 1_d._ I’ve had Toms and Kitties at 2_d._ though. ‘Fashions’ isn’t\r\nworth umbrella room; the poorest needlewoman won’t be satisfied with\r\nthem from an umbrella. ‘Queens’ and ‘Alberts’ and ‘Wales’s’ and the\r\nother children isn’t near so good as they was. There’s so many ‘fine\r\nportraits of Her Majesty,’ or the others, given away with the first\r\nnumber of this or of that, that people’s overstocked. If a working-man\r\ncan buy a newspaper or a number, why of course he may as well have a\r\npicture with it. They gave away glasses of gin at the opening of that\r\nbaker’s shop there, and it’s the same doctrine” [The word she used]. “I\r\nnever offer penny theatres, or comic exhibitions, or anything big; they\r\nspoils the look of the umbrella, and makes better things look mean. I\r\nsell only to working people, I think; seldom to boys, and seldomer to\r\ngirls; seldom to servant-maids and hardly ever to women of the town. I\r\n_have_ taken 6_d._ from one of them though. I think boys buy pictures\r\nfor picture books. I never had what I suppose was old pictures. To a\r\nfew old people, I’ve known, ‘Children’ sell fairly, when they’re made\r\nplump, and red cheeked, and curly haired. They sees a resemblance of\r\ntheir grandchildren, perhaps, and buys. Young married people does so\r\ntoo, but not so oft, I think. I don’t remember that ever I have made\r\nmore than 1_s._ 10_d._ on an evening. I don’t sell, or very seldom\r\nindeed, at other times, and only in summer, and when its fine. If\r\nI clear 5_s._ I counts that a good week. It’s a great help to the\r\nlot-selling. I seldom clear so much. Oftener 4_s._”\r\n\r\nThe principal sale of these “pictures,” in the streets, is from\r\numbrellas. Occasionally, a street-stationer, or even a miscellaneous\r\nlot-seller, when he has met with a cheap lot, especially of portraits\r\nof ladies, will display a collection of prints, pyramidally arranged\r\non his stall,--but these are exceptions. Sometimes, too, an “umbrella\r\nprint-seller” will have a few “pictures in frames,” on a sort of stand\r\nalongside the umbrella.\r\n\r\nThe pictures for the umbrellas are bought at the warehouse, or the\r\nswag-shops, of which I have before spoken. At these establishments\r\n“prints” are commonly supplied from 3_d._ to 5_s._ the dozen. The\r\nstreet-sellers buy at 5_d._ and 6_d._ the dozen, to sell at a 1_d._ a\r\npiece; and at 3_d._ to sell at 1/2_d._ _None_ of the pictures thus\r\nsold are prepared expressly for the streets.\r\n\r\nIn so desultory and--as one intelligent street-seller with whom I\r\nconversed on the subject described it--so _weathery_ a trade, it is\r\ndifficult to arrive at exact statistics. From the best data at my\r\ncommand, it may be computed, that for twelve weeks of the year, there\r\nare thirty umbrella print-sellers (all exceptional traders therein\r\nincluded) each clearing 6_s._ weekly, and taking 12_s._ Thus it appears\r\nthat 216_l._ is yearly expended in the streets in this purchase. Many\r\nof the sellers are old or infirm; one who was among the most prosperous\r\nbefore the changes in the streets of Lambeth, was dwarfish, and was\r\ndelighted to be thought “a character.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PICTURES IN FRAMES.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1810, or somewhat earlier, down to 1830, or somewhat\r\nlater, the street-sale of pictures in frames was almost entirely in\r\nthe hands of the Jews. The subjects were then nearly all scriptural:\r\n“The Offering up of Isaac;” “Jacob’s Dream;” “The Crossing of the\r\nRed Sea;” “The Death of Sisera;” and “The Killing of Goliath from\r\nthe Sling of the youthful David.” But the Jew traders did not at all\r\naccount it necessary to confine the subjects of their pictures to the\r\nrecords of the Old--their best trade was in the illustrations of the\r\nNew Testament. Perhaps the “Stoning of St. Stephen” was their most\r\nsaleable “picture in a frame.” There were also “The Nativity;” “The\r\nSlaying of the Children, by order of Herod” (with the quotation of St.\r\nMatthew, chap. ii. verse 17, “Then was fulfilled that which was spoken\r\nby Jeremy the prophet”); “The Sermon on the Mount;” “The Beheading of\r\nJohn the Baptist;” “The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem;” “The Raising\r\nof Lazarus;” “The Betrayal on the part of Judas;” “The Crucifixion;”\r\nand “The Conversion of St. Paul.” There were others, but these were\r\nthe principal subjects. All these pictures were coloured, and very\r\ndeeply coloured. St. Stephen was stoned in the lightest of sky-blue\r\nshort mantles. The pictures were sold in the streets of London, mostly\r\nin the way of hawking; but ten times as extensively, I am told, in\r\nthe country, as in town. Indeed, at the present time, many a secluded\r\nvillage ale-house has its parlour walls decorated with these scriptural\r\nillustrations, which seem to have superseded\r\n\r\n  “The pictures placed for ornament and use;\r\n  The twelve good rules; the royal game of goose,”\r\n\r\nmentioned by Goldsmith as characteristic of a village inn. These “Jew\r\npictures” are now yielding to others.\r\n\r\nMost of these articles were varnished, and 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ each\r\nwas frequently the price asked, 1_s._ 6_d._ being taken “if no better\r\ncould be done,” and sometimes 1_s._ A smaller amount per single picture\r\nwas always taken, if a set were purchased. These productions were\r\nprepared principally for street-sale and for hawkers. The frames were\r\nnarrower and meaner-looking than in the present street-pictures of the\r\nkind; they were stained like the present frames, in imitation of maple,\r\nbut far less skilfully. Sometimes they were a black japan; sometimes a\r\nsorry imitation of mahogany.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the Reform Bill era, the street-pictures in frames\r\nmost in demand were Earl Grey, Earl Spencer’s (or Lord Althorp), Lord\r\nBrougham’s, and Lord John Russell’s. O’Connell’s also “sold well,” as\r\ndid William IV. “Queen Adelaide,” I was told, “went off middling, not\r\nmuch more than half as good as William.” Towards the close of King\r\nWilliam’s life, the portraits of the Princess Victoria of Kent were\r\nof good sale in the streets, and her Royal Highness was certainly\r\nrepresented as a young lady of undue plumpness, and had hardly justice\r\ndone to her portraiture. The Duchess of Kent, also, I was informed,\r\n“sold fairish in the streets.” In a little time, the picture in a\r\nframe of the Princess Victoria of Kent, with merely an alteration in\r\nthe title, became available as Queen Victoria I., of Great Britain and\r\nIreland. Since that period, there have been the princes and princesses,\r\nher Majesty’s offspring, who present a strong family resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe street pictures, so to speak, are not unfrequently of a religious\r\ncharacter. Pictures of the Virgin and Child, of the Saviour seated\r\nat the Last Supper, of the Crucifixion, or of the different saints,\r\ngenerally coloured. The principal purchasers of these “religious\r\npictures” are the poorer Irish. I remember seeing, in the course of\r\nan inquiry among street-performers last summer, the entire wall of a\r\npoor street-dancer’s one room, except merely the space occupied by the\r\nfireplace, covered with small coloured pictures in frames, the whole\r\nof which, the proprietor told me, with some pride, he had picked up in\r\nthe streets, according as he could spare a few pence. Among them were a\r\ncrucifix (of bone), and a few medallions, of a religious character, in\r\nplaster or wax. This man was of Italian extraction; but I have seen the\r\nsame thing in the rooms of the Roman Catholic Irish, though never to\r\nthe same extent.\r\n\r\nThe general subjects now most in demand for street-sale are, “Lola\r\nMontes,” “Louis Philippe and his Queen,” “The Sailor’s Return,”\r\n“The Soldier’s Return,” and the “Parting” of the same individuals,\r\nSmugglers, in different situations, Poachers also; “Turpin’s Ride\r\nto York,” the divers feats attributed to Jack Sheppard (but less\r\npopular than “Turpin’s Ride,”) “Courtship,” “Marriage” (the one a\r\ncouple caressing, and the other bickering), “Father Mathew” (in very\r\nblack large boots), “Napoleon Bonaparte crossing the Alps,” and his\r\n“Farewell to his Troops at Fontainebleau,” “Scenes of Piracy.” None\r\nof these subjects are modern; “Lola Montes” (a bold-faced woman, in a\r\nriding-habit), being the newest. “Why,” said one man familiar with the\r\ntrade, “there hasn’t been no Louis Napoleon in a frame-picture for the\r\nstreets, nor Cobdens, nor Feargus O’Connors, nor Sir John Franklins;\r\nwhat is wanted for us is something exciting.”\r\n\r\nThe prices of frame-pictures (as I sometimes heard them called) made\r\nexpressly for street-sale, vary from 1_d._ to 1_s._ a pair. The 1_d._\r\na pair are about six inches by four, very rude, and on thin paper,\r\nand with frames made of lath-wood (stained), but put together very\r\ncompactly. The cheaper sorts are of prints bought at the swag-shops, or\r\nof waste-dealers, sometimes roughly coloured, and sometimes plain. The\r\ngreatest sale is of those charged from 2_d._ to 4_d._ the pair.\r\n\r\nSome of the higher-priced pictures are painted purposely for the\r\nstreets, but are always copies of some popular engraving, and their\r\nsale is not a twentieth of the others. These frame-pictures were, and\r\nare, generally got up by a family, the girls taking the management\r\nof the paper-work, the boys of the wood. The parents have, many of\r\nthem, been paper-stainers. This division of labour is one reason of\r\nthe exceeding cheapness of this street branch of the fine arts. These\r\nworking artists--or whatever they are to be called--also prepare and\r\nframe for street-sale the plates given away in the first instance with\r\na number of a newspaper or a periodical, and afterwards “to be had for\r\nnext to nothing.” The prevalence of such engravings has tended greatly\r\nto diminish the sale of the pictures prepared expressly for the streets.\r\n\r\nTen years ago this trade was ten times greater than it is now. The\r\nprincipal sale still is, and always was, at the street-markets\r\non Saturday evenings. They are sold piled on a small stall, or\r\ncarried under the arm. To sell 10_s._ worth on a Saturday night\r\nis an extraordinary sale, and 2_s._ 6_d._ is a bad one, and the\r\nframe-picturer must have “middling patter to set them off at all.\r\n‘Twopence a pair!’ he’ll say; ‘only twopence a pair! Who’d be without\r\nan ornament to his dwelling?’”\r\n\r\nThere are now about fifty persons engaged in this sale on a Saturday\r\nnight, of whom the majority are the artists or preparers of the\r\npictures. On a Monday evening there are about twenty sellers; and not\r\nhalf that number on other evenings--but some “take a round in the\r\nsuburbs.”\r\n\r\nIf these people take 10_s._ weekly for frame-pictures the year through,\r\n1,040_l._ is yearly expended in this way. I estimate the average number\r\nat twenty daily. Their profits are about cent. per cent.; boys and\r\nworking people buy the most. The trade is often promoted by a raffle\r\nat a public-house. Many mechanics, I was told, now frame their own\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MANUSCRIPT AND OTHER MUSIC.\r\n\r\nThis trade used to be more extensively carried on in the streets than\r\nit is at present. The reasons I heard assigned for the decadence\r\nwere the greater cheapness of musical productions generally, and the\r\npresent fondness for lithographic embellishments to every polka, waltz,\r\nquadrille, ballad, &c., &c. “People now hates, I do believe, a _bare_\r\nmusic-sheet,” one street-seller remarked.\r\n\r\nThe street manuscript-music trade was, certainly, and principally,\r\npiratical. An air became popular perhaps on a sudden, as it was pointed\r\nout to me, in the case, of “Jump, Jim Crow.” At a musical publisher’s,\r\nsuch an affair in the first bloom of its popularity, would have been\r\ncharged from 2_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._, twenty-five years ago, and the\r\nstreet-seller at that time, often also a book-stall keeper, would\r\nemploy, or buy of those who offered them for sale, and who copied them\r\nfor the purpose, a manuscript of the demanded music, which he could\r\nsell cheap in comparison.\r\n\r\nA man who, until the charges of which I have before spoken, kept a\r\nsecond-hand book-stall, in a sort of arched passage in the New Cut,\r\nLambeth, sold manuscript-music, and was often “sadly bothered,” he\r\nsaid, at one time by the musical propensities of a man who looked\r\nlike a journeyman tailor. This man, whenever he had laid out a trifle\r\nat the book-stall, looked over the music, and often pulled a small\r\nflute from his pocket, and began to play a few bars from one of the\r\nmanuscripts, and this he continued doing, to the displeasure of the\r\nstall-keeper, until a crowd began to assemble, thinking, perhaps,\r\nthat the flute-player was a street-musician; he was then obliged to\r\ndesist. Of the kind of music he sold, or of its mode of production,\r\nthis street-bookseller knew nothing. He purchased it of a man who\r\ncarried it to his stall, and as he found it sell tolerably well, he\r\ngave himself no further trouble concerning it. The supplier of the\r\nmanuscript pencilled on each sheet the price it was to be offered at,\r\nallowing the stall-keeper from 50 to 150 per cent. profit, if the\r\nprice marked was obtained. “I haven’t seen anything of him, sir,” said\r\nthe street-bookseller, “for a long while. I dare say he was some poor\r\nmusicianer, or singer, or a reduced gentleman, perhaps, for he always\r\ncame after dusk, or else on bad dark days.”\r\n\r\nAlthough but partially connected with street-art, I may mention\r\nas a sample of the music sometimes offered in street-sale, that a\r\nbook-stall keeper, three weeks ago showed me a pile of music which he\r\nhad purchased from a “waste collector,” about eight months before,\r\nat 2-1/2_d._ the pound. Among this was some MS. music, which I\r\nspecify below, and which the book-stall keeper was confident, on very\r\ninsufficient grounds, I think, had been done for street-sale.\r\n\r\nThe music had, as regards three-fourths of it, evidently been bound,\r\nand had been torn from the boards of the book, as only the paper\r\nportion is purchased for “waste.” Some, however, were loose sheets,\r\nwhich had evidently never been subjected to the process of stitching.\r\nI now cite some of the titles of this street-sale: “Le Petit Tambour.\r\nSujet d’un Grand Rondeau pour le Piano Forte. Composé par L. Zerbini,”\r\n(MS.) “Di Tanti Palpiti. The Celebrated Cavatina, by Rossini, &c.”\r\n“Twenty Short Lessons, or Preludes in the most Convenient Keys for the\r\nHarp. Composed and Respectfully Dedicated to Lady Ann Collins. By John\r\nBaptist Meyer. Price 5_s._” “An Cota Caol (given in the ancient Irish\r\ncharacter.) The Slender Coat,” (MS.) “Cailin beog chruite na mbo (also\r\nin Irish). The Pretty Girl Milking the Cow,” (MS.)\r\n\r\nThere are now no persons regularly employed in preparing MS. music for\r\nthe streets. But occasionally a person skilled in music writing will,\r\nwhen he or she, I was told, had nothing better in hand, do a little\r\nfor the street sale, disposing of the MSS. to any street-stationer or\r\nbookseller. If four persons are this way employed, receiving 4_s._ a\r\nweek each, the year through--which I am assured is the extent--we find\r\nupwards of 40_l._ thus earned, and about twice that sum taken by the\r\nstreet retailers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF STATIONERY,\r\nLITERATURE, AND THE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now proceed to give a summary of the capital, and income of the above\r\nclasses. I will first however, endeavour to give a summary of the\r\nnumber of individuals belonging to the class.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be made up (so far as I am able to ascertain) of the\r\nfollowing items:--120 sellers of stationery; 20 sellers of pocket-books\r\nand diaries; 50 sellers of almanacks and memorandum-books; 12 sellers\r\nof account-books; 31 card-sellers; 6 secret papers-sellers; 250 sellers\r\nof songs and ballads; 90 running patterers; 20 standing patterers; 8\r\nsellers of “cocks” (principally elopements); 15 selling conundrums,\r\n“comic exhibitions,” &c.; 200 selling play-bills and books for the\r\nplay; 40 back-number-sellers; 4 waste paper-sellers at Billingsgate;\r\n40 sellers of tracts and pamphlets; 12 newsvenders, &c., at steam-boat\r\npiers; 2 book auctioneers; 70 book-stall keepers and book barrow-men;\r\n16 sellers of guide-books; 30 sellers of song-books and children’s\r\nbooks; 40 dealers in pictures in frames; 30 vendors of engravings in\r\numbrellas, and 4 sellers of manuscript music--making altogether a total\r\nof 1,110. Many of the above street-trades are, however, only temporary.\r\nAs, for instance, the street-sale of playing-cards, continues only\r\nfourteen days in the year; pocket-books and diaries, four weeks;\r\nothers, again, are not regularly pursued from day to day, as the sale\r\nof prints and engravings in umbrellas, which affords employment for but\r\ntwelve weeks out of the fifty-two, and conundrums for two months. One\r\ntrade, however, (namely, that of “Comic Exhibition Papers,” gelatine\r\nand engraved cards of the Exhibition) is entirely now in the streets.\r\nIn the broad-sheet trade, again, the “running patterers” work what are\r\ncalled “cocks,” when there are no incidents happening to incite the\r\npublic mind. Hence, making due allowances for such variations, we may\r\nfairly assume that the street-sellers belonging to this class number\r\nat least 1,000. The following statistics will show the whole amount of\r\ncapital, and the gross income of this branch of street traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL OR VALUE OF THE STOCK-IN-TRADE OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF\r\nSTATIONERY, LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street-sellers of Stationery._\r\n\r\n                                                        £    _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  40 stalls, 4_s._ each; 80 boxes,\r\n  3_s._ 6_d._ each; and stock-money for\r\n  120 sellers, 10_s._ each                             82      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Pocket-books and Diaries._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 20 vendors, 10_s._ each              10      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Almanacks and Memorandum-books._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 50 vendors, 1_s._ per head           2     10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Account-books._\r\n\r\n  12 baskets, 3_s._ each; 12 waterproof\r\n  bags, 2_s._ 6_d._ each; stock-money for\r\n  12 sellers, 15_s._ each                              12      6     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Cards._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 20 sellers, 1_s._ 6_d._ each          2      5     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-seller of Stenographic-cards._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 1 seller                              0      1     6\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Long-songs._\r\n\r\n  20 poles to which songs are attached,\r\n  2_d._ each; stock-money for\r\n  20 sellers, 1_s._ each                                1      3     4\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Wall-songs (“Pinners-up.”)_\r\n\r\n  30 canvass frames, to which songs\r\n  are hung, 2_s._ each; stock-money for\r\n  30 sellers, 1_s._ each                                4     10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Ballads (“Chaunters.”)_\r\n\r\n  2 fiddles, 7_s._ each; stock-money\r\n  for 200 chaunters, 1_s._ each                        10     14     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of “Dialogues,” “Litanies,” &c.\r\n  (“Standing Patterers.”)_\r\n\r\n  20 boards with appendages “for\r\n  pictures,” 5_s._ 6_d._ each; 20 paintings\r\n  for boards, 3_s._ 6_d._ each; stock-money\r\n  for 20 vendors, 1_s._ each                           10      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Executions, &c.

These vendors get\r\n  rid of, among them, in the course of the\r\n  year, 43,200 gelatine, and 14,400 engraved\r\n  cards, at 1_d._ each, and 3,360\r\n  packs of playing-cards, at 3_d._ per\r\n  pack; so that the money spent in the\r\n  streets on the sale of engraved, gelatine,\r\n  and playing-cards, during the\r\n  year, amounts to                                   £282\r\n\r\n  _Street-seller of Stenographic Cards._\r\n\r\n  There is only 1 individual “working”\r\n  stenographic cards in the streets\r\n  of London, and the number he sells in\r\n  the course of the year is 7,448 cards,\r\n  at 1_d._ each, amounting to                         £31      4\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Long Songs._\r\n\r\n  I am assured, that if 20 persons were\r\n  selling long songs in the street last\r\n  summer (during a period of 12 weeks),\r\n  it was “the outside;” as long songs\r\n  are now “for fairs and races, and\r\n  country work.” Calculating that each\r\n  cleared 9_s._ in a week, and to clear that\r\n  took 15_s._, we find there is expended in\r\n  long songs in the streets annually                 £180\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Wall Songs (“Pinners-up.”)_\r\n\r\n  On fine summer days, the wall song-sellers\r\n  (of whom there are 30) take 2_s._\r\n  on an average. On short wintry days\r\n  they may not take half so much, and\r\n  on very foggy or rainy days they take\r\n  nothing at all. Reckoning that each\r\n  wall song-man now takes 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n  weekly (7_s._ being the profit), we find\r\n  there is expended yearly in London\r\n  streets, in the ballads of the pinners-up          £810\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Ballads (“Chaunters.”)_\r\n\r\n  There are now 200 chaunters, who\r\n  also sell the ballads they sing; the\r\n  average takings of each are 3_s._ per\r\n  day; altogether amounting to                     £4,680\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Executions, &c. (“Running Patterers.”)_\r\n\r\n  Some represent their average weekly\r\n  earnings at 12_s._ 6_d._ the year through;\r\n  some at 10_s._ 6_d._; and others at less\r\n  than half of 12_s._ 6_d._ Reckoning, however,\r\n  that only 9_s._ weekly is an average\r\n  profit per individual, and that 14_s._ be\r\n  taken to realise that profit, we find\r\n  there is expended yearly, on executions,\r\n  fires, deaths, &c., in London                    £3,276\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Dialogues, Litanies, &c. (Standing\r\n  Patterers.)_\r\n\r\n  If 20 standing patterers clear 10_s._\r\n  weekly, each, the year through, and\r\n  take 15_s._ weekly, we find there is\r\n  yearly expended in the standing patter\r\n  of London streets                                  £780\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of “Cocks” (Elopements, Love\r\n  Letters, &c.)_\r\n\r\n  There are now 8 men who sell\r\n  nothing but “Cocks,” each of whom\r\n  dispose daily of 6 dozen copies at 1/2_d._\r\n  per copy, or altogether, during the\r\n  year, 179,712 copies, amounting to                 £374      8_s._\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Conundrums--“Nuts to Crack,”\r\n  &c._\r\n\r\n  From the best information I could\r\n  acquire, it appears that fifteen men\r\n  may be computed as working conundrums\r\n  for two months throughout the\r\n  twelve, and clearing 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly,\r\n  per individual. The cost of the “Nuts\r\n  to Crack” (when new) is 5_d._ a dozen\r\n  to the seller; but old “Nuts” often\r\n  answer the purpose of the street-seller,\r\n  and may be had for about half the\r\n  price; the cost of the “Nut-crackers”\r\n  is 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ It may be calculated,\r\n  then, that to realize the\r\n  10_s._ 6_d._ above-mentioned 15_s._ must\r\n  be taken. This shows the street expenditure\r\n  in “Nuts to Crack” and\r\n  “Nut-crackers” to be yearly                         £90\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Exhibition Papers, Magical\r\n  Delusions, &c._\r\n\r\n  This trade is carried on only for a\r\n  short time in the winter, as regards the\r\n  magical portion; and I am informed\r\n  that, including the “Comic Exhibitions,”\r\n  it extends to about half of\r\n  the sum taken for conundrums; or to about           £45\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Secret Papers._\r\n\r\n  Supposing that 6 men last year\r\n  each cleared 6_s._ weekly, we find expended\r\n  yearly in the streets on this\r\n  rubbish                                             £93\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Play-bills and Books._\r\n\r\n  Taking the profits at 3_s._ a week,\r\n  at cent. per cent. on the outlay, and\r\n  reckoning 200 sellers, including those\r\n  at the saloons, concert-rooms, &c.,\r\n  there is expended yearly on the sale\r\n  of play-bills purchased in the streets\r\n  of London                                        £3,120\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Back Numbers._\r\n\r\n  There are now 40 vendors in the\r\n  streets of London, each selling upon\r\n  an average 3 dozen copies daily, at 1/2_d._\r\n  each, or during the year 336,960 odd\r\n  numbers. Hence, the sum expended\r\n  annually in the streets for back numbers\r\n  of periodicals amounts to upwards of               £700\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Waste-paper at Billingsgate._\r\n\r\n  There are 4 individuals selling\r\n  waste-paper at Billingsgate, one of\r\n  whom informed me that from 70 to\r\n  100 pounds weight of “waste”--about\r\n  three-fourths being newspapers--is\r\n  supplied to Billingsgate market\r\n  and its visitants. The average\r\n  price is not less than 2-1/2_d._ a pound,\r\n  or from that to 3_d._ A single paper is\r\n  1_d._ Reckoning that 85 pounds of\r\n  waste-paper are sold a day, at 2-1/2_d._\r\n  per pound, we find that the annual\r\n  expenditure in waste-paper at Billingsgate\r\n  is upwards of                                      £275\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Tracts and Pamphlets._\r\n\r\n  From the information I obtained\r\n  from one of this class of street-sellers,\r\n  I find there are 40 individuals gaining\r\n  a livelihood in selling tracts and pamphlets\r\n  in the streets, full one half are\r\n  men of colour, the other half consists\r\n  of old and infirm men, and young\r\n  boys, the average takings of each is\r\n  about 1_s._ a day, the year through; the\r\n  annual street expenditure in the sale\r\n  of tracts and pamphlets is thus upwards of         £620\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Newspapers (Second Edition.)_\r\n\r\n  There are 20 who are engaged in\r\n  the street sale of newspapers, second\r\n  edition, each of whom take weekly\r\n  (for a period of 6 weeks in the year)\r\n  1_l._ 5_s._; so that, adopting the calculation\r\n  of my informant, and giving a\r\n  profit of 150 per cent., the yearly\r\n  expenditure in the streets, in second\r\n  editions, amounts to                               £150\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Newspapers, &c., at Steam-Boat\r\n  Piers._\r\n\r\n  I am informed that the average\r\n  earnings of these traders, altogether,\r\n  may be taken at 15_s._ weekly; calculating\r\n  that twelve carry on the trade\r\n  the year through, we find that (assuming\r\n  each man to sell at thirty-three\r\n  per cent. profit--though in the case\r\n  of old works it will be often cent. per\r\n  cent.), the sum expended annually\r\n  in steam-boat papers is upwards of               £1,500\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Books (by Auction)._\r\n\r\n  There are at present only 2 street-sellers\r\n  of books by auction in London,\r\n  whose clear weekly earnings are 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n  each. Calculating their profits at 250_l._\r\n  per cent., their weekly receipts will\r\n  amount to 35_s._ each per week; giving\r\n  a yearly expenditure of                             £91\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Books on Stalls and Barrows._\r\n\r\n  The number of book-stalls and barrows\r\n  in the streets of the metropolis is\r\n  70. The proprietors of these sell weekly\r\n  upon an average 42 volumes each. The\r\n  number of volumes annually sold in\r\n  the streets is thus 1,375,920, and reckoning\r\n  each volume sold to average 9_d._,\r\n  we find that the yearly expenditure in\r\n  the sale of books in the street amounts to       £5,733\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Guide-books._\r\n\r\n  The street-sellers of guide-books to\r\n  public places of amusement, are 16 in\r\n  number, the profit of each is 4_s._ weekly,\r\n  at 25 per cent., hence the takings must\r\n  be 20_s._; thus making the annual expenditure\r\n  in the street-sale of such books amount to         £832\r\n\r\n  _Street-sale of Song-books and Children’s books._\r\n\r\n  There are 30 street-sellers who vend\r\n  children’s books and song-books, and\r\n  dispose of, among them, 2 dozen each\r\n  daily, or during the year 224,640 books,\r\n  at 1_d._ each; hence the sum yearly expended\r\n  in the street-sale of children’s\r\n  books and song-books is                            £936\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Pictures in Frames._\r\n\r\n  If we calculate 40 persons selling pictures\r\n  in frames, and each taking 10_s._\r\n  weekly; we find the annual amount\r\n  spent in the streets in the sale of these\r\n  articles is                                      £1,040\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Prints and Engravings in\r\n  Umbrellas._\r\n\r\n  The street-sale of prints and engravings\r\n  in umbrellas lasts only 12 weeks.\r\n  There are 30 individuals who gain a\r\n  livelihood in the sale of these articles\r\n  during that period. The average takings\r\n  of each seller is 12_s._ weekly; so that\r\n  the annual street-expenditure upon\r\n  prints and engravings is                           £216\r\n\r\n  _Street-sellers of Manuscript Music._\r\n\r\n  There are only 4 sellers of manuscript\r\n  music in the streets, who take on an\r\n  average 4_s._ each weekly; hence we find\r\n  the annual expenditure in this article\r\n  amounts in round numbers to                         £40\r\n                                                  ------------------\r\n  TOTAL SUM EXPENDED YEARLY\r\n  IN THE STREETS ON STATIONERY,\r\n  LITERATURE, AND THE FINE ARTS                   £33,446     12_s._\r\n                                                  ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EPITOME OF THE PATTERING CLASS.\r\n\r\nI wish, before passing to the next subject--the street-sellers of\r\nmanufactured articles (of one of whom the engraving here given\r\nfurnishes a well-known specimen)--I wish, I say, as I find some\r\nmistakes have occurred on the subject, to give the public a general\r\nview of the patterers, as well as to offer some few observations\r\nconcerning the means of improving the habits of street-people in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe patterers consist of three distinct classes; viz., those who sell\r\nsomething, and patter to help off their goods; those who exhibit\r\nsomething, and patter to help off the show; and those who do nothing\r\nbut patter, with a view to elicit alms. Under the head of “Patterers\r\nwho sell” may be classed\r\n\r\n  Paper Workers,\r\n  Quack Doctors,\r\n  Cheap Jacks,\r\n  Grease Removers,\r\n  Wager Patterers,\r\n  Ring Sellers,\r\n  Dealers in Corn Salve,\r\n     „       Razor Paste,\r\n     „       French Polish,\r\n     „       Plating Balls,\r\n     „       Candle Shades,\r\n     „       Rat Poisons, &\r\n     „       Blacking,\r\n  Book Auctioneers.\r\n\r\nThe second class of patterers includes jugglers, showmen, clowns, and\r\nfortune-tellers; beside several exhibitors who invite public notice to\r\nthe wonders of the telescope or microscope.\r\n\r\nThe third and last class of patterers are those who neither sell nor\r\namuse, but only victimise those who get into their clutches. These (to\r\nuse their own words) “do it on the bounce.” Their general resort is an\r\ninferior public-house, sometimes a brothel, or a coffee-shop. One of\r\nthe tricks of these worthies is to group together at a window, and if\r\na well-dressed person pass by, to salute him with the contents of a\r\nflour-bag. One of their pals--better dressed than the rest--immediately\r\nwalks out, declares it was purely accidental, and invites the gentleman\r\nin “to be brushed.” Probably he consents, and still more probably, if\r\nhe be “good-natured,” he is plied with liquor, drugged with snuff for\r\nthe occasion, and left in some obscure court, utterly stupified. When\r\nhe awakes, he finds that his watch, purse, &c., are gone.\r\n\r\n“A casual observer, or even a stranger, may be induced to contract\r\na wayside acquaintance with the parties to whom I allude,” says one\r\nof the pattering class, from whom I have received much valuable\r\ninformation; “and if he be a visitor of fairs and races, that\r\nacquaintance, though slight, may sometimes prove expensive. But casual\r\nobservers cannot, from the complexity and varied circumstances of the\r\ncharacters now under notice, form anything like a correct view of them.\r\nI am convinced that no one can, but those who have visited their haunts\r\nand indeed lived among them for months together. They are not to be\r\nknown, any more than the great city was to be built, in a day. This\r\nadvantage--if so it may be called--has fallen to my lot.”\r\n\r\nThe three classes of patterers above enumerated must not be confounded.\r\nThe two first are essentially distinct from the last--at least\r\nthey do _something_ for their living; and though the pattering\r\nstreet-tradesmen may generally overstep the bounds of truth in their\r\nglowing descriptions of the virtues of the goods they sell, still it\r\nshould be remembered they are no more dishonest in their dealings than\r\nthe “enterprising” class of shopkeepers, who resort to the _printed_\r\nmode of puffing off their wares,--indeed the street-sellers are far\r\nless reprehensible than their more wealthy brother puffers of the\r\nshops, who cannot plead want as an excuse for their dishonesty. The\r\nrecent revelations made by the _Lancet_, as to the adulteration of the\r\narticles of diet sold by the London grocers, show that the patterers\r\nwho sell, practise far less imposition than some of our “merchant\r\nprinces.”\r\n\r\n “A tradesman in Tottenham-court Road, whose address the _Lancet_\r\n advertises gratis, thus proclaims the superior qualities of his\r\n ‘_Finest_ WHITE PEPPER. One package of this article, which is the\r\n interior part of the kernel of the finest pepper, being equal in\r\n strength to nearly three times the quantity of black pepper (which\r\n is the inferior, small, shrivelled berries, and often little more\r\n than husks), it will be not only the best but the cheapest for every\r\n purpose.’ This super-excellent pepper, ‘sold in packages, price\r\n 1_d._,’ was found on analysis to consist of finely-ground _black\r\n pepper, and a very large quantity of wheat-flour_.”\r\n\r\nIndeed the _Lancet_ has demonstrated that as regards tea, coffee,\r\narrow-root, sugar, and pepper sold by “pattering” shopkeepers, the\r\nrule invariably is that those are articles which are the most puffed,\r\nand “warranted free from adulteration,” and “to which the attention\r\nof families and _invalids_ is particularly directed as being of the\r\nfinest quality ever imported into this country,” are uniformly the most\r\nscandalously adulterated of all.\r\n\r\nWe should, therefore, remember while venting our indignation against\r\npattering street-sellers, that they are not the only puffers in the\r\nworld, and that they, at least, can plead poverty in extenuation of\r\ntheir offence; whereas, it must be confessed, that shopkeepers can have\r\nno other cause for their acts but their own brutalizing greed of gain.\r\n\r\nThe class of patterers with whom we have here to deal are those who\r\npatter to help off their goods--but while describing them it has\r\nbeen deemed advisable to say a few words, also, on the class who _do\r\nnothing but patter_, as a means of exciting commiseration to their\r\nassumed calamities. These parties, it should be distinctly understood,\r\nare in no way connected with the puffing street-sellers, but in the\r\nexaggerated character of the orations they deliver, they are mostly\r\nprofessional beggars--or bouncers (that is to say cheats of the lowest\r\n_kind_), and _will_ not work or do anything for their living. This, at\r\nleast, cannot be urged against the pattering street-sellers who, as was\r\nbefore stated, do _something_ for the bread they eat.\r\n\r\nFurther to show the extent, and system, of the lodging and routes\r\nthroughout the country of the class of “lurkers,” &c., here\r\ndescribed--as all resorting to those places--I got a patterer to write\r\nme out a list, from his own knowledge, of divers routes, and the extent\r\nof accommodation in the lodging-houses. I give it according to the\r\npatterer’s own classification.\r\n\r\n“_Brighton_ is a town where there is a great many furnished cribs,\r\nlet to needys (nightly lodgers) that are molled up,” [that is to say,\r\nassociated with women in the sleeping-rooms.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSURREY AND SUSSEX.\r\n\r\n                 Dossing Cribs,    Beds.

There was thirty\r\nstanding beds, besides make-shifts and furnished rooms, which were\r\ncalled ‘cottages.’ It’s not so bad now. The place was well-known to the\r\nmonkry, and you was reckoned flat if you hadn’t been there. The old\r\nwoman, when any female, old or young, who had no tin, came into the\r\nkitchen, made up a match for her with some men. Fellows half-drunk had\r\nthe old women. There was always a broomstick at hand, and they was both\r\nmade to jump over it, and that was called a broomstick wedding. Without\r\nthat ceremony a couple weren’t looked on as man and wife.

and as many are not imprisoned more\r\nthan a dozen times during their lives, and a few never at all, the\r\nnumber of tramps and beggars may be estimated, at the very lowest, at\r\n22,000 throughout England and Wales. The returns from Scotland are\r\nindeterminate. Of this wretched class many are aged and infirm; others\r\nare destitute orphans; while not a few are persons whose distress is\r\nreal, and who suffer from temporary causes.\r\n\r\n“With this excusable class, however, I have not now to do. Of\r\nprofessional beggars there are two kinds--those who ‘do it on the\r\n_blob_’ (by word of mouth), and those who do it by ‘_screeving_,’ that\r\nis, by petitions and letters, setting forth imaginary cases of distress.\r\n\r\n“Of these documents there are two sorts, ‘slums’ (letters) and\r\n‘fakements’ (petitions). These are seldom written by the persons who\r\npresent or send them, but are the production of a class of whom the\r\npublic little imagine either the number or turpitude. I mean the\r\n‘professional begging-letter writers.’\r\n\r\n“Persons who write begging-letters for others sometimes, though seldom,\r\nbeg themselves. They are in many cases well supported by the fraternity\r\nfor whom they write. A professional of this kind is called by the\r\n‘cadgers,’ ‘their man of business.’ Their histories vary as much as\r\ntheir abilities; generally speaking they have been clerks, teachers,\r\nshopmen, reduced gentlemen, or the illegitimate sons of members of the\r\naristocracy; while others, after having received a liberal education,\r\nhave broken away from parental control, and commenced the ‘profession’\r\nin early life, and will probably pursue it to their graves.\r\n\r\n“I shall take a cursory view of the various pretences set forth in\r\nthese begging documents,” says my informant, “and describe some of the\r\nscenes connected with their preparation. The documents themselves are\r\nmournful catalogues of all the ills that flesh is heir to.\r\n\r\n“I address myself first to that class of petitions which represent\r\nlosses by sea, or perhaps shipwreck itself. These documents are very\r\nseldom carried by one person, unless indeed he is really an old sailor;\r\nand, to the credit of the navy be it spoken, this is very seldom the\r\ncase. When the imposition under notice has to be carried out, it is,\r\nfor the most part, conducted by half-a-dozen worthless men, dressed in\r\nthe garb of seamen (and known as turnpike sailors), one of their number\r\nhaving really been at sea and therefore able to reply to any nautical\r\ninquiries which suspicion may throw out. This person mostly carries the\r\ndocument; and is, of course, the spokesman of the company. Generally\r\nspeaking, the gang have a subscription-book, sometimes only a fly-leaf\r\nor two to the document, to receive the names of contributors.\r\n\r\n“It may not be out of place here, to give a specimen--drawn from\r\nmemory--of one of those specious but deceitful ‘fakements’ upon which\r\nthe ‘swells,’ (especially those who have ‘been in the service,’)\r\n‘come down with a _couter_’ (sovereign) if they ‘granny the mauley’\r\n(perceive the signature) of a brother officer or friend. The document\r\nis generally as follows--\r\n\r\n“‘=These are to Certify=, to all whom it may concern, that the\r\nTHUNDERER, Captain Johnson, was returning on her homeward-bound passage\r\nfrom China, laden with tea, fruit, &c., and having beside, twenty\r\npassengers, chiefly ladies, and a crew of thirty hands, exclusive\r\nof the captain and other officers. That the said vessel encountered\r\na tremendous gale off the banks of Newfoundland, and was dismasted,\r\nand finally wrecked at midnight on’ (such a day, including the hour,\r\nlatitude, and other particulars). ‘That the above-named vessel speedily\r\nfoundered, and only the second mate and four of the crew (the bearers\r\nof this certificate) escaped a watery grave. These, after floating\r\nseveral days on broken pieces of the ship, were providentially\r\ndiscovered, and humanely picked up by the brig INVINCIBLE, Captain\r\nSmith, and landed in this town and harbour of Portsmouth, in the county\r\nof Hants. That we, the Master of Customs, and two of her Majesty’s\r\nJustices of the Peace for the said harbour and county, do hereby grant\r\nand afford to the said’ (here follows the names of the unfortunate\r\nmariners) ‘this our vouchment of the truth of the said wreck, and\r\ntheir connection therewith, and do empower them to present and use\r\nthis certificate for twenty-eight days from the date hereof, to enable\r\nthem to get such temporal aid as may be adequate to reaching their\r\nrespective homes, or any sea-port where they may be re-engaged. And\r\nthis certificate further showeth, that they are not to be interrupted\r\nin the said journey by any constabulary or other official authority;\r\nprovided, that is to say, that no breach of the peace or other\r\ncognizable offence be committed by the said Petitioners,\r\n\r\n  ‘As witness our hands,\r\n  _John Harris, M.C._                   £1    0    0\r\n  _James Flood, J.P._                    1    0    0\r\n  _Capt.

It would seem, from the example\r\ngiven, that such documents are available in every sea-port or other\r\nconsiderable town; but this is not the case. It is true that certain\r\nkinds of documents, especially sham hawkers’ licenses, may be had in\r\nthe provinces, at prices suited to the importance of their contents,\r\nor to the probable gains of their circulation; but all the ‘regular\r\nbang-up fakes’ are manufactured in the ‘Start’ (metropolis), and\r\nsent into the country to order, carefully packed up, and free from\r\nobservation. The following note, sent to ‘Carotty Poll, at Mrs.\r\nFinder’s Login-ouse facin the orse and trumpet bere shop han street\r\nWestminster London with spede,’ may tend to illuminate the uninitiated\r\nas to how such ‘fakements’ are obtained:\r\n\r\n ‘Dere pol--I ope this will find yu an george in good helth and\r\n spirits--things is very bad ere, yure sister Lizer has been konfined\r\n an got a fine strappin boye, they was very bad off wen it happend.\r\n they say in mi country it never ranes but it pores and so it was pol,\r\n for mi William as got a month along with Cockny Harry for a glim lurk\r\n and they kum out nex Mundie and i av porned my new shift and every\r\n indivigual thing to get them a brekfust and a drop a rum the mornin\r\n they kums out.

Lawyer Joe was soon sent for; and the following is an\r\noutline of the scene that occurred, given in my informant’s own words:\r\n\r\n“I had called at the house whither the above letter had been addressed,\r\nto inquire for a man whom I had known in his and my own better days.\r\nThe kitchen-door, or rather cellar-door, was thrust open, and in came\r\nCarrotty Poll herself.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Poll,’ asked the deputy, ‘how does the world use you?’\r\n\r\n“‘B-- bad,’ was the reply, ‘where’s Lawyer Joe?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, he’s just gone to Mother Linstead’s for some tea and sugar; here\r\nhe comes.’\r\n\r\n“‘Joe, I’ve a job for you. How much do you charge for screeving a\r\n“brake?”’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, half a bull (half-a-crown).’\r\n\r\n“‘No, I’ll give you a deuce o’ deeners (two shillings), co’s don’t ye\r\nsee the poor b-- is in “stir” (prison).’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, well, I shan’t stand for a tanner. Have you got paper?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, and a Queen’s head, and all.’\r\n\r\n“The pen and ink were found, a corner of the table cleared, and\r\noperations commenced.\r\n\r\n“‘He writes a good hand,’ exclaimed one, as the screever wrote the\r\npetition.\r\n\r\n“‘I wish I could do it,’ said another.\r\n\r\n“‘If you could, you’d soon be transported,’ said a third; while the\r\nwhole kitchen in one chorus, immediately on its completion, proclaimed,\r\nthat it was d--d well done, adding to that, not one ‘swell’ in a score\r\nwould view it in any other light than a ‘ream’ (genuine) concern.\r\n\r\n“Lawyer Joe was up to his trade--he folded the paper in official\r\nstyle--creased it as if it was long written and often examined,\r\nattached the signatures of the minister and churchwardens, and dipping\r\nhis fingers under the fireplace, smeared it with ashes, and made the\r\nwhole the best representation of a true account of ‘a horse in the mad\r\nstaggers’ and ‘a child in the measles’ that could be desired by the\r\noldest and best cadger on the monkry.\r\n\r\n“These professional writers are in possession of many autographs\r\nof charitable persons, and as they keep a dozen or more bottles of\r\ndifferent shades of ink, and seldom write two documents on exactly the\r\nsame sort of paper, it is difficult to detect the imposition. A famous\r\nlurker who has been previously alluded to in this work, was once taken\r\nbefore a magistrate at York whose _own_ signature was attached to his\r\nfakement. The imitation was excellent, and the ‘lurker’ swore hard and\r\nfast to the worthy justice that he (the justice) _did_ write it in\r\nhis own saddle-room, as he was preparing to ride, and gave him five\r\nshillings, too. The effrontery and firmness of the prisoner’s statement\r\ngained him his discharge!\r\n\r\n“It is not uncommon in extensive districts--say, for instance, a\r\nsection of a county taking in ten or a dozen townships--for a school\r\nof lurkers to keep a secretary and remit his work and his pay at the\r\nsame time. In London this functionary is generally paid by commission,\r\nand sometimes partly in food, beer, and tobacco. The following is a\r\nfair estimate of the scale of charges:\r\n\r\n                                                       _s._   _d._\r\n  Friendly letter                                       0      6\r\n  Long ditto                                            0      9\r\n  Petition                                              1      0\r\n  Ditto, with ream monekurs (genuine signatures)        1      6\r\n  Ditto, with gammy monekurs (forged names)             2      6\r\n  Very “heavy” (dangerous)                              3      0\r\n  Manuscript for a broken down author                  10      0\r\n  Part of a play for ditto                              7      6\r\n\r\n“To this I may add the prices of other articles in the begging line.\r\n\r\n  Loan of one child, without grub                       0      9\r\n  Two ditto                                             1      0\r\n  Ditto, with grub and Godfrey’s Cordial                0      9\r\n  If out after twelve at night, for each child, extra   0      2\r\n  For a school of children, say half-a-dozen            2      6\r\n  Loan of any garment, per day                          0      2\r\n  Going as a pal to vindicate any statement             1      0\r\n\r\n“Such is an outline, open to circumstantial variation, of the pay\r\nreceived for the sort of accommodation required.\r\n\r\n“There is a very important species of ‘lurking’ or ‘screeving,’ which\r\nhas not yet been alluded to.\r\n\r\n“It is well-known that in the colliery districts an explosion of\r\nfire-damp frequently takes place, when many lives are lost, and the men\r\nwho escape are often so wounded as to render amputation of a leg or\r\narm the only probable means of saving them from the grave. Of course\r\nthe accident, with every particular as to date and locality, goes the\r\nround of the newspapers. Such an event is a sort of God-send to the\r\nbegging-letter writer. If he is anything of a draughtsman, so much the\r\nbetter. He then procures a sheet of vellum, and heads it with a picture\r\nof an explosion, and exhibiting men, boys, and horses up in the air,\r\nand a few nearer the ground, minus a head, a leg, or an arm; with a\r\nbackground of women tearing their hair, and a few little girls crying.\r\nSuch a ‘fakement,’ professionally filled up and put into the hands of\r\nan experienced lurker, will bring the ‘amanuensis,’ or ‘screever,’\r\ntwo guineas at least, and the proceeds of such an expedition have in\r\nmany cases averaged 60_l._ per week. The lurker presenting this would\r\nhave to take with him three or four countrymen, dressed in the garb of\r\ncolliers, one at least knowing something of underground work. These\r\nhe would engage at ‘a bob a nob’ (one shilling each), and if he made\r\na good day, give them a ‘toothful o’ rum’ beside. As such men are\r\nalways left outside the jigger (door) of the houses, they are of course\r\nignorant of the state of the subscription-list.\r\n\r\n“A famous lurker, to whom we have previously referred, Nicholas A----,\r\nkept ‘a man of business’ to himself, and gave him from 5_s._ to 10_s._\r\n6_d._ per day. Nicholas, who was tolerably educated, could write very\r\nwell, but as his ‘secretary’ could imitate twelve different hands, he\r\nwas of course no trifling acquisition.\r\n\r\n“It would not be easy to trace the history of all, or even many of the\r\nmen, who pursue the begging-letter trade as professional writers. Many\r\nof the vagrant tribe write their own letters, but the vast majority\r\nare obliged to have assistance. Of course, they are sometimes detected\r\nby the fact that their conversation does not tally with the rhetorical\r\nstatement of the petition. The few really deserving persons, well-born\r\nand highly educated, who subsist by begging, are very retired and\r\ncautious in their appeals. They write concisely, and their statements\r\nare generally true to a certain extent, or perhaps rigidly so in\r\nrelation to an earlier part of their history. These seldom live in the\r\nvery common lodging-houses.\r\n\r\n“The most renowned of the tribe who write for others, and whose general\r\ntrade lies in forged certificates of bankruptcy, seizure of goods for\r\nrent, and medical testimonies to infirmity, is an Irishman, brought\r\nup in London, and who may be seen almost every night at the bar of a\r\ncertain public-house in Drury-lane. He lives, or did live, at one of\r\nthe model lodging-houses. Very few persons know his occupation. They\r\nsuppose that he is ‘connected with the press.’ Several years ago this\r\nperson, says one who knew this trade well, was ‘regularly hard up,’\r\nand made a tender of his services to a distinguished M.P., who took a\r\nlively interest in the emancipation of the Jews. He offered to visit\r\nthe provinces, hold meetings, and get up petitions. The hon. member\r\ntested his abilities, and gave him clothes and a ten-pound note to\r\ncommence operations. ‘I saw him’ (says my informant) ‘the same night,\r\nand he mooted the subject to me over a glass of whiskey-punch. ‘Not\r\nthat _I_ care (said he) if all the b--y Jews were in h--ll, but I must\r\ndo something.’\r\n\r\n“‘But how,’ asked my informant, ‘will you get up the meetings?--and\r\nthen the signatures, you know!’\r\n\r\n“‘Meetings!’ was the reply, ‘don’t mention it; I can get _millions of\r\nsignatures_!’\r\n\r\n“The pretended Jewish Advocate never left London. He got (from Ireland)\r\na box of old documents relative to bygone petitions for repeal, &c.,\r\nand on these he put a frontispiece suited to his purpose--got them\r\nsent to Bath and Bristol, and thence transmitted to his employer--who\r\npraised his perseverance, and sent more money to the post-office of\r\none of the above-named towns; this was countermanded to London, and\r\njovially spent at Tom Spring’s’ in Holborn.\r\n\r\n“Hitherto the movements of the begging-letter\r\nwriter--self-considered--have been chiefly dwelt upon. There is\r\nanother class of the fraternity, however, of whom some notice must\r\nhere be taken; viz., those, who to meet cases of great pretension,\r\nand consequent misgivings on the part of the noblemen or gentry to\r\nwhom fakements are presented, become referees to professional beggars.\r\nThese referees are kept by local ‘schools’ of beggars in well-furnished\r\napartments at respectable houses, and well dressed; their allowance\r\nvaries from 1_l._ to 3_l._ per week.\r\n\r\n“But the most expert and least suspected dodge is referring to some\r\ndignified person in the country; a person however who exists nowhere\r\nbut in imagination. Suppose (says my informant) I am a beggar, I apply\r\nto you for relief. Perhaps I state that I am in prospect of lucrative\r\nemployment, if I could get enough money to clothe myself. You plead the\r\nnumber of impositions; I consent to that fact, but offer you references\r\nas to the truth of my statement. I refer you to the Hon. and Rev.\r\nMr. Erskine, at Cheltenham (any name or place will do). You promise\r\nto write, and tell me to call in a few days; meanwhile, I assume the\r\nname of the gentleman to whom I have referred you, and write forthwith\r\nto the post-master of the town in question, requesting that any\r\nletter coming there directed to the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Erskine, may be\r\nforwarded to my present address. I thus discover what you have written,\r\nframe a flattering reply, and address it to you. I send it (under\r\ncover) to a pal of mine at Cheltenham, or elsewhere, who posts it; I\r\ncall half an hour after you receive it, and, being satisfied, you give\r\nme a donation, and perhaps introduce me to some of your friends. Thus I\r\nraise a handsome sum, and the fraud is probably never found out.\r\n\r\n“One of the London lurkers, who has good means of forming a calculation\r\non the subject, assures me that the average earnings of ‘lurkers’ in\r\nLondon alone (including those who write for them), cannot be less than\r\n6,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\n“Two of the class were lately apprehended, at the instance of the Duke\r\nof Wellington; on their persons was found fifteen sovereigns, one\r\nfive-pound note, a silver watch with gold guard, and two gold watches\r\nwith a ribbon attached to each; their subscription-book showed that\r\nthey had collected 620_l._ during the current year.\r\n\r\n“A man named M’Kensie--who was transported at the last Bristol\r\nAssizes--had just received a cheque for 100_l._ from a nobleman lately\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\n“Most of the ‘professionals’ of this class include a copy of the ‘Court\r\nGuide’ among their stock in trade. In this all the persons known to be\r\ncharitable, have the mark [cross in circle] set against their names.\r\nI have been furnished with a list of such persons, accompanied with\r\ncomments, from the note-book of ‘an old stager’ ‘thirty years on\r\nthe monkery,’ and, as he adds, ‘never quodded but twice.’\r\n\r\n“The late Queen Dowager.\r\n\r\nHon.

I must treat this\r\nsubject (for your work is not a theological magazine) without respect\r\nto doctrine, principle, or legislation.\r\n\r\n“The object of erecting churches in poor neighbourhoods is to benefit\r\nthe poor; why is it, then, that the instruction communicated should\r\nexercise so little influence upon the vicious, the destitute, and the\r\noutcast? Is it that Christian ordinances are less adapted to them\r\nthan to others? Or, rather, is it not that the public institutions\r\nof the clergy are not made _interesting_ to the wretched community\r\nin question? The great hindrance (in my opinion) to the progress of\r\nreligion among the unsettled classes is, that having been occasionally\r\nto church or chapel, and heard nothing but doctrinal lectures or\r\nfeverish mental effusions, they cannot see the application of these to\r\nevery-day trade and practice; and so they arrive at the conclusion,\r\nthat they can get as much or more good at home.\r\n\r\n“Our preachers seem to be _afraid_ of ascertaining the sentiments,\r\nfeelings, and habits of the more wretched part of the population; and,\r\nwithout this, their words will die away upon the wind, and no practical\r\necho answer their addresses.\r\n\r\n“It will, perhaps, relieve the monotony of this statement if I give\r\nan illustration communicated to me by a person well acquainted to\r\ndetermine the merits of the question.\r\n\r\n“Your readers will probably recollect the opposition experienced by\r\nDr. Hampden on his promotion to the bishopric of Hereford. Shortly\r\nafter the affair was settled, his lordship accepted an invitation to\r\npreach on behalf of the schools connected with the ‘ten new churches’\r\nof Bethnal-green. The church selected for the purpose was the one on\r\nFriar’s-mount. It was one July Sunday in 1849, and, as I well remember,\r\nthe morning was very wet; but, supposing the curiosity, or better\r\nmotives, of the public would induce a large congregation, I went to the\r\nchurch at half-past ten. The free-seats occupying the middle aisle were\r\nall filled, and chiefly with persons of the lowest and worst classes,\r\nmany of whom I personally knew, and was agreeably surprised to find\r\nthem in such a place.\r\n\r\n“I sat in the midst of the group, and at the elbow of a tall attenuated\r\nbeggar, known by the name of ‘Lath and Plaster,’ of whom it is but\r\njustice to say that he repeated the responsive parts of the service\r\nvery correctly. It is true he could not read; but having ‘larned a few\r\nprayers’ in the ‘Downs’ (Tothill-fields prison), ‘he always sed ’em,\r\nnight and morning, if he wasn’t drunk, and then he sed ’em _twice_ next\r\nday, ’cos,’ reasoned he, ‘I likes to rub off as I goes on.’\r\n\r\n“In course of time, the bishop made his appearance in the pulpit.\r\nHis subject was neglected education, and he illustrated it from the\r\nhistory of Eli.\r\n\r\n“I thought proper to hang back, and observe the group as they\r\npassed out of church. There was Tailor Tom, and Brummagem Dick, and\r\nKeate-street Nancy, and Davy the Duke, and Stationer George, and at\r\nleast two dozen more, most of whom were miserably clad, and several\r\napparently without a shirt. They were not, however, without halfpence;\r\nand as I was well known to several of the party, and flattered as being\r\n‘a very knowledgeable man,’ I was invited to the Cat and Bagpipes\r\nafterwards, to ‘have share of what was going.’\r\n\r\n“I was anxious,” continues my informant, “to learn from my companions\r\ntheir opinion of the right reverend prelate. They thought, to use their\r\nown words, ‘he was a jolly old brick.’ But did they think he was sound\r\nin opinion about the Trinity, or was he (as alleged) a Unitarian?\r\nThey did not even understand the meaning of these words. All they\r\n_did_ understand was, that ‘a top-sawyer parson at Oxford, called Dr.\r\nPussy,’ had ‘made himself disagreeable,’ and that some of the bishops\r\nand nobility had ‘jined him;’ that these had persecuted Dr. Hampden,\r\nbecause he was ‘more cleverer’ than themselves; and that Lord John\r\nRussell, who, generally speaking, was ‘a regular muff,’ had ‘acted like\r\na man’ in this instance, and ‘he ought to be commended for it; and,’\r\nadded the man who pronounced the above sentiment, ‘_it’s just a picture\r\nof ourselves_.’ To other ears than mine, the closing remark would have\r\nappeared impertinent, but I ‘tumbled to’ it immediately. It was a case\r\nof oppression; and whether the oppressors belonged to Oxford University\r\nor to Scotland-yard militated nothing against the aphorism: ‘it’s just\r\na picture of ourselves!’\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that these poor creatures understood the\r\n_circumstances_ better than they did the sermon; and my inference is,\r\nthat whether from the parochial pulpit, or the missionary exhortation,\r\nor in the printed form of a tract, those who wish to produce a\r\npractical effect must themselves be practical men. I, who have been in\r\nthe Christian ministry, and am familiar, unhappily, with the sufferings\r\nof men of every grade among the outcast, would say: ‘If you wish to\r\ndo these poor outcasts real good, you must mould your language to\r\ntheir ideas, get hold of their common phrases--those which tell so\r\npowerfully when they are speaking to each other--let them have their\r\nown _fashion_ of things, and, where it does not interfere with order\r\nand decency, use yourselves language which their unpolished minds will\r\nappreciate; and then, having gained their entire confidence, and,\r\nperhaps, their esteem, you may safely strike home, though it be as with\r\na sledge-hammer, and they will even ‘love you for the smart.’\r\n\r\n“The temperance movement next claims attention, and I doubt not that\r\nmuch crime and degradation has been prevented by total abstinence from\r\nall intoxicating drinks; but I would rather raise the tone of moral\r\nfeeling by intelligent and ennobling means than by those spasmodic\r\nefforts, which are without deliberation, and often without permanency.\r\nThe object sought to be obtained, however, is good,--so is the\r\nmotive,--and I leave to others to judge what means are most likely to\r\nsecure it.\r\n\r\n“I may also allude, as another means of reformation, to the\r\nRagged-schools which are now studding the localities of the poorest\r\nneighbourhoods. The object of these schools is, one would hope, to\r\ntake care of the uncared for, and to give instruction to those who\r\nwould be otherwise running wild and growing up as a pest to society.\r\nA few instances of real reform stand, however, in juxtaposition with\r\nmany of increased hardihood. I, as a man, seeing those who resort to\r\nragged-schools, cannot understand the propriety of insulting an honest\r\nthough ragged boy by classing him with a young thief; or the hope of\r\nimproving the juvenile female character where the sexes are brought in\r\npromiscuous contact, and left unrestrained on their way home to say and\r\ndo everything subversive of the good instruction they have received.”\r\n[It is right I should here state, that these are my informant’s own\r\nunbiassed sentiments, delivered without communication with myself on\r\nthe subject. I say thus much, because, my own opinions being known,\r\nit might perhaps appear as if I had exerted some influence over the\r\njudgment of my correspondent.]\r\n\r\n“The most efficient means of moral reform among the street-folk,\r\nappear to have been consulted by those who, in Westminster and other\r\nplaces, have opened institutions cheaper, but equally efficient, as the\r\nmechanics’ institutes of the metropolis. In these, for one farthing\r\nper night, three-halfpence a week, or sixpence a month, lectures,\r\nexhibitions, newspapers, &c., are available to the _very_ poor. These,\r\nand such as these, I humbly but earnestly would commend to public\r\nsympathy and support, believing that, under the auspices of heaven,\r\nthey may ‘deliver the outcast and poor’ from their own mistaken views\r\nand practices, and make them ornamental to that society to which they\r\nhave long been expensive and dangerous.”\r\n\r\nAnother laudable attempt to improve the condition of the poorer class\r\nis by the erection of model lodging-houses. The plan which induced this\r\nmeasure was good, and the success has been tolerable; but I am inclined\r\nto think the management of these houses, as well as their internal\r\nregulation, is scarcely what their well-meaning founders designed. The\r\nprincipal of these buildings is in George-street, St. Giles’s; the\r\nbuilding is spacious and well ventilated, there is a good library, and\r\nthe class of lodgers very superior to what might be expected. This\r\nlatter circumstance makes the house in question scarcely admissible to\r\nthe catalogue of reformed lodging-houses for the _very_ poor.\r\n\r\n“The next ‘model lodging-house’ in importance is the one in\r\nCharles-street, Drury-lane. This, from personal observation (having\r\nlodged in it more than four months),” says my informant, “I can safely\r\nsay (so far as social reform is concerned), is a miserable failure. The\r\nbed-rooms are clean, but the sitting-room, though large, is the scene\r\nof dirt and disorder. Noise, confusion, and intemperance abound from\r\nmorning till night.\r\n\r\n“There is a model lodging-house in Westminster, the private property\r\nof Lord Kinnaird. It is generally well conducted. His lordship’s agent\r\nvisits the place once a week. There is an almost profuse supply of\r\ncooking utensils and other similar comforts. There are, moreover, two\r\nspacious reading-rooms, abundance of books and periodicals, and every\r\nlodger, on payment of 6_d._, is provided with two lockers--one in his\r\nbed-room, and the other below-stairs. The money is returned when the\r\nperson leaves the house. There is divine service every day, conducted\r\nby different missionaries, and twice on Sundays. Attendance on these\r\nservices is optional; and as there are two ways of ingress and egress,\r\nthe devout and undevout need not come in contact with each other. The\r\nkitchen is very large and detached from the house. The master of this\r\nestablishment is a man well fitted for his situation. He is a native\r\nof Saffron Walden in Essex, where his father farmed his own estate.\r\nHe received a superior education, and has twice had a fortune at his\r\nown disposal. He _did_ dispose of it, however; and ‘after many roving\r\nyears,’ as a ‘traveller,’ ‘lurker,’ and ‘patterer,’ he has settled down\r\nin his present situation, and maintained it with great credit for a\r\nconsiderable period. The beds in this house are only 3_d._ per night,\r\nand no small praise is due to Lord Kinnaird for the superiority of this\r\n‘model’ over others of the same denomination.\r\n\r\n“Such are a few of the principal of these establishments. Giving every\r\ncredit to their founders, however, for purity and even excellence of\r\nmotive, I doubt if ‘model lodging-houses,’ as at present conducted,\r\nare likely to accomplish much real good for those who get their living\r\nin the streets. Ever and anon they are visited by dukes and bishops,\r\nlords and ladies, who march in procession past every table, scrutinise\r\nevery countenance, make their remarks upon the quantity and quality of\r\nfood, and then go into the lobby, sign their names, jump into their\r\ncarriages, and drive away, declaring that ‘after all’ there is not so\r\nmuch poverty in London as they supposed.\r\n\r\n“The poor inmates of these houses, moreover,” adds my informant,\r\n“are kept in bondage, and made to _feel_ that bondage, to the almost\r\nannihilation of old English independence. It is thought by the managers\r\nof these establishments, and with some share of propriety, that persons\r\nwho get their living by any honest means may get home and go to bed,\r\naccording to strict rule, at a certain prescribed hour--in one house it\r\nis ten o’clock, in the others eleven. But many of the best-conducted\r\nof these poor people, if they be street-folk, are at those very hours\r\nin the height of their business, and have therefore to pack up their\r\ngoods, and carry homeward their cumbersome and perhaps heavy load a\r\ndistance usually varying from two or three to six or seven miles. _If\r\nthey are a minute beyond time, they are shut out, and have to seek\r\nlodgings in a strange place. On their return next morning, they are\r\ncharged for the bed they were prevented from occupying, and if they\r\ndemur they are at once expelled!_ Thus the ‘model’ lodgers are kept, as\r\nit were, in leading-strings, and triumphed over by lords and ladies,\r\nmasters and matrons, who, while they pique themselves on the efforts\r\nthey are making to ‘better the condition of the poor,’ are making them\r\ntheir slaves, and driving them into unreasonable thraldom; while the\r\nrich and noble managers, reckless of their own professed benevolence,\r\nare making the poor poorer, by adding insult to wretchedness. If my\r\nremarks upon these establishments appear,” adds the writer of the above\r\nremarks, “to be invidious, it is only in ‘appearance’ that they are\r\nso. I give their promoters credit for the best intentions, and, as far\r\nas sanitary and moral measures are concerned, I rejoice in the benefit\r\nwhile suggesting the improvement.\r\n\r\n“Everything even moderately valuable has its counterfeit. We have\r\ncounterfeit money, counterfeit virtue, counterfeit modesty, counterfeit\r\nreligion, and last, but not least, ‘counterfeit model lodging-houses.’\r\nMany private adventurers have thus dignified their domiciles, and some\r\nof them highly merit the distinction, while with others it is only a\r\ncloak for greater uncleanliness and grosser immorality.\r\n\r\n“There has come to my knowledge the case of one man, who owns nearly\r\na dozen of these dens of infamy, in one of which a poor girl under\r\nfifteen was lately ruined by a gray-headed monster, who, according\r\nto the pseudo-‘model’ regulations, slept in an adjoining bed. The\r\nsham model-houses to which I more particularly allude,” says my\r\ncorrespondent, “are in Short’s-gardens, Drury-lane; Mill-yard,\r\nCable-street; Keate-street, Flower and Dean-street, Thrawl-street,\r\nSpitalfields; Plough-court, Whitechapel; and Union-court, Holborn. All\r\nof these are, _without exception_, twopenny brothels, head-quarters of\r\nlow-lived procuresses, and resorts of young thieves and prostitutes.\r\nEach of the houses is managed by a ‘deputy,’ who receives an income of\r\n8_s._ 2_d._ per week, out of which he has to provide coke, candles,\r\nsoap, &c. Of course it is impossible to do this from such small\r\nresources, and the men consequently increase their salaries by ‘taking\r\nin couples for a little while,’ purchasing stolen goods, and other\r\nnefarious practices. _Worse than all, the person owning these houses\r\nis a member of a strict Baptist church, and the son of a deceased\r\nminister. He lives in great splendour in one of the fashionable streets\r\nin Pimlico._\r\n\r\n“It still remains for me,” my correspondent continues, “to contemplate\r\nthe best agency for promoting the reformation of the poor. The ‘City\r\nMission,’ if properly conducted, as it brings many good men in close\r\ncontact with the ‘outcast and poor,’ might be made productive of real\r\nand extensive good. Whether it has done so, or done so to any extent,\r\nis perhaps an open question. Our town missionary societies sprang\r\nup when our different Christian denominations were not fully alive\r\nto the apprehension of their own duties to their poorer brethren,\r\nwho were lost to principle, conscience, and society. That the object\r\nof the London City Mission is most noble, needs no discussion, and\r\nadmits of no dispute. The method of carrying out this great object\r\nis by employing agents, who are required to give their whole time\r\nto the work, without engaging in any secular concerns of life; and\r\nregarding the operation of the work so done, I must say that great\r\ngood has resulted from the enterprise. At the commencement of the\r\nlabours of the Mission in any particular locality great opposition was\r\nmanifested, and a great amount of prejudice, with habits of the most\r\nimmoral kind--openly carried on without any public censure--had to be\r\novercome. The statements of the missionaries have from time to time\r\nbeen published, and lie recorded against us as a nation, of the glaring\r\nevils and ignorance of a vast portion of our people. It is principally\r\nowing to the city missionaries that the other portions of society have\r\nknown what they now do of the practices and habits of the poor; it is\r\nprincipally due to their exertions that schools have been established\r\nin connection with their labours; and the Ragged-schools--one of the\r\nprincipal movements of the last few years--are mainly to be attributed\r\nto their efforts.\r\n\r\n“A man,” says my informant in conclusion, “can receive little benefit\r\nfrom a thing he does not understand; the talk which will do for the\r\nsenate will not do for the cottage, and the argument which will do\r\nfor the study will not do for the man who spends all his spare time\r\nin a public-house. These remarks will apply to the distribution of\r\ntracts, which should be couched in the very language that is used by\r\nthe people to whom they are addressed; then the ideas will penetrate\r\ntheir understanding. Some years back I met with an old sailor in a\r\nlodging-house in Westminster, who professed a belief that there had\r\n_once_ been a God, but that he was either dead, or grown old and\r\ndiseased. He did not dispute the inspiration of the Bible. He believed\r\nthat there had been revelations made to our forefathers when God was\r\nalive and active, but that now the Almighty did not ‘fash’ (trouble)\r\nhimself about his creatures at all!\r\n\r\n“I endeavoured to instruct the man in his own rude language and ideas;\r\nand after he had thus been made to comprehend the doctrine of the\r\nAtonement, he said, ‘I see it all plain enough--though I’ve liked a\r\ndrop o’ drink, and been a devil among the gals, and all that, in my\r\ntime, if I’ll humble myself I can have it all wiped off; and, as the\r\nsong says, “We may be happy yet,” because, as the saying is, it’s all\r\nsquare with God A’mighty.’ Whether the sailor permanently reformed, I\r\nam unable to say, for I lost sight of him shortly after; at any rate he\r\n_understood_ the subject, and was thus qualified to profit by it. And\r\nwhat can the teachers of Christianity among the British heathen--herded\r\ntogether in courts and alleys--tell their poor ignorant hearers better\r\nthan the old sailor’s aphorism, ‘You have, indeed, gone astray from\r\nyour greatest and best Friend, but, if you so desire, “You may be happy\r\nyet,” because it’s all square with God A’mighty?’\r\n\r\n“Before quitting this subject, I would add, if you really wish to do\r\nthese poor creatures good, you must remember that your instructions are\r\nnot intended for so-called fashionable society, but for those who have\r\na fashion of their own. If you lose sight of this fact, your words will\r\ndie away upon the wind, and no echo in the hearts of these poor people\r\nwill answer your addresses.”\r\n\r\nThe above observations are from the pen of one who has not only had\r\nthe means, but is likewise possessed of the power, of judging as to\r\nthe effect of the several plans (now in course of operation) for\r\nthe reformation and improvement of the London poor. I have given\r\nthe comments in the writer’s own language, because I was anxious\r\nthat the public should know the opinions of the best informed of the\r\nstreet-people themselves on this subject; and I trust I need not say\r\nthat I have sought in no way to influence my correspondent’s judgment.\r\n\r\nI now subjoin a communication from a clergyman in the country, touching\r\nthe character of the tramps and lurkers frequenting his neighbourhood,\r\ntogether with some suggestions concerning the means of improving the\r\ncondition of the London poor. These I append, because it is advisable\r\nthat in so difficult a matter the sentiments of every one having\r\nsufficient experience, judgment, and heart to fit him to speak on the\r\nsubject should be calmly attended to, so that amid much counsel there\r\nmay be at least some little wisdom.\r\n\r\n“The subject of the welfare of our poorer brethren was one which\r\nengaged much of my attention twenty years ago, when studying for the\r\nbar at Lincoln’s Inn, before I entered into orders; and the inquiries,\r\n&c., then made by me in reference to London, are recalled by many of\r\nyour pages. I have pursued the same course, according to my limited\r\nmeans and opportunities (for my _benefice_, like thousands of others,\r\nis but 100_l._ a-year) in this neighbourhood, and there are very many\r\nof my clerical brethren, also, deeply anxious and exerting their means\r\nfor the country poor. The details given in your numbers as to the\r\ncountry tramps and patterers, I can fully corroborate from personal\r\nexperience and knowledge, so far as the country part of it. We _never_\r\ngive money to beggars here, on any pretence whatever. We never give\r\nclothes. We never give relief to a _naked_ or _half-naked_ man if we\r\ncan avoid it (the imposture is too barefaced). Medicine I _do_ give\r\noccasionally to the sick, or pretended sick, and _see_ them take it.\r\nEvery beggar may have _dry bread_, or three or four tracts to sell,\r\nbut never both. I know we are even thus _often_ imposed on; but it is\r\nbetter to run this risk than to turn away, by chance, a starving man;\r\nand I do see the mendicants often sit down on a field near, and eat the\r\ndry bread with ravenous look. The tramps sometimes come to church on\r\nSunday, and _then_ beg: but we never give even bread on Sunday, because\r\non that day they can get help at the Union workhouse, and it only\r\ntempts idlers. Sometimes we are days without a beggar, and then there\r\nwill be ten to twenty per day, and then all at once the stream stops.\r\nThere are no tramp lodging-houses in my parish (which is a village of\r\n600 or 700 people). Most of the burglaries hereabouts seem connected\r\nwith some inroad of tramps into the neighbourhood. The lodging-houses\r\nare very bad in some of the small towns near, but somehow the\r\nmagistrates cannot get them put down. The gentry are alive here to the\r\nevil of crowded cottages, &c., and are using efforts to build better\r\nand more decent ones. But the evil results from the little landowners,\r\nwho have an acre or two, or less, and build rows of cottages on them of\r\nthe scantiest dimensions, at high rents,--ten per cent. on the cost of\r\nbuilding. The rents of the gentry and nobility are very moderate to the\r\npoor, viz., scarcely two per cent. (beyond the yearly repairs) on the\r\nmarket value of the cottage.\r\n\r\n“In 1832 I succeeded in getting land allotments for the poor here, and\r\nmost of the parishes round have followed our example since. The success\r\n_to the poor_ has always depended on the rent being a _real_ rent, such\r\nas is paid by the land round about, and on the rules of good management\r\nand of payment of rent being rigidly enforced.\r\n\r\n“The character of the poor of England _must_ be raised, as well as\r\ntheir independence. They must not be left to lean on charity. I am sure\r\nthat the sterling worth of the English character can only be raised by\r\nthat means _to the surface_ of society among the poor. The “English”\r\nis a fine material, but the poor neither value, nor are benefited, by\r\nmawkish nonsense or excessive feeling.\r\n\r\n“I believe this parish was one of the most fearfully demoralized twenty\r\nyears ago. It was said there was not _one_ young female cottager of\r\nvirtuous character. There was not one man who was not, or had not\r\nbeen, a drunkard; and theft, fighting, &c., &c., were universal. It is\r\ngreatly better now--totally different--and I attribute the change to\r\nthe land allotments, the provident society, the village horticultural\r\nsociety, the lending library, the clothing club, the coal club, the\r\ncultivating a taste for music, &c., &c., as subsidiary to the more\r\ndirectly pastoral work of a clergyman, and the schools, &c.\r\n\r\n“I am probably visionary in my ideas, but the perusal of your pages\r\nhas led me to think that, were I clergyman of a parish where the\r\nstreet-folks _lived_, I should aim at some schemes of this style, in\r\naddition to the benefit society and loan society (the last _most_\r\nimportant) as proposed by yourself.\r\n\r\n“(1) To get music taught at 1/2_d._ a week, or something of the\r\nkind--_a ragged-school music-room_, if the people would learn gratis,\r\nwould be still better--as a _step_ to a “superior” music class at 1_d._\r\nper week.\r\n\r\n“(2) To get the poor to adorn their rooms _plentifully_ with a better\r\nclass of pictures--of places, of people, of natural history, and of\r\nhistorical and religious subjects--just as they might like, and a\r\ncirculating library for pictures if they preferred change. This I find\r\ntakes with the village poor. Provide these things excessively cheap\r\nfor them--at _nominal prices_, just high enough to prevent them being\r\n_sold_ at a profit by the poor.\r\n\r\n“(3) To establish a monthly or fortnightly sheet--or little book for\r\nthe poor--at 1/2_d._, or some trifle, _full of pictures_ such as they\r\nwould like, but free from impropriety. It might be called ‘The Coster’s\r\nBarrow,’ or some name which would take their fancy, and contain\r\npictures for those who cannot read, and reading for those who can.\r\nIts contents should be instructive, and yet lively; as for instance,\r\nthe ‘History of London Bridge,’ ‘History of a Codfish,’ ‘Travels of\r\nWhelks,’ ‘Dreams of St. Paul’s,’ (old History of England), ‘Voice\r\nfrom the Bottom of the Coal Exchange’ (Roman tales), ‘True Tale of\r\nTrafalgar,’ &c., &c. All _very short articles_, at which perhaps they\r\nmight be angry, or praise, or abuse, or _do anything_, but still would\r\nread, or hear, and talk about. If possible, the little work might have\r\na corner called, ‘The Next World’s Page,’ or any name of the kind,\r\nwith _nothing_ in it but the Lord’s Prayer, or the Creed, or the Ten\r\nCommandments, or a Parable, or Miracle, or discourse of Christ’s--in\r\nthe exact words of Scripture--without _any_ commentary; which could\r\nneither annoy the Roman Catholics nor others. Those parts in which the\r\nDouay version differs from ours might be avoided, and the Romanists be\r\ngiven to understand that they would _always_ be avoided.\r\n\r\n“The more difficult question of cheap amusements instead of the\r\ndemoralizing ones now popular, is one which as yet I cannot see my way\r\nthrough---but it is one which _must_ be grappled with if any good is to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n“I write thus,” adds my correspondent, “because I feel you are a\r\nfellow-worker--so far as your labours show it, for the cause of God’s\r\npoor--and therefore will sympathize in anything another worker can say\r\nfrom experience on the same subject.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions of two of my correspondents--each looking at\r\nthe subject from different points of view--the one living among the\r\npeople of whom he treats, and daily witnessing the effects of the\r\nseveral plans now in operation for the moral and physical improvement\r\nof the poor, and the other in frequent intercourse with the tramps and\r\nlurkers, on their vagrant excursions through the country, as well as\r\nwith the resident poor of his own parish--the former living in friendly\r\ncommunion with those of whom he writes, and the latter visiting them as\r\ntheir spiritual adviser and material benefactor.\r\n\r\nI would, however, before passing to the consideration of the next\r\nsubject, here pause to draw special attention to the distinctive\r\nfeatures of the several classes of people obtaining their livelihood in\r\nthe streets. These viewed in regard to the _causes_ which have induced\r\nthem to adopt this mode of life, may be arranged in three different\r\ngroups, viz.:\r\n\r\n(1.) Those who are _bred_ to the streets.\r\n\r\n(2.) Those who _take_ to the streets.\r\n\r\n(3.) Those who are _driven_ to the streets.\r\n\r\nThe class bred to the streets are those whose fathers having been\r\nstreet-sellers before them, have sent them out into the thoroughfares\r\nat an early age to sell either watercresses, lavender, oranges, nuts,\r\nflowers, apples, onions, &c., as a means of eking out the family\r\nincome. Of such street-apprenticeship several notable instances have\r\nalready been given; and one or two classes of juvenile street-sellers,\r\nas the lucifer match, and the blacking-sellers, still remain to be\r\ndescribed. Another class of street-apprentice is to be found in the\r\nboys engaged to wheel the barrows of the costers, and who are thus at\r\nan early age tutored in all the art and mystery of street traffic,\r\nand who rarely abandon it at maturity. These two classes may be said\r\nto constitute the _natives_ of the streets--the tribe _indigenous_\r\nto the paving-stones--imbibing the habits and morals of the gutters\r\nalmost with their mothers’ milk. To expect that children thus nursed\r\nin the lap of the kennel, should when men not bear the impress of\r\nthe circumstances amid which they have been reared, is to expect to\r\nfind costermongers heroes instead of ordinary human beings. We might\r\nas well blame the various races on the face of the earth for those\r\nseveral geographical peculiarities of taste, which constitute their\r\nnational characteristics. Surely there is a moral acclimatisation as\r\nwell as a physical one, and the heart may become inured to a particular\r\natmosphere in the same manner as the body; and even as the seed of\r\nthe apple returns, unless grafted, to its original crab, so does the\r\nchild, without training, go back to its parent stock--the vagabond\r\nsavage. For the bred and born street-seller, who inherits a barrow as\r\nsome do coronets, to be other than he is--it has here been repeatedly\r\nenunciated--is no fault of his but of ours, who could and yet _will_\r\nnot move to make him otherwise. Might not “the finest gentleman in\r\nEurope” have been the greatest blackguard in Billingsgate, had he\r\nbeen born to carry a fish-basket on his head instead of a crown? and\r\nby a parity of reasoning let the roughest “rough” outside the London\r\nfish-market have had his lot in life cast, “by the Grace of God, King,\r\nDefender of the Faith,” and surely his shoulders would have glittered\r\nwith diamond epaulettes instead of fish scales.\r\n\r\nI say thus much, to impress upon the reader a deep and devout sense,\r\nthat we who have been appointed to another state, are, by the grace\r\nof God, what we are, and from no special merit of our own, to which,\r\nin the arrogance of our self-conceit, we are too prone to attribute\r\nthe social and moral differences of our nature. Go to a lady of\r\nfashion and tell her she could have even become a fishfag, and she\r\nwill think you some mad ethnologist (if indeed she had ever heard of\r\nthe science). Let me not, however, while thus seeking to impress the\r\nreader’s mind with a sense of the “antecedents” of the human character,\r\nbe thought to espouse the doctrine that men are _merely_ the creatures\r\nof events. All I wish to enforce is, that the three common causes\r\nof the social and moral differences of individuals are to be found\r\nin _race_, _organization_, and _circumstances_--that none of us are\r\nentirely proof against the influence of these three conditions--the\r\n_ethnological_, the _physiological_, and the _associative_ elements\r\nof our idiosincracy. But, while I admit the full force of external\r\nnature upon us all, while I allow that we are, in many respects, merely\r\npatients, still I cannot but perceive that, in other respects we are\r\nself-agents, moving rather than being moved, by events--often stemming\r\nthe current of circumstances, and at other times giving to it a special\r\ndirection rather than being swept along with it. I am conscious that\r\nit is this directive and controlling power, not only over external\r\nevents, but over the events of my own nature, that distinguishes me\r\nas well from the brute of the fields as it does my waking from my\r\nsleeping moments. I know, moreover, that in proportion as a man is\r\nactive or passive in his operations, so is his humanity or brutality\r\ndeveloped; that true greatness lies in the superiority of the internal\r\nforces over the external ones; and that as heroes, or extraordinary\r\nmen are heroes, because they overcome the sway of one or other, or\r\nall, of the three material influences above-named, so ordinary people\r\nare ordinary, simply because they lack energy--principle--will (call\r\nit what you please) to overcome the material elements of their nature\r\nwith the spiritual. And it is precisely because I know this, that I\r\n_do_ know that those who are bred to the streets must bear about them\r\nthe moral impress of the kennel and the gutter--unless _we_ seek to\r\ndevelope the inward and controlling part of their constitution. If we\r\nallow them to remain the creatures of circumstances, to wander through\r\nlife principleless, purposeless, conscienceless--if it be their lot to\r\nbe flung on the wide waste of waters without a “guiding star” above,\r\nor a rudder or compass within, how can _we_ (the well-fed) _dare_\r\nto blame them because, wanting bread, they prey and live upon their\r\nfellow-creatures?\r\n\r\nI say thus much, because I feel satisfied that a large portion of\r\nthe street-folk--and especially those who have been _bred_ to the\r\nbusiness--are of improvable natures; that they crave knowledge, as\r\nstarving men for “the staff of life;” that they are most grateful\r\nfor instruction; that they are as deeply moved by any kindness and\r\nsympathy (when once their suspicion has been overcome) as they are\r\nexcited by any wrong or oppression--and I say it moreover, because\r\nI feel thoroughly convinced of the ineffectiveness of the present\r\neducational resources for the poor. We think, if we teach them\r\nreading and writing, and to chatter a creed, that we have armed them\r\nagainst the temptations, the trials, and the exasperations of life,\r\nbelieving, because we have put the knife and fork in their hands that\r\nwe have really filled with food the empty bellies of their brains. We\r\nexercise their memories, make them human parrots, and then wonder that\r\nthey do not act as human beings. The intellect, the conscience, the\r\ntaste, indeed all that refines, enlightens, and ennobles our nature,\r\nwe leave untouched, to shrivel and wither like unused limbs. The\r\nbeautiful, the admirable, the true, the right, are as hidden to them\r\nas at their first day’s schooling. We impress them with no purpose,\r\nanimate them with no principle; they are still the same brute creatures\r\nof circumstances--the same passive instruments--human waifs and\r\nstrays--left to be blown about as the storms of life may whirl them.\r\n\r\nOf the second group, or those who _take_ to the streets, I entertain\r\nvery different opinions. This class is distinguished from that above\r\nmentioned, in being wanderers by choice, rather than wanderers by\r\nnecessity. In the early chapters of this work, I strove to point\r\nout to my readers that the human race universally consisted of two\r\ndistinct classes: the wanderers and the settlers--the civilized and\r\nthe savage--those who _produced_ their food, and those who merely\r\n_collected_ it. I sought further to show, that these two classes were\r\nnot necessarily isolated, but that, on the contrary, almost every\r\ncivilized tribe had its nomadic race, like parasites, living upon it.\r\nThese nomadic races I proved, moreover, to have several characteristics\r\ncommon to the class, one of the most remarkable of which was, their\r\nadoption of a _secret_ language, with the intent of concealing their\r\ndesigns and exploits. “Strange to say,” I then observed, “that despite\r\nits privations, dangers, and hardships, those who have once taken to\r\na wandering life rarely abandon it. There are countless instances,” I\r\nadded, “of white men adopting all the usages of an Indian hunter; but\r\nthere is not one example of the Indian hunter or trapper, adopting the\r\nsteady and regular habits of civilized society.” That this passion\r\nfor “a roving life” (to use the common expression by which many of\r\nthe street-people themselves designate it), is a marked feature of\r\nsome natures, there cannot be a doubt in the mind of any one who\r\nhas contemplated even the surface differences of human beings; and\r\nnevertheless it is a point to which no social philosopher has yet drawn\r\nattention. To my mind, it is essentially the _physical_ cause of crime.\r\nToo restive and volatile to pursue the slow process of production,\r\nthe wanderers, and consequently the _collectors_, of subsistence must\r\n(in a land where all things are appropriated) live upon the stock of\r\nthe _producers_. The nomadic or vagrant class have all an universal\r\ntype, whether they be the Bushmen of Africa or the “tramps” of our own\r\ncountry; and Mr. Knapp, the intelligent master of the Wandsworth and\r\nClapham Union, to whom I was referred at the time of my investigations\r\ntouching the subject of vagrancy, as having the greatest experience\r\nupon the matter, gave me the following graphic account, which, as I\r\nsaid at the time of its first publication, had perhaps never been\r\nsurpassed as an analysis of the habits and propensities of the vagabond\r\nclass:\r\n\r\n“Ignorance,” to use the gentleman’s own words, “is certainly not\r\ntheir prevailing characteristic: indeed, with a few exceptions, it is\r\nthe reverse. The vagrants are mostly distinguished by their aversion\r\nto continuous labour of any kind. He never knew them to work. Their\r\ngreat inclination is to be on the move, and wandering from place to\r\nplace, and they appear to receive a great deal of pleasure from the\r\nassembly and conversation of the casual ward. They are physically\r\nstout and healthy, and certainly not emaciated or sickly. They belong\r\nespecially to the able-bodied class, being, as he says, full of\r\nhealth and mischief. They are very stubborn and self-willed. They are\r\na most difficult class to govern, and are especially restive under\r\nthe least restraint; they can ill brook control, and they find great\r\ndelight in thwarting the authorities. They are particularly fond of\r\namusements of all kinds. He never knew them love reading. They mostly\r\npass under fictitious names. They are particularly distinguished by\r\ntheir libidinous propensities. They are not remarkable for a love of\r\ndrink. He considers them to be generally a class possessing the keenest\r\nintellect, and of a highly enterprising character. They seem to have\r\nno sense of danger, and to be especially delighted with such acts as\r\ninvolve any peril. They are likewise characterised by their exceeding\r\nlove of mischief. They generally are of a most restless and volatile\r\ndisposition. They have great quickness of perception, but little power\r\nof continuous attention or perseverance. They have a keen sense of the\r\nridiculous, and are not devoid of deep feeling. In the summer they\r\nmake regular tours through the country, visiting all places that they\r\nhave not seen. They are perfectly organized, so that any regulation\r\naffecting their comforts or interests becomes known among the whole\r\nbody in a remarkably short space of time.”\r\n\r\nEvery day my inquiries add some fresh proof to the justice of the above\r\nenumeration of the several phenomena distinguishing this class. To the\r\nmore sedate portion of the human family, the attractions of “a roving\r\nlife” are inexplicable. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that, to\r\nthe more volatile, the mere muscular exercise and the continual change\r\nof scene, together with the wild delight which attends the overcoming\r\nof any danger, are sources of pleasure sufficient to compensate for all\r\nthe privations and hardships attending such a state of existence.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruxton, one of the many who have passed from settlers to wanderers,\r\nhas given us the following description of the enjoyments of a life in\r\nthe wilderness:\r\n\r\n“Although liable to an accusation of barbarism, I must confess that the\r\nvery happiest moments of my life have been spent in the wilderness of\r\nthe Far West; and I never recall, but with pleasure, the remembrance\r\nof my solitary camp in the Bayou Solade, with no friend near me more\r\nfaithful than my rifle, and no companions more sociable than my good\r\nhorse and mules, or the attendant cayute which nightly serenaded us.\r\nSeldom did I ever wish to change such hours of freedom for all the\r\nluxuries of civilized life; and unnatural and extraordinary as it\r\nmay appear, yet such is the fascination of the life of the mountain\r\nhunter, that I believe not one instance could be adduced of even the\r\nmost polished and civilized of men, who had once tasted the sweets\r\nof its attendant liberty and freedom from every worldly care, not\r\nregretting the moment when he exchanged it for the monotonous life of\r\nthe settlements, nor sighing and sighing again once more to partake of\r\nits pleasures and allurements.”\r\n\r\nTo this class of voluntary wanderers belong those who _take_ to the\r\nstreets, glad to exchange the wearisomeness and restraint of a settled\r\noccupation for the greater freedom and license of a nomad mode of\r\nlife. As a class, they are essentially the non-working, preferring,\r\nas I said before, to _collect_, rather than _produce_, what they eat.\r\nIf they sell, they do so because for sundry reasons they fear to\r\ninfringe the law, and as traders their transactions certainly are not\r\nmarked by an excess of honesty. I am not aware that any of them are\r\nprofessional thieves (for these are the more daring portion of the\r\nsame vagrant fraternity), though the majority assuredly are habitual\r\ncheats--delighting in proving their cleverness by imposing upon\r\nsimple-minded citizens--viewing all society as composed of the same\r\ndishonest elements as their own tribes, and looking upon all sympathy\r\nand sacrifice, even when made for their own benefit, as some “artful\r\ndodge” or trick, by which to snare them.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that there are many grades\r\nof vagrants among us, and that though they are all essentially\r\nnon-producing and, consequently, predatory, still many are in no way\r\ndistinguished from a large portion of even our wealthy tradesmen--our\r\npuffing grocers and slopsellers. To attempt to improve the condition of\r\nthe voluntary street-sellers by teaching of any kind, would be to talk\r\nto the wind. We might as well preach to Messrs. Moses, Nicol, and Co.,\r\nin the hope of Christianising them. Those who _take_ to the streets\r\nare _not_, like those who are _bred_ to it, an uneducated class. They\r\nare intelligent and “knowing” enough, and it is this development of\r\ntheir intellect at the expense of their conscience which gives rise to\r\nthat excessive admiration of mere cleverness, which makes skill the\r\nsole standard of excellence with them. They approve, admire, venerate\r\nnothing but what is ingenious. Wrong with them is mere folly--right,\r\ncunning; and those who think the simple cultivation of the intellect\r\nthe great social panacea of the time, have merely to study the\r\ncharacteristics of this class to see how a certain style of education\r\ncan breed the very vice it seeks to destroy. Years ago, I wrote and\r\nprinted the following passage, and every year since my studies have\r\nconvinced me more and more of its truth:\r\n\r\n“Man, if deprived of his intellect, would be the most miserable and\r\ndestitute,--if of his sympathy, the most savage and cunning, of all the\r\nbrute creation: consequently, we may infer that, according as solely\r\nthe one or the other of these powers is expanded in us, so shall we\r\napproximate in our nature either to the instinct of the brute or to\r\nthe artifice of the demon, and that only when they are developed in\r\nan equal degree, can Man be said to be educated as Man. We should\r\nremember that the intellect simply executes; it is either the selfish\r\nor moral propensity that designs. The intellectual principle enables\r\nus to perceive the means of attaining any particular object; it is the\r\nselfish or else the moral principle in us, that causes us originally\r\nto desire that object. The two latter principles are the springs, the\r\nformer is merely the instrument of all human action. They are masters,\r\nwhereas the intellect is but the servant of the will; and hence it\r\nis evident that in proportion as the one or the other of these two\r\npredominant principles--as either the selfish or the moral disposition\r\nis educed in man, and thus made the chief director and stimulus of the\r\nintellectual power within him, so will the cultivation of that power be\r\nthe source of happiness or misery to himself and others.”\r\n\r\nThe third and last class, namely, those who are _driven_ to the\r\nstreets, is almost as large as any. Luckily, those who _take_ to that\r\nmode of life, are by far the least numerous portion of the street-folk;\r\nand if those who are bred to the business are worthy of our pity,\r\nassuredly those who are driven to it are equally, if not more, so.\r\nWith some who are deprived of the means of obtaining a maintenance for\r\nthemselves, the sale of small articles in the streets may, perhaps,\r\nbe an excuse for begging; but in most cases, I am convinced it is\r\nadopted from a horror of the workhouse, and a disposition to do, at\r\nleast, _something_ for the food they eat. Often is it the last struggle\r\nof independence--the desire to give something like an equivalent for\r\nwhat they receive. Over and over again have I noticed this honourable\r\npride, even in individuals who, from some privations or affliction\r\nthat rendered them utterly incompetent to labour for their living,\r\nhad a just claim on our sympathies and assistance. The blind--the\r\ncripple--the maimed--the very old--the very young--all have generally\r\nadopted a street-life, because they could do nothing else. With\r\nmany it is the last resort of all. The smallness of the stock-money\r\nrequired--for a shilling, it has been shown, is sufficient to commence\r\nseveral street-trades--is one of the principal causes of so many of\r\nthose who are helpless taking to the street-traffic. Moreover, the\r\nseverity of the Poor-laws and the degradation of pauperism, and the\r\naversion to be thought a common beggar by all, except the very lowest,\r\nare, I have no doubt, strong incentives to this course. There are\r\nmany callings which are peculiar, as being followed principally by\r\nthe disabled. The majority of the blind are musicians, or boot-lace\r\nor tape-sellers. The very old are sellers of watercresses, lucifers,\r\npincushions, ballads, and pins and needles, stay-laces, and such small\r\narticles as are light to carry, and require but a few pence for the\r\noutlay. The very young are sellers of flowers, oranges, nuts, onions,\r\nblacking, lucifers, and the like. Many of those who have lost an arm,\r\nor a leg, or a hand, turn showmen, or become sellers of small metal\r\narticles, as knives or nutmeg-graters; and many who have been born\r\ncripples may be seen in the streets struggling for self-support. But\r\nall who are _driven_ to the streets have not been physically _disabled_\r\nfor labour. Some have been _reduced_ from their position as tradesmen\r\nor shopmen; others, again, have been gentlemen’s servants and clerks;\r\nall, dragged down by a series of misfortunes, sometimes beyond their\r\ncontrol, and sometimes brought about by their own imprudence or\r\nsluggishness. As we have seen, many are reduced to a state of poverty\r\nby long illness, and on their recovery are unable, from want of clothes\r\nor friends, to follow any other occupation.\r\n\r\nBut a still larger class than all, are the beaten-out mechanics and\r\nartizans, who, from want of employment in their own trade, take to make\r\nup small things (as clothes-horses, tin-ware, cutlery, brushes, pails,\r\ncaps, and bonnets) on their own account. The number of artizans in the\r\nLondon streets speaks volumes for the independence of the working-men\r\nof this country; as well as for the difficulty of their obtaining\r\nemployment at their own trades. Those who are unacquainted with the\r\nsterling pride of the destitute English mechanic, know not what he will\r\nsuffer before becoming an inmate of a workhouse, or sinking to the\r\ndebasement of a beggar. That handicraftsmen do occasionally pass into\r\n“lurkers” I know well; but these, I am convinced, have gradually been\r\nwarped to the life by a long course of tramping, aided by the funds\r\nof their societies, and thus becoming disused to labour, have, after\r\nforfeiting all claims upon the funds of their trade, adopted beggary as\r\na means of subsistence. But, that this is the exception rather than the\r\nrule, the following is sufficient to show:\r\n\r\n“The destitute mechanics,” said the Master of the Wandsworth and\r\nClapham Union to me, “are entirely a different class from the regular\r\nvagrants; they have different habits, and indeed different features.\r\nDuring the whole of my experience I never knew a distressed artizan\r\nwho applied for a night’s shelter, commit an act of theft; and I have\r\nseen them,” he added, “in the last stage of destitution. Occasionally\r\nthey have sold the shirt and waistcoat off their backs before they\r\napplied for admittance into the workhouse, while some of them have been\r\nso weak from long starvation that they could scarcely reach the gate,\r\nand indeed had to be kept for several days in the Infirmary before\r\ntheir strength was recruited sufficiently to continue their journey.”\r\n“The poor mechanic,” said another of my informants, “will sit in the\r\ncasual ward like a lost man, scared. It’s shocking to think a decent\r\nmechanic’s houseless. When he’s beat out he’s like a bird out of a\r\ncage; he doesn’t know where to go, or how to get a bit.”\r\n\r\nI shall avail myself of another occasion to discuss the means of\r\nimproving the condition of the street-people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese traders consist of: (1) The vendors of metal articles; (2) Of\r\nchemical articles; (3) Of China, glass, and stone articles; (4) Of\r\nlinen, cotton, and other textile fabrics; and (5) Of miscellaneous\r\narticles. In this classification I do not include second-hand articles,\r\nnor yet the traffic of those who make the articles they sell, and who\r\nare indeed street-artizans rather than street-sellers.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head are included, the vendors of razors, table\r\nand penknives, tea-trays, dog-collars, key-rings, articles of\r\nhardware, small coins and medals, pins and needles, jewellery,\r\nsnuffers, candlesticks, articles of tin-ware, tools, card-counters,\r\nherring-toasters, trivets, gridirons, pans, tray-stands (as in the\r\nroasting of meat), and Dutch ovens.\r\n\r\nOf the second description are the vendors of blacking, black-lead,\r\nlucifer matches, corn-salves, grease-removing compositions, china\r\nand glass cements, plating-balls, rat and beetle poisons, crackers,\r\ndetonating-balls, and cigar-lights.\r\n\r\nUnder the third head come all street-sold articles of China, glass,\r\nor stone manufacture, including not only “crockery,” but vases,\r\nchimney-ornaments, and stone fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fourth head presents the street-vending of cotton, silken, and\r\nlinen-manufactures; such as sheetings, shirtings, a variety of laces,\r\nsewing cotton, threads and tapes, articles of haberdashery and of\r\nmillinery, artificial flowers, handkerchiefs, and pretended smuggled\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nAmong the fifth class, or the “miscellaneous” street-sellers, are\r\nthose who vend cigars, pipes, tobacco and snuff-boxes and cigar-cases,\r\naccordions, spectacles, hats, sponge, combs and hair-brushes,\r\nshirt-buttons and coat-studs, “lots,” rhubarb, wash-leather,\r\npaper-hangings, dolls, Bristol and other toys, saw-dust, fire-wood, and\r\npin-cushions.\r\n\r\nThere are many other manufactured articles sold in the streets, but\r\ntheir description will be more proper under the head of Street Artisans.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of manufactured articles present, as a body, so many\r\nand often such varying characteristics, that I cannot offer to give a\r\ndescription of them as a whole, as I have been able to do with other\r\nand less diversified classes.\r\n\r\nAmong them are several distinct and peculiar street-characters, such\r\nas the pack-men, who carry their cotton or linen goods in packs on\r\ntheir backs, and are all itinerants. Then there are duffers, who vend\r\npretended smuggled goods, handkerchiefs, silks, tobacco or cigars;\r\nalso, the sellers of sham sovereigns and sham gold rings for wagers.\r\nThe crockery-ware and glass-sellers (known in the street-trade as\r\n“crocks”), are peculiar from their principle of _bartering_. They\r\nwill sell to any one, but they _sell_ very rarely, and always clamour\r\nin preference for an exchange of their wares for wearing-apparel of\r\nany kind. They state, if questioned, that their reason for doing this\r\nis--at least I heard the statement from some of the most intelligent\r\namong them--that they do so because, if they “sold outright,” they\r\nrequired a hawker’s license, and could not sell or “swop” so cheap.\r\n\r\nSome of the street-sellers of manufactured articles are also patterers.\r\nAmong these are the “cheap Jacks,” or “cheap Johns;” the grease and\r\nstain removers; the corn-salve and plate-ball vendors; the sellers of\r\nsovereigns and rings for wagers; a portion of the lot-sellers; and the\r\nmen who vend poison for vermin and go about the streets with live rats\r\nclinging to, or running about, their persons.\r\n\r\nThis class of street-sellers also includes many of the very old and\r\nthe very young; the diseased, crippled, maimed, and blind. These poor\r\ncreatures sell, and sometimes obtain a charitable penny, by offering to\r\nsell such things as boxes of lucifer-matches; cakes of blacking; boot,\r\nstay, and other laces; pins, and sewing and knitting-needles; tapes;\r\ncotton-bobbins; garters; pincushions; combs; nutmeg-graters; metal\r\nskewers and meat-hooks; hooks and eyes; and shirt-buttons.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the class may be described as merely street-sellers;\r\ntoiling, struggling, plodding, itinerant tradesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MANUFACTURED ARTICLES IN METAL.\r\n\r\nThese street-sellers are less numerous than might be imagined,\r\nwhen--according to my present division--the class is confined to the\r\nsellers of articles which they do not manufacture. The metal wares\r\nthus sold I have already enumerated, and I have now to describe the\r\ncharacteristics of the sellers.\r\n\r\nThe result of my inquiries leads me to the conclusion, that the\r\nstreet-vendors of any article which is the product of the skill of the\r\nhandicraftsman, have been, almost always, in their first outset in a\r\nstreet life, connected in some capacity or other with the trade, the\r\nmanufactures of which they vend.\r\n\r\nOne elderly man, long familiar with this branch of the street-trade,\r\nexpressed to me his conviction that when a mechanic sought his\r\nlivelihood in the streets, he naturally “gave his mind to sell what\r\nhe understood. Now, in my own case,” continued my informant, “I was\r\nborn and bred a tinman, and when I was driven to a street-life, I\r\nnever thought of selling anything but tins. How could I, if I wished\r\nto do the thing square and proper?--it would be like trying to speak\r\nanother language. If I’d started on slippers--and I knew a poor man\r\nwho was set up in the streets by a charitable lady on a stock of\r\ngentlemen’s slippers--what could I have done? Why, no better than he\r\ntold me he did. He was a potter down at Deptford, and knew of nothing\r\nbut flower-pots, and honey-jars for grocers, and them red sorts of\r\npottery. Poor fellow, he might have died of hunger, only the cholera\r\ncame quickest. But when I’m questioned about my tins, I’m my own man;\r\nand it’s a great thing, I’m satisfied, in a street-trade, when there’s\r\nso many cheap shops, and the police and all again you, to understand\r\nthe goods you’re talking about.”\r\n\r\nThis statement, I may repeat, is undoubtedly correct, so far as\r\nthat a “beaten-out” mechanic, when driven to the streets, in the\r\nfirst instance offers to the public wares of which he understands\r\nthe value and quality. Afterwards, in the experience or vagaries of\r\na street-life, other commodities may be, or may appear to be, more\r\nremunerative, and for such the mechanic may relinquish his first\r\narticles of street-traffic. “Why, sir,” I was told, “there was one man\r\nwho left razors for cabbages; ’cause one day a costermonger wot lived\r\nin the same house with him and was taken ill, asked him to go out with\r\na barrow of summer cabbages--the costermonger’s boy went with him--and\r\nthey went off so well that Joe [the former razor-seller] managed to\r\nstart in the costering line, he was so encouraged.”\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in metal manufactured articles is principally\r\nitinerant. Perhaps during the week upwards of three-fourths of those\r\ncarrying it on are itinerant, while on a Saturday night, perhaps, all\r\nare stationary, and almost always in the street-markets. The itinerant\r\ntrade is carried on, and chiefly in the suburbs, by men, women, and\r\nchildren; but the children are always, or almost always, the offspring\r\nof the adult street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe metal sold in the street may be divided into street-hardware,\r\nstreet-tinware, and street-jewellery. I shall begin with the former.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of hardware are, I am assured, in number about 100,\r\nincluding single men and families; for women “take their share” in\r\nthe business, and children sell smaller things, such as snuffers or\r\nbread-baskets. The people pursuing the trade are of the class I have\r\nabove described, with the exception of some ten or twelve who formerly\r\nmade a living as servants to the gaming-booths at Epsom, Ascot, &c.,\r\n&c., and “managed to live out of the races, somehow, most of the year;”\r\nsince the gaming-booths have been disallowed, they have “taken to the\r\nstreet hardware.”\r\n\r\nAll these street-sellers obtain their supplies at “the swag-shops;”\r\nof which I shall speak hereafter. The main articles of their trade\r\nare tea-boards, waiters, snuffers, candlesticks, bread-baskets,\r\ncheese-trays, Britannia metal tea-pots and spoons, iron kettles, pans,\r\nand coffee-pots. The most saleable things, I am told by a man who has\r\nbeen fifteen years in this and similar street trades, are at present\r\n18-in. tea-boards, bought at “the swags” at from 10_s._ 6_d._ a doz.,\r\nto 4_s._ each; 24-in. boards, from 20_s._ the doz. to 5_s._ each;\r\nbread-baskets, 4_s._ 6_d._ the doz.; and Britannia metal tea-pots,\r\n10_s._ the doz. These tea-pots have generally what is called “loaded\r\nbottoms;” the lower part of the vessel is “filled with composition, so\r\nas to look as if there was great weight of metal, and as if the pot\r\nwould melt for almost the 18_d._ which is asked for it, and very often\r\ngot.”\r\n\r\nI learned from the same man, however, and from others in the trade,\r\nthat it is far more difficult now than it was a few years ago, to sell\r\n“rubbish.” There used to be also, but not within these six or eight\r\nyears, a tolerable profit realised by the street-sellers of hardware in\r\nthe way of “swop.” It was common to take an old metal article, as part\r\npayment for a new one; and if the old article were of good quality,\r\nit was polished and tinkered up for sale in the Saturday evening\r\nstreet-markets, and often “went off well.” This traffic, however, has\r\nalmost ceased to exist, as regards the street-sellers of hardware,\r\nand has been all but monopolised by the men who barter “crocks” for\r\nwearing-apparel, or any old metal. Some hardware-men who have become\r\nwell known on their “rounds”--for the principal trade is in the\r\nsuburbs--sell very good wares, and at moderate profits.\r\n\r\n“It’s a poor trade, sir, is the hardware,” said one man carrying it\r\non, “and street trades are mostly poor trades, for I’ve tried many a\r\none of them. I was brought up a clown, I may say; my father died when\r\nI was a child, and I might have been a clown still but for an accident\r\n(a rupture). That’s long ago,--I can’t say how long; but I know that\r\nbefore I was fifteen, I many a time wished I was dead, and I have many\r\na time since. Why the day before yesterday, from 9 in the morning to 11\r\nat night, I didn’t take a farthing. Some days I don’t earn 1_s._, and\r\nI have a mother depending upon me who can do little or nothing. I’m a\r\nteetotaller; if I wasn’t we shouldn’t have a meal a day. I never was\r\nfond of drink, and if I’m ever so weary and out of sorts, and worried\r\nfor a meal’s meat, I can’t say I ever long for a drop to cheer me up.\r\nSometimes I can’t get coffee, let alone anything else. O, I suffer\r\nterribly. Day after day I get wet through, and have nothing to take\r\nhome to my mother at last. Our principal food is bread and butter, and\r\ntea. Not fish half so often as many poor people. I suppose, because we\r\ndon’t care for it. I know that our living, the two of us, stands to\r\nless than 1_s._ a day,--not 6_d._ a piece. Then I have two rents to\r\npay. No, sir, not for two places; but I pay 2_s._ a week for a room,\r\na tidy bit of a chamber, furnished, and 1_s._ a week rent,--I call it\r\nrent, for a loan of 5_s._ I’ve paid 1_s._ a week for four weeks on it,\r\nand must keep paying until I can hand over the 5_s._, with 1_s._ for\r\nrent added to it, all in one sum. If I could tip up the 5_s._ the day\r\nafter I’d paid the last week’s 1_s._, I must pay another shilling. The\r\nman who lends does nothing else; he lives by lending, and by letting\r\nout a few barrows to costermongers, and other street-people. I wish I\r\ncould take a farewell sight of them.”\r\n\r\nThe principal traffic carried on by these street-sellers is in the\r\nsuburbs. Women constitute their sole customers, or nearly so. Their\r\nprofits fluctuate from 20 per cent. to 100 per cent. The bread-baskets,\r\nwhich they buy at 4_s._ 6_d._ the doz., they retail at 6_d._ each;\r\nfor it is very difficult, I have frequently been told, to get a\r\nprice between 6_d._ and 1_s._ This, however, relates only to those\r\nthings which are not articles of actual necessity. Half of these\r\nstreet-sellers, I am assured, take on an average from 20_s._ to 25_s._\r\nweekly the year through; a quarter take 15_s._, and the remaining\r\nquarter from 7_s._ 6_d._ to 10_s._ Calculating an average taking of\r\n15_s._ each per week, throughout the entire class, men, women, and\r\nchildren, we find 3,900_l._ expended in street-sold hardwares. Ten\r\nyears ago, I am told, the takings were not less than 2,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from accounts kept, not long ago, by a\r\nstreet-seller of hardware. His principal sale was snuffers, knives and\r\nforks, iron candlesticks, padlocks, and bed-screws. His stock cost him\r\n35_s._ on the Monday morning, and his first week was his _best_, which\r\nI here subjoin:\r\n\r\n                                  Receipts.

The\r\nstreet-seller after this (about half a year ago) sold his stock to a\r\nsmall shopkeeper, and went into another business.\r\n\r\n                                         Receipts.

The principal portion of those I have met are\r\nIrishmen, who, notwithstanding, generally “hail” from Sheffield, and\r\nall their sales are effected in an attempt at the Yorkshire dialect,\r\ninterspersed, however, with an unmistakeable brogue. The brogue is the\r\nmore apparent when cheap John gets a little out of temper--if his sales\r\nare flat, for instance, he’ll say, “By J--s, I don’t belaive you’ve any\r\nmoney with you, or that you’ve lift any at home, at all, at all. Bad\r\ncess to you!”\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many English cheap Johns, but few of them are\r\nnatives of Sheffield or Birmingham, from which towns they invariably\r\n“hail.” Their system of selling is to attract a crowd of persons by an\r\nharangue after the following fashion: “Here I am, the original cheap\r\nJohn from Sheffield. I’ve not come here to get money; not I; I’ve\r\ncome here merely for the good of the public, and to let you see how\r\nyou’ve been imposed upon by a parcel of pompous shopkeepers, who are\r\nnot content with less than 100 per cent. for rubbish. They got up a\r\npetition--which I haven’t time to read to you just now--offering me\r\na large sum of money to keep away from here. But no, I had too much\r\nfriendship for you to consent, and here I am, cheap John, born without\r\na shirt, one day while my mother was out, in a haystack; consequently\r\nI’ve no parish, for the cows eat up mine, and therefore I’ve never no\r\nfear of going to the workhouse. I’ve more money than the parson of\r\nthe parish--I’ve in this cart a cargo of useful and cheap goods; can\r\nsupply you with anything, from a needle to an anchor. Nobody _can_\r\nsell as cheap as me, seeing that I gets all my goods upon credit, and\r\nnever means to pay for them. Now then, what shall we begin with? Here’s\r\na beautiful guard-chain; if it isn’t silver, it’s the same colour--I\r\ndon’t say it isn’t silver, nor I don’t say it is--in that affair use\r\nyour own judgment. Now, in the reg’lar way of trade, you shall go\r\ninto any shop in town, and they will ask you 1_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._ for\r\nan article not half so good, so what will you say for this splendid\r\nchain? Eighteen and sixpence without the pound? What, that’s too\r\nmuch! Well, then say 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 shillings; what,\r\nnone of you give ten shillings for this beautiful article? See how it\r\nimproves a man’s appearance” (hanging the chain round his neck). “Any\r\nyoung man here present wearing this chain will always be shown into\r\nthe parlour instead of the tap-room; into the best pew in church, when\r\nhe and--but the advantages the purchaser of this chain will possess\r\nI haven’t time to tell. What! no buyers? Why, what’s the matter with\r\nye? Have you no money, or no brains? But I’ll ruin myself for your\r\nsakes. Say 9_s._ for this splendid piece of jewellery--8, 7, 6, 5, 4,\r\n3, 2, 1--a shilling, will anybody give a shilling? Well, here 11_d._,\r\n10_d._, 9_d._, 8_d._, 7_d._, 6-1/2_d._, 6_d._! Is there ever a buyer\r\nat sixpence? Now I’ll ask no more and I’ll take no less; sell it or\r\nnever sell it.” The concluding words are spoken with peculiar emphasis,\r\nand after saying them the cheap John never takes any lower sum. A\r\ncustomer perhaps is soon obtained for the guard-chain, and then the\r\nvendor elevates his voice; “Sold to a very respectable gentleman, with\r\nhis mouth between his nose and chin, a most remarkable circumstance. I\r\nbelieve I’ve just one more--this is better than the last; I must have\r\na shilling for this. Sixpence? To you, sir. Sold again, to a gentleman\r\nworth 30,000_l._ a year; only the right owner keeps him out of it. I\r\nbelieve I’ve just one more; yes, here it is; it’s brighterer, longerer,\r\nstrongerer, and betterer than the last. I must have at least tenpence\r\nfor this. Well then, 9, 8, 7, 6; take this one for a sixpence. Sold\r\nagain, to a gentleman, his father’s pet and his mother’s joy. Pray,\r\nsir, does your mother know you’re out? Well, I don’t think I’ve any\r\nmore, but I’ll look; yes, here is _one_ more. Now this is better than\r\nall the rest. Sold again, to a most respectable gentleman, whose mother\r\nkeeps a chandler’s shop, and whose father turns the mangle.” In this\r\nmanner the cheap John continues to sell his guard-chain, until he has\r\ndrained his last customer for that particular commodity. He has always\r\nhis remark to make relative to the purchaser. The cheap John always\r\ntakes care to receive payment before he hazards his jokes, which I\r\nneed scarcely remark are ready made, and most of them ancient and worn\r\nthreadbare, the joint property of the whole fraternity of cheap Johns.\r\nAfter supplying his audience with one particular article, he introduces\r\nanother: “Here is a carving-knife and fork, none of your wasters,\r\ncapital buck-horn handle, manufactured of the best steel, in a regular\r\nworkmanlike manner; fit for carving in the best style, from a sparrow\r\nto a bullock. I don’t ask 7_s._ 6_d._ for this--although go over to\r\nMr. ----, the ironmonger, and he will have the impudence to ask you\r\n15_s._ for a worse article.” (The cheap Johns always make comparisons\r\nas to their own prices and the shopkeepers, and sometimes mention their\r\nnames.) “I say 5_s._ for the carving-knife and fork. Why, it’s an\r\narticle that’ll almost fill your children’s bellies by looking at it,\r\nand will always make 1 lb. of beef go as far as 6 lb. carved by any\r\nother knife and fork. Well, 4_s._, 3_s._, 2_s._, 1_s._ 11_d._, 1_s._\r\n10_d._, 1_s._ 9_d._, 1_s._ 8_d._, 1_s._ 7_d._, 18_d._ I ask no more,\r\nnor I’ll take no less.” The salesman throughout his variety of articles\r\nindulges in the same jokes, and holds out the same inducements. I give\r\na few.\r\n\r\n“_This_ is the original teapot” (producing one), “formerly invented\r\nby the Chinese; the first that ever was imported by those celebrated\r\npeople--only two of them came over in three ships. If I do not sell\r\nthis to-day, I intend presenting it to the British Museum or the Great\r\nExhibition. It is mostly used for making tea,--sometimes by ladies,\r\nfor keeping a little drop on the sly; it is an article constructed\r\nupon scientific principles, considered to require a lesser quantity of\r\ntea to manufacture the largest quantity of tea-water, than any other\r\nteapot now in use--largely patronised by the tea-totallers. Now, here’s\r\na fine pair of bellows! Any of you want to raise the wind? This is a\r\ncapital opportunity, if you’ll try. I’ll tell you how; buy these of\r\nme for 3_s._ 6_d._, and go and pawn them for 7_s._ Will you buy ’em,\r\nsir? No! well, then, you be blowed! Let’s see--I said 3_s._ 6_d._; it’s\r\ntoo little, but as I have said it, they must go; well--3_s._,” &c. &c.\r\n“Capital article to chastise the children or a drunken husband. Well,\r\ntake ’em for 1_s._--I ask no more, and I’ll take no less.”\r\n\r\nThese men have several articles which they sell singly, such as\r\ntea-trays, copper kettles, fire-irons, guns, whips, to all of which\r\nthey have some preamble; but their most attractive lot is a heap of\r\nmiscellaneous articles:--“I have here a pair of scissors; I only\r\nwant half-a-crown for them. What! you won’t give 1_s._? well, I’ll\r\nadd something else. Here’s a most useful article--a knife with eight\r\nblades, and there’s not a blade among you all that’s more highly\r\npolished. This knife’s a case of instruments in addition to the blades;\r\nhere’s a corkscrew, a button-hook, a file, and a picker. For this\r\ncapital knife and first-rate pair of scissors I ask 1_s._ Well, well,\r\nyou’ve no more conscience than a lawyer; here’s something else--a\r\npocket-book. This book no gentleman should be without; it contains\r\na diary for every day in the week, an almanack, a ready-reckoner, a\r\ntablet for your own memorandums, pockets to keep your papers, and a\r\nsplendid pencil with a silver top. No buyers! I’m astonished; but I’ll\r\nadd another article. Here’s a pocket-comb. No young man with any sense\r\nof decency should be without a pocket-comb. What looks worse than to\r\nsee a man’s head in an uproar? Some of you look as if your hair hadn’t\r\nseen a comb for years. Surely I shall get a customer now. What! no\r\nbuyers--well I never! Here, I’ll add half-a-dozen of the very best\r\nBritannia metal tea-spoons, and if you don’t buy, you must be spoons\r\nyourselves. Why, you perfectly astonish me! I really believe if I was\r\nto offer all in the shop, myself included, I should not draw 1_s._ out\r\nof you. Well, I’ll try again. Here, I’ll add a dozen of black-lead\r\npencils. Now, then, look at these articles”--(he spreads them out,\r\nholding them between his fingers to the best advantage)--“here’s a\r\npair of first-rate scissors, that will almost cut of themselves,--this\r\nvaluable knife, which comprises within itself almost a chest of\r\ntools,--a splendid pocket-book, which must add to the respectability\r\nand consequence of any man who wears it,--a pocket-comb which possesses\r\nthe peculiar property of making the hair curl, and dyeing it any colour\r\nyou wish,--a half-dozen spoons, nothing inferior to silver, and that do\r\nnot require half the usual quantity of sugar to sweeten your tea,--and\r\na dozen beautiful pencils, at least worth the money I ask for the whole\r\nlot. Now, a reasonable price for these articles would be at least\r\n10_s._ 6_d._; I’ll sell them for 1_s._ I ask no more, I’ll take no\r\nless. Sold again!”\r\n\r\nThe opposition these men display to each other, while pursuing their\r\nbusiness, is mostly assumed, for the purpose of attracting a crowd.\r\nSometimes, when in earnest, their language is disgusting; and I have\r\nseen them, (says an informant), after selling, try and settle their\r\ndifferences with a game at fisticuffs: but this occurred but seldom.\r\nOne of these men had a wife who used to sell for him,--she was\r\nconsidered to be the best “chaffer” on the road; not one of them could\r\nstand against her tongue: but her language abounded with obscenity. All\r\nthe “cheap Johns” were afraid of her.\r\n\r\nThey never under-sell each other (unless they get in a real passion);\r\nthis but seldom happens, but when it does they are exceedingly bitter\r\nagainst each other. I cannot state the language they use, further than\r\nthat it reaches the very summit of blackguardism. They have, however,\r\nassumed quarrels, for the purpose of holding a crowd together, and\r\nchaff goes round, intended to amuse their expected customers.\r\n\r\n“He’s coming your way to-morrow,” they’ll say one of the other, “mind\r\nand don’t hang your husbands’ shirts to dry, ladies, he’s very lucky at\r\nfinding things before they’re lost; he sells very cheap, no doubt--but\r\nmind, if you handle any of his wares, he don’t make you a present of a\r\nScotch fiddle for nothing. His hair looks as if it had been cut with a\r\nknife and fork.”\r\n\r\nThe Irishmen, in these displays, generally have the best of it; indeed,\r\nmost of their jokes have originated with the Irishmen, who complain of\r\nthe piracies of other “cheap Johns,” for as soon as the joke is uttered\r\nit is the property of the commonwealth, and not unfrequently used\r\nagainst the inventor half an hour after its first appearance.\r\n\r\nA few of them are not over particular as to the respectability of\r\ntheir transactions. I recollect one purchasing a brick at Sheffield;\r\nthe brick was packed up in paper, with a knife tied on the outside,\r\nit appeared like a package of knives, containing several dozens. The\r\n“cheap John” made out that he bought them as stolen property; the\r\nbiter was deservedly bitten. A few of the fraternity are well-known\r\n“Fences,” and some of them pursue the double calling of “cheap John”\r\nand gambler--keeping gambling tables at races. However the majority are\r\nhard-working men, who unite untiring industry with the most indomitable\r\nperseverance, for the laudable purpose of bettering their condition.\r\n\r\nI believe the most successful in the line have worked their way up from\r\nnothing, gaining experience as they proceeded. I have known two or\r\nthree start the trade with plenty of stock, but, wanting the tact, they\r\nhave soon been knocked off the road. There is a great deal of judgment\r\nrequired in knowing the best fairs, and even when there, as to getting\r\na good stand; and these matters are to be acquired only by practice.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces, and in Scotland, there may be 100 “cheap Johns,”\r\nor, as they term themselves, “Han-sellers.” They are generally a most\r\npersevering body of men, and have frequently risen from small hawkers\r\nof belts, braces, &c. Their receipts are from 5_l._ to 30_l._ per day,\r\ntheir profits from 20 to 25 per cent.; 20_l._ is considered a good\r\nday’s work; and they can take about three fairs a week during the\r\nsummer months. “I have known many of these men,” a man well acquainted\r\nwith them informs me, “who would walk 20 miles to a fair during the\r\nnight, hawk the public-houses the whole of the day, and start again\r\nall night for a fair to be held 20 miles off upon the following day. I\r\nknew two Irish lads, named ----, and I watched their progress with some\r\ninterest. Each had a stock of goods worth a few shillings; and now each\r\nhas a wholesale warehouse,--one at Sheffield, in the cutlery line, and\r\nthe other at Birmingham, in general wares.”\r\n\r\nThe goods the han-seller disposes of are mostly purchased at Sheffield\r\nand Birmingham. They purchase the cheapest goods they can obtain.\r\nMany of the han-sellers have settled in various parts of England as\r\n“swag-shop keepers.” There are two or three in London, I am told, who\r\nhave done so; one in the Kent-road, a large concern,--the others I am\r\nnot aware of their locality. Their mode of living while travelling is\r\nrather peculiar. Those who have their caravans, sleep in them, some\r\nwith their wives and families; they have a man, or more generally a\r\nboy, to look after the horse, and other drudgery, and sometimes at a\r\nfair, to hawk, or act as a _button_ (a _decoy_), to purchase the first\r\nlot of goods put up. This boy is accommodated with a bed made between\r\nthe wheels of the cart or wagon, with some old canvas hung round to\r\nkeep the weather out--not the most comfortable quarters, perhaps,--but,\r\nas they say, “it’s nothing when you’re used to it.” The packing up\r\noccurs when there’s no more chance of effecting sales; the horse is put\r\nto, and the caravan proceeds on the road towards the next town intended\r\nto visit. After a sufficient days’ travel, the “cheap John” looks\r\nout for a spot to encamp for the night. A clear stream of water, and\r\nprovender for the horse, are indispensable; or perhaps the han-seller\r\nhas visited that part before, and is aware of the halting-place.\r\nAfter having released the horse, and secured his fore-feet, so that\r\nhe cannot stray, the next process is to look for some _crack_ (some\r\ndry wood to light a fire); this is the boy’s work. He is told not to\r\ndespoil hedges, or damage fences: “cheap John” doesn’t wish to offend\r\nthe farmers; and during his temporary sojourn in the green lanes, he\r\nfrequently has some friendly chat with the yeomen and their servants,\r\nsometimes disposes of goods, and often barters for a piece of fat bacon\r\nor potatoes. A fire is lighted between the shafts of the cart,--a stick\r\nplaced across, upon which is suspended the cookery utensil. When the\r\nmeal is concluded, the parties retire to bed,--the master within the\r\ncaravan, and the boy to his chamber between the wheels. Sometimes they\r\nbreakfast before they proceed on their journey; at other times they\r\ntravel a few miles first.\r\n\r\nThose who have children bring them up in such a manner as may be\r\nimagined considering their itinerant life: but there are very few\r\nwho have families travelling with them; though in most cases a wife;\r\ngenerally the children of the “cheap John” are stationary, either out\r\nat nurse or with relatives.\r\n\r\nSome of the “cheap Johns” have wagons upon four wheels, others have\r\ncarts; but both are fitted up with a wooden roof. The proprietor\r\ninvariably sleeps within his portable house, both for the protection\r\nof his property and also upon the score of economy. The vans with four\r\nwheels answer all the purposes of a habitation. The furniture consists\r\nof a bed placed upon boxes, containing the stock in trade. The bed\r\nextends the whole width of the vehicle, about 6 ft. 6 in., and many\r\ngenerally extend about 5 ft. into the body of the van, and occupies the\r\nfarthest end of the machine from the door,--which door opens out upon\r\nthe horse. The four-wheeled vans are 12 ft. long, and the two-wheeled\r\ncarts 9 ft. During business hours the whole of the articles most likely\r\nto be wanted are spread out upon the bed, and the assistant (either the\r\nwife or a boy) hands them out as the salesman may require them. The\r\nfurniture, in addition to the bed, is very scarce; indeed they are very\r\nmuch averse to carry more than is really necessary. The pail, the horse\r\ntakes his corn and beans from (I don’t know why, but they never use\r\nnose-bags,) serves the purpose of a wash-hand basin or a washing-tub.\r\nIt is generally painted the same colour as the van, with the initials\r\nof the proprietor painted upon it, and, when travelling, hangs upon a\r\nhook under the machine. They mostly begin with a two-wheeled machine,\r\nand if successful a four-wheeler follows. The tables and chairs are\r\nthe boxes in which the goods are packed. A tea-kettle and saucepan,\r\nand as few delf articles as possible, and corner-cupboard, and these\r\ncomprise the whole of the furniture of the van. In the four-wheeled\r\nwagons there is always a fire-place similar to those the captains of\r\nships have in their cabins, but in the two-wheeled carts fire-places\r\nare dispensed with. These are mostly brass ones, and are kept very\r\nbright; for the “cheap Johns” are proud of their van and its contents.\r\nThey are always gaudily painted, sometimes expensively; indeed they are\r\nmost expensive articles, and cost from 80_l._ to 120_l._ The principal\r\nperson for making these machines is a Mr. Davidson of Leeds. The\r\nshowman’s caravans are still more expensive; the last purchased by the\r\nlate Mr. Wombwell cost more than 300_l._, and is really a curiosity.\r\nHe termed it, as all showmen do--the living wagon; viz. to live in--it\r\nhas parlour and kitchen, and is fitted up most handsomely; its exterior\r\npresents the appearance of a first-class railway-carriage. The front\r\nexterior of the van during the trading operations of the “cheap Johns,”\r\nis hung round with guns, saws, tea-trays, bridles, whips, centre-bits,\r\nand other articles, displayed to the best advantage. The name of the\r\nproprietor is always prominently displayed along the whole side of\r\nthe vehicle, added to which is a signification that he is a wholesale\r\nhardwareman, from Sheffield, Yorkshire, or Birmingham, Warwickshire,\r\nand sometimes an extra announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_The original cheap John._”\r\n\r\nI do not know any class of men who are more fond of the good things\r\nof this life than “cheap John;” his dinner, during a fair, is\r\ngenerally eaten upon the platform outside his van, where he disposes\r\nof his wares, and invariably consists of a joint of baked meat and\r\npotatoes--that is where they can get a dinner baked. As little time\r\nas possible is occupied in eating, especially if trade is good. At\r\na hill fair (that is where the fair is held upon a hill away from\r\na town), a fire is made behind the cart, the pot is suspended upon\r\nthree sticks, and dinner prepared in the usual camp fashion. The wife\r\nor boy superintends this. Tea and coffee also generally find their\r\nway to their table; and if there’s no cold meat a plentiful supply\r\nof bacon, beef-steaks, eggs, or something in the shape of a relish,\r\nseem to be with “cheap John” indispensable. His man or boy (if John is\r\nunmarried) appears to be upon an equality with the master in the eating\r\ndepartment; he is not allowanced, neither has he to wait until his\r\nsuperior has finished. Get it over as quick as you can seems to be the\r\nchief object. Perhaps from the circumstance of their selling guns, and\r\nconsequently always having such implements in their possession, these\r\nmen, when they have time on their hands, are fond of the sports of the\r\nfield, and many a hare finds its way into the camp-kettle of “cheap\r\nJohn.” I need not say that they practise this sport with but little\r\nrespectful feeling towards the Game-laws; but they are careful when\r\nindulging in such amusement, and I never heard of one getting into a\r\nhobble.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter (since the “cheap John” has been obliged to become\r\na licensed auctioneer), some of them take shops and sell their goods\r\nby auction, or get up mock-auctions. I have been told by them that\r\nsometimes its a better game than “han-selling.”\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the “cheap John’s” season is at Lynn in Norfolk;\r\nthere is a mart there commencing 14th February, it continues fourteen\r\ndays. After this, there is Wisbeach, Spalding, Grantham, and other\r\nmarts in Norfolk and Lincolnshire; which bring them up to Easter.\r\nAt Easter there are many fairs--Manchester, Knott Mill, Blackburn,\r\nDarlington, Newcastle, &c., &c. The “cheap Johns” then disperse\r\nthemselves through different parts of the country. Hill-fairs are\r\nconsidered the best; that is cattle-fairs, where there are plenty of\r\nfarmers and country people. Hirings for servants are next to them. It\r\nmay appear curious, but Sheffield and Birmingham fairs are two of the\r\nbest for the “cheap John’s” business in England. There are two fairs\r\nat each place during the year. Sheffield, at Whitsuntide and November;\r\nBirmingham, Whitsuntide and September. Nottingham, Derby, Leeds,\r\nNewcastle, Bristol, Glasgow--in fact, where the greatest population is,\r\nthe chances for business are considered the best, and if I may judge\r\nfrom the number of traders in this line, who attend the largest towns,\r\nI should say they succeed better than in smaller towns.\r\n\r\nIf we calculate that there are 100 “cheap Johns” in London and in the\r\ncountry, and they are more or less itinerant, and that they each take\r\n4_l._ per day for nine months in the year, or 24_l._ per week; this\r\namounts to 2,400_l._ per week, or about 90,000_l._ in nine months.\r\nSupposing their profits to be 20 per cent., it would leave 18,000_l._\r\nclear income. Say that during the winter there are seventy-five\r\nfollowing the business, and that their receipts amount to 15_l._ each\r\nper week, this amounts to 13,500_l._ additional; and, at the rate of 20\r\nper cent. profit, comes to 2,700_l._,--making throughout the year the\r\nprofits of the 100 “cheap Johns” 20,700_l._, or 207_l._ a man.\r\n\r\nThe “cheap Johns” seldom frequent the crowded thoroughfares of\r\nLondon. Their usual pitches in the metropolis are, King’s-cross,\r\nSt. George’s-in-the-East, Stepney, round about the London Docks,\r\nPaddington, Kennington, and such like places.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIPPLED STREET-SELLER OF NUTMEG-GRATERS.\r\n\r\nI now give an example of one of the classes _driven_ to the streets\r\nby utter inability to labour. I have already spoken of the sterling\r\nindependence of some of these men possessing the strongest claims\r\nto our sympathy and charity, and yet preferring to _sell_ rather\r\nthan _beg_. As I said before, many ingrained beggars certainly use\r\nthe street _trade_ as a cloak for alms-seeking, but as certainly\r\nmany more, with every title to our assistance, use it as a means of\r\nredemption from beggary. That the nutmeg-grater seller is a noble\r\nexample of the latter class, I have not the least doubt. I have made\r\nall due inquiries to satisfy myself as to his worthiness, and I feel\r\nconvinced that when the reader looks at the portrait here given, and\r\nobserves how utterly helpless the poor fellow is, and then reads the\r\nfollowing plain unvarnished tale, he will marvel like me, not only at\r\nthe fortitude which could sustain him under all his heavy afflictions,\r\nbut at the resignation (not to say philosophy) with which he bears\r\nthem every one. His struggles to earn his own living (notwithstanding\r\nhis physical incapacity even to put the victuals to his mouth after\r\nhe has earned them), are instances of a nobility of pride that are\r\nI believe without a parallel. The poor creature’s legs and arms are\r\ncompletely withered; indeed he is scarcely more than head and trunk.\r\nHis thigh is hardly thicker than a child’s wrist. His hands are bent\r\ninward from contraction of the sinews, the fingers being curled up and\r\nalmost as thin as the claws of a bird’s foot. He is unable even to\r\nstand, and cannot move from place to place but on his knees, which are\r\nshod with leather caps, like the heels of a clog, strapped round the\r\njoint; the soles of his boots are on the _upper_ leathers, that being\r\nthe part always turned towards the ground while he is crawling along.\r\nHis countenance is rather handsome than otherwise; the intelligence\r\nindicated by his ample forehead is fully borne out by the testimony as\r\nto his sagacity in his business, and the mild expression of his eye by\r\nthe statements as to his feeling for all others in affliction.\r\n\r\n“I sell nutmeg-graters and funnels,” said the cripple to me; “I sell\r\nthem at 1_d._ and 1-1/2_d._ a piece. I get mine of the man in whose\r\nhouse I live. He is a tinman, and makes for the street-trade and shops\r\nand all. I pay 7_d._ a dozen for them, and I get 12_d._ or 18_d._ a\r\ndozen, if I can when I sell them, but I mostly get only a penny a\r\npiece--it’s quite a chance if I have a customer at 1-1/2_d._ Some days\r\nI sell only three--some days not one--though I’m out from ten o’clock\r\ntill six. The most I ever took was 3_s._ 6_d._ in a day. Some weeks I\r\nhardly clear my expenses--and they’re between 7_s._ and 8_s._ a week;\r\nfor not being able to dress and ondress myself, I’m obligated to pay\r\nsome one to do it for me--I think I don’t clear more than 7_s._ a\r\nweek take one week with another. When I don’t make that much, I go\r\nwithout--sometimes friends who are kind to me give me a trifle, or\r\nelse I should starve. As near as I can judge, I _take_ about 15_s._\r\na week, and out of that I clear about 6_s._ or 7_s._ I pay for my\r\nmeals as I have them--3_d._ or 4_d._ a meal. I pay every night for my\r\nlodging as I go in, if I can; but if not my landlady lets it run a\r\nnight or two. I give her 1_s._ a week for my washing and looking after\r\nme, and 1_s._ 6_d._ for my lodging. When I do very well I have three\r\nmeals a day, but it’s oftener only two--breakfast and supper--unless\r\nof Sunday. On a wet day when I can’t get out, I often go without food.\r\nI may have a bit of bread and butter give me, but that’s all--then I\r\nlie a-bed. I feel miserable enough when I see the rain come down of a\r\nweek day, I can tell you. Ah, it _is_ very miserable indeed lying in\r\nbed all day, and in a lonely room, without perhaps a person to come\r\nnear one--helpless as I am--and hear the rain beat against the windows,\r\nand all that without nothing to put in your lips. I’ve done _that_\r\nover and over again where I lived before; but where I am now I’m more\r\ncomfortable like. My breakfast is mostly bread and butter and tea; and\r\nmy supper, bread and butter and tea with a bit of fish, or a small\r\nbit of meat. What my landlord and landlady has I share with them. I\r\nnever break my fast from the time I go out in the morning till I come\r\nhome--unless it is a halfpenny orange I buy in the street; I do that\r\nwhen I feel faint. I have only been selling in the streets since this\r\nlast winter. I was in the workhouse with a fever all the summer. I was\r\ndestitute afterwards, and obliged to begin selling in the streets.\r\nThe Guardians gave me 5_s._ to get stock. I had always dealt in tin\r\nware, so I knew where to go to buy my things. It’s very hard work\r\nindeed is street-selling for such as me. I can’t walk no distance. I\r\nsuffer a great deal of pains in my back and knees. Sometimes I go in a\r\nbarrow, when I’m travelling any great way. When I go only a short way\r\nI crawl along on my knees and toes. The most I’ve ever crawled is two\r\nmiles. When I get home afterwards, I’m in great pain. My knees swell\r\ndreadfully, and they’re all covered with blisters, and my toes ache\r\nawful. I’ve corns all on top of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-SELLER OF NUTMEG-GRATERS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n“Often after I’ve been walking, my limbs and back ache so badly that\r\nI can get no sleep. Across my lines it feels as if I’d got some great\r\nweight, and my knees are in a heat, and throb, and feel as if a knife\r\nwas running into them. When I go up-stairs I have to crawl upon the\r\nback of my hands and my knees. I can’t lift nothing to my mouth. The\r\nsinews of my hands is all contracted. I am obliged to have things held\r\nto my lip for me to drink, like a child. I _can_ use a knife and fork\r\nby leaning my arm on the table and then stooping my head to it. I can’t\r\nwash nor ondress myself. Sometimes I think of my helplessness a great\r\ndeal. The thoughts of it used to throw me into fits at one time--very\r\nbad. It’s the Almighty’s will that I am so, and I must abide by it.\r\nPeople says, as they passes me in the streets, ‘Poor fellow, it’s a\r\nshocking thing;’ but very seldom they does any more than pity me; some\r\nlays out a halfpenny or a penny with me, but the most of ’em goes on\r\nabout their business. Persons looks at me a good bit when I go into\r\na strange place. I _do_ feel it very much, that I haven’t the power\r\nto get my living or to do a thing for myself, but I never begged for\r\nnothing. I’d sooner starve than I’d do that. I never thought that\r\npeople whom God had given the power to help theirselves ought to help\r\nme. I _have_ thought that I’m as I am--obliged to go on my hands and\r\nknees, from no fault of my own. Often I’ve done that, and I’ve over and\r\nover again laid in bed and wondered why the Almighty should send\r\nme into the world in such a state; often I’ve done that on a wet day,\r\nwith nothing to eat, and no friend to come a-nigh me. When I’ve gone\r\nalong the streets, too, and been in pain, I’ve thought, as I’ve seen\r\nthe people pass straight up, with all the use of their limbs, and some\r\nof them the biggest blackguards, cussing and swearing, I’ve thought,\r\nWhy should I be deprived of the use of mine? and I’ve felt angry\r\nlike, and perhaps at that moment I couldn’t bring my mind to believe\r\nthe Almighty was so good and merciful as I’d heard say; but then in\r\na minute or two afterwards I’ve prayed to Him to make me better and\r\nhappier in the next world. I’ve always been led to think He’s afflicted\r\nme as He has for some wise purpose or another that I can’t see. I think\r\nas mine is so hard a life in this world, I shall be better off in the\r\nnext. Often when I couldn’t afford to pay a boy, I’ve not had my boots\r\noff for four or five nights and days, nor my clothes neither. Give\r\nme the world I couldn’t take them off myself, and then my feet has\r\nswollen to that degree that I’ve been nearly mad with pain, and I’ve\r\nbeen shivering and faint, but still I was obliged to go out with my\r\nthings; if I hadn’t I should have starved. Such as I am can’t afford to\r\nbe ill--it’s only rich folks as can lay up, not we; for us to take to\r\nour beds is to go without food altogether. When I was without never a\r\nboy, I used to tie the wet towel round the back of one of the chairs,\r\nand wash myself by rubbing my face up against it. I’ve been two days\r\nwithout a bit of anything passing between my lips. I couldn’t go and\r\nbeg for victuals--I’d rather go without. Then I used to feel faint, and\r\nmy head used to ache dreadful. I used then to drink a plenty of water.\r\nThe women sex is mostly more kinder to me than the men. Some of the\r\nmen fancies, as I goes along, that I can walk. They often says to me,\r\n‘Why, the sole of your boot is as muddy as mine;’ and one on ’em is,\r\nbecause I always rests myself on that foot--the other sole, you see, is\r\nas clean as when it was first made. The women never seem frightened on\r\nme. My trade is to sell brooms and brushes, and all kinds of cutlery\r\nand tin-ware. I learnt it myself. I never was brought up to nothing,\r\nbecause I couldn’t use my hands. Mother was a cook in a nobleman’s\r\nfamily when I were born. They say as I was a love-child. I was not\r\nbrought up by mother, but by one of her fellow-servants. Mother’s\r\nintellects was so weak, that she couldn’t have me with her. She used\r\nto fret a great deal about me, so her fellow-servant took me when she\r\ngot married. After I were born, mother married a farmer in middling\r\ncircumstances. They tell me as my mother was frightened afore I was\r\nborn. I never knew my father. He went over to Buonos Ayres, and kept\r\nan hotel there--I’ve heard mother say as much. No mother couldn’t love\r\na child more than mine did me, but her feelings was such she couldn’t\r\nbear to see me. I never went to mother’s to live, but was brought up\r\nby the fellow-servant as I’ve told you of. Mother allowed her 30_l._\r\na-year. I was with her till two years back. She was always very kind\r\nto me--treated me like one of her own. Mother used to come and see me\r\nabout once a-year--sometimes not so often: she was very kind to me\r\nthen. Oh, yes; I used to like to see her very much. Whatever I wished\r\nfor she’d let me have; if I wrote to her, she always sent me what I\r\nwanted. I was very comfortably then. Mother died four years ago; and\r\nwhen I lost her I fell into a fit--I was told of it all of a sudden.\r\nShe and the party as I was brought up with was the only friends as I\r\nhad in the world--the only persons as cared anything about a creature\r\nlike me. I was in a fit for hours, and when I came to, I thought what\r\nwould become of me: I knew I could do nothing for myself, and the\r\nonly friend as I had as could keep me was gone. The person as brought\r\nme up was very good, and said, while she’d got a home I should never\r\nwant; but, two years after mother’s death, she was seized with the\r\ncholera, and then I hadn’t a friend left in the world. When she died\r\nI felt ready to kill myself; I was all alone then, and what could I\r\ndo--cripple as I was? She thought her sons and daughters as I’d been\r\nbrought up with--like brothers and sisters--would look after me; but it\r\nwas not in their power--they was only hard-working people. My mother\r\nused to allow so much a year for my schooling, and I can read and write\r\npretty well.” (He wrote his name in my presence kneeling at the table;\r\nholding the pen almost as one might fancy a bird would, and placing\r\nthe paper sideways instead of straight before him.) “While mother was\r\nalive, I was always foraging about to learn something unbeknown to\r\nher. I wanted to do so, in case mother should leave me without the\r\nmeans of getting a living. I used to buy old bedsteads, and take them\r\nto a man, and get him to repair them, and then I’d put the sacking on\r\nmyself; I can hold a hammer somehow in my right hand. I used to polish\r\nthem on my knees. I made a bench to my height out of two old chairs.\r\nI used to know what I should get for the bedsteads, and so could tell\r\nwhat I could afford to give the man to do up the parts as I couldn’t\r\nmanage. It was so I got to learn something like a business for myself.\r\nWhen the person died as had brought me up, I _could_ do a little; I\r\nhad then got the means. Before her death I had opened a kind of shop\r\nfor things in the general line; I sold tin-ware, and brass-work, and\r\ncandlesticks, and fire-irons, and all old furniture, and gown-prints as\r\nwell. I went into the tally business, and that ruined me altogether. I\r\ncouldn’t get my money in; there’s a good deal owing to me now. Me and a\r\nboy used to manage the whole. I used to make all my account-books and\r\neverything. My lodgers didn’t pay me my rent, so I had to move from\r\nthe house, and live on what stock I had. In my new lodging I went on\r\nas well as I could for a little while; but about eighteen months ago\r\nI could hold on no longer. Then I borrowed a little, and went hawking\r\ntin-ware and brushes in the country. I sold baking-dishes, Dutch ovens,\r\nroasting-jacks, skewers and gridirons, teapots and saucepans, and\r\ncombs. I used to exchange sometimes for old clothes. I had a barrow and\r\na boy with me; I used to keep him, and give him 1_s._ a week. I managed\r\nto get just a living that way. When the winter came on I gave it up;\r\nit was too cold. After that I was took bad with a fever; my stock had\r\nbeen all gone a little while before, and the boy had left because I\r\ncouldn’t keep him, and I had to do all for myself. All my friends was\r\ndead, and I had no one to help me, so I was obligated to lay about all\r\nnight in my things, for I couldn’t get them off alone; and that and\r\nwant of food brought on a fever. Then I was took into the workhouse,\r\nand there I stopped all the summer, as I told you. I can’t say they\r\ntreated me bad, but they certainly didn’t use me well. If I could have\r\nworked after I got better, I could have had tea; but ’cause I couldn’t\r\ndo nothing, they gave me that beastly gruel morning and night. I had\r\nmeat three times a week. They would have kept me there till now, but I\r\nwould die in the streets rather than be a pauper. So I told them, if\r\nthey would give me the means of getting a stock, I would try and get\r\na living for myself. After refusing many times to let me have 10_s._,\r\nthey agreed to give me 5_s._ Then I came out, but I had no home, and so\r\nI crawled about till I met with the people where I am now, and they let\r\nme sit up there till I got a room of my own. Then some of my friends\r\ncollected for me about 15_s._ altogether, and I did pretty well for a\r\nlittle while. I went to live close by the Blackfriars-road, but the\r\npeople where I lodged treated me very bad. There was a number of girls\r\nof the town in the same street, but they was too fond of their selves\r\nand their drink to give nothing. They used to buy things of me and\r\nnever pay me. They never made game of me, nor played me any tricks,\r\nand if they saw the boys doing it they would protect me. They never\r\noffered to give me no victuals; indeed, I shouldn’t have liked to have\r\neaten the food they got. After that I couldn’t pay my lodgings, and\r\nthe parties where I lodged turned me out, and I had to crawl about the\r\nstreets for four days and nights. This was only a month back. I was fit\r\nto die with pain all that time. If I could get a penny I used to go\r\ninto a coffee-shop for half-a-pint of coffee, and sit there till they\r\ndrove me out, and then I’d crawl about till it was time for me to go\r\nout selling. Oh! dreadful, dreadful, it was to be all them hours--day\r\nand night--on my knees. I couldn’t get along at all, I was forced to\r\nsit down every minute, and then I used to fall asleep with my things\r\nin my hand, and be woke up by the police to be pushed about and druv\r\non by them. It seemed like as if I was walking on the bare bones of my\r\nknees. The pain in them was like the cramp, only much worse. At last I\r\ncould bear it no longer, so I went afore Mr. Secker, the magistrate, at\r\nUnion Hall, and told him I was destitute, and that the parties where I\r\nhad been living kept my bed and the few things I had, for 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nrent, that I owed them. He said he couldn’t believe that anybody would\r\nforce me to crawl about the streets, for four days and nights, cripple\r\nas I was, for such a sum. One of the officers told him I was a honest\r\nand striving man, and the magistrate sent the officer, with the money,\r\nto get my things, but the landlady wouldn’t give them till the officer\r\ncompelled her, and then she chucked my bed out into the middle of the\r\nstreet. A neighbour took it in for me and took care of it till I found\r\nout the tinman who had before let me sit up in his house. I should\r\nhave gone to him at first, but he lived farther than I could walk. I\r\nam stopping with him now, and he is very kind to me. I have still some\r\nrelations living, and they are well to do, but, being a cripple, they\r\ndespise me. My aunt, my mother’s sister, is married to a builder, in\r\nPetersham, near Richmond, and they are rich people--having some houses\r\nof their own besides a good business. I have got a boy to wheel me down\r\non a barrow to them, and asked assistance of them, but they will have\r\nnothing to do with me. They won’t look at me for my affliction. Six\r\nmonths ago they gave me half-a-crown. I had no lodgings nor victuals\r\nthen; and _that_ I shouldn’t have had from them had I not said I was\r\nstarving and must go to the parish. This winter I went to them, and\r\nthey shut the door in my face. After leaving my aunt’s, I went down\r\nto Ham Common, where my father-in-law lives, and there his daughter’s\r\nhusband sent for a policeman to drive me away from the place. I told\r\nthe husband I had no money nor food; but he advised me to go begging,\r\nand said I shouldn’t have a penny of them. My father-in-law was ill\r\nup-stairs at the time, but I don’t think he would have treated me a\r\nbit better--and all this they do because the Almighty has made me\r\na cripple. I can, indeed, solemnly say, that there is nothing else\r\nagainst me, and that I strive hard and crawl about till my limbs ache\r\nenough to drive me mad, to get an honest livelihood. With a couple of\r\npounds I could, I think, manage to shift very well for myself. I’d get\r\na stock, and go into the country with a barrow, and buy old metal, and\r\nexchange tin ware for old clothes, and, with that, I’m almost sure I\r\ncould get a decent living. I’m accounted a very good dealer.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to my inquiries concerning the character of this man, I\r\nreceived the following written communication:\r\n\r\n “I have known C---- A---- twelve years; the last six years he has\r\n dealt with me for tinware. I have found him honest in all his dealings\r\n with me, sober and industrious.\r\n\r\n  “C---- H----, Tinman.”\r\n\r\nFrom the writer of the above testimonial I received the following\r\naccount of the poor cripple:--\r\n\r\n“He is a man of generous a disposition, and very sensitive for the\r\nafflictions of others. One day while passing down the Borough he saw\r\na man afflicted with St. Vitus’s dance shaking from head to foot, and\r\nleaning on the arm of a woman who appeared to be his wife.” The cripple\r\ntold my informant that he should never forget what he felt when he\r\nbeheld that poor man. “I thought,” he said, “what a blessing it is I\r\nam not like him.” Nor is the cripple, I am told, less independent than\r\nhe is generous. In all his sufferings and privations he never pleads\r\npoverty to others; but bears up under the trials of life with the\r\ngreatest patience and fortitude. When in better circumstances he was\r\nmore independent than at present, having since, through illness and\r\npoverty, been much humbled.\r\n\r\n“His privations have been great,” adds my informant. “Only two months\r\nback, being in a state of utter destitution and quite worn out with\r\nfatigue, he called at the house of a person (where my informant\r\noccupied a room) about ten o’clock at night, and begged them to let\r\nhim rest himself for a short while, but the inhuman landlady and her\r\nson laid hold of the wretched man, the one taking him by the arms and\r\nthe other by the legs, and literally hurled him into the street. The\r\nnext morning,” my informant continued, “I saw the poor creature leaning\r\nagainst a lamp-post, shivering with the cold, and my heart bled for\r\nhim; and since that he has been living with me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SWAG-SHOPS OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nBy those who are not connected with the street trade, the proprietors\r\nof the swag-shops are often called “warehousemen” or “general dealers,”\r\nand even “slaughterers.” These descriptions apply but partially.\r\n“Warehousemen” or “general dealers” are vague terms, which I need not\r\nfurther notice. The wretchedly under-paid and over-worked shoe-makers,\r\ncabinet-makers and others call these places “slaughter-houses,” when\r\nthe establishment is in the hands of tradesmen who buy their goods\r\nof poor workmen without having given orders for them. On Saturday\r\nafternoons pale-looking men may be seen carrying a few chairs, or\r\nbending under the weight of a cheffonier or a chest of drawers, in\r\nTottenham-court Road, and thoroughfares of a similar character in\r\nall parts. These are “small masters,” who make or (as one man said\r\nto me, “No, sir, I don’t make these drawers, I put them together, it\r\ncan’t be called making; it’s not workmanship”) who “put together”\r\nin the hastiest manner, and in any way not positively offensive to\r\nthe eye, articles of household furniture. The “slaughterers” who\r\nsupply all the goods required for the furniture of a house, buy at\r\n“starvation prices” (the common term), the artificer being often kept\r\nwaiting for hours, and treated with every indignity. One East-end\r\n“slaughterer” (as I ascertained in a former inquiry) used habitually\r\nto tell that he prayed for wet Saturday afternoons, because it put\r\n20_l._ extra into his pocket! This was owing to the damage sustained\r\nin the appearance of any painted, varnished, or polished article, by\r\nexposure to the weather; or if it had been protected from the weather,\r\nby the unwillingness of the small master to carry it to another\r\nslaughter-house in the rain. Under such circumstances--and under most\r\nof the circumstances of this unhappy trade--the poor workman is at the\r\nmercy of the slaughterer.\r\n\r\nI describe this matter more fully than I might have deemed necessary,\r\nhad I not found that both the “small masters” spoken of--for I called\r\nupon some of them again--and the street-sellers, very frequently\r\nconfounded the “swag-shop” and the “slaughter-house.” The distinction\r\nI hold to be this:--The slaughterer buys as a rule, with hardly an\r\nexception, the furniture, or whatever it may be, made for the express\r\npurpose of being offered to him on speculation of sale. The swag\r\nshop-keeper _orders_ his goods as a rule, and buys, as an exception, in\r\nthe manner in which the slaughterer buys ordinarily. The slaughterer\r\nsells by retail; the swag-shop keeper only by wholesale.\r\n\r\nMost of the articles, of the class of which I now treat, are “Brummagem\r\nmade.” An experienced tradesman said to me: “All these low-priced\r\nmetal things, fancy goods and all, which you see about, are made in\r\nBirmingham; in nineteen cases out of twenty at the least. They may\r\nbe marked London, or Sheffield, or Paris, or any place--you can have\r\nthem marked North Pole if you will--but they’re genuine Birmingham.\r\nThe carriage is lower from Birmingham than from Sheffield--that’s one\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nThe majority of the swag-shop proprietors are Jews. The wares\r\nwhich they supply to the cheap shops, the cheap John’s, and the\r\nstreet-sellers, in town and country, consist of every variety of\r\narticle, apart from what is eatable, drinkable, or wearable, in which\r\nthe trade class I have specified can deal. As regards what is wearable,\r\nindeed, such things as braces, garters, &c., form a portion of the\r\nstock of the swag-shop.\r\n\r\nIn one street (a thoroughfare at the east-end of London) are\r\ntwenty-three of these establishments. In the windows there is\r\nlittle attempt at display; the design aimed at seems to be rather\r\nto _crowd_ the window--as if to show the amplitude of the stores\r\nwithin, “the wonderful resources of this most extensive and universal\r\nestablishment”--than to tempt purchasers by exhibiting tastefully what\r\nmay have been tastefully executed by the artificer, or what it is\r\ndesired should be held to be so executed.\r\n\r\nIn one of these windows the daylight is almost precluded from\r\nthe interior by what may be called a perfect wall of “pots.” A\r\nstreet-seller who accompanied me called them merely “pots” (the trade\r\nterm), but they were all pot ornaments. Among them were great store\r\nof shepherdesses, of greyhounds of a gamboge colour, of what I heard\r\ncalled “figures” (allegorical nymphs with and without birds or wreaths\r\nin their hands), very tall-looking Shaksperes (I did not see one of\r\nthese windows without its Shakspere, a sitting figure), and some “pots”\r\nwhich seem to be either shepherds or musicians; from what I could\r\nlearn, at the pleasure of the seller, the buyer, or the inquirer.\r\nThe shepherd, or musician is usually seated under a tree; he wears a\r\nlight blue coat, and yellow breeches, and his limbs, more than his\r\nbody, are remarkable for their bulk; to call them merely fat does not\r\nsufficiently express their character, and in some “pots,” they are\r\nas short and stumpy as they are bulky. On my asking if the dogs were\r\nintended for Italian greyhounds, I was told, “No, they are German.” I\r\nalluded however to the species of the animal represented; my informant\r\nto the place of manufacture, for the pots were chiefly German. A number\r\nof mugs however, with the Crystal Palace very well depicted upon them,\r\nwere unmistakably English. In another window of the same establishment\r\nwas a conglomeration of pincushions, shaving-brushes, letter-stamps\r\n(all in bone), cribbage-boards and boxes (including a pack of cards),\r\nnecklaces, and strings of beads.\r\n\r\nThe window of a neighbouring swag-shop presented, in the like crowding,\r\nand in greater confusion, an array of brooches (some in coloured\r\nglass to imitate rubies, topazes, &c., some containing portraits,\r\ndeeply coloured, in purple attire, and red cheeks, and some being very\r\nlarge cameos), time-pieces (with and without glasses), French toys\r\nwith moveable figures, telescopes, American clocks, musical boxes,\r\nshirt-studs, backgammon-boards, tea-trays (one with a nondescript\r\nbird of most gorgeous green plumage forming a sort of centrepiece),\r\nrazor-strops writing-desks, sailors’ knives, hair-brushes, and\r\ntobacco-boxes.\r\n\r\nAnother window presented even a more “miscellaneous assortment;” dirks\r\n(apparently not very formidable weapons), a mess of steel pens, in\r\nbrown-paper packages and cases, and of black-lead pencils, pipe-heads,\r\ncigar-cases, snuff-boxes, razors, shaving-brushes, letter-stamps,\r\nmetal tea-pots, metal tea-spoons, glass globes with artificial flowers\r\nand leaves within the glass (an improvement one man thought on the\r\nold ornament of a reel in a bottle), Peel medals, Exhibition medals,\r\nroulette-boxes, scent bottles, quill pens with artificial flowers\r\nin the feathery part, fans, side-combs, glass pen-holders, and pot\r\nfigures (caricatures) of Louis Philippe, carrying a very red umbrella,\r\nMarshal Haynau, with some instrument of torture in his hand, while\r\nover all boomed a huge English seaman, in yellow waistcoat and with a\r\nbrick-coloured face.\r\n\r\nSometimes the furniture of a swag-shop window is less plentiful, but\r\nquite as heterogenous. In one were only American clocks, French toys\r\n(large), opera-glasses, knives and forks, and powder-flasks.\r\n\r\nIn some windows the predominant character is jewellery. Ear-drops\r\n(generally gilt), rings of all kinds, brooches of every size and shade\r\nof coloured glass, shawl-pins, shirt-studs, necklaces, bead purses,\r\nsmall paintings of the Crystal-palace, in “burnished ‘gold’ frames,”\r\nwatch-guards, watch-seals (each with three impressions or mottoes),\r\nwatch-chains and keys, “silver” tooth-picks, medals, and snuff-boxes.\r\nIt might be expected that the jewellery shops would present the most\r\nimposing display of any; they are, on the contrary, among the dingiest,\r\nas if it were not worth the trouble to put clean things in the window,\r\nbut merely what sufficed to characterise the nature of the trade\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-three swag-shops in question, five were confined to\r\nthe trade in all the branches of stationery. Of these I saw one, the\r\nlarge window of which was perfectly packed from bottom to top with\r\nnote-paper, account and copy-books, steel-pens, pencils, sealing-wax,\r\nenamelled wafers (in boxes), ink-stands, &c.\r\n\r\nOf the other shops, two had cases of watches, with no attempt at\r\ndisplay, or even arrangement. “Poor things,” I was told by a person\r\nfamiliar with the trade in them, “fit only to offer to countrymen when\r\nthey’ve been drinking at a fair, and think themselves clever.”\r\n\r\nI have so far described the exterior of these street-dealers’ bazaars,\r\nthe swag-shops, in what may be called their head-quarters. Upon\r\nentering some of these places of business, spacious rooms are seen to\r\nextend behind the shop or warehouse which opens to the street. Some\r\nare almost blocked up with what appears a litter of packing-cases,\r\npackages, and bales--but which are no doubt ordered systematically\r\nenough--while the shelves are crammed with goods in brown paper, or\r\nin cases or boxes. This uniformity of package, so to speak, has the\r\neffect of destroying the true character of these swag store-rooms;\r\nfor they present the appearance of only three or four different kinds\r\nof merchandise being deposited on a range of shelves, when, perhaps,\r\nthere are a hundred. In some of these swag-shops it appears certain,\r\nboth from what fell under my own observation, and from what I learned\r\nthrough my inquiries of persons long familiar with such places,\r\nthat the “litter” I have spoken of is disposed so as to present the\r\nappearance of an affluence of goods without the reality of possession.\r\n\r\nIn no warehouses (properly “swag,” or wholesale traders) is there any\r\narranged display of the wares vended. “Ve don’t vant people here,”\r\none street-seller had often heard a swag-shopkeeper say, “as looks\r\nabout them, and says, ‘’Ow purty!--Vot nice things!’ Ve vants to sell,\r\nand not to show. Ve is all for bisness, and be d----d.” All of these\r\nplaces which I saw were dark, more or less so, in the interior, as if a\r\ncustomer’s inspection were uncared for.\r\n\r\nSome of the swag-shop people present cards, or “circulars with prices,”\r\nto their street and other customers, calling attention to the variety\r\nof their wares. These circulars are not given without inquiry, as if\r\nit were felt that one must not be wasted. On one I find the following\r\nenumeration:--\r\n\r\n Shopkeepers and Dealers supplied with the following Articles:--\r\n\r\n CLOCKS--American, French, German, and English eight-day dials.\r\n\r\n WATCHES--Gold and Silver.\r\n\r\n MUSICAL BOXES--Two, Four, Six, and Eight Airs.\r\n\r\n WATCH-GLASSES--Common Flint, Geneva, and Lunettes.\r\n\r\n MAIN-SPRINGS--Blue and Straw-colour, English and Geneva.\r\n\r\n WATCH MATERIALS--Of every description.\r\n\r\n JEWELLERY--A general assortment.\r\n\r\n SPECTACLES--Gold, Silver, Steel, Horn, and Metal Frames, Concave,\r\n Convex, Coloured, and Smoked Eyes.\r\n\r\n TELESCOPES--One, two, and three draws.\r\n\r\n MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n COMBS--Side, Dressing, Curl, Pocket, Ivory, Small-Tooth, &c.\r\n\r\n MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS--Violins, Violincellos, Bows, &c., Flutes,\r\n Clarionets, Trombones, Ophoclides, Cornopeans, French-Horns,\r\n Post-Horns, Trumpets, and Passes, Violin Tailboards, Pegs, and Bridges.\r\n\r\n ACCORDIONS--French and German of every size and style.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that swag-shops are mainly repositories of\r\n“fancy” articles, for such is not the case. I have described only\r\nthe “windows” and outward appearances of these places--the interior\r\nbeing little demonstrative of the business; but the bulkier and more\r\nuseful articles of swag traffic cannot be exposed in a window. In\r\nthe miscellaneous (or Birmingham and Sheffield) shops, however, the\r\nuseful and the “fancy” are mixed together; as is shown by the following\r\nextracts from the Circular of one of the principal swag-houses. I give\r\neach head, with an occasional statement of prices. The firm describe\r\nthemselves as “Wholesale, Retail, and Export Furnishing Ironmongers,\r\nGeneral Hardwaremen, Manufacturers of Clocks, Watches, and Steel Pens,\r\nand Importers of Toys, Beads, and other Foreign Manufactures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n _Table Cutlery._\r\n\r\n                                                                _s._  _d._\r\n  Common knives and forks, per doz.                              2     0\r\n  Ivory-handle table knives and fork, per set of fifty-pieces   30     0\r\n  Tables, per doz.                                              15     0\r\n  Desserts, per doz.                                            11     3\r\n  Carvers, per pair                                              4     0\r\n\r\n\r\n _Fire-Irons._\r\n\r\n  Strong wrought-iron for kitchens, per set 2_s._ to             6     0\r\n  Ditto for parlours or libraries, bright pans, 4_s._ 6_d._ to   7     0\r\n\r\n\r\n _Fenders._\r\n\r\n  Kitchen fenders, 3 ft. long, with sliding bar                  3     0\r\n  Green ditto, brass tops, for bed rooms                         1     8\r\n\r\n “Britannia Metal Goods” (tea-pots, &c.), “German Silver Goods”\r\n (tea-spoons, 1_s._ to 2_s._ per dozen, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n _Bellows._\r\n\r\n  Kitchen, each                                       10_d._ to  2     0\r\n  Parlour ditto, brass pipes and nails           2_s._ 3_d._ to  3     0\r\n\r\n Japanned goods, brass goods, iron saucepans, oval iron pots, iron\r\n tea-kettles, &c., iron stew-pans, &c. The prices here run very\r\n systematically:--\r\n\r\n  One quart                                                      1     2\r\n  Three pints                                                    1     8\r\n  Two quarts                                                     2     0\r\n  Three quarts                                                   3     0\r\n  Four quarts                                                    3     9\r\n  Five quarts                                                    4     0\r\n\r\nPatent enamelled saucepans, oval tin boilers, tin saucepans,\r\ntea-kettles, coffee-pots. In all these useful articles the prices\r\nrange in the same way as in the iron stew-pans. Copper goods\r\n(kettles, coal-scoops, &c.), tin fish-kettles, dish-covers, rosewood\r\nworkboxes, glass, brushes, (tooth, hair, clothes, scrubbing, stove,\r\nshoe, japanned hearth, banister, plate, carpet, and dandy), tools,\r\nplated goods (warranted silver edges), snuffers, beads, musical\r\ninstruments (accordions from 1_s._ to 5_s._, &c.). Then come dials\r\nand clocks, combs, optics, spectacles, eye-glasses, telescopes, opera\r\nglasses, each 10_d._ to 10_s._, China ornaments, lamps, sundries\r\n(these I give verbatim, to show the nature of the trade), crimping\r\nand goffering-machines, from 14_s._, looking-glasses, pictures, &c.,\r\nbeads of every kind, watch-guards, shaving-boxes, guns, pistols,\r\npowder-flasks, belts, percussion caps, &c., corkscrews, 6_d._ to 2_s._,\r\nnut-cracks, 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._, folding measures, each 2_s._ to\r\n4_s._, silver spoons, haberdashery, skates per pair 2_s._ to 10_s._,\r\ncarpet bags, each 3_s._ to 10_s._, egg-boilers, tapers, flat and box\r\nirons, Italian irons and heaters, earthenware jugs, metal covers,\r\ntea-pots, plaited straw baskets, sieves, wood pails, camera-obscuras,\r\nmedals, amulets, perfumery and fancy soaps of all kinds, mathematical\r\ninstruments, steel pens, silver and German silver patent pencil-cases\r\nand leads, snuff-boxes “in great variety,” strops, ink, slates,\r\nmetal eyelet-holes and machines, padlocks, braces, belts, Congreves,\r\nlucifers, fuzees, pocket-books, bill-cases, bed-keys, and a great\r\nvariety of articles too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the specific character and arrangement of the\r\n“Circulars with prices,” it is common enough for the swag-shop\r\nproprietors to intimate to any one likely to purchase that those prices\r\nare not altogether to be a guidance, as thirty-five per cent. discount\r\nis allowed on the amount of a ready-money purchase. One of the largest\r\n“swags” made such an allowance to a street-seller last week.\r\n\r\nThe swag-shops (of which I state the numbers in a parenthesis) are in\r\nHoundsditch (their principal locality) (23), Minories (4), Whitechapel\r\n(2), Ratcliffe-highway (20), Shoreditch (1), Long-lane, Smithfield\r\n(4), Fleet-lane (2), Holywell-street, Strand (1), Tothill-street\r\n(4), Compton-street, Soho (1), Hatton-garden (2), Clerkenwell\r\n(10), Kent-street, Borough (8), New-cut (6), Blackman-street (2),\r\nTooley-street (3), London-road (3), Borough-road (1), Waterloo-road\r\n(4)--in all 101; but a person who had been upwards of twenty years a\r\nfrequenter of these places counted up fifty others, many of them in\r\nobscure courts and alleys near Houndsditch, Ratcliffe Highway, &c.,\r\n&c. These “outsiders” are generally of a smaller class than those I\r\nhave described; “and I can tell you, sir,” the same man said, “some\r\nof them--ay, and some of the big ones, too--are real _swag_-shops\r\nstill,--partly so, that is; you understand me, sir.” The word “swag,” I\r\nshould inform my polite readers, means in slang language, “plunder.”\r\n\r\nIt may be safely calculated, then, that there are 150 swag-shops to\r\nwhich the different classes of street-sellers resort for the purchase\r\nof stock. Among these establishments are pot swag, stationery swag,\r\nhaberdashery swag, jewellery swag, and miscellaneous swag--the latter\r\ncomprise far more than half of the entire number, and constitute the\r\nwarehouses which are described by their owners as “Birmingham and\r\nSheffield,” or “English and Foreign,” or “English and German.” It is\r\nin these last-mentioned “swags” that the class I now treat of--the\r\nstreet-sellers of metal manufactures--find the commodities of their\r\ntrade. To this, however, there is one exception. Tins for household\r\nuse are not sold at the general swag-shops; but “fancy tins,” such\r\nas japanned and embellished trays, are vended there extensively. The\r\nstreet-sellers of this order are supplied at the “tin-shops,”--the\r\nnumber of the wholesale tin-men supplying the street-sellers is about\r\nfifty. The principle on which the business is conducted is precisely\r\nthat of the more general swag-shop; but I shall speak of them when I\r\ntreat of the street-sellers of tins.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man, who had been employed in different capacities in\r\nsome of the principal swag-shops, told me of one which had been carried\r\non by the same family, from father to son, for more than seventy\r\nyears. In the largest of the “swags” about 200 “hands” are employed,\r\nin the various capacities of salesmen, buyers, clerks, travellers,\r\nunpackers, packers, porters, &c., &c. On some mornings twenty-five\r\nlarge packages--some of small articles entirely--are received from the\r\ncarriers. In one week, when my informant assisted in “making up the\r\nbooks,” the receipts were upwards of 3000_l._ “In my opinion, sir,” he\r\nsaid, “and it’s from an insight into the business, Mr. ----’s profit\r\non that 3000_l._ was not less than thirty-five per cent.; for he’s a\r\ngreat capitalist, and pays for everything down upon the nail; that’s\r\nmore than 1000_l._ profit in a week. Certainly it was an extra week,\r\nand there’s the 200 hands to pay,--but that wouldn’t range higher than\r\n300_l._, indeed, not so high; and there’s heavy rent and taxes, and\r\nrates, no doubt, and he (the proprietor is a Jew) is a fair man to the\r\ntrade, and not an uncharitable man--but he will drive a good bargain\r\nwhere it’s possible; so considering everything, sir, the profits must\r\nbe very great, and they are mostly made out of poor buyers, who sell\r\nit to poor people in the streets, or in small shops. It’s a wonderful\r\ntrade.”\r\n\r\nFrom the best information I could obtain I come to the conclusion\r\nthat, including small and large shops, 3000_l._ yearly is the average\r\nreceipt of each--or, as it is most frequently expressed, that sum\r\nis “turned over” by the swag-shop keepers yearly. There is great\r\ncompetition in the trade, and much of what is called “cutting,” or\r\none tradesman underselling another. The profit consequently varies\r\nfrom twenty to thirty-five and (rarely) fifty per cent. Sometimes a\r\nswag-shop proprietor is “hung-up” with a stock the demand for which\r\nhas ceased, and he must dispose of it as “a job lot,” to make room\r\nfor other goods, and thus is necessarily “out of pocket.” The smaller\r\nswag-shops do not “turn over” 500_l._ a year. The calculation I have\r\ngiven shows an outlay, yearly, of 450,000_l._ at the swag-shops of\r\nLondon; “but,” said a partner in one of these establishments, “what\r\nproportion of the goods find their way into the streets, what to the\r\nshops, what to the country, and what for shipping, I cannot form even a\r\nguess, for we never ask a customer for what purpose he wants the goods,\r\nthough sometimes he will say, ‘I must have what is best for such or\r\nsuch a trade.’ Say half a million turned over in a year, sir, by the\r\nwarehousemen who sell to the street-people, among others, and you’re\r\nwithin the mark.”\r\n\r\nI found the street-sellers characterize the “swags” as hard and\r\ngrinding men, taking every advantage “in the way of trade.” There is,\r\ntoo, I was told by a man lately employed in a swag-shop a constant\r\ncollision of clamour and bargaining, not to say of wits, between\r\nthe smarter street-sellers--the pattering class especially--and the\r\nswag-men with whom they are familiar.\r\n\r\nThe points in which the “swag-shops” resemble the “slaughter-houses,”\r\nare in the traffic in work-boxes, desks, and dressing-cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF A CHEAP-JOHN.\r\n\r\nThe following narrative, relative to this curious class, who, in\r\nmany respects, partake of the characteristics which I have pointed\r\nout as proper to the mountebank of old, was taken from one of the\r\nfraternity. It may be cited as an example of those who are bred to the\r\nstreets:--“My father and mother,” said he, “both followed a travelling\r\noccupation, and were engaged in vending different things, from the\r\nold brimstone matches up to clothes lines, clothes props, and clothes\r\npegs. They never got beyond these,--the other articles were thread,\r\ntapes, nutmeg graters, shoe-ties, stay-laces, and needles. My father,\r\nmy mother used to tell me, was a great scholard, and had not always\r\nbeen a travelling vagrant. My mother had never known any other life. I,\r\nhowever, did not reap any benefit from my father’s scholarship. At a\r\nvery early age, five or six perhaps, I recollect myself a poor little\r\nneglected wretch, sent out each day with a roll of matches, with strict\r\ninjunctions not to come home without selling them, and to bring home a\r\ncertain sum of money, upon pain of receiving a sound thrashing, which\r\nthreat was mostly put into execution whenever I failed to perform the\r\ntask imposed upon me. My father seldom worked, that is, seldom hawked,\r\nbut my mother, poor thing, had to travel and work very hard to support\r\nfour of us--my father, myself, and a sister, who is since dead. I was\r\nbut little assistance, and sometimes when I did not bring home the sum\r\nrequired, she would make it up, and tell my father I had been a good\r\nboy. My father was an inveterate drinker, and a very violent temper.\r\nMy mother, I am sorry to say, used to drink too, but I believe that\r\nill-usage drove her to it. They led a dreadful life; I scarcely felt\r\nany attachment for them; home we had none, one place was as good\r\nanother to us. I left my parents when scarcely eight years old. I had\r\nreceived a thrashing the day before for being a defaulter in my sale,\r\nand I determined the following morning to decamp; and accordingly, with\r\nmy nine-pennyworth of matches (the quantity generally allotted me), I\r\nset out to begin the world upon my own account. Although this occurred\r\n25 years ago, I have never met my parents since. My father, I heard,\r\ndied a few years after my leaving, but my mother I know not whether\r\nshe be living or dead. I left my parents at Dover, and journeyed on\r\nto London. I knew there were lodging-houses for travellers in every\r\ntown, some of them I had stopped at with my father and mother. I told\r\nthe people of these houses that my parents would arrive the following\r\nday, and paid my 2_d._ for the share of a third, fourth, fifth, or even\r\nsixth part of a bed, according to the number of children who inhabited\r\nthe lodging-house upon that particular night. My matches I could always\r\nsell if I tried, but I used to play my time away, and many times night\r\nhas arrived before I thought of effecting sales sufficient to pay my\r\nexpenses at the beggar’s hotel. Broken victuals I got in abundance,\r\nindeed more than sufficient for my own consumption. The money I\r\nreceived for the matches, after paying my lodging, and purchasing\r\na pennyworth of brimstone to make more (the wood I begged at the\r\ncarpenters), I gambled away at cards. Yes, young as I was, I understood\r\nBlind Hookey. I invariably lost; of course I was cheated.\r\n\r\n“I remained in a lodging house in Mill-lane, Deptford, for two years,\r\ndiscontinued the match-selling, and, having a tidy voice, took to\r\nhawking songs through the public-houses. The sailors used to ask me to\r\nsing, and there were few days that I did not accumulate 2_s._ 6_d._,\r\nand from that to 4_s._, especially when I chose to be industrious; but\r\nmy love of pitch and toss and blind hookey always kept me poor. I often\r\ngot into debt with my landlady, and had no difficulty in doing so,\r\nfor I always felt a pride in paying. From selling the printed songs,\r\nI imbibed a wish to learn to read, and, with the assistance of an old\r\nsoldier, I soon acquired sufficient knowledge to make out the names\r\nof each song, and shortly afterwards I could study a song and learn\r\nthe words without any one helping me. I stopped in Deptford until I\r\nwas something more than twelve years old. I had then laid the songs\r\naside, and taken to hawking small wares, tapes, thread, &c.; and in the\r\nwinter season I was a buyer of rabbit and hare skins. I kept at this\r\nfor about three years, sometimes entirely without a stock. I had run\r\nit out, perhaps gambled it away; and at such times I suffered great\r\nprivations. I never could beg. I have often tried, but never could.\r\nI have approached a house with a begging intention, knocked at the\r\ndoor, and when it has been opened I have requested a drink of water.\r\nWhen I was about 16 I joined in partnership with a man who used to\r\nmake phosphorus boxes. I sold them for him. A piece of phosphorus was\r\nstuck in a tin tube, the match was dipped into the phosphorus, and it\r\nwould ignite by friction. I was hawking these boxes in Norwich, when\r\nthe constable considered they were dreadful affairs, and calculated\r\nto encourage and assist thieves and burglars. He took me before the\r\nmagistrate, at the beak’s own private house, and he being equally\r\nhorrified, I was sent to prison for a month. I have often thought since\r\nthat the proceeding was illegal. What would be said now if a man was\r\nto be sent to jail for selling lucifer matches? In Norwich prison I\r\nassociated with the rest, and if I had been inclined to turn thief\r\nI had plenty of opportunities and offers of gratuitous instruction.\r\nThe separate or silent system was not in vogue then. I worked on the\r\ntreadmill. Dinner was allowed to be sent in on the Sunday by the\r\nprisoner’s friends. My dinner was sent in on the first Sunday by the\r\nman I sold the boxes for, as it was on the second, third, and fourth;\r\nbut I had lost it before I received it. I had always gambled it away,\r\nfor there were plenty of opportunities of doing so in the prisons\r\nthen. On leaving the jail I received 1_s._; with this I purchased\r\nsome songs and travelled to Yarmouth. I could do best among sailors.\r\nAfter a few weeks I had accumulated about 8_s._, and with that sum I\r\npurchased some hardware at the swag-shop, commenced hawking, and cut\r\nthe vocal department altogether; still I gambled and kept myself in\r\npoverty. In the course of time, however, I had amassed a basket of\r\ngoods, worth, perhaps, 3_l._ I gambled and lost them all in one night.\r\nI was so downcast and unhappy from this circumstance, that it caused\r\nme to reflect seriously, and I made an oath that I never would gamble\r\nagain. I have kept it, and have reason to bless the day that I made so\r\ngood a resolution. After losing my basket of goods, the winner gave\r\nme articles amounting to a few shillings, and I began the world once\r\nmore. Shortly afterwards I commenced rag gatherer, and changed my goods\r\nfor old rags, of course not refusing cash in payment. My next step was\r\nto have some bills printed, whereon I requested all thrifty wives to\r\nlook out their old rags or old metal, or old bones, &c.; stating at\r\nthe bottom that the bill would be called for, and that a good price in\r\nready money would be given for all useless lumber, &c. Some months at\r\nthis business realized me a pretty sum of money. I was in possession of\r\nnearly 5_l._ Then I discontinued the rag-gathering; not that the trade\r\nwas declining, but I did not like it--I was ambitious. I purchased a\r\nneat box, and started to sell a little Birmingham jewellery. I was\r\nnow respectably dressed, was getting a living, and had entirely left\r\noff stopping at common lodging-houses; but I confined my visits to\r\nsmall villages--I was afraid of the law; and as I was pursuing my\r\ncalling near Wakefield, a constable inquired for my hawker’s licence.\r\nI had none to produce. He took me into custody, and introduced me to\r\na magistrate, who committed me to prison for a month, and took away\r\nmy box of goods. I endured the month’s imprisonment upon the silent\r\nsystem; they cut my hair short; and at the expiration of the term I was\r\nthrust out upon the world heart-broken, without a shilling, to beg, to\r\nsteal, or to starve.\r\n\r\n“I proceeded to Leeds, the fair was on at this time. I got engaged\r\nto assist a person, from whom I had been accustomed occasionally to\r\npurchase goods. He was a ‘Cheap-John.’ In the course of the day he\r\nsuggested that I should have a try at the hand-selling. I mounted\r\nthe platform, and succeeded beyond my own expectations or that of my\r\nmaster. He offered me a regular engagement, which I accepted. At times\r\nI would help him sell, and at other times I hawked with his licence. I\r\nhad regular wages, besides all I could get above a certain price that\r\nhe placed upon each of the goods. I remained with this person some\r\nfifteen months, at the end of which period I commenced for myself,\r\nhaving saved nearly 25_l._ I began at once the hand-selling, and\r\npurchased a hawker’s licence, which enabled me to sell without danger.\r\nThen I always called at the constable’s house, and gave a louder\r\nknock at his door than any other person’s, proud of my authority, and\r\nassured of my safety. At first I borrowed an empty cart, in which I\r\nstood and sold my wares. I could chaff as well as the best, and was as\r\ngood a salesman as most of them. After that I purchased a second-hand\r\ncart from a person who had lately started a waggon. I progressed and\r\nimproved in circumstances, and at last bought a very handsome waggon\r\nfor myself. I have now a nice caravan, and good stock of goods, worth\r\nat least 500_l._ Money I have but little. I always invest it in goods.\r\nI am married, and have got a family. I always travel in the summer, but\r\nremain at home during the winter. My wife never travels. She remains\r\nbehind, and manages a little swag-shop, which always turns in at least\r\nthe family expenses.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET-SELLERS OF CUTLERY.\r\n\r\nThe cutlery sold in the streets of London consists of razors,\r\npen-knives, pocket-knives, table and carving-knives and forks,\r\nscissors, shears, nail-filers, and occasionally (if ordered) lancets.\r\nThe knives are of various kinds--such as sailors’ knives (with a\r\nhole through the handle), butchers’ knives, together with choppers\r\nand steels (sold principally at Newgate and Billinsgate Markets, and\r\nround about the docks), oyster and fish-knives (sold principally at\r\nBillinsgate and Hungerford Markets), bread-knives (hawked at the\r\nbakers’ shops), ham and beef knives (hawked at the ham and beef shops),\r\ncheese-knives with tasters, and ham-triers, shoemakers’ knives, and\r\na variety of others. These articles are usually purchased at the\r\n“swag-shops,” and the prices of them vary from 2-1/2_d._ to 1_s._\r\n1-1/2_d._ each. They are bought either by the dozen, half-dozen, or\r\nsingly, according to the extent of the street-seller’s stock-money.\r\nHence it would appear that the street-seller of cutlery can begin\r\nbusiness with only a few pence; but it is only when the swag-shop\r\nkeeper has known the street-seller that he will consent to sell\r\none knife alone “to sell again;” to street-sellers with whom he is\r\nunacquainted, he will not vend less than half-a-dozen. Even where the\r\nstreet-seller is known, he has, if “cracked-up,” to beg hard, I am\r\ntold, before he can induce the warehouseman to let him have only one\r\narticle. “The swag-shops won’t be bothered with it,” say the men--“what\r\nare our troubles to them? if the rain starves us out and makes us eat\r\nup all our stock-money, what is it to such folks? they wouldn’t let\r\nus have even a row of pins without the money for ’em--no, not if we\r\nwas to drop down dead for want of bread in their shops. They have been\r\ndeceived by such a many that now they won’t listen to none.” I subjoin\r\na list of the prices paid and received by the street-sellers of cutlery\r\nfor the principal articles in which they deal:\r\n\r\n                          Lowest      Sold at    Highest     Sold at\r\n                          price paid  in the     price paid  in the\r\n                          per         streets.   per         streets.\r\n                          half-dozen.            half-dozen.\r\n\r\n                       _s._  _d._  _s._  _d._  _s._  _d._  _s._  _d._\r\n  Table-knives and forks  1   3       2   0       5   0       7   6\r\n    Ditto, without forks  0   9       1   3       4   0       6   0\r\n  Pocket-knives           1   0       1   6       4   0       6   0\r\n  Pen-knives              1   9       2   6       2   6       3   9\r\n  Razors                  1   9       2   6       5   0       7   6\r\n  Scissors                0   3-1/2   0   6       1   9       2   6\r\n\r\nTheir usual rate of profit is 50 per cent., but rather than refuse a\r\nready sale the street cutlery-seller will often take much less. Many\r\nof the sellers only pursue the trade for a few weeks in the year. A\r\nnumber of the Irish labourers take to it in the winter-time when they\r\ncan get no work. Some few of the sellers are countrymen, but these\r\nmostly follow the business continuously. “I don’t see as there is\r\nhardly one upon the list as has ever been a cutler by trade,” said one\r\nstreet-seller to me, “and certainly none of the cutlery-sellers have\r\never belonged to Sheffield--they may say so, but its only a dodge.” The\r\ncutlery street-sellers are not one-quarter so numerous as they were\r\ntwo years back. “The reason is,” I am told, “that things are got so\r\nbad a man can’t live by the trade--mayhap he has to walk three miles\r\nnow before he can sell for 1_s._ a knife that has cost him 8-1/2_d._,\r\nand then mayhap he is faint, and what’s 3-1/2_d._, sir, to keep body\r\nand soul together, when a man most likely has had no victuals all the\r\nday before.” If they had a good bit of stock they might perhaps get a\r\ncrust, they say. “Things within the last two or three years,” to quote\r\nthe words of one of my informants, “have been getting much worse in\r\nthe streets; ’specially in the cutlery line. I can’t give no account\r\nfor it, I’m sure, sir; the sellers have not been half as many as they\r\nwere. What’s become of them that’s gone, I can’t tell; they’re in the\r\nworkhouse, I dare say.” But, notwithstanding this decrease in the\r\nnumber of sellers, there is a greater difficulty to vend their goods\r\nnow than formerly. “It’s all owing to the times, that’s all I can say.\r\nPeople, shopkeepers, and all says to me, I can’t tell why things is\r\nso bad, and has been so bad in trade; but so they is. We has to walk\r\nfarther to sell our goods, and people beat us down so terrible hard,\r\nthat we can’t get a penny out of them when we do sell. Sometimes they\r\noffers me 9_d._, yes, and often 6_d._ for an 8-1/2_d._ knife; and often\r\nenough 4_d._ for one that stands you in 3-3/4_d._--a 1/4_d._ profit,\r\nthink of that, sir. Then they say, ‘Well, my man, will you take my\r\nmoney?’ and so as to make you do so, they’ll flash it before your eyes,\r\nas if they knew you was a starving, and would be sure to be took in\r\nby the sight of it. Yes, sir, it is a very hard life, and we has to\r\nput up with a good deal--a good deal--starvation and hard-dealing, and\r\ninsults and knockings about, and all. And then you see the swag-shops\r\nis almost as hard on us as the buyers. The swag-men will say, if you\r\nmerely makes a remark, that a knife they’ve sold you is cracked in the\r\nhandle, ‘Oh, is it; let me see whereabouts;’ and when you hands it to\r\n’em to show it ’em, they’ll put it back where they took it from, and\r\ntell you, ‘You’re too particular by half, my man. You’d better go and\r\nget your goods somewhere else; here take your money, and go on about\r\nyour business, for we won’t sarve you at all.’ They’ll do just the same\r\nwith the scissors too, if you complains about their being a bit rusty.\r\n‘Go somewhere else,’ they’ll say, ‘We won’t sarve you.’ Ah, sir, that’s\r\nwhat it is to be a poor man; to have your poverty flung in your teeth\r\nevery minute. People says, ‘to be poor and seem poor is the devil;’\r\nbut to be poor, and be treated like a dog merely because you _are_\r\npoor, surely is ten thousand times worse. A street-seller now-a-days is\r\nlooked upon as a ‘cadger,’ and treated as one. To try to get a living\r\nfor one’s self is to do something shameful in these times.”\r\n\r\nThe man then gave me the following history of himself. He was a\r\nkindly-looking and hearty old man. He had on a ragged fustian jacket,\r\nover which he wore a black greasy-looking and tattered oilskin\r\ncoat--the collar of this was torn away, and the green baize lining\r\nalone visible. His waistcoat was patched in every direction, while his\r\ntrousers appeared to be of corduroy; but the grease and mud was so\r\nthick upon them, that it was difficult to tell of what material they\r\nwere made. His shoes--or rather what remained of them--were tied on his\r\nfeet with pieces of string. His appearance altogether denoted great\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n“My father was a farmer, sir. He had two farms, about 800 acres in all.\r\nI was one of eleven (ten sons and one daughter). Seven years before\r\nmy father’s death he left his farm, and went to live on his money.\r\nHe had made a good bit at farming; but when he died it was all gone,\r\nand we was left to shift as we could. I had little or no education.\r\nMy brothers could read and write, but I didn’t take to it; I went a\r\nbird’s-nesting, boy-like, instead, so that what little I did larn I\r\nhave forgot. I am very sorry for that now. I used to drive the plough,\r\nand go a harrowing for father. I was brought up to nothing else. When\r\nfather died, I thought as I should like to see London. I was a mere\r\nlad--about 20--and so I strolled up to town. I had 10_s._ with me,\r\nand that, with a bundle, was all that I possessed in the world. When\r\nI got to London I went to lodge at a public-house--the Red Lion--in\r\nGreat Wild-street; and while I was there I sought about for work,\r\nbut could not get any; when all was gone, I was turned out into the\r\nstreets, and walked about for two days and two nights, without a bed,\r\nor a bit to eat, unless what I picked out of the gutter, and eat like\r\na dog--orange-peel and old cabbage-stumps, indeed _anything_ I could\r\nfind. When I was very hard put to it, I was coming down Drury-lane,\r\nand I looked in, quite casual like, to ask for a job of work at the\r\nshop of Mr. Bolton, the needle-maker from Redditch. I told him as how\r\nI was nigh starving, and would do anything to get a crust; I didn’t\r\nmind what I put my hand to. He said he would try me, and gave me two\r\npackets of needles to sell--they was the goolden-eyed ones of that\r\ntime of day--and he said when I had got rid of them I was to come back\r\nto him, and I should have two packets more. He told me the price to\r\nask--sixpence a paper--and away I went like a sand-boy, and got rid\r\nof the two in an hour and a half. Then I went back, and when I told\r\nhim what I’d done, he shook hands with me, and said, as he burst out\r\nlaughing, “Now, you see I’ve made a man of you.” Oh, he was an uncommon\r\nnice gentleman! Then he told me to keep the shilling I had taken, and\r\nsaid he would trust me with two more packets. I sold them, and two\r\nothers besides, that day. Then, he says, ‘I shall give you something\r\nelse,’ and he let me have two packets of tailors’ needles and half a\r\ndozen of tailors’ thimbles. He told me how to sell them, and where to\r\ngo, and on them I did better. I went round to the tailors’ shops and\r\nsold a good lot, but at last they stopped me, because I was taking\r\nthe bread out of the mouths of the poor blind needle-sellers what\r\nsupplies the journeymen tailors at the West-end. Then Mr. Bolton sent\r\nme down to one of his relations, a Mr. Crooks, in Fetter Lane, who was\r\na Sheffield man, and sold cutlery to the hawkers; and Mr. Crooks and\r\nMr. Bolton sot me up between them, and so I’ve followed the line ever\r\nsince. I dare say I shall continue in it to my dying day. After I got\r\nfairly set agoing, I used to make--take good and bad, wet and dry days\r\ntogether--18_s._ a week; three shillings a day was what I calculated\r\non at the least, and to do that I was obligated to take between 2_l._\r\nand 3_l._ a week, or about eight or nine shillings each day. I went\r\non doing this for upwards of thirty year. I have been nearly forty\r\nyears, altogether, in the streets, selling cutlery. I did very tidy\r\ntill about 4 years back--I generally made from 18_s._ to 1_l._ a week\r\nup to that time. I used to go round the country--to Margate, Brighton,\r\nPortsmouth--I mostly travelled by the coast, calling at all the\r\nsea-port towns, for I always did best among the sailors. I went away\r\nevery Spring time, and came to London again at the fall of the year.\r\nSixteen year ago, I married the widow of a printer--a pressman--she had\r\nno money, but you see I had no home, and I thought I should be more\r\ncomfortable, and so I have been--a great deal more comfortable--and\r\nso I should be now, if things hadn’t got so bad. Four year ago, as\r\nI was a telling you, it was just after the railways had knocked off\r\nwork, things began to get uncommon bad--before then, I had as good\r\nas 30_s._ or 40_s._ stock, and when things got slack, it went away,\r\nlittle by little. I couldn’t make profit enough to support me and my\r\nold woman--she has got the rheumatics and can’t earn me a halfpenny or\r\na farden in the world; she hasn’t done so for years. When I didn’t make\r\nenough to live upon, of course I was obligated to break into my stock;\r\nso there it kept going shilling by shilling, and sixpence by sixpence,\r\nuntil I had got nothing left to work upon--not a halfpenny. You see,\r\nfour or five months ago, I was took very bad with the rheumatic fever\r\nand gout. I got wet through in the streets, and my clothes dried on\r\nme, and the next day I was taken bad with pains in my limbs, and then\r\neverything that would fetch me a penny went to the pawn-shop; all my\r\nown and my old woman’s clothes went to get us food--blankets, sheets\r\nand all. I never would go nigh the parish; I couldn’t bring myself to\r\nhave the talk about it. When I got well and out into the streets again,\r\nI borrowed 2_s._ or 3_s._ of my landlady--I have lived with her these\r\nthree years--to get my stock again, but you see that got me so few\r\nthings, that I couldn’t fetch myself up. I lost the greater portion of\r\nmy time in going backards and forrards to the shop to get fresh goods\r\nas fast as I sold them, and so what I took wasn’t enough to earn the\r\ncommonest living for me and my missus. Since December we have been\r\nnearly starving, and that’s as true as you have got the pen in your\r\nvery hand. Sunday after Sunday we have been without a bit of dinner,\r\nand I have laid a-bed all day because we have had no coal, and then\r\nbeen obligated to go out on Monday morning without a bit of victuals\r\nbetween my lips. I’ve been so faint I couldn’t hardly walk. I’ve picked\r\nthe crusts off the tables of the tap-rooms where I have been to hawk\r\nmy goods, and put them in my pocket to eat them on the sly. Wet and\r\ndry I’m obligated to be out; let it come down ever so hard I must be\r\nin it, with scarcely a bit of shoe, and turned 60 years old, as I am.\r\nLook here, sir,” he said, holding up his foot; “look at these shoes,\r\nthe soles is all loose, you see, and let water. On wet days I hawk my\r\ngoods to respectable shops; tap-rooms is no good, decent people merely\r\nget insulted there. But in most of the shops as I goes to people tells\r\nme, ‘My good man it is as much as we can do to keep ourselves and our\r\nfamily in these cutting times.’ Now, just to show you what I done last\r\nweek. Sunday, I laid a-bed all day and had no dinner. Monday, I went\r\nout in the morning without a morsel between my lips, and with only\r\n8-1/2_d._ for stock-money; with that I bought a knife and sold it for\r\na shilling, and then I got another and another after that, and that\r\nwas my day’s work--three times 3-1/2_d._ or 10-1/2_d._ in all, to keep\r\nthe two of us. Tuesday, I sold a pair of small scissors and two little\r\npearl-handled knives, at 6_d._ each article, and cleared 10-1/2_d._ on\r\nthe whole, and that is all I did. Wednesday, I sold a razor-strop for\r\n6_d._, a four-bladed knife for a shilling, and a small hone for 6_d._;\r\nby these I cleared 10_d._ altogether. Thursday, I sold a pair of razors\r\nfor a shilling, clearing by the whole 11-1/2_d._ Friday, I got rid of\r\na pair of razors for 1_s._ 9_d._, and got 9_d._ clear.” I added up the\r\nweek’s profits and found they amounted to 4_s._ 3-1/2_d._ “That’s about\r\nright,” said the man, “out of that I shall have to pay 1_s._ for my\r\nweek’s rent; we’ve got a kitchen, so that I leave you to judge how we\r\ntwo can live out of what’s remaining.” I told him it would’nt average\r\nquite 6_d._ a day. “That’s about it,” he replied, “we have half a loaf\r\nof bread a day, and that thank God is only five farthings now. This\r\nlasts us the day, with two-penny-worth of bits of meat that my old\r\nwoman buys at a ham-shop, where they pare the hams and puts the parings\r\nby on plates to sell to poor people; and when she can’t get that, she\r\nbuys half a sheep’s head, one that’s three or four days old, for then\r\nthey sells ’em to the poor for 1-1/2_d._ the half; and these with\r\n3/4_d._ worth of tea, and 1/2_d._ worth of sugar, 1/4_d._ for a candle,\r\n1_d._ of coal--that’s seven pounds--and 3/4_d._ worth of coke--that’s\r\nhalf a peck--makes up all we gets.” These items amount to 6-1/2_d._ in\r\nall. “That’s how we do when we can get it, and when we can’t, why we\r\nlays in bed and goes without altogether.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BLIND STREET-SELLERS OF TAILORS’ NEEDLES, ETC.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with many trades, for the journeymen to buy such\r\narticles as they require in their business of those members of their\r\ncraft who have become incapacitated for work, either by old age, or\r\nby some affliction. The tailors--the shoe-makers--the carpenters--and\r\nmany others do this. These sellers are, perhaps, the most exemplary\r\ninstances of men _driven_ to the streets, or to hawking for a means\r\nof living; and they, one and all, are distinguished by that horror of\r\nthe workhouse which I have before spoken of as constituting a peculiar\r\nfeature in the operative’s character. At present I purpose treating of\r\nthe street-sellers of needles and “trimmings” to the tailors.\r\n\r\nThere are, I am informed, two dozen “broken-down” journeymen tailors\r\npursuing this avocation in and around London. “There may be more,”\r\nsaid one who had lost his sight stitching, “but I get my information\r\nfrom the needle warehouse, where we all buy our goods; and the lady\r\nthere told me she knew as many as twenty-four hawkers who were once\r\ntailors. These are all either decayed journeymen, or their widows.\r\nSome are incapacitated by age, being between sixty and seventy years\r\nold; the greater part of the aged journeymen, however, are inmates\r\nof the tailors’ almshouses. I am not aware,” said my informant, “of\r\nthere being more than one very old man hawking needles to the tailors,\r\nthough there may be many that I know nothing about. The one I am\r\nacquainted with is close upon eighty, and he is a very respectable\r\nman, much esteemed in St. James’s and St. George’s; he sells needles,\r\nand ‘London Labour and the London Poor’ to the journeymen: he is\r\nvery feeble indeed, and can scarcely get along.” Of the two dozen\r\nneedle-sellers above mentioned, there are only six who confine their\r\n“rounds” solely to the metropolis. Out of these six my informant knew\r\ntwo who were blind beside himself (one of these sells to the journeymen\r\nin the city). There are other blind tailors who were formerly hawkers\r\nof needles, but being unable to realize a subsistence thereby, have\r\nbeen obliged to become inmates of the workhouses; others have recently\r\ngained admission into the almshouses. Last February, I am assured,\r\nthere were two blind needle-sellers, and two decrepit, in St. James’s\r\nworkhouse. There are, moreover, two widows selling tailors’ needles\r\nin London. One of these, I am told, is wretchedly poor, being “eat up\r\nwith the rheumatics, and scarcely able to move”--she is the relict of\r\na blind journeyman, and well known in St. James’s. The other widow is\r\nnow in St. Pancras Workhouse, having been unable, to use the words of\r\nmy informant, “to get anything to keep life and soul together at the\r\nneedle trade;” she, too, I am told, is well known to the journeymen.\r\nThe tailors’ needle-sellers confining themselves more particularly to\r\nLondon consist of, at present, one old man, three blind, one paralyzed,\r\nand one widow; besides these, there are now in the alms-houses, two\r\ndecrepit and one paralyzed; and one widow in the workhouse, all of\r\nwhom, till recently, were needle-sellers, and originally connected with\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\n“That is all that I believe are now in London,” said one to me, “I\r\nshould, I think, know if there were more; for it is not from one place\r\nwe get our articles, but many; and there I hear that six is about\r\nthe number of tailors’ hawkers in town; the rest of the two dozen\r\nhawkers that I spoke of go a little way out into the suburbs. The six,\r\nhowever, stick to London altogether.” The needle-sellers who go into\r\nthe country, I am told, travel as far as Reading, westward, and to\r\nGravesend, in the opposite direction, or Brentwood, in Essex, and they\r\nwill keep going back’ards and for’ards to the metropolis immediately\r\ntheir stock is exhausted. These persons sell not only tailors’ needles,\r\nbut women’s needles as well, and staylaces and cottons, and small ware\r\nin general, which they get from Shepherd’s, in Compton Street; they\r\nhave all been tailors, and are incapacitated from labour, either by\r\nold age or some affliction. There was one widow of a tailor among the\r\nnumber, but it is believed she is now either too old to continue her\r\njourneys, or else that she is deceased. The town-sellers confine their\r\nperegrinations mostly to the parishes of St. James’s and St. George’s\r\n(my informant was not aware that any went even into Marylebone). One\r\ntravels the City, while the other five keep to the West End; they all\r\nsell thimbles, needles, inch-measures, bodkins, inch sticks, scissars\r\n(“when they can get them,” I was told, “and that’s very seldom”),\r\nand bees’-wax, basting cotton, and, many of them, publications. The\r\npublications vended by these men are principally the cheap periodicals\r\nof the day, and two of these street-sellers, I am informed, do much\r\nbetter with the sale of publications than by the “trimmings.” “_They_\r\nget money, sir,” said one man to me, “while _we_ are starving. They\r\nhave their set customers and have only to go round and leave the paper,\r\nand then to get their money on the Monday morning.”\r\n\r\nThe tailors’ hawkers buy their trimmings mostly at the retail shops.\r\nThey have not stock-money sufficient, I am assured, to purchase at\r\nthe wholesale houses, for “such a thing as a paper of needles large\r\ntradesmen don’t care about of selling us poor men.” They tell me that\r\nif they could buy wholesale they could get their goods one-fourth\r\ncheaper, and to be “obligated” to purchase retail is a great drawback\r\non their profits. They call at the principal tailors’ workshops,\r\nand solicit custom of the journeymen; they are almost all known\r\nto the trade, both masters and men, and, having no other means of\r\nliving, they are allowed to enter the masters’ shops, though some of\r\nthe masters, such as Allen, in Bond-street; Curlewis, Jarvis, and\r\nJones, in Conduit-street, and others, refuse the poor fellows even\r\nthis small privilege. The journeymen treat them very kindly, the\r\nneedle-sellers tell me, and generally give them part of the provisions\r\nthey have brought with them to the shop. If it was not for this the\r\nneedle-sellers, I am assured, could hardly live at all. “There’s that\r\nboy there,” said a blind tailor, speaking of the youth who had led him\r\nto my house, and who sat on the stool fast asleep by the fire,--“I’m\r\nsure he must have starved this winter if it hadn’t been for the\r\ngoodness of the men to us, for it’s little that me and his mother\r\nhas to give him; she’s gone almost as blind as myself working at the\r\n‘sank work’ (making up soldiers’ clothing). Oh, ours is a miserable\r\nlife, sir!--worn out--blind with over work, and scarcely a hole to\r\nput one’s head in, or a bit to put in one’s mouth. God Almighty knows\r\nthat’s the bare truth, sir.” Sometimes the hawkers go on their rounds\r\nand take only 2_d._, but that is not often; sometimes they take 5_s._\r\nin a day, and “that is the greatest sum,” said my informant, “I ever\r\ntook; what others might do I can’t say, but that I’m confident is about\r\nthe highest takings.” In the summer three months the average takings\r\nrise to 4_s._ per day; but in the winter they fall to 1_s._, or at the\r\noutside 1_s._ 6_d._ The business lasts only for three hours and a half\r\neach day, that is from eight till half-past eleven in the morning;\r\nafter that no good is to be done. Then the needle-sellers, I am told,\r\ngo home, and the reason of this is, I am told, if they appear in the\r\npublic streets selling or soliciting alms, the blind are exempted\r\nfrom becoming recipients of the benefits of many of the charitable\r\ninstitutions. The blind man whom I saw, told me that after he had done\r\nwork and returned home, he occupied himself with pressing the seams of\r\nthe soldiers’ clothes when his “missus” had sewed them. The tailors’\r\nneedle-sellers are all married, and one of the wives has a mangle; and\r\n“perhaps,” said my informant, “the blind husband turns the mangle\r\nwhen he goes home, but I can’t say.” Another wife is a bookfolder, but\r\nshe has no work. The needles they usually sell five a penny to the\r\njourneymen, but the most of the journeymen will take but four; they\r\nsay “we can’t get a living at all if we sell the needles cheaper. The\r\njourneymen are mostly very considerate--very indeed; much more than\r\nthe masters; for the masters won’t hardly look at us. I don’t know\r\nthat a master ever gave me a farden--and yet there’s some of them very\r\nsoothing and kind in speaking.” The profit in the needles, I am told,\r\nis rather more than 100 per cent.; “but,” say the sellers, “only think,\r\nsir, we must get rid of 150 needles even to take 3_s._ The most we ever\r\nsell in one shop is 6_d._ worth--and the usual amount is 2_d._ worth.\r\nYou can easy tell how many shops we must travel round to, in order to\r\nget rid of 3_s._ worth.” Take one shop with another, the good with the\r\nbad, they tell me they make about 1_d._ profit from each they visit.\r\nThe profit on the rest of the articles they vend is about 20 per cent.,\r\nand they calculate that all the year round, summer and winter, they may\r\nbe said to take 2_s._ a day, or 12_s._ a week; out of which they clear\r\nfrom 5_s._ to 5_s._ 6_d._ They sell far more needles than anything\r\nelse. Some of the blind needle-sellers make their own bees’-wax into\r\n“shapes,” (pennyworths) themselves, melting into and pouring into small\r\nmoulds.\r\n\r\nThe blind needle-seller whom I saw was a respectable-looking man, with\r\nthe same delicacy of hand as is peculiar to tailors, and which forms\r\nso marked a contrast to the horny palms of other workmen. He was tall\r\nand thin, and had that upward look remarkable in all blind men. His\r\neyes gave no signs of blindness (the pupils being full and black),\r\nexcept that they appeared to be directed to no one object, and though\r\nfixed, were so without the least expression of observation. His long\r\nblack surtout, though faded in colour, was far from ragged, having\r\nbeen patched and stitched in many places, while his cloth waistcoat\r\nand trowsers were clean and neat--very different from the garments of\r\nstreet-sellers in general. In his hand he carried his stick, which,\r\nas he sat, he seemed afraid to part with, for he held it fast between\r\nhis knees. He came to me accompanied by his son, a good-looking\r\nrough-headed lad, habited in a washed-out-blue French kind of pinafore,\r\nand whose duty it was to lead his blind father about on his rounds.\r\nThough the boy was decently clad, still his clothes, like those of his\r\nfather, bore many traces of that respectable kind of poverty which\r\nseeks by continuous mending to hide its rags from the world. The face\r\nof the father, too, was pinched, while there was a plaintiveness about\r\nhis voice that told of a wretched spirit-broken and afflicted man.\r\nAltogether he was one of the better kind of handicraftsmen--one of\r\nthose fine specimens of the operatives of this country--independent\r\neven in their helplessness, scorning to beg, and proud to be able\r\nto give some little equivalent for the money bestowed on them. I\r\nhave already given accounts of the “beaten-out” mechanic from those\r\nwho certainly cannot be accused of an excess of sympathy for the\r\npoor--namely the Poor Law Commissioners and masters of workhouses;\r\nand I can only add, that all my experience goes fully to bear out\r\nthe justice of these statements. As I said before, the class who are\r\n_driven_ to the streets to which the beaten-out or incapacitated\r\noperative belongs, is, of all others, the most deserving of our\r\nsympathy; and the following biography of one of this order is given\r\nto teach us to look with a kindly eye upon the many who are forced to\r\nbecome street-sellers as the sole means of saving themselves from the\r\ndegradation of pauperism or beggary.\r\n\r\n“I am 45 years of age next June,” said the blind tailor. “It is\r\nupwards of 30 years since I first went to work at the tailoring trade\r\nin London. I learnt my business under one of the old hands at Mr.\r\nCook’s, in Poland-street, and after that went to work at Guthrie’s,\r\nin Bond-street. I belonged to the Society held at the Old White Hart.\r\nI continued working for the honourable trade and belonging to Society\r\nfor about 15 years. My weekly earnings then averaged 1_l._ 16_s._ a\r\nweek while I was at work, and for several years I was seldom out of\r\nwork, for when I got into a shop it was a long time before I got out\r\nagain. I was not married then. I lived in a first floor back room,\r\nwell-furnished, and could do very comfortably indeed. I saved often my\r\n15_s._ or 16_s._ in a week, and was worth a good bit of money up to the\r\ntime of my first illness. At one period I had nearly 50_l._ by me, and\r\nhad it not been for “vacations” and “slack seasons” I should have put\r\nby more; but you see to be out of work even a few weeks makes a large\r\nhole in a journeyman’s savings. All this time I subscribed regularly to\r\nSociety, and knew that if I got superannuated I should be comfortably\r\nmaintained by the trade. I felt quite happy with the consciousness of\r\nbeing provided for in my old age or affliction then, and if it had not\r\nbeen for that perhaps I might have saved more even than I did. I went\r\non in this way, as I said before, for 15 years, and no one could have\r\nbeen happier than I was--not a working man in all England couldn’t. I\r\nhad my silver watch and chain. I could lay out my trifle every week\r\nin a few books, and used to have a trip now and then up and down the\r\nriver, just to blow the London smoke off, you know. About 15 years ago\r\nmy eyes began to fail me without any pain at all; they got to have as\r\nit were a thick mist, like smoke, before them. I couldn’t see anything\r\nclear. Working by gas-light at first weakened and at last destroyed the\r\nnerve altogether. I’m now in total darkness. I can only tell when the\r\ngas is lighted by the heat of it.\r\n\r\n“It is not the black clothes that is trying to the sight--black is\r\nthe steadiest of all colours to work at; white and all bright colours\r\nmakes the eyes water after looking at ’em for any long time; but of all\r\ncolours scarlet, such as is used for regimentals, is the most blinding,\r\nit seems to burn the eyeballs, and makes them ache dreadful. After\r\nworking at red there’s always flying colours before the eyes; there’s\r\nno steady colour to be seen in anything for some time. Everything\r\nseems all of a twitter, and to keep changing its tint. There’s more\r\nmilitary tailors blind than any others. A great number of tailors go\r\nblind, but a great many more has lost their sight since gas-light\r\nhas come up. Candle-light was not half so pernicious to the sight.\r\nGas-light is so very heating, and there’s such a glare with it that it\r\nmakes the eyes throb, and shoot too, if you work long by it. I’ve often\r\ncontinued working past midnight with no other light than that, and\r\nthen my eyes used to feel like two bits of burning coals in my head.\r\nAnd you see, sir, the worst of it was, as I found my sight going bad\r\nI was obliged to try it more, so as to keep up with my mates in the\r\nshop. At last my eyes got so weak that I was compelled to give up work,\r\nand go into the country, and there I stopped, living on my savings,\r\nand unable to do any work for fear of losing my sight altogether. I\r\nwas away about three years, and then all my money was gone, and I was\r\nobligated, in spite of my eyes, to go back to work again. But then,\r\nwith my sight defective as it was, I could get no employment at the\r\nhonourable trade, and so I had to take a seat in a shop at one of the\r\ncheap houses in the city, and that was the ruin of me entirely; for\r\nworking there, of course I got “scratched” from the trade Society, and\r\nso lost all hope of being provided for by them in my helplessness. The\r\nworkshop at this cheap house was both small and badly ventilated. It\r\nwas about seven foot square, and so low, that as you sot on the floor\r\nyou could touch the ceiling with the tip of your finger. In this place\r\nseven of us worked--three on each side and one in the middle. Two of\r\nmy shopmates were boys, or else I am sure it would not have held us\r\nall. There was no chimney, nor no window that could be opened to let\r\nthe air in. It was lighted by a skylight, and this would neither open\r\nnor shut. The only means for letting out the foul air was one of them\r\nworking ventilators--like cockades, you know, sir--fixed in one of the\r\npanes of glass; but this wouldn’t work, so there we were, often from\r\n5 in the morning till 10 at night, working in this dreadful place.\r\nThere was no fire in the winter, though we never needed one, for the\r\nworkshop was over-hot from the suffocation, and in the summer it was\r\nlike an oven. This is what it was in the daytime, but mortal tongue\r\ncan’t tell what it was at night, with the two gas-lights burning away,\r\nand almost stifling us. Many a time some of the men has been carried\r\nout by the others fainting for air. They all fell ill, every one of\r\nthem, and I lost my eyes and my living entirely by it. We spoke to the\r\nmaster repeatedly, telling him he was killing us, and though when he\r\ncame up to the workshop hisself, he was nearly blown back by the stench\r\nand heat, he would not let us have any other room to work in--and yet\r\nhe’d plenty of convenience up stairs. He paid little more than half the\r\nregular wages, and employed such men as myself--only those who couldn’t\r\nget anything better to do. What with illness and all, I don’t think\r\nmy wages there averaged above 12_s._ a week: sometimes I could make\r\n1_l._ in the week, but then, the next week, maybe I’d be ill, and would\r\nget but a few shillings. It was impossible to save anything then--even\r\nto pay one’s way was a difficulty, and, at last, I was seized with\r\nrheumatics on the brain, and obliged to go into St. Thomas’s Hospital.\r\nI was there eleven months, and _came out stone blind_. I am convinced I\r\nlost my eyesight by working in that cheap shop; nothing on earth will\r\never persuade me to the contrary, and what’s more, my master robbed me\r\nof a third of my wages and my sight too, and left me helpless in the\r\nworld, as, God knows, I am now. It is by the ruin of such men as me\r\nthat these masters are enabled to undersell the better shops; they get\r\nhold of the men whose eyes are just beginning to fail them, like mine\r\ndid, because they know they can get them to work cheap, and then, just\r\nat the time when a journeyman requires to be in the best of shops, have\r\nthe best of air, and to work as little by gas-light as possible, they\r\nputs him into a hole of a place that would stifle a rat, and keeps him\r\nworking there half the night through. That’s the way, sir, the cheap\r\nclothes is produced, by making blind beggars of the workmen, like\r\nmyself, and throwing us on the parish in our old age. You are right,\r\nsir, they not only robs the men but the ratepayers too.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, as I said, I come out of the hospital stone blind, and\r\nhave been in darkness ever since, and that’s near upon ten years ago.\r\nI often dream of colours, and see the most delightful pictures in the\r\nworld; nothing that I ever beheld with my eyes can equal them--they’re\r\nso brilliant, and clear and beautiful. I see then the features and\r\nfigures of all my old friends, and I can’t tell you how pleasureable\r\nit is to me. When I have such dreams they so excite me that I am ill\r\nall the next day. I often see, too, the fields, with the cows grazing\r\non a beautiful green pasture, and the flowers, just at twilight like,\r\nclosing up their blossoms as they do. I never dream of rivers; nor do\r\nI ever remember seeing a field of corn in my visions; it’s strange I\r\nnever dreamt in any shape of the corn or the rivers, but maybe I didn’t\r\ntake so much notice of them as of the others. Sometimes I see the\r\nsky, and very often indeed there’s a rainbow in it, with all kinds of\r\nbeautiful colours. The sun is a thing I often dream about seeing, going\r\ndown like a ball of fire at the close of the day. I never dreamt of the\r\nstars, nor the moon--it’s mostly bright colours that I see.\r\n\r\n“I have been under all the oculists I could hear of--Mr. Turnbull, in\r\nRussell-square, but he did me no good; then I went to Charing-cross,\r\nunder Mr. Guthrie, and he gave me a blind certificate, and made me a\r\npresent of half-a-sovereign; he told me not to have my eyes tampered\r\nwith again, as the optic nerve was totally decayed. Oh, yes; if I had\r\nall the riches in the world I’d give them every one to get my sight\r\nback, for it’s the greatest pressure to me to be in darkness. God help\r\nme! I know I am a sinner, and believe I’m so afflicted on account of\r\nmy sins. No, sir, it’s nothing like when you shut your eyes; when I\r\nhad my sight, and closed mine, I remember I could still see the light\r\nthrough the lids, the very same as when you hold your hand up before\r\nthe candle; but mine’s far darker than that--pitch black. I see a dark\r\nmass like before me, and never any change--everlasting darkness, and\r\nno chance of a light or shade in this world. But I feel consolated\r\nsome how, now it is settled; although it’s a very poor comfort after\r\nall. I go along the streets in great fear. If a baby have hold of me,\r\nI am firm, but by myself, I reel about like a drunken man. I feel\r\nvery timid unless I have hold of something--not to support me, but to\r\nassure me I shall not fall. If I was going down your staircase, sir,\r\nI should be all right so long as I touched the bannister, but if I\r\nmissed that, I’m sure I should grow so giddy and nervous I should fall\r\nfrom the top to the bottom. After losing my sight, I found a great\r\ndifficulty in putting my food into my mouth, for a long time--six\r\nmonths or better--and I was obliged to have some one to guide my hand,\r\nfor I used often to put the fork up to my forehead instead of my mouth.\r\nShortly after my becoming quite blind, I found all my other senses much\r\nquickened--my hearing--feeling--and reckoning. I got to like music very\r\nmuch indeed; it seemed to elevate me--to animate and cheer me much more\r\nthan it did before, and so much so now, that when it ceases, I feel\r\nduller than ever. It sounds as if it was in a wilderness to me--I can’t\r\ntell why, but that’s all I can compare it to; as if I was quite alone\r\nwith it. My smell and taste is very acute” (he was given some violets\r\nto smell)--“Oh, that’s beautiful,” he cried, “very reviving indeed.\r\nOften of an evening, I can see things in my imagination, and that’s\r\nwhy I like to sit alone then; for of all the beautiful thoughts that\r\never a man possessed, there’s none to equal a blind man’s, when he’s by\r\nhisself.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see my early home, but occurrences that has recently took\r\nplace. I see them all plain before me, in colours as vivid as if I\r\nhad my sight again, and the people all dressed in the fashion of my\r\ntime; the clothes seem to make a great impression on me, and I often\r\nsit and see in my mind master tailors trying a coat on a gentleman,\r\nand pulling it here and there. The figures keep passing before me like\r\nsoldiers, and often I’m so took by them that I forget I’m blind, and\r\nturn my head round to look after them as they pass by me. But that\r\nsort of thinking would throw me into a melancholly--it’s too exciting\r\nwhile it lasts, and then leaves me dreadful dull afterwards. I have\r\ngot much more melancholy since my blindness; before then, I was not\r\nseriously given, but now I find great consolation in religion. I think\r\nmy blindness is sent to try my patience and resignation, and I pray\r\nto the Almighty to give me strength to bear with my affliction. I was\r\nquick and hot-tempered before I was blind, but since then, I have got\r\nless hasty like; all other troubles appears nothing to me. Sometimes\r\nI revile against my affliction--too frequently--but that is at my\r\nthoughtless moments, for when I’m calm and serious, I feel thankful\r\nthat the Almighty has touched me with his correcting rod, and then\r\nI’m happy and at peace with all the world. If I had run my race, and\r\nnot been stopped, I might never have believed there was a God. My wife\r\nworks at the ‘sank work.’ She makes soldiers’ coats; she gets 1_s._\r\n1_d._ for making one, and that’s nearly a day and a half’s work; then\r\nshe has to find her own trimmings, and they’re 1_d._ It takes her 16\r\nhours to finish one garment, and the over-work at that is beginning to\r\nmake her like as I was myself. If she takes up a book to read to me\r\nnow, it’s all like a dirty mass before her, and that’s just as my sight\r\nwas before I lost it altogether. She slaves hard to help me; she’s\r\nanxious and willing--indeed too much so. If she could get constant\r\nwork, she might perhaps make about 7_s._ a week; but as it is, her\r\nearnings are, take one week with another, not more than 3_s._ Last week\r\nshe earned 5_s._; but that was the first job of work she’d had to do\r\nfor two months. I think the two of us make on an average about 8_s._;\r\nand out of that there is three people to keep--our two selves and our\r\nboy. Our rent is 2_s._ 6_d._, so that after paying that, we has about\r\n5_s._ 6_d._ left for food, firing, and clothing for the whole of us.\r\nHow we do it I can’t tell; but I know we live very, very hard: mostly\r\non pieces of bread that the men gives to me and my boy, as we go round\r\nto the workshops. If we was any of us to fall ill, we must all go to\r\nthe parish; if my boy was to go sick, I should be left without any one\r\nto lead me about, and that would be as bad as if I was laid-up myself;\r\nand if anything was to happen to my wife, I’d be done clean altogether.\r\nBut yet the Lord is very good, and we’d get out of that, I dare say.\r\nIf anything was to drive me to the parish, I should lose all hopes\r\nof getting some help from the blind institutions; and so I dread the\r\nworkhouse worse than all. I’d sooner die on the step of a door, any\r\ntime, than go there and be what they call well kept. I don’t know why\r\nI should have a dislike to going there, but yet I do possess it. I do\r\nbelieve, that any one that is willing to work for their bread, hates\r\na workhouse; for the workhouse coat is a slothful, degrading badge.\r\nAfter a man has had one on his back, he’s never the same. I would’nt\r\ngo for an order for relief so long as I could get a halfpenny loaf in\r\ntwenty-four hours. If I could only get some friend to give me a letter\r\nof recommendation to Mr. Day’s Charity for the Blind, I should be happy\r\nfor the rest of my days. I could give the best of references to any one\r\nwho would take pity on me in my affliction.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC-HOUSE HAWKERS OF METAL SPOONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe public-house hawkers are never so prosperous as those who confine\r\ntheir calling to private houses; they are often invited to partake\r\nof drink; are not the most industrious class of hawkers, and, to use\r\ntheir own language, are more frequently _hard up_ than those who\r\nkeep away from tap-room selling. The profits of the small hawkers in\r\npublic-houses vary considerably. Some of them, when they have earned\r\na shilling or two, are content to spend it before they leave the\r\ntap-room, and so they lose both their stock and profit. I do not mean\r\nto infer that this is the case with the whole of the public-house\r\nhawkers, for some among them strive hard to better their condition,\r\nand occasionally succeed; but there are too many who are content to\r\ndrawl out their existence by always suffering to-morrow to provide for\r\nitself. The man who gave me the routine of small hawkers’ business I\r\nfound in a tap-room in Ratcliffe Highway. He was hawking tea-spoons,\r\nand all the stock he possessed was half-a-dozen. These he importuned\r\nme to purchase with great earnestness. He prayed of me to lay out a\r\ntrifle with him. He had not taken a penny the whole day he said, and\r\nhad nothing to eat. “What’s much worse for such as me,” he added,\r\n“I’m dying for a glass of rum.” I might have his tea-spoons, he told\r\nme, at any price. If I would but pay for a glass of rum for him they\r\nshould be mine. I assured him some bread and cheese would do him more\r\ngood, as he had not eaten anything that day; but still he _would_ have\r\nthe rum. With a trembling hand he threw the liquor down his throat,\r\nsmacked his lips, and said “that there dram has saved my life.” A few\r\nminutes afterwards he sold his spoons to a customer for sixpence; and\r\nhe had another glass of rum. “_Now_,” said he, “I’m all right for\r\nbusiness; if I’d twopence more I could buy a dozen tea-spoons, and I\r\nshould earn a ‘bob’ or two yet before I went to bed.” After this he\r\ngrew communicative, and told me he was as good a hawker as there was\r\nin London, and he thought he could do more than any other man with a\r\nsmall stock. He had two or three times resolved to better himself,\r\nand had ‘_put in the pin_,’ meaning he had made a vow to refrain from\r\ndrinking; but he had broken out again and gone on in his old course\r\nuntil he had melted the whole of his stock, though twice it had, during\r\nhis sobriety, amounted to 5_l._, and was often worth between 2_l._ and\r\n3_l._ It was almost maddening when he came to his senses, he said, to\r\nfind he had acted so foolishly; indeed, it was so disheartening to\r\ndiscover all the result of his good resolutions dissipated in a moment,\r\nthat he declared he never intended to try again. After having drunk out\r\nhis stock, he would if possible commence with half-a-dozen Britannia\r\nmetal tea-spoons; these cost him 6_d._, and would sell for 9_d._ or\r\n1_s._ When one half-dozen were disposed of he would procure another,\r\nadding a knife, or a comb or two. If entirely destitute, he would stick\r\na needle in a cork, and request to know of “the parties” assembled in\r\nsome tap-room, if they wanted anything in the ironmongery line, though\r\nthe needle was all the stock he had. This was done for the purpose of\r\n“raising the wind;” and by it he would be sure to obtain a glass or two\r\nof ale if he introduced himself with his “ironmongery establishment”\r\namong the sailors. Sometimes he would manage to beg a few pence,\r\nand then he would purchase a knife, pair of braces, or half-a-dozen\r\ntea-spoons, and begin to practise his trade in a legitimate manner.\r\nIn answer to my inquiry he said he had not always been a hawker. His\r\nfather had been a soldier, and he had worked in the armoury. His\r\nfather had been discharged upon a pension, and he (the hawker) left\r\nthe army with his parents. He had never enlisted while his father was\r\na soldier, but he had since. His mother adopted the business of a\r\nhawker upon the receipt of his father’s first quarter’s pension; and\r\nthen he used to accompany her on her rounds. With the pension and the\r\nmother’s exertions they managed to subsist tolerably well. “Being the\r\nonly child, I was foolishly spoilt by my parents,” he said; “and when\r\nI was a very young man--15 or 16--I became a great trouble to them.\r\nAt 18 I enlisted in the 7th Fusileers, remained in the regiment three\r\nmonths, and then, at my own request, was bought off. My mother sold off\r\nmost of her stock of goods to raise the money (twenty pounds). When I\r\nreturned home I could not think of trudging by my mother’s side, as I\r\nhad been used to do when carrying the goods; nor did I feel inclined to\r\nexert myself in any way for my own support. I considered my mother had\r\na right to keep me without my working, and she, poor thing, thought so\r\ntoo. I was not only supported in idleness, but my mother would give me\r\nmany a shilling, though she could ill afford it, for me to spend with\r\nmy companions. I passed most of my time in a skittle ground. I was not\r\nwhat you might term a skittle sharp, for I never entered into a plot\r\nto victimise any person, although I confess I have often bet upon the\r\n‘greenness’ of those who were silly enough to make wagers that they\r\ncould not possibly win. Sometimes, after I had lost the trifle supplied\r\nme by my mother, I would return, and be blackguard enough to assume the\r\nbully unless my demands on her for a further supply were attended to.\r\nPoor thing, she was very meek, and with tears in her eyes she would\r\ngrant my request. I often weep when I think how I treated her” (here\r\nthe tears trickled down the man’s cheek), “and yet, badly as I used\r\nher, in my heart I loved her very much. I got tired of the skittle\r\ngrounds in consequence of getting into a hobble relative to a skittle\r\nswindle: some sharpers had obtained a flat; I was speculating in a\r\nsmall way, betting pennies and twopences in such a manner as always to\r\nwin; I was practising upon the flat upon my own account, without having\r\nany connection with the others; they fleeced their dupe out of several\r\npounds, and he made a row about it. The police interfered, and I was\r\nsingled out as one of the gang; the principals were also apprehended;\r\nthey got six months each, and I was accommodated with a month’s board\r\nand lodging at the expense of the nation. I thought this at the time\r\nunjust, but I was as culpable as any of them, for at the time I only\r\nregretted I had not more money to stake larger wagers, and envied the\r\nother parties who were making a better thing of the business than I\r\nwas. When I came out of jail, my poor mother treated me as a martyr.\r\nShe thought I was as innocent as a child. Shortly after my release from\r\nprison my father died, and with him went the pension of course. I was\r\nthen obligated to do something for myself. A few shillings’ worth of\r\ngoods only were procured--for my father’s funeral and my extravagances\r\nhad sadly crippled my mother’s means. I behaved very well for a short\r\ntime. My mother then was often ill, and she never recovered the death\r\nof my father. In about a year after my father died I lost my mother;\r\nour stock of goods had dwindled down to a very poor lot, and I was\r\nobligated to ask relief of the parish towards her funeral expenses.\r\nWhen all was over, the value of my goods and cash did not amount to\r\n20_s._ Ten years have elapsed since my mother’s death, and I don’t\r\nthink I have ever been, during the whole period, sober for a month\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nWhile I sat in this tap-room, I counted in the course of an hour and\r\na quarter,--4 hawkers of sheep’s trotters, who visited the place;\r\n3 sellers of shrimps, pickled whelks, and periwinkles; 2 baked\r\npotato-sellers; 8 song-hawkers; the same number with lucifer matches;\r\nand 3 with braces, &c. Not one of these effected a sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF JEWELLERY.\r\n\r\nThe jewellery now sold in the streets far exceeds, both in cheapness\r\nand quality, what was known even ten years ago. Fifty years ago the\r\njewellery itinerant trade was almost entirely, if not entirely, in the\r\nhands of Jews, who at any rate professed to sell really gold articles,\r\nand who asked large prices; but these traders have lost their command\r\nover this, as I have shown that they have over other street callings,\r\nas not a twelfth of the street-jewellers are now Jews. A common trade\r\namong such street and country itinerant jewellers was in large watch\r\nseals, the bodies of which were of lead, more or less thickly plated\r\nwith gold, and which were unsaleable even as old metal until broken\r\nto pieces,--but not always saleable then. The street or itinerant\r\ntrade was for a long time afterwards carried on only by those who were\r\nregularly licensed as hawkers, and who preferred “barter” or “swopping”\r\nto actual sale, the barter being usually for other and more solid\r\narticles of the goldsmith’s trade.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of “mosaic” and other cheap modes of manufacturing\r\n_quasi_ gold ornaments, brought about considerable changes in the\r\ntrade, pertaining, however, more to the general manufacture, than to\r\nthat prepared for the streets.\r\n\r\nThe itinerants usually carry their wares in boxes or cases, which\r\nshut up close, and can be slung on the shoulder for conveyance, or\r\nhung round the neck for the purposes of sale. These cases are nearly\r\nall glazed; within them the jewellery is disposed in such manner as,\r\nin the street-seller’s judgment, is the most attractive. A card of\r\nthe larger brooches, or of cameos, often forms the centre, and the\r\nother space is occupied with the shawl-pins, with their globular tops\r\nof scarlet or other coloured glass: rings, armlets, necklaces, a few\r\nearrings and ear-drops, and sometimes a few side-combs, small medals\r\nfor keepsakes, clasps, beads, and bead-purses, ornamental buttons for\r\ndresses, gilt buckles for waist-belts, thimbles, &c., constitute the\r\nstreet jeweller’s stock-in-trade. The usual prices are from 2_d._\r\nto 1_s._ 6_d._; the price most frequently obtained for any article\r\nbeing 3_d._ It will be seen from the enumeration of the articles,\r\nthat the stock is such as is required “for women’s wear,” and women\r\nare now almost the sole customers of the street-jewellers. “In my\r\ntime, sir,” said one elderly street-trader, “or rather, when I was a\r\nboy, and in my uncle’s time--for he was in jewellery, and I helped\r\nhim at times--quite different sorts of jewellery was sold, and quite\r\ndifferent prices was had; what’s a high figure now was a low figure\r\nthen. I’ve known children’s coral and bells in my uncle’s stock--well,\r\nI don’t know whether it was real coral or not--and big watch keys with\r\ncoloured stones in the centre on ’em, such as I’ve seen old gents keep\r\nspinning round when they was talking, and big seals and watch-chains;\r\nthere weren’t no guards then, as I remember. And there was plated\r\nfruit-knives--silver, as near as a toucher--and silver pencils\r\n(pencil-cases), and gilt lockets, to give your sweetheart your hair in\r\nfor keepsakes. Lor’ bless you! times is turned upside down.”\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the street-stalls is somewhat after the same fashion\r\nas that in the itinerant’s box, with the advantage of a greater command\r\nof space. Some of the stalls--one in Tottenham-court Road, I may\r\ninstance, and another in Whitechapel--make a great show.\r\n\r\nI did not hear of any in this branch of the jewellery trade who had\r\nbeen connected with it as working jewellers. I heard of two journeymen\r\nwatchmakers and four clockmakers now selling jewellery (but often with\r\nother things, such as eye-glasses) in the street, but that is all.\r\nThe street mass selling jewellery in town and country are, I believe,\r\ncomposed of the various classes who constitute the street-traders\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nOf the nature of his present trade, and of the class of his customers,\r\nI had the following account from a man of twelve years’ experience in\r\nthe vending of street jewellery:--\r\n\r\n“It’s not very easy to tell, sir,” he said, “what sells best, for\r\npeople begins to suspect everything, and seems to think they’re done\r\nif they give 3_d._ for an agate brooch, and finds out it ain’t set\r\nin gold. I think agate is about the best part of the trade now. It\r\nseems a stone as is easy imitated. Cornelians, too, ain’t so bad in\r\nbrooches--people likes the colour; but not what they was, and not up to\r\nagates. But nothing is up to what it once was; not in the least. Sell\r\ntwice as much--when you can, which often stands over till to-morrow\r\ncome-never--and get half the profit. I don’t expect very much from\r\nthe Great Exhibition. They sends goods so cheap from Germany, they’ll\r\nthink anything dear in London, if it’s only at German prices. I\r\nthink it’s a mistake to fancy that the cheaper a jewellery article\r\nis the more you’ll sell of it. You won’t. People’s of opinion--at\r\nleast that’s my notion of it--that it’s so common everybody’ll have\r\nit, and so they won’t touch it. It’s Thames water, sir, against\r\nbeer, is poor low-priced jewellery, against tidy and fair-priced;\r\nbut then the low-priced has now ruined the other sorts, for they’re\r\nall thought to go under the same umbrella,--all of a sort; 1_s._ or\r\n1_d._ Why, as to who’s the best customers, that depends on where you\r\npitches your pitch, or works your round, and whether you are known,\r\nor are merely a upstart. But I can tell you, sir, who’s been my best\r\ncustomers--and is yet, but not so good as they was--and that’s women\r\nof the town; and mostly (for I’ve tried most places) about Ratcliff\r\nHighway, Whitechapel, Mile-end-road, Bethnal-green, and Oxford-street.\r\nThe sailors’ gals is the best of all; but a’most all of them is very\r\nparticular, and some is uncommon tiresome. ‘I’m afeard,’ they says,\r\n‘this colour don’t suit my complexion; it’s too light, or it’s too\r\ndark. How does that ring show on my finger?’ I’ve known some of the\r\nfat and fair ones--what had been younger, but would be older--say,\r\n‘Let me have a necklace of bright black beads;’ them things shows best\r\nwith the fat ’uns--but in gen’ral them poor creatures is bad judges of\r\nwhat becomes them. The things they’re the most particular of all in is\r\nnecklaces. Amber and pearl sells most. I have them from 6_d._ to 1_s._\r\n6_d._ I never get more than 1_s._ 6_d._ Cornelian necklaces is most\r\nliked by children, and most bought for them. I’ve trusted the women\r\nof the town, and trust them still. One young woman in Shadwell took a\r\nfancy the t’other week for a pearl necklace, ‘it became her so,’ which\r\nit didn’t; and offered to pay me 6_d._ a week for it if I wouldn’t sell\r\nit away from her. The first week she paid 6_d._; the second nothing;\r\nand next week the full tip, ’cause her Jack had come home. I never\r\nlost a halfpenny by the women. Yes, they pays you a fairish price, but\r\nnothing more. Sometimes they’ve beat me down 1_d._, and has said, ‘It’s\r\nall the money I has.’\r\n\r\n“It’s not very long ago that one of them offered me a fine goold watch\r\nwhich I could have bought at any price, for I saw she knew nothing of\r\nwhat it was worth. I never do anything that way. I believe a very few\r\nin my line does, for they can’t give the prices the rich fences can.\r\nIt’s common enough for them gals to ask any street-jeweller they knows\r\nhow much a watch ought to pop for, or to sell for, afore they tries it\r\non. But it isn’t they as tries it on, sir; they gets some respeckbel\r\nold lady, or old gent, to do that for them. I’ve had cigars and\r\nCavendish of them; such as seamen had left behind them; you know, sir,\r\nI’ve never given money, only jewellery for it. Plenty of shopkeepers is\r\nglad to buy it of me, and not at a bad price. They asks no questions,\r\nand I tells them no lies. One reason why these gals buys free is that\r\nwhen the jewellery gets out of order or out of fashion, they can fling\r\nit away and get fresh, it’s so cheap. When I’ve had no money on a day\r\nuntil I has sold to these women, I’ve oft enough said, ‘God bless ’em!’\r\nEarrings is hardly any go now, sir; nothing to what they was; they’re\r\ngoing out. The penny jewellery’s little good; it’s only children what\r\nbuys, or gets it bought for them. I sell most of brooches from 3_d._\r\nto 6_d._, very seldom higher, and bracelets--they calls them armlets\r\nnow--at the same price. I buys all my goods at a swag-shop: there’s no\r\nother market. Watchguards was middling sale, both silver and goold,\r\nor washed white and washed yellow, and the swags made money in them;\r\nbut instead of 1_s._, they’re not to be sold at a Joey now, watchguards\r\nain’t, if a man patters ever so.”\r\n\r\nI am informed that there are not less than 1000 individuals who all buy\r\ntheir jewellery at the London swag-shops, and sell it in the streets,\r\nwith or without other articles, but principally without; and that of\r\nthis number 500 are generally in London and its suburbs, including such\r\nplaces as Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich. Of these traders about\r\none-tenth are women; and in town about three-fifths are itinerant, and\r\nthe others stationary. One-half, or thereabouts, of the women, are\r\nthe wives of street-sellers; the others trade on their own account. A\r\nfew “swop” jewellery for old clothes, with either the mistress or the\r\nmaids. Four or five, when they see a favourable opportunity, offer to\r\ntell any servant-maid her fortune. “‘Buy this beautiful agate brooch,\r\nmy dear,’ the woman’ll say, ‘and I’ll only charge you 1_s._ 6_d._’--a\r\nGerman thing, sir, costing her seven farthings one street-jeweller\r\ninformed me,--‘and I’ll tell you your fortune into the bargain.’”\r\n\r\nOne “old hand” calculated, that when a street-jeweller could display\r\n50_s._ worth of stock, he could clear, all the year round, 15_s._ a\r\nweek. “People,” said this man, “as far as I’ve known the streets, like\r\nto buy of what they think is a respectable man, and seemingly well\r\nto do; they feel safe with him.” Those, however, who cannot boast so\r\nlarge a stock of jewellery as 50_s._ worth, may only clear 10_s._\r\ninstead of 15_s._ weekly. One trader thought that the average earnings\r\nof his fraternity might be taken at 12_s._ a week; another--and both\r\njudged from their own experience--thought 10_s._ 6_d._ was high enough.\r\nCalculating, then, at a weekly profit of 10_s._ 6_d._, and a receipt of\r\n18_s._ per individual, we find 23,400_l._ expended in the street-trade,\r\nincluding the sales at Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich; where--both\r\nplaces being resorted to by pleasure-seekers and seamen--the trade is\r\nsometimes considerable; watches, which now are almost unknown in a\r\nregular street-trade, there forming an occasional part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PEDLAR-JEWELLERS.\r\n\r\nI have heard a manufacturer of Birmingham jewellery assert, that one\r\npound of copper was sufficient to make 10_l._ worth of jewellery;\r\nconsequently, the material to provide the unmanufactured stock in trade\r\nof a wholesale dealer in Birmingham jewellery, is not over expensive.\r\nIt may be imagined then that the pedlars who hawk jewellery do not\r\ninvest a very great capital in the wares they sell; there are some few,\r\nhowever, who have very valuable stocks of goods, pedlars though they\r\nbe. This trade is principally pursued by Jews, and to a great extent\r\n(especially in a small way) by foreign Jews. The Jews are, I think,\r\nmore attentive to the wants of their poorer brethren than other people;\r\nand instead of supplying them with trifling sums of money, which must\r\nnecessarily soon be expended, they give them small quantities of\r\ngoods, so that they may immediately commence foraging for their own\r\nsupport. Many of these poor Jews, when provided with their stock of\r\nmerchandise, can scarcely speak a word of English, and few of them know\r\nbut little respecting the value of the goods they sell; they always\r\ntake care to ask a good price, leaving plenty of room for abatement.\r\nI heard one observe that they could not easily be taken in by being\r\novercharged, for according what they paid for the article they fixed\r\nthe price upon it. Some of these men, notwithstanding their scanty\r\nknowledge of the trade at starting, have eventually become excellent\r\njudges of jewellery; some of them, moreover, have acquired riches\r\nin it; indeed from the indomitable perseverance of the Hebrew race,\r\nsuccess is generally the result of their untiring industry. If once you\r\nlook at the goods of a Jew pedlar, it is not an easy matter to get out\r\nof his clutches; it is not for want of perseverance if he does not bore\r\nand tease you, until at length you are glad to purchase some trifle\r\nto get rid of him. One of my informants tells me he is acquainted\r\nwith several Jews, who now hold their heads high as merchants, and\r\nare considered very excellent judges of the wares they deal in, who\r\noriginally began trading with but a small stock of jewellery, and that\r\na charitable donation. As well as Jews there are Irishmen who deal in\r\nsuch commodities. The pedlar generally has a mahogany box bound with\r\nbrass, and which he carries with a strap hung across his shoulder; when\r\nhe calls at a house, an inquiry is made whether there is any old silver\r\nor gold to dispose of. “I will give you a full price for any such\r\narticles.” If the lady or gentleman accosted seems to be likely to buy,\r\nthe box is immediately opened and a tempting display of gold rings,\r\nchains, scent-boxes, lockets, brooches, breast-pins, bracelets, silver\r\nthimbles, &c., &c., are exposed to view. All the eloquence the pedlar\r\ncan command is now brought into play. The jewellery is arranged about\r\nthe persons of his expected customers to the best advantage. The pedlar\r\nsays all he can think of to enhance their sale: he will chop and change\r\nfor anything they may wish to dispose of--any old clothes, books, or\r\nuseless lumber may be converted into ornaments for the hair or other\r\nparts of dress. The Irish pedlar mostly confines his visits to the\r\nvicinity of large factories where there are many girls employed; these\r\nhe supplies with earrings, necklaces, shawl-pins, brooches, lockets,\r\n&c., which are bought wholesale at the following prices:--Earrings and\r\ndrops at from 3_s._ 6_d._ to 12_s._ per dozen pairs; the 3_d._ earring\r\nis a neat little article says my informant, and those sold at 1_s._\r\neach, wholesale, are gorgeous-looking affairs; many of the latter have\r\nbeen disposed of by the pedlars at 1_l._ the pair, and even a greater\r\nprice. Necklaces are from 5_s._ to 1_l._ per dozen. Lockets may be\r\npurchased wholesale at from 2_s._ to 10_s._ per dozen; guard chains\r\n(German silver) are 4_s._ per dozen; gilt heavy-looking waistcoat\r\nchains 6_s._ per dozen: and all other articles are equally low in\r\nprice. The pedlar jeweller can begin business “respectably” for two\r\npounds. His box costs him 7_s._ 6_d._; half-a-dozen pairs of earrings\r\nof six different sorts, 3_s._; half-a-dozen lockets (various), 1_s._\r\n9_d._; half-a-dozen guard chains, 2_s._; half-a-dozen shawl brooches,\r\n2_s._ 6_d._; one dozen breast-pins (different kinds), 3_s._; one\r\ndozen finger rings of various descriptions, 3_s._ 6_d._; half-a-dozen\r\nbrooches at 4_d._ each, 2_s._; one dozen necklaces (a variety), at\r\n6_s._; three silver pencil-cases at 1_s._ 9_d._ each, 5_s._ 3_d._;\r\nhalf-a-dozen waistcoat chains, 3_s._; one silver toothpick, at 1_s._\r\n6_d._ These make altogether two pounds. If the articles are arranged\r\nwith taste and seeming care (as if they were very valuable), with\r\njeweller’s wadding under each, and stuck on pink cards, &c., while\r\nthe finger rings are inserted in the long narrow velvet-lined groove\r\nof the box, and the other “valuables” well spread about the little\r\nportable shop--they may be made to assume a very respectable and almost\r\n“rich” appearance. Many who now have large establishments commenced\r\nlife with much less stock than is here mentioned. The Jews, I do not\r\nthink, continues my informant, are the best salesmen; and the fact of\r\ntheir being Israelites is, in many instances, a bar to their success;\r\ncountry people, especially, are afraid of being taken in by them. The\r\nimportunities and appeals of the Hebrew, however, are far more urgent\r\nthan any other tradesman; and they always wait where they think there’s\r\nthe slightest chance of effecting a sale, until the door is slammed\r\nin their face. I believe there are not, at the present time, many\r\n(especially small traders) who deal exclusively in jewellery; they\r\nmostly add other small and light articles--such as fancy cutlery, side\r\ncombs, &c. There may, at a rough guess, be 500 of them travelling the\r\ncountry; half the number are poor foreign Jews; a quarter are Jews, who\r\nhave, perhaps, followed the same calling for years; and the remaining\r\nquarter, a mixture of Irish and English, with a small preponderance\r\nof Irishmen. All these “swop” their goods for old gold and silver,\r\nand frequently realize a large sum, by changing the base metal for\r\nthe sterling article. Their goods are always sold as being gold or\r\nsilver--If asked whether a particular article be gold, they reply “It’s\r\njewellers’ gold;” “Is this ring gold?” inquires the customer, taking\r\none from the box--“No, ma’am, I wouldn’t deceive you!” is the answer,\r\n“_that_ is not gold; but here is one,” adds the pedlar (taking up one\r\nexactly of the same description, and which cost the same price) “which\r\nis of a similar shape and fashion, and the best jeweller’s gold that\r\nis made.” The profits of the pedlar-jewellers it is almost impossible\r\nto calculate, for they will sell at any price upon which the smallest\r\namount of profit can be realized. The foreign Jews, especially, will do\r\nthis, and it is not an unusual circumstance for one of these men to ask\r\n5_s._ for an article which originally cost them 3_d._, and which they\r\nwill eventually sell for 4_d._\r\n\r\nIn London there are about 200 hawkers of jewellery, who visit the\r\npublic-houses; but few of these have boxes--they invite customers by\r\ndisplaying some chains in their hands, or having one or two arranged\r\nin front of their waistcoats, while the smaller articles are carried\r\nin their waistcoat pockets. The class of persons who patronize the\r\npublic-house hawkers are those who visit the tap-rooms of taverns, and\r\ncountrymen in the vicinity of Smithfield upon market days, (one of the\r\nhawkers tells me, that they succeed better upon the hay-market days\r\nthan at the cattle sales, for the butchers, they say, are too “fly” for\r\nthem). Sailors are among their best customers, but the coster-girls\r\nare very fond of drop earrings and coral beads; the sailors, however,\r\ngive the best prices of all. I am told that the quantity of old gold\r\nand silver which the country pedlars obtain in exchange for their goods\r\nis “astonishing;” and there have been occasions on which a pedlar has\r\nbeen enriched for life by one single transaction of barter; some old\r\nand unfashionable piece of jewellery, that they received for their\r\ngoods, has been composed of costly stones, which had lain by for years,\r\nand of which the pedlar’s customer was unacquainted with the value.\r\nThe more respectable jewellery pedlars put up at the better class of\r\npublic-houses, and, even after their day’s travels are over, they\r\nstill have an eye to business; they open the box upon the table of the\r\ntap-room where they are lodging, and, under the pretence of cleaning\r\nor arranging their goods, temptingly display their glittering stock.\r\nThe bar-maid, kitchen-maid, the landlady’s daughter, or perhaps the\r\nlandlady herself, admires some ornaments, which the pedlar declares\r\nwould become them vastly. He hangs a necklace upon the neck of one of\r\nthem; holds a showy earring and drop to the ear of another; facetiously\r\ninquires of the girls whether they are not likely to want something\r\nof this sort shortly--as he holds up first a wedding-ring, and then\r\na baby’s coral; or else he exhibits a ring set with Turquoise, or\r\npearls and small diamonds in a cluster, to the landlady, and tries it\r\non her finger; and by such arts a sale that will cover his expenses\r\nis generally effected. There is one peculiarity these men have when\r\nbartering their goods. A worn-out ornament of jewellery is brought to\r\nthem, and, although it be brass, the pedlar never attempts to undeceive\r\nthe possessor, if he finds it is considered to be genuine. Of course\r\nhe never gives cash for such articles; but he offers a large price in\r\nbarter. “I will take 10_s._ for this ring, and allow you 5_s._ for the\r\nold one,” says the pedlar. It would never do to say the ornament was\r\nnot gold; the customer bought it years ago for such, and no one ever\r\ndisputed its being the precious metal; should our pedlar do so, he\r\nmight as well shut up shop immediately. The lady would be angry and\r\nsuspicious; neither would she believe him, but rather suspect that he\r\nwanted only to cheat her; consequently the pedlar barters, obtains the\r\nold ring, or some other article, and 5_s._, for his commodity; and\r\nthough the article he has taken in exchange is worth only a few pence,\r\nhe very likely profits to the amount of 200 per cent. upon the cash\r\nreceived. The pedlars of lesser consequence put up at humble private\r\nor public-houses, and some of them at the common lodging-houses. Those\r\nwho have only small stocks confine their visits to farm-houses and\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CARD-COUNTERS, MEDALS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe “card-counters,” or, as I have heard them sometimes called by\r\nstreet-sellers, the “small coins,” are now of a very limited sale. The\r\nslang name for these articles is “Jacks” and “Half Jacks.” They are\r\nsold to the street-people at only two places in London; one in Holborn,\r\nand the other at Black Tom’s (himself formerly a street-seller, now “a\r\nsmall swag”), in Clerkenwell. They are all made in Birmingham, and are\r\nof the size and colour of the genuine sovereigns and half sovereigns;\r\nbut it is hardly possible that any one who had ever received a\r\nsovereign in payment, could be deceived by the substitution of a Jack.\r\nThose now sold in the streets are much thinner, and very much lighter.\r\nEach presents a profile of the Queen; but instead of the superscription\r\n“Victoria Dei Gratiâ” of the true sovereign, the Jack has “Victoria\r\nRegina.” On the reverse, in the place of the “Britanniarum Regina Fid.\r\nDef.” surrounding the royal arms and crown, is a device (intended for\r\nan imitation of St. George and the Dragon) representing a soldier on\r\nhorseback--the horse having three legs elevated from the ground, while\r\na drawn sword fills the right hand of the equestrian, and a crown\r\nadorns his head. The superscription is, “to Hanover,” and the rider\r\nseems to be sociably accompanied by a dragon. Round the Queen’s head on\r\nthe half Jack is “Victoria, Queen of Great Britain,” and on the reverse\r\nthe Prince of Wales’s feather, with the legend, “The Prince of Wales’s\r\nModel Half Sovereign.”\r\n\r\nUntil within these five or six years the gilt card-counters had\r\ngenerally the portraiture of the monarch, and on the reverse the legend\r\n“Keep your temper,” as a seasonable admonition to whist players.\r\nOccasionally the card-counter was a gilt coin, closely resembling a\r\nsovereign; but the magistracy, eight or nine years back, “put down” the\r\nsale of these imitations.\r\n\r\nUnder another head will be found an account of the use made of these\r\nsovereigns, in pretended wagers. A further use of them was to add to\r\nthe heaps of apparent gold at the back of the table-keeper in a race\r\nbooth, when gambling was allowed at Epsom, and the “great meetings.”\r\n\r\nThere are now only two men regularly selling Jacks in the streets.\r\nThere have been as many as twelve. One of these street-sellers is often\r\nfound in Holborn, announcing “30_s._ for 1_d._! 30_s._ for 1_d._!\r\ncheapest bargain ever offered; 30_s._ for 1_d._!”\r\n\r\nThe Jacks cost, wholesale, 4_s._ 6_d._ the gross; the half Jacks\r\n2_s._ 9_d._ The two are sold for 1_d._ If the sale be not brisk, the\r\nstreet-seller will give a ring into the bargain. These rings cost 1_s._\r\nthe gross, or the third part of a farthing each.\r\n\r\nIf there be, on the year’s average, only two street-sellers disposing\r\nof the Jacks, and earning 9_s._ a week--to earn which the receipts\r\nwill be about 20_s._--we find 104_l._ expended in the streets on these\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nOf medals the street sale is sometimes considerable, at others a mere\r\nnothing. When a popular subject is before the public, many of the\r\ngeneral patterers “go to medals.” I could not learn that any of the\r\npresent street-people vended medals in the time of the war; I believe\r\nthere are none at present among the street folk who did so. I am told\r\nthat the street sale in war medals was smaller than might reasonably\r\nhave been expected. The manufacture of those articles in the Salamanca,\r\nVittoria, and even Waterloo days, was greatly inferior to what it is at\r\npresent, and the street price demanded was as often 6_d._ as a smaller\r\nsum. These medals in a little time presented a dull, leaden look, and\r\nthe knowledge that they were “poor things” seems to have prevented\r\nthe public buying them to any extent in the streets, and perhaps\r\ndeterred the street-sellers from offering them. Those who were the most\r\nsuccessful of the medal-sellers had been, or assumed to have been,\r\nsoldiers or seamen.\r\n\r\nWithin the last eighteen years, or more, there has hardly been any\r\npublic occurrence without a comparatively well-executed medal being\r\nsold in the streets in commemoration of it. That sold at the opening\r\nof London-bridge was, I am told, considered “a superior thing,” and\r\nthe improvement in this art of manufacture has progressed to the\r\npresent time. Within the last three years the most saleable medals, an\r\nexperienced man told me, were of Hungerford Suspension (bridge), the\r\nNew Houses of Parliament, the Chinese Junk, and Sir Robert Peel. The\r\nThames Tunnel medals were at one time “very tidy,” as were those of the\r\nNew Royal Exchange. The great sale is at present of the Crystal Palace;\r\nand one man had heard that there were a great many persons coming to\r\nLondon to sell them at the opening of the Great Exhibition. “The great\r\neggs and bacon, I call it,” he said; “for I hope it will bring us that\r\nsort of grub. But I don’t know; I’m afraid there’ll be too many of us.\r\nBesides, they say we shan’t be let sell in the park.”\r\n\r\nThe exhibition medal is as follows:--\r\n\r\nWhat the street medal-sellers call the “right-side”--I speak of the\r\n“penny” medal, which commands by far the greatest sale--presents the\r\nCrystal Palace, raised from the surface of the medal, and whitened by\r\nthe application of aqua fortis. The superscription is “THE BUILDING FOR\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, LONDON, 1851.” On the “wrong side” (so\r\ncalled) is the following inscription, occupying the whole face of the\r\nmedal:\r\n\r\n  THE CONSTRUCTION IS OF\r\n  IRON AND OF GLASS,\r\n  1848 FEET LONG.\r\n  ABOUT HALF IS 456 WIDE.\r\n  THE REMAINDER 408 FEET WIDE,\r\n  AND 66 FEET HIGH;\r\n  SITE, UPWARDS OF 20 ACRES.\r\n  COST £150,000.\r\n  JOSH. PAXTON, ARCHT.\r\n\r\nThe size of this medal is between that of a shilling and a half-crown.\r\n\r\nA patterer, who used to sell medals on Sunday mornings in the park,\r\ninformed me that he told his customers the Crystal Palace part was dead\r\nsilver, by a new discovery making silver cheap; but for all that he\r\nwould risk changing it for a four-penny bit!\r\n\r\nThe two-penny medal is after the same style, but the letters are more\r\ndistinct. On my stating, to a medal-seller, that it was difficult to\r\nread the inscription on his “pennies,” he said, “Not at all, sir; but\r\nit’s your eyes is dazzled.” This was said quietly, and with a touch of\r\nslyness, and I have no doubt was the man’s “cut-and-dried” answer.\r\n\r\nThe patterer whom I have mentioned, told me, that encouraged by a\r\ntolerable sale and “a gathering of the aristocrats,” on a very fine\r\nSunday in January or February--he could not remember which--he ventured\r\nupon 6 “sixpenny medals,” costing him 1_s._ 9_d._ He sold them all but\r\none, which he showed me. It was exactly the size of a crown-piece. The\r\nCrystal Palace was “raised,” and of “dead silver,” as in the smaller\r\nmedals. The superscription was the same as on the penny medal; but\r\nunderneath the representation of the palace were raised figures of\r\nMercury and of a naked personage, with a quill as long as himself, a\r\ncornucopia, and a bee-hive: this I presume was Industry. These twin\r\nfigures are supporters to a medallion, crown-surmounted, of the Queen\r\nand Prince Albert: being also in “dead silver.” On the reverse was an\r\ninscription, giving the dimensions, &c., of the building.\r\n\r\nThe medals in demand for street-sale in London seem to be those\r\ncommemorative of local events only. None, for instance, were sold\r\nrelating to the opening of the Britannia Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price of the medals retailed in the street at 1_d._\r\nis 7_s._ the gross; those retailed at 2_d._ are 12_s._ the gross,\r\nbut more than three-fourths of those sold are penny medals. They are\r\nall bought at the swag-shops, and are all made in Birmingham. It is\r\ndifficult to compute how many persons are engaged in this street\r\ntrade, for many resort to it only on occasions. There are, however,\r\nfrom 12 to 20 generally selling medals, and at the present time about\r\n30 are so occupied: they, however, do not sell medals exclusively,\r\nbut along with a few articles of jewellery, or occasionally of such\r\nstreet stationery as letter stamps and “fancy” pens, with coloured\r\nglass or china handles. A fourth of the number are women. The weather\r\ngreatly influences the street medal trade, as rain or damp dims their\r\nbrightness. One seller told me that the day before I saw him he had\r\nsold only four medals. “I’ve known the trade, off and on,” he said,\r\n“for about six years, and the greatest number as ever I sold was\r\nhalf-a-gross one Saturday. I cleared rather better than 3_s._ I sold\r\nthem in Whitehall and by Westminster-bridge. There was nothing new\r\namong them, but I had a good stock, and it was a fine day, and I was\r\nlucky in meeting parties, and had a run for sets.” By a “run for sets,”\r\nmy informant meant that he had met with customers who bought a medal of\r\neach of the kinds he displayed; this is called “a set.”\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man, familiar with the trade, and who was in the habit\r\nof clubbing his stock-money with two others, that they might buy a\r\ngross at a time, calculated that 15 medal sellers were engaged in the\r\ntraffic the year through, and earned, in medals alone, 6_d._ a day\r\neach, to clear which they would take 6_s._ 6_d._ weekly, giving a\r\nyearly outlay of 253_l._ 10_s._ It must be remembered, to account for\r\nthe smallness of the earnings, that the trade in medals is irregular,\r\nand the calculation embraces all the seasons of the trade.\r\n\r\nOn occasions when medals are the sole or chief articles of traffic,\r\nthey are displayed on a tray, which is a box with a lid, and thus look\r\nbright as silver on the faded brown velvet, with which the box is often\r\nlined. Among the favourite pitches are Oxford-street, the approaches\r\nto London, Blackfriars, Westminster, and Waterloo-bridges, the railway\r\nstations, and the City-road.\r\n\r\nOf small coins (proper) there is now no sale in the streets. When\r\nthere was an issue of half-farthings, about seven years ago, the\r\nstreet-sellers drove a brisk trade, in vending them at four a penny,\r\nurging on the sale before the coins got into circulation, which they\r\nnever did. “It’s not often,” said one patterer to me, “that _we_ has\r\nanything to thank the Government for, but we may thank them for the\r\nhalf-farthings. I dare say at least 30 of us made a tidy living on them\r\nfor a week or more; and if they wasn’t coined just to give us a spirt,\r\nI should like to know what they _was_ coined for! I once myself, sir,\r\nfor a lark, gave one to a man that swept a capital crossing, and he was\r\nin a thundering passion, and wanted to fight me, when I told him they\r\nwas coined to pay the likes of him!”\r\n\r\nThere was afterwards a tolerable sale of the “new silver pennies, just\r\nissued from the Mint, three ha’pence each, or 7 for 6_d._;” also of\r\n“genuine models of the new English florin, only 1_d._:” both of these\r\nwere fictitious.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF RINGS AND SOVEREIGNS FOR WAGERS.\r\n\r\nThis class is hardly known in the streets of London at present. Country\r\nfairs and races are a more fitting ground for the ring-seller’s\r\noperations. One man of this class told me that he had been selling\r\nrings, and occasionally medals, for wagers for this last fifteen years.\r\n“It’s only a so-so game just now,” he said; “the people get so fly\r\nto it. A many hold out their penny for a ring, and just as I suppose\r\nI’m a going to receive it, they put the penny into their pockets, and\r\ntheir thumb upon their nose. I wish I had some other game, for this\r\nis a very dickey one. I gives 3_d._ a-dozen for the rings at the swag\r\nshop; and sometimes sells a couple of dozen in a day, but seldom more.\r\nSaturday is no better day than any other. Country people are my best\r\ncustomers. I know them by their appearance. Sometimes a person in the\r\ncrowd whispers to others that he bought one the other day and went and\r\npawned it for 5_s._, and he’d buy another, but he’s got no money. I\r\ndon’t ask for such assistance; I suppose it’s done for a lark, and to\r\nlaugh at others if they buy. Women buy more frequently than any one\r\nelse. Several times since I have been on this dodge, women have come\r\nback and abused me because the ring they bought for a penny was not\r\ngold. Some had been to the pawn shop, and was quite astonished that\r\nthe pawnbroker wouldn’t take the ring in. I do best in the summer at\r\nraces: people think it more likely that two sporting gents would lay\r\nan out of the way wager (as you know I always make out) then than at\r\nany other time. I have been interfered with at races before now for\r\nbeing an impostor, and yet at the same time the gamblers was allowed\r\nto keep their tables; but of course theirs was all fair--no imposition\r\nabout them--oh no! I am considered one of the best patterers among our\r\nlot. I dare say there may be twenty on us all together, in town and\r\ncountry, on rings and sovereigns. Sometimes, when travelling on foot to\r\na race or fair, I do a little in the _Fawney dropping_ line;” (fawneys\r\nare rings;) “but that is a dangerous game, I never did it but two or\r\nthree times. There were some got lagged for it, and that frightened\r\nme. In ring-dropping we pretend to have found a ring, and ask some\r\nsimple-looking fellow if it’s good gold, as it’s only just picked up.\r\nSometimes it is immediately pronounced _gold_: ‘Well it’s no use to\r\nme,’ we’ll say, ‘will you buy it?’ Often they are foolish enough to\r\nbuy, and it’s some satisfaction to one’s conscience to know that they\r\nthink they are a taking you in, for they give you only a shilling or\r\ntwo for an article which if really gold would be worth eight or ten.\r\nSome ring-droppers write out an account and make a little parcel of\r\njewellery, and when they pick out their man, they say, ‘If you please,\r\nsir, will you read this for me, and tell me what I should do with these\r\nthings, as I’ve just found them?’ Some people advise they should be\r\ntaken to the police office--but very few say that; some, that they\r\nshould be taken to the address; others, that they should be sold, and\r\nthe money shared; others offer a price for them, stating that they’re\r\nnot gold, they’re only trumpery they say, but they’ll give half-a-crown\r\nfor them. It’s pleasant to take such people in. Sometimes the finder\r\nsays he’s in haste, and will sell them for anything to attend to other\r\nbusiness, and he then transfers his interest at perhaps 200 per cent.\r\nprofit. This game won’t friz now, sir, it’s very dangerous. I’ve left\r\nit off long since. I don’t like the idea of quod. I’ve been there\r\nonce.” Another plan of dropping rings is to write a letter. This is the\r\nstyle:--\r\n\r\n  “My dear Anne,\r\n\r\n “I have sent you the ring, and hope it will fit.--Excuse me not\r\n bringing it. John will leave it with you.--You know I have so much\r\n to attend to.--I shall think every minute a year until the happy day\r\n arrives.\r\n\r\n  “Yours devotedly,\r\n  “JAMES BROWN.”\r\n\r\nThis love epistle containing the wedding-ring was most successful when\r\nit first came up, but the public now are too wide awake. According to\r\nanother informant, the ring-dropping “lurk” is now carried on this\r\nway, for the old style is “coopered.” “A woman” he says, “is made up\r\nso as to appear in the family-way--pretty far gone--and generally\r\nwith a face as long as a boy’s kite. Up she goes to any likely ken,\r\nwhere she knows there are women that are married or expect to get\r\nmarried, and commences begging. Then comes the tale of woe, if she can\r\nget them to listen--‘I’m in the family-way,’ she says, ‘as you can\r\nplainly see _young ladies_ (this she says to the _servants_, and that\r\nprides them you know). My husband has left me after serving me in this\r\nway. I don’t know where he is, and am forced to solicit the ladies’\r\ncharity.’ Well, the servants will bring broken victuals and make a\r\nlittle collection among themselves for the ‘unprotected female;’ for\r\nwhich in return, with many thanks for their kindness, she offers her\r\ngold wedding-ring for sale, as she wants to get back to her suffering\r\nkids to give them something to eat, poor things, and they shall have\r\nthe gold ring, she says, for half what it’s worth; or if they won’t buy\r\nit, will they lend 2_s._ or 3_s._ on it till she can redeem it, as she\r\nhasn’t been in the habit of pledging! The girls are taken off their\r\nguard (she not being in the habit of pledging is a choker for them) by\r\nthe woman’s seeming simplicity, and there’s a consultation. One says\r\nto the other--‘Oh, you’ll want it, Mary, for John;’ and another, ‘No,\r\nyou’ll want it first, Sally, for William.’ But the woman has her eye\r\non the one as says the least, as the likeliest of all to want it, and\r\nso she says to the John and William girls, ‘Oh, you don’t want it;\r\nbut _here_ (touching the silent one), here’s a _young lady_ as does,’\r\n(that sweetens the servant girl up directly.) She says, ‘I don’t want\r\nit, bless you (with a giggle), but I’ll lend you a trifle, as you\r\nare in this state, and have a family, and are left like this by your\r\nhusband--aint he cruel, Sally (she adds to her fellow-servant)?’ The\r\nmoney the ring-woman gets, sir, depends upon the servant’s funds; if it\r\nis just after quarter-day, she generally gets a tidy tip--if not, 4 or\r\n5 bob. I’ve known one woman get 10_s._ and even 12_s._ this way. The\r\nring is made out of brass gilt buttons, and stunning well: it’s faked\r\nup to rights, and takes a good judge even at this day to detect it\r\nwithout a test.”\r\n\r\n“The best sort of rings for _fawney dropping_ is the Belchers. They are\r\na good thick looking ring, and have the crown and V. R. stamped upon\r\nthem. They are 7_d._ a dozen. I takes my stand now, in my ring-selling,\r\nas if I was in a great hurry, and pulls out my watch. I used to have\r\na real one, but now it’s a dummy. ‘Now, ladies and gentlemen,’ says\r\nI, ‘I am not permitted to remain more than ten minutes in one spot. I\r\nhave rings to sell to decide a wager recently made between two sporting\r\nnoblemen, to the effect that I do not sell a certain quantity of these\r\nrings in a given time, at a penny a piece. I can recommend the article\r\nas being well worth the money I ask for it, perhaps something more. I\r\ndo not say they are gold; in fact, I must not say too much, as there\r\nis a person in this company watching my proceedings, and seeing that\r\nI do not remain more than ten minutes in this spot,’--here I always\r\nlooks very hard at the most respectable and gentlemanly-looking person\r\namong my hearers, and sometimes gives him a wink, and sometimes a\r\nnod,--‘but if you should hear anything more about these rings, and you\r\nwant to purchase, don’t be vexed if I am gone when you want me. The ten\r\nminutes has nearly expired; three minutes more; any more buyers? It\r\nmakes no difference to me whether I sell or not--I get my pay all the\r\nsame; but, if you take my advice, buy; and perhaps if you was to call\r\nat the sign of the Three Balls, as you go home, you may be agreeably\r\nsurprised, and hear something to your advantage. Perhaps I have said\r\ntoo much. I have one minute more, before I close the establishment.\r\nAfter shutting the box, I dare not sell another in this spot, if you\r\nwere to offer me 5_l._ for it; therefore, if you wish to purchase, now\r\nis your time.’ I make many a pitch, and do not sell a single ring; and\r\nthe insults I receive used to aggravate me very much, but I do not mind\r\nthem now, I’m used to it. The flyest cove among all us ring-sellers\r\nis little Ikey, the Jew. There were two used to work the game. They\r\nhad a real gold ring, just like the ones they were selling, and they\r\nalways used to pitch near a pawnbroker’s shop. Ikey’s pal would buy\r\na ring for a penny, of the street-seller, and would then say, loud\r\nenough to be heard by the bystanders, ‘There’s a pawn shop--I’ll go and\r\nask them to take it in.’ A crowd would follow him. He would enter the\r\npawnbroker’s--present a real gold ring--obtain a loan of 5_s._, and\r\nwould present the ticket to the bystanders, who would then buy very\r\nfast. When the pitch was over, Ikey’s pal would take the ring out of\r\npawn, and away the two would go to work near some other pawnbroker’s.\r\nI have heard Ikey say they have pawned the ring thirty-five times in\r\na day. I tried the same caper; but my pal cut with the gold ring the\r\nfirst day, and I’ve never had another go at that _fake_ since.\r\n\r\n“Before I commenced the jewellery line,” continued my candid informant,\r\n“a good many years ago, I used to hold horses about Bond-street.\r\nAfterwards I was taken as an errand boy at a druggist’s, was out of an\r\nerrand one day and got 6_d._ for holding a gentleman’s horse, which\r\nkept me nearly an hour; when I went back to my master’s I was told I\r\nwasn’t wanted any more. I had been cautioned about stopping of errands\r\ntwo or three times before; however I didn’t like the situation, it was\r\ntoo confining. I next got a place as pot-boy, in Brick Lane. Here I\r\nwas out one day gathering in the pots. I hung the strap of pots to a\r\nrailing to have a game at chances (pitch and toss), somebody prigged\r\nmy strap of pots, and I cut. A few weeks after I was grabbed for this,\r\nand got a month at the mill; but I was quite innocent of prigging--I\r\nwas only careless. When I came out of prison, I went to Epsom races,\r\nthinking to get a job there at something or other. A man engaged me to\r\nassist him in ‘pitching the hunters.’ Pitching the hunters is the three\r\nsticks a penny, with the snuffboxes stuck upon sticks; if you throw\r\nyour stick, and they fall out of the hole, you are entitled to what you\r\nknock off. I came to London with my master the pitcher-hunter, he went\r\nto a swag shop in Kent-street, in the Borough, to purchase a new stock.\r\nI saw a man there purchasing rings, this was little Ikey, the Jew;\r\nsome days afterwards I saw him making a pitch, and selling very fast.\r\nI had fourpence in my pocket; went to Kent-street, to the swag shops,\r\nbought a dozen rings, and commenced selling them. I sold that day three\r\ndozen; that wasn’t bad considering that my toggery was very queer, and\r\nI looked anything but like one who would be trusted with ten pounds’\r\nworth of gold rings. This wager between the two sporting noblemen has\r\nbeen a long time settling. I’ve been at it more than fifteen years. The\r\norigin of it was this here: when sovereigns were first coined, the Jew\r\nboys and others used to sell medals and card-counters upon particular\r\noccasions, the same as they do now, and shove them in a saucepan lid,\r\nwith silver paper under them. Captain Barclay, and another of the\r\nsame sort, bet a wager, that one of these Jew-boys could not dispose\r\nof a certain number of real sovereigns in a given time, supposing the\r\nJew-boy cried out nothing more than ‘here’s sovereigns, only a penny a\r\npiece.’ The number he was to sell was 50 within the hour, and to take\r\nhis station at London Bridge. The wager was made, the Jew-boy procured,\r\nand the sovereigns put into the pot lid. ‘Here are real sovereigns\r\na penny a piece, who’ll buy?’ he cried; but he sold only a few. The\r\nnumber disposed of, within the hour, I have heard, was seventeen. Those\r\nwho purchased, when they found that they had really bought sovereigns\r\nat a penny a piece, returned for more, but the salesman was gone. A\r\ngood harvest was afterwards reaped among the Jews, who got up a medal\r\nsomething like a sovereign, and sold them in every quarter of London,\r\nfor the Captain’s wager soon spread about everywhere. It’s a stale game\r\nnow; it was so before my time, but I’ve heard the Jews talk about it.\r\nThe second day I tried the ring dodge, I was a little more successful;\r\nindeed every day for some time exceeded the day before, for, as I\r\nimproved in patter, my sales increased. My appearance, too, was\r\nimproving. At one time I was a regular swell, sported white kid gloves,\r\nwhite choker, white waistcoat, black ribbon, and a quizzing glass. Some\r\npeople used to chaff me, and cry out ‘there’s a swell.’ I never was\r\nsaving, always spent my money as fast as I got it. I might have saved a\r\ngoodish bit, and I wish I had now. I never had a wife, but I have had\r\ntwo or three broomstick matches, though they never turned out happy. I\r\nnever got hold of one but what was fond of lush. I live in Westminster,\r\nat a padding-ken. I’d rather not tell you where, not that I’ve anything\r\nto fear, but people might think I was a _nose_, if anybody came after\r\nme, and they would crab me. I’d rather get something else to do if I\r\ncould, but I think this is the best street game I could follow. I don’t\r\nbelieve any of the ring-sellers dispose of more than myself, except\r\nlittle Ikey; he now adds other articles, a silver thimble (he calls\r\nit), some conundrums, a song-book and a seal, and all for a penny. I\r\ntried the same thing, but found I could do just as well with the rings\r\nalone. We all expects to do great things during the Exhibition. I think\r\nall on us ought to be allowed to sell in the parks. Foreigners are\r\ninvited to witness specimens of British Industry, and it’s my opinion\r\nthey should see all, from the highest to the lowest. We _did_ intend\r\npetitioning the Prince on the subject, but I don’t suppose it would be\r\nany go, seeing as how the slang coves” (the showmen), “have done so,\r\nand been refused.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CHILDREN’S GILT WATCHES.\r\n\r\nThese articles were first introduced into general street sale about 10\r\nyears ago. They were then German made. The size was not much larger\r\nthan that of a shilling, and to this tiny watch was appended as tiny\r\na chain and seal. The street-price was only 1_d._, and the wholesale\r\nprice was 8_s._ the gross. They were sold at eight of the swag-shops,\r\nall “English and foreign,” or “English and German” establishments. From\r\nthe price it would appear that the profit was 4_d._ a dozen, but as the\r\nstreet-sellers had to “take the watches as they came,” the profit was\r\nbut 3_d._, as a dozen watches in a gross had broken glasses, or were\r\notherwise damaged and unsaleable. The supply of these watches was not\r\nequal to the demand, for when a case of them was received, “it could\r\nhave been sold twice over.” One street-seller told me that he had sold\r\n15 and even 16 dozen of these watches on a day, and that once on a\r\nSaturday night, and early on Sunday morning, he had sold 2 gross, or\r\n24 dozen. Such, however, was not the regular sale; a “good week” was a\r\nprofit of 15_s._\r\n\r\nAbout six years ago gilt watches of a very superior kind were sold\r\nin the streets in a different way. They were French made, and were\r\nat first vended at 1_s._ each. Some were displayed in case-boxes,\r\nfitted up with divisions, in which were placed the watches with the\r\nguard-chains, about three-quarters of a yard long, coiled round them.\r\nThere were also two or three keys, one in the form of a pistol. The\r\nothers were hung from a small pole, sometimes a dozen, and sometimes\r\ntwo, being so suspended, and they had a good glittering appearance in a\r\nbright light; this street fashion still continues. The street-sellers,\r\nhowever, are anxious not to expose these watches too much, as they are\r\neasily injured by the weather, and any stain or injury is irreparable.\r\nThe shilling sale continued prosperously for about six weeks, and\r\nthen the wholesale price--owing, the street-sellers were told at the\r\nswag-shops, to “an opposition in the trade in Paris,”--was reduced to\r\n4_s._ 6_d._ the dozen, and the retail street-price to 6_d._ each. When\r\nthe trade was “at its best” there were thirty men and twenty women\r\nselling these watches, all May, June, and July, and each clearing from\r\n12_s._ to 20_s._ (but rarely the latter sum) a week. Last “season”\r\nthere were for the same period about half the number of sellers\r\nmentioned, averaging a profit of about 15_d._ a day each, or 9_s._ a\r\nweek. The cry is--“Handsome present for 6_d._ Beautiful child’s watch\r\nand chain, made of Peruvian metal, by working jewellers out of employ.\r\nOnly 6_d._ for a handsome present.”\r\n\r\nThe vendors of these watches are the regular street-sellers, some of\r\nthem being tolerably good patterers. One of these men, in the second\r\nyear of the street-sale of watches, appeared one morning in an apron\r\nand sleeves, to which brass and copper filings were made to adhere,\r\nand he announced himself as an English working jeweller unemployed,\r\noffering his own manufactures for sale, “better finished and more\r\nsolider nor the French.” The man’s sale was greatly increased. On the\r\nfollowing day, however, four other English working jewellers appeared\r\nin Leicester-square and its approaches, each in besprinkled apron and\r\nsleeves, and each offering the productions of his own handicraft! The\r\napron and sleeves were therefore soon abandoned.\r\n\r\nAmong the best “pitches,”--for the watch-sellers are not itinerant,\r\nthough they walk to and fro--are the Regent’s-park, Leicester-square,\r\nthe foot of London-bridge, and of Blackfriars-bridge, and at the\r\nseveral railway stations.\r\n\r\nThe principal purchasers, I was told by an intelligent patterer, who\r\nsometimes “turned his hand to the watches,” were “fathers and mothers,”\r\nhe thought, “and them as wished to please such parties.”\r\n\r\nCalculating that twenty-five persons now vend watches for twelve weeks\r\nin the year, and--as they are 10 per cent. cheaper than they were at\r\nthe swag-shops--that each clears 8_s._ weekly, we find 360_l._ yearly\r\nexpended in London streets in these toy watches.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF TINWARE.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of tins, who carry them under their arms, or in any way on\r\na round, apart from the use of a vehicle, are known as hand-sellers.\r\nThe word hand-seller is construed by the street-traders as meaning\r\nliterally _hand-seller_, that is to say, a _seller_ of things held or\r\ncarried in the _hand_; but the term is clearly derived from the Scotch\r\n_handsell_, as in “handsell penny.” Handsell, according to Jamieson,\r\nthe Scotch etymologist, means, (1) “The first money that a trader\r\nreceives for goods; also a gift conferred at a particular season. (2) A\r\npiece of bread given before breakfast.” Ihre, the Gothic lexicographer,\r\nviews the term handsell as having sprung from the Mæso-Gothic _hunsla_\r\n(sacrifice or offering). This is the same as the Anglo-Sax _husl_ (the\r\nEucharist), whence comes the English _housel_ and _unhouseled_; and he\r\nconsiders the word to have originally meant a gift or offering of any\r\nkind. Hence, the hand-sellers of tin and other wares in the street,\r\nwould mean simply those who _offered_ such tin or other wares for sale.\r\nThe goods they dispose of are dripping-pans (sometimes called “square\r\npans”), sold at from 3_d._ to 18_d._, the 3_d._ pans being “6 inch,”\r\nand the 18_d._ “15 inch;” cullenders, 6_d._ to 9_d._; hand-bowls,\r\nfor washerwomen, 1_s._ (now a very small portion of the trade);\r\nroasting-jacks, with tin bodies, 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ (this used to be\r\nthe best article for profit and ready sale in the trade, but “they are\r\ngoing out of date”); and the smaller articles of graters, &c.\r\n\r\nThe hand-sellers also trade in other articles which are less portable;\r\nthe principal sale, however, is at “stands,” and there chiefly on a\r\nSaturday night, the greatest business-time of street-commerce! These\r\nless portable articles are tea-kettles, 10_d._ to 18_d._; saucepans of\r\nall sizes, the smallest being the “open pints” at 2_d._ or 2-1/2_d._\r\neach (they cost them 20_d._ a dozen; it’s a bargain to get them at\r\n18_d._), and the largest the “nine quart;” but the kinds most in demand\r\nare the “three pints” and “two quarts,” sold at 6_d._ and 8_d._ There\r\nare also fish-kettles in this street-traffic, though to a very limited\r\nextent--“one fish-kettle,” I was told, “to four-and-twenty saucepans;”\r\nthe selling price for the fish-kettles is 5_s._ and 3_s._ 6_d._ each;\r\ncandlesticks are sold at 4_d._ to 1_s._; and shaving-pots, 4_d._ A few\r\ntin things used to be sold at the mews, but the trade is now almost\r\nentirely abandoned. These were tins for singeing horses, 2_s._ 6_d._\r\neach when first introduced, ten or twelve years ago, but now 1_s._, and\r\nstable lanterns, of punched tin, which cannot be sold now for more than\r\n1_s._ each, though they cost 10_s._ per dozen at a tin-shop.\r\n\r\nThere are other tin articles vended in the streets, but they will be\r\nmore properly detailed in my account of street-artisans, as the maker\r\nand the street-seller are the same individual. Among these are Dutch\r\novens, which are rarely offered now by those who purchase their goods\r\nat the tin-shops, as the charge there is 6_d._ “Why,” said a working\r\ntinman to me, “I’ve had 10_d._ many a week for making ovens, and the\r\nstuff found. It takes two plates of tin to make an oven, that’s 3_d._\r\nat any tin-shop, before a minute’s labour is given to it, and yet the\r\nmen who hawk their own goods sell their ovens regularly enough at 4_d._\r\nIt’s the ruin of the trade.” The tin-shops, I may observe, supply the\r\nartisans with the materials they require, as well as the ready-made\r\narticles, to the street-seller.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest street-stands “in tin” is in St. John-street,\r\nClerkenwell, on Saturday evenings, but the proprietor pertains to the\r\nartisan class, though he buys some of his goods at the tin-shops.\r\n\r\nThe hand-sellers of tin are about 100 in number, and 60 of that\r\nnumber may be said to be wives and children of the remaining 40; as\r\nthe majority of the itinerant vendors of tinware are married men with\r\nfamilies. “Tins” are not a heavy carriage, and can very well be borne\r\nfrom house to house by women, while children sell such things as\r\nnutmeg-graters, pepper-boxes, extinguishers, and save-alls. Those who\r\nsell the larger tin articles in the streets are generally the makers of\r\nthem. “A dozen years back or more, perhaps, there was,” I was informed,\r\n“some prime block-tin tea-pots sold in the streets; there’s none now.\r\nMetal’s druv out tin.”\r\n\r\nAmong the street tin-sellers I heard many complaints of the smallness,\r\nand the constantly diminishing rate of their earnings. “Our people\r\nhas bad luck, too,” said one man, “or they isn’t wide awake. You may\r\nremember, sir, that a few weeks back, a new save-all came in, and\r\nwas called candle-wedges, and went off well. It was a tin thing, and\r\nought by rights to have been started by the tin-shops for us. But it\r\nwas first put out by the swag-men at 3_s._ the gross. The first and\r\nsecond days the men were soon sold out. Them as could patter tidy did\r\nthe best--I tried, but you see, sir, I’m no scholar. Well, they went\r\nat night to Mr. ----’s, in Houndsditch, I think it is, and he says,\r\n‘I’m out of them, but I’ll have some in the morning.’ They goes in the\r\nmorning, and the swag says: ‘O, I can’t afford ’em at three shillings,\r\nyou can have ’em at four.’ He put 1_s._ exter on the gross, cause\r\nthey sold, nothing else, sir; and a relation of mine heard the swag\r\nshopkeeper say, ‘Why, they’re cheap at four; Jim (the street-seller)\r\nthere made 3_s._ 3_d._ on ’em yesterday. I ain’t a going to slave,\r\nand pay rent, and rates, and taxes, to make _your_ fortens; it ain’t\r\nlikely.’ You see, sir, they was sold at 1/2_d._ each, and cost 1/4_d._,\r\nwhich is 3_d._ a dozen, and so the swag got a higher profit, while the\r\npoor fellows had to sell for less profit.”\r\n\r\nFrom the most reliable information which I could acquire, it appears\r\nthat these tin-sellers, taken altogether, do not earn above 6_s._\r\na week each, as regards the adult men, and half that as regards\r\nthe children and women. To realize this amount, the adults must\r\ntake 13_s._, and the women and children 7_s._, for the latter are\r\nless “priced down.” Thus, if we calculate an average receipt, per\r\nindividual, of 10_s._ weekly, reckoning 100 sellers, we find a yearly\r\nexpenditure on tins, bought in the street, of 2500_l._ The trade is\r\ngreatest in the suburbs, and some men, who have become “known on their\r\nrounds,” supply houses, by order, with all the tins they require.\r\n\r\nThere is a branch of the tin-trade carried on in a way which I have\r\nshown prevailed occasionally among the costermongers, viz., the selling\r\nof goods on commission. This system is now carried on among all the\r\nparties who trade “from” swag-barrows.\r\n\r\nThe word “_swag_” which has been so often used in this work of\r\nlate, is, like many other of the street-terms, of Scotch origin (as\r\n_handseller_, and _busker_). The Scotch word is _sweg_ or _swack_, and\r\nmeans, according to Jamieson, a quantity, a considerable number, a\r\nlarge collection of any kind. (The root appears to be an ancient German\r\nterm, _sweig_--a flock, a herd.) Hence a Swag Warehouse is a warehouse\r\ncontaining a large collection of miscellaneous goods; and a Swag\r\nBarrow, a barrow laden with a considerable assortment of articles. The\r\nslang term _swag_ means booty, plunder--that is to say, the collection\r\nof goods--the “lot,” the “heap” stolen.\r\n\r\nOf these swag-barrowmen, there are not less than 150, and the\r\nbarrows are mostly the property of three individuals, who are not\r\nstreet-sellers themselves. One of these men has 50 barrows of his own,\r\nand employs 50 men to work them. The barrow proprietor supplies not\r\nonly the vehicle, but the stock, and the men’s remuneration is 3_d._ in\r\nthe 1_s._ on the amount of sales. Each article they sell is charged to\r\nthe public 1_d._ The tin-wares of the swag-barrows are nutmeg-graters,\r\nbread-graters, beer-warmers, fish-slices, goblets, mugs, save-alls,\r\nextinguishers, candle-shades, money-boxes, children’s plates, and\r\nrattles. In addition to the tin-wares, the swag-barrows are stocked\r\nwith brooches, rings, pot-ornaments, plates, small crockeryware,\r\ntoys, &c., each article being also vended at 1_d._ The trade is so\r\nfar stationary, that the men generally confine themselves to one\r\nneighbourhood, if not to one street. The majority of the swag-barrowmen\r\nhave been costermongers, and nearly the whole have been engaged in\r\nstreet avocations all their lives. One man familiar with the trade\r\nthought I might state that the whole were of this description; for\r\nthough there was lately a swag-barrowman who had been a tradesman in an\r\nextensive way, there was, he believed, no such exception at the present\r\ntime. These barrowmen are nearly all uneducated, and are plodding\r\nand persevering men, though they make few exertions to better their\r\ncondition. As the barrow and stock are supplied to them, without any\r\noutlay on their part, their faculties are not even sharpened, as among\r\nmany of the costermongers, by the necessity of providing stock-money,\r\nand knowing how to bargain and buy to advantage. They have merely\r\nto sell. Their commission furnishes little or nothing more than the\r\nmeans of a bare subsistence. The great sale is on Saturday nights at\r\nthe street-markets, and to the working people, who then crowd those\r\nplaces, and, as one said to me, “has a few pennies to lay out.” At such\r\ntimes as much as 3_l._ has been taken by a swag-barrowman. During the\r\nother days of the week their earnings are small. It is considered a\r\nfirst-rate week, and there must be all the facilities for street-trade\r\nafforded by fine weather, to take 2_s._ a day (clearing 6_d._), and\r\n3_l._ on a Saturday night. This gives the swag-barrowman a commission\r\nof 18_s._; but I am informed, by competent persons, that the average\r\nof the weekly profits of these street-traders does not exceed 10_s._ a\r\nweek. This shows a yearly receipt, by the men working the barrows, of\r\n3900_l._ as their profit or payment, and a gross receipt of 11,700_l._\r\nOf this large amount nearly two-thirds, I am assured, is expended on\r\ntin-wares.\r\n\r\nThe prime cost, at the tin-shops, of these wares, to the barrow\r\nproprietors, are 7_s._ and 7_s._ 6_d._ the gross, leaving from\r\n1-1/2_d._ to 2_d._ profit on every shilling, over the 3_d._ commission\r\npaid to the salesman. The tins are all made in London. The jewellery,\r\nand other stock of the swag-barrows, are bought at the general\r\nswag-shops, of which I have before spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF A TIN-WARE SELLER.\r\n\r\nThe following street-biography was communicated to me in writing. It\r\nis, I believe, a striking instance of the vicissitudes and privations\r\nto which a street-life is subject. It forms, moreover, a curious\r\nexample of those moral contradictions which make the same individual at\r\none time give way _hopelessly_ to the force of circumstances, and at\r\nanother resolutely control them.\r\n\r\n“My object,” says my correspondent, “for writing this, what some folks\r\nno doubt will call a nonsensical epistle, is merely to show how much\r\nhuman nature is capable of enduring in the shape of privations. People\r\nin easy circumstances will scarcely credit what I am about to relate;\r\nand many of the poor will smile at what I have termed hardships, and at\r\nmy folly in endeavouring to paint the misery I have endured, which will\r\nappear slight when compared to what they themselves have suffered.\r\n\r\n“I am the son of a mechanic who was accidentally drowned some weeks\r\nprevious to my birth. My mother, through industry and perseverance,\r\nendeavoured to support me and my sister till we arrived at the ages\r\nof 15 and 18, I being the younger. I entered a gentleman’s service as\r\npantry-boy, where I continued until I considered myself competent to\r\ntake a higher situation. Still a servant’s life was not the bent of\r\nmy inclinations; martial music and viewing soldiers on parade made\r\nme think that a rifle was a more graceful tool than a toasting-fork.\r\nI resolved to serve his Majesty, and for that purpose enlisted in\r\nthe 60th Rifles on the route for India, but Providence ordained it\r\notherwise. On the afternoon on which I ’listed I fell by accident and\r\nbroke my leg, and as I was not sworn in I was entitled to no pension.\r\nI was six months confined to my bed, and it was three years before\r\nI could go without my crutch. Grief for my misfortunes had borne my\r\nmother to an early grave, and I was left a cripple and destitute.\r\nWhether by design or accident I do not recollect, but I met with the\r\nlady (Lady M----) in whose service I first entered as pantry-boy;\r\nshe took pity on my forlorn condition, and kindly invited me to her\r\nMansion, where I remained until completely restored to health, but\r\nstill crippled. After this I was employed painting and glazing, &c.,\r\nand, considering myself competent to get my living in that line, I\r\nresolved to go to London--the theatre of all my misery to come, for I\r\nwas disappointed. On reaching the metropolis my paint-brush was turned\r\ninto a shovel, my paint-pot into a dust sieve, for I could only get\r\nemployed by a man to work in a dust-yard at 10_s._ a week. From thence\r\nI went to a firm belonging to a friend at Beckenham, near Croydon, as\r\nworking time-keeper, or foreman; but during a fair in that village I\r\nneglected to back the time, and being discharged was cast upon the\r\nworld again with only 3_s._ in my pocket, which I eat and drank up,\r\nhaving no idea of street trading. Then came my trials; but having had\r\nsufficient food during the day, I did not feel much the effects of my\r\nfirst night in the streets. The next day I had no food, and towards\r\ndusk began bitterly to feel my situation; that night I slept, or rather\r\nlay, in an empty house. Towards noon of the next day I felt weak,\r\nand drank large quantities of water, for I had no particular desire\r\nfor food. Passing by a shop where old clothes were offered for sale,\r\nI saw a man wretched in appearance disposing of an old vest for a\r\nfew pence. I caught the malady and was instantly spoiled of my coat,\r\nhaving received in exchange for it 2_s._ and an old frock--such as are\r\ngenerally worn by waggoners or countrymen. I more than once smiled at\r\nmy novel appearance. A penny loaf, a drink of water, and a threepenny\r\nlodging was the first assault upon my 2_s._ I regretted, however, the\r\n3_d._ paid for my lodging, and determined not to risk another, for my\r\nbedfellows were so numerous, and of such teazing propensities, that\r\nthey would not allow me to sleep; truly indeed is it said that ‘poverty\r\nmakes us acquainted with strange bedfellows.’ At this time I formed\r\nan acquaintance with a man whose condition was similar to my own; he\r\nengaged to put me ‘fly to a dodge’ or two; an explanation from him was\r\nnecessary to make me acquainted with the sense of his words, which I\r\nsoon found simply meant artful manœuvres. One of these dodges was to\r\nsnooze (a term for sleeping) in the Adelphi arches; I felt grateful\r\nfor such a mark of disinterested friendship, and next day my friend\r\nand me fared sumptuously on the produce of my coat, and at night we\r\nrepaired to the Arches in question, and there found a comfortable\r\nlodging in a hay-loft. I lay for some time, but did not sleep. I was\r\nseveral times addressed by my companion in an under tone, ‘Are you\r\nasleep,’ he whispered, ‘ain’t it a stunning dos?’ (which means a good\r\nbed). I was not in a mood for conversation, and made no reply; to\r\nsilence him completely I affected to snore, and this had the desired\r\neffect. For a few minutes he was quite quiet, and then he commenced\r\nwith great caution to unlace my boots, with a view to stealing them. I\r\nperceived his object, and immediately left my lodging and companion.\r\nI felt grieved and disappointed at the loss of one in whom I placed\r\nall confidence; but this time wisdom was purchased cheaply, inasmuch\r\nas I suffered no loss except that my money might have lasted me a\r\nlittle longer. The remainder of that night I strayed about the Strand\r\nand Charing-cross, after a drink of water; I took a seat on a curb\r\nsurrounding the pump; many wretched beings came and seated themselves\r\nbeside me, and a conversation ensued respecting their several\r\ndestinations during the day. One proposed going to Hungerford-market to\r\ndo a feed on decayed shrimps or other offal laying about the market;\r\nanother proposed going to Covent-garden to do a ‘tightener’ of rotten\r\noranges, to which I was humorously invited; I accepted the invitation,\r\nand proceeded with my new companion. I fared well; I filled my hat,\r\ntook a seat, and made a most delicious breakfast. I remained strolling\r\nabout the Garden all day, and towards evening was invited by my\r\ncompanions to a ‘dos’ in an open shed in Islington; this I declined,\r\nalleging that I had a lodging, but that night I slept amongst a heap\r\nof stones near the pillar at Charing-cross. I continued to attend the\r\nGarden for several weeks, subsisting entirely on the offal of that\r\nmarket. One day I took notice of a man there selling chestnut leaves;\r\nI enquired how he obtained them: he told me he plucked them from the\r\ntrees without hindrance, and directed me to where I could obtain some.\r\nI went to a grove in the vicinity of Kilburn, and lay there all night.\r\nNext morning I found no leaves, so I returned disappointed to town, and\r\non going through the market a woman employed me to carry a bushel of\r\npears some little distance for her for a penny. I felt quite elevated\r\nin anticipation of such a treat as a penny loaf, but alas! I fell down\r\nunder the weight of the fruit and poverty; my employer, however, kindly\r\ngave me the penny, though some of her pears were injured, and I had\r\nnot taken them half the required distance. With the money I purchased\r\na loaf, and sat on a stone near the pump in Covent Garden and began\r\nmy meal. Here I soon had a companion, who after rincing a lettuce at\r\nthe pump, began to devour it. I shared my loaf with him. ‘O God!’ said\r\nhe, ‘what are we destined to suffer. I have escaped the bullets of\r\nthe Carlists in Spain to die in the streets of London with hunger.’ I\r\nfelt an interest in the poor fellow, who I discovered in the course of\r\nconversation had been a gentleman’s servant in his time; he assured me\r\nhe had been living in the same way for several weeks as I myself had\r\nbeen. Towards night my companion asked me where I slept. I told him my\r\ndifferent haunts, he told me I’d better go to the straw-yard with him;\r\nthis was a place I had not yet heard of; it was the nightly refuge for\r\nthe houseless poor. I accompanied him without hesitation; my confidence\r\nwas not misplaced; I slept there several nights. Bread was distributed\r\nto us night and morning, and this was fortunate, for the Garden began\r\nto fail. In the course of conversation with some of the inmates of the\r\nRefuge, we found that we could obtain employment at stone-breaking;\r\nthis we tried the next morning, and succeeded. We worked all day, and\r\nreceived 6_d._ each on leaving work. We then made up our minds to go to\r\nlodgings that we might have an opportunity of washing what were once\r\nshirts.\r\n\r\n“Misery had not had that wasting influence on my companion as it had on\r\nme. I was at this time a complete skeleton; a puff of wind would cause\r\nme to stagger. I continued stone-breaking, but about noon of the third\r\nday I sunk exhausted on the heap of stones before me. Poverty had done\r\nits work, and I anticipated with pleasure approaching dissolution. I\r\nwas assisted to my lodging by my companion, and went to bed. When the\r\nwoman at the lodging-house discovered that I was ill, she ordered some\r\nof her domestics to dress me and put me in the street, alleging that\r\nshe was under a penalty of 20_l._ were it discovered that she lodged\r\na sick stranger. I was, therefore, cast into the street at 12 o’clock\r\nat night. My companion then gave me the 3_d._ he had earned that day\r\nto procure me a lodging if possible, and he slept in the streets the\r\nremainder of the night. I went to another lodging, concealing as much\r\nas possible my illness; my money was taken, and I was conducted to bed.\r\nI spent a wretched night, and next morning I was very bad. The landlady\r\nled me to the workhouse; I was admitted directly; had they detained\r\nme asking questions I should have sunk on the floor. My disorder was\r\npronounced English cholera. I lay three weeks in a precarious state,\r\nbut at the end of seven weeks was recovered sufficiently to walk about.\r\nI was then discharged; but on going towards the Abbey in Westminster\r\nI fainted, and on recovery found myself surrounded by a number of\r\npersons. I was advised to return to the house; I did so, and was\r\nadmitted for a short time, after which I was again discharged, but\r\nI received out-door relief twice a week; and for some time a small\r\nportion of bread and cheese as well. _I had now lost not only all\r\nhope, but even desire of bettering my condition_; during these trials\r\nI made none acquainted with my privations, save those situated as I\r\nwas. I now altered my condition as regards sleeping; I walked about\r\nduring the night, and slept a portion of the day on a heap of sand\r\nnear Westminster-bridge. I then remembered to have a poor relative in\r\nKensington; I did not plead distress, but merely asked whether she\r\nknew where I might procure employment. I had a cup of tea, the first I\r\nhad tasted since I was in the workhouse, a period of five weeks. Being\r\nasked some question by my relative, I could not help making reference\r\nto some of my sufferings. At this place I found a young man of whom I\r\nhad had a previous acquaintance; I told him of my inability to procure\r\na lodging, and he allowed me without the knowledge of his parents to\r\nsleep in the stable-loft; the bed was hard, but the coal sacks kept me\r\nwarm. Here I had many opportunities of earning a few pence, and I began\r\nto regain my spirits. On one occasion, seeing a lad illtreated by a\r\nyoung man who was much his superior in size and strength, I interposed,\r\nand it may be conjectured in what manner. This circumstance procured\r\nme a friend, for, with the assistance of the lad I had protected, I\r\nwas enabled to live tolerably well, and after a short while I got a\r\nsituation at a coal-shed at 10_s._ a week. I continued in this place\r\neighteen months, but, my master giving up the business, I was again\r\ncast on the world. I then began to think seriously of some way of\r\nliving, and for the first time asked for the loan of 15_s._ With\r\nthis I purchased a few articles of furniture, laid out 7_s._ 6_d._\r\nfor two hundred of oranges, with which I walked and hawked about two\r\ndays, taking but 4_d._ during the time. I disposed of the remainder\r\nof my stock, wholesale, for 6_s._; with this I purchased a small tin\r\nsaucepan, a piece of marble slab, and commenced sugar-boiling. I\r\nretailed my manufacture in the streets. By dint of perseverance and\r\neconomy I managed to live this way through the winter and a portion\r\nof the spring; but summer being now come, people needed none of my\r\ncompounds to warm their mouths, so it was necessary for me to change\r\nmy hand. What should I do? Thoughts came and vanished at their births.\r\nI recollected having seen a person selling rings at a penny each; I\r\nmade up my mind to try the same. I laid out 5_s._ in a tray and stock;\r\nafter arranging the goods to the best advantage I sallied into the\r\nstreets. The glittering baubles took for a while, but when discoloured\r\nwere useless. Having once a considerable stock of these soiled rings,\r\nI was prompted to begin “lot selling.” After calculating the profits,\r\nI commenced selling in that line. As this continued for seven weeks I\r\nmanaged to get a living. The system then became general; every street\r\nin the metropolis contained a lot seller, so I was determined to change\r\nmy hand. One day in the street I saw a girl with a bundle of old\r\numbrellas going towards a marine store shop; I asked if the umbrellas\r\nwere for sale; she replied in the affirmative; the price she asked was\r\n4_d._; I became a purchaser. With these old umbrellas I commenced a new\r\nlife. I bought some trifling tools necessary for repairing umbrellas,\r\nand, after viewing well the construction of the articles, I commenced\r\noperations. I succeeded, and in a little time could not only mend an\r\nold umbrella, but make a new one. This way of living I followed three\r\nyears. In one of my walks through the streets crying old umbrellas\r\nto sell, I saw a street tinker repairing a saucepan; he seemed so\r\nvery comfortable with his fire-pan before him, that I resolved from\r\nthat moment to become a tinker, and for that purpose I bought a few\r\ntools, prepared a budget, and sallied into the streets with as much\r\nindifference as if I had been at the business since my birth. After a\r\nlittle practice I fancied I was fit for better things than mending old\r\nsaucepans, and flattered myself that I was able to make a new one. This\r\nI resolved to attempt, and succeeded so well, that I at once abandoned\r\nthe rainy-day system, and commenced manufacturing articles in tin-ware,\r\nsuch as are now sold in the streets, namely funnels, nutmeg-graters,\r\npenny mugs, extinguishers, slices, savealls, &c. I soon became known to\r\nthe street-sellers and swag-shop proprietors. The prices I get are low,\r\nand I am deficient in some of the tools necessary to forward the work,\r\nwith the required speed to procure returns adequate to my expenses; but\r\nthanks to the Lord I am better off than ever I expected to be, with the\r\ndifference only of a somewhat shattered constitution. There are many at\r\nthe present day suffering as I have done, and they may be found in and\r\nabout the different markets of the metropolis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF DOG-COLLARS.\r\n\r\nOf these street-traders there are now regularly twelve; one man counted\r\nto me fourteen, but two of these only sold dog-collars occasionally,\r\nwhen they could not get employment in their trade as journeymen\r\nbrass-founders. Of the regular hands, one, two, and sometimes three\r\nsell only dog-collars (with the usual adjuncts of locks, and sometimes\r\nchains, and key-rings), but even these, when their stock-money avails,\r\nprefer uniting to the collars some other trifling article.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most profitable pitches for the sale of these articles are\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Old Swan Pier, off Thames-street, and at\r\na corner of the Bank. Neither of these two traders confines his stock\r\nto dog-collars, though they constitute the most valuable portion of\r\nit. The one sells, in addition to his collars, key-rings, keys and\r\nchains, dog-whistles, stamps with letters engraved upon them, printer’s\r\ntype, in which any name or initials may be set up, shaving-brushes,\r\ntrowser-straps, razors, and a few other light articles. The other sells\r\nlittle more than “dog” articles, with the addition of brass padlocks\r\nand small whips. But the minor commodities are frequently varied,\r\naccording to the season and to the street-seller’s opinion of what may\r\n“sell.”\r\n\r\nSome of these traders hang their wares against the rails of any\r\npublic or other building in a good situation, where they can obtain\r\nleave. Others have stalls, with “a back,” from the corners of which\r\nhang the strings of dog-collars, one linked within another. The\r\nmanner in which one street-seller displays his wares is shown in\r\nthe illustration before given. Of the whole number, half are either\r\nitinerant on a round, or walk up and down a thoroughfare and an\r\nadjacent street or two. “Dog-collars,” said one man, “is no good at\r\nSaturday-night markets. People has said to me--for I was flat enough\r\nto try once--‘Dogs! pooh, I’ve hardly grub enough for the kids.’ For\r\nall that, sir, some poor people has dogs, and is very fond of them too;\r\nay, and I’ve sold them collars, but seldom. I think it’s them as has no\r\nchildren has dogs.”\r\n\r\nThe collars most in demand are brass. One man pointed out to me the\r\nmerits of his stock, which he retailed from 6_d._ each (for the very\r\nsmall ones) to 3_s._--for collars seemingly big enough for Pyrenean\r\nsheep dogs. Some of the street-sold collars have black and red rims and\r\nlinings; others are of leather, often scarlet, stitched ornamentally\r\nover a sort of jointed iron or wire-work. A few are of strong compact\r\nsteel chain-work; “but them’s more the fashion,” said one seller, “for\r\nsporting dogs, like pointers and greyhounds, and is very seldom bought\r\nin the streets. It’s the pet dogs as is our best friends.”\r\n\r\nThe dog-collar sellers have, as regards perhaps one-half, been\r\nconnected in their youth with some mechanical occupation in metal\r\nmanufacture. Four, I am told, are or were pensioners to a small amount,\r\nas soldiers or sailors.\r\n\r\nSome further particulars of the business will be found in the following\r\nstatement given me by a man in the trade. He was sickly-looking, seemed\r\ndispirited at first, but to recover his spirits as he conversed, and\r\nspoke with a provincial (I presume a Warwickshire or Staffordshire)\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n“I served my time, sir; my relations put me--for my parents died when\r\nI was a boy--to a harness furniture maker, in Wa’sall (Walsal), who\r\nsupplied Mr. Dixon, a saddler’s ironmonger, in a good way. I had fair\r\nmakings, and was well treated, and when I was out of my time I worked\r\nfor another master, and I then found I could make my pad territs” (the\r\nround loops of the harness pad, through which the reins are passed),\r\n“my hooks, my buckles, my ornaments (some of ’em crests), as well as\r\nany man. I worked only in brass, never plated, but sometimes the body\r\nfor plating, and mostly territs and hooks. Thinking I’d better myself,\r\nI came to London. I was between five and six weeks before I got a\r\nstroke of work, and my money had gone. I found that London harness\r\nmakers and coachmakers’ names was put on Walsal-made goods, and ‘London\r\nmade’ and ‘town made’ was put too. They might be as good, but they\r\nwasn’t town made no more nor I am. I can’t tell what I suffered, and\r\nfelt, and thought, as at last I walked the streets. I was afraid to\r\ncall at any brass-worker’s--for I can do many sorts of brass work--I\r\nwas so shabby. I called once at Mr. A----’s, near Smithfield, and\r\nhe, or his foreman perhaps it was, says to me, ‘Give that tug-buckle\r\na file.’ I’d had nothing to eat but an apple I found in the street\r\nthat day, and my hand trembled, and so he told me that drunkards, with\r\ntrembling hands, wouldn’t do there. I was never a drinking man; and at\r\nthat time hadn’t tasted so much as beer for ten days. My landlady--I\r\npaid her 1_s._ a week for half a bed with a porter--trusted me my rent,\r\n’cause I paid her when I had it; but I walked about, narvussed and\r\ntrembling, and frightened at every sudden sound. No, sir, I’ve stood\r\nlooking over a bridge, but, though I may have thought of suicide, I\r\nnever once had really a notion of it. I don’t know how to tell it,\r\nbut I felt stupified like, as much as miserable. _I felt I could do\r\nnothing._ Perhaps I shouldn’t have had power of mind to drown myself\r\nif I’d made up my resolution; besides, it’s a dreadful wickedness. I\r\nalways liked reading, and, before I was fairly beaten out, used to read\r\nat home, at shop-windows, and at book-stalls, as long as I dared, but\r\nlatterly, when I was starving, I couldn’t fix my mind to read anyhow.\r\nOne night I met a Wa’s’ll friend, and he took me to his inn, and gave\r\nme a good beef-steak supper and some beer, and he got me a nice clean\r\nbed in the house. In the morning he gave me what did me most good of\r\nall, a good new shirt, and 5_s._ I got work two days after, and kept\r\nit near five years, with four masters, and married and saved 12_l._ We\r\nhad no family to live, and my poor wife died in the cholera in 1849,\r\nand I buried her decently, thank God, for she was a good soul. When I\r\nthought the cholera was gone, I had it myself, and was ill long, and\r\nlost my work, and had the same sufferings as before, and was without\r\nsoles to my shoes or a shirt to my back, ’till a gentleman I’d worked\r\nfor lent me 1_l._, and then I went into this trade, and pulled up a\r\nlittle. In six weeks I paid 15_s._ of my debt, and had my own time for\r\nthe remaining 5_s._ Now I get an odd job with my master sometimes, and\r\nat others sell my collars, and chains, and key-rings, and locks, and\r\nsuch like. I’m ashamed of the dog-collar locks; I can buy them at 2_d._\r\na dozen, or 1_s._ 6_d._ a gross; they’re sad rubbish. In two or three\r\nweeks sometimes, the wire hasp is worn through, just by the rattling of\r\nthe collar, and the lock falls off. I make now, one way and another,\r\nabout 10_s._ a week. My lodging’s 2_s._ a week for a bed-room--it’s a\r\ncloset tho’, for my furniture all went. God’s good, and I’ll see better\r\ndays yet. I have sure promise of regular work, and then I can earn\r\n30_s._ to 40_s._ I do best with my collars about the docks. I’m sure I\r\ndon’t know why.”\r\n\r\nI am told that each of the street-sellers of dog-collars sell on the\r\naverage a dozen a week, at a medium receipt of 12_s._ (“sometimes\r\n20_s._, and sometimes 6_s._”), though some will sell three and even\r\nfour dozen collars in the week. Any regular dog-collar seller will\r\nundertake to get a name engraved upon it at 1_d._ a letter. The goods\r\nare bought at a swag-shop, or an establishment carried on in the same\r\nway. The retailer’s profit is 35 per cent.\r\n\r\nReckoning 12_s._ weekly taken by twelve men, we find 374_l._ expended\r\nyearly in the streets in dog-collars.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF A STREET-SELLER OF DOG-COLLARS.\r\n\r\nFrom the well-known vendor of these articles whose portrait was given\r\nin No. 10 of this work, I had the following sketch of his history:--\r\n\r\n“I was born in Brewer-street, St. James,” he said, in answer to my\r\nquestions; “I am 73 years of age. My father and mother were poor\r\npeople; I never went to school; my father died while I was young;\r\nmy mother used to go out charing; she couldn’t afford to pay for\r\nschooling, and told me, I must look out and _yearn_ my own living\r\nwhile I was a mere chick. At ten years of age I went to sea in the\r\nmerchant sarvice. While I was in the merchant sarvice, I could get\r\ngood wages, for I soon knowed my duty. I was always of an industrious\r\nturn, and never liked to be idle; don’t you see what I mean. In ’97\r\nI was pressed on board the INCONSTANT frigate; I was paid off six\r\nmonths arterwards, but hadn’t much to take, and that, like all other\r\nyoung men who hadn’t larned the dodges of life, I spent very soon;\r\nbut I never got drunk--thank God!” said the old man, “I never got\r\ndrunk, or I shouldn’t ha been what I am now at 73 years of age. I was\r\ndrafted into the Woolwich 44-gun ship; from her to the OVERISAL.” I\r\ninquired how the name of the ship was spelt; “Oh I am not scholard\r\nenough for that there,” he replied, “tho’ I did larn to read and write\r\nwhen abord a man of war. I larned myself. But you must look into a\r\n_Dutch dictionary_, for it’s a Dutch name. I then entered on board the\r\nAMPHINE frigate, and arter I had sarved some months in her, I entered\r\nthe merchant sarvice again, and arter that I went to Greenland to the\r\nwhale-fishery--they calls me here in the college” (he is now an inmate\r\nof Greenwich Hospital) “‘_Whaler Ben_,’ but I arnt affronted--most\r\non ’em here have nicknames. I went three voyages besides to the West\r\nIngees. I never got drunk even there, though I was obliged to drink\r\nrum; it wouldn’t ha done to ha drunk the water NEAT, there was so many\r\ninsects in it. When my sailor’s life was over I comes to Liverpool\r\nand marries a wife--aye and as good a wife as any poor man ever had\r\nin England. I had saved a goodish bit o’ money, nearly 300_l._, for I\r\nwas not so foolish as some of the poor sailors, who yearns their money\r\nlike horses and spends it like asses, I say. Well we sets up a shop--a\r\nchandler shop--in Liverpool: me and my old ’ooman does; and I also\r\nentered into the pig-dealing line. I used to get some of my pigs from\r\nIreland, and some I used to breed myself, but I was very misfortunate.\r\nYou recollect the year when the disease was among the cattle, in course\r\nyou recollects that; well, sir, I lost 24 pigs and a horse in one year,\r\nand that was a good loss for a poor man, wer’n’t it? I thought it werry\r\nhard, for I’d worked hard for my money at sea, and I was always werry\r\ncareful, arter I knowed what life was. My poor wife too used to trust a\r\ngood deal in the shop and by-and-by, behold you, me and my old ’ooman\r\nwas on our beam ends. My wife was took ill too--and, for the purpose\r\nof getting the best adwice, I brings her to London, but her cable had\r\nrun out, and she died, and I’ve been a poor forlorned creatur’ ever\r\nsince. You wouldn’t think it, but arter that I never slept on a bed\r\nfor seven years. I had blankets and my clothes--but what I means is\r\nthat I never had a bed to lie on. I sold most of my bits o’ things to\r\nbury my wife. I didn’t relish applying to the parish. I kept a few\r\nsticks tho’, for I don’t like them ere lodging-houses. I can’t be a\r\nwerry bad kerackter, for I was seven years under one landlord, and I\r\nwarrant me if I wanted a room agin he would let me have one. Arter my\r\nwife died, knowing some’at about ropes I gets work at Maberley’s, the\r\ngreat contractors--in course you knows _him_. I made rope traces for\r\nthe artillery; there’s a good deal of leather-work about the traces,\r\nand stitching them, you see, puts me up to the making of dogs’-collars.\r\nI was always handy with my fingers, and can make shoes or anythink. I\r\ncan work now as well as ever I could in my life, only my eyes isn’t so\r\ngood. Ain’t it curious now, sir, that wot a man larns in his fingers he\r\nnever forgets? Well being out o’ work, I was knocking about for some\r\ntime, and then I was adwised to apply for a board to carry at one of\r\nthem cheap tailors, but I didn’t get none; so I takes to hawking link\r\nbuttons and key rings, and buys some brass dog-collars; it was them\r\nbrass collars as made me bethought myself as I could make some leather\r\nones. Altho’ I had been better off I didn’t think it any disgrace to\r\nget a honest living. The leather collars is harder to make than the\r\nbrass ones, only the brass ones wants more implements. There are about\r\na dozen selling in the streets as makes brass-collars--there’s not much\r\nprofit on the brass ones. People says there’s nothing like leather, and\r\nI thinks they are right. Well, sir, as I was a telling you, I commences\r\nthe leather-collar making,--in course I didn’t make ’em as well at\r\nfirst as I do now. It was werry hard lines at the best of times. I\r\nused to get up at 4 o’clock in the morning in the summer time, and\r\nmake my collars; then I’d turn out about 9, and keep out until 7 or 8\r\nat night. I seldom took more than 2_s._ per day. What profit did I get\r\nout of 2_s._? Why, lor’ bless you, sir! if I hadn’t made them myself,\r\nI shouldn’t have got no profit at all. But as it was, if I took 2_s._,\r\nthe profits was from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._; howsomever, sometimes I\r\ndidn’t take 6_d._ Wet days too used to run me aground altogether; my\r\nrheumatics used to bore me always when the rain come down, and then I\r\ncouldn’t get out to sell. If I’d any leather at them times I used to\r\nmake it up; but if I hadn’t none, why I was obligated to make the best\r\non it. Oh, sir! you little knows what I’ve suffered; many a banyan day\r\nI’ve had in my little room--upon a wet day--aye, and other days too.\r\nWhy, I think I’d a starved if it hadn’t a been for the ’bus-men about\r\nHungerford-market. They are good lads them there ’bus lads to such as\r\nme; they used to buy my collars when they didn’t want them. Ask any on\r\n’em if they know anything about old Tom, the collar-maker, and see if\r\nthey don’t flare up and respect me. They used sometimes to raffle my\r\ncollars and give ’em back to me. Mr. Longstaff too, the landlord of\r\nthe Hungerford Arms--I believe it’s called the Hungerford Hotel--has\r\ngiven me something to eat very often when I was hungry, and had nothing\r\nmyself. There’s what you call a hor’nary there every day. You knows\r\nwhat I mean--gentlemen has their grub there at so much a head, or so\r\nmuch a belly it should be, I says. I used to come in for the scraps,\r\nand werry thankful I was for them I can assure you. Yes, Mr. Longstaff\r\nis what you may call a good man. He’s what you calls a odd man, and\r\na odd man’s always a good man. All I got to say is, ‘God bless him!’\r\nhe’s fed me many time when I’ve been hungry. I used to light upon other\r\nfriends too,--landlords of public-houses, where I used to hawk my\r\ncollars; they seemed to take to me somehow; it wer’n’t for what I spent\r\nin their houses I’m sure, seeing as how I’d nothing to spend. I had no\r\npension for my sarvice, and so I was adwised to apply for admission\r\nto ‘the house here’ (Greenwich Hospital). I goes to Somerset-House;\r\nanother poor fellow was making a application at the same time; but\r\nI didn’t nothing till one very cold day, when I was standing quite\r\nmiserable like with my collars. I’d been out several hours and hadn’t\r\ntaken a penny, when up comes the man as wanted to get into the house,\r\nrunning with all his might to me. I thought he was going to tell me he\r\nhad got into the house, and I was glad on it, for, poor fellow, he was\r\nwerry bad off; howsomever he says to me, ‘Tom,’ says he, ‘they wants\r\nyou at the Admirality.’ ‘Does they?’ says I, and ’cordingly away I\r\ngoes; and arter telling the admiral my sarvice, and answering a good\r\nmany questions as he put to me, the admiral says, says he, ‘The order\r\nwill be made out; you shall go into the house.’ I think the admiral\r\nknowed me or somethink about me, you see. I don’t know his name, and it\r\nwould’nt ha’ done to have axed. God bless him, whoever he is, I says,\r\nand shall say to my dying day; it seemed like Providence. I hadn’t\r\ntaken a ha’penny all that day; I was cold and hungry, and suffering\r\ngreat pain from my rheumatics. Thank God,” exclaimed the old man in\r\nconclusion, “I am quite comfortable now. I’ve everythink I want except\r\na little more tea and shuggar, but I’m quite content, and thank God for\r\nall his mercies.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-SELLER OF DOGS’ COLLARS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe old man informed me moreover that he did not think there were more\r\nthan half-a-dozen street-sellers besides himself who made leather\r\ncollars; it was a poor trade, he said, and though the other makers\r\nwere younger than he was, he “could lick them all at stitching.” He\r\ndid not believe, he told me, that any of the collar-sellers sold more\r\nthan he did--if as many--for he had friends that perhaps other men\r\nhad not. He makes collars now sometimes, and wishes he could get some\r\nshopkeeper to sell them for him, and then maybe, he says, he could\r\nobtain a little more tea and shuggar, and assist a sister-in-law of his\r\nwhom he tells me is in great distress, and whom he has been in the\r\nhabit of assisting for many years, notwithstanding his poverty. The old\r\nman, during the recital of his troubles, was affected to tears several\r\ntimes--especially when he spoke of his wife, and the distress he had\r\nundergone--and with much sincerity blessed God for the comforts that he\r\nnow enjoys.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF TOOLS.\r\n\r\nThese people are of the same class as the sellers of hardware articles,\r\nthough so far a distinct body that they generally sell tools only.\r\n\r\nThe tools are of the commonest kind, and supplied by the cheapest\r\nswag-shops, from which establishments the majority of the\r\nstreet-traders derive their supplies. They are sometimes displayed on a\r\nsmall barrow, sometimes on a stall, and are mostly German-made.\r\n\r\nThe articles sold and the price asked--and generally obtained, as no\r\nextravagant profit is demanded--is shown by the following:--\r\n\r\nClaw hammers, 6_d._ Large claw, black and glaze-faced, 1_s._ Pincers,\r\n4_d._; larger ones, 6_d._ Screw-drivers, from 2_d._ to 1_s._! Flat-nose\r\npliers, 6_d._ a pair; squares, 6_d._ to 1_s._ Carpenters’ oil-cans,\r\nfrom 9_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._ Nests of brad-awls (for joiners, and in\r\nwooden cases), 6_d._ to 2_s._ Back saws, 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nWhile many of the street-sellers of tools travel the several\r\nthoroughfares and suburbs of the metropolis, others vend tools of a\r\nparticular kind in particular localities. These localities and sellers\r\nmay be divided into four distinct classes:--(1) The street-sellers of\r\ntools in the markets; (2) The street-sellers of tools at the docks and\r\nwarehouses; (3) The street-sellers of tools at mews, stable-yards, and\r\njob-masters’; and (4) The street-sellers of tools to working men at\r\ntheir workshops.\r\n\r\nThe markets which are usually frequented by the vendors of tools are\r\nNewgate and Leadenhall. There are, I am informed, only five or six\r\nstreet-sellers who at present frequent these markets on the busy days.\r\nThe articles in which they deal are butchers’ saws, cleavers, steels,\r\nmeat-hooks, and knives; these saws they sell from 2_s._ to 4_s._ each;\r\nknives and steels, from 9_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._ each; cleavers, from 1_s._\r\n6_d._ to 2_s._ each; and meat-hooks at 1_d._, 2_d._, and 3_d._ each,\r\naccording to the size. It is very seldom, however, that cleavers are\r\nsold by the street-sellers, as they are too heavy to carry about. I\r\nam told that the trade of the tool-sellers in Newgate and Leadenhall\r\nmarkets is now very indifferent, owing chiefly to the butchers having\r\nbeen so frequently imposed upon by the street-sellers, that they are\r\neither indisposed or afraid to deal with them. When the itinerant\r\ntool-sellers are not occupied at the markets they vend their wares to\r\ntradesmen at private shops, but often without success. “It is a poor\r\nliving,” said one of the hawkers to me; “sometimes little better than\r\nstarving. I have gone out a whole day and haven’t taken a farthing.”\r\nI am informed that the greater portion of these street-sellers are\r\nbroken-down butchers. The tools they vend are purchased at the\r\nBrummagem warehouses. To start in this branch of the street-business\r\n5_s._ or 10_s._ usually constitutes the amount of capital invested in\r\nstock, and the average takings of each are about 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“A dozen years back twenty such men offered saws at my shop,” said\r\na butcher in a northern suburb to me; “now there’s only one, and he\r\nseems half-starving, poor fellow, and looks very hungrily at the\r\nmeat. Perhaps it’s a way he’s got to have a bit given him, as it is\r\nsometimes.”\r\n\r\nThe only street-seller of tools at present frequenting\r\nBillingsgate-market is an elderly man, who is by trade a working\r\ncutler. The articles he displays upon his tray are oyster-knives,\r\nfish-knives, steels, scissors, packing-needles, and hammers. This\r\ntradesman makes his own oyster-knives and fish-knives; the scissors\r\nand hammers are second-hand; and the packing-needles are bought at\r\nthe ironmongers. Sometimes brad-awls, gimlets, nails, and screws\r\nform a part of his stock. He informed me that he had frequented\r\nBillingsgate-market upwards of ten years. “Wet or dry,” he said, “I\r\nam here, and I often suffer from rheumatics in the head and limbs.\r\nSometimes I have taken only a few pence; on other occasions I have\r\ntaken 3_s._ or 4_s._, but this is not very often. However, what with\r\nthe little I take at Billingsgate, and at other places, I can just get\r\na crust, and go on from day to day.”\r\n\r\nThe itinerant saw-sellers offer their goods to any one in the street\r\nas well as at the shops, and are at the street markets on Saturday\r\nevenings with small saws for use in cookery. With the butchers they\r\ngenerally barter rather than sell, taking any old saw in exchange with\r\nso much money, for a new one. “I was brought up a butcher,” said one\r\nof these saw-sellers, “and worked as a journeyman, off and on, between\r\ntwenty and thirty year. But I grew werry delicate from rheumaticks, and\r\nmy old ’ooman was bad too, so that we once had to go into Marylebone\r\nwork’us. I had no family living, perhaps they’re better as it is.\r\nWe discharged ourselves after a time, and they gave us 5_s._ I then\r\nthought I’d try and sell a few saws and things. A master-butcher\r\nthat’s been a friend to me, lent me another 5_s._, and I asked a man\r\nas sold saws to butchers to put me in the way of it, and he took me\r\nto a swag-shop. I do werry badly, sir, but I’ll not deny, and I can’t\r\ndeny--not anyhow--when you tell me Mr. ---- told you about me--that\r\nthere’s ’elps to me. If I make a bargain, for so much; or for old saws\r\nor cleavers, or any old butcher thing, and so much; a man wot knows me\r\nsays, ‘Well, old boy, you don’t look satisfied; here’s a bit of steak\r\nfor you.’ Sometimes it’s a cut off a scrag of mutton, or weal; that\r\ngives the old ’ooman and me a good nourishing bit of grub. I can work\r\nat times, and every Saturday a’most I’m now a porter to a butcher. I\r\ncarries his meat from Newgate, when he’s killed hisself, and wants no\r\nmore than a man’s weight from the market; and when he ’asn’t killed\r\nhisself in course he hires a cart. I makes 1_s._ a day the year round,\r\nI think, on saws, and my old ’ooman makes more than ’arf as much at\r\ncharing, and there’s the ’elps, and then I gets 18_d._ and my grub\r\nevery Saturday. It’s no use grumbling; lots isn’t grubbed ’arf so well\r\nas me and my old ’ooman. My rent’s 20_d._ a week.”\r\n\r\nThe articles vended by the second class of the street-sellers of\r\ntools, or those whose purchasers are mostly connected with the docks\r\nand warehouses, consist of iron-handled claw-hammers, spanners,\r\nbed-keys, and corkscrews. Of these street-traders there are ten or\r\ntwelve, and the greater portion of them are blacksmiths out of employ.\r\nSome make their own hammers, whereas others purchase the articles\r\nthey vend at the swag-shops. “We sell more hammers and bed-keys than\r\nother things,” said one, “and sometimes we sells a corkscrew to the\r\nlandlord of a public-house, and then we have perhaps half-a-pint of\r\nbeer. Our principal customers for spanners are wheelwrights. Those for\r\nhammers are egg-merchants, oilmen, wax and tallow-chandlers, and other\r\ntradesmen who receive or send out goods in wooden cases; as well as\r\nchance customers in the streets.” The amount of capital required to\r\nstart in the line is from 5_s._ to 15_s._: “it is not much use,” said\r\none, “to go to shop with less than 10_s._”\r\n\r\nA third class of the street-sellers of tools are the vendors\r\nof curry-combs and brushes, mane-combs, scrapers, and clipping\r\ninstruments; and these articles are usually sold at the several mews,\r\nstable-yards, and jobbing-masters’ in and about the metropolis. The\r\nsellers are mostly broken-down grooms, who, not being able to obtain\r\na situation, resort to street-selling as a last shift. “It is the\r\nlast coach, when a man takes to this kind of living,” said one of my\r\ninformants, a groom in a “good place;” “and it’s getting worse and\r\nworse. The poor fellows look half-starved. Why, what do you think I\r\ngave for these scissors? I got ’em for 6_d._ and a pint of beer, and I\r\nshould have to give perhaps half-a-crown for ’em at a shop.” The trade\r\nis fast declining, and to gentlemen’s carriage mews the street-sellers\r\nof such tools rarely resort, as the instruments required for stable-use\r\nare now bought, by the coachmen, of the tradesmen who supply their\r\nmasters. At the “mixed mews,” as I heard them called, there are two men\r\nwho, along with razors, knives, and other things, occasionally offer\r\n“clipping” and “trimming” scissors. Four or five years ago there were\r\nfour of these street-sellers. The trimming-scissors are, in the shops,\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a pair. There is one trade still carried on\r\nin these places, although it is diminutive compared to what it was:\r\nI allude to the sale of curry-combs. Those vended by street-sellers\r\nat the mews are sold at 7_d._ or 6_d._ The best sale for these\r\ncurry-combs is about Coventry-street and the Haymarket, and at the\r\nlivery-stables generally. Along with curry-combs, the street-vendors\r\nsell wash-leathers, mane-combs (horn), sponges (which were like dried\r\nmoss for awhile, I was told, got up by the Jews, but which are now\r\ngood), dandy-brushes (whalebone-brushes, to scrape dirt from a horse’s\r\nlegs, before he is groomed), spoke-brushes (to clean carriage-wheels),\r\nand coach-mops. One dweller in a large West-end mews computed that 100\r\ndifferent street-traders resorted thither daily, and that twenty sold\r\nthe articles I have specified. In this trade, I am assured, there are\r\nno broken-down coachmen or grooms, only the regular street-sellers. A\r\ncommoner curry-comb is sold at 2_d._ (prime cost 1_s._ 3_d._ a dozen),\r\nat Smithfield, on market-days, and to the carmen, and the owners of the\r\nrougher sort of horses; but this trade is not extensive.\r\n\r\nThere may be ten men, I am told, selling common “currys;” and they also\r\nsell other articles (often horse oil-cloths and nose-bags) along with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe last class of street-sellers is the beaten-out mechanic or workman,\r\nwho, through blindness, age, or infirmities, is driven to obtain\r\na livelihood by supplying his particular craft with their various\r\nimplements. Of this class, as I have before stated, there are six men\r\nin London who were brought up as tailors, but are now, through some\r\naffliction or privation, incapacitated from following their calling.\r\nThese men sell needles at four and five for 1_d._; thimbles 1_d._\r\nto 2_d._ each; scissors from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._; and wax 1_d._\r\nthe lump. There are also old and blind shoemakers, who sell a few\r\narticles of grindery to their shopmates, as they term them, as well\r\nas a few decayed members of other trades, hawking the implements of\r\nthe handicraft to which they formerly belonged. But as I have already\r\ngiven a long account of one of this class, under the head of the blind\r\nneedle-seller, there is no occasion for me to speak further on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the street-traders in saws I had the following account of\r\nhis struggles, as well as the benefit he received from teetotalism, of\r\nwhich he spoke very warmly. His room was on the fourth floor of a house\r\nin a court near Holborn, and was clean and comfortable-looking. There\r\nwere good-sized pictures, in frames, of the Queen, the Last Supper, and\r\na Rural Scene, besides minor pictures: some of these had been received\r\nin exchange for saws with street-picture-sellers. A shelf was covered\r\nwith china ornaments, such as are sold in the streets; the table had\r\nits oil-skin cover, and altogether I have seldom seen a more decent\r\nroom. The rent, unfurnished, was 2_s._ a week.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been eight years in this trade, sir,” the saw-seller said, “but\r\nI was brought up to a very different one. When a lad I worked in a\r\ncoal-pit along with my father, but his behaviour to me was so cruel, he\r\nbeat me so, that I ran away, and walked every step from the north of\r\nEngland to London. I can’t say I ever repented running away--much as\r\nI’ve gone through. My money was soon gone when I got to London, and my\r\nway of speaking was laughed at. [He had now very little of a provincial\r\naccent.] That’s fourteen year back. Why, indeed, sir, it puzzles me to\r\ntell you how I lived then when I did live. I jobbed about the markets,\r\nand slept, when I could pay for a lodging, at the cheap lodging-houses;\r\nso I got into the way of selling a few things in the streets, as I saw\r\nothers do. I sold laces and children’s handkerchiefs. Sometimes I was\r\nmiserable enough when I hadn’t a farthing, and if I managed to make a\r\nsixpence I got tipsy on it. For six weeks I slept every night in the\r\nPeckham Union. For another five or six weeks I slept every night in\r\nthe dark arches by the Strand. I’ve sometimes had twenty or thirty\r\ncompanions there. I used to lie down on the bare stones, and was asleep\r\nin a minute, and slept like a top all night, but waking was very bad.\r\nI felt stiff, and sore, and cold, and miserable. How I lived at all\r\nis a wonder to me. About eleven years ago I was persuaded to go to\r\na Temperance Meeting in Harp Alley (Farringdon-street), and there I\r\nsigned the pledge; that is, I made my mark, for I can’t read or write,\r\nwhich has been a great hinder to me. If I’d been a scholard a teetotal\r\ngent would have got me into the police three years ago, about the time\r\nI got married. I did better, of course, when I was a teetotaller--no\r\nmore dark arches. I sold a few little shawls in the streets then, but\r\nit was hardly bread and butter and coffee at times. Eight year ago I\r\nthought I would try saw-selling: a shopkeeper advised me, and I began\r\non six salt saws, which I sold to oilmen. They’re for cutting salt\r\nonly, and are made of zinc, as steel would rust and dirty the salt. The\r\ntrade was far better at first than it is now. In good weeks I earned\r\n16_s._ to 18_s._ In bad weeks 10_s._ or 12_s._ Now I may earn 10_s._,\r\nnot more, a week, pretty regular: yesterday I made only 6_d._ Oilmen\r\nare better customers than chance street-buyers, for I’m known to them.\r\nThere’s only one man besides myself selling nothing but saws. I walk,\r\nI believe, 100 miles every week, and that I couldn’t do, I know, if I\r\nwasn’t teetotal. I never long for a taste of liquor if I’m ever so cold\r\nor tired. It’s all poisonous.”\r\n\r\nThe saws sold are 8 inch, which cost at the swag-shops 8_s._ and 8_s._\r\n6_d._ a dozen; 10 inch, 9_s._ and 9_s._ 6_d._; and so on, the price\r\nadvancing according to the increased size, to 18 inch, 13_s._ 6_d._ the\r\ndozen. Larger sizes are seldom sold in the streets. The second man’s\r\nearnings, my informant believed, were the same as his own.\r\n\r\nThe wife of my informant, when she got work as an embroideress, could\r\nearn 11_s._ and 12_s._ At present she was at work braiding dresses for\r\na dressmaker, at 2-1/2_d._ each. By hard work, and if she had not her\r\nbaby to attend to, she could earn no more than 7-1/2_d._ a day. As it\r\nwas she did not earn 6_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BEGGAR STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I include only such of the beggar street-sellers as\r\nare neither infirm nor suffering from any severe bodily affliction\r\nor privation. I am well aware that the aged--the blind--the lame and\r\nthe halt often _pretend_ to sell small articles in the street--such\r\nas boot-laces, tracts, cabbage-nets, lucifer-matches, kettle-holders,\r\nand the like; and that such matters are carried by them partly to keep\r\nclear of the law, and partly to evince a disposition to the public that\r\nthey are willing to do something for their livelihood. But these being\r\nreally objects of charity, they belong more properly to the second main\r\ndivision of this book, in which the poor, or those that can’t work, and\r\ntheir several means of living, will be treated of.\r\n\r\nSuch, though beggars, are not “lurkers”--a lurker being strictly one\r\nwho loiters about for some dishonest purpose. Many modes of thieving\r\nas well as begging are termed “lurking”--the “dead lurk,” for instance,\r\nis the expressive slang phrase for the art of entering dwelling-houses\r\nduring divine service. The term “lurk,” however, is mostly applied to\r\nthe several modes of plundering by representations of sham distress.\r\n\r\nIt is of these alone that I purpose here treating--or rather of that\r\nportion of them which pretends to deal in manufactured articles.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances the street-sellers of small articles of utility are\r\nalso the manufacturers. Many, however, _say_ they are the producers of\r\nthe things they offer for sale, thinking thus to evade the necessity\r\nof having a hawker’s licence. The majority of these petty dealers know\r\nlittle of the manufacture of the goods they vend, being mere tradesmen.\r\nSome few profess to be the makers of their commodities, solely with the\r\nview of enlisting sympathy, and thus either selling the trifles they\r\ncarry at an enormous profit, or else of obtaining alms.\r\n\r\nAn inmate of one of the low lodging-houses has supplied me with the\r\nfollowing statement:--“Within my recollection,” says my informant,\r\n“the great branch of trade among these worthies, was the sale of\r\nsewing cotton, either in skeins or on reels. In the former case, the\r\narticle cost the ‘lurkers’ about 8_d._ per pound; one pound would\r\nproduce thirty skeins, which, sold at one penny each, or two for three\r\nhalfpence, produced a heavy profit. The lurkers could mostly dispose of\r\nthree pounds per day; the article was, of course, damaged, rotten, and\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n“The mode of sale consisted in the ‘lurkers’ calling at the several\r\nhouses in a particular district, and representing themselves as\r\nManchester cotton spinners out of employ. Long tales, of course,\r\nwere told of the distresses of the operatives, and of the oppression\r\nof their employers; these tales had for the most part been taught\r\nthem at the padding-ken, by some old and experienced dodger of ‘the\r\nschool;’ and if the spokesman could patter well, a much larger sum was\r\nfrequently obtained in direct alms than was reaped by the sale.”\r\n\r\nCotton on reels was--except to the purchaser--a still better\r\nspeculation; the reels were large, handsomely mounted, and displayed in\r\nbold relief such inscriptions as the following:--\r\n\r\n  PIKE’S\r\n  PATENT COTTON.\r\n  120 YARDS.\r\n\r\nThe reader, however, must divide the “120 yards,” here mentioned, by\r\n12, and then he will arrive at something like the true secret as to the\r\nquantity; for the surface only was covered by the thread.\r\n\r\n“The ‘cotton Lurk’ is now ‘cooper’d’ (worn out); a more common\r\ndodge--and, of course, only an excuse for begging--is to envelope a\r\npacket of ‘warranted’ needles, or a few inches of ‘real Honiton lace’\r\nin an envelope, with a few lines to the ‘Lady of the House,’ or a\r\nprinted bill, setting forth the misery of the manufacturers, and the\r\nintention of the parties leaving the ‘fakement’ to presume to call for\r\nan answer in a few hours. I subjoin a copy of one of these documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘_THE LACE-MAKERS’ APPEAL._\r\n\r\n ‘It is with extreme regret we thus presume to trespass on your time\r\n and attention, we are Lace Makers by trade, and owing to the extensive\r\n improvements in Machinery, it has made hand labour completely useless.\r\n\r\n ‘So that it has thrown hundreds of honest and industrious men out of\r\n employment, your petitioners are among the number. Fifteen men with\r\n their families have left their homes with the intention of emigrating\r\n to South Australia, and the only means we have of supporting\r\n ourselves till we can get away, is by the sale of some Frame Thread\r\n and Traced Lace Collars of our own manufacture, at the following low\r\n prices--Fashionable Frame Lace Collars 3d. each, warranted to wash\r\n and wear well; Frame Thread Collars 6d. each, Traced Lace Collars\r\n 1s. each, the best that can be made, and we trust we shall meet with\r\n that encouragement from the Friends of Industry which our necessities\r\n require.\r\n\r\n ‘The enclosed two 6d.\r\n\r\n ‘The party calling for this, will have an assortment of the Newest\r\n Patterns of Frame Thread Lace and Edgings for your inspection, and\r\n the smallest purchase will be thankfully received and gratefully\r\n remembered by G. DAVIS, Lace Makers.\r\n\r\n ‘We beg to state that a number of the families being destitute of\r\n clothing, the bearer is authorised to receive any articles of such in\r\n exchange for Lace, Edgings or Collars.\r\n\r\n ‘ALLEN, Printer, Long-row, Nottingham.’\r\n\r\n“These are left by one of ‘the school’ at the houses of the gentry, a\r\nmark being placed on the door post of such as are ‘bone’ or ‘gammy,’ in\r\norder to inform the rest of ‘the school’ where to call, and what houses\r\nto avoid. As the needles cost but a few pence per thousand, and the\r\nlace less than one halfpenny per yard--a few purchasers of the former\r\nat 1_s._ per packet (25 needles), or of the latter at 2_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nyard, is what these ‘lurkers’ term a ‘fair day’s work for a fair day’s\r\nwages.’\r\n\r\n“Another and very extensive branch of the pseudo-‘manufacturing’\r\nfraternity is to be found among the sham street-sellers of cutlery.\r\n\r\n“At some of the least respectable of the swag-shops may be bought all\r\nthe paraphernalia requisite in order to set up as the real manufacturer\r\nof Sheffield and ‘Brummagem’ goods--including, beside the cutlery,\r\nchamois-leather aprons, paper caps (ready crushed, to give them the\r\nappearance of age and usage), and last, but not least, a compound of\r\nblack lead and tallow, to ‘take the granny’ off them as has white\r\n’ands, so as the flat’s shan’t ‘tumble’ to the ‘unworkmanlike’\r\nappearance of the palms of the ‘lurker.’\r\n\r\n“Thus ‘got up’ for the part,” continues my informant, “and provided\r\nwith a case of razors, which perhaps has cost him two groats, and\r\n(if he can raise as much) a noggin o’ rum to ‘give him cheek’ and\r\nmake him ‘speak up’ to his victims--‘Jack Beaver,’ the ‘king of the\r\nstreet-cutlers,’ will sally forth, and meet, intercept, and follow\r\nany gentleman who seems a ‘likely spec,’ till worried perhaps by\r\nimportunity, the ‘swell’ buys what he does not want, and, I need\r\nscarcely add, what he cannot use. Next, in importance, to ‘Jack\r\nBeaver,’ is the notorious ‘Pat Connor.’ Pat ‘does nothing on the blob,’\r\nthat is to say (he does not follow people and speak to them on the\r\nstreets). His ‘dodge’--and it has been for years a successful one--is\r\nto go round to the public offices, dressed as before described, with\r\nthe exception of being in his shirt sleeves (he has every day a _clean_\r\nshirt), and teaze the clerks till they purchase a pen-knife. He has\r\nbeen known to sell from fifteen to twenty knives in one day, at two\r\nshillings each, the first cost being about threepence-halfpenny. Of\r\ncourse he is often interrupted by porters and other officials, but he\r\nalways carries in one hand a roll of wire, and a small hammer in the\r\nother, and having got the name of some gentleman up stairs, he pretends\r\nthat he is going to mend Mr. So-and-so’s bell. This worthy, a short\r\ntime ago, made free--in the Custom House--with a timepiece, belonging\r\nto one of the clerks, for which the ‘Sheffield manufacturer’ got twelve\r\nmonths in Newgate. I have not seen him since,” adds my informant, “and\r\ntherefore imagine that he is now taking a provincial tour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “HOUSE OF LORDS,” A STREET-SELLER’S DEFUNCT CLUB.\r\n\r\nI have given an account of a defunct club, of which the “paper workers”\r\nwere the chief members; and I have now to do the same of a society\r\nnot very dissimilar in its objects, of which the street-sellers of\r\nmanufactured articles constituted the great majority. It was called\r\nthe “house of lords,” and was established about eight years ago, at\r\nthe Roebuck-tavern, Holborn, and existed three years. Its object was\r\nto relieve its members in sickness. The subscription was 2_d._ a week,\r\nand the relief to a sick member was as many pennies a week as the club\r\ncontained members, with, in any pressing case, an additional halfpenny,\r\nwhich the members paid into the fund, over and above their weekly\r\nsubscription. For the greater part of its existence the club contained\r\nninety members (a few of them honorary), and there were very few cases\r\nof “declaring on the fund” by sick members. At one period for many\r\nweeks there were no such declarations, and the “house of lords” had\r\n30_l._ in hand. One of the leading members, a very intelligent man, who\r\nhad “a good connection in hardware,” had taken great pains to prepare a\r\ncode of rules, which, having been approved by the other members, it was\r\nconsidered time that the “house of lords” should be enrolled. Delays,\r\nhowever, intervened. “To tell you the truth, sir,” one of them said,\r\n“we were afraid to employ an attorney, and thought of waiting upon Mr.\r\nTidd Pratt ourselves, but it wasn’t to be.”\r\n\r\nThe club was, moreover, looked upon as somewhat select. “No costers\r\nwere admitted, sir,” I was told by a hardware seller in the streets;\r\n“not but what there’s many very industrious and honest men among them,\r\nbut they’re in a different line, and are a different sort of people\r\nto us.” The members met once a week, and, though they were merry and\r\ntalkative enough, drunkenness was strongly discouraged. It was common\r\nfor the subscribers who were regarded as the “geniuses” of the trade,\r\nto take counsel together, and “invent any new move.” They were reputed\r\nto be knowing among the most knowing, in all street arts and dodges,\r\nand the way in which the club came to an end, considering the strong\r\nclaims to knowingness of its members, was curious enough.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday evening a member who was considered a respectable man,\r\nand was sufficiently regular in his payments, appeared at the weekly\r\nmeeting, introducing his landlord, who, as a non-member, had to pay\r\n1_d._ for admission. The man told how his family had suffered from\r\nillness, and how he had been ill, and got into arrears of rent, for\r\nhe did not like to distress the fund; and how his landlord was then\r\nin possession of his “sticks,” which must be sold in the morning if\r\nhe could not pay 15_s._; and, moreover, how his landlord--a very\r\nkind-hearted, indulgent man--was forced to do this, for he himself was\r\nin difficulties. The members voted that the 15_s._ should be advanced;\r\nbut before the next meeting night it was discovered that the statement\r\nof the poor member in arrears was an imposition. The landlord was\r\nmerely a confederate; the worthy couple had been drinking together,\r\nand, to prolong their tippling, had hit upon the roguish scheme I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThis, among other things, lowered the confidence of the members. The\r\nnumbers fell off until it was thought best to “wind up the concern.”\r\nThe small funds in hand were fairly apportioned among the remaining\r\nmembers, and the club ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nAnother Street-sellers’ Club has recently been formed by the men\r\nthemselves, of which the following is the prospectus, and it is to be\r\nhoped that this attempt on the part of the street-folk to better their\r\ncondition will meet with a better fate than its predecessor:--\r\n\r\n Our motto is “To live honestly by daily perseverance and industry.”\r\n\r\n  _Street Mechanics, Labourers, Hawkers, &c._\r\n  PROTECTION ASSOCIATION,\r\n  HELD AT THE LAMB TAVERN,\r\n  NEW TURNSTILE, HOLBORN,\r\n  Proprietor, Mr. White.\r\n\r\n The above-named classes are kindly invited to attend a Meeting\r\n convened for\r\n\r\n  SUNDAY EVENING NEXT,\r\n\r\n And every succeeding Sunday Evening, at the above house, to carry\r\n out the object unanimously agreed to by the Enrolled Members and the\r\n General Committee.

Thoresby, Secretary.\r\n\r\n The chair will be taken at Seven o’clock, and the Committee are\r\n requested to be in attendance one hour previous.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CROCKERY AND GLASS-WARES.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a new class of the street-sellers of manufactured\r\narticles--viz., the “crocks,” as they are termed. I have before alluded\r\nto one characteristic of these traders--that they all strive to be\r\nbarterers in preference to salesmen. They also present other varying\r\nqualities when compared with other classes of street-sellers. Of these\r\n“crocks,” there are, from the best data I could obtain from men in\r\nthe trade, and from the swag-shop people who supply them, 250 men and\r\n150 women; of these, 120 couples (man and woman) “work” together;\r\nof the remainder, sometimes two men work in unison, and some women\r\nwork singly. On my inquiring of one of these street folk if ever\r\nthree worked together, I was told that such was never the case, as\r\nthe “crocks” would quote a saying: “Two’s good company, three’s none\r\nat all.” Of the men and women carrying on this traffic conjointly\r\nmore than half are married; showing a difference of habits to the\r\ncostermongers. The reason assigned to me by one of the class (himself\r\nonce a costermonger) was that the interest of the man and woman in the\r\nbusiness was closer than in costermongering, while the serviceableness\r\nof a woman helpmate in “swopping,” or bartering, was much greater. This\r\nprompts the women, I am told, even if they are unmarried at the outset,\r\nto insist upon wedlock; and the man--sometimes, perhaps, to secure a\r\nvaluable “help,” at others, it may be, from better motives--consents\r\nto what in this rank of life, and under the circumstances of such\r\nstreet-traders, is more frequently the woman’s offer than the man’s.\r\nThe trade, in its present form, has not been known more than twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe goods, which are all bought at the crock swag-shops, of which\r\nan account is given below, are carried in baskets on the head, the\r\nmen having pads on the cloth caps which they wear--or sometimes a\r\npadding of hay or wool inside the cap--while the women’s pads are worn\r\noutside their bonnets or caps, the bonnet being occasionally placed on\r\nthe basket. The goods, though carried in baskets on the head to the\r\nlocality of the traffic, are, whilst the traffic is going on, usually\r\nborne from house to house, or street to street, on the arm, or when in\r\nlarge baskets carried before them by the two hands. These baskets are\r\nstrongly made; the principal mart is close to Spitalfields-market.\r\n\r\nThe men engaged in this trade are usually strong, robust, and\r\nred-faced. Most of them are above the middle stature; very few are\r\nbeyond middle age, and the majority of them are under or little more\r\nthan 30. The women, more than the men, have contracted a stoop or\r\nbend to one side, not so much by carrying weights on the head, as by\r\ncarrying them on the arm. The weights they carry are from three to five\r\nstone. The dress of the men is the same as the costermongers, with\r\nthe exception of shooting-cut jackets being more frequent among the\r\n“crocks” than the costers, and red plush waistcoats are very popular\r\nwith them. When not at work, or on Sundays--for they never work on\r\nthe Sabbath, though they do not go to church or chapel--these men\r\nare hardly ever seen to wear a hat. Both men and women wear strong\r\nboots and, unless when “hard-up,” silk handkerchiefs. Their places of\r\nresidence are, as regards the majority, in Spitalfields, Bethnal-green,\r\nand Shoreditch. Of the others the greater portion reside in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kent-street, in the Borough. Their abode usually\r\nconsists of one room, which is in most cases more comfortable, and\r\nbetter furnished than those of the costers. “We pick up a tidy ornament\r\nnow and then,” one crock said, “such as a picture, in the way of swop,\r\nand our good women likes to keep them at home for a bit of show.” They\r\nlive well, in general, dining out almost every day; and I am told that,\r\nas a body, they have fewer children than any other class of street-folk.\r\n\r\nThe trade is almost entirely itinerant. Crock-sellers are to be seen at\r\nstreet-markets on Saturday nights, but they are not the regular crocks,\r\nwho, as I have said, do not care to _sell_. The crocks go on “rounds,”\r\nthe great trade being in the suburbs. Sometimes a round lasts a week,\r\nthe couple resting at a fresh place every night. Others have a round\r\nfor each day of the week.\r\n\r\nThe long rounds are to Greenwich, Woolwich, Northfleet, Gravesend,\r\nStroud, Rochester, Chatham, and then to Maidstone. Some will then make\r\nMaidstone the head-quarters, and work the neighbouring villages--such\r\nas East Farleigh, Town Malling, Yalding, Aylesford, and others. The\r\nreturn to town may be direct by railway, or by some other route, if\r\nany stock remains unsold. On these long rounds the higher priced\r\ngoods are generally carried, and stock is forwarded from London to\r\nthe “crock” whilst on the round, if the demand require it. Another\r\nlong round is Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Kingston-on-Thames, and Guildford,\r\nwith divergings to the villages. The return from Guildford is often by\r\nRichmond, Kew, &c. A third long round is Hampstead, Kilburn, Barnet,\r\nWatford, and so on to St. Alban’s. The other long rounds are less\r\nfrequented; but some go to Uxbridge; others to Windsor and Eton, and\r\nas far as Reading; others to Cambridge, by Tottenham, Edmonton, Ware,\r\n&c. When no trade is to be done close to London, the “crocks” often\r\nhave themselves and their wares conveyed to any town by rail. The\r\nshort, or town rounds, are the Dover-road, New Kent-road, Walworth,\r\nCamberwell, and back by Newington; Kennington, Brixton, Clapham, and\r\nback by Vauxhall; Bayswater, Notting-hill, and back by Paddington;\r\nCamden Town, St. John’s Wood, and Hampstead; Stoke Newington, Dalston,\r\nClapton, Shacklewell, and Stamford-hill; Mile-end, Stratford, and Bow;\r\nLimehouse, Poplar, and back by the Commercial-road. It would be easy\r\nto cite other routes, but these show the character of the trade. Some\r\noccupy two days. A few crocks “work” the poor neighbourhoods, such\r\nas Hoxton, Kingsland-road, parts of Hackney, &c., and cry, “Here we\r\nare--now, ladies, bring out your old hats, old clothes, old umbrellers,\r\nold anythink; old shoes, metal, old anythink; _here_ we are!”\r\n\r\nThe trade, from the best information I could acquire, is almost equally\r\ndivided into what may be called “fancy” and “useful” articles. A\r\nlodging-letter, for instance, will “swop” her old gowns and boots,\r\nand drive keen bargains for plates, dishes, or wash-hand basins and\r\njugs. A housekeeper, who may be in easier circumstances, will exchange\r\nfor vases and glass wares. Servant-maids swop clothes and money for\r\na set of china, “’gainst they get married.” Perhaps there are no\r\nmore frequent collisions between buyer and seller than in the crock\r\nswag-shops. A man who had once been an assistant in one of these\r\nplaces, told me that some of the “crocks” were tiresome beyond measure,\r\nand every now and then a minute or two was wasted by the “crock” and\r\nthe swag-shopman in swearing one at another. Some of these street\r\ntraffickers insist upon testing the soundness of _every_ article, by\r\nstriking the middle finger nail against it. This they do to satisfy\r\ntheir customers also, in the course of trade, especially in poor\r\nneighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nFrom the best data at my command, one quarter of the goods sold at the\r\nswag-shops are sold to the crock dealers I have described, and in about\r\nequal proportions as to amount in fancy or useful articles. There are,\r\nin addition to the crock barterers, perhaps 100 traders who work the\r\npoor streets, chiefly carrying their goods in barrows, but they _sell_,\r\nand though they will barter, do not clamour for it. They cry: “Free\r\ntrade for ever! Here’s cup and saucer for a halfpenny! Pick ’em out at\r\nyour own price! Tea-pot for three half-pence! Pick ’em out! Oho! oho!\r\nGiving away here!” They rattle dishes and basins as they make this\r\nnoise. These men are all supplied at the swag-shops, buying what is\r\ncalled “common lots,” and selling at 30 per cent. profit. Such traders\r\nhave only been known in the streets for five years, and for three or\r\nfour months of the year half of these “go to costering.” The barrows\r\nare about seventy in number, and there are thirty stalls. Seven-eighths\r\nof the “barrow-crocks” are men. The swag-barrowmen also sell small\r\narticles of crockery wares, and altogether one half of the trade of the\r\ncrock swag-shops (which I have described) is a trade for the streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-SELLER OF CROCKERY-WARE\r\n\r\nBARTERING FOR OLD CLOTHES.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nOf the way in which the “crock barterers” dispose of their wares, &c.,\r\nI have given an account below. They are rapidly supplanting the “old\r\nclo’” trade of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe hucksters of crockery-ware are a considerable class. One who has\r\ngreat experience in the business thinks there must be some hundreds\r\nemployed in it throughout London. He says he meets many at the swag\r\nwarehouses on the evenings that he goes there. He is often half an\r\nhour before he can be served. There are seven or eight swag warehouses\r\nfrequented by the hucksters, and at the busy time my informant has\r\noften seen as many as twenty-five at each house, and he is satisfied\r\nthat there must be three or four hundred hucksters of china and glass\r\nthroughout the metropolis. The china and glass in which they deal are\r\nusually purchased at the east end of the town, upon the understanding\r\nthat if the huckster is unable to dispose of them in the course of the\r\nday the articles will be taken back in the morning, if uninjured, and\r\nthe money returned. The hucksters usually take out their goods early\r\nin the day. Their baskets are commonly deposited at the warehouse, and\r\neach warehouse has from thirty to forty baskets left there over-night,\r\nwhen the unsold articles are returned. The baskets are usually filled\r\nwith china and glass and ornaments, to the amount of from 5_s._ to\r\n15_s._, according to the stock-money of the huckster. A basket filled\r\nwith 15_s._ worth of china is considered, I am told, “a very tidy\r\nstock.” In the same neighbourhood as they get the crockery, are made\r\nthe baskets in which it is carried. For these baskets they pay from\r\n2_s._ to 6_s._, and they are made expressly for the hucksters; indeed,\r\non one side of a well-known street at the east end, the baskets made in\r\nthe cellars may be seen piled outside the houses up to the second-floor\r\nwindows. The class of persons engaged in hawking china through the\r\nmetropolis are either broken-down tradesmen or clerks out of place,\r\nor Jews, or they may be Staffordshire men, who have been regularly\r\nbred to the business. They carry different kinds of articles. The\r\nStaffordshire man may generally be known by the heavy load of china\r\nthat he carries with him. He has few light or fancy articles in his\r\nbasket; it is filled chiefly with plates and dishes and earthenware\r\npans. The broken-down tradesmen carries a lighter load. He prefers tea\r\nservices and vases, and rummers and cruet-stands, as they are generally\r\nof a more delicate make than the articles carried by the Staffordshire\r\nmen. The Jew, however, will carry nothing of any considerable weight.\r\nHe takes with him mostly light, showy, Bohemian goods--which are\r\ndifficult “to be priced” by his customers, and do not require much\r\nlabour to hawk about. The hucksters usually start on their rounds about\r\nnine. There are very few who take money; indeed they profess to take\r\nnone at all. “But that is all flam,” said my informant. “If any one was\r\nto ask me the price of an article in an artful way like, I shouldn’t\r\ngive him a straight-forward answer. To such parties we always say,\r\n‘Have you got any old clothes?’” The hucksters _do_ take money when\r\nthey can get it, and they adopt the principle of exchanging their goods\r\nfor old clothes merely as a means of evading the licence. Still they\r\nare compelled to do a great deal in the old clothes’ line. When they\r\ntake money they usually reckon to get 4_d._ in the shilling, but at\r\nleast three-fourths of their transactions consist of exchanges for old\r\nclothes. “A good tea-service we generally give,” said my informant,\r\n“for a left-off suit of clothes, hat, and boots--they must all be in\r\na decent condition to be worth that. We give a sugar-basin for an old\r\ncoat, and a rummer for a pair of old Wellington boots. For a glass\r\nmilk-jug I should expect a waistcoat and trowsers, and they must be\r\ntidy ones too. But there’s nothing so saleable as a pair of old boots\r\nto us. There is always a market for old boots, when there is not for\r\nold clothes. You can any day get a dinner out of old Wellingtons; but\r\nas for coats and waistcoats--there’s a fashion about them, and what\r\npleases one don’t another. I can sell a pair of old boots going along\r\nthe streets if I carry them in my hand. The snobs will run after us to\r\nget them--the backs are so valuable. Old beaver hats and waistcoats\r\nare worth little or nothing. Old silk hats, however, there’s a tidy\r\nmarket for. They are bought for the shops, and are made up into new\r\nhats for the country. The shape is what is principally wanted. We\r\nwon’t give a farden for the polka hats with the low crowns. If we can\r\ndouble an old hat up and put it in our pockets, it’s more valuable\r\nto us than a stiff one. We know that the shape must be good to stand\r\nthat. As soon as a hatter touches a hat he knows by the touch or the\r\nstiffness of it whether it’s been ‘through’ the fire or not; and if so,\r\nthey’ll give it you back in a minute. There is one man who stands in\r\nDevonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street, waiting to buy the hats of us as\r\nwe go into the market, and who purchases at least thirty dozen of us a\r\nweek. There will be three or four there besides him looking out for us\r\nas we return from our rounds, and they’ll either outbid one another,\r\naccording as the demand is, or they’ll all hold together to give one\r\nprice. The same will be done by other parties wanting the old umbrellas\r\nthat we bring back with us. These are valuable principally for the\r\nwhalebone. Cane ribbed ones are worth only from 1_d._ to 2_d._, and\r\nthat’s merely the value of the stick and the supporters. Iron skewers\r\nare made principally out of the old supporters of umbrellas.” The china\r\nand crockery bought by the hucksters at the warehouses are always\r\nsecond-rate articles. They are most of them a little damaged, and the\r\nglass won’t stand hot water. Every huckster, when he starts, has a bag,\r\nand most of them two--the one for the inferior, and the other for the\r\nbetter kind of old clothes he buys. “We purchase gentlemen’s left-off\r\nwearing apparel. This is mostly sold to us by women. They are either\r\nthe wives of tradesmen or mechanics who sell them to us, or else it\r\nis the servant of a lodging-house, who has had the things given to\r\nher, and with her we can deal much easier than the others. She’s come\r\nto ’em light, and of course she parts with ’em light,” said the man,\r\n“and she’ll take a pair of sugar basins worth about 6_d._, you know,\r\nfor a thing that’ll fetch two or three shillings sometimes. But the\r\nmistresses of the houses are she-dragons. They wants a whole dinner\r\n_chany_ service for their husband’s rags. As for plates and dishes,\r\nthey think they can be had for picking up. Many a time they sells\r\ntheir husband’s things unbeknown to ’em, and often the gentleman of\r\nthe house coming up to the door, and seeing us make a deal--for his\r\ntrowsers maybe--puts a stop to the whole transaction. Often and often\r\nI’ve known a woman sell the best part of her husband’s stock of clothes\r\nfor _chany_ ornaments for her mantelpiece. And I’m sure the other day a\r\nlady stripped the whole of her passage, and gave me almost a new great\r\ncoat, that was hanging up in the hall, for a few trumpery tea-things.\r\nBut the greatest ‘screws’ we has to deal with are some of the ladies\r\nin the squares. They stops you on the sly in the streets, and tells\r\nyou to call at their house at sitch a hour of the day, and when you\r\ngoes there they smuggles you quietly into some room by yourselves, and\r\nthen sets to work Jewing away as hard as they can, pricing up their own\r\nthings, and downcrying yourn. Why, the other day I was told to call at\r\na fashionable part of Pimlico, so I gave a person 3_d._ to mind the\r\nchild, and me and my good woman started off at eight in the morning\r\nwith a double load. But, bless you, when we got there, the lady took\r\nus both into a private room unbeknown to the servants, and wanted me\r\nto go and buy expressly for her a green and white chamber service all\r\ncomplete, with soap trays and brush trays, together with four breakfast\r\ncups--and all this here grand set-out she wanted for a couple of old\r\nwashed-out light waistcoats, and a pair of light trowsers. She tried\r\nhard to make me believe that the buttons alone on the waistcoats was\r\nworth 6_d._ a piece, but I knowed the value of buttons afore she was\r\nborned; at first start off I’m sure they wouldn’t have cost 1_d._ each,\r\nso I couldn’t make a deal of it no how, and I had to take all my things\r\nback for my trouble. I asked her even for a pint of beer, but she\r\nwouldn’t listen to no such thing. We generally cry as we go, ‘any old\r\nclothes to sell or exchange,’ and I look down the area, and sometimes\r\nknock at the door. If I go out with a 15_s._ basket of crockery, may\r\nbe after a tidy day’s work I shall come home with 1_s._ in my pocket\r\n(perhaps I shall have _sold_ a couple of tumblers, or half a dozen\r\nplates), and a bundle of old clothes, consisting of two or three old\r\nshirts, a coat or two, a suit of left-off livery, a woman’s gown may\r\nbe, or a pair of old stays, a couple of pair of Wellingtons, and a\r\nwaistcoat or so. These I should have at my back, and the remainder\r\nof my _chany_ and glass on my head, and werry probably a humberella\r\nor two under my arm, and five or six old hats in my hand. This load\r\naltogether will weigh about three quarters of a cwt., and I shall have\r\ntravelled fifteen miles with that, at least; for as fast as I gets\r\nrid on the weight of the crockery, I takes up the weight of the old\r\nclothes. The clothes I hardly know the value on till I gets to the\r\nClothes Exchange, in Houndsditch. The usual time for the hucksters\r\narriving there is between three and four in the winter, or between\r\nfive and six in the summer. In fact, we must be at the Exchange at\r\nthem hours, because there all our buyers is, and we can’t go out the\r\nnext day until we’ve sold our lot. We can’t have our baskets stocked\r\nagain until we’ve got the money for our old clothes.” The Exchange is\r\na large square plot of damp ground, about an acre in extent, enclosed\r\nby a hoarding about eight feet high, on the top of which is a narrow\r\nsloping roof, projecting sufficiently forward to shelter one person\r\nfrom the rain. Across this ground are placed four rows of double seats,\r\nranged back to back. Here meet all the Jew clothesmen, hucksters,\r\ndealers in second-hand shoes, left-off wardrobe keepers, hareskin\r\ndealers, umbrella dealers and menders, and indeed buyers and sellers\r\nof left-off clothes and worn-out commodities of every description. The\r\npurchasers are of all nations, and in all costumes. Some are Greeks,\r\nothers Swiss, and others Germans; some have come there to buy up old\r\nrough charity clothing and army coats for the Irish market, others\r\nhave come to purchase the hareskins and old furs, or else to pick up\r\ncheap old teapots and tea-urns. The man with the long flowing beard\r\nand greasy tattered gaberdine is worth thousands, and he has come to\r\nmake another sixpence out of the rags and tatters that are strewn about\r\nthe ground in heaps for sale. At a little before three o’clock the\r\nstream of rag-sellers sets in in a flood towards this spot. At the gate\r\nstands “Barney Aaron,” to take the half-penny admission of every one\r\nentering the ground. By his side stands his son with a leather pouch\r\nof half-pence, to give change for any silver that may be tendered.\r\nThe stench of the old clothes is positively overpowering. Every one\r\nthere is dressed in his _worst_. If he has any good clothes he would\r\nnot put them on. Almost each one that enters has a bag at his back,\r\nand scarcely has he passed the gate before he is surrounded by some\r\nhalf dozen eager Jews--one feels the contents of the bundle on the\r\nhuckster’s back--another clamours for the first sight. A third cries,\r\n“I’m sure you have something that’ll suit me.” “You know me,” says\r\na fourth, “I’m a buyer, and give a good price.” “Have you got any\r\nbreaking?” asks this Jew, who wants an old coat or two to cut up into\r\ncloth caps--“Have you got any fustian, any old cords, or old boats?”\r\nAnd such is the anxiety and greediness of the buyers, that it is as\r\nmuch as the seller can do to keep his bundle on his back. At length\r\nhe forces his way to a seat, and as he empties the contents of his\r\nsack on the ground, each different article is snapped up and eagerly\r\noverhauled by the different Jews that have followed him to his seat.\r\nThen they all ask what sum is wanted for the several things, and they,\r\none and all, bid one quarter of the price demanded. I am assured that\r\nit requires the greatest vigilance to prevent the things being carried\r\noff unpaid in the confusion. While this scene is going on, a Jew,\r\nperched upon a high stage in the centre of the ground, shouts aloud\r\nto the multitude, “Hot wine, a half-penny a glass, here.” Beside him\r\nstands another, with smoking cans of hot eels; and next to this one is\r\na sweet-meat stall, with a crowd of Jew boys gathered round the keeper\r\nof it, gambling with marbles for Albert rock and hardbake. Up and down\r\nbetween the seats push women with baskets of sheep’s trotters on their\r\narms, and screaming, “Legs of mutton, two for a penny; who’ll give me a\r\nhandsel--who’ll give me a handsel?” After them comes a man with a large\r\ntin can under his arm, and roaring, “Hot pea, oh! hot pea, oh!” In\r\none corner is a coffee and beer shop. Inside this are Jews playing at\r\ndraughts, or settling and wrangling about the goods they have bought of\r\none another. In fact, in no other place is such a scene of riot, rags,\r\nand filth to be witnessed. The cause of this excitement is the great\r\ndemand on the part of the poor, and the cheap clothiers as well, for\r\nthose articles which are considered as worthless by the rich. The old\r\nshoes are to be cobbled up, and the cracks heel-balled over, and sold\r\nout to the working-classes as strong durable articles. The Wellingtons\r\nare to be new fronted, and disposed of to clerks who are expected\r\nto appear respectable upon the smallest salaries. The old coats and\r\ntrowsers are wanted for the slop-shops; they are to be “turned,” and\r\nmade up into new garments. The best black suits are to be “clobbered”\r\nup--and those which are more worn in parts are to be cut up and made\r\ninto new cloth caps for young gentlemen, or gaiters for poor curates;\r\nwhilst others are to be transformed into the “best boys’ tunics.” Such\r\nas are _too_ far gone are bought to be torn to pieces by the “devil,”\r\nand made up into new cloth--or “shoddy” as it is termed--while such as\r\nhave already done this duty are sold for manure for the ground. The old\r\nshirts, if they are past mending, are bought as “rubbish” by the marine\r\nstore dealers, and sold as rags to the paper-mills, to be changed\r\neither into the bank-note, the newspaper, or the best satin note-paper.\r\n\r\nThe average earnings of the hucksters who exchange crockery, china and\r\nglass for the above articles, are from 8_s._ to 10_s._ per week. Some\r\ndays, I am told, they will make 3_s._, and on others they will get only\r\n6_d._ However, taking the good with the bad, it is thought that 10_s._\r\na week is about a fair average of the earnings of the whole class.\r\nThe best times for this trade are at the turn of the winter, and at\r\nthe summer season, because then people usually purchase new clothes,\r\nand are throwing off the old ones. The average price of an old hat is\r\nfrom 1_d._ to 8_d._; for an old pair of shoes, from 1_d._ to 4_d._;\r\nan old pair of Wellingtons fetch from 3_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ (those of\r\nFrench leather are of scarcely any value). An old coat is worth from\r\n4_d._ to 1_s._; waistcoats are valued from 1_d._ to 3_d._; trowsers are\r\nworth from 4_d._ to 8_d._; cotton gowns are of the same value; bonnets\r\nare of no value whatever; shirts fetch from 2_d._ to 6_d._; stockings\r\nare 1_d._ per pair; a silk handkerchief varies in value from 3_d._ to\r\n1_s._ The party supplying me with the above information was originally\r\nin the coal and greengrocery business, but, owing to a succession of\r\ncalamities, he has been unable to carry it on. Since then he has taken\r\nto the vending of crockery in the streets. He is a man far above the\r\naverage of the class to which he at present belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “SWAG,” CROCKERY, AND GLASS SHOPS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 150 general and particular “swag-shops,” or shops\r\nhaving a large _collection_ of goods, of which I have spoken, there\r\nare twenty establishments for the sale of crockery and china, which I\r\nheard styled by persons in the trade “swag-crocks,” or “crock-shops.”\r\nThe principle on which the trade is conducted in these places is the\r\nsame as that of the swag-shops, inasmuch as the sales are wholesale,\r\nto street-sellers, shop-keepers, and shippers, but rarely to private\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe crock swag-shops are to be found in the streets neighbouring\r\nSpitalfields market, and in and near to Liquorpond-street. As at the\r\nmore general or miscellaneous swag-shops, the crock-swags make no\r\ndisplay. In one of the most extensive, indeed, two large windows are\r\nfilled with goods. Here are spirit-stands, with the invariable three\r\nbottles (invariable in the cheap trade), blue, green, or uncoloured;\r\nsome lettered “gin,” “rum,” “brandy,” but most of them unlabelled.\r\nHere, too, are cruet-stands, and “pot” or spar figures under glass\r\nshades; and a number of many-coloured flower-glasses, some of them\r\nprofusely gilded; and small china vases; but the glass wares greatly\r\npredominate. Although there are glass and colour and gilding enough to\r\nmake “an imposing display,” the display is nevertheless anything but\r\nshowy; the goods look dingy, and, if I may so speak of such things,\r\nfaded. Some of the coloured glass seems to be losing its colour, and\r\nfew of the wares have the bright look of newness.\r\n\r\nThe windows of these shops are, for the most part, literally _packed_\r\nto a certain height, so as almost to exclude the light, with pitchers,\r\nand basins, and cups, and jugs, and the sundry smaller articles of this\r\nmultifarious trade, all undusted, and seemingly uncared for. In one\r\n“large concern” I saw a number of glass salt-cellars wrapped severally\r\nin paper, which had changed from white to a dusty brown, and which from\r\nage, and perhaps damp, seemed about to fall to tatters.\r\n\r\nThe “interiors” of some of these warehouses are very spacious. I saw\r\none large and lofty shop, into which two apartments and a yard had\r\nbeen flung, the partitions having been taken down, and the ceilings\r\nsupported by pillars, in order to “extend the premises.” It was really\r\na hall of pots. On the floor were large crates, the tops removed so\r\nthat the goods might be examined, packed, one with cups, another\r\nwith saucers, a third with basins, and packed as only a potter could\r\npack them. Intermixed with them were piles of blue-and-white dishes\r\nand plates, and, beside them, washing-pans, fitted one into another\r\nlike the old hats on a Jew’s head. The pillars had their festoons of\r\ncrockery, being hung with children’s white and gold mugs “for a good\r\nboy,” and with white metal-lidded and brown-bodied mustard pots, as\r\nwell as other minor articles. The shelves were loaded with tea-services\r\nof many shapes and hues, while the unoccupied space was what sufficed\r\nto allow the warehousemen and the customers to thread the mazes of\r\nthis labyrinth of crockerywares. Of the glass goods there was little\r\ndisplay, as they are generally kept in cases and other packages, to\r\npreserve their freshness of appearance.\r\n\r\nThe crockery of the swag-shops is made in Staffordshire; the glass\r\nprincipally in Lancashire. At none of these establishments do they\r\nissue circulars of prices, such as I have cited of the general\r\nswag-shops. The articles are so very many, I was told, that to specify\r\nall the sizes and prices “would take a volume and a half.” I give a\r\nstatement, however, of the prices of the goods most in demand, on the\r\noccasions when the street vendors sell them without barter, and the\r\nprices at which they are purchased wholesale: Blue-edged plates sold at\r\n1_d._ each cost 1_s._ 8_d._ the dozen; this would appear to entail a\r\nloss of 8_d._ on every dozen sold, but in this article “30 is a dozen.”\r\nDishes are bought at the “swag-crocks” in “nests,” which comprise 10\r\ndishes, or 5 pairs, of different sizes. These the street crockman\r\nsells, if possible, in pairs, but he will sell them singly, for he\r\ncan always make up the complement of his “nest” at the warehouse.\r\nThe prices run, chiefly according to size, from 8_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n(sometimes 1_s._ 8_d._) the pair. “The 8_d._ a pair,” said one street\r\ncrock-seller, “costs me 6_d._, not a farthing under, and the 18_d._ a\r\npair--it’s very seldom we can ‘draw’ 1_s._ 8_d._--costs 1_s._ 2_d._\r\nThat’s all, sir; and the profit’s so small, it makes us keen to swop.\r\nI’ll swop for old clothes, or dripping, or grease, or anything. You\r\nsee the profit, when you sells downright down, _must_ be small, ’cause\r\nthere’s so many pot-shops with prices marked on the plates and other\r\nthings. They can buy better than us sometimes, and they’re hard to\r\nstand up against. If a woman says to me--for I very seldom deal with\r\nmen--‘Why, they’re cheaper at D----’s, in Oxford-street,’--I answers,\r\n‘And worser. I’ll tell you what it is, ma’am. The cheapest place was in\r\ntwo houses, painted all red, in the London-road. But one fine morning\r\nthem two houses fell, and the pots was smashed as a matter of course.\r\nIt was a judgment on their bad pots.’ But it’s a fact, sir, that these\r\nhouses fell, about 7 or 8 years ago, I think, and I’ve seen goods, with\r\none or two of ’em broken, offered for sale when the place was re-built,\r\nhaving been ‘rescued from the ruins; and at less than half price.’ Of\r\ncourse that was gammon. I’ve cracked and broke a few plates, myself,\r\nand sold them in the New Kent-road, and in Walworth and Newington, at\r\nhalf price, from the ruins, and at a very tidy profit.” A stone china\r\ntea-service, of 32 pieces--12 cups, 12 saucers, 4 bread-and-butter\r\nplates, a tea-pot, a sugar-basin, a slop-basin, and a cream-jug--is\r\nbought for 6_s._ 9_d._ while 9_s._ is asked for it, and sometimes\r\nobtained. A “china set” costs, as the general price, 10_s._ 6_d._, and\r\nfor it 14_s._ is asked.\r\n\r\nThe glass wares are so very rarely sold--being the most attractive\r\narticles of barter--that I could hardly get any street-seller to\r\nstate his prices. “Swop, sir,” I was told repeatedly, “they all goes\r\nin swop.” The glass goods, however, which are the most sold in the\r\nstreets, I ascertained to be cream-jugs, those vended at 6_d._ each,\r\ncosting 4_s._ the dozen; and flower-glasses, the most frequent price\r\nbeing 1_s._ a pair, the prime cost 7_d._\r\n\r\nI have estimated the sum turned over by the general swag-shops at\r\n3000_l._ each. From what I can learn, the crock swag-shops, averaging\r\nthe whole, turn over a larger sum, for their profits are smaller,\r\nranging from 10 to 30 per cent., but rarely 30. Calculating, then, that\r\neach of these swag-shops turns over 4000_l._ yearly, we find 80,000_l._\r\nexpended, but this includes the sales to shopkeepers and to shippers,\r\nas well as to street-folk.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SPAR AND CHINA ORNAMENTS, AND OF STONE FRUIT.\r\n\r\n“Spars,” as spar ornaments are called by the street-sellers, are sold\r\nto the retailers at only four places in London, and two in Gravesend\r\n(where the hawkers are for the most part supplied). The London\r\nspar-houses are--two in Westminster, one in Shoreditch, and one on\r\nBattle-bridge. None of them present any display of their goods which\r\nare kept in large drawers, closets, and packages. At Gravesend the\r\nspar-shops are handsome.\r\n\r\nThese wares are principally of Derbyshire spar, and made in Matlock;\r\na few are German. The “spars” are hawked on a round, and are on fine\r\nSaturday nights offered for sale in the street and markets. The trade\r\nwas unknown as a street, or a hawking trade in London, I am informed,\r\nuntil about twenty-five years ago, and then was not extensive, the\r\ngoods, owing to the cost of carriage, &c., being high-priced. As\r\npublic conveyance became more rapid, certain and cheap, the trade in\r\nspars increased, and cheaper articles were prepared for the London\r\nmarket. From ten to fifteen years ago the vendors of spars “did well\r\nin swop” (as street-sellers always call barters). The articles with\r\nwhich they tempted housewives were just the sort of article to which\r\nit was difficult for inexperienced persons to attach a value. They\r\nwere massive and handsome ornaments, and the spar-sellers did not fail\r\nto expatiate on their many beauties. “God rest Jack Moody’s soul,”\r\nsaid an Irishman, now a crock-seller, to me; “Jack Moody was only his\r\nnick-name, but that don’t matter; God rist his sowl and the hivens\r\nbe his bid. He was the boy to sell the spar-r’s. They was from the\r\ncavrents at the bottom of the say, he towld them, or from a new island\r\nin the frozen ocean. He did well; God rist him; but he died young.” The\r\narticles “swopped” were such as I have described in my account of the\r\ntradings of the crock-sellers; and if the “swop” were in favour of the\r\nspar-seller, still the customer became possessed of something solid,\r\nenduring, and generally handsome.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the street or hawking trade, the spar-sellers carried\r\ntheir goods done up in paper, in strong baskets on their heads; the\r\nman’s wife sometimes carrying a smaller basket, with less burdensome\r\narticles, on her arm. Men have been known to start on a round, with a\r\nbasket of spars, which would weigh from 1 cwt. to 1-1/2 cwt. (or 12\r\nstone). This, it must be remembered, might have to be borne for three\r\nor four miles into the suburbs, before its weight was diminished by a\r\nsale. One of these traders told me that twelve years ago he had sold\r\nspar watch-stands, weighing above 15 lbs. These stands were generally\r\nof a square form; the inner portion being open, except a sort of recess\r\nfor the watch. “The tick sounds well on spar, I’ve often heard,” said\r\none spar-seller.\r\n\r\nSome of the spar ornaments are plain, white, and smooth. Of these many\r\nhave flowers, or rims, or insects, painted upon them, and in brilliant\r\ncolours. Those which are now in demand for the street sales, or for\r\nitinerant barterings, are--Small microscopes, candlesticks, inkstands,\r\npin-cushions, mugs, paper-holders, match perfumery, and shaving-boxes,\r\netc. The general price of these articles is 6_d._ to the street-seller\r\nor hawker, some of the dealers being licensed hawkers. The wholesale\r\nprice varies from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._ per dozen; or an average of\r\n3_s._ 9_d._ or 4_s._ Of the larger articles the most saleable are\r\ncandlesticks, at from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ each; from 1_s._ to 1_s._\r\n6_d._ being the most frequent price. Watch-stands and vases are now,\r\nI am told, in small demand. “People’s got stocked, I think,” one man\r\nsaid, “and there’s so much cheap glass and chaney work, that they looks\r\non spars as heavy and old-fashioned.”\r\n\r\nSome street-sellers have their spars in covered barrows, the goods\r\nbeing displayed when the top of the barrow is removed, so that the\r\nconveyance is serviceable whether the owner be stationary or itinerant.\r\nThe spar-sellers, however, are reluctant to expose their goods to the\r\nweather, as the colours are easily affected.\r\n\r\nIn this trade I am informed that there are now twelve men, nine of whom\r\nare assisted by their wives, and that in the summer months there are\r\neighteen. Their profits are about 15_s._ per week on an average of the\r\nwhole year, including the metropolis and a wide range of the suburbs.\r\nWhat amount of money may be expended by the public in the street\r\npurchase of “spars” I am unable to state, so much being done in the way\r\nof barter; but assuming that there are fourteen sellers throughout the\r\nyear, and that their profits are cent. per cent., there would appear to\r\nbe about 1000_l._ per annum thus laid out.\r\n\r\nOf stone fruit there are now usually six street sellers, and in fine\r\nweather eight. Eight or ten years ago there were twenty. The fruit is\r\nprincipally made at Chesterfield in Derbyshire, and is disposed of to\r\nthe London street-sellers in the swag-shops in Houndsditch. Some of the\r\narticles, both as regards form and colour, are well executed; others\r\nare far too red or too green; but that, I was told, pleased children\r\nbest. The most saleable fruits are apples, pears, peaches, apricots,\r\noranges, lemons and cucumbers. The cucumbers, which are sometimes of\r\npot as well as of stone, are often hollow, and are sometimes made to\r\nserve for gin-bottles, holding about a quartern.\r\n\r\nThe price at the swag-shops is 4_s._ 3_d._ for a gross of fruit of\r\nall kinds in equal quantities; for a better quality the price is\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ The street-seller endeavours to get 1_d._ each for the\r\nlower priced, and 2_d._ for the higher, but has most frequently to\r\nbe content with 1/2_d._ and 1_d._ The stone fruitmen are itinerant\r\nduring the week and stationary in the street markets on Saturday, and\r\nsometimes other evenings. They carry their stock both in baskets and\r\nbarrows. One man told me that he always cried, “Pick ’em out! pick ’em\r\nout! Half-penny each! Cheapest fruit ever seen! As good to-morrow as\r\nlast week! Never lose flavour! Ever-lasting fruit.”\r\n\r\nSupposing that there are six persons selling stone fruit in the streets\r\nthrough the year, and that each earns--and I am assured that is the\r\nfull amount--9_s._ weekly (one man said 7_s._ 6_d._ was the limit of\r\nhis weekly profits in fruit), we find 140_l._ received as profit on\r\nthese articles, and calculating the gains at 33 per cent., an outlay of\r\n420_l._\r\n\r\nThe trade in China ornaments somewhat differs from the others I\r\nhave described under the present head. It is both a street and a\r\npublic-house trade, and is carried on both in the regular way and by\r\nmeans of raffles. At some public-houses, indeed, the China ornament\r\ndealers are called “rafflers.”\r\n\r\nThe “ornaments” now most generally sold or raffled are Joy and Grief\r\n(two figures, one laughing and the other crying); dancing Highlanders;\r\nmustard pots in the form of cottages, &c.; grotesque heads, one\r\nespecially of an old man, which serves as a pepper-box, the grains\r\nbeing thrown through the eyes, nose, and mouth; Queen and Alberts (but\r\nnot half so well as the others); and, until of late, Smith O’Briens.\r\nThere are others, also, such as I have mentioned in my account of the\r\ngeneral swag-shops, to the windows of many of which they form the\r\nprincipal furniture. Some of these “ornaments” sold “on the sly” can\r\nhardly be called obscene, but they are dirty, and cannot be further\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe most lucrative part of the trade is in the raffling. A\r\nstreet-seller after doing what business he can, on a round or at a\r\nstand, during the day, will in the evening resort to public-houses,\r\nwhere he is known, and is allowed to offer his wares to the guests.\r\nThe ornaments, in public-house sale, are hardly ever offered for less\r\nthan 6_d._ each, or 6_d._ a pair. The raffling is carried on rapidly\r\nand simply. Dice are very rarely used new, and when used, provoke many\r\nmurmurs from the landlords. The raffler of the China ornaments produces\r\na portable roulette box or table--these tables becoming an established\r\npart of the street traffic--eight or ten inches in diameter. What\r\nmay be called “the board” of some of these “roulettes” is numbered\r\nto thirty-two. It is set rapidly spinning on a pivot, a pea is then\r\nslipped through a hole in the lid of the box, and, when the motion\r\nhas ceased, the pea is found in one of the numbered partitions. “Now,\r\ngentlemen,” a raffler told me he would say, “try your luck for this\r\nbeautiful pair of ornaments; six of you at 1_d._ a piece. If you go\r\nhome rather how came you so, show what you’ve bought for the old lady,\r\nand it’ll be all right and peaceful.” If six persons contribute 1_d._\r\neach, the one “spinning” the highest number gains the prize, and is\r\ncongratulated by the ornament seller on having gained for 1_d._ what\r\nwas only too cheap at 6_d._ “Why, sir,” said a man who had recently\r\nleft the trade for another calling, and who was anxious that I should\r\nnot give any particular description of him, “in case he went back\r\nto the raffling,”--“Why, sir, I remember one Monday evening four or\r\nfive months back, going into a parlour, not a tap-room, mind, where\r\nwas respectable mechanics. They got to play with me, and got keen,\r\nand played until my stock was all gone. If one man stopped raffling,\r\nanother took his place. I can’t recollect how many ornaments I\r\nraffled, but I cleared rather better than 3_s._ 6_d._ When there was\r\nno ornaments left they gave me 1_d._ a piece--there was eleven of them\r\nthen--and a pint of beer to let them have the roulette till 12 o’clock;\r\nand away they went at it for beer and screws, and bets of 1_d._ and\r\n2_d._ One young man that had been lucky in winning the ornaments got\r\ncleaned out, and staked his ornaments for 2_d._, or for a 1_d._ rather\r\nthan not play. That sort of thing only happened to me once, to the same\r\nextent. If the landlord came into the room, of course they was only\r\nplaying for drink, or he might have begun about his licence.”\r\n\r\nThe ornaments are bought at the swag shops I have described, and are\r\nnearly all of German make. They are retailed from 1_d._ and sometimes\r\n1/2_d._ to 1_s._ each, and the profit is from 25 to 75 per cent. There\r\nare, I am informed, about thirty persons in this trade, two-thirds\r\nof them being rafflers, and their receipts being from 25_s._ to\r\n30_s._ weekly. Most of them mix “fancy glass” goods and spars, and\r\nother articles, with their “ornament” trade, so that it is not easy\r\nto ascertain what is expended upon the china ornaments independently\r\nof other wares. If we calculate it at 10_s._ weekly (a low average\r\nconsidering the success of some of the raffles), we find 780_l._\r\nexpended in the streets in these ornamental productions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF TEXTILE FABRICS.\r\n\r\nThese street-folk present perhaps as great a diversity of character as\r\nany of which I have been called upon to treat.\r\n\r\nAmong them are the strong persevering men, who carry rolls of linen\r\nor cotton manufacture in packs on their backs, and trudge along\r\nholding a yard-wand by the middle, which--it is a not uncommon joke\r\nagainst them--is always worn down an inch or two, by being used as a\r\nwalking-stick in their long pedestrian journeys. Such, however, is not\r\nthe case, for the packman--when measuring is resorted to--generally\r\nshows the justice of his measure, or invites the purchaser to use her\r\nown yard-wand (for women are now their most frequent customers). Some\r\nof these men love to tell of the many hundreds of miles they have\r\nwalked in their time, and in the three kingdoms. The most of those\r\nwho make London, or any large town their head-quarters, and take\r\nregular journeys into the country, are licensed hawkers; those who\r\nconfine their sales exclusively to London and its immediate vicinity,\r\nfrequently conduct their business without incurring the annual cost of\r\na licence. The penalty for hawking without a licence is 10_l._, or an\r\nimprisonment (in default of payment) not exceeding three months, with\r\na discretionary power of mitigation to the magistrates. Some of these\r\nmen may be styled hereditary hawkers, having first accompanied and then\r\nsucceeded their parents on a round; some were in their youth assistants\r\nto hawkers; some had been unsuccessful as tallymen when shopkeepers,\r\nor travellers for tally-shops, and have resorted to hawking or\r\nstreet-trading, occasionally, in their transactions with different\r\nparties, blending the tally system with the simple rules of sale for\r\nready money.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to these sturdy and often astute traders are the\r\nstreet-sellers of lace and millinery, the majority of whom are women.\r\nA walk through a street-market, especially on a Saturday evening, will\r\nshow any one the frequent difference of the established street-milliner\r\nto the other female traders surrounding her stall. The milliner,\r\nas she is commonly called by the street-folk, wears a clean, and\r\noften tasty cap, beneath her closely-fitting bonnet, a cap in which\r\nartificial flowers are not wanting, should she sell those adornments.\r\nHer shawl is pinned beneath her collar; her gown, if it be old or of\r\npoor material, is clean; and she is rarely to be seen in boots or\r\nshoes made for men’s wear. Near her stall are stout, coarse-looking\r\nIrish girls, with unstringed bonnets, half-ragged shawls, thrown\r\nloose round their shoulders, necks red from exposure to the weather,\r\ncoarse and never brushed, but sometimes scraped, shoes, when shoes\r\nare worn, and a general dirtiness of apparel. The street-milliners\r\nhave been ladies’-maids, working milliners and dress-makers, the wives\r\nof mechanics who have been driven to the streets, and who add to the\r\nmeans of the family by conducting a street-trade themselves, with a\r\nsprinkling from other classes.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of lace are of the same class as the milliners, but\r\nwith perhaps less smartness, and carrying on an inferior trade both as\r\nregards profit and display.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of boot and stay-laces and of such things as sewing\r\ncotton, threads and tapes, when sold separately from more valuable\r\narticles, are children and old people, some of whom are infirm,\r\nand some blind. The children have, in some instances, been bred to\r\nthe streets; the old people probably are worn out in street-trades\r\nrequiring health and strength, and so adopt a less laborious calling,\r\nor else they have been driven to it, either from comparatively better\r\ncircumstances, or by some privation or affliction, in order to avoid\r\nthe workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe sale of belts, stockings, braces, straps and garters, is mostly\r\nin the hands of men, who, from all that I can learn, are regular\r\nstreet-sellers, who “turn their hands first to this and then to that,”\r\nbut this portion of street-traffic is often combined with the sale\r\nof dog-collars, chains, &c. The trade is more a public-house than a\r\ndistinct traffic in the street. The landlord of a well-frequented\r\ninn in Lambeth told me that every day at least 100 of such\r\nstreet-sellers--not including match-girls and women--entered his house\r\nto offer their wares; the greatest number of such sellers was in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nI have so far described what may be called the fair traders, but to\r\nthem the street-sellers of textile fabrics are not confined. There are\r\nbesides these, two other classes known as “Duffers” and as “Lumpers,”\r\nand sometimes the same man is both “Duffer” and “Lumper.” The two names\r\nare often confounded, but an intelligent street-seller, versed in all\r\nthe arts and mysteries of this trade, told me that he understood by a\r\n“Duffer,” a man who sold goods under false pretences, making out that\r\nthey were smuggled, or even stolen, so as to enhance the idea of their\r\ncheapness; whereas a “Lumper” would sell linens, cottons, or silks,\r\nwhich might be really the commodities represented; but which, by some\r\nmanagement or other, were made to appear new when they were old, or\r\nsolid when they were flimsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HABERDASHERY SWAG-SHOPS.\r\n\r\nBy this name the street-sellers have long distinguished the warehouses,\r\nor rather shops, where they purchase their goods. The term _Swag_, or\r\n_Swack_, or _Sweg_, is, as was before stated, a Scotch word, meaning a\r\nlarge collection, a “lot.” The haberdashery, however, supplied by these\r\nestablishments is of a very miscellaneous character; which, perhaps,\r\ncan best be shown by describing a “haberdashery swag,” to which a\r\nstreet-seller, who made his purchases there, conducted me, and which,\r\nhe informed me, was one of the most frequented by his fraternity, if\r\nnot _the_ most frequented, in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe window was neither dingy, nor, as my companion expressed it, “gay.”\r\nIt was in size, as well as in “dressing,” or “show”--for I heard the\r\narrangement of the window goods called by both those names by street\r\npeople--half-way between the quiet plainness of a really wholesale\r\nwarehouse, and the gorgeousness of a retail drapery concern, when a\r\n“tremendous sacrifice” befools the public. Not a quarter of an inch\r\nof space was lost, and the announcements and prices were written many\r\nof them in a bungling school-boy-like hand, while others were the\r\nwork of a professional “ticket writer,” and show the eagerness of so\r\nmany of this class of trade to obtain custom. In one corner was this\r\nannouncement: “To boot-makers. Boot fronts cut to any size or quality.”\r\nThere was neither boot nor shoe visible, but how a boot front _can be_\r\ncut “to any quality,” is beyond my trade knowledge. Half hidden, and\r\nread through laces, was another announcement, sufficiently odd, in a\r\nwindow decorated with a variety of combustible commodities: “Hawkers\r\nsupplied with fuzees cheaper than any house in London.” On the “ledge,”\r\nor the part shelving from the bottom of the window, within the shop,\r\nwere paper boxes of steel purses with the price marked so loosely as\r\nto leave it an open question whether 1_s._ 0-3/4_d._ or 10-3/4_d._ was\r\nthe cost. There was also a good store of silk purses, marked 2-1/2_d._;\r\nbright-coloured ribbons, in a paper box, and done up in small rolls,\r\n1-1/2_d._; cotton reels, four a penny; worsted balls, three a\r\npenny; girls’ night-caps, 1-3/4_d._; women’s caps, from 2-3/4_d._ to\r\n7-3/4_d._; (the 3/4_d._ was always in small indistinct characters, but\r\nit was a very favourite adjunct); diamond patent mixed pins--London\r\nand Birmingham--1_d._ an oz. My companion directed my attention to the\r\nlittle packets of pins: “They’re well done up, sir, as you can see,\r\nand in very good and thick and strong pink papers, with ornamental\r\nprinters’ borders, and plenty of paper for three ounces. The paper’s\r\nweighed with the pins, and the price is 1_d._ an oz.; so the paper\r\nfetches 1_s._ 4_d._ a pound.” There were also many papers of combs, and\r\none tied outside the packet as a specimen, without a price marked upon\r\nthem. “The price varies, sir;” said my guide and informant, and I heard\r\nthe same account from others; “it varies from 1_d._ a pair to such as\r\nme; up to 6_d._ or perhaps 1_s._ to a servant-maid what looks innocent.”\r\n\r\nFrom what appeared to be slender rods fitted higher up to the breadth\r\nof the window depended “black lace handkerchiefs, 4-3/4_d._;” and\r\ncap fronts, some being a round wreath of gauze ornamented with light\r\nrose-coloured artificial flowers, and marked “only 5-1/2_d._;” together\r\nwith lace (or edgings) which hung in festoons, and filled every\r\nvacancy. Higher up were braces marked 5_d._; and more lace; and to\r\nthe back of all was a sort of screen--for it shuts out all view of\r\nthe inside of the shop--of big-figured shawls (the figures in purple,\r\norange, and crimson) and of silk handkerchiefs: “They’re regular\r\nduffers,” I was told, “and very tidy duffers too--very, for it’s a\r\nrespectable house.”\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the window ledge was a handsome wreath of artificial\r\nflowers, marked 2-1/2_d._ “If a young woman was to go in to buy it at\r\n2-1/2_d._, I’ve seen it myself, sir,” said the street-seller “she’s\r\ntold that the ticket has got out of its place, for it belonged to the\r\nlace beneath, but as she’d made a mistake without thinking of the\r\nvalue, the flowers was 1_s._ 6_d._ to her, though they was cheap at\r\n2_s._ 6_d._”\r\n\r\nFrom this account it will be seen that the swag or wholesale\r\nhaberdashers are now very general traders; and that they trade “retail”\r\nas well as “wholesale.” Twenty or twenty-five years ago, I am informed,\r\nthe greater part of these establishments were really haberdashery\r\nswags; but so fierce became the competition in the trade, so keen the\r\ndesire “to do business,” that gradually, and more especially within\r\nthese four or five years, they became “all kinds of swags.”\r\n\r\nA highly respectable draper told me that he never could thoroughly\r\nunderstand where hosiery, haberdashery, or drapery, began or ended; for\r\nhosiers now were always glovers, and often shirt-makers; haberdashers\r\nwere always hosiers (at the least), and drapers were everything;\r\nso that the change in the character of the shops from which the\r\nstreet-sellers of textile fabrics procure their supplies, is but in\r\naccordance with the change in the general drapery trade. The literal\r\nmeaning of the word haberdashery is unknown to etymologists.\r\n\r\nThere are now about fifty haberdashery swags resorted to by\r\nstreet-sellers, but only a fifth part of them make the trade to\r\nstreet-sellers a principal, while none make it a sole feature of\r\ntheir business. In the enumeration of the fifty haberdashery “swags,”\r\nfive are large and handsome shops carried on by “cutting” drapers.\r\nSome of these--one in the borough, especially--do not “serve” the\r\nstreet-sellers, except at certain hours, generally from four to six.\r\n\r\nThere is another description of shops from which a class of street\r\ntraders derive their supplies of stock. These are the “print-brokers,”\r\nwho sell “gown-pieces” to the hawkers or street-traders. Only\r\nabout a dozen of such shops, and those principally in the borough\r\nand in Wormwood-street, Bishopsgate, are frequented by the London\r\nstreet-sellers. One man showed me a draper’s shop, at which hawkers\r\nwere “supplied,” but without an announcement of such a thing, as\r\nit might affect the character of the concern for gentility. The\r\ngown-pieces were rolled loosely together, and to each was attached\r\na ticket, 2_s._ 11_d._ or 3_s._ 11_d._, with intermediate prices,\r\nbut those here mentioned were the most frequent. The 11_d._ was in\r\npencil, so that it could be altered at any time, without the expense\r\nof a new ticket being incurred. “That one marked 2_s._ 11_d._,”\r\nsaid the street-seller, “would be charged to me 2_s._ 2_d._, and\r\nthe 3_s._ 11_d._ in the same way 3_s._ 2_d._, or I might get it at\r\n3_s._ If those gown-pieces don’t take--and they are almost as thin as\r\nsilver-paper,--they’ll be marked down to 2_s._ 2_d._ and 3_s._ 2_d._,\r\njust by degrees, as you see them shown in the window.” The regular\r\n“print-brokers” make no display in their windows or premises.\r\n\r\nThe “duffers” and “lumpers” are supplied almost entirely at one shop\r\nin the east end. The proprietor has the sham, or inferior, silk\r\nhandkerchiefs manufactured for the purpose; and for the supply of his\r\nother silk-goods, he purchases any silk “miscoloured” in the dyeing,\r\nor faded from time. “A faded lavender,” one of his customers told me,\r\n“he’ll get dyed black, and made to look quite new and fresh. Sometimes\r\nit’s good silk, but it’s mostly very dicky.” This tradesman is also a\r\nretailer.\r\n\r\nSuch things as braces and garters are sold to the street people at the\r\ngeneral as well as the haberdashery swag-shops; and are more frequently\r\nsold wholesale than other goods; indeed the general swag-shop keepers\r\nsell them by no other way; but the “wholesale haberdashers” will sell\r\na single pair, though not, of course, at wholesale price. Some houses\r\nagain supply the more petty street-sellers, solely with such articles\r\nas are known in Manchester by the name of small-ware, including thread,\r\ncotton, tapes, laces, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF HAWKERS, PEDLARS, AND PETTY CHAPMEN.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for the distribution of commodities has, in this and in\r\nall other “progressive” countries, necessarily undergone many changes;\r\nbut whether these changes have been beneficial to the community, or\r\nnot, this is not the place for me to inquire; all I have to do here is\r\nto set forth the order of such changes, and to show the position that\r\nthe hawker and pedlar formerly occupied in the state.\r\n\r\nThe “distributor” of the produce of the country is necessarily a\r\nkind of go-between, or middleman, introduced for the convenience of\r\nbringing together the producer and consumer--the seller and the buyer\r\nof commodities. The producer of a particular commodity being generally\r\ndistinct from the consumer, it follows, that either the commodity must\r\nbe carried to the consumer, or the consumer go to the commodity. To\r\nsave time and trouble to both parties, it seems to have been originally\r\narranged that producer and consumer should meet, periodically, at\r\nappointed places. Such periodical meetings of buyers and sellers still\r\nexist in this and many other countries, and are termed either fairs or\r\nmarkets, according as they are held at long or short intervals--the\r\nfair being generally an annual meeting, and the market a weekly one.\r\nIn the olden time the peculiar characteristic of these commercial\r\ncongregations was, that the producer and consumer came into immediate\r\ncontact, without the intervention of any middleman. The fair or market\r\nseemed to be a compromise between the two, as to the inconvenience of\r\neither finding the other when wanted. The producer brought his goods,\r\nso to speak, half way to the consumer, while the consumer travelled\r\nhalf way to the goods. “There would be a great waste of time and\r\ntrouble,” says Stewart Mill, “and an inconvenience often amounting to\r\nimpracticability, if consumers could only obtain the article they want\r\nby treating directly with the producers. Both producers and consumers\r\nare too much scattered, and the latter often at too great a distance\r\nfrom the former.”\r\n\r\n“To diminish this loss of time and labour,” continues Mr. Mill,\r\n“the contrivance of fairs and markets was early had recourse to,\r\nwhere consumers and producers might periodically meet, without any\r\nintermediate agency; and this plan still answers tolerably well for\r\nmany articles, especially agricultural produce--agriculturists having\r\nat some seasons a certain quantity of spare time on their hands.\r\nBut even in this case, attendance is often very troublesome and\r\ninconvenient to buyers who have other occupations, and do not live in\r\nthe immediate vicinity; while, for all articles the production of which\r\nrequires continuous attention from the producers, these periodical\r\nmarkets must be held at such considerable intervals, and the wants of\r\nthe consumers must either be provided for so long beforehand, or must\r\nremain so long unsupplied, that even before the resources of society\r\npermitted the establishment of shops, the supply of those wants fell\r\nuniversally into the hands of _itinerant dealers_, the pedlars who\r\nmight appear once a month, being preferred to the fair, which only\r\nreturned once a year. In country districts, remote from towns or large\r\nvillages, the vocation of the pedlar is not yet wholly superseded.\r\nBut a dealer who has a fixed abode, and fixed customers,” continues\r\nMr. Mill, “is so much more to be depended on, that customers prefer\r\nresorting to him, if he is conveniently accessible; and dealers,\r\ntherefore, find their advantage in establishing themselves in every\r\nlocality where there are sufficient consumers near at hand to afford\r\nthem remuneration.”\r\n\r\nThus we see that the pedlar was the original distributor of the produce\r\nof the country--the primitive middleman, as well as the prime mover\r\nin extending the markets of particular localities, or for particular\r\ncommodities. He was, as it were, the first “free-trader;” increasing\r\nthe facilities for the interchange of commodities, without regard\r\nto market dues or tolls, and carrying the natural advantages of\r\nparticular districts to remote and less favoured places; thus enabling\r\neach locality to produce that special commodity for which it had the\r\ngreatest natural convenience, and exchanging it for the peculiar\r\nproduce of other parts.\r\n\r\nNow, this extension of the markets necessarily involved some machinery\r\nfor the conveyance of the goods from one district to another. Hence,\r\nthe pedlar was not only the original merchant, but the primitive\r\ncarrier--to whom, perhaps, we owe both our turnpike-roads and railways.\r\nFor, since the peculiar characteristic of the pedlar was the carrying\r\nthe produce to the consumer, rather than troubling the consumer to go\r\nafter the produce, of course it soon became necessary, as the practice\r\nincreased, and increased quantities of goods had to be conveyed from\r\none part of the country to another, that increased facilities of\r\ntransit should be effected. The first change was from the pack-_man_ to\r\nthe pack-_horse_: for the former a foot-way alone was required; while\r\nthe latter necessitated the formation of some kind of a road. Some of\r\nthese ancient pack-horse roads existed till within these few years.\r\nHagbush-lane, which was described by William Hone only twenty years\r\nago, but which has now vanished, was the ancient bridle or pack-horse\r\nroad from London to the North, and extended by the Holloway back road\r\nas far as the City-road, near Old-street. “Some parts of Hagbush-lane,”\r\nsays Hone, “are much lower than the meadows on either side.” At one\r\ntime a terraced ridge, at another a deep rut, the pack-horse road must\r\nhave been to the unaccustomed traveller a somewhat perilous pass.\r\nThe historian of Craven, speaking of 1609, says, “At this time the\r\ncommunication between the north of England and the Universities was\r\nkept up by the carriers, who pursued their long but uniform route\r\nwith trains of pack-horses. To their care were consigned packages,\r\nand not unfrequently the persons of young scholars. It was through\r\ntheir medium, also, that epistolary correspondence was managed; and\r\nas they always visited London, a letter could scarcely be exchanged\r\nbetween Yorkshire and Oxford in less time than a month.” The General\r\nPost Office was established by Act of Parliament in the year 1660, and\r\nall letters were to be sent through this office, “except such letters\r\nas shall be sent by coaches, common-known carriers of goods by carts,\r\nwaggons, and pack-horses, and shall be carried along with their carts,\r\nwaggons, and pack-horses respectively.”\r\n\r\n“There is no such conveyance as a waggon in this country” (Scotland),\r\nsays Roderick Random, referring to the beginning of the last century,\r\n“and my finances were too weak to support the expense of hiring a\r\nhorse. I determined therefore to set out with the carriers, who\r\ntransport goods from one place to another on horseback; and this scheme\r\nI accordingly put in execution on the 1st day of November, 1739,\r\nsitting on a pack-saddle between two baskets, one of which contained my\r\ngoods in a knapsack. But by the time we arrived at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\r\nI was so fatigued with the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed\r\nwith the coldness of the weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of\r\nmy journey on foot, rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.”\r\n\r\nThe present mode of travelling, compared with that of the pack-horse\r\nmeans of conveyance as pursued of old, forms one of the most striking\r\ncontrasts, perhaps, in all history.\r\n\r\nHence we see that the pedlar was originally both carrier and seller;\r\nfirst conveying his pack on his back, and then, as it increased in\r\nbulk, transferring it to the back of “the pack-horse.” But as soon\r\nas the practice of conveying the commodities to the buyers, instead\r\nof compelling the buyers to go to the commodities, was found to be\r\nadvantageous to both consumer and producer, it was deemed expedient\r\nthat the two distinct processes of carriage and sale, which are\r\nincluded in the distribution of commodities, should be conducted by\r\ndistinct persons, and hence the carrying and selling of goods became\r\nseparate vocations in the State; and such is now the machinery by\r\nwhich the commodities of different parts of this country, as well as\r\nof others, are at present diffused over the greater portion of this\r\nkingdom. In remote districts however, and the poorer neighbourhoods\r\nof large towns, where there are either too few consumers, or too few\r\ncommodities required now to support a fixed distributor with a distinct\r\napparatus of transit, the pedlar still continues to be the sole means\r\nof diffusing the produce of one locality among the inhabitants of\r\nanother; and it is in this light--as the poor man’s merchant--that we\r\nmust here consider him.\r\n\r\nAmong the more ancient of the trades, then, carried on in England\r\nis that of the hawker or pedlar. It is generally considered, as I\r\nsaid before, that hawking “is as ancient a mode of trade as that\r\ncarried on in fairs and markets, towns and villages, as well as at\r\nthe castles of the nobles or the cottages of their retainers.” To\r\nfix the origin of fairs is impossible, for, in ancient and mediæval\r\ntimes, every great gathering was necessarily a fair. Men--whom it\r\nis no violence to language to call “hawkers”--resorted alike to the\r\nOlympic games and to the festivals of the early Christian saints, to\r\nsell or barter their wares. Of our English fairs Mr. Jacob says, in\r\nhis “Law Dictionary”--“Various privileges have been annexed to them,\r\nand numerous facilities afforded to the disposal of property in them.\r\nTo give them a greater degree of solemnity, they were originally, both\r\nin the ancient and modern world, associated with religious festivals.\r\nIn most places, indeed, they are still held on the same day with the\r\nwake or feast of the saint to whom the church is dedicated; and till\r\nthe practice was prohibited, it was customary in England to hold them\r\nin churchyards. This practice, I may add, was not fully prohibited\r\nuntil the reign of Charles II., although it had long before fallen into\r\ndisuse. Thus the connection between church and market is shown to be of\r\nvenerable antiquity.”\r\n\r\nThe hawker dealt, in the old times, more in textile fabrics than in\r\nanything else. Indeed, Shakspere has dashed off a catalogue of his\r\nwares, in the song of _Autolycus_:\r\n\r\n  “Lawn as white as driven snow,\r\n  Cyprus black as e’er was crow.”\r\n\r\nIn the reigns succeeding the termination of the Wars of the Roses, and\r\ndown to the Commonwealth, the hawker’s pack was often stocked with\r\ncostly goods; for great magnificence in dress was then the custom of\r\nthe wealthy, and even the burgesses on public occasions wore velvet,\r\nfine cambric ruffs, and furs. The hawker was thus often a man of\r\nsubstance and frequently travelled on horseback, with his wares slung\r\nin bags on his horse’s side, or fitted to the crupper or pommell of his\r\nsaddle. He was often, moreover, attended by a man, both for help in his\r\nsales, and protection in travelling. In process of time an established\r\nhawker became the medium of news and of gossip, and frequently the\r\nbearer of communications from town to town. His profits were often\r\ngreat, but no little trust seems to have been reposed in him as to\r\nthe quality and price of his goods; and, until the present century or\r\nso, slop goods were little manufactured, so that he could not so well\r\npractise deceptions. Neither, during the prosperity of the trade, does\r\nit appear that any great degree of dishonesty characterized the hawker,\r\nthough to this there were of course plenty of minor exceptions as well\r\nas one glaring contradiction. The wreckers of our southern coasts, who\r\nsometimes became possessed of rich silks, velvets, laces, &c.--(not\r\nunfrequently murdering all the mariners cast on shore, and there was\r\na convenient superstition among the wreckers, that it was unlucky to\r\noffer help to a drowning man)--disposed of much of their plunder to\r\nthe hawkers; and as communication was slow, even down to Mr. Palmer’s\r\nimprovements in the Post Office in 1784, the goods thus rescued from\r\nthe deep, or obtained by the murder of the mariners, were disposed of\r\neven before the loss of the vessel was known at her destination; for we\r\nare told that there was generally a hawker awaiting a wreck on the most\r\ndangerous shores of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, and Sussex.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century, and for the first ten years of the present,\r\nthe hawker’s was a profitable calling. He usually in later times\r\ntravelled with horse and covered cart, visiting fairs, markets, and\r\nprivate houses, more especially in the country. In some parts the\r\ncalling was somewhat hereditary, son succeeding to father after having\r\nofficiated as his assistant, and so becoming known to the customers.\r\nThe most successful of the class, alike on both sides of the border,\r\nwere Scotchmen.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the prosperity of this trade experienced a check. In that\r\nyear “every hawker, pedlar, or petty chapman going from town to town,\r\nor to other men’s houses, and travelling on foot, carrying to sell\r\nor exposing for sale any goods” was required to pay a yearly licence\r\nof 4_l._, with an additional 4_l._ for every horse, ass, or mule,\r\nused in the business. Nothing, however, in the Act in question, 50\r\nGeo. III. c. 41, as I have before intimated, “extended to prohibit”\r\nthe hawking for sale of “any fish, fruit, or victuals” without\r\nlicence. Neither is there any extension of the prohibition to the\r\nunlicensed workers or makers of any goods or wares, or their children\r\nor servants resident with them, hawking such goods, and selling them\r\n“in every city, borough, town corporate, or market town,” but not in\r\nvillages or country places. “Tinkers, coopers, glaziers, plumbers,\r\nand harness-menders,” are likewise permitted to carry about with them\r\nthe proper materials necessary for their business, no licence being\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe passing of this Act did not materially check the fraudulent\r\npractices of which the hawkers were accused, and of which a portion\r\nof them were doubtlessly guilty; indeed some of the manufacturers,\r\nwhose names were pirated by the hawkers, were of opinion that the\r\nlicensing for ten or twenty years facilitated fraud, as many people,\r\nboth in London and the country, thought they were safe in dealing with\r\na “licensed” hawker, since he could not procure a licence without a\r\ncertificate of his good character from the clergyman of his place of\r\nresidence, and from two “reputable inhabitants.” Linen of good quality\r\nused to be extensively hawked, but from 1820 to 1825, or later in\r\nsome parts, the hawkers got to deal in an inferior quality, “unions”\r\n(a mixture of linen and cotton), glazed and stiffened, and set off\r\nwith gaudy labels bearing sometimes the name of a well-known firm,\r\nbut altered in spelling or otherwise, and expressed so as to lead to\r\nthe belief that such a firm were the manufacturers of the article.\r\nJews, moreover, as we have seen, travelled in all parts with inferior\r\nwatches and jewellery, and sometimes “did well” by persuading the\r\npossessors of old solid watches, or old seals or jewellery, that they\r\nwere ridiculously out of fashion, and so inducing them to give money\r\nalong with the old watch for a watch or other article of the newest\r\nfashion, which yet was intrinsically valueless compared with the other.\r\nThese and other practices, such as selling inferior lace under pretence\r\nof its having been smuggled from France, and of the choicest quality,\r\ntended to bring the hawker’s trade into disrepute, and the disrepute\r\naffected the honest men in the business. Some sank from the possession\r\nof a good horse and cart to travelling on foot, as of yore, forwarding\r\ngoods from place to place by the common carriers, and some relinquished\r\nthe itinerant trade altogether. The “cutting” and puffing shopkeepers\r\nappeared next, and at once undersold the “slop” hawker, and foiled\r\nhim on his own ground of pushing off inferior wares for the best. The\r\nnumbers of the hawkers fell off considerably, but notwithstanding I\r\nfind, in the last census tables (1841), the following returns as to the\r\nnumbers of “hawkers, hucksters, and pedlars,” distributed throughout\r\nGreat Britain. The Government returns, however, admit of no comparison\r\nbeing formed between these numbers and those of any previous time.\r\n\r\n    ENGLAND AND WALES.\r\n  Bedford               79\r\n  Berks                160\r\n  Bucks                129\r\n  Cambridge            139\r\n  Chester              362\r\n  Cornwall             175\r\n  Cumberland           217\r\n  Derby                427\r\n  Devon                230\r\n  Dorset                97\r\n  Durham               301\r\n  Essex                339\r\n  Gloucester           437\r\n  Hereford              44\r\n  Hertford             137\r\n  Huntingdon            45\r\n  Kent                 284\r\n  Lancaster           1862\r\n  Leicester            292\r\n  Lincoln              435\r\n  Middlesex           1597\r\n  Monmouth             163\r\n  Norfolk              431\r\n  Northampton          214\r\n  Northumberland       426\r\n  Nottingham           267\r\n  Oxford                94\r\n  Rutland               23\r\n  Salop                240\r\n  Somerset             201\r\n  Southampton          226\r\n  Stafford             472\r\n  Suffolk              288\r\n  Surrey               609\r\n  Sussex               238\r\n  Warwick              476\r\n  Westmorland           44\r\n  Wilts                109\r\n  Worcester            247\r\n  City of York          63\r\n  East Riding of York  200\r\n  North Riding         187\r\n  West Riding         1039\r\n                    ------\r\n                    14,038\r\n\r\n         WALES.\r\n  Anglesey              14\r\n  Brecon                63\r\n  Cardigan              38\r\n  Carmarthen            49\r\n  Carnarvon             32\r\n  Denbigh               69\r\n  Flint                 35\r\n  Glamorgan            202\r\n  Merioneth             25\r\n  Montgomery            31\r\n  Pembroke              46\r\n  Radnor                20\r\n                       ---\r\n                       624\r\n\r\n  Island in the\r\n    British Seas        47\r\n\r\n       SCOTLAND.\r\n  Aberdeen             105\r\n  Argyll                44\r\n  Ayr                  144\r\n  Banff                 33\r\n  Berwick               41\r\n  Bute                  17\r\n  Caithness              4\r\n  Clackmannan           18\r\n  Dumbarton             29\r\n  Dumfries              72\r\n  Edinburgh            401\r\n  Elgin, or Moray       37\r\n  Fife                  77\r\n  Forfar               108\r\n  Haddington            54\r\n  Inverness             33\r\n  Kincardine            27\r\n  Kinross                9\r\n  Kirkcudbright         46\r\n  Lanark               677\r\n  Linlithgow            33\r\n  Nairn                  2\r\n  Orkney and Shetland   10\r\n  Peebles               13\r\n  Perth                119\r\n  Renfrew              107\r\n  Ross and Cromarty     11\r\n  Roxburgh              96\r\n  Selkirk               18\r\n  Stirling              95\r\n  Sutherland             5\r\n  Wigtown               36\r\n                      ----\r\n                      2561\r\n\r\nThus we find that, in 1841, there were of these trades in\r\n\r\n  England                     14,038\r\n  Wales                          624\r\n  British Isles                   47\r\n  Scotland                     2,561\r\n                              ------\r\n    Total in Great Britain    17,270\r\n\r\nThe counties in which the hawkers, hucksters, and pedlars most abound\r\nappear to be--1st, Lancaster; 2nd, Middlesex; 3rd, Yorkshire (West\r\nRiding); 4th, Lanark; and 5th, Surrey.\r\n\r\nWhat rule, if any rule, was observed in classing these “hawkers,\r\nhucksters, and pedlars,” or what distinction was drawn between a hawker\r\nand a huckster, I am unable to say, but it is certain that the number\r\nof “licensed hawkers” was within one-half of the 17,270; for, in 1841,\r\nthe hawkers’ duty realized only 32,762_l._ gross revenue, and waiving\r\nthe amount paid for the employment of horses, &c., the official return,\r\nreckoning so many persons paying 4_l._ each, shows only 8190 licensed\r\nhawkers in 1841.\r\n\r\nThe hawker’s business has been prosecuted far more extensively in\r\ncountry than in town, but he still continues to deal in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PACKMEN, OR HAWKERS OF SOFT WARES.\r\n\r\nThe packman, as he is termed, derives his name from carrying his\r\nmerchandise or pack upon his back. These itinerant distributors are\r\nfar less numerous than they were twenty or twenty-five years since.\r\nA few years since, they were mostly Irishmen, and their principal\r\nmerchandise, Irish linens--a fabric not so generally worn now as it was\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nThe packmen are sometimes called Manchester-men. These are the men\r\nwhom I have described as the sellers of shirtings, sheetings, &c. One\r\nman, who was lately an assistant in the trade, could reckon twenty men\r\nwho were possessed of good stocks, good connections, and who had saved\r\nmoney. They traded in an honourable manner, were well known, and much\r\nrespected. The majority of them were natives of the north of Ireland,\r\nand two had been linen manufacturers. It is common, indeed, for all the\r\nIrishmen in this trade to represent themselves as having been connected\r\nwith the linen manufacture in Belfast.\r\n\r\nThis trade is now becoming almost entirely a country trade. There are\r\nat present, I am told, only five pursuing it in London, none of them\r\nhaving a very extensive connection, so that only a brief notice is\r\nnecessary. Their sale is of both cottons and linens for shirts. They\r\ncarry them in rolls of 36 yards, or in smaller rolls, each of a dozen\r\nyards, and purchase them at the haberdashery swag-shops, at from 9_d._\r\nto 18_d._ a yard. I now speak of good articles. Their profits are\r\nnot very large--as for the dozen yards, which cost them 9_s._, they\r\noften have a difficulty in getting 12_s._--while in street-sale, or in\r\nhawking from house to house, there is great delay. A well-furnished\r\npack weighs about one cwt., and so necessitates frequent stoppages.\r\nCotton, for sheetings, is sold in the same manner, costing the vendors\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._ a yard.\r\n\r\nOf the tricks of the trade, and of the tally system of one of these\r\nchapmen, I had the following account from a man who had been, both as\r\nprincipal and assistant, a travelling packman, but was best acquainted\r\nwith the trade in and about London.\r\n\r\n“My master,” he said, “was an Irishman, and told everybody he had been\r\na manager of a linen factory in Belfast. I believe he was brought up to\r\nbe a shoemaker, and was never in the north of Ireland. Anyhow, he was\r\nvery shy of talking about Irish factories to Irish gentlemen. I heard\r\none say to him, ‘Don’t tell me, you have the Cork brogue.’ I know he’d\r\ngot some knowledge of linen weaving at Dundee, and could talk about\r\nit very clever; indeed he was a clever fellow. Sometimes, to hear him\r\ntalk, you’d think he was quite a religious man, and at others that he\r\nwas a big blackguard. It wasn’t drink that made the difference, for he\r\nwas no drinker. It’s a great thing on a round to get a man or woman\r\ninto a cheerful talk, and put in a joke or two; and that he could do,\r\nto rights. I had 12_s._ a week, standing wages, from him, and bits of\r\ncommissions on sales that brought me from 3_s._ to 5_s._ more. He was\r\na buyer of damaged goods, and we used to ‘doctor’ them. In some there\r\nwas perhaps damages by two or three threads being out all the way, so\r\nthe manufacturers wouldn’t send them to their regular customers. My\r\nmaster pretended it was a secret where he got them, but, lord, I knew;\r\nit was at a swag-shop. We used to cut up these in twelves (twelve\r\nyards), sometimes less if they was very bad, and take a Congreve, and\r\njust scorch them here and there, where the flaws was worst, and plaster\r\nover other flaws with a little flour and dust, to look like a stain\r\nfrom street water from the fire-engine. Then they were from the stock\r\nof Mr. Anybody, the great draper, that had his premises burnt down--in\r\nManchester or Glasgow, or London--if there’d been a good fire at a\r\ndraper’s--or anywhere; we wasn’t particular. They was fine or strong\r\nshirtings, he’d say--and so they was, the sound parts of them--and he’d\r\nsell as cheap as common calico. I’ve heard him say, ‘Why, marm, sure\r\nmarm, with your eyes and scissors and needle, them burns--ah! fire’s a\r\ndreadful judgment on a man--isn’t the least morsel of matter in life.\r\nThe stains is cured in a wash-tub in no time. It’s only _touched_ by\r\nthe fire, and you can humour it, I know, in cutting out as a shirt\r\nought to be cut; it should be as carefully done as a coat.’ Then we\r\nhad an Irish linen, an imitation, you know, a kind of ‘Union,’ which\r\nwe call double twist. It is made, I believe, in Manchester, and is a\r\nmixture of linen and cotton. Some of it’s so good that it takes a judge\r\nto tell the difference between it and real Irish. He got some beautiful\r\nstuff at one time, and once sold to a fine-dressed young woman in\r\nBrompton, a dozen yards, at 2_s._ 6_d._ a yard, and the dozen only\r\ncost him 14_s._ Then we did something on tally, but he was dropping\r\nthat trade. The shopkeepers undersold him. ‘If you get 60_l._ out of\r\n100_l._, in tally scores,’ he often said, ‘it’s good money, and a fair\r\nliving profit;’ but he got far more than that. What was worth 8_s._\r\nwas 18_s._ on tally, pay 1_s._ a week. He did most that way with the\r\nmasters of coffee-shops and the landlords of little public-houses.\r\nSometimes, if they couldn’t pay, we’d have dinner, and that went to\r\naccount, and he’d quarrel with me after it for what was my share.\r\nThere’s not much of this sort of trade now, sir. I believe my old\r\nmaster got his money together and emigrated.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want any ginuine Irish linin, ma’am?” uttered in unmistakable\r\nbrogue, seemed to authenticate the fact, that the inquirer (being an\r\nIrishman) in all likelihood possessed the legitimate article; but as\r\nto their obtaining their goods from Coleraine and other places in the\r\nEmerald Isle, famed for the manufacture of linen, it was and is as pure\r\nfiction as the Travels of Baron Munchausen.\r\n\r\nThe majority of these packmen have discontinued dealing in linens\r\nexclusively, and have added silks, ladies’ dresses, shawls and various\r\narticles connected with the drapery business. The country, and small\r\ntowns and villages, remote from the neighbourhood of large and showy\r\nshops, are the likeliest markets for the sale of their goods. In\r\nLondon the Irish packmen have been completely driven out by the Scotch\r\ntallymen, who indeed are the only class of packmen likely to succeed\r\nin London. If the persevering Scotch tallyman can but set foot in a\r\ndecent-looking residence, and be permitted to display his tempting\r\nfinery to the “lady of the house,” he generally manages to talk her\r\ninto purchasing articles that perhaps she has no great occasion for,\r\nand which serve often to involve her in difficulties for a considerable\r\nperiod--causing her no little perplexity, and requiring much artifice\r\nto keep the tallyman’s weekly visits a secret from her husband--to say\r\nnothing of paying an enormous price for the goods; for the many risks\r\nwhich the tallyman incurs, necessitates of course an exorbitant rate of\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n“The number of packmen or hawkers of shawls, silks, &c., I think”\r\n(says one of their own body) “must have decreased full one-half\r\nwithin the last few years. The itinerant haberdashery trade is far\r\nfrom the profitable business that it used to be, and not unfrequently\r\ndo I travel a whole day without taking a shilling: still, perhaps,\r\none day’s good work will make up for half a dozen bad ones. All the\r\npackmen have hawkers’ licences, as they have mostly too valuable a\r\nstock to incur the risk of losing it for want of such a privilege.\r\nSome of the fraternity” (says my informant) “do not always deal ‘upon\r\nthe square;’ they profess to have just come from India or China, and\r\nto have invested all their capital in silks of a superior description\r\nmanufactured in those countries, and to have got them on shore\r\n‘unbeknown to the Custom-house authorities.’ This is told in confidence\r\nto the servant-man or woman who opens the door--‘be so good as tell the\r\nlady as much,’ says the hawker, ‘for really I’m afraid to carry the\r\ngoods much longer, and I have already sold enough to pay me well enough\r\nfor my spec--go, there’s a good girl, tell your missus I have splendid\r\ngoods, and am willing almost to give them away, and if we makes a deal\r\nof it, why I don’t mind giving you a handsome present for yourself.’”\r\nThis is a bait not to be resisted. Should the salesman succeed with the\r\nmistress, he carries out his promise to the maid by presenting her with\r\na cap ribbon, or a cheap neckerchief.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive kind of packmen, or hawkers of soft-wares, who still\r\nform part of the distributing machinery of the country, traverse the\r\nhighlands of Scotland. They have their regular rounds, and regular\r\ndays of visiting their customers; their arrival is looked for with\r\ninterest by the country people; and the inmates of the farm-house\r\nwhere they locate for the night consider themselves fortunate in\r\nhaving to entertain the packman; for he is their newsmonger, their\r\nstory-teller, their friend, and their acquaintance, and is always\r\nmade welcome. His wares consist of hose--linsey wolsey, for making\r\npetticoats--muslins for caps--ribbons--an assortment of needles,\r\npins, and netting-pins--and all sorts of small wares. He always\r\ntravels on foot. It is suspected that he likewise does a little\r\nin the “jigger line,” for many of these Highlanders have, or are\r\nsupposed to have, their illicit distilleries; and the packmen are\r\nsuspected of trafficking without excise interference. Glasgow, Dundee,\r\nGalashiels, and Harwick are the principal manufacturing towns where\r\nthe packman replenishes his stock. “My own opinion,” says an informant\r\nof considerable experience, “is that these men seldom grow rich; but\r\nthe prevailing idea in the country part of Scotland is, that the\r\npedlar has an unco lang stockin wi’ an awfu’ amount o goden guineas in\r\nit, and that his pocket buik is plumped out wi’ a thick roll of bank\r\nnotes. Indeed there are many instances upon record of poor packmen\r\nhaving been murdered--the assassins, doubtlessly, expecting a rich\r\nbooty.” It scarcely ever costs the packman of Scotland anything for\r\nhis bed and board. The Highlanders are a most hospitable people with\r\nacquaintances--although with strangers at first they are invariably\r\nshy and distant. In Ireland there is also the travelling pedlar, whose\r\nhabits and style of doing business are nearly similar to that of the\r\nScotchman. Some of the packmen of Scotland have risen to eminence and\r\ndistinction. A quondam lord provost of Glasgow, a gentleman still\r\nliving, and upon whom the honour of knighthood has been conferred,\r\nwas, according to common report, in his earlier days a packman; and\r\nrumour also does the gentleman the credit to acknowledge that he is not\r\nashamed to own it.\r\n\r\nI am told by a London hawker of soft goods, or packman, that the number\r\nof his craft, hawking London and its vicinity, as far as he can judge,\r\nis about 120 (the census of 1841 makes the London hawkers, hucksters\r\nand pedlars amount to 2041). In the 120 are included the Irish linen\r\nhawkers. I am also informed that the fair trader’s profits amount to\r\nabout 20 per cent., while those of the not over-particular trader\r\nrange from 80 to 200 per cent. In a fair way of business it is said\r\nthe hawker’s taking will amount, upon an average, to 7_l._ or 8_l._\r\nper week; whereas the receipts of the “duffer,” or unfair hawker, will\r\nsometimes reach to 50_l._ per week. Many, however, travel days, and do\r\nnot turn a penny.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A PACKMAN.\r\n\r\nOf the way of trading of a travelling-pedlar I had the following\r\naccount from one of the body. He was well dressed, and a good but\r\nkeen-looking man of about thirty-five, slim, and of rather short\r\nstature, with quick dark eyes and bushy whiskers, on which it\r\nwas evident no small culture was bestowed. His manners were far\r\nfrom obtrusive or importunate--to those whom he sought to make\r\ncustomers--for I happened to witness a portion of his proceedings in\r\nthat respect; but he had a quiet perseverance with him, which, along\r\nwith perfect civility, and something like deference, might be the most\r\nefficient means of recommending himself to the maid-servants, among\r\nwhom lay his chief customers. He showed a little of the pride of art in\r\ndescribing the management of his business, but he would not hear that\r\nhe “pattered:” he talked to his customers, he declared, as any draper,\r\nwho knew his business well, might talk to _his_.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw him, his pack, which he carried slung over one shoulder,\r\ncontained a few gown-pieces of printed cotton, nearly all with pink\r\ngrounds; a few shawls of different sizes; and three rolls firmly\r\npacked, each with a card-label on which was neatly written, “French\r\nMerino. Full duty paid. A.B.--L.F.--18--33--1851. French Chocolate.”\r\nThere were also six neat paper packages, two marked “worked collars,”\r\nthree, “gauze handkerchiefs,” and the other “beautiful child’s gros de\r\nnaples.” The latter consisted of 4-1/2 yards of black silk, sufficient\r\nfor a child’s dress. He carried with him, moreover, 5 umbrellas, one\r\ninclosed in a bright glazed cover, while from its mother-of-pearl\r\nhandle hung a card addressed--“The Lady’s Maid, Victoria Lodge, 13_s._\r\n6_d._”\r\n\r\n“This is a very small stock,” he said, “to what I generally carry, but\r\nI’m going on a country round to-morrow, and I want to get through it\r\nbefore I lay in a new one. I tell people that I want to sell off my\r\ngoods cheap, as they’re too good for country sale; and that’s true, the\r\nbetter half of it.”\r\n\r\nOn my expressing some surprise that he should be leaving London at this\r\nparticular time, he answered:--\r\n\r\n“I go into the country because I think all the hawkers will be making\r\nfor town, and there’ll be plenty of customers left in the country, and\r\nfewer to sell to them at their own places. That’s my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I sell to women of all sorts. Smart-dressing servant-maids, perhaps,\r\nare my best customers, especially if they live a good way from any\r\ngrand ticketing shop. I sold one of my umbrellas to one of them just\r\nbefore you spoke to me. She was standing at the door, and I saw her\r\ngive half a glance at the umbrellas, and so I offered them. She first\r\nagreed to buy a very nice one at 3_s._ 3_d._ (which should have been\r\n4_s._), but I persuaded her to take one at 3_s._ 9_d._ (which should\r\nhave been 4_s._ 6_d._). ‘Look here, ma’am,’ said I, ‘this umbrella is\r\nmuch bigger you see, and will carry double, so when you’re coming from\r\nchurch of a wet Sunday evening, a friend can have share of it, and very\r\ngrateful he’ll be, as he’s sure to have his best hat on. There’s been\r\nmany a question put under an umbrella that way that’s made a young lady\r\nblush, and take good care of her umbrella when she was married, and had\r\na house of her own. I look sharp after the young and pretty ladies,\r\nMiss, and shall as long as I’m a bachelor.’ ‘O,’ says she, ‘such\r\nridiculous nonsense because it’s often so windy about here, and then\r\none must have a good cover if it rains as well.’\r\n\r\n“That’s my way, sir. I don’t mind telling that, because they do the\r\nsame in the shops. I’ve heard them, but they can’t put love and\r\nsweet-hearting so cleverly in a crowded shop as we can in a quiet\r\nhouse. It’s that I go for, love and sweet-hearting; and I always speak\r\nto any smart servant as if I thought she was the mistress, or as if\r\nI wasn’t sure whether she was the mistress or the lady’s-maid; three\r\ntimes out of four she’s house-maid or maid of all work. I call her\r\n‘ma’am,’ and ‘young lady,’ and sometimes ‘miss.’ It’s no use offering\r\nto sell until a maid has tidied herself in the afternoon--not a bit. I\r\nshould make a capital draper’s shopman, I know, only I could never bear\r\nthe confinement. I never will hear such words as ‘I don’t want it,’ or,\r\n‘nothing more to-day,’ no more than if I was behind a counter.\r\n\r\n“The great difficulty I have is to get a chance of offering my goods.\r\nIf I ring at a gate--for I always go a little way out of town--they can\r\nsee who it is, and I may ring half an hour for nothing. If the door’s\r\nopened it’s often shut again directly, and I just hear ‘bother.’ I used\r\nto leave a few bills, and I do so still in some parts of the country,\r\nwith a list of goods, and ‘this bill to be called for’ printed at the\r\nbottom. But I haven’t done that in town for a long time; it’s no good.\r\nPeople seem to think it’s giving double trouble. One of the prettiest\r\ngirls I ever saw where I called one evening, pointed--just as I began\r\nto say, ‘I left a bill and’--to some paper round a candle in a stick,\r\nand shut the door laughing.\r\n\r\n“In selling my gown-pieces I say they are such as will suit the\r\ncomplexion, and such like; and I always use my judgment in saying\r\nso. Why shouldn’t I? It’s the same to me what colour I sell. ‘It’s a\r\ngenteel thing, ma’am,’ I’ll say to a servant-maid, ‘and such as common\r\npeople won’t admire. It’s not staring enough for them. I’m sure it\r\nwould become you, ma’am, and is very cheap; cheaper than you could buy\r\nat a shop; for all these things are made by the same manufacturers,\r\nand sold to the wholesale dealers at the same price, and a shopkeeper,\r\nyou know, has his young men, and taxes, and rates, and gas, and fine\r\nwindows to pay for, and I haven’t, so it don’t want much judgment to\r\nsee that I must be able to sell cheaper than shopkeepers, and I think\r\nyour own taste, ma’am, will satisfy you that these here are elegant\r\npatterns.’\r\n\r\n“That’s the way I go on. No doubt there’s others do the same, but I\r\nknow and care little about them. I have my own way of doing business,\r\nand never trouble myself about other people’s patter or nonsense.\r\n\r\n“Now, that piece of silk I shall, most likely, sell to the landlady of\r\na public-house, where I see there’s children. I shall offer it after\r\nI’ve got a bit of dinner there, or when I’ve said I want a bit. It’s\r\nno use offering it there, though, if it isn’t cheap; they’re too good\r\njudges. Innkeepers aren’t bad customers, I think, taking it altogether,\r\nto such as me, if you can get to talk to them, as you sometimes can\r\nat their bars. They’re generally wanting something, that’s one step.\r\nI always tell them that they ought to buy of men, in my way, who live\r\namong them, and not of fine shop-keepers, who never came a-near their\r\nhouses. I’ve sold them both cottons and linens, after such talk as\r\nthat. I live at public-houses in the country. I sleep nowhere else.\r\n\r\n“My trade in town is nothing to what it was ten or a dozen years back.\r\nI don’t know the reason exactly. I think so many threepenny busses\r\nis one; for they’ll take any servant, when she’s got an afternoon,\r\nto a thoroughfare full of ticket-shops, and bring her back, and her\r\nbundle of purchases too, for another 3_d._ I shall cut it altogether,\r\nI think, and stick to the country. Why, I’ve known the time when I\r\nshould have met from half-a-dozen to a dozen people trading in my way\r\nin town, and for these three days, and dry days too, I haven’t met one.\r\nMy way of trading in the country is just the same as in town. I go\r\nfrom farm-house to farm-house, or call at gentlemen’s grand seats--if\r\na man’s known to the servants there, it may be the best card he can\r\nplay--and I call at every likely house in the towns or villages. I\r\nonly go to a house and sell a mistress or maid the same sort of goods\r\n(a little cheaper, perhaps), and recommend them in the same way, as is\r\ndone every day at many a fine city, and borough, and West-End shop. I\r\nnever say they’re part of a bankrupt’s stock; a packfull would seem\r\nnothing for that. I never pretend that they’re smuggled. Mine’s a\r\nrespectable trade, sir. There’s been so much dodging that way, it’s\r\nbeen a great stop to fair trading; and I like to go on the same round\r\nmore than once. A person once taken-in by smuggled handkerchiefs,\r\nor anything, won’t deal with a hawker again, even though there’s no\r\ndeception. But ‘duffing,’ and all that is going down fast, and I wish\r\nit was gone altogether. I do nothing in tally. I buy my goods; and\r\nI’ve bought all sorts, in wholesale houses, of course, and I’d rather\r\nlay out 10_l._ in Manchester than in London. O, as to what I make, I\r\ncan’t say it’s enough to keep me (I’ve only myself), and escape the\r\nincome-tax. Sometimes I make 10_s._ a week; sometimes 20_s._; sometimes\r\n30_s._; and I have made 50_s._; and one week, the best I ever did, I\r\nmade as much as 74_s._ 6_d._ That’s all I can say.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be sufficiently accurate to compute the average weekly\r\nearnings of a smart trader like my informant, at from 21_s._ to 25_s._\r\nin London, and from 25_s._ to 30_s._ in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TALLY PACKMAN.\r\n\r\nThe pedlar tallyman is a hawker who supplies his customers with goods,\r\nreceiving payment by weekly instalments, and derives his name from the\r\ntally or score he keeps with his customers. Linen drapery--or at least\r\nthe general routine of linen-draper’s stock, as silk-mercery, hosiery,\r\nwoollen cloths, &c.--is the most prevalent trade of the tallyman.\r\nThere are a few shoemakers and some household furniture dealers who\r\ndo business in the tally or “score” system; but the great majority\r\nare linen-drapers, though some of them sell household furniture as\r\nwell. The system is generally condemned as a bad one; as leading to\r\nimprovidence in the buyer and rapacity in the seller. There are many\r\nwho have incurred a tally debt, and have never been able to “get a-head\r\nof it,” but have been kept poor by it all their lives. Some few,\r\nhowever, may have been benefited by the system, and as an outfit for\r\na young man or woman entering service is necessary--when the parties\r\nare too poor to pay ready money--it is an accommodation. I have never\r\nheard any of the tallyman’s customers express an opinion upon the\r\nsubject, other than that they wish they had done with the tallyman, or\r\ncould do without him.\r\n\r\nThe system does not prevail to so great an extent as it did some\r\nyears back. The pedlar or hawking tallyman travels for orders, and\r\nconsequently is said not to require a hawker’s licence. The great\r\nmajority of the tally-packmen are Scotchmen. The children who are set\r\nto watch the arrival of the tallyman, and apprise the mother of his\r\napproach, when not convenient to pay, whisper instead of “Mother,\r\nhere’s the Tallyman,” “Mother, here’s the Scotchman.” These men live in\r\nprivate houses, which they term their warehouse; they are many of them\r\nproprietors themselves in a small way, and conduct the whole of their\r\nbusiness unassisted. Their mode of doing business is as follows:--they\r\nseldom knock at a door except they have a customer upon whom they call\r\nfor the weekly instalment, but if a respectable-looking female happens\r\nto be standing at her door, she, in all probability, is accosted by\r\nthe Scotchman, “Do you require anything in my way to-day, ma’am?”\r\nThis is often spoken in broad Scotch, the speaker trying to make it\r\nsound as much like English as possible. Without waiting for a reply,\r\nhe then runs over a programme of the treasures he has to dispose of,\r\nemphasising all those articles which he considers likely to suit the\r\ntaste of the person he addresses. She doesn’t want perhaps any--she\r\nhas no money to spare then. “She may want something in his way another\r\nday, may-be,” says the tallyman. “Will she grant him permission to\r\nexhibit some beautiful shawls--the last new fashion? or some new\r\nstyle of dress, just out, and an extraordinary bargain?” The man’s\r\nimportunities, and the curiosity of the lady, introduces him into the\r\napartment,--an acquaintance is called in to pass her opinion upon\r\nthe tallyman’s stock. Should she still demur, he says, “O, I’m sure\r\nyour husband cannot object--he will not be so unreasonable; besides,\r\nconsider the easy mode of payment, you’ll only have to pay 1_s._\r\n6_d._ a week for every pound’s worth of goods you take; why it’s like\r\nnothing; you possess yourself of respectable clothing and pay for them\r\nin such an easy manner that you never miss it; well, I’ll call next\r\nweek. I shall leave you this paper.” The paper left is a blank form\r\nto be filled up by the husband, and runs thus:--“I agree on behalf\r\nof my wife to pay, by weekly instalments of 1_s._ 6_d._ upon every\r\npound’s worth of good she may purchase.” This proceeding is considered\r\nnecessary by the tallymen, as the judges in the Court of Requests now\r\nso frequently decide against him, where the husband is not cognisant of\r\nthe transaction.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries being settled, and the question having been asked\r\nwhat business the husband is--where he works--and (if it can be done\r\nwithout offence) what are his wages? The Scotchman takes stock of\r\nthe furniture, &c.; the value of what the room contains gives him a\r\nsufficiently correct estimate of the circumstances of his customers.\r\nHis next visit is to the nearest chandler’s shop, and there as blandly\r\nas possible he inquires into the credit, &c., of Mr. ----. If he\r\ndeal, however, with the chandler, the tallyman accounts it a bad omen,\r\nas people in easy circumstances seldom resort to such places. “It is\r\nunpleasant to me,” he says to the chandler, “making these inquiries;\r\nbut Mrs. ---- wishes to open an account with me, and I should like\r\nto oblige them if I thought my money was safe.” “Do _you_ trust\r\nthem, and what sort of payers are they?” According to the reply--the\r\ntallyman determines upon his course. But he rarely stops here; he makes\r\ninquiries also at the greengrocer’s, the beer shop, &c.\r\n\r\nThe persons who connect themselves with the tallyman, little know the\r\ninquisition they subject themselves to.\r\n\r\nWhen the tallyman obtains a customer who pays regularly, he is\r\nas importunate for her to recommend him another customer, as he\r\noriginally was to obtain her custom. Some tallymen who keep shops\r\nhave “travellers” in their employ, some of whom have salaries, while\r\nothers receive a percentage upon all payments, and do not suffer any\r\nloss upon bad debts. Notwithstanding the caution of the tallyman, he\r\nis frequently “victimised.” Many pawn the goods directly they have\r\nobtained them, and in some instances spend the money in drink. Their\r\nmany losses, as a matter of course, _somebody_ must make good. It\r\ntherefore becomes necessary for them to charge a higher price for their\r\ncommodities than the regular trader.\r\n\r\nHowever charitably inclined the tallyman may be at first, he soon\r\nbecomes, I am told, inured to scenes of misery, while the sole feeling\r\nin his mind at length is, “I will have my money;” for he is often\r\ntricked, and in some cases most impudently victimised. I am told by a\r\ntallyman that he once supplied goods to the amount of 2_l._, and when\r\nhe called for the first instalment, the woman said she didn’t intend to\r\npay, the goods didn’t suit her, and she would return them. The tallyman\r\nexpressed his willingness to receive them back, whereupon she presented\r\nhim a pawnbroker’s duplicate. She had pledged them an hour after\r\nobtaining them. This was done in a court in the presence of a dozen\r\nwomen, who all chuckled with delight at the joke.\r\n\r\nThe principal portion of the tallyman’s customers are poor mechanics.\r\nWhen the appearance of the house, and the inquiries out of doors\r\nare approved of, no security is required; but the tallyman would at\r\nall times rather add a security, when attainable. Servant-girls who\r\ndeal with tallymen must find the security of a housekeeper; and when\r\nsuch housekeeper agrees to be responsible for the payments, the same\r\ninquisitorial proceedings are adopted, in order to ascertain the\r\ncircumstances of the surety. There are about fifty drapery shops in\r\nLondon where the tally-trade is carried on; and about 200 Scotchmen,\r\nbesides fifty others (part English, part Irish), are engaged in the\r\ntrade. A clerk of a tally-shop, at the West-end, informs me that there\r\nare ten collectors and canvassers for customers, out each day, from\r\nthat one establishment; and that, until lately, they were accustomed\r\nto collect moneys on Sundays. Some collect as much as 12_l._ or 14_l._\r\na day; and some not more than 2_l._ or 3_l._ The average sum collected\r\nmay be about 5_l._ each, or 50_l._ per day by the whole. The profits\r\nare 30 per cent., the bad debts 10 per cent., thus leaving 20 per cent.\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman who does not choose to extend his business beyond his\r\nown cautious superintendence, is content with smaller profits, perhaps\r\n20 per cent., and his bad debts may be estimated at 2-1/2 per cent.\r\nOne of the body informed me that he had been in the tally-trade about\r\nfive years; that he commenced with a capital of only 10_l._, and that\r\nnow his collections average 30_l._ per week. He never bought, he\r\nsaid, on credit; and his stock on hand is worth nearly 200_l._ cost\r\nprice, while his outstanding debts are nearly 200_l._ also. “This is a\r\nflourishing state of affairs,” he remarked; “I do not owe a penny in\r\nthe world, and I have accomplished all this in little less than five\r\nyears.” This man had served his apprenticeship to a draper in Glasgow,\r\nand had originally arrived in London with 20_l._ in his pocket. After\r\nsome weeks’ fruitless endeavour to obtain a situation, his money\r\ndwindling away the while, he was advised, by a fellow-countryman, who\r\nwas a tallyman, to try the tally-trade. For a few days previous to\r\nadopting the business, he went the “rounds” with his friend, for the\r\npurpose of getting initiated, and the week after started on his own\r\naccount. Notwithstanding his having no hawker’s licence, he tried to\r\neffect sales for ready money, and, to a trifling extent, succeeded.\r\nThe first week he obtained three tally customers. He could have got,\r\nhe said, a dozen; but he selected three whom he considered good, and\r\nhe was not deceived, for they continued to be customers of his to this\r\nday. The amount of goods that each of these took of him was 20_s._; and\r\nthe three instalments of 1_s._ 6_d._ each (4_s._ 6_d._ per week) the\r\ntallyman determined to subsist upon, though his lodging and washing\r\ncost him 2_s._ per week. He lived principally upon “parritch” and skim\r\nmilk, indulging now and then in the luxury of a herring and a few\r\npotatoes. In twelve weeks he had added only one more credit customer\r\nto his books. He had hawked for ready money, and had succeeded so far\r\nas to increase his stock to 15_l._ in value. His first three customers\r\nhad, by this time, paid their accounts, and again patronized him. In\r\nthe course of a little time his fourth customer had also paid up, and\r\nhad another supply of goods; he then added two more tally customers,\r\nand commenced indulging (though very seldom) in a mutton chop. He\r\nprogressed slowly, and is now in flourishing circumstances. He states\r\nthat he has met with only one loss during his connection with the\r\ntally-trade, and that but a trifling one. It is those who wish to drive\r\na very extensive business, he says, who are principally victimised. The\r\nmost industrious of the packmen tallymen seldom travel less than twenty\r\nmiles a day, carrying a burthen upon their backs of from 100 to 120\r\nlbs. They used to carry merely patterns to their customers, but they\r\nfind that the full-length article is more likely to secure purchasers\r\nand customers. Those who keep shops do not carry goods with them; the\r\nwould-be customer is invited to the shop.\r\n\r\nThe best day for business in the tally-trade is Monday, and most\r\nof these shops upon that day are crowded. Sometimes an unsolicited\r\ncustomer (mostly a female) presents herself, and wishes to be supplied\r\nwith goods on tally. “Who recommended you?” inquires the tallyman. “Oh,\r\nMrs. ----, sir, a customer of yours.” “Ah! indeed, very much obliged to\r\nMrs. ----,” is the answer. The articles required are shown, selected,\r\nand cut. The new customer is treated most civilly by the tallyman, who\r\nfurther inquires her name and abode. The purchaser, of course, expects\r\nthe next process will be to deliver up the parcel to her, when she is\r\ninformed that they “will send it home for her.” “Oh,” she replies, “I\r\nwon’t trouble you, I can carry it myself.” “Our rule, ma’am,” returns\r\nthe tallyman, “is always to send parcels home. We certainly cannot\r\ndoubt your respectability, but we never deviate from our practice.”\r\nThe disappointed female departs, and if the inquiries do not prove\r\nsatisfactory, she never hears further from the tallyman. The goods\r\nwhich she selected, and which were cut expressly for her, find their\r\nway to the shelves of the establishment. If, however, a good customer\r\naccompanies a friend whom she wishes to recommend, the parcels are\r\ndelivered when purchased, if required. The tallyman (to good customers)\r\noften extends his civilities to a glass of wine; or, if the “Ladies”\r\nprefer it (which it must be confessed they mostly do), a glass of gin.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of tallymen who sell clocks, receiving payment\r\nby weekly instalments. These are content with an instalment of 1_s._ in\r\nthe pound per week. They are principally Germans who can speak English.\r\nTheir proceedings altogether are similar to the tally linen-draper.\r\n\r\nI have given the rise and progress of a Scotch tallyman, and will\r\nnow relate the downfall of another--an Englishman. He commenced\r\na tally-shop in the neighbourhood of ----, and was carrying on a\r\nprosperous and daily increasing trade. At one time, a bill in the shop\r\nwindow announced that an errand boy was wanted--an applicant soon\r\npresented himself--was engaged, and proved a steady lad. In the course\r\nof a few weeks, this youth was promoted to the office of serving in\r\nthe shop, and afterwards became collecting clerk. “George,” said his\r\nmaster one day, “we have three days in the week unemployed; suppose\r\nyou try and form a connection around Finchley, Highgate, Hampstead,\r\nand that neighbourhood.” George was quite willing to make the\r\nexperiment, and succeeded beyond expectation. The country connection\r\nsoon surpassed the town trade; and George, the errand boy, became a\r\nman of some consequence in the establishment. The principal of the\r\nfirm was what is termed “gay.” He was particularly fond of attending\r\npublic entertainments. He sported a little as well, and delighted in\r\nhorse-racing. His business, though an excellent one, was neglected;\r\nthe books got out of order; and he became involved in difficulties.\r\nAn examination of his affairs took place; and a Mr. R---- was engaged\r\nfrom a wholesale house in the city to assist in making up the accounts,\r\n&c. During this person’s sojourn in the shop, he saw that George\r\n(the quondam errand boy) was the chief support of the concern. The\r\ncountry customers had never seen any other person, and a partnership\r\nwas proposed. The proposal was accepted, and the firm R---- and W----\r\nbecame one of the most prosperous tally-shops in the neighbourhood of\r\nTottenham-court-road. George’s master was made bankrupt, and is now a\r\nstreet-seller in Fitzroy-market--vending sandwiches, &c.\r\n\r\nThe cases are not a few where ruin has followed a connection with the\r\ntallymen. I will particularize one instance related to me on good\r\nauthority. A lawyer’s clerk married, when young, a milliner; his salary\r\nwas a guinea per week, and he and his wife had agreed to “get on in the\r\nworld.” They occupied furnished lodgings at first, but soon accumulated\r\nfurniture of their own, and every week added some little useful article\r\ntowards their household stock. “At the end of a year,” said the\r\nindividual in question, “I had as comfortable a little home as any man\r\nwould wish to possess; I was fond of it too, and would rather have been\r\nthere than anywhere else. My wife frequently wished to obtain credit;\r\n‘it would be so easy,’ said she, ‘to pay a trifling instalment, and\r\nthen we could obtain immediately whatever we might want.’ I objected,\r\nand preferred supplying our wants gradually, knowing that for ready\r\nmoney I could purchase to much better advantage. Consequently we still\r\nkept progressing, and I was really happy. Judge my astonishment one\r\nday, when I came home, and found an execution was in the house. My wife\r\nhad run in debt with the tallyman unknown to me. Summonses had been\r\nserved, which by some means she had concealed from me. The goods which\r\nI had taken so much pains to procure were seized and sold. But this\r\nwas not all. My wife grew so much alarmed at the misery she had caused\r\nthat she fled from me, and I have never seen her but once since. This\r\noccurred seven years ago, and she has been for some time the companion\r\nof those who hold their virtue of little worth. For some time after\r\nthis I cared not what became of me; I lost my situation, and sunk to be\r\na supernumerary for 1_s._ a night at one of the theatres. Here, after\r\nbeing entrusted with a line to speak, I eventually rose to a ‘general\r\nutility man,’ at 12_s._ per week. With this and some copying, that I\r\noccasionally obtain from the law-stationers, I manage to live, but far\r\nfrom comfortably, for I never think of saving now, and only look out\r\nfor copying when I stand in need of more money. I am always poor, and\r\nscarcely ever have a shilling to call my own.”\r\n\r\nSome of the principal establishments, “doing largely” in the\r\ntally-trade, are in or about Red Lion-square and street, the higher\r\npart of High Holborn, the vicinity of Tottenham-court-road, the\r\nBlackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster, St. George’s, Walworth, New Kent,\r\nand Dover roads.\r\n\r\nAt some of these tally-shops horses and carts are kept to carry out\r\nthe goods ordered of the “travellers,” especially when furniture is\r\nsupplied as well as drapery; while in others the “travellers” are\r\nresident on the premises, and are occasionally shopmen, for a “large”\r\ntally-master not unfrequently carries on a retail trade in addition to\r\nhis tally-business.\r\n\r\nThe tallymen not concerned with these large establishments, but\r\ncarrying on trade on their own account, reside generally in the quieter\r\nstreets in the neighbourhood of the thoroughfares I have mentioned, and\r\noccupy perhaps the ground-floor, letting (for the house is generally\r\ntheir own) the other apartments. Sometimes a piece of cotton-print is\r\nplaced in their parlour-window, and sometimes there is no indication\r\nwhatever of any business being carried on within, for the hawking\r\ntallymen do not depend in any measure upon situation or display,\r\nbut solely on travelling and personal solicitations at people’s own\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “DUFFERS” OR HAWKERS OF PRETENDED SMUGGLED GOODS.\r\n\r\nOf “duffers” and “lumpers,” as regards the sale of textile fabrics,\r\nthere are generally, I am informed, about twenty in London. At such\r\ntimes as Epsom, Ascot-heath, or Goodwood races, however, there is,\r\nperhaps, not one. All have departed to prey, if possible, upon the\r\ncountrymen. Eight of them are Jews, and the majority of the others are\r\nIrishmen. They are generally dressed as sailors, and some wear either\r\nfur caps, or cloth ones, with gilt bands round them, as if they were\r\nthe mates or stewards of ships. They look out for any likely victim\r\nat public-houses, and sometimes accost persons in the streets--first\r\nlooking carefully about them, and hint that they are smugglers, and\r\nhave the finest and cheapest “Injy” handkerchiefs ever seen. These\r\ngoods are now sold in “pieces” of three handkerchiefs. When times were\r\nbetter, I was told, they were in pieces of four, five, and six. One\r\nstreet-seller said to me, “Yes, I know the ‘duffers;’ all of them.\r\nThey do more business than you might think. Everybody likes a smuggled\r\nthing; and I should say these men, each of the ‘duffers,’ tops his\r\n1_l._ a week, clear profit.” I am assured that one of the classes most\r\nnumerously victimised is a body who generally account themselves pretty\r\nsharp, viz. gentlemen’s grooms, and coachmen at the several mews.\r\nSailors are the best customers, and the vicinity of the docks the best\r\nlocality for this trade; for the hawker of pretended smuggled goods\r\nalways does most business among the “tars.” The mock handkerchiefs are\r\ndamped carefully with a fine sponge, before they are offered for sale;\r\nand they are often strongly perfumed, some of the Jews supplying cheap\r\nperfumes, or common “scents.” When the “duffer” thinks he may venture\r\nupon the assertion, he assures a customer that this is “the smell the\r\nhandkerchiefs brought with ’em from foreign parts, as they was smuggled\r\nin a bale of spices!” The trade however is not without its hazards;\r\nfor I am informed that the “duffers” sometimes, on attempting their\r\nimpositions imprudently, and sometimes on being discovered before they\r\ncan leave the house, get soundly thrashed. They have, of course, no\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nThe “pieces” of three handkerchiefs sold by the “duffers” are purchased\r\nby them in Houndsditch, at from 3_s._ to 7_s._; but 7_s._ is only given\r\nwhen there is a design to palm off the 3_s._ goods along with them.\r\nCent. per cent. is a low profit in this trade.\r\n\r\nOne intelligent street-trader, to whom I am indebted for\r\ncarefully-considered information, said to me very quietly: “I’ve read\r\nyour work, sir, at a coffee-shop; for I can’t afford to take it in. I\r\nknow you’re going to open the eyes of the public as to the ‘duffer’s’\r\ntricks, now. All right, sir, they’re in honest men’s ways. But, sir,\r\nwhen are you going to say something about the rich shopkeepers as\r\nsells, and the rich manufacturers as makes, the ‘duffer’s’ things?\r\nEvery man of them knows it’s for roguery.”\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar style among the “duffers;” they never fold their\r\ngoods neatly--the same as drapers do, but thrust them into the pack, in\r\na confused heap, as if they did not understand their value--or their\r\nbusiness. There are other classes of “duffers” whose calling is rather\r\nmore hazardous than the licensed-hawker “duffer.” “I have often thought\r\nit strange,” says a correspondent, “that these men could induce any\r\none to credit the fact of their being sailors, for, notwithstanding\r\nthe showy manner in which they chew their quid, and the jack-tar\r\nlike fashion in which they suffer their whiskers to grow, there is\r\nsuch a fresh-waterfied appearance about them, that they look no more\r\nlike a regular mariner than the supernumerary seamen in a nautical\r\ndrama, at the Victoria Theatre. Yet they obtain victims readily. Their\r\nmode of proceeding in the streets is to accost their intended dupes,\r\nwhile walking by their side; they usually speak in a half whisper,\r\nas they keep pace with them, and look mysteriously around to see if\r\nthere be any of ‘them ere Custom-house sharks afloat.’ They address\r\nthe simple-looking passers by thus: ‘Shipmate’ (here they take off\r\ntheir fur-cap and spit their quid into it)--‘shipmate, I’ve just come\r\nashore arter a long voyage--and splice me but I’ve something in the\r\nlocker that’ll be of service to you; and, shiver my timbers’ (they\r\nare very profuse in nautical terms), ‘you shall have it at your own\r\nprice, for I’m determined to have a spree, and I haven’t a shot in the\r\nlocker; helm’s a-lee; just let’s turn into this creek, and I’ll show\r\nyou what it is’ (perhaps he persuades his dupe down a court, or to a\r\nneighbouring public-house). ‘Now here is a beautiful piece of _Ingy_\r\nhandkerchiefs.’ (They are the coarsest description of spun not _thrown_\r\nsilk, well stiffened into stoutness, and cost the “duffer” perhaps\r\n15_d._ each; but as business is always done on the sly, in a hurry, and\r\nto escape observation, an examination seldom or never takes place). ‘I\r\ngot ’em on shore in spite of those pirates, the Custom-house officers.\r\nYou shall have ’em cheap, there’s half a dozen on ’em, they cost me\r\n30_s._ at Madras, you shall have ’em for the same money.’ (The victim,\r\nmay be, is not inclined to purchase. The pretended tar, however, must\r\nhave money.) ‘Will you give me 25_s._ for them?’ he says; ‘d--n it,\r\na pound? Shiver my topsails, you don’t want them any cheaper than\r\nthat, do you!’ The ‘duffer’ says this to make his dupe believe that he\r\nreally does want the goods, or has offered a price for them. Perhaps\r\nif the ‘duffer’ cannot extort more he takes 10_s._ for the half dozen\r\n‘Ingy’ handkerchiefs, the profit being thus about 2_s._ 6_d._; but\r\nmore frequently he gets 100 and even 200 per cent. on his transactions\r\naccording to the gullibility of his customers. The ‘duffer’ deals also\r\nin cigars; he accosts his victim in the same style as when selling\r\nhandkerchiefs, and gives himself the same sailor-like airs.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the ‘duffers’ visit the obscure streets in London, where\r\nthere are small chandlers’ shops; one of them enters, leaving his mate\r\noutside to give him the signal in case the enemy heaves in sight. He\r\nrequests to be served with some trifling article--when if he approve of\r\nthe physiognomy of the shopkeeper, and consider him or her likely to be\r\nvictimised--he ventures an observation as to how enormously everything\r\nis taxed (though to one less innocent it might appear unusual for\r\na sailor to talk politics); ‘even this ’ere baccy’ he says, taking\r\nout his quid, ‘I can’t chew, without paying a tax; but,’ he adds,\r\nchuckling--‘us sailor chaps sometimes shirks the Custom-house lubbers,\r\nsharp as they are.’ (Here his companion outside puts his head in at\r\nthe door, and, to make the scene as natural as possible, says, ‘Come,\r\nJack, don’t stop there all night spinning your yarns; come, bear a\r\nhand, or I shall part convoy.’) ‘Oh, heave to a bit longer, my hearty,’\r\nreplies the ‘duffer,’ ‘I will be with you in the twinkling of a marling\r\nspike. I’ll tell you what we’ve got, marm, and if you likes to buy it\r\nyou shall have it cheap, for me and my mate are both short of rhino.\r\nWe’ve half-a-dozen pounds of tea--you can weigh it if you like--and you\r\nshall have the lot for 12_s._’ Perhaps there is an immediate purchase,\r\nbut if 12_s._ is refused, then 10_s._ 8_s._ or 6_s._ is asked, until a\r\nsale be effected, after which the sailors make their exit as quickly\r\nas possible. Then the chandler’s-shop keeper begins to exult over the\r\nbargain he or she has made, and to examine more minutely the contents\r\nof the neatly packed, and tea-like looking packet thus bought. It\r\nproves to be lined with a profuse quantity of tea lead, and though\r\nsome Chinese characters are marked on the outside, it is discovered on\r\nopening to contain only half-a-pound of tea, the remainder consisting\r\nprincipally of chopped hay. The ‘duffers’ enact the same part, and if\r\na purchaser buy 10 lbs. of the smuggled article, then 9 lbs. at least\r\nconsist of the same chopped hay.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the ‘duffers’ sell all their stock to one individual. No\r\nsooner do they dispose of the handkerchiefs to a dupe, than they\r\nintroduce the smuggled tobacco to the notice of the unsuspecting\r\ncustomer; then they palm off their cigars, next their tea, and lastly,\r\nas the ‘duffer’ is determined to raise as much money as he can ‘to\r\nhave his spree;’ ‘why d--e,’ he exclaims to his victim--‘I’ll sell you\r\nmy watch. It cost me 6_l._ at Portsmouth--give me 3_l._ for it and it’s\r\nyours, shipmate. Well, then, 2_l._----1_l._’ The watch, I need not\r\nstate, is made solely for sale.\r\n\r\n“It is really astonishing,” adds my informant, “how these men ever\r\nsucceed, for their look denotes cunning and imposition, and their\r\nproceedings have been so often exposed in the newspapers that numbers\r\nare alive to their tricks, and warn others when they perceive the\r\n“duffers” endeavouring to victimise them; but, as the thimble-men say,\r\n“There’s a fool born every minute.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF “SMALL-WARE,” OR TAPE, COTTON, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of tape and cotton are usually elderly females; and\r\nduring my former inquiry I was directed to one who had been getting\r\nher living in the street by such means for nine years. I was given to\r\nunderstand that the poor woman was in deep distress, and that she had\r\nlong been supporting a sick husband by her little trade, but I was\r\nwholly unprepared for a scene of such startling misery, sublimed by\r\nuntiring affection and pious resignation, as I there discovered.\r\n\r\nI wish the reader to understand that I do not cite this case as a\r\ntype of the sufferings of this particular class, but rather as an\r\nillustration of the afflictions which frequently befall those who are\r\nsolely dependent on their labour, or their little trade, for their\r\nsubsistence, and who, from the smallness of their earnings, are unable\r\nto lay by even the least trifle as a fund against any physical calamity.\r\n\r\nThe poor creatures lived in one of the close alleys at the east end of\r\nLondon. On inquiring at the house to which I had been directed, I was\r\ntold I should find them in “the two-pair back.” I mounted the stairs,\r\nand on opening the door of the apartment I was terrified with the\r\nmisery before me. There, on a wretched bed, lay an aged man in almost\r\nthe last extremity of life. At first I thought the poor old creature\r\nwas really dead, but a tremble of the eyelids as I closed the door,\r\nas noiselessly as I could, told me that he breathed. His face was as\r\nyellow as clay, and it had more the cold damp look of a corpse than\r\nthat of a living man. His cheeks were hollowed in with evident want,\r\nhis temples sunk, and his nostrils pinched close. On the edge of the\r\nbed sat his heroic wife, giving him drink with a spoon from a tea-cup.\r\nIn one corner of the room stood the basket of tapes, cottons, combs,\r\nbraces, nutmeg-graters, and shaving-glasses, with which she strove to\r\nkeep her old dying husband from the workhouse. I asked her how long\r\nher good man had been ill, and she told me he had been confined to his\r\nbed five weeks last Wednesday, and that it was ten weeks since he had\r\neaten the size of a nut in solid food. Nothing but a little beef-tea\r\nhad passed his lips for months. “We have lived like children together,”\r\nsaid the old woman, as her eyes flooded with tears, “and never had no\r\ndispute. He hated drink, and there was no cause for us to quarrel. One\r\nof my legs, you see, is shorter than the other,” said she, rising from\r\nthe bed-side, and showing me that her right foot was several inches\r\nfrom the ground as she stood. “My hip is out. I used to go out washing,\r\nand walking in my pattens I fell down. My hip is out of the socket\r\nthree-quarters of an inch, and the sinews is drawn up. I am obliged to\r\nwalk with a stick.” Here the man groaned and coughed so that I feared\r\nthe exertion must end his life. “Ah, the heart of a stone would pity\r\nthat poor fellow,” said the good wife.\r\n\r\n“After I put my hip out, I couldn’t get my living as I’d been used to\r\ndo. I couldn’t stand a day if I had five hundred pounds for it. I must\r\nsit down. So I got a little stall, and sat at the end of the alley here\r\nwith a few laces and tapes and things. I’ve done so for this nine year\r\npast, and seen many a landlord come in and go out of the house that I\r\nsat at. My husband used to sell small articles in the streets--black\r\nlead and furniture paste, and blacking. We got a sort of a living by\r\nthis, the two of us together. It’s very seldom though we had a bit of\r\nmeat. We had 1_s._ 9_d._ rent to pay--Come, my poor fellow, will you\r\nhave another little drop to wet your mouth?” said the woman, breaking\r\noff. “Come, my dearest, let me give you this,” she added, as the man\r\nlet his jaw fall, and she poured some warm sugar and water flavoured\r\nwith cinnamon--all she had to give him--into his mouth. “He’s been an\r\nailing man this many a year. He used to go of errands and buy my little\r\nthings for me, on account of my being lame. We assisted one another,\r\nyou see. He wasn’t able to work for his living, and I wasn’t able to\r\ngo about, so he used to go about and buy for me what I sold. I am sure\r\nhe never earned above 1_s._ 6_d._ in the week. He used to attend me,\r\nand many a time I’ve sat for ten and fourteen hours in the cold and wet\r\nand didn’t take a sixpence. Some days I’d make a shilling, and some\r\ndays less; but whatever I got I used to have to put a good part into\r\nthe basket to keep my little stock.” [A knock here came to the door;\r\nit was for a halfpenny-worth of darning cotton.] “You know a shilling\r\ngoes further with a poor couple that’s sober than two shillings does\r\nwith a drunkard. We lived poor, you see, never had nothing but tea, or\r\nwe couldn’t have done anyhow. If I’d take 18_d._ in the day I’d think I\r\nwas grandly off, and then if there was 6_d._ profit got out of that it\r\nwould be almost as much as it would. You see these cotton braces here”\r\n(said the old woman, going to her tray). “Well, I gives 2_s._ 9_d._\r\na dozen for them here, and I sells ’em for 4-1/2_d._, and oftentimes\r\n4_d._ a pair. Now, this piece of tape would cost me seven farthings\r\nin the shop, and I sells it at six yards a penny. It has the _name_\r\nof being eighteen yards. The profit out of it is five farthings. It’s\r\nbeyond the power of man to wonder how there’s a bit of bread got out of\r\nsuch a small way. And the times is so bad, too! I think I could say I\r\nget 8_d._ a day profit if I have any sort of custom, but I don’t exceed\r\nthat at the best of times. I’ve often sat at the end of the alley\r\nand taken only 6_d._, and that’s not much more than 2_d._ clear--it\r\nan’t 3_d._ I’m sure. I think I could safely state that for the last\r\nnine year me and my husband has earned together 5_s._ a week, and out\r\nof that the two of us had to live and pay rent--1_s._ 9_d._ a week.\r\nClothes I could buy none, for the best garment is on me; but I thank\r\nthe Lord still. I’ve paid my rent all but three weeks, and that isn’t\r\ndue till to-morrow. We have often reckoned it up here at the fire. Some\r\nweeks we have got 5_s._ 3_d._, and some weeks less, so that I judge\r\nwe have had about 3_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ a week to live upon the two of\r\nus, for this nine year past. Half-a-hundred of coals would fit me the\r\nweek in the depths of winter. My husband had the kettle always boiling\r\nfor me against I came in. He used to sit here reading his book--he\r\nnever was fit for work at the best--while I used to be out minding\r\nthe basket. He was so sober and quiet too. His neighbours will tell\r\nthat of him. Within the last ten weeks he’s been very ill indeed, but\r\nstill I could be out with the basket. Since then he’s never earnt me a\r\npenny--poor old soul, he wasn’t able! All that time I still attended to\r\nmy basket. He wasn’t so ill then but what he could do a little here in\r\nthe room for hisself; but he wanted little, God knows, for he couldn’t\r\neat. After he fell ill, I had to go all my errands myself. I had no\r\none to help me, for I’d nothing to pay them, and I’d have to walk from\r\nhere down to Sun-street with my stick, till my bad leg pained me so\r\nthat I could hardly stand. You see the hip being put out has drawn all\r\nthe sinews up into my groin, and it leaves me oncapable of walking\r\nor standing constantly; but I thank God that I’ve got the use of it\r\nanyhow. Our lot’s hard enough, goodness knows, but we are content. We\r\nnever complain, but bless the Lord for the little he pleases to give\r\nus. When I was away on my errands, in course I couldn’t be minding my\r\nbasket; so I lost a good bit of money that way. Well, five weeks on\r\nWednesday he has been totally confined to his bed, excepting when I\r\nlifted him up to make it some nights; but he can’t bear _that_ now.\r\nStill the first fortnight he was bad, I did manage to leave him, and\r\nearn a few pence; but, latterly, for this last three weeks, I haven’t\r\nbeen able to go out at all, to do anything.”\r\n\r\n“She’s been stopping by me, minding me here night and day all that\r\ntime,” mumbled the old man, who now for the first time opened his\r\ngray glassy eyes and turned towards me, to bear, as it were, a last\r\ntribute to his wife’s incessant affection. “She has been most kind to\r\nme. Her tenderness and care has been such that man never knew from\r\nwoman before, ever since I lay upon this sick bed. We’ve been married\r\nfive-and-twenty years. We have always lived happily--very happily,\r\nindeed--together. Until sickness and weakness overcome me I always\r\nstrove to help myself a bit, as well as I could; but since then she has\r\ndone all in her power for me--worked for me--ay, she has worked for me,\r\nsurely--and watched over me. My creed through life has been repentance\r\ntowards God, faith in Jesus Christ, and love to all my brethren. I’ve\r\nmade up my mind that I must soon change this tabernacle, and my last\r\nwish is that the good people of this world will increase her little\r\nstock for her. She cannot get her living out of the little stock she\r\nhas, and since I lay here it’s so lessened, that neither she nor no one\r\nelse can live upon it. If the kind hearts would give her but a little\r\nstock more, it would keep her old age from want, as she has kept mine.\r\nIndeed, indeed, she does deserve it. But the Lord, I know, will reward\r\nher for all she has done to me.” Here the old man’s eyelids dropped\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a shilling and a loaf twice from the parish,” continued the\r\nwoman. “The overseer came to see if my old man was fit to be removed to\r\nthe workhouse. The doctor gave me a certificate that he was not, and\r\nthen the relieving officer gave me a shilling and a loaf of bread, and\r\nout of that shilling I bought the poor old fellow a sup of port wine.\r\nI bought a quartern of wine, which was 4_d._, and I gave 5_d._ for a\r\nbit of tea and sugar, and I gave 2_d._ for coals; a halfpenny rushlight\r\nI bought, and a short candle, that made a penny--and that’s the way I\r\nlaid out the shilling. If God takes him, I know he’ll sleep in heaven.\r\nI know the life he’s spent, and am not afraid; but no one else shall\r\ntake him from me--nothing shall part us but death in this world. Poor\r\nold soul, he can’t be long with me. He’s a perfect skeleton. His bones\r\nare starting through his skin.”\r\n\r\nI asked what could be done for her, and the old man thrust forth his\r\nskinny arm, and laying hold of the bed-post, he raised himself slightly\r\nin his bed, as he murmured “If she could be got into a little parlour,\r\nand away from sitting in the streets, it would be the saving of her.”\r\nAnd, so saying, he fell back overcome with the exertion, and breathed\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nThe woman sat down beside me, and went on. “What shocked him most was\r\nthat I was obligated in his old age to go and ask for relief at the\r\nparish. You see, he was always a spiritful man, and it hurted him\r\nsorely that he should come to this at last, and for the first time in\r\nhis lifetime. The only parish money that ever we had was this, and it\r\n_does_ hurt him every day to think that he must be buried by the parish\r\nafter all. He was always proud, you see.”\r\n\r\nI told the kind-hearted old dame that some benevolent people had placed\r\ncertain funds at my disposal for the relief of such distress as hers;\r\nand I assured her that neither she nor her husband should want for\r\nanything that might ease their sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe day after the above was written, the poor old man died. He was\r\nburied out of the funds sent to the “Morning Chronicle,” and his wife\r\nreceived some few pounds to increase her stock; but in a few months the\r\npoor old woman went mad, and is now, I believe, the inmate of one of\r\nthe pauper lunatic asylums.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF LACE.\r\n\r\nThis trade is carried on both by itinerants and at stands, or\r\n“pitches.” The itinerants, of whom I will first treat, are about\r\nforty in number (thirty women and ten men). They usually carry\r\ntheir lace in boxes, or cases. It is not uncommon for the women to\r\nrepresent themselves as lacemakers from Marlow, or some other place in\r\nBuckinghamshire, or from Honiton, in Devonshire, while the men assert\r\nthey are from Nottingham. I am informed that there are among these\r\nitinerant lace-sellers two women and one man who really have been\r\nlacemakers. They all buy their wares at the haberdashery swag-shops.\r\n\r\nThe lace, which is the principal staple of this trade, is “edgings,”\r\nor the several kinds of cheap lace used for the bordering of caps and\r\nother female requirements. Among street-people the lace is called\r\n“driz,” and the sellers of it “driz-fencers.” It gained this slang\r\nname, I was informed, many years ago, when it was sold, and often to\r\nwealthy ladies, as rare and valuable lace, smuggled from Mechlin,\r\nBrussels, Valenciennes, or any foreign place famous, or once famous,\r\nfor its manufacture. The pretended smuggled lace trade is now unknown\r\nin London, and is very little practised in the country. There is,\r\nhowever, still some smuggling connected with lace-selling. Two, and\r\nsometimes three, female lace-sellers are also “jigger-workers.” They\r\ncarry about their persons pint bladders of “stuff,” or “jigger stuff”\r\n(spirit made at an illicit still). “I used to supply them with it\r\nuntil lately,” one street-trader told me, “from a friend that kept a\r\n‘jigger,’ and a tidy sale some of them had. Indeed, I’ve made the stuff\r\nmyself. I knew one woman, six or seven years back, that did uncommon\r\nwell at first, but she got too fond of the stuff, and drank herself\r\ninto the work’us. They never carried gin, for brandy was most asked\r\nfor. They sold the brandy at 2_s._ 6_d._ the pint; rum at 1_s._ 6_d._;\r\nand whiskey at 2_s._; sometimes higher, and always trying for 6_d._\r\na pint profit, at least. O yes, sir; I know they got the prices I’ve\r\nmentioned, though they seem high; for you must remember that the jigger\r\nspirit is above proof, and a pint will make two pints of gin-palace\r\nstuff. They sold it, I’ve heard them say, to ladies that liked a drop\r\non the sly; and to some as pretended they bought that way for economy;\r\nyes, and to shopkeepers and publicans too. One old lady used to give\r\n3_s._ for three yards of driz, and it was well enough understood,\r\nwithout no words, that a pint of brandy was part of them three yards.\r\nBut the trade that way is nothing to what it was, and gets less and\r\nless every year.”\r\n\r\nFrom a middle-aged woman selling laces I had the following account:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the trade about six years, sir. Ten years back or more\r\nI was in place, and saved a little money, as a servant of all work. I\r\nmarried a house-painter, but trade got bad, and we both had illnesses;\r\nand my husband, though he’s as good a man as need be, can’t stick to\r\nanything very long at a time.” (A very common failing, by the bye, with\r\nthe street-folk.) “It seems not in his nature. When we was reduced very\r\nlow he got on a cab--for he can turn his hand to almost anything--and\r\nafter that we came to street-selling. He’s now on jewellery, and I\r\nthink it suits him as well or better than anything he’s tried; I do\r\nmy part, and we get on middling. If we’re ever pushed it’s no use\r\nfretting. We had one child, and he died when he wanted just a month of\r\nthree years old, and after I’d lost him I said I would never fret for\r\ntrifles no more. My heart was broke for a long time--it was indeed. He\r\nwas the loveliest boy ever seen, and everybody said so. I went into\r\nlace, because my husband got to know all about it, and I had no tie\r\nat home then. I was very shy and ashamed at first to go into houses,\r\nbut that wears off, and I met with some nice people that bought of me\r\nand was very civil, so that encourages one. I sell nothing but lace.\r\nI never cleared more than 2_s._ 6_d._ in a day, and that only once. I\r\nsuppose I clear from 3_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ 6_d._ a week now; perhaps,\r\ntake it altogether, rather more than 4_s._ I have a connection, and go\r\nto the houses in and about the Regent’s Park, and all the small streets\r\nnear it, and sometimes Maida Hill way. I once tried a little millinery\r\nmade-up things, but it didn’t suit somehow, and I didn’t stick to it.\r\nYou see, sir, I sell my lace to very few but servant maids and small\r\nshopkeepers’ wives and daughters; but then they’re a better sort of\r\npeople than those as has to buy everything ready made like servants\r\nhas. They can use their own needles to make themselves nice and smart,\r\nand they buy of such as me to do it cheap, and they’re not often such\r\nbeaters down as them that buys the ready-made. I can do nothing, or\r\nnext to nothing, in very wet weather. If I’m in the habit of going into\r\na nice kitchen, perhaps the housemaid flies at me for ‘bringing in all\r\nthat dirt.’ My husband says all women is crossest in bad weather, and\r\nperhaps servants is.\r\n\r\n“I buy my lace near Shoreditch. It’s a long walk, but I think I’m best\r\nused there. I buy generally a dozen yards, from 3-1/2_d._ to 1_s._,\r\nand sometimes up to 2_s._ I sell the commoner at 1_d._ a yard, and\r\nthree yards 2_d._; and the better at 2_d._ and 3_d._ a yard. It’s a\r\npoor trade, but it’s doing something. My husband seldom earns less\r\nthan 12_s._ a week, for he’s a good salesman, and so we pay 2_s._ rent\r\nregular every Monday for an unfurnished room, and has the rest to live\r\non. I have sold in the Brill on a Saturday night, but not often, nor\r\nlately I don’t like it; I haven’t tongue enough.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the itinerants there are about seventy stationary lace\r\nsellers, and not less than eighty on the Saturday evenings. The best\r\npitches are, I am told, near the Borough-market; in Clare-market;\r\nthe New Cut (on Saturday nights); Walworth-road; Tooley-street;\r\nand Dockhead, Bermondsey. From the best information at my command,\r\nit appears that at least half of these traders sell only lace, or\r\nrarely anything else. The others sell also net for making caps and\r\n“cauls,” which are the plain portion at the back, to be trimmed or\r\nedged according to the purchaser’s taste. Some sell also, with their\r\nlace, cap ribbons--plain or worked collars--and muslin, net, or worked\r\nundersleeves. Braid and gimp were formerly sold by them, but are now in\r\nno demand. The prices run from 2_d._ to 6_d._ for lace articles, and\r\nabout the same for net, &c. per yard; the lowest priced are most sold.\r\n\r\nIn this stationary trade are as many men and youths as women and girls.\r\nOne woman, who had known street-selling for upwards of twenty years,\r\nsaid she could not do half so well now as she could twenty years ago,\r\nfor the cheaper things got the cheaper people would have them. “Why,\r\ntwenty year ago,” she exclaimed, “I bought a lot of ‘leno’ cheap--it\r\nwas just about going out of fashion for caps then, I think--and one\r\nSaturday night in the Cut, I cleared 15_s._ on it. I don’t clear that\r\nin a fortnight now. I have sold to women of the town, as far as I’ve\r\nknown them to be of that sort, but very seldom. It’s not often you’ll\r\ncatch _them_ using a needle for theirselves. They do use their needles,\r\nI know. You can see some of them sewing at their doors and windows in\r\nGranby-street, Waterloo-road, or could lately--for I haven’t passed\r\nthat way for some time--but I believe it’s all for money down, for the\r\nslop-shops. It suits the slop-shops to get work cheap anyway; and it\r\nsuits the women to have some sort of occupation, which they needn’t\r\ndepend upon for their living.”\r\n\r\nThe stationary lace sellers, for the most part, display their goods\r\non stalls, but some spread them on a board, or on matting on the\r\nground. Some of the men gather an audience by shouting out, “Three\r\nyards a penny, edging!” As at this rate the lace-seller would only\r\nclear 1/2_d._ in a dozen yards, the cry is merely uttered to attract\r\nattention. A few who patter at the trade--but far fewer than was once\r\nthe case--give short measure. One man, who occasionally sold lace, told\r\nme, that when he was compelled to sell for “next to no profit, and a\r\nhungry Sunday coming,” he gave good shop measure, thirty full inches to\r\na yard. His yard wand was the correct length, “but I can do it, sir,”\r\nhe said with some exultation, “by palming,” and he gave a jerk to his\r\nfingers, to show how he caught in the lace, and “clipped it short.”\r\n\r\nCalculating that 100 persons in this trade each take 10_s._ 6_d._\r\nweekly, the profit being about cent. per cent., we find 2,730_l._\r\nexpended in the streets in lace and similar commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF JAPANNED TABLE-COVERS.\r\n\r\nThis trade, like several others, as soon as the new commodities\r\nbecame in established demand, and sufficiently cheap, was adopted by\r\nstreet-sellers. It has been a regular street-trade between four and\r\nfive years. Previously, when the covers were dearer, the street-sellers\r\nwere afraid to speculate much in them; but one man told me that he once\r\nsold a table-cover for 8_s._, and at another time for 10_s._\r\n\r\nThe goods are supplied to the street-folk principally by three\r\nmanufacturers--in Long-lane, Smithfield, Whitechapel-road, and\r\nPetticoat-lane. The venders of the glazed table-covers are generally\r\nconsidered among the smartest of the street-folk, as they do not sell\r\nto the poor, or in poor neighbourhoods, but “at the better sort of\r\nhouses, and to the wealthier sort of people.” Table-covers are now\r\nfrequently disposed of by raffle. “I very seldom sell in the streets,”\r\nsaid one man, “though I one evening cleared 4_s._ by standing near the\r\nVinegar-works, in the City-road, and selling to gents on their way home\r\nfrom the city. The public-house trade is the best, and indeed in winter\r\nevenings, and after dark generally, there’s no other. I get rid of more\r\nby raffling than by sale. On Saturday evening I had raffles for two\r\ncovers, which cost me 1_s._ 4_d._ each. I had some trouble to get 1_s._\r\n9_d._ for one; but I got up a raffle for the other, and it brought me\r\n2_s._; six members at 4_d._ each. It’s just the sort of thing to get\r\noff in a raffle on Saturday night, or any time when mechanics have\r\nmoney. A man thinks--leastways I’ve thought so myself, when I’ve been\r\nin a public-house raffle--now I’ve spent more money than I ought to,\r\nand there’s the old woman to face; but if I win the raffle, and take\r\nthe thing home, why my money has gone to buy a nice thing, and not for\r\ndrink.” I may remark that in nearly all raffles got up in this manner,\r\nthe article raffled for is generally something coveted by a working\r\nman, but not so indispensably necessary to him, that he feels justified\r\nin expending his money upon it. This fact seems well enough known to\r\nthe street-sellers who frequent public-houses with their wares. I\r\ninquired of the informant in question if he had ever tried to get up a\r\nraffle of his table-covers in a coffee-shop as well as a public-house.\r\n“Never, with table-covers,” he said, “but I have with other things, and\r\nfind it’s no go. In a coffee-shop people are quiet, and reading, unless\r\nit’s one of them low places for young thieves, and such like; and\r\nthey’ve no money very likely, and I wouldn’t like to trust them in a\r\nraffle if they had. In public-houses there’s talk and fun, and people’s\r\nmore inclined for a raffle, or anything spicy that offers.”\r\n\r\nThere are now fifteen regular street-sellers, or street-hawkers of\r\nthese table-covers, in London, four of whom are the men’s wives, and\r\nthey not unfrequently go a round together. Sometimes, on fine days,\r\nthere are twenty. I heard of one woman who had been very successful\r\nin bartering table-covers for old clothes. “I’ve done a little that\r\nway myself,” said a man in the trade, “but nothing to her, and people\r\nsees into things so now, that there’s hardly a chance for a crust. The\r\ncovers is so soft and shiny, and there’s such fine parrots and birds of\r\nparadise on them, that before the price was known there was a chance of\r\na good bargain. I once got for a cover that cost me 2_s._ 9_d._ a great\r\ncoat that a Jew, after a hard bargaining, gave me 6_s._ 3_d._ for.”\r\n\r\nThe prices of the table-covers (wholesale) run from 8_s._ a dozen to\r\n30_s._; but the street-sellers rarely go to a higher price than 18_s._\r\nThey can buy a dozen, or half a dozen--or even a smaller quantity--of\r\ndifferent sizes. Some of these street-traders sell, with the\r\ntable-covers, a few wash-leathers, of the better kind. Calculating that\r\nfifteen street-sellers each take 25_s._ weekly the year round--one-half\r\nbeing the profit, including their advantages in bartering and\r\nraffling--we find 975_l._ expended yearly upon japanned table-covers,\r\nbought in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BRACES, BELTS, HOSE, TROWSER-STRAPS, AND\r\nWAISTCOATS.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of braces are a numerous and a mixed class. They are\r\nnearly all men, and the majority are Irishmen; but this relates only\r\nto the itinerant or public-house brace-sellers. These wares are sold\r\nalso by street-traders, who make other articles the staple of their\r\ntrade--such as the dog-collar-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe braces sold thirty years ago were of a very different manufacture\r\nfrom those vended in the streets at present. India-rubber web was then\r\nunknown as a component part of the street braces. The braces, which in\r\nsome parts of the country are called “gallowses,” were, at the time\r\nspecified, made of a woollen web, both washable and durable. “One pair\r\nof such braces, good ones,” said an old tailor with whom I had some\r\ntalk on the subject, “would last a poor man his lifetime. Now they’re\r\nin a rope or in rags in no time.” These woollen braces were sold at\r\nfrom 1_s._ to 2_s._ the pair in the streets; the straps being of good\r\nfirm leather. Not long after this period a much cheaper brace-web\r\nwas introduced--a mixture of cotton with the woollen--and the cheap\r\nmanufacture gradually supplanted the better article, as respects the\r\nstreet trade. The cheaper braces were made with sheepskin straps, which\r\nsoon yielded to friction, and were little serviceable. The introduction\r\nof the India-rubber web was another change in the trade, and the\r\nmanufacture has become lower and lower-priced until the present time.\r\n\r\nThe braces sold in the streets, or hawked in the public-houses, are,\r\nhowever, not all of the very inferior manufacture. Some are called\r\n“silk,” others “buck-leather,” and others “knitted cotton.” The “silk”\r\nare of a silken surface, with an admixture of cotton and India-rubber;\r\nthe “buck-leather” (a kind now very little known in street sale) are\r\nof strong sheepskin, dressed buck-leather fashion; and the “knitted”\r\ncotton are woven, some kinds of them being very good and strong.\r\n\r\nThe street brace-sellers, when trying to do business in the streets,\r\ncarry their goods generally with a few belts, and sometimes with\r\nhose in their hands and across their arms. They stretch them from\r\nend to end, as they invite the custom of passers by, to evince the\r\nelasticity and firmness of the web. Sometimes the braces are slung from\r\na pole carried on the shoulder. The sellers call at the public-house\r\nbars and tap-rooms; some are admitted into the parlours; and at a\r\nwell-frequented gin-palace, I was informed by a manager of one, a\r\nbrace-seller will call from twelve to twenty times a day, especially on\r\na Monday; while on a Saturday evening they will remain two, three, or\r\nfour hours, accosting fresh customers. At the gin-palaces, the young\r\nand strong Irishmen offering these wares--and there are many such--are\r\nfrequently scoffed at for selling “braces and things a baby can carry.”\r\n\r\nThe following account, which I received from a street brace-seller,\r\nshows the class who purchase such articles:--\r\n\r\n“I was put to a carriage-lamp maker,” the man said, “at Birmingham,\r\nbut soon ran away. Nobody saw after me, for I had only an uncle, and\r\nhe left me to the parish. It was all my own fault. I was always after\r\nsome idle end, though I can read very well. It seems as if I couldn’t\r\nhelp it, being wild, I mean. I ran away to Worcester, _without knowing\r\nwhere I was going, or caring either_. I was half starved in Worcester,\r\nfor I lived as I could. I found my way to London afterwards. I’ve been\r\nin the streets ever since, at one thing or the other; how many years\r\nI can’t say. Time goes so quick sometimes, and sometimes so slow, and\r\nI’m never long in one place. I’ve sold braces off and on ever since\r\nAmato won the Derby, if you know when that was. I remember it because\r\nI went to Epsom races that year to sell race cards. When I came to\r\nLondon after the races I laid out 12_s._ in braces. I hardly remember\r\nhow many pairs I bought for it, but they wasn’t such common things as\r\nI’m carrying now. I could sell a few then at from 9_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._\r\na pair, to the ‘cads’ and people at such places as the ‘Elephant,’ and\r\nthe ‘Flower Pot’ in Bishopsgate-street, which was a great ‘’bus’ place\r\nthen. I used to sell, too, to the helpers in inn-yards, and a few in\r\nthe mews. The helpers in the mews mostly buys knitted cotton. I’ve\r\ngot 1_s._ and sometimes 1_s._ 6_d._ for an extra article from them,\r\nbut now I don’t carry them; there’s no demand there. You see, many of\r\nthem work in their shirts, and the head coachmen and grooms, which is\r\noften great Turks, would blow up if the men had dirty braces hanging to\r\ntheir buttons, so they uses what’ll wash. Nearly all my business now\r\nis done at public-houses. I go from one tavern to another on my round\r\nall day long, and sell in the street when I can. I think I sell as\r\nmany at 5_d._ and at 10_d._ as at all other prices together, and most\r\nat 5_d._; but when I have what I call a full stock I carry ’em from\r\n4_d._ to 20_d._ The poorer sort of people, such as wears braces--for\r\nthere’s a many as does without ’em--likes the 1_d._ out of 6_d._, and\r\nthe others the 2_d._ out of the 1_s._; it tempts them. It’s a tiresome\r\nlife, and not so good as costermongering, for I once did tidy well in\r\napples. But in the brace trade you ar’n’t troubled with hiring barrows,\r\nand it’s easy carried on in public-houses in wet weather, and there’s\r\nno stock to spoil. I sell all to working-people, I think. Sometimes an\r\nodd pair or two at 1_s._ 6_d._, or so, to a tradesman, that may happen\r\nto be in a bar, and likes the look and the price; or to a gentleman’s\r\nservant. I make from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ a day; full 1_s._ 6_d._ if\r\nI stick close to it. I may make 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ a week, too, in\r\nselling belts and stockings; but I only sometimes carry stockings.\r\nPerhaps I clear 9_s._ a week the year round. There’s lots in the trade\r\ndon’t clear 1_s._ a day, for they only carry low-priced things. I go\r\nfor 4_d._ profit on every shilling’s worth I sell. I’ve only myself to\r\nkeep. I pay 3_d._ a night at a lodging-house, and nothing on Sundays. I\r\nhad a young woman with me when I was a coster, but we didn’t agree, and\r\nparted. She was too fond of lifting her hand to her mouth (‘tippling’)\r\nto please me. I mean to live very near this week, and get a few\r\nshillings if I can to try something at Greenwich next Monday.” This\r\nwas said on the Tuesday in Passion-week.\r\n\r\nThe braces are bought by the street-sellers at the swag-shops I have\r\ndescribed. The prices range from 1_s._ 6_d._ (for common children’s) to\r\n12_s._ a dozen; 3_s._, 3_s._ 6_d._, 6_s._ 6_d._, and 7_s._ being the\r\nmost frequent prices. Higher-priced articles are also sold at the swags\r\nand by the street-sellers, but not one in twenty of these compared with\r\nthe lower priced.\r\n\r\nIn London and its suburbs, and on “rounds,” of which the metropolis\r\nforms the central point, and at stands, there are, I am assured, not\r\nfewer than 500 persons vending braces. Of these a twentieth portion\r\nmay be women, and a tenth old and sometimes infirm men. There are\r\nfew children in the trade. The stall-keepers, selling braces with\r\nother articles, are about 100, and of the remainder of this class,\r\nthose who are not Irishmen are often impoverished mechanics, such as\r\ntailors--brace-vending being easily resorted to, and carried on quietly\r\nin public-houses, and it does not entail the necessity of bawling\r\naloud, to which a working-man, driven to a street-life, usually feels\r\nrepugnance. Calculating that 500 brace-sellers clear 5_s._ a week each\r\non those articles alone, and estimating the profit at 33 per cent., it\r\nshows a street expenditure of 3900_l._ One brace-seller considered that\r\n500 such sellers was too low a number; but the most intelligent I met\r\nwith agreed on that estimate.\r\n\r\nThe Belts sold in the street are nearly all of stout cotton web, “with\r\nIndia-rubber threads,” and usually of a drab colour, woollen belts\r\nbeing rarely ever seen now. They are procured in the same way, and\r\nsold by the same parties, as are braces. The amount expended on belts\r\nis, from the best information I can command, about an eighth of that\r\nexpended on braces. The belts are sold at 1_s._ each, and cost 8_s._\r\nthe dozen, or 9_d._ each, if only one be purchased.\r\n\r\nThe street-sale of hose used to be far more considerable than it is\r\nnow, and was, in a great measure, in the hands of a class who had\r\npersonal claims to notice, independent of the goodness of their wares.\r\nThese were old women, wearing, generally, large white aprons, and\r\nchintz-patterned gowns, and always scrupulously clean. They carried\r\nfrom door to door, in the quieter streets, and in the then suburbs,\r\nstockings of their “own knitting.” Such they often were; and those\r\nwhich were not were still knitted stockings, although they might be\r\nthe work of old women in the country, who knitted by the fireside,\r\nneeding no other light on winter evenings and at the doors of their\r\ncottages in the sunshine in summer. Of these street-sellers some were\r\nblind. Between thirty and forty years ago, I am told, there were from\r\ntwelve to twenty blind knitters, but my informant could not speak with\r\ncertainty, as he might probably observe the same women in different\r\nparts. The blind stocking-sellers would knit at a door as they waited.\r\nThe informant I have quoted thought that the last of these knitters\r\nand street-sellers disappeared upwards of twenty years ago, as he\r\nthen missed her from his door, at which she used to make her regular\r\nperiodical appearance. The stockings of this trade were most frequently\r\nof white lamb’s-wool, and were sold at from 3_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._\r\n6_d._ They were long in the leg, and were suited “for gentle-people’s\r\nwinter wear.” The women-sellers made in those days, I am assured, a\r\ncomfortable livelihood.\r\n\r\nThe sale of stockings is now principally in the hands of the men who\r\nvend braces, &c. The kind sold is most frequently unbleached cotton.\r\nThe price to a street-buyer is generally from 6_d._ to 9_d._; but the\r\ntrade is of small extent. “It’s one of the trades,” a street-seller\r\nsaid to me, “that we can’t compete with shop-keepers in. You shall\r\ngo to a haberdashery swag-shop, and though they have ‘wholesale\r\nhaberdashers,’ and ‘hawkers supplied’ on the door-post, you’ll see a\r\npair of stockings in the window marked with a very big and very black\r\n6, and a very little and not half black 3/4; and if I was to go in,\r\nthey’d very likely ask me 6_s._ 6_d._ a dozen for an inferior thing.\r\nThey retail themselves, and won’t be undersold if they can help it, and\r\nso they don’t care to accommodate us in things that’s always going.”\r\n\r\nA few pairs of women’s stockings are hawked by women, and sold to\r\nservant-maids; but the trade in these goods, I am informed, including\r\nall classes of sellers--of whom there may be fifty--does not exceed\r\n(notwithstanding the universality of the wear), the receipt of 6_s._\r\nweekly per individual, with a profit of from 1_s._ 4_d._ to 2_s._, and\r\nan aggregate expenditure of about 800_l._ in the year. The trade is an\r\naddition to some other street trade.\r\n\r\nThe brace-sellers used to carry with their wares another article,\r\nof which India-rubber web formed the principal part. These were\r\ntrowser-straps, “with leather buttonings and ingy-spring bodies.”\r\nIt was only, however, the better class of brace-sellers who carried\r\nthem; those who, as my informant expressed it, “had a full stock;” and\r\ntheir sale was insignificant. At one time, the number of brace-sellers\r\noffering these straps was, I am informed, from 70 to 100. “It was a\r\npoor trade, sir,” said one of the class. “At first I sold at 4_d._,\r\nas they was 6_d._ in middling shops, and 1_s._ in the toppers, if\r\nnot 1_s._ 6_d._; but they soon came down to 3_d._, and then to 2_d._\r\nMy profit was short of 3_d._ in 1_s._ My best customers for braces\r\ndidn’t want such things; plain working-men don’t. And grooms, and\r\nstable-keepers generally, wears boots or knee-gaiters, and footmen\r\nsports knee-buckles and stockings. All I did sell to was, as far as I\r\ncan judge, young mechanics as liked to turn out like gents on a Sunday\r\nor an evening, and real gents that wanted things cheap. I very seldom\r\ncleared more than 1_s._ a week on them. The trade’s over now. If you\r\nsee a few at a stand, it’s the remains of an old stock, or some that a\r\nswag-shop has pushed out for next to nothing to be rid of them.”\r\n\r\nThe sale of waistcoats is confined to Smithfield, as regards the class\r\nI now treat of--the sellers of articles made by others. Twelve or\r\nfourteen years back, there was a considerable sale in what was a branch\r\nof duffing. Waistcoats were sold to countrymen, generally graziers’\r\nservants, under the pretence that they were of fine silk plush, which\r\nwas then rather an object of rustic Sunday finery. A drover told me\r\nthat a good many years ago he saw a countryman, with whom he was\r\nconversing at the time, pay 10_s._ 6_d._ for a “silk plush waistcoat,”\r\nthe vendor having asked 15_s._, and having walked away--no doubt\r\nremarking the eagerness of his victim--when the countryman refused to\r\ngive more than 10_s._ “He had a customer set for it,” he said, “at\r\nhalf-a-guinea.” On the first day the waistcoat was worn--the drover was\r\nafterwards told by the purchaser--it was utterly spoiled by a shower of\r\nrain; and when its possessor asked the village tailor the value of the\r\ngarment, he was told that it had no value at all; the tailor could not\r\neven tell what it was made of, but he never saw anything so badly made\r\nin his life; never. Some little may be allowed for the natural glee\r\nof a village tailor on finding one of his customers, who no doubt was\r\nproud of his London bargain, completely taken in; but these waistcoats,\r\nI am assured by a tailor who had seen them, were the veriest rubbish.\r\nThe trade, however, has been unknown, unless with a few rare exceptions\r\nat a very busy time--such as the market for the show and sale of the\r\nChristmas stock--since the time specified.\r\n\r\nThe waistcoats now sold in Smithfield market, or in the public-houses\r\nconnected with it, are, I am told, and also by a tailor, very paltry\r\nthings; but the price asked removes the trade from the imputation of\r\nduffing. These garments are sold at from 1_s._ to 4_s._ 6_d._ each;\r\nbut very rarely 4_s_. 6_d_. The shilling waistcoats are only fit for\r\nboys--or “youths,” as the slop-tailors prefer styling them--but 1_s._\r\n6_d._ is a common price enough; and seven-eighths of the trade, I am\r\ninformed, is for prices under, or not exceeding, 2_s._ The trade is,\r\nmoreover, very small. There are sometimes no waistcoat-sellers at all;\r\nbut generally two, and not unfrequently three. The profits of these men\r\nare 1_s._ on a bad, and 2_s._ 6_d._ on a good day. As, at intervals,\r\nthese street-sellers dispose of a sleeve-waistcoat (waistcoat with\r\nsleeves) at from 4_s._ 6_d._ to 6_s._, we may estimate the average\r\nearnings in the trade at 5_s._ per market day, or 10_s._ in the week.\r\nThis shows an outlay of 78_l._ in the year, as the profits of these\r\nstreet traders may be taken at 33 per cent.; or, as it is almost\r\ninvariably worded by such classes, “4_d._ in the 1_s._” The material is\r\nof a kind of cotton made to look as stout as possible, the back, &c.,\r\nbeing the commonest stuff. They are supplied by a slop-house at the\r\nEast End, and are made by women, or rather girls.\r\n\r\nThe sale of waistcoats in the street, markets, &c., is of second-hand\r\ngoods, or otherwise in the hands of a distinct class. There are other\r\nbelts, and other portions of wearing apparel, which, though not of\r\ntextile fabrics, as they are often sold by the same persons as I have\r\njust treated of, may be described here. These are children’s “patent\r\nleather” belts, trowser-straps, and garters.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of children’s and men’s belts and trowser-straps are less\r\nnumerous than they were, for both these things, I am told, but only\r\non street authority, are going out of fashion. From one elderly man\r\nwho had “dropped belts, and straps, and all that, for oranges,” I\r\nheard bitter complaints of the conduct of the swag shop-keepers who\r\nsupplied these wares. The substance of his garrulous and not very lucid\r\ncomplaint was that when boys’ patent leather belts came into fashion,\r\neleven, twelve, or thirteen years back, he could not remember which,\r\nthe usual price in the shops was 1_s._, and they were soon to be had in\r\nthe streets for 6_d._ each. The belt-sellers “did well” for a while.\r\nBut the “swags” who, according to my informant, at first supplied belts\r\nof patent horse-leather, came to substitute patent sheep-leather for\r\nthem, which were softer, and looked as well. The consequence was, that\r\nwhenever the sheep-leather belts were wet, or when there was any “pull”\r\nupon them, they stretched, and “the polish went to cracks.” After\r\nhaving been wet a few times, too, they were easily torn, and so the\r\nstreet trade became distrusted. It was the same with trowser-straps.\r\n\r\nThe belt trade is now almost extinct in the streets, and the strap\r\ntrade, which was chiefly in the hands of old and infirm, and young\r\npeople, is now confined to the sellers of dog-collars, &c. The\r\ntrowser-straps are not glazed or patent-leather, now, but “plain calf;”\r\nsold at 2_d._ a pair generally, and bought at from 1_s._ 2_d._ to 1_s._\r\n4_d._ the dozen pairs. Many readers will remember how often they used\r\nto hear the cry, “Three pair for sixpence! Three pair for sixpence!” A\r\ncry now, I believe, never heard.\r\n\r\nAmong the belt and strap-sellers were some blind persons. One man\r\ncounted to me three blind men whom he knew selling them, and one sells\r\nthem still, attached to the rails by St. Botolph’s church, Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nThe same persons who sold straps, &c., not including the present\r\nsellers, the dog-collar men, &c., had lately no small traffic in the\r\nvending of garters. The garter-sellers were, however, far more numerous\r\nthan ever were the strap-sellers. At one time, I am told, there were\r\n200 garter sellers; all old or infirm, or poor women, or children,\r\nand chiefly Irish children. As these children were often stockingless\r\nand shoeless, their cry of “Penny a pair! India-rubber garters, penny\r\na pair!” was sometimes pitiful enough, as they were offering a cheap\r\narticle, unused by themselves. The sudden influx of garters, so to\r\nspeak, was owing, I am told, to a manufacturer having discovered a\r\ncheap way of “working the India-rubber threads,” and having “thrown\r\na lot into the market through the swag shops.” The price was at\r\nfirst 8_s._ a gross (8_d._ a dozen), but as the demand increased, it\r\nwas raised to 9_s._ and 9_s._ 6_d._ The trade continued about six\r\nweeks, but has now almost entirely ceased. The stock of garters still\r\noffered for sale is what stall-keepers have on hand, or what swag\r\nshop-keepers tempt street-sellers to buy by reducing the price. The\r\nleather garter-trade, 1_d._ a pair being the usual price for sheep-skin\r\ngarters, is now almost unknown. It was somewhat extensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BOOT AND STAY-LACES, &C.\r\n\r\nLike many street-callings which can be started on the smallest means,\r\nand without any previous knowledge of the article sold being necessary\r\nto the street-vendor, the boot and stay-lace trade has very many\r\nfollowers. I here speak of those who _sell_ boot-laces, and subsist, or\r\nendeavour to subsist, by the sale, without mixing it up with begging.\r\nThe majority, indeed the great majority, of these street traders are\r\nwomen advanced in years, and, perhaps, I may say the whole of them are\r\nvery poor. An old woman said to me, “I just drag on, sir, half-starving\r\non a few boot-laces, rather than go into the workhouse, and I know\r\nnumbers doing the same.”\r\n\r\nThe laces are bought at the haberdashery swag-shops I have spoken of,\r\nand amongst these old women I found the term “swag-shop” as common as\r\namong men who buy largely at such establishments. The usual price for\r\nboot-laces to be sold in the streets is 1_d._ a dozen. Each lace is\r\ntagged at both ends, sufficing for a pair of boots. The regular retail\r\nprice is three a penny, but the lace-sellers are not unfrequently\r\ncompelled to give four, or lose a customer. A better quality is sold\r\nat 1-1/2_d._ and 2_d._ a dozen, but these are seldom meddled with by\r\nthe street lace-sellers. It is often a matter of strong endeavour for a\r\npoor woman to make herself mistress of 11_d._, the whole of which she\r\ncan devote to the purchase of boot-laces, as for 11_d._ she can procure\r\na gross, so saving 1_d._ in twelve dozen.\r\n\r\nThe stay-laces, which are bought at the same places, and usually sold\r\nby the same street-traders, are 2_d._ and 2-1/2_d._ the dozen. I am\r\ntold that there are as many of the higher as of the lower priced\r\nstay-laces bought for street sale, “because,” one of the street-sellers\r\ntold me “there’s a great many servant girls, and others too, that’s\r\nvery particular about their stay-laces.” The stay-laces are retailed at\r\n1/2_d._ each.\r\n\r\nThese articles are vended at street-stalls, along with other things\r\nfor female use; but the most numerous portion of the lace-sellers are\r\nitinerant, walking up and down a street market, or going on a round in\r\nthe suburbs, calling at every house where they are known, or where, as\r\none woman expressed it, “we make bold to venture.” Those frequenting\r\nthe street-markets, or other streets or thoroughfares, usually carry\r\nthe boot-laces in their hands, and the stay-laces round their necks,\r\nand offer them to the females passing. Their principal customers are\r\nthe working-classes, the wives and daughters of small shop-keepers, and\r\nservant-maids. “Ladies, of course,” said one lace-seller, “won’t buy of\r\nus.” Another old woman whom I questioned on the subject, and who had\r\nsold laces for about fourteen years, gave me a similar account; but she\r\nadded:--“I’ve sold to high-up people though. Only two or three weeks\r\nback, a fine-dressed servant maid stopped me and said, ‘Here, I must\r\nhave a dozen boot-laces for mistress, and she says, she’ll only give\r\n3_d._ for them, as it’s a dozen at once. A mean cretur she is. It’s\r\ngrand doings before faces, and pinchings behind backs, at our house.’”\r\n\r\nAmong the lace-sellers having rounds in the suburbs are some who\r\n“have known better days.” One old woman had been companion and\r\nhousekeeper to a lady, who died in her arms, and whose legacy to her\r\ncompanion-servant enabled her to furnish a house handsomely. This she\r\nlet out in apartments at “high-figures,” and anything like a regular\r\npayment by her lodgers would have supplied her with a comfortable\r\nmaintenance. But fine gentlemen, and fine ladies too, went away in her\r\ndebt; she became involved, her furniture was seized, and step by step\r\nshe was reduced to boot-lace selling. Her appearance is still that of\r\n“the old school;” she wears a very large bonnet of faded black silk, a\r\nshawl of good material, but old and faded, and always a black gown. The\r\npoor woman told me that she never ventured to call even at the houses\r\nwhere she was best received if she saw any tax-gatherer go to or from\r\nthe house: “I know very well what it is,” she continued, “it’s no use\r\nmy calling; they’re sure to be cross, and the servants will be cross\r\ntoo, because their masters or mistresses are cross with them. If the\r\ntax-gatherer’s not paid, they’re cross at being asked; if he is paid,\r\nthey’re cross at having had to part with their money. I’ve paid taxes\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThe dress of the boot lace-sellers generally is that of poor elderly\r\nwomen, for the most part perhaps a black chip, or old straw bonnet\r\n(often broken) and a dark-coloured cotton gown. Their abodes are in\r\nthe localities in all parts of the metropolis, which I have frequently\r\nspecified as the abodes of the poor. They live most frequently in\r\ntheir own rooms, but the younger, and perhaps I may add, coarser, of\r\nthe number, resort to lodging-houses. It is not very uncommon, I was\r\ntold by one of the class, for two poor women, boot-lace sellers or in\r\nsome similar line, “to join” in a room, so saving half the usual rent\r\nof 1_s._ 6_d._ for an unfurnished room. This arrangement, however, is\r\noften of short duration. There is always arising some question, I was\r\ntold, about the use or wear of this utensil or the other, or about\r\nwashing, or about wood and coals, if one street-seller returned an\r\nhour or two before her companion. This is not to be wondered at, when\r\nwe bear in mind that to these people every farthing is of consequence.\r\nFrom all that I can learn, the boot-lace sellers (I speak of the\r\nwomen) are poor and honest, and that, as a body, they are little mixed\r\nup with dishonest characters and dishonest ways. The exceptions are,\r\nI understand, among some hale persons, such as I have alluded to as\r\nsojourning in the lodging-houses. Some of these traders receive a\r\nlittle parochial relief.\r\n\r\nOne intelligent woman could count up 100 persons depending chiefly\r\nupon the sale of boot and stay-laces, in what she called her own\r\nneighbourhood. This comprised Leather-lane, Holborn, Tottenham\r\nCourt-road, the Hampstead-road, and all the adjacent streets. From\r\nthe best data at my command, I believe there are not fewer than 500\r\nindividuals _selling_ these wares in London. Several lace-sellers\r\nagreed in stating that they sold a dozen boot-laces a-day, and a dozen\r\nstay-laces, and 2 dozen extra on Saturday nights; but the drawbacks of\r\nbad weather, &c., reduce the average sale to not more than 6 dozen a\r\nweek, or 1,872,000 boot-laces in a year, at an outlay to the public of\r\n3,900_l._ yearly; from a half to three-fourths of the receipts being\r\nthe profit of the street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe same quantity of stay-laces sold at 6_d._ a dozen shows an outlay\r\nof 3,900_l._, with about an equally proportional profit to the sellers.\r\n\r\nMost of these traders sell tapes and other articles as well as laces.\r\nThe tapes cost 3_d._ and 3-1/2_d._ the dozen, and are sold at 1/2_d._\r\na knot. A dozen in 2 days is an average sale, but I have treated more\r\nexpressly of those who depend principally upon boot-lace selling for\r\ntheir livelihood. Their average profits are about 3_s._ a week, on\r\nlaces alone. The trade, I am told, was much more remunerative a few\r\nyears back, and the decline was attributed “to so many getting into the\r\ntrade, and the button boots becoming as fashionable as the Adelaides.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A BLIND FEMALE SELLER OF “SMALL-WARES.”\r\n\r\nI now give an account of the street-trade, the feelings, and the life\r\nof a poor blind woman, who may be seen nearly every fine day, selling\r\nwhat is technically termed “small-ware,” in Leather-lane, Holborn. The\r\nstreet “small-wares” are now understood to be cotton-tapes, pins, and\r\nsewing cotton; sometimes with the addition of boot and stay-laces, and\r\nshirt-buttons.\r\n\r\nI saw the blind small-ware seller enter her own apartment, which was on\r\nthe first floor of a small house in a court contiguous to her “pitch.”\r\nThe entrance into the court was low and narrow; a tall man would be\r\ncompelled to stoop as he entered the passage leading into the court.\r\nHere were unmistakeable signs of the poverty of the inhabitants.\r\nSoapsuds stood in the choked gutter, old clothes were hung out to dry\r\nacross the court, one side being a dead wall, and the windows were\r\npatched with paper, sometimes itself patched with other paper. In front\r\nof one window, however, was a rude gate-work, behind which stood a root\r\nof lavender, and a campanula, thriving not at all, but yet, with all\r\ntheir dinginess, presenting a relief to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe room of the blind woman is reached by a very narrow staircase,\r\non which two slim persons could not pass each other, and up old and\r\nworn stairs. Her apartment may be about ten feet square. The window\r\nhad both small and large panes, with abundance of putty plastering.\r\nThe furniture consisted of a small round deal table (on which lay the\r\npoor woman’s stock of black and white tapes, of shirt-buttons, &c.),\r\nand of four broken or patched chairs. There were a few motley-looking\r\n“pot” ornaments on the mantel-shelf, in the middle of which stood a\r\ndoctor’s bottle. The bust of a female was also conspicuous, as was a\r\ntobacco-pipe. Above the mantel-piece hung some pictureless frames,\r\nwhile a pair of spectacles were suspended above a little looking-glass.\r\nOver a cupboard was a picture of the Ethiopian serenaders, and on\r\nthe uncoloured walls were engravings of animals apparently from some\r\nwork on natural history. There were two thin beds, on one of which\r\nwas stowed a few costermonger’s old baskets and old clothes (women’s\r\nand boys’), as if stowed away there to make room to stir about. All\r\nthe furniture was dilapidated. An iron rod for a poker, a pair of old\r\ntongs, and a sheet-iron shovel, were by the grate, in which glimmered\r\na mere handful of fire. All showed poverty. The rent was 1_s._ a week\r\n(it had been 1_s._ 9_d._), and the blind woman and a lodger (paying\r\n6_d._ of the rent) slept in one bed, while a boy occupied the other.\r\nA wiry-haired dog, neither handsome nor fat, received a stranger (for\r\nthe blind woman, and her guide and lodger, left their street trade\r\nat my request for their own room) with a few querulous yelps, which\r\nsubsided into a sort of whining welcome to me, when the animal saw his\r\nmistress was at ease. The pleasure with which this poor woman received\r\nand returned the caresses of her dog was expressed in her face. I may\r\nadd that owing to a change of street names in that neighbourhood, I had\r\nsome difficulty in finding the small-ware seller, and heard her poor\r\nneighbours speak well of her as I inquired her abode; usually a good\r\nsign among the poor.\r\n\r\nThe blind tape-seller is a tall and somewhat strongly-formed woman,\r\nwith a good-humoured and not a melancholy expression of face, though\r\nher manner was exceedingly quiet and subdued and her voice low. Her\r\nage is about 50. She wore, what I understand is called a “half-widow’s\r\ncap;” this was very clean, as indeed was her attire generally, though\r\nworn and old.\r\n\r\nI have already given an account of a female small-ware seller (which\r\naccount formerly appeared in one of my letters in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_) strongly illustrating the vicissitudes of a street life.\r\nIt was the statement, however, of one who is no longer in the streets,\r\nand the account given by the blind tape and pin seller is further\r\ninteresting as furnishing other habitudes or idiosyncracies of the\r\nblind (or of an individual blind woman), in addition to those before\r\ndetailed; more especially in its narrative of the feelings of a perhaps\r\nnot very sensitive woman who became “dark” (as she always called it) in\r\nmature age.\r\n\r\n“It’s five years, sir,” she said, “since I have been quite dark, but\r\nfor two years before that I had lost the sight of one eye. Oh, yes,\r\nI had doctors but they couldn’t save my eyesight. I lost it after\r\nillnesses and rheumatics, and from want and being miserable. I felt\r\n_very_ miserable when I first found myself quite dark, as if everything\r\nwas lost to me. I felt as if I’d no more place in the world; but one\r\ngets reconciled to most things, thank God, in time; but I’m often low\r\nand sad now. Living poorly and having a sickly boy to care about may be\r\none reason, as well as my blindness and being so bad off.\r\n\r\n“I was brought up to service, and was sent before that to St. Andrew’s\r\nschool. I lost my parents and friends (relatives) when I were young.\r\nI was in my first place eighteen months, and was eight or nine years\r\nin service altogether, mostly as maid of all work. I saved a little\r\nmoney and married. My husband was a costermonger, and we didn’t do\r\nwell. Oh, dear no, sir, because he was addicted to drinking. We often\r\nsuffered great pinching. I can’t say as he was unkind to me. He died\r\nnine years or more since. After that I supported myself, and two sons\r\nwe had, by going out to wash and ‘chair.’ I did that when my husband\r\nwas living. I had tidy work, as I ‘chaired’ and washed for one family\r\nin Clerkenwell for ten years, and might again if I wasn’t dark. My\r\neldest son’s now a soldier and is with his regiment at Dover. He’s\r\nonly eighteen, but he could get nothing to do as hard as he tried; I\r\ncouldn’t help him; he knew no trade; and so he ’listed. Poor fellow!\r\nperhaps I shall never see him again. Oh, _see_ him! That I couldn’t\r\nif he was sitting as near me as you are, sir; but perhaps I may never\r\nhear his voice again. Perhaps he’ll have to go abroad and be killed.\r\nIt’s a sad thought that for a blind widow; I think of it both up and in\r\nbed. Blind people thinks a great deal, I feel they does. My youngest\r\nson--he’s now fourteen--is asthmatical; but he’s such a good lad, so\r\neasily satisfied. He likes to read if he can get hold of a penny book,\r\nand has time to read it. He’s at a paper-stainer’s and works on fancy\r\nsatin paper, which is very obnicious” (the word she used twice for\r\npernicious or obnoxious) “to such a delicate boy. He has 5_s._ a week,\r\nbut, oh dear me, it takes all that for his bit of clothes, and soap\r\nfor washing, and for shoes, and then he must carry his dinner with him\r\nevery day, which I makes ready, and as he has to work hard, poor thing,\r\nhe requires a little meat. I often frets about his being so weakly;\r\noften, as I stands with my tapes and pins, and thinks, and thinks. But,\r\nthank God, I can still wash for him and myself, and does so regularly.\r\nNo, I can’t clean my room myself, but a poor woman who lives by selling\r\nboot-laces in the streets has lodged with me for many years, and she\r\nhelps me.”\r\n\r\n“Lives!” interrupted the poor boot-lace woman, who was present,\r\n“starves, you mean; for all yesterday I only took a farthing. But\r\nanything’s better than the house. I’ll live on 4_d._ a day, and pay\r\nrent and all, and starve half my time, rather nor the great house” (the\r\nUnion).\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” resumed the blind woman, “for when I first went dark,\r\nI was forced to send to my parish, and had 6_d._ twice a week, and a\r\nhalf-quartern loaf, and that was only allowed for three weeks, and then\r\nthere was the house for me. Oh dear, after that I didn’t know what\r\nI could do to get a bit of bread. At first I was so frightened and\r\nnervous, I was afraid of every noise. That was when I was quite dark;\r\nand I am often frightened at nothing still, and tremble as I stand\r\nin the lane. I was at first greatly distressed, and in pain, and was\r\nvery down-hearted. I was so put about that I felt as if I was a burden\r\nto myself, and to everybody else. If you lose your sight as I did,\r\nsir, when you’re not young, it’s a long time _before you learns to be\r\nblind_. [So she very expressly worded it.] A friend advised me to sell\r\ntapes and cottons, and boot-laces, in the street, as better than doing\r\nnothing; and so I did. But at first I was sure every minute I should\r\nbe run on. The poor woman that lodges with me bought some things for\r\nme where she buys her own--at Albion-house, in the Borough. O, I does\r\nvery badly in my trade, very badly. I now clear only 2_d._, 3_d._, or\r\n4_d._ a day; no, I think not more than 1_s._ 6_d._ a week; that is all.\r\nWhy, one day this week I only sold a ha’porth of pins. But what I make\r\nmore than pays my rent, and it’s a sort of employment; something to do,\r\nand make one feel one’s not quite idle. I hopes to make more now that\r\nnights are getting long, for I can then go into the lane (Leather-lane)\r\nof an evening, and make 1_d._ or 2_d._ extra. I daren’t go out when\r\nit’s long dark evenings, for the boys teases me, and sometimes comes\r\nand snatches my tapes and things out of my hands, and runs away, and\r\nleaves me there robbed of my little stock. I’m sure I don’t know\r\nwhether it’s young thieves as does it, or for what they calls a lark. I\r\nonly knows I loses my tapes. Do I complain to the police, do you say,\r\nsir? I don’t know when a policeman’s passing, in such a crowded place.\r\nOh yes, I could get people to complain for me, but perhaps it would be\r\nno good; and then I’m afraid of the police; they’re so arbitry. [Her\r\nword.] It’s not very long since one of them--and I was told afterwards\r\nhe was a sergeant, too--ordered me to move on. ‘I can’t move on, sir,’\r\nsaid I, ‘I wish I could, but I must stand still, for I’m blind.’ ‘I\r\nknow that,’ says he, ‘but you’re begging.’ ‘No, I’m not,’ says I,\r\n‘I’m only a trying to sell a few little things, to keep me out of the\r\nwork’us.’ ‘Then what’s that thing you have tied over your breast?’\r\nsays he. ‘If you give me any more of your nonsense, I’ll lock you up;’\r\nand then he went away. I’m terrified to think of being taken to the\r\nstation.”\r\n\r\nThe matter which called forth the officer’s wrath, was a large card,\r\ntied from the poor woman’s shoulders, on which was printed, in large\r\nletters, “PLEASE TO BUY OF THE POOR BLIND.” “Ay,” said the blind\r\nwoman’s companion, with a bitterness not uncommon on the part of\r\nstreet-sellers on such occasions, “and any shopkeeper can put what\r\nnotice he likes in his window, that he can, if it’s ever such a lie,\r\nand nothing’s said if _he_ collects a crowd; oh dear, no. But _we_\r\nmus’n’t say our lives is our own.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said the blind woman, as I questioned her further, “there\r\nI stands, and often feels as if I was half asleep, or half dreaming;\r\nand I sometimes hardly knows when I dreams, and what I thinks; and I\r\nthink what it was like when I had my eyesight and was among them, and\r\nwhat it would be like if I had my eyesight again; all those people\r\nmaking all that noise, and trying to earn a penny, seems so queer. And\r\nI often thinks if people suffered ever so much, they had something to\r\nbe thankful for, if they had their eyesight. If I’d been dark from a\r\nchild, I think I shouldn’t have felt it so much. It wouldn’t have been\r\nlike all that lost, and I should be handier, though I’m not bad that\r\nway as it is, but I’m afraid to go out by myself. Where I lives there’s\r\nso many brokers about, I should run against their furniture. I’m\r\nsometimes not spoken to for an hour and more. Many a day I’ve only took\r\n1_d._ Then I thinks and mopes about what will become of me, and thinks\r\nabout my children. I don’t know who buys of me, but I’m sure I’m very\r\nthankful to all as does. They takes the things out of my hands, and\r\nputs the money into them. I think they’re working-people as buys of\r\nme, but I can’t be sure. Some speaks to me very kind and pleasant. I\r\ndon’t think they’re ladies that speaks kind. My husband used to say\r\nthat if ladies went to places like the Lane, it was on the sly, to get\r\nsomething cheap, and they did’nt want to be seen there, or they might\r\nbe counted low. I’m sure he was right. And it ain’t such as them as\r\nbuys of a poor blind woman out of kindness. No, sir, it’s very seldom\r\nindeed that I get more than the regular price. A halfpenny a knot for\r\nmy tapes; and a halfpenny and a farthing for pins; and a halfpenny\r\nand a penny a dozen for shirt-buttons; and three a penny when I sells\r\nboot-laces; and a halfpenny a piece when I has stay-laces. I sells good\r\nthings, I know, for the friend as gets them wouldn’t deceive me, and I\r\nnever has no complaints of them.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any other blind woman in the trade besides myself. No, I\r\ndon’t associate with blind people. I wasn’t brought up, like, to such a\r\nthing, but am in it by accident. I can’t say how many blind women there\r\nmay be in my line in the streets. I haven’t the least notion. I took\r\nlittle notice of them, God forgive me, when I had my eyesight, and I\r\nhaven’t been thrown among them since. Whether there’s many of them or\r\nnot, they’re all to be pitied.\r\n\r\n“On a Sunday I never stirs out, except to chapel, with my lodger or my\r\nson. No, sir, not a Roman Catholic chapel, but a Protestant. When it’s\r\nnot very fine weather we goes to the nearest, but you hears nothing but\r\nwhat’s good in any of them. Oh dear, no.\r\n\r\n“I lives on tea and bread and butter all the week--yes, I can make it\r\nready myself--except on Sundays, when my son has his dinner here, and\r\nwe has a bit of cheap meat; not often fish; it’s troublesome. If bread\r\nand things wasn’t cheap I couldn’t live at all, and it’s hardly living\r\nas it is. What _can_ any one do on all that I can earn? There’s so many\r\nin the streets, I’m told, in my line, and distress drives more and more\r\nevery week--everybody says so, and wages is so bad, and there’s such\r\nunder-selling, that I don’t know whatever things will come to. I’ve no\r\n’spectation of anything better in the time that has to come, nothing\r\nbut misery, God help me. But I’m sure I should soon fret to death in a\r\nwork’us.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman lodging with the blind street-seller is herself in the\r\nsame trade, but doing most in boot and stay-laces. She has a sharp and\r\npinched outline of countenance, as if from poverty of diet, and is\r\nindeed wretchedly poor, earning only about 6_d._ a day, if so much. She\r\nis about the same age as her landlady, or somewhat younger, and has\r\napparently been good-looking, and has still an intelligent expression.\r\nShe lodged with the blind woman during her husband’s lifetime, when he\r\nrented two rooms, letting her one, and she had lived with the present\r\nwidow in this way about fourteen years. She speaks cheerfully and\r\nseems an excellent companion for a blind person. On my remarking that\r\nthey could neither of them be very cross-tempered to have lived so long\r\ntogether, the lodger said, laughingly, “O, we have a little tiff now\r\nand then, sir, as women will, you know; but it’s not often, and we soon\r\nare all right again. Poor people like us has something else to think of\r\nthan tiffs and gossipping.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND STREET-SELLER OF BOOT-LACES.\r\n\r\nThe character, thoughts, feelings, regrets, and even the dreams, of\r\na very interesting class of street-folk--the blind--are given in\r\nthe narratives I now proceed to lay before the reader, from blind\r\nstreet-folk; but a few words of general introduction are necessary.\r\n\r\nIt may be that among the uneducated--among those whose feelings and\r\nwhose bodies have been subjected to what may be called the wear\r\nand tear of poverty and privation--there is a tendency, even when\r\nmisfortunes the most pitiable and undeserved have been encountered, to\r\nfall from misery into mendicancy. Even the educated, or, as the street\r\npeople more generally describe them, those “who have seen better days,”\r\nsometimes, after the ordeal of the streets and the low lodging-houses,\r\nbecome trading mendicants. Among such people there may be, in one\r\ncapacity or other, the ability and sometimes the opportunity to labour,\r\nand yet--whether from irrepressible vagabondism, from utter repugnance\r\nto any _settled_ mode of subsistence (caused either by the natural\r\ndisposition of the individual, or by the utter exhaustion of mind and\r\nbody driving him to beg)--yet, I say, men of this class become beggars\r\nand even “lurkers.”\r\n\r\nAs this is the case with men who have the exercise of their limbs, and\r\nof the several senses of the body, there must be some mitigating plea,\r\nif not a full justification, in the conduct of those who beg directly\r\nor indirectly, because they _cannot_ and perhaps _never could_ labour\r\nfor their daily bread--I allude to those afflicted with blindness,\r\nwhether “from their youth up” or from the calamity being inflicted upon\r\nthem in maturer years.\r\n\r\nBy the present law, for a blind man to beg is to be amenable to\r\npunishment, and to be subjected to perhaps the bitterest punishment\r\nwhich can be put upon him--imprisonment; to a deprivation of what may\r\nbe his chief solace--the enjoyment of the fresh air; and to a rupture\r\nof the feeling, which cannot but be comforting to such a man, that\r\nunder his infirmity he still has the sympathies of his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, then, that the blind have a right to ask charity of\r\nthose whom God has spared so terrible an affliction, and who in the\r\nterms best understood by the destitute themselves, are “well to do;”\r\nthose whom--in the canting language of a former generation of blind\r\nand other beggars--“Providence has blessed with affluence.” This right\r\nto solicit aid from those to whom such aid does not even approach to\r\nthe sacrifice of any idle indulgence--to say nothing of any necessary\r\nwant--is based on their helplessness, but lapses if it becomes a mere\r\nbusiness, and with all the trickiness by which a street business is\r\nsometimes characterised.\r\n\r\nOn this question of moral right, as of political expediency, I quote an\r\nauthority which must command attention, that of Mr. Stuart Mill:--\r\n\r\nApart from any metaphysical considerations respecting the foundation\r\nof morals or of the social union, he says, “It will be admitted to\r\nbe right, that human beings should help one another; and the more\r\nso, in proportion to the urgency of the need; and none needs help so\r\nurgently as one who is starving. The claim to help, therefore, created\r\nby destitution, is one of the strongest which can exist; and there is\r\n_primâ facie_ the amplest reason for making the relief of so extreme an\r\nexigency as certain, to those who require it, as, by any arrangements\r\nof society, it can be made.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, in all cases of helping, there are two sets of\r\nconsequences to be considered; the consequences of the assistance\r\nitself, and the consequences of relying on the assistance. The former\r\nare generally beneficial, but the latter for the most part injurious;\r\nso much so, in many cases, as greatly to outweigh the value of the\r\nbenefit. And this is never more likely to happen than in the very cases\r\nwhere the need of help is the most intense. There are few things for\r\nwhich it is more mischievous, that people should rely on the habitual\r\naid of others, than for the means of subsistence, and unhappily there\r\nis no lesson which they more easily learn.” I may here mention, in\r\ncorroboration of this statement, that I was told by an experienced\r\nparochial officer, that there was truth in the saying, “Once a pauper,\r\nand always a pauper;” which seems to show that the lesson of relying on\r\nthe habitual aid of others may not only be learned with ease, but is\r\nforgotten with difficulty. “The problem to be solved,” continues Mr.\r\nMill, “is, therefore, one of peculiar nicety, as well as importance;\r\nhow to give the greatest amount of needful help, with the smallest\r\nencouragement to undue reliance on it.\r\n\r\n“Energy and self-dependence are, however,” Mr. Mill proceeds to argue,\r\nand, in this respect, it seems to me, to argue to demonstration,\r\n“liable to be impaired by _the absence of help, as well as by its\r\nexcess. It is even more fatal to exertion to have no hope of succeeding\r\nby it, than to be assured of succeeding without it._ When the\r\ncondition of any one is so disastrous that his energies are paralyzed\r\nby discouragement, assistance is a tonic, not a sedative: it braces,\r\ninstead of relaxing the active faculties: always provided that the\r\nassistance is not such as to dispense with self-help, by substituting\r\nitself for the person’s own labour, skill, and prudence, but is limited\r\nto affording him a better hope of attaining success by those legitimate\r\nmeans. This, accordingly, is a test to which all plans of philanthropy\r\nand benevolence should be brought, whether intended for the benefit of\r\nindividuals or of classes, and whether conducted on the voluntary or on\r\nthe government principle.\r\n\r\n“In so far as the subject admits of any general doctrine or maxim, it\r\nwould appear to be this--_that if assistance is given in such a manner\r\nthat the condition of the person helped is rendered as desirable as\r\nthat of another_ (in a similar grade of society) _who succeeds in\r\nmaintaining himself without help, the assistance, if systematic and\r\ncapable of being previously calculated upon, is MISCHIEVOUS: but if,\r\nwhile available to everybody, it leaves to all a strong motive to do\r\nwithout it if they can, it is then for the most part BENEFICIAL._”\r\n\r\nThat the workhouse should bring less comfort and even greater\r\nirksomeness and restraint to any able-bodied inmate, than is felt\r\nby the poorest agricultural labourer in the worst-paid parts of the\r\ncountry, or the most wretched slop tailor, or shoe-maker, or cabinet\r\nmaker in London, who supports himself by his own labour, is, I think, a\r\nsound principle. However wretched the ploughman may be in his hut, or\r\nthe tailor in his garret, he is what I have heard underpaid mechanics\r\ncall, still “his own man.” He is supported by his labour; he has\r\nescaped the indignity of a reliance on others.\r\n\r\nI need not now enter into the question whether or not the workhouse\r\nsystem has done more harm than good. Some harm it is assuredly doing,\r\nfor its over-discipline drives people to beg rather than apply for\r\nparish relief; and so the public are twice mulct, by having to pay\r\ncompulsorily, in the form of poor’s-rate, and by being induced to give\r\nvoluntarily, because they feel that the applicant for their assistance\r\ndeserves to be helped.\r\n\r\nBut although the dogma I have cited, respecting the condition of those\r\nin a workhouse, may be sound in principle as regards the able-bodied,\r\nhow does it apply to those who are not able-bodied? To those who\r\n_cannot_ work? And above all how does it apply to those to whom nature\r\nhas denied even the capacity to labour? To the blind, for instance?\r\nYet the blind man, who dreads the injustice of such a creed applied\r\nto his misfortune, is subject to the punishment of the mendacious\r\nbeggar, should he ask a passer-by to pity his afflictions. The law\r\nmay not often be enforced, but sometimes it is enforced--perhaps more\r\nfrequently in country than in town--and surely it is so enforced\r\nagainst abstract right and political morality. The blind beggar,\r\n“worried by the police,” as I have heard it described, becomes the\r\nmendacious beggar, no longer asking, in honesty, for a mite to which a\r\ncalamity that no prudence could have saved him gave him a fair claim,\r\nbut resorting to trick in order to increase his precarious gains.\r\n\r\nThat the blind resort to deceitful representations is unquestionable.\r\nOne blind man, I am informed, said to Mr. Child the oculist, when he\r\noffered to couch him, “Why, that would ruin me!” And there are many,\r\nI am assured, who live by the streets who might have their eyesight\r\nrestored, but who will not.\r\n\r\nThe public, however, must be warned to distinguish between those\r\ndetermined beggars and the really deserving and helpless blind. To\r\nallow their sympathies to be blunted against _all_, because some are\r\nbad, is a creed most consolatory to worldly successful selfishness, and\r\nalien to every principle of pure morals, as well as to that of more\r\nthan morals--the spirit of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the blind, apart from their mere sufferings as poor\r\nmen, are well described in some of the narratives I give, and the\r\naccount of a blind man’s dreams is full of interest. Man is blessed\r\nwith the power of seeing dreams, it should be remembered, _visionally_;\r\nbut the blind man, to whose statement I invite attention, dreams, it\r\nwill be seen, like the rest of his fraternity, through the sense of\r\nhearing, or of feeling, best known as “touching;” that is to say, by\r\naudible or tactile representations.\r\n\r\nSome of the poor blind, he told me, are polishers’ wheel-turners, but\r\nthere is not employment for one in one hundred at this. My informant\r\nonly knew two so engaged. People, he says, are glad to do it, and\r\nwill work at as low wages as the blind. Some of the blind, too, blow\r\nblacksmiths’ forges at foundries; others are engaged as cutlers’\r\nwheel-turners. “There was one talking to me the other day, and he\r\nsaid he’d get me a job that way.” Others again turn mangles, but at\r\nthis there is little employment to be had. Another blind acquaintance\r\nof my informant’s chops chaff for horses. Many of the blind are\r\nbasket-makers, learning the business at the blind school, but one-half,\r\nI am told, can’t make a living at this, after leaving the school;\r\nthey can’t do the work so neatly, and waste more rods than the other\r\nworkers. Other blind people are chair-bottomers, and others make rope\r\nmats with a frame, but all of these can scarcely make a living. Many\r\nblind people play church organs. Some blind men are shoemakers, but\r\ntheir work is so inferior, it is almost impossible to live by it.\r\n\r\nThe blind people are forced to the streets because, they say, they can\r\ndo nothing else to get a living; at no trade, even if they know one,\r\ncan they get a living, for they are not qualified to work against those\r\nwho can see; and what’s more, labourers’ wages are so low that people\r\ncan get a man with his eyesight at the same price as they could live\r\nupon. “There’s many a blind basket-weaver playing music in the streets\r\n’cause he can’t get work. At the trade I know one blind basket-maker\r\ncan make 15_s._ a-week at his trade, but then he has a good connection\r\nand works for hisself; the work all comes home. He couldn’t make half\r\nthat working for a shop. At turning wheels there’s nothing to be done;\r\nthere’s so many seeing men out of employment that’s glad to do the work\r\nat the same price as the blind, so that unless the blind will go into\r\nthe workhouse, they must fly to the streets. The police, I am told,\r\ntreat the blind very differently: some of the force are very good to\r\nthem, and some has no feeling at all--they shove them about worse than\r\ndogs; but the police is just like other men, good and bad amongst them.\r\nThey’re very kind to me,” said my blind informant, “and they have a\r\ndifficult duty to perform, and some persons, like Colonel Cavendish,\r\nmakes them harsher to us than they would be.” I inquired whether my\r\nblind informant had received one of the Census papers to fill up,\r\nand he told me that he had heard nothing about them, and that he had\r\ncertainly made no return to the government about his blindness; but\r\nwhat it was to the government whether he was blind or not, he couldn’t\r\ntell. His wife was blind as well as himself, and there was another\r\nblind man living in his room, and none of his blind friends, that he\r\nhad heard of, had ever received any of the papers.\r\n\r\n“Some blind people in the streets carry laces. There are some five\r\nmen and one woman at the West-end do this, and three of these have\r\ndogs to lead them; one stands always on Langham-place. One carries\r\ncabbage-nets, he is an old man of seventy year, with white hair, and\r\nis likewise led by a dog. Another carries matches (he has a large\r\nfamily), and he is often led by one of his boys. There is a blind woman\r\nwho always sits by the Polytechnic, and has indeed done so since it\r\nwas built. She gets her living by sewing, making caps and things for\r\nladies. Another blind woman obtains a livelihood by knitting garters\r\nand covers for bread trays and backs of chairs. She generally walks\r\nabout in the neighbourhood of Baker-street, and Portman-square. Many\r\nrecite a lamentation as they go along, but in many parts of London the\r\npolice will not allow them to do so.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very jealous place, is London. The police is so busy; but many\r\nrecites the lamentation for all that. It’s a feeling thing--Oh, they’re\r\nvery touching words.”\r\n\r\nThe greater part in the streets are musicians; five to one are, or\r\nten to one. My informant thinks, last Thursday week, there were seven\r\nblind musicians all playing through the streets together in one band.\r\nThere are four living in York-court; two in Grafton-court; two in\r\nClement’s-lane; one in Orchard-place; two in Gray’s-buildings; two in\r\nHalf-Moon-street, in the City, and two in a court hard by; one up by\r\nBall’s-pond; two in Rose-court, Whitechapel; three in Golden-lane; two\r\nat Chelsea; three in Westminster; one up at Paddington; one (woman)\r\nin Marylebone; one in Westminster; one in Gray’s-inn-lane; one in\r\nWhitechapel: in all thirty-one; but my informant was satisfied there\r\nmust be at least as many more, or sixty blind musicians in all.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a former inquiry into the character and condition\r\nof street performers, I received the following account from a blind\r\nmusician:--\r\n\r\n“The street blind tried, some years back, to maintain a burying and\r\nsick club of our own; but we were always too poor. We live in rooms. I\r\ndon’t know one blind musician who lives in a lodging-house. I myself\r\nknow a dozen blind men now performing in the streets of London. The\r\nblind musicians are chiefly married men. I don’t know one who lives\r\nwith a woman unmarried. The loss of sight changes a man, he doesn’t\r\nthink of women, and women don’t think of him. We are of a religious\r\nturn, too, generally.\r\n\r\n“When we agreed to form the blind club there was not more than a dozen\r\nmembers. These consisted of two basket-makers; one mat-maker; four\r\nviolin players; myself; and my two mates; and this was the number\r\nwhen it dropped for want of funds; that’s now sixteen years ago. We\r\nwere to pay 1_s._ a month, and sick members were to have 5_s._ a week\r\nwhen they had paid two years. Our other rules were the same as other\r\nclubs. There’s a good many blind who play at sailors dances, Wapping\r\nand Deptford way. We seldom hire children to lead us in the streets; we\r\nhave plenty of our own generally. I have five. Our wives are generally\r\nwomen that have their eyesight; but some blind men marry blind women.”\r\n\r\nMy informant was satisfied that there were at least 100 blind men and\r\nwomen getting their living in the streets, and about 500 throughout\r\nthe country. There are many who stay continually in Brighton, Bristol,\r\nLiverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Plymouth, and\r\nindeed all large towns. “There are a great many blind people, I am\r\ntold,” he said, “in Cornwall. It’s such a humane place for them; the\r\npeople has great feeling for the blind; they’re very religious there,\r\nand a many lose their sight in the mines, and that’s what makes them\r\nhave a feeling for others so.” This man heard a calculation made some\r\ntime back, that there were 5000 blind people, including those in\r\nschools and asylums, within five miles round St. Paul’s. The most of\r\nthe blind have lost their sight by the small-pox--nine out of every\r\nten of the musicians have done so; since the vaccination has been\r\ndiscovered, I am told the cases of blindness from small-pox have been\r\nconsiderably increased. “Oh, that was a very clever thing--very,” said\r\nthe blind boot-lace seller to me. Those who have not lost their sight\r\nby the small-pox, have gone blind from accidents, such as substances\r\nthrown or thrust in the eyes, or inflammation induced from cold and\r\nother ailments. My informant was not acquainted with one blind person\r\nin the streets who had been born blind. One of his acquaintance\r\nwho had been blind from birth caught the small-pox, and obtained\r\nhis sight after recovery at eight years old. “The great majority\r\nhave lost their sight at an early age--when mere children, indeed;\r\nthey have consequently been trained to no employment; those few who\r\nhave” (my informant knew two) “been educated in the blind schools as\r\nbasket-makers, are unable to obtain employment at this like a seeing\r\nperson. Why, the time that a blind man’s feeling for the hole to have\r\na rod through, a seeing man will have it through three or four times.\r\nThe blind people in the streets mostly know one another; they say they\r\nhave all a feeling of brotherly love for another, owing to their being\r\nsimilarly afflicted. If I was going along the street, and had a guide\r\nwith me that could see, they would say, ‘Here’s a blind man or blind\r\nwoman coming;’ I would say, ‘Put me up to them so as I’ll speak to\r\nthem;’ then I should say, as I laid my hand upon them, ‘Holloa, who’s\r\nthis?’ they’d say, ‘I’m blind.’ I should answer, ‘So am I.’ ‘What’s\r\nyour name?’ would be the next question. ‘Oh, I have heard tell of you,’\r\nmost like, I should say. ‘Do you know so and so?’ I would say, ‘Yes,\r\nhe’s coming to see me,’ or perhaps, ‘I’m going to see him on Sunday:’\r\nthen we say, ‘Do you belong to any of the Institutions?’ that’s the\r\nmost particular question of all; and if he’s not a traveller, and we\r\nnever heard tell of one another, the first thing we should ask would\r\nbe, ‘How did you lose your sight?’ You see, the way in which the blind\r\npeople in the streets gets to know one another so well, is by meeting\r\nat the houses of gentlemen when we goes for our pensions.”\r\n\r\nThe boot, shoe, and stay laces, are carried by the blind, I am told\r\n“seldom for sale;” for it’s very few they sell of them. “They have,”\r\nthey say, “to prevent the police or mendicity from interfering with\r\nthem, though the police do not often show a disposition to obstruct\r\nthem.” “The officers of the Mendicity Society,” they tell me, “are\r\ntheir worst enemies.” These, however, have desisted from molesting\r\nthem, because the magistrates object to commit a blind man to prison.\r\nThe blind never ask anybody for anything, they tell me their cry\r\nis simply “Bootlace! Bootlace!” When they do sell, they charge\r\n1-1/2_d._ per pair for the leather boot-laces, 1_d._ per pair the silk\r\nboot-laces, and 1/2_d._ per pair for the cotton boot-laces, and 1/2_d._\r\neach for the stay-laces. They generally carry black laces only, because\r\nthe white ones are so difficult to keep clean. For the stay-laces\r\nthey pay 2_d._ a dozen, and for the boot-laces 5_d._ a dozen, for the\r\nleather or for the silk ones; and 1-1/4_d._ for the cotton; each of the\r\nboot-laces is double, so that a dozen makes a dozen pair. They buy them\r\nvery frequently at a swag-shop in Compton-street. My informant carried\r\nonly the black-cotton laces, and doesn’t sell six-penny worth in a\r\nweek. He did not know of a blind boot lace-seller that sold more than\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n“Formerly the blind people in the street used to make a great deal of\r\nmoney; up to the beginning of the peace, and during all the war, the\r\nblind got money in handfuls. Where there was one blind man travelling\r\nthen, there’s ten now. If they didn’t take 2_l._ and 2_l._ 10_s._ a day\r\nin a large town, it was reckoned a bad day’s work for the musicianers.\r\nAlmost all the blind people then played music. In war time there was\r\nonly one traveller (tramp); there are 100 now. There was scarcely\r\na common lodging-house then in one town out of the three; and now\r\nthere’s not a village hardly in the country but what there’s one, and\r\nperhaps two or three. Why the lodging-houses coin money now. Look at a\r\ntraveller’s house where there’s twenty beds (two in each bed), at 3_d._\r\neach, and that’s 10_s._ you know. There was very few blind beggars\r\nthen, and what there was done well. Certainly, done well; they could\r\nget hatfuls of money almost, but then money was of no valley scarcely;\r\nyou could get nothing for it most; but now if you get a little, you\r\ncan buy a plenty with it. What is worth 6_d._ now fetched 2_s._ then.\r\nI wasn’t in the streets then, I wish I had been, I should have made\r\na fortin, I think I should. The blind beggars then could get 2_l._ a\r\nday if they went to look for it.” “I myself,” said one, “when I first\r\nbegan, have gone and sat myself down by the side of the road and got my\r\n1_l._, all in half-pence. When I went to Braintree, I stood beside a\r\npublic-house, the ‘Orange Tree,’ just by where the foot-people went on\r\nto the fair ground, and I took 15_s._ a day for two days only, standing\r\nthere a pattering my lamentation from 1 o’clock till the dusk in the\r\nevening. This is what I said:--\r\n\r\n  ‘You feeling Christians look with pity,\r\n    Unto my grief relate--\r\n  Pity my misfortune,\r\n    For my sufferings are great.\r\n\r\n  ‘I’m bound in dismal darkness--\r\n    A prisoner I am led;\r\n  Poor and blind, just in prime,\r\n    Brought to beg my bread.\r\n\r\n  ‘When in my pleasant youthful days\r\n    In learning took delight,\r\n\r\n(and when I was in the country I used to say)\r\n\r\n  And by the small-pox\r\n    I lost my precious sight.\r\n\r\n(some says by an inflammation)\r\n\r\n  ‘I’ve lost all earthly comforts,\r\n    But since it is God’s will,\r\n  The more I cannot see the day,\r\n    He’ll be my comfort still.\r\n\r\n  ‘In vain I have sought doctors,\r\n    Their learned skill did try,\r\n  But they could not relieve me,\r\n    Nor spare one single eye.\r\n\r\n  ‘So now in dismal darkness\r\n    For ever more must be,\r\n  To spend my days in silent tears,\r\n    Till death doth set me free.\r\n\r\n  ‘But had I all the treasures\r\n    That decks an Indian shore,\r\n  Was all in my possession,\r\n    I’d part with that wealthy store,\r\n\r\n  ‘If I once more could gain my sight,\r\n    And when could gladly view\r\n  That glorious light to get my bread,\r\n    And work once more like you.\r\n\r\n  ‘Return you, tender Christians dear,\r\n    And pity my distress;\r\n  Relieve a helpless prisoner,\r\n    That’s blind and comfortless.\r\n\r\n  ‘I hope that Christ, our great Redeemer,\r\n    Your kindness will repay,\r\n  And reward you with a blessing\r\n    On the judgment day.’\r\n\r\n“Some say ‘pity the poor blind,’ but the lamentation is better. It’s\r\na very feeling thing. Many people stands still and hears it right\r\nthrough, and gives a halfpenny. I’d give one myself any day to hear it\r\nwell said. I’m sure the first time I heard it the very flesh crept on\r\nmy bones. I larnt it to one blind man myself last summer.\r\n\r\n“Now just to show you the difference of things two year afterwards: I\r\nwent to the very same place where I had took 1_l._ by the road side,\r\nas I told, and all I got was 4_s._, so you can see how things was\r\nfalling. The day I took the 1_l._, there was only one blind man in the\r\ntown beside me; but when I got the 4_s._, there was three men blind\r\nthere. But things now is much worse--bless you, a hundred times worse.\r\nIf I went now to Braintree fair, I don’t think as I should take 3_s._\r\nYou see there’s so many blind men now about that I should’nt wonder if\r\nthere’d be eight or ten at that very fair; they don’t know where to run\r\nto now to get a halfpenny; there’s so many blind people that persons\r\nmakes game of them. If they see two near one another, they cries out,\r\nthere’s opposition! See what things is come to. Twelve year ago I\r\nshould have thought the town was completely done, and people quite\r\ntired of me. If I didn’t get my shilling going down only one side of\r\na street, and now I may go up and down and not get a penny. If I get\r\n3_d._ I am very well satisfied. But mind, I may perhaps sometimes\r\nmeet a gentlemen who may give me a shilling, or one who may give me\r\n2_s._ 6_d._; a person the other day tapped me on the shoulder, near\r\nBrook-street, and said, ‘Here’s half-a-crown for you.’ Why, even five\r\nyear ago one gentleman gave me 1_l._ twice over within three months,\r\nand Prince Napoleon gave me a sovereign last 23rd June was two year.\r\nI know the date, because that’s the day the blind people goes to the\r\nCloth Hall to get their quarter’s money, 25_s._, and I thought I was as\r\ngood as they.” My informant told me he does better than any of them.\r\n“Not one does better than me,” he said, “because I sticks to it night\r\nand day. It’s 12 o’clock every night before I leave the streets. You\r\nknow I leaves home by ten of a morning. I will have it to get a living.\r\nMany says they don’t know how I stand it to keep so long on my legs.\r\nI only has two meals a day--my breakfast, a bit of summat about five\r\nor six at a public-house--my dog though has plenty. I feeds him well,\r\npoor fellow. Many times I sleep as I go, and knock my stick just the\r\nsame as if I was awake. I get a comfortable living--always a little\r\nin debt. I’ve got a very good kerackter, thank God--indeed all the\r\nblind men has--they can always get credit; and my dog gets me many a\r\nshilling that I wouldn’t get at all. But then it’s dreadful slavery.\r\nI’ve never no amusement--always out excepting on Sunday. Then I’ve got\r\n5_l._ from Cloth Hall, besides a small pension of 1_s._, and 2_s._\r\n6_d._, and 5_s._ a year from different gentlemen, who allows us poor\r\nblind a small pension yearly. There are many gentleman do this at the\r\nWest-end. Some will allow 10_s._ a year, and some only 1_s._ a year,\r\nto a stated number; and they all pay on a particular day that they\r\nmay appoint. The Earl of Mansfield allows twenty-four destitute blind\r\npeople 10_s._ 6_d._ a year; and his mother gives two blind 1_l._, and\r\nfour 10_s._ The Baroness Rothschild gives to between seventy and eighty\r\n5_s._ a piece once a year.” (“Bless her,” said my informant, most\r\nheartily, “she is a good woman.”) “The Earl Stanhope gives to between\r\nforty and fifty the same sum every year, and he’s a fine kind-hearted\r\ngentleman. The Earl of Cork’s brother gives eight or nine of us a\r\nshilling a piece once a year. Lady Otway Cave, she is very good to us;\r\nshe gives seventy or eighty of us 1_s._ each every fust of May; but\r\nthe butler, like a many more, I am told, takes advantage of the blind,\r\nand puts them off with 6_d._, and takes a receipt from them for 1_s._\r\nThe Earl of Normanton gives 2_s._ 6_d._ to ten of us. Mrs. Managan, of\r\nMay-fair, gives three 2_s._ 6_d._ a piece. The Hon. Miss Brande 1_s._\r\na piece to eight. Lady Clements, Grosvenor-square, 2_s._ a piece to\r\nfifteen. The Marchioness of Aylesbury, 5_s._ a piece to about thirty.\r\nThe Earl of Harrowby gives twelve 5_s._ a piece. Lord Dudley Stuart\r\ngives to seven or eight 5_s._ a piece. Mr. Gurney, 1_s._ a piece to\r\nforty. Mr. Ellis, Arlington-street, 2_s._ 6_d._ a piece to fourteen.\r\nThe Marquis of Bute used to give 5_s._ a piece to sixty or seventy; but\r\nthe Marchioness, since his death, has discontinued his allowance. The\r\nDean of Westminster gives 1_s._ a piece to thirty on Boxing-day. Mr.\r\nSpottiswoode, 1_s._ a piece to about fourteen. Archbishop of Oxford,\r\n5_s._ a piece to twelve. Rev. Sir Samuel Jarvis, 2_s._ 6_d._ a piece\r\nto five. Lady Dundas, 1_s._ a piece to about fourteen or fifteen. The\r\nEarl of Besborough, 1_s._ each to ten. Lord Stafford, 1_s._ each to\r\nabout twenty; he used to give 2_s._ 6_d._, but, owing to his servant,\r\nI am told the sum has been reduced to 1_s._ Lady Isabella Thynne,\r\n1_s._ to ten. The Countess of Carlisle, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to sixteen.\r\nEarl Fitzwilliam used to give 5_s._ to some, and 2_s._ 6_d._ to\r\nothers, to about twenty. The Countess of Essex, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to\r\nthree. Lord Hatherton, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to twelve. John Ashley Warr,\r\nEsq., 5_s._ each to twenty-four. Lord Tynemouth, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to\r\nforty. Miss Vaughan, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to forty (this is bequeathed\r\nfor ever). Lord Saltoun, 5_s._ each to three. Mr. Hope, 1_s._ each\r\nto fifty. Mr. Warren (Bryanstone-square), 1_s._ each to twenty-five.\r\nMiss Howard (York-place), 1_s._ each to every blind person that calls\r\non Boxing-day. Sir John Curtis, 1_s._ each to eighty (this is also a\r\nbequest). Lady Beresford, 1_s._ each to forty. Lord Robert Grosvenor\r\ngives 1_l._ each to some few. The Countess of Andover, 2_s._ 6_d._ a\r\npiece to ten. Lord Stanley used to give 3_s._ to about twelve; but\r\ntwo years ago the allowance was discontinued. The Marquis of Bristol\r\ngives 10_s._ to eighteen. The Bishop of London, 5_s._ to every one that\r\ncan obtain a minister’s signature. Mr. Mackenzie (Devonshire-place),\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ to ten. Mr. Deacon, 2_s._ 6_d._ to ten. Miss Sheriff\r\n(Manchester-square), 1_s._ to twenty. Miss Morrison (Cadogan-place),\r\n1_s._ each to ten. Mrs. Kittoye (Wilton-crescent), 1_s._ to twenty.\r\nMrs. Ferguson, 2_s._ 6_d._ each to seven. The Earl of Haddington,\r\n10_s._ each to twelve.” I am assured that these are only half of the\r\ndonors to the blind, and that, with the exception of Lady Liddledam,\r\nthere is not one person living eastward of Tottenham Court-road, who\r\nallows the smallest pension to the blind. My informant told me that he\r\nknew of no attorneys, barristers, surgeons, physicians, soldiers or\r\nsailors, who distributed any money to the blind, nor one tradesman. “I\r\nthink I get 10_s._ a week regular,” he said. “While the quality’s in\r\ntown I’m safe. For other times I can’t count above 5_s._ a week at the\r\noutside--if it’s the least damp in the world, the quality will not come\r\nout. The musicians, you see, have got the chance of a damp day, for\r\nthen all the best people’s at home; but such as me does well only when\r\nthey’re out. If it wasn’t for the pensions that the quality gives to\r\nthe blind during the winter, they couldn’t do at all. The blind people\r\nwho have guides pay them no wages, they find them their victuals and\r\nclothes; but the guides are mostly children, and the blind are very\r\ngood to them; many that I know spoils them.”\r\n\r\nThe blind people are mostly all of a religious turn of mind. They all\r\nmake a point of attending divine service; and the majority of them\r\nare Catholics. My informant knew only five among his blind neighbours\r\nwho were Protestants--and two of these were Presbyterians, one a\r\nMethodist, and two Churchmen; and on the other hand he numbered up\r\nfourteen Catholics, all going to the same chapel, and living within a\r\nshort distance of himself. They are peculiarly distinguished by a love\r\nof music. “It’s a sure bit of bread to the most; besides, it makes\r\nthem independent, you see, and that’s a great thing to people like\r\nus.” There is not one teetotaller, I am told, among the street blind,\r\nbut they are not distinguished by a love of drink. The blind musicians\r\noften, when playing at public-houses, are treated to drink, and,\r\nindeed, when performing in the streets, are taken by drunken men to\r\nplay at taverns, and there supplied with liquor; but they do not any of\r\nthem make a habit of drinking. There is, however, one now in prison who\r\nis repeatedly intoxicated; and this, the blind say, is a great injury\r\nto them; for people who see one of them drunk in the streets, believe\r\nthat they are all alike; and there is one peculiarity among them\r\nall--being continually mistaken for one another. However different they\r\nmay be in features, still, from the circumstance of their being blind,\r\nand being mostly accompanied by a dog, or a guide, few persons can\r\ndistinguish one from another. They are mostly very jealous, they tell\r\nme, because they say every one takes advantage of their affliction,\r\neven their own children, and their own wives. “Some of the wives dress\r\nthemselves very gaily, because they know their husbands can’t see\r\ntheir fine clothes, particularly those that have got no children--then\r\nthere’s none to tell. But, pray mind I only speaking of some of\r\nthem--don’t blame the whole. People never took no money out of my dog’s\r\nbasket--two gals of the town once did try to steal a shilling out of\r\nit, that some gentleman had dropped in, but the dog barked, and they\r\ngave a scream, and run away. Many of the blind men have married blind\r\nwomen--they say that they don’t like seeing women. If seeing men find\r\nit a hard job to take care of seeing women, how are blind men to do\r\nit?” My informant knows six blind men who have married blind wives--the\r\nblind wives, I am told, stick closer to home--and do not want to go to\r\nplays, or dances, or shows, and have no love of dress--and they are\r\ngenerally more sober than those who can see. “A blind person,” says\r\none, “has no reason to be as wicked as those that can see--there’s not\r\nhalf the temptation, you know. The women do all their household duties\r\nas well as if they had their eyesight. They make puddings and pies, and\r\nboil them, or send them to the oven, as well, as quick, and as handy\r\nas a woman that can see. They sweep the floor without leaving a speck;\r\nand tidy the room, and black-lead the grate, and whiten the hearth,\r\nand dress the chimney-piece off quite handsome, I can tell you. They\r\ntake great pride in their chimney-piece--they like other people to see\r\nit--and they take great pride in having their house quite clean and\r\nneat. Where I live it’s the remark of all, that they who can’t see have\r\ntheir houses the cleanest. I don’t know of any blind person that has a\r\nlooking-glass over the mantelpiece, though. I’m sure that many would,\r\nif they had the money, just to please their friends. And, what’s more\r\nstrange, the blind wives will wash their husbands’ shirts quite clean.”\r\n“The blind are very fond of their children, you see, sir,” said one;\r\n“we owe so much to them, they’re such helps to us, even from their very\r\ninfancy. You’ll see a little thing that can hardly walk, leading her\r\nblind father about, and then, may be, our affliction makes them loves\r\nus the more. The blind people are more comfortable at home--they are\r\nmore together, and more dependent on one another, and don’t like going\r\nout into company as others do. With women a love of company is mostly\r\nof a love of seeing others, and being seen themselves, so the blind\r\nwives is happy and contented at home. No man that could see, unless\r\nhe was a profligate, would think of marrying a blind woman; and the\r\nblind women knows this, and that’s why they love their blind husbands\r\nthe more--they pity one another, and so can’t help liking each other.”\r\nNow, it’s strange, that with so many blind couples living together, no\r\none ever heard of any accident from fire with blind people--the fact\r\nis, their blindness makes them so careful, that there’s no chance of\r\nit: besides, when there’s two blind people together, they never hardly\r\nlight a candle at all, except when a stranger comes in, and then they\r\nalways ask him, before he leaves, to put the light out.\r\n\r\nThe blind people generally are persons of great feeling; they are\r\nvery kind and charitable to persons who are in any way afflicted, or\r\neven to poor persons. Many of those who live on charity themselves\r\nare, I am assured, very generous to those that want. One told me that\r\n“a beggar had come to his house, and he had made him cry with his\r\nstory; my heart” he said, “was that full I was ashamed.” They’re not\r\nparticularly proud, though they like to be well-dressed, and they say\r\nthat no one can get a wife so soon as a blind man. One assured me that\r\nhe’d go into any lodging-house in the country and get two or three if\r\nhe wanted--only they’d fight, he said. “You see in the lodging-houses\r\nthere are many woman whose husbands (but they’re not married, you know)\r\nhave told them to go on and said they would follow them, which of\r\ncourse they don’t; or there’s many in such places as wants a companion.\r\nWhen a blind man goes into one of these houses, a woman is sure to say\r\nto him, ‘Can I fetch you anything, master?’ Half an ounce of tea may\r\nbe, and when they’ve got it, of course, they’re invited to have a cup,\r\nand that does the business. She becomes the blind man’s guide after\r\nthat. The next morning, after telling one another where to meet--‘I’m\r\ngoing such a road,’ they whisper to each other,--away they starts. I’ve\r\nknown many a blind man run away with a seeing man’s wife. The women, I\r\nthink, does it for a living, and that’s all.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see the least light in the world--not the brightest sun that\r\never shone. I have pressed my eye-balls--they are quite decayed, you\r\nsee; but I have pushed them in, and they have merely hurt me, and\r\nthe water has run from them faster than ever. I have never seen any\r\ncolours when I did so.” (This question was asked to discover whether\r\nthe illusion called “peacock’s feathers” could still be produced by\r\npressure on the nerve). “I have been struck on the eye since I have\r\nbeen blind, and then I have seen a flash of fire like lightning. I know\r\nit’s been like that, because I’ve seen the lightning sometimes, when\r\nit’s been very vivid, even since I was stone blind. It was terrible\r\npain when I was struck on the eye. A man one day was carrying some\r\nchairs along the street, and struck me right in the eye-ball with the\r\nend of the leg of one of the chairs; and I fell to the ground with\r\nthe pain. I thought my heart was coming out of my mouth; then I saw\r\nthe brightest flash that ever I saw, either before or since I was\r\nblind.” (I irritated the ball of the eye with the object of discovering\r\nwhether the nerve was decayed, but found it impossible to produce any\r\nluminous impression--though I suspect this arose principally from the\r\ndifficulty of getting him to direct his eye in the proper direction).\r\n“I know the difference of colours, because I remember them; but I\r\ncan’t distinguish them by my touch, nor do I think that any blind\r\nman in the world ever could. I have heard of blind people playing at\r\ncards, but it’s impossible they can do so any other way than by having\r\nthem marked. I know many that plays cards that way.” He was given two\r\nsimilar substances, but of different colours, to feel, but could not\r\ndistinguish between them--both were the same to him, he said, “with\r\nthe exception that one felt stiffer than the other. I know hundreds of\r\npeople myself--and they know hundreds more--and none of us has ever\r\nheard of one that could tell colours by the feel. There’s blind people\r\nin the school can tell the colours of their rods; but they do so by\r\nputting their tongue to them, and so they can distinguish them that’s\r\nbeen dipped in copperas from them that hasn’t. I know blind people\r\ncan take a clock to pieces, and put it together again, as well as any\r\nperson that can see. Blind people gets angry when they hear people\r\ntalk of persons seeing with their fingers. A man has told me that a\r\nblind person in St. James’s workhouse could read the newspaper with his\r\nfingers, but that, the blind know, is quite impossible.”\r\n\r\nMany blind men can, I am told, distinguish between the several kinds\r\nof wood by touch alone. Mahogany, oak, ash, elm, deal, they say, have\r\nall a different feel. They declare it is quite ridiculous, the common\r\nreport, that blind people can discern colours by the touch. One of my\r\ninformants, who assured me that he was considered to be one of the\r\ncleverest of blind people, told me that he had made several experiments\r\non this subject, and never could distinguish the least difference\r\nbetween black or red, or white, or yellow, or blue, or, indeed, any of\r\nthe mixed colours. “My wife,” said one, “went blind so young, that she\r\ndoesn’t never remember having seen the light; and I am often sorry for\r\nher that she has no idea of what a beautiful thing light or colours\r\nis. We often talk about it together, and then she goes a little bit\r\nmelancholy, because I can’t make her understand what the daylight is\r\nlike, or the great delight that there is in seeing it. I’ve often asked\r\nwhether she knows that the daylight and the candlelight is of different\r\ncolours, and she has told me she thinks they are the same; but then\r\nshe has no notion of colours at all. Now, it’s such people as these\r\nI pities.” I told the blind man of Sanderson’s wonderful effect of\r\nimagination in conceiving that the art of seeing was similar to that of\r\na series of threads being drawn from the distant object to the eye; and\r\nhe was delighted with the explanation, saying, “he could hardly tell\r\nhow a born blind man could come at such an idea.” On talking with this\r\nman, he told me he remembered having seen a looking-glass once--his\r\nmother was standing putting her cap on before it, and he thought he\r\nnever saw anything so pretty as the reflection of the half-mourning\r\ngown she had on, and the white feathery pattern upon it (he was five\r\nyears old then). He also remembered having seen his shadow, and\r\nfollowing it across the street; these were the only two objects he can\r\ncall to mind. He told me that he knew many blind men who could not\r\ncomprehend how things could be seen, round or square, _all at once_;\r\nthey are obliged, they say, to pass their fingers all over them; and\r\nhow it is that the shape of a thing can be known in an instant, they\r\ncannot possibly imagine. I found out that this blind man fancied the\r\nlooking-glass reflected only one object at once--only the object that\r\nwas immediately in front of it; and when I told him that, looking in\r\nthe glass, I could see everything in the room, and even himself, with\r\nmy back turned towards him, he smiled with agreeable astonishment. He\r\nsaid, “You see how little I have thought about the matter.” There was\r\na blind woman of his acquaintance, he informed me, who could thread\r\nthe smallest needle with the finest hair in a minute, and never miss\r\nonce. “She’ll do it in a second. Many blind women thread their needles\r\nwith their tongues; the woman who stitches by the Polytechnic always\r\ndoes so.” My informant was very fond of music. One of the blind makes\r\nhis own teeth, he told me; his front ones have all been replaced by\r\none long bit of bone which he has fastened to the stumps of his two\r\neye teeth: he makes them out of any old bit of bone he can pick up.\r\nHe files them and drills a hole through them to fasten them into his\r\nhead, and eats his food with them. He is obliged to have teeth because\r\nhe plays the clarionet in the street. “Music,” he said, “is our only\r\nenjoyment, we all like to listen to it and learn it.” It affects them\r\ngreatly, they tell me, and if a lively tune is played, they can hardly\r\nhelp dancing. “Many a tune I’ve danced to so that I could hardly walk\r\nthe next day,” said one. Almost all of the blind men are clever at\r\nreckoning. It seems to come natural to them after the loss of their\r\nsight. By counting they say they spend many a dull hour--it appears\r\nto be all mental arithmetic with them, for they never aid their\r\ncalculations by their fingers or any signs whatever. My informant knew\r\na blind man who could reckon on what day it was new moon for a hundred\r\nyears back, or when it will be new moon a century to come--he had\r\nnever had a book read to him on the subject in his life--he was one\r\nof the blind wandering musicians. My informant told me he often sits\r\nfor hours and calculates how many quarters of ounces there are in a\r\nship-load of tea, and such like things. Many of the blind are very\r\npartial to the smell of flowers. My informant knew one blind man about\r\nthe streets who always would have some kind of smelling flowers in his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“The blind are very ingenious; oh, very!” said one to me, “they can do\r\nanything that they can feel. One blind man who kept a lodging-house\r\nat Manchester and had a wife fond of drink, made a little chest of\r\ndrawers (about two feet high), in which he used to put his money, and\r\nso cleverly did he arrange it that neither his wife nor any one else\r\ncould get at the money without breaking the drawers all to pieces. Once\r\nwhile her blind husband was on his travels, she opened every drawer by\r\nmeans of false keys, and though she took each one out, she could find\r\nno means to get at the money, which she could hear jingling inside when\r\nshe shook it. At last she got so excited over it that she sent for a\r\ncarpenter, and even he was obliged to confess that he could not get to\r\nit without taking the drawers to pieces. The same blind man had a great\r\nfancy for white mice, and made a little house for them out of pieces\r\nof wood cut into the shape of bricks: there were doors, windows, and\r\nall,” said my informant. The blind are remarkable for the quickness of\r\ntheir hearing--one man assured me he could hear the lamp-posts in the\r\nstreets, and, indeed, any _substance_ (any solid thing he said) that\r\nhe passed in the street, provided it be as high as his ear; if it were\r\nbelow that he could not _hear_ it so well.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I can hear any substance in the street as I pass it\r\nby, even the lamp-post or a dead wall--anything that’s the height of\r\nmy head, let it be ever so small, just as well, and tell what it is\r\nas well as you as can see. One night I was coming home--you’ll be\r\nsurprised to hear this--along Burlington-gardens, between twelve and\r\none o’clock, and a gentleman was following me. I knew he was not a\r\npoor man by his walk, but I didn’t consider he was watching me. I just\r\nheerd when I got between Sackville-street and Burlington-street. Oh,\r\nI knows every inch of the street, and I can go as quick as you can,\r\nand walk four mile an hour; know where I am all the while. I can tell\r\nthe difference of the streets by the sound of my ear--a wide street\r\nand a narrow street--I can’t tell a long street till I get to the\r\nbottom of it. I can tell when I come to an opening or a turning just by\r\nthe click on the ear, without either my touching with hand or stick.\r\nWell, as I was saying, this gentleman was noticing me, and just as I\r\ncome to turn up Cork-street, which, you know, is my road to go into\r\nBond-street, on my way home; just as I come into Cork-street, and was\r\ngoing to turn round the corner, the sergeant of police was coming from\r\nBond-street, at the opposite corner of Cork-street, I heerd him, and he\r\njust stopped to notice me, but didn’t know the gentleman was noticing\r\nme too. I whipped round the corner as quick as any man that had his\r\nsight, and said, ‘Good night, policeman.’ I can tell a policeman’s\r\nfoot anywhere, when he comes straight along in his regular way while\r\non his beat, and they all know it too. I can’t tell it where there’s a\r\nnoise, but in the stillness of the night nothing would beat me. I can’t\r\nhear the lamp-posts when there’s a noise. When I said, ‘Good night,\r\npoliceman,’ the gentleman whipped across to him, and says, ‘Is that man\r\nreally blind?’ and by this time I was half way up Cork-street, when the\r\ngentleman hallooed to me to stop; and he comes up, and says, says he,\r\n‘Are you really blind?’ The sergeant of police was with him, and he\r\nsays, ‘Yes, he is really blind, sir;’ and then he says, ‘How is it that\r\nyou go so cleverly along the street if you’re blind?’ Well, I didn’t\r\nwant to stop bothering with him, so I merely says, ‘I do far cleverer\r\nthings than that. I can hear the lamp-post as well as you that can see\r\nit.’ He says, ‘Yes, because you know the distance from one to another.’\r\nThe sergeant stood there all the time, and he says, ‘No, that can’t\r\nbe, for they’re not a regular distance one from another.’ Then the\r\ngentleman says, ‘Now, could you tell if I was standing in the street\r\nwhen you passed me by?’ I said, ‘Yes; but you mustn’t stand behind the\r\nlamp-post to deceive me with the sound of the substance.’ Then he went\r\naway to try me, and a fine try we had. He will laugh when he sees that\r\nthey’re all put down. When he went away I recollected that if he didn’t\r\nstand as near to the pavement as the lamp-post is, and remain still,\r\nhe’d deceive me. Oh, certainly, I couldn’t hear him if he was far off,\r\nand I shouldn’t hear him in the same way as I can hear the lamp-posts\r\nif he didn’t stand still. The policeman hallooed after him, and told\r\nhim that he mustn’t deceive me; but he wouldn’t make no answer, for\r\nfear I should catch the sound of his voice and know where he was. I had\r\nagreed to touch every substance as I went along and round the street\r\nto look for him; we always call it looking though we are blind. Well,\r\nwhen he had stood still the sergeant told me to go; he’s the sergeant\r\nof St. James’ station-house, and has been often speaking to me since\r\nabout it; and on I went at the rate of about three mile an hour, and\r\ntouched every lamp-post without feeling for them, but just struck them\r\nwith my stick as I went by, without stopping, and cried out, ‘There’s\r\na substance.’ At last I come to him. There’s a mews, you know, just by\r\nthe hotel in Cork-street, and the gentleman stood between the mews and\r\nClifford-street, in Cork-street; and when I come up to him, I stopped\r\nquite suddenly, and cried out ‘There’s a substance.’ As I was offering\r\nto touch him with my stick, he drew back very softly, just to deceive\r\nme. Then he would have another try, but I picked him out again, but\r\nthat wouldn’t satisfy him, and he would try me a third time; and then,\r\nwhen I come up to him, he kept drawing back, right into the middle of\r\nthe road. I could hear the stones scrunch under his feet; so I says,\r\n‘Oh, that’s not fair;’ and he says, ‘Well, I’m bet.’ Then he made me a\r\npresent, and said that he would like to spend an hour some night with\r\nme again. I don’t think he was a doctor, ’cause he never took no notice\r\nof my eyes, but he was a real gentleman--the sergeant said so.\r\n\r\n“When I dream, it’s just the same as I am now, I dream of hearing and\r\ntouching. The last dream that I had was about a blind man--that’s in\r\nprison just now. I went into his wife’s house, I knew it was her house\r\nby the sound of my foot in it. I can tell whether a place is clean or\r\ndirty by the sound. Then I heard her say, ‘Well, how do you get on?’\r\nand I said ‘Very well;’ and she said ‘Sit down,’ and after sitting\r\nthere a little while, I heard a voice at the door, and I said to her,\r\n‘Bless me, wouldn’t you think that was John;’ she said, ‘Yes, I would,’\r\nbut she took no farther notice, and I heard his voice repeatedly. I\r\nthought he was speaking to a child, and I got up and went to the door,\r\nand says, ‘Halloa! is this you;’ I was quite surprised and took him by\r\nthe arm (laying his hand on his own) and he was in his shirt sleeves.\r\nI knew that by the feel. Then I was kind of afeard of him, though I am\r\nnot afeard of anything. I was rather surprised that he should come out\r\nthree weeks before his time. Then I dreamt that he tried to frighten\r\nand pushed me down on the floor, that way (making the motion sideways),\r\nto make me believe he was a ghost. I felt it as plain as I should if\r\nyou were to do the same to me now. I says to him ‘Don’t be so foolish,\r\nsit down’, and I pushed him away and got up. When I got up, his wife\r\nsays to him, ‘Sit down, John, and don’t be so foolish; sit down, and\r\nbehave yourself;’ and then we set down the two of us, just on the\r\nedge of the bed (here he moved his hand along the edge of the table).\r\nI thought it was turned down. He’s a very resolute man and a wicked\r\none, this blind man is, so I would like to have been out from him,\r\nbut I was afeard to go, for he’d got a hold of me; after that I waked\r\nand I heerd no more. But it’s my real opinion that he’s dead now, it\r\nis indeed, through having such dreams of him I think so; and the same\r\nnight his wife dreamt that I was killed and all knocked into about a\r\nhundred pieces; and those two dreams convince me something’s come to\r\nhim. Oh, I do firmly believe in dreams, that I do; they’re sent for\r\npeople to foresee things, I’m certain of it, if people will only take\r\nnotice of ’em. I have been many times in prison myself, while I’ve been\r\ntravelling the country. You know in many towns they comes and takes\r\nyou up without given you never no warning if they catches you begging.\r\nI was took up once in Liverpool, once in Hull, once in Exeter, and\r\nonce in Biddeford, in Devonshire. Most of the times I had a month,\r\nand one of them only seven days. I think that’s very unjust--never to\r\nsay you mustn’t do it; but to drag you off without never no warning.\r\nEvery time before I was put in quod I had always dreamt that my father\r\nwas starving to death for want of victuals, and at last I got to know\r\nwhenever I dreamt that, I was sure of going to prison. I never dreamt\r\nabout my mother; she died, you see, when I was very young, and I never\r\nremember hearing her speak but once or twice. My father never did the\r\nthing that was right to me, and I didn’t care much about him. When I\r\nwas at home I was very fond of pigeons, and my mind went so much upon\r\nthem, that I used to dream of it the night before, always when they had\r\neggs, and when my rabbits had young ones too. I know when I wake in the\r\nmorning that I am awake by my thoughts. Sometimes I dream I’ve got a\r\nlot of money in my hand, and when I wake and put my hand to feel it,\r\nit’s gone, there’s none there, and so I know it’s been only a dream.\r\nI’m much surprised at my disappointment though.”\r\n\r\nMany of the blind are very fond of keeping birds and animals; some of\r\nthem keep pigeons in one of their rooms, others have cocks and hens,\r\nand others white mice and rabbits, and almost all have dogs, though\r\nall are not led about by them. Some blind men take delight in having\r\nnothing but bull-dogs, not to lead them, but solely for fancy. Nobody\r\nlikes a dog so much as a blind man, I am told--“they can’t--the blind\r\nman is so much beholden to his dog, he does him such favours and\r\nsarvices.” “With my dog I can go to any part of London as independent\r\nas any one who has got his sight. Yesterday afternoon when I left your\r\nhouse, sir, I was ashamed of going through the street. People was a\r\nsaying, ‘Look’ee there, that’s the man as says he’s blind.’ I was\r\ngoing so quick, it was so late you know, they couldn’t make it out,\r\nbut without my dog I must have crawled along, and always be in great\r\nfear. The name of my present dog is ‘KEEPER;’ he is a mongrel breed;\r\nI have had him nine years, and he is with me night and day, goes to\r\nchurch with me and all. If I go out without him, he misses me, and\r\nthen he scampers all through the streets where I am in the habit of\r\ngoing, crying and howling after me, just as if he was fairly out of his\r\nmind. It’s astonishing. Often, before my first blind wife died (for\r\nI’ve been married twice to blind women, and once to a seeing woman), I\r\nused to say I’d sooner lose my wife than my dog; but when I did lose\r\nher I was sorry that ever I did say so. I didn’t know what it was.\r\nI’m sorry for it yet, and ever will be sorry for it; she was a very\r\ngood woman, and had fine principles. I shall never get another that I\r\nliked so much as the first. My dog knows every word I say to him. Tell\r\nhim to turn right or left, or cross over, and whip! round he goes in\r\na moment. Where I go for my tobacco, at the shop in Piccadilly, close\r\nto the Arcade--it’s down six or seven steps, straight down--and when\r\nI tells Keeper to go to the baccy shop, off he is, and drags me down\r\nthe steps, with the people after me, thinking he’s going to break my\r\nneck down the place, and the people stands on top the steps making all\r\nkinds of remarks, while I’m below. If he was to lose me to-night or\r\nto-morrow, he’d come back here and rise the whole neighbourhood. He\r\nknows any public-house, no matter whether he was there before or not;\r\njust whisper to him, go to the public-house, and away he scampers and\r\ndrags me right into the first he comes to. Directly I whisper to him,\r\ngo to the public-house, he begins playing away with the basket he has\r\nin his mouth, throwing it up and laying it down--throwing it and laying\r\nit down for pleasure; he gets his rest there, and that’s why he’s so\r\npleased. It’s the only place I can go to in my rounds to sit down.\r\nOh, he’s a dear clever fellow. Now, only to show you how faithful he\r\nis, one night last week I was coming along Burlington-gardens, and I\r\nstopped to light my pipe as I was coming home, and I let him loose to\r\nplay a bit and get a drink; and after I had lit my pipe I walked on,\r\nfor I knew the street very well without any guide. I didn’t take notice\r\nof the dog, for I thought he was following me. I was just turning into\r\nClifford-street when I heard the cries of him in Burlington-gardens.\r\nI know his cry, let him be ever so far away; the screech that he set\r\nup was really quite dreadful; it would grieve anybody to hear him. So\r\nI puts my fingers in my mouth and gives a loud whistle; and at last\r\nhe heard me, and then up he comes tearing along and panting away as\r\nif his heart was in his mouth; and when he gets up to me he jumped up\r\nto me right upon my back, and screams like--as if really he wanted to\r\nspeak--you can’t call it panting, because it’s louder than that, and he\r\ndoes pant when he a’n’t tired at all; all I can say is, it’s for all\r\nthe world like his speaking, and I understands it as such. If I say a\r\ncross word to him after he’s lost--such as, ah, you rascal, you--he’ll\r\njust stand of one side, and give a cry just like a Christian. I’ve\r\nknown him break the windows up two story high when I’ve left him\r\nbehind, and down he would have been after me only he durstn’t jump out.\r\nI’ve had Keeper nine year. The dog I had before him was Blucher; he\r\nwas a mongrel too; he had a tail like a wolf, an ear like a fox, and\r\na face black like a monkey. I had him thirteen year. He was as clever\r\nas Keeper, but not so much loved as he is. At last he went blind; he\r\nwas about two year losing his sight. When I found his eyes was getting\r\nbad I got Keeper. The way I first noticed him going blind was when I\r\nwould come to cross a street on my way home; at nightfall the shade\r\nof the house on the opposite side, as we was crossing, would frighten\r\nhim and drive him in the middle of the road; and he wouldn’t draw to\r\nthe pavement till he found he was wrong; and then after that he began\r\nto run again the lamp-posts in the dark; when he did this he’d cry out\r\njust like a Christian. I was sorry for him, and he knowed that, for\r\nI used to fret. I was sorry for him on account of my own affliction.\r\nAt last I was obligated to take to Keeper. I got him of another blind\r\nman, but he had no larning in him when he come to me. I was a long time\r\nteaching him, for I didn’t do it all at once. I could have teached him\r\nin a week, but I used to let the old dog have a run, while I put Keeper\r\ninto the collar for a bit” (here the blind man was some time before he\r\ncould proceed for his tears), “and so he larnt all he knows, little by\r\nlittle. Now Keeper and Blucher used to agree pretty well; but I’ve got\r\nanother dog now, named Dash, and Keeper’s as jealous of him as a woman\r\nis of a man. If I say, ‘Come Keeper, come and have the collar on,’ I\r\nmay call twenty times before he’ll come; but if I say, ‘Dash, come and\r\nhave the collar on,’ Keeper’s there the first word, jumping up agin me,\r\nand doing anything but speak. At last my old Blucher went stone blind,\r\nas bad as his master; it was, poor thing; and then he used to fret so\r\nwhen I went out without him that I couldn’t bear it, and so got at\r\nlength to take him always with me, and then he used to follow the knock\r\nof my stick. He done so for about six months, and then I was one night\r\ngoing along Piccadilly and I stops speaking to a policeman, and Blucher\r\nmisses me; he couldn’t hear where I was for the noise of the carriages.\r\nHe didn’t catch the sound of my stick, and couldn’t hear my voice for\r\nthe carriages, so he went seeking me into the middle of the road, and\r\nthere a buss run over him, poor thing. I heerd him scream out and I\r\nwhistled to him, and he came howling dreadful on to the pavement again.\r\nI didn’t think he was so much hurt then, for I puts the collar on him\r\nto take him safe back, and he led me home blind as he was. The next\r\nmorning he couldn’t rise up at all, his hind parts was useless to him.\r\nI took him in my arms and found he couldn’t move. Well, he never eat\r\nnor drink nothing for a week, and got to be in such dreadful pain that\r\nI was forced to have him killed. I got a man to drown him in a bag. I\r\ncould’nt have done it myself for all the world. It would have been as\r\nbad to me as killing a Christian. I used to grieve terribly after I’d\r\nlost him. I couldn’t get him off my mind. I had had him so many years,\r\nand he had been with me night and day, my constant companion, and the\r\nmost faithful friend I ever had, except Keeper: there’s nothing in the\r\nworld can beat Keeper for faithfulness--nothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF A BLIND BOOT-LACE SELLER.\r\n\r\nThe blind boot lace-seller who gave me the following history of his\r\nlife was the original of the portrait given in No. 17. He was a tall,\r\nstrongly-built man. In face he was ghastly, his cheek bones were sharp\r\nand high, his nose flat to his face, and his eyes were so deeply sunk\r\nin that he had more the appearance of a death’s head than of a living\r\nman. His shirt was scrupulously clean. He wore a bright red cotton\r\nneckerchief and a plaid waistcoat of many colours. His dog accompanied\r\nhim and never left his master’s side one moment.\r\n\r\n“It’s very sorrowful--very sorrowful indeed to hear that,” said the\r\nboot-lace seller to me, on my reading him the account of the blind\r\nneedle-seller; “it touches me much to hear that. But you see I don’t\r\ngrieve for the loss of my sight as he do, poor man. I don’t remember\r\never seeing any object. If there was a thing with many colours in it, I\r\ncould dissarn the highest colour. I couldn’t tell one from another, but\r\nonly the highest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLIND BOOT-LACE SELLER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n“I was born in Northumberland,” he said, “about five-and-fifty years\r\nago. My father was a grocer and had 1,000_l._ worth of freehold\r\nproperty besides his business, which was very large for a small town;\r\nhis was the principal shop, and in the general line. He had a cart of\r\nhis own, in which he attended market. I was very comfortably brought\r\nup, never wanted for nothing, and had my mother lived I should have\r\nhad an independent fortune. At five years old, while mother was still\r\nalive, I caught the small pox. I had four sisters and one brother,\r\nand we all six had it at once; that was before the vaccination was\r\nproperly established. I’ve heerd said that father did not want to have\r\nus inoculated, because of the people coming backwards and forwards\r\nto the shop. I only wish vaccination had been in vogue then as it is\r\nnow, and I shouldn’t have lost my eyes. God bless the man who brought\r\nit up, I say; people doesn’t know what they’ve got to thank him for.\r\nWell, all my sisters and brothers had not a mark upon them. It laid\r\nhold of only me. They couldn’t lay a finger upon me, they was obligated\r\nto lift me up in one of my father’s shirts, by holding the corners of\r\nit like a sheet. As soon as ever the pock began to decay it took away\r\nmy eyes altogether. I didn’t lose both my eyeballs till about twenty\r\nyears after that, though my sight was gone for all but the shadow of\r\ndaylight and any high colours. At sixteen years of age my left eye\r\nbursted; I suffered terribly then--oh terribly! yes, that I did. The\r\nblack-and-white like all mixed together, the pock came right through\r\nthe star of the eye the doctor said; and when I was five-and-twenty\r\nmy other eye-ball bursted, and then my eyes was quite out of my head.\r\nTill that time I could see a little bit; I could tell the daylight,\r\nand I could see the moon, but not the shape of it. I never could see\r\na star, and do you know I grieved about the loss of that little bit\r\nof sight as much as if I was losing the whole of it. As my eye-ball\r\nsloughed day by day, I could see the light going away by little, every\r\nday till the week’s end. When I looked at the daylight just before it\r\nall went, I could see the light look as red as fire--as red as blood;\r\nand when it all left me, oh, I was dreadful sorrowful, I thought I was\r\nlost altogether. But, I shouldn’t have been so bad off, as I said,\r\nif mother had lived, but she died when I was about six year old. I\r\ndidn’t care much about her, indeed I took a dreadful dislike to her. I\r\nheerd her say one day to a person in the shop, that she would sooner\r\nsee me dead and buried than be as I was, but now I know that it was\r\nher fondness for me. Mother catched a cold, and died after six day’s\r\nillness. When she was gone, father got to neglect his business. He had\r\nno one then to attend to it, and he took and shut up the shop. He lost\r\nheart, you see. He took and turned all the tenants out of his property,\r\nand furnished all the rooms of a large house suitable for the quality\r\nthat used to come to the town to bathe. He mortgaged the place for\r\n250_l._ to buy the furniture, and that was the ruin of him. Eighteen\r\nyears afterwards the lawyers got the better of him, and all the family\r\nwas turned out of the door without a penny. My father they’d put in\r\njail before. He died a few years afterwards in the workhouse. When\r\nthe family was turned out, there was only my eldest brother away at\r\nsea, and my eldest sister in sarvice; so me and my three sisters was\r\nsent in the wide world without the means of getting a crust or a place\r\nto put our heads in. All my sisters after that got into sarvice, and\r\nI went to drive some coal carts at North Shields. The coal carts was\r\nfather’s, and they was all he had left out of his property; so I used\r\nto go to Wall’s End and fill the carts, then take them down to North\r\nShields and sell them at the people’s doors. We never used to sell\r\nless than the load. I did all this, blind as I was, without a person\r\nto guide, and continued at it night and day for about fifteen year.\r\nIt was well known to the whole country side. I was the talk for miles\r\nround. They couldn’t believe I was blind; though they see my eyes was\r\ngone, still they couldn’t hardly believe. Then, after the fifteen year,\r\nme and my father had a complete fall out. He took an advantage of my\r\nsister. He had borrowed 20_l._ of her, and when he could he wouldn’t\r\npay her. He behaved as bad as father could, and then I broke with\r\nhim.” (He then went over the whole story, and was affected, even to\r\nspeechlessness, at the remembrance of his family troubles. Into these\r\nthere is no necessity to enter here; suffice it, the blind man appears\r\nto have behaved very nobly.) “I came away and went to my brother, who\r\nwas well off at Hull; when I got there, I found he had gone to Russia\r\nand died there that very spring. While I was on my way to Hull, I used\r\nto go to sleep at the lodging-houses for travellers. I had never been\r\nin one before, and there I got to think, from what I heerd, that a\r\nroving life was a fine pleasant one. The very first lodging-house I\r\nwent into was one in Durham, and there persons as was coming the same\r\nroad persuaded me to go and beg with them, but I couldn’t cheek it; it\r\nwas too near hand at home. We came on to Darlington, that was 18 miles\r\nfurther, that day. They still kept company with me, and wanted me to\r\nbeg, but I wouldn’t; I couldn’t face it. I thought people would know\r\nme. The next day we started on our way to Northallerton, and then my\r\nfew shillings was all gone; so that night we went to seek relief, and\r\ngot a pennyworth of milk, and a penny loaf each and our bed. The parish\r\ngave us a ticket to a lodging-house. The next morning we started from\r\nNorthallerton, and then I was very hungry; all I had the day before was\r\nthe pennyworth of bread I got from the parish. Then as we got about a\r\nmile out of the town, there was a row of houses, and the Scotchman who\r\nwas with me says, ‘If ye’ll gang up wi’ me, I’ll speak for ye.’ Well,\r\nwe went up and got 3_d._, and plenty of bread and butter; almost every\r\nhouse we got something at; then I was highly delighted; thinks I, this\r\nis a business--and so I did. We shared with the other man who had come\r\non the road with us, and after that we started once more, and then I\r\nwas all eager to go on with the same business. You see I’d never had\r\nno pleasure, and it seemed to me like a new world--to be able to get\r\nvictuals without doing anything--instead of slaving as I’d been with\r\na couple of carts and horses at the coal-pits all the time. I didn’t\r\nthink the country was half so big, and you couldn’t credit the pleasure\r\nI felt in going about it. I felt as if I didn’t care for nothing; it\r\nwas so beautiful to be away there quite free, without any care in\r\nthe world, for I could see plainly I could always get the best of\r\nvictuals, and the price of my lodgings. There’s no part in all England\r\nlike Yorkshire for living. We used to go to all the farm-houses, we\r\nwouldn’t miss one if it was half a mile off the road; if the Scotchman\r\nwho was with me could only see a road he’d take me up it, and we got\r\nnice bits of pie and meat, and bread and cake, indeed as much as would\r\nserve four people, when we got to the lodging-house at night and a few\r\nshillings beside. I soon got not to care about the loss of my brother.\r\nAt last we got to make so much money that I thought it was made to\r\nchuck about the streets. We got it so easy, you see. It was only 4_s._\r\nor 5_s._, but then I was only a flatty or I could have made 14_s._\r\nor 15_s._ at least. This was in Borough-bridge, and there at a place\r\ncalled, I think, Bridely-hill, there was a lodging-house without never\r\na bed in it at all; but only straw littered on the ground, and here I\r\nfound upwards of sixty or seventy, all tramps, and living in different\r\nways, pattering, and thieving, and singing, and all sorts; and that\r\nnight I got to think it was the finest scene I had ever known. I grew\r\npleaseder, and pleaseder, with the life, and wondered how any one\r\ncould follow any other. There was no drunkenness, but it was so new\r\nand strange, and I’d never known nothing of life before, that I was\r\nbewildered, like, with over-joy at it. Then I soon got to think I’d\r\nhave the summer’s pleasure out and wouldn’t go near Hull till the back\r\nend of the year, for it was the month of May, that what I’m talking\r\nabout took place; and so things went on. I never thought of home, or\r\nsisters, or anything, indeed. I was so over-joyed that I could think\r\nof nothing else. Whenever I got to a new county it seemed like getting\r\ninto a new nation, and when I heard we were close upon a new place I\r\nused to long and long to get into it. At last I left the Scotchman\r\nand took up with an old sailor, a man-of-warsman, who was coming up\r\nto London to get his pension, and he was a regular ‘cadger’ like the\r\nother who had put me ‘fly to the dodge,’ though none of us wer’nt ‘fly’\r\nto nothing then. I can’t tell you, I wanted to, how I longed to be\r\nin town, and, as I came through the streets with him, I didn’t know\r\nwhether I carried the streets or they carried me. You see I had heard\r\npeople talk about London in North Shields, and I thought there was no\r\npoor people there at all--none but ladies and gentlemen and sailors. In\r\nLondon the sailor drew his pension, and he and me got robbed, and then\r\nthe sailor left me, and then I started off without a penny into the\r\ncountry; and at Stratford-le-Bow I began, for the first time, to say,\r\n‘Pity the poor blind.’ Up to this time I had never axed no one--never\r\nspoke, indeed--the cadgers who had been with me had done this for me,\r\nand glad to have the chance of sharing with me. A blind man can get a\r\nguide at any place, because they know he’s sure to get something.\r\nI took only 5_d._ at Stratford-le-Bow, and then started on my way to\r\nRomford; and there, in the lodging-house, I met a blind man, who took\r\nme in partnership with him, and larnt me my business complete--that\r\nhe just did, and since then I’ve been following it, and that’s about\r\ntwo or three and twenty year ago. Since I’ve been in London, and\r\nthat’s fourteen year, I’ve lived very regular, always had a place, and\r\nattended my church. If it hadn’t been for the lodging-houses I should\r\nnever, may be, have been as I am; though, I must confess, I always\r\nhad a desire to find out travelling, but couldn’t get hold of any one\r\nto put me in the way of it. I longed for a roving life and to shake a\r\nloose leg, still I couldn’t have done much else after my quarrel with\r\nmy father. My sister had offered to lend me money enough to buy a horse\r\nand cart for myself, but I didn’t like that, and thought I’d get it of\r\nmy brother at Hull; and that and the padding kens is solely the cause\r\nof my being as I am; and since I first travelled there’s more now than\r\never--double and treble as many.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LOW LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe revelations of the Blind Boot-Lace Seller concerning the low\r\nlodging-houses make me anxious to arouse the public to a full sense of\r\nthe atrocities committed and countenanced in those infamous places. It\r\nwill have been noticed that the blind man frankly tells us that he was\r\n“taught his business” as a mendicant in one of these houses of call for\r\nvagabonds of all kinds--beggars, prostitutes, cheats, and thieves. Up\r\nto the time of his starting to see his brother at Hull, he appears to\r\nhave had no notion of living but by his labour, and, more especially,\r\nno wish to make a trade of his affliction. Till then he seems to have\r\nbeen susceptible of some of the nobler impulses of humanity, and to\r\nhave left his home solely because he refused to be party to a fraud on\r\nhis own sister. Unfortunately, however, on his way to carry out his\r\ngenerous purposes, he put up for the night at the “travellers’” house\r\nin the town where he arrived, at the end of his first day’s journey;\r\nfrom the very minute that he set foot in the place he was a lost man.\r\nHere were assembled scores of the most degraded and vicious members\r\nof society, lying in ambush, as it were, like tigers in the jungle,\r\nready to spring upon and make a prey of any one who came within the\r\nprecincts of their lair. To such as these--sworn to live on the labours\r\nof others, and knowing almost to a sixpence the value of each human\r\naffliction as a means of operating upon both the heart-strings and\r\nthe purse-strings of the more benevolent of the industrious or the\r\naffluent--to such as these, I say, a blind man, unskilled in the art\r\nand system of mendicancy, was literally a God-send. A shipwreck or a\r\ncolliery explosion, as they too well knew, some of the more sceptical\r\nof the public _might_ call in question, but a real blind man, with\r\nhis eye-balls gone, was beyond all doubt; and to inspire faith, as\r\nthey were perfectly aware, was one of the most important and difficult\r\nprocesses of the beggar’s craft. Besides, of all misfortunes,\r\nblindness is one which, to those who have their sight, appears not\r\nonly the greatest of human privations, but a privation which wholly\r\nprecludes the possibility of self-help, and so gives the sufferer the\r\nstrongest claim on our charity. In such a place, therefore, as a low\r\nlodging-house, the common resort of all who are resolved not to work\r\nfor their living, it was almost impossible for a blind man to pass\r\neven an hour without every virtuous principle of his nature being\r\nundermined, and overtures of the most tempting character being made\r\nto him. To be allowed to go partners in so valuable a misfortune was\r\na privilege that many there would strive for; accordingly, as we have\r\nseen, the day after the blind man entered the low lodging-house, he\r\nwho, up to that time, had been, even in his affliction, earning his\r\nliving, was taken out by one of the “travellers,” and taught how much\r\nbetter a living--how much more of the good things of this world--he\r\ncould get by mendicancy than by industry; and from the very hour when\r\nthe blind man learnt this, the most dangerous lesson that any human\r\nbeing can possibly be taught, he became, heart and soul, an ingrained\r\nbeggar. His description of the delight he felt when he found that he\r\nhad no longer any need to work--that he could rove about the country as\r\nhe pleased--without a care, without a purpose--with a perfect sense of\r\nfreedom, and a full enjoyment of the open air in the day, and the wild\r\nlicence of the lodging-house society at night, satisfied that he could\r\nget as much food and drink, and even money as he needed, solely for\r\nthe asking for it; his description of this is a frank confession of a\r\nfew of the charms of vagabondism--charms to which the more sedate are\r\nnot only strangers, but of which they can form no adequate conception.\r\nThe pleasure of “shaking a loose leg,” as the vagrants themselves call\r\nit, is, perhaps, known only in its intensity by those wayward spirits\r\nwho object to the restraint of work or the irksomeness of any settled\r\npursuit. The perfect _thoughtlessness_ that the blind man describes\r\nas the first effect produced upon him by his vagabondism is the more\r\nremarkable, because it seems to have effaced from his mind all regard,\r\neven for the sister for whose sake he had quitted his home--though\r\nto those who have made a study of the vagrant character it is one of\r\nthose curious inconsistencies which form the principal feature in\r\nthe idiosyncrasy of the class, and which, indeed, are a necessary\r\nconsequence of the very purposelessness, or want of some permanent\r\nprinciple or feeling, which constitutes, as it were, the mainspring of\r\nvagabondism. Indeed, the blind man was a strange compound of cunning\r\nand good feeling; at one moment he was weeping over the afflictions of\r\nothers--he was deeply moved when I read to him the sufferings of the\r\nCrippled Nutmeg-Grater Seller; and yet, the next minute he was grinning\r\nbehind his hand, so that his laughter might be concealed from me, in\r\na manner that appeared almost fiendish. Still, I am convinced that\r\nat heart he was far from a bad man; there was, amid the degradation\r\nthat necessarily comes of habitual mendicancy, a fine expression of\r\nsympathy, that the better class of poor always exhibit towards the\r\npoor; nor could I help wondering when I heard _him_--the professed\r\nmendicant--tell me how he had been moved to tears by the recital of\r\nthe sufferings of another mendicant--sufferings that might have been\r\nas profitable a stock in trade to the one as his blindness was to the\r\nother; though it is by no means unusual for objects of charity to have\r\n_their_ objects of charity, and to be imposed upon by fictitious or\r\nexaggerated tales of distress, almost as often as they impose upon\r\nothers by the very same means.\r\n\r\nI now invite the reader’s attention to the narratives given below as to\r\nthe character of the low lodging-houses. The individuals furnishing me\r\nwith those statements, it should be observed, were not “picked” people,\r\nbut taken promiscuously from a number belonging to the same class. I\r\nshall reserve what else I may have to remark on the subject till the\r\nconclusion of those statements.\r\n\r\nPrisons, tread-mills, penal settlements, gallows, I said, eighteen\r\nmonths ago, in the ‘Morning Chronicle,’ are all vain and impotent as\r\npunishments--and Ragged Schools and City missions are of no avail\r\nas preventives of crime--so long as the wretched dens of infamy,\r\nbrutality, and vice, termed “padding-kens” continue their daily and\r\nnightly work of demoralization. If we would check the further spread of\r\nour criminals--and within the last four years they have increased from\r\n24,000 to 30,000--we must apply ourselves to the better regulation and\r\nconduct of these places. At present they are not only the preparatory\r\nschools, but the finishing academies for every kind of profligacy and\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n “The system of lodging-houses for travellers, otherwise trampers,”\r\n says the Constabulary Commissioners’ Report, “requires to be\r\n altogether revised; at present they are in the practice of lodging all\r\n the worst characters unquestioned, and are subject to no other control\r\n than an occasional visit of inspection from the parish officers,\r\n accompanied by the constables, whose power of interference--if they\r\n have a legal right of entry--does not extend to some of the most\r\n objectionable points connected with those houses, as they can merely\r\n take into custody such persons as they find in commission of some\r\n offence. The state in which those houses are found on the occasion of\r\n such visit, proves how much they require interference. The houses are\r\n small, and yet as many as thirty travellers, or even thirty-five, have\r\n been found in one house; fifteen have been found sleeping in one room,\r\n three or four in a bed--men, women, and children, promiscuously: beds\r\n have been found occupied in a cellar. It is not necessary to urge the\r\n many opportunities of preparing for crime which such a state of things\r\n presents, or the actual evils arising from such a mode of harbouring\r\n crowds of low and vicious persons.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the Constabulary Commissioners, there were\r\nin 1839--\r\n\r\n                                                    Total No.\r\n                           Mendicants’                  of\r\n                         Lodging-houses.   Lodgers.  Inmates.\r\n\r\n  In London                   221 average     11  or   2,431\r\n  In Liverpool                176              6       1,056\r\n  Bristol                      69              7         483\r\n  Bath                         14              9         126\r\n  Kingston-on-Hull             11              3          33\r\n  Newcastle-on-Tyne            78              3         234\r\n  Chester (see Report, p. 35) 150              3         450\r\n                              ---                      -----\r\n                              619                      4,813\r\n\r\nMoreover, the same Report tells us, at p. 32, that there is a low\r\nlodging-house for tramps in every village. By the Post-office Directory\r\nthere are 3823 postal towns in England and Wales; and assuming that\r\nin each of these towns there are two “travellers’” houses, and that\r\neach of these, upon an average, harbours every night ten tramps (in\r\na list given at p. 311, there were in 83 towns no less than 678 low\r\nlodging-houses, receiving 10,860 lodgers every night; this gives, on\r\nan average, 8 such houses to each town, and 16 lodgers to each such\r\nhouse), we have thus 76,460 for the total number of the inmates of such\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nTo show the actual state of these lodging-houses from the testimony of\r\none who had been long resident in them, I give the following statement.\r\nIt was made to me by a man of superior education and intelligence (as\r\nthe tone of his narrative fully shows), whom circumstances, which do\r\nnot affect the object of my present letter, and therefore need not\r\nbe detailed, had reduced from affluence to beggary, so that he was\r\ncompelled to be a constant resident in those places. All the other\r\nstatements that I obtained on the subject--and they were numerous--were\r\ncorroborative of his account to the very letter:--\r\n\r\n“I have been familiar, unfortunately for me, with low lodging-houses,\r\nboth in town and country, for more than ten years. I consider that,\r\nas to the conduct of those places, it is worse in London than in the\r\ncountry--while in the country the character of the keeper is worse than\r\nin London, although but a small difference can be noted. The worst\r\nI am acquainted with, though I haven’t been in it lately, is in the\r\nneighbourhood of Drury-lane--this is the worst both for filth and for\r\nthe character of the lodgers. In the room where I slept, which was\r\nlike a barn in size, the tiles were off the roof, and as there was no\r\nceiling, I could see the blue sky from where I lay. That may be altered\r\nnow. Here I slept in what was called the single men’s room, and it was\r\nconfined to men. In another part of the house was a room for married\r\ncouples, as it was called, but of such apartments I can tell you more\r\nconcerning other houses. For the bed with the view of the blue sky I\r\npaid 3_d._ If it rained there was no shelter. I have slept in a room\r\nin Brick-lane, Whitechapel, in which were fourteen beds. In the next\r\nbed to me, on the one side, was a man, his wife, and three children,\r\nand a man and his wife on the other. They were Irish people, and I\r\nbelieve the women were the men’s wives--as the Irish women generally\r\nare. Of all the women that resort to these places the Irish are far\r\nthe best for chastity. All the beds were occupied, single men being\r\nmixed with the married couples. The question is never asked, when a\r\nman and woman go to a lodging-house, if they are man and wife. All\r\nmust pay before they go to bed, or be turned into the street. These\r\nbeds were made--as all the low lodging-house beds are--of the worst\r\ncotton flocks stuffed in coarse, strong canvas. There is a pair of\r\nsheets, a blanket, and a rug. I have known the bedding to be unchanged\r\nfor three months; but that is not general. The beds are an average\r\nsize. Dirt is the rule with them, and cleanliness the exception. They\r\nare all infested with vermin. I never met with an exception. No one is\r\nrequired to wash before going to bed in any of these places (except at\r\na very few, where a very dirty fellow would not be admitted), unless he\r\nhas been walking on a wet day without shoes or stockings, and then he\r\nmust bathe his feet. The people who slept in the room I am describing\r\nwere chiefly young men, almost all accompanied by young females. I\r\nhave seen girls of fifteen sleep with ‘their chaps’--in some places\r\nwith youths of from sixteen to twenty. There is no objection to any\r\nboy and girl occupying a bed, even though the keeper knows they were\r\npreviously strangers to each other. The accommodation for purposes of\r\ndecency is very bad in some places. A pail in the middle of a room, to\r\nwhich both sexes may resort, is a frequent arrangement. No delicacy or\r\ndecency is ever observed. The women are, I think, worse than the men.\r\nIf any one, possessing a sense of shame, says a word of rebuke, he is\r\nat once assailed, by the women in particular, with the coarsest words\r\nin the language. The Irish women are as bad as the others with respect\r\nto language, but I have known them keep themselves covered in bed when\r\nthe other women were outraging modesty or decency. The Irish will\r\nsleep anywhere to save a halfpenny a night, if they have ever so much\r\nmoney.” [Here he stated certain gross acts common to lodging-houses,\r\nwhich cannot be detailed in print.] “It is not uncommon for a boy or\r\nman to take a girl out of the streets to these apartments. Some are\r\nthe same as common brothels, women being taken in at all hours of the\r\nday or night. In most, however, they must stay all night as a married\r\ncouple. In dressing or undressing there is no regard to decency, while\r\ndisgusting blackguardism is often carried on in the conversation of\r\nthe inmates. I have known decent people, those that are driven to\r\nsuch places from destitution, perhaps for the first time, shocked\r\nand disgusted at what they saw. I have seen a decent married pair so\r\nshocked and disgusted that they have insisted on leaving the place,\r\nand have left it. A great number of the lodging-houses are large old\r\nbuildings, which were constructed for other purposes; these houses\r\nare not so ill-ventilated, but even there, where so many sleep in one\r\nroom, the air is hot and foul. In smaller rooms, say twelve feet by\r\nnine, I have seen four beds placed for single men, with no ventilation\r\nwhatsoever, so that no one could remain inside in warmish weather,\r\nwithout every door and window open; another room in the same house, a\r\nlittle larger, had four double beds, with as many men and women, and\r\nperhaps with children. The Board of Health last autumn compelled the\r\nkeepers of these places to whitewash the walls and ceilings, and use\r\nlimewash in other places; before that, the walls and ceilings looked as\r\nif they had been blackwashed, but still you could see the bugs creeping\r\nalong those black walls, which were not black enough to hide that. In\r\nsome houses in the summer you can hardly place your finger on a part of\r\nthe wall free from bugs. I have scraped them off by handfulls.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be worse to the health than these places, without\r\nventilation, cleanliness, or decency, and with forty people’s breaths\r\nperhaps mingling together in one foul choking steam of stench. [The\r\nman’s own words.] They are the ready resort of thieves and all bad\r\ncharacters, and the keepers will hide them if they can from the police,\r\nor facilitate any criminal’s escape. I never knew the keepers give any\r\noffender up, even when rewards were offered. If they did, they might\r\nshut up shop. These houses are but receptacles, with a few exceptions,\r\nfor beggars, thieves, and prostitutes, and those _in training_ for\r\nthieves and prostitutes--the exceptions are those who _must_ lodge at\r\nthe lowest possible cost. I consider them in every respect of the worst\r\npossible character, and think that immediate means should be adopted to\r\nimprove them. Fights, and fierce fights too, are frequent in them, and\r\nI have often been afraid murder would be done. They are money-making\r\nplaces, very. One person will own several--as many as a dozen. In each\r\nhouse he has one or more ‘deputies,’ chiefly men. Some of these keepers\r\nare called respectable men; some live out in the country, leaving\r\nall to deputies. They are quite a separate class from the keepers of\r\nregular brothels. In one house that I know they can accommodate eighty\r\nsingle men; and when single men only are admitted, what is decent, or\r\nrather what is considered decent in such places, is less unfrequent.\r\nEach man in such houses pays 4_d._ a night, a bed to each man or boy;\r\nthat is 26_s._ 8_d._ nightly, or 486_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ a year, provided\r\nthe beds be full every night--and they are full six nights out of\r\nseven. Besides that, some of the beds supply double turns; for many\r\nget up at two to go to Covent-garden or some other market, and their\r\nbeds are then let a second time to other men; so that more than eighty\r\nare frequently accommodated, and I suppose 500_l._ is the nearest sum\r\nto be taken for an accurate return. The rent is very trifling; the\r\nchief expense to be deducted from the profits of the house in question\r\nis the payment of three and sometimes four deputies, receiving from\r\n7_s._ to 12_s._ a week each--say an average of from 30_s._ to 40_s._ a\r\nweek--as three or four are employed. Fire (coke being only used) and\r\ngas are the other expenses. The washing is a mere trifle. Then there\r\nare the parochial and the water-rates. The rent is always low, as the\r\nhouses are useable for nothing but such lodgings. The profits of the\r\none house I have described cannot be less than 300_l._ a year, and the\r\nothers are in proportion. Now, the owner of this house has, I believe,\r\n10 more such houses, which, letting only threepenny beds (some are\r\nlower than that), may realise a profit of about 200_l._ a year each.\r\nThese altogether yield a clear profit of 2300_l._ for the eleven of\r\nthem; but on how much vice and disease that 2300_l._ has been raised\r\nis a question beyond a schoolmaster. The missionaries visit these\r\nlodging-houses, but, judging from what I have heard said by the inmates\r\nin all of them, when the missionaries have left, scarcely any good\r\neffect has resulted from the visits. _I never saw a clergyman of any\r\ndenomination in any one of these places, either in town or country._ In\r\nLondon the master or deputy of the low lodging-house does not generally\r\nmeddle with the disposal of stolen property, as in the country. This\r\nis talked about, alike in the town and country houses, very openly and\r\nfreely before persons known only to be beggars, and never stealing:\r\nit is sufficient that they are known as tramps. In London the keepers\r\nmust all know that stolen property is nightly brought into the house,\r\nand they wink at its disposal, but they won’t mix themselves up with\r\ndisposing of it. If it be provisions that have been stolen, they are\r\nreadily disposed of to the other inmates, and the owner or deputy of\r\nthe house may know nothing about it, and certainly would not care to\r\ninterfere if he did. I never heard robberies planned there, but there\r\nare generally strangers present, and this may deter. I believe more\r\nrobberies are planned in low coffee-shops than in lodging-houses. The\r\ninfluence of the lodging-house society on boys who have run away from\r\ntheir parents, and have got thither, either separately or in company\r\nwith lads who have joined them in the streets, is this:--Boys there,\r\nafter paying their lodgings, may exercise the same freedom from every\r\nrestraint as they see the persons of maturer years enjoy. This is often\r\npleasant to a boy, especially if he has been severely treated by his\r\nparents or master; he apes, and often outdoes, all the men’s ways, both\r\nin swearing and lewd talk, and so he gets a relish for that sort of\r\nlife. After he has resorted to such places--the sharper boys for three,\r\nand the duller for six months--they are adepts at any thieving or vice.\r\nDrunkenness, and even moderate drinking, is very rare among them. I\r\nseldom or never see the boys drink--indeed, thieves of all ages are\r\ngenerally sober men. Once get to like a lodging-house life, and a boy\r\ncan hardly be got out of it. I said the other day to a youth, ‘I wish I\r\ncould get out of these haunts and never see a lodging-house again;’ and\r\nhe replied, ‘If I had ever so much money I would never live anywhere\r\nelse.’ I have seen the boys in a lodging-house sit together telling\r\nstories, but paid no attention to them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A YOUNG PICKPOCKET.\r\n\r\nTo show the class of characters usually frequenting these\r\nlodging-houses, I will now give the statement of a boy--a young\r\npickpocket--without shoes or stockings. He wore a ragged, dirty,\r\nand very thin great coat, of some dark jean or linen, under which\r\nwas another thin coat, so arranged that what appeared rents--and,\r\nindeed, were rents, but designedly made--in the outer garment, were\r\nslits through which the hand readily reached the pockets of the inner\r\ngarment, and could there deposit any booty. He was a slim, agile lad,\r\nwith a sharp but not vulgar expression, and small features. His hands\r\nwere of singular delicacy and beauty. His fingers were very long, and\r\nno lady’s could have been more taper. A burglar told me that with such\r\na hand he ought to have made his fortune. He was worth 20_l._ a week,\r\nhe said, as a “_wire_,” that is, a picker of ladies’ pockets. When\r\nengaged “for a turn,” as he told me he once was by an old pickpocket,\r\nthe man looked minutely at his fingers, and approved of them highly.\r\nHis hands, the boy said, were hardly serviceable to him when very cold.\r\nHis feet were formed in the same symmetrical and beautiful mould as\r\nhis hands. “I am 15,” he said. “My father was a potter, and I can’t\r\nrecollect my mother” (many of the thieves are orphans or motherless).\r\n“My father has been dead about five years. I was then working at the\r\npottery in High-street, Lambeth, earning about 4_s._ a week; in good\r\nweeks, 4_s._ 6_d._ I was in work eight months after my father died;\r\nbut one day I broke three bottles by accident, and the foreman said ‘I\r\nshan’t want you any more;’ and I took that as meant for a discharge;\r\nbut I found afterwards that he did’nt so mean it. I had 2_s._ and a\r\nsuit of clothes then, and tried for work at all the potteries; but\r\nI couldn’t get any. It was about the time Smithfield fair was on. I\r\nwent, but it was a very poor concern. I fell asleep in a pen in the\r\nafternoon, and had my shoes stolen off my feet. When I woke up, I\r\nbegan crying. A fellow named Gyp then came along (I knew his name\r\nafterwards), and he said, ‘What are you crying for?’ and I told him,\r\nand he said, ‘Pull off your stockings, and come with me, and I’ll show\r\nyou where to sleep.’ So I did, and he took me to St. Olave’s workhouse,\r\nhaving first sold my stockings. I had never stolen anything until\r\nthen. There I slept in the casual ward, and Gyp slept there too. In\r\nthe morning we started together for Smithfield, where he said he had\r\na job to sweep the pens, but he couldn’t sweep them without pulling\r\noff his coat, and it would look so queer if he hadn’t a shirt--and\r\nhe hadn’t one. He promised to teach me how to make a living in the\r\ncountry if I would lend him mine, and I was persuaded--for I was an\r\ninnocent lad then--and went up a gateway and stripped off my shirt\r\nand gave it to him, and soon after he went into a public-house to get\r\nhalf a pint of beer; he went in at one door and out at another, and I\r\ndidn’t see him for six months afterwards. That afternoon I went into\r\nBillingsgate market and met some boys, and one said, ‘Mate, how long\r\nhave you been knocking about; where did you doss?’ I didn’t know what\r\nthey meant, and when they’d told me they meant where did I sleep? I\r\ntold them how I’d been served. And they said, ‘Oh! you must expect\r\nthat, until you learn something,’ and they laughed. They all know’d\r\nGyp; he was like the head of a Billingsgate gang once. I became a pal\r\nwith these boys at Billingsgate, and we went about stealing fish and\r\nmeat. Some boys have made 2_s._ in a morning, when fish is dear--those\r\nthat had pluck and luck; they sold it at half-price. Billingsgate\r\nmarket is a good place to sell it; plenty of costermongers are there\r\nwho will buy it, rather than of the salesmen. I soon grew as bad as\r\nthe rest at this work. At first I sold it to other boys, who would get\r\n3_d._ for what they bought at 1_d._ Now they can’t do me. If I can\r\nget a thing cheap where I lodge, and have the money, and can sell\r\nit dear, that’s the chance. I carried on this fish rig for about two\r\nyears, and went begging a little, too. I used to try a little thieving\r\nsometimes in Petticoat-lane. They say the ‘fliest’ is easy to take\r\nin sometimes--that’s the artfullest; but I could do no good there.\r\nAt these two years’ end, I was often as happy as could be; that is,\r\nwhen I had made money. Then I met B----, whom I had often heard of as\r\nan uncommon clever pickpocket; he could do it about as well as I can\r\nnow, so as people won’t feel it. Three of his mates were transported\r\nfor stealing silver plate. He and I became pals, and started for the\r\ncountry with 1_d._ We went through Foot’s Cray, and passed a farm\r\nwhere a man’s buried at the top of a house; there’s something about\r\nmoney while a man’s above ground; I don’t understand it, but it’s\r\nsomething like that. A baker, about thirty miles from London, offended\r\nus about some bread; and B---- said ‘I’ll serve him out.’ We watched\r\nhim out, and B---- tried at his pocket, saying, ‘I’ll show you how to\r\ndo a handkerchief;’ but the baker looked round, and B---- stopped; and\r\njust after that I flared it (whisked the handkerchief out); and that’s\r\nthe first I did. It brought 1_s._ 3_d._ We travelled across country,\r\nand got to Maidstone, and did two handkerchiefs. One I wore round my\r\nneck, and the other the lodging-housekeeper pawned for us for 1_s._\r\n6_d._ In Maidstone, next morning, I was nailed, and had three months\r\nof it. I didn’t mind it so much then, but Maidstone’s far worse now,\r\nI’ve heard. I have been in prison three times in Brixton, three times\r\nin the Old Horse (Bridewell), three times in the Compter, once in the\r\nSteel, and once in Maidstone--thirteen times in all, including twice I\r\nwas remanded, and got off; but I don’t reckon that prison. Every time\r\nI came out harder than I went in. I’ve had four floggings; it was bad\r\nenough--a flogging was--while it lasted; but when I got out I soon\r\nforgot it. At a week’s end I never thought again about it. If I had\r\nbeen better treated I should have been a better lad. I could leave off\r\nthieving now as if I had never thieved, if I could live without.” [I\r\nam inclined to doubt this part of the statement.] “I have carried on\r\nthis sort of life until now. I didn’t often make a very good thing of\r\nit. I saw Manning and his wife hung. Mrs. Manning was dressed beautiful\r\nwhen she came up. She screeched when Jack Ketch pulled the bolt away.\r\nShe was harder than Manning, they all said; without her there would\r\nhave been no murder. It was a great deal talked about, and Manning was\r\npitied. It was a punishment to her to come on the scaffold and see\r\nManning with the rope about his neck, if people takes it in the right\r\nlight. I did 4_s._ 6_d._ at the hanging--two handkerchiefs, and a purse\r\nwith 2_s._ in it--the best purse I ever had; but I’ve only done three\r\nor four purses. The reason is, because I’ve never been well dressed.\r\nIf I went near a lady, she would say, ‘Tush, tush, you ragged fellow!’\r\nand would shrink away. But I would rather rob the rich than the poor;\r\nthey miss it less. But 1_s._ honest goes further than 5_s._ stolen.\r\nSome call that only a saying, but it’s true. All the money I got\r\nsoon went--most of it a-gambling. Picking pockets, when any one comes\r\nto think on it, is the daringest thing that a boy can do. It didn’t\r\nin the least frighten me to see Manning and Mrs. Manning hanged. I\r\nnever thought I should come to the gallows, and I never shall--I’m not\r\nhigh-tempered enough for that. The only thing that frightens me when\r\nI’m in prison is sleeping in a cell by myself--you do in the Old Horse\r\nand the Steel--because I think things may appear. You can’t imagine\r\nhow one dreams when in trouble. I’ve often started up in a fright\r\nfrom a dream. I don’t know what might appear. I’ve heard people talk\r\nabout ghosts and that. Once, in the County, a tin had been left under\r\na tap that went drip--drip--drip. And all in the ward were shocking\r\nfrightened; and weren’t we glad when we found out what it was! Boys\r\ntell stories about haunted castles, and cats that are devils; and that\r\nfrightens one. At the fire in Monument-yard I did 5_s._ 7_d._--3_s._\r\nin silver and 2_s._ 3_d._ in handkerchiefs, and 4_d._ for three pairs\r\nof gloves. I sell my handkerchiefs in the Lane (Petticoat-lane). I\r\ncarry on this trade still. Most times I’ve got in prison is when I’ve\r\nbeen desperate from hunger, and have said to B----, ‘Now I’ll have\r\nmoney, nailed or not nailed.’ I can pick a woman’s pocket as easy as a\r\nman’s, though you wouldn’t think it. If one’s in prison for begging,\r\none’s laughed at. The others say, ‘Begging! Oh, you cadger!’ So a boy\r\nis partly forced to steal for his character. I’ve lived a good deal in\r\nlodging-houses, and know the ways of them. They are very bad places for\r\na boy to be in. Where I am now, when the place is full, there’s upwards\r\nof 100 can be accommodated. I won’t be there long. I’ll do something\r\nto get out of it. There’s people there will rob their own brother.\r\nThere’s people there talk backward--for one they say _eno_, for two\r\n_owt_, for three _eerht_, for four _ruof_, for five _evif_, for six\r\n_exis_. I don’t know any higher. I can neither read nor write. In this\r\nlodging-house there are no women. They talk there chiefly about what\r\nthey’ve done, or are going to do, or have set their minds upon, just\r\nas you and any other gentlemen might do. I have been in lodging-houses\r\nin Mint-street and Kent-street, where men and women and children all\r\nslept in one room. I think the men and women who slept together were\r\ngenerally married, or lived together; but it’s not right for a big boy\r\nto sleep in the same room. Young men have had beds to themselves, and\r\nso have young women there; but there’s a deputy comes into the room,\r\nevery now and then, to see there’s nothing wrong. There’s little said\r\nin these places, the people are generally so tired. Where I am there’s\r\nhorrid language--swearing, and everything that’s bad. They are to be\r\npitied, because there’s not work for honest people, let alone thieves.\r\nIn the lodging-houses the air is very bad, enough to stifle one in\r\nbed--so many breaths together. Without such places my trade couldn’t\r\nbe carried on; I couldn’t live. Some though would find another way\r\nout. Three or four would take a room among them. Anybody’s money’s\r\ngood--you can always get a room. I would be glad to leave this life,\r\nand work at a pottery. As to sea, a bad captain would make me run\r\naway--sure. He can do what he likes with you when you’re out at sea. I\r\ndon’t get more than 2_s._ a week, one week with the other, by thieving;\r\nsome days you do nothing until hunger makes your spirits rise. I\r\ncan’t thieve on a full belly. I live on 2_s._ a week from thieving,\r\nbecause I understand fiddling--that means, buying a thing for a mere\r\ntrifle, and selling it for double, or for more, if you’re not taken\r\nin yourself. I’ve been put up to a few tricks in lodging-houses, and\r\nnow I can put others up to it. Everybody must look after themselves,\r\nand I can’t say I was very sorry when I stole that 2_s._ from a poor\r\nwoman, but I’d rather have had 1_s._ 6_d._ from a rich one. I never\r\ndrink--eating’s my part. I spend chief part of my money in pudding. I\r\ndon’t like living in lodging-houses, but I must like it as I’m placed\r\nnow--that sort of living, and those lodging-houses, or starving. They\r\nbring tracts to the lodging-houses--pipes are lighted with them; tracts\r\nwon’t fill your belly. Tracts is no good, except to a person that has\r\na home; at the lodging-houses they’re laughed at. They seldom are\r\nmentioned. I’ve heard some of them read by missionaries, but can’t\r\ncatch anything from them. If it had been anything bad, I should have\r\ncaught it readily. If an innocent boy gets into a lodging-house, he’ll\r\nnot be innocent long--he can’t. I know three boys who have run away,\r\nand are in the lodging-houses still, but I hope their father has caught\r\nthem. Last night a little boy came to the lodging-house where I was.\r\nWe all thought he had run away, by the way he spoke. He stayed all\r\nnight, but was found out in two or three falsehoods. I wanted to get\r\nhim back home, or he’ll be as bad as I am in time, though he’s nothing\r\nto me; but I couldn’t find him this morning; but I’ll get him home yet,\r\nperhaps. The Jews in Petticoat-lane are terrible rogues. They’ll buy\r\nanything of you--they’ll buy what you’ve stolen from their next-door\r\nneighbours--that they would, if they knew it. But they’ll give you\r\nvery little for it, and they threaten to give you up if you won’t take\r\na quarter of the value of it. ‘Oh! I shee you do it,’ they say, ‘and\r\nI like to shee him robbed, but you musht take vot I give.’ I wouldn’t\r\nmind what harm came to those Petticoat-laners. Many of them are worth\r\nthousands, though you wouldn’t think it.” After this I asked him what\r\nhe, as a sharp lad, thought was the cause of so many boys becoming\r\nvagrant pickpockets? He answered, “Why, sir, if boys runs away, and\r\nhas to shelter in low lodging-houses--and many runs away from cruel\r\ntreatment at home--they meet there with boys such as me, or as bad,\r\nand the devil soon lays his hand on them. If there wasn’t so many\r\nlodging-houses there wouldn’t be so many bad boys--there couldn’t.\r\nLately a boy came down to Billingsgate, and said he wouldn’t stay at\r\nhome to be knocked about any longer. He said it to some boys like me;\r\nand he was asked if he could get anything from his mother, and he said\r\n‘yes, he could.’ So he went back, and brought a brooch and some other\r\nthings with him to a place fixed on, and then he and some of the boys\r\nset off for the country; and that’s the way boys is trapped. I think\r\nthe fathers of such boys either ill-treat them, or neglect them; and\r\nso they run away. My father used to beat me shocking; so I hated home.\r\nI stood hard licking well, and was called ‘the plucked one.’” This boy\r\nfirst stole flowers, currants, and gooseberries out of the clergyman’s\r\ngarden, more by way of bravado, and to ensure the approbation of his\r\ncomrades, than for anything else. He answered readily to my inquiry,\r\nas to what he thought would become of him?--“Transportation. If a boy\r\nhas great luck he may carry on for eight years. Three or four years\r\nis the common run, but transportation is what he’s sure to come to in\r\nthe end.” This lad picked my pocket at my request, and so dexterously\r\ndid he do his “work,” that though I was alive to what he was trying to\r\ndo, it was impossible for me to detect the least movement of my coat.\r\nTo see him pick the pockets, as he did, of some of the gentlemen who\r\nwere present on the occasion, was a curious sight. He crept behind much\r\nlike a cat with his claws out, and while in the act held his breath\r\nwith suspense; but immediately the handkerchief was safe in his hand,\r\nthe change in the expression of his countenance was most marked. He\r\nthen seemed almost to be convulsed with delight at the success of his\r\nperilous adventure, and, turning his back, held up the handkerchief to\r\ndiscover the value of his prize, with intense glee evident in every\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A PROSTITUTE.\r\n\r\nThe narrative which follows--that of a prostitute, sleeping in the\r\nlow-lodging houses, where boys and girls are all huddled promiscuously\r\ntogether, discloses a system of depravity, atrocity, and enormity,\r\nwhich certainly cannot be paralleled in any nation, however barbarous,\r\nnor in any age, however “dark.” The facts detailed, it will be seen,\r\nare gross enough to make us all blush for the land in which such scenes\r\ncan be daily perpetrated. The circumstances, which it is impossible to\r\npublish, are of the most loathsome and revolting nature.\r\n\r\nA good-looking girl of sixteen gave me the following awful statement:--\r\n\r\n“I am an orphan. When I was ten I was sent to service as maid of\r\nall-work, in a small tradesman’s family. It was a hard place, and my\r\nmistress used me very cruelly, beating me often. When I had been in\r\nplace three weeks, my mother died; my father having died twelve years\r\nbefore. I stood my mistress’s ill-treatment for about six months. She\r\nbeat me with sticks as well as with her hands. I was black and blue,\r\nand at last I ran away. I got to Mrs. ----, a low lodging-house. I\r\ndidn’t know before that there was such a place. I heard of it from\r\nsome girls at the Glasshouse (baths and washhouses), where I went for\r\nshelter. I went with them to have a halfpenny worth of coffee, and they\r\ntook me to the lodging-house. I then had three shillings, and stayed\r\nabout a month, and did nothing wrong, living on the three shillings\r\nand what I pawned my clothes for, as I got some pretty good things away\r\nwith me. In the lodging-house I saw nothing but what was bad, and heard\r\nnothing but what was bad. I was laughed at, and was told to swear.\r\nThey said, ‘Look at her for a d---- modest fool’--sometimes worse\r\nthan that, until by degrees I got to be as bad as they were. During\r\nthis time I used to see boys and girls from ten and twelve years old\r\nsleeping together, but understood nothing wrong. I had never heard of\r\nsuch places before I ran away. I can neither read nor write. My mother\r\nwas a good woman, and I wish I’d had her to run away to. I saw things\r\nbetween almost children that I can’t describe to you--very often I saw\r\nthem, and that shocked me. At the month’s end, when I was beat out, I\r\nmet with a young man of fifteen--I myself was going on to twelve years\r\nold--and he persuaded me to take up with him. I stayed with him three\r\nmonths in the same lodging-house, living with him as his wife, though\r\nwe were mere children, and being true to him. At the three months’ end\r\nhe was taken up for picking pockets, and got six months. I was sorry,\r\nfor he was kind to me; though I was made ill through him; so I broke\r\nsome windows in St. Paul’s-churchyard to get into prison to get cured.\r\nI had a month in the Compter, and came out well. I was scolded very\r\nmuch in the Compter, on account of the state I was in, being so young.\r\nI had 2_s._ 6_d._ given to me when I came out, and was forced to go\r\ninto the streets for a living. I continued walking the streets for\r\nthree years, sometimes making a good deal of money, sometimes none,\r\nfeasting one day and starving the next. The bigger girls could persuade\r\nme to do anything they liked with my money. I was never happy all the\r\ntime, but I could get no character and could not get out of the life.\r\nI lodged all this time at a lodging-house in Kent-street. They were\r\nall thieves and bad girls. I have known between three and four dozen\r\nboys and girls sleep in one room. The beds were horrid filthy and\r\nfull of vermin. There was very wicked carryings on. The boys, if any\r\ndifference, was the worst. We lay packed on a full night, a dozen boys\r\nand girls squeedged into one bed. That was very often the case--some\r\nat the foot and some at the top--boys and girls all mixed. I can’t go\r\ninto all the particulars, but whatever could take place in words or\r\nacts between boys and girls did take place, and in the midst of the\r\nothers. I am sorry to say I took part in these bad ways myself, but I\r\nwasn’t so bad as some of the others. There was only a candle burning\r\nall night, but in summer it was light great part of the night. Some\r\nboys and girls slept without any clothes, and would dance about the\r\nroom that way. I have seen them, and, wicked as I was, felt ashamed.\r\nI have seen two dozen capering about the room that way; some mere\r\nchildren, the boys generally the youngest. * * * * There were no men or\r\nwomen present. There were often fights. The deputy never interfered.\r\nThis is carried on just the same as ever to this day, and is the same\r\nevery night. I have heard young girls shout out to one another how\r\noften they had been obliged to go to the hospital, or the infirmary,\r\nor the workhouse. There was a great deal of boasting about what the\r\nboys and girls had stolen during the day. I have known boys and girls\r\nchange their ‘partners,’ just for a night. At three years’ end I stole\r\na piece of beef from a butcher. I did it to get into prison. I was sick\r\nof the life I was leading, and didn’t know how to get out of it. I had\r\na month for stealing. When I got out I passed two days and a night in\r\nthe streets doing nothing wrong, and then went and threatened to break\r\nMessrs. ------ windows again. I did that to get into prison again;\r\nfor when I lay quiet of a night in prison I thought things over, and\r\nconsidered what a shocking life I was leading, and how my health might\r\nbe ruined completely, and I thought I would stick to prison rather\r\nthan go back to such a life. I got six months for threatening. When I\r\ngot out I broke a lamp next morning for the same purpose, and had a\r\nfortnight. That was the last time I was in prison. I have since been\r\nleading the same life as I told you of for the three years, and lodging\r\nat the same houses, and seeing the same goings on. I hate such a life\r\nnow more than ever. I am willing to do any work that I can in washing\r\nand cleaning. I can do a little at my needle. I could do hard work,\r\nfor I have good health. I used to wash and clean in prison, and always\r\nbehaved myself there. At the house where I am it is 3_d._ a night; but\r\nat Mrs. ----’s it is 1_d._ and 2_d._ a night, and just the same goings\r\non. Many a girl--nearly all of them--goes out into the streets from\r\nthis penny and twopenny house, to get money for their favourite boys by\r\nprostitution. If the girl cannot get money she must steal something,\r\nor will be beaten by her ‘chap’ when she comes home. I have seen them\r\nbeaten, often kicked and beaten until they were blind from bloodshot,\r\nand their teeth knocked out with kicks from boots as the girl lays on\r\nthe ground. The boys, in their turn, are out thieving all day, and the\r\nlodging-housekeeper will buy any stolen provisions of them, and sell\r\nthem to the lodgers. I never saw the police in the house. If a boy\r\ncomes to the house on a night without money or sawney, or something to\r\nsell to the lodgers, a handkerchief or something of that kind, he is\r\nnot admitted, but told very plainly, ‘Go thieve it, then.’ Girls are\r\ntreated just the same. Any body may call in the daytime at this house\r\nand have a halfpennyworth of coffee and sit any length of time until\r\nevening. I have seen three dozen sitting there that way, all thieves\r\nand bad girls. There are no chairs, and only one form in front of the\r\nfire, on which a dozen can sit. The others sit on the floor all about\r\nthe room, as near the fire as they can. Bad language goes on during\r\nthe day, as I have told you it did during the night, and indecencies\r\ntoo, but nothing like so bad as at night. They talk about where there\r\nis good places to go and thieve. The missioners call sometimes, but\r\nthey’re laughed at often when they’re talking, and always before the\r\ndoor’s closed on them. If a decent girl goes there to get a ha’porth\r\nof coffee, seeing the board over the door, she is always shocked. Many\r\na poor girl has been ruined in this house since I was, and boys have\r\nboasted about it. I never knew boy or girl do good, once get used\r\nthere. Get used there, indeed, and you are life-ruined. I was an only\r\nchild, and haven’t a friend in the world. I have heard several girls\r\nsay how they would like to get out of the life, and out of the place.\r\nFrom those I know, I think that cruel parents and mistresses cause\r\nmany to be driven there. One lodging-house keeper, Mrs. ----, goes out\r\ndressed respectable, and pawns any stolen property, or sells it at\r\npublic-houses.”\r\n\r\nAs a corroboration of the girl’s statement, a wretched-looking\r\nboy, only thirteen years of age, gave me the following additional\r\ninformation. He had a few rags hanging about him, and no shirt--indeed,\r\nhe was hardly covered enough for purposes of decency, his skin\r\nbeing exposed through the rents in his jacket and trowsers. He had\r\na stepfather, who treated him very cruelly. The stepfather and the\r\nchild’s mother went “across the country,” begging and stealing. Before\r\nthe mother died, an elder brother ran away on account of being beaten:--\r\n\r\n“Sometimes (I give his own words) he (the stepfather) wouldn’t give\r\nus a bit to eat, telling us to go and thieve for it. My brother had\r\nbeen a month gone (he’s now a soldier in Gibraltar) when I ran away to\r\njoin him. I knew where to find him, as we met sometimes. We lived by\r\nthieving, and I do still--by pulling flesh (stealing meat). I got to\r\nlodge at Mrs. ----, and have been there this eight months. I can read\r\nand write a little.” [This boy then confirmed what the young girl had\r\ntold me of the grossest acts night by night among the boys and girls,\r\nthe language, &c., and continued]--“I always sleep on the floor for\r\n1_d._ and pay a 1/2_d._ besides for coke. At this lodging-house cats\r\nand kittens are melted down, sometimes twenty a day. A quart pot is\r\na cat, and pints and half pints are kittens. A kitten (pint) brings\r\n3_d._ from the rag shops, and a cat 6_d._ There’s convenience to melt\r\nthem down at the lodging-house. We can’t sell clothes in the house,\r\nexcept any lodger wants them; and clothes nearly all goes to the Jews\r\nin Petticoat-lane. Mrs. ---- buys the sawney of us; so much for the\r\nlump, 2_d._ a pound about; she sells it again for twice what she gives,\r\nand more. Perhaps 30 lb. of meat every day is sold to her. I have been\r\nin prison six times, and have had three dozen; each time I came out\r\nharder. If I left Mrs. ----’s house I don’t know how I could get my\r\nliving. Lots of boys would get away if they could. I never drink, I\r\ndon’t like it. Very few of us boys drink. I don’t like thieving, and\r\noften go about singing; but I can’t live by singing, and I don’t know\r\nhow I could live honestly. If I had money enough to buy a stock of\r\noranges I think I could be honest.”\r\n\r\nThe above facts require no comment from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A BEGGAR.\r\n\r\nA beggar decently attired, and with a simple and what some would call\r\neven a respectable look, gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n“I am now twenty-eight, and have known all connected with the begging\r\ntrade since I was fourteen. My grandfather (mother’s father) was rich,\r\nowning three parts of the accommodation houses in St. Giles’s; he\r\nallowed me 2_s._ a week pocket-money. My grandfather kept the great\r\nhouse, the old Rose and Crown, in Church-lane, opposite Carver-street,\r\nbest known as the ‘Beggar’s Opera.’ When a child of seven, I have seen\r\nthe place crowded--crammed with nothing but beggars, first-rates--none\r\nelse used the house. The money I saw in the hands of the beggars made\r\na great impression upon me. My father took away my mother’s money. I\r\nwish my mother had run away instead. He was kind, but she was always\r\nnagging. My father was a foreman in a foundry. I got a situation in\r\nthe same foundry after my father cut. Once I was sent to a bank with\r\na cheque for 38_l._ to get cashed, in silver, for wages. In coming\r\naway, I met a companion of mine, and he persuaded me to bolt with\r\nthe money, and go to Ashley’s. The money was too much for my head to\r\ncarry. I fooled all that money away. I wasn’t in bed for more than a\r\nfortnight. I bought linnets in cages for the fancy of my persuader. In\r\nfact, I didn’t know what use to put the money to. I was among plenty of\r\ngirls. When the money was out I was destitute. I couldn’t go back to\r\nmy employers, and I couldn’t face my mother’s temper--that was worse;\r\nbut for that nagging of hers I shouldn’t have been as I am. She has\r\nthrashed me with a hand broom until I was silly; there’s the bumps\r\non my head still; and yet that woman would have given me her heart’s\r\nblood to do me a good. As soon as I found myself quite destitute, I\r\nwent wandering about the City, picking up the skins of gooseberries and\r\norange peel to eat, to live on--things my stomach would turn at now. At\r\nlast my mother came to hear that I tried to destroy myself. She paid\r\nthe 38_l._, and my former employers got me a situation in Paddington. I\r\nwas there a month, and then I met him as advised me to steal the money\r\nbefore--he’s called the ex-king of the costermongers now. Well he was\r\ncrying hareskins, and advised me again to bolt, and I went with him.\r\nMy mind was bent upon costermongering and a roving life. I couldn’t\r\nsettle to anything. I wanted to be away when I was at work, and when I\r\nwas away I wanted to be back again. It was difficult for me to stick\r\nto anything for five minutes together; it is so now. What I begin I\r\ncan’t finish at the time--unless it’s a pot of beer. Well, in four days\r\nmy adviser left me; he had no more use for me. I was a flat. He had\r\nme for a “go-along,” to cry his things for him. Then, for the first\r\ntime in my life, I went into a low lodging-house. There was forty men\r\nand women sleeping in one room. I had to sleep with a black man, and I\r\nslept on the floor to get away from the fellow. There were plenty of\r\ngirls there; some playing cards and dominoes. It was very dirty--old\r\nMother ----, in Lawrence-lane--the Queen of Hell she was called. There\r\nwas one tub among the lot of us. I felt altogether disgusted. Those\r\nwho lived there were beggars, thieves, smashers, coiners, purchasers\r\nof begged and stolen goods, and prostitutes. The youngest prostitute\r\nwas twelve, and so up to fifty. The beastliest language went on. It’s\r\ndone to outrival one another. There I met with a man called Tom Shallow\r\n(_shallow_ is cant for half-naked), and he took me out ballad-singing,\r\nand when we couldn’t get on at that (the songs got dead) he left me. I\r\nmade him 10_s._ or 12_s._ a day in them days, but he only gave me my\r\nlodgings and grub (but not half enough), and two pipes of tobacco a day\r\nto keep the hunger down, that I mightn’t be expensive. I then ’listed.\r\nI was starving, and couldn’t raise a lodging. I took the shilling, but\r\nwas rejected by the doctor. I ’listed again at Chatham afterwards, but\r\nwas rejected again. I stayed jobbing among the soldiers for some weeks,\r\nand then they gave me an old regimental suit, and with that I came to\r\nLondon. One gave me a jacket, and another a pair of military trowsers,\r\nand another a pair of old ammunition boots, and so on. About that\r\ntime a batch of invalids came from Spain, where they had been under\r\nGeneral Evans. On my way up from Chatham, I met at Gravesend with seven\r\nchaps out on ‘_the Spanish lurk_’ as they called it--that is, passing\r\nthemselves off as wounded men of the Spanish Legion. Two _had been_ out\r\nin Spain, and managed the business if questions were asked; the others\r\nwere regular English beggars, who had never been out of the country.\r\nI joined them as a serjeant, as I had a sergeant’s jacket given me at\r\nChatham. On our way to London--‘the school’ (as the lot is called) came\r\nall together--we picked up among us 4_l._ and 5_l._ a day--no matter\r\nwhere we went. ‘The school’ all slept in lodging houses, and I at last\r\nbegan to feel comfortable in them. We spent our evenings in eating\r\nout-and-out suppers. Sometimes we had such things as sucking pigs,\r\nhams, mince pies--indeed we lived on the best. No nobleman could live\r\nbetter in them days. So much wine, too! I drank in such excess, my nose\r\nwas as big as that there letter stamp; so that I got a sickening of\r\nit. We gave good victuals away that was given to us--it was a nuisance\r\nto carry them. It cost us from 6_d._ to 1_s._ a day to have our shoes\r\ncleaned by _poor_ tramps, and for clean dickies. The clean dodge is\r\nalways the best for begging upon. At Woolwich we were all on the fuddle\r\nat the Dust Hole, and our two spokesmen were drunk; and I went to beg\r\nof Major ----, whose brother was then in Spain--he himself had been\r\nout previously. Meeting the major at his own house, I said, ‘I was a\r\nsergeant in the 3rd Westminster Grenadiers, you know, and served under\r\nyour brother.’ ‘Oh! yes, that’s my brother’s regiment,’ says he. ‘Where\r\nwas you, then, on the 16th of October?’ ‘Why, sir, I was at the taking\r\nof the city of Irun,’ says I--(in fact, I was at that time with the\r\ncostermonger in St. Giles’s, calling cabbages, ‘white heart cabbages,\r\noh!’) Then said the major, ‘What day was Ernani taken on?’ ‘Why,’ said\r\nI (I was a little tipsy, and bothered at the question), ‘that was the\r\n16th of October, too.’ ‘Very well, my man,’ says he, tapping his boots\r\nwith a riding whip he held, ‘I’ll see what I can do for you;’ and the\r\nwords were no sooner out of his mouth than he stepped up to me and\r\ngave me a regular pasting. He horsewhipped me up and down stairs, and\r\nall along the passages; my flesh was like sassages. I managed at last,\r\nhowever, to open the door myself, and get away. After that ‘the school’\r\ncame to London. In a day we used to make from 8_l._ to 10_l._ among\r\nus, by walking up Regent-street, Bond-street, Piccadilly, Pall-mall,\r\nOxford-street, the parks--those places were the best beats. All the\r\nsquares were good too. It was only like a walk out for air, and your\r\n25_s._ a man for it. At night we used to go to plays, dressed like\r\ngentlemen. At first the beaks protected us, but we got found out, and\r\nthe beaks grew rusty. The thing got so overdone, every beggar went out\r\nas a Spanish lurksman. Well, the beaks got up to the dodge, and all the\r\nSpanish lurksmen in their turns got to work the universal staircase,\r\nunder the care of Lieutenant Tracy (Tothill-fields treadmill). The men\r\nthat had really been out and got disabled were sent to that staircase\r\nat last, and I thought I would try a fresh lurk. So I went under\r\nthe care and tuition of a sailor. He had been a sailor. I became a\r\n_turnpike sailor_, as it’s called, and went out as one of the Shallow\r\nBrigade, wearing a Guernsey shirt and drawers, or tattered trowsers.\r\nThere was a school of four. We only got a tidy living--16_s._ or 1_l._\r\na day among us. We used to call every one that came along--coalheavers\r\nand all--sea-fighting captains. ‘Now, my noble sea-fighting captain,’\r\nwe used to say, ‘fire an odd shot from your larboard locker to\r\nus, Nelson’s bull-dogs;’ but mind we never tried that dodge on at\r\nGreenwich, for fear of the old geese, the Collegemen. The Shallow got\r\nso grannied (known) in London, that the supplies got queer, and I\r\nquitted the land navy. Shipwrecks got so common in the streets, you\r\nsee, that people didn’t care for them, and I dropped getting cast away.\r\nI then took to _screeving_ (writing on the stones). I got my head\r\nshaved, and a cloth tied round my jaws, and wrote on the flags--\r\n\r\n  ‘_Illness and Want_,’\r\n\r\nthough I was never better in my life, and always had a good bellyfull\r\nbefore I started of a morning. I did very well at first: 3_s._ or\r\n4_s._ a day--sometimes more--till I got grannied. There is one man\r\nwho draws Christ’s heads with a crown of thorns, and mackerel, on the\r\npavement, in coloured chalks (there are four or five others at the same\r\nbusiness); this one, however, often makes 1_l._ a day now in three\r\nhours; indeed, I have known him come home with 21_s._, besides what he\r\ndrank on the way. A gentleman who met him in Regent-street once gave\r\nhim 5_l._ and a suit of clothes to do Christ’s heads with a crown of\r\nthorns and mackerel on the walls. His son does Napoleon’s heads best,\r\nbut makes nothing like so much as the father. The father draws cats’\r\nheads and salmon as well--but the others are far the best spec. He will\r\noften give thirteen-pence, and indeed fourteen-pence, for a silver\r\nshilling, to get rid of the coppers. This man’s pitch is Lloyd-square,\r\nnot far from Sadler’s Wells. I have seen him commence his pitch there\r\nat half-past eleven, to catch the people come from the theatre. He is\r\nvery clever. In wet weather, and when I couldn’t chalk, as I couldn’t\r\nafford to lose time, I used to dress tidy and very clean for the\r\n‘_respectable broken-down tradesman or reduced gentleman_’ caper. I\r\nwore a suit of black, generally, and a clean dickey, and sometimes old\r\nblack kid gloves, and I used to stand with a paper before my face, as\r\nif ashamed--\r\n\r\n  ‘_To a Humane Public.\r\n  ‘I have seen better days._’\r\n\r\nThis is called standing pad with a fakement. It is a wet-weather dodge,\r\nand isn’t so good as screeving, but I did middling, and can’t bear\r\nbeing idle. After this I mixed with the street patterers (men who make\r\nspeeches in the streets) on _the destitute mechanics’ lurk_. We went in\r\na school of six at first, all in clean aprons, and spoke every man in\r\nhis turn. It won’t do unless you’re clean. Each man wanted a particular\r\narticle of dress. One had no shirt--another no shoes--another no\r\nhat--and so on. No two wanted the same. We said:--\r\n\r\n “‘Kind and benevolent Christians!--It is with feelings of deep\r\n regret, and sorrow and shame, that us unfortunate tradesmen are\r\n compelled to appear before you this day, to ask charity from the\r\n hands of strangers. We are brought to it from want--I may say, actual\r\n starvation.’ (We always had a good breakfast before we started, and\r\n some of us, sir, was full up to the brim of liquor.) ‘But what will\r\n not hunger and the cries of children compel men to do.’ (We were\r\n all single men.) ‘When we left our solitary and humble homes this\r\n morning, our children were crying for food, but if a farthing would\r\n have saved their lives, we hadn’t it to give them. I assure you, kind\r\n friends, me, my wife, and three children, would have been houseless\r\n wanderers all last night, but I sold the shirt from off my back as\r\n you may see (opening my jacket) to pay for a lodging. We are, kind\r\n friends, _English_ mechanics. It is hard that you wont give your own\r\n countrymen a penny, when you give so much to _foreign_ hurdy-gurdies\r\n and organ-grinders. Owing to the introduction of steam and machinery\r\n and foreign manufactures we have been brought to this degraded state.\r\n Fellow countrymen, there are at this moment 4000 men like ourselves,\r\n able and willing to work, but can’t get it, and forced to wander the\r\n streets. I hope and trust some humane Christian within the sound of\r\n my voice will stretch out a hand with a small trifle for us, be it\r\n ever so small, or a bit of dry bread or cold potato, or anything\r\n turned from your table, it would be of the greatest benefit to us and\r\n our poor children.’ (Then we would whisper to one another, ‘I hope\r\n they won’t bring out any scran--only coppers.’) ‘We have none of us\r\n tasted food this blessed day. We have been told to go to our parishes,\r\n but that we cannot brook; to be torn from our wives and families is\r\n heart-rending to think of--may God save us all from the Bastile!’ (We\r\n always pattered hard at the overseers).\r\n\r\nThe next of the school that spoke would change the story somehow, and\r\ntry to make it more heart-rending still. We did well at first, making\r\nabout 5_s._ a day each, working four hours, two in the morning and two\r\nin the afternoon. We got a good deal of clothing too. The man who went\r\nwithout a shirt never went to a door to ask for one; he had to show\r\nhimself in the middle of the road. The man that _did_ go to the door\r\nwould say, ‘Do bestow a shirt on my poor shopmate, who hasn’t had one\r\nfor some days.’ It’s been said of me, when I had my shirt tied round my\r\nwaist all the time out of sight. The man who goes without his shirt has\r\nhis pick of those given; the rest are sold and shared. Whatever trade\r\nwe represented we always had one or two really of the trade in the\r\nschool. These were always to be met at the lodging-houses. They were\r\nout of work, and had to go to low lodging-houses to sleep. There they\r\nmet with beggars who kiddied them on to the lurk. The lodging-houses\r\nis good schools for that sort of thing, and when a mechanic once gets\r\nout on the lurk he never cares to go to work again. I never knew one\r\nreturn. I have been out oft and oft with weavers with a loom, and have\r\nwoven a piece of ribbon in a gentleman’s parlour--that was when we was\r\nCoventry ribbon weavers. I have been a stocking weaver from Leicester,\r\nand a lacemaker too from Nottingham. Distressed mechanics on their way\r\nto London get initiated into beggar’s tricks in the low lodging-houses\r\nand the unions. This is the way, you see, sir. A school may be at\r\nwork from the lodging-house where the mechanic goes to, and some of\r\nthe school finds out what he is, and says, ‘Come and work with us in\r\na school: you’ll do better than you can at your business, and you can\r\nanswer any questions; we’ll lurk on your trade.’ I have been out with\r\na woman and children. It’s been said in the papers that children can\r\nbe hired for that lurk at 4_d._ or 6_d._ a day--that’s all fudge, all\r\nstuff, every bit of it--there’s no children to be hired. There’s many a\r\nlabouring man out of work, who has a wife and three or more children,\r\nwho is glad to let them go out with any patterer he knows. The woman\r\nis entitled to all the clothes and grub given, and her share of the\r\ntin--that’s the way it’s done; and she’s treated to a drink after her\r\nday’s work, into the bargain. I’ve been out on the _respectable family\r\nman_ lurk. I was out with a woman and three kids the other day; her\r\nhusband was on the pad in the country, as London was too hot to hold\r\nhim. The kids draws, the younger the better, for if you vex them, and\r\nthey’re oldish, they’ll blow you. Liverpool Joe’s boy did so at Bury\r\nSt. Edmund’s to a patterer that he was out with, and who spoke cross\r\nto him. The lad shouted out so as the people about might hear, ‘Don’t\r\nyou jaw me, you’re not my father; my father’s at home playing cards.’\r\nThey had to crack the pitch (discontinue) through that. The respectable\r\nfamily dodge did pretty well. I’ve been on _the clean family_ lurk\r\ntoo, with a woman and children. We dressed to give the notion that,\r\nhowever humble, at least we were clean in all our poverty. On this\r\nlurk we stand by the side of the pavement in silence, the wife in a\r\nperticler clean cap, and a milk-white apron. The kids have long clean\r\npinafores, white as the driven snow; they’re only used in clean lurk,\r\nand taken off directly they come home. The husband and father is in a\r\nwhite flannel jacket, an apron worn and clean, and polished shoes. To\r\nsucceed in this caper there must be no rags, but plenty of darns. A\r\npack of pawn-tickets is carried in the waistcoat pocket. (One man that\r\nI know stuck them in his hat like a carman’s.) That’s to show that\r\nthey’ve parted with their little all before they came to that. They are\r\nreal pawn-tickets. I have known a man pay 2_s._ 6_d._ for the loan of\r\na marriage certificate to go out on the clean lurk. If a question is\r\nasked, I say--‘We’ve parted with everything, and can get no employment;\r\nto be sure, we have had a loaf from the parish, but what’s that among\r\nmy family?’ That takes the start out of the people, because they say,\r\nwhy not go to the parish? Some persons say, ‘Oh, poor folks, they’re\r\nbrought to this, and how clean they are--a darn is better than a patch\r\nany time.’ The clean lurk is a bare living now--it was good--lots of\r\ntogs came in, and often the whole family were taken into a house and\r\nsupplied with flannel enough to make under clothing for them all; all\r\nthis was pledged soon afterwards, and the tickets shown to prove what\r\nwas parted with, through want. Those are some of the leading lurks.\r\nThere’s others. ‘Fits,’ are now bad, and ‘paralytics’ are no better.\r\n_The lucifer lurk_ seems getting up though. I don’t mean the selling,\r\nbut the dropping them in the street as if by accident. It’s a great\r\nthing with the children; but no go with the old ’uns. I’ll tell you of\r\nanother lurk: a woman I knows sends out her child with 1/4 oz. of tea\r\nand half a quarter of sugar, and the child sits on a door step crying,\r\nand saying, if questioned, that she was sent out for tea and sugar,\r\nand a boy snatched the change from her, and threw the tea and sugar\r\nin the gutter. The mother is there, like a stranger, and says to the\r\nchild:--‘And was that your poor mother’s last shilling, and daren’t\r\nyou go home, poor thing?’ Then there is a gathering--sometimes 18_d._\r\nin a morning; but it’s almost getting stale, that is. I’ve done _the\r\nshivering dodge_ too--gone out in the cold weather half naked. One man\r\nhas practised it so much that he can’t get off shivering now. Shaking\r\nJemmy went on with his shivering so long that he couldn’t help it at\r\nlast. He shivered like a jelly--like a calf’s foot with the ague--on\r\nthe hottest day in summer. It’s a good dodge in tidy inclement seasons.\r\nIt’s not so good a lurk, by two bob a day, as it once was. This is a\r\nsingle-handed job; for if one man shivers less than another he shows\r\nthat it isn’t so cold as the good shiverer makes it out--then it’s no\r\ngo. Of the _maimed beggars_, some are really deserving objects, as\r\nwithout begging they must starve to death; that’s a fact, sir. What’s\r\na labouring man to do if he’s lost any of his limbs? But some of these\r\neven are impostors. I know several blind men who have pensions; and I\r\nknow two who have not only pensions, but keep lodging-houses, and are\r\nworth money, and still go out a begging--though not near where they\r\nlive. There’s the man with the very big leg, who sits on the pavement,\r\nand tells a long yarn about the tram carriage having gone over him\r\nin the mine. He does very well--remarkable well. He goes tatting and\r\nbilly-hunting in the country (gathering rags and buying old metal),\r\nand comes only to London when he has that sort of thing to dispose of.\r\nThere’s Paddy in the truck too; he makes a good thing, and sends money\r\nhome to Ireland; he has a decrepit old mother, and it’s to his credit.\r\nHe never drinks. There’s Jerry, the collier, he has lost both arms, and\r\ndoes a tidy living, and deserves it; it’s a bad misfortune. There’s\r\nJack Tiptoe, he can’t put one heel to the ground--no gammon; but Mr.\r\nHorsford and he can’t agree, so Jack takes to the provinces now. He did\r\nvery well indeed here. There used to be a society among us called _the\r\nCadger’s Club_; if one got into a prison there was a gathering for him\r\nwhen he came out, and 6_s._ a week for a sick member, and when he got\r\nout again two collections for him, the two amounting perhaps to 1_l._\r\nWe paid 3_d._ a week each--no women were members--for thirteen weeks,\r\nand then shared what was in hand, and began for the next thirteen,\r\nreceiving new members and transacting the usual business of a club.\r\nThis has been discontinued these five years; the landlord cut away with\r\nthe funds. We get up raffles, and help one another in the best way we\r\ncan now. At one time we had forty-five members, besides the secretary,\r\nthe conductor, and under-conductor. The rules were read over on meeting\r\nnights--every Wednesday evening. They were very strict; no swearing,\r\nobscene or profane language was permitted. For the first offence a\r\nfine of 1_d._ was inflicted, for the second 2_d._, and for the third\r\nthe offender was ejected the room. There was very good order, and few\r\nfines had to be inflicted. Several respectable tradesmen used to pay a\r\ntrifle to be admitted, out of curiosity, to see the proceedings, and\r\nused to be surprised at their regularity. Among the other rules were\r\nthese: a fine of 1_d._ for any member refusing to sing when called on;\r\nvisitors the same. All the fines went to the fund. If a member didn’t\r\npay for five meeting nights he was scratched. Very few were scratched.\r\nThe secretary was a windmill cove (sold children’s windmills in the\r\nstreets), and was excused contributing to the funds. He had 1_d._ from\r\neach member every sharing night, once a quarter, for his labour; he\r\nwas a very good scholar, and had been brought up well. The landlord\r\ngenerally gave a bob on a sharing night. The conductor managed the\r\nroom, and the under-conductor kept the door, not admitting those who\r\nhad no right to be there, and putting out those who behaved improperly.\r\nIt was held in the Coachmakers’ Arms, Rose-street, Longrave-street;\r\ntip-top swells used to come among us, and no mistake; real noblemen,\r\nsir. One was the nephew of the Duke of ----, and was well-known to all\r\nof us by the nick-name, Facer.\r\n\r\nI used to smoke a very short and very black pipe, and the honourable\r\ngent has often snatched it from my mouth, and has given me a dozen\r\ncigars for it. My face has been washed in the gin by a noble lord after\r\nhe’d made me drunk, and I felt as if it was vitriol about my eyes.\r\nThe beggars are now dispersed and broken up. They live together now\r\nonly in twos and threes, and, in plain truth, have no money to spend;\r\nthey can’t get it. Upon an average, in former days a cadger could make\r\nhis two or three guineas per week without working overtime; but now\r\nhe can hardly get a meal, not even at the present winter, though it’s\r\nbeen a slap up inclement season, to be sure. The Mendicity Society has\r\nruined us--them men took me and gave me a month, and I can say from\r\nmy conscience, that I was no more guilty of begging at that time than\r\nan unborn baby. The beggars generally live in the low lodging-houses,\r\nand there of a night they tell their tales of the day, and inform each\r\nother of the good and bad places throughout London, and what ‘lurks’\r\ndo the best. They will also say what beats they intend to take the\r\nnext day, so that those who are on the same lurk may not go over the\r\nsame ground as their pals. It is no use telling a lie, but the low\r\nlodging-houses throughout London and the country are nests for beggars\r\nand thieves. I know some houses that are wholly supported by beggars.\r\nIn almost every one of the padding kens, or low lodging-houses in\r\nthe country, there is a list of walks written on a piece of paper,\r\nand pasted up over the kitchen mantel-piece. Now at St. Alban’s, for\r\ninstance, at the ----, and at other places, there is a paper stuck\r\nup in each of the kitchens. This paper is headed ‘WALKS OUT OF THIS\r\nTOWN,’ and underneath it is set down the names of the villages in the\r\nneighbourhood at which a beggar may call when out on his walk, and they\r\nare so arranged as to allow the cadger to make a round of about six\r\nmiles, each day, and return the same night. In many of those papers\r\nthere are sometimes twenty walks set down. No villages that are in any\r\nway ‘gammy’ are ever mentioned in these papers, and the cadger, if he\r\nfeels inclined to stop for a few days in the town, will be told by the\r\nlodging-house keeper, or the other cadgers that he may meet there,\r\nwhat gentleman’s seats or private houses are of any account on the\r\nwalk that he means to take. The names of the good houses are not set\r\ndown in the paper, for fear of the police. Most of the lodging-house\r\nkeepers buy the ‘scran’ (broken victuals) of the cadgers; the good food\r\nthey either eat themselves or sell to the other travellers, and the\r\nbad they sell to parties to feed their dogs or pigs upon. The cadgers’\r\ntalk is quite different now to what it was in the days of Billy. You\r\nsee the flats got awake to it, so in course we had to alter the patter.\r\nThe new style of cadgers’ cant is nothing like the thieves’ cant, and\r\nis done all on the rhyming principle. This way’s the caper. Suppose\r\nI want to ask a pal to come and have a _glass_ of _rum_ and smoke a\r\n_pipe_ of _tobacco_, and have a game at _cards_ with some _blokes_\r\nat _home_ with me, I should say, if there were any flats present,\r\n‘Splodger, will you have a Jack-surp_ass_ of finger-and-_thumb_, and\r\nblow your yard of _tripe_ of nosey me _knacker_, and have a touch of\r\nthe _broads_ with me and the other heaps of _coke_ at my _drum_. [In\r\nthis it will be observed that every one of the ‘cant’ words rhymes with\r\nthe words ordinarily used to express the same idea.] I can assure you\r\nwhat little we cadgers do get we earn uncommon hard. Why, from standing\r\nshaking--that is, being out nearly naked in the hardest frosts--I\r\nlost the use of my left side for nearly three years, and wasn’t able\r\nto stir outside the door. I got my living by card-playing in the low\r\nlodging-houses all that time. I worked the oracle--they were not up to\r\nit. I put the first and seconds on and the bridge also. I’d play at\r\ncards with any one. You see, sir, I was afeard to come to you at first\r\nbecause I had been ‘a starving’ on the pavement only a few days ago,\r\nnot a hundred yards from your very door, and I thought you might know\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING OF THIEVES.\r\n\r\nAs a further proof, however, of the demoralizing influences of the low\r\nlodging-houses, I will now conclude my investigations into the subject\r\nwith a report of the meeting of vagrants, which I convened for the\r\nexpress purpose of consulting them generally upon several points which\r\nhad come under my notice in the course of my inquiries. The Chronicle\r\nreporter’s account of this meeting was as follows:--\r\n\r\nA meeting of an unprecedented character was held at the British Union\r\nSchool-room, Shakspeare-walk, Shadwell, on Monday evening last.\r\nThe use of the school-room was kindly granted by Mr. Fletcher, the\r\nproprietor, to whose liberality we stand indebted for many similar\r\nfavours. It was convened by our Metropolitan Correspondent, for the\r\npurpose of assembling together some of the lowest class of male\r\njuvenile thieves and vagabonds who infest the metropolis and the\r\ncountry at large; and although privately called, at only two days’\r\nnotice, by the distribution of tickets of admission among the class\r\nin question at the various haunts and dens of infamy to which they\r\nresort, no fewer than 150 of them attended on the occasion. The only\r\ncondition to entitle the parties to admission was that they should\r\nbe vagrants, and under twenty years of age. They had all assembled\r\nsome time before the hour for commencing the proceedings arrived, and\r\nnever was witnessed a more distressing spectacle of squalor, rags,\r\nand wretchedness. Some were young men, and some mere children; one,\r\nwho styled himself a “cadger,” was six years of age, and several who\r\nconfessed themselves “prigs” were only ten. The countenances of the\r\nboys were of various characters. Many were not only good-looking, but\r\nhad a frank, ingenuous expression that seemed in no way connected\r\nwith innate roguery. Many, on the other hand, had the deep-sunk and\r\nhalf-averted eye which are so characteristic of natural dishonesty and\r\ncunning. Some had the regular features of lads born of parents in easy\r\ncircumstances. The hair of most of the lads was cut very close to the\r\nhead, showing their recent liberation from prison; indeed, one might\r\ntell by the comparative length of the crop, the time that each boy had\r\nbeen out of gaol. All but a few of the elder boys were remarkable,\r\namidst the rags, filth, and wretchedness of their external appearance,\r\nfor the mirth and carelessness impressed upon their countenances. At\r\nfirst their behaviour was very noisy and disorderly: coarse and ribald\r\njokes were freely cracked, exciting general bursts of laughter; while\r\nhowls, cat-calls, and all manner of unearthly and indescribable yells\r\nthreatened for some time to render the object of the meeting utterly\r\nabortive. At one moment a lad would imitate the bray of a jack-ass,\r\nand immediately the whole hundred and fifty would fall to braying.\r\nThen some ragged urchin would crow like a cock, whereupon the place\r\nwould echo again with a hundred and fifty cock-crows. Then, as a\r\nblack boy entered the room, one of the young vagabonds would shout\r\nout “swe-ee-op.” This would be received with peals of laughter, and\r\nfollowed by a general repetition of the same cry. Next, a hundred\r\nand fifty cat-calls of the shrillest possible description would\r\nalmost split the ears. These would be succeeded by cries of “Strike\r\nup, you catgut scrapers,” “Go on with your barrow,” “Flare up, my\r\nnever-sweats,” and a variety of other street sayings. Indeed, the\r\nuproar which went on before the meeting began will be best understood\r\nif we compare it to the scene presented by a public menagerie at\r\nfeeding time. The greatest difficulty, as might be expected, was\r\nexperienced in collecting the subjoined statistics of their character\r\nand condition. By a well-contrived and persevering mode of inquiry,\r\nhowever, the following facts were elicited:--\r\n\r\nWith respect to their _ages_, the youngest boy present was 6 years old.\r\nHe styled himself a “cadger,” and said that his mother, who is a widow,\r\nand suffering from ill-health, sends him into the streets to beg. There\r\nwere seven of 10 years of age, three of 12, three of 13, ten of 14, ten\r\nof 15, eleven of 16, twenty of 17, twenty-six of 18, and forty-five of\r\n19.\r\n\r\nNineteen had _fathers and mothers_ still living; thirty-nine had only\r\none parent, and eighty were orphans in the fullest sense of the word,\r\nhaving neither father nor mother alive.\r\n\r\nOf _professed beggars_ there were fifty, and sixty-six who acknowledged\r\nthemselves to be _habitual thieves_. The announcement that the greater\r\nnumber present were thieves pleased them exceedingly, and was received\r\nwith three rounds of applause.\r\n\r\nTwelve of the youths assembled had been _in prison_ once (two of these\r\nwere but 10 years of age); 5 had been in prison twice; 3, thrice; 4\r\nfour times; 7, five times; 8, six times; 5, seven times; 4, eight\r\ntimes; 2, nine times (1 of them 13 years of age); 5, ten times; 5,\r\ntwelve times; 2, thirteen times; 3, fourteen times; 2, sixteen times;\r\n3, seventeen times; 2, eighteen times; 5, twenty times; 6, twenty-four\r\ntimes; 1, twenty-five times; 1, twenty-six times; and 1, twenty-nine\r\ntimes. The announcements in reply to the questions as to the number\r\nof times that any of them had been in prison were received with great\r\napplause, which became more and more boisterous as the number of\r\nimprisonments increased. When it was announced that one, though only\r\n19 years of age, had been in prison as many as twenty-nine times,\r\nthe clapping of hands, the cat-calls, and shouts of “brayvo!” lasted\r\nfor several minutes, and the whole of the boys rose to look at the\r\ndistinguished individual. Some chalked on their hats the figures which\r\ndesignated the sum of the several times that they had been in gaol.\r\n\r\nAs to the _causes of their vagabondism_, it was found that 22 had run\r\naway from their homes, owing to the ill-treatment of their parents; 18\r\nconfessed to having been ruined through their parents allowing them\r\nto run wild in the streets, and to be led astray by bad companions;\r\nand 15 acknowledged that they had been first taught thieving in a\r\nlodging-house.\r\n\r\nConcerning the vagrant habits of the youths, the following facts were\r\nelicited: 78 regularly roam through the country every year, 65 sleep\r\nregularly in the casual wards of the unions, and 52 occasionally slept\r\nin tramper’s lodging-houses throughout the country.\r\n\r\nRespecting their _education_, according to the popular meaning of\r\nthe term, 63 of the 150 were able to read and write, and they were\r\nprincipally thieves. Fifty of this number said they had read “Jack\r\nSheppard,” and the lives of Dick Turpin, Claude du Val, and all the\r\nother popular thieves’ novels, as well as the “Newgate Calendar”\r\nand “Lives of the Robbers and Pirates.” Those who could not read\r\nthemselves, said they’d had “Jack Sheppard” read to them at the\r\nlodging-houses. Numbers avowed that they had been induced to resort\r\nto an abandoned course of life from reading the lives of notorious\r\nthieves, and novels about highway robbers. When asked what they thought\r\nof “Jack Sheppard,” several bawled out “He’s a regular brick”--a\r\nsentiment which was almost universally concurred in by the deafening\r\nshouts and plaudits which followed. When asked whether they would like\r\nto be Jack Sheppards, they answered, “Yes, if the times was the same\r\nnow as they were then.” Thirteen confessed that they had taken to\r\nthieving in order to go to the low theatres; and one lad said he had\r\nlost a good situation on the Birmingham Railway through his love of the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nTwenty stated they had _been flogged in prison_,--many of them two,\r\nthree, and four different times. A policeman in plain clothes was\r\npresent; but their acute eyes were not long before they detected his\r\nreal character notwithstanding his disguise. Several demanded that he\r\nshould be turned out. The officer was accordingly given to understand\r\nthat the meeting was a private one, and requested to withdraw. Having\r\napologised for intruding, he proceeded to leave the room--and, no\r\nsooner did the boys see the policeman move towards the door, than they\r\ngave vent to several rounds of very hearty applause, accompanied with\r\nhisses, groans, and cries of “throw him over.”\r\n\r\nThe process of interrogating them in the mass having been concluded,\r\nthe next step was to call several of them separately to the platform,\r\nto narrate, in their peculiar style and phraseology, the history of\r\ntheir own career, together with the causes which had led them to take\r\nup a life of dishonesty. The novelty of their position as speech-makers\r\nseemed peculiarly exciting to the speakers themselves, and provoked\r\nmuch merriment and interest amongst the lads. Their antics and\r\nbuffoonery in commencing their addresses were certainly of the most\r\nludicrous character. The first speaker, a lad 17 years of age, ascended\r\nthe platform, dressed in a torn “wide-a-awake” hat, and a dirty\r\nsmock-frock. He began:--Gentlemen [immense applause and laughter], I am\r\na Brummagem lad [laughter]. My father has been dead three years, and\r\nmy mother seven. When my father died I had to go and live along with my\r\naunt. I fell out of employment, and went round about the town, and fell\r\ninto the company of a lot of chaps, and went picking ladies’ pockets.\r\nThen I was in prison once or twice, and I came to London, and have been\r\nin several prisons here. I have been in London three years; but I have\r\nbeen out of it several times in that time. I can’t get anything honest\r\nto do; and I wish I could get something at sea, or in any foreign land.\r\nI don’t care what or where it is [cheers and yells].\r\n\r\nAnother lad about 16, clad in a ragged coat, with a dirty face and\r\nmatted hair, next came forward and said--My father was a soldier, and\r\nwhen I growed up to about ten years I joined the regiment as a drummer\r\nin the Grenadier Guards. I went on and got myself into trouble, till at\r\nlast I got turned away, and my father left the regiment. I then went\r\nout with some more chaps and went thieving, and have been thieving\r\nabout two years now. [Several voices--“Very good;” “that’s beautiful;”\r\n“I hope you do it well.”]\r\n\r\nThe third boy, who stated that he had been twenty-four times in\r\nprison, said he belonged to Hendon, in Middlesex, and that his father\r\nleft his mother seventeen years ago, and he did not know whether he\r\nwas dead or alive. He went to Christchurch school for some time, but\r\nafterwards picked up with bad companions, and went a thieving. He went\r\nto school again, but again left it to go a thieving and cadging with\r\nbad companions. He had been doing that for the last five years; and if\r\nhe could get out of it he would be very glad to leave it [cheers].\r\n\r\nThe fourth lad (who was received with loud cheering, evidently\r\nindicating that he was a well-known character) said, he came from the\r\ncity of York, and was a farrier. His father died a few years ago, and\r\nthen he took to work; but “the play” led him on to be a thief, and\r\nfrom that time to the present he had done nothing but beg or thieve.\r\nIf he could go to Australia he would be very glad; as if he stopped in\r\nEngland he feared he should do nothing but thieve to the end [laughter,\r\nwith cries of “well done,” “very well spoken”].\r\n\r\nThe next speaker was about 18 years of age, and appeared a very sharp\r\nintelligent lad. After making a very grave but irresistibly comical\r\nprefatory bow, by placing his hand at the back of his head, and so\r\n(as it were) forcing it to give a nod, he proceeded: My father is an\r\nengineer’s labourer, and the first cause of my thieving was that he\r\nkept me without grub, and wallopped me [laughter]. Well, I was at\r\nwork at the same time that he was, and I kept pilfering, and at last\r\nthey bowled me out [loud cheers]. I got a showing up, and at last\r\nthey turned me away; and, not liking to go home to my father, I ran\r\naway. I went to Margate, where I had some friends, with a shilling\r\nin my pocket. I never stopped till I got to Ramsgate, and I had no\r\nlodging except under the trees, and had only the bits of bread I could\r\npick up. When I got there my grandfather took me in and kept me for a\r\ntwelvemonth. My mother’s brother’s wife had a spite against me, and\r\ntried to get me turned away. I did not know what thieving was then; and\r\nI used to pray that her heart might be turned, because I did not know\r\nwhat would become of me if my grandfather turned me away. But she got\r\nother people to complain of me, and say I was a nuisance to the town;\r\nbut I knowed there was no fault in me; but, however, my grandfather\r\nsaid he could put up with me no longer, and turned me away. So after\r\nthat I came back to London, and goes to the union. The first night I\r\nwent there I got tore up [cheers and laughter]. Everything was torn\r\noff my back, and the bread was taken away from me, and because I said\r\na word I got well wallopped [renewed laughter]. They “small-ganged”\r\nme; and afterwards I went seven days to prison because others tore my\r\nclothes. When I went in there--this was the first time--a man said to\r\nme, “What are you here for?” I said, “For tearing up.” The man said\r\nto another, “What are you here for?” and the other made answer, “For\r\na handkerchief.” The man then said, “Ah, that’s something like;” and\r\nhe said to me, “Why are you not a thief--you will only get to prison\r\nfor that.” I said, “I will.” Well, after that I went pilfering small\r\nthings, worth a penny or twopence at first; but I soon saw better\r\nthings were as easy to be got as them, so I took them [laughter]. I\r\npicked up with one that knowed more than me. He fairly kept me for\r\nsome time, and I learnt as well as him. I picked him up in a London\r\nworkhouse. After that I thought I would try my friends again, and I\r\nwent to my uncle at Dover, but he could do nothing for me, so I got\r\na place at a butcher’s, where I fancied myself fairly blessed, for I\r\nhad 2_s._ a week and my board and washing. I kept a twelvemonth there\r\nhonest, without thieving. At last my master and I fell out and I left\r\nagain, so I was forced to come up to London, and there I found my old\r\ncompanions in the Smithfield pens--they were not living anywhere. I\r\nused to go to the workhouse and used to tear up and refuse to work,\r\nand used to get sent to “quod,” and I used to curse the day when it\r\nwas my turn to go out. The governor of the prison used to say he hoped\r\nhe wouldn’t see my face there again; but I used to answer, “I shall be\r\nhere again to night, because it’s the only place I’ve got.” That’s all\r\nI’ve got to say.\r\n\r\nThe next lad, who said he had been fourteen times in prison, was a\r\ntaller, cleaner, and more intelligent-looking youth than any that had\r\npreceded him. After making a low affected bow, over the railing, to the\r\ncompany below, and uttering a preliminary a-hem or two with the most\r\nludicrous mock gravity, he began by saying:--“I am a native of London.\r\nMy father is a poor labouring man, with 15_s._ a week--little enough, I\r\nthink, to keep a home for four, and find candlelight [laughter]. I was\r\nat work looking after a boiler at a paper-stainer’s in Old-street-road\r\nat 6_s._ a week, when one night they bowled me out. I got the sack, and\r\na bag to take it home in [laughter]. I got my wages, and ran away from\r\nhome, but in four days, being hungry, and having no money, I went back\r\nagain. I got a towelling, but it did not do me much good. My father\r\ndid not like to turn me out of doors, so he tied me to the leg of the\r\nbedstead [laughter]. He tied my hands and feet so that I could hardly\r\nmove, but I managed somehow to turn my gob (mouth) round and gnawed\r\nit away. I run down stairs and got out at the back door and over a\r\nneighbour’s wall, and never went home for nine months. I never bolted\r\nwith anything. I never took anything that was too hot for me. The\r\ncaptain of a man-of-war about this time took me into his service, where\r\nI remained five weeks till I took a fever, and was obliged to go to the\r\nhospital. When I recovered, the captain was gone to Africa; and not\r\nliking to go home, I stepped away, and have been from home ever since.\r\nI was in Brummagem, and was seven days in the new ‘stir’ (prison), and\r\nnearly broke my neck. When I came out, I fell into bad company, and\r\nwent cadging, and have been cadging ever since; but if I could leave\r\noff, and go to the Isle of Dogs, the Isle of Man, or the Isle of Woman\r\n[laughter], or any other foreign place, I would embrace the opportunity\r\nas soon as I could. And if so be that any gentleman would take me in\r\nhand, and send me out, I would be very thankful to him, indeed. And so\r\ngood night” [cheers].\r\n\r\nA dirty little boy, fourteen years of age, dressed in a big jacket,\r\nnext stood forward. He said his father was a man-of-war’s man, and when\r\nhe came home from sea once his father, his mother, and all of them got\r\ndrunk. The lad then stole 4_d._ from his father’s pocket. After this,\r\nwhen he was sent for sixpenny rum he used to fetch fourpenny, and for\r\nfourpenny gin threepenny; and for fourpenny beer he used to fetch\r\nthreepenny, and keep the difference to himself. His mother used to sell\r\nfruit, and when she left him at the stall he used to eat what he could\r\nnot sell, and used to sell some to get marbles and buttons. Once he\r\nstole a loaf from a baker’s shop. The man let him off, but his father\r\nbeat him for it. The beating did him no good. After that he used to go\r\n“smugging” [running away with] other people’s things. Then one day his\r\nfather caught him, and tied his leg to the bedstead, and left him there\r\ntill he was pretty near dead. He ran away afterwards, and has been\r\nthieving ever since.\r\n\r\nA lad about twenty was here about to volunteer a statement concerning\r\nthe lodging-houses, by which he declared he had been brought to his\r\nruin, but he was instantly assailed with cries of “come down!” “hold\r\nyour tongue!” and these became so general, and were in so menacing a\r\ntone, that he said he was afraid to make any disclosures, because he\r\nbelieved if he did so he would have perhaps two or three dozen of the\r\nother chaps on to him [great confusion].\r\n\r\nMR. MAYHEW: Will it hurt any of you here if he says anything against\r\nthe lodging-houses [yes, yes]? How will it do so?\r\n\r\nA Voice: They will not allow stolen property to come into them if it is\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYHEW: But would you not all gladly quit your present course of\r\nlife [yes, yes, yes]? Then why not have the lodging-house system, the\r\nprincipal cause of all your misery, exposed?\r\n\r\nA Voice: If they shut up the lodging-houses, where are we to go? If a\r\npoor boy gets to the workhouse he catches a fever, and is starved into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYHEW:--Are not you all tired of the lives you now lead?\r\n[Vociferous cries of “yes, yes, we wish to better ourselves!” from\r\nall parts of the room.] However much you dread the exposure of the\r\nlodging-houses, you know, my lads, as well as I do, that it is in them\r\nyou meet your companions, and ruin, if not begun there, is at least\r\ncompleted in such places. If a boy runs away from home he is encouraged\r\nthere and kept secreted from his parents. And do not the parties who\r\nkeep these places grow rich on your degradation and your peril? [Loud\r\ncries of “yes, yes!”] Then why don’t you all come forward now, and, by\r\nexposing them to the public, who know nothing of the iniquities and\r\nvice practised in such places, put an end to these dens at once? There\r\nis not one of you here--not one, at least, of the elder boys, who has\r\nfound out the mistake of his present life, who would not, I verily\r\nbelieve, become honest, and earn his living by his industry, if he\r\ncould. You might have thought a roving life a pleasant thing enough at\r\nfirst, but you now know that a vagabond’s life is full of suffering,\r\ncare, peril, and privation; you are not so happy as you thought you\r\nwould be, and are tired and disgusted with your present course. This\r\nis what I hear from you all. Am I not stating the fact? [Renewed cries\r\nof “yes, yes, yes!” and a voice: “The fact of it is, sir, we don’t see\r\nour folly till it is too late.”] Now I and many hundreds and thousands\r\nreally wish you well, and would gladly do anything we could to get you\r\nto earn an honest living. All, or nearly all, your misery, I know,\r\nproceeds from the low lodging-houses [“yes, yes, it does, master! it\r\ndoes”]; and I am determined, with your help, to effect their utter\r\ndestruction. [A voice, “I am glad of it, sir--you are quite right; and\r\nI pray God to assist you.”]\r\n\r\nThe elder boys were then asked what they thought would be the best mode\r\nof effecting their deliverance from their present degraded position.\r\nSome thought emigration the best means, for if they started afresh\r\nin a new colony, they said they would leave behind them their bad\r\ncharacters, which closed every avenue to employment against them at\r\nhome. Others thought there would be difficulties in obtaining work\r\nin the colonies in sufficient time to prevent their being driven to\r\nsupport themselves by their old practices. Many again thought the\r\ntemptations which surrounded them in England rendered their reformation\r\nimpossible; whilst many more considered that the same temptations would\r\nassail them abroad which existed at home.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYHEW then addressed them on another point. He said he had seen\r\nmany notorious thieves in the course of his investigations. Since then\r\nhe had received them at all hours into his house--men of the most\r\ndesperate and women of the most abandoned characters--but he had never\r\nlost a 6_d._ worth of his property by them. One thief he had entrusted\r\nwith a sovereign to get changed, and the lad returned and gave him\r\nback the full amount in silver. He had since gone out to America. Now\r\nhe would ask all those present whether, if he were to give them a\r\nsovereign, they would do the same? [Several voices here called out that\r\nthey would, and others that they would not. Others, again, said that\r\nthey would to him, but to no one else.]\r\n\r\nHere one of the most desperate characters present, a boy who had been\r\ntwenty-six times in prison, was singled out from the rest, and a\r\nsovereign given to him to get changed, in order to make the experiment\r\nwhether he would have the honesty to return the change or abscond with\r\nit in his possession. He was informed, on receiving it, that if he\r\nchose to decamp with it, no proceedings should be taken against him. He\r\nleft the room amid the cheers of his companions, and when he had been\r\nabsent a few moments all eyes were turned towards the door each time it\r\nopened, anxiously expecting his arrival, to prove his trustworthiness.\r\nNever was such interest displayed by any body of individuals. They\r\nmounted the forms in their eagerness to obtain the first glimpse of\r\nhis return. It was clear that their honour was at stake; and several\r\nsaid they would kill the lad in the morning if he made off with the\r\nmoney. Many minutes elapsed in almost painful suspense, and some of his\r\ncompanions began to fear that so large a sum of money had proved too\r\ngreat a temptation for the boy. At last, however, a tremendous burst\r\nof cheering announced the lad’s return. The delight of his companions\r\nbroke forth again and again, in long and loud peals of applause, and\r\nthe youth advanced amidst triumphant shouts to the platform, and gave\r\nup the money in full.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage was then interrogated as to the effect of flogging as a\r\npunishment; and the general feeling appeared to be that it hardened the\r\ncriminal instead of checking his depravity, and excited the deadliest\r\nenmity in his bosom at the time towards the person inflicting it. When\r\nasked whether they had seen any public executions, they almost all\r\ncried out that they had seen Manning and his wife hung; others said\r\nthat they had seen Rush and Sarah Thomas executed. They stated that\r\nthey liked to go a “death-hunting,” after seeing one or two executed.\r\nIt hardened them to it, and at last they all got to thieve under the\r\ngallows. They felt rather shocked at the sight of an execution at\r\nfirst; but, after a few repetitions, it soon wore off.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting broke up several other lads expressed a strong\r\ndesire to make statements.\r\n\r\nA young man, 18 years of age, and of a miserable and ragged appearance,\r\nsaid he first left home from bad usage; and could not say whether\r\nit was the same with his sister or not, but she left her home about\r\nnine months ago, when he met her while he was getting his living as a\r\ncostermonger. With the stock-money that he had, rather than she should\r\nbe driven to prostitution and the streets, he bought as many things\r\nas he could to furnish a room. This exhausted his stock-money, and\r\nthen his furniture had to go a little at a time to support him and his\r\nsister in food. After this he was obliged to take a furnished room,\r\nwhich put him to greater expense. To keep her off the streets, he\r\nwas compelled to thieve. His father, if he ever had the feeling of a\r\nChristian, would never have treated him as he had done. Could a father\r\n(he asked) have any feeling, who chained his son up by the leg in a\r\nshed, as _his_ father had done to him, and fed him on bread and water\r\nfor one entire month: and then, after chaining him up all day, still\r\nchain him in bed at night. This it was that drove him into the streets\r\nat first. It was after his mother died, and he had a step-mother, that\r\nhis father treated him thus. His mother-in-law ill-treated him as\r\nwell as his father. If he had been a transport he could not have been\r\ntreated worse. He told his father that he was driving him on the road\r\nto transportation, but he took no notice of it; and he was obliged to\r\nleave his roof. He had been in Newgate since.\r\n\r\nA little boy, dressed in the garb of a sailor, came up to Mr. Mayhew\r\ncrying bitterly, and implored him to allow him to say a word. He\r\nstated--I am here starving all my time. Last night I was out in the\r\ncold and nearly froze to death. When I got up I was quite stiff and\r\ncould hardly walk. I slept in Whitechapel under a form where they sell\r\nmeat. I was an apprentice on board of a fishing smack, and ran away\r\nbecause I was ill-treated. After I ran away I broke into my master’s\r\nhouse because I was hungry. He gave me twelve months, and now he is in\r\nthe union himself; he failed in business and got broken up. I have been\r\nout of prison three months, starving; and I would rather do anything\r\nthan thieve. If I see a little thing I take it, because I can’t get\r\nanything to eat without it. [Here the child, still weeping piteously,\r\nuncovered his breast, and showed his bones starting through his skin.\r\nHe said he was anxious to get out of the country.]\r\n\r\nThe following statement respecting the lodging-houses was made, after\r\nthe others had left, by another lad. He left home when about thirteen,\r\nand never thieved before that. His father was dead, and his mother was\r\nunable to keep him. He got a situation and held it for three years and\r\nnine months, until he picked up with a man from a lodging-house, and\r\nthrough keeping late hours he was obliged to leave his place and sleep\r\nin a lodging-house himself. The lodging-house is in Short’s-gardens.\r\nThis he considered to have been the commencement of his downfall. About\r\nforty thieves lived in the house, and they brought in stolen property\r\nof every description, and the deputies received it and took it to other\r\npeople to sell it again, and get the price and pay the thieves. They\r\ngot double as much as the thieves did, or else they would have nothing\r\nto do with it. Several housebreakers lived at the house, and he heard\r\nthem there plan the robbery of Bull and Wilson, the woollen-drapers in\r\nSt. Martin’s-lane. One of the men secreted himself in the house in the\r\ndaytime, and the other two were admitted by him at night. If he had\r\nstated this at the meeting the persons present would have killed him.\r\nHe was sure that more might be done by giving proper encouragement to\r\nvirtue, and by reforming the criminal, than by rigorous prosecution. He\r\nsaid (with tears in his eyes) that he should be very willing and happy\r\nto work for an honest living if he could only get it to do. He showed\r\na letter of recommendation for good conduct to his former master, and\r\na Bible; both of which had been given him by the chaplain of the gaol\r\nwhich he had just left, after undergoing an imprisonment of twelve\r\nmonths. It was useless (he said) for a young man like him to apply to\r\nthe parish for relief; he might just as well stand in the street and\r\ntalk to a lamp-post. Then what was a man to do after he left prison?\r\nHe must go a thieving to live. He was persuaded that if there was an\r\ninstitution to give employment to the homeless, the friendless, and the\r\npenniless, after being liberated from prison, it would be the means of\r\nrescuing thousands.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings then terminated. The assemblage, which had become more\r\nrational and manageable towards the close, dispersed, quite peaceably\r\nit should be added, and the boys were evidently sincerely grateful for\r\nthe efforts being made to bring their misfortunes before the notice of\r\nthose in whose power it may be to alleviate them.\r\n\r\nBefore they were dismissed, as much money was dispensed to each as\r\nwould defray his night’s lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COUNTRY LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nConcerning the lodging-houses, more especially in the country, I give\r\nthe statement of a middle-aged man, familiar with them for twenty\r\nyears. He was recommended to me as possessed of much humour and a great\r\nmaster of humourous slang:--\r\n\r\n“I can tell you all about it, sir; but one lodging-house is so like\r\nanother that I can’t draw much distinction. In small country towns,\r\nespecially agricultural towns, they are decent places enough, regular\r\nin their hours, and tidy enough. At these places they have what they\r\ncall ‘their own travellers,’ persons that they know, and who are always\r\naccommodated in preference. As to the characters that frequent these\r\nplaces, let us begin with _the Crocusses_. They carry about a lot of\r\nworms in bottles, what they never took out of anybody, though they’ll\r\ntell you different, or long pieces of tape in bottles, made to look\r\nlike worms, and on that they’ll _patter_ in a market place as if on\r\na real cure, and they’ve got the cheek to tell the people that that\r\nvery worm was taken from Lady ----, near the town, and referring them\r\nto her to prove it. The one I knew best would commence with a piece\r\nof sponge in a bottle, which he styled the stomach wolf. That was his\r\nleading slum, and pretty well he sponged them too. When he’d pattered\r\non about the wolf, he had another bottle with what he called a worm\r\n200 inches long, he bounced it was, which the day before yesterday\r\nhe had from Mrs. ----’s girl (some well-known person), and referred\r\nthem to her. While he’s going on, a brother Crocus will step up, a\r\nstranger to the people, and say, ‘Ah, Doctor ----, you’re right. I had\r\nthe pleasure of dining with Mr. ---- when the worm was extracted, and\r\nnever saw a child so altered in my life.’ That’s what the Crocus’s\r\ncall giving a jolly; and after that don’t the first Crocus’s old woman\r\nserve out the six-pennyworths? The stuff is to cure every mortal thing\r\na man can ail--ay, or a woman either. They’d actually have the cheek\r\nto put a blister on a cork leg. Well, when they’re done pattering on\r\nthe worm racket, then come the wonderful pills. Them are the things.\r\nThese pills, from eight to a dozen in a box, are charged 4_d._ to 6_d._\r\naccording to the flat’s appearance--as the Crocus call his customers.\r\nThe pills meet with a ready sale, and they’re like chip in porridge,\r\nneither good nor harm. It’s chiefly the bounciful patter, the cheek\r\nthey have, that gets them Crocusses on. It’s amazing. They’ll stare a\r\nfellow in the face, and make him believe he’s ill whether he is or no.\r\nThe man I speak of is a first-rate cove; he trains it and coaches it\r\nfrom market to market like any gentleman. He wears a stunning fawny\r\n(ring) on his finger, an out-and-out watch and guard, and not a duffer\r\nneither--no gammon; and a slap-up suit of black togs. I’ve seen the\r\nswell bosmen (farmers) buy the pills to give the people standing about,\r\njust to hear the Crocus patter. Why they’ve got the cheek to pitch\r\ntheir stall with their worms opposite a regular medical man’s shop, and\r\nsay, ‘Go over the way and see what he’ll do--he’ll drive up in a horse\r\nand gig to your door, and make you pay for it too; but I don’t--I’ve\r\nwalked here to do you good, and I _will_ do you good before I leave\r\nyou. One trial is all I ask’--and quite enough too (said my informant).\r\nI’ll warrant they won’t come a second time; if they do, it’s with a\r\nstick in their hands. If he does much business in the worm-powder way\r\n(some have it in cakes for children), the Crocus never gives them a\r\nchance to catch him. But if it’s only pills, he’ll show next market\r\nday, or a month after, and won’t he crack about it then? He says, ‘One\r\ntrial is all I ask,’ and one of them got it and was transported. I knew\r\none of these Crocusses who was once so hard up from lushing and boozing\r\nabout that he went into a field and collected sheep dung and floured\r\nit over, and made his pills of it, and made the people swallow it at\r\nLutterworth market, in Leicestershire; because there they’ll swallow\r\nanything. If the Crocus I have mentioned see this in the paper--as he\r\nwill, for he’s a reading-man--won’t he come out bouncefull? He’ll say,\r\n‘Why am I thus attacked--why don’t the proprietor and the editor of\r\nthis paper come forward--if he’s among you? Who made this report? let\r\nhim come forward, and I’ll refute him face to face.’ And no doubt (my\r\ninformant remarked), he’d give him a tidy dose, too, the Crocus would.\r\nFor myself, I’d far rather meet him face to face than his medicine,\r\neither his blue or his pink water. There’s another sort who carry on\r\nthe crocussing business, but on a small scale; they’re on the penny\r\nand twopenny racket, and are called hedge crocusses--men who sell corn\r\nsalve, or ‘four pills a penny,’ to cure anything, and go from house\r\nto house in the country. But as the hedge crocus is shickery togged,\r\nhe makes poorly out. Respectable people won’t listen to him, and it’s\r\ngenerally the lower order that he gulls. These hedge fellows are slow\r\nand dull; they go mouching along as if they were croaking themselves.\r\nI’ve seen the head crocus I’ve mentioned at four markets in one week,\r\nand a town on a Saturday night, clear from 5_l._ to 7_l._--all clear\r\nprofit, for his fakement costs him little or nothing. For such a\r\nman’s pound, the hedge fellow may make 1_s._ The next I’ll tell you\r\nabout is durynacking, or duryking. The gipsies (and they’re called\r\nRomanies) are the leading mob at this racket, but they’re well known,\r\nand I needn’t say anything about those ladies. But there’re plenty of\r\ntravelling women who go about with a basket and a bit of driss (lace)\r\nin it, gammy lace, for a stall-off (a blind), in case they meet the\r\nmaster, who would order them off. Up at a bosken (farm-house) they’ll\r\nget among the servant girls, being pretty well acquainted with the\r\nneighbourhood by inquiries on the road, as to the number of daughters\r\nand female servants. The first inquiry is for the missus or a daughter,\r\nand if they can’t be got at they’re on to the slaveys. Suppose they do\r\nget hold of one of the daughters, they commence by offering the driss,\r\nwhich, as it is queer stuff, wouldn’t be picked up by an agricultural\r\nyoung lady, as the durynacker very well knows. Then she begins, ‘Ah!\r\nmy sweet young lady, my blessed looking angel’--if she’s as ugly as\r\nsin, and forty; they say that, and that’s the time you get them to\r\nrights, when they’re old and ugly, just by sweetening them, and then\r\nthey don’t mind tipping the loaver (money)--‘I know you dont want this\r\nstuff (she’ll continue), there’s something on your mind. I see you’re\r\nin love; but the dear handsome gentleman--he’ll not slight you, but\r\nloves you as hard as a hammer.’ This is thrown out as a feeler, and\r\nthe young lady is sure to be confused; then the durrynacker has hold\r\nof her mauly (hand) in a minute. It’s all up with the girl, once the\r\nwoman gets a grip. She’s asked in directly, and of course the sisters\r\n(if she has any) and the slavey are let into the secret, and all have\r\ntheir fortunes told. The fortune-teller may make a week’s job of it,\r\naccording as the loaver comes out. She’ll come away with her basket\r\nfull of eggs, bacon, butter, tea and sugar, and all sorts of things. I\r\n_have_ seen them bring the scran in! Every one is sure to have handsome\r\nhusbands, thumping luck, and pretty children. The durrynacker, too,\r\nis not particular, if there’s a couple of silver spoons--she doesn’t\r\nlike odd ones; and mind you, she alway carries a basket--big enough\r\ntoo. I know a man on this lurk, but he works the article with a small\r\nglass globe filled full of water, and in that he shows girls their\r\nfuture husbands, and kids them on to believe they do see them--ay,\r\nand the church they’re to be married in--and they fancy they do see\r\nit as they twist the globe this way and that, while he twists the tin\r\nout of them, and no flies. He actually had the cheek, though he knew\r\nI was fly to every fake, to try to make me believe that I could see\r\nthe place where Smith O’Brien had the fight in Ireland! ‘Don’t you\r\nsee them cabbages, and a tall man in a green velvet cap among them,\r\nholloring out, “I’m the King of Munster?”’ I don’t know any other male\r\ndurrynacker worth noticing; the women have all the call. Young women\r\nwon’t ask their fortunes of men. The way the globe man does is to\r\ngo among the old women and fiddle (humbug) them, and, upon my word,\r\nthree-parts of them are worse than the young ones. Now I’ll tell you\r\nabout the tat (rag) gatherers; buying rags they call it, but I call\r\nit bouncing people. Two men I lodged with once, one morning hadn’t\r\na farthing, regularly smashed up, not a feather to fly with, they’d\r\nknocked down all their tin lushing. Well, they didn’t know what to be\r\nup to, till one hit upon a scheme. ‘I’ve got it, Joe,’ says he. He\r\nborrows two blue plates from the lodging-house keeper, a washing jug\r\nand basin. Off they goes, one with the crockery, and the other with a\r\nbag. They goes into the by-courts in Windsor, because this bouncing\r\ncaper wouldn’t do in the main drag. Up goes the fellow with a bag, and\r\nhollas out, ‘Now, women, bring out your copper, brass, white rags, old\r\nflannel, bed-sacking, old ropes, empty bottles, umbrellas--any mortal\r\nthing--the best price is given;’ and the word’s hardly out, when up\r\ncomes his pal, hollaring, ‘Sam, holloa! stop that horse,’ as if he’d a\r\nhorse and cart passing the court, and then the women bring out their\r\numbrellas and things, and they’re all to be exchanged for crockery such\r\nas he shows, and all goes into the bag, and the bagman goes off with\r\nthe things, leaving the other to do the bounce, and he keeps singing\r\nout for the horse and cart with the load of crockery, gammoning there\r\nis one, that the ladies may have their choice, and he then hurries down\r\nto quicken his cart-driver’s movements, and hooks it, leaving the flats\r\ncompletely stunned. Oh! it does give them a ferry-cadouzer. Two other\r\nmen go about on this lurk, one with an old cracked plate under his\r\nwaistcoat, and the other with a bag. And one sings out, ‘Now, women,\r\nfourpence a pound for your white rags. None of your truck system, your\r\nneedles and thread for it. I don’t do it that way; ready money, women,\r\nis the order of the day with me.’ Well, one old mollesher (woman),\r\nthough she must have known her rags would only bring 2_d._ a lb. at a\r\nfair dealer’s, if there be one, brought out 8 lbs. of white rags. He\r\nweighs them with his steelyards, and in they went to the bag. The man\r\nwith the bag steps it immediately, and the other whips out his flute\r\nquite carelessly, and says--‘Which will you have marm, Jem Crow, or\r\nthe Bunch of Roses?’ The old woman says directly, ‘What do you mean,\r\n8 times 4 is 32, and 32 pence is 2_s._ 8_d._; never mind, I won’t be\r\nhard, give me half-a-crown.’ Well, when she finds there’s no money,\r\nout she hollars, and he plays his distracted flute to drown her voice,\r\nand backs himself manfully out of the court. I have known these men\r\nget on so that I have seen them with a good horse and cart. There’s\r\nanother class of rag bloaks, who have bills printed with the Queen’s\r\nArms at the top, if you please, ‘By royal authority’--that’s their own\r\nauthority, and they assume plenty of it. Well, this bill specifies the\r\nbest prices for rags, left-off clothes, &c. One fellow goes and drops\r\nthese bills at the kens (houses), the other comes after him, and as the\r\nman who drops marks every house where a bill has been taken, the second\r\nman knows where to call. Any house where he gets a call commences the\r\ncaper. Well, anything to be disposed of is brought out, often in the\r\nback yard. The party of the house produces the bill, which promises a\r\nstunning tip for the old lumber. The man keeps sorting the things out,\r\nand running them down as not so good as he expected; but at the same\r\ntime he kids them on by promising three times more than the things are\r\nworth. This is a grand racket--the way he fakes them, and then he says,\r\n‘Marm (or sir, as it may be), I shall give you 15_s._ for the lot,’\r\nwhich stuns the party, for they never expected to get anything like\r\nthat--and their expectations is not disappointed, for they don’t. Then\r\nhe turns round directly, and commences sorting more particularly than\r\nbefore, putting the best and the easiest to carry altogether. He starts\r\nup then, and whips a couple of bob, or half a bull (2_s._ 6_d._) into\r\nthe woman’s hand, saying, ‘I always like to bind a bargain, marm--one\r\nof the fairest dealing men travelling. Do save all your old lumber for\r\nme.’ Of a sudden he begins searching his pockets, and exclaims, ‘Dear\r\nme, I haven’t enough change in my pocket, but I’ll soon settle that--my\r\nmate has it outside. I’ll just take a load out to the cart, and come\r\nback for the others with the money;’ and so he hooks it, and I’ve no\r\noccasion to tell you he never comes back; and that’s what he calls\r\nhaving them on the knock.”\r\n\r\nThe other inmates at the lodging-houses which my informant described\r\nare of the class concerning whom full information is or will be given\r\nin other portions of this or the following letters. His description of\r\nthe lodging-houses, too, was a corroboration of the statement I give\r\nto-day. All the classes described meet and mix at the lodging-houses.\r\n\r\nI shall reserve what I have to say concerning the influence of the low\r\nlodging-houses of London and the country till the conclusion of the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CHEMICAL ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\nThe street purveyors of blacking, of the different preparations of\r\nblack lead, of plating-balls, of corn-salves, of grease-removing\r\ncompositions, of china and glass cements, of rat poisons,\r\nof fly-papers, of beetle-wafers, of gutta-percha heads, of\r\nlucifer-matches, and of cigar-lights, may be classed generally under\r\ntwo heads. They are either very old or very young persons, or else they\r\nare men who recommend their wares by patter.\r\n\r\nAmong the first-mentioned class are the vendors of cakes of blacking,\r\npapers of black-lead, and lucifer matches. Of blacking and black-lead\r\nthe street-sellers are more frequently old women; of lucifer matches\r\nthey are usually women and children, and of all ages. It is not\r\nuncommon, in the quieter roads of the suburbs especially, to see a\r\nyoung woman extend her bare red arm from beneath a scanty ragged shawl,\r\nand with an imploring look, a low curtsey, and a piteous tone, proffer\r\na box of matches for sale; while a child in her arms, perhaps of two\r\nor three years old, extends in its little hand another box. There are\r\nalso in the street sale of lucifer matches very many girls and boys,\r\nparentless or uncared for, and many old or infirm women and men.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of chemically-manufactured articles, who feel it\r\nnecessary to recommend their wares by a little street oratory, or\r\npatter, (the paper-worker, whose humorous remarks I have before quoted,\r\nonce described it to me as “advertising by word of mouth,”) are the\r\nvendors of the articles which are to cure, to repair, to renovate, or\r\nto kill. Any other itinerant vendors of chemical articles are of the\r\nordinary class of street traders.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BLACKING, BLACK LEAD, ETC.\r\n\r\nI specify these two commodities jointly, because they are frequently\r\nsold by the same individual. In Whitechapel and Spitalfields are eight\r\nestablishments, where the street-sellers of blacking are principally\r\nsupplied with their stock. It is sold in cakes, which are wrapped in a\r\nkind of oil paper, generally printed on the back, so as to catch the\r\neye, with the address of some well-known blacking manufacturer. Thus\r\nsome which a street-seller of blacking showed me were printed, in large\r\ntype, as a sort of border, “Lewis’s India Rubber Blacking,” while in\r\nthe middle was a very black and very predominant 30, and beneath it, in\r\nsmall and hardly distinguishable type, “Princess-st., Portman-market.”\r\nAny shopkeeper, who “supplies the trade,” if he be a regular customer\r\nof the manufacturer, can have his name and address printed on the\r\ncover of the blacking-cakes. The 30 is meant to catch the eye with the\r\nwell-known flourish of “30, Strand.”\r\n\r\nThe quality of these cakes of blacking, the street-sellers whom I\r\nquestioned told me was highly approved by their customers, and, as\r\nblacking is purchased by the classes who aim at a smartness and\r\ncleanliness above that of the purchasers of many street commodities,\r\nthere is no reason to doubt the assertion. The sale of this blacking,\r\nindeed, is chiefly on a round, and it would be hopeless as to future\r\ncustom to call a second time at any house where bad blacking had been\r\nsold on a previous visit. The article is vended wholesale, in “gross\r\nboxes,” and “half-gross boxes.” The half-gross boxes are 1_s._ 9_d._,\r\nand capital, even in this trifling trade, has its customary advantages,\r\nfor the “gross boxes” are but 3_s._ It should be remembered, however,\r\nthat to the buyer of two “half-gross” a couple of the plain wooden\r\nboxes, in which the blacking is sold, and often hawked, must be\r\nsupplied; but to the buyer of a “gross box” only one of these cases is\r\nfurnished. I may mention, to the credit of the vendors, that of the\r\nwholesale blacking makers, two have themselves been street-sellers,\r\nand one still, but only at intervals, goes “on a blacking-round” among\r\nhis old customers. There are other blacking-makers, but those I have\r\nspecified, as to number, are more particularly the providers for the\r\nstreet trade. The poor people who sell blacking at a distance from\r\nthe manufacturer’s premises--as in the case of the “30, Princess-st.,\r\nPortman-market”--are supplied by oilmen, chandlers, and other\r\nshopkeepers, who buy largely of the manufacturers, and can consequently\r\nsupply the purchasers by the dozen, for street sale or hawking, as\r\ncheaply as they would be supplied by the manufacturer himself. A dozen\r\nis generally charged 3-1/2_d._, and as the cakes are sold at 1/2_d._\r\neach (occasionally 1_d._, both by the street people and more frequently\r\nthe small shopkeepers) the profit is moderate enough. The cakes,\r\nhowever, which are regularly retailed at 1_d._, are larger, and cost\r\nnearly twice the amount of the others wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis trade presents the peculiarity of being almost entirely a street\r\n“door-to-door” trade, as I heard it described. Blacking is not\r\npresented for purposes of begging, as are lucifer-matches, tracts,\r\nmemorandum-books, boot-laces, &c.; for the half-trading, half-begging,\r\nis carried on in the quieter parts of town, and more extensively in the\r\nsuburbs, ladies being principally accosted, and to them blacking is not\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThere are now, I learn from good authority, never fewer than 200\r\npersons selling cake blacking, “from door to door.” More than half\r\nof them are elderly women, and more than three-fourths women of all\r\nages and girls. The other sellers are old men and boys. None of the\r\nblacking-sellers make the article they vend. To sell eight dozen\r\ncakes a week is a full average, and of these the “pennies” and the\r\n“half-pennies” are about equally divided. This gives a weekly outlay of\r\n6_s._ to each individual seller, with an average profit of about 2_s._\r\n6_d._, and shows a yearly street-expenditure by the public of 3120_l._\r\nThe profit, however, is not in equal apportionment among the traders\r\nin blacking, for the “old hands” on a regular round will do double the\r\nbusiness of the others.\r\n\r\nIn liquid blacking the trade is now small. It is occasionally sold\r\nin the street markets on Saturday nights, but the principal traffic\r\nis in the public-houses. This kind of blacking is retailed at 2_d._\r\na bottle, and, I was informed by a man who had sold it, was “rather\r\nqueer stuff.” It is labelled “equal to” (in very small letters) “DAY\r\nAND MARTIN” in very large letters. One of the manufacturers a few years\r\nago told my informant that he had been threatened “with being sued\r\nfor piracy, but it was no use sueing a mouse.” There are sometimes\r\nnone, and sometimes twenty persons hawking this blacking, and they are\r\nprincipally, I am informed, the servants of showmen, “out of employ,”\r\nor “down on their luck.” Some of these men “raffle” their blacking in\r\npublic-houses. They are provided with tickets, numbered from one to\r\nsix, which are thrown, the blank sides upwards on a table, and the\r\ndrawer of number six wins a two-penny bottle of blacking for 1/2_d._;\r\nfor this the raffler receives 3_d._ Few of these traders sell more than\r\none dozen bottles in a day, the principal trade being in the evening,\r\nand “one-and-a-half dozen is a very good day.” The goods are carried\r\nin a sack, slung from the shoulder, and are a very heavy carriage, as\r\ntwo-and-a-half dozen, which are often carried, weigh about 100 lbs.\r\nIf ten men, the year through, take each 6_s._ weekly (about half the\r\namount being profit), which, I am assured, is the average extent of\r\nthe trade, we find 156_l._ yearly expended in this liquid blacking.\r\n“Ten years ago,” said one blacking seller to me, “it was three times\r\nas much as it is now.” At the mews blacking is sold by men who are for\r\nthe most part servants out of place, or who have become known to the\r\ndenizens of the mews, from having been “helpers” in some capacity, if\r\nthey have not worn a livery. Here the article vended is what it is\r\nannounced to be,--“Hoby’s” or “Everett’s” blacking. The sellers are\r\nknown to the coachmen and grooms, many of whom have to “find their own\r\nblacking,” or there would be no business done in the mews, the dwellers\r\nthere being great sticklers for “a good article.” The profit to the\r\nvendors is 3_s._ in 12_s._ Shilling bottles are vended as numerously\r\nas “sixpennies.” An old coachman, who had lived in mews in all parts\r\nof town, calculated that, take the year through, there was every day\r\ntwenty men selling blacking in the mews, with an average profit of\r\n10_d._ a day, or 5s. a week, so taking 15_s._ each. This gives a mews\r\nexpenditure, yearly, of 780_l._\r\n\r\n_Black-Lead_, for the polishing of grates, is sold in small paper\r\npackets, the half ounce being a 1/2_d._, and the ounce a 1_d._ The\r\nprofit is cent. per cent. Nearly all the women who sell blacking, as\r\nI have described, sell black-lead also. In addition to these elderly\r\ntraders, however, there are from twenty to thirty boys and girls who\r\nvend black-lead in the street markets, but chiefly on Saturday nights,\r\nand on other days offer it through the area rails--their wretched\r\nplight, without any actual begging, occasionally procuring them custom.\r\n\r\nThe black-lead sold in the streets has often a label in imitation of\r\nthat of established shop-keepers, as “Superfine Pencil Black-Lead,\r\nprepared expressly for, and sold by T. H. Jennings, Oil-Colour and\r\nItalian Warehouse, 25, Wormwood-street, City.” The name and address\r\nmust of course be different, but the arrangement of the lines, and\r\noften the type, is followed closely, as are the adornments of the\r\npacket, which in the instance cited are heraldic. In other parts of\r\ntown, the labels of tradesmen are imitated in a similar way, but not\r\nvery closely; and in nearly half the quantity sold a _bonâ fide_ label\r\nis given, without imitation or sham. “There would be more sold in that\r\nway,” I was told by a sharp lad, “quite the real ticket, if the dons\r\nas wholesales the black-lead, would make it up to sell in ha’porths\r\nand penn’orths, with a proper ’lowance to us as sells.” This boy and a\r\nyoung sister went on a round; the boy with black-lead, the girl with\r\nboot-laces, in one direction, the mother going in another, and each\r\nmaking for their room at six in the evening, or as soon as “sold out.”\r\n\r\nThere are, I am informed, 100 to 150 persons selling and hawking\r\nblack-lead in the streets, and it may be estimated that they take\r\n4_s._ each weekly (the adults selling other small articles with the\r\nblack-lead); thus we find, averaging the number of sellers at 125, that\r\n1,300_l._ is yearly expended in this article, half of which sum forms\r\nthe profit of the street-folk.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FRENCH POLISH.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the French polish vended in the streets is bought\r\nat oil and varnish-shops in Bethnal-green and Whitechapel, the\r\nwholesale price being 1_s._ a pint. The street-vendors add turpentine\r\nto the polish, put it into small bottles, and retail it at 1_d._ a\r\nbottle. They thus contrive to clear 5_d._ on each shilling they take.\r\n\r\nThere are now five and sometimes six men selling French polish in the\r\nstreets and public-houses. “But the trade’s getting stale,” I was told;\r\n“there was twice as many in it three or four years back, and there’ll\r\nbe fewer still next year.” When French polish first became famous there\r\nwere, I was informed, several cabinet-makers who hawked it--some having\r\nprepared it themselves--and they would occasionally clear 5_s._ in a\r\nday. Of these street-traders there are now none, the present vendors\r\nhaving been in no way connected with the manufacture of furniture.\r\nThese men generally carry with them pieces of “fancy wood,” such as\r\nrose, or sandal wood, which they polish up in the streets to show the\r\nexcellence of the varnish. The chief purchasers are working people and\r\nsmall tradespeople, or their wives, who require trifling quantities of\r\nsuch a composition when they re-polish any small article of furniture.\r\n\r\nThe French polish-sellers, I am assured by a man familiar with the\r\nbusiness, take 2_s._ a day each, or rather in an evening, for the sales\r\nare then the most frequent: the 2_s._ leaves a profit of 10_d._ The\r\nstreet expenditure is, therefore (reckoning five regular sellers),\r\n156_l._ yearly. None of the French polish-sellers confine themselves\r\nentirely to the sale of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GREASE-REMOVING COMPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\nThe persons engaged in this trade carry it on with a regular patter.\r\nOne man’s street announcement is in the following words: “Here you have\r\na composition to remove stains from silks, muslins, bombazeens, cords,\r\nor tabarets of any kind or colour. It will never injure nor fade the\r\nfinest silk or satin, but restore it to its original colour. For grease\r\non silks, &c., only rub the composition on dry, let it remain five\r\nminutes, then take a clothes’ brush and brush it off, and it will be\r\nfound to have removed the stains. For grease in woollen cloths spread\r\nthe composition on the place with a piece of woollen cloth and cold\r\nwater; when dry rub it off, and it will remove the grease or stain.\r\nFor pitch or tar use hot water instead of cold, as that prevents the\r\nnap coming off the cloth. Here it is. Squares of grease-removing\r\ncomposition, never known to fail, only 1_d._ each.”\r\n\r\nThis street-traffic, I was informed, was far more extensively carried\r\non when silks and woollen cloths, and textile manufactures generally,\r\nwere more costly and more durable than at present, and when to dye,\r\nand scour, and “turn” a garment, was accounted good housewiveship. The\r\nsellers then told wonders of their making old silk gowns, or old coats,\r\nas good as new, by removing every discolouration, no matter from what\r\ncause. Now a silk dress is rarely, if ever, subjected to the experiment\r\nof being renovated by the virtues of grease-removing compositions\r\nsold in the streets. The trade, at present, is almost confined to the\r\nremoving of the grease from coat-collars, or of stains from contact\r\nwith paint, &c., with which boys (principally) have damaged their\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nThe grease-remover generally carries his wares on a tray slung in\r\nfront of him, and often illustrates the efficacy of his composition,\r\nby showing its application to the very greasy collar of a boy’s old\r\njacket, which is removed with admirable facility. The man patters as\r\nhe carries on this work. “You would have thought now that jacket was\r\ndone for, and only fit for the rag-bag, or to go to make up a lot for\r\na Jew; but with my composition--only 1_d._ a cake--it has acquired a\r\nnew nap and a new gloss, and you’ve escaped a tailor’s bill for awhile\r\nfor 1_d._ You can use your own eyes. You’ve seen me do it, and here’s\r\nthe very same stuff as I have proved to you is so useful and was never\r\nknown to fail. No mother, or wife, or mistress, or maid, that wishes to\r\nbe careful and not waste money, should be without it in the house. It\r\nremoves stains from silks, &c., &c.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these many recommendations, the street trade in\r\ngrease-removing cakes is a very poor one. It cannot be carried on in\r\nbad weather, for an audience cannot then be collected, and to clear\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ in a day is accounted fair work. No grease-remover confines\r\nhis trade to that commodity. One of the best known sells also plate\r\nballs, and occasionally works conundrums and comic exhibitions. The\r\ntwo brothers, who were formerly Grecians at the Blue Coat School, are\r\nalso in this line. There are now seven men who sell grease-removing\r\ncompositions, which they prepare themselves. The usual ingredients are\r\npipe clay, two pennyworth of which is beat up and “worked with two\r\ncolours,” generally red lead and stone blue. This gives the composition\r\na streaky look, and takes away the appearance of pipe clay.\r\n\r\nThe purchasers of this article are, I am told, women and servants, but\r\nthe trade is one which is declining. One of the best localities for\r\nsale is Ratcliff Highway and the purchasers there are sailors. One man\r\ntold me that he once made a pound’s worth for a sailor, who took it to\r\nsea with him. The street-seller did not know for what purpose, but he\r\nconjectured that it was as a matter of speculation to a foreign country.\r\n\r\nCalculating that the seven grease-removers carry on the sale of the\r\narticle 3 days each week, and clear 1_s._ 6_d._ per day, we find 78\r\nguineas yearly expended in the streets for the removal of grease.\r\nNearly the whole is profit.\r\n\r\n_Plating Balls_ are generally sold by the grease-removers, but\r\nsometimes they are proffered for sale alone. There are four men whose\r\nprincipal dependance is on the sale of plating balls. One announces\r\nhis wares as “making plate as good as silver, and all inferior metals\r\nequal to the best plated. No tarnish can stand against my plate balls,”\r\nhe goes on, “and if, in this respectable company, there should chance\r\nto be any lady or genl’man that has no plate, then let him make an old\r\nbrass candlestick shine like gold, or his tin candlestick, extinguisher\r\nand all, shine like silver. Here are the balls that can do it, and only\r\n4 a penny. You have only to rub the ball on your wash-leather, or dry\r\nwoollen cloth, and rub it on what has to be restored. Four a penny!”\r\n\r\nThese balls, which are prepared by the street-sellers, are usually made\r\nof a halfpennyworth of whitening, a farthing’sworth of red-lead, and an\r\nounce of quicksilver, costing 7_d._ A gross of balls costs 7-3/4_d._,\r\nas regards the materials. The receipts of the plating ball sellers are\r\nthe same as those of the grease-removers, but with a somewhat smaller\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CORN-SALVE.\r\n\r\nThe street purveyors of corn-salve, or corn-plaster, for I heard both\r\nwords used, are not more than a dozen in number; but, perhaps, none\r\ndepend _entirely_ upon the sale of corn-salve for a living. As is\r\nthe wont of the pattering class to which they belong, these men make\r\nrounds into the country and into the suburbs, but there are sometimes,\r\non one day, a dozen “working the main drags” (chief thoroughfares) of\r\nLondon: there are no women in the trade. The salve is most frequently\r\ncarried on a small tray, slung in front of the street professional; but\r\nsometimes it is sold at a small stall or stand. Oxford-street, Holborn,\r\nTottenham-court-road, and Whitechapel, are favourite localities for\r\nthese traders; as are Blackfriars-road and Newington-causeway on the\r\nSurrey side of the Thames. On the Saturday evening the corn-salve\r\nsellers resort to the street markets.\r\n\r\nThe patter of these traders is always to the same purport (however\r\ndifferently expressed)--the long-tested efficacy and the unquestionable\r\ncheapness of their remedies. The vendors are glib and unhesitating;\r\nbut some, owing, I imagine, to a repetition of the same words, as they\r\nmove from one part of a thoroughfare to another, or occupy a pitch,\r\nhave acquired a monotonous tone, little calculated to impress a street\r\naudience--to effect which a man must be, or appear to be, in earnest.\r\nThe patter of one of these dealers, who sells corn-salve on fine\r\nevenings, and works the public-houses, “with anything likely,” on wet\r\nevenings, is, from his own account, in the following words:--\r\n\r\n“Here you have a speedy remedy for every sort of corn! Your hard corn,\r\nsoft corn, blood corn, black corn, old corn, new corn, wart, or bunion,\r\ncan be safely cured in three days! Nothing further to do but spread\r\nthis salve on a piece of glove-leather, or wash-leather, and apply it\r\nto the place. Art and nature does the rest. Either corns, warts, or\r\nbunions, cured for one penny.”\r\n\r\nThis, however, is but as the announcement of the article on sale, and\r\nis followed by a recapitulation of the many virtues of that peculiar\r\nrecipe; but, as regards the major part of these street-traders, the\r\nrecapitulation is little more than a change of words, if that. There\r\nare, however, one and sometimes two patterers, of acknowledged powers,\r\nwho every now and then sell corn-salve--for the restlessness of this\r\nclass of people drives them to incessant changes in their pursuits--and\r\ntheir oratory is of a higher order. One of the men in question speaks\r\nto the following purport:--\r\n\r\n“Here you are! here you are! all that has to complain of corns. As\r\nfast as the shoemaker lames you, I’ll cure you. If it wasn’t for me\r\nhe dursn’t sing at his work; bless you, but he knows I’ll make his\r\npinching easy to you. Hard corn, soft corn, any corn--sold again! Thank\r\nyou, sir, you’ll not have to take a ’bus home when you’ve used my\r\ncorn-salve, and you can wear your boots out then; you can’t when you’ve\r\ncorns. Now, in this little box you see a large corn which was drawn\r\nby this very salve from the honourable foot of the late lamented Sir\r\nRobert Peel. It’s been in my possession three years and four months,\r\nand though I’m a poor man--hard corn, soft corn, or any corn--though\r\nI’m a poor man, the more’s the pity, I wouldn’t sell that corn for the\r\nnewest sovereign coined. I call it the free-trade corn, gen’l’men and\r\nleddis. No cutting and paring, and sharpening penknives, and venturing\r\non razors to level your corns; this salve draws them out--only one\r\npenny--and without pain. But wonders can’t be done in a moment. To\r\ndraw out such a corn as I’ve shown you, the foot, the whole foot, must\r\nbe soaked five minutes in warm soap and water. That makes the salve\r\npenetrate, and draw the corn, which then falls out, in three days, like\r\na seed from a flower. Hard corn, soft corn, &c., &c.”\r\n\r\nThe corn from “the honourable foot” of Sir Robert Peel, or from the\r\nfoot of any one likely to interest the audience, has been scraped\r\nand trimmed from a cow’s heel, and may safely be submitted to the\r\ninspection and handling of the incredulous. “There it is,” the\r\ncorn-seller will reiterate--“it speaks for itself.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-SELLER OF GREASE-REMOVING COMPOSITION, ETC.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nOne practice--less common than it was, however,--of the corn-salve\r\nstreet-seller, is to get a friend to post a letter--expressive\r\nof delighted astonishment at the excellence and rapidity of\r\nthe corn-cure--at some post-office not very contiguous. If the\r\nsalve-seller be anxious to remove the corns of the citizens, he\r\ndisplays this letter, with the genuine post-mark of Piccadilly, St.\r\nJames’s-street, Pall-mall, or any such quarter, to show how the\r\nfashionable world avails itself of his wares, cheap as they are,\r\nand fastidious as are the fashionable! If the street-professional\r\nbe offering his corn-cures in a fashionable locality, he produces\r\na letter from Cheapside, or Cornhill--“there it is, it speaks for\r\nitself”--to show how the shrewd city-people, who were never taken\r\nin by street-sellers in their lives, and couldn’t be, appreciated\r\nthat particular corn-salve! Occasionally, as the salve-seller is\r\npattering, a man comes impetuously forward, and says loudly, “Here,\r\ndoctor, let me have a shilling’s-worth. I bought a penn’orth, and it\r\ncured one corn by bringing it right out--here the d----d thing is, it\r\ntroubled me seven year--and I’ve got other corns, and I’m determined\r\nI’ll root out the whole family of them. Come, now, look sharp, and\r\nput up a shilling’s-worth.” The shilling’s-worth is gravely handed to\r\nthe applicant as if it were not only a _boná fide_, but an ordinary\r\noccurrence in the way of business.\r\n\r\nOne corn-salve seller--who was not in town at the time of my inquiry\r\ninto this curious matter--had, I was assured, “and others might\r\nhave” full faith in the efficacy of the salve he vended. One of his\r\nfellow-traders said to me, “Ay, sir, and he has good reason for\r\ntrusting to it for a cure; he cured _me_ of my corns, that I’m sure of;\r\nso there can be no nonsense about it. He has a secret.” On my asking\r\nthis informant if he had tried his own corn-salve, he laughed, and said\r\n“No! I’m like the regular doctors that way, never tries my own things.”\r\nThe same man, who had no great faith in what he sold being of any use\r\nin the cure of “corn, wart, or bunion,” assured me--and I have no doubt\r\nwith truth--that he had sold his remedy to persons utter strangers to\r\nhim, who had told him afterwards that it had cured their corns. “False\r\nrelics,” says a Spanish proverb, “have wrought true miracles,” and to\r\nwhat cause these corn-cures were attributable, it is not my business to\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of the ingredients of a\r\nstreet corn-salve. “Anybody,” said one man, “that understands how to\r\nset about it, can get the recipe for 2_d._” Resin, 1 lb., (costing\r\n2_d._); tallow, 1/4 lb. (1-1/2_d._); emerald green (1_d._); all boiled\r\ntogether. The emerald green, I was told, was to “give it a colour.” The\r\ncolour is varied, but I have cited the most usual mode of preparation.\r\nAttempts have been made to give an aromatic odour to the salve, but\r\nall the perfumes within the knowledge, or rather the means, of the\r\nstreet-sellers, were overpowered by the resin and the tallow, “and it\r\nhas,” remarked one dealer, “a physicky sort of smell as it is, which\r\nanswers.” The quantity I have cited would supply a sufficiency of the\r\ncomposition for the taking of “a sovereign in penn’orths.” In a week\r\nor so the stuff becomes discoloured, often from dust, and has to be\r\nre-boiled. Some of the traders illustrate the mode of applying the\r\nsalve by carrying a lighted candle, and a few pieces of leather, and\r\nshowing how to soften the composition and spread it on the leather.\r\n“After all, sir,” said the man, who had faith in the virtues of his\r\nfellow street-trader’s salve, “the regular thing, such as I sell, may\r\ndo good; I cannot say; but it is very likely that the resin will draw\r\nthe corn, just as people apply cobbler’s wax, which has resin in it.\r\nThe chemists will sell you something of the same sort as I do.”\r\n\r\nThe principal purchasers are working men, who buy in the streets, and\r\noccasionally in the public-houses. The trade, however, becomes less and\r\nless remunerative. To take 15_s._ in a week is a good week, and to take\r\n10_s._ is more usual; the higher receipt is no doubt attributable to\r\na superior patter being used, as men will give 1_d._ to be amused by\r\nthis street work, without caring about the nostrum. Calculating that\r\neight of these traders take 10_s._ weekly--so allowing for the frequent\r\nresort of the patterers to anything more attractive--we find 208_l._\r\nexpended in the streets on this salve. The profits of the seller are\r\nabout the same as his receipts, for 240 pennyworths can be made out of\r\nmaterials costing only 4-1/2_d._ The further outlay necessary to this\r\nstreet profession is a tray worth 1_s._ or 1_s._ 6_d._, but a large\r\nold backgammon board, which may be bought at the second-hand shops for\r\n1_s._ and sometimes for 6_d._, is more frequently used by the street\r\npurveyors of corn-salve.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GLASS AND CHINA CEMENT, AND OF RAZOR PASTE.\r\n\r\nThe sale of glass and china cement is an old trade in the streets, but\r\none which becomes less and less followed. Before the finer articles\r\nof crockeryware became cheap as they are now, it was of importance\r\nto mend, if possible, a broken dish of better quality, and of more\r\nimportance to mend a china punch-bowl. Dishes, however, are now much\r\ncheaper, and china punch-bowls are no longer an indispensable part of\r\neven tavern festivity.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of this cement proclaim it as one which will “cure any\r\nchina, stone, or earthenware, and make the broken parts adhere so\r\nfirmly, that if you let it fall again, it will break, not at the part\r\nwhere it has been cemented, but at some other. Only a halfpenny, or\r\na penny a stick.” These traders sometimes illustrate the adhesive\r\nstrength of the composition by producing a plate or dish which has\r\nbeen cemented in different places, and letting it fall, to break in\r\nsome hitherto sound part. This they usually succeed in doing. For the\r\ncementing of glass the street article is now perhaps never sold, and\r\nwas but scantily sold, I am informed, at any time, as the junction was\r\nalways unsightly.\r\n\r\nThere are now four men who sell this cement in the streets, one usually\r\nto be found in Wilderness-row, Goswell-street, being, perhaps, the\r\none who carries on the trade most regularly. They all make their own\r\ncement; one of the receipts being--1 lb. shellac (5_d._), 1/4 lb.\r\nbrimstone (1/2_d._), blended together until it forms a thick sort\r\nof glue. This quantity makes half-a-crown’s-worth of the cement for\r\nthe purposes of retail. The sellers do not confine themselves to\r\none locality, but are usually to be found in one or other of the\r\nstreet-markets on a Saturday night. If each seller take 5_s._ weekly\r\n(of which 4_s._ may be profit), we find 52_l._ expended yearly by\r\nstreet customers in this cement.\r\n\r\nI include razor paste under this head, as sometimes, and at one time\r\nmore frequently than now, the same individual sold both articles,\r\nthough not at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve street-sellers of razor-paste, but they seem to prefer\r\n“working” the distant suburbs, or going on country rounds, as there are\r\noften only three in London. It is still vended, I am told, to clerks,\r\nwho use it to sharpen their pen-knives, but the paste, owing to the\r\nprevalence of the use of steel pens, is now almost a superfluity,\r\ncompared to what it was. It is bought also, and frequently enough in\r\npublic-houses, by working men, as a means of “setting” their razors.\r\nThe vendors make the paste themselves, except two, who purchase of a\r\nstreet-seller. The ingredients are generally fuller’s earth (1_d._),\r\nhog’s lard (1_d._), and emery powder (2_d._). The paste is sold in\r\nboxes carried on a tray, which will close and form a sort of case, like\r\na backgammon board. The quantity I have given will make a dozen boxes\r\n(each sold at 1_d._), so that the profit is 7_d._ in the 1_s._, for\r\nto the 4_d._ paid for ingredients must be added 1_d._, for the cost\r\nof a dozen boxes. The paste is announced as “warranted to put an edge\r\nto a razor or pen-knife superior to anything ever before offered to\r\nthe public.” The street-sellers offer to prove this by sharpening any\r\ngentleman’s pen-knife on the paste spread on a piece of soldier’s old\r\nbelt, which sharpening, when required, they accomplish readily enough.\r\nOne of these paste-sellers, I was told, had been apprenticed to a\r\nbarber; another had been a cutler, the remainder are of the ordinary\r\nclass of street-sellers.\r\n\r\nCalculating that 6 men “work” the metropolis daily, taking 2_s._ each\r\nper day (with 1_s._ 2_d._ profit), we find 187_l._ the amount of the\r\nstreet outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CRACKERS AND DETONATING BALLS.\r\n\r\nThis trade, I am informed by persons familiar with it, would be much\r\nmore frequently carried on by street-folk, and in much greater numbers,\r\nwere it not the one which of all street callings finds the least\r\ntoleration from the police. “You must keep your eyes on both corners of\r\nthe street,” said one man, “when you sell crackers; and what good is it\r\nthe police stopping us? The boys have only to go to a shop, and then\r\nit’s all right.”\r\n\r\nThe trade is only known in the streets at holiday seasons, and is\r\nprincipally carried on for a few days before and after the 5th of\r\nNovember, and again at Christmas-tide. “Last November was good for\r\ncrackers,” said one man; “it was either Guy Faux day, or the day\r\nbefore, I’m not sure which now, that I took 15_s._, and nearly all\r\nof boys, for waterloo crackers and ball crackers (the common trade\r\nnames), ‘waterloo’ being the ‘pulling crackers.’ At least three parts\r\nwas ball crackers. I sold them from a barrow, wheeling it about as\r\nif it was hearthstone, and just saying quietly when I could, ‘Six a\r\npenny crackers.’ The boys soon tell one another. All sorts bought of\r\nme; doctors’ boys, school boys, pages, boys as was dressed beautiful,\r\nand boys as hadn’t neither shoes nor stockings. It’s sport for them\r\nall.” The same man told me he did well at what he called “last Poram\r\nfair,” clearing 13_s._ 6_d._ in three days, or rather evenings or\r\nnights. “Poram fair, sir,” he said, “is a sort of feast among the Jews,\r\nalways three weeks I’ve heard, afore their Passover, and I then work\r\nWhitechapel and all that way.”\r\n\r\nI inquired of a man who had carried on this street trade for a good\r\nmany years, it might be ten or twelve, if he had noticed the uses to\r\nwhich his boy-customers put his not very innocent wares, and he entered\r\nreadily into the subject.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” he said, “they’re not all boy-customers, as you call them,\r\nbut they’re far the most. I’ve sold to men, and often to drunken men.\r\nWhat larks there is with the ball-crackers! One man lost his eye at\r\nStepney Fair, but that’s 6 or 7 years ago, from a lark with crackers.\r\nThe rights of it I never exactly understood, but I know he lost his\r\neye, from the dry gravel in the ball-cracker bouncing into it. But it’s\r\nthe boys as is fondest of crackers. I sold ’em all last Christmas,\r\nand made my 5_s._ and better on Boxing-day. I was sold out before 6\r\no’clock, as I had a regular run at last--just altogether. After that, I\r\nsaw one lad go quietly behind a poor lame old woman and pull a Waterloo\r\nclose behind her ear; he was a biggish boy and tidily dressed; and the\r\nold body screamed, ‘I’m shot.’ She turned about, and the boy says, says\r\nhe, ‘Does your grandmother know you’re out? It’s a improper thing, so\r\nit is, for you to be walking out by yourself.’ You should have seen her\r\npassion! But as she was screaming out, ‘You saucy wagabone! You boys is\r\nall wagabones. People can’t pass for you. I’ll give you in charge, I\r\nwill,” the lad was off like a shot.\r\n\r\n“But one of the primest larks I ever saw that way was last winter,\r\nin a street by Shoreditch. An old snob that had a bulk was making\r\nit all right for the night, and a lad goes up. I don’t know what he\r\nsaid to the old boy, but I saw him poke something, a last I think it\r\nwas, against the candle, put it out, and then run off. In a minute,\r\nthree or four lads that was ready, let fly at the bulk with their\r\nball-crackers, and there was a clatter as if the old snob had tumbled\r\ndown, and knocked his lasts down; but he soon had his head out--he was\r\nIrish, I think--and he first set up a roar like a Smithfield bull, and\r\nhe shouts, ‘I’m kilt intirely wid the murthering pistols! Po-lice!\r\nPo-o-lice!’ He seemed taken quite by surprise--for they was capital\r\ncrackers--I think he couldn’t have been used to bulks, or he would have\r\nbeen used to pelting; but how he did bellow, surely.\r\n\r\n“I think it was that same night too, I saw a large old man, buttoned\r\nup, but seeming as if he was fine-dressed for a party, in a terrible\r\nway in the Commercial-road. I lived near there then. There was\r\nthree boys afore me--and very well they did it--one of ’em throws a\r\nball-cracker bang at the old gent’s feet, just behind him, and makes\r\nhim jump stunning, and the boy walks on with his hands in his pocket,\r\nas if he know’d nothing about it. Just after that another boy does\r\nthe same, and then the t’other boy; and the old gent--Lord, how he\r\nswore! It was shocking in such a respectable man, as I told him, when\r\nhe said, _I’d_ crackered him! ‘Me cracker you,’ says I; ‘it ’ud look\r\nbetter if you’d have offered to treat a poor fellow to a pint of beer\r\nwith ginger in it, and the chill off, than talk such nonsense.’ As we\r\nwas having this jaw, one of the boys comes back and lets fly again; and\r\nthe old gent saw how it was, and he says, ‘Now, if you’ll run after\r\nthat lad, and give him a d----d good hiding, you shall have the beer.’\r\n‘Money down, sir,’ says I, ‘if you mean honour bright;’ but he grumbled\r\nsomething, and walked away. I saw him soon after, talking to a Bobby,\r\nso I made a short cut home.”\r\n\r\nAt the fairs near London there is a considerable sale of these\r\ncombustibles; and they are often displayed on large stalls in the\r\nfair. They furnish the means of practical jokes to the people on their\r\nreturn. “After last Whitsun Greenwich Fair,” said a street-seller\r\nto me, “I saw a gent in a white choker, like a parson, look in at a\r\npastry-cook’s shop, as is jist by the Elephant (and Castle), a-waiting\r\nfor a ’bus, I s’pose. There was an old ’oman with a red face standing\r\nnear him; and I saw a lad, very quick, pin something to one’s coat and\r\nthe t’other’s gown. They turned jist arter, and bang goes a Waterloo,\r\nand they looks savage one at another; and hup comes that indentical\r\nboy, and he says to the red faced ’oman, a pointing to the white\r\nchoker, ‘Marm, I seed him a twiddling with your gown. He done it for a\r\nlark arter the fair, and ought to stand something.’ So the parson, if\r\nhe were a parson, walked away.”\r\n\r\nThere are eight makers, I am told, who supply the street-sellers and\r\nthe small shops with these crackers. The wholesale price is 4_d._\r\nto 6_d._ a gross, the “cracker-balls” being the dearest. The retail\r\nprice in the streets is from six to twelve a penny, according to the\r\nappearance and eagerness of the purchaser. Some street traders carry\r\nthese commodities on trays, and very few are stationary, except at\r\nfairs. I am assured, that for a few days last November, from 50 to 60\r\nmen and women were selling crackers in the streets, of course “on the\r\nsly.” In so irregular and surreptitious a trade, it is not possible\r\neven to approximate to statistics. The most intelligent man that I met\r\nwith, acquainted, as he called it, “with all the ins and outs of the\r\ntrade,” calculated that in November and Christmas, 100_l._ at least\r\nwas expended in the streets in these combustibles, and another 100_l._\r\nin the other parts of the year. About Tower-hill, Ratcliff-highway\r\n(or “the Highway,” as street-sellers often call it), and in Wapping\r\nand Shadwell, the sale of crackers is the best. The sellers are the\r\nordinary street-sellers, and no patter is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF LUCIFER-MATCHES.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall speak only of those who _sell_ the matches,\r\napart from those who, in proffering lucifer boxes, mix up trade with\r\nmendicancy. The latter class I have spoken of, and shall treat of them\r\nmore fully under the head of “the London Poor.”\r\n\r\nUntil “lucifers” became cheap and in general use, the matches sold by\r\nthe street-folks, and there were numbers in the trade, were usually\r\nprepared by themselves. The manufactures were simple enough. Wooden\r\nsplints, twice or thrice the length of the lucifer matches now in use,\r\nwere prepared, and dipped into brimstone, melted in an iron ladle. The\r\nmatches were never, as now, self-igniting, or rather ignitable by rapid\r\nfriction; but it was necessary to “strike a light” by the concussion of\r\na flint and steel, the sparks from which were communicated to tinder\r\nkept in a “box.”\r\n\r\nThe brimstone match-sellers were of all ages, but principally, I\r\nam told, old people. Many of them during, and for some years after\r\nthe war, wore tattered regimentals, or some remains of military\r\nparaphernalia, and had been, or assumed to have been, soldiers, but not\r\nentitled to a pension; the same with seamen. I inquired of some of the\r\npresent race of match-sellers what became of the “old brimstones,” as\r\nI heard them called, but from them I could gain little information. An\r\nold groundsel-gatherer told me that some went into his trade. Others,\r\nI learned, “took to pins,” and others to song or tract selling. Indeed\r\nthe brimstone match-sellers not unfrequently carried a few songs to\r\nvend with their matches. It must be borne in mind that, 15 years ago,\r\nthose street trades, into which any one who is master of a few pence\r\ncan now embark, were less numerous. Others of the match-sellers,\r\nwith rounds, or being known men, displaced their “brimstones” for\r\n“lucifers,” and traded on as usual. I heard of one old man, now dead,\r\nwho made a living on brimstone-matches by selling a good quantity in\r\nHackney, Stoke Newington, and Islington, and who long refused to sell\r\nlucifer-matches; “they was new-fangled rubbish,” he said, “and would\r\nsoon have their day.” He found his customers, however, fall off, and\r\nin apprehension of losing them all, he was compelled to move with the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n“I believe, sir,” said one man, still a street-seller, but not having\r\nsold matches of any kind for years,--“I believe I was the first who\r\nhawked ‘Congreves,’ or ‘instantaneous lights;’ they weren’t called\r\n‘lucifers’ for a good while after. I bought them at Mr. Jones’s\r\nlight-house in the Strand, and if I remember right, for it must be\r\nmore than 20 years ago, between 1820 and 1830, Mr. Jones had a patent\r\nsomehow about them. I bought them at 7_s._ a dozen boxes, and sold\r\nthem at 1_s._ a box. I’m not sure how many matches was in a box, but I\r\nthink it was 100. You’ll get as much for a farthing now, as you would\r\nfor a shilling then. The matches were lighted by being drawn quickly\r\nthrough sand-paper. I sold them for a twelvemonth, and had the trade\r\nall to myself. As far as I know, I had; for I never met with or heard\r\nof anybody else in it all that time. I did decent at it. I suppose\r\nI cleared my 15_s._ a week. The price kept the same while I was in\r\nthe business. I sold them at city offices. I supplied the Phœnix in\r\nLombard-street, I remember, and the better sort of shops. People\r\nliked them when they wanted to light a candle in a hurry, in places\r\nwhere there was no fire to seal a letter, or such like. There was no\r\nenvelopes in them days. The penny-postage brought _them_ in. I was\r\nsometimes told not to carry such things there again, as they didn’t\r\nwant the house set on fire by keeping such dangerous things in it.\r\nNow, I suppose, lucifers are in every house, and that there’s not a\r\ntinder-box used in all London.” Such appears to have been the beginning\r\nof the extensive street-trade in these chemical preparations now\r\ncarried on. At the twelvemonth’s end, my informant went into another\r\nline of business.\r\n\r\nThe “German Congreves” were soon after introduced, and were at first\r\nsold wholesale at the “English and German” swag-shops in Houndsditch,\r\nat 2_s._ the dozen boxes, and were retailed at 3_d._, 4_d._, and\r\nsometimes as high as 6_d._ the box. These matches, I am told, “kept\r\ntheir hold” about five years, when they ceased to be a portion of the\r\nstreet trade. The German Congreves were ignited by being drawn along a\r\nslip of sand-paper, at the bottom of the box, as is done at present;\r\nwith some, however, a double piece of sand-paper was sold for purposes\r\nof igniting.\r\n\r\nAfter this time cheaper and cheaper matches were introduced, and were\r\nsold in the streets immediately on their introduction. At first, the\r\ncheaper matches had an unpleasant smell, and could hardly be kept in\r\na bed-room, but that was obviated, and the trade progressed to its\r\npresent extent.\r\n\r\nThe lucifer-match boxes, the most frequent in the street-trade,\r\nare bought by the poor persons selling them in the streets, at the\r\nmanufacturers, or at oil-shops, for a number of oilmen buy largely\r\nof the manufacturers, and can “supply the trade” at the same rate as\r\nthe manufacturer. The price is 2-1/4_d._ the dozen boxes, each box\r\ncontaining 150 matches. Some of the boxes (German made) are round, and\r\nmany used to be of tin, but these are rarely seen now. The prices are\r\nproportionate. The common price of a lucifer box in the streets is\r\n1/2_d._, but many buyers, I am told, insist upon and obtain three a\r\npenny, which they do generally of some one who supplies them regularly.\r\nThe trade is chiefly itinerant.\r\n\r\nOne feeble old man gave me the following account of his customers. He\r\nhad been in the employ of market-gardeners, carmen, and others, whose\r\nbusiness necessitated the use of carts and horses. In his old age\r\nhe was unable to do any hard work; he was assisted, however, by his\r\nfamily, especially by one son living in the country; he had a room in\r\nthe house of a daughter, who was a widow, but his children were only\r\nworking people, with families, he said, and so he sold a few lucifers\r\n“as a help,” and to have the comfort of a bit of tobacco, and buy an\r\nold thing in the way of clothing without troubling any one. Out of his\r\nearnings, too, he paid 6_d._ a week for the schooling of one of his\r\ndaughter’s children.\r\n\r\n“I _sell_ these lucifers, sir,” he said, in answer to my inquiries, “I\r\nnever beg with them: I’d scorn it. My children help me, as I’ve told\r\nyou; I did my best for them when I was able, and so I have a just sort\r\nof claim on them. Well, indeed, then, sir, as you ask me, if I had only\r\nmyself to depend upon, why I couldn’t live. I must beg or go into the\r\nhouse, and I don’t know which I should take to worst at 72. I’ve been\r\nselling lucifers about five years, for I was worn out with hard work\r\nand rheumatics when I was 65 or 66. I go regular rounds, about 2 miles\r\nin a day, or 2-1/2, or if it’s fine 3 miles or more from where I live,\r\nand the same distance back, for I can sometimes walk middling if I can\r\ndo nothing else. I carry my boxes tied up in a handkerchief, and hold 2\r\nor 3 in my hand. I’m ashamed to hold them out on any rail where I aint\r\nknown; and never do if there isn’t a good-humoured looking person to be\r\nseen below, or through the kitchen window. But my eyesight aint good,\r\nand I make mistakes, and get snapped up very short at times. Yesterday,\r\nnow, I was lucky in my small way. There’s a gentleman, that if I can\r\nsee him, I can always sell boxes to at 1_d._ a piece. That’s his price,\r\nhe says, and he takes no change if I offer it. I saw him yesterday at\r\nhis own door, and says he, ‘Well, old greybeard, I haven’t seen you for\r\na long time. Here’s 1_s._, leave a dozen boxes.’ I told him I had only\r\n11 left; but he said, ‘O, it’s all the same,’ and he told a boy that\r\nwas crossing the hall to take them into the kitchen, and we soon could\r\nhear the housekeeper grumbling quite loud--perhaps she didn’t know her\r\nmaster could hear--about being bothered with rubbish that people took\r\nin master with; and the gentleman shouts out, ‘Some of you stop that\r\nold ---- mouth, will you? She wants a profit out of them in her bills.’\r\nAll was quiet then, and he says to me quite friendly, ‘If she wasn’t\r\nthe best cook in London I’d have quitted her long since, by G--.’” The\r\nold man chuckled no little as he related this; he then went on, “He’s\r\na swearing man, but a good man, I’m sure, and I don’t know why he’s so\r\nkind to me. Perhaps he is to others. I’m ashamed to hold my boxes to\r\nthe ary rails, ’cause so many does that to beg. I sell lucifers both to\r\nmistresses and maids. Some will have 3 for a 1_d._, and though it’s a\r\npoor profit, I do it, for they say, ‘O, if you come this way constant,\r\nwe’ll buy of you whenever we want. If you won’t give 3 a penny, there’s\r\nplenty will.’ I sell, too, in some small streets, Lisson-grove way,\r\nto women that see me from their windows, and come down to the door.\r\nThey’re needle-workers I think. They say sometimes, ‘I’m glad I’ve seen\r\nyou, for it saves me the trouble of running out.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LUCIFER MATCH GIRL.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I’m sure I hardly know how many boxes I sell. On a middling\r\ngood day I sell 2 dozen, on a good day 3 dozen, on a bad day not a\r\ndozen, sometimes not half-a-dozen, and sometimes, but not often, not\r\nmore than a couple. Then in bad weather I don’t go out, and time hangs\r\nvery heavy if it isn’t a Monday; for every Monday I buy a threepenny\r\npaper of a newsman for 2_d._, and read it as well as I can with my old\r\neyes and glasses, and get my daughter to read a bit to me in the\r\nevening, and next day I send the paper to my son in the country, and so\r\nsave him buying one. As well as I can tell I sell about 9 dozen boxes a\r\nweek, one week with another, and clear from 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ It’s\r\nemployment for me as well as a help.”\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to estimate the precise number of persons who really\r\nsell lucifer matches as a means of subsistence, or as a principal\r\nmeans. There are many, especially girls and women, the majority being\r\nIrishwomen, who do not directly solicit charity, and do not even say,\r\n“Buy a box of lucifers from a poor creature, to get her a ha’porth\r\nof bread;” or, “please a bit of broken victuals, if it’s only cold\r\npotatoes, for a box of the best lucifers.” Yet these match-sellers look\r\nso imploringly down an area, or through a window, some “shouldering” a\r\nyoung child the while, and remain there so pertinaciously that a box is\r\nbought, or a halfpenny given, often merely to get rid of the applicant.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man, a street-seller, and familiar with street-trading\r\ngenerally, whom I questioned on the subject, said: “It’s really hard\r\nto tell, sir, but I should calculate this way. It’s the real sellers\r\nyou ask about; them as tries to live on their selling lucifers, or as\r\ntheir main support. I have worked London and the outside places--yes,\r\nI mean the suburbs--in ten rounds, or districts, but six is better,\r\nfor you can then go the same round the same day next week, and so get\r\nknown. The real sellers, in my opinion, is old men and women out of\r\nemploy, or past work, and to beg they are ashamed. I’ve read the Bible\r\nyou see, sir, though I’ve had too much to do with gay persons even to\r\ngo to church. I should say that in each of those ten rounds, or at any\r\nrate, splicing one with another, was twenty persons really selling\r\nlucifers. Yes, and depending a good deal upon them, for they’re an\r\neasy carriage for an infirm body, and as ready a sale as most things.\r\nI don’t reckon them as begs, or whines, or sticks to a house for an\r\nhour, but them as sells; in my opinion, they’re 200, and no more. All\r\nthe others dodges, in one way or other, on pity and charity. There’s\r\none lurk that’s getting common now. A man well dressed, and very clean,\r\nand wearing gloves, knocks at a door, and asks to speak to the master\r\nor mistress. If he succeeds, he looks about him as if he was ashamed,\r\nand then he pulls out of his coat-pocket a lucifer box or two, and\r\nasks, as a favour, to be allowed to sell one, as reduced circumstances\r\ndrive him to do so. He doesn’t beg, but I don’t reckon him a seller,\r\nfor he has always some story or other to tell, that’s all a fakement.”\r\nMost dwellers in a suburb will have met with one of these well-dressed\r\nmatch-sellers.\r\n\r\nAdopting my informant’s calculation, and supposing that each of these\r\ntraders take, on lucifers alone, but 4_s._ weekly, selling nine dozen\r\n(with a profit to the seller of from 1_s._ 9_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._),\r\nwe find 2080_l._ expended in this way. The matches are sold also at\r\nstalls, with other articles, in the street markets, and elsewhere;\r\nbut this traffic, I am told, becomes smaller, and only amounts to\r\none-tenth of the amount I have specified as taken by itinerants.\r\nThese street-sellers reside in all parts of town which I have before\r\nspecified as the quarters of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CIGAR LIGHTS, OR FUZEES.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the employments to which boys, whom neglect,\r\nill-treatment, destitution, or a vagrant disposition, have driven or\r\nlured to a street life, seem to resort to almost as readily as to the\r\noffers, “Old your ’os, sir?” “Shall I carry your passel, marm?”\r\n\r\nThe trifling capital required to enter into the business is one cause\r\nof its numbering many followers. The “fuzees,” as I most frequently\r\nheard them called, are sold at the “Congreve shops,” and are chiefly\r\nGerman made. At one time, indeed, they were announced as “German\r\ntinder.” The wholesale charge is 4-1/2_d._ per 1000 “lights.” The 1000\r\nlights are apportioned into fifty rows, each of twenty self-igniting\r\nmatches; and these “rows” are sold in the streets, one or two for\r\n1/2_d._, and two, three, or four 1_d._ It is common enough for a\r\njuvenile fuzee-seller to buy only 500; so that 2-1/4_d._ supplies his\r\nstock in trade.\r\n\r\nThe boys (for the majority of the street-traders who sell _only_\r\nfuzees, are boys) frequent the approaches to the steam-boat piers, the\r\nomnibus stands, and whatever places are resorted to by persons who love\r\nto smoke in the open air. Some of these young traders have neither\r\nshoes nor stockings, more especially the Irish lads, who are at least\r\nhalf the number, and their apology for a cap fully displays the large\r\nred ears, and flat features, which seem to distinguish a class of the\r\nIrish children in the streets of London. Some Irish boys hold out\r\ntheir red-tipped fuzees with an appealing look, meant to be plaintive,\r\nand say, in a whining tone, “Spend a halfpenny on a poor boy, your\r\nhonour.” Others offer them, without any appealing look or tone, either\r\nin silence, or saying--“Buy a fuzee to light your pipe or cigar, sir; a\r\nrow of lights for a 1/2_d._”\r\n\r\nI met with one Irish boy, of thirteen or fourteen years of age, who\r\nwas offering fuzees to the persons going to Chalk Farm fair on Easter\r\nTuesday, but the rain kept away many visitors, and the lad could hardly\r\nfind a customer. He was literally drenched, for his skin, shining with\r\nthe rain, could be seen about his arms and knees through the slits of\r\nhis thin corduroy jacket and trowsers, and he wore no shirt.\r\n\r\n“It’s oranges I sell in ginral, your honour,” he said, “and it’s\r\non oranges I hopes to be next week, plaze God. But mother--it’s\r\norange-selling she is too--wanted to make a grand show for Aister wake,\r\nand tuk the money to do it, and put me on the fuzees. It’s the thruth\r\nI’m telling your honour. She thought I might be after making a male’s\r\nmate” (meal’s meat) “out of them, intirely; but the sorra a male I’ll\r\nmake to day if it cost me a fardin, for I haven’t tuk one. I niver\r\nremimber any fader; mother and me lives together somehow, glory be to\r\nGod; but it’s often knowin’ what it is to be hungry we are. I’ve sould\r\nfuzees before, when ingans, and nuts, and oranges was dear and not for\r\nthe poor to buy, but I niver did so bad as to-day. A gintleman once\r\nsaid to me: ‘Here, Pat, yer sowl, you look hungry. Here’s a thirteener\r\nfor yez; go and get drunk wid it.’ Och, no, your honour, he wasn’t an\r\nIrish gintleman; it was afther mocking me he was, God save him.” On my\r\nasking the boy if he felt hurt at this mockery, he answered, slily,\r\nwith all his air of simplicity, “Sure, thin, wasn’t there the shillin’?\r\nFor it was a shillin’ he gave me, glory be to God. No, I niver heard it\r\ncalled a thirteener before, but mother has. Och, thin, sir, indeed, and\r\nit’s could and wet I am. I have a new shirt, as was giv to mother for\r\nme by a lady, but I wouldn’t put it on sich a day as this, your honour,\r\nsir. I’ll go to mass in it ivery Sunday. I’ve made 6_d._ a day and\r\nsometimes more a sellin’ fuzees, wid luck, God be praised, but the bad\r\nwither’s put me out intirely this time.”\r\n\r\nThe fuzee-sellers frequently offer their wares at the bars of\r\npublic-houses in the daytime, and sometimes dispose of them to those\r\nlandlords who sell cigars. From the best information I can command\r\nthere are now upwards of 200 persons selling fuzees in the streets of\r\nthe metropolis. But the trade is often collateral. The cigar-seller\r\noffers fuzees, play-bill sellers (boys) do so sometimes at the doors\r\nof the theatres to persons coming out, the pipe-sellers also carry\r\nthem; they are sometimes sold along with lucifer matches, and at\r\nmiscellaneous stalls. It will, I believe, be accurate to state that in\r\nthe streets there are generally 100 persons subsisting, or endeavouring\r\nto subsist, on the sale of fuzees alone. It may be estimated also that\r\neach of these traders averages a receipt of 10_d._ a day (with a profit\r\nexceeding 6_d._), so that 1300_l._ is yearly laid out in the streets in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nOf the fuzee-selling lads, those who are parentless, or runaway, sleep\r\nin the lodging-houses, in the better conducted of which the master or\r\ndeputy takes charge of the stock of fuzees or lucifer-matches during\r\nthe night to avert the risk of fire; in others these combustibles are\r\nstowed anywhere at the discretion, or indiscretion, of the lodgers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GUTTA-PERCHA HEADS.\r\n\r\nThere are many articles which, having become cheap in the shops, find\r\ntheir way to the street-traders, and after a brief, or comparatively\r\nbrief, and prosperous trade has been carried on in them, gradually\r\ndisappear. These are usually things which are grotesque or amusing,\r\nbut of no utility, and they are supplanted by some more attractive\r\nnovelty--a main attraction being that it is a novelty.\r\n\r\nAmong such matters of street-trade are the elastic toys called\r\n“gutta-percha heads;” these, however, have no gutta-percha in their\r\ncomposition, but consist solely of a composition made of glue and\r\ntreacle--the same as is used for printer’s rollers. The heads are\r\nsmall coloured models of the human face, usually with projecting nose\r\nand chin, and wide or distorted mouth, which admit of being squeezed\r\ninto a different form of features, their elasticity causing them to\r\nreturn to the original caste. The trade carried on in the streets in\r\nthese toys was at one time extensive, but it seems now to be gradually\r\ndisappearing. On a fine day a little after noon, last week, there\r\nwas not one “head” exposed for sale in any of the four great street\r\nmarkets of Leather-lane, the Brill, Tottenham-court-road including the\r\nHampstead-road, and High-street, Camden-town.\r\n\r\nThe trade became established in the streets upwards of two years ago.\r\nAt first, I am told by a street-seller, himself one of the first, there\r\nwere six “head-sellers,” who “worked” the parks and their vicinity.\r\nMy informant one day sold a gross of heads in and about Hyde-park,\r\nand a more fortunate fellow-trader on the same day sold 1-1/2 gross.\r\nThe heads were recommended, whenever opportunity offered, by a little\r\npatter. “Here,” one man used to say, “here’s the Duke of Wellington’s\r\nhead for 1_d._ It’s modelled from the statty on horseback, but is a\r\nimprovement. His nose speaks for itself. Sir Robert Peel’s only 1_d._\r\nAnybody you please is 1_d._; a free choice and no favour. The Queen\r\nand all the Royal Family 1_d._ apiece.” As the street-seller offered\r\nto dispose of the model of any eminent man’s head and face, he held\r\nup some one of the most grotesque of the number. Another man one\r\nSaturday evening sold five or six dozen to costermongers and others\r\nin the street markets “pattering” them off as the likenesses of any\r\npoliceman who might be obnoxious to the street-traders! This was when\r\nthe trade was new. The number of sellers was a dozen in the second\r\nweek; it was soon twenty-five, all confining themselves to the sale of\r\nthe heads; besides these the heads were offered to the street-buying\r\npublic by many of the stationary street-folk, whose stock partook of a\r\nmiscellaneous character. The men carrying on this traffic were of the\r\nclass of general street-sellers.\r\n\r\n“The trade was spoiled, sir,” said an informant, “by so many going\r\ninto it, but I’ve heard that it’s not bad in parts of the country now.\r\nThe sale was always best in the parks, I believe, and Sundays was the\r\nbest days. I don’t pretend to be learned about religion, but I know\r\nthat many a time after I’d earned next to nothing in a wet week, it\r\ncame a fine Sunday morning, and I took as much as got me and my wife\r\nand children a good dinner of meat and potatoes, and sometimes, when\r\nwe could depend on it, smoking hot from the baker’s oven; and I then\r\nfelt I had something to thank God for. You see, sir, when a man’s been\r\nout all the week, and often with nothing to call half a dinner, and\r\nhis wife’s earnings only a few pence by sewing at home, with three\r\nyoung children to take care of, you’re nourished and comforted, and\r\nyour strength keeps up, by a meat dinner on a Sunday, quietly in your\r\nown room. But them as eats their dinner without having to earn it,\r\ncan’t understand about that, and as the Sunday park trade was stopped,\r\nthe police drive us about like dogs, not gentlemen’s dogs, but stray\r\nor mad dogs. And it seems there’s some sort of a new police. I can’t\r\nunderstand a bit of it, and I don’t want to, for the old police is\r\ntrouble enough.”\r\n\r\nThe gutta-percha heads are mostly bought at the “English and German”\r\nswag-shops. A few are made by the men who sell them in the streets.\r\nThe “swag” price is 1_s._ the gross; at one time the swag man demurred\r\nto sell less than half a gross, but now when the demand is diminished,\r\na dozen is readily supplied for 8_d._ The street price retail, is and\r\nalways was 1_d._ a head. The principal purchasers in the street are\r\nboys and young men, with a few tradesmen or working people, “such as\r\ncan afford a penny or two,” who buy the “gutta-percha” heads for their\r\nchildren. There used to be a tolerable trade in public houses, where\r\npersons enjoying themselves bought them “for a lark,” but this trade\r\nhas now dwindled to a mere nothing. One of the “larks,” an informant\r\nknew to be practised, was to attach the head to a piece of paper or\r\ncard, write upon it some one’s name, make it up into a parcel, and send\r\nit to the flattered individual. The same man had sold heads to young\r\nwomen, not servant-maids he thought, but in some not very ill paid\r\nemployment, and he believed, from their manner when buying, for some\r\nsimilar purpose of “larking.” When the heads were a novelty, he sold a\r\ngood many to women of the town.\r\n\r\nThere are now no street-folks who depend upon the sale of these\r\ngutta-percha heads, but they sell them occasionally. The usual mode\r\nis to display them on a tray, and now, generally with other things.\r\nOne man showed me his box, which, when the lid was raised, he carried\r\nas a tray slung round his neck, and it contained gutta-percha heads,\r\nexhibition medals, and rings and other penny articles of jewellery.\r\n\r\nThere are at present, I am informed, 30 persons selling gutta-percha\r\nheads in the streets, some of them confining their business solely to\r\nthose articles. In this number, however, I do not include those who\r\nare both makers and sellers. Their average receipts, I am assured, do\r\nnot exceed 5_s._ a week each, for, though some may take 15_s._ a week,\r\nothers, and generally the stationary head-sellers, do not take 1_s._\r\nThe profit to the street retailer is one third of his receipts. From\r\nthis calculation it appears, that if the present rate of sale continue,\r\n390_l._ is spent yearly in these street toys. At one time it was far\r\nmore than twice the amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FLY-PAPERS AND BEETLE-WAFERS.\r\n\r\nFly-Papers came, generally, into street-traffic, I am informed, in the\r\nsummer of 1848.\r\n\r\nThe fly-papers are sold wholesale at many of the oil-shops, but the\r\nprincipal shop for the supply of the street-traders is in Whitechapel.\r\nThe wholesale price is 2-1/4_d._ a dozen, and the (street) retail\r\ncharge 1/2_d._ a paper, or three 1_d._ A young man, to whom I was\r\nreferred, and whom I found selling, or rather bartering, crockery, gave\r\nme the following account of his experience of the fly-paper trade. He\r\nwas a rosy-cheeked, strong-built young fellow, and said he thought\r\nhe was “getting on” in his present trade. He spoke merrily of his\r\ntroubles, as I have found common among his class, when they are over.\r\n\r\n“My father had a milk-walk,” he said, “and when he died I was\r\nwithout money and had nothing to do, but I soon got a place with a\r\nsingle gentleman. He had a small house, and kept only me and a old\r\nhousekeeper. I was to make myself generally useful, but when I first\r\nwent, the most I had to do was to look after a horse that master had.\r\nMaster never was on horseback in his life, but he took Skipjack--that\r\nwas the horse’s name, he was rising six--for a debt, and kept him two\r\nmonths, till he could sell him to his mind. Master took a largeish\r\ngarden--for he was fond of growing flowers and vegetables, and made\r\npresents of them--just before poor Skipjack went, and I was set to work\r\nin it, besides do my house-work. It was a easy place, and I was wery\r\ncomfable. But master, who was a good master and a friend to a poor man,\r\nas I know, got into difficulties; he was something in the City; I never\r\nunderstood what; and one night, when I’d been above a year and a-half\r\nwith him, he told me I must go, for he couldn’t afford to keep me any\r\nlonger. Next day he was arrested, quite sudden I believe, and sent to\r\nprison for debt. I had a good character, but nobody cared for one from\r\na man in prison, and in a month my money was out, and my last 3_s._\r\n6_d._ went for an advertisement, what was no good to me. I then took to\r\nholding horses or anything that way, and used to sleep in the parks or\r\nby the road-sides where it was quiet. I did that for a month and more.\r\nI’ve sometimes never tasted food all day, and used to quench myself (so\r\nhe worded it) with cold water from the pumps. It took off the hunger\r\nfor a time. I got to know other boys that was living as I was, and when\r\nI could afford it I slept at lodging-houses, the boys took me to or\r\ntold me about. One evening a gentleman gave me 1_s._ for catching his\r\nhorse that he’d left standing, but it had got frightened, and run off.\r\nNext morning I went into the fly-paper trade,--it’s nearly two years\r\nago, I think--because a boy I slept with did tidy in it. We bought the\r\npapers at the first shop as was open, and then got leave of the deputy\r\nof the lodging-house to catch all the flies we could, and we stuck\r\nthem thick on the paper, and fastened the paper to our hats. I used to\r\nthink, when I was in service, how a smart livery hat, with a cockade to\r\nit, would look, but instead of that I turned out, the first time in my\r\nlife that ever I sold anything, with my hat stuck round with flies. I\r\nfelt so ashamed I could have cried. I was miserable, I felt so awkerd.\r\nBut I spent my last 2_d._ in some gin and milk to give me courage, and\r\nthat brightened me up a bit, and I set to work. I went Mile-end way,\r\nand got out of the main streets, and I suppose I’d gone into streets\r\nand places where there hadn’t often been fly-papers before, and I soon\r\nhad a lot of boys following me, and I felt, almost, as if I’d picked a\r\npocket, or done something to be ’shamed of. I could hardly cry ‘Catch\r\n’em alive, only a halfpenny!’ But I found I could sell my papers to\r\npublic-houses and shopkeepers, such as grocers and confectioners, and\r\nthat gave me pluck. The boys caught flies, and then came up to me, and\r\nthrew them against my hat, and if they stuck the lads set up a shout.\r\nI stuck to the trade, however, and took 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ every day\r\nthat week, more than half of it profit, and on Saturday I took 5_s._\r\n6_d._ The trade is all to housekeepers. I called at open shops and\r\nlooked up at the windows, or held up my hat at private houses, and was\r\nsometimes beckoned to go in and sell my papers. Women bought most, I\r\nthink. ‘Nasty things,’ they used to say, ‘there’s no keeping nothing\r\nclean for them.’ I stuck to the trade for near two months, and then I\r\nwas worth 13_s._ 6_d._, and had got a pair of good shoes, and a good\r\nsecond-hand shirt, with one to change it; and next I did a little in\r\ntins and hardware, at the places where I used to go my fly rounds, and\r\nin the winter I got into the crock-trade, with another young fellow for\r\na mate, and I’m in it yet, and getting a tidy connection, I think.”\r\n\r\nSome of the fly-paper sellers make their stock-in-trade, but\r\nthree-fourths of the number buy them ready-made. The street-sellers\r\nmake them of old newspapers or other waste-paper, no matter how dirty.\r\nTo the paper they apply turpentine and common coach varnish, some using\r\nresin instead of varnish, and occasionally they dash a few grains of\r\nsugar over the composition when spread upon the paper.\r\n\r\nLast summer, I was informed, there were fifty or sixty persons selling\r\nfly-papers and beetle wafers in the streets; some of them boys, and\r\nall of them of the general class of street-sellers, who “take” to any\r\ntrade for which 1_s._ suffices as capital. Their average earnings may\r\nbe estimated at 2_s._ 6_d._ a day, about one-half being profit. This\r\ngives a street outlay, say for a “season” of ten weeks, of 375_l._,\r\ncalculating fifty sellers.\r\n\r\nA few of these street traders carried a side of a newspaper, black\r\nwith flies, attached to a stick, waving it like a flag. The cries\r\nwere “Catch ’em alive! Catch ’em alive for 1/2_d._!” “New method of\r\ndestroying thousands!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MISCELLANEOUS MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the more staple wares which form the street trade in\r\nmanufactured articles of a miscellaneous character, are many, as I\r\nsaid before, which have been popular for a while and are now entirely\r\ndisused. In the course of my inquiry it was remarkable how oblivious I\r\nfound many of the street-sellers as to what they had sold at various\r\nperiods. “O dear, yes sir, I’ve sold all sorts of things in the streets\r\nbesides what I’m on now; first one and then another as promised a\r\nfew pence,” was the substance of a remark I frequently heard; but\r\n_what_ was meant by the one and the other thing thus sold they had a\r\ndifficulty to call to mind, but on a hint being thrown out they could\r\nusually give the necessary details. From the information I acquired I\r\nselect the following curious matter.\r\n\r\nSix or seven years ago _Galvanic Rings_ were sold extensively by\r\nthe street-folk. These were clumsy lead-coloured things, which were\r\ndescribed by the puffing shop-keepers, and in due course by the\r\nstreet-sellers, as a perfect amulet; a thing which by its mere contact\r\nwith the finger would not only cure but prevent “fits, rheumatics, and\r\ncramps.” On my asking a man who had sold them if these were all the\r\nailments of which he and the others proclaimed the galvanic rings an\r\ninfallible cure, he answered: “Like the quack medicines you read about,\r\nsir, in ’vertisements, we said they was good for anything anybody\r\ncomplained of or was afraid was coming on them, but we went mostly for\r\nrheumatics. A sight of tin some of the shopkeepers must have made,\r\nfor what we sold at 1_d._ they got 6_d._ a piece for. Then for gold\r\ngalvanics--and I’ve been told they was gilt--they had 10_s._ 6_d._\r\neach. The streets is nothing to the shops on a dodge. I’ve been told by\r\npeople as I’d sold galvanics to, that they’d had benefit from them. I\r\nsuppose that was just superstitious. I think Hyams did the most of any\r\nhouse in galvanics.”\r\n\r\nThe men selling these rings--for the business was carried on almost\r\nentirely by men--were the regular street-traders, who sell “first\r\none thing and then another.” They were carried in boxes, as I have\r\nshown medals are now, and they generally formed a portion of the\r\nstreet-jeweller’s stock, whether he were itinerant or stationary. The\r\npurchasers were labourers in the open air, such as those employed about\r\nbuildings, whose exposure to the alternations of heat and cold render\r\nthem desirous of a cure for, or preventive against rheumatism. The\r\ncostermongers were also purchasers, and in the course of my inquiries\r\namong that numerous body, I occasionally saw a galvanic ring still worn\r\nby a few, and those chiefly, I think, fish-sellers.\r\n\r\nNor was the street or shop trade in these galvanic rings confined to\r\namulets for the finger. I heard of one elderly woman, then a prosperous\r\nstreet-seller in the New Cut, who slept with a galvanic ring on every\r\ntoe, she suffered so much from cramp and rheumatism! There were also\r\ngalvanic shields, which were to be tied round the waist, and warranted\r\n“to cure all over.” They were retailed at 6_d._ each. Galvanic earrings\r\nwere likewise a portion of this manufacture. They were not “drops”\r\nfrom the ear, but filled behind and around it as regards the back of\r\nthe skull, and were to avert rheumatic attacks, and even aching from\r\nthe head. The street price was 1_s._ the pair. Galvanic bracelets,\r\nhandsomely gilt, were 2_s._ 6_d._ the pair. But the sale of all these\r\nhigher-priced charms was a mere nonentity compared to that of the penny\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nAnother trade--if it may be classed under this head--carried on by\r\ngreat numbers and with great success for a while, was that of _cards\r\nwith the Lord’s Prayer in the compass of a sixpence_. This was an\r\nengraving--now and then offered in the streets still--strictly\r\nfulfilling the announcement as to the compass in which the Prayer was\r\ncontained, with the addition of a drawing of the Bible, as part of the\r\nengraving, “within the sixpence.” This trade was at first, I am told,\r\nchiefly in the hands of the patterers: “Grand novelty!” they said;\r\n“splendid engraving! The Lord’s Prayer, with a beautiful picture of\r\nthe Bible, all legible to the naked eye, in the compass of a sixpence.\r\nFive hundred letters, all clear, on a sixpence.” One man said to me:\r\n“I knew very well there wasn’t 500, but it was a neat number to cry. A\r\nschoolmaster said to me once--‘Why, there isn’t above half that number\r\nof letters.’ He was wrong though; for I believe there’s 280.” This\r\ncard was published six or seven years ago, and the success attending\r\nthe sale of the Lord’s Prayer, led to the publication of the Belief in\r\nthe same form. “When the trade was new,” said one man, “I could sell\r\na gross in a day without any very great trouble; but in a little time\r\nthere was hundreds in the trade, and one might patter hard to sell four\r\ndozen.”\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price was 8_s._ the gross, and as thirteen cards went to\r\nthe dozen, the day’s profit when a gross was sold was 5_s._ When the\r\nsale did not extend to beyond four dozen the profit was 1_s._ 8_d._\r\nA few cards “in letters of gold” were vended in the streets at 6_d._\r\neach. They had large margins and presented a handsome appearance. The\r\nwholesale price was 3_s._ 6_d._ the dozen.\r\n\r\nWhen this trade was at its height, there were, I am told, from 500 to\r\n700 men, women and children engaged in it; selling the cards both with\r\nand without other articles. The cards had also a very extensive sale in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n_Pen-holders with glass or china handles_ are another commodity which\r\nappeared suddenly, about six months ago, in street commerce, and at\r\nonce became the staple of a considerable traffic. These pens are eight\r\nor nine inches long, the “body,” so to speak, being of solid round\r\nglass, of almost all colours, green, blue, and black predominating,\r\nwith a seal (lacquered white or yellow) at the top, and a holder of\r\nthe usual kind, with a steel pen at the bottom. Some are made of white\r\npot and called “China pens,” and of these some are ornamented with\r\nsmall paintings of flowers and leaves. These wares are German, and\r\nwere first charged 9_s._ 6_d._ the gross, without pens, which were an\r\nadditional 3_d._ at the swag-shops. The price is now 5_s._ the gross,\r\nthe pens being the same. The street-sellers who were fortunate enough\r\nto “get a good start” with these articles did exceedingly well. The\r\npen-holders, when new, are handsome-looking, and at 1_d._ each were\r\ncheap; some few were at first retailed at 2_d._ One man, I am told,\r\nsold two-and-a-half gross in one day in the neighbourhood of the Bank,\r\npurchasers not seldom taking a dozen or more. As the demand continued,\r\nsome men connected with the supply of goods for street sale, purchased\r\nall the stock in the swag-shops, expending about 170_l._, and at once\r\nraised the price to 10_s._ 6_d._ the gross. This amount the poorer\r\nstreet-sellers demurred to give, as they could rarely obtain a higher\r\nprice than 1_d._ each, and 2_d._ for the ornamented holders, but\r\nthe street-stationers (who bought, however, very sparingly) and the\r\nsmall shopkeepers gave the advance “as they found the glass-holders\r\nasked for.” On the whole, I am told, this forestalling was not very\r\nprofitable to the speculators, as when fresh supplies were received at\r\nthe “swags,” the price fell.\r\n\r\nAt first this street business was carried on by men, but it was soon\r\nresorted to by numbers of poor women and children. One gentleman\r\ninformed me that in consequence of reading “London Labour and the\r\nLondon Poor,” he usually had a little talk with the street-sellers\r\nof whom he purchased any trifle; he bought these pen-holders of\r\nten or twelve different women and girls; all of them could answer\r\ncorrectly his inquiry as to the uses of the pens; but only one girl,\r\nof fifteen or sixteen, and she hesitatingly, ventured to assert that\r\nshe could write her own name with the pen she offered for sale. The\r\nstreet-trade still continues, but instead of being in the hands of\r\n400 individuals--as it was, at the very least, I am assured, at one\r\nperiod--there are now only about fifty carrying it on itinerantly,\r\nwhile with the “pitched” sales-people, the glass-holders are merely\r\na portion of the stock, and with the itinerants ten dozen a week (a\r\nreceipt of 10_s._, and a profit of 4_s._ 9_d._) is now an average sale.\r\nThe former glass-holder sellers of the poorer sort are now vending\r\noranges.\r\n\r\n_Shirt Buttons_ form another of the articles--(generally either “useful\r\nthings” or with such recommendation to street-buyers as the galvanic\r\namulets possessed)--which every now and then are disposed of in great\r\nquantities in the streets. If an attempt be made by a manufacturer to\r\nestablish a cheaper shirt button, for instance, of horn, or pot, or\r\nglass, and if it prove unsuccessful, or if an improvement be effected\r\nand the old stock becomes a sort of dead stock, the superseded goods\r\nhave to be disposed of, and I am informed by a person familiar with\r\nthose establishments, that the swag-shopkeepers can always find\r\ncustomers, “for anything likely,” with the indispensable proviso that\r\nit be cheap. In this way shirt buttons have lately been sold in the\r\nstreets, not only by the vendors of small wares in their regular trade,\r\nbut by men, lads, and girls, some of the males shirtless themselves,\r\nwho sell them solely, with a continuous and monotonous cry of\r\n“Halfpenny a dozen; halfpenny a dozen.” The wholesale price of the last\r\n“street lot,” was 3_d._ the gross, or 1/4_d._ the dozen. To clear 6_d._\r\na day in shirt buttons is “good work;” it is more frequently 4_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF WALKING-STICKS.\r\n\r\nThe walking-sticks sold in the streets of London are principally\r\npurchased at wholesale houses in Mint-street and Union-street,\r\nBorough, and their neighbourhoods. “There’s no street-trade,” said an\r\nintelligent man, “and I’ve tried most that’s been, or promised to be, a\r\nliving in the streets, that is so tiresome as the walking-stick trade.\r\nThere is nothing in which people are so particular. The stick’s sure to\r\nbe either too short or too long, or too thick or too thin, or too limp\r\nor too stiff. You would think it was a simple thing for a man to choose\r\na stick out of a lot, but if you were with me a selling on a fine\r\nSunday at Battersea Fields, you’d see it wasn’t. O, it’s a tiresome\r\njob.”\r\n\r\nThe trade is a summer and a Sunday trade. The best localities are the\r\nseveral parks, and the approaches to them, Greenwich-park included;\r\nHampstead Heath, Kennington Common, and, indeed, wherever persons\r\ncongregate for pedestrian purposes, Battersea Fields being, perhaps,\r\nthe place where the greatest Sunday trade is carried on. Some of the\r\ngreater thoroughfares too, such as Oxford-street and the City-road, are\r\na good deal frequented by the stick-sellers.\r\n\r\nThis trade--like others where the article sold is not of general\r\nconsumption or primary usefulness--affords, what I once heard a\r\nstreet-seller call, “a good range.” There is no generally recognised\r\nprice or value, so that a smart trader in sticks can apportion his\r\noffers, or his charges, to what he may think to be the extent of\r\nendurance in a customer. What might be 2_d._ to a man who “looked\r\nknowing,” might be 6_d._ to a man who “looked green.” The common\r\nsticks, which are the “cripples,” I was told, of all the sorts of\r\nsticks (the spoiled or inferior sticks) mixed with “common pines,” are\r\n15_d._ the dozen. From this price there is a gradual scale up to 8_s._\r\nthe dozen for “good polished;” beyond that price the street-seller\r\nrarely ventures, and seldom buys even at that (for street-trade) high\r\nrate, as fourpenny and sixpenny sticks go off the best; these saleable\r\nsticks are generally polished hazel or pine. “I’ve sold to all sorts of\r\npeople, sir,” said a stick-seller. “I once had some very pretty sticks,\r\nvery cheap, only 2_d._ a piece, and I sold a good many to boys. They\r\nbought them, I suppose, to look like men, and daren’t carry them home;\r\nfor I once saw a boy I’d sold a stick to, break it and throw it away\r\njust before he knocked at the door of a respectable house one Sunday\r\nevening. I’ve sold shilling sticks to gentlemen, sometimes, that had\r\nlost or broken or forgot their own. Canes there’s nothing done in now\r\nin the streets; nor in ‘vines,’ which is the little switchy things\r\nthat used to be a sort of a plaything. There’s only one stick-man in\r\nthe streets, as far as I know, I think--that has what you may call\r\na capital in sticks. Only the other day I saw him sell a registered\r\nstick near Charing-cross. It was a beauty. A Bath cane, with a splendid\r\nivory head, and a compass let into the ivory. The head screwed off, and\r\nbeneath was a map of London and a Guide to the Great Exhibition. O, but\r\nhe has a beautiful stock, and aint he aristocratic! ‘Ash twigs,’ with\r\nthe light-coloured bark on them, not polished, but just trimmed, was\r\na very good sale, but they’re not now. Why, as to what I take, it’s\r\nsuch a uncertain trade that it’s hard to say. Some days I haven’t taken\r\n6_d._, and the most money I ever took was one Derby day at Epsom--I\r\nwish there was more Derby days, for poor people’s sakes--and then I\r\ntook 30_s._ The most money as ever I took in London was 14_s._--one\r\nSunday, in Battersea Fields, when I had a prime cheap stock of bamboos.\r\nWhen I keep entirely to the stick trade, and during the summer, I may\r\ntake 35_s._ in a week, with a profit of 15_s._”\r\n\r\nThe street stick-sellers are, I am assured, sometimes about 200\r\nin number, on a fine Sunday in the summer. Of these, some are\r\ndock-labourers, who thus add to their daily earnings by a seventh day’s\r\nlabour; others, and a smarter class, are the “supers” (supernumeraries)\r\nof theatres, who also eke out their pittance by Sunday toil; porters,\r\nirregularly employed, and consequently “hard pushed to live,” also sell\r\nwalking-sticks on the Sundays; as do others who “cannot afford”--as a\r\nwell-educated man, a patterer on paper, once said to me--“to lose a\r\nday if they were d----d for it.” The usual mode of this street-trade\r\nis to carry the bundle of sticks strapped together, under the arm, and\r\ndeposit the ends on the ground when a sale is to be effected. A few,\r\nhowever, and principally Jews, have “stands,” with the walking-sticks\r\ninclosed in a sort of frame. On the Mondays there are not above a third\r\nof the number of stick-sellers there are on the Sundays; and on the\r\nother days of the week not above a seventh, or an eighth. Calculating\r\nthat for 12 weeks of the year there are every day 35 stick-sellers,\r\neach taking, on an average, 30_s._ a week (with a profit, individually,\r\nof about 12_s._), we find 630_l._ expended in walking-sticks in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nOn clear winter days a stick-seller occasionally plies his trade, but\r\non frosty days they are occupied in letting out skates in the parks, or\r\nwherever ponds are frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF WHIPS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThese traders are a distinct class from the stick-sellers, and have\r\na distinct class of customers. The sale is considerable; for to many\r\nthe possession of a whip is a matter of importance. If one be lost or\r\nstolen, for instance, from a butcher’s cart at Newgate-market, the\r\nneed of a whip to proceed with the cart and horse to its destination,\r\nprompts the purchase in the quickest manner, and this is usually\r\neffected of the street-seller who offers his wares to the carters at\r\nevery established resort.\r\n\r\nThe commonest of the whips sold to cart-drivers is sometimes\r\nrepresented as whalebone covered with gut; but the whalebone is a\r\nstick, and the flexible part is a piece of leather, while the gut is a\r\nsort of canvas, made to resemble the worked gut of the better sort of\r\nwhips, and is pasted to the stock; the thong--which in the common sort\r\nis called “four strands,” or plaits--being attached to the flexible\r\npart. Some of these whips are old stocks recovered, and many are sad\r\nrubbish; but for any deceit the street-seller can hardly be considered\r\nresponsible, as he always purchases at the shop of a wholesale\r\nwhipmaker, who is in some cases a retailer at the same price and under\r\nthe same representations as the street-seller. The retail price is\r\n1_s._ each; the wholesale, 8_s._ and 9_s._ a dozen. Some of the street\r\nwhip-sellers represent themselves as the makers, but the whips are\r\nalmost all made in Birmingham and Walsall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET-SELLER OF WALKING-STICKS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nOf these traders very few are the ordinary street-sellers. Most of them\r\nhave been in some way or other connected with the care of horses,\r\nand some were described to me as “beaten-out countrymen,” who had come\r\nup to town in the hope of obtaining employment, and had failed. One\r\nman, of the last-mentioned class, told me that he had come to London\r\nfrom a village in Cambridgeshire, bringing with him testimonials of\r\ngood character, and some letters from parties whose recommendation he\r\nexpected would be serviceable to him; but he had in vain endeavoured\r\nfor some months to obtain work with a carrier, omnibus proprietor, or\r\njob-master, either as driver or in charge of horses. His prospects thus\r\nfailing him, he was now selling whips to earn his livelihood. A friend\r\nadvised him to do this, as better than starving, and as being a trade\r\nthat he understood:--\r\n\r\n“I often thought I’d be forced to go back home, sir,” he said, “and\r\nI’d have been ashamed to do ’t, for I _would_ come to try my luck in\r\nLondon, and would leave a place I had. All my friends--and they’re not\r\nbadly off--tried to ’suade me to stop at home another year or two, but\r\ncome I would, as if I must and couldn’t help it. I brought good clothes\r\nwith me, and they’re a’most all gone; and I’d be ashamed to go back\r\nso shabby, like the prodigal’s son; you know, sir. I’ll have another\r\ntry yet, for I get on to a cab next Monday, with a very respectable\r\ncab-master. As I’ve only myself, I know I can do. I was on one, but not\r\nwith the same master, after I’d been six weeks here; but in two days I\r\nwas forced to give it up, for I didn’t know my way enough, and I didn’t\r\nknow the distances, and couldn’t make the money I paid for my cab. If\r\nI asked another cabman, he was as likely to tell me wrong as right.\r\nThen the fares used to be shouting out, ‘I say, cabby, where the h----\r\nare you going? I told you Mark-lane, and here we are at the Minories.\r\nDrive back, sir.’ I know my way now well enough, sir. I’ve walked the\r\nstreets too long not to know it. I notice them on purpose now, and know\r\nthe distances. I’ve written home for a few things for my new trade, and\r\nI’m sure to get them. They don’t know I’m selling whips. There would be\r\nsuch a laugh against me among all t’ young fellows if they did. Me as\r\nwas so sure to do well in London!\r\n\r\n“It’s a poor trade. A carman’ll bid me 6_d._ for such a whip as this,\r\nwhich is 4_s._ 3_d._ the half dozen wholesale. ‘I have to find my own\r\nwhips,’ my last customer said, ‘though I drives for a stunning grocer,\r\nand be d----d to him.’ They’re great swearers some of them. I make\r\n7_s._ or 8_s._ in a week, for I can walk all day without tiring. I one\r\nweek cleared 14_s._ Next week I made 3_s._ I _have_ slept in cheap\r\nlodging-houses--but only in three: one was very decent, though out of\r\nthe way; one was middling; and the t’other was a pig-sty. I’ve seen\r\nvery poor places in the country, but nothing to it. I now pay 2_s._ a\r\nweek for a sort of closet, with a bed in it, at the top of a house, but\r\nit’s clean and sweet; and my landlord’s a greengrocer and coal-merchant\r\nand firewood-seller;--he’s a good man--and I can always earn a little\r\nagainst the rent with him, by cleaning his harness, and grooming his\r\npony--he calls it a pony, but it’s over 15 hands--and greasing his\r\ncart-wheels, and mucking out his stable, and such like. I shall live\r\nthere when I’m on my cab.”\r\n\r\nOther carmen’s whips are 1_s._ 6_d._, and as high as 2_s._ 6_d._,\r\nbut the great sale is of those at 1_s_. The principal localities for\r\nthe trade are at the meat-markets, the “green markets,” Smithfield,\r\nthe streets leading to Billingsgate when crowded in the morning, the\r\nneighbourhood of the docks and wharfs, and the thoroughfares generally.\r\n\r\nThe trade in the other kind of whips is again in the hands of another\r\nclass, in that of cabmen who have lost their licence, who have been\r\nmaimed, and the numerous “hands” who job about stables--especially\r\ncab-horse stables--when without other employment. The price of the\r\ninferior sort of “gig-whips” is 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._, the wholesale\r\nprice being from 9_s._ 6_d._ to 14_s._ 6_d._ the dozen. Some are lower\r\nthan 9_s._ 6_d._, but the cabmen, I am told, “will hardly look at them;\r\nthey know what they’re a-buying of, and is wide awake, and that’s one\r\nreason why the profit’s so small.” Occasionally, one whip-seller told\r\nme, he had sold gig-whips at 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ to gentlemen who had\r\nbroken their “valuable lance-wood,” or “beautiful thorn,” and who made\r\na temporary purchase until they could buy at their accustomed shops.\r\n“A military gent, with mustachers, once called to me in Piccadilly,”\r\nthe same man stated, “and he said, ‘Here, give me the best you can for\r\nhalf-a-crown, I’ve snapped my own. I never use the whip when I drive,\r\nfor my horse is skittish and won’t stand it, but I can’t drive without\r\none.’”\r\n\r\nIn the height of the season, two, and sometimes three men, sell\r\nhandsome gig-whips at the fashionable drives or the approaches. “I have\r\ntaken as much as 30_s._ in a day, for three whips,” said one man, “each\r\n10_s._; but they were silver-mounted thorn, and very cheap indeed;\r\nthat’s 8 or 9 years back; people looks oftener at 10_s._ now. I’ve sold\r\nhorse-dealers’ whips too, with loaded ends. Oh, all prices. I’ve bought\r\nthem, wholesale, at 8_s._ a dozen, and 7_s._ 6_d._ a piece. Hunting\r\nwhips are never sold in the streets now. I have sold them, but it’s a\r\ngood while ago, as riding whips for park gentlemen. The stocks were\r\nof fine strong lancewood--such a close grain! with buck horn handles,\r\nand a close-worked thong, fastened to the stock by an ‘eye’ (loop),\r\nwhich it’s slipped through. You could hear its crack half a mile off.\r\n‘Threshing machines,’ I called them.”\r\n\r\nAll the whip-sellers in a large way visit the races, fairs, and large\r\nmarkets within 50 miles of London. Some go as far as Goodwood at the\r\nrace-time, which is between 60 and 70 miles distant. On a well-thronged\r\nrace-ground these men will take 3_l._ or 4_l._ in a day, and from a\r\nhalf to three-fourths as much at a country fair. They sell riding-whips\r\nin the country, but seldom in town.\r\n\r\nAn experienced man knew 40 whip-sellers, as nearly as he could call\r\nthem to mind, by sight, and 20 by name. He was certain that on no\r\nday were there fewer than 30 in the streets, and sometimes--though\r\nrarely--there were 100. The most prosperous of the body, including\r\ntheir profits at races, &c., make 1_l._ a week the year through; the\r\npoorer sort from 5_s._ to 10_s._, and the latter are three times as\r\nnumerous as the others. Averaging that only 30 whip-sellers take 25_s._\r\neach weekly (with profits of from 5_s._ to 10_s._) in London alone, we\r\nfind 1,950_l._ expended in the streets in whips.\r\n\r\nSome of the whip-sellers vend whipcord, also, to those cabmen and\r\ncarters who “cord” their own whips. The whipcord is bought wholesale at\r\n2_s._ the pound (sometimes lower), and sold at 1/2_d._ the knot, there\r\nbeing generally six dozen knots in a pound.\r\n\r\nAnother class “mend” cabmen’s whips, re-thonging, or “new-springing”\r\nthem, but these are street-artisans.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PIPES, AND OF SNUFF AND TOBACCO BOXES.\r\n\r\nThe pipes now sold in the streets and public-houses are the “china\r\nbowls” and the “comic heads.” The “china-bowl” pipe has a bowl of\r\nwhite stone china, which unscrews, from a flexible tube or “stem,” as\r\nit is sometimes called, about a foot long, with an imitation-amber\r\nmouth-piece. They are retailed at 6_d._ each, and cost 4_s._ a dozen at\r\nthe swag-shops. The “comic heads” are of the clay ordinarily used in\r\nthe making of pipes, and cost 16_d._ the dozen, or 15_s._ the gross.\r\nThey are usually retailed at 2_d._ Some of the “comic heads” may be\r\nconsidered as hardly well described by the name, as among them are\r\ndeath’s-heads and faces of grinning devils. “The best sale of the comic\r\nheads,” said one man, “was when the Duke put the soldiers’ pipes out at\r\nthe barracks; wouldn’t allow them to smoke there. It was a Wellington’s\r\nhead with his thumb to his nose, taking a sight, you know, sir. They\r\nwent off capital. Lots of people that liked their pipe bought ’em,\r\nin the public-houses especial, ’cause, as I heerd one man--he was a\r\nboot-closer--say, ‘it made the old boy a-ridiculing of hisself.’ At\r\nthat time--well, really, then, I can’t say how long it’s since--I\r\nsold little bone ‘tobacco-stoppers’--they’re seldom asked for now,\r\nstoppers is quite out of fashion--and one of them was a figure of ‘old\r\nNosey,’ the Duke you know--it was intended as a joke, you see, sir; a\r\ntobacco-_stopper_.”\r\n\r\nThere are now nine men selling pipes, which they frequently raffle\r\nat the public-houses; it is not unusual for four persons to raffle\r\nat 1/2_d._ each, for a “comic head.” The most costly pipes are not\r\nnow offered in the streets, but a few are sold on race-courses. I am\r\ninformed that none of the pipe-sellers depend entirely upon their\r\ntraffic in those wares, but occasionally sell (and raffle) such things\r\nas china ornaments or table-covers, or tobacco or snuff-boxes. If,\r\ntherefore, we calculate that four persons sell pipes daily the year\r\nthrough, taking each 25_s._ (and clearing 10_s._), we find 260_l._\r\nyearly expended upon the hawkers’ pipes.\r\n\r\nThe snuff and tobacco-boxes disposed of by street-traders, for they are\r\nusually sold by the same individual, are bought at the swag-shops.\r\nIn a matter of traffic, such as snuff-boxes, in which the “fancy” (or\r\ntaste) of the purchaser is freely exercised, there are of course many\r\nvarieties. The exterior of some presents a series of transverse lines,\r\ncoloured, and looking neat enough. Others have a staring portrait of\r\nthe Queen, or of “a young lady,” or a brigand, or a man inhaling the\r\npungent dust with evident delight; occasionally the adornment is a\r\nruin, a farm-house, or a hunting scene. The retail price is from 4_d._\r\nto 1_s._, and the wholesale 3_s._ to 7_s._ 6_d._ the dozen. The Scotch\r\nboxes, called “Holyroods” in the trade, are also sold in the streets\r\nand public-houses. These are generally the “self-colour” of the wood;\r\nthe better sort are lined with horn, and are, or should be, remarkable\r\nfor the closeness and nice adjustment of the hinges or joints. They are\r\nsold--some I was told being German-made--at the swag-shops at 3_s._\r\nthe dozen, or 4_d._ each, to 6_s._ the dozen, or 8_d._ each. “Why, I\r\ncalc’lated,” said one box-seller, “that one week when I was short of\r\ntin, and had to buy single boxes, or twos, at a time, to keep up a\r\nfair show of stock, the swags got 2_s._ more out of me than if I could\r\nhave gone and bought by the dozen. I once ventured to buy a very fine\r\nHolyrood; it’ll take a man three hours to find out the way to open it,\r\nif he doesn’t know the trick, the joints is so contrived. But I have it\r\nyet. I never could get an offer for what it cost me, 5_s._”\r\n\r\nThe tobacco-boxes are of brass and iron (though often called “steel”).\r\nThere are three sizes: the “quarter-ounce,” costing 3_s._ the dozen;\r\nthe “half-ounce,” 4_s._ 3_d._; and “the ounce,” 5_s._ 6_d._ the dozen,\r\nor 6-1/2_d._ each. These are the prices of the brass. The iron, which\r\nare “sized” in the same way, are from 2_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ the dozen,\r\nwholesale. They are retailed at from 3_d._ to 6_d._ each, the brass\r\nbeing retailed at from 4_d._ to 1_s._ All these boxes are opened and\r\nshut by pressure on a spring; they are partly flat (but rounded), so as\r\nto fit in any pocket. The cigar-cases are of the same quality as the\r\nsnuff-boxes (not the Holyroods), and cost, at the German swag-shops,\r\n3_s._ 6_d._ the dozen, or 4-1/2_d._ each. They are usually retailed, or\r\nraffled for on Saturday and Monday nights, at 6_d._ each, but the trade\r\nis a small one.\r\n\r\nOne branch of this trade, concerning which I heard many street-sellers\r\nvery freely express their opinions, is the sale of “indecent\r\nsnuff-boxes.” Most of these traders insisted, with a not unnatural\r\nbitterness, that it would be as easy to stop the traffic as it was to\r\nstop Sunday selling in the park, but then “gentlemen was accommodated\r\nby it,” they added. These boxes and cigar-cases are, for the most part,\r\nI am told, French, the lowest price being 2_s._ 6_d._ a box. One man,\r\nwhose information was confirmed to me by others, gave me the following\r\naccount of what had come within his own knowledge:--\r\n\r\n“There’s eight and sometimes nine persons carrying on the indecent\r\ntrade in snuff-boxes and cigar-cases. They make a good bit of money,\r\nbut they’re drunken characters, and often hard up. They’ve neither\r\nshame nor decency; they’ll tempt lads or anybody. They go to\r\npublic-houses which they know is used by fast gents that has money\r\nto spare. And they watch old and very young gents in the streets, or\r\nany gents indeed, and when they see them loitering and looking after\r\nthe girls, they take an opportunity to offer a ‘spicy snuff-box,\r\nvery cheap.’ It’s a trade only among rich people, for I believe the\r\nindecent sellers can’t afford to sell at all under 2_s._ 6_d._, and\r\nthey ask high prices when they get hold of a green ’un; perhaps one up\r\non a spree from Oxford or Cambridge. Well, I can’t say where they get\r\ntheir goods, nor at what price. That’s their secret. They carry them\r\nin a box, with proper snuff-boxes to be seen when its opened, and the\r\nothers in a secret drawer beneath; or in their pockets. You may have\r\nseen a stylish shop in Oxford-street, and in the big window is large\r\npipe heads of a fine quality, and on them is painted, quite beautiful,\r\nnaked figures of women, and there’s snuff-boxes and cigar-cases of\r\nmuch the same sort, but they’re nothing to what these men sell. I must\r\nknow, for it’s not very long since I was forced, through distress,\r\nto colour a lot of the figures. I could colour 50 a day. I hadn’t a\r\nweek’s work at it. I don’t know what they make; perhaps twice as much\r\nin a day, as in the regular trade can be made in a week. I was told by\r\none of them that one race day he took 15_l._ It’s not every day they\r\ndo a good business, for sometimes they may hawk without ever showing\r\ntheir boxes; but gentlemen will have them if they pay ever so much for\r\nthem. There’s a risk in the trade, certainly. Sometimes the police gets\r\nhold of them, but very very seldom, and it’s 3 months. Or if the Vice\r\nSociety takes it up, it may be 12 months. The two as does best in the\r\ntrade are women; they carry great lots. They’ve never been apprehended,\r\nand they’ve been in the trade for years. No, I should say they was not\r\nwomen of the town. They’re both living with men, but the men’s not in\r\nthe same trade, and I think is in no trade; just fancy men. So I’ve\r\nunderstood.”\r\n\r\nI may observe that the generality of the hawkers of indecent prints and\r\ncards are women.\r\n\r\nThere are about 35 persons selling snuff and tobacco-boxes--the\r\ngreatest sale being of tobacco-boxes--and cigar-cases, generally with\r\nthe other things I have mentioned. Of these 35, however, not one-half\r\nsell snuff-boxes constantly, but resort to any traffic of temporary\r\ninterest in the public or street-public estimation. Some sell only in\r\nthe evenings. Reckoning that 15 persons on snuff and tobacco and cigar\r\nboxes alone take 18_s._ weekly (clearing 7_s._ or 8_s._), we find\r\n702_l._ thus expended.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF CIGARS.\r\n\r\nCigars, I am informed, have constituted a portion of the street-trade\r\nfor upwards of 20 years, having been introduced not long after the\r\nremoval of the prohibition on their importation from Cuba. It was\r\nnot, however, until five or six years later that they were at all\r\nextensively sold in the streets; but the street-trade in cigars is no\r\nlonger extensive, and in some respects has ceased to exist altogether.\r\n\r\nI am told by experienced persons that the cigars first vended in\r\nthe streets and public-houses were really smuggled. I say “really”\r\nsmuggled, as many now vended under that pretence never came from the\r\nsmuggler’s hands. “Well, now, sir,” said one man, “the last time I\r\nsold Pickwicks and Cubers a penny apiece with lights for nothing, was\r\nat Greenwich Fair, on the sly rather, and them as I could make believe\r\nwas buying a smuggled thing, bought far freer. Everybody likes a\r\nsmuggled thing.” [This remark is only in consonance with what I have\r\nheard from others of the same class.] “In my time I’ve sold what was\r\nsmuggled, or made to appear as sich, but far more in the country than\r\ntown, to all sorts--to gentlemen, and ladies, and shopkeepers, and\r\nparsons, and doctors, and lawyers. Why no, sir, I can’t say as how I\r\never sold anything in that way to an exciseman. But smuggling’ll always\r\nbe liked; it’s sich a satisfaction to any man to think he’s done the\r\ntax-gatherer.”\r\n\r\nThe price of a cigar, in the earlier stages of the street-traffic, was\r\n2_d._ and 3_d._ One of the boxes in which these wares are ordinarily\r\npacked was divided by a partition, the one side containing the higher,\r\nand the other the lower priced article. The division was often a mere\r\ntrick of trade--in justification of which any street-seller would be\r\nsure to cite the precedent of shopkeepers’ practices--for the cigars\r\nmight be the same price (wholesale) but the bigger and better-looking\r\nwere selected as “threepennies,” the “werry choicest and realest\r\nHawanners, as mild as milk, and as strong as gunpowder,” for such, I am\r\ntold, was the cry of a then well-known street-trader. The great sale\r\nwas of the “twopennies.” As the fuzees, now so common, were unknown,\r\nand lucifer matches were higher-priced, and much inferior to what they\r\nare at present, the cigar seller in most instances carried tow with\r\nhim, a portion of which he kept ignited in a sort of tinder-box, and at\r\nthis the smokers lighted their cigars; or the vender twisted together\r\na little tow and handed it, ignited, to a customer, that if he were\r\nwalking on he might renew his “light,” if the cigar “wouldn’t draw.”\r\n\r\nA cheaper cigar soon found its way into street commerce, “only a\r\npenny apiece, prime cigars;” and on its first introduction, a straw\r\nwas fitted into it, as a mouth-piece. “Cigar tubes” were also sold in\r\nthe streets; they were generally of bone, and charged from 2_d._ to\r\n1_s._ each. The cigar was fitted into the tube, and they were strongly\r\nrecommended on the score of economy, as “by means of this tube, any\r\ngen’l’man can smoke his cigar to half a quarter of an inch, instead\r\nof being forced to throw it away with an inch and a half left.” These\r\ntubes have not for a long time been vended in the streets. I am told by\r\na person, who himself was then engaged in the sale, that the greatest\r\nnumber of penny cigars ever sold in the streets in one day was on that\r\nof her Majesty’s coronation (June 28, 1838). Of this he was quite\r\npositive from what he had experienced, seen, and heard.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion,” said another street-seller, “the greatest injury the\r\nstreet-trade in such things had was when the publicans took to selling\r\ncigars. They didn’t at first, at least not generally; I’ve sold cigars\r\nmyself, at the bars of respectable houses, to gentlemen that was\r\nhaving their glass of ale with a friend, and one has said to another,\r\n‘Come, we’ll have a smoke,’ and has bought a couple. O, no; I never\r\nwas admitted to offer them in a parlour or tap-room; that would have\r\ninterfered with the order for ‘screws’ (penny papers of tobacco), which\r\nis a rattling good profit, I can tell you. Indeed, I was looked shy at,\r\nfrom behind the bar; but if customers chose to buy, a landlord could\r\nhardly interfere. Now, it’s no go at all in such places.”\r\n\r\nOne common practice among the smarter street-seller, when “on cigars,”\r\nwas, until of late years, and still is, occasionally at races and\r\nfairs, to possess themselves of a few really choice “weeds,” as like as\r\nthey could procure them to their stock-in-trade, and to smoke one of\r\nthem, as they urged their traffic.\r\n\r\nThe aroma was full and delicate, and this was appealed to if necessary,\r\nor, as one man worded it, the smell was “left to speak for itself.”\r\nThe street-folk who prefer the sale of what is more or less a luxury,\r\nbecome, by the mere necessities of their calling, physiognomists and\r\nquick observers, and I have no reason to doubt the assertion of one\r\ncigar-vendor, when he declared that in the earlier stages of this\r\ntraffic he could always, and most unerringly in the country, pick out\r\nthe man on whose judgment others seemed to rely, and by selling him\r\none of his choice reserve, procure a really impartial opinion as to\r\nits excellence, and so influence other purchasers. When the town trade\r\n“grew stale”--the usual term for its falling-off--the cigar-sellers had\r\na remunerative field in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn London, before railways became the sole means of locomotion to a\r\ndistance, the cigar-sellers frequented the coaching-yards; and the\r\n“outsides” frequently “bought a cigar to warm their noses of a cold\r\nnight,” and sometimes filled their cases, if the cigar-seller chanced\r\nto have the good word of the coachman or guard.\r\n\r\nThe cigar street-trade was started by two Jews, brothers, named\r\nBenasses, who were “licensed to deal in tobacco,” and vended good\r\narticles. When they relinquished the open-air business, they supplied\r\nthe other street-sellers, whose numbers increased very rapidly. The\r\nitinerant cigar-vending was always principally in the hands of the\r\nJews, but the general street-traders resorted to the traffic on all\r\noccasions of public resort,--“sich times,” observed one, “as fairs and\r\nraces, and crownations, and Queen’s weddings; I wish they came a bit\r\noftener for the sake of trade.” The manufacture of the cigars sold at\r\nthe lowest rates, is now almost entirely in the hands of the Jews,\r\nand I am informed by a distinguished member of that ancient faith,\r\nthat when I treat of the Hebrew children, employed in _making_ cigars,\r\nthere will be much to be detailed of which the public have little\r\ncognisance and little suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe cigars in question are bought (wholesale) in Petticoat-lane,\r\nRosemary-lane, Ailie-street, Tenter-ground, in Goodman’s-fields, and\r\nsimilar localities. The kinds in chief demand are Pickwicks, 7_s._\r\nand 8_s._ per lb.; Cubas, 8_s._ 6_d._; common Havannahs and Bengal\r\nCheroots, the same price; but the Bengal Cheroots are not uncommonly\r\nsmuggled.\r\n\r\n“The best places for cigar-selling,” one man stated, “I’ve always\r\nfound to be out of town; about Greenwich and Shooter’s Hill, and to\r\nthe gents going to Kensington Gardens, and such like places. About\r\nthe Eagle Tavern was good, too, as well as the streets leading to the\r\nSurrey Zoological--one could whisper, ‘cheap cigar, sir, half what\r\nthey’ll charge you inside.’ I’ve known young women treat their young\r\nmen to cigars as they were going to Cremorne, or other public places;\r\nbut there’s next to no trade that way now, and hasn’t been these five\r\nor six years. I don’t know what stopped it exactly. I’ve heard it was\r\nshop-keepers that had licences, complaining of street people as hadn’t,\r\nand so the police stopped the trade as much as they could.”\r\n\r\nAt all the neighbouring races and fairs, and at any great gathering of\r\npeople in town, cigars are sold, more with the affectation than the\r\nreality of its being done, “quite on the sly.” The retail price is\r\n1_d._ each, and three for 2_d._ Some of the cheap cigars are made to\r\nrun 200, and even as high as 230 to the pound. A fuzee is often given\r\ninto the bargain.\r\n\r\nI am told that, on all favourable opportunities, there are still 100\r\npersons who vend cigars in the streets of London, while a greater\r\nnumber of “London hands” carry on the trade at Epsom and Ascot races.\r\nAt other periods the business is all but a nonentity. To clear 1_l._ a\r\nweek is considered “good work.” At one period, on every fine Sunday,\r\nthere were not, I am assured, fewer than 500 persons selling cigars in\r\nthe open air in London and its suburbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SPONGE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the street-trades which has been long in the hands of\r\nthe Jews, and, unlike the traffic in pencils, sealing-wax, and other\r\narticles of which I have treated, it remains so principally still.\r\n\r\nIn perhaps no article which is a regular branch of the street-trade,\r\nis there a greater diversity in the price and quality than in sponge.\r\nThe street-sellers buy it at 1_s._ (occasionally 6_d._), and as high as\r\n21_s._ the pound. At one time, I believe about 20 years back, when fine\r\nsponge in large pieces was scarce and dear, some street-sellers gave\r\n28_s._ the pound, or, in buying a smaller quantity, 2_s._ an ounce.\r\n\r\n“I have sold sponge of all sorts,” said an experienced street-seller,\r\n“both ‘fine toilet,’ fit for any lady or gentleman, and coarse stuff\r\nnot fit to groom a ass with. That very common sponge is mostly 1_s._\r\nthe lb. wholesale, but it’s no manner of use, it’s so sandy and gritty.\r\nIt weighs heavy, or there might be a better profit on it. It has to\r\nbe trimmed up and damped for showing it, and then it always feels\r\nhask (harsh) to the hand. It rubs to bits in no time. There was a old\r\ngent what I served with sponges, and he was very perticler, and the\r\nbest customer I ever had, for his housekeeper bought her leathers\r\nof me. Like a deal of old coves that has nothing to do and doesn’t\r\noften stir out, but hidles away time in reading or pottering about a\r\ngarden, he was fond of a talk, and he’d give me a glass of something\r\nshort, as if to make me listen to him, for I used to get fidgety, and\r\nhe’d talk away stunning. He’s dead now. He’s told me, and more nor\r\nonce, that sponges was more of a animal than a wegetable,” continued\r\nthe incredulous street-seller, “I do believe people reads theirselves\r\nsilly. Such ---- nonsense! Does it look like a animal? Where’s its\r\nhead and its nose? He’d better have said it was a fish. And it’s not a\r\nwegetable neither. But I’ll tell you what it is, sir, and from them as\r\nhas seen it where its got with their own eyes. I have some relations\r\nas is sea-farin’-men, and I went a woyage once myself when a lad--one\r\nof my relations has seen it gathered by divers, I forget where, from\r\nthe rocks at the bottom and shores of the sea, and he says it’s just\r\nsea-moss--stuff as grows there, as moss does to old walls in England.\r\nThat’s what it is, sir. As it’s grown in the water, it holds water\r\nyou see. I’ve made 15_s._ on sponge alone, in a good week, when I had\r\na good stock; but oftener I’ve made only 10_s._, and sometimes not\r\n5_s._ My best trade is at private houses a little ways out of town.\r\nI’ve heard gents say, ‘A good sponging’s as good as a bath,’ and when\r\nI could get good things cheap they’d be sure to sell. No, I never did\r\nmuch at the mews.”\r\n\r\nAnother man told me that he once bought a large quantity of sponge at\r\n6_d._ the lb., trimmed it up as well as he could, and got a man to help\r\nhim, and the two “worked it off” in barrows; there was six barrows\r\nfull, and as one was emptied it was replenished. It was sold at 1_d._\r\nand 2_d._ a lump; about twenty lumps, or pieces, going to a pound, so\r\nthat there was 14_d._ profit on what cost 6_d._, even on the penny\r\nlumps. He had forgotten the exact amount he cleared, and he and his\r\nmate sold it all in one summer’s evening, but it was somewhere about\r\n10_s._ This happened some years ago, when the common sponge, which I\r\nheard called also “honeycomb” sponge, was not so “blown upon,” as my\r\ninformant expressed it, as it is now. On my asking this man as to the\r\nproportion of Jews in this trade, he answered: “Well, many a day I’m\r\nsatisfied there’s 100 people selling sponge, and I should say that\r\nfor every ten or twelve Jews is one Christian, and half of them, or\r\nmore, has been in some sort of service, I mean the Christians has,\r\nmost likely stable-helpers, and they supplies the mews and the job and\r\nlivery stables, such of them as requires men to find their own sponges,\r\nbut that’s only a few; sponges is mostly bought for such places at\r\nthe saddlers’ and other shops. In my opinion, sir, Jews is better\r\nChristians than Christians themselves, for _they_ help one another,\r\nand we don’t. I’ve been helped by a Jew myself, without any connection\r\nwith them. They’re terrible keen hands at a bargain, though.”\r\n\r\nThe sponge in the street-trade is purchased, wholesale, chiefly in\r\nHoundsditch. The wholesale trade in sponge, I may add, is also in the\r\nhands of the Jews. The great mart is Smyrna, the best qualities being\r\ngathered in the islands of the Greek Archipelago. The sponge is carried\r\nby the street-traders in baskets, the bearer holding a specimen piece\r\nor two in his hand. Smaller pieces are sometimes carried in nets, and\r\nnets were more frequently in use for this purpose than at present. It\r\nis nearly all sold by itinerants, in the business parts as well as the\r\nsuburbs, the purchasers being “shopkeepers, innkeepers, gentlemen,\r\nand gentlemen’s servants.” Sometimes low-priced sponge is offered in\r\na street-market on a Saturday or Monday night, but very rarely, as it\r\nis a thing little used by the poor. A little is sold to the cabmen\r\nat their stands. The sponge-sellers, I may add, when going a regular\r\nround, offer their wares to any passer-by. A little is done by the Jews\r\nin bartering sponge for old clothes. There are five or six women in the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that the estimate of my informant, as to\r\nthe number of sponge-sellers, is correct. But some sell sponge only\r\noccasionally, some make it only a portion of their business, and others\r\nvend it only when they “have it a bargain.” Calculating, then, that\r\nonly fifty persons (so allowing for the irregularities in the trade)\r\nvend sponge daily, and that each takes 15_s._ weekly,--some taking\r\n25_s._, and others but 5_s._--with about half profit on the whole (the\r\ncommon sponge is often from 200 to 300 per cent. profit), we find the\r\noutlay to be 1,950_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF WASH-LEATHERS.\r\n\r\nThe wash-leathers, sometimes called “shammys” (chamois), now sold\r\nextensively in the streets, are for the most part the half of a\r\nsheep-skin, or of a larger lamb-skin. The skin is “split” by machinery,\r\nand to a perfect nicety, into two portions. That known as the “grain”\r\n(the part to which the fleece of the animal is attached) is very thin,\r\nand is dressed into a “skiver,” a kind of leather used in the commoner\r\nrequirements of book-binding, and for such purposes as the lining of\r\nhats. The other portion, the “flesh,” is dressed as wash-leather. These\r\nskins are bought at the leather-sellers and the leather-dressers,\r\nat from 2_s._ to 20_s._ the dozen. The higher priced, or those from\r\n12_s._ are often entire, and not “split” skins. The great majority\r\nof the street-sellers of wash-leathers are women, and principally\r\nIrishwomen. They offer their wash-leathers in all parts of town,\r\ncalling at shops and inns; and at private houses offering them through\r\nthe area rails, or knocking at the door when it is accessible. Many\r\nof these street-sellers are the wives of Irish labourers, employed by\r\nbricklayers and others, who are either childless, or able to leave\r\ntheir younger children under the care of an older brother or sister,\r\nor when the poverty of the parents, or their culpable neglect, is\r\nextreme, allow them to run at large in the court or street, untended.\r\nThe wives by this street-trade add to the husbands’ earnings. In the\r\nrespects of honesty and chastity, these women bear good characters.\r\n\r\nThe wash-leathers are sold for the cleaning of windows, and of plate\r\nand metal goods. Sixpence is a common price for a leather, the higher\r\npriced being sold at the mews and at gentlemen’s houses. The “chamois”\r\nsold at the mews, however, are not often sold by the Irishwomen, but\r\nby the class I have described as selling scissors, &c., there. The\r\nleathers are also cut into pennyworths, and these pennyworths are\r\nsometimes sold on Saturday evenings in the street-markets.\r\n\r\nThere are, I am assured, 100 individuals selling little or nothing else\r\nbut wash-leathers (for these traders are found in all the suburbs) in\r\nLondon, and that they take 10_s._ weekly, with a profit of from 4_s._\r\nto 5_s._ There are, also, 100 other persons selling them occasionally,\r\nalong with other goods, and as they vend the higher-priced articles,\r\nthey probably receive nearly an equal amount. Hence it would appear\r\nthat upwards of 5000_l._ is annually expended in the streets in this\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SPECTACLES AND EYE-GLASSES.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago the street-trade in spectacles was almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Jews, who hawked them in their boxes of\r\njewellery, and sold them in the streets and public-houses, carrying\r\nthem in their hands, as is done still. The trade was then far more\r\nremunerative than it is at the present time to the street-folk carrying\r\nit on. “People had more money then,” one old spectacle-seller, now\r\nvending sponges, said, “and there wasn’t so many forced to take to the\r\nstreets, Irish particularly, and opticians’ charges were higher than\r\nthey are now, and those who wanted glasses thought they were a take-in\r\nif they wasn’t charged a fair price. O, times was very different then.”\r\n\r\nThe spectacles in the street-trade are bought at swag-shops in\r\nHoundsditch. The “common metal frames,” with or without slides, are\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ the dozen wholesale, and are retailed from\r\n4_d._ to 1_s._ The “horn frames” are 6_s._ to 7_s._ 6_d._ the dozen,\r\nand are retailed from 9_d._ to 18_d._, and even 2_s._ The “thin steel”\r\nare from 10_s._ 6_d._ to 21_s._ the dozen, and are retailed from 1_s._\r\n6_d._ to 3_s._ There are higher and lower prices, but those I have\r\ncited are what are usually paid by the street-traders. The inequality\r\nof the retail prices is accounted for by there being some difference\r\nin the spectacles in a dozen, some being of a better-looking material\r\nin horn or metal; others better finished. Then there is the chance of\r\nwhich street-sellers are not slow to avail themselves--(“no more nor\r\nis shopkeepers,” one man said)--I mean, the chance of obtaining an\r\nenhanced price for an article, with whose precise value the buyer is\r\nunacquainted.\r\n\r\n“The patter,” said the street-trader I have before quoted, “is\r\nnothing now, to what I’ve known it. You call it patter, but I don’t.\r\nI think it’s more in the way of persuasion, and is mostly said in\r\npublic-houses, and not in the streets. Why, I’ve persuaded people,\r\nwhen I was in the trade and doing well at it--for that always gives\r\nyou spirits--I’ve persuaded them in spite of their eyes that they\r\nwanted glasses. I knew a man who used to brag that he could talk people\r\nblind, and then they bought! It wasn’t old people I so much sold to as\r\nyoung and middle-aged. I think perhaps I sold as many because people\r\nthought they looked better, or more knowing in them, than to help\r\ntheir eyesight. I’ve known my customers try my glasses, one pair after\r\nanother, in the chimney glass of a public-house parlour. ‘They’re real\r\nScotch pebbles,’ I used to say sometimes--and I always had a fair\r\narticle,--‘and was intended for a solid silver frame but the frame\r\nwas made too small for them, and so I got them and put them into this\r\nframe myself, for I’m an optician, out of work, by trade. They’re worth\r\n15_s._, but you may have them, framed and all, for 7_s._ 6_d._’ I got\r\n5_s._ for one pair once that way but they were a superior thing; I had\r\nthem a particular bargain.” One man told me that not long ago he asked\r\n10_d._ for a pair of spectacles, and a journeyman slop-tailor said to\r\nhim, “Why I only gave 1_s._ for this pair I’m wearing a few years back,\r\nand they ought to be less than 10_d._ now, for the duty’s off glass.”\r\n\r\nThe eye-glasses sold in the streets are “framed” in horn. They are\r\nbought at the same places as the spectacles, and cost, wholesale, for\r\n“single eyes” 4_s._ 6_d._ to 7_s._ 6_d._ the dozen. The retail price is\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 1_s._ The “double eyes,” which are jointed in the middle\r\nso that the frame can be fitted to the bridge of the nose, are 10_s._\r\n6_d._ to 15_s._ the dozen, and are retailed by the street-folk from\r\n1_s._ 3_d._ to 2_s._ each.\r\n\r\nThe spectacles are sold principally to working men, and are rarely\r\nhawked in the suburbs. The chief sale is in public-houses, but they\r\nare offered in all the busier thoroughfares and wherever a crowd is\r\nassembled. “The eye-glasses,” said a man who vended them, “is sold to\r\nwhat I calls counter-hoppers and black-legs. You’ll see most of the\r\nyoung swells that’s mixed up with gaming concerns at races--for there’s\r\ngaming still, though the booths is put down in many places--sport their\r\neye-glasses; and so did them as used to be concerned in getting up\r\nDerby and St. Leger ‘sweeps’ at public-houses; least-ways I’ve sold to\r\nthem, where sweeps was held, and they was busy about them, and offered\r\nme a chance, sometimes, for a handsome eye-glass. But they’re going out\r\nof fashion, is eye-glasses, I think. The other day I stood and offered\r\nthem for nearly five hours at the foot of London-bridge, which used\r\nto be a tidy pitch for them, and I couldn’t sell one. All that day I\r\ndidn’t take a halfpenny.”\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes 100 men, the half of whom are Jews and Irishmen in\r\nequal proportions, now selling spectacles and eye-glasses. Some of\r\nthese traders are feeble from age, accident, continued sickness, or\r\nconstitution, and represent that they must carry on a “light trade,”\r\nbeing incapable of hard work, even if they could get it. Two women\r\nsell spectacles along with Dutch drops. As in other “light trades,”\r\nthe spectacle sellers do not, as a body, confine themselves to those\r\nwares, but resort, as one told me, “to anything that’s up at the time\r\nand promises better,” for a love of change is common among those who\r\npursue a street life. It may be estimated, I am assured, that there\r\nare thirty-five men (so allowing for the breaks in regular spectacle\r\nselling) who vend them daily, taking 15_s._ a week (with a profit of\r\n10_s._), the yearly expenditure being thus 1365_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF DOLLS.\r\n\r\nThe making of dolls, like that of many a thing required for a mere\r\nrecreation, a toy, a pastime, is often carried on amidst squalor,\r\nwretchedness, or privation, or--to use the word I have frequently heard\r\namong the poor--“pinching.” Of this matter, however, I shall have to\r\ntreat when I proceed to consider the manufacture of and trade in dolls\r\ngenerally, not merely as respects street-sale.\r\n\r\nDolls are now so cheap, and so generally sold by open-air traders whose\r\nwares are of a miscellaneous character, as among the “swag-barrow” or\r\n“penny-a piece” men of whom I have treated separately, that the sale of\r\nwhat are among the most ancient of all toys, as a “business of itself,”\r\nis far smaller, numerically, than it was.\r\n\r\nThe dolls are most usually carried in baskets by street-sellers (who\r\nare not makers) and generally by women who are very poor. Here and\r\nthere in the streets most frequented by the patrons of the open-air\r\ntrade may be seen a handsome stall of dolls of all sizes and fashions,\r\nbut these are generally the property of makers, although those makers\r\nmay buy a portion of their stock. There are also smaller stalls which\r\nmay present the stock of the mere seller.\r\n\r\nThe dolls for street traffic may be bought at the swag-shops or of\r\nthe makers. For the little armless 1_d._ dolls the maker charges the\r\nstreet-seller 8_s._, and to the swag-shop keeper who may buy largely,\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ the dozen. Some little stalls are composed entirely of\r\npenny dolls; on others the prices run from 1_d._ to 6_d._ The chief\r\ntrade, however, among the class I now describe, is carried on by the\r\ndisplay of dolls in baskets. If the vendor can only attract the notice\r\nof children--and more especially in a private suburban residence, where\r\nchildren are not used to the sight of dolls on stalls or barrows, or\r\nin shops--and can shower a few blessings and compliments, “God be wid\r\nyour bhutiful faces thin--and yours too, my lady, ma’am (with a curtsey\r\nto mistress or maid). Buy one of these dolls of a poor woman: shure\r\nthey’re bhutiful dolls and shuted for them angels o’ the worruld;”\r\nunder such circumstances, I say, a sale is almost certain. I may add\r\nthat the words I have given I myself heard a poor Irishwoman, whom I\r\nhad seen before selling large pincushions in the same neighbourhood\r\n(that of the Regent’s Park), address to a lady who was walking round\r\nher garden accompanied by two children.\r\n\r\nA vendor of dolls expresses an opinion that as long as ever there are\r\nchildren from two years old to ten, there will always be purchasers\r\nof dolls; “but for all that,” said he, “somehow or another ’t is\r\nnothing of a trade to what it used to be. I’ve seen the time when I\r\ncould turn out in the morning and earn a pound afore night; but it’s\r\ndifferent now there’s so many bazaars, and so many toy shops that the\r\ndoll hawker hasn’t half the chance he used to have. Sartinly we gets\r\na chance now and then--fine days is the best--and if we can get into\r\nthe squares or where the children walks with their nurses, we can do\r\ntidy; but the police are so very particular there’s not much of a\r\nlivelihood to be got. Spoiled children are our best customers. Whenever\r\nwe sees a likely customer approaching--we, that is, those who know\r\ntheir business--always throw ourselves in the way, and spread out our\r\ndolls to the best advantage. If we hears young miss say _she will_\r\nhave one, and cries for it, we are almost sure of a customer, and if\r\nwe see her kick and fight a bit with the nuss-maid we are sure of a\r\ngood price. If a child _cries well_ we never baits our price. Most of\r\nthe doll-sellers are the manufacturers of the dolls--that is, I mean,\r\nthey puts ’em together. The heads are made in Hamburgh; the principal\r\nplaces for buying them in London are at Alfred Davis’s, in Houndsditch;\r\nWhite’s, in Houndsditch; and Joseph’s, in Leadenhall-street. They are\r\nsold as thus:--The heads that we sell for 3_d._ each, when made up,\r\ncost us 7_s._ 6_d._ per gross, or 7-1/2_d._ per dozen; these are called\r\n1--O’s. No. 2--O’s., are 8_s._ 6_d._ per gross, and No. 3--O’s. 10_s._\r\nper gross. One yard and half of calico will make a dozen bodies, small\r\nsize. These we get sewn for three halfpence, and we stuffs and finishes\r\nthem ourselves.\r\n\r\n“When our 3_d._ dolls are made up, they cost about 1_s._ per dozen--so\r\nthere is 2_d._ profit on every doll, which I thinks is little enough;\r\nbut we often sells ’em at 2_d._; we lays ’em out to the best advantage\r\nin a deep basket, all standing up, as it were, or leaning against\r\nthe sides of the basket. The legs and bodies is carefully wrapped in\r\ntissue paper, not exactly to preserve the lower part of the doll, for\r\nthat isn’t so very valuable, but in reality to conceal the legs and\r\nbody, which is rather the reverse of symmetrical; for, to tell the\r\ntruth, every doll looks as if it were labouring under an attack of\r\nthe gout. There are, however, some very neat articles exported from\r\nGermany, especially the jointed dolls, but they are too dear for the\r\nstreet-hawker, and would not show to such advantage. There is also the\r\nplaster dolls, with the match legs. I wonder how they keep their stand,\r\nfor they are very old-fashioned; but they sell, for you never see a\r\nchandler’s shop window without seeing one of these sticking in it, and\r\na falling down as if it was drunk. Then there’s the wax dolls. Some\r\nof ’em are made of wax, and others of ‘_pappy mashy_,’ and afterwards\r\ndipped in wax. The cheapest and best mart for these is in Barbican;\r\nit would astonish many if they knew exactly what was laid out in\r\nthe course of a year in dolls. It would be impossible, I think, to\r\nascertain exactly; but I think I could guess something near the mark.\r\nThere are, at least, at this time of year, when the fairs are coming\r\non, fifty doll-hawkers, who sell nothing else. Say each of these sells\r\none dozen dolls per day, and that their average price is 4_d._ each.\r\nThat is just 10_l._ a day, and 60_l._ per week. In the winter time so\r\nmany are not sold; but I have no doubt that 50_l._’s worth of dolls are\r\nsold each week throughout the year by London hawkers alone, or just\r\nupon 3000_l._ per annum. The shops sell as many as the hawkers, and the\r\nstalls attending fairs half the amount; and you may safely say that\r\nthe sum taken for dolls in and around London in one year amounts to\r\n7500_l._ A doll-merchant can begin business with a trifle,” continued\r\nmy informant; “a shilling will obtain a dozen 3_d._ dolls. If you\r\nhave no basket, carry them in your arms, although they don’t show off\r\nto such advantage there as they do when nicely basketed; however, if\r\nyou’ve luck, you may soon raise a basket; for 3_s._ 6_d._ you can get\r\na very nice one; and although the doll trade is not what it used to\r\nbe, there are,” said my informant, “worse games than that yet, I know.\r\nOne man, who is now in a very respectable way of business--‘_a regular\r\ngentleman_’--was a very few years ago only a doll-hawker. Another man,\r\nwho had two hands and only one arm--poor fellow! he was born with one\r\narm, and had two hands, one appended to his arm in the usual way, and\r\nthe other attached to his shoulder--a freak of nature, I think, they\r\ncalled it. However, my one-armed friend keeps now a very respectable\r\nlittle swag-shop at North Shields, in Northumberland.”\r\n\r\nI inquired of my informant whether he objected to relate a little of\r\nhis history? He replied, “not the least,” and recounted as follows:--\r\n\r\n“They call me _Dick the Dollman_. I was, I believe, the first as ever\r\ncried dolls three a shilling in the streets. Afore I began they al’ays\r\nstood still with ’em; but I cried ’em out same as they do mackrel; that\r\nis twenty years ago. I wasn’t originally a doll-seller. My father was\r\na pensioner in Greenwich College. My mother used to hawk, and had a\r\nlicence. I was put to school in St. Patrick’s-school, Lanark’s-passage,\r\nwhere I remained six years, but I didn’t learn much. At thirteen years\r\nof age I was apprenticed to a brush and broom maker’s, corner of C----\r\nStreet, Spitalfields. My master was not the honestest chap in the\r\nworld, for he bought hair illegal, was found out, and got transported\r\nfor seven years. A man who worked for my master took me to finish my\r\napprenticeship; this man and his wife was very old people. I used to\r\nwork four days in the week, two for them and two for myself; the other\r\ntwo days I went out hawking brooms and brushes, and very often would\r\nearn 7_s._ or 8_s._ on a Saturday, but times was better then than\r\nthey are now. Arter that, for sake of gain, I left the old people,\r\nI was offered 20_s._ to make and hawk; and in course I took it. I\r\nremained with this master five months; he was afflicted with rheumatic\r\nfever--went into the hospital--and I was left to shift for myself.\r\nWhen my master went to the hospital I had 7_s._ 6_d._ in my pocket;\r\nI knew I _must_ do something, and, to tell you the truth, I didn’t\r\nlike the brush-making; I would rather have hawked something without\r\nthe trouble of making it. I think _now_ I was a little afflicted with\r\nlaziness. I was passing London-bridge and saw a man selling Marshall’s\r\npocket-books; I knowed him afore; I thought I should like to try the\r\npocket-book selling, and communicated my wishes to the man; he told\r\nme they cost eight shillings a dozen, if I liked we would purchase a\r\ndozen a’twixt us; we did so; I received half a dozen, but I afterwards\r\nlearned that my friend obtained seven for his share, as they were sold\r\nthirteen to the dozen. I went to Chancery-lane with my lot and was\r\nvery lucky; I sold the six books to one gentleman for six shillings:\r\nin course I soon obtained another supply; that day I sold four dozen,\r\nand earned 20_s._ I was such a good seller that Marshall let me have\r\n3_l._ or 4_l._’s worth on credit--_and I never paid him_. I know that\r\nwas wrong now; but I was such a foolish chap, and used to spend my\r\nmoney as fast as I got it. I would have given Marshall a shilling the\r\nother day if I had had one, for I see him selling penny books in the\r\nstreet. I thought it was hard lines, and had been such a gentleman too.\r\nSomerset-house corner was a capital stand for selling pocket-books.\r\nThe way I took to the dolls was this; I met a girl with a doll basket\r\none day as I was standing at Somerset-house corner; she and I got a\r\ntalking. ‘Will you go to the ’Delphy to night?’ says I; she consented.\r\nThey was a playing Tom and Jerry at this time, all the street-sellers\r\nwent to see it, and other people; and nice and crabbed some on ’em was.\r\nWell, we goes to the ’Delphy--and I sees her often arter that, and at\r\nlast gets married. She used to buy her dolls ready made; I soon finds\r\nout where to get the heads--and the profits when we made them ourselves\r\nwas much greater. We began to serve hawkers and shops; went to\r\nBristol--saved 47_l._--comes to London and spends it all; walks back to\r\nBristol, and by the time we got there we had cleared more than 20_l._\r\nWe were about a month on the journey, and visited Cheltenham and other\r\ntowns. We used to spend our money very foolishly; we were too fond of\r\nwhat was called getting on the spree. You see we might have done well\r\nif we had liked, but we hadn’t the sense. My wife got very clever at\r\nthe dolls and so did I. Then I tried my hand at the wax dolls, and got\r\nto make them very well. I paid a guinea to learn.\r\n\r\n“I was selling wax-dolls one day in London, and a gentleman asked me if\r\nI could mend a wax figure whose face was broken. I replied yes, for I\r\nhad made a few wax heads, large size, for some showmen. I had made some\r\nmurderers who was hung; lately I made Rush and Mr. and Mrs. Manning;\r\nbut the showmen can’t afford to get new heads now-a-days, so they\r\ngenerally makes one head do for all; sometimes they changes the dress.\r\nWell, as I was telling you, I went with this gentleman, and proposed\r\nthat he should have a new head cast, for the face of the figure was\r\nso much broken. It was Androcles pulling the thorn out of the lion’s\r\nfoot, and was to be exhibited. I got 20_s._ for making the new head.\r\nThe gentleman asked me if I knew the story about Androcles. Now I had\r\nnever heard on him afore, but I didn’t like to confess my ignorance,\r\nso I says ‘yes;’ then he offers me 30_s._ a week to describe it in\r\nthe Flora Gardens, where it was to be exhibited. I at once accepted\r\nthe engagement; but I was in a bit of a fix, for I didn’t know what\r\nto say. I inquired of a good many people, but none on ’em could tell\r\nme; at last I was advised to go to Mr. Charles Sloman--you know who I\r\nmean--him as makes a song and sings it directly; I was told he writes\r\nthings for people. I went, and he wrote me out a patter. I asked him\r\nhow much he charged; he said, ‘Nothing my man.’ Sartinly he wasn’t long\r\na-doing it, but it was very kind of him. I got what Mr. Sloman wrote\r\nout for me printed, and this I stuck inside my hat; the people couldn’t\r\nsee it, though I dare say they wondered what I was looking in my hat\r\nabout. However, in a week or so, I got it by heart, and could speak\r\nit well enough. After exhibiting Androcles I got an engagement with\r\nanother waxwork show--named Biancis--and afterwards at other shows. I\r\nwas considered a very good doorsman in time, but there’s very little to\r\nbe got by that now; so we keeps to the dolly business, and finds we can\r\nget a better living at that than anything else. Me and the old woman\r\ncan earn 1_l._ a week, bad and all as things are; but we’re obliged to\r\nhawk.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “SWAG-BARROWMEN,” AND “LOT-SELLERS.”\r\n\r\nThe “swag” (miscellaneous) barrow is one of the objects in the\r\nstreets which attracts, perhaps more readily than any other, the\r\nregards of the passer-by. There are so many articles and of such\r\nvarious uses; they are often so closely packed, so new and clean\r\nlooking, and every here and there so tastefully arranged, that this\r\nstreet-trader’s barrow really repays an examination. Here are spread\r\non the flat part of the barrow, pepper-cruets or boxes, tea-caddies,\r\nnutmeg-graters, vinegar-cruets, pen-cases, glass or china-handled\r\npens, pot ornaments, beads, ear-rings, finger-rings (plain or with\r\n“stones”), cases of scent-bottles, dolls, needle-cases, pincushions,\r\nExhibition medals and “frames” (framed pictures), watches, shawl-pins,\r\nextinguishers, trumpets and other toys, kaleidoscopes, seals, combs,\r\nlockets, thimbles, bone tooth-picks, small playing-cards, teetotums,\r\nshuttle-cocks, key-rings, shirt-studs or buttons, hooks and eyes,\r\ncoat-studs, money-boxes, spoons, boxes of toys, earthenware-mugs, and\r\nglass articles, such as salt-cellars and smelling-bottles. On one\r\nbarrow were 225 articles.\r\n\r\nAt the back and sides of the swag-barrow are generally articles which\r\nare best displayed in an erect position. These are children’s wooden\r\nswords, whips, climbing monkeys, and tumblers, jointed snakes twisting\r\nto the wind from the top of a stick, kites, and such things as tin\r\negg-holders.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on very few barrows or stalls are to be seen _all_ the articles\r\nI have enumerated, but they are all “in the trade,” and, if not found\r\nin this man’s stock, may be found in his neighbour’s. Things which\r\nattain only a temporary sale, such as galvanic rings, the Lord’s Prayer\r\nin the compass of a sixpence, gutta-percha heads, &c., are also to be\r\nfound, during the popular demand, in the miscellaneous trader’s stock.\r\n\r\nEach of the articles enumerated is retailed at 1_d._ “Only a penny!”\r\nis the cry, “pick ’em out anywhere; wherever your taste lies; only\r\na penny, a penny, a penny!” But on a few other barrows are goods,\r\nmixed with the “penny” wares, of a higher price; such as knives and\r\nforks, mustard pots, sham beer glasses (the glasses which appear to\r\nhold beer frothing to the brim), higher-priced articles of jewellery,\r\nskipping-ropes, drums, china ornaments, &c. At these barrows the prices\r\nrun from 1_d._ to 1_s._\r\n\r\nThe practice of selling by commission, the same as I have shown\r\nto prevail among the costers, exists among the miscellaneous\r\ndealers of whom I am treating, who are known among street-folk as\r\n“swag-barrowmen,” or, in the popular ellipsis, “penny swags;” the word\r\n“swag” meaning, as I before showed, a collection--a lot.\r\n\r\nThe “swag-men” are often confounded with the “lot-sellers”; so that I\r\nproceed to show the difference.\r\n\r\nThe _Lot-Sellers_ proper, are those who vend a variety of small\r\narticles, or “a lot,” all for 1_d._ A “lot” frequently consists of a\r\nsheet of songs, a Chinese puzzle, a 5_l._ note (Bank of Elegance),\r\nan Exhibition snuff-box (containing 6 spoons), a half jack (half\r\nsovereign), a gold ring, a silver ring, and a chased keeper with rose,\r\nthistle, and shamrock on it. The lots are diversified with packs of\r\na few cards, little pewter ornaments, boxes of small wooden toys,\r\nshirt-buttons, baby thimbles, beads, tiny scent bottles, and such like.\r\n\r\nThe “penny apiece” or “swag” trade, as contradistinguished from the\r\n“penny lots” vended by the lot-sellers, was originated by a man who,\r\nsome 19 years ago, sold a variety of trifles from a tea-tray in\r\nPetticoat-lane. My informant had heard him say--for the original “penny\r\napiece” died four years ago--that he did it to get rid of the odds and\r\nends of his stock. The system, however, at once attracted popularity,\r\nand the fortunate street-seller prospered and “died worth money.” At\r\nthat period penny goods (excepting such things as sweet-stuffs, pastry,\r\n&c.) were far less numerous in the streets, and yet I have never met\r\nwith an old street-trader (a statement fully borne out by old and\r\nintelligent mechanics) who did not pronounce spare pennies to be far\r\nmore abundant in those days among the poorer and even middle classes.\r\nThere were, moreover, far fewer street chapmen, so that this novel mode\r\nof business had every chance to thrive.\r\n\r\nThe origin of “lot-selling,” or selling “penny lots” instead of penny\r\narticles, was more curious. It was commenced by an ingenious Swiss (?)\r\n(about a year after the “penny apiece” trade), known in the street\r\ncircles as “Swede.” He was a refugee, a Roman Catholic, and a hot\r\npolitician. He spoke and understood English well, but had no sympathy\r\nwith the liberal parties in this country. “He was a republican,”\r\nhe would say, “and the Chartists were only milk and water.” When\r\nhe established his lot-selling he used to place to his mouth an\r\ninstrument, which was described to me as “like a doubled card,” and\r\nplay upon it very finely. This would attract a crowd, and he would then\r\naddress them in good English, but with a slight foreign accent: “My\r\nfrents; come to me, and I will show you my musical instruments, which\r\nwill play Italian, Swiss, French, Scotch, Irish, or any tunes. And here\r\nyou see beautiful cheap lots of useful tings, and elegant tings. A\r\npenny a lot, a penny a lot!” The arrangement of the “lots” was similar\r\nto what it is at present, but the components of the pennyworth were\r\nfar less numerous. This man carried on a good trade in London for two\r\nor three years, and then applied his industry to a country more than\r\na town career. He died about five or six years ago, at his abode in\r\nFashion-street, Spitalfields, “worth money.” At the time of his decease\r\nhe was the proprietor of two lodging-houses; one in Spitalfields, the\r\nother in Birmingham, both I am told, well conducted; the charge was\r\n4_d._ a night. He did not reside in either, but employed “deputies.”\r\nI may observe that he sold his “musical instruments,” also, at 1_d._\r\neach, but the sale was insignificant. “Only himself seemed master\r\nof ’em,” said one man; “with other people they were no better nor a\r\nJew’s-harp.”\r\n\r\nOf the “penny apiece” street-vendors, there are about 300 in London;\r\n250 having barrows, and 50 stalls or pitches on the ground. Some even\r\nsell at “a halfpenny apiece,” but chiefly to get rid of inferior wares,\r\nor when “cracked up,” and unable to “spring” a better stock. The\r\nbarrows are 7 feet by 3; are well built in general, and cost 50_s._\r\neach. These barrows, when fully stocked, are very heavy (about 4 cwt.),\r\nso that it requires a strong man to propel one any distance, and though\r\noccasionally the man’s wife officiates as the saleswoman, there is\r\nalways a man connected with the business. In my description of a stock\r\nof penny goods, I have mentioned that there were 225 articles; these\r\nwere counted on a barrow in a street near the Brill--but probably on\r\nanother occasion (when there appeared a better chance of selling) there\r\nmight be 500 articles, such things as rings and the like admitting of\r\nbeing stowed by the hundred in very small compass. The great display,\r\nhowever, is only on the occasion of holidays, or “when a man starts\r\nand wants to stun you with a show.” At Maidstone Fair the other day,\r\na London street-seller, rather well to do, sold his entire stock of\r\npenny articles to a shopkeeper of the town, and when counted there were\r\nexactly fifteen gross, or 2160 “pieces” as they are sometimes called.\r\nThese, vended at 1_d._ each, would realize just 9_l._, and would cost,\r\nwholesale, about 6_l._, or for ready money, at the swag-shops, where\r\nthey may be bought, from 10_s._ to 20_s._ less, according to the\r\nbargaining powers of the buyer. The man’s reason for selling was that\r\nthe Fair was “no good;” that is to say, the farmers had no money, and\r\ntheir labourers received only 7_s._ a week, so there was no demand;\r\nthe swag-seller, therefore, rather than incur the trouble and expense\r\nof having to carry his wares back to London, sold at a loss to a\r\nshopkeeper in Maidstone, who wanted a stock.\r\n\r\nThe swag-barrowmen selling on commission have 3_s._ in every 20_s._\r\nworth of goods that they sell. The commission may average from 9_s._ to\r\n12_s._ a week in tolerable weather, but as in bad, and especially in\r\nfoggy weather, the trade cannot be prosecuted at all, 7_s._ 6_d._ may\r\nbe the highest average, or 10_s._ the year through.\r\n\r\nThe character of the penny swag-men belongs more to that of the\r\ncostermongers than to any other class of street-folk. Many of them\r\ndrink as freely as their means will permit. I was told of a match\r\nbetween a teetotaller and a beer-drinker, about nine years ago. It was\r\nfor 5_s._ a side, and the “Championship.” Each man started with an\r\nequal stock, alike in all respects, but my informant had forgotten the\r\nprecise number of articles. They pattered, twenty-five yards apart one\r\nfrom another, three hours in James-street, Covent-garden; three hours\r\nin the Blackfriars-road; and three hours in Deptford. The teetotaller\r\nwas “sold out” in seven-and-a-half hours; while his opponent--and\r\nthe contest seems to have been carried on very good-humouredly--at\r\nthe nine hours’ end, had four dozen articles left, and was rather\r\nexhausted, or, as it was described to me, “told out.” The result,\r\nalbeit, was not looked upon, I was assured, as anything very decisive\r\nof the relative merits of beer or water, as the source of strength or\r\ninspiration of “patter.” The teetotaller was the smarter, though he\r\ndid not appear the stronger, man; he abandoned the championship, and\r\nwent into another trade four years ago. The patter of the swag-men has\r\nnothing of the humour of the paper-workers; it is merely declaratory\r\nthat the extensive stock offered on such liberal terms to the public\r\nwould furnish a wholesale shop; that such another opportunity for cheap\r\npennyworths could never by any possibility occur again, and that it was\r\na duty on all who heard the patterer to buy at once.\r\n\r\nThe men having their own barrows or stalls (but the stall-trade is\r\nsmall) buy their goods as they find their stock needs replenishment at\r\nthe swag-shops. “It was a good trade at first, sir,” said one man, “and\r\nfor its not being a good trade now, we may partly blame one another.\r\nThere was a cutting down trade among us. Black earrings were bought at\r\n14_d._ the dozen, and sold at a loss at 1_d._ each. So were children’s\r\ntrap-bats, and monkeys up sticks, but they are now 9_d._ a dozen.\r\nSometimes, sir, as I know, the master of a swag-barrow gets served out.\r\nYou see, a man may once on a time have a good day, and take as much as\r\n2_l._ Well, next day he’ll use part of that money, and go as a penny\r\nswag on his own account; or else he’ll buy things he is sold out of,\r\nand work them on his own account on his master’s barrow. All right,\r\nsir; his master makes him a convenience for his own pocket, and so\r\nhis master may be made a convenience for the man’s. When he takes the\r\nbarrow back at the week’s end, if he’s been doing a little on his own\r\ndodge, there’s the stock, and there’s the money. It’s all right between\r\na rich man and a poor man that way; turn and turn about’s fair play.”\r\n\r\nThe lot-sellers are, when the whole body are in London, about 200\r\nin number; but they are three times as itinerant into the country\r\nas are the traders in the heavier and little portable swag-barrows.\r\nThe lot-sellers nearly all vend their goods from trays slung from\r\ntheir shoulders. The best localities for the lot-sellers are\r\nRatcliffe-highway, Commercial-road, Whitechapel, Minories, Tower-hill,\r\nTooley-street, Newington-causeway, Walworth, Blackfriars and\r\nWestminster-roads, Long-acre, Holborn, and Oxford-street. To this\r\nlist may be added the Brill, Tottenham-court-road, and the other\r\nstreet-markets, on Saturday evenings, when some of these places are\r\nalmost impassable. The best places for the swag-barrow trade are also\r\nthose I have specified. Their customers, alike for the useful and fancy\r\narticles, are the working-classes, and the chief sale is on Saturdays\r\nand Mondays. One swag-man told me that he thought he could sell better\r\nif he had a less crowded barrow, but his master was so keen of money\r\nthat he _would_ make him try everything. It made selling more tiresome,\r\ntoo, he said, for a poor couple who had a penny or two to lay out would\r\nfix on half the things they saw, and change them for others, before\r\nthey parted with their money.\r\n\r\nOf the penny-a-piece sellers trading on their own account, the receipts\r\nmay be smaller than those of the men who work the huge swag-barrows\r\non commission, but their profits are greater. Calculating that 100 of\r\nthese traders are, the year round, in London (some are absent all the\r\nsummer at country fairs, and on any favourable opportunity, while a\r\nnumber of swag-barrowmen leave that employment for costermongering on\r\ntheir own account), and that each takes 2_l._ weekly, we find no less\r\nthan 10,400_l._ thus expended in the streets of London in a year.\r\n\r\nThe lot-sellers also resort largely to the country, and frequently try\r\nother callings, such as the sale of fruit, medals, &c. Some also sell\r\nlots only on Saturday and Monday nights. Taking these deductions into\r\nconsideration, it may be estimated that only fifty men (there is but\r\none female lot-seller on her own account) carry on the trade, presuming\r\nit to be spread over the six days of the week. Each of them may take\r\n13_s._ weekly (with a profit of 7_s._ 6_d._), so showing the street\r\noutlay to be 1,690_l._ The “lots” are bought at the German and English\r\nswag-shops; the principal supply, however, is procured from Black Tom\r\nin Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF ROULETTE BOXES.\r\n\r\nIn my account of the street-trade in “China ornaments” I had occasion\r\nto mention a use to which a roulette box, or portable roulette table,\r\nwas put. I need only repeat in this place that the box (usually of\r\nmahogany) contains a board, with numbered partitions, which is set\r\nspinning, by means of a central knob, on a pivot; the lid is then\r\nplaced on the box, a pea is slipped through a hole in the lid, and\r\non the number of the partition in which the pea is found deposited,\r\nwhen the motion has ceased, depends the result. The table, or board,\r\nis thus adapted for the determination of that mode of raising money,\r\npopular among costermongers and other street-folk, who in their very\r\ncharities crave some excitement; I mean a “raffle;” or it may be used\r\nfor play, by one or more persons, the highest number “spun” determining\r\nthe winner. These street-sold tables may still be put to another use:\r\nIn the smaller sort, “going no higher than fourteen,” one division\r\nis blank. Thus any one may play against another, or several others\r\nspinning in turns, the “blank” being a chance in the “banker’s” favour.\r\nSome of the tables, however, are numbered as high as 36, or as a seller\r\nof them described it, “single and double zero, bang; a French game.”\r\n\r\nThis curious street-trade has been carried on for seven years, but\r\nwith frequent interruptions, by one man, who, until within these\r\nfew weeks, was the sole trader in the article. There are now but\r\ntwo selling roulette-boxes at all regularly. The long-established\r\nsalesman wears mustachios, and has a good deal the look of a foreigner.\r\nDuring his seven years’ experience he has sold, he calculates, 12,000\r\nroulette-boxes, at a profit of from 175_l._ to 200_l._ The prices\r\n(retail) are from 1_s._ to 2_l._, at which high amount my informant\r\nonce disposed of “a roulette” in the street. He has sold, however, more\r\nat 1_s._ than at all other rates together. The “shilling roulette” is\r\nabout three inches in diameter; the others proportionately larger.\r\nThese wares are German made, bought at a swag-shop, and retailed at a\r\nprofit of from 15 to 33 per cent. They are carried in a basket, one\r\nbeing held for public examination in the vendor’s hand.\r\n\r\n“My best customers,” said the experienced man in the business, “are\r\nstock-brokers, travellers, and parsons; people that have spare time on\r\ntheir hands. O, I mean by ‘travellers,’ gentlemen going on a railway\r\nwho pass the time away at roulette. Now and then a regular ‘leg,’ when\r\nhe’s travelling to Chester, York, or Doncaster, to the races, may draw\r\nother passengers into play, and make a trifle, or not a trifle, by it;\r\nor he will play with other legs; but it’s generally for amusement,\r\nI’ve reason to believe. Friends travelling together play for a trifle\r\nto pass away time, or who shall pay for breakfasts for two, or such\r\nlike. I supplied one gaming-house with a large roulette-table made\r\nof a substance that if you throw it into water--and there’s always\r\na pail of ‘tepid’ ready--would dissolve very quickly. When it’s not\r\nused it’s hung against the wall and is so made that it looks to be\r\nan oil-painting framed. It cost them 10_l._ I suppose I have the\r\n‘knock’ of almost every gaming-house in London. There’s plenty of them\r\nstill. The police can drive such as me about in the streets or out of\r\nthe streets to starve, but lords, and gentlemen, and some parsons,\r\nI know, go to the gaming-houses, and when one’s broke into by the\r\nofficers--it’s really funny--John Smith, and Thomas Jones, and William\r\nBrown are pulled up, but as no gaming implements are found, there’s\r\nnothing against them. Some of these houses are never noticed for a long\r\ntime. The ‘Great Nick’ hasn’t been, nor the ‘Little Nick.’ I don’t\r\nknow why they’re called ‘Nicks,’ those two; but so they are. Perhaps\r\nafter Old Nick. At the Great Nick I dare say there’s often 1000_l._\r\ndepending. But the Little Nick is what we call only ‘brown papermen,’\r\nlow gamblers--playing for pence, and 1_s._ being a great go. I wonder\r\nthe police allow _that_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF POISON FOR RATS.\r\n\r\nThe number of Vermin-Destroyers and Rat-Catchers who ply their\r\navocation in London has of late years become greatly diminished.\r\nOne cause which I heard assigned for this was that many ruinous old\r\nbuildings and old streets had been removed, and whole colonies of rats\r\nhad been thereby extirpated. Another was that the race of rat-catchers\r\nhad become distrusted, and had either sought some other mode of\r\nsubsistence, or had resorted to other fields for the exercise of their\r\nprofessional labours.\r\n\r\nThe rat-catcher’s dress is usually a velveteen jacket, strong\r\ncorduroy trowsers, and laced boots. Round his shoulder he wears an\r\noil-skin belt, on which are painted the figures of huge rats, with\r\nfierce-looking eyes and formidable whiskers. His hat is usually glazed\r\nand sometimes painted after the manner of his belt. Occasionally--and\r\nin the country far more than in town--he carries in his hand an iron\r\ncage in which are ferrets, while two or three crop-eared rough terriers\r\ndog his footsteps. Sometimes a tamed rat runs about his shoulders and\r\narms, or nestles in his bosom or in the large pockets of his coat. When\r\na rat-catcher is thus accompanied, there is generally a strong aromatic\r\nodour about him, far from agreeable; this is owing to his clothes\r\nbeing rubbed with oil of thyme and oil of aniseed, mixed together.\r\nThis composition is said to be so attractive to the sense of the rats\r\n(when used by a man who understands its due apportionment and proper\r\napplication) that the vermin have left their holes and crawled to the\r\nmaster of the powerful spell. I heard of one man (not a rat-catcher\r\nprofessionally) who had in this way tamed a rat so effectually that\r\nthe animal would eat out of his mouth, crawl upon his shoulder to be\r\nfed, and then “smuggle into his bosom” (the words of my informant) “and\r\nsleep there for hours.” The rat-catchers have many wonderful stories\r\nof the sagacity of the rat, and though in reciting their own feats,\r\nthese men may not be the most trustworthy of narrators, any work on\r\nnatural history will avouch that rats _are_ sagacious, may be trained\r\nto be very docile, and are naturally animals of great resources in all\r\nstraits and difficulties.\r\n\r\nOne great source of the rat-catcher’s employment and emolument thirty\r\nyears ago, or even to a later period, is now comparatively a nonentity.\r\nAt that time the rat-catcher or killer sometimes received a yearly or\r\nquarterly stipend to keep a London granary clear of rats. I was told\r\nby a man who has for twenty-eight years been employed about London\r\ngranaries, that he had never known a rat-catcher employed in one except\r\nabout twenty or twenty-two years ago, and that was in a granary by\r\nthe river-side. The professional man, he told me, certainly poisoned\r\nmany rats, “which stunk so,” continued my informant--but then all\r\nevil odours in old buildings are attributed to dead rats--“that it\r\nwas enough to infect the corn. He poisoned two fine cats as well. But\r\nI believe he was a young hand and a bungler.” The rats, after these\r\nmeasures had been taken, seem to have deserted the place for three\r\nweeks or a month, when they returned in as great numbers as ever;\r\nnor were their ravages and annoyances checked until the drains were\r\naltered and rebuilt. It is in the better disposition of the drains of a\r\ncorn-magazine, I am assured, that the great check upon the inroads of\r\nthese “varmint” is attained--by strong mason work and by such a series\r\nand arrangement of grates, as defy even the perseverance of a rat.\r\nOtherwise the hordes which prey upon the garbage in the common sewers,\r\nare certain to find their way into the granary along the drains and\r\nchannels communicating with those sewers, and will increase rapidly\r\ndespite the measures of the rat-catcher.\r\n\r\nThe same man told me that he had been five or six times applied to\r\nby rat-catchers, and with liberal offers of beer, to allow them to\r\ntry and capture the black rats in the granary. One of these traders\r\ndeclared that he wanted them “for a gent as vas curous in them there\r\nhinteresting warmint.” But from the representations of the other\r\napplicants, my informant was convinced that they were wanted for\r\nrat-hunts, the Dog Billy being backed for 100_l._ to kill so many rats\r\nin so many minutes. “You see, sir,” the corn merchant’s man continued,\r\n“ours is an old concern, and there’s black rats in it, great big\r\nfellows; some of ’em must be old, for they’re as white about the muzzle\r\nas is the Duke of Wellington, and they have the character of being very\r\nstrong and very fierce. One of the catchers asked me if I knew what a\r\nstunning big black rat would weigh, as if I weighed rats! I always told\r\nthem that I cared nothing about rat-hunts and that I knew our people\r\nwouldn’t like to be bothered; and they was gentlemen that didn’t admire\r\nsporting characters.”\r\n\r\nThe black rat, I may observe, or the English rat, is now comparatively\r\nscarce, while the brown, or Hanoverian, rat is abundant. This brown\r\nrat seems to have become largely domiciled in England about the period\r\nof the establishment of the Hanoverian dynasty; whence its name. “A\r\nHanover rat” was a term of reproach applied by the Jacobites to the\r\nsuccessful party.\r\n\r\nThe rat-catchers are also rat-killers. They destroy the animals\r\nsometimes by giving them what is called in the trade “an alluring\r\npoison.” Every professional destroyer, or capturer, of rats will\r\npretend that as to poison he has his own particular method--his\r\nsecret--his discovery. But there is no doubt that arsenic is the\r\nbasis of all their poisons. Its being inodorous, and easily reducible\r\nto a soft fine powder, renders it the best adapted for mixing with\r\nanything of which rats are fond--toasted cheese, or bacon, or fried\r\nliver, or tallow, or oatmeal. Much as the poisoner may be able to\r\ntempt the animal’s appetite, he must, and does, proceed cautiously.\r\nIf the bait be placed in an unwonted spot, it is often untouched. If\r\nit be placed where rats have been accustomed to find their food, it\r\nis often devoured. But even then it is frequently accounted best to\r\nleave the bait unpoisoned for the first night; so that a hungry animal\r\nmay attack it greedily the second. With oatmeal it is usual to mix for\r\nthe first and even second nights a portion of pounded white sugar. If\r\nthis be eaten it accustoms the jealous pest to the degree of sweetness\r\ncommunicated by arsenic. The “oatmeal poison” is, I am told, the most\r\neffectual; but even when mixed only with sugar it is often refused; as\r\n“rats is often better up to a dodge nor Kirstians” (Christians).\r\n\r\nAnother mode of killing rats is for the professional destroyer to slip\r\na ferret into the rats’ haunts wherever it is practicable. The ferret\r\nsoon dislodges them, and as they emerge for safety they are seized by\r\nterriers, who, after watching the holes often a long time, and very\r\npatiently, and almost breathlessly, throttle them silently, excepting\r\nthe short squeak, or half-squeak, of the rat, who, by a “good dog,” is\r\nseized unerringly by the part of the back where the terrier’s gripe and\r\nshake is speedy death; if the rat still move, or shows signs of life,\r\nthe well-trained rat-killer’s dog cracks the vermin’s skull between his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nIf the rats have to be taken alive, they are either trapped, so as not\r\nto injure them for a rat-hunt (or the procedure in the pit would be\r\naccounted “foul”), or if driven out of their holes by ferrets, they\r\ncan only run into some cask, or other contrivance, where they can be\r\nsecured for the “sportsman’s” purposes. Although any visible injury\r\nto the body of the rat will prevent its reception into a pit, the\r\ncreatures’ teeth are often drawn, and with all the cruelty of a rough\r\nawkwardness, by means of pinchers, so that they may be unable to bite\r\nthe puppies being trained for the pit on the rats. If the vermin be\r\nnot truly seized by the dog, the victim will twist round and inflict a\r\ntremendous bite on his worrier, generally on the lip. This often causes\r\nthe terrier to drop his prey with a yell, and if a puppy he may not\r\nforget the lesson from the sharp nip of the rat. To prevent this it is\r\nthat the rat-catchers play the dentist on their unfortunate captives.\r\n\r\nI heard many accounts of the “dodges” practised by, or imputed to,\r\nthe rat-catchers: that it was not a very unusual thing to deposit\r\nhere and there a dead rat, when those vermin were to be poisoned on\r\nany premises; it is then concluded that the good poison has done its\r\ngood work, and the dead animal supplies an ocular demonstration of\r\nprofessional skill. These men, also, I am informed, let loose live\r\nrats in buildings adapted for the purpose, and afterwards apply for\r\nemployment to destroy them.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the principal scene of the rat-catcher’s labours\r\nin London is at the mews, and in private stables, coach-houses, and\r\nout-buildings. It is probable that the gentlemen’s servants connected\r\nwith such places like the excitement of rat-hunting, and so encourage\r\nthe profession which supplies them with that gratification. In these\r\nplaces such labours are often necessary as well as popular; for I was\r\ninformed by a coachman, then living with his family in a West End mews,\r\nand long acquainted with the mews in different parts of town, that the\r\ndrainage was often very defective, and sanitary regulations--except,\r\nperhaps, as regarded the horses--little cared for. Hence rats abounded,\r\nand were with difficulty dislodged from their secure retreats in the\r\nill-constructed drains and kennels.\r\n\r\nThe great sale of the rat-catchers is to the shops supplying “private\r\nparties” with rats for the amusement of seeing them killed by dogs.\r\nWith some “fast” men, one of these shopkeepers told me, it was a\r\nfavourite pastime in their own rooms on the Sunday mornings. It is,\r\nhowever, somewhat costly if carried on extensively, as the retail\r\ncharge from the shops is 6_d._ per rat. The price from the catcher to\r\nthe dealer is from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 7_s._ the dozen. Rats, it appears,\r\nare sometimes scarce, and then the shopkeeper must buy, “to keep up his\r\nconnection,” at enhanced cost. One large bird-seller, who sold also\r\nplain and fancy rats, white mice, and live hedgehogs, told me that he\r\nhad, last winter, been compelled to give 7_s._ a dozen for his vermin\r\nand sell them at 6_d._ each.\r\n\r\nThe grand consumption of rats, however, is in Bunhill-row, at a\r\npublic-house kept by a pugilist. A rat-seller told me that from 200 to\r\n500 rats were killed there weekly, the weekly average being, however,\r\nonly the former number; while at Easter and other holidays, it is not\r\nuncommon to see bills posted announcing the destruction of 500 rats on\r\nthe same day and in a given time, admittance 6_d._ Dogs are matched\r\nat these and similar places, as to which kills the greatest number of\r\nthese animals in the shortest time. I am told that there are forty such\r\nplaces in London, but in some only the holiday times are celebrated\r\nin this small imitation of the beast combats of the ancients. There\r\nis, too, a frequent abandonment of the trade in consequence of its\r\n“not paying,” and perhaps it may be fair to estimate that the average\r\nconsumption of this vermin-game does not exceed, in each of these\r\nplaces, 20 a week, or 1040 in a year; giving an aggregate--over and\r\nabove those consumed in private sport--of 52,000 rats in a year, or\r\n1000 a week in public amusement alone.\r\n\r\nTo show the nature of the sport of rat-catching, I print the following\r\nbill, of which I procured two copies. The words and type are precisely\r\nthe same in each, but one bill is printed on good and the other on very\r\nindifferent paper, as if for distribution among distinct classes. The\r\nconcluding announcement, as to the precise moment at which killing\r\nwill commence, reads supremely business-like:--\r\n\r\n  RATTING FOR THE MILLION!\r\n\r\n  A SPORTING GENTLEMAN, Who is a Staunch\r\n  Supporter of the destruction of these VERMIN\r\n  WILL GIVE A\r\n  GOLD REPEATER\r\n  WATCH,\r\n  TO BE KILLED FOR BY\r\n  _DOGS Under 13-3/4lbs. Wt.\r\n  15 RATS EACH!_\r\n  TO COME OFF AT JEMMY MASSEY’S,\r\n  KING’S HEAD,\r\n  COMPTON ST., SOHO,\r\n  _On Tuesday, May 20, 1851._\r\n\r\n ☞ To be Killed in a Large Wire Pit. A chalk Circle to be drawn in the\r\n centre for the Second.--Any Man touching Dog or Rats, or acting in any\r\n way unfair his dog will be disqualified.\r\n\r\n  TO GO TO SCALE AT Half past 7 KILLING TO\r\n  COMMENCE At Half past 8 PRECISELY.\r\n\r\nA dealer in live animals told me that there were several men who\r\nbrought a few dozens of rats, or even a single dozen, from the country;\r\nmen who were not professionally rat-catchers, but worked in gardens,\r\nor on farms, and at their leisure caught rats. Even some of the London\r\nprofessional rat-catchers work sometimes as country labourers, and\r\ntheir business is far greater, in merely rat-catching or killing, in\r\nthe country than in town. From the best information I could command,\r\nthere are not fewer than 2000 rats killed, for sport, in London weekly,\r\nor 104,000 a year, including private and public sport, for private\r\nsport in this pursuit goes on uninterruptedly; the public delectation\r\ntherein is but periodical.\r\n\r\nThis calculation is of course exclusive of the number of rats _killed_\r\nby the profession, “on the premises,” when these men are employed to\r\n“clear the premises of vermin.”\r\n\r\nThere are, I am told, 100 rat-catchers resorting, at intervals, to\r\nLondon, but only a fourth of that number can be estimated as carrying\r\non their labours regularly in town, and their average earnings, I am\r\nassured, do not exceed 15_s._ a week; being 975_l._ a year for London\r\nmerely.\r\n\r\nThese men have about them much of the affected mystery of men who are\r\nengaged on the turf. They have their “secrets,” make or pretend to\r\n“make their books” on rat fights and other sporting events; are not\r\naverse to drinking, and lead in general irregular lives. They are\r\nusually on intimate terms with the street dog-sellers (who are much\r\nof the same class). Many of the rat-catchers have been brought up in\r\nstables, and there is little education among them. When in London, they\r\nare chiefly to be found in Whitechapel, Westminster, and Kent-street,\r\nBorough; the more established having their own rooms; the others\r\nliving in the low lodging-houses. None of them remain in London the\r\nentire year.\r\n\r\nThese men also sell rat-poison (baked flour or oatmeal sometimes) in\r\ncakes, arsenic being the ingredient. The charge is from 2_d._ to 1_s._,\r\n“according to the circumstances of the customer.” In like manner the\r\ncharge for “clearing a house of vermin” varies from 2_s._ to 1_l._: a\r\nvery frequent charge is 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF RHUBARB AND SPICE.\r\n\r\nFrom the street-seller whose portrait has already been given I\r\nreceived the following history. He appeared to be a very truthful and\r\nkindly-disposed old man:--\r\n\r\n“I am one native of Mogadore in Morocco. I am an Arab. I left my\r\ncountree when I was sixteen or eighteen year of age. I forget, sir.\r\nI don’t know which, about eighteen, I tink it was. My fader was like\r\nmarket man, make de people pay de toll--he rent de whole market, you\r\nsee, from de governemen, and make de people pay so much for deir\r\nstands. I can’t tell you what dey call dem dere. I couldn’t recollect\r\nwhat my fader pay for de market; but I know some of de people pay him a\r\npenny, some a ha’penny, for de stands. Dere everyting sheap, not what\r\ndey are here in England. Dey may stop all day for de toll or go when\r\nde market is over. My fader was not very rish--not very poor--he keep\r\na family. We have bread, meat, shicken, apples, grapes, all de good\r\ntings to eat, not like here--tis de sheapest countree in de world. My\r\nfader have two wifes, not at once you know, he bury de first and marry\r\nanoder. I was by second wife. He have seven shildren by her, four sons\r\nand tree daughters. By de first I tink dere was five, two sons and tree\r\ndaughters. Bless you, by de time I was born dere was great many of ’em\r\nmarried and away in de world. I don’t know where dey are now. Only one\r\nbroder I got live for what I know, wheder de oders are dead or where\r\ndey are I can’t tell. De one broder I speak of is in Algiers now; he\r\nis dealer dere. What led me to come away, you say? Like good many I\r\nwas young and foolish; like all de rest of young people, I like to\r\nsee foreign countries, but you see in my countree de governemen don’t\r\nlike de people to come away, not widout you pay so mush, so Gibraltar\r\nwas de only port I could go to, it was only one twenty miles across de\r\nwater--close to us. You see you go to Gibraltar like smuggling--you\r\nsmuggle yourself--you talk wid de Captain and he do it for you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET RHUBARB AND SPICE SELLER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n“My fader been dead years and years before I come away, I suppose I was\r\nabout ten year old when he die. I had been at school till time I was\r\ngrown up, and after dat I was shoemaker. I make de slippers. Oh yes!\r\nmy moder was alive den--she was dead when I was here in England. I get\r\nabout one penny a pair for de slippers in my countree; penny dere as\r\ngood as shilling here amost. I could make tree, four, five pair in one\r\nday. I could live on my gains den better dan what I could do here wid\r\ntwelve times as mush--dat time I could. I don’t know what it is now.\r\nYes, my moder give me leave to go where I like. She never see me since”\r\n(sighing). “Oh yes, I love her very mush. I am old man now, but I never\r\nforgot her yet;” here the old man burst into tears and buried his face\r\nin his handkerchief for several minutes. “No, no! she don’t know when\r\nI come away dat she never see me again, nor me neider. I tell I go\r\nGibraltar, and den I tell her I go to Lisbon to see my broder, who was\r\nspirit merchant dere. I didn’t say noting not at all about coming back\r\nto her, but I tought I should come back soon. If I had tought I never\r\nsee no more, not all de gold in de world take me from her. She was good\r\nmoder to me. I was de youngest but one. My broders kept my moder, you\r\nsee. Where I came from it is not like here, if only one in de family\r\nwell off, de oders never want for noting. In my country, you see, de\r\nlaw is you must maintain your fader and moder before you maintain your\r\nown family. You must keep dem in de house.” Here he repeated the law\r\nin Hebrew. “De people were Mahomedans in Mogadore, but we were Jews,\r\njust like here, you see. De first ting de Jews teesh de shildren is\r\ndeir duty to deir faders and deir moders. And dey love one anoder more\r\nthan de gold; but dey love de gold more dan most people, for you see\r\ngold is more to dem. In my countree de governemen treat de Jews very\r\nbadly, so de money all de Jews have to help dem. Often de government\r\nin my country take all deir money from de Jews, and kill dem after, so\r\nde Jews all keep deir money in secret places, put de gold in jars and\r\ndig dem in de ground, and de men worths hundreds go about wid no better\r\nclothes dan mine.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see I leave my poor moder, we kissed one anoder, and\r\ncry for half an hour, and come away to Gibraltar. When I get dere,\r\nmy broder come away from Lisbon to Gibraltar; dat time it was war\r\ntime, and de French was coming to Lisbon, so everybody run. When I\r\ncome away from Mogadore, I have about one hundred dollars--some my\r\nmoder give me, and some I had save. When I got to Gibraltar, I begin\r\nto have a little stand in de street wid silk handkershiefs, cotton\r\nhandkershiefs, shop goods you know. I do very well wid dat, so after I\r\nget licence to hawk de town, and after dat I keep shop. Altogeder, I\r\nstop in Gibraltar about six year. I had den about five or six hundred\r\ndollars. I live very well all de time I dere. I was wid my broder all\r\nde time. After I am six year in Gibraltar, I begin to tink I do better\r\nin England. I tink, like good many people, if I go to anoder part dat\r\nis risher--’t is de rishest countree in de world--I do better still.\r\nSo I start off, and get I here I tink in 1811, when de tree shilling\r\npieces first come out. I have about one hundred and tirty pound at\r\ndat time. I stop in London a good bit, and eat my money; it was most\r\ndone before I start to look for my living. I try to look what I could\r\ndo, but I was quite stranger you see. I am about fourteen or fifteen\r\nmonth before I begin to do anyting. I go to de play house; I see never\r\nsuch tings as I see here before I come. When I come here, I tink I\r\nam in heaven altogether--God a’mighty forgive me--such sops (shops)\r\nand such beautiful tings. I live in Mary Axe Parish when I first come;\r\nsame parish where I live now. Well, you see some of my countreemen den\r\ngetting good living by selling de rhubarb and spices in de street.\r\nI get to know dem all; and dat time you see was de good time, money\r\nwas plenty, like de dirt here. Dat time dere was about six or seven\r\nArabians in de street selling rhubarb and spices, five of ’em was from\r\nMogadore, and two from not far off; and dere is about five more going\r\ntroo de country. Dey all sell de same tings, merely rhubarb and spice,\r\ndat time; before den was good for tem tings--after dat dey get de silks\r\nand tings beside. I can’t tell what first make dem sell de rhubarb\r\nand de spice; but I tink it is because people like to buy de Turkey\r\nrhubarb of de men in de turbans. When I was little shild, I hear talk\r\nin Mogadore of de people of my country sell de rhubarb in de streets of\r\nLondon, and make plenty money by it.\r\n\r\n“Dere was one very old Arabian in de streets wen I first come; dey\r\ncall him Sole; he been forty year at de same business. He wear de long\r\nbeard and Turkish dress. He used to stand by Bow Shursh, Sheapside.\r\nEverybody in de street know him. He was de old establish one. He been\r\ndead now, let me see--how long he been dead--oh, dis six or seven and\r\ntwenty year. He die in Gibraltar very poor and very old--most ninety\r\nyear of age. All de rhubarb-sellers was Jews. Dere was anoder called\r\nBen Aforiat, and two broders; and anoder, his name was Azuli. One of\r\nAforiat’s broders use to stand in St. Paul’s Shurshyard. He was very\r\nwell know; all de oders hawk about de town like I do myself. Now dey\r\nall gone dead, and dere only four of us now in England; dey all in\r\nLondon, and none in de country. Two of us live in Mary Axe, anoder live\r\nin, what dey call dat--Spitalfield, and de oder in Petticoat-lane. De\r\none wat live in Spitalfield is old man, I dare say going for 70. De one\r\nin Petticoat-lane not mush above 30. I am little better dan 73, and\r\nde oder wat live in Mary Axe about 40. I been de longest of all in de\r\nstreets, about tirty-eight or tirty-nine year. All dat was here when I\r\nfirst come, die in London, except dat old man Sole wat I was telling\r\nyou of, dat die in Gibraltar. About tirteen or fourteen die since I\r\ncome to England; some die in de Hospital of de Jews at Mile End; some\r\ndie at home--not one of dem die worth no money. Six of dem was very old\r\npeople, between 60 and 70; dere was some tirty, some forty. Some of\r\ndem die by inshes. Dere was one fine fellow, he was six foot two, and\r\nstrong man, he take to his bed and fall away so; at last you see troo\r\nhis hand; he was noting but de carcase; oders die of what you call de\r\nyellow jaundice; some have de fever, but deir time was come; de death\r\nwe must be.\r\n\r\n“When I first come to dis countree me make plenty of money by selling\r\nde rhubarb in de street. Five-and-twenty year ago I make a pound a\r\nday some time. Take one week wid another, I dare say I clear, after I\r\npay all de cost of my living, tirty shillings; and now, God help me, I\r\ndon’t make not twelve shilling a week, and all my food to pay out of\r\ndat. One week wid anoder, when I go out I clear about twelve shilling.\r\nEveryting is so sheep now, and dere is so many sops (shops), people\r\nhas no money to buy tings with. I could do better when everyting was\r\ndear. I could live better, get more money, and have more for it. I\r\nhave better food, better lodging, and better clothes. I don’t know wat\r\nis de cause, as you say. I only know dat I am worse, and everybody is\r\nworse; dat is all I know. Bread is sheeper, but when it was one and\r\nninepence de loaf I could get plenty to buy it wid, but now it is five\r\npence, I can’t no five pence to have it. If de cow is de penny in de\r\nmarket what is de use of dat, if you can’t get no penny to buy him?\r\nAfter I been selling my rhubarb for two years, when I fust come here,\r\nI save about a hundred and fifty pound, and den you see I agree wid\r\ntree oder of my countrymen to take a sop (shop) in Exeter. De oder tree\r\nwas rhubarb-sellers, like myself, and have save good bit of money as\r\nwell. One have seven hundred pound; but he have brought tree or four\r\nhundred pound wid him to dis countree. Anoder of de tree have about two\r\nhundred, and de oder about one hundred; dey have all save deir money\r\nout of de rhubarb. We keep our sop, you see, about five year, and den\r\nwe fall in pieces altogeder. We take and trust, and lose all our money.\r\nT’oders never keep a sop before, and not one of us was English scholar;\r\nwe was forced to keep a man, and dat way we lose all our money, so we\r\nwas force to part, and every one go look for hisself. Den we all go\r\nselling rhubarb again about de country, and in London; and I never\r\nable to hold up my head since. When I come back to de rhubarb times is\r\ngetting bad, and I not able to save no more money. All I am worth in\r\nde world is all I got in my box, and dat altogether is not more dan\r\nten shilling. Last week I havn’t a pound of meat in de house, and I am\r\nobliged to pawn my waistcoat and handkerchief to get me some stock. It\r\neasy to put dem in, but very hard to get dem out.\r\n\r\n“I had two wives. After two or tree year when I come I marry my first.\r\nI had two shildren by my first, but both of dem die very young; one was\r\nabout five year old and de oder about tree. When I travel the countree,\r\nmy first wife she go wid me everywhere. I been to all parts--to\r\nScotland, to Wales, but not Ireland. I see enough of dem Irish in dis\r\ncountree, I do no want no more of dem dere. Not one of my countree I\r\ntink ever been to Ireland, and only one beside myself been to Scotland;\r\nbut dat no use, de Scotsh don’t know wat de spice is. All de time I am\r\nin Scotland I can’t get no bread, only barley and pea meal, and dat as\r\nsour as de winegar--and I can’t get no flour to make none too--so I\r\nbegin to say, by God I come to wrong countree here. When I go across\r\nde countree of England I never live in no lodging-houses--always in de\r\npublic--because you see I do business dere; de missus perhaps dere buy\r\nmy spices of me. I lodge once in Taunton, at a house where a woman keep\r\na lodging-house for de Jewish people wat go about wid de gold tings--de\r\njewellery. At oder towns I stop at de public, for dere is de company,\r\nand I sell my tings.\r\n\r\n“I buy my rhubarb and my spice of de large warehouse for de drugs;\r\nsometime I buy it of my countreemen. We all of us know de good spice\r\nfrom de bad. You look! I will show you how to tell de good nutmeg from\r\nde bad. Here is some in de shell: you see, I put de strong pin in one\r\nand de oil run out; dat is because dey has not been put in de spirit\r\nto take away de oil for to make de extract. Now, in de bad nutmeg all\r\nde oil been took out by de spirit, and den dere is no flavour, like\r\ndose you buy in de sheep sops (cheap shops). I sell de Rhubarb, East\r\nIndy and Turkey, de Cloves, Cinnamons, Mace, Cayenne Pepper, White\r\nPepper--a little of all sorts when I get de money to buy it wid. I take\r\nmy solemn oat I never sheat in scales nor weight; because de law is,\r\n‘take weight and give weight,’ dat is judge and justice. Dere is no\r\nluck in de sort weight--no luck at all. Never in my life I put no tings\r\nwid my goods. I tell you de troot, I grind my white pepper wid my own\r\nhands, but I buy me ginger ground, and _dat_ is mixed I know. I tink\r\nit is pea flour dey put wid it, dere is no smell in dat, but it is de\r\nsame colour--two ounces of ginger will give de smell to one pound of\r\npea flour. De public-houses _will_ have de sheap ginger and dat I buy.\r\nI tell you de troot. How am I tell what will become of me. Dat is de\r\nAlmighty’s work” (here he pointed to Heaven). “De Jews is very good to\r\ndeir old people. If it was not for my old woman I be like a gentleman\r\nnow in de hospital at Mile End; but you see, I marry de Christian\r\nwoman, and dat is against our people--and I would never leave her--no\r\nnot for all de good in de world to come to myself. If I am poor, I not\r\nde only one. In de holiday times I send a petition, and perhaps dere\r\nis five shillings for me from de hospital. In de Jews’ Hospital dere\r\nis only ten--what you call de Portuguese Jews. We have hospital to our\r\nownselves. Dere de old people--dey are all above sixty--are all like\r\nnoblemen, wid good clothes, plenty to eat, go where you like, and pipe\r\nof tobacco when you want. But I wont go in no hospital away from my old\r\nwoman. I will get a bit of crust for her as long as I can stand--but I\r\ncan hardly do that now. Every one got his feeling, and I will feel for\r\nher as long as I live. When dere is de weather I have de rheumatis--oh!\r\nvery bad--sometime I can scarcely stand or walk. I am seventy-tree, and\r\nit is a sad time for me now. I am merry sometime tho’. Everyting wid de\r\npocket. When de pocket is merry, den I am merry too. Sometime I go home\r\nwid one shilling, and den I tink all gets worse and worse, and what\r\nwill become of me I say--but dat is de Almighty’s work, and I trust in\r\nhim. Can I trust any better one? Sometime I say I wish I was back in\r\nmy countree--and I tink of my poor moder wat is dead now, and den I am\r\nvery sad. Oh yes, bless your heart, very sad indeed!”\r\n\r\nThe old man appears to sell excellent articles, and to be a very\r\ntruthful, fair-dealing man.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HAWKING OF TEA.\r\n\r\n“Persons hawking tea without a licence” (_see_ Chitty’s Edition of\r\n“Burn’s Justice,” vol. ii. p. 1113) “are liable to a penalty, under 50\r\nGeo. III., cap. 41.; and, even though they had a licence, they would be\r\nliable to a penalty for selling tea in an unentered place.” The penalty\r\nunder this act is 10_l._, but the prohibition in question has long been\r\ncommonly, if not very directly, evaded.\r\n\r\nThe hawking of tea in London cannot be considered as immediately a\r\nstreet-trade, but it is in some respects blended with street callings\r\nand street traffic, so that a brief account is necessary.\r\n\r\nI will first give a short history of what is, or was, more intimately a\r\nportion of the street-trade.\r\n\r\nUntil about eight or ten years ago, tea was extensively hawked--from\r\nhouse to house almost--“on tally.” The tally system is, that wherein\r\n“weekly payments” are taken in liquidation of the cost of the article\r\npurchased, and the trade is one embodying much of evil and much of\r\ntrickery. At the present time the tallymen are very numerous in London,\r\nand in the tally trade there are now not less than 1000 hawkers of,\r\nor travellers in, tea; but they carry on their business principally\r\nin the suburbs. When I come to treat of the class whom I have called\r\n“distributors,” I shall devote an especial inquiry to the tally\r\ntrade, including, of course, the tea trade. Mr. M’Culloch mentions\r\nthat a Scotchman’s “tally-walk”--and the majority of the tallymen are\r\nScotchmen--is worth 15 per cent. more than an Englishman’s.\r\n\r\nThe branch of the tea trade closely connected with the street business\r\nis that in tea-leaves. The exhausted leaves of the tea-pot are\r\npurchased of servants or of poor women, and they are made into “new”\r\ntea. One gentleman--to whose information, and to the care he took\r\nto test the accuracy of his every statement, I am bound to express\r\nmy acknowledgments--told me that it would be fair to reckon that in\r\nLondon 1500 lbs. of tea-leaves were weekly converted into new tea, or\r\n78,000 lbs. in the year! One house is known to be very extensively\r\nand profitably concerned in this trade, or rather _manufacture_, and\r\non my asking the gentleman who gave me the information if the house\r\nin question (he told me the name) was accounted respectable by their\r\nfellow-citizens, the answer was at once, “_Highly_ respectable.”\r\n\r\nThe _old_ tea-leaves, to be converted into _new_, are placed by the\r\nmanufacturers on hot plates, and are re-dried and _re-dyed_. To give\r\nthe “green” hue, a preparation of copper is used. For the “black” no\r\ndye is necessary in the generality of cases. This tea-manufacture is\r\nsold to “cheap” or “slop” shopkeepers, both in town and country, and\r\nespecially for hawking in the country, and is almost always sold ready\r\nmixed.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of sloe-leaves, &c., which used to be gathered for the\r\nadulteration of tea, is now unknown, and has been unknown since tea\r\nbecame cheaper, but the old tea-leaf trade, I am assured, carried on\r\nso quietly and cleverly, that the most vigilant excise-officers are\r\ncompletely in the dark; a smaller “tea-maker” was, however, fined for\r\ntea-leaf conversion last year.\r\n\r\nInto this curious question, concerning the purposes for which the old\r\ntea-leaves are now purchased by parties in the street, I shall enter\r\nsearchingly when I treat of the _street-buyers_. The information I\r\nhave already received is of great curiosity and importance, nor shall\r\nI suppress the names of those dishonest traders who purchase the old\r\ndried tea-leaves, as a means of cheating their customers.\r\n\r\nInto the statistics of this strange trade I will not now enter, but\r\nI am informed that great quantities of tea-leaves are sent from the\r\ncountry to London. Perhaps of the 1500 lbs. weekly manufactured, three\r\nquarters may be collected in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nI may here add, that the great bulk of the tea _now_ hawked throughout\r\nthe metropolis is supplied from the handsome cars, or vans, of\r\nwell-known grocers and tea-dealers. Of these--it was computed for\r\nme--there are, on no day, fewer than 100 in the streets of London, and\r\nof its contiguous and its more remote suburbs, such as Woolwich, and\r\neven Barnet. One tradesman has six such cars. The tea is put up in bags\r\nof 7, 14, and 21 lbs., duly apportioned in quarter, half, and whole\r\npounds; a quarter of a pound being the smallest quantity vended in\r\nthis manner. The van and its contents are then entrusted to a driver,\r\nwho has his regular round, and very often his regular customers. The\r\ncustomers purchase the tea from their faith in the respectability of\r\nthe firm--generally well known through extensive advertising. The teas\r\n_are_ supplied by the house which is pronounced to supply them; for the\r\ntradesman is the capitalist in the matter, his carman is the labourer,\r\nand the house is responsible for the quality of the article. When a new\r\nconnection has to be formed, or an “old connection” to be extended,\r\ncirculars (_bonâ fide_) are sent round, and the carman afterwards\r\ncalls: and, “in some genteel streets,” I was told, “calls, oft enough,\r\nat every house, and, in many districts, at every decent-looking house\r\nin every street.” So far, then, even this part of the traffic may be\r\nconsidered one of the streets. The remuneration of the street-traveller\r\nin, or hawker of, tea, is usually 1_d._ per lb. on the lower-priced\r\nkinds, 2_d._ on the higher (but more often 1_d._) and, very rarely\r\nindeed, 3_d._ on the highest. The trade is one peculiar to great\r\ncities--and most peculiar, I am assured, to London--for the tradesman\r\ndoes not know so much as the name of his customer; nor, perhaps, does\r\nthe carman, but merely as “Number such-an-one.” The supply is for ready\r\nmoney, or, if credit be given, it is at the risk of the carman, who\r\nhas a weekly wage in addition to his perquisites. Every evening, when\r\nthe vehicle is driven back to the premises of its owner, “stock is\r\ntaken,” and the money taken by the carman--minus what may be called\r\nthe “poundage”--is paid over to the proper party.\r\n\r\nA man who had driven, or, as he called it, “managed,” one of these\r\nvans, told me that he made this way, 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a day; “but,”\r\nhe added, “if you make a good thing of it that way, you have all the\r\nless salary.” These carmen are men of good character and good address,\r\nand were described to me, by a gentleman familiar with the trade, as\r\n“of the very best class of porters.”\r\n\r\nAs this vehicular-itinerant business has now become an integral part of\r\nthe general tea-trade, I need not further dwell upon it, but reserve\r\nit until I come to treat of the shopmen of grocers and tea-dealers,\r\nand thence of the tea-trade in general. I may add, however, that the\r\ntea thus hawked is, as regards, perhaps, three-fourths of the quantity\r\nsold, known as “mixed,” and sold at 4_s._ per lb.--costing, at a\r\ntea-broker’s, from 2_s._ 11_d._ to 3_s._ 3_d._ It is announced, as to\r\nits staple or entire compound, to be “congou,” but is in reality a tea\r\nknown as “pouchong.” Some old ladies are still anxious, I was told, for\r\na cup of good strong bohea; and though bohea has been unknown to the\r\ntea-trade since the expiration of the East India Company’s Charter in\r\n1834, the accommodating street-traveller will undertake to supply the\r\ngenuine leaf to which the old lady had been so long accustomed. The\r\ngreen teas thus sold (and they are not above a fiftieth part of the\r\nother) are common twankays and common young hysons, neither of them--I\r\ncan state on excellent authority--accounted in the trade to be “true\r\nteas,” but, as in the case of some other green tea, “Canton made.” The\r\n“green” is sold from the vans generally at 4_s._ 6_d._; sometimes, but\r\nrarely, as high as 5_s._ 6_d._ What is sold at 4_s._ 6_d._ may cost, on\r\nthe average, 3_s._ 5_d._ I may add, also, that when a _good_ article\r\nis supplied, such profits in the tea-trade are not accounted at all\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nBut the more usual mode of tea hawking is by itinerant dealers who have\r\na less direct connection with the shop whereat they purchase their\r\ngoods. To this mode of obtaining a livelihood, the hawkers are invited\r\nby all the persuasive powers of advertising eloquence: “To persons in\r\nwant of a genteel and lucrative employment”--“To Gentlemen of good\r\naddress and business habits,” &c., &c. The genteel and lucrative\r\nemployment is to hawk tea under the auspices of this “company” or\r\nthe other. The nature of this business, and of the street tea-trade\r\ngenerally, is shown in the following statement:--“About twelve years\r\nago I came to London in expectation of a situation as tide-waiter;\r\nI did not succeed, however, and not being able to obtain any other\r\nemployment, and trusting to the promises of gentlemen M.P.s for too\r\nlong a time, my means were exhausted, and I was at length induced to\r\nembark in the tea business. To this I was persuaded by a few friends\r\nwho advanced me some money, considering that it would suit me well,\r\nwhile my friends would endeavour to get me a connection, that is,\r\nprocure me customers. I accordingly went to a well-known Tea Company in\r\nthe City, a firm bearing a great name. Their advertisements put forth\r\nextraordinary statements, of so many persons realizing independencies\r\nfrom selling their teas, and in very short spaces of time. I was quite\r\npleased at the prospect presented to me in such glowing terms, and,\r\ndepending not a little on my own industry and perseverance, I embraced\r\nthe opportunity and introduced myself forthwith to the Company. They\r\nadvised me in the first place to take out a licence for selling teas,\r\nto secure me against any risk of fines or forfeitures. The cost of a\r\nlicence, after payment of 2_s._ 11-1/2_d._ preliminary expenses, is\r\n11_s._ per annum, to be paid quarterly, as it becomes due, and it is\r\npaid by the Company for their agents. The licence is granted for the\r\nplace of abode of the ‘traveller,’ and strictly prohibits him from\r\nhawking or exposing his wares for sale at places other than at such\r\nplace of abode, but he may of course supply his customers where he\r\nwill, and serve them at their places of abode respectively. Everything\r\nthus prepared, I commenced operations, but soon found that this tea\r\ndealing was not so advantageous as I had anticipated. I found that\r\nthe commission allowed by the Company on cheap teas was very low. For\r\nthose generally used by the working people, ‘4_s._ tea,’ for instance,\r\nor that at 4_s._ per pound, I had to pay to the Company 3_s._ 6_d._\r\nper pound, thus allowing the travelling dealer or agent for commission\r\nonly 6_d._ in the pound, or 1-1/2_d._ per quarter. Now 80 or 100\r\ncustomers is considered a fair connection for a dealer, and allowing\r\neach customer to take a quarter of a pound at an average, 80 good\r\ncustomers at that rate would bring him 10_s._, or 100 customers 12_s._\r\n6_d._ clear profit weekly. But many customers do not require so much as\r\na quarter of a pound weekly, while others require more, so that I find\r\nit rather awkward to subdivide it in portions to suit each customer, as\r\nthe smallest quantity made at the warehouse is a quarter of a pound,\r\nand every quarter is done up in a labelled wrapper, with the price\r\nmarked on it. So that to break or disturb the package in any way might\r\ncause some customers to suspect that it had been meddled with unfairly.\r\n\r\n“Another disadvantage was in dealing with the ‘Tea Company.’ No\r\nsugars are supplied by them, which makes it more inconvenient for the\r\ntravelling dealer, as his customers find it difficult to get sugars,\r\nmost retail grocers having an objection to sell sugars to any but those\r\nwho are purchasers of teas as well. However, I was not confined to deal\r\nwith this Company, and so I tried other places, and found a City house,\r\nwhose terms were preferable. Here I could get tea for 3_s._ 3_d._,\r\nas good as that for which the Company charged 3_s._ 6_d._, besides\r\ngetting it done up to order in plain paper, and in quantities to suit\r\nevery variety of customer. There were also sugars, which must be had\r\nto accommodate the customers, at whatever trouble or inconvenience to\r\nthe traveller; for it is very lumbersome to carry about, and leaves\r\nscarcely any profit at all.\r\n\r\n“The trade is anything but agreeable, and the customers are often\r\nexacting. They seem to fancy, however cheaply and well they may be\r\nsupplied, that the tea-seller is under obligations to them; that their\r\ncustom will be the making of him, and, therefore, they expect some\r\ncompliment in return. The consequence is, that very often, unless he\r\nbe willing to be accounted a ‘shabby man,’ the tea-dealer is obliged,\r\nof a Saturday night, to treat his customers, to ensure a continuance\r\nof their custom. Other customers take care to be absent at the time\r\nhe calls. Those who are anxious to run up bills, perhaps, keep out of\r\nthe way purposely for two or more successive nights of the dealer’s\r\ncalling, who, notwithstanding, cannot very well avoid serving such\r\ncustomers. This is another evil, and if the tea-man’s capital be not\r\nsufficient to enable him to carry on the business in this manner,\r\ngiving credit (for it is unavoidable), he is very soon insolvent, and\r\ncompelled to give up the business. I had to give it up at last, after\r\nhaving carried it on for four years, leaving 8_l._ or 9_l._ due to me,\r\nin small sums, varying from 1_s._ to 10_s._, one shilling of which I\r\nnever expect to be paid. I could not have continued it so long, for my\r\nmeans would not allow me to give credit; but getting partial employment\r\nat the last-mentioned house, where I dealt, enabled me to do so. When,\r\nhowever, I got permanently employed, I grew tired of tea-dealing, and\r\ngave it up.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion the business would best suit persons casually employed,\r\nsuch as dockmen and others, who might have leisure to go about; those\r\nalso who get other commissions and hawk about other commodities, such\r\nas soft wares, might do very well by it; otherwise, in most cases, ’t\r\nis only resorted to as a make-shift where no other employment can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n“I do not know how many persons are in the trade. I have, however,\r\nheard it asserted, that there were between 4000 and 5000 persons in\r\nLondon engaged in the business, who are, with but few exceptions,\r\nScotchmen; they, of all others, manage to do the best _in this_ line.\r\n\r\n“A man, to undertake the tea business, requires a double capital,\r\nbecause in the first place, he has to purchase the tea, then he must\r\ngive credit, and be able to support himself till such time as he can\r\nget in his money. Some of the tea-dealers manage to eke out their\r\nprofits by mixing tea-leaves, which have been used, with the genuine\r\ncommodity. They spread the old tea-leaves on tins which they have for\r\nthe purpose, and, by exposing them either to the action of the air or\r\nthe heat of the fire, the leaves crisp up as they had been before they\r\nwere used, and are not distinguishable from the rest. I never vended\r\nsuch an article, and that may be one reason why I could not succeed in\r\nthe business.”\r\n\r\nI believe the career thus detailed is a common one among the hawkers\r\nof tea, or rather the “travellers” in the tea trade. Many sell it on\r\ntally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WOMEN STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS the volume is now fast drawing to a close, and a specific account\r\nhas been furnished of almost every description of street-_seller_ (with\r\nthe exception of those who are the _makers_ of the articles they vend),\r\nI purpose giving a more full and general history and classification\r\nthan I have yet done of the feminine portion of the traders in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThe women engaged in street-sale are of all ages and of nearly all\r\nclasses. They are, however, chiefly of two countries, England and\r\nIreland. There are (comparatively) a few Jewesses, and a very few\r\nScotchwomen and Welchwomen who are street-traders; and they are so, as\r\nit were, accidentally, from their connection, by marriage or otherwise,\r\nwith male street-sellers. Of foreigners there are German broom-women,\r\nand a few Italians with musical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe first broad and distinctive view of the female street-sellers, is\r\nregarding them _nationally_, that is to say, either English or Irish\r\nwomen--two classes separated by definite characteristics from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Irishwomen--to avoid burthening the reader with an excess of\r\nsubdivisions--I shall speak of generally; that is to say, as one\r\nhomogeneous class, referring those who require a more specific account\r\nto the description before given of the street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe Englishwomen selling in the streets appear to admit of being\r\narranged into four distinct groups, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. The Wives of Street-Sellers.\r\n\r\n2. Mechanics’ or Labourers’ Wives, who go out Street-Selling (while\r\ntheir husbands are at work) as a means of helping out the family income.\r\n\r\n3. Widows of former Street-Sellers.\r\n\r\n4. Single Women.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any street-trade carried on _exclusively_ by\r\nwomen. The sales in which they are principally concerned are in\r\nfish (including shrimps and oysters), fruit and vegetables (widows\r\nselling on their own account), fire-screens and ornaments, laces,\r\nmillinery, artificial flowers (but not in any great majority over\r\nthe male traders), cut flowers, boot and stay-laces and small wares,\r\nwash-leathers, towels, burnt linen, combs, bonnets, pin-cushions, tea\r\nand coffee, rice-milk, curds and whey, sheeps’-trotters, and dressed\r\nand undressed dolls.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the “heavier” trades, those necessitating the\r\ncarrying of heavy weights, or the pushing of heavily-laden barrows,\r\nare in the hands of men; and so are, even more exclusively, what may\r\nbe classed as the more skilled trades of the streets, viz. the sale of\r\nstationery, of books, of the most popular eatables and drinkables (the\r\ncoffee-stalls excepted), and in every branch dependent upon the use of\r\npatter. In such callings as root-selling, crock-bartering, table-cover\r\nselling, mats, game, and poultry, the wife is the helpmate of her\r\nhusband; if she trade separately in these things, it is because there\r\nis a full stock to dispose of, which requires the exertions of two\r\npersons, perhaps with some hired help just for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the street-traffic, as carried on by Englishwomen and\r\nIrishwomen, is marked enough. The Irishwoman’s avocations are the least\r\nskilled, and the least remunerative, but as regards mere toil, such\r\nas the carrying of a heavy burthen, are by far the most laborious. An\r\nIrishwoman, though not reared to the streets, will carry heavy baskets\r\nof oranges or apples, principally when those fruits are cheap, along\r\nthe streets while her English co-trader (if not a costermonger) may\r\nbe vending laces, millinery, artificial flowers, or other commodities\r\nof a “light,” and in some degree of street estimation a “genteel”\r\ntrade. Some of the less laborious callings, however, such as that in\r\nwash-leathers, are principally in the hands of young and middle-aged\r\nIrishwomen, while that in sheeps’-trotters, which does not entail heavy\r\nlabour, are in the hands mostly of elderly Irishwomen. The sale of such\r\nthings as lucifer-matches and water-cresses, and any “stock” of general\r\nuse, and attainable for a few pence, is resorted to by the very poor of\r\nevery class. The Irishwoman more readily unites begging with selling\r\nthan the Englishwoman, and is far more fluent and even eloquent;\r\nperhaps she pays less regard to truth, but she unquestionably pays a\r\ngreater regard to chastity. When the uneducated Irishwoman, however,\r\nhas fallen into licentious ways, she is, as I once heard it expressed,\r\nthe most “savagely wicked” of any.\r\n\r\nAfter these broad distinctions I proceed to details.\r\n\r\n1. From the best information at my command it may be affirmed that\r\nabout one-half of the women employed in the diverse trades of the\r\nstreets, are the wives or concubines (permanently or temporarily)\r\nof the men who pursue a similar mode of livelihood--the male\r\nstreet-sellers. I may here observe that I was informed by an\r\nexperienced police-officer--who judged from his personal observation,\r\nwithout any official or even systematic investigation--that the women\r\nof the town, who survived their youth or their middle age, did not\r\nresort to the sale of any commodity in the streets, but sought the\r\nshelter of the workhouse, or died, he could not tell where or under\r\nwhat circumstances. Of the verity of this statement I have no doubt, as\r\na street-sale entails some degree of industry or of exertion, for which\r\nthe life of those wretched women may have altogether unfitted them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the narratives and statements I have given, it is\r\nshown that some wives pursue one (itinerant or stationary) calling,\r\nwhile the husband pursues another. The trades in which the husband and\r\nwife (and I may here remark that when I speak of “wives,” I include\r\nall, so regarded in street life, whether legally united or not)--the\r\ntrades in which the woman is, more than in any others, literally the\r\nhelp-mate of the man, are the costermonger’s (including the flower, or\r\nroot, sellers) and the crockery-ware people. To the costermonger some\r\nhelp is often indispensable, and that of a wife is the cheapest and\r\nthe most honest (to say nothing of the considerations connected with a\r\nhome) which can be obtained. Among the more prosperous costermongers\r\ntoo, especially those who deal in fish, the wife attends to the\r\nstall while the husband goes “a round,” and thus a greater extent of\r\nbusiness is transacted. In the root and crockery-trades the woman’s\r\nassistance is necessary when barter takes place instead of sale, as\r\nthe husband may be ignorant of the value of the old female attire\r\nwhich even “high-hip ladies,” as they were described to me, loved to\r\nexchange for a fuchsia or a geranium; for a glass cream-jug or a china\r\nornament. Of the married women engaged in any street-trade, I believe\r\nnineteen-twentieths are the wives of men also pursuing some street\r\navocation.\r\n\r\n2. There are, however, large classes of female street-sellers who may\r\nbe looked upon as exceptions, the wife selling in the streets while the\r\nhusband is engaged in some manual labour, but they are only partially\r\nexceptions. In the sale of wash-leathers, for instance, are the wives\r\nof many Irish bricklayers’ labourers; the woman may be constantly\r\noccupied in disposing of her wares in the streets or suburbs, and the\r\nman labouring at any building; but in case of the deprivation of work,\r\nsuch a man will at once become a street-seller, and in the winter many\r\nburly Irish labourers sell a few nuts or “baked taties,” or a few\r\npairs of braces, or some article which seems little suitable for the\r\nemployment of men of thews and muscle. In the course of my present\r\ninquiry I have, in only very rare instances, met with a poor Irishman,\r\nwho had not a reason always at his tongue’s end to justify anything he\r\nwas doing. Ask a bricklayer’s labourer why, in his youth and strength,\r\nhe is selling nuts, and he will at once reply: “Sure thin, your honnur,\r\nisn’t it better than doin’ nothing? I must thry and make a pinny, ’til\r\nI’m in worruk again, and glory be to God, I hope that’ll be soon.”\r\n\r\nAn experienced man, who knows all the street-folk trading in\r\nWhitechapel and its neighbourhood, and about Spitalfields, told me that\r\nhe could count up 100 married women, in different branches of open-air\r\ncommerce, and of them only two had husbands who worked regularly\r\nin-doors. The husband of one woman works for a slop-tailor, the other\r\nis a bobbin turner; the tailor’s wife sells water-cresses every morning\r\nand afternoon; the turner’s wife is a “small-ware woman.” The tailor,\r\nhowever, told my informant that his eyesight was failing him, that his\r\nearnings became less and less, that he was treated like dirt, and would\r\ngo into some street-trade himself before long. When the man and his\r\nwife are both in the street-trade, it is the case in three instances\r\nout of four (excluding of course the costermongers, root-sellers, and\r\ncrock-man’s pursuits) that the couple carry on different callings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET COMB SELLER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nIn the full and specific accounts I gave of the largest body of\r\nstreet-sellers, viz., the costermongers, I showed that concubinage\r\namong persons of all ages was the rule, and marriage the exception. It\r\nwas computed that, taking the mass of costermongers, only one couple in\r\ntwenty, living together, were married, except in Clerkenwell, where the\r\ncosters are very numerous, and where the respected incumbent at certain\r\nseasons marries poor persons gratuitously; there one couple in ten were\r\nreally man and wife.\r\n\r\nOf the other classes of women street-sellers, directly the reverse is\r\nthe case; of those living as man and wife, one couple in twenty may be\r\n_unmarried_. An intelligent informant thought this average too high,\r\nand that it was more probably one in sixteen. But I incline to the\r\nopinion of one in twenty, considering how many of the street-traders\r\nhave “seen better days,” and were married before they apprehended\r\nbeing driven to a street career. In this enumeration I include only\r\nstreet-_traders_. Among such people as ballad singers, concubinage,\r\nthough its wrongfulness is far better understood than among ignorant\r\ncostermongers, is practised even more fully; and there is often among\r\nsuch classes even worse than concubinage--a dependance, more or less,\r\non the wages of a woman’s prostitution, and often a savage punishment\r\nto the wretched woman, if those wages of sin are scant or wanting.\r\n\r\n3. The widows in the street-trades are very generally the widows of\r\nstreet-sellers. I believe that very few of the widows of mechanics,\r\nwhen left unprovided for on their husbands’ demise, resort to street\r\ntraffic. If they have been needle-women before marriage, they again\r\nseek for employment at needle-work; if they have been servants, they\r\nbecome charwomen, or washerwomen, or again endeavour to obtain a\r\nlivelihood in domestic service.\r\n\r\nThere are some to whom those resources are but starvation, or a step\r\nfrom starvation, or whom they fail entirely, and then they “_must_ try\r\nthe streets,” as they will describe it. If they are young and reckless,\r\nthey become prostitutes; if in more advanced years, or with good\r\nprinciples, they turn street-sellers; but this is only when destitution\r\npresses sharply.\r\n\r\n4. The single women in the street-callings are generally the daughters\r\nof street-sellers, but their number is not a twentieth of the others,\r\nexcepting they are the daughters of Irish parents. The costermongers’\r\ndaughters either help their parents, with whom they reside, or carry on\r\nsome similar trade; or they soon form connections with the other sex,\r\nand easily sever the parental tie, which very probably has been far\r\ntoo lax or far too severe. I made many inquiries, but I did not hear\r\nof any unmarried young woman, not connected with street-folk by birth\r\nor rearing, such as a servant maid,--endeavouring to support herself\r\nwhen out of work or place by a street avocation. Such a person will\r\nstarve on slop millinery or slop shirt-making; or will, as much or more\r\nfrom desperation than from viciousness, go upon the town. With the\r\nIrish girls the case is different: brought up to a street-life, used\r\nto whine and blarney, they grow up to womanhood in street-selling, and\r\nas they rarely form impure connections, and as no one may be induced\r\nto offer them marriage, their life is often one of street celibacy. A\r\nyoung Irishwoman, to whom I was referred in the course of my inquiry\r\namong fruit-sellers, had come to London in the hopes of meeting her\r\nbrother, with whom she was to emigrate; but she could learn nothing of\r\nhim, and, concluding that he was dead, became an apple-seller. She sat,\r\nwhen I saw her, on cold wintry days, at the corner of a street in the\r\nCommercial-road, seemingly as much dead as alive, and slept with an\r\naunt, also a single woman, who was somewhat similarly circumstanced;\r\nand thus these two women lived on about 6_d._ a day each. Their joint\r\nbed was 1_s._ a week, and they contrived to subsist on what remained\r\nwhen this shilling was paid. The niece referred me, not without a\r\nsense of pride, to her priest, as to her observance of her religious\r\nduties, and declared that where she lodged there were none but women\r\nlodgers, and those chiefly her own countrywomen. I believe such cases\r\nare not uncommon. A few, who have had the education of ladies (as in\r\nthe case of an envelope-seller whose statement I gave), are driven to\r\nstreet-trading, but it is as a desperate grasp at something to supply\r\nless bitter bread, however little of it, than is supplied in the\r\nworkhouse. I have many a time heard poor women say: “God knows, sir,\r\nI should live far better, and be better lodged and better cared for\r\nin the house (they seldom call it workhouse), but I’d rather live on\r\n2_d._ a day.” Into the question of out and in-door relief I need not\r\nnow enter, but the prevalent feeling I have indicated is one highly\r\nhonourable to the English poor. I have heard it stated that the utter\r\nrepugnance to a workhouse existence was weaker than it used to be among\r\nthe poor, but I have not met with anything to uphold such an opinion.\r\n\r\nSuch constitute the several classes of women street-sellers. I shall\r\nnow proceed to speak of the habits and characters of this peculiar\r\nportion of the street-folk.\r\n\r\n_As regards the religion_ of the women in street-trades, it is not\r\ndifficult to describe it. The Irishwomen are Roman Catholics. Perhaps\r\nI am justified in stating that they are _all_ of that faith. The truth\r\nof this assertion is proved, moreover, to as full a demonstration as\r\nit very well can be proved without actual enumeration, by the fact\r\nthat the great majority of the Irishwomen in the streets are from the\r\nCatholic provinces of Connaught, Leinster, and Munster; there are\r\nvery few from Ulster, and not one-twentieth of the whole from any\r\none of the other provinces. Perhaps, again, it is not extravagant to\r\nestimate that three-fourths of the women and girls from the sister\r\nisland, now selling things in the streets, have been, when in their\r\nown country, connected through their husbands or parents with the\r\ncultivation of the land. It is not so easy to speak of what the\r\nremaining fourth were before they became immigrants. Some were the\r\nwives of mechanics, who, when their husbands failing to obtain work\r\nin London became street-traders, had adopted the same pursuits. I met\r\nwith one intelligent man having a stall of very excellent fruit in\r\nBattle-bridge, who had been a brogue-maker. He had been in business\r\non his own account in Tralee, but mended the indifferent profits of\r\nbrogue-making by a little trade in “dry goods.” This, he told me with\r\na cautious glance around him and in a half whisper, though it was\r\ntwenty-eight years since he left his country, meant smuggled tobacco.\r\nHe found it advisable, on account of being “wanted” by the revenue\r\nofficers, to leave Tralee in great haste. He arrived in London, got\r\nemployment as a bricklayer’s labourer, and sent for his wife to join\r\nhim. This she did, and from her first arrival, sold fruit in the\r\nstreets. In two or three years the husband’s work among the builders\r\ngrew slack, and he then took to the streets. Another man, a shoemaker,\r\nwho came from Dublin to obtain work in London, as he was considered “a\r\ngood hand,” could not obtain it, but became a street-seller, and _his_\r\nwife, previously to himself, had resorted to a street-trade in fruit.\r\nHe became a widower and married as “his second,” the daughter of an\r\nIrish carpenter who had been disappointed in emigrating from London,\r\nand whose whole family had become fruit-sellers. A third man, who had\r\nworked at his trade of a tailor in Cork, Waterford, Wicklow, and Dublin\r\n(he “tramped” from Cork to Dublin) had come to London and been for many\r\nyears a street-seller in different capacities. His wife and daughter\r\nnow assist him, or trade independently, in selling “roots.” “Rayther,”\r\nthis man said, “than put up wid the wages and the _ter-ratement_\r\n(said very emphatically) o’ thim slop masters at the Aist Ind, I’d\r\nsill myself as a slave. The sthraits doesn’t degrade a man like thim\r\nthieves o’ the worruld.” This man knew, personally, ten Irish mechanics\r\nwho were street-sellers in London, as were their wives and families,\r\nincluding some five-and-twenty females.\r\n\r\nI adduce these and the following details somewhat minutely, as they\r\ntend to show by what class of Irish immigrants the streets of the\r\nimperial metropolis are stocked with so large a body of open-air\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nThere is also another class of women who, I am informed on good\r\nauthority, sometimes become street-sellers, though I met with no\r\ninstance myself. The orphan children of poor Irish parents are, on the\r\ndemise of their father and mother sometimes taken into a workhouse and\r\nplaced out as domestic servants. So, as regards domestic servants, are\r\nthe daughters of Irish labourers, by their friends or the charitable.\r\nAs the wages of these young girls are small and sometimes nominal, the\r\nwork generally hard, and in no few instances the food scanty and the\r\ntreatment severe, domestic service becomes distasteful, and a street\r\nlife “on a few oranges and limmons” is preferred. There is, moreover,\r\nwith some of this class another cause which almost compels the young\r\nIrish girl into the adoption of some street calling. A peevish\r\nmistress, whose numerous family renders a servant necessary, but whose\r\nmeans are small or precarious, becomes bitterly dissatisfied with the\r\nawkwardness or stupidity of her Irish handmaiden; the girl’s going, or\r\n“teasing to go,” every Sunday morning to mass is annoying, and the girl\r\nis often discharged, or discharges herself “in a huff.” The mistress,\r\nperhaps, with the low tyranny dear to vulgar minds, refuses her servant\r\na character, or, in giving one, suppresses any good qualities, and\r\nexaggerates the failings of impudence, laziness, lying, and dirtiness.\r\nThus the girl cannot obtain another situation, and perforce perhaps she\r\nbecomes a street-seller.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which young Irish people thus adapt themselves to\r\nall the uncertainties and hardships of a street life is less to be\r\nwondered at when we consider that the Irish live together, or at any\r\nrate associate with one another, in this country, preserving their\r\nnative tastes, habits, and modes of speech. Among their tastes and\r\nhabits, a dislike to a street life does not exist as it does among\r\nEnglish girls.\r\n\r\nThe poor Irish females in London are for the most part regular in their\r\nattendance at mass, and this constant association in their chapels is\r\none of the links which keeps the street-Irish women so much distinct\r\nfrom the street-English. In the going to and returning from the Roman\r\nCatholic chapels, there is among these people--I was told by one of the\r\nmost intelligent of them--a talk of family and secular matters,--of\r\nthe present too high price of oranges to leave full 6_d._ a day at\r\ntwo a penny, and the probable time when cherries would be “in” and\r\ncheap, “plaze God to prosper them.” In these colloquies there is an\r\nabsence of any interference by English street-sellers, and an unity of\r\nconversation and interest peculiarly Irish. It is thus that the tie of\r\nreligion, working with the other causes, keeps the Irish in the London\r\nstreets knitted to their own ways, and is likely to keep them so, and,\r\nperhaps, to add to their number.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to write somewhat at length of so large a class\r\nof women who _are_ professors of a religion, but of the others the\r\ndetails may be brief; for, as to the great majority, religion is\r\nalmost a nonentity. For this absence of religious observances, the\r\nwomen street-sellers make many, and sometimes, I must confess, valiant\r\nexcuses. They must work on a Sunday morning, they will say, or they\r\ncan’t eat; or else they tell you, they are so tired by knocking about\r\nall the week that they must rest on a Sunday; or else they have no\r\nclothes to go to church in, and ar’n’t a-going there just to be looked\r\ndown upon and put in any queer place as if they had a fever, and for\r\nladies to hold their grand dresses away from them as they walked in to\r\ntheir grand pews. Then, again, some assert they are not used to sit\r\nstill for so long a time, and so fall asleep. I have heard all these\r\ncauses assigned as reasons for not attending church or chapel.\r\n\r\nA few women street-sellers, however, _do_ attend the Sunday service\r\nof the Church of England. One lace-seller told me that she did so\r\nbecause it obliged Mrs. ------, who was the best friend and customer\r\nshe had, and who always looked from her pew in the gallery to see who\r\nwere on the poor seats. A few others, perhaps about an equal number,\r\nattend dissenting places of worship of the various denominations--the\r\nMethodist chapels comprising more than a half. If I may venture upon\r\na calculation founded on the result of my inquiries, and on the\r\ninformation of others who felt an interest in the matter, I should say\r\nthat about five female street-sellers attended Protestant places of\r\nworship, in the ratio of a hundred attending the Roman Catholic chapels.\r\n\r\n_The localities in which the female street-sellers reside_ are\r\nthose (generally) which I have often had occasion to specify as the\r\nabodes of the poor. They congregate principally, however, in the\r\nneighbourhood of some street-market. The many courts in Ray-street,\r\nTurnmill-street, Cow-cross, and other parts of Clerkenwell, are\r\nfull of street-sellers, especially costermongers, some of those\r\ncostermongers being also drovers. Their places of sale are in\r\nClerkenwell-green, Aylesbury-street, and St. John-street. Others\r\nreside in Vine-street (late Mutton-hill), Saffron-hill, Portpool\r\nLane, Baldwin’s-gardens, and the many streets or alleys stretching\r\nfrom Leather-lane to Gray’s-inn-lane, with a few of the better sort\r\nin Cromer-street. Their chief mart is Leather-lane, now one of the\r\nmost crowded markets in London. The many who use the Brill as their\r\nplace of street-traffic, reside in Brill-row, in Ossulston-street,\r\nWilstead-street, Chapel-street, and in the many small intersecting\r\nlanes and alleys connected with those streets, and in other parts\r\nof Somers-town. The saleswomen in the Cripplegate street-markets,\r\nsuch as Whitecross-street, Fore-street, Golden-lane, &c., reside\r\nin Play-house-yard, and in the thick congregation of courts and\r\nalleys, approximating to Aldersgate-street, Fore-street, Bunhill-row,\r\nChiswell-street, Barbican, &c., &c. Advancing eastward, the\r\nfemale street-sellers in Shoreditch (including the divisions of\r\nthe Bishopsgate-streets Within and Without, Norton Folgate, and\r\nHolywell-street) reside in and about Artillery-lane, Half-moon-street,\r\nand the many narrow “clefts” (as they are called in one of Leigh\r\nHunt’s essays) stretching on the right hand as you proceed along\r\nBishopsgate-street, from its junction with Cornhill; “clefts” which, on\r\nmy several visits, have appeared to me as among the foulest places in\r\nLondon. On the left-hand side, proceeding in the same direction, the\r\nstreet-sellers reside in Long-alley, and the many yards connected with\r\nthat, perhaps narrowest, in proportion to its length, of any merely\r\npedestrian thoroughfare in London. Mixed with the poor street-sellers\r\nabout Long-alley, I may observe, are a mass of the tailors and\r\nshoemakers employed by the east-end slop-masters; they are principally\r\nIrish workmen, carrying on their crafts many in one room, to economise\r\nthe rent, while some of their wives are street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers in Spitalfields and Bethnal-green are so mixed\r\nup as to their abodes with the wretchedly underpaid cabinet-makers\r\nwho supply the “slaughter-houses;” with slop-employed tailors and\r\nshoemakers (in the employ of a class, as respects shoemakers, known as\r\n“garret-masters” or middle-men, between the workman and the wholesale\r\nwarehouse-man), bobbin-turners, needle-women, slop-milliners, &c., that\r\nI might tediously enumerate almost every one of the many streets known,\r\nemphatically enough, as the “poor streets.” These poor streets are\r\nvery numerous, running eastward from Shoreditch to the Cambridge-road,\r\nand southward from the Bethnal-green-road to Whitechapel and the\r\nMile End-road. The female street-sellers in Whitechapel live in\r\nWentworth-street, Thrawl-street, Osborne-street, George-yard, and in\r\nseveral of their interminglements with courts and narrow streets.\r\nThe Petticoat-lane street-dealers are generally Jews, and live in\r\nthe poorer Jewish quarters, in Petticoat-lane and its courts, and\r\nin the streets running on thence to Houndsditch. Rosemary-lane has\r\nmany street-sellers, but in the lane itself and its many yards and\r\nblind alleys they find their domiciles. Westward in the metropolis\r\none of the largest street-markets is in Tottenham-court-road; and\r\nin the courts between Fitzroy-market and Tottenham-court-road are\r\nthe rooms of the women vending their street goods. Those occupying\r\nthe Hampstead-road with their stalls--which is but a continuation\r\nof the Tottenham-court-road market--live in the same quarters.\r\nIn what is generally called the St. George’s-market, meaning the\r\nstalls at the western extremity of Oxford-street, the women who own\r\nthose stalls reside in and about Thomas-street, Tom’s-court, and\r\nthe wretched places--the very existence of which is perhaps unknown\r\nto their aristocratic neighbourhood--about Grosvenor-square; some\r\nof them lamentably wretched places. It might be wearisome to carry\r\non this enumeration further. It may suffice to observe, that in\r\nthe populous parts of Southwark, Lambeth, and Newington, wherever\r\nthere is a street-market, are small or old streets inhabited by the\r\nstreet-sellers, and at no great distance. From the Obelisk at the\r\njunction, or approximate junction, of the Westminster, Waterloo,\r\nBlackfriars, Borough, and London-roads, in pretty well every direction\r\nto the banks of the Thames, are a mass of private-looking streets--as\r\nfar as the absence of shops constitutes the privacy of a street--old\r\nand half-ruinous, or modern and trim, in all of which perhaps may be\r\nfound street-sellers, and in some of which are pickpockets, thieves,\r\nand prostitutes.\r\n\r\nOf course it must be understood that these specified localities are\r\nthe residence of the male, as well as the female street-sellers, both\r\nadults and children.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of female street-traders who reside in lodging-houses\r\nmay be estimated at one-tenth of the entire number. This may appear a\r\nsmall proportion, but it must be remembered that the costermongering\r\nwomen do not reside in lodging-houses--so removing the largest class of\r\nstreet-folk from the calculation of the numbers thus accommodated--and\r\nthat the Irish who pursue street callings with any regularity generally\r\nprefer living, if it be two or three families in a room, in a place\r\nof their own. The female street-folk sleeping in lodging-houses,\r\nand occasionally taking their meals there, are usually those who are\r\nitinerant; the women who have a settled trade, especially a “pitch,”\r\nreside in preference in some “place of their own.” Of the number in\r\nlodging-houses one half may be regular inmates, some having a portion\r\nof a particular room to themselves; the others are casual sojourners,\r\nchanging their night’s shelter as convenience prompts.\r\n\r\nOf the female street-sellers residing in houses of ill fame there are\r\nnot many; perhaps not many more than 100. I was told by a gentleman\r\nwhose connection with parochial matters enabled him to form an\r\nopinion, that about Whitecross-street, and some similar streets\r\nnear the Cornwall-road, and stretching away to the Blackfriars and\r\nBorough-roads--(the locality which of any in London is perhaps the\r\nmost rank with prostitution and its attendant evils)--there might be\r\n600 of those wretched women and of all ages, from 15 to upwards of\r\n40; and that among them he believed there were barely a score who\r\noccupied themselves with street-sale. Of women, and more especially\r\nof girl, street-sellers, such as flower-girls, those pursuing immoral\r\ncourses are far more numerous than 100, but they do not often reside\r\nin houses notoriously of ill-fame, but in their own rooms (and too\r\noften with their parents) and in low lodging-houses. For women who are\r\nstreet-sellers, without the practice of prostitution, to reside in a\r\nhouse of ill-fame, would be a reckless waste of money; as I am told\r\nthat in so wretched a street as White-horse-street, the rent of a front\r\nkitchen is 4_s._ 6_d._ a week; of a back kitchen, 3_s._ 6_d._; of a\r\nfront parlour, 6_s._; and of a back parlour, 4_s._ 6_d._; all being\r\nmeagrely furnished and very small. This is also accounted one of the\r\ncheapest of all such streets. The rent of a street-seller’s unfurnished\r\nroom is generally 1_s._ 6_d._ or even 1_s._ a week; a furnished room is\r\n3_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_The state of education_ among the female street-sellers is very\r\ndefective. Perhaps it may be said that among the English costers not\r\none female in twenty can read, and not one in forty can write. But\r\nthey are fond of listening to any one who reads the newspaper or any\r\nexciting story. Among the street-selling Irish, also, education is\r\nvery defective. As regards the adults, who have been of woman’s estate\r\nbefore they left Ireland, a knowledge of reading and writing may be as\r\nrare as among the English costerwomen; but with those who have come to\r\nthis country sufficiently young, or have been born here, education is\r\nfar more diffused than among the often more prosperous English street\r\nchildren. This is owing to the establishment of late years of many\r\nRoman Catholic schools, at charges suited to the poor, or sometimes\r\nfree, and of the Irish parents having availed themselves (probably\r\non the recommendation of the priest) of such opportunities for the\r\ntuition of their daughters, which the English costers have neglected to\r\ndo with equal chances. Of the other classes whom I have specified as\r\nstreet-sellers, I believe I may say that the education of the females\r\nis about the average of that of “servants of all work” who have been\r\nbrought up amidst struggles and poverty; they can read, but with little\r\nappreciation of what they read, and have therefore little taste for\r\nbooks, and often little leisure even if they have taste. As to writing,\r\na woman told me that at one time, when she was “in place,” and kept\r\nweekly accounts, she had been complimented by her mistress on her neat\r\nhand, but that she and her husband (a man of indifferent character) had\r\nbeen street-sellers for seven or eight years, and during all that time\r\nshe had only once had a pen in her hand; this was a few weeks back, in\r\nsigning a petition--something about Sundays, she said--she wrote her\r\nname with great pain and difficulty, and feared that she had not even\r\nspelled it aright! I may here repeat that I found the uneducated always\r\nready to attribute their want of success in life to their want of\r\neducation; while the equally poor street-sellers, who were “scholars,”\r\nare as apt to say, “It’s been of no manner of use to me.” In all these\r\nmatters I can but speak generally. The male street-sellers who have\r\nseen better days have of course been better educated, but the most\r\nintelligent of the street class are the patterers, and of them the\r\nfemales form no portion.\r\n\r\n_The diet of the class_ I am describing is, as regards its poorest\r\nmembers, tea and bread or bread and grease; a meal composed of nothing\r\nelse is their fare twice or thrice a day. Sometimes there is the\r\naddition of a herring--or a plaice, when plaice are two a penny--but\r\nthe consumption of cheap fish, with a few potatoes, is more common\r\namong the poor Irish than the poor English female street-sellers.\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said an elderly woman, who sold cakes of blacking and\r\nsmall wares, “I could make a meal on fish and potatoes, cheaper than on\r\ntea and bread and butter, though I don’t take milk with my tea--I’ve\r\ngot to like it better without milk than with it--but if you’re a long\r\ntime on your legs in the streets and get to your bit of a home for a\r\ncup of tea, you want a bit of rest over it, and if you have to cook\r\nfish it’s such a trouble. O, no, indeed, this time of year there’s\r\nno ’casion to light a fire for your tea--and tea ’livens you far\r\nmore nor a herring--because there’s always some neighbour to give a\r\npoor woman a jug of boiling water.” Married women, who may carry on\r\na trade distinct from that of their husbands, live as well as their\r\nearnings and the means of the couple will permit: what they consider\r\ngood living is a dinner daily off “good block ornaments” (small pieces\r\nof meat, discoloured and dirty, but not tainted, usually set for sale\r\non the butcher’s block), tripe, cow-heel, beef-sausages, or soup from\r\na cheap cook-shop, “at 2_d._ a pint.” To this there is the usual\r\naccompaniment of beer, which, in all populous neighbourhoods, is “3_d._\r\na pot (quart) in your own jugs.” From what I could learn, it seems to\r\nme that an inordinate or extravagant indulgence of the palate, under\r\nany circumstances, is far less common among the female than the male\r\nstreet-sellers.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and the fine months of the spring and autumn, there\r\nare, I am assured, one-third of the London street-sellers--male and\r\nfemale--“tramping” the country. At Maidstone Fair the other day, I\r\nwas told by an intelligent itinerant dealer, there were 300 women, all\r\nof whose faces he believed he had seen at one time or other in London.\r\nThe Irish, however, tramp very little into the country for purposes\r\nof trade, but they travel in great numbers from one place to another\r\nfor purposes of mendicancy; or, if they have a desire to emigrate,\r\nthey will tramp from London to Liverpool, literally begging their\r\nway, no matter whether they have or have not any money. The female\r\nstreet-sellers are thus a fluctuating body.\r\n\r\nThe beggars among the women who profess to be street-traders are\r\nchiefly Irishwomen, some of whom, though otherwise well-conducted,\r\nsober and chaste, beg shamelessly and with any mendacious\r\nrepresentation. It is remarkable enough, too, that of the Irishwomen\r\nwho will thus beg, many if employed in any agricultural work, or in\r\nthe rougher household labours, such as scouring or washing, will work\r\nexceedingly hard. To any feeling of self-respect or self-dependence,\r\nhowever, they seem dead; their great merit is their chastity, their\r\ngreat shame their lying and mendicancy.\r\n\r\nThe female street-sellers are again a fluctuating body, as in the\r\nsummer and autumn months. A large proportion go off to work in\r\nmarket-gardens, in the gathering of peas, beans, and the several\r\nfruits; in weeding, in hay-making, in the corn-harvest (when they\r\nwill endeavour to obtain leave to glean if they are unemployed more\r\nprofitably), and afterwards in the hopping. The women, however, thus\r\nseeking change of employment, are the ruder street-sellers, those who\r\nmerely buy oranges at 4_d._ to sell at 6_d._, and who do not meddle\r\nwith any calling mixed up with the necessity of skill in selection,\r\nor address in recommending. Of this half-vagrant class, many are not\r\nstreet-sellers usually, but are half prostitutes and half thieves,\r\nnot unfrequently drinking all their earnings, while of the habitual\r\nfemale street-sellers, I do not think that drunkenness is now a very\r\nprevalent vice. Their earnings are small, and if they become habituated\r\nto an indulgence in drink, their means are soon dissipated; in which\r\ncase they are unable to obtain stock-money, and they cease to be\r\nstreet-sellers.\r\n\r\nIf I may venture upon an estimation, I should say that the women\r\nengaged in street sale--wives, widows, and single persons--number from\r\n25,000 to 30,000, and that their average earnings run from 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nto 4_s._ a week.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give the histories of individuals belonging to\r\neach of the above class of female street-sellers, with the view of\r\nillustrating what has been said respecting them generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A SINGLE WOMAN, AS A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nI had some difficulty, for the reasons I have stated, in finding a\r\nsingle woman who, by her unaided industry, supported herself on the\r\nsale of street merchandise. There were plenty of single young women\r\nso engaged, but they lived, or lodged, with their parents or with one\r\nparent, or they had some support, however trifling, from some quarter\r\nor other. Among the street Irish I could have obtained statements from\r\nmany single women who depended on their daily sale for their daily\r\nbread, but I have already given instances of their street life. One\r\nIrishwoman, a spinster of about 50, for I had some conversation with\r\nher in the course of a former inquiry, had supported herself alone,\r\nby street sale, for many years. She sat, literally packed in a sort\r\nof hamper-basket, at the corner of Charles-street, Leather-lane. She\r\nseemed to fit herself cross-legged, like a Turk, or a tailor on his\r\nshop-board, into her hamper; her fruit stall was close by her, and\r\nthere she seemed to doze away life day by day--for she usually appeared\r\nto be wrapped in slumber. If any one approached her stall, however,\r\nshe seemed to be awake, as it were, mechanically. I have missed this\r\npoor woman of late, and I believe she only packed herself up in the way\r\ndescribed when the weather was cold.\r\n\r\nA woman of about 26 or 27--I may again remark that the regular\r\nstreet-sellers rarely know their age--made the following statement. She\r\nwas spare and sickly looking, but said that her health was tolerably\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n“I used to mind my mother’s stall,” she stated, “when I was a girl,\r\nwhen mother wasn’t well or had a little work at pea-shelling or such\r\nlike. She sold sweet-stuff. No, she didn’t make it, but bought it. I\r\nnever cared for it, and when I was quite young I’ve sold sweet-stuffs\r\nas I never tasted. I never had a father. I can’t read or write, but I\r\nlike to hear people read. I go to Zion Chapel sometimes of a Sunday\r\nnight, the singing’s so nice. I don’t know what religion you may call\r\nit of, but it’s a Zion Chapel. Mother’s been dead these--well I don’t\r\nknow how long, but it’s a long time. I’ve lived by myself ever since,\r\nand kept myself, and I have half a room with another young woman\r\nwho lives by making little boxes. I don’t know what sort of boxes.\r\nPill-boxes? Very likely, sir, but I can’t say I ever saw any. She goes\r\nout to work on another box-maker’s premises. She’s no better off nor\r\nme. We pays 1_s._ 6_d._ a-week between us; it’s my bed, and the other\r\nsticks is her’n. We ’gree well enough. I haven’t sold sweet stuff for\r\na great bit. I’ve sold small wares in the streets, and artificials\r\n(artificial flowers), and lace, and penny dolls, and penny boxes (of\r\ntoys). No, I never hear anything improper from young men. Boys has\r\nsometimes said, when I’ve been selling sweets, ‘Don’t look so hard at\r\n’em, or they’ll turn sour.’ I never minded such nonsense. I has very\r\nfew amusements. I goes once or twice a month, or so, to the gallery at\r\nthe Wick (Victoria Theatre), for I live near. It’s beautiful there. O,\r\nit’s really grand. I don’t know what they call what’s played, because I\r\ncan’t read the bills.\r\n\r\n“I hear what they’re called, but I forgets. I knows Miss Vincent and\r\nJohn Herbert when they come on. I likes them the best. I’m a going to\r\nleave the streets. I have an aunt a laundress, because she was mother’s\r\nsister, and I always helped her, and she taught me laundressing.\r\nI work for her three and sometimes four days a-week now, because\r\nshe’s lost her daughter Ann, and I’m known as a good ironer. Another\r\nlaundress will employ me next week, so I’m dropping the streets, as I\r\ncan do far better. I’m not likely to be married and I don’t want to.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A MECHANIC’S WIFE, AS A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged woman, presenting what may be best understood as a\r\ndecency of appearance, for there was nothing remarkable in her face\r\nor dress, gave me the following account of her experience as a\r\nstreet-seller, and of her feelings when she first became one:--\r\n\r\n“I went into service very young in the country,” she said, “but\r\nmistress brought me up to London with her, where master had got a\r\nsituation: the children was so fond of me. I saved a little money in\r\nthat and other places as girls often does, and they seems not to save\r\nit so much for themselves as for others. Father got the first bit of\r\nmoney I saved, or he would have been seized for rent--he was only a\r\nworking man (agricultural labourer)--and all the rest I scraped went\r\nbefore I’d been married a fortnight, for I got married when I was 24.\r\nO no, indeed, I don’t mean that my money was wasted by my husband. It\r\nwas every farthing laid out in the house, besides what he had, for we\r\ntook a small house in a little street near the Commercial-road, and let\r\nout furnished rooms. We did very well at first with lodgings, but the\r\nlodgers were mates of vessels, or people about the river and the docks,\r\nand they were always coming and going, and the rooms was often empty,\r\nand some went away in debt. My husband is a smith, and was in middling\r\nwork for a good while. Then he got a job to go with some horses to\r\nFrance, for he can groom a horse as well as shoe it, and he was a long\r\ntime away, three or four months, for he was sent into another country\r\nwhen he got to France, but I don’t understand the particulars of it.\r\nThe rooms was empty and the last lodger went away without paying, and\r\nI had nothing to meet the quarter’s rent, and the landlord, all of a\r\nsudden almost, put in the brokers, for he said my husband would never\r\ncome back, and perhaps I should be selling the furniture and be off to\r\njoin him, for he told me it was all a planned thing he knew. And so\r\nthe furniture was sold for next to nothing, and 1_l._ 6_s._ was given\r\nto me after the sale; I suppose that was over when all was paid, but\r\nI’d been forced to part with some linen and things to live upon and\r\npay the rates, that came very heavy. My husband came back to an empty\r\nhouse three days after, and he’d been unlucky, for he brought home\r\nonly 4_l._ instead of 10_l._ at least, as he expected, but he’d been\r\ncheated by the man he went into the other country with. Yes, the man\r\nthat cheated him was an Englishman, and my poor John was put to great\r\ntrouble and expense, and was in a strange place without knowing a word\r\nof the language. But the foreigners was very kind to him, he said, and\r\ndidn’t laugh at him when he tried to make hisself understood, as I’ve\r\nseen people do here many a time. The landlord gave us 1_l._ to give up\r\nthe house, as he had a good offer for it, and so we had to start again\r\nin the world like.\r\n\r\n“Our money was almost all gone before John got regular work, tho’ he\r\nhad some odd jobs, and then he had for a good many months the care of\r\na horse and cart for a tradesman in the City. Shortly after that he\r\nwas laid up a week with a crushed leg, but his master wouldn’t wait\r\na week for him, so he hired another: ‘I have nothing to say against\r\nJohn,’ says he, when I told his master of the accident, ‘and I’m\r\nsorry, very sorry, but my business can’t be hindered by waiting for\r\npeople getting better of accidents.’ John got work at his own business\r\nnext, but there was always some stopper. He was ill, or I was ill,\r\nand if there was 10_s._ in the house, then it went and wasn’t enough.\r\nAnd so we went on for a good many years, I don’t know how many. John\r\nkept working among horses and carts, or at his own business, but what\r\nwith travelling abroad, I suppose, and such like, he got to like best\r\nto be in the streets, and he has his health best that way.” (The\r\nhusband, it is evident, was afflicted with the restlessness of the\r\ntribe.) “About seven years ago we were very badly off--no work, and no\r\nmoney, and neither of us well. Then I used to make a few women’s\r\nplain night-caps and plain morning caps for servants, and sell them\r\nto a shopkeeper, but latterly I couldn’t sell them at all, or get no\r\nmore than the stuff cost me, without any profit for labour. So at\r\nlast--and it was on a Friday evening of all unlucky times--my gold\r\nwedding-ring that cost 8_s._ 6_d._, and that I’d stuck to all along,\r\nhad to be pawned for 4_s._ 6_d._ for rent and bread. That _was_ a\r\nshocking time, sir. We’ve sat in the dark of an evening, for we could\r\nget neither coals nor a candle as we was a little in debt, and John\r\nsaid, it was a blessing after all perhaps that we hadn’t no family, for\r\nhe often, both joking and serious, wished for children, but it wasn’t\r\nGod’s will you see that we should have any. One morning when I woke\r\nvery early I found my husband just going out, and when I asked him what\r\nsent him out so soon, he says: ‘It’s for nothing bad, so don’t fret\r\nyourself, old gal.’ That day he walked all over London and called on\r\nall the masters as had employed him, or knowed him, and told them how\r\nhe was situated, and said that if he could borrow 20_s._ up and down,\r\nhe could do a little, he knew--the thought of it came into his mind\r\nall of a sudden--in going about with a horse and cart, that he could\r\nhire, and sell coals to poor people. He raised 8_s._ 6_d._, I think it\r\nwas, and started with a quarter of a ton of coals, and then another\r\nquarter when the first was sold, and he carried it on for three or\r\nfour weeks. But the hire of the horse and cart took all the profit,\r\nand the poor people wanted credit, besides people must cheat to thrive\r\nas sells coals in the street. All this time I could do nothing--though\r\nI tried for washing and charing, but I’m slow at washing--but starve\r\nat home, and be afraid every knock was the landlord. After that John\r\nwas employed to carry a very heavy board over his shoulder, and so\r\nas to have it read on both sides. It was about an eating-house, and\r\nI went with him to give little bills about it to all we met, for it\r\nwas as much as a man could do to carry the board. He had 1_s._ a day,\r\nand I had 6_d._ That was my first time in the streets and I felt so\r\n’shamed to come to that. I thought if I met any people I knew in Essex,\r\nor any of my old mistresses, what would they think. Then we had all\r\nsorts of jokes to stand. We both looked pinched, and young gents used\r\nto say, ‘Do you dine there yourselves?’ and the boys--O, of all the\r\ntorments!--they’ve shouted out, ‘Excellent Dining-rooms’ that was on\r\nthe board, sir, ‘and two jolly speciments of the style of grub!’ I\r\ncould have knocked their saucy heads together. We was resting in the\r\nshade one day--and we were anxious to do our best, for 1_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nday was a great thing then--and an old gentleman came up and said he\r\nwas glad to get out of the sun. He looked like a parson, but was a joky\r\nman, and he’d been having some wine, I think, he smelled of it so. He\r\nbegan to talk to us and ask us questions, such as you have, sir, and we\r\ntold him how we was situated. ‘God bless you,’ says he, ‘for I think\r\nyou’re honest folks. People that lie don’t talk like you; here’s some\r\nloose silver I have,’ and he gave John 5_s._ 6_d._ and went away. We\r\ncould hardly think it was real; it seemed such a lot of money just\r\nthen, to be got clear all at once. I’ve never seen him since, and never\r\nsaw him, as I knows of, before, but may God Almighty bless him wherever\r\nhe is, for I think that 5_s._ 6_d._ put new life into us, and brought a\r\nblessing. A relation of John’s came to London not long after and gave\r\nhim a sovereign and sent him some old clothes, and very good ones, when\r\nhe went back. Then John hired a barrow--it’s his own now--and started\r\nas a costermonger. A neighbour of ourn told him how to do it, and he’s\r\ndone very well at it since.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, sir, I could’nt like to stay at home by myself doing\r\nof a nothing, and I couldn’t get any charing; besides John says, ‘Why,\r\ncan’t _you_ sell something?’ So I made some plain women’s caps, and\r\nas we lived in Ann’s-place, Waterloo-road, then, I went into the New\r\nCut with them on a Saturday night. But there was such crowding, and\r\nshoving, and shouting, that I was kept under and sold only one cap. I\r\nwas very much nervoused before I went and thought again--it was very\r\nfoolish, I know--‘if I saw anybody from Essex,’ for country people\r\nseem to think all their friends in London are making fortunes! Before\r\nI went my landlady _would_ treat me to a little drop of gin to give me\r\nspirits, and ‘for luck,’ but I think it made me more nervoused. I very\r\nseldom taste any. And John’s very good that way. He takes his pint or\r\ntwo every now and then, but I know where he uses, and if it gets late I\r\ngo for him and he comes home. The next time I went to sell in the Cut\r\nI got bold, for I knew I was doing nothing but what was honest; I’ve\r\nsold caps, and millinery, and laces, and artificial flowers, and such\r\nlike ever since. We’ve saved a little money now, which is in the bank,\r\nthank God, but that’s not done by costering, or by my trade. But my\r\nhusband buys a poney every now and then, and grooms and fattens it up\r\nwell, and makes it quite another thing, and so clears a pound or two;\r\nhe once cleared 3_l._ 15_s._ on it. We don’t go to church or chapel on\r\na Sunday, we’re so tired out after the week’s work. But John reads a\r\ntract that a young lady leaves ’till he falls asleep over it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF AN IRISHWOMAN, AS A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nI have before had occasion to remark the aptitude of the poor Irish in\r\nthe streets of London not so much to lie, which may be too harsh a word\r\nwhen motives and idiosyncrasy are considered, but to exaggerate, and\r\nmisrepresent, and colour in such a way that the truth becomes a mere\r\nincident in the narrative, instead of being the animating principle\r\nthroughout. I speak here not as regards any direct question or answer\r\non one specific point, but as regards a connected statement. Presuming\r\nthat a poor Irishwoman, for instance, had saved up a few shillings,\r\nvery likely for some laudable purpose, and had them hidden about her\r\nperson, and was asked if she had a farthing in the world, she would\r\nreply with a look of most stolid innocence, “Sorra a fardin, sir.” This\r\nof course is an unmitigated lie. Then ask her _why_ she is so poor\r\nand what are her hopes for the future, and a very slender substratum\r\nof truth will suffice for the putting together of a very ingenious\r\nhistory, if she think the occasion requires it.\r\n\r\nIt is the same when these poor persons are questioned as to their\r\nformer life. They have heard of societies to promote emigration, and\r\nif they fancy that any inquiries are made of them with a view to\r\nemigration, they will ingeniously shape their replies so as to promote\r\nor divert that object, according to their wishes. If they think the\r\ninquiries are for some charitable purpose, their tale of woe and\r\nstarvation is heart-rending. The probability is that they may have\r\nsuffered much, and long, and bravely, but they will still exaggerate.\r\nIn one thing, however, I have found them understate the fact, and that\r\nI believe principally, or wholly, when they had been previously used\r\nto the most wretched of the Irish hovels. I mean as to their rooms.\r\n“Where do you live,” may be asked. “Will, thin, in Paraker-street\r\n(Parker-street) Derwry-lane?” “Have you a decent room?” “Shure, thin,\r\nand it is dacint for a poor woman.” On a visit, perhaps the room will\r\nbe found smoky, filthy, half-ruinous, and wretched in every respect. I\r\nbelieve, however, that if these poor people could be made to comprehend\r\nthe motives which caused their being questioned for the purposes of\r\nthis work, the elucidation of the truth--motives which they cannot\r\nbe made to understand--they would speak with a far greater regard to\r\nveracity. But they _will_ suspect an ulterior object, involving some\r\ndesign on the part of the querist, and they will speak accordingly. To\r\nwhat causes, social or political, national, long-rooted, or otherwise,\r\nthis spirit may be owing, it is not now my business to inquire.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of my inquiries amongst the poor Irish, whose civility\r\nand often native politeness, where there is a better degree of\r\nintelligence, makes it almost impossible to be angry with them even\r\nwhen you listen to a story of which you believe not one-sixth--at the\r\noutset of my inquiries, I say, I was told by an Irish gentleman that\r\nI was sure to hear the truth if I had authority to use the name of\r\ntheir priest. I readily obtained the consent of reverend gentlemen to\r\nuse their names and for any purpose of inquiry, a courtesy which I\r\nthankfully acknowledge. I mention this more especially, that it may not\r\nbe thought that there has been exaggeration in my foregoing or in the\r\nfollowing statement, where the Irish are the narrators. I have little\r\ndoubt of their truth.\r\n\r\nIt may be but proper to remark, in order that one class of poor people\r\nmay not be unduly _depreciated_, while another class is, perhaps,\r\nunduly _appreciated_, that the poor Irishman is much more imaginative,\r\nis readier of wit and far readier of speech, than an Englishman of a\r\ncorresponding grade; and were the untaught Englishman equally gifted in\r\nthose respects, who will avouch that _his_ regard for the truth would\r\nbe much more severe?\r\n\r\nOf the causes which induced a good-looking Irish woman to become a\r\nstreet-seller I had the following account, which I give in its curious\r\ndetails:--\r\n\r\n“’Deed thin, sir, it’s more than 20 long years since I came from Dublin\r\nto Liverpool wid my father and mother, and brother William that’s dead\r\nand gone, rest his soul. He died when he was fourteen. They was masons\r\nin Ireland. Was both father and mother masons, sir? Well, then, in\r\nany quiet job mother helped father, for she was a strong woman. They\r\ncame away sudden. They was in some thrubble, but I never knew what,\r\nfor they wouldn’t talk to me about it. We thravelled from Liverpool\r\nto London, for there was no worruk at Liverpool; and he got worruk on\r\nbuildings in London, and had 18_s._ a week; and mother cleaned and\r\nworruked for a greengrocer, as they called him--he sold coals more than\r\nanything--where we lodged, and it wasn’t much, she got, but she airned\r\nwhat is such a thrubble to poor people, the rint. We was well off, and\r\nI was sent to school; and we should have been better off, but father\r\ntook too much to the dhrop, God save him. He fell onste and broke\r\nhis leg; and though the hospital gintlemen, God bless them for good\r\nChristians, got him through it, he got little worruk when he came out\r\nagain, and died in less than a year. Mother wasn’t long afther him; and\r\non her death-bed she said, so low I could hardly hear her, ‘Mary, my\r\ndarlint, if you starruve, be vartuous. Rimimber poor Illen’s funeral.’\r\nWhen I was quite a child, sir, I went wid mother to a funeral--she was\r\na relation--and it was of a young woman that died after her child had\r\nbeen borrun a fortnight, and she wasn’t married; that was Illen. Her\r\nbody was brought out of the lying-in hospital--I’ve often heard spake\r\nof it since--and was in the churchyard to be buried; and her brother,\r\nthat hadn’t seen her for a long time, came and wanted to see her in\r\nher coffin, and they took the lid off, and then he currused her in\r\nher coffin afore him; she’d been so wicked. But he wasn’t a good man\r\nhisself, and was in dhrink too; still nobody said anything, and he\r\nwalked away. It made me ill to see Illen in her coffin, and hear him\r\ncurruse, and I’ve remimbered it ever since.\r\n\r\n“I was thin fifteen, I believe, and hadn’t any friends that had any\r\ntie to me. I was lone, sir. But the neebours said, ‘Poor thing, she’s\r\nleft on the shuckrawn’ (homeless); and they helped me, and I got a\r\nplace. Mistress was very kind at first, that’s my first mistress was,\r\nand I had the care of a child of three years old; they had only one,\r\nbecause mistress was busy making waistcoats. Master was a hatter, and\r\naway all day, and they was well off. But some women called on mistress\r\nonce, and they had a deal of talkin’, and bladherin’, and laughin’,\r\nand I don’t know how often I was sent out for quarterns of gin. Then\r\nthey all went out together; and mistress came home quite tipsy just\r\nafore master, and went up-stairs, and had just time to get into bed;\r\nshe told me to tell master she had one of her sick head-aches and was\r\nforced to go to bed; she went on that way for three or four days, and\r\nmaster and she used to quarrel of a night, for I could hear them. One\r\nnight he came home sooner than common, and he’d been drinking, or\r\nperhaps it might be thrubble, and he sent me to bed wid the child; and\r\nsometime in the night, I don’t know what time, but I could only see\r\nfrom a gas-lamp that shined into the room, he came in, for there was\r\nno fastenin’ inside the door, it was only like a closet, and he began\r\nto ask me about mistress. When he larned she’d been drinking wid other\r\nwomen, he used dreadful language, and pulled me out of bed, and struck\r\nme with a stick that he snatched up, he could see it in the gas-light,\r\nit was little Frank’s horse, and swore at me for not telling him\r\nafore. He only struck me onste, but I screamed ever so often, I was so\r\nfrightened. I dressed myself, and lay down in my clothes, and got up as\r\nsoon as it was light--it was summer time--and thought I would go away\r\nand complain to some one. I would ask the neebours who to complain to.\r\nWhen I was going out there was master walking up and down the kitchen.\r\nHe’d never been to bed, and he says, says he, ‘Mary, where are you\r\ngoing?’ So I told him, and he begged my pardon, and said he was ashamed\r\nof what he’d done, but he was half mad; then he began to cry, and so\r\nI cried, and mistress came home just then, and when she saw us both\r\ncrying together, _she_ cried, and said she wasn’t wanted, as we was man\r\nand wife already. Master just gave her a push and down she fell, and he\r\nran out. She seemed so bad, and the child began to cry, that I couldn’t\r\nlave thin; and master came home drunk that night, but he wasn’t cross,\r\nfor he’d made out that mistress had been drinking with some neebours,\r\nand had got to her mother’s, and that she was so tipsy she fell asleep,\r\nthey let her stay till morning, and then some woman set her home, but\r\nshe’d been there all night. They made it up at last, but I wouldn’t\r\nstay. They was very kind to me when I left, and paid me all that was\r\nowing, and gave me a good pair of shoes, too; for they was well off.\r\n\r\n“I had a many places for seven years; after that, and when I was out of\r\na place, I stayed wid a widder, and a very dacint woman, she was wid a\r\ndaughter working for a bookbinder, and the old woman had a good pitch\r\nwith fruit. Some of my places was very harrud, but shure, again, I met\r\nsome as was very kind. I left one because they was always wanting me to\r\ngo to a Methodist chapel, and was always running down my religion, and\r\ndid all they could to hinder my ever going to mass. They would hardly\r\npay me when I left, because I wouldn’t listen to them, they said--the\r\nhaythens!--when they would have saved my soul. _They_ save my soul,\r\nindeed! The likes o’ thim! Yes, indeed, thin, I had wicked offers\r\nsometimes, and from masters that should have known better. I kept no\r\ncompany wid young men. One mistress refused me a karackter, because I\r\nwas so unhandy, she said; but she thought better of it. At last, I had\r\na faver (fever), and wasn’t expected for long (not expected to live);\r\nwhen I was getting well, everything went to keep me. What wasn’t good\r\nenough for the pawn went to the dolly (dolly-shop, generally a rag\r\nand bottle shop, or a marine store). When I could get about, I was so\r\nshabby, and my clothes hung about me so, that the shops I went to said,\r\n‘Very sorry, but can’t recommend you anywhere;’ and mistresses looked\r\nstrange at me, and I didn’t know what to do and was miserable. I’d\r\nbeen miserable sometimes in place, and had many a cry, and thought how\r\n‘lone’ I was, but I never was so miserable as this. At last, the old\r\nwoman I stayed along wid--O, yes, she was an Irishwoman--advised me to\r\nsill fruit in the streets, and I began on strawberries, and borrowed\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ to do it wid. I had my hilth better than ever thin; and\r\nafter I’d sold fruit of all kinds for two years, I got married. My\r\nhusband had a potato can thin. I knew him because he lived near, and\r\nI saw him go in and out, and go to mass. After that he got a porter’s\r\nplace and dropped his can, and he porters when he has a chance still,\r\nand has a little work in sewing sacks for the corn-merchants. Whin he’s\r\nat home at his sacks, as he is now, he can mind the children--we have\r\ntwo--and I sells a few oranges to make a thrifle. Whin there’s nothing\r\nilse for him to do, he sills fruit in the sthreets, and thin I’m at\r\nhome. We do middlin, God be praised.”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt my informant was a modest, and, in her way, a worthy\r\nwoman. But it may be doubted if any English girl, after seven years of\r\ndomestic service, would have so readily adapted herself to a street\r\ncalling. Had an English girl been living among, and used to the society\r\nof women who supported themselves by street labour, her repugnance to\r\nsuch a life might have been lessened; but even then, I doubt if she,\r\nwho had the virtue to resist the offers told of by my Irish informant,\r\ncould have made the attempt to live by selling fruit. I do not mean\r\nthat she would rather have fallen into immoral courses than honestly\r\nlive upon the sale of strawberries, but that she would have struggled\r\non and striven to obtain any domestic labour in preference to a street\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A WIDOW, A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nA woman, apparently about 50, strong-built and red-faced, speaking in\r\na loud tone, and what people of her class account a _hearty_ manner,\r\ngave me the following account. I can readily condense it, for in her\r\nstreet career there was nothing very novel. She was the daughter\r\nof a costermonger, and she married a costermonger before she was 20.\r\nOn my hinting that sometimes the marriage ceremony was not considered\r\nindispensable, the good woman laughed and said, “married, or as good,\r\nit’s hall as one--but we was married.” The marriage was not one of\r\nunalloyed happiness, for the couple often wrangled and occasionally\r\nfought. This was told to me with some laughter, and with perfect good\r\nhumour; for the widow seemed interested to have a listener. She did\r\nnot, I feel confident, exaggerate the merits of the deceased, nor,\r\nperhaps, his failings. He was the best judge of fish in the streets,\r\nshe said, and was the neatest hand in cutting it up, or showing it off;\r\nhe was not “a bad sort,” and was very fond of his children. When sober\r\nand at work he was a quiet fellow, without a cross word for a whole\r\nmorning, but when drunk, which was far too often (unless _very_ drunk,\r\nand then he was silly), he went about tearing and swearing “like one\r\no’clock.” But if he saw his wife take but a glass or two, to do her\r\ngood, he went on like a madman, and as if he never touched it himself.\r\nHe never had nothing to say to other women--if he had she would have\r\nclawed their eyes out, and his’n too--he was as good that way as any\r\nnobleman could be, and he was a fine man to look at; and on a Sunday,\r\nwhen he dressed hisself, he was beautiful. He was never in a church in\r\nhis life, and didn’t trouble hisself about such things; they was no\r\nconcern of his’n.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that I have treated this matter too lightly, but the\r\nforegoing is really the substance, and certainly it is the tone, of the\r\nwidow’s talk, which she poured forth freely, without expressing wonder\r\nwhy any one, a perfect stranger, cared to listen to such a history. She\r\nneeded but a few hints and leading questions to make her talk on. Nor\r\nis this an uncommon quality even among classes who would be shocked to\r\nbe classed, in any respect, with the Widowed Street-Seller. Their own\r\ncareer, their own sayings and doings, hopes and disappointments, alone\r\ninterest masses of people, and with the simplicity which not seldom\r\npertains to selfishness, they will readily talk of all that interests\r\nthemselves, as if it must necessarily interest others. On the whole,\r\nthough the departed costermonger was greatly deplored by his widow and\r\nfamily, they did very well without him, and carry on the business to\r\nthis day. He died four or five years back.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt this widow is a shrewd saleswoman enough. I have heard\r\nher cry “mack’rel, live mack’rel, eight a shilling, mack’rel!” and\r\nat other times, “Eight a bob, fine mack’rel, mack’rel, eight a bob,\r\neight a bob!” On my inquiring as to the cause of this difference in\r\nher cries, the fish-seller laughed and said, “I cries eight a bob when\r\nI sees people as I thinks is likely to like slang; to others I cries\r\neight a shilling, which no doubt is the right way of talking.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHILDREN STREET-SELLERS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the spirit of emulation, of imitation, of bravado, of\r\nopposition, of just or idle resentment, among boys, according to their\r\ntraining, companionship, natural disposition, and, above all, home\r\ntreatment, it seems most important to ascertain how these feelings and\r\ninclinations are fostered or stimulated by the examples of the free\r\nstreet-life of other lads to be seen on every side. There is no doubt\r\nthat to a large class of boys, whose parents are not in poverty, the\r\nyoung street ruffian is a hero.\r\n\r\nIf this inquiry be important, as it unquestionably is, concerning boys,\r\nhow much more important is it, when it includes the female children of\r\nthe streets; when it relates to the sex who, in all relations of life,\r\nand in all grades of society, are really the guardians of a people’s\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThe investigation is, again, rendered more interesting and more\r\nimportant, when it includes those children who have known no guidance\r\nfrom parent, master, or relative, but have been flung into the streets\r\nthrough neglect, through viciousness, or as outcasts from utter\r\ndestitution. Mixed with the children who really _sell_ in the streets,\r\nare the class who assume to sell that they may have the better chance\r\nto steal, or the greater facility to beg.\r\n\r\nBefore I classify what I consider to be the causes which have driven\r\nchildren to a street career, with all its hardening consequences,\r\nI may point out that culpability cannot be imputed to them at the\r\ncommencement of their course of life. They have been either untaught,\r\nmistaught, maltreated, neglected, regularly trained to vice, or fairly\r\nturned into the streets to shift for themselves. The censure, then,\r\nis attributable to parents, or those who should fill the place of\r\nparents--the State, or society. The exceptions to this culpability as\r\nregards parents are to be found in the instances where a costermonger\r\nemploys his children to aid him in his business occupation, which the\r\nparents, in their ignorance or prejudices, may account as good as any\r\nother, and the youths thus become unfit, perhaps, for any other than a\r\nscrambling street life. A second exception may be where the children in\r\na poor family (as continually happens among the Irish in London) _must_\r\nsell in the streets, that they may eat in any place.\r\n\r\nIn the following details I shall consider all to be children who\r\nare under fifteen years of age. It is just beyond that age (or the\r\nage of puberty) that, as our prison statistics and other returns\r\nshow, criminal dispositions are developed, “self-will” becomes more\r\nimperious and headstrong, that destructive propensity, or taste, which\r\nwe term the ruling passion or character of the individual is educed,\r\nand the destiny of the human being, especially when apart from the\r\nmoulding and well-directed care of parents or friends, is influenced\r\nperhaps for life.\r\n\r\n_The Causes_, then, which fill our streets with children who either\r\nmanifest the keen and sometimes roguish propensity of a precocious\r\ntrader, the daring and adroitness of the thief, or the loutish\r\nindifference of the mere dull vagabond, content if he can only eat and\r\nsleep, I consider to be these:--\r\n\r\n1. The conduct of parents, masters, and mistresses.\r\n\r\n2. The companionship and associations formed in tender years.\r\n\r\n3. The employment of children by costermongers and others who live by\r\nstreet traffic, and the training of costermongers’ children to a street\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n4. Orphanhood, friendlessness, and utter destitution.\r\n\r\n5. Vagrant dispositions and tastes on the part of children, which cause\r\nthem to be runaways.\r\n\r\nAfter this I shall treat of (_a_) the pursuits of the street-trading\r\nchildren; (_b_) their earnings; (_c_) the causes or influences which\r\nhave induced children to adopt some especial branch of a street life;\r\n(_d_) their state of education; (_e_) their morals, religion, opinions,\r\nand conduct; (_f_) places and character of dwellings; (_g_) diet; (_h_)\r\namusements; (_i_) clothing; (_j_) propensities.\r\n\r\nConcerning cause 1, viz., “The conduct of parents, masters, and\r\nmistresses,” I should have more to say were I treating of the\r\njuvenile criminals, instead of sellers in the streets. The brute\r\ntyranny of parents, manifested in the wreaking of any annoyances or\r\ndisappointments they may have endured, in the passionate beating and\r\ncursing of their children, for trifling or for no causes, is among\r\nthe worst symptoms of a depraved nature. This conduct may be the\r\nmost common among the poor, for among them are fewer conventional\r\nrestraints; but it exists among and debases other classes. Some parents\r\nonly exercise this tyranny in their fits of drunkenness, and make\r\nthat their plea in mitigation; but their dispositions are then only\r\nthe more undisguisedly developed, and they would be equally unjust or\r\ntyrannical when sober, but for some selfish fear which checks them. A\r\nboy perhaps endures this course of tyranny some time, and then finding\r\nit increase he feels its further endurance intolerable, and runs away.\r\nIf he have no friends with whom he can hope to find a shelter, the\r\nstreets only are open to him. He soon meets with comrades, some of\r\nwhom perhaps had been circumstanced like himself, and, if not strongly\r\ndisposed to idleness and vicious indulgencies, goes through a course\r\nof horse-holding, errand-running, parcel-carrying, and such like,\r\nand so becomes, if honestly or prudently inclined, a street-seller,\r\nbeginning with fuzees, or nuts, or some unexpensive stock. The where\r\nto buy and the how to sell he will find plenty to teach him at the\r\nlodging-houses, where he _must_ sleep when he can pay for a bed.\r\n\r\nWhen I was collecting information concerning brace-selling I met with\r\na youth of sixteen who about two years previously had run away from\r\nBirmingham, and made his way to London, with 2_s._ 6_d._ Although he\r\nearned something weekly, he was so pinched and beaten by a step-mother\r\n(his father was seldom at home except on Sunday) that his life was\r\nmiserable. This went on for nearly a year, until the boy began to\r\nresist, and one Saturday evening, when beaten as usual, he struck in\r\nreturn, drawing blood from his step-mother’s face. The father came\r\nhome before the fray was well ended; listened to his wife’s statement,\r\nand would not listen to the boy’s, and in his turn chastised the lad\r\nmercilessly. In five minutes after the boy, with aching bones and a\r\nbitter spirit, left his father’s house and made his way to London,\r\nwhere he was then vending cheap braces. This youth could neither read\r\nnor write, and seemed to possess no quickness or intelligence. The only\r\nthing of which he cared to talk was his step-mother’s treatment of him;\r\nall else was a blank with him, in comparison; this was the one burning\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that I heard of several instances of children\r\nhaving run away and adopted a street life in consequence of the\r\nviolence of step-mothers far more than of step-fathers.\r\n\r\nI cite the foregoing instance, as the boy’s career was exactly that\r\nI have described; but the reader will remember, that in the many and\r\ncurious narratives I have collected, how often the adult street-seller\r\nhas begun such a life by being a runaway from domestic tyranny.\r\nHad this Birmingham boy been less honest, or perhaps less dull, it\r\nwould have been far easier for him to have become a thief than a\r\nstreet-trader. To the gangs of young thieves, a new boy, who is not\r\nknown to the police is often (as a smart young pickpocket, then known\r\nas the Cocksparrow, described it to me) “a God-send.”\r\n\r\nMy readers will remember that in the collected statements of the\r\nstreet-folk, there are several accounts of runaways, but they were\r\ngenerally older than the age I have fixed, and it was necessary to give\r\nan account of one who comes within my classification of a child.\r\n\r\nI did not hear of any girls who had run away from their homes having\r\nbecome street-sellers merely. They more generally fall into a course\r\nof prostitution, or sometimes may be ostensibly street-sellers as a\r\nmeans of accosting men, and, perhaps, for an attractive pretence to the\r\ndepraved, that they are poor, innocent girls, struggling for an honest\r\npenny. If they resort to the low lodging-houses, where the sexes are\r\nlodged indiscriminately, their ruin seems inevitable.\r\n\r\n2. That the companionship and associations formed in tender years lead\r\nmany children to a street life is so evident, that I may be brief on\r\nthe subject. There are few who are in the habit of noting what they\r\nmay observe of poor children in the streets and quieter localities,\r\nwho have not seen little boys playing at marbles, or gambling with\r\nhalfpennies, farthings, or buttons, with other lads, and who have laid\r\ndown their basket of nuts or oranges to take part in the play. The\r\nyoung street-seller has probably more halfpence at his command, or, at\r\nany rate, in his possession, than his non-dealing playmates; he is also\r\nin the undoubted possession of what appears a large store of things for\r\nwhich poor boys have generally a craving and a relish. Thus the little\r\nitinerant trader is envied and imitated.\r\n\r\nThis attraction to a street career is very strong, I have ascertained,\r\namong the neglected children of the poor, when the parents are absent\r\nat their work. On a Saturday morning, some little time since, I was\r\nin a flagged court near Drury-lane, a wretched place, which was full\r\nof children of all ages. The parents were nearly all, I believe,\r\nthen at work, or “on the look out for a job,” as porters in Covent\r\nGarden-market, and the children played in the court until their\r\nreturn. In one corner was a group of four or five little boys gambling\r\nand squabbling for nuts, of which one of the number was a vendor. A\r\nsharp-looking lad was gazing enviously on, and I asked him to guide me\r\nto the room of a man whom I wished to see. He did so, and I gave him\r\na penny. On my leaving the court I found this boy the most eager of\r\nthe players, gambling with the penny I had given him. I had occasion\r\nto return there a few hours after, and the same lad was leaning\r\nagainst the wall, with his hands in his pockets, as if suffering from\r\nlistlessness. He had had no luck with the nut covey, he told me, but\r\nhe hoped before long to sell nuts himself. He did not know his age,\r\nbut he appeared to be about eleven. Only last week I saw this same\r\nlad hawking a basket, very indifferently stocked with oranges. He had\r\nraised a shilling, he said, and the “Early Bird” (the nickname of a\r\nyoung street-seller) had put him up to the way to lay it out. On my\r\nasking if his father (a journeyman butcher) knew what he was doing, he\r\nreplied that so long as he didn’t bother his father he could do what he\r\npleased, and the more he kept out of his (the father’s) way the better\r\nhe would be liked and treated.\r\n\r\nThe association of poor boys and girls with the children of the\r\ncostermongers, and of the Irish fruit-sellers, who are employed in\r\nitinerant vending, is often productive of a strong degree of envy on\r\nthe part of unemployed little ones, who look upon having the charge\r\nof a basket of fruit, to be carried in any direction, as a species of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n3. “The employment of children by costermongers, and others who live by\r\nstreet traffic; and the training of costermongers’ children to a street\r\nlife, is the ordinary means of increase among the street-folk.”\r\n\r\nThe children of the costermongers become necessarily, as I have\r\nalready intimated, street-dealers, and perhaps more innocently than\r\nin any other manner, by being required, as soon as their strength\r\nenables them, to assist their parents in their work, or sell trifles,\r\nsingle-handed, for the behoof of their parents. The child does but obey\r\nhis father, and the father does but rear the child to the calling\r\nby which his daily bread is won. This is the case particularly with\r\nthe Irish, who often have large families, and bring them with them to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, a great number of boys, “anybody’s children,” as\r\nI heard them called, who are tempted and trained to pursue an open-air\r\ntraffic, through being engaged by costermongers or small tradesmen\r\nto sell upon commission, or, as it is termed, for “bunse.” In the\r\ncurious, and almost in every instance novel, information which I gave\r\nto the public concerning the largest body of the street-sellers, the\r\ncostermongers, this word “bunse” (probably a corruption of _bonus_,\r\n_bone_ being the slang for good) first appeared in print. The mode\r\nis this: a certain quantity of saleable, and sometimes of not very\r\nsaleable, commodities is given to a boy whom a costermonger knows and\r\nperhaps employs, and it is arranged that the young commission-agent\r\nis to get a particular sum for them, which must be paid to the\r\ncostermonger; I will say 3_s._, that being somewhere about the maximum.\r\nFor these articles the lad may ask and obtain any price he can, and\r\nwhatever he obtains beyond the stipulated 3_s._ is his own profit or\r\n“bunse.” The remuneration thus accruing to the boy-vendor of course\r\nvaries very materially, according to the season of the year, the nature\r\nof the article, and the neighbourhood in which it is hawked. Much also\r\ndepends upon whether the boy has a regular market for his commodities;\r\nwhether he has certain parties to whom he is known and upon whom he\r\ncan call to solicit custom; if he has, of course his facilities for\r\ndisposing of his stock in trade are much greater than in the case of\r\none who has only the chance of attracting attention and obtaining\r\ncustom by mere crying and bawling “Penny a piece, Col-ly-flowers,”\r\n“Five bunches a penny, Red-dish-es,” and such like. The Irish boys call\r\nthis “having a back,” an old Hibernian phrase formerly applied to a\r\nvery different subject and purpose.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the abundance of street-dealers among the boyish\r\nfraternity, whose parents are unable or unwilling to support them, is\r\nthat some costers keep a lad as a regular assistant, whose duty it is\r\nto pull the barrow of his master about the streets, and assist him in\r\n“crying” his wares. Sometimes the man and the boy call out together,\r\nsometimes separately and alternately, but mostly the boy alone has to\r\ndo this part of the work, the coster’s voice being generally rough and\r\nhoarse, while the shrill sound of that of the boy re-echoes throughout\r\nthe street along which they slowly move, and is far more likely to\r\nstrike the ear, and consequently to attract attention, than that of\r\nthe man. This mode of “practising the voice” is, however, perfectly\r\nruinous to it, as in almost every case of this description we find the\r\nnatural tone completely annihilated at a very early age, and a harsh,\r\nhoarse, guttural, disagreeable mode of speaking acquired. In addition\r\nto the costers there are others who thus employ boys in the streets:\r\nthe hawkers of coal do so invariably, and the milkmen--especially those\r\nwho drive cows or have a cart to carry the milk-pails in. Once in the\r\nstreets and surrounded with street-associates, the boy soon becomes\r\ninured to this kind of life, and when he leaves his first master, will\r\nfrequently start in some branch of costermongering for himself, without\r\nseeking to obtain another constant employment.\r\n\r\nThis mode of employing lads, and on the whole perhaps they are fairly\r\nenough used by the costermongers, and generally treated with great\r\nkindness by the costers’ wives or concubines, is, I am inclined to\r\nthink, the chief cause of the abundance and even increase of the\r\nstreet-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables.\r\n\r\n4. To “orphanhood, friendlessness, and utter destitution,” the commerce\r\nof the streets owes a considerable portion of its merchants. A child\r\nfinds himself or herself an orphan; the parents having been miserably\r\npoor, he or she lives in a place where street-folk abound; it seems\r\nthe only road to a meal and a bed, and the orphan “starts” with a few\r\nlucifer-matches, boot-laces, nuts, or onions. It is the same when\r\na child, without being an orphan, is abandoned or neglected by the\r\nparents, and, perhaps without any injunctions either for or against\r\nsuch a course, is left to his or her own will to sell or steal in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n5. The vagrant dispositions and tastes of lads, and, it may be, now and\r\nthen somewhat of a reckless spirit of adventure, which in our days has\r\nfar fewer fields than it once had, is another cause why a street-life\r\nis embraced. Lads have been known to run away from even comfortable\r\nhomes through the mere spirit of restlessness; and sometimes they have\r\ndone so, but not perhaps under the age of fifteen, for the unrestrained\r\nindulgence of licentious passions. As this class of runaways, however,\r\ndo not ordinarily settle into regular street-sellers, but become\r\npickpockets, or trade only with a view to cloak their designs of theft,\r\nI need not further allude to them under this head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now come to the second part of my subject, the _Pursuits_, &c., of\r\nthe children in street avocations.\r\n\r\nAs I have shown in my account of the women street-sellers, there is no\r\ncalling which this body of juveniles monopolize, none of which they are\r\nthe _sole_ possessors; but some are principally in their hands, and\r\nthere are others, again, to which they rarely incline.\r\n\r\nAmong the wares sold by the boys and girls of the streets\r\nare:--money-bags, lucifer-match boxes, leather straps, belts, firewood\r\n(common, and also “patent,” that is, dipped into an inflammable\r\ncomposition), fly-papers, a variety of fruits, especially nuts,\r\noranges, and apples; onions, radishes, water-cresses, cut flowers and\r\nlavender (mostly sold by girls), sweet-briar, India rubber, garters,\r\nand other little articles of the same material, including elastic rings\r\nto encircle rolls of paper-music, toys of the smaller kinds, cakes,\r\nsteel pens and penholders with glass handles, exhibition medals and\r\ncards, gelatine cards, glass and other cheap seals, brass watch-guards,\r\nchains, and rings; small tin ware, nutmeg-graters, and other articles\r\nof a similar description, such as are easily portable; iron skewers,\r\nfuzees, shirt buttons, boot and stay-laces, pins (and more rarely\r\nneedles), cotton bobbins, Christmasing (holly and other evergreens at\r\nChristmas-tide), May-flowers, coat-studs, toy-pottery, blackberries,\r\ngroundsel and chickweed, and clothes’-pegs.\r\n\r\nThere are also other things which children sell temporarily, or rather\r\nin the season. This year I saw lads selling wild birds’-nests with\r\ntheir eggs, such as hedge-sparrows, minnows in small glass globes,\r\nroots of the wild Early Orchis (Orchis mascula), and such like things\r\nfound only out of town.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the vending of these articles, there are many\r\nother ways of earning a penny among the street boys: among them are\r\nfound--tumblers, mud-larks, water-jacks, Ethiopians, ballad-singers,\r\nbagpipe boys, the variety of street musicians (especially Italian boys\r\nwith organs), Billingsgate boys or young “roughs,” Covent Garden boys,\r\nporters, and shoeblacks (a class recently increased by the Ragged\r\nSchool Brigade). A great many lads are employed also in giving away the\r\ncards and placards of advertising and puffing tradesmen, and around\r\nthe theatres are children of both sexes (along with a few old people)\r\noffering play-bills for sale, but this is an occupation less pursued\r\nthan formerly, as some managers sell their own bills inside the house\r\nand do not allow any to pass from the hands of the printer into those\r\nof the former vendors. Again: amid the employments of this class may\r\nbe mentioned--the going on errands and carrying parcels for persons\r\naccidentally met with; holding horses; sweeping crossings (but the best\r\ncrossings are usually in the possession of adults); carrying trunks for\r\nany railway traveller to or from the terminus, and carrying them from\r\nan omnibus when the passenger is not put down at his exact destination.\r\nDuring the frosty days of the winter and early spring, some of these\r\nlittle fellows used to run along the foot-path--Baker-street was a\r\nfavourite place for this display--and keep pace with the omnibuses, not\r\nmerely by using their legs briskly, but by throwing themselves every\r\nnow and then on their hands and progressing a few steps (so to speak)\r\nwith their feet in the air. This was done to attract attention and\r\nobtain the preference if a job were in prospect; done, too, in hopes\r\nof a halfpenny being given the urchin for his agility. I looked at the\r\nhands of one of these little fellows and the fleshy parts of the palm\r\nwere as hard as soling-leather, as hard, indeed, as the soles of the\r\nchild’s feet, for he was bare-footed. At the doors of the theatres, and\r\nof public places generally, boys are always in waiting to secure a cab\r\nfrom the stand, their best harvest being when the night has “turned out\r\nwet” after a fine day. Boys wait for the same purpose, lounging all\r\nnight, and until the place closes, about the night-houses, casinos,\r\nsaloons, &c., and sometimes without receiving a penny. There are,\r\nagain, the very many ways in which street boys employed to “help” other\r\npeople, when temporary help is needed, as when a cabman must finish\r\nthe cleaning of his vehicle in a hurry, or when a porter finds himself\r\nover-weighted in his truck. Boys are, moreover, the common custodians\r\nof the donkeys on which young ladies take invigorating exercise in such\r\nplaces as Hampstead-heath and Blackheath. At pigeon-shooting matches\r\nthey are in readiness to pick up the dead birds, and secure the poor\r\nfluttering things which are “hard hit” by the adventurous sportsman,\r\nwithout having been killed. They have their share again in the picking\r\nof currants and gooseberries, the pottling of strawberries, in weeding,\r\n&c., &c., and though the younger children may be little employed in\r\nhaymaking, or in the more important labours of the corn harvest, they\r\nhave their shares, both with and without the company of their parents,\r\nin the “hopping.” In fine there is no business carried on to any extent\r\nin the streets, or in the open air, but it will be found that boys have\r\ntheir portion. Thus they are brought into contact with all classes;\r\nanother proof of what I have advanced touching the importance of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that, under this head, I have had to speak far\r\nmore frequently of boys than of girls, for the boy is far more the\r\nchild of the streets than is the girl. The female child can do little\r\nbut _sell_ (when a livelihood is to be gained without a recourse to\r\nimmorality); the boy can not only sell, but _work_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe many ramifications of child-life and of child-work in our teeming\r\nstreets, which I have just enumerated, render it difficult to arrive at\r\na very nice estimation of the _earnings of the street boys and girls_.\r\nThe gains of this week are not necessarily the gains of the next; there\r\nis the influence of the weather; there may be a larger or a smaller\r\nnumber of hands “taking a turn” at any particular calling this week\r\nthan in its predecessor; and, above all, there is that concatenation\r\nof circumstances, which street-sellers include in one expressive\r\nword--“luck.” I mean the opportunities to earn a few pence, which on\r\nsome occasions present themselves freely, and at others do not occur at\r\nall. Such “luck,” however, is more felt by the holders of horses, and\r\nthe class of waiters upon opportunity (so to speak), than by those who\r\ndepend upon trade.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, both in consequence of what I have observed, and\r\nfrom the concurrent testimony of persons familiar with the child-life\r\nof London streets, that the earnings of the children, when they are\r\nhealthful and active, are about the same in the several capacities\r\nthey exercise. The waiter on opportunity, the lad “on the look-out for\r\na job,” may wait and look out all day bootlessly, but in the evening\r\nsome fortunate chance may realize him “a whole tanner all in a lump.”\r\nIn like manner, the water-cress girl may drudge on from early morning\r\nuntil “cresses” are wanted for tea, and, with “a connection,” and\r\na tolerably regular demand, earn no more than the boy’s 6_d._, and\r\nprobably not so much.\r\n\r\nOne of the most profitable callings of the street-child is in the sale\r\nof Christmasing, but that is only for a very brief season; the most\r\nregular returns in the child’s trade, are in the sale of such things\r\nas water-cresses, or any low-priced article of daily consumption,\r\nwherever the youthful vendor may be known.\r\n\r\nI find it necessary to place the earnings of the street-children higher\r\nthan those of the aged and infirm. The children are more active, more\r\npersevering, and perhaps more impudent. They are less deterred by the\r\nweather, and can endure more fatigue in walking long distances than old\r\npeople. This, however, relates to the boys more especially, some of\r\nwhom are very sturdy fellows.\r\n\r\nThe oranges which the street-children now vend at two a-penny, leave\r\nthem a profit of 4_d._ in the shilling. To take 1_s._ 6_d._ with a\r\nprofit of 6_d._ is a fair day’s work; to take 1_s._ with a profit of\r\n4_d._ is a poor day’s work. The dozen bunches of cut-flowers which a\r\ngirl will sell on an average day at 1_d._ a bunch, cost her 6_d._,\r\nthat sum being also her profit. These things supply, I think, a fair\r\ncriterion. The children’s profits may be 6_d._ a day, and including\r\nSunday trade, 3_s._ 6_d._ a week; but with the drawbacks of bad\r\nweather, they cannot be computed at more than 2_s._ 6_d._ a week the\r\nyear through. The boys may earn 2_d._ or 3_d._ a week on an average\r\nmore than the girls, except in such things (which I shall specify under\r\nthe next head) as seem more particularly suited for female traffic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Of the causes which influence children to follow this or that course\r\nof business_ when a street career has been their choice or their lot,\r\nI have little to say. It seems quite a matter of chance, even where a\r\npreference may exist. A runaway lad meets with a comrade who perhaps\r\nsells fuzees, and he accordingly begins on fuzees. One youth, of whom\r\nI have given an account (but he was not of child’s estate), began his\r\nstreet career on fly-papers. When children are sent into the streets to\r\nsell on account of their parents, they, of course, vend just what their\r\nparents have supplied to them. If “on their own hook,” they usually\r\ncommence their street career on what it is easiest to buy and easiest\r\nto sell; a few nuts or oranges bought in Duke’s-place, lucifer-boxes,\r\nor small wares. As their experience increases they may become general\r\nstreet-sellers. The duller sort will continue to carry on the trades\r\nthat any one with ordinary lungs and muscles can pursue. “All a fellow\r\nwants to know to sell potatoes,” said a master street-seller to me, “is\r\nto tell how many tanners make a bob, and how many yenaps a tanner.”\r\n[How many sixpences make a shilling, and how many pence a sixpence.]\r\nThe smarter and bolder lads ripen into patterers, or street-performers,\r\nor fall into theft. For the class of adventurous runaways, the\r\npatterer’s, or, rather, the paper-working patterer’s life, with its\r\nalternations of town and country, fairs and hangings, the bustle of\r\nrace-grounds and the stillness of a village, has great attractions. To\r\na pattering and chaunting career, moreover, there is the stimulus of\r\nthat love of approbation and of admiration, as strong among the often\r\npenniless professionals of the streets as on the boards of the opera\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is not a child of either sex, now a street-seller, who\r\nwould not to-morrow, if they thought they could clear a penny or two a\r\nday more by it, quit their baskets of oranges and sell candle-ends, or\r\nold bones, or anything. In a street career, and most especially when\r\nunited with a lodging-house existence, there is no daintiness of the\r\nsenses and no exercise of the tastes: the question is not “What do I\r\nlike best to sell?” but “What is likely to pay me best?” This cannot\r\nbe wondered at; for if a child earn but 5_d._ a day on apples, and can\r\nmake 6_d._ on onions, its income is increased by 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe trades which I have specified as in the hands of street-children\r\nare carried on by both sexes. I do not know that even the stock in\r\ntrade which most taxes the strength is more a boy’s than a girl’s\r\npursuit. A basket of oranges or of apples is among the heaviest of\r\nall the stocks hawked by children; and in those pursuits there are\r\ncertainly as many, or rather more, girls than boys. Such articles as\r\nfly-papers, money-bags, tins, fuzees, and Christmasing, are chiefly the\r\nboys’ sale; cut-flowers, lavender, water-cresses, and small wares, are\r\nmore within the trading of the girls.\r\n\r\nThe callings with which children do not meddle are those which require\r\n“patter.” Some of the boys very glibly announce their wares, and may be\r\nprofuse now and then in commendations of their quality, cheapness, and\r\nsuperiority, but it requires a longer experience to patter according\r\nto the appreciation of a perhaps critical street audience. No child,\r\nfor instance, ventures upon the sale of grease-removing compositions,\r\ncorn-salve, or the “Trial and Execution of Thomas Drory,” with an\r\n“Affecting Copy of Werses.”\r\n\r\nA gentleman remarked to me that it was rather curious that boys’\r\nplaythings, such as marbles and tops, were not hawked by street\r\njuveniles, who might be very well able to recommend them. I do not\r\nremember to have seen any such things vended by children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Education_ is, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more widely\r\nextended among street children than it was twelve or fifteen years\r\nago. The difficulty in arriving at any conclusion on such a subject is\r\nowing to the inability to find any one who knew, or could even form a\r\ntolerably accurate judgment of what was the state of education among\r\nthese juveniles even twelve years back.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be sufficiently correct to say that among a given number\r\nof street children, where, a dozen years ago, you met twenty who could\r\nread, you will now meet upwards of thirty. Of sixteen children, none\r\napparently fifteen years of age, whom I questioned on the subject,\r\nnine admitted that they could not read; the other seven declared that\r\nthey could, but three annexed to the avowal the qualifying words--“a\r\nlittle.” Ten were boys and six were girls, and I spoke to them\r\npromiscuously as I met them in the street. Two were Irish lads, who\r\nwere “working” oranges in company, and the bigger answered--“Shure,\r\nthin, we _can_ rade, your honour, sir.” I have little doubt that they\r\ncould, but in all probability, had either of those urchins thought\r\nhe would be a penny the better by it, he would have professed, to a\r\nperfect stranger, that he had a knowledge of algebra. “Yis, sir, I do,\r\nthin,” would very likely be his response to any such inquiry; and when\r\ntold he could not possibly know anything about it, he would answer,\r\n“Arrah, thin, but I didn’t understand your honour.”\r\n\r\nTo the Ragged Schools is, in all probability, owing this extension\r\nof the ability to read. It appears that the attendance of the street\r\nchildren at the Ragged School is most uncertain; as, indeed, must\r\nnecessarily be the case where the whole time of the lad is devoted to\r\nobtaining a subsistence. From the best information I can collect, it\r\nappears that the average attendance of these boys at these schools does\r\nnot exceed two hours per week, so that the amount of education thus\r\nacquired, if education it may be called, must necessarily be scanty in\r\nthe extreme; and is frequently forgotten as soon as learned.\r\n\r\nWith many of these little traders a natural shrewdness compensates in\r\nsome measure for the deficiency of education, and enables them to carry\r\non their variety of trades with readiness and dexterity, and sometimes\r\nwith exactness. One boy with whom I had a conversation, told me that he\r\nnever made any mistake about the “coppers,” although, as I subsequently\r\ndiscovered, he had no notion at all of arithmetic beyond the capability\r\nof counting how many pieces of coin he had, and how much copper money\r\nwas required to make a “tanner” or a “bob.” This boy vended coat-studs:\r\nhe had also some metal collars for dogs, or as he said, “for cats\r\naither.” These articles he purchased at the same shop in Houndsditch,\r\nwhere “there was a wonderful lot of other things to be had, on’y some\r\non ’em cost more money.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking of money, the slang phrases are constantly used by the\r\nstreet lads; thus a sixpence is a “tanner,” a shilling a “bob,” or a\r\n“hog;” a crown is “a bull;” a half-crown “a half bull,” &c. Little, as\r\na modern writer has remarked, do the persons using these phrases know\r\nof their remote and somewhat classical origin, which may, indeed, be\r\ntraced to the period antecedent to that when monarchs monopolized the\r\nsurface of coined money with their own images and superscriptions.\r\nThey are identical with the very name of money among the early Romans,\r\nwhich was _pecunia_, from _pecus_, a flock. The collections of coin\r\ndealers amply show, that the figure of a hog was anciently placed on\r\na small silver coin, and that that of a bull decorated larger ones\r\nof the same metal: these coins were frequently deeply crossed on the\r\nreverse: this was for the convenience of easily breaking them into two\r\nor more pieces, should the bargain for which they were employed require\r\nit, and the parties making it had no smaller change handy to complete\r\nthe transaction. Thus we find that the “half-bull” of the itinerant\r\nstreet-seller or “traveller,” so far from being a phrase of modern\r\ninvention, as is generally supposed, is in point of fact referable to\r\nan era extremely remote. Numerous other instances might be given of\r\nthe classical origin of many of the flash or slang words used by these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI now give the answers I received from two boys. The first, his mother\r\ntold me, was the best scholar at his school when he was there, and\r\nbefore he had to help her in street sale. He was a pale, and not at\r\nall forward boy, of thirteen or fourteen, and did not appear much to\r\nadmire being questioned. He had not been to a Ragged School, but to an\r\n“academy” kept by an old man. He did not know what the weekly charge\r\nwas, but when father was living (he died last autumn) the schoolmaster\r\nused to take it out in vegetables. Father was a costermonger; mother\r\nminded all about his schooling, and master often said she behaved to\r\nhim like a lady. “God,” this child told me, “was our Heavenly Father,\r\nand the maker of all things; he knew everything and everybody; he knew\r\npeople’s thoughts and every sin they committed if no one else knew\r\nit. His was the kingdom and the power, and the glory, for ever and\r\never, Amen. Jesus Christ was our Lord and Saviour; he was the son of\r\nGod, and was crucified for our sins. He was a God himself.” [The child\r\nunderstood next to nothing of the doctrine of the Trinity, and I did\r\nnot press him.] “The Scriptures, which were the Bible and Testament,\r\nwere the Word of God, and contained nothing but what was good and true.\r\nIf a boy lied, or stole, or committed sins,” he said, “he would be\r\npunished in the next world, which endured for ever and ever, Amen. It\r\nwas only after death, when it was too late to repent, that people went\r\nto the next world. He attended chapel, sometimes.”\r\n\r\nAs to mundane matters, the boy told me that Victoria was Queen of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. She was born May 24, 1819, and succeeded his\r\nlate Majesty, King William IV., July 20, 1837. She was married to his\r\nRoyal Highness Prince Albert, &c., &c. France was a different country\r\nto this: he had heard there was no king or queen there, but didn’t\r\nunderstand about it. You couldn’t go to France by land, no more than\r\nyou could to Ireland. Didn’t know anything of the old times in history;\r\nhadn’t been told. Had heard of the battle of Waterloo; the English\r\nlicked. Had heard of the battle of Trafalgar, and of Lord Nelson;\r\ndidn’t know much about him; but there was his pillar at Charing-cross,\r\njust by the candlesticks (fountains). When I spoke of astronomy, the\r\nboy at once told me he knew nothing about it. He had heard that the\r\nearth went round the sun, but from what he’d noticed, shouldn’t have\r\nthought it. He didn’t think that the sun went round the earth, it\r\nseemed to go more sideways. Would like to read more, if he had time,\r\nbut he had a few books, and there was hundreds not so well off as he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nI am far from undervaluing, indeed I would not indulge in an approach\r\nto a scoff, at the extent of this boy’s knowledge. Many a man who\r\npiques himself on the plenitude of his breeches’ pocket, and who\r\nattributes his success in life to the fulness of his knowledge, knows\r\nno more of Nature, Man, and God, than this poor street child.\r\n\r\nAnother boy, perhaps a few months older, gave me his notions of men\r\nand things. He was a thick-limbed, red-cheeked fellow; answered very\r\nfreely, and sometimes, when I could not help laughing at his replies,\r\nlaughed loudly himself, as if he entered into the joke.\r\n\r\nYes, he had heer’d of God who made the world. Couldn’t exactly\r\nrecollec’ when he’d heer’d on him, but he had, most sarten-ly. Didn’t\r\nknow when the world was made, or how anybody could do it. It must have\r\ntaken a long time. It was afore his time, “or yourn either, sir.” Knew\r\nthere was a book called the Bible; didn’t know what it was about;\r\ndidn’t mind to know; knew of such a book to a sartinty, because a young\r\n’oman took one to pop (pawn) for an old ’oman what was on the spree--a\r\nbran new ’un--but the cove wouldn’t have it, and the old ’oman said he\r\nmight be d----d. Never heer’d tell on the deluge; of the world having\r\nbeen drownded; it couldn’t, for there wasn’t water enough to do it.\r\nHe weren’t a going to fret hisself for such things as that. Didn’t\r\nknow what happened to people after death, only that they was buried.\r\nHad seen a dead body laid out; was a little afeared at first; poor\r\nDick looked so different, and when you touched his face, he was so\r\ncold! oh, so cold! Had heer’d on another world; wouldn’t mind if he\r\nwas there hisself, if he could do better, for things was often queer\r\nhere. Had heered on it from a tailor--such a clever cove, a stunner--as\r\nwent to ’Straliar (Australia), and heer’d him say he was going into\r\nanother world. Had never heer’d of France, but had heer’d of Frenchmen;\r\nthere wasn’t half a quarter so many on ’em as of Italians, with their\r\nearrings like flash gals. Didn’t dislike foreigners, for he never saw\r\nnone. What was they? Had heer’d of Ireland. Didn’t know where it was,\r\nbut it couldn’t be very far, or such lots wouldn’t come from there to\r\nLondon. Should say they walked it, aye, every bit of the way, for he’d\r\nseen them come in, all covered with dust. Had heer’d of people going\r\nto sea, and had seen the ships in the river, but didn’t know nothing\r\nabout it, for he was very seldom that way. The sun was made of fire,\r\nor it wouldn’t make you feel so warm. The stars was fire, too, or they\r\nwouldn’t shine. They didn’t make it warm, they was too small. Didn’t\r\nknow any use they was of. Didn’t know how far they was off; a jolly\r\nlot higher than the gas lights some on ’em was. Was never in a church;\r\nhad heer’d they worshipped God there; didn’t know how it was done; had\r\nheer’d singing and playing inside when he’d passed; never was there,\r\nfor he had’nt no togs to go in, and wouldn’t be let in among such\r\nswells as he had seen coming out. Was a ignorant chap, for he’d never\r\nbeen to school, but was up to many a move, and didn’t do bad. Mother\r\nsaid he would make his fortin yet.\r\n\r\nHad heer’d of the Duke of Wellington; he was Old Nosey; didn’t think\r\nhe ever seed him, but had seed his statty. Hadn’t heer’d of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, nor who it was atween; once lived in Webber-row,\r\nWaterloo-road. Thought he had heerd speak of Buonaparte; didn’t know\r\nwhat he was; thought he had heer’d of Shakespeare, but didn’t know\r\nwhether he was alive or dead, and didn’t care. A man with something\r\nlike that name kept a dolly and did stunning; but he was sich a hard\r\ncove that if _he_ was dead it wouldn’t matter. Had seen the Queen,\r\nbut didn’t recollec’ her name just at the minute; oh! yes, Wictoria\r\nand Albert. Had no notion what the Queen had to do. Should think she\r\nhadn’t such power [he had first to ask me what ‘power’ was] as the Lord\r\nMayor, or as Mr. Norton as was the Lambeth beak, and perhaps is still.\r\nWas never once before a beak and didn’t want to. Hated the crushers;\r\nwhat business had they to interfere with him if he was only resting his\r\nbasket in a street? Had been once to the Wick, and once to the Bower:\r\nliked tumbling better; he meant to have a little pleasure when the peas\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge and the ignorance of these two striplings represent\r\nthat of street children generally. Those who may have run away from a\r\ngood school, or a better sort of home as far as means constitute such\r\nbetterness, of course form exceptions. So do the utterly stupid.\r\n\r\n_The Morals, Religion, and Opinions of the street-trading children_ are\r\nthe next topic. Their business morals have been indicated in the course\r\nof my former statements, and in the general tone of the remarks and\r\nconversation of street-sellers.\r\n\r\nAs traders their morals may be lax enough. They give short weight, and\r\nthey give short measure; they prick the juice out of oranges; and brush\r\nup old figs to declare they’re new. Their silk braces are cotton, their\r\nbuck-leather braces are wash-leather, their sponge is often rotten, and\r\ntheir salves and cures quackeries.\r\n\r\nSpeak to any one of the quicker-witted street-sellers on the subject,\r\nand though he may be unable to deny that his brother traders are\r\nguilty of these short-comings, he will justify them all by the example\r\nof shopkeepers. One man, especially, with whom I have more than once\r\nconversed on the subject, broadly asserts that as a whole the streets\r\nare in all matters of business honester than the shops. “It ain’t\r\n_we_,” runs the purport of his remarks, “as makes coffee out of sham\r\nchickory; it ain’t _we_ as makes cigars out of rhubarb leaves; _we_\r\ndon’t make duffers handkerchiefs, nor weave cotton things and call them\r\nsilk. If we quacks a bit, does _we_ make fortins by it as shopkeepers\r\ndoes with their ointments and pills! If we give slang weights, how many\r\nrich shopkeepers is fined for that there? And how many’s never found\r\nout? And when one on ’em’s fined, why he calculates how much he’s into\r\npocket, between what he’s made by slanging, and what he’s been fined,\r\nand on he goes again. _He_ didn’t know that there ever was short weight\r\ngiven in his shop: not _he_! No more do _we_ at our stalls or barrows!\r\nWho ’dulterates the beer? Who makes old tea-leaves into new? Who grinds\r\nrice among pepper? And as for smuggling--but nobody thinks there’s any\r\nharm in buying smuggled things. What _we_ does is like that pencil\r\nyou’re writing with to a great tree, compared to what the rich people\r\ndoes. O, don’t tell me, sir, a gentleman like you that sees so much of\r\nwhat’s going on, must know _we’re_ better than the shopkeepers are.”\r\n\r\nTo remarks such as these I have nothing to answer. It would be idle to\r\npoint out to such casuists, that the commission of one wrong can never\r\njustify another. The ignorant reverse the doctrine of right, and live,\r\nnot by rule, but by example. I have unsparingly exposed the rogueries\r\nand trickeries of the street people, and it is but fair that one of\r\nthem should be heard in explanation, if not in justification. The trade\r\nethics of the adult street-folk are also those of the juveniles, so on\r\nthis subject I need dwell no longer.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the religion of the women street-sellers applies\r\nwith equal truth to the children. Their religious feelings are\r\ngenerally formed for them by their parents, especially their mothers.\r\nIf the children have no such direction, then they have no religion. I\r\ndid not question the street-seller before quoted on this subject of the\r\nwant of the Christian spirit among his fraternity, old or young, or he\r\nwould at once have asked me, in substance, to tell him in what class of\r\nsociety the real Christian spirit was to be found?\r\n\r\nAs to the opinions of the street-children I can say little. For the\r\nmost part they have formed no opinions of anything beyond what affects\r\ntheir daily struggles for bread. Of politics such children can know\r\nnothing. If they are anything, they are Chartists in feeling, and\r\nare in general honest haters of the police and of most constituted\r\nauthorities, whom they often confound with the police officer. As\r\nto their opinions of the claims of friendship, and of the duty of\r\nassisting one another, I believe these children feel and understand\r\nnothing about such matters. The hard struggles of their lives, and\r\nthe little sympathy they meet with, make them selfish. There may be\r\ncompanionship among them, but no friendship, and this applies, I think,\r\nalike to boys and girls. The boy’s opinion of the girl seems to be that\r\nshe is made to help _him_, or to supply gratification to his passions.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a difficult inquiry,--as to the opinions which are\r\nformed by the young females reared to a street-life. I fear that\r\nthose opinions are not, and cannot be powerfully swayed in favour of\r\nchastity, especially if the street-girl have the quickness to perceive\r\nthat marriage is not much honoured among the most numerous body of\r\nstreet-folk. If she have not the quickness to understand this, then her\r\nignorance is in itself most dangerous to her virtue. She may hear, too,\r\nexpressions of an opinion that “going to church to be wed” is only to\r\nput money into the clergyman’s, or as these people say the “parson’s,”\r\npocket. Without the watchful care of the mother, the poor girl may form\r\nan illicit connection, with little or no knowledge that she is doing\r\nwrong; and perhaps a kind and indulgent mother may be herself but a\r\nconcubine, feeling little respect for a ceremony she did not scruple\r\nto dispense with. To such opinions, however, the Irish furnish the\r\nexception.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dwelling-places of the street-children_ are in the same localities\r\nas I specified regarding the women. Those who reside with their\r\nparents or employers sleep usually in the same room with them, and\r\nsometimes in the same bed. Nearly the whole of those, however, who\r\nsupport themselves by street-trade live, or rather sleep, in the\r\nlodging-houses. It is the same with those who live by street-vagrancy\r\nor begging, or by street-theft; and for this lazy or dishonest class\r\nof children the worst description of lodging-houses have the strongest\r\nattractions, as they meet continually with “tramps” from the country,\r\nand keep up a constant current of scheming and excitement.\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat curious that, considering the filth and noisomeness\r\nof some of these lodging-houses, the children who are inmates suffer\r\nonly the average extent of sickness and mortality common to the\r\ndistricts crammed with the poor. Perhaps it may be accounted for by\r\nthe circumstance of their being early risers, and their being in the\r\nopen air all day, so that they are fatigued at the close of the day,\r\nand their sleep is deep and unbroken. I was assured by a well-educated\r\nman, who was compelled to resort to such places, that he has seen\r\nchildren sleep most profoundly in a lodging-house throughout a loud and\r\nlong-continued disturbance. Many street-children who are either “alone\r\nin the world,” or afraid to return home after a bad day’s sale, sleep\r\nin the markets or under the dry arches.\r\n\r\nThere are many other lads who, being unable to pay the 1_d._, 2_d._, or\r\n3_d._ demanded, in pre-payment, by the lodging-house keepers, pass the\r\nnight in the streets, wherever shelter may be attainable. The number of\r\noutcast boys and girls who sleep in and about the purlieus of Covent\r\nGarden-market each night, especially during the summer months, has been\r\ncomputed variously, and no doubt differs according to circumstances;\r\nbut those with whom I have spoken upon the subject, and who of all\r\nothers are most likely to know, consider the average to be upwards of\r\n200.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Diet of the street-children_ is in some cases an alternation of\r\nsurfeit and inanition, more especially that of the stripling who is\r\n“on his own hook.” If money be unexpectedly attained, a boy will gorge\r\nhimself with such dainties as he loves; if he earn no money, he will\r\nfast all day patiently enough, perhaps drinking profusely of water.\r\nA cake-seller told me that a little while before I saw him a lad of\r\ntwelve or so had consumed a shilling’s worth of cakes and pastry, as\r\nhe had got a shilling by “fiddling;” not, be it understood, by the\r\nexercise of any musical skill, for “fiddling,” among the initiated,\r\nmeans the holding of horses, or the performing of any odd jobs.\r\n\r\nOf these cakes and pastry--the cakes being from two to twelve a penny,\r\nand the pastry, tarts, and “Coventrys” (three-cornered tarts) two a\r\npenny--the street-urchins are very fond. To me they seemed to possess\r\nno recommendation either to the nose or the palate. The “strong”\r\nflavour of these preparations is in all probability as grateful to the\r\npalate of an itinerant youth, as is the high _gout_ of the grouse or\r\nthe woodcock to the fashionable epicure. In this respect, as in others\r\nwhich I have pointed out, the “extremes” of society “meet.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply far more to the male than to the female children.\r\nSome of the street-boys will walk a considerable distance, when\r\nthey are in funds, to buy pastry of the Jew-boys in the Minories,\r\nHoundsditch, and Whitechapel; those keen traders being reputed, and no\r\ndoubt with truth, to supply the best cakes and pastry of any.\r\n\r\nA more staple article of diet, which yet partakes of the character\r\nof a dainty, is in great demand by the class I treat of--pudding. A\r\nhalfpenny or a penny-worth of baked plum, boiled plum (or plum dough),\r\ncurrant or plum batter (batter-pudding studded with raisins), is\r\noften a dinner. This pudding is almost always bought in the shops;\r\nindeed, in a street apparatus there could hardly be the necessary heat\r\ndiffused over the surface required; and as I have told of a distance\r\nbeing travelled to buy pastry of the Jew-boys, so is it traversed to\r\nbuy pudding at the best shops. The proprietor of one of those shops,\r\nupon whom I called to make inquiries, told me that he sold about\r\n300 pennyworths of pudding in a day. Two-thirds of this quantity he\r\nsold to juveniles under fifteen years of age; but he hadn’t noticed\r\nparticularly, and so could only guess. This man, when he understood\r\nthe object of my inquiry, insisted upon my tasting his “batter,” which\r\nreally was very good, and tasted--I do not know how otherwise to\r\ndescribe it--honest. His profits were not large, he said, and judging\r\nfrom the size and quality of his oblong halfpenny and pennyworth’s of\r\nbatter pudding, I have no doubt he stated the fact. “There’s many a\r\npoor man and woman,” he said, “aye, sir, and some that you would think\r\nfrom their appearance might go to an eating-house to dine, make a meal\r\noff my pudding, as well as the street little ones. The boys are often\r\ntiresome: ‘Master,’ they’ll say, ‘can’t you give us a plummier bit than\r\nthis?’ or, ‘Is it just up? I likes it ’ot, all ’ot.’”\r\n\r\nThe “baked tatur,” from the street-dealer’s can more frequently than\r\nfrom the shops, is another enjoyable portion of the street child’s\r\ndiet. Of the sale to the juvenile population of pickled whelks, stewed\r\neels, oysters, boiled meat puddings, and other articles of street\r\ntraffic, I have spoken under their respective heads.\r\n\r\nThe Irish children who live with their parents fare as the parents\r\nfare. If very poor, or if bent upon saving for some purpose, their diet\r\nis tea and bread and butter, or bread without butter. If not so _very_\r\npoor, still tea, &c., but sometimes with a little fish, and sometimes\r\nwith a piece of meat on Sundays; but the Sunday’s meat is more common\r\namong the poor English than the poor Irish street-traders; indeed the\r\nEnglish street-traders generally “live better” than the Irish. The\r\ncoster-boys often fare well and abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe children living in the lodging-houses, I am informed, generally,\r\npartake only of such meals as they can procure abroad. Sometimes of\r\na night they may partake of the cheap beef or mutton, purveyed by\r\nsome inmate who has been “lifting flesh” (stealing meat) or “sawney”\r\n(bacon). Vegetables, excepting the baked potato, they rarely taste. Of\r\nanimal food, perhaps, they partake more of bacon, and relish it the\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nDrinking is not, from what I can learn, common among the street boys.\r\nThe thieves are generally sober fellows, and of the others, when they\r\nare “in luck,” a half-pint of beer, to relish the bread and saveloy of\r\nthe dinner, and a pennyworth of gin “to keep the cold out,” are often\r\nthe extent of the potations. The exceptions are among the ignorant\r\ncoster-lads, who when they have been prosperous in their “bunse,”\r\ndrink, and ape the vices of men. The girls, I am told, are generally\r\nfonder of gin than the boys. Elderwine and gingerbeer are less popular\r\namong children than they used to be. Many of the lads smoke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Amusements of the street-children_ are such as I have described\r\nin my account of the costermongers, but in a moderate degree, as those\r\nwho partake with the greatest zest of such amusements as the Penny\r\nGaff (penny theatre) and the Twopenny Hop (dance) are more advanced\r\nin years. Many of the Penny Gaffs, however, since I last wrote on the\r\nsubject, have been suppressed, and the Twopenny Hops are not half\r\nso frequent as they were five or six years back. The Jew-boys of\r\nthe streets play at draughts or dominoes in coffee-shops which they\r\nfrequent; in one in the London-road at which I had occasion to call\r\nwere eight of these urchins thus occupied; and they play for money or\r\nits equivalent, but these sedentary games obtain little among the other\r\nand more restless street-lads. I believe that not one-half of them\r\n“know the cards,” but they are fond of gambling at pitch and toss, for\r\nhalfpennies or farthings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Clothing of the street-children_, however it may vary in texture,\r\nfashion, and colour, has one pervading characteristic--it is never\r\nmade for the wearers. The exceptions to this rule seem to be those,\r\nwhen a child has run away and retains, through good fortune or natural\r\nacuteness, the superior attire he wore before he made the choice--if\r\nchoice he had--of a street life; and where the pride of a mother whose\r\ncostermonger husband is “getting on,” clothes little Jack or Bill in\r\na new Sunday suit. Even then the suit is more likely to be bought\r\nready-made than “made to measure,” nor is it worn in business hours\r\nuntil the gloss of novelty has departed.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls wear every variety of clothing; it is often begged,\r\nbut if bought is bought from the fusty stocks of old clothes in\r\nPetticoat and Rosemary-lanes. These rags are worn by the children as\r\nlong as they will hold, or can be tied or pinned together, and when\r\nthey drop off from continued wear, from dirt, and from the ravages of\r\nvermin, the child sets his wits to work to procure more. One mode of\r\nobtaining a fresh supply is far less available than it was three or\r\nfour years back. This was for the lads to denude themselves of their\r\nrags, and tearing them up in the casual-ward of a workhouse, as it were\r\ncompel the parish-officers to provide them with fresh apparel.\r\n\r\nThis mode may be successful in parts of the country still, but it is\r\nnot so, or to a very limited extent, in town. The largest, and what was\r\naccounted by the vagrants the most liberal, of all the casual wards\r\nof the metropolitan workhouses, that of Marylebone, has been closed\r\nabove two years. So numerous were the applicants for admission, and\r\nso popular among the vagrants was Marylebone workhouse, that a fever\r\nresulted, and attacked that large establishment. It was not uncommon\r\nfor the Irish who trudged up from Liverpool, to be advised by some\r\nLondon vagrant whom they met, to go at once, when they reached the\r\ncapital, to Marylebone workhouse, and that the Irishman might not\r\nforget a name that was new to him, his friendly adviser would write it\r\ndown for him, and a troop of poor wretched Irish children, with parents\r\nas wretched, would go to Marylebone workhouse, and in their ignorance\r\nor simplicity, present the address which had been given to them, as if\r\nit were a regular order for admission! Boys have sometimes committed\r\noffences that they might get into prison, and as they contrived that\r\ntheir apparel should be unfit for purposes of decency, or perhaps\r\ntheir rags had become unfit to wear, they could not be sent naked into\r\nthe streets again, and so had clothing given to them. A shirt will\r\nbe worn by one of those wretched urchins, without washing, until it\r\nfalls asunder, and many have no shirts. The girls are on the whole\r\nless ragged than the boys, the most disgusting parts of their persons\r\nor apparel--I speak here more of the vagrant or the mixed vagrant\r\ntrading and selling girl (often a child prostitute) than of the regular\r\nstreet-seller--the worst particular of these girls’ appearance, I\r\nrepeat, is in their foul and matted hair, which looks as if it would\r\ndefy sponge, comb, and brush to purify it, and in the broken and filthy\r\nboots and stockings, which they seem never to button or to garter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Propensities of the street-children_ are the last division of my\r\ninquiry, and an ample field is presented, alike for wonder, disgust,\r\npity, hope, and regret.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable characteristic of these wretched children\r\nis their extraordinary licentiousness. Nothing can well exceed the\r\nextreme animal fondness for the opposite sex which prevails amongst\r\nthem; some rather singular circumstances connected with this subject\r\nhave come to my knowledge, and from these facts it would appear that\r\nthe age of puberty, or something closely resembling it, may be attained\r\nat a much less numerical amount of years than that at which most\r\nwriters upon the human species have hitherto fixed it. Probably such\r\ncircumstances as the promiscuous sleeping together of both sexes, the\r\nexample of the older persons indulging in the grossest immorality in\r\nthe presence of the young, and the use of obscene expressions, may\r\ntend to produce or force an unnatural precocity, a precocity sure to\r\nundermine health and shorten life. Jealousy is another characteristic\r\nof these children, and perhaps less among the girls than the boys. Upon\r\nthe most trivial offence in this respect, or on the suspicion of an\r\noffence, the “gals” are sure to be beaten cruelly and savagely by their\r\n“chaps.” This appears to be a very common case.\r\n\r\nThe details of filthiness and of all uncleanness which I gave in a\r\nrecent number as things of course in certain lodging-houses, render it\r\nunnecessary to dwell longer upon the subject, and it is one from which\r\nI willingly turn to other matters.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the licentious, the vagabond propensities of this class\r\nare very striking. As soon as the warm weather commences, boys and\r\ngirls, but more especially boys, leave the town in shoals, traversing\r\nthe country in every direction; some furnished with trifling articles\r\n(such as I have already enumerated) to sell, and others to begging,\r\nlurking, or thieving. It is not the street-sellers who so much resort\r\nto the tramp, as those who are devoid of the commonest notions of\r\nhonesty; a quality these young vagrants sometimes respect when in fear\r\nof a gaol, and the hard work with which such a place is identified in\r\ntheir minds--and to which, with the peculiar idiosyncrasy of a roving\r\nrace, they have an insuperable objection.\r\n\r\nI have met with boys and girls, however, to whom a gaol had no terrors,\r\nand to whom, when in prison, there was only one dread, and that a\r\ncommon one among the ignorant, whether with or without any sense of\r\nreligion--superstition. “I lay in prison of a night, sir,” said a\r\nboy who was generally among the briskest of his class, “and think I\r\nshall see things.” The “things” represent the vague fears which many,\r\nnot naturally stupid, but untaught or ill-taught persons, entertain\r\nin the dark. A girl, a perfect termagant in the breaking of windows\r\nand such like offences, told me something of the same kind. She spoke\r\nwell of the treatment she experienced in prison, and seemed to have a\r\nliking for the matron and officials; her conduct there was quiet and\r\nrespectful. I believe she was not addicted to drink.\r\n\r\nMany of the girls, as well as the boys, of course trade as they\r\n“tramp.” They often sell, both in the country and in town, little\r\nnecklaces, composed of red berries strung together upon thick thread,\r\nfor dolls and children: but although I have asked several of them,\r\nI have never yet found one who collected the berries and made the\r\nnecklaces themselves; neither have I met with a single instance in\r\nwhich the girl vendors knew the name of the berries thus used, nor\r\nindeed even that they _were_ berries. The invariable reply to my\r\nquestions upon this point has been that they “are called necklaces;”\r\nthat “they are just as they sells ’em to us;” that they “don’t know\r\nwhether they are made or whether they grow;” and in most cases, that\r\nthey “gets them in London, by Shoreditch;” although in one case a\r\nlittle brown-complexioned girl, with bright sparkling eyes, said that\r\n“she got them from the gipsies.” At first I fancied, from this child’s\r\nappearance, that she was rather superior in intellect to most of her\r\nclass; but I soon found that she was not a whit above the others,\r\nunless, indeed, it were in the possession of the quality of cunning.\r\n\r\nSome of the boys, on their country excursions, trade in dominoes.\r\nThey carry a variety of boxes, each differing in size and varying\r\naccordingly in price: the lowest-priced boxes are mostly 6_d._ each\r\n(sometimes 4_d._, or even 3_d._), the highest 1_s._ An informant told\r\nme that these boxes are charged to him at the rate of 20 to 25 per\r\ncent. less; but if, as is commonly the case, he could take a number\r\nat a time, he would have them at a smaller price still. They are very\r\nrudely made, and soon fall to pieces, unless handled with extreme care.\r\nMost of the boys who vend this article play at the game themselves, and\r\nwith some skill; but in every case, I believe, there is a willingness\r\nto cheat, or take advantage, which is hardly disguised; one boy told me\r\ncandidly that those who make the most money are considered to be the\r\ncleverest, whether by selling or cheating, or both, at the game; nor\r\ncan it be said that this estimation of cleverness is peculiar to these\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year great numbers of the street-children attend\r\nthe races in different parts of the country, more especially at those\r\nin the vicinity of a large town. The race-course of Wolverhampton,\r\nfor instance, is usually thronged with them during the period of the\r\nsport. While taking these perigrinations they sometimes sleep in the\r\nlow lodging-houses with which most of our provincial towns abound:\r\nfrequently “skipper it” in the open air, when the weather is fine and\r\nwarm, and occasionally in barns or outhouses attached to farms and\r\ncottages. Sometimes they travel in couples--a boy and a girl, or two\r\nboys or two girls; but the latter is not so common a case as either of\r\nthe former. It is rare that more than two may be met in company with\r\neach other, except, indeed, of a night, and then they usually herd\r\ntogether in numbers. The boys who carry dominoes sometimes, also, have\r\na sheet of paper for sale, on which is rudely printed a representation\r\nof a draught-board and men--the latter of which are of two colours\r\n(black and white) and may be cut out with a pair of scissors; thus\r\nforming a ready means of playing a game so popular in rustic places.\r\nThese sheets of paper are sold (if no more can be got for them) at a\r\npenny each. The boy who showed them to me said he gave a halfpenny a\r\npiece for them, or 6_d._ for fifteen. He said he always bought them in\r\nLondon, and that he did not know any other place to get them at, nor\r\nhad “ever heard any talk of their being bought nowhere else.”\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary lasciviousness of this class which I have already\r\nmentioned, appears to continue to mark their character during their\r\nvagabondizing career in the country as fully as in town; indeed, an\r\ninformant, upon whom I think I may rely, says, that the nightly scenes\r\nof youthful or even childish profligacy in the low lodging-houses\r\nof the small provincial towns quite equal--even if they do not\r\nexceed--those which may be witnessed in the metropolis itself. Towards\r\nthe approach of winter these children (like the vagrants of an older\r\ngrowth) advance towards London; some remain in the larger towns, such\r\nas Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, &c., but the greater\r\nproportion appear to return to the metropolis, where they resume the\r\nlife they had previously led, anything but improved in education,\r\nmorals, manners, or social position generally, by their summer’s\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nThe language spoken by this rambling class is peculiar in its\r\nconstruction: it consists of an odd medley of cockneyfied English, rude\r\nprovincialisms, and a large proportion of the slang commonly used by\r\ngipsies and other “travellers,” in conveying their ideas to those whom\r\nthey wish to purchase their commodities.\r\n\r\nAmong the propensities of the street-boys I do not think that\r\npugnacity, or a fondness, or even a great readiness, for fighting, is\r\na predominant element. Gambling and thieving may be rife among a class\r\nof these poor wretches; and it may not unfrequently happen that force\r\nis resorted to by one boy bigger than another to obtain the halfpence\r\nof which the smaller child is known to be possessed. Thus quarrels\r\namong them are very frequent, but they rarely lead to fighting. Even\r\nin the full swing and fury of their jealousy, it does not appear that\r\nthese boys attack the object of their suspicions, but prefer the less\r\nhazardous course of chastising the delinquent or unjustly suspected\r\ngirl. The girls in the low lodging-houses, I was told a little time\r\nsince, by a woman who used to frequent them, sometimes, not often,\r\nscratched one another until the two had bloody faces; and they tried to\r\nbite one another now and then, but they seldom fought. What was this\r\npoor woman’s notion of a fight between two girls, it may not be very\r\neasy to comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe number of children out daily in the streets of London, employed\r\nin the various occupations I have named, together with others which\r\nmay possibly have been overlooked--including those who beg without\r\noffering any article for sale--those who will work as light porters,\r\nas errand boys and the like, for chance passengers, has been variously\r\ncalculated; probably nothing like exactitude can be hoped for, much\r\nless expected, in such a speculation, for when a government census has\r\nbeen so frequently found to fail in correctness of detail, it appears\r\nhighly improbable that the number of those so uncertain in their places\r\nof resort and so migratory in their habits, can be ascertained with\r\nanything like a definite amount of certainty by a private individual.\r\nTaking the returns of accommodation afforded to these children in the\r\ncasual wards of workhouses, refuges for the destitute and homeless\r\npoor; of the mendicity and other societies of a similar description,\r\nand those of our hospitals and gaols,--and these sources of information\r\nupon this subject can alone be confidently relied upon,--and then\r\ntaking into the calculation the additional numbers, who pass the night\r\nin the variety of ways I have already enumerated, I think it will be\r\nfound that the number of boys and girls selling in the streets of this\r\ncity, and often dependent upon their own exertions for the commonest\r\nnecessaries of life, may be estimated at some thousands, but nearer\r\n10,000 than 20,000.\r\n\r\nThe consideration which I have devoted to this branch of my subject\r\nhas been considerable, but still not, in my own opinion, commensurate\r\nto the importance of its nature. Steps ought most unquestionably to be\r\ntaken to palliate the evils and miseries I have pointed out, even if a\r\npositive remedy be indeed impossible.\r\n\r\nEach year sees an increase of the numbers of street-children to a\r\nvery considerable extent, and the exact nature of their position may\r\nbe thus briefly depicted: what little _information_ they receive is\r\nobtained from the worst class--from cheats, vagabonds, and rogues;\r\nwhat little _amusement_ they indulge in, springs from sources the most\r\npoisonous--the most fatal to happiness and welfare; what little they\r\nknow of a _home_ is necessarily associated with much that is vile and\r\nbase; their very means of existence, uncertain and precarious as it is,\r\nis to a great extent identified with petty chicanery, which is quickly\r\ncommunicated by one to the other; while their physical sufferings from\r\ncold, hunger, exposure to the weather, and other causes of a similar\r\nnature, are constant, and at times extremely severe. Thus every means\r\nby which a proper intelligence may be conveyed to their minds is\r\neither closed or at the least tainted, while every duct by which a\r\nbad description of knowledge may be infused is sedulously cultivated\r\nand enlarged. Parental instruction; the comforts of a home, however\r\nhumble--the great moral truths upon which society itself rests;--the\r\ninfluence of proper example; the power of education; the effect of\r\nuseful amusement; are all denied to them, or come to them so greatly\r\nvitiated, that they rather tend to increase, than to repress, the very\r\nevils they were intended to remedy.\r\n\r\nThe costers invariably say that no persons under the age of fifteen\r\nshould be allowed by law to vend articles in the streets; the reason\r\nthey give for this is--that the children under that period of life\r\nhaving fewer wants and requiring less money to live than those who\r\nare older, will sell at a less profit than it is fair to expect the\r\narticles sold should yield, and thus they tersely conclude, “they\r\npervents others living, and ruins theirselves.”\r\n\r\nThere probably is truth in this remark, and I must confess that, for\r\nthe sake of the children themselves, I should have no objection to\r\nsee the suggestion acted upon; and yet there immediately rises the\r\nplain yet startling question--in such a case, what is to become of the\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\nI now cite the histories of street-lads belonging to the several\r\nclasses above specified, as illustrations of the truth of the\r\nstatements advanced concerning the children street-sellers generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF CHILDREN SENT OUT AS STREET-SELLERS BY THEIR PARENTS.\r\n\r\nOf the boys and girls who are sent out to sell in the streets by\r\nparents who are themselves street-traders, I need say but little under\r\nthis head. I have spoken of them, and given some of their statements\r\nin other divisions of this work (see the accounts of the coster boys\r\nand girls). When, as is the case with many of the costermongers, and\r\nwith the Irish fruit-sellers, the parents and children follow the\r\nsame calling, they form one household, and work, as it were, “into\r\none another’s hands.” The father can buy a larger, and consequently a\r\ncheaper quantity, when he can avail himself of a subdivision of labour\r\nas inexpensive as that of his own family--whom he must maintain whether\r\nemployed or unemployed--in order to vend such extra quantity. I have\r\nalready noticed that in some families (as is common with rude tribes)\r\ncostermongering seems an hereditary pursuit, and the frequent and\r\nconstant employment of children in street traffic is one reason why\r\nthis hereditary pursuit is perpetuated, for street commerce is thus at\r\na very early age made part and parcel of the young coster’s existence,\r\nand he very probably acquires a distaste for any other occupation,\r\nwhich may entail more of _restraint_ and _irksomeness_. It is very\r\nrarely that a costermonger apprentices his son to any handicraft\r\nbusiness, although a daughter may sometimes be placed in domestic\r\nservice. The child is usually “sent out to sell.”\r\n\r\nThere is another class of children who are “sent out” as are the\r\nchildren of the costers, and sometimes with the same cheap and readily\r\nattained articles--oranges and lemons, nuts, chestnuts, onions,\r\nsalt (or fresh) herrings, winks, or shrimps, and, more rarely, with\r\nwater-cresses or cut-flowers. Sometimes the young vendors offer small\r\nwares--leather boot-laces, coat-studs, steel pens, or such like. These\r\nare often the children, not of street sales-people, but of persons in\r\na measure connected with a street life, or some open-air pursuit; the\r\nchildren of cabmen deprived of their licences, or of the hangers-on\r\nof cabmen; of the “supers” (supernumeraries) of the theatres who have\r\nirregular or no employment, or, as they would call it, “engagement,”\r\nwith the unhappy consequence of irregular or no “salary:” the children,\r\nagain, of street performers, or Ethiopians, or street-musicians, are\r\n“sent out to sell,” as well as those of the poorer class of labourers\r\nconnected with the river--ballast-heavers, lumpers, &c.; of (Irish)\r\nbricklayers’ labourers and paviours’ assistants; of market-porters and\r\ndock-labourers; of coal-heavers out of work, and of the helpers at\r\ncoal-wharfs, and at the other wharfs; of the Billingsgate “roughs;” and\r\nof the many classes of the labouring, rather than the artisan poor,\r\nwhose earnings are uncertain, or insufficient, or have failed them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nWith such classes as these (and more especially with the Irish),\r\nas soon as Pat or Biddy is big enough to carry a basket, and is of\r\nsufficiently ripened intellect to understand the relative value of\r\ncoins, from a farthing to a shilling, he or she _must_ do something\r\n“to help,” and that something is generally to sell in the streets.\r\nOne poor woman who made a scanty living in working on corn sacks and\r\nbags--her infirmities sometimes preventing her working at all--sent\r\nout three children, together or separately, to sell lucifer-matches\r\nor small wares. “_They like it_,” she said, “_and always want to be\r\noff into the streets_; and when my husband (a labourer) was ill in the\r\nhospital, the few pence they brought in was very useful; but now he’s\r\nwell and at work again and we want to send the eldest--she’s nine--to\r\nschool; _but they all_ will _go out to sell if they can get hold of\r\nany stock_. I would never have sent them at all if I could have helped\r\nit, but if they made 6_d._ a day among the three of them, perhaps it\r\nsaved their lives when things were at the worst.” If a poor woman, as\r\nin this instance, has not been used to street-selling herself, there is\r\nalways some neighbour to advise her what to purchase for her children’s\r\nhawking, and instruct her where.\r\n\r\nFrom one little girl I had the following account. She was then selling\r\nboot-laces and offered them most perseveringly. She was turned nine,\r\nshe said, and had sold things in the streets for two years past, but\r\nnot regularly. The father got his living in the streets by “playing;”\r\nshe seemed reluctant to talk about his avocation, but I found that he\r\nwas sometimes a street-musician, or street-performer, and sometimes\r\nsung or recited in public houses, and having “seen better days,” had it\r\nappears communicated some feeling of dislike for his present pursuits\r\nto his daughter, so that I discontinued any allusion to the subject.\r\nThe mother earned 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ weekly, in shoe-binding, when\r\nshe had employment, which was three weeks out of four, and a son of\r\nthirteen earned what was sufficient to maintain him as an (occasional)\r\nassistant in a wholesale pottery, or rather pot-shop.\r\n\r\n“It’s in the winter, sir, when things are far worst with us. Father can\r\nmake very little then--but I don’t know what he earns exactly at any\r\ntime--and though mother has more work then, there’s fire and candle to\r\npay for. We were very badly off last winter, and worse, I think, the\r\nwinter before. Father sometimes came home and had made nothing, and if\r\nmother had no work in hand we went to bed to save fire and candle, if\r\nit was ever so soon. Father would die afore he would let mother take as\r\nmuch as a loaf from the parish. I was sent out to sell nuts first: ‘If\r\nit’s only 1_d._ you make,’ mother said, ‘it’s a good piece of bread.’\r\nI didn’t mind being sent out. I knew children that sold things in the\r\nstreets. Perhaps I liked it better than staying at home without a fire\r\nand with nothing to do, and if I went out I saw other children busy.\r\nNo, I wasn’t a bit frightened when I first started, not a bit. Some\r\nchildren--but they was such little things--said: ‘O, Liz, I wish I was\r\nyou.’ I had twelve ha’porths and sold them all. I don’t know what it\r\nmade; 2_d._ most likely. I didn’t crack a single nut myself. I was fond\r\nof them then, but I don’t care for them now. I could do better if I\r\nwent into public-houses, but I’m only let go to Mr. Smith’s, because\r\nhe knows father, and Mrs. Smith and him recommends me and wouldn’t let\r\nanybody mislest me. Nobody ever offered to. I hear people swear there\r\nsometimes, but it’s not at me. I sell nuts to children in the streets,\r\nand laces to young women. I have sold nuts and oranges to soldiers.\r\nThey never say anything rude to me, never. I was once in a great crowd,\r\nand was getting crushed, and there was a very tall soldier close by me,\r\nand he lifted me, basket and all, right up to his shoulder, and carried\r\nme clean out of the crowd. He had stripes on his arm. ‘I shouldn’t like\r\nyou to be in such a trade,’ says he, ‘if you was my child.’ He didn’t\r\nsay why he wouldn’t like it. Perhaps because it was beginning to rain.\r\nYes, we are far better off now. Father makes money. I don’t go out in\r\nbad weather in the summer; in the winter, though, I must. I don’t know\r\nwhat I make. I don’t know what I shall be when I grow up. I can read a\r\nlittle. I’ve been to church five or six times in my life. I should go\r\noftener and so would mother, if we had clothes.”\r\n\r\nI have no reason to suppose that in this case the father was an\r\nintemperate man, though some of the parents who thus send their\r\nchildren out _are_ intemperate, and, loving to indulge in the idleness\r\nto which intemperance inclines them, are forced to live on the labour\r\nof their wives and children.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A “NEGLECTED” CHILD, A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nOf this class perhaps there is less to be said than of others. Drunken\r\nparents allow their children to run about the streets, and often\r\nto shift for themselves. If such parents have any sense of shame,\r\nunextinguished by their continued besottedness, they may feel relieved\r\nby not having their children before their eyes, for the very sight of\r\nthem is a reproach, and every rag about such helpless beings must carry\r\nits accusation to a mind not utterly callous.\r\n\r\nAmong such children there is not, perhaps, that extreme pressure of\r\nwretchedness or of privation that there is among the orphans, or the\r\nutterly deserted. If a “neglected child” have to shift, wholly or\r\npartly, for itself, it is perhaps with the advantage of a shelter; for\r\neven the bare room of the drunkard is in some degree a shelter or roof.\r\nThere is not the nightly need of 2_d._ for a bed, or the alternative of\r\nthe Adelphi arches for nothing.\r\n\r\nI met with one little girl ten or eleven years of age, whom some of the\r\nstreet-sellers described to me as looking out for a job every now and\r\nthen. She was small-featured and dark-eyed, and seemed intelligent.\r\nHer face and hands were brown as if from exposure to the weather, and\r\na lack of soap; but her dress was not dirty. Her father she described\r\nas a builder, probably a bricklayer’s labourer, but he could work, she\r\nsaid, at drains or such like. “Mother’s been dead a long time,” the\r\nchild continued, “and father brought another woman home and told me to\r\ncall her mother, but she soon went away. I works about the streets, but\r\nonly when there’s nothing to eat at home. Father gets drunk sometimes,\r\nbut I think not so oft as he did, and then he lies in bed. No, sir, not\r\nall day, but he gets up and goes out and gets more drink, and comes\r\nback and goes to bed again. He never uses me badly. When he’s drinking\r\nand has money, he gives me some now and then to get bread and butter\r\nwith, or a halfpenny pudding; he never eats anything in the house when\r\nhe’s drinking, and he’s a very quiet man. Sometimes he’s laid in bed\r\ntwo or three days and nights at a time. I goes to school when father\r\nhas money. We lives very well then. I’ve kept myself for a whole week.\r\nI mind people’s stalls, if they’re away a bit, and run for them if\r\nthey’re wanted; and I go errands. I’ve carried home flower-pots for\r\na lady. I’ve got a halfpenny on a day, and a penny, and some bread\r\nperhaps, and I’ve lived on that. I should like very well to have a\r\npitch of my own. _I think I should like that better than place._ But I\r\nhave a sister who has a place in the country; she’s far older than I\r\nam, and perhaps I shall get one. But father’s at work now, and he says\r\nhe’ll take the pledge. Five or six times I’ve sold oranges, and ingans\r\nas well, and carried the money to Mrs. ----, who gave me all I took\r\nabove 4_d._ for myself.”\r\n\r\nIt could surprise no one if a child so neglected became so habituated\r\nto a street life, that she could not adapt herself to any other. I\r\nheard of other children thus or similarly neglected, but boys far more\r\nfrequently than girls, who traded regularly in apples, oranges, &c., on\r\ntheir own account. Some have become regular street-sellers, and even in\r\nchildhood have abandoned their homes and supported themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A HIRED COSTER BOY.\r\n\r\nOne shell-fish seller, who has known street-commerce and street-folk\r\nfor many years, thought, although he only hazarded an opinion, that\r\nthere was less drinking among the young costers, and less swearing,\r\nthan he had known in a preceding generation.\r\n\r\nA young coster boy living with his parents, who had a good business,\r\ntold me that he would never be nothing but a “general dealer,”\r\n(which among some of these people is the “genteel” designation for a\r\ncostermonger,) as long as he lived, unless, indeed, he rose to a coal\r\nshed and a horse and cart; a consummation, perhaps with the addition of\r\na green-grocery, a fried fish, and a gingerbeer trade, not unfrequently\r\narrived at by the more prudent costermongers. This boy could neither\r\nread nor write; he had been sent to school, and flogged to school (he\r\ngrinned as he told me) by his mother, who said his father wouldn’t have\r\nbeen “done” so often by fine folks, when he sold “grass” (asparagus)\r\nand such things as cost money, if he could have kept ’count. But his\r\nfather only laughed, and said nothing, when the boy “cut away” from\r\nschool, which he did so continuously, that the schoolmaster at length\r\ndeclined the charge of the young coster’s further education. This\r\nstripling, who was about fourteen, seemed very proud of a pair of\r\ngood half-boots which his mother had bought him, and which he admired\r\ncontinually as he glanced at his feet. His parents, from his account,\r\nwere indulgent, and when they got farthings in change or in any manner,\r\nkept them for him; and so he got treats, and smart things to wear now\r\nand then. “We expects to do well,” he said, for he used the “we” when\r\nhe spoke of his parents’ business, “when it’s peas and new potatoes,\r\ncheap enough to cry. It’s my dodge to cry. I know a man as says, ‘May\r\nmonth ought to be ashamed on itself, or things ’ud a been herlier.’\r\nLast week I sung out, it was the same man’s dodge, he put me up to\r\nit--‘Here’s your Great Exhibition mackarel.’ People laughed, but it\r\nweren’t no great good. I’ve been to Penny Gaffs, but not this goodish\r\nbit. I likes the singing best as has a stunnin chorus. There’s been a\r\ndeal of hard up lately among people as is general dealers. Things is\r\ngetting better, I think, and they must. It wouldn’t do at all if they\r\ndidn’t. It’s no use your a-asking me about what I thinks of the Queen\r\nor them sort of people, for I knows nothing about them, and never goes\r\namong them.”\r\n\r\nThe Hired boys, for the service of the costermongers, whether hired\r\nfor the day, or more permanently, are very generally of the classes I\r\nhave spoken of. When the New Cut, Lambeth, was a great street-market,\r\nevery morning, during the height of the vegetable and fruit seasons,\r\nlads used to assemble in Hooper-street, Short-street, York-street, and,\r\nindeed, in all the smaller streets or courts, which run right and left\r\nfrom the “two Cuts.” When the costermonger started thence, perhaps “by\r\nthe first light,” to market, these boys used to run up to his barrow,\r\n“D’you want me, Jack?” or, “Want a boy, Bill?” being their constant\r\nrequest. It is now the same, in the localities where the costermongers\r\nlive, or where they keep their ponies, donkeys, and barrows, and whence\r\nthey emerge to market. It is the same at Billingsgate and the other\r\nmarkets at which these traders make their wholesale purchases. Boys\r\nwait about these marts “to be hired,” or, as they may style it, to “see\r\nif they’re wanted.” When hired, there is seldom any “wage” specified,\r\nthe lads seeming always willing to depend upon the liberality of the\r\ncostermonger, and often no doubt with an eye to the chances of “bunse.”\r\nA sharp lad thus engaged, who may acquit himself to a costermonger’s\r\nliking, perhaps continues some time in the same man’s employ. I may\r\nobserve, that in this gathering, and for such a purpose, there is a\r\nresemblance to the simple proceedings of the old times, when around the\r\nmarket cross of the nearest town assembled the population who sought\r\nemployment, whether in agricultural or household labour. In some parts\r\nof the north of England these gatherings are still held at the two\r\nhalf-yearly terms of May-day and Martinmas.\r\n\r\nA lad of thirteen or fourteen, who did not look very strong, gave me\r\nthe following account: “I helps, you see, sir, where I can, for mother\r\n(who sells sheep’s-trotters) depends a deal on her trotters, but\r\nthey’re not great bread for an old ’oman, and there’s me and Neddy to\r\nkeep. Father’s abroad and a soger. Do I know he is? Mother says so,\r\nsir. I looks out every morning when the costermongers starts for the\r\nmarkets and wants boys for their barrows. I cried roots last: ‘Here’s\r\nyour musks, ha’penny each. Here’s yer all agro’in’ and all a blo’in’.’\r\nI got my grub and 3_d._ I takes the tin home. If there’s a cabbage or\r\ntwo left, I’ve had it guv to me. _I likes that work better nor school.\r\nI should think so. One sees life._ Well, I don’t know wot one sees\r\nperticler; but it’s wot people calls life. I was a week at school once.\r\nI has a toss up sometimes when I has a odd copper for it. I ’aven’t\r\n’ad any rig’lar work as yet. I shall p’raps when it’s real summer.”\r\n[Said, May 24th.] “This is the Queen’s birthday, is it, sir? Werry\r\nlikely, but she’s nothing to me. I can’t read, in coorse not, after\r\na week’s schooling. Yes, I likes a show. Punch is stunnin’, but they\r\nmight make more on the dog. I would if I was a Punch. O, I has tea, and\r\nbread and butter with mother, and gets grub as I jobs besides. I makes\r\nno bargain. If a cove’s scaly, we gets to know him. I hopes to have\r\na barrer of my own some day, and p’raps a hass. Can I manage a hass?\r\n_In_ coorse, and he don’t want no groomin’. I’d go to Hepsom then; I’ve\r\nnever been yet, but I’ve been to Grinnage fairs. I don’t know how I can\r\nget a barrer and a hass, but I may have luck.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF AN ORPHAN BOY, A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nFrom one of this class I had the following account. It may be observed\r\nthat the lad’s statement contains little of incident, or of novelty,\r\nbut this is characteristic of many of his class. With many of them,\r\nit may indeed be said, “one day certifieth another.” It is often the\r\nsame tale of labour and of poverty, day after day, so that the mere\r\nuniformity makes a youth half oblivious of the past; the months, or\r\nperhaps years, seem all alike.\r\n\r\nThis boy seemed healthy, wore a suit of corduroy, evidently not made\r\nfor him, and but little patched, although old; he was in good spirits.\r\n\r\n“I believe I’m between fifteen and sixteen,” he said, “and mother died\r\nmore than two year ago, nearer three, perhaps. Father had gone dead a\r\nlong time afore; I don’t remember him.” [I am inclined to think that\r\nthis story of the death of the father is often told by the mother of\r\nan illegitimate child to her offspring, through a natural repugnance\r\nto reveal her shame to her child. I do not know, however, that it was\r\nthe case in this instance.] “I don’t remember about mother’s funeral,\r\nfor I was ill myself at the time. She worked with her needle; sometimes\r\nfor a dressmaker, on “skirts,” and sometimes for a tailor, on flannels.\r\nShe sometimes worked all night, but we was wery badly off--we was so.\r\nShe had only me. When mother died there was nothing left for me, but\r\nthere was a good woman--she was a laundress and kept a mangle--and she\r\nsaid, ‘well, here’s a old basket and a few odd things; give the kid the\r\nbasket and turn the bits of old traps into money, and let him start on\r\nmuffins, and then he must shift for hisself.’ So she tuk me to a shop\r\nand I was started in the muffin line. I didn’t do so bad, but it’s on’y\r\na winter trade, isn’t muffins. I sold creases next--no, not creases,\r\ncherries; yes, it was creases, and then cherries, for I remembers as\r\n’ow ’Ungerford was the first market I ever was at; it was so. Since\r\nthen, I’ve sold apples, and oranges, and nuts, and chestnuts--but\r\n_they_ was dear the last time as I had ’em--and spring garters a penny\r\na pair, and glass pens; yes, and other things. I goes to market, mostly\r\nto Common Gard’n, and there’s a man goes there what buys bushels and\r\nbushels, and he’ll let me have any little lot reas’nable; he will\r\nso. There’s another will, but he ain’t so good to a poor kid. Well,\r\nI doesn’t know as ’ow one trade’s better nor another; I think I’ve\r\ndone as much in one as in another. But I’ve done better lately; I’ve\r\nsold more oranges, and I had a few sticks of rhubarb. I think times is\r\nmending, but others says that’s on’y my luck. I sleeps with a boy as is\r\nyounger nor I am, and pays 9_d._ a week. Tom’s father and mother--he’s\r\na coal-heaver, but he’s sometimes out of work--sleeps in the same\r\nroom, but we has a good bed to ourselves. Tom’s father knew my mother.\r\nThere’s on’y us four. Tom’s father says sometimes if his rheumatics\r\ncontinues, he and all on ’em must go into the house. Most likely I\r\nshould then go to a lodging-house. I don’t know that some on ’em’s bad\r\nplaces. I’ve heer’d they was jolly. I has no amusements. Last year I\r\nhelped a man one day, and he did so well on fruit, he did so, for he\r\ngot such a early start, and so cheap, that he gave me 3_d._ hextra to\r\ngo to the play with. I didn’t go. I’d rather go to bed at seven every\r\nnight than anywhere else. I’m fond of sleep. I never wakes all night.\r\nI dreams now and then, but I never remembers a dream. I can’t read or\r\nwrite; I wish I could, if it would help me on. I’m making 3_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nweek now, I think. Some weeks in winter I didn’t make 2_s._”\r\n\r\nThis boy, although an orphan at a tender age, was yet assisted to the\r\ncommencement of a business by a friend. I met with another lad who\r\nwas left under somewhat similar circumstances. The persons in the\r\nhouse where his mother had died were about to take him to the parish\r\nofficers, and there seemed to be no other course to be pursued to save\r\nthe child, then nearly twelve, from starvation. The lad knew this and\r\nran away. It was summer time, about three years ago, and the little\r\nrunaway slept in the open air whenever he could find a quiet place.\r\nWant drove him to beg, and several days he subsisted on one penny\r\nwhich he begged. One day he did not find any one to give him even a\r\nhalfpenny, and towards the evening of the second he became bold, or\r\neven desperate, from hunger. As if by a sudden impulse he went up to\r\nan old gentleman, walking slowly in Hyde-park, and said to him, “Sir,\r\nI’ve lived three weeks by begging, and I’m hungering now; give me\r\nsixpence, or I’ll go and steal.” The gentleman stopped and looked at\r\nthe boy, in whose tones there must have been truthfulness, and in whose\r\nface was no doubt starvation, for without uttering a word he gave the\r\nyoung applicant a shilling. The boy began a street-seller’s life on\r\nlucifer-matches. I had to see him for another purpose a little while\r\nago, and in the course of some conversation he told me of his start\r\nin the streets. I have no doubt he told the truth, and I should have\r\ngiven a more detailed account of him, but when I inquired for him,\r\nI found that he had gone to Epsom races to sell cards, and had not\r\nreturned, having probably left London on a country tour. But for the\r\nold gentleman’s bounty he would have stolen something, he declared, had\r\nit been only for the shelter of a prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LIFE OF AN ORPHAN GIRL, A STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\n“Father was a whitesmith,” she said, “and mother used to go out\r\na-washing and a-cleaning, and me and my sister (but she is dead now)\r\ndid nothing; we was sent to a day school, both of us. We lived very\r\ncomfortable; we had two rooms and our own furniture; we didn’t want for\r\nnothing when father was alive; he was very fond on us both, and was a\r\nkind man to everybody. He was took bad first when I was very young--it\r\nwas consumption he had, and he was ill many years, about five years,\r\nI think it was, afore he died. When he was gone mother kept us both;\r\nshe had plenty of work; she couldn’t a-bear the thought of our going\r\ninto the streets for a living, and we was both too young to get a place\r\nanywhere, so we stayed at home and went to school just as when father\r\nwas alive. My sister died about two year and a half ago; she had the\r\nscarlet-fever dreadful, she lay ill seven weeks. We was both very fond\r\nof her, me and mother. I often wish she had been spared, I should not\r\nbe alone in the world as I am now. We might have gone on together, but\r\nit is dreadful to be quite alone, and I often think now how well we\r\ncould have done if she was alive.\r\n\r\n“Mother has been dead just a year this month; she took cold at the\r\nwashing and it went to her chest; she was only bad a fortnight; she\r\nsuffered great pain, and, poor thing, she used to fret dreadful, as she\r\nlay ill, about me, for she knew she was going to leave me. She used to\r\nplan how I was to do when she was gone. She made me promise to try to\r\nget a place and keep from the streets if I could, for she seemed to\r\ndread them so much. When she was gone I was left in the world without\r\na friend. I am quite alone, I have no relation at all, not a soul\r\nbelonging to me. For three months I went about looking for a place,\r\nas long as my money lasted, for mother told me to sell our furniture\r\nto keep me and get me clothes. I could have got a place, but nobody\r\nwould have me without a character, and I knew nobody to give me one. I\r\ntried very hard to get one, indeed I did; for I thought of all mother\r\nhad said to me about going into the streets. At last, when my money\r\nwas just gone, I met a young woman in the street, and I asked her to\r\ntell me where I could get a lodging. She told me to come with her, she\r\nwould show me a respectable lodging-house for women and girls. I went,\r\nand I have been there ever since. The women in the house advised me to\r\ntake to flower-selling, as I could get nothing else to do. One of the\r\nyoung women took me to market with her, and showed me how to bargain\r\nwith the salesman for my flowers. At first, when I went out to sell, I\r\nfelt so ashamed I could not ask anybody to buy of me; and many times\r\nwent back at night with all my stock, without selling one bunch. The\r\nwoman at the lodging-house is very good to me; and when I have a bad\r\nday she will let my lodging go until I can pay her. She always gives\r\nme my dinner, and a good dinner it is, of a Sunday; and she will often\r\ngive me a breakfast, when she knows I have no money to buy any. She is\r\nvery kind, indeed, for she knows I am alone. I feel very thankful to\r\nher, I am sure, for all her goodness to me. During the summer months\r\nI take 1_s._ 6_d._ per day, which is 6_d._ profit. But I can only\r\nsell my flowers five days in the week--Mondays there is no flowers in\r\nthe market: and of the 6_d._ a day I pay 3_d._ for lodging. I get a\r\nhalfpenny-worth of tea; a halfpenny-worth of sugar; one pound of bread,\r\n1-1/2_d._; butter, 1/2_d._ I never tastes meat but on Sunday. What I\r\nshall do in the winter I don’t know. In the cold weather last year,\r\nwhen I could get no flowers, I was forced to live on my clothes, I have\r\nnone left now but what I have on. What I shall do I don’t know--I can’t\r\nbear to think on it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF TWO RUNAWAY STREET-BOYS.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to find a boy or girl who belonged to the _well_-educated\r\nclasses, had run away, and was now a street-seller. I heard of boys of\r\nthis class--one man thought he knew five, and was sure of four--who\r\nnow lived by street-selling, my informant believed without having\r\nany recourse to theft, but all these boys were absent; they had not\r\nreturned from Epsom, or had not returned to their usual haunts, or else\r\nthey had started for their summer’s excursion into the country. Many\r\na street-seller becomes as weary of town after the winter as a member\r\nof parliament who sits out a very long session; and the moment the\r\nweather is warm, and “seems settled,” they are off into the country. In\r\nthis change of scene there is the feeling of independence, of freedom;\r\n_they_ are not “tied to their work;” and this feeling has perhaps even\r\ngreater charms for the child than the adult.\r\n\r\nThe number of lads of a _well-educated class_, who support themselves\r\nby street-selling, is not large. I speak of those whom I have classed\r\nas children under fifteen years of age. If a boy run away, scared and\r\nterrified by the violence of a parent, or maddened by continuous and\r\nsometimes excessive severity, the parent often feels compunction, and I\r\nheard of persons being sent to every lodging-house in London, and told\r\nto search every dry arch, to bring back a runaway. On these occasions\r\nthe street-sellers willingly give their aid; I have even heard of\r\nwomen, whose degradation was of the lowest, exerting themselves in the\r\nrecovery of a runaway child, and that often unsolicited and as often\r\nunrecompensed.\r\n\r\nThe children who are truants through their own vicious or reckless\r\npropensities, or through the inducements of their seniors, become far\r\nmore frequently, thieves or lurkers, rather than street-sellers. As to\r\nrunaway girls of a well-educated class, and under fifteen, I heard of\r\nnone who were street-sellers.\r\n\r\nI now give instances of two runaway lads, who have been dishonest, and\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\nThe one, when he told me his history, was a slim and rather tall\r\nyoung man of 23 or 24, with a look, speech, and air, anything but\r\nvulgar. He was the son of a wealthy jeweller, in a town in the West\r\nof England, and ran away from home with an adult member of his\r\nfather’s establishment, who first suggested such a course, taking with\r\nthem money and valuables. They came to London, and the elder thief,\r\nretaining all the stolen property, at once abandoned the child, then\r\nonly ten, and little and young-looking for his age. He fell into\r\nthe hands of some members of the swell-mob, and became extremely\r\nserviceable to them. He was dressed like a gentleman’s son, and was\r\ninnocent-looking and handsome. His appearance, when I saw him, showed\r\nthat this must have been the case as regards his looks. He lived with\r\nsome of the swell-mobsmen--then a more prosperous people than they\r\nare now--in a good house in the Southwark-Bridge-road. The women who\r\nresided with the mobsmen were especially kind to him. He was well fed,\r\nwell lodged, well clad, and petted in everything. He was called “the\r\nkid,” a common slang name for a child, but he was _the_ kid. He “went\r\nto work” in Regent-street, or wherever there were most ladies, and his\r\nappearance disarmed suspicion. He was, moreover, highly successful in\r\nchurch and chapel practice. At length he became “spotted.” The police\r\ngot to know him, and he was apprehended, tried, and convicted. He was,\r\nhowever--he believed through the interest of his friends, of whose\r\ninquiries concerning him he had heard, but of that I know nothing--sent\r\nto the Philanthropic Asylum, then in St. George’s-road. Here he\r\nremained the usual time, then left the place well clothed, and with a\r\nsum of money, and endeavoured to obtain some permanent employment. In\r\nthis endeavour he failed. Whether he exerted himself strenuously or not\r\nI cannot say, but he told me that the very circumstance of his having\r\nbeen “in the Philanthropic” was fatal to his success. His “character”\r\nand “recommendations” necessarily showed where he had come from, and\r\nthe young man, as he then was, became a beggar. His chief practice was\r\nin “screeving,” or writing on the pavement. Perhaps some of my readers\r\nmay remember having noticed a wretched-looking youth who hung over the\r\nwords “I AM STARVING,” chalked on the footway on the Surrey side of\r\nWaterloo Bridge. He lay huddled in a heap, and appeared half dead with\r\ncold and want, his shirtless neck and shoulders being visible through\r\nthe rents in his thin jean jacket; shoe or stocking he did not wear.\r\nThis was the rich jeweller’s son. Until he himself told me of it--and\r\nhe seemed to do so with some sense of shame--I could not have believed\r\nthat the well-spoken and well-looking youth before me was the piteous\r\nobject I had observed by the bridge. What he is doing now I am unable\r\nto state.\r\n\r\nAnother boy, who thought he was not yet fifteen, though he looked\r\nolder, gave me the following account. He was short but seemed strong,\r\nand his career, so far, is chiefly remarkable for his perseverance,\r\nexercised as much, perhaps, from insensibility as from any other\r\nquality. He was sufficiently stupid. If he had parents living, he\r\nsaid, he didn’t know nothing about them; he had lived and slept with\r\nan old woman who said she was his grandmother, and he’d been told that\r\nshe weren’t no relation; he didn’t trouble himself about it. She sold\r\nlucifer-boxes or any trifle in the streets, and had an allowance of\r\n2_s._ weekly, but from what quarter he did not know. About four years\r\nago he was run over by a cab, and was carried to the workhouse or the\r\nhospital; he believed it was Clerkenwell Workhouse, but he weren’t\r\nsure. When he recovered and was discharged he found the old woman was\r\ndead, and a neighbour went with him to the parish officers, by whom--as\r\nwell as I could understand him--he was sent to the workhouse, after\r\nsome inquiry. He was soon removed to Nor’ud. On my asking if he meant\r\nNorwood, he replied, “no, Nor’ud,” and there he was with a number of\r\nother children with a Mr. Horbyn. He did not know how long he was\r\nthere, and he didn’t know as he had anything much to complain of, but\r\nhe ran away. He ran away because he thought he would; and he believed\r\nhe could get work at paper-staining. He made his way to Smithfield,\r\nnear where there was a great paper-stainer’s, but he could not get any\r\nwork, and he was threatened to be sent back, as they knew from his\r\ndress that he had run away. He slept in Smithfield courts and alleys,\r\nfitting himself into any covered corner he could find. The poor women\r\nabout were kind to him, and gave him pieces of bread; some knew that he\r\nhad run away from a workhouse and was all the kinder. “The fust browns\r\nas ivver I yarned,” he said, “was from a drover. He was a going into\r\nthe country to meet some beasts, and had to carry some passels for\r\nsomebody down there. They wasn’t ’evvy, but they was orkerd to grip.\r\nHis old ’oman luk out for a young cove to ’elp her old man, and saw\r\nme fust, so she calls me, and I gets the job. I gived the greatest of\r\nsatisfaction, and had sixpence giv me, for Jim (the drover) was well\r\npaid, as they was vallyble passels, and he said he’d taken the greatest\r\nof care on ’em, and had engaged a poor lad to ’elp him.” On his return\r\nthe child slept in a bed, in a house near Gray’s-inn-lane, for the\r\nfirst time since he had run away, he believed about a fortnight. He\r\npersevered in looking out for odd jobs, without ever stealing, though\r\nhe met some boys who told him he was a fool not to prig. “I used to\r\ncarry his tea from his old ’oman,” he went on, “to a old cove as had\r\na stunnin’ pitch of fruit in the City-road. But my best friend was\r\nStumpy; he had a beautiful crossin’ (as a sweeper) then, but he’s dead\r\nnow and berried as well. I used to talk to him and whistle--I _can_\r\njust whistle” [here he whistled loud and shrill, to convince me of\r\nhis perfection in that street accomplishment] “--and to dance him the\r\ndouble-shuffle” [he favoured me with a specimen of that dance], “and\r\nhe said I hinterested him. Well, he meant he liked it, I s’pose. When\r\nhe went to rest hisself, for he soon got tired, over his drop of beer\r\nto his grub, I had his crossin’ and his broom for nuff’n. One boy used\r\nto say to Stumpy, ‘I’ll give you 1_d._ for your crossin’ while you’s\r\ngrubbin.’ But I had it for nuff’n, and had all I yarned; sometimes\r\n1_d._, sometimes 2_d._, but only once 3-1/2_d._ I’ve been ’elping Old\r\nBill with his summer cabbages and flowers (cauliflowers), and now he’s\r\non live heels. I can sing ’em out prime, but you ’eared me. I has my\r\nbit o’ grub with him, and a few browns, and Old Bill and Young Bill,\r\ntoo, says I shall have better to do, but I can’t until peas. I sleeps\r\nin a loft with ’ampers, which is Old Bill’s; a stunnin’ good bed. I’ve\r\ncried for and ’elped other costers. Stumpy sent me to ’em. I think he’d\r\nbeen one hisself, but I was always on the look-out. I’ll go for some\r\nbunse soon. I don’t know what I shall do time to come, I nivver thinks\r\non it. I could read middlin’, and can a little now, but I’m out of\r\npractice.”\r\n\r\nI have given this little fellow’s statement somewhat fully, for I\r\nbelieve he is a type of the most numerous class of runaway urchins who\r\nripen, so to speak, into costermongers, after “helping” that large body\r\nof street-traders.\r\n\r\nI heard of one boy who had been discharged from Brixton, and had\r\nreceived 6_d._ to begin the world with, as it was his first offence, on\r\nhis way back to London, being called upon suddenly as soon as he had\r\nreached the New Cut (then the greatest of all the street-markets) to\r\nhelp a costermonger. This gave the boy a start, and he had since lived\r\nhonestly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MANUFACTURED\r\nARTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore giving a Summary of the Capital and Income of the\r\nabove-mentioned class, I shall endeavour to arrive at some notion as\r\nto the number of persons belonging to this division of the London\r\nStreet-sellers.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am able to ascertain, the following estimate may be taken\r\nas an approximation to the truth. There are in the metropolis 100\r\nhardware-sellers, 6 cheap Johns, 30 sellers of cutlery, 6 sellers of\r\ntailors’ needles, 20 sellers of metal spoons, 500 sellers of jewellery,\r\n2 sellers of card counters, 15 sellers of medals, 6 sellers of rings\r\nand sovereigns for a wager, 25 sellers of children’s gilt watches, 100\r\nsellers of tin-ware, 100 swag-barrowmen, 12 sellers of dog-collars,\r\n&c., 40 sellers of tools, 380 sellers of crockery and glass-wares, 12\r\nsellers of spar-ornaments, 30 sellers of China-ornaments, 6 sellers\r\nof stone-fruit, 120 packmen and duffers or hawkers of soft wares,\r\n500 sellers of tapes, cottons, &c., 100 sellers of lace, 15 sellers\r\nof japanned table covers, 500 brace and belt-sellers, 50 sellers of\r\nhose, 3 sellers of waistcoats, 230 sellers of blacking, 125 sellers of\r\nblack-lead, 5 sellers of French polish, 7 sellers of grease-removing\r\ncomposition, 4 sellers of plating-balls, 8 sellers of corn-salve, 4\r\nsellers of China and glass cement, 6 sellers of razor paste, 55 sellers\r\nof crackers and detonating-balls, 200 sellers of Lucifer matches, 100\r\nsellers of cigar-lights, 30 sellers of gutta-percha heads, 50 sellers\r\nof fly-papers and beetle-wafers, 25 sellers of poison for rats, 35\r\nsellers of walking-sticks, 30 sellers of whips, 4 sellers of clay\r\nand Meerschaum pipes, 15 sellers of tobacco-boxes, snuff-boxes, and\r\ncigar-cases, 100 sellers of cigars, 50 sellers of sponge, 200 sellers\r\nof wash-leathers, 35 sellers of spectacles, and eye-glasses, 50 sellers\r\nof dolls, 50 lot-sellers, 2 sellers of Roulette tables, 4 sellers\r\nof rhubarb, 100 rat-catchers, 50 sellers of combs, 50 sellers of\r\nmoney-bags, 70 sellers of coat-studs; making altogether a total of 4272.\r\n\r\nSome few of the above trades are, however, of only a temporary\r\ncharacter; as, for instance, such as are engaged in the street-sale\r\nof crackers and detonating-balls--the month of November and the\r\nChristmas week being the only regular periods, with the exception of\r\nfairs and races, for the vending of those articles. The fly-papers\r\nand beetle-wafers are other instances of the same kind--summer\r\nbeing the only season in which there is a demand for such things.\r\nMaking due allowance therefore for the temporary character of some\r\nof the callings, as well as for the itinerancy and unsettledness of\r\nother trades or traders, we may, I think, safely assume that the\r\nstreet-sellers connected with this class are about 4000 in number.\r\n\r\nConcerning the amount of capital invested in this branch of the\r\nstreet-traffic as well as the income derived therefrom, the following\r\ntables are given as being somewhat near the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  METAL.\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Hardware._\r\n\r\n                                                        £    _s._  _d._\r\n  Stock-money for 100 vendors at 10_s._\r\n  each                                                 50      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Cheap Johns._\r\n\r\n  6 carts 30_l._ each, and stock-money\r\n  for the same, 50_l._ each                           480      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Cutlery._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 30 vendors at\r\n  1_s._ 6_d._ each                                      2      5     0\r\n\r\n  _Blind Street-Sellers of Tailors’ Needles._\r\n\r\n  6 boxes at 1_s._ 6_d._ each;

Say that during the winter\r\n  or the remaining 13 weeks of the\r\n  year, their receipts are 15_l._ each per\r\n  week, this amounts to upwards of\r\n  1000_l._ additional, thus making a gross\r\n  annual outlay with these dealers of               6,000      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Cutlery._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning there are 30 men who\r\n  are engaged regularly in the sale of\r\n  cutlery, and that the average takings\r\n  of each are about 15_s._ weekly, this\r\n  gives a yearly expenditure in the street-trade\r\n  of cutlery                                        1,170      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Blind Street-Sellers of Tailors’ Needles._\r\n\r\n  There are now 6 men engaged in\r\n  selling needles at the several tailors’\r\n  shops, and calculating their average\r\n  daily receipts to be 2_s._ 6_d._ or 15_s._\r\n  a week each, we find that the annual\r\n  takings of the whole are                            234      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Metal-Spoons in Publichouses._\r\n\r\n  From the best information I can\r\n  arrive at, the number of metal-spoon\r\n  hawkers is 20, each of whom take\r\n  upon an average 16_s._ weekly, thus\r\n  showing a yearly expenditure in the\r\n  street-sale of spoons of                            832      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Jewellery._\r\n\r\n  I am informed that there are at\r\n  present 500 persons engaged in the\r\n  street sale of jewellery, and calculating\r\n  a weekly profit of 10_s._ 6_d._, and\r\n  a receipt of 18_s._ per individual, we\r\n  find expended in the street-trade                23,400\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Card-Counters._\r\n\r\n  If there be, on the year’s average,\r\n  only two street-sellers disposing of\r\n  “Jacks” and earning 9_s._ a week,--to\r\n  earn which the receipts will be about\r\n  20_s._,--we find expended in the streets\r\n  on these trifles annually                           104      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Medals._\r\n\r\n  An intelligent man, familiar with\r\n  the trade, and who was in the habit\r\n  of clubbing his stock-money with two\r\n  others, so that they might buy a gross\r\n  of medals at a time, calculated that\r\n  15 medal-sellers were engaged in\r\n  the traffic the year through, and\r\n  earned, upon medals alone, 6_d._ a day\r\n  each, to clear which they must take\r\n  6_s._ 6_d._ weekly, giving a yearly outlay of       253     10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Rings and Sovereigns for a\r\n  Wager._\r\n\r\n  One of this class, who is “up to all\r\n  the dodges of the trade,” informed me\r\n  that there were only 6 men working\r\n  the rings and sovereigns now in the\r\n  streets, and that the average takings\r\n  of each might be about 12_s._ weekly,\r\n  thus showing a yearly expenditure of                187      4     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Children’s Gilt Watches._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 25 persons now\r\n  vend watches for twelve weeks in the\r\n  year and that each clears 8_s._ weekly,\r\n  taking 24_s._, we find yearly expended\r\n  in London streets on these toy watches              360      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Tin-Ware._\r\n\r\n  If we calculate an average receipt,\r\n  per individual, of 10_s._ weekly: we find,\r\n  reckoning 100 sellers, a yearly expenditure\r\n  on tins, bought in the street, of                 2,600      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Swag-Barrowmen._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 100 of these\r\n  traders are, the year round, in London\r\n  (some are absent all the summer at\r\n  country fairs, and on any favourable\r\n  opportunity), and that each takes 2_l._\r\n  weekly, we find thus expended in the\r\n  streets of London, in a year, no less than       10,400      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Sellers of Dog-Collars, Key-Rings, &c._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning 12_s._ weekly taken by\r\n  12 men, there is expended yearly in\r\n  the streets upon dog-collars                        374      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Tools._\r\n\r\n  There are at present 40 men engaged\r\n  in selling tools throughout the\r\n  metropolis and they each average\r\n  about 15_s._ weekly. This gives a\r\n  yearly outlay of                                  1,560      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Crockery and Glass-Wares._\r\n\r\n  According to the best calculation\r\n  there are 380 vendors of crockery\r\n  and glass-wares, and the average takings\r\n  of each may be said to amount to\r\n  10_s._ weekly, so giving an annual expenditure\r\n  in the streets of                                 9,880      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Spar-Ornaments._\r\n\r\n  In this trade I am informed that\r\n  there are now 12 men, 9 of whom\r\n  are assisted by their wives, and that\r\n  in the summer months there are\r\n  18. Their profits are about 15_s._ per\r\n  week on an average of the whole\r\n  year. What amount of money may\r\n  be expended by the public in the\r\n  street-purchase of “spars” I am unable\r\n  definitely to state, so much being done\r\n  in the way of barter; but assuming\r\n  that there are 14 sellers throughout\r\n  the year, and that their profits are\r\n  cent. per cent., there would appear to\r\n  be laid out in the streets every year\r\n  on these articles, about                          1,000      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of China-Ornaments._\r\n\r\n  There are, I am informed, about\r\n  30 persons in this trade. If we\r\n  calculate the receipts at 10_s._ weekly\r\n  (a low average considering the success\r\n  of some of the raffles), we find yearly\r\n  expended in the streets in these ornamental\r\n  productions                                         780      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Stone-Fruit._\r\n\r\n  Supposing that there are 6 persons\r\n  selling stone-fruit in the streets\r\n  through the year, and that each earns\r\n  9_s._ weekly (one man said 7_s._ 6_d._ was\r\n  the limit of his weekly profits), we find\r\n  140_l._ received as profit on these articles,\r\n  and calculating the gains at 33\r\n  per cent., an outlay of                             420      0     0\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEXTILE.\r\n\r\n  _Packmen and Duffers, or Hawkers of Soft Wares._\r\n\r\n  I am told by a London hawker of\r\n  soft goods that the number of his\r\n  craft, hawking London and its vicinity,\r\n  as far as he can judge, is about 120.\r\n  In this number are included the Irish\r\n  linen hawkers. I am also informed\r\n  that the fair trader’s profits amount to\r\n  about 20 per cent., while those of the\r\n  not over-particular trader range from\r\n  80 to 200 per cent. In a fair way of\r\n  business it is said the hawker’s takings\r\n  will amount, upon an average, to 7_l._\r\n  or 8_l._ per week; whereas the receipts\r\n  of the “duffer,” or unfair hawker, will\r\n  sometimes reach to 50_l._ per week;\r\n  at 7_l._ per week each, the gross takings\r\n  will amount to                                   43,680      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Small Ware, or Tapes, Cottons,\r\n  Laces, &c._\r\n\r\n  From the best data at my command,\r\n  I believe there are not fewer than 500\r\n  individuals selling these wares in London.\r\n  Their weekly receipts do not\r\n  appear to average more than 6_s._ each,\r\n  hence the expenditure on these articles\r\n  will amount to                                    7,800      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Lace._\r\n\r\n  100 persons in this trade may be\r\n  said each to take 10_s._ 6_d._ weekly, the\r\n  profit being about cent. per cent.;\r\n  hence the annual sum expended in\r\n  the streets in lace and similar commodities is    2,730      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Japanned Table-Covers._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 15 street-sellers\r\n  each take 25_s._ weekly the year round--one-half\r\n  being the profit, including\r\n  their advantages in bartering\r\n  and raffling--we find there is expended\r\n  yearly upon japanned table-covers,\r\n  bought in the streets                               975      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Braces and Belts._\r\n\r\n  500 brace-sellers are said to clear 5_s._\r\n  a week each on those articles alone,\r\n  and estimating the profit at 33 per\r\n  cent., it shows a street expenditure of\r\n  26,196_l._, and calculating one-eighth\r\n  less for belts, we find that the annual\r\n  outlay in the streets on braces and\r\n  belts is                                         29,470      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Hose._\r\n\r\n  A few pairs of women’s stockings\r\n  are hawked by women, and sold to\r\n  servant-maids; but the trade in these\r\n  goods, I am informed, including all\r\n  classes of sellers--of whom there may\r\n  be fifty--does not exceed (notwithstanding\r\n  the universality of the wear)\r\n  the receipt of 6_s._ weekly per individual,\r\n  with a profit of from 1_s._ 4_d._ to\r\n  2_s._; thus there is an aggregate expenditure\r\n  yearly of                                           800      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Waistcoats._\r\n\r\n  There are sometimes no waistcoat-sellers\r\n  at all; but generally two, and\r\n  not unfrequently three. The profits\r\n  of these men are 1_s._ on a bad, and\r\n  2_s._ 6_d._ on a good day. As, at intervals,\r\n  the street-sellers dispose\r\n  of a sleeve-waistcoat (waistcoat with\r\n  sleeves) at from 4_s._ 6_d._ to 6_s._, we may\r\n  estimate the average earnings in the\r\n  trade at 5_s._ per market day, or 10_s._ in\r\n  the week; assuming their profits to\r\n  be 33 per cent., this shows an annual\r\n  outlay of                                           312      0     0\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHEMICAL.\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Blacking._\r\n\r\n  There are at present 230 vendors\r\n  of blacking in the London streets.\r\n  210 of these sell cake and liquid\r\n  blacking, each taking 6_s._ weekly,\r\n  while the 20 others “work” the\r\n  Mews with a superior kind of blacking,\r\n  taking 15_s._ each; thus there is a\r\n  yearly expenditure in the sale of\r\n  blacking in the streets of                        4,056      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Black-Lead._\r\n\r\n  There are, I am informed, 100 to\r\n  150 persons selling and hawking\r\n  black-lead in the streets; it may\r\n  be estimated that they take 4_s._ each\r\n  weekly (the adults selling other small\r\n  articles with the black-lead); thus\r\n  we find--averaging the number of\r\n  sellers at 125--that there is expended\r\n  yearly in the street-sale of this article         1,300      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of French Polish._\r\n\r\n  The French-polish-Sellers, I am assured\r\n  by a man familiar with the\r\n  business, take 2_s._ a day each; the\r\n  2_s._ leaves a profit of 10_d._ The street\r\n  expenditure is, therefore (reckoning\r\n  five regular sellers) annually                      156      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Grease-removing Composition._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 7 grease-removers\r\n  carry on the sale of the article 3 days\r\n  each week, and clear 1_s._ 6_d._ per day,\r\n  we find a yearly expenditure on this\r\n  commodity equal to                                   81     18     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Plating-Balls._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning that 4 men are engaged\r\n  in selling plating-balls 3 days in each\r\n  week, and that each take 2_s._ a day,\r\n  we find there is an annual outlay on\r\n  the sale of this article of                          62      8     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Corn Salve._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 8 of these traders\r\n  take 10_s._ weekly, we find there is\r\n  expended in the streets on this salve               208      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Glass and China-Cement._\r\n\r\n  There are at present 4 men vending\r\n  this article in the streets of London,\r\n  and if each seller take 5_s._ weekly (of\r\n  which 4_s._ may be profit), we find\r\n  there is expended yearly by street\r\n  customers in this cement                             52      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Razor Paste._\r\n\r\n  Calculating that 6 men “work”\r\n  the metropolis daily, taking 2_s._ each\r\n  per day (with 1_s._ 2_d._ profit), we find\r\n  the amount of the street outlay to be\r\n  upwards of                                          187      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Crackers and Detonating-Balls._\r\n\r\n  I am assured that for a few days\r\n  last November, from 50 to 60 men\r\n  and women were selling crackers in\r\n  the streets. The most intelligent man\r\n  that I met with, acquainted, as he\r\n  called it, “with all the ins and outs\r\n  of the trade,” calculated that during\r\n  the month of November and at Christmas,\r\n  100_l._ at least was expended in\r\n  the streets in these combustibles, and\r\n  another 100_l._ at other times of the\r\n  year, thus giving altogether a yearly\r\n  outlay of                                           200      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Lucifer-Matches._\r\n\r\n  Supposing that each of the 200\r\n  traders take, on lucifers alone, but\r\n  4_s._ weekly, selling nine dozen (with\r\n  a profit to the seller of from 1_s._ 9_d._ to\r\n  2_s._ 6_d._), we find on lucifer-matches\r\n  bought in the streets an annual outlay of         2,080      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Cigar-Lights or Fuzees._\r\n\r\n  It will, I believe, be accurate to\r\n  state that in the streets there are\r\n  generally 100 persons subsisting, or\r\n  endeavouring to subsist, on the sale of\r\n  fuzees alone. It may be estimated\r\n  also that each of these traders averages\r\n  a receipt of 10_d._ a day (with a\r\n  profit exceeding 6_d._), so that the sum\r\n  yearly laid out in the streets in this\r\n  way amounts to                                    1,300      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Gutta-Percha Heads, &c._\r\n\r\n  There are at present, I am informed,\r\n  30 persons selling gutta-percha\r\n  heads in the streets, some of\r\n  them confining their business solely\r\n  to those articles. Their average receipts,\r\n  I am assured, do not exceed\r\n  5_s._ a week each, for, though some\r\n  may take 15_s._ a week, others, and\r\n  generally the stationary head-sellers,\r\n  do not take 1_s._ The profit to the\r\n  street retailer is one-third of his\r\n  receipts. From this calculation it\r\n  appears, that if the present rate of\r\n  sale continue, the sum spent yearly in\r\n  these street toys is                                390      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Fly-Papers and Beetle-Wafers._\r\n\r\n  Last summer, I was informed, there\r\n  were 50 or 60 persons selling fly-papers\r\n  and beetle-wafers in the\r\n  streets; some of them boys, and all\r\n  of them of the general class of street-sellers,\r\n  who “take” to any trade for\r\n  which 1_s._ suffices as capital. Their\r\n  average earnings may be estimated at\r\n  2_s._ 6_d._ a day, about one-half being\r\n  profit. This gives a street outlay, for\r\n  a “season” of ten weeks, of                         375      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Poison for Rats._\r\n\r\n  Calculating 25 sellers of rat-poison,\r\n  and each taking on an average 1_s._\r\n  daily for the sale of their article, we\r\n  find that the sum annually expended\r\n  upon this commodity amounts to                      390      0     0\r\n\r\n\r\n  MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Walking-Sticks._\r\n\r\n  For 12 weeks of the year there are,\r\n  I am told, every day 35 stick-sellers,\r\n  each taking, on an average, 30_s._ a\r\n  week (with a profit, individually, of\r\n  about 12_s._); we find thus that the sum\r\n  expended yearly in walking-sticks in\r\n  the streets is                                      630      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Whips, &c._\r\n\r\n  Averaging that 30 whip-sellers\r\n  take 25_s._ each weekly (with profits of\r\n  from 5_s._ to 10_s._) in London alone, we\r\n  find that the yearly sum expended in\r\n  the streets in whips amounts to                   1,950      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Pipes (Tobacco)._\r\n\r\n  If we calculate that 4 persons sell\r\n  pipes daily the year through, taking\r\n  each 25_s._ (and clearing 10_s._), we find\r\n  the yearly sum expended upon the\r\n  hawkers’ pipes amounts to                           260      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Snuff-Boxes, Tobacco-Boxes, &c._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning that 15 persons trading\r\n  on snuff and tobacco and cigar-boxes\r\n  take 18_s._ weekly (clearing 7_s._ or 8_s._),\r\n  we find the sum thus expended annually\r\n  amounts to                                          702      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Cigars._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning the number of vendors\r\n  of cigars at 100, and the average\r\n  takings of each to be 20_s._ weekly, we\r\n  have a yearly outlay of                           5,200      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Sponge._\r\n\r\n  Calculating, then, that only 50 persons\r\n  (and so allowing for irregularities\r\n  in the trade) vend sponge\r\n  daily, and that each takes 15_s._ weekly,--some\r\n  taking 25_s._, and others but\r\n  5_s._--with about half profit on the\r\n  whole (the common sponge is often\r\n  from 200 to 300 per cent. profit), we\r\n  find the outlay to be                             1,950      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Wash-Leather._\r\n\r\n  There are, I am assured, 100 individuals\r\n  selling little or nothing else\r\n  but wash-leather in London (for these\r\n  traders are found in all the suburbs),\r\n  and that they respectively take 10_s._\r\n  weekly, with a profit of from 4_s._ to\r\n  5_s._ There are, also, 100 other persons\r\n  selling them occasionally, along\r\n  with other goods, and as they vend\r\n  the higher-priced articles, they probably\r\n  receive nearly an equal amount.\r\n  Hence it would appear that there is\r\n  annually expended in the streets in\r\n  this purchase, upwards of                         5,000      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Spectacles and Eye-glasses._\r\n\r\n  It may be estimated, I am assured\r\n  that there are 35 men who\r\n  vend these articles daily, taking 15_s._\r\n  a week (with a profit of 10_s._), the\r\n  yearly expenditure being thus                     1,365      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Dolls._\r\n\r\n  There are, at least, at this time of\r\n  year, when the fairs are coming on,\r\n  50 doll-hawkers, who vend nothing\r\n  else. Say that each of these sell one\r\n  dozen dolls per day, and that their\r\n  average price is 4_d._ each; that is just\r\n  10_l._ a day, and 60_l._ per week. In the\r\n  winter time so many are not sold; but\r\n  I have no doubt that 50_l._’s worth of\r\n  dolls are sold each week throughout\r\n  the year by London hawkers alone,\r\n  hence the annual outlay on street-dolls\r\n  would be close upon                               3,000      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street Lot-sellers._\r\n\r\n  It may be estimated that 50 men\r\n  carry on this trade. Each of these\r\n  may take 13_s._ weekly (with a profit\r\n  of 7_s._ 6_d._), so showing the annual\r\n  street outlay to be                               1,690      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Roulette Tables._\r\n\r\n  Calculating the 2 sellers of Roulette\r\n  tables take 30_s._ each weekly, we find\r\n  the annual outlay amounts to                        156      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Rhubarb._\r\n\r\n  Reckoning 4 street-sellers of rhubarb\r\n  and spice each taking 18_s._\r\n  weekly, we find the sum annually\r\n  spent in the sale of these articles to\r\n  be upwards of                                       187      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Rat-Catchers._\r\n\r\n  There are, I am told, 100 rat-catchers\r\n  resorting, at intervals, to London,\r\n  but only a fourth of that number\r\n  can be estimated as carrying on their\r\n  labours regularly in town; their average\r\n  earnings, I am assured, do not exceed\r\n  15_s._ a week; thus there is a\r\n  yearly expenditure of                               975      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Combs._\r\n\r\n  From the best information I have\r\n  gained, there are 50 persons who sell\r\n  nothing but combs, the average takings\r\n  of each are 9_s._ a week, showing the\r\n  yearly outlay in the streets on these\r\n  articles to be                                    1,170      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Money-Bags._\r\n\r\n  There are at present 50 persons consisting\r\n  of men, women, and children\r\n  vending money-bags in the streets of\r\n  London, each taking on an average\r\n  1_s._ 6_d._ daily, or 9_s._ per week, and so\r\n  giving a yearly expenditure of                    1,170      0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Coat-Studs._\r\n\r\n  There are, I am informed, no less\r\n  than 70 persons, consisting of men,\r\n  women, and children. These, I am told,\r\n  take upon an average 15_s._ a week each,\r\n  their usual profits being cent. per cent.;\r\n  thus we find a yearly outlay on\r\n  studs bought in the streets of                    2,730      0     0\r\n                                                 ---------------------\r\n  Total amount of income                         £188,189      0
