Aside from their general human interest, they are valuable\r\nto the student of social history, and almost essential to an\r\nunderstanding of the literature of their time. The whole fabric of the\r\nromances was based upon the intricate system of “courtesy” as here set\r\nforth, and John Russell furnishes an interesting comment on Chaucer and\r\nhis school, as do Rhodes and Seager and Weste on the writers of the\r\nsixteenth century. Finally, among these treatises, there is many a plum\r\nby the way for the seeker of proverbs, curious lore, superstitions,\r\nliterary oddities. And as comparatively few people have time or\r\ninclination to worry through antiquated English, Dr. Furnivall has long\r\nwished that the substance of his collections might be presented in\r\nmodern form. Therefore this little volume has been undertaken.\r\n\r\nDoubtless unwritten codes of behaviour are coeval with society; but the\r\nearliest treatises that we possess emphasize morals rather than manners.\r\nEven the late Latin author known as Dionysius Cato (fourth century?),\r\nwhose maxims were constantly quoted, translated, imitated, and finally\r\nprinted during the late Middle Ages, does not touch upon the niceties of\r\nconduct that we call manners; wherefore one John Garland, an Englishman\r\neducated at Oxford, who lived much in France during the first half of\r\nthe thirteenth century, felt bound to supplement Cato on these points.\r\nHis work, entitled _Liber Faceti: docens mores hominum, precipue\r\niuuenum, in supplementum illorum qui a moralissimo Cathone erant omissi\r\niuuenibus utiles_,[2] is alluded to as _Facet_ in the first piece in\r\nthis volume, and serves as basis for part of the _Book of Courtesy_.\r\n\r\nBut, earlier than this, Thomasin of Zerklaere, about 1215, wrote in\r\nGerman a detailed treatise on manners called _Der Wälsche Gast_.[3] And\r\nin 1265, Dante’s teacher, Brunetto Latini, published his _Tesoretto_,[3]\r\nwhich was soon followed by a number of similar treatises in Italian.\r\n\r\nWhile we need not hold with the writer of the _Little Children’s Little\r\nBook_, that courtesy came down from heaven when Gabriel greeted the\r\nVirgin, and Mary and Elizabeth met, we must look for its origin\r\nsomewhere; and inasmuch as, in its medieval form at least, it is closely\r\nassociated with the practices of chivalry, we may not unreasonably\r\nsuppose it to have appeared first in France. And although most of the\r\nextant French treatises belong to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries,\r\na lost book of courtesy, translated by Thomasin of Zerklaere, is\r\nsometimes held, on good grounds, to have been derived from French,\r\nrather than from Italian.\r\n\r\nIn any case, such of the English books as were not taken immediately\r\nfrom Latin, came from French sources. To be sure, there is a Saxon poem,\r\nbased it would seem on Cato, though by no means a translation, called _A\r\nFather’s Instructions to his Son_; but this, although it is greatly\r\nexercised about the child’s soul, takes no thought for his finger-nails\r\nor his nose.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, surprising to find that nearly all English words\r\ndenoting manners are of French origin—_courtesy_, _villainy_, _nurture_,\r\n_dignity_, _etiquette_, _debonaire_, _gracious_, _polite_, _gentilesse_,\r\n&c., while to balance them I can, at this moment, recall only three of\r\nSaxon origin—_thew_ (which belongs rather to the list of moral words in\r\nwhich Old English abounds), _churlish_ and _wanton_ (without breeding),\r\nboth of which, significantly enough, are negative of good manners.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the predominance of the French terms is simply that\r\n“French use these gentlemen,” as one old writer puts it; that is, from\r\nthe Conquest until the latter part of the fourteenth century the\r\nlanguage of the invaders prevailed almost entirely among the upper\r\nclasses, who, accordingly, learned their politeness out of French or\r\nLatin books; and it was only with the growth of citizenship and English\r\ntogether, that these matters came to be discussed in this latter tongue\r\nfor the profit of middle-class children, as well as of the “bele babees”\r\nat Court.\r\n\r\nWe must suppose, from numerous hints and descriptions, that an elaborate\r\nsystem of manners and customs prevailed long before it was codified. The\r\nBayeux tapestry (eleventh century) shows a feast, with a server kneeling\r\nto serve, his napkin about his neck, as John Russell prescribes some\r\nfour hundred years later.\r\n\r\nThe romances again, alike in French and in English, describe elaborate\r\nceremonies, and allude constantly to definite laws of courtesy. Now and\r\nagain we find a passage that sets forth the ideal gentleman. Young Horn,\r\nfor example, was taught “skill of wood and river” (hunting and hawking),\r\ncarving, cup-bearing, and harping “with his nails sharp.” Child Florent\r\nshowed his high birth by his love of horse, hawk, and armour, and by his\r\ncontempt of gold; but he was not thought ill-mannered to laugh when his\r\nfoster-father and mother fell down in their attempt to draw a rusty\r\nsword from its scabbard! Chaucer’s _Squire_ might well have been brought\r\nup on a treatise similar to those included in this volume:\r\n\r\n           “Well could he sit on horse and fairly ride;\r\n             He could songs make and fair could he indite,\r\n             Joust and eke dance, and well portray and write.\r\n\r\n                ────────────────\r\n\r\n            Courteous he was, lowly, and serviceáble,\r\n            And carved before his father at the table.”\r\n\r\nBut the _Prioress_ outmatched him, having possibly learned her manners\r\nin the French of “Stratford-atte-Bowe,” in _Les Contenances de la\r\nTable_, or some such thing:\r\n\r\n             “At meatë well y-taught was she withal,\r\n              She let no morsel from her lippës fall,\r\n              Nor wet her fingers in her saucë deep:\r\n              Well could she carry a morsel, and well keep,\r\n              That no dropë did fall upon her breast;\r\n              In courtesy was set full much her lest.[4]\r\n              Her over-lippë wipéd she so clean,\r\n              That in her cup there was no farthing seen\r\n              Of grease, when she drunken had her draught.\r\n              Full seemëly after her meat she raught,[5]\r\n              And certainly she was of great desport,[6]\r\n              And full pleasant, and amiable of port;\r\n              And painéd her to counterfeitë cheer\r\n              Of court, and to be stately in mannér,\r\n              And to be holden digne of reverence.”\r\n\r\nThese maxims were versified that they might be the more easily\r\nremembered, as we know from various expressions, notably “Learn or be\r\nLewd” (ignorant), which occurs at the end of several pieces. In 1612 the\r\nprinciple was stated explicitly, “because children will learn that book\r\nwith most readiness and delight through the running of the metre, as it\r\nis found by experience.” And the fact that versified treatises on\r\nmanners formed part of the schooling of that day, brings up the subject\r\nof medieval education.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this cannot be understood until we have set aside\r\nour modern ideas of master and servant. The old point of view is\r\npicturesquely summed up in a pamphlet of 1598, quoted by Dr. Furnivall.\r\n\r\n“Amongst what sort of people should then this serving-man be sought for?\r\nEven the duke’s son preferred page to the prince, the earl’s second son\r\nattendant upon the duke, the knight’s second son the earl’s servant, the\r\nesquire’s son to wear the knight’s livery, and the gentleman’s son the\r\nesquire’s serving-man. Yea, I know at this day gentlemen, younger\r\nbrothers that wear their elder brother’s blue coat and badge, attending\r\nhim with as reverent regard and dutiful obedience as if he were their\r\nprince or sovereign. Where was then in the prime of this profession\r\nGoodman Tomson’s Jack, or Robin Rush, my Gaffer Russet-coat’s second\r\nson? The one holding the plough, the other whipping the cart-horse,\r\nlabouring like honest men in their vocation. Trick Tom the tailer was\r\nthen a tiler for this trade; as strange to find a blue coat on his back,\r\nwith a badge on his sleeve, as to take Kent Street without a scold, or\r\nNewmarket Heath without a highwayman. But now, being lapped in his\r\nlivery, he thinketh himself as good a man, with the shears at his back,\r\nas the Poet Laureate with a pen in his ear.”\r\n\r\nFrom this passage it is clear that at a time not very much earlier,\r\nserving was a profession in which every rank, except royalty itself (if\r\nindeed this is to be omitted, see pp. 1, 179 below), might honourably\r\nwear the livery of a man of higher rank. Indeed, under the system of\r\nentail, this was, in time of peace, the only possible livelihood for a\r\ngentleman’s younger son, unless he had a special aptitude for law or the\r\nChurch. Debarred from all trade, he could only offer his services to\r\nsome great man who was compelled by his estate to keep up a large\r\nhousehold, and so earn his patronage to provide for the future. It was\r\nfully expected that boys so placed would be helped to opportunities at\r\nCourt or abroad, and girls to good marriages. That these patrons really\r\ntook an interest in their young servitors, and felt responsible for\r\ntheir welfare, appears in many accounts of help bestowed upon men who\r\nafterwards became famous in literature, or scholarship, or state-craft.\r\nAnd as for the girls, Dr. Furnivall quotes an amusing instance of a\r\nmistress who, when reproached with dismissing a gentlewoman without due\r\ncause, thereby injuring her chances for the future, immediately allowed\r\nher forty shillings a year towards her maintenance while she herself\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nAmong rich men it was the custom to receive a number of boys for\r\ntraining in this way. In the household of Lord Percy there were nine\r\nyoung “henchmen” who served him as cup-bearers and in various other\r\ncapacities. To these he allowed servants, one for each two, unless they\r\nwere “at their friends’ finding,” in which case they might have one\r\napiece. Likewise, in his household, his second son was carver, his\r\nthird, sewer.\r\n\r\nBut while in a rich man’s household, younger sons might receive as good\r\na training as if they had been sent elsewhere for the purpose, the case\r\nof the younger sons of a poor gentleman might be sufficiently wretched.\r\nOrlando, in _As You Like It_, speaks feelingly on this point. Although\r\nhis father had left 1000 crowns for his upbringing, he was so neglected\r\nthat he says: “His (his brother’s) horses are bred better, for, besides\r\nthat they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and\r\nto that end riders dearly hired;[7] but I, his brother, gain nothing\r\nunder him but growth ... he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the\r\nplace of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with\r\nmy education.”\r\n\r\nThe alternative to such a life of hardship was either to enter the\r\nChurch or depend upon its charity, or to serve in the household of a man\r\nof rank. While only a few were fitted for the religious life or cared to\r\nundertake it, “many poor gentlemen ... left beggars in consequence of\r\nthe inheritance devolving to the eldest son,” were supported by the\r\ncharity of the Church, as we are told by an Italian visitor to England\r\nin 1496-7.\r\n\r\nThe case of an unmarried daughter living at home, though less desperate,\r\nwas even in well-to-do families sufficiently uncomfortable, as is\r\nplainly hinted in a letter written by Margaret Paston to her husband in\r\n1469. She implores him to find his sister “some worshipful place,” and\r\nconcludes: “I will help to her finding, for we be either of us weary of\r\nother.”\r\n\r\nThe practice of sending children seven or eight years old away from\r\ntheir parents was ostensibly that they “might learn better manners”; but\r\nthe Italian visitor mentioned above concluded uncharitably that the real\r\nreason was, the English had but small affection for their children, and\r\nliked to keep all their comforts to themselves, and moreover knew that\r\nthey would be “better served by strangers than by their own children.”\r\nHowever absurd this may seem at first glance, I incline to think that\r\nthe foreigner may have touched upon truth here, as is borne out by many\r\ninstances of Spartan, even brutal, treatment of children by parents in\r\nthose days. Still, the fact remains that the loss of home life and\r\nparental tenderness was balanced by gain in discipline, education,\r\nsocial opportunity, and the opening up of careers.\r\n\r\nThe education of the various children addressed in these treatises\r\nvaried according to their social status. As early as the twelfth century\r\ncertainly, and perhaps earlier, it was customary for “bele babees,” with\r\nboys and girls, to have a tutor either at home, or in the household of\r\nthe great man with whom they were placed. If they went to school, there\r\nwere at first the monastic and conventual institutions; then later, the\r\nuniversities and grammar-schools. But, in the case of girls like the\r\n_Good Wife’s_ daughter, who sold homespun in the market-place, and had\r\nto be admonished not to get drunk often, I doubt whether there would be\r\nany education beyond her mother’s teaching.\r\n\r\nThe universities, at first, were frequented chiefly by poor men’s sons,\r\nand scarcely attended by the upper classes. In Chaucer’s time, the\r\n_Clerk of Oxenford_ was lean and threadbare, and had but little gold,\r\nand his two Cambridge scholars were in no better case. Nearly two\r\ncenturies later, Sir Thomas More says: “Then may we yet like poor\r\nscholars of Oxford, go a-begging with our bags and wallets, and sing\r\n‘_Salve, Regina_’” (a carol) “at rich men’s doors.” However, gradually\r\nduring the sixteenth century, a university education became so\r\nfashionable that rich men’s sons crowded in, and “scrooged” (I quote Dr.\r\nFurnivall) poor students out of the proceeds of endowments left\r\nexpressly for them. Still, in 1517, the old ideal of a gentleman as yet\r\nheld its own, as is amusingly related by Pace in his _De Fructu_. He\r\ntells how “one of those whom we call gentlemen, who always carry some\r\nhorn hanging at their backs, as though they would hunt during dinner,\r\nsaid: ‘I swear by God’s body I would rather that my son should hang than\r\nstudy letters. For it becomes the sons of gentlemen to blow the horn\r\nnicely, and to hunt skilfully, and elegantly carry and train a hawk. But\r\nthe study of letters should be left to the sons of rustics....’”\r\n\r\nBut Pace was equal to him. “You do not seem to me to think aright, good\r\nman,” said I, “for if any foreigner were to come to the king, such as\r\nare ambassadors of princes, and an answer had to be given to him, your\r\nson if he were educated as you wish, could only blow his horn, and the\r\nlearned sons of rustics would be called to answer, and they would be far\r\npreferred to your hunter or fowler son,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe fashion among noblemen of sending their sons abroad to study, either\r\nat a university or with a tutor, did not prevail widely until later. In\r\nthe twelfth century, indeed, the “English nation” was famous at the\r\nUniversity of Paris, but was composed largely of poor but earnest\r\nstudents, some of whom became famous men; and even these had ceased to\r\nstudy there before the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nYounger sons of good birth, in the service of a man of rank, were\r\nusually taught by a “maistyr” or tutor in the household in which they\r\nwere placed. It is only in later books like Seager’s that these rules of\r\ndemeanour were applied extensively to schoolboys. Doubtless gentlemen’s\r\nsons went to Winchester (after 1373) and to Eton (after 1440); but of\r\nthe thirty grammar-schools endowed before 1500, all the others were\r\nattended chiefly by the middle classes. The early monastic schools\r\ndoubtless entertained young noblemen; but the cathedral schools founded\r\nby Henry VIII. seem to have been for citizens’ children, such as the boy\r\nin Symon’s _Lesson of Wisdom_, who is urged to learn fast so that when\r\nthe old bishop dies he may be ready to take his place. However, even\r\nearlier we find complaints of the monastic schools which helped each\r\nshoemaker to educate his son, and each beggar’s brat to be a writer and\r\nfinally a bishop, so that lords’ sons must kneel to him.\r\n\r\nIn general, the system of education implied in the _Babees’ Book_ is\r\nthat described in the household ordinances of Edward IV. for the young\r\nhenchmen in charge of a “maistyr,” who should teach them to ride cleanly\r\nand surely, to draw them also to jousts, to ... “wear their harness, to\r\nhave all courtesy in words, deeds, and degrees, diligently to keep them\r\nin rules of goings and sittings, after they be of honour.” They learned\r\nalso “sundry languages,” and harping, piping, singing and dancing.\r\nLikewise, their master sat always with them at table in the hall, to see\r\n“how mannerly they eat and drink, and to their communication and other\r\nforms of court, after the book of _Urbanitie_[8].” Clearly it would seem\r\nthat one of the very treatises in this collection was studied by these\r\nyoung pages of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nWhat languages they learned and what else studied we are not told in\r\ndetail; but in Henry VIII.’s time, young Gregory Cromwell, son of the\r\nEarl of Essex, studied French, writing, fencing, “casting accounts,”\r\ninstrumental music, &c. He was also made to read English aloud for the\r\npronunciation, and was taught the etymology of Latin and French words.\r\nHis day was as follows: After Mass, he read first the Colloquium on\r\n_Pietas Puerilis_ (_De Civilitate Morum Puerilium_) by Erasmus (written\r\n1530), of which he had to practice the precepts. Now this is nothing\r\nmore than a collection of maxims similar to the _Facet_ mentioned in the\r\n_Babees’ Book_, together with learned _Scholia_ in Latin and Greek;\r\nhence, he had the same kind of thing to learn—only more elaborate—as the\r\nboys mentioned a hundred years earlier studied in _Urbanitie_. Doubtless\r\nhis master approved the beginning of Erasmus: “Est autem uel prima\r\nuirtutis ac honestatis pars, tenere præcepta de moribus.” The specific\r\nnature of these directions appears in the following:\r\n\r\n“Cleanliness of teeth must be cared for, but to whiten them with powder\r\ndoes for girls. To rub the gum with salt or alum is injurious.... If\r\nanything sticks to the teeth, you must get it out, not with a knife, or\r\nwith your nails after the manner of dogs and cats, or with your napkin,\r\nbut with a toothpick, or quill or small bone taken from the tibias of\r\ncocks or hens. To wash the mouth in the morning with pure water is both\r\nmannerly and healthful; to do it often is foolish.” Indeed, Erasmus’s\r\ntreatise is only a superior book of courtesy.\r\n\r\nHis manners attended to, young Gregory wrote for one or two hours, read\r\nFabyan’s _Chronicle_, and gave the rest of the day to his lute and\r\nvirginals. When he rode, his master used to tell him stories of the\r\nGreeks and Romans, which he had to repeat; and his recreations were\r\nhunting, hawking and shooting with the long bow.\r\n\r\nA harsher system prevailed with Queen Elizabeth’s wards, according to\r\nSir Nicholas Bacon. They went to church at 6 o’clock, studied Latin\r\nuntil 11, dined from 11 to 12, had music from 12 to 2, French from 2 to\r\n3, Latin and Greek from 3 to 5, then prayers, supper, and “honest\r\npastimes” until 8, then music until 9, and so to bed.\r\n\r\nThe curricula in these various schools doubtless emphasized the usual\r\nLatin subjects (Greek was not taught in England before 1500) of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Thus we find an account of the “disputations” in a London\r\ngrammar-school, dating from 1174. But that athletic sports were popular\r\neven at that early time, appears from the same narrative, in which we\r\nread of football, sham fights, water-quintain, archery, running,\r\nleaping, wrestling, stone-casting, flinging bucklers, sliding and\r\nskating (on bones), besides the brutal sports of hog-, boar- and\r\ncock-fighting, bull- and bear-baiting.\r\n\r\nAt the other extreme we find the account of a school-day in 1612. Work\r\nbegins at 6, and those who come first have the best places. At 9\r\no’clock, there is given 15 minutes for breakfast and recreation; then\r\nwork continues until 11 or past (to balance the 15 minutes off). Dinner\r\nfollows, and then work until 3 or 3.30, then 15 minutes off, and work\r\nuntil 5.30, when school closes with a piece of a chapter, two staves of\r\na psalm and prayer by the master.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that these two descriptions are but two sides\r\nof the same medal; that Fitzstephen’s holidays were balanced by work\r\ndays as tedious as those described by Brinsley.[9]\r\n\r\nA singular fact to be noted in the English courtesy books is the almost\r\ncomplete absence of allusions to women. Barring the _Good Wife_ and\r\n_Wise Man_, which are distinctly middle class in tone, we have\r\npractically nothing to represent the elaborate directions for conduct in\r\nsome of the foreign treatises. Yet it cannot be doubted that the English\r\nsystem of patronage led to social problems and rules for the demeanour\r\nof young men and women together, such as prevailed abroad. Undoubtedly,\r\ntoo, the association of a lord’s pages and a lady’s maidens must have\r\nfurthered the arrangement of marriages, perhaps not always in the way\r\ndesired. Take, for example, the case of Anne Boleyn. After seven years’\r\nservice with the royal ladies of France, she came home and was placed in\r\nthe household of Queen Katharine. Meanwhile, there was attendant upon\r\nCardinal Wolsey a certain young Lord Percy, who, whenever his master was\r\nwith the king, would “resort for pastime into the queen’s chamber, and\r\nthere would fall in dalliance among the queen’s maidens.” In the end, he\r\nand Mistress Anne were secretly troth-plight; but Wolsey discovered the\r\narrangement and sent the girl home, whereat she “smoked” (we say\r\n_fumed_) until she was recalled and heard of the great love the king\r\nbore her “in the bottom of his stomach”; then she “began to look very\r\nhault and stout, having all manner of jewels or rich apparel that might\r\nbe gotten for money.” And doubtless there are many other similar\r\ncomplications to be found among old records, and more have perished, or\r\nwere never written down at all.\r\n\r\nIt is something of a shock to turn from the elaborate rules for carving\r\nand serving, as set forth by Russell and others, to the domestic records\r\nof the time. The mingled splendour and squalor of the Middle Ages almost\r\npasses belief. We read of priceless hangings and costumes that cost each\r\na small fortune, yet Erasmus describes the floors in noblemen’s houses\r\nas sometimes encumbered with refuse for twenty years together.[10] King\r\nEdward IV. was provided with a barber who shaved him once a week, and\r\nwashed his head, feet, and legs, _if_ he so desired. A proper bath,\r\naccording to Russell, seems to have been an event to be heralded with\r\nflowers and resorted to chiefly as curative. We see to-day the splendid\r\npalaces and castles, such as Hampton Court and Windsor, Knole and\r\nPenshurst and Warwick, built by kings and noblemen, and yet Henry VIII\r\nhad to enact a law against the filthy condition of the servants in his\r\nown kitchen, and Wolsey, passing through the suitors in Westminster\r\nHall, carried disinfectants concealed in an orange. It is this contrast\r\nin manners, doubtless, which will first strike the reader. A young\r\nnobleman had to be instructed not only how to hold his carving-knife\r\nwith a thumb and two fingers, but also not to dip his meat into the\r\nsalt-cellar, or lick the dust out of dish with his tongue, or wipe his\r\nnose on the table-cloth; and other instructions were added too primitive\r\nfor translation. Undoubtedly, the general impression that one derives\r\nis, as Dr. Furnivall puts it, of “dirty, ill-mannered, awkward young\r\ngawks,” whose “maistyrs” were greatly to be pitied. But, on the whole,\r\nit is surprising to note how little the fundamental bases of good\r\nmanners have altered. Though we are not to-day so plain-spoken, our\r\nideals are similar to those of our ancestors, but theirs was the greater\r\ndifficulty of attainment. Personal cleanliness, self-respect, reverence\r\nto one’s better, and consideration for one’s neighbour seem to have been\r\nthen as they are now, the foundation-stones.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is interesting to notice the development of\r\nmanners with improved conditions of life. One code was altered with the\r\nintroduction of the handkerchief, another with the use of the fork\r\n(apparently first mentioned in 1463, but not common until after 1600,\r\nthough it had long been in use on the Continent), and so on, so that by\r\ndegrees social expedients and ceremonies change, while essentials\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nOf each of the pieces here included I give a brief account in the notes.\r\nNeedless to say, they form only a small portion of an enormous practical\r\nliterature, though they are fairly representative of the English branch\r\nof it, for the time that they cover. In order to bring even so much\r\nwithin the compass of this small volume, it has been found necessary to\r\ncondense. The principle of condensation has been as follows: whenever a\r\ntext is particularly wordy for the matter that it contains, or has been\r\nfound difficult to reproduce in modern language in the old verse-form,\r\nit has been done simply into prose. In cases where the metrical form has\r\nbeen preserved, perhaps both rhythm and rhyme have suffered in the\r\ntranslation; but in no instance has there been any poetic beauty lost,\r\nfor the plain reason that the literary value of these productions is\r\nnil. In addition to a few omissions on grounds of taste, I have put\r\naside various recipes and dietaries, hoping to use them later in a book\r\ndevoted entirely to that sort of thing; and for the same reason, I have\r\nomitted considerable portions of Russell’s work, in which he deals with\r\nthe dietetic properties and values of different kinds of food, describes\r\nvarious sorts of wines, enters into the details of carving fish, flesh,\r\nand fowl, and sets forth numerous recipes and elaborate menus. It is all\r\ninteresting but has little to do with manners. Likewise, I have omitted\r\nWynkyn de Worde’s _Book of Carving_, which seems to be only a prose\r\nversion of Russell, portions of Rhodes’s work which deal rather with\r\nprofessional serving-men, and of Seager’s and West’s books, which treat\r\nof morals rather than manners. Further, I have omitted the various Latin\r\nand French poems on the subject, and a number of odds and ends of a\r\ngenerally didactic character, which, it seemed, could be best spared.\r\n\r\nIn translating, I have tried to keep as much as possible the quaint\r\nflavour of the originals, especially in the case of those rendered into\r\nmodern English in the verse form. To that end I have retained old words\r\nand constructions whenever they seemed intelligible, although eccentric\r\nand perhaps ungrammatical to-day. When an archaic word alone conveyed\r\nthe exact meaning, or was especially picturesque, I have left it, with a\r\ngloss at the bottom of the page, where also I refer to notes at the end,\r\non points which seem to require special elucidation. My aim throughout\r\nhas been to make the texts clear with the minimum of alteration.\r\nDoubtless I could have improved the metre frequently by merely a change\r\nin order of words; but I thought it better to meddle as little as\r\npossible, except for the sake of clearness; and so the verse often bumps\r\nalong cheerfully, regardless of rhythm, style, and grammar. I think I\r\nmay claim that in substance the modernised _Babees’ Book_ is as near as\r\npossible to its original.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the translations have been made by Miss L. J. Naylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BABEES’ BOOK\r\n\r\n                                   OR\r\n\r\n           A LITTLE REPORT OF HOW YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY He who formed mankind in His image, support me while I turn this\r\ntreatise out of Latin into my common language, that through this little\r\ncomment all of tender years may receive instruction in courtesy and\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nFacet[11] saith that the Book of Courtesy to teach the practice of\r\nvirtue is the most helpful thing in the world, so I will not shrink from\r\nthis labour or refuse it; but for mine own learning will say something\r\nthat touches upon the matter.\r\n\r\nBut oh, young babies, whom blood royal hath endowed with grace,\r\ncomeliness, and high ability, it is on you I call to know this book, for\r\nit were great pity but that ye added to sovereign beauty virtue and good\r\nmanners. Therefore I speak to you specially, and not to old men expert\r\nin governance, decorum, and honest manners, for what need is to give\r\npangs to Hell, joy to Heaven, water to the sea, or heat to fire already\r\nhot?\r\n\r\nAnd so, young babies,[12] my book is only for your instruction;\r\nwherefore I pray that no man reprehend it, but amend it where it is at\r\nfault, and judge it not, for your own sake. I seek no other reward but\r\nthat it may please men and give you some ease in learning.[12] Also,\r\nsweet children, if there be in it any word that ye ken not, speer[13]\r\nwhile ye may, and when ye know it, bear it in mind; and so by asking you\r\nmay learn of wise men. Also, think not too strangely that my pen writes\r\nin this metre;[12] for such verse is commonly used, therefore take heed.\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, I think to show how you babies who dwell in\r\nhouseholds, should ’have[14] yourselves when ye be set at meat, and how\r\nwhen men bid you be merry, you should be ready with lovely, sweet and\r\nbenign words. In this, aid me, O Mary, Mother Revered; and eke, O lady\r\nmine, Facetia,[12] guide thou my pen and show unto me help. For as A is\r\nthe first of all letters, so art thou mother of all virtue. Have pity,\r\nsweet lady, of my lack of wit, and though untaught I speak of demeanour,\r\nsupport my ignorance with thy goodly aid.\r\n\r\nAh, “bele[15] babees,” hearken now to my lore.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter your lord’s place, say “God speed,” and with humble cheer\r\ngreet all who are there present. Do not rush in rudely, but enter with\r\nhead up and at an easy pace, and kneel on one knee only to your lord or\r\nsovereign, whichever he be.\r\n\r\nIf any speak to you at your coming, look straight at them with a steady\r\neye, and give good ear to their words while they be speaking; and see to\r\nit with all your might that ye jangle[16] not, nor let your eyes wander\r\nabout the house, but pay heed to what is said, with blithe visage and\r\ndiligent spirit. When ye answer, ye shall be ready with what ye shall\r\nsay, and speak “things fructuous,”[17] and give your reasons smoothly in\r\nwords that are gentle but compendious,[18] for many words are right\r\ntedious to the wise man who listens; therefore eschew them with\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\nTake no seat, but be ready to stand until you are bidden to sit down.\r\nKeep your hands and feet at rest; do not claw your flesh or lean against\r\na post, in the presence of your lord, or handle anything belonging to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nMake obeisance to your lord always when you answer; otherwise, stand as\r\nstill as a stone, unless he speak.\r\n\r\nLook with one accord that if ye see any person better than yourself come\r\nin, ye go backwards anon and give him place, and in nowise turn your\r\nface from him, as far forth as you may.\r\n\r\nIf you see your lord drinking, keep silence, without loud laughter,\r\nchattering, whispering, joking or other insolence.\r\n\r\nIf he command you to sit in his presence, fulfil his wish at once, and\r\nstrive not with another about your seat.\r\n\r\nWhen you are set down, tell no dishonest tale; eschew also, with all\r\nyour might, to be scornful; and let your cheer be humble, blithe, and\r\nmerry, not chiding as if ye were ready for a fight.\r\n\r\nIf you perceive that your better is pleased to commend you, rise up anon\r\nand thank him heartily.\r\n\r\nIf you see your lord and lady speaking of household matters, leave them\r\nalone, for that is courtesy, and interfere not with their doing; but be\r\nready, without feigning, to do your lord service, and so shall you get a\r\ngood name.\r\n\r\nAlso, to fetch him drink, to hold the light when it is time, and to do\r\nwhatsoever ought to be done, look ye be ready; for so shall ye full soon\r\nget a gentle name in nurture. And if you should ask a boon of God, you\r\ncan desire no better thing than to be well-mannered.\r\n\r\nIf your lord is pleased to offer you his own cup to drink, rise when you\r\ntake it, and receive it goodly with both your hands, and when you have\r\ndone, proffer it to no man else, but render it again to him that brought\r\nit, for in nowise should it be used commonly—so wise men teach us.\r\n\r\nNow must I tell you shortly what you shall do at noon when your lord\r\ngoes to his meat. Be ready to fetch him clear water, and some of you\r\nhold the towel for him until he has done, and leave not until he be set\r\ndown, and ye have heard grace said. Stand before him until he bids you\r\nsit, and be always ready to serve him with clean hands.\r\n\r\nWhen ye be set, keep your own knife clean and sharp, that so ye may\r\ncarve honestly[19] your own meat.\r\n\r\nLet courtesy and silence dwell with you, and tell no foul tales to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCut your bread with your knife and break it not. Lay a clean\r\ntrencher[20] before you, and when your pottage is brought, take your\r\nspoon and eat quietly; and do not leave your spoon in the dish, I pray\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLook ye be not caught leaning on the table, and keep clear of soiling\r\nthe cloth.\r\n\r\nDo not hang your head over your dish, or in any wise drink with full\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nKeep from picking your nose, your teeth, your nails at meal-time—so we\r\nare taught.\r\n\r\nAdvise you against taking so muckle meat into your mouth but that ye may\r\nright well answer when men speak to you.\r\n\r\nWhen ye shall drink, wipe your mouth clean with a cloth, and your hands\r\nalso, so that you shall not in any way soil the cup, for then shall none\r\nof your companions be loth to drink with you.\r\n\r\nLikewise, do not touch the salt in the salt-cellar with any meat; but\r\nlay salt honestly on your trencher, for that is courtesy.\r\n\r\nDo not carry your knife to your mouth with food, or hold the meat with\r\nyour hands in any wise; and also if divers good meats are brought to\r\nyou, look that with all courtesy ye assay of each; and if your dish be\r\ntaken away with its meat and another brought, courtesy demands that ye\r\nshall let it go and not ask for it back again.\r\n\r\nAnd if strangers be set at table with you, and savoury meat be brought\r\nor sent to you, make them good cheer with part of it, for certainly it\r\nis not polite when others be present at meat with you, to keep all that\r\nis brought you, and like churls vouchsafe nothing to others.\r\n\r\nDo not cut your meat like field-men who have such an appetite that they\r\nreck not in what wise, where or when or how ungoodly they hack at their\r\nmeat; but, sweet children, have always your delight in courtesy and in\r\ngentleness, and eschew boisterousness with all your might.\r\n\r\nWhen cheese is brought, have a clean trencher, on which with a clean\r\nknife ye may cut it; and in your feeding look ye appear goodly, and keep\r\nyour tongue from jangling, for so indeed shall ye deserve a name for\r\ngentleness and good governance, and always advance yourself in virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen the end of the meal is come, clean your knives, and look you put\r\nthem up where they ought to be,[21] and keep your seat until you have\r\nwashed, for so wills honesty.\r\n\r\nWhen ye have done, look then that ye rise up without laughter or joking\r\nor boisterous word, and go to your lord’s table, and there stand, and\r\npass not from him until grace be said and brought to an end.\r\n\r\nThen some of you should go for water, some hold the cloth, some pour\r\nupon his hands.\r\n\r\nOther things I might commend you to do, but as my time is brief, I put\r\nthem not into this little report; but overpass them, praying with a\r\nspirit that rejoices in this labour, that no man abuse me; but where too\r\nlittle is, let him add more, and where too much, let him take away, for\r\nthough I would, time forbids that I say more. Therefore I take my leave,\r\nand inscribe this book to every wight whom it may please to correct it.\r\n\r\nAnd, sweet children, for love of whom I write, I beseech you, with very\r\nloving heart, that you set your delight upon knowing this book; and may\r\nAlmighty God that suffered bitter pains, make you so expert in courtesy\r\nthat through your nurture and your governance you may advance yourselves\r\nto lasting bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE A B C OF ARISTOTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n     WHOSO wills to be wise and worship desires,\r\n          Learn he one letter and look on another,\r\n     Of the A B C of Aristotle.

Not to ’file[44] the fair towél.\r\n              Nor wipe your nose upon the cloth;\r\n              To pick your teeth at meat be loth.\r\n              Nor in the cup too deeply sink,\r\n              Though ye have good will to drink,\r\n              Lest your eyen water thereby;\r\n              For then it is no courtesy.\r\n              Look in your mouth there be no meat,\r\n              When you begin to drink or speak.\r\n              And when you see a man would drink,\r\n              Who heeds your carping,[45] you bethink,\r\n              And soon anon make end your tale,\r\n              Whether he drink wine or ale.\r\n              And look, ye scorn no man also,\r\n              In what degree ye see him go.\r\n              No man shall ye reprove or chide,\r\n              If ye in worship[46] would abide.\r\n              For words ye might speak out apace—\r\n              Should make you live in evil case.\r\n              Close your hand upon your fist,[47]\r\n

not your own [good] deed,\r\n              Neither for mirth, nor yet for meed.[50]\r\n              Gentle of speech—ye have your will;\r\n              But foul of speech—ye fare full ill.\r\n              If ye follow a worthier man,\r\n              Than ye yourself well reckon can,\r\n              Let your right shoulder follow his back,[51]\r\n              For that is nurture ye must not lack.\r\n              When he speaks, then hold you still;\r\n              When he has done, say then your will.\r\n              Be careful what you say or tell,\r\n              And in your speech advise you well.\r\n              Bereave[52] ye no man of his tale,\r\n              Neither at wine nor at ale.\r\n              Now may Christ of his sweet grace,\r\n              Give us all both wit and space\r\n              This [treatise] well to know and read,\r\n              And Heaven at last to have for meed.\r\n              Amen, Amen, so may it be.\r\n              So say we all

near\r\n                  And learn the courtesy written here;\r\n              For clerks that well the Seven Arts know,[53]\r\n              Say Courtesy came to earth below,\r\n              When Gabriel hailed Our Lady by name,\r\n              And Elizabeth to Mary came.[53]\r\n              All virtues are closed[54] in courtesy,\r\n              And vices all in villainy.[53]\r\n              Look thy hands be washéd clean,\r\n              That no filth on thy nails be seen.\r\n              Take thou no meat till grace be said,\r\n              And till thou see all things arrayed.[55]\r\n              Look, my son, that thou not sit,\r\n              Till the ruler of the house thee bid.\r\n              And at thy meat, in the beginning,\r\n              Look on poor men that thou think;[56]\r\n              For the full stomach ever faileth\r\n              To understand what the hungry aileth.\r\n              Eat not thy meat too hastily;\r\n              Abide and eat thou easily.\r\n              Till thou have thy full service,\r\n              Touch thou no mess[56] in no wise.\r\n              Carve thou not thy bread too thin,\r\n              Nor break it not in twain.\r\n              The morsels thou beginnest to touch\r\n              Cast them not into thy pouch.\r\n              Put not thy fingers in thy dish,\r\n              Neither in flesh, neither in fish.\r\n              Put not thy meat into the salt,\r\n              Into the cellar, that is a fault;[56]\r\n              But lay it fairly thee before,\r\n              Upon thy trencher, that is good lore.\r\n              Pick not thine ears nor thy nostrils;\r\n              If thou do, men will say thou come of churls.\r\n              And while thy meat in thy mouth is,\r\n              Drink thou not—forget not this.\r\n              Eat thy meat by small morsels too,\r\n              Fill not thy mouth, as brothels[57] do.\r\n              Pick not thy teeth with thy knife.\r\n              In no company begin thou strife.\r\n              And when thou hast thy pottage done,\r\n              Out of thy dish thou put thy spoon.\r\n              Nor spit thou not over the table,\r\n              Nor thereupon—that is nothing able.[58]\r\n              Lay not thy elbow nor thy fist\r\n              Upon the table whiles thou eat’st.\r\n              Bulk[59] not, as a bean were in thy throat,\r\n              As a carl[60] that comes out of a cot.\r\n              If thy meat be of great price,\r\n              Beware of it, or thou art not wise.\r\n              Speak no word, nor still nor stark,[61]\r\n              And honour and courtesy look thou work.[62]\r\n              And at the table look thou make good cheer;\r\n              Look thou whisper not in no man’s ear.\r\n              With thy fingers[62] thou touch and taste\r\n              Thy meat, and look thou do no waste.\r\n              Look thou laugh not neither grin;\r\n              And with much speech thou may’st do sin.\r\n              Meat nor drink look thou not spill,\r\n              But set it down, both fair and still.\r\n              Keep thy cloth clean thee beforn,\r\n              And bear thee so thou have no scorn.\r\n              Bite not thy meat, but carve it clean,\r\n              Be well aware no drop be seen.[63]\r\n              When thou eatest gape not too wide,\r\n              That thy mouth be seen on ilk a side.\r\n              And son, beware, I rede, of one thing:\r\n              Blow neither in thy meat nor in thy drink.\r\n              And if thy lord drink at that tide,\r\n              Drink thou not, but him abide;\r\n              Be it at even, be it at noon,\r\n              Drink thou not till he have done.\r\n              Upon thy trencher no dirt must be;\r\n              It is not honest as I tell thee.\r\n              Nor drink behind no man’s back;[63]\r\n              For if thou do, thou art to lack.\r\n              If cheese come forth, be not too greedy,\r\n              Nor to cut thereof too speedy.\r\n              Cast not thy bones unto the floor,\r\n              But on thy trencher thee before.\r\n              Keep clean thy cloth before thee all,\r\n              And sit thou still, whatso befall,\r\n              Till grace be said unto the end,\r\n              And till thou have washen with thy friend.\r\n              Let him that worthier is than thou art,\r\n              Wash before thee; that is thy part.\r\n              And spit thou not in thy basin\r\n              My sweet son, that thou washest in.\r\n              And arise then up, full soft and still,\r\n              And jangle neither with Jack nor Jill.[64]\r\n              But take thy leave of the head lowly,\r\n              And thank him with thine heart highly,\r\n              And all the gentles together the same,[64]\r\n              And bare thee so thou have no blame.\r\n              Then will men thereafter say:\r\n              “A gentleman was here to-day.”\r\n              And he that despiseth this teaching,\r\n              He is not worthy, without leasing,\r\n              Neither at good man’s table to sit,\r\n              Nor of no worship for to wit.[65]\r\n              And therefore, children, for charity,\r\n              Love this book though it little be,\r\n              And pray for him that made it thus,\r\n              That he may be helped by sweet Jesús,\r\n              To live and die among his friends,\r\n              And never to be cumbered with no fiends.[66]\r\n              And give us grace in joy to be,\r\n              Amen, Amen, for charity!\r\n                        Explicit.\r\n                    Learn or be Lewd,\r\n                                  quoth Whytyng.\r\n\r\nHere endeth the Book of Courtesy that is full necessary unto young\r\nchildren that must needs learn the manner of courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE YOUNG CHILDREN’S BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOSO will thrive must be courteous, and learn the virtues in his youth,\r\nor in his age he is outcast among men. Clerks who know the Seven\r\nSciences[66] say that Courtesy came from heaven when Gabriel greeted our\r\nLady and Elizabeth met with her; and in it are included all virtues, as\r\nall vices in rudeness.\r\n\r\nArise betimes from your bed, cross your breast and your forehead, wash\r\nyour hands and face, comb your hair, and ask the grace of God to speed\r\nyou in all your works; then go to Mass and ask mercy for all your\r\ntrespasses. Say “Good morning” courteously to whomsoever you meet by the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen ye have done, break your fast with good meat and drink, but before\r\neating cross your mouth, your diet will be the better for it. Then say\r\nyour grace—it occupies but little time—and thank the Lord Jesus for your\r\nfood and drink. Say also a _Pater Noster_ and an _Ave Maria_ for the\r\nsouls that lie in pain, and then go labour as you are bound to do. Be\r\nnot idle, for Holy Scripture says to you of Christian faith that if you\r\nwork, you must eat what you get with your hands.[67] A man’s arms are\r\nfor working as a bird’s wings for flying.\r\n\r\nLook you be true in word and deed, the better shall you prosper; for\r\ntruth never works a man shame, but rather keeps him out of sin. The ways\r\nto Heaven are twain, mercy and truth, say clerks; and he who will come\r\nto the life of bliss, must not fail to walk therein.\r\n\r\nMake no promise save it be good, and then keep it with all your might,\r\nfor every promise is a debt that must not be remitted through falsehood.\r\n\r\nLove God and your neighbour, and thus may ye say without fear or dread\r\nthat you keep all the law.\r\n\r\nUncalled go to no council, scorn not the poor, nor hurt any man, learn\r\nof him that can teach you, be no flatterer or scoffer, oppress not your\r\nservants, be not proud, but meek and gentle, and always walk behind your\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\nWhen your better shows his will, be silent; and in speaking to any man\r\nkeep your hands and feet quiet, and look up into his face, and be always\r\ncourteous.\r\n\r\nPoint not with your finger at anything, nor be lief[68] to tell tidings.\r\nIf any man speak well of you or of your friends, he must be thanked.\r\nHave few words and wisely placed, for so may you win a good name.\r\n\r\nUse no swearing or falsehood in buying or selling, else shall you be\r\nshamed at the last. Get your money honestly, and keep out of debt and\r\nsin. Be eager to please, and so live in peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nAdvise you well of whom you speak, and when and where and to whom.\r\n\r\nWhenever you come unto a door, say, “God be here,” ere you go further,\r\nand speak courteously, wherever you are, to sire or dame or their\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nStand, and sit not down to meat until you are told by him that rules the\r\nhall; and do not change your seat, but sit upright and mannerly where he\r\nbids, and eat and drink and be fellowly, and share with him that sits by\r\nyou—thus teaches Dame Courtesy.\r\n\r\nTake your salt with a clean knife.\r\n\r\nBe cool of speech and quarrel not, nor backbite a man who is away, but\r\nbe glad to speak well of all. Hear and see and say nothing, then shall\r\nye not be put to proof.\r\n\r\nHold you pleased with the meat and drink set before you, nor ask for\r\nbetter. Wipe your mouth before you drink lest it foul the edge of the\r\ncup; and keep your fingers, your lips and your chin clean, if you would\r\nwin a good name. When your meat is in your mouth, do not drink or speak\r\nor laugh—Dame Courtesy forbids. Praise your fare, wheresoever you be,\r\nfor whether it be good or bad it must be taken in good part.\r\n\r\nWhether you spit near or far, hold your hand before your mouth to hide\r\nit.\r\n\r\nKeep your knife clean and sharp, and cleanse it on some cut bread, not\r\non the cloth, I bid you; a courteous man is careful of the cloth. Do not\r\nput your spoon in the dish or on the edge of it, as the untaught do, or\r\nmake a noise when you sup as do boys. Do not put the meat off your\r\ntrencher into the dish, but get a voider and empty it into that.\r\n\r\nWhen your better hands you a cup, take it with both hands lest it fall,\r\nand drink yourself and set it by; and if he speaks to you, doff your cap\r\nand bow your knee.\r\n\r\nDo not scratch yourself at the table so that men call you a daw,[69] nor\r\nwipe your nose or nostrils, else men will say you are come of churls.\r\nMake neither the cat nor the dog your fellow at the table. And do not\r\nplay with the spoon, or your trencher, or your knife; but lead your life\r\nin cleanliness and honest manners.\r\n\r\nThis book is made for young children that bide not long at the\r\nschool.[70] It may soon be conned and learned, and will make them good\r\nif they be bad. God give them grace to be virtuous, for so may they\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n                                                   Amen! quoth Kate.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        STANS PUER AD MENSAM[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n         MY dear son, first thyself enable\r\n              With all thine heart to virtuous discipline;\r\n         Afore thy sovereign, standing at the table,\r\n           Dispose thou thyself, after my doctrine,\r\n           To all nurture thy courage to incline.\r\n         First, let all recklessness in speaking cease,\r\n         And keep both hands and fingers still at peace.\r\n\r\n         Be simple of cheer, cast not thy look aside,\r\n           Gaze not about, nor turn thy sight over all;\r\n         Against the post let not thy back abide,\r\n           Neither make thy mirror of the wall.\r\n           Pick not thy nose, and most in speciál,\r\n         Be well aware and set hereon thy thought:\r\n         Before thy sovereign nor scratch nor pick thee nought.\r\n\r\n         Whoso speak to thee in any manner place,\r\n           Lumpishly cast not thy head adown,\r\n         But with sober cheer look in his face;\r\n           Demurely walk through streets while in the town.\r\n           And take good heed of wisdom and renown,\r\n         That by no wanton laughing thou do no offence,\r\n         Before thy sovereign, while he is in presence.\r\n\r\n       Pare clean thy nails, and wash thy hands also,\r\n         Before thy meat and when thou dost arise;\r\n       Sit in that place thou art assignéd to,\r\n         Press not too high in any manner wise.\r\n         And when thy dinner served before thee lies,\r\n       Be not too hasty upon thy bread to bite,\r\n       Lest men of greediness should thee indict.[72]\r\n\r\n       Grinning and mowing[73] at the table eschew;\r\n         Cry not too loud; honestly keep silence.\r\n       To stuff thy jaws with bread it is not due,\r\n         With full mouth speak not, lest thou do offence.\r\n         Drink not with bridle[74] for haste or negligence\r\n       Keep clean thy lips from fat of flesh or fish;\r\n       Wipe fair thy spoon, nor leave it in thy dish.\r\n\r\n       Of bitten bread with thy teeth no sops think thou to make;\r\n         Loud for to sup gainsays all gentleness.\r\n       With mouth imbrued[75] thy cup thou must not take,\r\n         In ale, in wine, with hand leave no fatnéss;\r\n         Nor foul the napery through recklessness.\r\n       Beware that at the meat thou begin no strife.\r\n       Thy teeth at table pick not with no knife.\r\n\r\n       Of honest mirth let be thy dalliance,\r\n         Swear no oaths and speak no ribaldry;\r\n       The best morsels—have this in remembrance—\r\n         Wholly thyself to take do not apply.\r\n         Part with thy fellows, for that is courtesy.\r\n       Heap not thy trencher high with many morséls,\r\n       And from blackness alway keep thy nails.\r\n\r\n       Of courtesy it is against the law\r\n         With rudeness, son, to make cause of offence;\r\n       Of old forfeits[76] upbraid not thy fellow;\r\n         Toward thy sovereign do reverence.\r\n         Play with no knife—take heed to my sentence.\r\n       At meat and at supper keep thee still and soft;\r\n       Eke to and fro move not thy feet too oft.\r\n\r\n       Drop not thy breast with stew[77] and other pottáge,\r\n         Bring no unscoured knives unto the table;\r\n       Fill not thy spoon lest in the carriáge\r\n         It spill aside, which were not commendáble.\r\n         Be quick and ready, meek and serviceáble,\r\n       Well awaiting to fulfil anon\r\n       What that thy sovereign commandeth to be done.\r\n\r\n          And wheresoever thou be to dine or sup,\r\n            Of gentleness, take salt with thy knife.\r\n          And be well aware thou blow not in the cup.\r\n            Reverence thy fellows, begin with them no strife.\r\n            To thy power keep peace all thy life.\r\n          Interrupt no man, whereso that thou wend,\r\n          No man in his tale, till he have made an end.\r\n\r\n          With thy fingers mark thou not thy tale.\r\n            Be well advised, and namely, in tender age,\r\n          To drink measurably both wine and ale.\r\n            Be not too copious of thy languáge.\r\n            As time requireth, show not thy viságe\r\n          Too glad nor sorry, but keep thee even between,\r\n          For loss, or lucre, or any case suddén.\r\n\r\n          Be soft[78] in measure, not hasty but tractáble;\r\n            Over-soft is nought, in no manner thing.\r\n          To children belongeth not to be vengeáble,[79]\r\n            Soon movéd and full soon again fighting;[80]\r\n            And as it is remembered by writing:\r\n          Wrath of children is soon overgone;\r\n          With the parts of an apple they be made at one.[81]\r\n\r\n          In children war is now mirth and now debate;\r\n            In their quarrel is no great violence;\r\n          Now play, now weeping, and seldom in one estate,\r\n            To their complaints give never any credénce.\r\n            A rod reformeth all their negligence.\r\n          In their courage[82] no rancour doth abide.\r\n          Who that spareth the rod all virtues sets aside.\r\n\r\n          Ah, little ballad, void of eloquence,[83]\r\n            I pray young children that thee shall see and read,\r\n          Though thou be copious of sentence,\r\n            Yet to thy clauses for to take heed,\r\n            Which into all virtue shall their youth lead.\r\n          In this writing, though there be no date,\r\n            If aught be amiss in word, syllable or deed,\r\n          I submit me to correction without any debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HOW THE GOOD WIFE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE good wife taught her daughter,\r\n                    Full many a time and oft,\r\n                 A full good woman to be;\r\n               For said she: “Daughter to me dear,\r\n               Something good now must thou hear,\r\n                 If thou wilt prosper thee.\r\n\r\n               Daughter, if thou wilt be a wife,\r\n                 Look wisely that thou work;\r\n               Look lovely and in good life,\r\n                 Love God and Holy Kirk.[84]\r\n               Go to church whene’er thou may,\r\n                 Look thou spare for no rain,\r\n               For best thou farest on that day;\r\n                   To commune with God be fain.\r\n                       He must needs well thrive,\r\n                       That liveth well all his life,[85]\r\n                             My lief[86] child.\r\n\r\n         Gladly give thy tithes and thy offerings both,\r\n         To the poor and the bed-rid—look thou be not loth.\r\n         Give of thine own goods and be not too hard,\r\n         For seldom is the house poor where God is stewárd.\r\n               Well is he provéd\r\n               Who the poor hath lovéd,\r\n                       My lief child.\r\n\r\n         When thou sittest in the church, o’er thy beads bend;\r\n         Make thou no jangling with gossip or with friend.\r\n         Laugh thou to scorn neither old body nor young,\r\n         But be of fair bearing and of good tongue.\r\n               Through thy fair bearing\r\n               Thy worship hath increasing,\r\n                       My lief child.\r\n\r\n         If any man offer thee courtship, and would marry thee,\r\n         Look that thou scorn him not, whatsoever he be;[87]\r\n         But show it to thy friends and conceal it naught.\r\n         Sit not by him nor stand where sin might be wrought,\r\n               For a slander raised of ill\r\n               Is evil for to still,\r\n                       My lief child.\r\n\r\n    The man that shall thee wed before God with a ring,\r\n    Love thou him and honour most of earthly thing.\r\n    Meekly thou him answer and not as an atterling,[88]\r\n    So may’st thou slake his mood,[89] and be his dear darling.\r\n          A fair word and a meek\r\n          Doth anger slake,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Fair of speech shalt thou be, glad and of mild mood,\r\n    True in word and in deed, and in conscience good.\r\n    Keep thee from sin, from villainy and from blame;\r\n    And look thou bear thee so that none say of thee shame,\r\n          For he that in good life hath run,\r\n          Full oft his weal hath won,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Be of seemly semblance, wise, and other good cheer;\r\n    Change not thy countenance for aught that thou may hear.\r\n    Fare not as a gig,[90] for nought that may betide.\r\n    Laugh thou not too loud nor yawn thou not too wide.\r\n          But laugh thou soft and mild,\r\n          And be not of cheer too wild,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And when thou goest on thy way, go thou not too fast,\r\n    Brandish not with thy head, nor with thy shoulders cast,[91]\r\n    Have not too many words, from swearing keep aloof,\r\n    For all such manners come to an evil proof.\r\n          For he that catcheth to him an evil name,\r\n          It is to him a foul fame,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Go thou not into the town, as it were agaze,[92]\r\n    From one house to another, for to seek the maze;[93]\r\n    Nor to sell thy russet,[94] to the market shalt thou go,\r\n    And then to the tavern to bring thy credit low.\r\n          For they that taverns haunt\r\n          From thrift soon come to want,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thou be in any place where good ale is aloft,[95]\r\n    Whether that thou serve thereof or that thou sit soft,\r\n    Measurably thou take thereof, that thou fall in no blame,\r\n    For if thou be often drunk, it falleth to thy shame.\r\n            For those that be often drunk—\r\n            Thrift is from them sunk,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Go not to the wrestling or shooting at the cock,[96]\r\n    As it were a strumpet or a gigggelot[97];\r\n    Dwell at home, daughter, and love thy work much,\r\n    And so thou shalt, my lief child, wax the sooner rich.\r\n          A merry thing ’tis evermore,\r\n          A man to be served of his own store,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Acquaint thee not with each man that goeth by the street,\r\n    Though any man speak to thee, swiftly[98] thou him greet;\r\n    By him do not stand, but let him his way depart,\r\n    Lest he by his villainy should tempt thy heart.\r\n          For all men be not true\r\n          That fair words can shew,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Also, for covetousness gifts beware to take;\r\n    Unless thou know why else,[99] quickly them forsake;\r\n    For with gifts may men soon women overcome,\r\n    Though they were as true as steel or as stone.\r\n          Bound forsooth is she\r\n          That of any man takes fee,[100]\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And wisely govern thy house, and serving maids and men,\r\n    Be thou not too bitter or too debonaire with them;\r\n    But look well what most needs to be done,\r\n    And set thy people at it, both rathely[101] and soon.\r\n          For ready is at need\r\n          A foredone[102] deed,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thy husband be from home, let not thy folk do ill,\r\n    But look who doeth well and who doeth nil;\r\n    And he that doeth well, quit him well his while,\r\n    But he that doeth other, serve him as the vile.\r\n          A foredone deed\r\n          Will another speed,[103]\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thy time be strait and great be thy need,\r\n    Then like a housewife set to work with speed;\r\n    Then will they all do better that about thee stand,\r\n    For work is sooner done that hath full many a hand.\r\n          For many a hand and wight\r\n          Makes a heavy work light;\r\n          And after thy good service,\r\n          Thy name shall arise,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Whate’er thy household doth, about them must thou wend,\r\n    And as much as thou mayest, be at that one end,\r\n    If thou find any fault, make them soon amend,\r\n    As they have time and space, and may them defend.\r\n          To compel a deed be done, if there be no space,\r\n          It is but tyranny, without temperance and grace,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And look that all things be well when they their work forsake,\r\n    Forget thou not the keys into thy ward to take\r\n    And beware to whom thou trustest, and for no fancy spare,\r\n    For much harm hath fallen to them that be not ’ware.\r\n        But, daughter, look thou be wise, and do as I thee teach,\r\n        And trust none better than thyself, for no fair speech,\r\n              My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And give your household their hire at their term-day,[104]\r\n    Whether they dwell still with thee, or they wend away.\r\n    Do well by them of the goods thou hast in hold,\r\n    And then shall they say well of thee, both the young and old.\r\n          Thy good name to thy friends\r\n          Great joy and gladness lends,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thy neighbour’s wife hath on rich attire,\r\n    Therefore mock not, nor let scorn burn thee as a fire.\r\n    But thank thou God in heaven for what He may thee give,\r\n    And so shalt thou, my daughter dear, a good life live,\r\n          He hath ease in his power,\r\n          Who thanks the Lord every hour,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Housewifely thou shalt go on the working day,\r\n    For pride, rest, and idleness take thrift away;\r\n    But when the Holy Day is come, well clothéd shalt thou be,\r\n    The Holy Day to honour, and God will cherish thee.\r\n          Have in mind to worship God alway,\r\n          For much pride comes of the evil day,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    When thou art a wife, a neighbour for to be,\r\n    Love then well thy neighbours as God hath commanded thee.\r\n    It behoveth thee so for to do,\r\n    And to do to them as thou would’st be done to.\r\n          If any discord happen, night or day,\r\n          Make it no worse, mend it if thou may,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thou art a rich wife, be not then too hard,\r\n    But welcome fair thy neighbours that come to-thee-ward\r\n    With meat, drink, and honest cheer, such as thou mayest bid,[105]\r\n    To each man after his degree, and help the poor at need.\r\n          And also for hap that may betide,\r\n          Please well thy neighbours that dwell thee beside,\r\n                  My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Daughter, look that thou beware, whatsoever thee betide,\r\n    Make not thy husband poor with spending or with pride.\r\n    A man must spend as he may that hath but easy good,[106]\r\n    For as a wren hath veins, men must let her blood.[107]\r\n          His thrift waxeth thin\r\n          That spendeth ere he win,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Borrow not too busily, nor take thine hire first,\r\n    This may make the more need, and end by being worst.\r\n    Nor make thee not to seem rich with other men’s store,\r\n    Therefore spend thou never a farthing more.\r\n          For though thou borrow fast,\r\n          It must home again at last,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And if thy children be rebel and will not bow them low,\r\n    If any of them misdo, neither curse them nor blow;[108]\r\n    But take a smart rod and beat them in a row,\r\n    Till they cry mercy and their guilt well know.\r\n          Dear child, by this lore\r\n          They will love thee ever more,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    And look to thy daughters that none of them be lorn;\r\n    From the very time that they are of thee born,\r\n    Busy thyself and gather fast for their marriage,\r\n    And give them to spousing as soon as they be of age.\r\n          Maidens be fair and amiable,\r\n          But in their love full unstable,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Now have I taught thee, daughter, as my mother did me;\r\n    Think thereon night and day, that forgotten it not be.\r\n    Have measure and lowness, as I have thee taught,\r\n    Then whatever man shall wed thee will regret it naught.\r\n          Better you were a child unbore\r\n          Than untaught in this wise lore,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    Now thrift and speed be thine, my sweet bairn [near or far]!\r\n    Of all our former fathers that ever were or are,\r\n    Of all patriarchs and prophets that ever were alive,—\r\n    Their blessing may’st thou have, and well may’st thou thrive!\r\n          For well it is with that child\r\n          That with sin is not defiled,\r\n                My lief child.\r\n\r\n    The blessing of God may’st thou have, and of His mother bright,\r\n    Of all angels and archangels and every holy wight![109]\r\n    And may’st thou have grace to wend thy way full right,\r\n    To the bliss of heaven, where God sits in His might!”\r\n                                                                Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOW THE WISE MAN TAUGHT HIS SON\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTEN, lordlings, and ye shall hear how the wise man taught his son.\r\nTake good heed to this matter and learn it if ye can, for this song was\r\nmade with good intent to make men true and steadfast, and a thing well\r\nbegun makes often a good ending.\r\n\r\nThere was a wise man taught his son while he was yet a child of tender\r\nyears, meek and fair to look upon, very eager for learning and with a\r\ngreat desire to all goodness; and his father taught him well and featly\r\nby good example and fair words.\r\n\r\nHe said: “My son, take good heed every morning, ere ye do worldly thing,\r\nlift up your heart to God, and pray as devoutly as you can for grace to\r\nlead a good life, and to escape sin both night and day, and that\r\nheaven’s bliss may be your meed.\r\n\r\n“And, my son, wherever you go, be not full of tales; beware what you\r\nsay, for your own tongue may be your foe. If you say aught, take good\r\nheed where and to whom, for a word spoken to-day may be repented seven\r\nyears after.\r\n\r\n“And, son, whatever manner of man ye be, give yourself not to idleness,\r\nbut busy yourself every day according to your estate. Beware of rest and\r\nease, which things nourish sloth. Ever to be busy, more or less, is a\r\nfull good sign of honesty.[110]\r\n\r\n“And, son, I warn you also not to desire to bear office, for then can it\r\nbe no other than that you must either displease and hurt your\r\nneighbours, or else forswear yourself and not do as your office demands;\r\nand get yourself, _maugré_,[111] here and there, an hundredfold more\r\nthan thanks.\r\n\r\n“And, son, as far as you may, go on no evil quests, nor bear false\r\nwitness in any man’s matter. It were better for you to be deaf and dumb\r\nthan to enter wrongfully into a quest. Think, son, on the dreadful doom\r\nthat God shall deem[112] us at the last!\r\n\r\n“And, son, of another thing I warn you, on my blessing take good heed of\r\ntavern-haunting, and of the dice, and flee all lechery, lest you come to\r\nan evil end, for it will lead astray all your wits and bring you into\r\ngreat mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n“And, son, sit not up too long at even, or have late suppers, though ye\r\nbe strong and hale, for with such outrage your health shall worsen. And\r\nof late walking comes debate,[113] and of sitting and drinking out of\r\ntime, therefore beware and go to bed betimes and wink.\r\n\r\n“And, son, if ye would have a wife, take her not for her money, but\r\ninquire wisely of all her life, and give good heed that she be meek,\r\ncourteous and prudent, even though she be poor; and such an one will do\r\nyou more good service in time of need, than a richer.\r\n\r\n“And if your wife be meek and good, and serve you well and pleasantly,\r\nlook ye be not so mad as to charge her too grievously, but rule her with\r\na fair hand and easy, and cherish her for her good deeds. For a thing\r\nunskilfully overdone makes needless grief to grow, and it is better to\r\nhave a meal’s meat of homely fare with peace and quiet, than an hundred\r\ndishes with grudging and much care. And therefore learn this well that\r\nif you want a wife to your ease, take her never the more for the riches\r\nshe may have, though she might endow you with lands.\r\n\r\n“And ye shall not displease your wife, nor call her by no villainous\r\nnames, for it is a shame to you to miscall a woman; and in so doing, ye\r\nare not wise, for if ye defame your own wife, no wonder that another\r\nshould do so! Soft and fair will tame alike hart and hind, buck and doe.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, be not too hasty to fight or chide, if thy wife come\r\nto you at any time with complaint of man or child; and be not avenged\r\ntill you know the truth, for you might make a stir in the dark, and\r\nafterwards it should rue you both.\r\n\r\n“And, son, if you be well at ease, and sit warm among your neighbours,\r\ndo not get new-fangled ideas, or be hasty to change, or to flit;[114]\r\nfor if ye do, ye lack wit and are unstable, and men will speak of it and\r\nsay: ‘This fool can bide nowhere!’\r\n\r\n“And, son, the more goods you have, the rather bear you meekly, and be\r\nhumble, and boast not overmuch; it is wasted, for by their boasting men\r\nknow fools.\r\n\r\n“And look you pay well what you owe, and set no great store by other\r\nriches, for death takes both high and low, and then—farewell, all that\r\nthere is! And therefore do by my counsel, and take example from other\r\nmen, how little their goods avail them when they be dolven[115] in their\r\ndens;[116] and one that was not of his kin hath his wife, and all that\r\nthere is.[117]\r\n\r\n“Son, keep you from deadly sin, and assay to enter Paradise. Make amends\r\nfor your trespasses and deal out of your goods to poor men, make friends\r\nof your foes, and strive to gain salvation for your soul, for the world\r\nis false and frail, and every day doth worsen. Son, set nought by this\r\nworld’s weal, for it fares as a ripe cherry. And death is ever, I trow,\r\nthe most certain thing that is; and nothing is so uncertain as to know\r\nthe time thereof. Therefore, my son, think on this, on all that I have\r\nsaid, and may Jesus, who for us bare the crown of thorns, bring us to\r\nHis bliss.”\r\n\r\n                                                                   AMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     JOHN RUSSELL’S BOOK OF NURTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n“IN nomine Patris, God keep me, et Filii, for charity, Et Spiritus\r\nSancti, where that I go by land or else by sea!\r\n\r\nAn usher I am ye may behold to a prince of high degree, That enjoys to\r\ninform and teach all those that would thrive in prosperity.”\r\n\r\nShould I meet with any man who either through inexperience or through\r\nnegligence knows naught of such things as I shall hereafter diligently\r\nshow, for my conscience’ sake I will instruct him; for methinks it is\r\ncharitable to teach virtue and good manners, in which most youths are\r\nbarren and dull. But if there be any who can nothing good and are not\r\nwilling to learn, give them a bauble to play with, for they will never\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n     ────────────────\r\n\r\n    “As I rose out of my bed, in a merry season of May,\r\n    To sport me in a forest, where sights were fresh and gay,\r\n    I met with the forester; I prayed him to say me not nay,\r\n    That in his woodland I might walk among the deer away.\r\n    As I wandered at will, in the wood that was so green,\r\n    There lay three herds of deer, a seemly sight, I ween.\r\n    I beheld on my right hand the sun that shone so sheen;\r\n    I saw where walked a seemly young man, that slender was and lean.\r\n    His bow he took in hand toward the deer to stalk,\r\n    I prayed him his shot to leave and softly with me to walk.”\r\n\r\n     ────────────────\r\n\r\nThereupon the young man was glad and loved to talk with me; but when I\r\ninquired whom he served, he said: “God help me, sir, I serve myself and\r\nelse no other man.”\r\n\r\n“Is thy governance good[118]?” I said. “My son, tell me if thou wilt.”\r\n\r\n“I would I were out of this world,” said he; “I reck not how soon when!”\r\n\r\n“Say not so, good son, beware! Methinks you mean amiss for God forbids\r\nwanhope,[119] which is a horrible sin. Therefore, good son, open your\r\nheart to me, peradventure I can relieve you. Remember that when\r\nbale[120] is highest, boot[121] is nighest.”\r\n\r\n“In truth, sir, I have sought far and near in many a wildsome way to get\r\nme a master. But because I knew nothing good, and showed this wherever I\r\nwent, every man denied me; day by day, wanton[122] and over-nice,\r\nreckless, lewd and chattering like a jay, every man refused me.”\r\n\r\n“Now, good son, if I will teach, will you learn? Will you be a\r\nserving-man, a ploughman, a labourer, a courtier, a clerk, a merchant, a\r\nmason or an artificer, a chamberlain, a butler, a panter or a carver?”\r\n\r\n“Teach me, sir, the duties of a butler, a panter or a chamberlain, and\r\nespecially, the cunning of a carver. If you will make me to know all\r\nthese, I will pray for your soul that it come never in pain!”\r\n\r\n“Son, I will teach you with right good will, so as you will love and\r\nfear God as is right and proper, be true to your master, and not waste\r\nhis goods, but love and fear him, and duly fulfil his commandments.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Duties of a Panter or Butler_\r\n\r\n“The first year, my son, you shall be panter or butler. In the pantry,\r\nyou must always keep three sharp knives, one to chop the loaves, another\r\nto pare them, and a third, sharp and keen, to smooth and square the\r\ntrenchers with.[123]\r\n\r\n“Always cut your lord’s bread, and see that it be new; and all other\r\nbread at the table one day old ere you cut it, all household bread three\r\ndays old, and trencher-bread four days old.\r\n\r\n“Look that your salt be fine, white, fair, and dry; and have your\r\nsalt-plane of ivory, two inches wide and three long; and see to it that\r\nthe lid of the salt-cellar touch not the salt.\r\n\r\n“Good son, look that your napery be sweet and clean, and that your\r\ntable-cloth, towel, and napkin be folded neatly, your table-knives\r\nbrightly polished and your spoons fair washed—ye wot well what I mean.\r\n\r\n“Look ye have two wine-augers, a greater and a less, some gutters of\r\nboxwood that fit them, also a gimlet to pierce with, a tap and a bung,\r\nready to stop the flow when it is time. So when you broach a pipe, good\r\nson, do after my teaching: pierce or bore with an auger or gimlet,\r\nslanting upward, four fingers’ breadth from the lower rim, so as not to\r\ncause the lees to rise—I warn you especially.”\r\n\r\n[Here follows a list of fruits and preserves, which presently becomes a\r\nmere dietary, ll. 73-108.]\r\n\r\n“Take good heed to the wines, red, white, and sweet; look to them every\r\nnight with a candle, to see that they neither ferment nor leak. Never\r\nforget to wash the heads of the pipes with cold water every night; and\r\nalways carry a gimlet, adze and linen clouts,[124] large and small. If\r\nthe wine ferment, ye shall know by its singing, so keep at hand a pipe\r\nof _couleur de rose_,[125] that has been spent in drinking and add to\r\nthe fermentation the dregs of this, and it shall be amended. If sweet\r\nwine be sick or pallid, put in a Romney to improve it.”\r\n\r\n[Then follows a list of the sweet wines, and a long recipe for\r\n_Hippocras_, ll. 117-176.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _The Buttery_\r\n\r\n“See that your cups and pots be clean, both within and without. Serve no\r\nale till it is five days old, for new ale is wasteful.[125] And look\r\nthat all things about you be sweet and clean.\r\n\r\n“Be fair of answer, ready to serve, and gentle of cheer, and then men\r\nwill say; ‘There goes a gentle officer.’\r\n\r\n“Beware that ye give no person stale drink, for fear that ye bring many\r\na man into disease for many a year.[125]\r\n\r\n“My son, it is now the time of day to lay the table. First, wipe it with\r\na cloth ere it be spread, then lay on it a cloth called a _cowche_.[125]\r\nYou take one end and your mate the other, and draw it straight; and lay\r\na second cloth with its fold on the outer edge of the table.[126] Lift\r\nthe upper part and let it hang even. And then lay the third cloth with\r\nits fold on the inner edge, making a _state_[126] half a foot wide, with\r\nthe top. Cover your ewery-cupboard[127] with a diapered-towel, and put a\r\ntowel round your neck,[126] for that is courtesy, and put one end of it\r\nmannerly over your left arm; and on the same arm place your lord’s\r\nnapkin, and on it lay eight loaves of bread, with three or four\r\ntrencher-loaves. Take one end of the towel in your left hand, as the\r\nmanner is, together with the salt-cellar—look you do this—and take the\r\nother end of the towel in your right hand with the spoons and knives.\r\n\r\n“Set the salt on your lord’s right hand, and to the left of your salt,\r\none or two trenchers, and to the left again, your knife by itself and\r\nplain to see, and the white rolls, and beside them a spoon upon a fair\r\nfolded napkin. Cover your spoon, napkin, trencher and knife, so that\r\nthey cannot be seen; and at the other end of the table place a salt with\r\ntwo trenchers.\r\n\r\n“If you wish to wrap up your lord’s bread in a stately fashion, first\r\nsquare off the bread sharply and evenly, and see that no bun or loaf be\r\nlarger in proportion to the others, and so shall ye be able to wrap it\r\nup mannerly for your master. Take a towel of Rennes cloth,[128] two and\r\na half yards long, fold it lengthwise[128] and lay it on the table. Roll\r\nup a handful from each end tightly and stiffly, then in the middle of\r\nthe towel place eight loaves or buns, bottom to bottom, and then wrap\r\nthem wisely and skilfully. To tell you more plainly for your\r\ninformation: take the ends of the towel that lies on the bread, draw\r\nthem out and twist tightly a handful nearest the bread and smooth the\r\nwrapper stiffly. When it is ready, you must open one end all in a moment\r\nbefore your lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen your sovereign’s table is dressed in this array, place salts on all\r\nthe other tables, and lay trenchers and cups; and then set out your\r\ncupboard with gay silver and silver-gilt, and your ewery board with\r\nbasins and ewers, and hot and cold water, each to temper the other. Look\r\nthat you have ever enough napkins, spoons and cups for your lord’s\r\ntable; also, for your own dignity, that your pots for ale and wine be as\r\nclean as possible, and beware ever of flies and motes, for your own\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n“With lowly courtesy, make the surnape[129] with a cloth under a double\r\nof fair napery; fold the two ends of the towel to the outer edge of the\r\ncloth, and so hold the three ends together; then fold them all so that\r\nthere is a pleat at about a foot’s distance, and lay it fair and smooth\r\nfor your lord to wash after meat, if he will. At the right side of the\r\ntable, you must guide it along, and the marshal must slip it further—the\r\nright side up of all three cloths—and let it be drawn straight and even,\r\nboth in length and breadth; then raise the upper part of the towel and\r\nlay it without wrinkling straight to the other side so that half a yard\r\nor an ell hangs down at each end, where the sewer[129] may make a\r\n_state_, and so please his master. When your lord has washed, you must\r\ntake up the surnape with your two arms, and carry it back to the ewery\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n“Carry a towel about your neck when serving your lord, bow to him,\r\nuncover your bread and set it by the salt. Look that all have knives,\r\nspoons and napkins, and always when you pass your lord, see that you bow\r\nyour knees.\r\n\r\n“Go forth to the _port-payne_[130] and there take eight loaves, and put\r\nfour at each end of the table, and be sure that each person has a spoon\r\nand a napkin.\r\n\r\n“Watch the sewer to see how many pottages he covers, and do ye for as\r\nmany, and serve each according to his degree; and see that none lack\r\nbread, ale or wine.\r\n\r\n“Be glad of cheer, courteous of knee, soft of speech; have clean hands\r\nand nails and be carefully dressed.\r\n\r\n“Do not cough or spit or retch too loud, or put your fingers into the\r\ncups to seek bits of dust.\r\n\r\n“Have an eye to all grumbling and fault-finding, and prevent backbiting\r\nof their fellows among the lords at meat, by serving all with bread, ale\r\nand wine; and so shall ye have of all men good love and praise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Simple Conditions_\r\n\r\n“I will that ye eschew forever the ‘simple conditions’ of a person that\r\nis not taught.\r\n\r\n“Do not claw your head or your back as if you were after a flea, or\r\nstroke your hair as if you sought a louse.\r\n\r\n“Be not glum,[131] nor twinkle with your eyes, nor be heavy of cheer;\r\nand keep your eyes free from winking and watering.[132]\r\n\r\n“Do not pick your nose or let it drop clear pearls, or sniff, or blow it\r\ntoo loud, lest your lord hear.\r\n\r\n“Twist not your neck askew like a jackdaw; wring not your hands with\r\npicking or trifling or shrugging, as if ye would saw [wood]; nor puff up\r\nyour chest, nor pick your ears, nor be slow of hearing.\r\n\r\n“Retch not, nor spit too far, nor laugh or speak too loud. Beware of\r\nmaking faces and scorning; and be no liar with your mouth. Nor yet lick\r\nyour lips or drivel.\r\n\r\n“Do not have the habit of squirting or spouting with your mouth, or\r\ngape, or yawn, or pout. And do not lick a dish with your tongue to get\r\nout dust.\r\n\r\n“Be not rash or reckless—that is not worth a clout.\r\n\r\n“Do not sigh with your breast, or cough, or breathe hard in the presence\r\nof your sovereign, or hiccough, or belch, or groan never the more. Do\r\nnot trample with your feet, or straddle your legs, or scratch your\r\nbody—there is no sense in showing off. Good son, do not pick your teeth,\r\nor grind, or gnash them, or with puffing and blowing cast foul breath\r\nupon your lord.... These gallants in their short coats—that is ungoodly\r\nguise. Other faults on this matter, I spare not to disapprove in my\r\nopinion, when [a servant] is waiting on his master at table. Every sober\r\nsovereign must despise all such things.\r\n\r\n“A man might find many more conditions than are named here; but let\r\nevery honest servant avoid them for his own credit.\r\n\r\n“Panter, yeoman of the cellar, butler and ewerer, I will that ye obey\r\nthe marshal, sewer and carver.”\r\n\r\n“Good sir, I pray you teach me the skill of carving, and the fair\r\nhandling of a knife, and all the ways that I shall break open, unlace\r\nand penetrate all manner of fowl, flesh and fish—how I shall demean me\r\nwith each.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         [_Office of a Carver_]\r\n\r\n“My son, thy knife must be clean and bright; and it beseems thee to have\r\nthy hands fair washed. Hold always thy knife surely, so as not to hurt\r\nthyself, and have not more than two fingers and the thumb on thy keen\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n“Midway in thy hand, set the end of thy haft firmly; and unlace and\r\nmince with the thumb and two fingers only. In cutting and placing bread,\r\nand voiding of crumbs and trencher, look you have skill with two fingers\r\nand the thumb. Likewise, never use more for fish, flesh, beast or\r\nfowl—that is courtesy.\r\n\r\n“Touch no manner of meat with thy right hand, but with thy left, as is\r\nproper. Always with thy left hand grasp the loaf with all thy might; and\r\nhold thy knife firmly, as I have instructed thee. Ye do not right to\r\nsoil your table, nor to wipe your knives on that, but on your napkin.\r\n\r\n“First take a loaf of trenchers in your left hand, then your\r\ntable-knife, as I have said before; and with its edge raising your\r\ntrencher up by you as near the point as you may, lay it before your\r\nlord. Right so set four trenchers, one by another, four square, and upon\r\nthem a single trencher alone. And take your loaf of light bread, as I\r\nhave told you, and cut with the edge of the knife near your hand; first\r\npare the quarters of the loaf round all about, and cut the upper\r\ncrust[133] for your lord, and bow to him; and suffer the other part to\r\nremain still at the bottom, and so nigh spent out,[134] and lay him of\r\nthe crumbs a quarter of the loaf.\r\n\r\n“Touch not the loaf after it is so trimmed; put it on a platter or on\r\nthe beforenamed alms-dish. Make clean your board that ye be not blamed;\r\nand so shall the sewer serve his lord, and neither of you be vexed.”\r\n\r\n[Here follows a list of _Fumosities_, indigestibilities, as Dr.\r\nFurnivall calls them, ll. 349-68. The young man then says:]\r\n\r\n         “Now fair befal you, father, and well may ye [a]chieve\r\n         For these points by practice I hope full well to prove;\r\n         And yet shall I pray for you daily while that I live,\r\n         Both for body and soul that God you guide from grief.”\r\n\r\n[He then begs to be taught the art of “carving of fish and flesh[133]\r\nafter the cook’s care,” and receives detailed instructions for every\r\nsort of food, roasted, baked and fried, for the serving of soups, making\r\nof sauces and carving of fish, ll. 377-649. He then says:]\r\n\r\n  “Now, father, fair fall ye, and Christ you have in cure,\r\n  For of the nurture of carving, I suppose that I be sure.\r\n  But yet another office there is, save I dare not endure\r\n  To ask you any further, for fear of displeasure.\r\n  For to be a sewer I would I had the cunning,\r\n  Then durst I do my devoir[135] with any worshipful to be woning;[136]\r\n  Since that I know the course and the craft of carving,\r\n  I would see the sight of a sewer, what way he showeth in serving.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Office of a Sewer_\r\n\r\n“Now since, my son, you wish to learn this science, dread nothing of\r\ngreat difficulty; I will gladly teach you, if you will but listen.\r\n\r\n“Take heed when the worshipful head of any household has washed before\r\nmeat and begins to say grace, then hie you to the kitchen where the\r\nservants must attend and take your orders. First ask the panter or\r\nofficer of the spicery for fruits, such as butter, plums, damsons,\r\ngrapes and cherries, which are served before dinner according to the\r\nseason to make men merry, and ask if any such are to be served that day.\r\nThen commune with the cook and surveyor[137] as to what meats and how\r\nmany dishes are prepared. When they two have agreed with you, then must\r\nthe cook dress up all dishes to the surveying-board,[138] and the\r\nsurveyor must soberly and without turmoil deliver up the dishes to you,\r\nthat you may convey them to your lord. When you are at the board of\r\nservice, see that you have courtly and skilful officers to prevent any\r\ndish being stolen, which might easily cause a scandal to arise in your\r\nservice as sewer. See that you have proper servants to carry the dishes,\r\nmarshals, squires and serjeants-at-arms, if they be there, to bring the\r\ndishes without delay or injury from the kitchen, and you need not fear\r\nto set them on the table yourself.”[139]\r\n\r\n[Then follow various menus, ll. 686-858. The young man answers:]\r\n\r\n     “Now fair fall you, father, in faith, I am full fain;\r\n      For lovesomely ye have taught me this nurture again.\r\n      Pleaseth it you to certify me with one word or twain,\r\n      The courtesy to conceive conveniently for every chamberlain?”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Office of a Chamberlain_\r\n\r\n“The duty of a chamberlain is to be diligent in office, neatly clad, his\r\nclothes not torn, hands and face well washed and head well kempt.\r\n\r\n“He must be ever careful—not negligent—of fire and candle. And look\r\nyou[140] give diligent attendance to your master, be courteous, glad of\r\ncheer, quick of hearing in every way, and be ever on the lookout for\r\nthings to do him pleasure; if you will acquire these qualities, it may\r\nadvance you well.\r\n\r\n“See that your lord has a clean shirt and hose, a short coat,[141] a\r\ndoublet, and a long coat, if he wear such, his hose well brushed, his\r\nsocks at hand, his shoes or slippers as brown as a water-leech.[140]\r\n\r\n“In the morning, against your lord shall rise, take care that his linen\r\nbe clean, and warm it at a clear fire, not smoky, if [the weather] be\r\ncold or freezing.\r\n\r\n“When he rises make ready the foot-sheet, and forget not to place a\r\nchair or some other seat with a cushion on it before the fire, with\r\nanother cushion for the feet. Over the cushion and chair spread this\r\nsheet so as to cover them; and see that you have a kerchief and a comb\r\nto comb your lord’s head before he is fully dressed.\r\n\r\n“Then pray your lord in humble words to come to a good fire and array\r\nhim thereby, and there to sit or stand pleasantly; and wait with due\r\nmanners to assist him. First hold out to him his tunic, then his doublet\r\nwhile he puts in his arms, and have his stomacher well aired to keep off\r\nharm, as also his vamps[142] and socks, and so shall he go warm all day.\r\n\r\n“Then draw on his socks and his hose by the fire, and lace or buckle his\r\nshoes, draw his hosen on well and truss them up to the height that suits\r\nhim, lace his doublet in every hole, and put round his neck and on his\r\nshoulders a kerchief; and then gently comb his head with an ivory comb,\r\nand give him water wherewith to wash his hands and face.\r\n\r\n“Then kneel down on your knee and say thus: ‘Sir, what robe or gown doth\r\nit please you to wear to-day?’ Then get him such as he asks for, and\r\nhold it out for him to put on, and do on his girdle, if he wear one,\r\ntight or loose, arrange his robe in the proper fashion, give him a hood\r\nor hat for his head, a cloak or _cappe-de-huse_,[143] according as it be\r\nfair or foul, or all misty with rain; and so shall ye please him. Before\r\nhe goes out, brush busily about him, and whether he wear satin,\r\nsendal,[144] velvet, scarlet[145] or grain,[146] see that all be clean\r\nand nice.\r\n\r\n“If he be prince or prelate or other potentate, before he go to church\r\nsee that all things for the pew be made ready, and forget not cushion,\r\ncarpet, curtain, beads or book.\r\n\r\n“Then return in haste to your lord’s chamber, strip the clothes off the\r\nbed and cast them aside, and beat the feather-bed, but not so as to\r\nwaste any feathers, and see that the blankets and sheets be clean. When\r\nyou have made the bed mannerly, cover it with a coverlet, spread out the\r\nbench-covers,[147] and cushions, set up the head-sheet[148] and pillow,\r\nand remove the basin. See that carpets[149] be laid round the bed and\r\ndress the windows, and the cupboard with carpets[149] and cushions. See\r\nthere be a good fire conveyed into the chamber, with plenty of wood and\r\nfuel to make it up....\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “_The Wardrobe_\r\n\r\n“You must attend busily to your lord’s wardrobe, to keep the clothes\r\nwell, and to brush them cleanly. Use a soft brush, and remember that\r\novermuch brushing easily wears out cloth.\r\n\r\n“Never let woollen clothes or furs go a sevennight without being brushed\r\nor shaken, for moths be always ready to alight in them and engender; so\r\nalways keep an eye on drapery and skinnery.\r\n\r\n“If your lord take a nap after his meal to digest his stomach, have\r\nready kerchief and comb, pillow and head-sheet; yet be not far from\r\nhim—take heed what I say—for much sleep is not good in the middle of the\r\nday, and have ready water and towel so that he may wash after his sleep.\r\n\r\n“When he has supped and goes to his chamber, spread forth your\r\nfoot-sheet, as I have already shown you, take off his gown or whatever\r\ngarment by the license of his estate he wears,[150] and lay it up in\r\nsuch place as ye best know. Put a mantle on his back to keep his body\r\nfrom cold, set him on the foot-sheet, made ready as I have directed, and\r\npull off his shoes, socks and hosen, and throw these last over your\r\nshoulder, or hold them on your arm. Comb his hair, but first kneel down,\r\nand put on his kerchief and nightcap wound[150] in seemly fashion. Have\r\nthe bed, head-sheet and pillow ready; and when he is in bed, there to\r\nsleep safe and sound, draw the curtains round about the bed, set there\r\nhis night-light with wax or Paris-candle,[150] and see that there is\r\nenough to last the night, drive out the dog and the cat, giving them a\r\nclout, take no leave of your lord, but bow low to him and retire, and\r\nthus shall ye have thanks and reward whensoever it fall.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “_A Bath or Stew so-called_\r\n\r\n“If your lord wishes to bathe and wash his body clean, hang sheets round\r\nthe roof, every one full of flowers and sweet green herbs, and have five\r\nor six sponges to sit or lean upon, and see that you have one big sponge\r\nto sit upon, and a sheet over so that he may bathe there for a while,\r\nand have a sponge also for under his feet, if there be any to spare, and\r\nalways be careful that the door is shut. Have a basin full of hot fresh\r\nherbs and wash his body with a soft sponge, rinse him with fair warm\r\nrose-water, and throw it over him; then let him go to bed; but see that\r\nthe bed be sweet and nice; and first put on his socks and slippers that\r\nhe may go near the fire and stand on his foot-sheet, wipe him dry with a\r\nclean cloth, and take him to bed to cure his troubles.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  “_The Making of a Medicinable Bath_\r\n\r\n“Boil together hollyhock,[151] mallow, wall pellitory and brown fennel,\r\ndanewort, St. John’s wort, centaury, ribwort and camomile, heyhove,\r\nheyriff, herb-benet, bresewort, smallage, water speedwell, scabious,\r\nbugloss (?), and wild flax which is good for aches—boil withy leaves and\r\ngreen oats together with them, and throw them hot into a vessel and put\r\nyour lord over it and let him endure for a while as hot as he can, being\r\ncovered over and closed on every side; and whatever disease, grievance\r\nor pain ye be vexed with, this medicine shall surely make you whole, as\r\nmen say.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “_The Office of Usher and Marshal_\r\n\r\n“An usher or marshal, without fail, must know all the estates of the\r\nChurch, and the excellent estate of a king with his honourable blood.\r\nThis is a notable nurture, cunning, curious and commendable.\r\n\r\n“The estate of the Pope has no peer, an emperor is next him everywhere\r\nand a King is correspondent, a high cardinal next in dignity, then a\r\nKing’s son (ye call him prince), an archbishop his equal; a duke of the\r\nblood royal; a bishop, marquis and earl coequal; a viscount, legate,\r\nbaron, suffragan and mitred abbot; a baron of the exchequer, the three\r\nchief justices and the Mayor of London; a cathedral prior, unmitred\r\nabbot and knight bachelor; a prior, dean, archdeacon, knight and body\r\nesquire; the Master of the Rolls (as I reckon aright), and puisne judge;\r\nclerk of the crown and the exchequer, and you may pleasantly prefer the\r\nMayor of Calais.[152]\r\n\r\n“A provincial,[153] doctor of divinity and prothonotary[154] may dine\r\ntogether; and you may place the pope’s legate or collector with a doctor\r\nof both laws. An ex-mayor of London ranks with a serjeant-at-law, next a\r\nMastery of Chancery, and then a worshipful preacher of pardons,[155]\r\nmasters of arts, and religious orders, parsons and vicars, and parish\r\npriests with a cure, the bailiffs of a city, a yeoman of the crown, and\r\nserjeant-of-arms with his mace, with him a herald, the King’s herald in\r\nthe first place, worshipful merchants and rich artificers, gentlemen\r\nwell-nurtured and of good manners, together with gentlewomen and lords’\r\nfoster-mothers[156]—all these may eat with squires.\r\n\r\n“Lo, son, I have now told you, after my simple wit, the rank of every\r\nestate according to his degree, and now I will show you how they should\r\nbe grouped at table in respect of their dignity, and how they should be\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n“The pope, an emperor, king, cardinal, prince with a golden royal\r\nrod,[157] archbishop in his pall—all these for their dignity ought not\r\nto dine in the hall.\r\n\r\n“A bishop, viscount, marquis, goodly earl may sit at two messes if they\r\nbe agreeable thereunto.\r\n\r\n“The Mayor of London, a baron, a mitred abbot, the three chief justices,\r\nthe Speaker of Parliament—all these estates are great and honourable,\r\nand they may sit together in chamber or hall, two or three at a mess, if\r\nit so please them; but in your office you must try to please every man.\r\n\r\n“The other estates, three or four to a mess, equal to a knight’s, are:\r\nunmitred abbot or prior, dean, archdeacon, Master of the Rolls, all the\r\nunder judges and barons of the king’s exchequer, a provincial, a doctor\r\nof divinity or of both laws, a prothonotary, or the pope’s collector, if\r\nhe be there, and the Mayor of the Staple.\r\n\r\n“Other ranks you may set four to a mess, of persons equal to a squire in\r\ndignity, serjeants-at-law and ex-mayors of London, the masters of\r\nChancery, all preachers, residencers, and parsons, apprentices of the\r\nlaw, merchants and franklins—these may sit properly at a squire’s table.\r\n\r\n“Each estate shall sit at meat by itself, not seeing the others, at\r\nmeal-time or in the field or in the town; and each must sit alone in the\r\nchamber or in the pavilion.\r\n\r\n“The Bishop of Canterbury shall be served apart from the Archbishop of\r\nYork, and the Metropolitan shall be served alone. The Bishop of York\r\nmust not be served in the presence of the Primate of England.[158]\r\n\r\n“Now, son, from divers causes, as equally from ignorance, a marshal is\r\noften puzzled how to rank lords of royal blood who are poor, and others\r\nnot of royal blood who are rich, also ladies of royal blood wedded to\r\nknights, and poor ladies marrying those of royal blood. The lady of\r\nroyal blood shall keep her rank, the lady of low blood and degree shall\r\ntake her husband’s rank. The substance of livelihood[159] is not so\r\ndigne[160] as royal blood, wherefore this prevails in chamber and hall,\r\nfor some day blood royal might attain to the kingship.\r\n\r\n“If the parents of a pope or cardinal be still alive, they must in no\r\nwise presume to be equal to their son, either sitting or standing. The\r\nestate of their son will not allow them either to sit or stand by\r\nhim—nor should they desire it; wherefore they should have a separate\r\nchamber assigned to them.\r\n\r\n“A marshal must look to the birth of each estate, and arrange officers\r\nsuch as chancellor, steward, chamberlain, treasurer, according to their\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n“He must honour foreign visitors, and strangers to this land, even when\r\nthey are resident here. A well-trained marshal should think beforehand\r\nhow to place strangers at the table, for if they show gentle cheer and\r\ngood manners, he thereby doth honour his lord and bring praise to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“If the king send any messenger to your lord, if he be a knight, squire,\r\nyeoman of the crown, groom, page or child, receive him honourably as a\r\nbaron, knight, squire, yeoman or groom,[161] and so forth, from the\r\nhighest degree to the lowest, for a king’s groom may dine with a knight\r\nor a marshal.\r\n\r\n“A commendable marshal must also understand the rank of all the\r\nworshipful officers of the commonalty of this land, of shires, cities\r\nand boroughs—such must be placed in due order, according to their rank.\r\n\r\n“The estate of a knight of [good] blood and wealth is not the same as\r\nthat of a simple and poor knight. Also, the Mayor of Queenborough[162]\r\nis not of like dignity with the Mayor of London—nothing like of degree;\r\nand they must on no account sit at the same table.\r\n\r\n“The Abbot of Westminster is the highest in the land, and the Abbot of\r\nTintern the poorest; both are abbots, yet Tintern shall neither sit nor\r\nstand with Westminster.[162] Also, the Prior of Dudley may in no wise\r\nsit with the Prior of Canterbury.[162] And remember, as a general rule,\r\nthat a prior who is a prelate of a cathedral church, shall sit above any\r\nabbot or prior of his own diocese, in church, chapel, chamber or hall.\r\n\r\n“Reverend doctors of twelve years’ standing shall sit above those of\r\nnine years’, although the latter may spend more largely of fine red\r\ngold. Likewise, the younger aldermen shall sit or stand below their\r\nelders, and so in every craft, the master first, and then the ex-warden.\r\n\r\n“All these points, with many more, belong to the duty of a marshal; and\r\nso before every feast think what estates shall sit in the hall, and\r\nreason with yourself before your lord shall call upon you. If you are in\r\nany doubt, go either to your lord or to the chief officer, and then\r\nshall you do no wrong or prejudice to any state; but set all according\r\nto their birth, riches or dignity.\r\n\r\n“Now, good son, I have shown you the courtesy of the court, and how to\r\nmanage in pantry, buttery, cellar or in carving, as a sewer or as a\r\nmarshal. I suppose ye be sure in these sciences, which in my day I\r\nlearned with a royal prince, to whom I was usher and also marshal.\r\n\r\n“All the officers I have mentioned have to obey me, ever to fulfil my\r\ncommandment when I call, for our office is the chief in spicery and\r\ncellar, whether the cook be lief or loth.[163]\r\n\r\n“All these divers offices may be filled by a single person, but the\r\ndignity of a prince requireth each office to have its officer and a\r\nservant waiting on him. Moreover, all must know their duties perfectly,\r\nfor doubt and fear are a hindrance in serving a lord and pleasing his\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n“Fear not to serve a prince—God be his speed! Take good heed to your\r\nduties, and be ever on the watch, and thus doing as ye should, there\r\nwill be no need to doubt.\r\n\r\n“Tasting is done only for those of royal blood, as pope, emperor,\r\nempress, cardinal, king, queen, prince, archbishop, duke or earl—none\r\nother that I call to remembrance. It is done for fear of poison, so let\r\neach man in office keep his room secure and close his safe,[164] chest\r\nand storehouse for fear of conspiracy.\r\n\r\n“The steward and chamberlain of a prince of the blood must know about\r\nhomages, services and fewte;[165] and as they have the oversight of all\r\nother offices and of the tasting, they must tell the marshal, sewer or\r\ncarver, how to do it; and he must be in no fear when he tasteth.\r\n\r\n“As the evening draws in, and I cannot tarry, I do not propose to\r\ncontrive more of this matter. This treatise that I have entitled, if ye\r\nwould prove it, I myself assayed in youth, when I was young and lusty;\r\nand I enjoyed these aforesaid matters, and took good heed to learn. But\r\ncrooked age hath now compelled me to leave the court, so assay for\r\nyourself, my son, and God speed you!”\r\n\r\n“Now, fair befall you, father, and blessings be on you for thus teaching\r\nme! I shall dare to do diligent service to divers dignitaries, where\r\nbefore I was afraid for the scantiness of my knowledge; I perceive the\r\nwhole matter so perfectly that I am ready to try my part, and some good\r\nI may learn from practice and exercise. I am bound always to pray God\r\nreward you for your gentle teaching of me!”\r\n\r\n“Now, good son, thyself and others that shall succeed thee to note,\r\nlearn and read over this book of nurture, pray for the soul of John\r\nRussell, servant to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Pray for that peerless\r\nprince, and for the souls of my wife and my father and mother, unto\r\nMary, Mother and Maid, that she defend us from our foes, and bring us\r\nall to bliss when we go hence. Amen.”\r\n\r\n[The _envoi_ may have been added later[166]]\r\n\r\n   “Go forth, little book, and lowly thou me commend,\r\n   Unto all young gentlemen that list to learn or entend,[167]\r\n   And specially to them that have experience, praying them to amend,\r\n   And correct what is amiss, whereas I fail or offend.\r\n   And if so that any be found as through my negligence,\r\n   Cast the cause on my copy, rude and bare of eloquence,\r\n   Which to draw out [I] have done my busy diligence,\r\n   Readily to reform it by reason and better sentence.\r\n\r\n   As for rhyme or reason, the fore-writer was not to blame,\r\n   For as he found it before him, so wrote he the same,\r\n   And though he or I in our matter digress or degrade,\r\n   Blame neither of us, for we never it made;\r\n   Simple, as I had insight, somewhat the rhyme I correct.\r\n   Blame I could no man, I have no person suspect.\r\n   Now, good God, grant us grace our souls never to infect,\r\n   Then we may reign

WHOSO will of courtesy hear,\r\n                 In this book it is made clear.\r\n            If thou be gentleman, yeoman or knave,\r\n            Thee needeth nurture for to have.\r\n            When thou comest to a lord’s gate,\r\n            The porter thou shalt find thereat;\r\n            Take[168] him thou shalt thy weapon to,\r\n            And ask him leave in to go,\r\n            To speak with lord, lady, squire or groom,\r\n            Thereof thou must bethink thee soon;\r\n            For if he be of low degree,\r\n            Then him falls to come to thee.\r\n            If he be gentleman of kin\r\n            The porter thee will lead to him.\r\n            When thou comest the hall door to,\r\n            Take off thy hood, thy gloves off do.\r\n            If the hall at the first meat be,\r\n            Forget not this lesson concerns thee:\r\n            The steward, controller and treasurer there,\r\n            Sitting at the daïs, hail thou fair.\r\n            Within the hall set on either side,\r\n            Sit other gentlemen, as falls that tide.\r\n            Incline thee fair to them also,\r\n            First to the right hand thou shalt go,\r\n            Sithen[169] to the left hand thine eye thou cast,\r\n            To them thou bowest full fast.\r\n            Take heed to yeomen on thy right hand,\r\n            And sithen before the screen thou stand,\r\n            Amid the hall upon the floor,\r\n            While marshal or usher come fro the door,\r\n            And bid thee sit or to board thee lead.\r\n            Be stable of cheer for manners, take heed.\r\n            If ye be set at a gentleman’s board,\r\n            Look thou be hend[170] and little of word.\r\n            Pare thy bread and carve in two\r\n            The overcrust from the nether through.\r\n            In four thou cut the overdole,[171]\r\n            Set them together as it were whole,\r\n            After, cut the nether crust in three,\r\n            And turn it down—learn this of me.\r\n            And set thy trencher thee before,\r\n            And sit upright for any sore.\r\n            Spare bread or wine, drink or ale,\r\n            Till thy mess from the kitchen be set in hall,\r\n            Lest men say thou art hunger-beaten,\r\n            Or all men know thee for a glutton.\r\n            Look thy nails be clean, in truth,\r\n            Lest thy fellow loathe them, forsooth.\r\n            Bite not thy bread and lay it down,\r\n            That is no courtesy to use in town.\r\n            As much as thou wilt eat, that break,\r\n            The remnant left the poor shall take.\r\n            In peace thou eat and ever eschew\r\n            To quarrel at board—that may thee rue.\r\n            If thou make mows in any wise\r\n            A villainy thou catchest or ever thou rise,\r\n            Let never thy cheek be great with meat,\r\n            Or morsel of bread that thou shalt eat.\r\n            An ape’s mow men say he makes\r\n            That bread and flesh in his cheek bakes.[172]\r\n            If any man speak that time to thee,\r\n            And thou shalt answer, it will not be\r\n            But wallowing,[172] and thou must abide;\r\n            That is a shame for all beside.\r\n            On both sides of thy mouth if thou eat,\r\n            Many a scorning shalt thou get.\r\n            Thou shalt not laugh nor speak nothing,\r\n            While thy mouth be full of meat or drink.\r\n            Nor sup thou not with great sounding,\r\n            Neither pottage, nor other thing.\r\n            Let not thy spoon stand in thy dish,\r\n            Whether thou be served with flesh or fish,\r\n            Nor lay it not on thy dish side,\r\n            But cleanse it honestly without pride.\r\n            Look that no dirt on thy finger be,\r\n            To defoul the cloth before thee.\r\n            In thy dish if thou wet thy bread,\r\n            Look thereof that nought be led\r\n            To drip again thy dish into;\r\n            Thou art ill-bred if thou so do.\r\n            Dry thy mouth ay well and fine,\r\n            Whether thou shalt drink ale or wine,\r\n            Nor call thou not a dish again\r\n            That is taken from the board in plain.[173]\r\n            If thou spit over the board or else on’t,\r\n            Thou shalt be holden courtesy to want.\r\n            If thine own dog thou scrape or claw\r\n            For a vice that is held as men know.\r\n            If thy nose thou cleanse, as may befall,\r\n            Look thy hand thou cleanse withal;\r\n            Privily with skirt do it away,\r\n            Or else thro’ thy tippet that is so gay.\r\n            At meat cleanse not thy teeth nor pick\r\n            With knife or straw or wand or stick.\r\n            While thou holdest meat in mouth, beware\r\n            To drink, that is an unhonest chare;[174]\r\n            And also physic forbids it quite,\r\n            And says thou may be choked at that bite,\r\n            If it go wrong thy throat into\r\n            And stop thy wind, thou art fordo.[175]\r\n            Nor tell thou never at board no tale\r\n            To harm or shame thy fellow in hall;\r\n            For if he then withhold his wrath,\r\n            Eftsoons he will forecast thy death.\r\n            Wheresoever thou sit at meat by the board,\r\n            Avoid[176] the cat, at a bare word;\r\n            For if thou stroke or cat or dog,\r\n            Thou art like an ape tied with a clog.\r\n            Also eschew, without strife,\r\n            To foul the board-cloth[177] with thy knife.\r\n            Nor blow not on thy drink or meat,\r\n            Neither for cold, neither for heat.\r\n            Nor bear with meat thy knife to mouth,\r\n            Whether thou be set by strong or couth.[178]\r\n            Nor with no board-cloth thy teeth thou clean\r\n            Nor eyen that run red, as may be seen.\r\n            If thou sit by a right good man\r\n            This lesson look thou think upon:\r\n            Under his thigh put not thy knee\r\n            Thou art full lewd if thou let this be.\r\n            Nor backward sitting give thou thy cup\r\n            Neither to drink, neither to sup.\r\n            Bid thy friend take cup and drink,\r\n            That is holden an honest thing.\r\n            Lean not on elbow at thy meat,\r\n            Neither for cold nor for heat.\r\n            Dip not thy thumb thy drink into;\r\n            Thou art uncourteous if thou it do.\r\n            In salt-cellar if thou put\r\n            Or fish or flesh that men see it,\r\n            That is a vice, as men me tells;\r\n            And great wonder it would be else.\r\n            After meat when thou shalt wash,\r\n            Spit not in basin nor water dash,\r\n            Nor spit not loosely for any meed\r\n            Before a man of God for dread.\r\n            Whosoever despises this lesson right\r\n            At board to sit he has no might.\r\n            Here endeth now our first talking.\r\n            Christ grant us all his dear blessing!\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Here endeth the First Book of Courtesy_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_If thou be a young

After, thy _Ave Maria_ and thy _Creed_,\r\n         That shall thee save at doom of dread.\r\n         Then after to bless thee with the Trinity,\r\n         _In nomine patris_ he will teach thee.\r\n

Of men, and God that sits above.\r\n         Be not too meek, but in mean thou hold,\r\n         For else a fool thou wilt be told.\r\n         He that to righteousness will incline,\r\n         As Holy Writ tells us, well and fine,\r\n         Never go seek their bread shall his seed,\r\n         Nor suffer of man no shameful deed.\r\n         To forgive thou shalt thee haste,\r\n         To

take no more to do in hand,\r\n         Than thou may have worship of all in land.\r\n         If thou see any man fall in the street,\r\n         Laugh not thereat in dry nor wet;\r\n         But help him up with all thy might,\r\n         As St. Ambrose[197] thee teaches right.\r\n         Thou that stands so sure on seat,\r\n         ‘Ware lest thy head fall to thy feet.\r\n         My

thee there,\r\n         Answer him gladly without demur.\r\n         Go not forth as a dumb freak,[198]\r\n         Since God has given thee tongue to speak,\r\n         Lest men say to friend or gossip:\r\n         “Yonder is a man ne’er opens his lip.”[199]\r\n         Speak never wrong of womenkind,\r\n         Nor let it never run in thy mind.\r\n         The book him calls of churlish face\r\n         That oft of women speaks villainy base.\r\n         For all we be of women born,\r\n         And our fathers us beforn;\r\n         Therefore it is an unhonest thing\r\n         To do them any belittling.[200]\r\n         Also to a wife befalls of right\r\n         To worship her husband both day and night;\r\n         To his bidding to show obediénce,\r\n         And him to serve without offence.\r\n         If two brethren be in debate\r\n         Look neither thou further in their hate;\r\n         But help to staunch[201] them of uncharity;\r\n         Then thou art friend of both certainly.\r\n         If thou go with another at the gate,\r\n         And ye be both of one estate,\r\n         Be courteous and let him have the way:\r\n         That is no villainy, as men me say.\r\n         If he be come of great kindred,\r\n         Go not before though thou be bid;\r\n         And if that he thy master be,\r\n         Go not before for courtesy,\r\n         Neither in field, wood nor lawnd,[202]\r\n         Nor even[203] with him, unless he command.\r\n         If thou shalt on pilgrimage go,\r\n         Be not third fellow, for weal nor woe;\r\n         Three oxen[204] in plough may never well draw,\r\n         Neither by craft, right, nor law.\r\n         If thou be proffered to drink of cup\r\n         Drink not all off, nor no way sup;\r\n         Drink mannerly[205] and give again:\r\n         That is a courtesy, to speak in plain.\r\n         In bed if thou fall harboured to be\r\n         With fellow, master, or their degree,\r\n         Thou shalt inquire by courtesy,\r\n         In what part of the bed he will lie.\r\n         Be honest and lie thou far him fro;\r\n         Thou art not wise but thou do so.\r\n         With whatso man, both far and nigh,\r\n         Thee falls to go, look thou be sly[206]\r\n         To ask his name, and which he be,\r\n         Whither he will: keep well these three.\r\n         With friars on pilgrimage if that thou go\r\n         What they will observe, will thou also.\r\n         When at night thou take thy rest,\r\n         And bide the day as true man’s guest,\r\n         In never house where a red man[206] be,\r\n         Nor woman of the same colour certainly,\r\n         Take never thine inn for no manner need,\r\n         For those be folk to hold in dread.\r\n         If any in sternness thee oppose,\r\n         Answer him meekly, and make him glose;[207]\r\n         But glosing word that falséd[208] is\r\n         Forsake, and all that is amiss.\r\n         Also, if thou have a lord,\r\n         And stand before him at the board,\r\n         While that thou speak, keep well thy hand;\r\n         Thy foot also in peace let stand.\r\n         His courtesy needs must he break,\r\n         Stirring fingers or toes whene’er he shall speak.[209]\r\n         Be stable of cheer and somewhat light,\r\n         Nor over all wave[210] thou not thy sight.\r\n         Gaze not on walls with thine eye,\r\n         Far nor near, low nor high.\r\n         Let not the post become thy staff,\r\n         Lest thou be called a “doted daff.”[211]\r\n         Nor delve thou never thy nostril,\r\n         With thumb or finger as young girl.\r\n         Rub not thy arm, nor claw it naught,\r\n         Nor bow thy head too low in aught.\r\n         While any man speaks with great businéss,\r\n         Hearken his words without distress.\r\n         By street or way if thou shalt go,\r\n         From these two things thou keep thee fro;\r\n         Neither to harm child nor beast,\r\n         With casting, turning west nor east.\r\n         Nor change thou not in face colour,\r\n         For lightness of word in hall or bower;\r\n         If thy visage change for nought,\r\n         Men say thee: “Trespass thou hast wrought.”\r\n         Before thy lord no mows thou make,\r\n         If thou wilt courtesy with thee take.\r\n         With hands unwashen take never thy meat:\r\n         From all these vices look thou keep.\r\n         Look thou sit—and make no strife—\r\n         Where the host commands, or else his wife.\r\n         Eschew the highest place to win,[212]\r\n         Save thou be bidden to sit therein.\r\n         Of courtesy here ends the second fit.[213]\r\n         To heaven Christ grant our souls to flit!\r\n\r\n\r\n

better man may be.\r\n        Child, I warn thee in all wise,\r\n        That thou tell truth and make no lies.\r\n        Child, be not froward, be not proud,\r\n        But hold up thy head and speak aloud;\r\n        And when any man speaketh to thee\r\n        Doff thy hood and bow thy knee.\r\n        And wash thy hands and thy face,\r\n        And be courteous in every place.\r\n        And when thou comest where is good cheer\r\n        In hall or bower, bid “God be here!”\r\n        Look thou cast to no man’s dog,\r\n        With staff nor stone at horse nor hog.\r\n        Look that thou not scorn nor jape\r\n        Neither with man, maiden nor ape.\r\n        Let no man of thee make plaint.\r\n        Swear not by God, neither by saint.\r\n        Look thou be courteous standing at meat,\r\n        And that men giveth thee, take and eat.\r\n        And look thou neither cry nor crave,\r\n        Saying, “That and that would I have!”\r\n        But stand thou still before the board,\r\n        And look thou speak no loud word.\r\n        And child, worship thy father and thy mother;\r\n        Look that thou grieve neither one nor other,\r\n        But ever, among them thou shalt kneel down,\r\n        And ask their blessing and benison.\r\n        And child, keep thy clothes fair and clean;\r\n        Let no foul filth on them be seen.\r\n        Child, climb not over house nor wall,[310]\r\n        For no fruit, birds nor ball.\r\n        Child, over men’s houses no stones fling,\r\n        Nor at glass windows no stones sling.\r\n        Nor make no crying, jokes, nor plays\r\n        In holy church on holy days.\r\n        And child, I warn thee of another thing,\r\n        Keep thee from many words and wrangling.\r\n        And child, when thou goest to play,\r\n        Look thou come home by light of day.\r\n        And child, I warn thee of another matter,\r\n        Look thou keep thee from fire and water.\r\n        Be ware and wise how that thou look\r\n        Over any brink, well, or brook.\r\n        And when thou standest at any schate[311]\r\n        Be ware and wise that thou catch no stake;\r\n        For many child without dread,\r\n        Through evil heed is deceived or dead.\r\n        Child, keep thy book, cap, and gloves,\r\n        And all thing that thee behoves.\r\n\r\n             ───────────\r\n\r\n        Child, be thou neither liar nor thief,\r\n        Be thou no meecher[312] for mischief.\r\n        Child, make thou no mows nor knacks,[313]\r\n        Before no men nor behind their backs.\r\n        But be of fair semblance and countenance,\r\n        For by fair manners men may thee advance.\r\n        Child, when thou goest in any street,\r\n        If thou any good man or woman meet,\r\n        Avale[314] thy hood to him or to her,\r\n        And bid “God speed, dame, or sir!”\r\n        And be they small or great thou hast met,\r\n        This lesson that thou not forget;\r\n        For it is seemly to every man’s child,\r\n        And mannerly, to clerks to be meek and mild.\r\n        And child, rise betimes and go to school,\r\n        And fare not as wanton[315] fool;\r\n        And learn as fast as thou may and can,\r\n        For our bishop is an old man,\r\n        And therefore thou must learn fast,\r\n        If thou wilt be bishop when he is passed.[316]\r\n        Child, I bid thee on my blessing,\r\n        That thou forget not this for nothing;\r\n        But look, thou hold it well in thy mind,\r\n        For the best thou shalt it find.\r\n        For, as the wise man saith and proveth,\r\n        A wise child, lore he behoveth;\r\n        And as men say that learned be,\r\n        Who spareth the rod, the child hateth he;\r\n        And as the wise man saith in his book,\r\n        Of proverbs and wisdoms, who will look:\r\n        “As a sharp spur maketh a horse to move,\r\n        Under a man that should war prove,\r\n        Right so a yard may make a child,\r\n        To learn well his lesson and to be mild.”\r\n        Lo! children, here may ye all hear and see,\r\n        How all children chastised should be.\r\n        And therefore, childer, look ye do well,\r\n        And no hard beating shall you befall.\r\n        Thus may ye all be right good men,\r\n        God grant you grace so to preserve you!  Amen.\r\n                                                   [Quoth] SYMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Who spareth the rod, the child hateth_”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HUGH RHODES’S BOOK OF NURTURE\r\n                       AND SCHOOL OF GOOD MANNERS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALL ye that would learn and then would be calléd wise,\r\n  Obedience learn in youth, in age it will avoid vice.\r\n\r\n  I am blind in poet’s art, thereof I have no skill;\r\n  All eloquence I put apart, and follow mine own will.\r\n\r\n  Corrupt in speech my briefs and longs[317] to know,\r\n  Born and bred in Devonshire, my terms will well show.\r\n\r\n  Take the best and leave the worst, of truth I mean no ill;\r\n  If the matter be not curious, the intent is good, mark it well.\r\n\r\n  Pardon I ask if I offend thus boldly for to write,\r\n  To master or servant (young and old) I do myself submit.\r\n\r\n  I would reform both youth and age, if anything be amiss;\r\n  To you will I shew my mind, reform ye where need is.\r\n\r\n  All that have young people, good manners set them to learn;\r\n  To their elders with gentle conditions let do nor say no harm.\r\n\r\n  If they do ill, wise men may report their parents soon;\r\n  How should they teach other good, belike themselves can[318] none.\r\n\r\n  A good father maketh good children, if wisdom be them within,\r\n  Such as of custom use it in youth, in age they will begin.\r\n\r\n  He that lacketh good manners is little set by;\r\n  Without virtue or good conditions, a man is not worth a fly.\r\n\r\n  Reverence father and mother (of duty), kind[319] doth thee bind;\r\n  Such children increaseth, and likely to recover virtue by kind.[319]\r\n\r\n  Against father and mother multiply no words, be you[320] sure;\r\n  It will be to thee laud and to thy friends joyful to hear.\r\n\r\n  A plant without moisture may not bring forth his flower;\r\n  If youth be void of virtue, in age he shall lack honour.\r\n\r\n  First dread God, next flee sin, all earthly things are mortál;\r\n  Stand not too fast in thy conceit, for pride will have a fall.\r\n\r\n  Use early rising in the morning, for it hath properties three;\r\n  Holy, healthy, wealthy—in my youth thus my father taught me.\r\n\r\n  At six of the clock at farthest, accustom thee to rise;\r\n  Look thou forget not to bless thee once or twice.\r\n\r\n  In the morning use some devotion, and let for no need;\r\n  Then all the day afterward the better shalt thou speed.\r\n\r\n       ────────────────\r\n\r\n  Sponge and brush thy clothes clean that thou shalt on wear;\r\n  Cast up your bed, and take heed ye lose none of your gear.\r\n\r\n  Make clean thy shoes, comb thy head, mannerly thee brace;\r\n  See thou forget not to wash both thy hands and face.\r\n\r\n  Put on thy clothing for thy degree,[321] honestly do it make.\r\n  Bid your fellow good morrow, ere ye your way forth take.\r\n\r\n  To your friends and to father and mother look ye take heed;\r\n  For any haste do them reverence, the better shalt thou speed.\r\n\r\n  Dread the cursing of father and mother, for it is a heavy thing;\r\n  Do thy duty to them, the contrary will be to thy dispraising.\r\n\r\n  When thy father and mother come in sight, do them reverénce,\r\n  And ask them blessing if they have been long out of presénce.\r\n\r\n  Cleanly appoint you your array, beware then of disdain;\r\n  Then be gentle of speech and mannerly you retain.\r\n\r\n  And as ye pass the town or street, sadly[322] go forth your way,\r\n  [Nor] gaze nor scoff, nor scold, with man nor child make no fray.\r\n\r\n  Fair speech doth great pleasure; it seemeth of gentle blood;\r\n  Gentle is to use fair speech; it requireth nothing but good.\r\n\r\n  And when thou comest into the church thy prayers for to say,\r\n  Kneel, sit, stand or walk, devoutly look thou pray.\r\n\r\n  Cast not your eye to and fro, all things for to see;\r\n  Then shalt thou be judged plainly a wanton for to be.\r\n\r\n  When thou art in the church, [see thou] do churchly works;\r\n  Communication use thou not to women, priests nor clerks.\r\n\r\n  When your devotion is done and time is toward dinner;\r\n  Draw home to your master’s presence, there do your [en]deavour.\r\n\r\n  An ye be desired to serve, or sit, or eat meat at the table,\r\n  Incline to good manners, and to nurture yourself enable.\r\n\r\n  If your sovereign call you with him to dine or sup,\r\n  Give him reverence to begin, both of meat and cup.\r\n\r\n  And beware for anything, press[323] not thyself too high;\r\n  To sit in the place appointed thee—that is courtesy.\r\n\r\n  And when thou art set, and table served thee before,\r\n  Pare not your nails, ’file[324] not your cloth—learn ye that lore.\r\n\r\n  An thy master speak to thee, take thy cap in hand,\r\n  If thou sit at meat, when he talketh [to thee] see thou stand.\r\n\r\n  Lean not to the one side when thou speakest, for nothing,\r\n  Hold still both hand and foot, and beware of trifling.\r\n\r\n  Stand sadly[325] in telling thy tale whenas thou talkest;\r\n  Trifle with nothing, and stand upright when thou speakest.\r\n\r\n  Thwart[326] not thou with thy fellow, nor speak with high voice;\r\n  Point not thy tale with thy fingers, use not such toys.[327]\r\n\r\n  Have audience when thou speakest, speak with authority,\r\n  Else if thou speak wisdom, little will it avail thee.\r\n\r\n  Pronounce thy speech with a pause, mark well thy word;\r\n  It is good hearing a child; beware with whom ye bourd.[328]\r\n\r\n  Talk not to thy sovereign, no time when he doth drink;\r\n  When he speaketh, give him audience—that is good, I think.\r\n\r\n  Before that you sit, see that your knife be bright,\r\n  Your hands clean, your nails pared is a good sight.\r\n\r\n  When thou shalt speak, roll not too fast thine eye;\r\n  Gaze not to and fro, as one that were void of courtesy.\r\n\r\n  For a man’s countenance often times declareth his thought;\r\n  His look with his speech will judge him, good or naught.\r\n\r\n  And see your knife be sharp to cut your meat withal;\r\n  So the more cleanlier cut your meat you shall.\r\n\r\n  Ere thou put much bread in thy pottage, look thou it assay;\r\n  Fill not thy spoon too full, lest thou lose somewhat by the way.\r\n\r\n  If men eat of your dish, crumb therein no bread,\r\n  Lest your hands be sweaty, thereof take ye good heed.\r\n\r\n  They may be corrupt[329] that causeth it, it is no fair uságe.\r\n  Of bread slice out fair morsels to put in your pottáge.\r\n\r\n  Fill it not too full of bread, for it may be to thee reprovable;\r\n  Lest thou leave part, then to measure thou art variable.[330]\r\n\r\n  And sup not loud of thy pottage, no time in all thy life.\r\n  Dip not thy meat in the salt-cellar, but take it with a knife.\r\n\r\n  When thou hast eaten thy pottage, do as I shall thee wish;\r\n  Wipe clean thy spoon and leave it not in thy dish.\r\n\r\n  Lay it down before thy trencher, thereof be not afraid;\r\n  And take heed who taketh it up, lest it be conveyed.[331]\r\n\r\n  Cut not the best morsel for thyself, leave part behind.\r\n  Be not greedy of meat and drink, be liberal and kind.\r\n\r\n  Burnish no bones with your teeth, for it is unseemly.\r\n  Rend not thy meat asunder, for to courtesy it is contrary.\r\n\r\n  An a stranger sit near thee, ever among now and then,\r\n  Reward him with some dainties, like a gentleman.\r\n\r\n  If thy fellow sit from his meat, and cannot come thereto,\r\n  Then cut him such as thou hast, that is gently [to] do.\r\n\r\n  Belch near no man’s face with a corrupt fumosity;[332]\r\n  Turn from such occasion, it is a stinking ventosity.[333]\r\n\r\n  Eat small morsels of meat, not too great in quantity,\r\n  If ye like such meats, yet follow not ever thy phantasy.[334]\r\n\r\n  Corrupt not thy lips with eating, as a pig in draff;\r\n  Eat softly and drink mannerly; beware ye do not quaff.\r\n\r\n  Scratch not thy head with[335] thy fingers, when thou art at meat,\r\n  Nor spit you over the table-board, see thou do not forget.\r\n\r\n  Pick not thy teeth with thy knife nor finger-end,\r\n  But with a stick[336] or some clean thing, then do ye not offend.\r\n\r\n  If your teeth be putrified, methinks it is no right\r\n  To touch meat that other should eat, it is no cleanly sight.\r\n\r\n  Pick not thy hands nor play with thy knife;\r\n  Keep still foot and hand; at meat begin ye no strife.\r\n\r\n  Wipe thy mouth when thou shalt drink ale or wine\r\n  On thy napkin only; and see all things be clean.\r\n\r\n  Blow not your nose in the napkin where ye wipe your hand;\r\n  Cleanse it in your handkerchief, then pass ye not your band.[337]\r\n\r\n  With your napkin you may oft wipe your mouth clean;\r\n  Something thereon will cleave that cannot be seen.\r\n\r\n  Fill not thy trencher with morsels great and large;\r\n  With much meat fill not thy mouth like a barge.\r\n\r\n  Temper thyself with drink, so keep thee from blame;\r\n  It[338] hurteth thy honesty and hindereth thy good name.\r\n\r\n  A pint at a draught to pour in fast, as one in haste,\r\n  Four at a mess is three too many,[339] in such I think waste.\r\n\r\n  Use thy self from excess, both in meat and drink;\r\n  And ever keep temperance, whether[340] you wake or wink.\r\n\r\n  Fill not thy mouth too full, lest thou must needs speak,\r\n  Nor blow out thy crumbs when thou doëst eat.\r\n\r\n  Foul not the place with spitting whereas thou doëst sit,\r\n  Lest it abhor some to see it when thou hast forgot.\r\n\r\n  If thou must spit, or blow thy nose, keep it out of sight,\r\n  Let it not lie on ground, but tread it out right.\r\n\r\n  With bones and void[341] morsels fill not thy trencher too full;\r\n  Avoid[341] them into a voider,[341] and no man will it null.[342]\r\n\r\n  Roll not thy meat in thy mouth, that every man may it see;\r\n  But eat thy meat somewhat close, for it is honesty.\r\n\r\n  If thy sovereign proffer thee to drink once, twice or thrice,\r\n  Take it gently at his hand, for in court it is the guise.\r\n\r\n  When thou has drunk, set it down or take it to his servánt;\r\n  Let not thy master set it down, then it is well, I warránt.\r\n\r\n  Blow not in thy pottage or drink, that is not commendáble,\r\n  For an thou be not whole of body, thy breath is corruptíble.[343]\r\n\r\n  Cast not thy bones under the table, nor none do thou knack.[344]\r\n  Stretch thee not at the table, nor lean forth thy back.\r\n\r\n  Afore dinner or after, with thy knife score[345] not the board;\r\n  Such toys are not commendable, trust me at a word.\r\n\r\n  Lean not on the board when your master is thereat;\r\n  For then will your sovereign think in you checkmate.[346]\r\n\r\n  Be not ashamed to eat the meat which is set before thee;\r\n  Mannerly for to take it, that agreeth well with courtesy.\r\n\r\n  Cast not thine eyes to and fro, as one that were full of toys;\r\n  Much wagging with the head seemeth thou art not wise.\r\n\r\n  Scratch not thy head, put thou not thy finger in thy mouth;\r\n  Blow not thy nose, nor look thereon; to some it is loth.\r\n\r\n  Be not loud where you be, nor at the table where ye sit;\r\n  Some men will deem thee drunken or mad, or to lack wit.\r\n\r\n  When meat is taken away, and the voiders set in presénce,\r\n  Put your trencher in the voider, and also the residénce.[347]\r\n\r\n  Take with your napkin and knife forth crumbs before thee;\r\n  Put your napkin in the voider, for it is courtesy.\r\n\r\n  Be gentle alway and good to please, be it night or day,\r\n  With tongue and hand, be not ’ragious;[348] let reason rule alway.\r\n\r\n  When the meat is taken up and the table-cloth made clean,\r\n  Then take heed of grace, and to wash yourself demean.\r\n\r\n  And while grace is saying, see ye make no noise;\r\n  Thank God of your fare, to your sovereign give praise.\r\n\r\n  When ye perceive to rise, say to your fellows all,\r\n  “Much good do it you,” gently, then gentle, men will you call.\r\n\r\n  Then go to your sovereign, and give obeisance mannerly,\r\n  And withdraw you aside, as best for your honesty.\r\n\r\n  An ye see men in great counsel, press not too near;\r\n  They will say you are untaught; that is sure and clear.\r\n\r\n  Speak not much in thy fellow’s ear, give no ill language;\r\n  Men are suspicious, and will think it no good usage.\r\n\r\n  Laugh not too much at the table, nor make at it no game.\r\n  Avoid slanderous and bawdy tales; use them not for shame.\r\n\r\n  Ere thou be old, beware, so thou may’st get a sudden fall;\r\n  An you be honest in youth, in age ye may be liberal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    Comely thy raiment        look on thy body sit;\r\n\r\n          Thy girdle about          thy waist then fasten,\r\n\r\n          Thy hose fair rubbed,     thy shoes see be clean.\r\n\r\n          A napkin see that         thou have in readiness,\r\n\r\n          Thy nose to cleanse       from all filthiness.\r\n\r\n          Thy nails, if need be,    see that thou pare;\r\n\r\n          Thine ears keep clean,    thy teeth wash thou fair.\r\n\r\n          If aught about thee       chance to be torn,\r\n\r\n          Thy friends thereof show  how it is worn,\r\n\r\n          And they will new         for thee provide,\r\n\r\n          Or the old mend,          in time being spied.\r\n\r\n          This done, thy satchell   and thy books take,\r\n\r\n          And to the school         haste see thou make.\r\n\r\n          But ere thou go,          with thyself forethink.\r\n\r\n          That thou take with thee  pen, paper and ink;\r\n\r\n          For these are things      for thy study necessáry,\r\n\r\n          Forget not then           with thee them to carry.\r\n\r\n          The soldier preparing     himself to the field,\r\n\r\n          Leaves not at home        his sword and his shield;\r\n\r\n          No more should a scholar  forget then truly\r\n\r\n          What he at school         should need to\r\n                                    occupy.[349]\r\n\r\n          These things thus had,    take straight thy way,\r\n\r\n          Unto the school           without any stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n              HOW TO BEHAVE THYSELF IN GOING BY THE STREET\r\n                           AND IN THE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n          In going by the way,      and passing the street,\r\n\r\n          Thy cap put off,          salute those ye meet;\r\n\r\n          In giving the way         to such as pass by,\r\n\r\n          It is a point             of civility.\r\n\r\n          And thy way fortune       so for to fall,\r\n\r\n          Let it not grieve thee    thy fellows to call.\r\n\r\n          When to the school        thou shalt resort,\r\n\r\n          This rule note well,      I do thee exhort:\r\n\r\n          Thy master there being,   salute with all\r\n                                    reverénce,\r\n\r\n          Declaring thereby         thy duty and obediénce;\r\n\r\n          Thy fellows salute        in token of love,\r\n\r\n          Lest of inhumanity        they shall thee reprove.\r\n\r\n          Unto thy place            appointed for to sit,\r\n\r\n          Straight go thou to,      and thy satchell unknit,\r\n\r\n          Thy bokes take out,       thy lesson then learn,\r\n\r\n          Humbly thyself            behave and govérn.\r\n\r\n          Therein taking pain,      with all thine industry,\r\n\r\n          Learning to get,          thy book well apply.\r\n\r\n          All things seem hard      when we do begin,\r\n\r\n          But labour and diligence  yet both them win;\r\n\r\n          We ought not to reckon    and count the thing hard,\r\n\r\n          That bringeth joy         and pleasure afterward;\r\n\r\n          Leave off then labour     and the lack rue,\r\n\r\n          Lament and repent         when age doth ensue.\r\n\r\n          Deeds that deserved       fame and great praise,\r\n\r\n          Buried had been,          we see in old days,\r\n\r\n          If letters had not then   brought them to light\r\n\r\n          The truth of such things  who could now recite?\r\n\r\n          Apply thy mind            to learning and science,\r\n\r\n          For learning in need      will be thy defence.\r\n\r\n          Nothing to science        compare we may well,\r\n\r\n          The sweetness whereof     all things doth excel.\r\n\r\n          And Cato the wise         this worthy saying hath,\r\n\r\n          That man wanting learning is as the image of death.\r\n\r\n          The roots of learning     most bitter we deem;\r\n\r\n          The fruits at last        most pleasant doth seem.\r\n\r\n          Then labour for learning  while here thou shalt\r\n                                    live,\r\n\r\n          The ignorant to teach,    and good example give;\r\n\r\n          So shalt thou be thought  a member most worthy\r\n\r\n          Thy commonwealth to serve in time of necessity.\r\n\r\n          Experience doth teach     and show to thee plain\r\n\r\n          That many to honour       by learning attain,\r\n\r\n          That were of birth        but simple and base;\r\n\r\n          Such is the goodness      of God’s special grace.\r\n\r\n          For he that to honour     by virtue doth rise,\r\n\r\n          Is double happy,          and counted most wise.\r\n\r\n          If doubt thou dost,       desire to be told,\r\n\r\n          No shame is to learn,     being never so old;\r\n\r\n          Ignorance doth cause      great errors in us\r\n\r\n          For wanting of knowledge  doubts to discuss;\r\n\r\n          Then learn to discern     the good from the ill,\r\n\r\n          And such as thee warn,    bear thou good will.\r\n\r\n          When from the school      ye shall take your way,\r\n\r\n          Or orderly then go ye,    two in array,\r\n\r\n          Your selves matching      so equal as ye may,\r\n\r\n          That men it seeing        may well of you say\r\n\r\n          In commending this,       your laudable ways,\r\n\r\n          Which must needs sound    to your great praise,\r\n\r\n          Not running in heaps      as a swarm of bees,\r\n\r\n          As at this day            every man it now sees;\r\n\r\n          Not using, but refusing,  such foolish toys,\r\n\r\n          As commonly are used      in these days of boys,\r\n\r\n          As whooping and           as in hunting the fox,\r\n          hallooing,\r\n\r\n          That men it hearing       deride them with mocks.\r\n\r\n          This foolishness forsake, this folly eschewing,\r\n\r\n          And learn to follow       this order ensuing.\r\n\r\n          In going by the way,      neither talk nor jangle,\r\n\r\n          Gape not, nor gaze not    at every new fangle,\r\n\r\n          But soberly go ye,        with countenance grave;\r\n\r\n          Humbly yourselves         toward all men behave;\r\n\r\n          Be free of cap            and full of courtesy;\r\n\r\n          Great love of all men     you shall win thereby.\r\n\r\n          Be lowly and gentle       and of meek mood;\r\n\r\n          Then men can not          but of you say good.\r\n\r\n          In passing the street,    do no man no harm;\r\n\r\n          Use thou few words,       and thy tongue charm,\r\n\r\n          Then men shall see        that grace in thee\r\n                                    groweth,\r\n\r\n          From whom virtues         so abundantly floweth.\r\n\r\n          When thou art come        where thy parents do\r\n                                    dwell,\r\n\r\n          Thy leave then taking,    bid thy fellows farewell;\r\n\r\n          The house then entering,  in thy parents’ presénce,\r\n\r\n          Humbly salute them        with all reverénce.\r\n\r\n\r\n               HOW TO BEHAVE THYSELF IN SERVING THE TABLE\r\n\r\n          When thy parents down     to the table shall sit,\r\n\r\n          In place be ready,        for the purpose most fit:\r\n\r\n          With sober countenance    looking them in the face,\r\n\r\n          Thy hands holding up,     thus begin grace:\r\n\r\n          “Give thanks to God       with one accord\r\n\r\n          For that shall be         set on this board.\r\n\r\n          And be not careful        what to eat;\r\n\r\n          To each thing living      the Lord sends meat;\r\n\r\n          For food he will not      see you perish,\r\n\r\n          But will you feed,        foster, and cherish;\r\n\r\n          Take well in worth        what he hath sent,\r\n\r\n          At this time be           therewith content\r\n                                    Praising God.”\r\n\r\n          So treatably[350]         as possible thou can,\r\n          speaking\r\n\r\n          That the hearers thereof  may thee understand.\r\n\r\n          Grace being said,         low curtsey make thou,\r\n\r\n          Saying, “Much good        may it do you!”\r\n\r\n          Of stature then           if thou be able,\r\n\r\n          It shall become thee      to serve the table,\r\n\r\n          In bringing to it         such meat as shall need,\r\n\r\n          For thy parents upon      that time to feed.\r\n\r\n          Dishes with measure       thou oughtest to fill,\r\n\r\n          Else may’st thou happen   thy service to spill,\r\n\r\n          On their apparel,         or else on the cloth,\r\n\r\n          Which for to do           would move them to wrath.\r\n\r\n          Spare trenchers with      have in readiness,\r\n          napkins\r\n\r\n          To serve afterward,       if there come any guests.\r\n\r\n          Be circumspect,           see nothing do want,\r\n\r\n          Of necessary things       that there be no scant,\r\n\r\n          As bread and drink,       see there be plenty.\r\n\r\n          The voiders with bones    oft see thou empty.\r\n\r\n          At hand be ready,         if any do call,\r\n\r\n          To fetch or take up,      if ought fortune to fall.\r\n\r\n          When they have done,      then ready make,\r\n\r\n          The table up fair         in order to take.\r\n\r\n          First the salt            see that thou cover,\r\n\r\n          Having by thee            either one or other\r\n\r\n          Things from thy hands     then to convey,\r\n\r\n          That from the table       thou shalt take away.\r\n\r\n          A voider upon             the table thou have,\r\n\r\n          The trenchers and napkins therein to receive.\r\n\r\n          The crumbs with a napkin, together them sweep,\r\n\r\n          (It) at the table’s end   in a voider them keep.\r\n\r\n          Then before each man      a clean trencher lay,\r\n\r\n          The best first serving,   as judge thou soon may.\r\n\r\n          Then cheese with fruit    on the table set,\r\n\r\n          With biscuits or          as you may get.\r\n          caraways,\r\n\r\n          Wine to them fill,        else ale or beer;\r\n\r\n          But wine is meetest,      if any there were.\r\n\r\n          Then on the table         attend with all\r\n                                    diligénce,\r\n\r\n          It for to void,           when done have thy\r\n                                    parénts.\r\n\r\n          Each side of the cloth    do thou turn in;\r\n\r\n          Folding it up,            at the higher end begin.\r\n\r\n          A clean towel then        on the table spread,\r\n\r\n          The towel wanting,        the cloth take instead.\r\n\r\n          The basin and ewer        to the table then bring,\r\n\r\n          In place convenient       their pleasure abiding.\r\n\r\n          When thou shalt see       them ready to wash,\r\n\r\n          The ewer take up,         and be not too rash\r\n\r\n          In pouring out water      more than will suffice.\r\n\r\n          The table then void       that they may rise.\r\n\r\n          All things thus done,     forget not thy duty,\r\n\r\n          Before the table make     thou low curtsey.\r\n\r\n\r\n               HOW TO ORDER THYSELF SITTING AT THE TABLE\r\n\r\n          O children, give ear      your duties to learn,\r\n\r\n          How at the table          you may yourselves\r\n                                    govérn.\r\n\r\n          Presume not too high,     I say, in no case;\r\n\r\n          In sitting down,          to thy betters give\r\n                                    place.\r\n\r\n          Suffer each man           first servéd to be;\r\n\r\n          For that is a point       of good courtesy.\r\n\r\n          When they are served,     then pause a space,\r\n\r\n          For that is a sign        of nurture and grace.\r\n\r\n          Salt with thy knife       then reach and take,\r\n\r\n          The bread cut fair,       and do not it break.\r\n\r\n          Thy spoon with pottage    too full do not fill,\r\n\r\n          For [de]filing the cloth, if thou fortune to spill.\r\n\r\n          For rudeness it is        thy pottage to sup,\r\n\r\n          Or speech to any,         his head in the cup.\r\n\r\n          Thy knife see be sharp    to cut fair thy meat,\r\n\r\n          Thy mouth not too full    when thou dost eat;\r\n\r\n          Not smacking thy lips,    as commonly do hogs,\r\n\r\n          Nor gnawing the bones     as it were dogs;\r\n\r\n          Such rudeness abhor,      such beastliness fly,\r\n\r\n          At the table behave       thyself mannerly.\r\n\r\n          Thy fingers see clean     that thou ever keep,\r\n\r\n          Having a napkin           thereon them to wipe;\r\n\r\n          Thy mouth therewith       clean do thou make,\r\n\r\n          The cup to drink          in hand if thou take,\r\n\r\n          Let not thy tongue        at the table walk,\r\n\r\n          And of no matter          neither reason nor talk.\r\n\r\n          Temper thy tongue         and belly alway,\r\n\r\n          For “measure is           the proverb doth say,\r\n          treasure,”\r\n\r\n          And measure in all things is to be used;\r\n\r\n          What is without measure   ought to be refused.\r\n\r\n          For silence keeping       thou shalt not be\r\n                                    shent,[351]\r\n\r\n          Whereas thy speech        may cause thee repent.\r\n\r\n          Both speech and silence   are commendáble,\r\n\r\n          But silence is meetest    in a child at the table.\r\n\r\n          And Cato doth say,        that “in old and young\r\n\r\n          The first of virtue       is to keep thy tongue.”\r\n\r\n          Pick not thy teeth        at the table sitting,\r\n\r\n          Nor use at thy meat       overmuch spitting;\r\n\r\n          This rudeness of youth    is to be abhorred;\r\n\r\n          Thyself mannerly          behave at the board.\r\n\r\n          If occasion of laughter   at the table thou see,\r\n\r\n          Beware that thou use      the same moderately.\r\n\r\n          Of good manners learn     so much as thou can;\r\n\r\n          It will thee prefer       when thou art a man.\r\n\r\n          Aristotle, the            this worthy saying writ,\r\n          philosopher,\r\n\r\n          That “manners in a child  more requisite\r\n          are\r\n\r\n          Than playing on           and other vain pleasure;\r\n          instruments\r\n\r\n          For virtuous manners      is a most precious\r\n                                    treasure.”\r\n\r\n          Let not this saying       in no wise thee offend,\r\n\r\n          For playing of            he doth not discommend,\r\n          instruments\r\n\r\n          But doth grant them       for a child necessary,\r\n\r\n          Yet manners much more,    see here he doth vary.\r\n\r\n          Refuse not his counsel,   nor his words despise;\r\n\r\n          To virtue and knowledge   by them may’st thou rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HOW TO ORDER THYSELF IN THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n          When to the church        thou shalt repair,\r\n          Kneeling or standing,     to God make thee prayer.\r\n          All worldly matters       from thy mind set apart,\r\n          Earnestly praying,        to God lift up thy heart.\r\n          A contrite heart          He will not despise,\r\n          Which He doth count       a sweet sacrifice.\r\n          To Him thy sins           show and confess,\r\n          Asking for them           grace and forgiveness.\r\n          He is the physician       that knoweth thy sore,\r\n          And can to health         again thee restore.\r\n          Ask then in faith,        not doubting to have;\r\n          The things ye desire,     ye shall them receive;\r\n          So they be lawful         of God to require,\r\n          He will thee hear         and grant thy desire.\r\n          More merciful He is       than pen can express,\r\n          The author and giver      here of all goodness.\r\n          “All ye that labour       and burdenéd be,\r\n          I will you refresh        in coming to Me.”\r\n          These are Christ’s words, the Scripture is plain,\r\n          Spoken to all such        as here suffer pain.\r\n          Our wills to His word     then let us frame,\r\n          The heavenly habitation   thereby we may claim.\r\n          In the church comely      thyself do behave,\r\n          In usage sober,           thy countenance grave.\r\n          While you be there,       talk of no matter,\r\n          Nor one with another      whisper nor chatter.\r\n          Reverently thyself        order alway,\r\n          When to the church        thou shalt come to pray.\r\n          Each thing hath his time, consider the place,\r\n          For that is a token       of virtue and grace.\r\n          The Lord doth call it     the house of prayer,\r\n          And not to be used        as is a fair.\r\n\r\n[This is followed by a series of moral instructions,

quiet rest.\r\n\r\n          Into thy tuition,         O Lord, do us take,\r\n\r\n          Our bodies sleeping,      our minds yet may wake.\r\n\r\n          Forgive the offences      this day we

well,\r\n\r\n            I do what here is done for children’s good.\r\n\r\n            C hrist in His Gospel (as St. Mark doth tell)\r\n\r\n            H ath not forbidden children, nor withstood\r\n\r\n            A ny that should but ask the ready way,\r\n\r\n            R egarding children, not to say them nay,\r\n\r\n            D irecting all that came, how faith should be.\r\n\r\n            W hat they should crave of God’s high majesty,\r\n\r\n            E ven salvation, through their faithful prayer,\r\n\r\n            S ending their contemplations into the

Children (draw near), attend what I say:\r\n           Observe well these precepts and mark them, I pray.\r\n           Though many rules formerly have been set out,\r\n           To quicken the spirits of children in doubt,\r\n           Yet youth is so fickle and loth to be taught,\r\n           That being observed, ’tis unseemly and naught.\r\n           For children’s instructions in virtue and good,\r\n           Four things must be noted and many withstood.\r\n           The first to be marked is so that the mind\r\n           Be seasoned with virtue and godly inclined.\r\n           The second, to aim at the liberal arts,\r\n           To practice and exercise scholar-like parts.\r\n           The third, to be taught as times do require,\r\n           All moderate actions this age doth desire.\r\n           The fourth, that coming to more years and strength,\r\n           That all to civility he bend at the length.\r\n           Observe well the rules which now shall ensue,\r\n           And find them right wholesome, delightful and new.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HOW THOU OUGHTEST TO PREPARE THYSELF,\r\n                    WHEN THOU RISEST IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n            When moderate sleep thy head hath possessed,\r\n            And given thy body his natural rest,\r\n            Shake sluggishness off, bethink thee of things,\r\n            That for thy soul’s health sweet melody brings.\r\n            Seven hours for a child is temperate and good,\r\n            If more, it offendeth and hurteth the blood.\r\n            With heart then unfained, to God first of all\r\n            Frame well thy petition, and thus to him call.\r\n\r\n              [_Morning Prayer_ much as in _Seager_, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE CHARGE OF CHILDREN IN THEIR CARRIAGE\r\n\r\n           Thy prayer so commended to God, have a care\r\n           To wash hands and face, and to combing thy hair.\r\n           And then for the school bethink thou to go,\r\n           The secrets of God the better to know.\r\n           In entering to school, let eyes be upcast,\r\n           To God for His blessings, formerly past,\r\n           To endue thee with godliness, virtue and piety,\r\n           Sent thee from heaven from God in His Deity:\r\n           For without His help can nothing be done,\r\n           Nothing be finished, nothing begun.\r\n           Then mark thou with diligence being so provided,\r\n           What shall at school be said or decided.\r\n           Let not thy thoughts go wandering about,\r\n           And not minding thy practice, abroad for to scout:\r\n           And answer with shamefastness what is required,\r\n           For modesty in youth is chiefly desired.\r\n           Deserve not correction, as near as thou mayest,\r\n           Nor to thy schoolmaster give any distaste,\r\n           Nor yet thy companions, or school-fellows kind:\r\n           Observe what I speak, and bear it in mind.\r\n           Be ready to teach, and not to confute\r\n           Thy schoolfellows’ arguments, when you dispute.\r\n           Let Christ have His library placed in thy heart,\r\n           And ever of Scriptures be reading a part.\r\n           Let all be well-measured what thou shalt read,\r\n           Not posting away with’t, or making much speed;\r\n           For haste overthroweth the mind and the wit,\r\n           Eschew and abandon then things so unfit.\r\n           If all at an instant thou not comprehend,\r\n           To-morrow seek further, thy fault to amend.\r\n           Desire of authors to read of the choice,\r\n           Of such as for eloquence carry the voice,\r\n           As Cicero, Sallust, Gellius[352] and Terence,\r\n           Quintilian and others, great authors of reverénce.\r\n           Observe all with care and diligent ear,\r\n           Thy learning the greater shall grow and appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE CHARGE OF CHILDREN IN GOING FROM SCHOOL AND COMING\r\n\r\n         In going from school, observe it full well,\r\n         In streets stand not staring, nor tales see thou tell,\r\n         What hath been at school said, spoken or done\r\n         Among thy companions; but home get thee gone.\r\n         And unto thy parents see duty thou do,\r\n         With reverent carriage and modesty too,\r\n         Not bold or unmannerly, gentle and mild,\r\n         And show them the office of a dutiful child.\r\n         If that thou have time, ere dinner begin,\r\n         Rehearse to thyself the lesson or thing\r\n         Thou heard’st at the school, let time be well noted,\r\n         The deeper with wisdom thy brains will be quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n              LAYING THE CLOTH, AND MAKING READY THE TABLE\r\n\r\n         Be sure to be ready the board to prepare\r\n         At times as accustomed; with diligent care,\r\n         The table-cloth first see fairly be spread,\r\n         Fair trenchers, clean napkins, the salt and the bread.\r\n         Let glasses be scoured in country guise\r\n         With salt and fair water, and ever devise\r\n         The place most convenient where they may stand,\r\n         The safest from breaking, and nearest at hand.\r\n\r\n           [Here follow several graces and maxims.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DEMEANOUR IN SERVING AT THE TABLE\r\n\r\n Stand straight upright, and both thy feet together closely standing;\r\n Be sure on’t, ever let thine eye be still at thy commanding.\r\n\r\n Observe that nothing wanting be which should be on the board.\r\n Unless a question movéd be, be careful—not a word.\r\n\r\n If thou do fill or give the drink, with duty set it down;\r\n And take it back with manlike cheer, not like a rustic clown.\r\n\r\n If on an errand thou be sent, make haste and do not stay;\r\n When all have done, observe the time, serve God and take away.[353]\r\n\r\n When thou hast done and dinéd well, remember thou repair\r\n To school again with carefulness; be that thy chiefest care.\r\n\r\n And mark what shall be read to thee, or given thee to learn;\r\n That apprehend as near as may be; wisdom so doth warn.\r\n\r\n With steadfast eye and careful ear, remember every word\r\n Thy schoolmaster shall speak to thee, as memory shall afford.\r\n\r\n Let not thy brows be backward drawn, it is a sign of pride.\r\n Exalt them not, it shows a heart most arrogant, beside.\r\n\r\n Nor let thine eyes be glumly[354] down cast, with a hanging look,\r\n For that to dreamers doth belong, that goodness cannot brook.\r\n\r\n Let forehead joyful be and full, it shows a merry part,\r\n And cheerfulness in countenance, and pleasantness of heart.\r\n\r\n Nor wrinkled let thy countenance be, still going to and fro,\r\n For that belongs to hedgehogs[354] right; they wallow even so.\r\n\r\n Nor imitate with Socrates[354] to wipe thy snivelled nose\r\n Upon thy cap, as he would do, nor yet upon thy clothes.\r\n\r\n But keep it clean with handkerchief provided for the same,\r\n Not with thy fingers or thy sleeve; therein thou art to blame.\r\n\r\n Blow not aloud as thou shalt stand, for that is most absurd,\r\n Just like a broken-winded horse; it is to be abhorred.\r\n\r\n Nor practice snufflingly to speak, for that doth imitate\r\n The brutish stork[355] and elephant, yea, and the wauling[356] cat.\r\n\r\n If thou perforce do chance to sneeze, then backwards turn away\r\n From presence of the company wherein thou art to stay.\r\n\r\n Thy cheeks with shamefaced modesty dipped in Dame Nature’s dye,\r\n Not counterfeit nor pufféd out—observe it carefully.\r\n\r\n Keep close thy mouth, for why? Thy breath may hap to give offence,\r\n And other worse may be repaid for further recompense.\r\n\r\n Nor put thy lips out like a fool, as thou would’st kiss a horse,\r\n When thou before thy betters art, and what is ten times worse,\r\n\r\n To gape in such unseemly sort, with ugly, gaping mouth,\r\n Is like an image picturéd[357] a-blowing from the south.\r\n\r\n Which to avoid, then turn about, and with a napkin hide\r\n That gaping, foul deformity, when thou art so aside.\r\n\r\n To laugh at all things thou shalt hear is neither good nor fit;\r\n It shows the property and form of one with little wit.\r\n\r\n To bite the lip, it seemeth base, for why? To lay it open,\r\n Most base, dissembling doggedness, most sure, it doth betoken.\r\n\r\n And so to bite the upper lip doth most uncomely show;\r\n The lips set close[358] (as like to kiss), in manner seem not so.\r\n\r\n To put the tongue out wantonly and draw it in again,\r\n Betokens mocking of thyself, in all the eyes of men.\r\n\r\n If spitting chance to move thee so thou canst it not forbear,\r\n Remember, do it modestly, consider who is there.\r\n\r\n If filthiness or ordure thou upon the floor do cast,\r\n Tread out and cleanse it with thy foot—let that be done with haste.\r\n\r\n Thy head, let that be combed and trimmed, let not thy hair be long;\r\n It is unseemly to the eye, rebukéd by the tongue.\r\n\r\n If in thy tale thou hammering[359] stand, or coughing twixt thy words,\r\n It doth betoken a liar’s smell—that’s all that it affords.\r\n\r\n To belch or bulch like Clitipho,[360] whom Terence setteth forth,\r\n Commendeth manners to be base, most foul and nothing worth.\r\n\r\n If thou to vomit be constrained, avoid from company,\r\n So shall it better be excused, if not through gluttony.\r\n\r\n Keep white thy teeth and wash thy mouth with water pure and clean;\r\n And in that washing, mannerly observe and keep a mean.\r\n\r\n And be not like a slothful wight, delighted to hang down\r\n Thy head, and lift the shoulders up, nor with thy brows to frown.\r\n\r\n To carry up the body fair is decent and doth show\r\n A comely grace in any one, wherever he doth go.\r\n\r\n To hang the head on any side doth show hypocrisy;\r\n And who shall use it, trust him not—he deals with policy.\r\n\r\n      ────────────────\r\n\r\n And in thy sitting use a mean, as may become thee well,\r\n Not straddling, no, nor tottering, and dangling like a bell.\r\n\r\n Observe in courtesy to take a rule of decent kind:\r\n Bend not thy body too far forth, nor back thy leg behind.\r\n\r\n In going, keep a decent gait, not feigning lame or broken,\r\n For that doth seem but wantonness, and foolishness betoken.\r\n\r\n Let thy apparel not exceed to pass for sumptuous cost,\r\n Nor altogether be too base, for so thy credit’s lost.\r\n\r\n Be modest in thy wearing it, and keep it neat and clean,\r\n For spotted, dirty or the like is loathsome to be seen.\r\n\r\n This for thy body may suffice, how thou must ordered be,\r\n Now at the church thou shalt observe, to God how all must be.\r\n\r\n[Then follows _How to Behave Thyself at the Church_, much as in\r\n_Seager_, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NOT TO WALK IN THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n           In seat sit thou quiet, and walk not about,\r\n           For ’tis most unseemly, without any doubt.\r\n           ’Tis fit in a fair, or in some market-town,\r\n           And not in God’s house for to walk up and down.\r\n\r\n           The church is ordained for sermons, orations,\r\n           And prayers divine for the soul’s recreations.\r\n           And not like a playhouse, unhallowed to be,\r\n           Despising the reverence to God’s Majesty.\r\n\r\n           Give ear most attentive to what thou shalt find,\r\n           For God’s word is light to the godly in mind.\r\n           Great ease cometh (out of the reverent text)\r\n           For troubled in heart and in conscience perplexed.\r\n\r\n           Do all this with duty and reverend heart,\r\n           And God will reward thee full well for thy part.\r\n           Observe well the times, for to stand or to kneel,\r\n           The more inward ease of thy heart shalt thou feel.\r\n\r\n           To kneel on the ground with one knee alone,\r\n           Is even as comely as though it were none.\r\n           How can thy devotion be hearty and sound,\r\n           If thou do refuse to lay knees to the ground?\r\n\r\n           ’Tis like to the soldier, who mockingly came,\r\n           Saluting our Saviour, and gave Him the name\r\n           (Hail King of the Jews) his knee was so bent,\r\n           Not with any duty, nor godly intent.\r\n\r\n           If thou in the church alone chance to be,\r\n           Still let heart and thy tongue be so free,\r\n           As never to cease; but with due veneration,\r\n           To call to the Lord with unfeigned contemplation.\r\n\r\n           Let neither thy tongue be talking nor tattling,\r\n           Nor settle of any thing to be a-prattling,\r\n           Nor let thine eyes walk, nor cast them about,\r\n           For of that devotion there is a great doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NECESSARY RULES TO BE OBSERVED FOR THE GUIDING OF CHILDREN IN THEIR\r\n                         APPAREL AND OTHERWISE\r\n\r\nLet not children have their pleasures in the ordering of their garments.\r\nSome delight to have them jagged and cut; but such fantasticness ought\r\nto be reformed by wiser and elder, considering their foolishness is\r\nbeyond measure, if all may be done at their pleasure; and ancient\r\nwriters repute them out of their wits and madmen that favour it.\r\n\r\nAgain, painted and gawdy apparel is not so fantastic in children’s eyes;\r\nbut as costly to the parents’ purses, whereby ancient writers proclaim\r\nsuch parents fellow-fools with their children.\r\n\r\nThe modesty and decency of the vestments of children are strong and\r\ngood, not curious to the eye alone: and such as are clean and without\r\nfoulness or filthiness: which after the estate and means of the parents\r\nought to be principal, so long as by the craftsman it be made with\r\nreasonable and good form and fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n               HOW TO ORDER A CHILD IN HIS DIET FOR DRINK\r\n\r\nFor a child to make the beginning of his dinner drink, is a good way to\r\nbreed him up to drunkenness. Especially, if he take it for wanton\r\ncustom, and not for necessity of thirst. It is dishonest to be suffered,\r\nand annoysome to the health of the body of a child.\r\n\r\nLet not a child drink after he hath supped hot broth, immediately upon\r\nit; much less, if he have been fed with milk.\r\n\r\nLet not a child drink above twice or thrice at the most at one meal, and\r\nthat gently, and not without reason: who bestoweth wine and beer on his\r\nchild beyond reason, deformeth and abuseth him more by dishonouring his\r\nreason, and provoking him to an unreasonable diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n TO MODERATE THE APPETITE OF A CHILD FROM SAUCINESS AND BEING LIQUORISH\r\n\r\nSocrates being old, would not drink of the first cup; for why? His brain\r\nwas light, and the first drink is ever the most fuming and overcoming.\r\n\r\nIf thy child be set with his betters, let his hand be last in the dish.\r\nAnd that he do it not at all, unless he be first bidden. Neither suffer\r\nyour children to put their hands or fingers into broths, sauces,\r\ncaudles, or such like, at the table especially. Otherwise, let\r\ncorrection bridle their wantonness.\r\n\r\nIf he be of sensible years, let him forbear his fingers in a dish, and\r\nuse a knife without choosing at his pleasure; for it is unseemly.\r\n\r\nHomer often reprehendeth sauciness in these or such-like words. They\r\nboldly put their hands into the meat that is set before them. And as it\r\nis unseemly to a liquorish person to train his hands to every side of\r\nthe dish, so is it more vile to turn the best morsel towards thyself.\r\n\r\nTo gnaw bones belongeth chiefly to dogs, but it is a civil thing to pick\r\nthem clean with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe licking of a dish belongeth to cats and dogs and not to children nor\r\nmen, be the relics never so sweet, and betokeneth liquorishiness, not\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nTo drink or speak with meat in the mouth, is uncivil and dangerous\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\nLet the children rise from the board when Nature is sufficed, either by\r\nasking leave, or withdrawing themselves.\r\n\r\nLet children bear away with them their trenchers, saluting their\r\nparents, and first the chief in the company, then the rest.\r\n\r\n     ────────────────\r\n\r\n[The book concludes with various graces, a morning prayer, _A Prayer for\r\nChildren ere they go to School_ (_to be said_), and the following\r\nprayer:—]\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAYER TO BE SAID BY CHILDREN AFTER THEY HAVE STUDIED, AT THEIR GOING\r\n                                 TO BED\r\n\r\nI give thee most humble and hearty thanks, O most generous and blessed\r\nFather of Heaven, in that it hath pleased Thee, of Thy most gracious\r\ngoodness, to hear my request. O Lord, still give me grace to go onward\r\nin understanding and knowledge, that I may ever more praise Thy Holy\r\nName, and grant me Thy grace to amend my life, and to return unfeignedly\r\nunto Thy service. And forasmuch as no creature can breathe without Thy\r\nprotection and favour, vouchsafe to extend Thy mercies unto me this\r\nnight, that I may peaceably and quietly take that rest, which Thou hast\r\nappointed for the refreshment of my body and mind, the night and\r\ndarkness being by Thy goodness ordained, as a time convenient to take\r\nthe same in, and to cease from our bodily labours. And grant unto me (O\r\nLord my God) who of myself am neither able to lie down, nor being laid\r\nable to rise up, Thy especial assistance and help, that I may repose\r\nmyself and receive (at Thy merciful hands) sweet and comfortable rest,\r\nnot according to the greediness of corrupt nature, but as shall be most\r\nexpedient for the comfort and refreshing of my wearied body and mind,\r\nthat both may be strengthened and enabled to go forward with that study\r\nand exercise, which Thou hast ordained and appointed for me. Lastly,\r\ngrant me true repentance for my sins, bless and defend, my parents,\r\nbrethren, sisters, kinsfolk, neighbours, and others, whom Thou would’st\r\nI should commend to Thy fatherly protection, wheresoever they remain,\r\nand for the more true and zealous calling unto Thee for these things,\r\ngive me grace in faith to say that prayer which Thy Son Jesus Christ\r\nhath taught me, saying “O our Father which art in Heaven,” &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\n                            THE BABEES’ BOOK\r\n\r\nMS. Harleian 5086, fols. 86-90, about 1475, ends, “Learn or be lewd.”\r\nFirst printed by Dr. Furnivall. Nothing is known of the author. Written\r\nin _rhyme royal_, five-stress lines in seven-line stanzas, arranged\r\nababbcc. The treatise is noteworthy chiefly in that it seems to be\r\naddressed to young princes, and the MS. dates from the time when Edward\r\nV. and Richard of York were boys. As it is more tedious than quaint in\r\nthe original, it has been rendered into prose.\r\n\r\np. 1. _Facet._ For author and title, see _Introduction_, p. xii. It was\r\nprinted very frequently in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, both\r\nseparately and in connection with seven similar works, two of them also\r\nattributed to John Garland, under the title: _Auctores Octo Opusculorum\r\ncum commentariis_, &c.; _Videlicet Cathonis_, _Theodoli_, _Faceti_,\r\n_Cartule alias de Contemptu Mundi_, _Thobiadis_, _Parabolarum Alani_,\r\n_Fabularum Esopi_, _Floreti_. The English author seems to have borrowed\r\nlittle besides the name and the introduction,\r\n\r\n               “Cum nihil utilius humane credo saluti\r\n                Quam rerum nouisse modos et moribus uti.”\r\n\r\np. 2. _Babies._ Children much older than those we associate with the\r\nword. Apparently it was used like the Spanish _menino_ (French _menin_,\r\nintroduced from Spain, 1680) to mean, “young man of good family.”\r\n\r\np. 2. _Ease in learning_, _i.e._, because it was in verse.\r\n\r\np. 2. _Lady Facetia._ Apparently the author’s feminine of Facetus\r\n(perhaps through confusion with _facetiæ_, jokes), because courtesy was\r\nusually personified as a woman. In the _Tesoretto_, the chief virtue is\r\nLarghezza (liberality), upon whom Courtesy attends, together with\r\nGood-Faith and Valour, over against the masculine qualities, Prudence,\r\nTemperance, Fortitude, Justice.\r\n\r\np. 3. _Bele._ Fr. _belle_, beautiful. Not common in English (see N.E.D.)\r\nuntil the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\np. 6. _Trencher._ Originally, a slice of wholemeal bread, four days old,\r\nupon which food was served. Later, it was made of wood.\r\n\r\np. 8. _Where they ought to be._ In a knife-rack or case? See Wright,\r\n_Domestic Manners and Customs_, p. 464.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE A B C OF ARISTOTLE\r\n\r\nMS. Lambeth 853, fol. 30, about 1430, written without breaks; Harl.\r\n5086, fol. 70b, and Harl. 1304, fol. 103, about 1450 (printed in _Queene\r\nEliz. Achad._). It is needless to say that nothing of the sort is found\r\nin Aristotle; the author is unknown. The introduction is in connected\r\nalliterative verse (lacking in Harl. 5086, and expanded into a\r\ngeneralised religious discourse in Harl. 1304).\r\n\r\np. 10. _Elenge._ See N.E.D. on this rare word. Its two originally\r\ndistinct meanings (1) long, hence, tedious, and (2) lonely, remote,\r\ncombine to form a third meaning, melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              URBANITATIS\r\n\r\nMS. Cotton Caligula, A ii, fol. 88, 1446-60. Author unknown. Apparently\r\nfirst printed by Dr. Furnivall. The Duke of Norfolk, grandfather of Anne\r\nBoleyn and Katherine Howard, was among the young henchmen at the court\r\nof Edward IV., brought up on “the booke of urbanitie.”\r\n\r\np. 13. _Good manners_, &c. William of Wykeham was more curt in his motto\r\nfor Winchester College: “Manners makyth man.”\r\n\r\np. 14. _Close your hand_, &c., _i.e._, one hand over the over, to keep a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\np. 14. _Had I wist._ Proverbial. See notes on _The Good Wife_, p. 186,\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\np. 15. _Let your right shoulder_, &c., _i.e._, keep a step behind him to\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE LITTLE CHILDREN’S LITTLE BOOK\r\n\r\nMSS. Harl. 541, fol. 210, and Egerton 1995, about 1480. Sub-title\r\n_Edyllys be_. _Edyllys_ may be the O. E. _æthele_, German _edel_,\r\nmeaning _noble_; but the sentence is then incomplete. Ends “Quod\r\nWhytyng.” Whether he was author or scribe I do not know, more probably\r\nthe latter. I have kept the rhyme in this version, because it is at once\r\nshorter and more interesting than the other.\r\n\r\np. 16. _Seven Arts._ The quadrivium: arithmetic, music, geometry,\r\nastronomy; and the trivium: grammar, rhetoric, logic.\r\n\r\np. 16. _When Gabriel ... meet._ It is interesting to note that a\r\nmedieval writer connected courtesy with the worship of Mary, even\r\nalthough he includes no precepts which touch upon what we call chivalry\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\np. 16. _Villainy._ The French equivalent of churlishness; what Russell\r\ncalls “simple conditions.”\r\n\r\np. 17. _Beginning ... think._ This kind of rhyme, not uncommon in the\r\nfifteenth century, seems to indicate a pronunciation as in the cockney\r\n_nothink_.\r\n\r\np. 17. _Mess._ Here _food_, but sometimes _table_ (Latin _mensa_), and\r\nagain _group of people at a table_, as used still in the expression\r\n“officers’ mess.”\r\n\r\np. 17. _Fault._ Text: that thy salt holds—which the rhyme shows to be\r\ncorrupt.\r\n\r\np. 18. _Work._ Text: keep—changed for the rhyme.\r\n\r\np. 18. _Fingers_, _i.e._, not with thy knife? Or has a negative been\r\nomitted?\r\n\r\np. 19. _No drop be seen._ So Chaucer’s _Prioress_. See _Introduction_,\r\np. xvi.\r\n\r\np. 19. _Behind no man’s back._ There was perhaps originally an idea of\r\ngreed, or, it may be, of possible tampering with the drink, behind the\r\nprohibition.\r\n\r\np. 20. _Jill._ From Gillian, once a common name for women.\r\n\r\np. 20. _The same._ Text: in same (German _zusammen_) together.\r\n\r\np. 21. _Cumbered with no fiends._ This fear was very real in the Middle\r\nAges, and was fostered by such stories as _Robert the Devil_, _Sir\r\nGowther_, and ballads of supernatural beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE YOUNG CHILDREN’S BOOK\r\n\r\nMS. Ashmole 61 (Bodleian Library), fol. 20, about 1500.\r\n\r\np. 21. _Seven Sciences_, _i.e._, knowledges, hence Arts. The\r\nintroduction is nearly identical, but very few of the maxims agree.\r\n\r\np. 22. _What you get with your hands._ One of the many allusions which\r\nsuggest adaptation to the middle class. Others are to buying and\r\nselling, to getting your money honestly, &c. The stress upon morals\r\nrather than manners is perhaps due to the same cause.\r\n\r\np. 25. _At the school._ The inference seems to be that they would learn\r\nmanners there.\r\n\r\np. 25. _Quoth Kate._ The same name occurs at the end of the three next\r\npoems as they appear in MS. Ashmole 61. It is probably a corruption,\r\nunless we have here one of the rare instances of a woman copyist. _Cato_\r\nsuggests itself as the most likely original; and in this way. He was\r\nundoubtedly identified with the _Wise Man_, as appears from the _Luytel\r\nCaton_ of the Vernon MS. (see p. 189, below). Accordingly, _Quod Cato_\r\nmight have stood at the end of this poem, and have become confused with\r\nKate from Katharine or Catherine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STANS PUER AD MENSAM\r\n\r\nThis must have been a popular form of the maxims, as many MSS. still\r\nexist. The translation is made from MS. Lambeth 853, fol. 150, about\r\n1430, with occasional references to Harl. 2251, fol. 153 (148), about\r\n1460(?). A much longer and more tedious (250 lines, instead of 99)\r\nversion was printed by Dr. Furnivall in _Queene Eliz. Achad._, from MS.\r\nAshmole 61. This last quotes _Grostum Caput_, _i.e._, Grossetete, and\r\nrefers several times to “Dr. Palere,” of whom nothing seems to be known.\r\nThe Ashmole version, however, contains several interesting points not\r\nmentioned in the other two:—\r\n\r\n              “Thy elbow and arms have in thy thought,\r\n                Too far on the table do them not lay.”\r\n\r\n              “And if thou see any man reading a letter,\r\n                Come not too nigh him for dread of blame.”\r\n\r\n        “And if thou go with any man in field or in town,\r\n          By wall or by hedge, by palace or by pale,\r\n         To go without (outside) him, look thou be bown (ready),\r\n          And take him betwixt thee and that same wall;\r\n         And if thou meet him, look thou be sure\r\n          That thou go without him, and leave him next the wall.”\r\n\r\n          “Stare not on a strange man too much, be thou ware.”\r\n\r\n              “Nor never mock an old man, though he be old.”\r\n\r\nVarious other MSS. are (1) Jesus College, Cambridge (Q.T. 8, printed by\r\nWright & Halliwell, in _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, I., 156-58), (2) Cotton\r\nCaligula A ii, Harl. 4011, Lansdowne 699, Additional 5467, &c. It was\r\nprinted once by Caxton, and several times by Wynkyn de Worde.\r\n\r\nThe only reason for considering John Lydgate as the author lies in the\r\nattribution to him in the last stanza (see next page).\r\n\r\np. 27. _Indict._ Text: edwite, modern, twit.\r\n\r\np. 30. _Ah, little ballad_, &c. The Harl. text reads:\r\n\r\n           “Go, little bill, barren of eloquence,\r\n              Pray young children that thee shall see or read,\r\n            Though thou be compendious of sentence,\r\n              Of thy clauses for to take heed,\r\n              Which to all virtue shall their youth lead.\r\n            Of the writing, though there be no date,\r\n              If aught be amiss in word, syllable, or deed,\r\n            Put all the default upon John Lydgate.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HOW THE GOOD WIFE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nMS. Lambeth 853, p. 102, about 1430, written without breaks. Other MSS.\r\nare Trinity College, Cambridge, R. 3, 19, and Ashmole 61, p. 7 (printed\r\nin _Queene Elizabethes Achademy_), a later and inferior text, which\r\ncontains, however, a fresh and interesting stanza:\r\n\r\n            “And if it thus thee betide,\r\n             That friends fail thee on every side,\r\n             And God from thee thy child take,\r\n             Thy wreak (vengeance) on God thou must not take,\r\n             For thyself it will undo\r\n             And all thews (virtues) that thee ’longs to.\r\n             Many a one for her own folly,\r\n             Spills (destroys) themselves unthriftily.”\r\n\r\nMS. Porkington 10, p. 135 back, about 1460-70 contained a variant form\r\n_The Good Wife Would a Pilgrimage_, _i.e._, before she sets out for the\r\nHoly Land, she leaves instructions for her daughter. This version\r\n(printed in _Queene Eliz. Achad._) is interesting for its proverbs:\r\n\r\n                  “The loth (hated) child behoves lore,\r\n                   And lief child much more.”\r\n\r\n                  “Seldom mosseth the stone,\r\n                   That oft is turned and wend.”\r\n\r\n                  “A fool’s bolt is soon shot\r\n                   And doth but little good.”\r\n\r\n                  “When deed is done, it is too late;\r\n                   Beware of ‘Had I wist.’”\r\n\r\nA third version was printed in 1597 under the title, _The Northern\r\nMother’s Blessing_. Written nine years before the death of G. Chaucer.\r\nTogether with it a short poem: _The Way to Thrift_. This contains\r\nseveral different and interesting stanzas.\r\n\r\nIt begins:\r\n\r\n         “God would that every wife that dwelleth in this land,\r\n          Would teach her daughter as ye shall understand,\r\n          As a good wife did of the North countré\r\n          How her daughter should learn a good wife to be:\r\n               For lack of the mother’s teaching\r\n               Makes the daughter of evil living,\r\n                       My lief dear child.”\r\n\r\nAnother is:\r\n\r\n          “In other men’s houses make thee no mastery,\r\n           Nor blame thou nothing thou sees with thine eye;\r\n           Daughter, I thee pray, bear thee so well\r\n           That all men may say thou art true as steel;\r\n                For wise men and old\r\n                Say good name is worth gold,\r\n                        My lief dear child.\r\n\r\n          Sit not at even too long at gaze with the cup,\r\n          For to wassail and drink all up;\r\n          So to bed betimes, at morn rise belive,\r\n          And so may thou better learn to thrive.\r\n                He that will a good house keep,\r\n                Must oft times break a sleep,\r\n                        My lief dear child.\r\n\r\n          If it betide, daughter, thy friend from thee fall,\r\n          And God send thee children that for bread will call,\r\n          And thou have mickle need, help little or none,\r\n          Thou must then care and spare, hard as the stone—\r\n                For evil that may betide,\r\n                A man before should dread,\r\n                        My lief dear child.”\r\n\r\nThe order of the stanzas is different from that here printed.\r\n\r\nThe rhyme-scheme is normally aabbccd; but the first, second,\r\nseventeenth, and last stanzas are irregular—abcddc, ababcdcdeef,\r\naabbccdde, and aaaa, thus varying in both number and arrangement of\r\nlines. The first four verses contain roughly the same number of accents,\r\nthe fifth and sixth vary greatly in length, while the seventh is a\r\nconstant refrain to all stanzas except the first and last.\r\n\r\nThe poem is distinctly popular in tone; and I have seldom attempted to\r\nimprove its rough metre, holding that the effect is racier as it is.\r\n\r\np. 31. _Kirk._ Text has _church_, but the rhyme is _work_.\r\n\r\np. 32. _Thrive ... life._ The corresponding couplets are usually\r\nproverbial in character.\r\n\r\np. 33. _Whatsoever he be._ Apparently on the basis that “e’er a man is\r\nbetter than ne’er a man.”\r\n\r\np. 33. _Atterling._ Literally, one who deals in poisons (O. E. _ator_);\r\nhence, a witch; hence, a shrew.\r\n\r\np. 34. _Maze._ Without the help of the N.E.D., the word is puzzling; but\r\nthe context seems to demand _maze_, connected with _amaze_, rather than\r\n_maze_ = _labyrinth_.\r\n\r\np. 35. _Shooting at the cock._ The popular old English pastime of\r\nthrowing missiles to bring down a cock tied by the leg.\r\n\r\np. 37. _Deed ... speed._ The meaning is that a deed finished quickly\r\nhelps on another by giving place to it.\r\n\r\np. 38. _Term-day._ Servants were hired by the year at special times\r\nwhich varied according to the district, being usually coincident with\r\nthe big fairs of that part. Michaelmas was a usual time.\r\n\r\np. 40. _As a wren hath veins._ The wren is so small that but little\r\nblood can be let from her veins. Put more strongly: “You cannot squeeze\r\nblood out of a stone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOW THE WISE MAN TAUGHT HIS SON\r\n\r\nFound in various MSS. The version in _The Babees’ Book_ is printed from\r\nLambeth 853, fol. 186. Another is given in _Queene Eliz. Achad._ from\r\nAshmole 61, fol. 6. Ritson, in his _Ancient Popular Poetry_, printed\r\nHarl. 4596, and Hazlitt, in his _Early Popular Poetry_, MS. Camb. Ff.\r\nll. _Luytel Caton_\r\n\r\n(Part II., Minor Poems of the Vernon MS., published by Dr. Furnivall,\r\n1902) says:—\r\n\r\n                 “Now whoso will, he may hear\r\n                      In English language,\r\n                  How the Wise Man taught his Son,\r\n                      That was of tender age” (ll. 5-8).\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this poem was written in imitation of the\r\npreceding, or that of this, but the _Wise Man_, through its connection\r\nwith Cato, has the longer pedigree. A poem in the _Exeter Book_ begins:\r\n“Thus a wise father (_frodfæder_) instructed his dear son, a parent wise\r\nin mind, old in virtues, sagacious in words,” &c. Although I have not\r\nbeen able to compare the different versions in detail, I incline to\r\nbelieve that there are recognisable links between them all. _The Good\r\nWife_ is, however, much the more vivid and amusing of the two.\r\n\r\nThe metre is ababbcbc, but the poem loses little by being turned into\r\nprose.\r\n\r\np. 47. _All that there is._ This passage suggests one in the _Blickling\r\nHomilies_ (No. VIII. _Soul’s Need_, ed. Morris), which goes back to St.\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     JOHN RUSSELL’S BOOK OF NURTURE\r\n\r\nFirst printed by Dr. Furnivall from MS. Harl. 4011, fols. 171-89, dated\r\nabout 1460. Other copies are in Sloane 1315, fols. 49-67 and 2027, fols.\r\n1-15b, supposed to be slightly earlier in date; also, Royal 17 D xv.,\r\narticle 5.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the author beyond what he himself says, that he was\r\nusher and marshal to Duke Humphrey of Gloucester (regent during the\r\nminority of Henry VI.). He was seemingly an old man and a widower before\r\nthe death of Duke Humphrey, who was murdered in 1447. This seems to be\r\nsuggested by the fact that he asks the reader’s prayers for Duke\r\nHumphrey (as the King is prayed for to-day) and then for the souls of\r\nhis wife and his parents. If then he was forced to retire from court by\r\nold age (as he says in another place, see p. 77, above) some time before\r\n1447, he might have been born even before 1360, and studied his courtesy\r\nunder Edward III., or at the very latest under Richard ll.\r\n\r\nThe device of wandering in the country and there meeting with some one\r\nwho furnishes the subject of the poem was extensively used by Chaucer\r\nand his school, derived by them in turn from French poets of the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe long lines and pompous metre which he uses I have employed\r\noccasionally, where the subject permitted that form, to show the effect.\r\nThe whole production done that way would become insufferably tedious.\r\n\r\np. 49. “Is thy governance good?” Practically, “Do you behave well?”\r\n\r\np. 50. _Smooth and square the trenchers with._ At this time, still made\r\nof stale wholemeal bread; later, of wood.\r\n\r\np. 51. _Linen clouts._ To stop up holes?\r\n\r\np. 52. _Couleur de rose._ A red wine, classified under malmsey (and\r\ntherefore Greek?), mentioned in the _Interlude of the Four Elements_.\r\n\r\np. 52. _New ale is wasteful_, _i.e._, people can drink so much of it\r\nbecause it is not intoxicating.\r\n\r\np. 52. _Stale drink._ Perhaps an allusion to the lead poisoning which is\r\nknown to result from drinking ale that has stood in a pewter pot for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\np. 52. _Cowche._ Any sort of cover. Used perhaps as nowadays to lessen\r\nthe noise and save the board.\r\n\r\np. 53. _Lay a second cloth._ I understand this to mean that one linen\r\ncloth was not wide enough to cover the table and to hang down\r\nsufficiently; hence, that two were used, overlapping in the middle, and\r\nhanging down on each side. By following the directions, literally, it is\r\npossible to see what is meant. The _outer_ edge, I take to be that\r\nnearest the centre of the room, the _inner_, next to the wall.\r\n\r\np. 53. _State._ A fold or some other ornamental arrangement of the\r\ntable-cloth. The usher or sewer seems to have twisted or curled it with\r\nhis rod.\r\n\r\np. 53. _Put a towel round your neck._ The achievement described in the\r\nfollowing lines is quite possible, if the loaves are small, and makes\r\nquite a “mannerly” appearance.\r\n\r\np. 54. _Rennes cloth._ Made at Rennes in Brittany, and frequently\r\nmentioned in the romances.\r\n\r\np. 54. _Fold it lengthwise_, &c. This performance was possibly to give\r\nan appearance of cleanliness. The best way to understand the process is\r\nto take a towel and try; it is not so complicated as it sounds.\r\n\r\np. 55. _Surnape._ This again becomes simple by experiment. The pleat or\r\ndoubling about a foot from the end of the table, is probably to avoid\r\nletting the long cloth fall to the door. When the triple thickness of\r\ncloth has been pushed and pulled across the table by the butler and\r\nmarshal, the pleat is smoothed out and the cloth hangs from eighteen to\r\nthirty inches over each end.\r\n\r\np. 55. _Sewer._ Fr. _esculier_, Lat. _scutellarius_, whence also is\r\nderived _scullery_. The sewer’s office was practically to bring and\r\narrange the dishes.\r\n\r\np. 57. _Winking and watering._ More or less difficult in the days of\r\nprimitive chimneys, or no chimneys at all.\r\n\r\np. 60. _Upper crust._ In the old ovens, which were heated by faggots\r\nwithdrawn before the bread was put in, this was even more distinctly the\r\nbest part.\r\n\r\np. 60. _Carving of flesh_, &c. This more properly belongs in a book\r\ngiven over to recipes and the like, as the description of the dishes is\r\nmore interesting than the special knack of serving each one.\r\n\r\np. 62. _Need not fear_, &c. Almost the only suggestion of any indignity\r\nin the service.\r\n\r\np. 63. _He ... and look you._ The change of person is Russell’s.\r\n\r\np. 63. _As brown as a water-leech._ Is the allusion possibly to shoes of\r\ndark-brown colour? Leeches are usually described as black.\r\n\r\np. 65. _Bankers._ Translated _bench-covers_; but the context suggests\r\nrather _bolsters_. The bench-covers were doubtless cushions; hence the\r\ntransition from the one meaning to the other is easy.\r\n\r\np. 67. _By the license of his estate._ This seems to point to a\r\nSumptuary Law. In 1483, it was decreed that none under the rank of a\r\nlord might wear cloth of gold, none under a knight, velvet, &c.\r\n\r\np. 67. _Wound._ A sort of turban?\r\n\r\np. 67. _Paris-candle_ or _percher_. A big candle of the sort commonly\r\nused on altars.\r\n\r\np. 68. _Medicinable Bath._ A sort of Turkish bath with herbs added. Some\r\nof those mentioned were known for their curative properties, even in\r\nSaxon times, as hollyhock, mallow, centaury, fennel, heyriff, daisy,\r\nbrooklime, ribwort, flax, willow. Mallow was supposed to be good for\r\nwounds. Wall pellitory contains nitrate of potash. Fennel is still used\r\nas a home remedy. Heyhove is bitter and aromatic, abounding in a\r\nprinciple similar to camphor. Heyriff used to be applied externally for\r\nscurvy, and is said to be still used in France (taken internally) for\r\nepilepsy. Scabious was once thought valuable for various diseases,\r\nprimarily the itch, but also coughs, pleurisy, &c. Danewort was\r\ntraditionally thought to have sprung up whenever there had been an\r\nencounter between the English and the Danes; it is a dwarf elder valued\r\nfor its purgative properties. Centaury was so named from the legend that\r\nby it Chiron the Centaur was cured. It is gentianaceous and valuable as\r\na bitter. Herb-bennet, _herba benedicta_, the blessed herb, was supposed\r\nto be particularly efficacious in keeping away the devil. It was perhaps\r\nhemlock, or wild valerian. St. John’s wort seems to have been a neutral\r\nelement, although it may have been added for some special reason.\r\nBresewort or bruisewort is the common daisy, once highly valued for its\r\ngeneral medicinal properties. Bugloss (text, _bilgres_) was valued as a\r\nblood-purifier. Camomile is still used in home medicine.\r\n\r\np. 70. _Mayor of Calais._ Because this was the one French port that\r\ncontinued to be held by the English after the Hundred Years’ War until\r\nthe reign of Queen Mary. This officer was also called “Mayor of the\r\nStaple,” because of the wool-trade carried on through Calais. See p. 71,\r\nabove.\r\n\r\np. 71. _Golden royal rod._ A prince who was crowned in his father’s\r\nlife-time? In 1343, the Black Prince was invested with a gold circlet\r\nand ring, and silver rod, by Edward III.; so, likewise Henry V., in\r\n1399, received a coronet, ring and golden rod.\r\n\r\np. 72. _Bishop of Canterbury_, &c. This means only that neither\r\narchbishop had jurisdiction over the see of the other.\r\n\r\np. 73. _Groom_, _i.e._, receive each as if he were one degree higher\r\nthan his actual estate.\r\n\r\np. 74. _Queenborough._ A small port near the mouth of the Thames, on the\r\nisland of Sheppey.\r\n\r\np. 74. _Abbot of Westminster._ The yearly rental, as quoted by Dr.\r\nFurnivall from _Valor Ecclesiarum_ I., pp. 410-24, was £4470, 0s. 2d.;\r\nof Tintern, £258, 5s. 10d. (_Val. Ecc._ IV., 370-71).\r\n\r\np. 74. _Prior of Dudley._ The value of this quoted by Dr. Furnivall was\r\n£34, 1s. 4d. over against Canterbury at £163, 1s. 9d. (_Val. Ecc._ III.,\r\npp. 4-5, and I., 27-32).\r\n\r\np. 75. _Whether the cook be lief or loth._ A hint that the cook was not\r\nalways duly subordinate.\r\n\r\np. 78. “_Go forth, little book_,” &c. The _Envoi_ presents a problem\r\nwhich at present I cannot solve. The question is, how much of the “copy”\r\nhere is the same as the treatise used by Russell in his youth, and\r\nwhether another writer adds an _Envoi_ explaining how he has improved\r\nRussell’s work, while the latter is referring to a still earlier work.\r\nThere is every probability that Russell’s own work ends with the request\r\nfor prayers, which includes the mention of the author’s name, and\r\nconcludes with _Amen_. And in support of this view is the fact that\r\nneither of the Sloane MSS., which seem earlier than the one translated,\r\ncontains either the _Envoi_ or Russell’s name. As I have not studied the\r\nrelation of the MSS. I hesitate to conjecture; but from the facts at my\r\ndisposal, I think it probable that the writer of the _Envoi_ alludes to\r\nRussell as the “fore writer,” and casts the blame for whatever faults\r\nmay be found, upon the treatise on which Russell himself declared his\r\nwork to be based. It would appear also that the writer of the _Envoi_\r\ndid not recognise Russell’s source. This may possibly have been the\r\n_Book of Courtesy_, which (especially in its third book) often\r\ncorresponds to Russell. Moreover, as it was written by a man who talked\r\nfamiliarly of John of Gaunt (see p. 112, above), who died in 1399, it\r\nagrees well enough with the date of the book used by Russell in his\r\nyouth; but, needless to say, there is no proof that they were the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BOOK OF COURTESY\r\n\r\nMS. Sloane 1986, about 1460. The text is either very corrupt, or the\r\nstyle is as rough as possible, lacking even the essentials of grammar.\r\nIt contains many Scotch words, and has certainly suffered in its rhymes,\r\nand probably in its sense through English copyists. The author\r\napparently remembered the institution of a custom at the court of John\r\nof Gaunt; hence it seems likely that he wrote before 1420.\r\n\r\np. 81. _Bakes._ Perhaps rolls into a ball or moulds, as this is a stage\r\nof baking.\r\n\r\np. 81. _Wallowing_, _i.e._, rolling the morsel about.\r\n\r\np. 83. _Chare._ From the O. E. verb _to turn_; hence, a turn either at\r\nplay as here (trick) or at work, as in the compound _charwoman_.\r\n\r\np. 85. _Cross-Christ thee speed._ The same oath occurs in _Sir Gawayne\r\nand the Green Knight_, l. 762; but I do not remember it elsewhere. The\r\norder of the first two words is commonly _Christ-cross_, as in\r\n“Christ-cross-row” (alphabet). The inversion is possibly a sign of\r\ntranslation from the French.\r\n\r\np. 86. _On both knees._ So in _Liber Faceti_.\r\n\r\n             “Quando Deo servis utrumque genu sibi flecte;\r\n              Ast homini solum reliquum teneas sibi recte.”\r\n\r\np. 88. _The adder._ “The nedder,” as the text puts it quaintly, in the\r\nold, correct form. The serpent in _Genesis_.\r\n\r\np. 88. _Mysloset._ Apparently from the root _lose_; hence, to lose\r\namiss, _i.e._, to lead astray; but the form appears to be passive, not\r\nactive. Perhaps the idea is that the serpent himself was _lost_ for his\r\nwickedness; but this seems far-fetched.\r\n\r\np. 89. _Solace ... makes._ One of the many traces of Scotch. The\r\noriginal rhyme must have been _mas_.\r\n\r\np. 90. _St. Ambrose._ Archbishop of Milan, 340-97. He wrote an ethical\r\ntreatise _De Officiis Ministrorum_, in imitation of Cicero’s _De\r\nOfficiis_; but whether or not this injunction is found therein, it\r\noccurs in almost the same words in _Liber Faceti_:—\r\n\r\n                “Si videas aliquem casurum siue cadentem,\r\n                 Non ride: sed ei te prebe compatientem.”\r\n\r\np. 90. _More and less._ If _at_ means _that_, the sense is, that\r\neverybody understands it; but the context seems to call for the meaning:\r\nthat you yourself do not fully understand.\r\n\r\np. 91. _Opens his lip._ Text:—\r\n\r\n               “Lest men say to gossip or couth (friend),\r\n                Yonder is a man without mouth.”\r\n\r\np. 91. _To staunch_, &c. So in _Liber Faceti_:\r\n\r\n             “Si videas fratres inter se bella gerentes,\r\n              Neutri confer opem; sed eorum corrige mentes.”\r\n\r\np. 92. _Three oxen_, &c. Another proverbial voicing of “Two’s company,\r\nthree’s none.”\r\n\r\np. 93. _Red man_, _i.e._, red-haired. Presumably this distrust of\r\nred-haired people as treacherous was based on the old tradition that\r\nJudas was red-haired.\r\n\r\np. 93. _His courtesy_, &c. The meaning is: he must needs be discourteous\r\nwho stirs fingers and toes, &c.\r\n\r\np. 96. _Stocks with him._ Doubtless, because the castle gate would be\r\nthe most conspicuous place of punishment.\r\n\r\np. 96. _What he will deem._ What judgment he will pronounce by law.\r\n\r\np. 96. _Wesselle clothes._ The meaning is not clear. Dr. Furnivall\r\nsuggests _vessel-cloths_; but the phrase is still doubtful unless it\r\nalludes to ecclesiastical coverings, which, however, would not be in the\r\nporter’s keeping, and which would certainly not be sold. Possibly,\r\n_wassail-clothes_, _i.e._, garments kept perhaps for occasions of\r\nspecial revelry; or, it may be, the sense is that the porter must keep a\r\nlook-out that vessels _and_ clothes, in general, be not stolen and sold\r\nby servants or others.\r\n\r\np. 96. _Sits with him_, &c., _i.e._, he chooses his own companions.\r\n\r\np. 97. _Four pence apiece._ Dr. Furnivall found statutes against\r\nexcessive prices, but no stipulation of the sum mentioned. Perhaps it\r\nwas the fixed price in the author’s shire. It is cheap enough, only four\r\nshillings, at the outside.\r\n\r\np. 97. _Cupboard._ Probably that in which the canopies and curtains were\r\nstored when not in use.\r\n\r\np. 98. _Liveries._ Not uniforms, but _deliveries_, _i.e._, of rations,\r\nor, as in this case, fuel for their own rooms.\r\n\r\np. 98. _Holly keen_, _i.e._, it filled the fireplace like an arbour from\r\nGood Friday until All Hallows Day.\r\n\r\np. 99. _On his yard score_, _i.e._, make notes by a sort of tally on the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\np. 99. _Six pence_, about five shillings to-day. According to Russell,\r\nfour ordinary persons made up a “mess.”\r\n\r\np. 99. _The cause he has it in score_, _i.e._, if the cook quarrels\r\nabout the expense, or the panter wants extra bread (reward) brought on.\r\nIn cases of dispute, the steward was referred to.\r\n\r\np. 100. _Shall harbour_, _i.e._, the marshal has charge of all other\r\nofficers, except the usher in the chamber. John Russell combined the two\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\np. 100. _Gentleman_, _yeoman-usher_, _i.e._, two, of different social\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\np. 100. _Make litter._ The making of a pallet-bed I understand as\r\nfollows. The mattress is nine feet by seven, made of loose straw, for\r\nthe most part; but with a sort of framework on all four sides, made of\r\nbundles (wisps) of straw to keep the sides firm and the great mass of\r\nstraw in its place; and the whole is to be kept level. Text: _On legh\r\nunsunken_, which seems to mean, not in hills and dales.\r\n\r\np. 101. _As a man by the neck_, _i.e._, the button was put into a loop\r\nresembling a noose. The end of the line is not clear. Perhaps (1) the\r\nman hangs light as the flesh drops from his bones on the gallows; (2)\r\nthe button hangs light because it has no body; (3) the adjective was\r\ndragged in for the rhyme.\r\n\r\np. 102. _Boards_, _trestles_, &c. For the chamber only, as I understand\r\nit, the hall having its own groom.\r\n\r\np. 104. _In strong stead_ (text, _styd_) _on pallet he lay_. The line is\r\ncertainly corrupt, and I can make no sense of it. From the context I\r\ngather that _lay_ is the present optative of the verb meaning to place,\r\nnot the past tense of _lie_. _He_ seems to refer to the servant, as in\r\nthe next line, and not to the master who is already “winking.” In that\r\ncase _In_ (Sc., _ane_?) _strong stead_ must represent something that he\r\nplaces on the pallet—what, I do not know.\r\n\r\np. 105. _Many are false._ So often in the romances of the time.\r\n\r\np. 105. _Wax so green._ Seemingly the steward’s accounts were kept first\r\non tablets, and afterwards copied into books.\r\n\r\np. 106. _Surveyor._ His duty was to examine the dishes and see that\r\neverything was right before it went to the table.\r\n\r\np. 112. _Duke John’s house._ As his father was king, the man referred to\r\nmust be John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who died 1399.\r\n\r\np. 112. [_Wide_]. The passage seems corrupt. The text says:—\r\n\r\n                “The selvage to the lord’s side within,\r\n                 And down shall hang that other may win.”\r\n\r\np. 118. _Starven._ Starved is still used, dialectically, to mean, nearly\r\ndying of cold.\r\n\r\np. 119. _Will eat._ Russell, in his directions to the carver, specifies\r\nchoice bits, as the wings (first left, then right) of capon or hen; the\r\nlegs of quail, lark or pigeon; of fawn, kid, lamb, first the kidney,\r\nthen the rib; shoulder, then rib of pork, sides of rabbit or hare, &c.\r\n\r\np. 119. _Lief and dear._ This seems to mean only that he might, if he\r\nliked, keep a choice bit for a stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SYMON’S LESSON OF WISDOM FOR\r\n                          ALL MANNER CHILDREN\r\n\r\nMS. Bodley 832, fol. 174, about 1500. It seems to be unique, and of the\r\nauthor or copyist I know nothing.\r\n\r\np. 123. _Wall._ The passage suggests Lydgate’s poem, giving an account\r\nof his school-days, especially:—\r\n\r\n                “Ran into gardens, apples there I stole,\r\n                 To gather fruits spared hedge nor wall,\r\n                 To pluck grapes in other men’s vines\r\n                 Was more ready than for to say matins.”\r\n\r\np. 124. _Schate._ The context seems to demand the meaning fence; but the\r\nnearest to the form given here seems to be the Scotch _skathie_.\r\n\r\np. 125. _When he is passed._ The allusion seems to be to a middle-class\r\nboy in a cathedral school, who, as a chorister perhaps, would be\r\nfamiliar with the bishop’s presence, to whom therefore the reference\r\nwould be pertinent and vivid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HUGH RHODES’S BOOK OF NURTURE\r\n\r\n_The Boke of Nurture, or School of Good Manners for Men, Servants, and\r\nChildren, with Stans Puer Ad Mensam, newly corrected, being necessary\r\nfor all youth and children._ The British Museum contains three early\r\neditions, of 1550 [?], 1568, and 1577; and Dr. Furnivall mentions two\r\nothers as printed between 1551 and 1586.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable difference between the editions of 1550 [?] and\r\n1568, and that of 1577. H. Jackson, the printer, or some unknown editor\r\neither worked from a very imperfect copy or wilfully altered the meaning\r\nin many cases; and further, broke up the long rhyming couplets of the\r\noriginal into stanzas of four short lines, the second and fourth\r\nrhyming. Naturally, the first and third contain the greatest number of\r\nchanges. I have used the oldest edition, only modernising the spelling,\r\nherein departing from Dr. Furnivall, who printed from that of 1577.\r\n\r\n_The Book of Nurture_, which forms the main body of the work, is\r\npreceded by _The Duties of Parents and Masters_, _The Manner of Serving\r\na Knight, Squire, or Gentleman_, and _How to Order your Master’s Chamber\r\nat Night to Bedward_, all in prose, and is followed by a poem _For the\r\nWaiting Servant_, which I have omitted as more adapted to grown\r\nserving-men than to children, and by various rules and maxims.\r\n\r\nFrom the colophon we learn that the author was Hugh Rhodes of the King’s\r\nChapel, who early in the poem declares himself “born and bred in\r\nDevonshire,” as his language showed. However, I can discover no traces\r\nof dialect.\r\n\r\nNothing further is known of him. The probabilities are that he was\r\nMaster of the chapel children, whose duty it was to direct their\r\nsinging, and generally look after them and order their behaviour; but\r\nhis name does not seem to appear on any royal household list, as far as\r\nI have observed.\r\n\r\np. 127. _Briefs and longs._ Expressed in musical terms, perhaps because\r\nRhodes was a music-master.\r\n\r\np. 128. _You ... thee ... thy._ These pronouns seem throughout to be\r\nused indiscriminately, referring to the same antecedent, and so I have\r\nretained them.\r\n\r\np. 135. _Phantasy._ Here _taste_, _inclination_. Obsolete. See N.E.D.,\r\n_Fantasy_ 7.\r\n\r\np. 136. _Stick._ Probably toothpick. Erasmus wrote of them twenty years\r\nbefore. Cf. _Introduction_, p. xxvii. But indeed we read in Old English\r\nof a “tooth-spear.”\r\n\r\np. 138. _Checkmate._ Perhaps the meaning is: done for, as far as manners\r\nare concerned. But later editions read _Jack-mate_, of which the sense\r\nseems to be: that, you think yourself as good as he, _i.e._, your action\r\nshows too great familiarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FRANCIS SEAGER’S SCHOOL OF VIRTUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title continues: _and Book of Good Nurture for Children and Youth to\r\nLearn their Duty by. Newly perused, corrected and augmented by the first\r\nAuctor, F.S. With a brief declaration of the duty of each degree._ Anno\r\n1557, &c.\r\n\r\nThis indicates plainly that there had been an earlier edition. Seager\r\nwas a poet and translator who flourished 1549-63. He seems to have come\r\nof a Devonshire family, and was perhaps the Francis Nicholson, _alias_\r\nSeager, who was made free of the Stationers’ Company in 1557. Among\r\nother things, he translated from Alain Chartier, and also made a\r\nrendering of the Psalms. His _School of Virtue_ shows as little\r\noriginality as poetic merit, but it seems to have been popular in his\r\nday and long after, as it was revised by Robert Crowley and extended by\r\nRichard Weste during the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RICHARD WESTE’S SCHOOL OF VIRTUE\r\n\r\nThis was printed in 1619, and about fifty years later was added to an\r\nedition of Seager, revised and extended by Robert Crowley; hence, the\r\nsub-title, “the Second Part.” Weste’s treatise is believed to be unique.\r\nOf its contents, Dr. Furnivall published only _Demeanour in Serving at\r\nthe Table_, from Bensley’s reprint, 1817.\r\n\r\np. 161. _Gellius._ Flourished in the second century A.D., and wrote the\r\nfamous commonplace book, _Noctes Atticæ_.\r\n\r\np. 163. _Serve God_, &c., alludes perhaps to serving at table.\r\n\r\np. 164. _Glumly._ Text: _glouting_.\r\n\r\np. 164. _Hedgehogs’ right_, _i.e._, be not bristling with frowns.\r\n\r\np. 164. _Nor imitate with Socrates._ From this it would seem that\r\nSocrates, like Vergil, was roughly handled in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\np. 165. _Stork ... elephant._ The idea seems to be: don’t make\r\noutlandish noises.\r\n\r\np. 166. _Like an image pictured_, &c. Sixteenth-century pictures of the\r\nwinds are commonly so drawn.\r\n\r\np. 167. _The lips set close_, &c.
