JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSteel Engr. F. von Egloffstein, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site now occupied by the two cities of New York and Brooklyn, and\r\nover which they continue to spread, is pre-eminently \"Revolutionary\r\nsoil.\" Very few of our historic places are more closely associated\r\nwith the actual scenes of that struggle. As at Boston in 1775, so here\r\nin 1776, we had the war at our doors and all about us. In what is now\r\nthe heart of Brooklyn Revolutionary soldiers lay encamped for months,\r\nand in the heat of a trying summer surrounded themselves with lines of\r\nworks. What have since been converted into spots of rare\r\nbeauty--Greenwood Cemetery and Prospect Park--became, with the ground\r\nin their vicinity, a battle-field. New York, which was then taking its\r\nplace as the most flourishing city on the continent, was transformed\r\nby the emergency into a fortified military base. Troops quartered in\r\nBroad Street and along the North and East rivers, and on the line of\r\nGrand Street permanent camps were established. Forts, redoubts,\r\nbatteries, and intrenchments encircled the town. The streets were\r\nbarricaded, the roads blocked, and efforts made to obstruct the\r\nnavigation of both rivers. Where we have stores and warehouses,\r\nWashington fixed alarm and picket posts; and at points where costly\r\nresidences stand, men fought, died, and were buried. In 1776 the cause\r\nhad become general; soldiers gathered here from ten of the original\r\nthirteen States, and the contest assumed serious proportions. It was\r\nhere around New York and Brooklyn that the War of the Revolution began\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\nThe record of what occurred in this vicinity at that interesting\r\nperiod has much of it been preserved in our standard histories by\r\nGordon, Marshall, Irving, Hildreth, Lossing, Bancroft, Carrington, and\r\nothers. In the present volume it is given as a single connected\r\naccount, with many additional particulars which have but recently come\r\nto light. This new material, gathered largely from the descendants of\r\nofficers and soldiers who participated in that campaign, is published\r\nwith other documents in Part II. of this work, and is presented as its\r\nprincipal feature. What importance should be attached to it must be\r\nleft to the judgment of the reader.\r\n\r\nThe writer himself has made use of these documents in filling gaps and\r\ncorrecting errors. Such documents, for example, as the orders issued\r\nby Generals Greene and Sullivan on Long Island, with the original\r\nletters of Generals Parsons, Scott, and other officers, go far towards\r\nclearing up the hitherto doubtful points in regard to operations on\r\nthe Brooklyn side. There is not a little, also, that throws light on\r\nthe retreat to New York; while material of value has been unearthed\r\nrespecting events which terminated in the capture of the city by the\r\nBritish. Considerable space has been devoted to the preparations made\r\nby both sides for the campaign, but as the nature of those\r\npreparations illustrates the very great importance attached to the\r\nstruggle that was to come, it may not appear disproportionate. The\r\nnarrative also is continued so as to include the closing incidents of\r\nthe year, without which it would hardly be complete, although they\r\ntake us beyond the limits of New York.\r\n\r\nBut for the cheerful and in many cases painstaking co-operation of\r\nthose who are in possession of the documents referred to, or who have\r\notherwise rendered assistance, the preparation of the work could not\r\nhave been possible. The writer finds himself especially under\r\nobligations to Miss Harriet E. Henshaw, of Leicester, Mass.; Miss Mary\r\nLittle and Benjamin Hale, Esq., Newburyport; Charles J.

That this was no undue alarm,\r\npublished for effect, but a well-grounded and urgent warning to the\r\ncountry, is confirmed by the situation at the time and the whole train\r\nof events that followed. The campaign of 1776 did indeed prove to be a\r\ncrisis, a turning-point, in the fortunes of the Revolution. It is not\r\ninvesting it with an exaggerated importance, to claim that it was the\r\ndecisive period of the war; that, whatever anxieties and fears were\r\nsubsequently experienced, this was the year in which the greatest\r\ndangers were encountered and passed. \"Should the united colonies be\r\nable to keep their ground this campaign,\" continued Hancock, \"I am\r\nunder no apprehensions on account of any future one.\" \"We expect a\r\nvery bloody summer in New York and Canada,\" wrote Washington to his\r\nbrother John Augustine, in May; and repeatedly, through the days of\r\npreparation, he represented to his troops what vital interests were at\r\nstake and how much was to depend upon their discipline and courage in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nBut let the significance of the campaign be measured by the record\r\nitself, to which the following pages are devoted. It will be found to\r\nhave been the year in which Great Britain made her most strenuous\r\nefforts to suppress the colonial revolt, and in which both sides\r\nmustered the largest forces raised during the war; the year in which\r\nthe issues of the contest were clearly defined and America first\r\nfought for independence; a year, for the most part, of defeats and\r\nlosses for the colonists, and when their faith and resolution were put\r\nto the severest test; but a year, also, which ended with a broad ray\r\nof hope, and whose hard experiences opened the road to final success.\r\nIt was the year from which we date our national existence. A period so\r\ninteresting and, in a certain sense, momentous is deserving of\r\nillustration with every fact and detail that can be gathered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was the occasion or necessity for this campaign; what the plans\r\nand preparations made for it both by the mother country and the\r\ncolonies?\r\n\r\nThe opening incidents of the Revolution, to which these questions\r\nrefer us, are a familiar chapter in its history. On the morning of the\r\n19th of April, 1775, an expedition of British regulars, moving out\r\nfrom Boston, came upon a company of provincials hastily forming on\r\nLexington Common, twelve miles distant. The attitude of these\r\ncountrymen represented the last step to which they had been driven by\r\nthe aggressive acts of the home Parliament. Up to this moment the\r\ncontroversy over colonial rights and privileges had been confined,\r\nfrom the days of the Stamp Act, to argument, protest, petition, and\r\nlegislative proceedings; but these failing to convince or conciliate\r\neither party, it only remained for Great Britain to exercise her\r\nauthority in the case with force.\r\n\r\nThe expedition in question had been organized for the purpose of\r\nseizing the military stores belonging to the Massachusetts Colony,\r\nthen collected at Concord, and which the king's authorities regarded\r\nas too dangerous material to be in the hands of the people at that\r\nstage of the crisis. The provincials, on the other hand, watched them\r\njealously. King and Parliament might question their rights, block up\r\ntheir port, ruin their trade, proscribe their leaders, and they could\r\nbear all without offering open resistance. But the attempt to deprive\r\nthem of the means of self-defence at a time when the current of\r\naffairs clearly indicated that, sooner or later, they would be\r\ncompelled to defend themselves, was an act to which they would not\r\nsubmit, as already they had shown on more than one occasion. To no\r\nother right did the colonist cling more tenaciously at this juncture\r\nthan to his right to his powder. The men at Lexington, therefore, drew\r\nup on their village grounds, not defiantly, but in obedience to the\r\nmost natural impulse. Their position was a logical one. To have\r\nremained quietly in their homes would have been a stultification of\r\ntheir whole record from the beginning of the troubles; stand they\r\nmust, some time and somewhere. Under the circumstances, a collision\r\nbetween the king's troops and the provincials that morning was\r\ninevitable. The commander of the former, charged with orders to\r\ndisperse all \"rebels,\" made the sharp demand upon the Lexington\r\ncompany instantly to lay down their arms. A moment's confusion and\r\ndelay--then scattering shots--then a full volley from the\r\nregulars--and ten men fell dead and wounded upon the green. Here was a\r\nshock, the ultimate consequences of which few of the participants in\r\nthe scene could have forecast; but it was the alarm-gun of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nEvents followed rapidly. The march of the British to Concord, the\r\ndestruction of the stores, the skirmish at the bridge, and, later in\r\nthe day, the famous road-fight kept up by the farmers down to\r\nCharlestown, ending in the signal demoralization and defeat of the\r\nexpedition, combined with the Lexington episode to make the 19th of\r\nApril an historic date. The rapid spread of the news, the excitement\r\nin New England, the uprising of the militia and their hurried march to\r\nBoston to resist any further excursions of the regulars, were the\r\nimmediate consequence of this collision.\r\n\r\nNor was the alarm confined to the Eastern colonies, then chiefly\r\naffected. A courier delivered the news in New York three days later,\r\non Sunday noon, and the liberty party at once seized the public\r\nmilitary stores, and prevented vessels loaded with supplies for the\r\nBritish in Boston from leaving port. Soon came fuller accounts of the\r\nexpedition and its rout. Expresses carried them southward, and their\r\ncourse can be followed for nearly a thousand miles along the coast. On\r\nthe 23d and 24th they passed through Connecticut, where at Wallingford\r\nthe dispatches quaintly describe the turning out of the militiamen:\r\n\"The country beyond here are all gone.\" They reached New York at two\r\no'clock on the 25th, and Isaac Low countersigns. Relays taking them up\r\nin New Jersey, report at Princeton on the 26th, at \"3.30 A.M.\" They\r\nare at Philadelphia at noon, and \"forwarded at the same time.\" We\r\nfind them at New Castle, Delaware, at nine in the evening; at\r\nBaltimore at ten on the following night; at Alexandria, Virginia, at\r\nsunset on the 29th; at Williamsburg, May 2d; and at Edenton, North\r\nCarolina, on the 4th, with directions to the next Committee of Safety:\r\n\"Disperse the material passages [of the accounts] through all your\r\nparts.\" Down through the deep pine regions, stopping at Bath and\r\nNewbern, ride the horsemen, reaching Wilmington at 4 P.M. on the 8th.\r\n\"Forward it by night and day,\" say the committee. At Brunswick at nine\r\nthe indorsement is entered: \"Pray don't neglect a moment in\r\nforwarding.\" At Georgetown, South Carolina, where the dispatches\r\narrive at 6.30 P.M. on the 10th, the committee address a note to their\r\nCharleston brethren: \"We send you by express a letter and newspapers\r\nwith momentous intelligence this instant arrived.\" The news reaching\r\nSavannah, a party of citizens immediately took possession of the\r\ngovernment powder.\r\n\r\nThe wave of excitement which follows the signal of a coming struggle\r\nwas thus borne by its own force throughout the length of the colonies.\r\nAnd from the coast the intelligence spread inland as far as settlers\r\nhad found their way. In distant Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, men\r\nheard it, and began to organize and drill. At Charlotte, North\r\nCarolina, they sounded the first note for independence. From many\r\npoints brave and sympathetic words were sent to the people of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, and in all quarters people discussed the probable\r\neffect of the startling turn matters had taken in that colony. The\r\nlikelihood of a general rupture with the mother country now came to be\r\nseriously entertained.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the situation to the eastward assumed more and more a\r\nmilitary aspect. On the 10th of May occurred the surprise and\r\ncapture, by Ethan Allen and his party, of the important post of\r\nTiconderoga, where during the summer the provincials organized a force\r\nto march upon and, if possible, secure the Canadas. The Continental\r\nCongress at Philadelphia, after resolving that the issue had been\r\nforced upon them by Great Britain, voted to prepare for self-defence.\r\nThey adopted the New England troops, gathered around Boston, as a\r\nContinental force, and appointed Washington to the chief command. Then\r\non the 17th of June Bunker Hill was fought, that first regular action\r\nof the war, with its far-reaching moral effect; and following it came\r\nthe siege of Boston, or the hemming in of the British by the\r\nAmericans, until the former were finally compelled to evacuate the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is here in these culminating events of the spring and summer of\r\n1775 that we find the occasion for the preparations made by Great\r\nBritain for the campaign of 1776. Little appreciating the genius of\r\nthe colonists, underrating their resources and capacity for\r\nresistance, mistaking also their motives, King George and his party\r\nimagined that on the first display of England's power all disturbance\r\nand attempts at rebellion across the sea would instantly cease. But\r\nthe sudden transition from peace to war, and the complete mastery of\r\nthe situation which the colonists appeared to hold, convinced the home\r\ngovernment that \"the American business\" was no trifling trouble, to be\r\nreadily settled by a few British regiments. As the season advanced,\r\nthey began to realize the fact that General Gage, and then Howe\r\nsucceeding him, with their force of ten thousand choice troops, were\r\nhelplessly pent up in Boston; that Montreal and Quebec were\r\nthreatened; that colonists in the undisturbed sections were arming;\r\nand that Congress was supplanting the authority of Parliament. A more\r\nrigorous treatment of the revolt had become necessary; and as the time\r\nhad passed to effect any thing on a grand scale during the present\r\nyear, measures were proposed to crush all opposition in the next\r\ncampaign. Follow, briefly, the course of the British Government at\r\nthis crisis.\r\n\r\nParliament convened on the 26th day of October. The king's speech,\r\nwith which it opened, was necessarily devoted to the American\r\nquestion, and it declared his policy clearly and boldly. His\r\nrebellious subjects must be brought to terms. \"They have raised\r\ntroops,\" he said, \"and are collecting a naval force; they have seized\r\nthe public revenue, and assumed to themselves legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial powers, which they already exercise, in the most\r\narbitrary manner, over the persons and properties of their fellow\r\nsubjects: and although many of these unhappy people may still retain\r\ntheir loyalty, and may be too wise not to see the fatal consequence of\r\nthis usurpation and wish to resist it, yet the torrent of violence has\r\nbeen strong enough to compel their acquiescence, till a sufficient\r\nforce shall appear to support them. The authors and promoters of this\r\ndesperate conspiracy have, in the conduct of it, derived great\r\nadvantage from the difference of our intentions and theirs. They meant\r\nonly to amuse by vague expressions of attachment to the parent state,\r\nand the strongest protestations of loyalty to me, whilst they were\r\npreparing for a general revolt. On our part, though it was declared in\r\nyour last session that a rebellion existed within the province of the\r\nMassachusetts' Bay, yet even that province we wished rather to reclaim\r\nthan to subdue.... The rebellious war now levied is become more\r\ngeneral, and is manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing\r\nan independent empire. I need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the\r\nsuccess of such a plan.... It is now become the part of wisdom, and\r\n(in its effects) of clemency, to put a speedy end to these disorders,\r\nby the most decisive exertions. For this purpose, I have increased my\r\nnaval establishment, and greatly augmented my land forces, but in such\r\na manner as may be the least burthensome to my kingdoms. I have also\r\nthe satisfaction to inform you, that I have received the most friendly\r\noffers of foreign assistance, and if I shall make any treaties in\r\nconsequence thereof, they shall be laid before you.\"\r\n\r\nA stranger in Parliament, knowing nothing of the merits of the\r\ncontroversy, would have assumed from the tone of this speech that the\r\nhome government had been grossly wronged by the American colonists, or\r\nat least a powerful faction among them, and that their suppression was\r\na matter of national honor as well as necessity. But the speech was\r\ninexcusably unjust to the colonists. The charge of design and\r\ndouble-dealing could not be laid against them, for the ground of their\r\ngrievances had been the same from the outset, and their conduct\r\nconsistent with single motives; and if independence had been mentioned\r\nat all as yet, it was only as an ulterior resort, and not as an aim or\r\nambition. The king and the Ministry, on the other hand, were wedded to\r\nstrict notions of authority in the central government, and measured a\r\ncitizen's fidelity by the readiness with which he submitted to its\r\npolicy and legislation. Protests and discussion about \"charters\" and\r\n\"liberties\" were distasteful to them, and whoever disputed Parliament\r\nin any case was denounced as strong-headed and factious. The king's\r\nspeech, therefore, was no more than what was expected from him. It\r\nreflected the sentiments of the ruling party.\r\n\r\nAs usual, motions were made in both houses that an humble address in\r\nreply be presented to his Majesty, professing loyalty to his person,\r\nand supporting his views and measures. The mover in the Commons was\r\nThomas Ackland, who, in the course of his speech at the time, strongly\r\nurged the policy of coercion, and emphasized his approval of it by\r\ndeclaring that it would have been better for his country that America\r\nhad never been known than that \"a great consolidated western empire\"\r\nshould exist independent of Britain. Lyttleton, who seconded the\r\nmotion, was equally uncompromising. He objected to making the\r\nAmericans any further conciliatory offers, and insisted that they\r\nought to be conquered first before mercy was shown them.\r\n\r\nThe issue thus fairly stated by and for the government immediately\r\nroused the old opposition, that \"ardent and powerful opposition,\" as\r\nGibbon, who sat in the Commons, describes it; and again the House\r\nechoed to attack and invective. Burke, Fox, Conway, Barré, Dunning,\r\nand others, who on former occasions had cheered America with their\r\nstout defence of her rights, were present at this session to resist\r\nany further attempt to impair them. Of the leading spirits, Chatham,\r\nnow disabled from public service, alone was absent.\r\n\r\nLord John Cavendish led the way on this side, by moving a substitute\r\nfor Ackland's address which breathed a more moderate spirit, and in\r\neffect suggested to his Majesty that the House review the whole of the\r\nlate proceedings in the colonies, and apply, in its own way, the most\r\neffectual means of restoring order and confidence there. Of course\r\nthis meant concession to America, and it became the signal for the\r\nopening of an impassioned debate. Wilkes, Lord Mayor of London, poured\r\nout a torrent of remonstrances against the conduct of the Ministry,\r\nwho had precipitated the nation into \"an unjust, ruinous, felonious,\r\nand murderous war.\" Sir Adam Fergusson, speaking less vehemently and\r\nwith more show of sense, defended the government. Whatever causes may\r\nhave brought on the troubles, the present concern with him was how to\r\ntreat them as they then existed. There was but one choice, in his\r\nestimation--either to support the authority of Great Britain with\r\nvigor, or abandon America altogether. And who, he asked, would be bold\r\nenough to advise abandonment? The employment of force, therefore, was\r\nthe only alternative; and, said the speaker, prudence and humanity\r\nrequired that the army sent out should be such a one as would carry\r\nits point and override opposition in every quarter--not merely beat\r\nthe colonists, but \"deprive them of all idea of resistance.\" Gov.\r\nJohnstone, rising in reply, reviewed the old questions at length, and\r\nin the course of his speech took occasion to eulogize the bravery of\r\nthe provincials at Bunker Hill. It was this engagement, more than any\r\nincident of the war thus far, that had shown the determination of the\r\n\"rebels\" to fight for their rights; and their friends in Parliament\r\npresented it as a foretaste of what was to come, if England persisted\r\nin extreme measures. Johnstone besought the House not to wreak its\r\nvengeance upon such men as fought that day; for their courage was\r\ndeserving, rather, of admiration, and their conduct of forgiveness.\r\nHonorable Temple Lutrell followed with an attack upon the \"evil\r\ncounsellors who had so long poisoned the ear of the Sovereign.\"\r\nConway, who on this occasion spoke with his old fire, and held the\r\nclose attention of the House, called for more information as to the\r\ncondition of affairs in the colonies, and at the same time rejected\r\nthe idea of reducing them to submission by force. Barré entered\r\nminutely into the particulars and results of the campaign since the\r\n19th of April, as being little to England's credit, and urged the\r\nMinistry to embrace the present opportunity for an accommodation with\r\nAmerica, or that whole country would be lost to them forever. Burke,\r\nin the same vein, represented the impolicy of carrying on the war, and\r\nadvised the government to meet the colonists with a friendly\r\ncountenance, and no longer allow Great Britain to appear like \"a\r\nporcupine, armed all over with acts of Parliament oppressive to trade\r\nand America.\" Fox spoke of Lord North as \"a blundering pilot,\" who had\r\nbrought the nation into its present dilemma. Neither Lord Chatham nor\r\nthe King of Prussia, not even Alexander the Great, he declared, ever\r\ngained more in one campaign than the noble lord had lost--he had lost\r\nan entire continent. While not justifying all the proceedings of the\r\ncolonists, he called upon the Administration to place America where\r\nshe stood in 1763, and to repeal every act passed since that time\r\nwhich affected either her freedom or her commerce. Wedderburne and\r\nDunning, the ablest lawyers in the House, took opposite sides. The\r\nformer, as Solicitor-General, threw the weight of his opinion in favor\r\nof rigorous measures, and hoped that an army of not less than sixty\r\nthousand men would be sent to enforce Parliamentary authority.\r\nDunning, his predecessor in office, questioned the legality of the\r\nking's preparations for war without the previous consent of the\r\nCommons. Then, later in the debate, rose Lord North, the principal\r\nfigure in the Ministry, and whom the Opposition held mainly\r\nresponsible for the colonial troubles, and defended both himself and\r\nthe king's address. Speaking forcibly and to the point, he informed\r\nthe House that, in a word, the measures intended by the government\r\nwere to send a powerful sea and land armament against the colonists,\r\nand at the same time to proffer terms of mercy upon a proper\r\nsubmission. \"This,\" said the Minister, \"will show we are in earnest,\r\nthat we are prepared to punish, but are nevertheless ready to\r\nforgive; and this is, in my opinion, the most likely means of\r\nproducing an honorable reconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nBut all the eloquence, reasoning and appeal of the Opposition failed\r\nto have any more influence now than in the earlier stages of the\r\ncontroversy, and it again found itself in a hopeless minority. Upon a\r\ndivision of the House, the king was supported by a vote of 278 to 110.\r\nThe address presented to him closed with the words: \"We hope and trust\r\nthat we shall, by the blessing of God, put such strength and force\r\ninto your Majesty's hands, as may soon defeat and suppress this\r\nrebellion, and enable your Majesty to accomplish your gracious wish of\r\nre-establishing order, tranquillity, and happiness through all parts\r\nof your United Empire.\" In the House of Lords, where Camden,\r\nShelburne, Rockingham, and their compeers stood between America and\r\nthe Ministry, the address was adopted by a vote of 69 to 33.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Outside of Parliament, all shades of opinion found\r\nexpression through the papers, pamphlets, and private correspondence.\r\nHume, the historian, wrote, October 27th, 1775: \"I am an American in\r\nmy principles, and wish we could let them alone, to govern or\r\nmisgovern themselves as they think proper. The affair is of no\r\nconsequence, or of little consequence to us.\" But he wanted those\r\n\"insolent rascals in London and Middlesex\" punished for inciting\r\nopposition at home. This would be more to the point than \"mauling the\r\npoor infatuated Americans in the other hemisphere.\" William Strahan,\r\nthe eminent printer, replied to Hume: \"I differ from you _toto\r\ncoelo_ with regard to America. I am entirely for coercive methods\r\nwith those obstinate madmen.\" Dr. Robertson, author of _The History of\r\nAmerica_, wrote: \"If our leaders do not exert the power of the British\r\nEmpire in its full force, the struggle will be long, dubious, and\r\ndisgraceful. We are past the hour of lenitives and half exertions.\"\r\nEarly in 1776, Dr. Richard Price, the Dissenting preacher, issued his\r\nfamous pamphlet on the _Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of\r\nGovernment, and the Justice and Policy of the War_, which had a great\r\nrun. Taking sides with the colonists, he said: \"It is madness to\r\nresolve to butcher them. Freemen are not to be governed by force, or\r\ndragooned into compliance. If capable of bearing to be so treated, it\r\nis a disgrace to be connected with them.\"]\r\n\r\nThis powerful endorsement of the king's policy by Parliament, however,\r\ncannot be taken as representing the sense of the nation at large. It\r\nmay be questioned whether even a bare majority of the English people\r\nwere ready to go to the lengths proposed in his Majesty's address. The\r\nMinistry, it is true, pointed to the numerous ratifying \"addresses\"\r\nthat flowed in, pledging the support of towns and cities for the\r\nprosecution of the war. Some were sent from unexpected quarters. To\r\nthe surprise of both sides and the particular satisfaction of the\r\nking, both Manchester and Sheffield, places supposed to be American in\r\nsentiment, came forward with resolutions of confidence and approval;\r\nand in ministerial circles it was made to appear that substantially\r\nall England was for coercion. But this claim was unfounded. As the\r\nking predicted, the loyal addresses provoked opposition addresses.\r\nEdinburgh and Glasgow, despite the efforts of their members, refused\r\nto address. Lynn was said to have addressed, but its members denied\r\nthe assertion, and claimed that the war was unpopular in that town.\r\nThe paper from Great Yarmouth was very thinly signed, while Bristol,\r\nGlasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley, and\r\nother places sent in counter-petitions against the war. The justices\r\nof Middlesex unanimously voted that it was expedient to reduce the\r\ncolonies to a proper sense of their duty; but at a meeting of the\r\nfreeholders of the same county, held at Mile-end, to instruct their\r\nmembers in Parliament, little unanimity prevailed, \"much clamor\r\narose,\" a protest was entered against the proposed resolutions, and\r\nonly one of the sheriffs consented to sign them all. London, as the\r\ncountry well knew, sympathized largely with America, but in a manner\r\nwhich nullified her influence elsewhere. Her populace was noisy and\r\nthreatening; Wilkes, her Lord Mayor, was hated at court; her solid men\r\nkept to business. \"Are the London merchants,\" wrote the king to Lord\r\nNorth,[2] \"so thoroughly absorbed in their private interests not to\r\nfeel what they owe to the constitution which has enriched them, that\r\nthey do not either show their willingness to support, either by an\r\naddress, or, what I should like better, a subscription, to furnish\r\nmany comforts to the army in America?\" An address from this quarter,\r\nsigned by \"respectable names,\" he thought might have a good effect,\r\nand one was presented on October 11th, with 941 signatures; but it was\r\nentirely neutralized by the presentation, three days before, of\r\nanother address more numerously signed by \"gentlemen, merchants, and\r\ntraders of London,\" in which the measures of government were\r\ncondemned. When the point was made in the Commons that the war was a\r\npopular measure in England, Lutrell promptly replied that he had made\r\nmany a journey through the interior of the country during the summer\r\nseason, and had conversed with \"a multitude of persons widely\r\ndifferent in station and description,\" only to find that the masses\r\nwere in sympathy with the colonists. The division of sentiment was\r\nprobably correctly represented by Lord Camden early in the year, in\r\nhis observation that the landed interest was almost wholly\r\nanti-American, while the merchants, tradesmen, and the common people\r\nwere generally opposed to a war.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Correspondence with Lord North.\" Donne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Upon this point Dr. Price said: \"Let it be granted,\r\n_though probably far from true_, that the _majority_ of the kingdom\r\nfavor the present measures. No good argument could be drawn from\r\nthence against receding.\"]\r\n\r\nHaving voted to push the war in earnest, Parliament proceeded to\r\nsupply the sinews. On November 3d, Lord Barrington brought in the army\r\nestimates for 1776. Fifty-five thousand men, he reported, was the\r\nforce necessary and intended to be raised for the purposes of the\r\nnation, the ordinary expense of maintaining which would be something\r\nover £1,300,000. Of these troops, twenty thousand would be retained\r\nto garrison Great Britain, ten thousand for the West Indies,\r\nGibraltar, Minorca and the coast of Africa, while the actual force\r\ndestined for America was to be increased to thirty-four battalions,\r\neach of 811 men, including two regiments of light horse, amounting, in\r\nthe aggregate, to upwards of twenty-five thousand men. Barrington, at\r\nthe same time, frankly acknowledged to the House that these figures\r\nshowed well only on paper, as none of the regiments for America were\r\ncomplete, and, what was a still more unwelcome admission, that great\r\ndifficulty was experienced in enlisting new recruits. Nothing, he\r\nsaid, had been left untried to secure them. The bounty had been raised\r\nand the standard lowered, and yet men were not forthcoming.\r\nAnticipating this dearth, he had warned the king of it as early as\r\nJuly, when the latter first determined to increase the army. \"I wish,\r\nsir, most cordially,\" wrote this faithful secretary, \"that the force\r\nintended for North America may be raised in time to be sent thither\r\nnext spring; but I not only fear, but am confident, the proposed\r\naugmentation cannot possibly be raised, and ought not to be depended\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nBarrington was compelled to give an explanation of this state of\r\nthings, for the point had been made in and out of Parliament that few\r\nrecruits could be had in England, because the particular service was\r\nodious to the people in general. For the government to admit this\r\nwould have been clearly fatal; and Barrington argued, per contra, that\r\nthe scarcity of soldiers was to be traced to other and concurrent\r\ncauses. The great influx of real and nominal wealth of recent years,\r\nthe consequent luxury of the times, the very flourishing state of\r\ncommerce and the manufactures, and the increased employment thus\r\nfurnished to the lower classes, all contributed to keep men out of the\r\narmy. Above all, it was represented that the true and natural cause\r\nwas an actual lack of men, which was due chiefly to the late increase\r\nof the militia, who could not be called upon to serve except in\r\nextreme cases, and who were not available for the regular force.\r\nBarrington, a veteran in official service, true to the king, and\r\njustifying the war--though not at all clear as to the right of taxing\r\nthe colonies--no doubt expressed his honest convictions in making this\r\nexplanatory speech to the House. There was much, also, that was true\r\nin his words; but, whatever the absolute cause, the fact did not then,\r\nand cannot now escape notice, that in preparing to uphold the\r\nauthority of Parliament, and preserve the integrity of her empire in\r\nAmerica, Great Britain, in 1775, found it impossible to induce a\r\nsufficient number of her own subjects to take up arms in her behalf.\r\n\r\nIt remained, accordingly, to seek foreign aid. Europe must furnish\r\nEngland with troops, or the war must stop. The custom of employing\r\nmercenaries was ancient, and universally exercised on the Continent.\r\nGreat Britain herself had frequently taken foreign battalions into her\r\npay, but these were to fight a foreign enemy. It would be a thing new\r\nin her history to engage them to suppress fellow-Englishmen. But the\r\nking regarded war as war, and rebellion a heinous offence; and the\r\ncharacter of the troops serving for him in this case became a\r\nsecondary matter. A more serious question was where to get them. No\r\nassistance could be expected from France. Holland declined to lend\r\ntroops to conquer men who were standing out for their rights on their\r\nown soil. In Prussia, Frederick the Great expressed the opinion that\r\nit was at least problematical whether America could be conquered, it\r\nbeing difficult to govern men by force at such a distance. \"If you\r\nintend conciliation,\" he said in conversation to a party of\r\nEnglishmen, \"some of your measures are too rough; and if subjection,\r\ntoo gentle. In short, I do not understand these matters; I have no\r\ncolonies. I hope you will extricate yourselves advantageously, but I\r\nown the affair seems rather perplexing.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"A View of Society and Manners in France, Switzerland,\r\nand Germany.\" By John Moore, M.D. Lond., 1786. Vol. V., Letter 75.]\r\n\r\nOf all the European powers, Russia and the German principalities alone\r\npresented a possible field of encouragement.[5] To the former, King\r\nGeorge looked first; for England's friendly attitude had been of the\r\ngreatest advantage to Russia in her campaigns against Turkey. The\r\nking, therefore, at an early date, gave directions that Gunning, the\r\nBritish Minister at Moscow, should approach the Empress Catherine on\r\nthe subject of lending aid; and, on the proper occasion, Gunning held\r\nan interview with Panin, the Russian Prime Minister. Catherine\r\npromptly returned what appeared to be a very favorable reply. To use\r\nGunning's own words communicating Russia's answer: \"The empress had\r\nordered him (Panin) to give the strongest assurances, and to express\r\nthem in the strongest terms, of her entire readiness on this and all\r\nother occasions to give his Majesty every assistance he could desire,\r\nin whatever mode or manner he might think proper. She embraced with\r\nsatisfaction this occasion of testifying her gratitude to the king and\r\nnation for the important services she had received in the late\r\nwar--favors she the more valued and should not forget as they were\r\nspontaneously bestowed.... We were as fully entitled to every succor\r\nfrom her as if the strongest treaties subsisted.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Respecting sentiment in Europe on American affairs, the\r\nEnglish traveller Moore wrote as follows from Vienna in 1775: \"Our\r\ndisputes with the colonies have been a prevailing topic of\r\nconversation wherever we have been since we left England. The warmth\r\nwith which this subject is handled increases every day. At present the\r\ninhabitants of the Continent seem as impatient as those of Great\r\nBritain for news from the other side of the Atlantic; but with this\r\ndifference, that here they are all of one mind--all praying for\r\nsuccess to the Americans, and rejoicing in every piece of bad fortune\r\nwhich happens to our army.\"--_Moore's View_, etc. Letter 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"History of England from the Accession of George III. to\r\n1783.\" By J. Adolphus. Vol. II., p. 326.]\r\n\r\nGreatly elated by this unequivocal tender of aid, King George wrote to\r\nthe empress in his own hand, thanking her for the proffer; and Gunning\r\nat the same time was instructed to ask for twenty thousand Russians,\r\nand enter into a treaty formally engaging their services. If he could\r\nnot secure twenty thousand, he was to get all he could. But Gunning's\r\nnegotiations were to fail completely. To his surprise and chagrin,\r\nwhen he opened the subject of hiring Russian troops, the empress and\r\nPanin answered with dignity that it was impossible to accommodate him;\r\nthat Russia's relations with Sweden, Poland, and Turkey were\r\nunsettled, and that it was beneath her station to interfere in a\r\ndomestic rebellion which no foreign Power had recognized. This sudden\r\nchange in Catherine's attitude, which without doubt was the result of\r\ncourt intrigue,[7] filled the English king with mortification and\r\ndisappointment, and compelled him to seek assistance where he finally\r\nobtained it--in the petty states of the \"Hessian\" princes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Two views have been expressed in regard to this. The\r\nEnglish historian Adolphus charges Frederick of Prussia and secret\r\nFrench agents with having changed Catherine's mind, and he gives\r\napparently good authority for the statement. The secret seems to have\r\nbeen known in English circles very soon after Catherine's refusal. On\r\nNovember 10th Shelburne said in the House of Lords: \"There are Powers\r\nin Europe who will not suffer such a body of Russians to be\r\ntransported to America. I speak from information. The Ministers know\r\nwhat I mean. Some power has already interfered to stop the success of\r\nthe Russian negotiation.\" Mr. Bancroft, on the other hand, concludes\r\n(Vol. V., Chap. L., Rev. Ed.) that \"no foreign influence whatever, not\r\neven that of the King of Prussia, had any share in determining the\r\nempress;\" and Vergennes is quoted as saying that he could not\r\nreconcile Catherine's \"elevation of soul with the dishonorable idea of\r\ntrafficking in the blood of her subjects.\" But since Catherine, four\r\nyears later, in 1779, proposed to offer to give England effective\r\nassistance in America in order to be assured of her aid in return\r\nagainst the Turks, it may be questioned how far \"elevation of soul\"\r\nprompted the decision in 1775. (See Eaton's \"Turkish Empire,\" p. 409.)\r\nIn view of England's relations with most of the Continental Powers at\r\nthat time, Shelburne and Adolphus have probably given the correct\r\nexplanation of the matter.]\r\n\r\nSuccess in this direction compensated in part for the Russian failure.\r\nWhat the British agent, Colonel Faucett, was able to accomplish, what\r\nbargains were struck to obtain troops, how much levy money was to be\r\npaid per man, and how much more if he never returned, is all a\r\nnotorious record. From the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, Faucett hired\r\ntwelve thousand infantry; from the Duke of Brunswick, three thousand\r\nnine hundred and a small body of cavalry; and from the reigning Count\r\nof Hanau, a corps six hundred and sixty strong. These constituted the\r\n\"foreign troops\" which England sent to America with her own soldiers\r\nfor the campaign of 1776.\r\n\r\nThe plans for the campaign were laid out on a scale corresponding with\r\nthe preparations. When Sir William Howe was sent out to reinforce\r\nGeneral Gage at Boston, in the spring of 1775, it was assumed by the\r\nMinistry that operations would be confined to that quarter, and that\r\nif Massachusetts were once subdued there would be nothing to fear\r\nelsewhere. But the continued siege of Boston changed the military\r\nstatus. Howe was completely locked in, and could effect nothing. The\r\nnecessity of transferring the seat of war to a larger field became\r\napparent after Bunker Hill, and military plans were broached and\r\ndiscussed in the Cabinet, in the army, and in Parliament. Lord\r\nBarrington, who well knew that men enough could not be had from\r\nEngland to conquer the colonies, advocated operations by sea. An\r\neffective blockade of the entire American coast, depriving the\r\ncolonists of their trade, might, in his view, bring them to terms. Mr.\r\nInnes, in the House, proposed securing a strong foothold in the south,\r\nbelow the Delaware, and shutting up the northern ports with the fleet.\r\nBut the basis of the plan adopted appears to have been that suggested\r\nby Burgoyne at Boston in the summer of 1775, and by Howe in January,\r\n1776. \"If the continent,\" wrote the former to Lord Rochfort, Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies, \"is to be subdued by arms, his Majesty's\r\ncouncils will find, I am persuaded, the proper expedients; but I speak\r\nconfidently as a soldier, because I speak the sentiments of those who\r\nknow America best, that you can have no prospect of bringing the war\r\nto a speedy conclusion with any force that Great Britain and Ireland\r\ncan supply. A large army of foreign troops such as might be hired, to\r\nbegin their operations up the Hudson River; another army, composed\r\npartly of old disciplined troops and partly of Canadians, to act from\r\nCanada; a large levy of Indians, and a supply of arms for the blacks\r\nto awe the southern provinces, conjointly with detachments of\r\nregulars; and a numerous fleet to sweep the whole coast, might\r\npossibly do the business in one campaign.\"[8] To Lord Dartmouth, Howe\r\nrepresented that with an army of twenty thousand men, twelve thousand\r\nof whom should hold New York, six thousand land on Rhode Island, and\r\ntwo thousand protect Halifax, with a separate force at Quebec,\r\noffensive operations could be pushed so as to put \"a very different\r\naspect\" on the situation by the close of another year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Fonblanque's Life of Burgoyne_, p. 152.]\r\n\r\nThe plan as finally arranged was a modification of these two views. It\r\nwas decided that Howe should occupy New York City with the main body\r\nof the army, and secure that important base; while Carleton, with\r\nBurgoyne as second in command, should move down from Canada to\r\nTiconderoga and Albany. By concert of action on the part of these\r\nforces, New England could be effectually cut off from co-operation\r\nwith the lower colonies, and the unity of their movements broken up.\r\nIt was proposed at the same time to send an expedition under Lord\r\nCornwallis and Admiral Parker, to obtain a footing in Virginia or\r\neither of the Carolinas, and encourage the loyal element in the South\r\nto organize, and counteract the revolt in that quarter. By carrying\r\nout this grand strategy, King George and his advisers confidently\r\nexpected to end all resistance in America at one blow.\r\n\r\nThus Great Britain, instead of attempting to recover her authority\r\nover the colonists by a candid recognition of privileges which they\r\nclaimed as Englishmen, resolved in 1775 to enforce it. The government\r\nwent to war, with the nation's wealth and influence at its back, but\r\nwith only half its popular sympathies and moral support. Parliament\r\nrefused to listen to the appeals of its ablest members to try the\r\nvirtues of concession and conciliation. A heavy war budget was voted,\r\nthe Continent of Europe was ransacked for troops which could not be\r\nenlisted in England, and every effort made to insure the complete\r\nsubmission of the colonies in 1776.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow America prepared to meet the coming storm is properly the subject\r\nof the succeeding chapter of this work. But we find her in no position\r\nin 1775 to assume the character of a public enemy towards the mother\r\ncountry. She still claimed to be a petitioner to the king for the\r\nredress of grievances. If she had taken up arms, it was simply in\r\nself-defence, and these she was ready to lay down the moment her\r\nrights were acknowledged. A revolution, involving separation from\r\nEngland, was not thought of by the mass of the American people at this\r\ntime. The most they hoped for was, that by offering a stout resistance\r\nto an enforcement of the ministerial policy they could eventually\r\ncompel a change in that policy, and enjoy all that they demanded under\r\nthe British constitution. Towards the close of the year, however, when\r\nthe intelligence came that the king had ignored the last petition from\r\nCongress, and had proposed extreme war measures, the colonists felt\r\nthat serious work was before them. Independence now began to be more\r\ngenerally discussed; Washington's troops were re-enlisted for service\r\nthrough the following year, and Congress took further steps for the\r\ncommon defence.\r\n\r\nFuture military operations were necessarily dependent on the plans to\r\nbe developed by the British. But as the siege of Boston progressed, it\r\nbecame obvious that that point at least could not be made a base for\r\nthe ensuing campaign. No other was more likely to be selected by the\r\nenemy than New York; and to New York the war finally came.\r\n\r\nThe topography of this new region, the transfer to it of the two\r\narmies, and the preparations made for its defence by the Americans,\r\nnext claim attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFORTIFYING NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York City, in 1776, lay at the end of Manhattan Island, in shape\r\nsomewhat like an arrow-head, with its point turned towards the sea and\r\nits barbs extended at uneven lengths along the East and Hudson rivers.\r\nIt occupied no more space than is now included within the five lower\r\nand smallest of its twenty-four wards. Excepting a limited district\r\nlaid out on the east side, in part as far as Grand street, the entire\r\ntown stood below the line of the present Chambers street, and covered\r\nan area less than one mile square. Then, as now, Broadway was its\r\nprincipal thoroughfare. Shaded with rows of trees, and lined mainly\r\nwith residences, churches, and public-houses, it stretched something\r\nmore than a mile to the grounds of the old City Hospital, near Duane\r\nstreet. Its starting-point was the Battery at the end of the island,\r\nbut not the Battery of to-day; for, under the system of \"harbor\r\nencroachments,\" the latter has more than trebled in size, and is\r\nchanged both in its shape and its uses. The city defences at that time\r\noccupied the site. Here at the foot of Broadway old Fort George had\r\nbeen erected upon the base of the older Fort Amsterdam, to guard the\r\nentrance to the rivers, and with its outworks was the only protection\r\nagainst an attack by sea. It was a square bastioned affair, with walls\r\nof stone, each face eighty feet in length, and within it stood\r\nmagazines, barracks, and, until destroyed by fire, the mansion of the\r\ncolonial governors. For additional security, about the time of the\r\nFrench war, an extensive stone battery, with merlons of cedar joists,\r\nhad been built just below the fort along the water's edge, enclosing\r\nthe point from river to river, and pierced for ninety-one pieces of\r\ncannon.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The site of Fort George is now covered in part by the\r\nbuildings at the west corner of the Bowling Green block, where the\r\nsteamship companies have their offices. South and west of this point\r\nthe Battery is almost entirely made-land. (Compare Ratzer's map of\r\n1767 with the maps recently compiled by the New York Dock Department.)\r\nAs to other old defences of the city, Wm. Smith, the historian,\r\nwriting about 1766, says: \"During the late war a line of palisadoes\r\nwas run from Hudson's to the East River, at the other end of the city\r\n[near the line of Chambers street], with block-houses at small\r\ndistances. The greater part of these still remain as a monument of our\r\nfolly, which cost the province about £8000.\"]\r\n\r\nAt this period, the city represented a growth of one hundred and sixty\r\nyears. Give it a population of twenty-five thousand souls[10]--more\r\nrather than less--and line its streets with four thousand buildings,\r\nand we have its census statistics approximately. The linear\r\ncharacteristics of the old town are still sharply preserved. Upon the\r\nwest side, the principal streets running to the North River--Chambers,\r\nWarren, Murray, Barclay, Vesey, Dey, and Cortlandt--retain their names\r\nand location; but the water-line was then marked by Greenwich street.\r\nThe present crowded section to the west of it, including Washington\r\nand West streets and the docks, is built on new ground, made within\r\nthe century. Behind Trinity Church, and as far down as the Battery,\r\nthe shore rose to a very considerable bluff. Necessarily, much the\r\ngreater part of the city then lay east of Broadway. The irregular\r\nstreets to be found on this side are relics of both the Dutch and\r\nEnglish foundation; of their buildings, however, as they stood in\r\n1776, scarcely one remains at the present time. New streets have been\r\nbuilt on the East River as well as on the North, materially changing\r\nthe water boundary of this part of the island. Front and South streets\r\nhad no existence at that date. On the line of Wall street, the city\r\nhas nearly doubled in width since the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The last census before the Revolution was taken in 1771,\r\nwhen the population of the city and county of New York was returned at\r\n21,863. (Doc. Hist. of N.Y., Vol. I.) At the time of the war alarm, in\r\n1775, this total must have risen to full 25,000. Philadelphia's\r\npopulation was somewhat larger; Boston's, less.]\r\n\r\nBefore its contraction, and in view of its convenience and protection\r\nfrom storms, the East River was the harbor proper of New York. Most of\r\nthe docks were on that side, and just above Catherine street lay the\r\nship-yards, where at times, in colonial days, an eight-hundred-ton\r\nWest Indiaman might be seen upon the stocks.\r\n\r\nWhat is now the City Hall Park was called in 1776 \"the Fields,\" or\r\n\"The Common.\" The site of the City Hall was occupied by the House of\r\nCorrection; the present Hall of Records was the town jail, and the\r\nstructure then on a line with them at the corner of Broadway was the\r\n\"Bridewell.\" The City Hall of that day stood in Wall street, on the\r\nsite of the present Custom-House, and King's, now Columbia, College in\r\nthe square bounded by Murray, Barclay, Church, and West Broadway.\r\nQueen, now Pearl, was the principal business street; fashion was to be\r\nfound in the vicinity of the Battery, and Broad and Dock streets; the\r\nVauxhall Gardens were at the foot of Reade; and to pass out of town,\r\none would have to turn off Broadway into Chatham street, which\r\nextended through Park Row, and keep on to the Bowery.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams has left us a brief description of New York, as he saw it\r\nwhen passing through to the first Congress at Philadelphia in 1774, in\r\ncompany with Cushing, Paine, and Samuel Adams. His diary runs:\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday, Aug. 20._--Lodged at Cock's, at Kingsbridge, a pretty\r\nplace.... Breakfasted at Day's [127th street], and arrived in the city\r\nof New York at ten o'clock, at Hull's, a tavern, the sign the Bunch of\r\nGrapes. We rode by several very elegant country-seats before we came\r\nto the city.... After dinner, Mr. McDougall and Mr. Platt came, and\r\nwalked with us to every part of the city. First we went to the fort,\r\nwhere we saw the ruins of that magnificent building, the Governor's\r\nhouse [burned Dec. 29, 1773]. From the Parade, before the fort, you\r\nhave a fine prospect of Hudson River, and of the East River, or the\r\nSound, and of the harbor; of Long Island, beyond the Sound River, and\r\nof New Jersey beyond Hudson's River. The walk round this fort is very\r\npleasant, though the fortifications are not strong. Between the fort\r\nand the city is a beautiful ellipsis of land [Bowling Green], railed\r\nin with solid iron, in the centre of which is a statue of his majesty\r\non horseback, very large, of solid lead gilded with gold, standing on\r\na pedestal of marble, very high. We then walked up the Broad Way, a\r\nfine street, very wide, and in a right line from one end to the other\r\nof the city. In this route we saw the old Church and the new Church\r\n[Trinity]. The new is a very magnificent building--cost twenty\r\nthousand pounds, York currency. The prison is a large and a handsome\r\nstone building; there are two sets of barracks. We saw the New York\r\nCollege, which is also a large stone building. A new hospital is\r\nbuilding, of stone. We then walked down to a shipyard. Then we walked\r\nround through another street, which is the principal street of\r\nbusiness. Saw the several markets. After this we went to the\r\ncoffee-house, which was full of gentlemen; read the newspapers,\r\netc.... The streets of this town are vastly more regular and elegant\r\nthan those in Boston, and the houses are more grand, as well as neat.\r\nThey are almost all painted, brick buildings and all.\"\r\n\r\nOther glimpses we get from English sources. The traveler Smyth, while\r\nvisiting this city during the British occupation, has this to say:[11]\r\n\"Nothing can be more delightful than the situation of New York,\r\ncommanding a variety of the most charming prospects that can be\r\nconceived. It is built chiefly upon the East River, which is the best\r\nand safest harbour, and is only something more than half a mile wide.\r\nThe North River is better than two miles over to Powles Hook, which is\r\na strong work opposite to New York, but is exposed to the driving of\r\nthe ice in winter, whereby ships are prevented from lying therein\r\nduring that season of the year. The land on the North River side is\r\nhigh and bold, but on the East River it gradually descends in a\r\nbeautiful declivity to the water's edge.... Amongst the multitude of\r\nelegant seats upon this island, there are three or four uncommonly\r\nbeautiful, viz., Governor Elliot's, Judge Jones's, Squire Morris's,\r\nand Mr. Bateman's. And opposite, upon the Continent, just above\r\nHell-gates, there is a villa named Morrisania, which is inferior to no\r\nplace in the world for the beauties, grandeur, and extent of\r\nperspective, and the elegance of its situation.\" Eddis, who had been\r\ncompelled to leave Maryland on account of his loyal sentiments, was\r\nhardly less impressed with the city's appearance when he stopped here\r\non his way to England in 1777. \"The capital of this province,\" he\r\nwrote, August 16th, \"is situated on the southern extremity of the\r\nisland; on one side runs the North, and on the other the East River,\r\non the latter of which, on account of the harbour, the city is\r\nprincipally built. In several streets, trees are regularly planted,\r\nwhich afford a grateful shelter during the intense heat of the summer.\r\nThe buildings are generally of brick, and many are erected in a style\r\nof elegance.... Previous to the commencement of this unhappy war, New\r\nYork was a flourishing, populous, and beautiful town....\r\nNotwithstanding the late devastation [fire of 1776], there are still\r\nmany elegant edifices remaining, which would reflect credit on any\r\nmetropolis in Europe.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"A Tour in the United States,\" etc. By J.F.D. Smyth.\r\nLondon, 1784.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Letters from America, 1769-1777.\" By Wm. Eddis.\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the limits of the city, Manhattan Island retained much of its\r\nprimitive appearance. Roads, farms, country-seats, interspersed it,\r\nbut not thickly; and as yet the salient features were hills, marshes,\r\npatches of rocky land, streams, and woods. Just upon the outskirts,\r\nmidway between the rivers, at about the corner of Grand and Centre\r\nStreets, the ground rose to a commanding elevation on the farm of\r\nWilliam Bayard, which overlooked the city and the island above a\r\ndistance of more than three miles. Further east, a little north of the\r\nintersection of Grand and Division Streets, stood another hill,\r\nsomewhat lower, where Judge Jones lived, from which opened an\r\nextensive view of the East River and harbor. On the west side, on this\r\nline, the surface sank from Bayard's mount into a spreading marsh as\r\nfar as the Hudson, and over which now run portions of Canal and Grand\r\nand their cross streets. Where we have the Tombs and surrounding\r\nblocks, stood the \"Fresh Water\" lake or \"Collect,\" several fathoms\r\ndeep, with high sloping banks on the north and west, and on whose\r\nsurface were made the earliest experiments in steam navigation in\r\n1796.\r\n\r\nOne nearly central highway, known as the King's Bridge or Post Road,\r\nran the entire length of the island. Where it left the city at Chatham\r\nSquare, it was properly the Bowerie or Bowery Lane. Continuing along\r\nthe present street by this name, it fell off into the line of Fourth\r\nAvenue as far as Fourteenth Street, crossed Union Square diagonally to\r\nBroadway, and kept the course of the latter to Madison Square at\r\nTwenty-third Street. Crossing this square, also diagonally, the road\r\nstretched along between Fourth and Second Avenues to Fifty-third\r\nStreet, passed east of Second Avenue, and then turning westerly\r\nentered Central Park at Ninety-second Street. Leaving the Park at a\r\nhollow in the hills known as \"McGowan's Pass,\" just above the house of\r\nAndrew McGowan, on the line of One Hundred and Seventh Street, west of\r\nFifth Avenue, it followed Harlem Lane to the end of the island. Here,\r\non the other side of King's Bridge, then \"a small wooden bridge,\"[13]\r\nthe highway diverged easterly to New England and northerly to Albany.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: \"King's Bridge, which joins the northern extremity of\r\nthis island to the continent, is only a small wooden bridge, and the\r\ncountry around is mountainous, rocky, broken, and disagreeable, but\r\nvery strong.\"--_Smyth's Tour, etc._, vol. ii., p. 376.]\r\n\r\nThis portion of the island above the city was known as its \"Out-ward,\"\r\nand had been divided at an early date into three divisions, under the\r\nnames of the Bowery, Harlem, and Bloomingdale divisions. Each\r\ncontained points of settlement. The Bowery section included that part\r\nof the city laid out near Fresh Water Pond and around Chatham Square\r\nbelow Grand Street, and the stretch of country above beyond the line\r\nof Twenty-third Street. In this division were to be found some of the\r\nnotable residences and country-seats of that day. James De Lancey's\r\nlarge estate extended from the Bowery to the East River, and from\r\nDivision nearly to the line of Houston Street. The Rutgers' Mansion\r\nstood attractively on the slopes of the river bank about the line of\r\nMontgomery Street, and above De Lancey's, on the Bowery, were the De\r\nPeysters, Dyckmans, and Stuyvesants.\r\n\r\nThe Harlem division of the Out-ward, with which are associated some of\r\nthe most interesting events of 1776, included what is now known as\r\nHarlem, with the island above it as far as King's Bridge. Dutch\r\nfarmers had settled here a hundred years before the Revolution. As\r\nearly as 1658, the Director-General and Council of New Netherland gave\r\nnotice that \"for the further promotion of Agriculture, for the\r\nsecurity of this Island, and the cattle pasturing thereon, as well as\r\nfor the greater recreation and amusement of this city of Amsterdam in\r\nNew Netherland, they have resolved to form a New Village or Settlement\r\nat the end of the Island, and about the lands of Jochem Pietersen,\r\ndeceased, and those which adjoin thereto.\" The first settlers were to\r\nreceive lots to cultivate, be furnished with a guard of soldiers, and\r\nallowed a ferry across the Harlem River, for \"the better and greater\r\npromotion of neighborly correspondence with the English of the\r\nNorth.\"[14] In 1776, the division was interspersed with houses and\r\nfields, especially in the stretch of plains or flat land just above\r\nOne Hundred and Tenth Street, and from the East River to the line of\r\nNinth Avenue. The church and centre of the village were on the east\r\nside, in the vicinity of One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, and the\r\nold road by which they were reached from the city branched off from\r\nthe main highway at McGowan's Pass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Laws and Ordinances of New Netherlands._]\r\n\r\nBloomingdale was a scattered settlement, containing nearly all the\r\nhouses to be found along the Bloomingdale Road, but the name appears\r\nto have identified principally the upper section beyond Fiftieth\r\nStreet. Here lived the Apthorpes at Ninety-second Street; the\r\nStrikers, Joneses, and Hogelands above; and, lower down, the\r\nSomerindykes and Harsens. As fixed by law, at that time, this road\r\nstarted from the King's Bridge Road, at the house of John Horn, now\r\nthe corner of Twenty-third Street and Fifth Avenue, and followed the\r\nline of the present Broadway and the recent Bloomingdale Road to the\r\nfarm of Adrian Hogeland, at One Hundred and Eighth Street.[15] Nearly\r\non a line with Hogeland, but considerably east of him, lived Benjamin\r\nVandewater; and these two were the most northerly residents in the\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The caption to the act in the case passed 1751, and\r\nremaining unchanged in 1773, reads: \"_An Act for mending and keeping\r\nin Repair the publick Road or Highway, from the House of John Horne,\r\nin the Bowry Division of the Out-ward of the City of New York, through\r\nthe Bloomendale Division in the said ward, to the house of Adrian\r\nHoogelandt._\"]\r\n\r\nStill another suburb of the city was the village of Greenwich,\r\noverlooking the Hudson on the west side, in the vicinity of Fourteenth\r\nStreet, to which the Greenwich Road, now Greenwich Street, led along\r\nthe river bank in nearly a straight line. The road above continued\r\nfurther east about as far as Forty-fifth Street, and there connected,\r\nby a lane running south-westerly, with the Bloomingdale Road at\r\nForty-third Street. Among the country-seats in this village were those\r\nof the Jeaunceys, Bayards, and Clarkes; and above, at Thirty-third\r\nStreet and Ninth Avenue, stood the ample and conspicuous residence of\r\nJohn Morin Scott, one of the leading lawyers of the city, and a\r\npowerful supporter of the American cause.\r\n\r\nAcross the East River, the \"Sister City\" of Brooklyn in 1776 was as\r\nyet invisible from New York. A clump of low buildings at the old\r\nferry, and an occasional manor-seat, were the only signs of life\r\napparent on that side. Columbia Heights, whose modern blocks and row\r\nof wharves and bonded stores suggest commercial activity alone, caught\r\nthe eye a century ago as \"a noble bluff,\" crowned with fields and\r\nwoods, and meeting the water at its base with a shining beach. The\r\nparish or village proper was the merest cluster of houses, nestled in\r\nthe vicinity of the old Dutch church, which stood in the middle of the\r\nroad a little below Bridge Street. The road was the King's highway,\r\nand it ran from Fulton Ferry--where we have had a ferry for two\r\nhundred and forty years at least--along the line of Fulton Street, and\r\non through Jamaica to the eastern end of Long Island. Besides the\r\nsettlements that had grown up at these two points--the church and the\r\nferry, which were nearly a mile and a half apart--a village centre was\r\nto be found at Bedford, further up the highway, another in the\r\nvicinity of the Wallabout, and still another, called Gowanus, along\r\nthe branch road skirting the bay. These all stood within the present\r\nmunicipal limits of Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nAs it had been for more than a century before, the population on the\r\nLong Island side was largely Dutch at the time of the Revolution. The\r\nfirst-comers, in 1636 and after, introduced themselves to the soil and\r\nthe red man as the Van Schows, the Cornelissens, the Manjes, and the\r\nlike--good Walloon patronimics--and the Dutch heritage is still\r\npreserved in the names of old families, and even more permanently in\r\nthe name of the place itself; for the word Brooklyn is but the English\r\ncorruption of Breukelen, the ancient Holland village[16] of which our\r\nmodern city appears to have been the namesake. Smyth, the English\r\ntraveler, makes the general statement towards the close of the\r\nRevolution, that two thirds of the inhabitants of Long Island,\r\nespecially those on the west end, were of Dutch extraction, who\r\ncontinued \"to make use of their customs and language in preference to\r\nEnglish,\" which, however, they also understood. \"The people of King's\r\nCounty [Brooklyn],\" he says, \"are almost entirely Dutch. In Queen's\r\nCounty, four fifths of the people are so likewise, but the other\r\nfifth, and all Suffolk County, are English as they call themselves,\r\nbeing from English ancestors, and using no other language.\" Major\r\nBaurmeister, one of the officers of the Hessian division which\r\nparticipated in the battle of Long Island, leaves us something more\r\nthan statistics in the case. He appears to have noted every thing with\r\nlively appreciation. To a friend in Germany, for instance, we find him\r\nwriting as follows: \"The happiness of the inhabitants, whose ancestors\r\nwere all Dutch, must have been great; genuine kindness and real\r\nabundance is everywhere; any thing worthless or going to ruin is\r\nnowhere to be perceived. The inhabited regions resemble the\r\nWestphalian peasant districts; upon separate farms the finest houses\r\nare built, which are planned and completed in the most elegant\r\nfashion. The furniture in them is in the best taste, nothing like\r\nwhich is to be seen with us, and besides so clean and neat, that\r\naltogether it surpasses every description. The female sex is\r\nuniversally beautiful and delicately reared, and is finely dressed in\r\nthe latest European fashion, particularly in India laces, white cotton\r\nand silk gauzes; not one of these women but would consider driving a\r\ndouble team the easiest of work. They drive and ride out alone, having\r\nonly a negro riding behind to accompany them. Near every\r\ndwelling-house negroes (their slaves) are settled, who cultivate the\r\nmost fertile land, pasture the cattle, and do all the menial\r\nwork.\"[17] That the English element, however, had crept in to a\r\nconsiderable extent around Brooklyn at this time, is a matter of\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The Hon. Henry C. Murphy, who visited this place in\r\n1859, says of it: \"The town lies in the midst of a marshy district,\r\nand hence its name; for Breukelen--pronounced Brurkeler--means marsh\r\nland.\" \"There are some curious points of coincidence,\" continues Mr.\r\nMurphy, \"both as regards the name and situation of the Dutch Breukelen\r\nand our Brooklyn. The name with us was originally applied exclusively\r\nto the hamlet which grew up along the main road now embraced within\r\nFulton Avenue, and between Smith Street and Jackson Street; and we\r\nmust, therefore, not confound it with the settlements at the\r\nWaalebought, Gowanus, and the Ferry, now Fulton Ferry, which were\r\nentirely distinct, and were not embraced within the general name of\r\nBrooklyn, until after the organization of the township of that name by\r\nthe British Colonial Government. Those of our citizens who remember\r\nthe lands on Fulton Avenue near Nevins Street and De Kalb Avenue\r\nbefore the changes which were produced by the filling-in of those\r\nstreets, will recollect that their original character was marshy and\r\nspringy, being in fact the bed of the valley which received the drain\r\nof the hills extending on either side of it from the Waalebought to\r\nGowanus Bay. This would lead to the conclusion that the name was given\r\non account of the locality; but though we have very imperfect accounts\r\nas to who were the first settlers of Brooklyn proper, still, reasoning\r\nfrom analogy in the cases of New Utrecht and New Amersfoort, we cannot\r\nprobably err in supposing that Brooklyn owes its name to the\r\ncircumstance that its first settlers wished to preserve in it a\r\nmemento of their homes in Fatherland. After the English conquest,\r\nthere was a continual struggle between the Dutch and English\r\northography.... Thus it is spelled Breucklyn, Breuckland, Brucklyn,\r\nBroucklyn, Brookland, Brookline, and several other ways. At the end of\r\nthe last century it settled down into the present Brooklyn. In this\r\nform it still retains sufficiently its original signification of the\r\n_marsh_ or _brook land_.\"--_Stiles' History of Brooklyn_, vol. i.,\r\nApp. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Part II., Document 33. On the other hand, some later\r\nEnglish descriptions are not as pleasant; but the wretchedness the\r\nwriters saw during the war was what the war had caused.]\r\n\r\nThe topography of this section of Long Island was peculiar, presenting\r\nstrong contrasts of high and low land. Originally, and indeed within\r\nthe memory of citizens still living, that part of Brooklyn lying\r\nsouth and west of the line of Nevins Street was practically a\r\npeninsula, with the Wallabout Bay or present Navy Yard on one side of\r\nthe neck, and on the other, a mile across, the extensive Gowanus creek\r\nand marsh, over which now run Second, Third, and Fourth Avenues. The\r\ncreek set in from the bay where the Gowanus Canal is retained, and\r\nrendered the marsh impassable at high-water as far as the line of\r\nBaltic Street. Blocks of buildings now stand on the site of mills that\r\nwere once worked by the ebb and flow of the tides. The lower part of\r\nwhat is known as South Brooklyn was largely swamp land in 1776. Here\r\nthe peninsula terminated in a nearly isolated triangular piece of\r\nground jutting out into the harbor, called Red Hook, which figured\r\nprominently in the military operations. From this projection to the\r\nfurthest point on the Wallabout was a distance of three miles, and the\r\nscenery along the bank presented a varied and attractive appearance to\r\nthe resident of New York. The \"heights\" rose conspicuously in all the\r\nbeauty of their natural outline; lower down the shore might be seen a\r\nquaint Dutch mill or two; on the bluffs opposite the Battery, the\r\nmansions of Philip and Robert Livingston were prominent; and not far\r\nfrom where the archway crosses Montague Street stood the Remsen and,\r\nnearer the ferry, the Colden and Middagh residences. From every point\r\nof view the perspective was rural and inviting.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: In describing some of the characteristic features of\r\nLong Island, Smyth, the traveler already quoted, mentions what seemed\r\nto him \"two very extraordinary places.\" \"The first,\" he says, \"is a\r\nvery dangerous and dreadful strait or passage, called _Hell-Gates_,\r\nbetween the East River and the Sound; where the two tides meeting\r\ncause a horrible whirlpool, the vortex of which is called the Pot, and\r\ndrawing in and swallowing up every thing that approaches near it,\r\ndashes them to pieces upon the rocks at the bottom.... Before the late\r\nwar, a top-sail vessel was seldom ever known to pass through\r\nHell-Gates; but since the commencement of it, fleets of transports,\r\nwith frigates for their convoy, have frequently ventured and\r\naccomplished it; the Niger, indeed, a very fine frigate of thirty-two\r\nguns, generally struck on some hidden rock, every time she attempted\r\nthis passage. But what is still more extraordinary, that daring\r\nveteran, Sir James Wallace, to the astonishment of every person who\r\never saw or heard of it, carried his Majesty's ship, the Experiment,\r\nof fifty guns, safe through Hell-Gates, from the east end of the Sound\r\nto New York; when the French fleet under D'Estaing lay off Sandy Hook,\r\nand blocked up the harbor and city of New York, some ships of the line\r\nbeing also sent by D'Estaing round the east end of Long Island to\r\ncruise in the Sound for the same purpose, so that the Experiment must\r\ninevitably have fallen into their hands, had it not been for this bold\r\nand successful attempt of her gallant commander.\" The other spot was\r\nHempstead Plains, which presented the \"singular phenomenon,\" for\r\nAmerica, of having no trees.]\r\n\r\nVastly changed to-day is all this region, which was now to be\r\ndisturbed by the din and havoc of war. Its picturesqueness long since\r\ndisappeared. Upon Manhattan Island, the city's push \"uptown\"-ward has\r\nbeen like the cut of a drawing knife, a remorseless process of\r\nlevelling and \"filling-in.\" Forty times in population and twenty in\r\narea has it expanded beyond the growth of 1776. Brooklyn is a new\r\ncreation. Would its phlegmatic denizen of colonial times recognize the\r\nsite of his farms or his mills? Even the good Whig ferryman, Waldron,\r\nmight be at a loss to make out his bearings, for the green banks of\r\nthe East River have vanished, and its points become confused. The\r\nextent of its contraction he could learn from the builders of the\r\nbridge, who have set the New York pier eight hundred feet out from the\r\nhigh-water mark of 1776, and the Brooklyn pier two hundred or more,\r\nnarrowing the stream at that point to a strait of but sixteen hundred\r\nfeet in width.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first active steps looking to the occupation of New York were\r\ntaken by the Americans early in January of this year. Reports had\r\nreached Washington's headquarters that the British were fitting out\r\nan expedition by sea, whose destination was kept a profound secret. In\r\nBoston, rumors were afloat that it was bound for Halifax or Rhode\r\nIsland. In reality it was the expedition with which Sir Henry Clinton\r\nwas to sail to North Carolina, and there meet Cornwallis, from\r\nEngland, to carry out the southern diversion. Ignorant of the British\r\nplans, and suspecting that Clinton might suddenly appear at New York,\r\nWashington on the 4th of January called the attention of Congress to\r\nthe movement, and suggested that it would be \"consistent with\r\nprudence\" to have some New Jersey troops thrown into the city to\r\nprevent the \"almost irremediable\" evil which would follow its\r\noccupation by the enemy. Two days later, General Charles Lee, holding\r\nrank in the American army next to Washington, pressed a plan of his\r\nown, to the effect that he be sent himself by the commander-in-chief\r\nto secure New York, and that the troops for the purpose (there being\r\nnone to spare from the force around Boston) be hastily raised in\r\nConnecticut. This was approved at headquarters, and on the 8th inst.\r\nLee received instructions as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Having undoubted intelligence of the fitting out of a fleet\r\n     at Boston, and of the embarkation of troops from thence,\r\n     which, from the season of the year and other circumstances,\r\n     must be destined for a southern expedition; and having such\r\n     information as I can rely on, that the inhabitants, or a\r\n     great part of them, on Long Island in the colony of New\r\n     York, are not only inimical to the rights and liberties of\r\n     America, but by their conduct and public professions have\r\n     discovered a disposition to aid and assist in the reduction\r\n     of that colony to ministerial tyranny; and as it is a matter\r\n     of the utmost importance to prevent the enemy from taking\r\n     possession of the City of New York and the North River, as\r\n     they will thereby command the country, and the communication\r\n     with Canada--it is of too much consequence to hazard such a\r\n     post at so alarming a crisis....\r\n\r\n     \"You will therefore, with such volunteers as are willing to\r\n     join you, and can be expeditiously raised, repair to the\r\n     City of New York, and calling upon the commanding officer of\r\n     the forces of New Jersey for such assistance as he can\r\n     afford, and you shall require, you are to put that city into\r\n     the best posture of defence which the season and\r\n     circumstances will admit, disarming all such persons upon\r\n     Long Island and elsewhere (and if necessary otherwise\r\n     securing them), whose conduct and declarations have rendered\r\n     them justly suspected of designs unfriendly to the views of\r\n     Congress.... I am persuaded I need not recommend dispatch in\r\n     the prosecution of this business. The importance of it alone\r\n     is a sufficient incitement.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Washington had some misgivings as to his authority to\r\nassume military control of New York, and he sought the advice of John\r\nAdams, who was then at Watertown. The latter replied without\r\nhesitation that under his commission as commander-in-chief he had full\r\nauthority. To President Hancock, Washington wrote: \"I hope the\r\nCongress will approve of my conduct in sending General Lee upon this\r\nexpedition. I am sure I mean it well, as experience teaches us that it\r\nis much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves, than it is\r\nto dislodge them after they have got possession.\"]\r\n\r\nWashington wrote at the same time to Governor Trumbull, of\r\nConnecticut, Colonel Lord Stirling, of New Jersey, and the New York\r\nCommittee of Safety, urging them to give Gen. Lee all the assistance\r\nin their power.\r\n\r\nLee, who had been an officer in the British army, serving at one time\r\nunder Burgoyne in Portugal, had already established a reputation for\r\nhimself in Washington's camp as a military authority, and enjoyed the\r\nfull confidence of the commander-in-chief, despite certain\r\neccentricities of manner and an over-confidence in his own judgment\r\nand experience. The defects and weaknesses of his character, which\r\neventually brought him into disgrace as a soldier, were not as yet\r\ndisplayed or understood. At the present time he was eager to be of\r\nessential service to the colonies, and he entered into the New York\r\nproject with spirit. In Connecticut the governor promptly seconded his\r\nefforts, by calling out two regiments of volunteers to serve for six\r\nweeks under the general, and appointed Colonels David Waterbury, of\r\nStamford, and Andrew Ward, of Guilford, to their command. By the 20th,\r\nLee found himself ready to proceed; but while on his way, near\r\nStamford, he received a communication from the Committee of Safety at\r\nNew York, representing that the rumors of his coming had created great\r\nalarm in the city, and earnestly requesting him to halt his troops on\r\nthe Connecticut border, until his object were better known to the\r\ncommittee. Here was something of a dilemma, and it may be asked how it\r\nshould have arisen. Why, indeed, was it necessary to organize a force\r\noutside of New York to secure it? Was not this the time for the city\r\nto prepare for her defence, and welcome assistance from whatever\r\nquarter offered? The answer is to be found in the exceptional\r\npolitical temperament of New York at this time. Her population\r\ncontained a large and powerful loyalist element, which hoped, with the\r\nassistance of the three or four British men-of-war then in the harbor,\r\nto be able to give the place, at the proper moment, into the hands of\r\nthe king's troops. Only a short time before, Governor Tryon had\r\ninformed Howe that it only needed the presence of a small force to\r\nsecure it, and develop a strong loyal support among the inhabitants of\r\nboth the city and colony. The patriotic party had abated none of its\r\nzeal, but it recognized the danger of precipitating matters, and\r\naccordingly pursued what appeared to colonists elsewhere to be a\r\ntemporizing and timid policy, but which proved the wisest course in\r\nthe end. The city was at the mercy of the men-of-war. Any attempt to\r\nseize it could be answered with a bombardment. The situation required\r\nprudent management; above all, it required delay on the part of the\r\nAmericans until they were ready for a decisive step. That the\r\nCommittee of Safety was thoroughly true to the country, no one can\r\ndoubt a moment after reading their daily proceedings. In their letter\r\nto Lee they say: \"This committee and the Congress whose place we fill\r\nin their recess, are, we flatter ourselves, as unanimously zealous in\r\nthe cause of America as any representative body on the continent: so\r\ntruly zealous, that both the one and the other will cheerfully devote\r\nthis city to sacrifice for advancing that great and important cause.\"\r\nBut knowing the state of affairs in their midst better than others,\r\nthey urged caution instead of haste in bringing the war to New York.\r\nIn this case, they informed Lee that no works had been erected in the\r\ncity, that they had but little powder, that they were sending out\r\nships for more without molestation from the men-of-war, their object\r\nbeing kept secret, and that a general alarm then in the dead of\r\nwinter, driving women and children into the country, would work great\r\ndistress. \"For these reasons,\" continue the committee, \"we conceive\r\nthat a just regard to the public cause, and our duty to take a prudent\r\ncare of this city, dictate the impropriety of provoking hostilities at\r\npresent, and the necessity of saving appearances with the ships of war\r\ntill at least the month of March. Though we have been unfortunate in\r\nour disappointments with respect to some of our adventures, yet be\r\nassured, sir, we have not been idle. Our intrenching tools are almost\r\ncompleted to a sufficient number; we are forming a magazine of\r\nprovisions for five thousand men for a month in a place of safety, and\r\nat a convenient distance from this city; we have provided ourselves\r\nwith six good brass field-pieces; have directed carriages to be made\r\nfor our other artillery, and are raising a company of artillery for\r\nthe defence of the colony on the Continental establishment. These\r\nthings, when accomplished, with other smaller matters, and with the\r\narrival of some gunpowder, the prospect of which is not unpromising,\r\nwill enable us to face our enemies with some countenance.\" Lee, with\r\ndue consideration, replied to the committee that he should comply with\r\ntheir request about the troops, and do nothing that could endanger the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 4th of February that the general entered New\r\nYork. On the same day Clinton arrived in the harbor from Boston, with\r\nhis southern expedition, but only to make a brief stay. The coming of\r\nthese officers threw the city into great excitement. Many of the\r\ninhabitants expected an immediate collision, and began to leave the\r\nplace. One Garish Harsin, writing from New York to William Radclift at\r\nRhyn Beck, sums up in a single sentence the effect of the harbor\r\nnews:[20] \"It is impossible to describe the confusion the place was in\r\non account of the regulars being come.\" And when rumors magnified\r\nClinton's two or three transports into a British fleet of nineteen\r\nsail, Harsin informs his friend that the people were taking themselves\r\nout of town \"as if it were the Last Day.\" Pastor Shewkirk, of the\r\nMoravian Church, in his interesting diary[21] of passing events, tells\r\nus that \"the inhabitants began now to move away in a surprising\r\nmanner,\" and that \"the whole aspect of things grew frightful, and\r\nincreased so from day to day.\" To add to the discomfort and suffering\r\nof the people, the weather was very cold, and the rivers full of ice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"New York in the Revolution.\" Published by the New York\r\nMercantile Library Association.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Part II., Document 37.]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety, in their anxiety as to the effect of Lee's\r\noccupation of the city, had already written to the Continental\r\nCongress on the subject, and that body at once sent up a committee,\r\nconsisting of Messrs. Harrison, Lynch, and Allen, to advise with Lee\r\nand the New York Committee. The latter accepted the situation,\r\nconsented to the entry of the troops into town, and at a conference\r\nwith Lee and the Congress Committee on the 6th, agreed to the\r\nimmediate prosecution of defensive measures.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival, the general sent his engineer, Captain William\r\nSmith, \"an excellent, intelligent, active officer,\" to survey and\r\nreport upon the salient points of the position, especially around Hell\r\nGate and on Long Island. Lee and Stirling also went over the ground\r\nseveral times. As a result of these inspections, the general became\r\nconvinced that to attempt a complete defence of the city would be\r\nimpracticable, because the ample sea-room afforded by the harbor and\r\nrivers gave the enemy every advantage, enabling them, with their\r\npowerful fleet, to threaten an attack in front and flank. Lee saw this\r\nat once, and reported his views to Washington, February 19th. \"What to\r\ndo with the city,\" he wrote, \"I own, puzzles me. It is so encircled\r\nwith deep navigable waters, that whoever commands the sea must command\r\nthe town;\" and to the New York Committee he said that it would be\r\nimpossible to make the place absolutely secure. In view of this, he\r\nproposed to construct a system of defences that should have an\r\nalternative object, namely, that in case they should prove inadequate\r\nfor the city's protection, they should at least be sufficient to\r\nprevent the enemy from securing a permanent foothold in it.\r\n\r\nUnder this plan, the line of the East River required the principal\r\nattention, as here it seemed possible to offer the best resistance to\r\nBritish attempts upon the city. First, to cut off the enemy's\r\ncommunication between the Sound and the river, it was proposed to\r\nblockade the passage at Hell Gate by a fort on Horn's Hook, at the\r\nfoot of East Eighty-eighth Street, as well as by works opposite, on\r\nthe present Hallet's Point. A further object of these forts was to\r\nsecure safe transit between Long Island and New York. In the next\r\nplace, batteries were planned for both sides of the river at its\r\nentrance into the harbor, where the city was chiefly exposed. On the\r\nNew York side, a battery was located at the foot of Catherine Street\r\nat the intersection of Cherry, and where the river was narrowest. This\r\nwas called Waterbury's Battery. To cover its fire a stronger work was\r\nordered to be built on Rutgers' \"first hill,\" just above, which was\r\nnamed Badlam's Redoubt, after Captain Badlam, then acting as Lee's\r\nchief artillery officer. Lower down a battery was sunk in a cellar on\r\nTen Eyck's wharf, Coenties Slip, a short distance below Wall Street,\r\nand called Coenties Battery. These three, with part of the Grand\r\nBattery and Fort George, included all the works planned by Lee to\r\nguard the East River from the New York side.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these, works were laid out on the bank opposite on\r\nLong Island, the importance of which was apparent. Not only was the\r\nsite well adapted for guns to sweep the channel and prevent the\r\nenemy's ships from remaining in the river long enough to do the city\r\nserious damage, but it also commanded the city, so as to make it\r\nuntenable by the British should they succeed in occupying it. This\r\nbluff, \"Columbia Heights,\" was in fact the key to the entire\r\nsituation. Lee considered its possession and security of \"greater\r\nimportance\" than New York; and to hold it he proposed establishing\r\nthere an intrenched camp[22] for three or four thousand men,\r\nfortified by \"a chain of redoubts mutually supporting each other.\" Of\r\nthese redoubts, one was located on the edge of the bluff opposite the\r\nCoenties Battery, and stood on the line of Columbia Street, at about\r\nthe foot of the present Clark Street. This came to be known as Fort\r\nStirling. In its rear, near the corner of Henry and Pierrepont\r\nstreets, it was proposed to erect a large citadel; but this, although\r\nbegun, was never completed.[23] Lee's scheme of defence did not\r\ninclude the fortifying of either Red Hook or Governor's Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Lee wrote to Washington, February 19th: \"I wait for some\r\nmore force to prepare a post or retrenched encampment on Long Island,\r\nopposite to the city, for 3000 men. This is, I think, a capital\r\nobject; for, should the enemy take possession of New York, when Long\r\nIsland is in our hands, they will find it almost impossible to\r\nsubsist.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The location and strength of Fort Stirling, the citadel,\r\nand the other works on Long Island, are noted more in detail further\r\nalong in this chapter.]\r\n\r\nThe East River thus provided for, attention was paid to the city and\r\nthe North River side. Lee examined Fort George and the Grand Battery,\r\nbut gave it as his opinion that neither of them could be held under\r\nthe concentrated fire of large ships. He advised, accordingly, that\r\nthe northern face of the fort be torn down, and a traverse built\r\nacross Broadway above it at the Bowling Green, from which the interior\r\nof the work could be raked, should the enemy attempt to land and hold\r\nit. As the North River was \"so extremely wide and deep,\" the general\r\nregarded the obstruction of its passage to the ships as out of the\r\nquestion. Batteries, however, could be erected at various points along\r\nthe west side where it rose to a ridge, and the power of the ships to\r\ninjure the town very considerably diminished. All the streets leading\r\nup from the water were ordered to be barricaded to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom coming up on the flanks; forts were to be erected on Jones',\r\nBayard's, and Lispenard's hills, north of the town, covering the\r\napproach by land from that direction; the roads obstructed to\r\nartillery; and redoubts, redans, and flêches thrown up at defensible\r\npoints throughout the entire island, as far as King's Bridge.[24] \"I\r\nmust observe,\" said Lee to the Committee of Safety, \"that New York,\r\nfrom its circumstances, can with difficulty be made a regular tenable\r\nfortification; but it may be made a most advantageous field of\r\nbattle--so advantageous, indeed, that, if our people behave with\r\ncommon spirit, and the commanders are men of discretion, it must cost\r\nthe enemy many thousands of men to get possession of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: \"_Feb. 23d, 1776._--... General Lee is taking every\r\nnecessary step to fortify and defend this city. The men-of-war are\r\ngone out of our harbor; the Phoenix is at the Hook; the Asia lays\r\nnear Beedlow's Island; so that we are now in a state of perfect peace\r\nand security, was it not for our apprehensions of future danger. To\r\nsee the vast number of houses shut up, one would think the city almost\r\nevacuated. Women and children are scarcely to be seen in the streets.\r\nTroops are daily coming in; they break open and quarter themselves in\r\nany houses they find shut up. Necessity knows no law.\"--_Letter from\r\nF. Rhinelander. \"Life of Peter Van Schaack._\"]\r\n\r\nTo construct these extensive works Lee could muster, two weeks after\r\nhis arrival, but seventeen hundred men. Waterbury's Connecticut\r\nregiment was first on the ground; the First New Jersey Continentals,\r\nas yet incomplete, under Colonel the Earl of Stirling, soon followed;\r\nand from Westchester County, New York, came two hundred minute-men\r\nunder Colonel Samuel Drake. Dutchess County sent down Colonels\r\nSwartwout and Van Ness with about three hundred more; and on the 24th\r\nColonel Ward arrived with his Connecticut regiment, six hundred\r\nstrong, which had rendezvoused at Fairfield. Stirling's regiment was\r\nquartered principally in the lower barracks at the Battery;\r\nWaterbury's at the upper, on the site of the new Court House; Ward's\r\nwas sent to Long Island; and Drake's minute-men were posted at Horn's\r\nHook, opposite Hell Gate, where they began work on the first battery\r\nmarked out for the defence of New York City during the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [signature: John Lasher]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL FIRST NEW YORK CITY BATTALION 1775-1776.\r\n\r\nSteel Engr. F. von Egloffstein N.Y.]\r\n\r\nBut Lee's stay at this point was to be brief. The Continental Congress\r\nappointed him to the command of the newly created Department of the\r\nSouth, and on the 7th of March he left New York in charge of Lord\r\nStirling, who, a month before, had been promoted by Congress to the\r\nrank of brigadier-general. This officer's energy was conspicuous. His\r\npredecessor had already found him \"a great acquisition,\" and he pushed\r\non the defences of the city as rapidly as his resources would permit.\r\nThe force under his immediate command, according to the returns of the\r\n13th, amounted to a total of two thousand four hundred and twenty-two\r\nofficers and men,[25] besides the city independent companies under\r\nColonels John Lasher and William Heyer, and local militia,[26] who\r\nswelled the number to about four thousand. On the 14th, Washington\r\nwrote to Stirling that the enemy appeared to be on the point of\r\nevacuating Boston, and that it was more than probable they would sail\r\nsouthward. \"I am of opinion,\" he wrote, \"that New York is their place\r\nof destination. It is an object worthy of their attention, and it is\r\nthe place that we must use every endeavor to keep from them. For,\r\nshould they get that town, and the command of the North River, they\r\ncan stop the intercourse between the Northern and Southern\r\ncolonies, upon which depends the safety of America. My feelings upon\r\nthis subject are so strong, that I would not wish to give the enemy a\r\nchance of succeeding at your place.... The plan of defence formed by\r\nGeneral Lee is, from what little I know of the place, a very judicious\r\none. I hope, nay, I dare say, it is carrying into execution with\r\nspirit and industry. You may judge of the enemy's keeping so long\r\npossession of the town of Boston against an army superior in numbers,\r\nand animated with the noble spirit of liberty; I say, you may judge by\r\nthat how much easier it is to keep an enemy from forming a lodgment in\r\na place, than it will be to dispossess them when they get themselves\r\nfortified.\" Stirling immediately sent urgent appeals for troops in\r\nevery direction. He ordered over the Third New Jersey Continental\r\nRegiment under Colonel Dayton, and wrote for three hundred picked men\r\nfrom each of the six nearest counties of that State. Ward's and\r\nWaterbury's regiments, which were impatient to return home to attend\r\nto their spring farming, were many of them induced to remain two weeks\r\nbeyond their term of enlistment until Governor Trumbull could supply\r\ntheir places with troops under Colonels Silliman and Talcott. Congress\r\nalso ordered forward five or six Pennsylvania regiments. Meanwhile the\r\nNew York Committee of Safety co-operated zealously with the military\r\nauthorities.[27] At Stirling's request they voted to call out all the\r\nmale inhabitants of the city, black and white, capable of doing\r\n\"fatigue duty,\" to work on the fortifications--the blacks to work\r\nevery day, the whites every other day;[28] and the same orders were\r\nconveyed to the committee of King's County, where the inhabitants were\r\ndirected to report to Colonel Ward, with spades, hoes and pickaxes. To\r\ntroops needing quarters the committee turned over the empty houses in\r\nthe city, or those that were \"least liable to be injured;\" coarse\r\nsheets were ordered for the straw beds in the barracks; the upper\r\nstory of the \"Bridewell\" was converted into a laboratory or armory for\r\nrepairing guns and making cartridges; and all necessary details\r\nprovided for as far as possible. In case of an alarm, the troops were\r\nto parade immediately at the Battery, in the Common, and in front of\r\nTrinity Church. To annoy expected British men-of-war, the committee\r\ndespatched Major William Malcolm, of the Second city battalion, to\r\ndismantle the Sandy Hook Light, which the major effected in a thorough\r\nmanner, breaking what glasses he could not move, and carrying off the\r\noil. On Long Island, a guard of King's County troopers was posted at\r\nthe Narrows, and another at Rockaway, to report the approach of ships;\r\nand in the city, cannon were mounted in the batteries as fast as they\r\nwere completed. On the 20th, Stirling could report that everybody\r\nturned to \"with great spirit and industry,\" and that the work went on\r\n\"amazingly well.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Privates present fit for duty: Stirling's regiment, 407;\r\nWaterbury's, 457; Ward's, 489; Drake's, 104; Swartwout's, 186; Van\r\nNess', 110; Captain Ledyard's company, N.Y., 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: In the chapter on \"The Two Armies,\" some further account\r\nis given of the troops furnished during the campaign by New York and\r\nthe Brooklyn villages.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The committee humored Governor Tryon, however, with a\r\nfew civilities as late as April 4th, when they provided his fleet with\r\n\"the following articles, viz.: 1300 lbs. beef for the 'Asia'; 1000\r\nlbs. beef for the 'Phoenix,' with 18_s._ worth vegetables; 2 qrs.\r\nbeef, 1 doz. dishes, 2 doz. plates, 1 doz. spoons, 2 mugs, 2 barrels\r\nale, for the packet; 6 barrels of beer, 2 quarters of beef for the\r\ngovernor's ship, 'Duchess of Gordon.'\"--_Journal of the Provincial\r\nCongress._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Stirling's orders, March 13th, 1776: \"It is intended to\r\nemploy one half of the inhabitants every other day, changing, at the\r\nworks for the defence of this city; and the whole of the slaves every\r\nday, until this place is put in a proper posture of defence.

The siege, which the\r\nprovincial troops had so successfully maintained for ten months,\r\nterminated to their own unbounded credit and the secret mortification\r\nof the enemy. On the 17th of March the city was evacuated by the\r\nBritish, and immediately occupied by the Americans--an event that had\r\nbeen foreseen and provided for at a council of war held on the 13th,\r\nat General Ward's headquarters in Roxbury. The commander-in-chief\r\nthere stated that every indication pointed to an early departure of\r\nthe enemy from Boston, with the probability that they were destined\r\nfor New York, and he questioned whether it was not advisable to send a\r\npart of the army to that point without delay. The council coincided in\r\nthis opinion, and on the following day the rifle regiment under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hand, and the three companies of Virginia riflemen,\r\nunder Captain Stephenson, were put on the march southward. These were\r\nfollowed on the 18th by five regiments under Brigadier-General Heath,\r\nwho had been ordered to march by way of Providence, Norwich, New\r\nLondon, and the Sound. As the enemy's transports lingered around\r\nBoston for several days, no more troops were sent southward until the\r\n29th, when six regiments were ordered on, under Brigadier-General\r\nSullivan. On the same date Major-General Putnam received orders to\r\nproceed to New York, assume command, and continue the work of\r\nfortifying the city upon the plan adopted by General Lee. On the 1st\r\nof April, Brigadier-General Greene's brigade moved in the same\r\ndirection, and was followed in a day or two by General Spencer's. Five\r\nregiments remained at Boston, under Major-General Ward.\r\n\r\nWaiting until all the troops were on the march, Washington, on April\r\n4th, himself set out from Cambridge for New York. Crowned with his\r\nfirst honors as the deliverer of Boston, he was greeted on his route\r\nwith respectful admiration and enthusiasm. He had come to New England\r\ncomparatively unknown--\"a Mr. Washington, of Virginia;\" he left it\r\nsecure in the affections and pride of its people. Expecting him at\r\nProvidence the next day, the 5th, General Greene, who had been delayed\r\nat that place, ordered two regiments of his brigade--Hitchcock's Rhode\r\nIsland and Little's Massachusetts--to appear in their best form and\r\nescort the general into the city. The minuteness of Greene's\r\ndirections on the occasion furnishes us with the material for a\r\npicture of the personal appearance of the early Continental soldier\r\nwhen on parade. As preserved among the papers of the Massachusetts\r\ncolonel, the order runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Providence April 4, 1776._--Colo. Hitchcock's and\r\n     Colo. Little's regiments are to turn out to-morrow\r\n     morning to escort his Excellency into town, to parade at 8\r\n     o'clock, both officers & men dressed in uniform, & none to\r\n     turn out except those dressed in uniform, & those of the\r\n     non-commissioned officers & soldiers that turn out to be\r\n     washed, both face & hands, clean, their beards shaved, their\r\n     hair combed & powdered, & their arms cleaned. The General\r\n     hopes that both officers & soldiers will exert themselves\r\n     for the honour of the regiment & brigade to which they\r\n     belong. He wishes to pay the honours to the Commander in\r\n     Chief in as decent & respectable a manner as possible.\"[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: MS. Order Book of Colonel Moses Little.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Cooke, of Rhode Island, was not less attentive, and in\r\naddition to calling out \"the several companies of cadets, of\r\ngrenadiers, and light infantry\" in Providence to meet the\r\ncommander-in-chief, he had a house prepared for his reception and the\r\naccommodation of his suite, which, besides his officers, included Lady\r\nWashington and Mr. and Mrs. Custis.[30] Passing on to New London,\r\nwhere he hurried the embarkation of the troops, Washington kept on\r\nalong the shore road, reached New Haven on the 11th, and on the 13th\r\narrived at the city of New York. Putnam had come ten days earlier.\r\nOwing to insufficient transportation and slow sailing on the Sound, it\r\nwas April 24th before the last of the soldiers reported on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: R.I. Hist. Coll. Vol. VI.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new military base in this vicinity was thus fairly established,\r\nand the commander-in-chief, after personally inspecting the position,\r\nurged on the work of defence. As the regiments on their arrival had\r\nbeen quartered at haphazard in the city, he first arranged the army\r\ninto five brigades, with the view of putting them into suitable and\r\npermanent camps. To the command of these he assigned Heath, Spencer,\r\nSullivan, Greene, and Stirling, in the order of their rank. The\r\ntwenty-five battalions which made up the force at this date numbered\r\ntogether not quite ten thousand men.\r\n\r\nBut hardly were the orders for this new arrangement issued before\r\nevents required its modification. Our affairs proving to be in a bad\r\nway in the direction of Canada, it became necessary to despatch\r\nGeneral Sullivan with six regiments to the northward, and on the 29th\r\nof April the troops in New York were formed anew into four brigades,\r\nand assigned to their respective camps. Heath's first brigade was\r\nposted on the Hudson, just without the city above the Canal Street\r\nmarsh and about Richmond Hill; Spencer's second, on the East River,\r\naround the Rutgers' farm and Jones' Hill; and Stirling's fourth, in\r\nthe centre, near Bayard's Hill and the Bowery Road; while Greene's\r\nthird brigade was assigned to \"the ground marked out upon Long\r\nIsland.\" But one work now lay before these soldiers, namely, to put\r\nNew York and its vicinity in a complete state of defence in the\r\nshortest possible time. Howe and his Boston army, it was now known,\r\nhad gone to Halifax instead of sailing for New York; but he could\r\nstill reach, and, with reinforcements from England, attack the city\r\nbefore the Americans were ready to receive him. The situation,\r\naccordingly, admitted of no delays, and digging was made the order of\r\nthe day. No one could have anticipated, however, that preparations\r\nwere to be continued full four months longer before active campaigning\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThis interval of fortifying is not without its interest; and we may\r\ncross, first, with Greene to Long Island, to note what further was\r\ndone towards securing that \"capital\" point in the general system of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the orders of April 24th and 25th it would appear that it was\r\nWashington's original intention to give the Brooklyn command, not to\r\nGreene, but to Sullivan. The latter was assigned to the Third Brigade\r\nbefore going to Canada, and on the 25th the encampment of this brigade\r\nwas ordered to be marked out \"upon Long Island.\" The fact that\r\nSullivan was senior to Greene in rank, and was entitled, as between\r\nthe two, to the honor and responsibility of the separate command, was\r\ndoubtless the ground of his assignment in this case. But a greater\r\nresponsibility was reserved for Sullivan in Canada, and Greene was\r\nsent to Long Island. Owing to bad weather, it was the 3d or 4th of\r\nMay before the latter crossed with troops. He took with him his old\r\nbrigade, consisting of Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvania Riflemen,\r\nhis two favorite Rhode Island regiments under Colonels James Mitchell\r\nVarnum and Daniel Hitchcock, and Colonel Moses Little's regiment from\r\nMassachusetts. These ranked as the First, Ninth, Eleventh, and Twelfth\r\nof the Continental Establishment, and were as well armed and under as\r\ngood discipline as any troops in Washington's army. Hand's regiment,\r\nnumbering four hundred and seventy officers and men, was already on\r\nLong Island, having come from Boston in advance of the brigades, and\r\nwas engaged in scouting and patrol duty at the Narrows and along the\r\ncoast. Varnum's, Hitchcock's, and Little's, having an average strength\r\nof three hundred and eighty each, were the only troops around\r\nBrooklyn.[31] The Long Island militia were not as yet in the field,\r\nand the small company of Brooklyn troopers under Captain Waldron and\r\nLieutenant Boerum, which had patrolled the coast during the early\r\nspring, do not appear on duty again until late in the season.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Ward's, we have seen, was the first regiment stationed\r\non Long Island. It was there from February 24th until about the end of\r\nMarch. The _N.Y. Packet_ of February 29th, 1776, says: \"Saturday last\r\nCol. Ward's regiment arrived here from Connecticut, and embarked in\r\nboats and landed on Nassau [Long] Island.\" Lee gave orders that a\r\nPennsylvania battalion, supposed to be on its way to New York, should\r\nencamp from the Wallabout to Gowanus, but no Pennsylvania troops are\r\nincluded in Stirling's return, and certainly none were on Long Island\r\nuntil Hand's riflemen came from Boston. It is probable that Colonel\r\nChas. Webb's Connecticut Continentals relieved Ward, as Captain Hale\r\nwrites that it had been there three weeks, sometime before May 20th.\r\nGreene's brigade were the next troops to cross over.]\r\n\r\nIt now remained for these regiments to go on fortifying the\r\nwater-front of this site to keep the ships out of the river, and, in\r\naddition, to secure themselves against an attack by land. What Lee's\r\nplan was in reference to Columbia Heights has already been seen. Here\r\nhe proposed to establish a camp with Fort Stirling and the Citadel\r\namong its defences, the former of which had been nearly completed and\r\nthe latter begun by Ward's regiment and the inhabitants. In\r\nconsequence, however, of a move made by General Putnam soon after his\r\narrival, it had evidently become necessary to enlarge this plan.\r\nGovernor's Island, just off the edge of which were moored the British\r\nmen-of-war, had not been occupied by either Lee or Stirling; but it\r\nlay within cannon-shot of the Battery and Columbia Heights, and an\r\nenemy once lodged there could work us mischief. General Putnam noticed\r\nits position, and he had not been here three days before he wrote,\r\nApril 7th, to the President of Congress: \"After getting the works [in\r\nNew York] in such forwardness as will be prudent to leave, I propose\r\nimmediately to take possession of Governor's Island, which I think a\r\nvery important post. Should the enemy arrive here, and get post there,\r\nit will not be possible to save the city, nor could we dislodge them\r\nwithout great loss.\"[32] On the very next night he carried out his\r\nproposal, as appears from the following account of the manoeuvre\r\npreserved among the papers of Colonel G. Selleck Silliman, of\r\nFairfield, Connecticut, who had recently come down to relieve the\r\ntroops under Ward and Waterbury:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Force_, Fourth Series, vol. v., p. 811.]\r\n\r\n\"_Tuesday Morning, 9th April._--Last Evening Draughts were made from a\r\nNumber of Regiments here, mine among the Rest, to the Amount of 1,000\r\nMen. With these and a proper Number of Officers Genl Putnam at\r\nCandle lighting embarked on Board of a Number of Vessels with a large\r\nNumber of intrenching Tools and went directly on the Island a little\r\nbelow the City called Nutten [Governor's] Island where they have been\r\nintrenching all Night and are now at work, and have got a good Breast\r\nWork there raised which will cover them from the fire of the Ships;\r\nand it is directly in the Way of the Ship coming up to the Town. The\r\nAsia has fallen down out of Gun Shot from this Place and it deprives\r\nthe Ships of the only Watering Place they have here without going down\r\ntoward the Hook.\"[33] There was something of the Bunker Hill flavor\r\nabout this move, and it was Prescott's Bunker Hill regiment that was\r\nfirst stationed[34] on the Island, which subsequently became one of\r\nthe strongest posts of the position. At the same time another party\r\noccupied Red Hook,[35] on Long Island, which commanded the channel\r\nbetween the Hook and Governor's Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: MS. letter from Colonel Silliman to his wife, in\r\npossession of Mrs. O.P. Hubbard, New York City.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: General Orders, April 16th, 1776: ... \"Colonel\r\nPrescott's Regiment is to encamp on Governour's Island as soon as the\r\nweather clears. They are to give every assistance in their power to\r\nthe works erecting thereon.\"...]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: \"Monday night 1000 Continental troops stationed here\r\nwent over and took possession of Governor's Island and began to\r\nfortify it; the same night a regiment went over to Red Hook and\r\nfortified that place likewise.\" _New York Packet, April 11, 1776._]\r\n\r\nThe occupation by Putnam of these two points, which was clearly\r\nnecessary for a more effective defence of the East River, required, or\r\nat least resulted in, the modification of Lee's plan, and the adoption\r\nof a new line on Long Island. It was now decided to hold the Brooklyn\r\npeninsula with a chain of works thrown up across the neck from\r\nWallabout Bay to the Gowanus Marsh; and it was in this vicinity that\r\nthe encampment for Greene's brigade was marked out by Mifflin, the\r\nquartermaster-general, and afterwards approved by Washington.[36] By\r\nthe fortunate recovery of the daily orders issued by General Greene on\r\nLong Island, and also of original sketches of the site, it has become\r\npossible to fix the location of this line and the names of the works\r\nwith almost entire accuracy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: General Orders, April 25th, 1776: \"The encampment of the\r\nThird Brigade to be marked out in like manner, upon Long Island, on\r\nSaturday morning. The chief engineers, with the quartermasters, etc.,\r\nfrom each regiment, to assist the quartermaster-general in that\r\nservice. As soon as the general has approved of the encampments marked\r\nout, the troops will be ordered to encamp....\"]\r\n\r\nTo defend the approach between the bay and marsh, the engineers laid\r\nout three principal forts and two redoubts, with breastworks\r\nconnecting them. The site occupied was a favorable one. On the left\r\nrose the high ground, now known as Fort Greene Place or Washington\r\nPark, one hundred feet above the sea-level; and on the right, between\r\nthe main road and the marsh, were lower elevations on lands then owned\r\nby Rutgert Van Brunt and Johannes Debevoise. The flanks were thus well\r\nadapted for defence, and they were near enough each other to command\r\nthe ground between them. Two of the works were erected on the right of\r\nthe road, and received the names of Fort Greene and Fort Box; three\r\nwere on the left, and were known as the Oblong Redoubt, Fort Putnam,\r\nand the redoubt \"on its left.\" In view of the fact that local\r\nhistorians heretofore have put but three fortifications on this line,\r\nwhere, it is now well established, there were five, a more particular\r\ndescription of them becomes necessary. Extending from right to left,\r\nthey were laid out as follows:[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Consult map accompanying this work, entitled \"Plan of\r\nthe Battle of Long Island, and of the Brooklyn Defences in 1776;\" also\r\nthe note in regard to it under the title \"Maps,\" in Part II.]\r\n\r\nFORT BOX.--It has been supposed that the fort by this name occupied an\r\nindependent site south-west of the main line, with the object of\r\ndefending Gowanus Creek where it was crossed by a mill-dam. That it\r\nstood, however, on the right of the line is beyond question. Thus the\r\nletter of a spectator of the battle[38] says: \"Our lines fronted the\r\neast. On the left, near the lowest part of the above-described bay\r\n[Wallabout], was Fort Putnam, near the middle Fort Greene, and towards\r\nthe creek Fort Box.\" In his order of June 1st, General Greene directs\r\nfive companies to take post \"upon the right in Fort Box;\" and on\r\nAugust 16th a fatigue party is detailed \"to form the necessary lines\r\nfrom Fort Box to Fort Putnam,\" clearly indicating that the two were on\r\nthe same continuous line. To confirm the correctness of this locality,\r\nwe have the fort and its name distinctly indicated on the outline map\r\nsketched by President Stiles, of Yale College, in his Diary of\r\nRevolutionary Events. By reference to the fac-simile of the sketch\r\nhere presented, it will be seen that although there are errors in the\r\ndrawing, the relative position of the principal works is preserved,\r\nand the site of Fort Box finally determined. It stands nearest Gowanus\r\nCreek, and on the right of the other forts. The work appears to have\r\nbeen of a diamond shape, and was situated on or near the line of\r\nPacific Street, a short distance above Bond.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: \"Memoirs of the Long Island Historical Society,\" vol.\r\nii., p. 494. \"Battle of Long Island.\" By Thomas W. Field.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: As the British demolished all the Brooklyn works very\r\nsoon after their capture, it would be difficult to fix the exact site\r\nof some of them, but for data which have been preserved. That they\r\nwere destroyed is certain. Baurmeister, the Hessian major, states that\r\nHowe directed the Hessian division to level the \"Brocklands-Leinen,\"\r\nbut recalled the order when General De Heister represented that \"this\r\ncould not be done by soldiers without compensation, especially as it\r\nwould be the work of four weeks.\" According to tradition, the\r\ninhabitants levelled them by Howe's orders. General Robertson\r\ntestified in 1779 that \"there were no vestiges of the lines soon after\r\nthey were taken.\" Cornwallis on the same occasion said that, being\r\ndetached to Newtown after the battle, he had \"no opportunity of going\r\nto Brooklyn till the lines were nearly demolished.\" But with the\r\nassistance of Lieutenant Ratzer's accurate topographical map of New\r\nYork and Brooklyn of 1766-7, the Hessian map published in vol. ii. of\r\nthe Society's _Memoirs_, the plan of the lines thrown up in the 1812\r\nwar, and other documents, the forts of 1776 can readily be located.\r\nRatzer's map shows all the elevations where works would naturally be\r\nput; and the Hessian map, which is a reduction of Ratzer's, adds the\r\nworks. The accuracy of the latter, which heretofore could not be\r\nproved, is now established by the fact that the position of the forts\r\ncorresponds to the location assigned them relatively in Greene's\r\norders. There can be little doubt that this map was made from actual\r\nsurveys soon after the battle, and that the shape as well as the site\r\nof the works and lines is preserved in it. Another guide is the 1812\r\nline as marked out by Lieutenant Gadsden, of the Engineer Corps. A\r\ncopy of the original plan of this line, furnished by the War\r\nDepartment, shows a close correspondence with the Hessian draft. The\r\nsame points are fortified in each case. Fort \"Fireman\" of 1812\r\noccupies the site, or very nearly the site, of Fort Box; Fort\r\n\"Masonic,\" that of Fort Greene; Redoubt \"Cummings,\" that of the Oblong\r\nRedoubt; and \"Fort Greene,\" that of Fort Putnam. The site of the\r\n\"redoubt on the left\" was inclosed, in 1812, in the outer intrenchment\r\nwhich was carried around the brow of the hill. Although the British\r\nobliterated all marks of the Brooklyn defences of 1776, we thus find\r\nnature and the records enabling us to re-establish them to-day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF THE BROOKLYN WORKS IN 1776.\r\n\r\nFACSIMILE FROM THE STILES DIARY\r\n\r\nYale College Library.\r\n\r\n_\"From one who was stationed at Red Hook all last Summer together with\r\na Map of the ground, I learn our Fortifications there were as I here\r\ndraw them out on the Peninsula around Brooklyn Church.\" Dr. Stiles,\r\nMarch 21, 1777._\r\n\r\n_J. Bien Photo. Lith. N.Y._]\r\n\r\nAs to its name, we must assume that it was called Fort Box in honor of\r\nMajor Daniel Box, Greene's brigade-major (an office corresponding to\r\nthe present assistant adjutant-general), whose services were then\r\nhighly appreciated. Box first appears as an old British soldier, who\r\nhad been wounded in the French war, and afterwards as an organizer and\r\ndrill-master of Independent companies in Rhode Island, which\r\nsubsequently furnished many fine officers to the Continental army.[40]\r\nIn a letter to Colonel Pickering in 1779, Greene speaks of him in\r\nflattering terms, as having been invaluable in the earlier years of\r\nthe war. That he was something of an engineer, as well as an\r\nexcellent brigade-major, is evident from the fact that he assisted in\r\nmarking out the lines around Boston in 1775, and later superintended\r\nthe construction of Fort Lee, on the Jersey side. No doubt he had much\r\nto say about the building of the Brooklyn lines, and of the work in\r\nparticular which bore his name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: MS. letter of General Greene to Colonel Pickering,\r\nAugust 24, 1779, in possession of Prof. Geo. Washington Greene, East\r\nGreenwich, L.I.]\r\n\r\nFORT GREENE.--About three hundred yards to the left of Fort Box, a\r\nshort distance above Bond Street, between State and Schermerhorn,\r\nstood Fort Greene, star-shaped, mounting six guns, and provided with a\r\nwell and magazines. Colonel Little, its commander, describes it as the\r\nlargest of the works on Long Island; and this statement is\r\ncorroborated by the fact that its garrison consisted of an entire\r\nregiment, which was not the case with the other forts, and that it was\r\nprovided with nearly double the number of pikes. It occupied an\r\nimportant position on one of the small hills near the centre of that\r\npart of the line lying south-west of Washington Park, and its guns\r\ncommanded the approach by the Jamaica highway. Being the principal\r\nwork on the line, the engineers, or possibly Little's regiment, named\r\nit after their brigade commander.\r\n\r\nOBLONG REDOUBT.--Still further to the left, and on the other side of\r\nthe road, a small circular redoubt, called the \"Oblong Redoubt,\" was\r\nthrown up on what was then a piece of rising ground at the corner of\r\nDe Kalb and Hudson avenues. The reason of its name is not apparent.\r\nGreene's orders refer to it as the \"Oblong Square\" and the \"Oblong\r\nRedoubt.\" Major Richard Thorne, of Colonel Remsen's Long Island\r\nmilitia, speaks of being on guard at \"Fort Oblong\" all night a short\r\ntime before the battle.[41] This redoubt had very nearly direct\r\ncommand of the road, and in connection with Fort Greene was depended\r\nupon to defend the centre of the line.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"_Force_,\" Fifth Series, vol. ii., p. 202.]\r\n\r\nFORT PUTNAM.--From the Oblong Redoubt, the line ascended\r\nnorth-easterly to the top of the hill included in Washington Park,\r\nwhere the fourth in the chain of works was erected. This was Fort\r\nPutnam. Star-shaped like Fort Greene, it was somewhat smaller than the\r\nlatter, and mounted four or five garrison guns. Its strong natural\r\nposition, however, made it the salient point of the line, and it\r\nbecame, as will be seen, the main object of attack by the British\r\nduring and after the battle.[42] The fort may have taken its name, as\r\nusually supposed, from Major-General Israel Putnam; but it is\r\naltogether more probable that it was named after Colonel Rufus Putnam,\r\nthe chief engineer, who marked out many of the works on Long Island as\r\nwell as in New York, and who must have frequently crossed to give\r\ndirections in their construction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Mr. Field states that the site of Fort Putnam was\r\nunfortunately overlooked by the high ground east of it, Greene and his\r\nengineers probably not noticing the fact until after the woods were\r\ncut down. The official surveys of the ground, made before it was\r\nlevelled, show no such commanding elevation, the Fort Putnam Hill\r\nbeing as high as any _within range_; nor can we credit Greene or his\r\nofficers with fortifying a point which was untenable, or with not\r\nobserving that it was untenable. As the engineers of 1812 occupied the\r\nsame site, it could be safely concluded, were no surveys preserved,\r\nthat it was entirely defensible.]\r\n\r\nREDOUBT ON THE LEFT.--At the eastern termination of the hill, a short\r\ndistance from Fort Putnam, and on a lower grade, stood the last of the\r\nworks, which is identified in the orders and letters of the day as the\r\n\"redoubt on the left.\" It was a small affair, and occupied a point at\r\nabout the middle of the present Cumberland Street, nearly midway\r\nbetween Willoughby and Myrtle avenues; but in 1776 the site was twenty\r\nfeet higher, and appeared as a well-defined spur extending out from\r\nFort Putnam. As it was commanded by the latter, its capture by the\r\nenemy would bring them no advantage, while as an American defence it\r\ncould materially assist in protecting the left.\r\n\r\nBetween these five works a line of connecting intrenchments was laid\r\nout, while on the right it was to be continued from Fort Box to the\r\nmarsh, and on the left from the Fort Putnam Hill, \"in a straight\r\nline,\" to the swamp at the edge of Wallabout Bay. Anticipating their\r\nconstruction, we may say that each work became a complete\r\nfortification in itself, being surrounded with a wide ditch, provided\r\nwith a sally-port, its sides lined with sharpened stakes, the garrison\r\narmed with spears to repel storming parties, and the work supplied\r\nwith water and provisions to withstand a siege if necessary. The\r\ngreater part of the line was picketed with abattis, and the woods cut\r\ndown to give full sweep to the fire of the guns. As every thing\r\ndepended upon holding this front, the necessity of making it as strong\r\nas possible was fully realized, and at the time of the engagement in\r\nAugust it was considered a sufficient barrier to the enemy's\r\nadvance.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Some important and interesting information relative to\r\nthe main line at Brooklyn was brought out in 1779 at the examination\r\nof Captain John Montressor, before the Parliamentary Committee which\r\ninvestigated Howe's conduct of the war. Montressor was a British army\r\nengineer, acting as Howe's aid on Long Island. Being one of the\r\ngeneral's witnesses, he naturally made out the American position as\r\nstrong as possible, but the main facts of his testimony are to be\r\naccepted. The examination was in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Q._ Can you give a particular account of the state of those\r\n[Brooklyn] lines?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes--the lines were constructed from Wallabout Bay, on one side\r\nto a swamp that intersects the land between the main land and Read\r\nHook, which terminates the lines. The lines were about a mile and a\r\nhalf in extent, including the angles, cannon proof, with a chain of\r\nfive redoubts, or rather fortresses, with ditches, as had also the\r\nlines that formed the intervals, raised on the parapet and the\r\ncounterscarp, and the whole surrounded with the most formidable\r\nabbaties.\r\n\r\n_Q._ Were those lines finished on every part, from the swamp formed by\r\nthe Wallabout on the left, to the swamp on the right?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes.\r\n\r\n_Q._ Do you know the particulars of the left part of the line towards\r\nthe Wallabout? Have you any reason for knowing that?\r\n\r\n_A._ The line runs straight from the rising ground where Fort Putnam\r\nwas constructed, in a straight line to the swamp that terminates\r\nitself at the bottom of Wallabout Bay.\r\n\r\n_Q._ Was there a possibility of a single man's passing round the left\r\npart of the line?\r\n\r\n_A._ There was not. After entering the lines, Sir William Howe, on the\r\nenemy's evacuating, followed the road to the point, to examine and see\r\nif he could get out at that part, which he could not do, and we were\r\nobliged to return and go out of a sally port of the lines....\r\n\r\n_Q._ Can you say of your own knowledge, that the right redoubt of the\r\nlines at Brooklyn had an abattis before it?\r\n\r\n_A._ I have already said that the whole had an abattis before it.\r\n\r\n[He produces an actual survey of the lines.]...\r\n\r\n_Q._ If any one of these redoubts were taken, did not they flank the\r\nline in such a manner to the right and left that the enemy could not\r\nremain in the lines?\r\n\r\n_A._ I have already said, that they could not be taken by assault, but\r\nby approaches, as they were rather fortresses than redoubts.\"--_A View\r\nof the Evidence Relative to the Conduct of the American War under Sir\r\nWilliam Howe_, etc.; second edition; London, 1779. _Manual of the\r\nCorporation of the City of New York_, 1870, p. 884.\r\n\r\nThe maps in the early London editions of Gordon's and Stedman's\r\nhistories of the war, each put _five_ fortifications on the line from\r\nthe Wallabout to Gowanus Creek.]\r\n\r\nFORT COBBLE HILL.--Passing to the remaining works on Long Island, we\r\nfind a redoubt on the crest of a cone-shaped hill, which stood alone\r\nnear the intersection of the present Court and Atlantic streets, and\r\nwhich was known by the Dutch inhabitants as _Punkiesberg_. As it does\r\nnot appear to have been called Cobble Hill before this date, the\r\nreasonable inference may be drawn that it was so named by Greene's\r\ntroops because of its close resemblance to the Cobble Hill which\r\nformed one of the fortified points in the siege of Boston, but a short\r\ndistance from Winter Hill, where Greene's brigade was posted. In the\r\norders of the day, the redoubt is known as \"Smith's barbette,\"\r\nCaptain William Smith, the engineer whom Lee brought with him, having\r\nit in charge. The work mounted four guns, and, from its central\r\ninterior position, could have prevented the enemy from securing a\r\nfoothold on the peninsula in the rear or flank of the main line in\r\ncase they effected a landing back of Red Hook or crossed Gowanus Creek\r\nabove. This hill was long since cut away.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: One of Greene's orders refers to this fort as follows:\r\n\"_Camp on Long Island, July 19, 1776._--The works on Cobble Hill being\r\ngreatly retarded for want of men to lay turf, few being acquainted\r\nwith that service, all those in Colonel Hitchcock's and Colonel\r\nLittle's regiments, that understand that business, are desired to\r\nvoluntarily turn out every day, and they shall be excused from all\r\nother duty, and allowed one half a pint of rum a day.\" Two guns fired\r\nfrom Cobble Hill were to be the signal that the enemy had landed on\r\nLong Island.]\r\n\r\nREDOUBT AT THE MILL.--Near the corner of the present Degraw and Bond\r\nstreets, a small battery or breastwork, in the form of a right angle,\r\nmounting one gun, was thrown up to cover the narrow passage over a\r\nmill-dam which here crossed Gowanus Creek. It stood at the extremity\r\nof a long low sand-hill, and the dam connected this point with a\r\ntongue of land on the opposite side, on which two mills were built,\r\nknown as the upper or yellow, and lower mills. The upper mill was\r\nimmediately opposite the redoubt, and it was here that the Port Road\r\ncame down to the edge of the creek.\r\n\r\nRED HOOK--FORT DEFIANCE.--This work, already referred to, was\r\noriginally a single water battery, mounting four eighteen-pounders,\r\n_en barbette_, to prevent the passage of ships east of Governor's\r\nIsland, as well as to keep the enemy from landing at the southern\r\nextremity of the peninsula. Washington speaks of it in May as being \"a\r\nsmall, but exceedingly strong\" fort. Lieutenant Samuel Shaw, of Knox's\r\nartillery, who was stationed there most of the summer, states that it\r\nwas named \"Fort Defiance,\" and subsequently strengthened by additional\r\nworks, which, from the Hessian map and the Stiles draft, appear to\r\nhave consisted of a second and larger redoubt connected with the first\r\nby an intrenchment or inclosed way.[45] On the 5th of July, Greene\r\nwrote to Washington that he regarded Red Hook as \"a post of vast\r\nimportance,\" and proposed stationing a considerable force there\r\npermanently, as in that case the commanding officer would be \"more\r\nindustrious to have every thing in readiness, and obstinate in\r\ndefence\" when the attack came; and on the 8th we find the order for\r\n\"Col. Varnum's regiment to remove their encampment to Red Hook, and do\r\nthe duty of that post.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: \"Our fort [Defiance] is much strengthened by new works\r\nand more troops, and it is in so good a posture of defence, that it\r\nwould be almost impossible to take it either by attack or surprise. To\r\nguard against the latter, each man is every other night on\r\nduty.\"--_Memoir of Samuel Shaw_, p. 17.]\r\n\r\nFORT STIRLING.--The first work laid out on Long Island, as we have\r\nseen, was Fort Stirling, which, in connection with batteries on the\r\nNew York side, was designed to command the East River channel. Its\r\nexact site has been a point of dispute. Several writers and old\r\ninhabitants associate the name with the remains of a large\r\nfortification which stood at the corner of Henry and Pierrepont\r\nstreets as late as 1836. It is clear, however, that this was a work\r\nerected by the British during the latter part of the Revolution.\r\nGeneral Robertson, acting as Governor of New York in 1780, wrote to\r\nLord Germaine, May 18th, that, among other works thrown up to make New\r\nYork more secure against an attack by the Americans, \"a large square\r\nfort is built at Brooklyn Heights.\"[46] The traveller Smyth, writing\r\nin the same year, says, \"The town [New York] is entirely commanded by\r\na considerable eminence in Long Island, directly opposite to it, named\r\nBrookland Heights, on which a strong regular fort with four bastions\r\nhas lately been erected by the British troops.\" This exactly describes\r\nthe work in question.[47] The corner of Henry and Pierrepont streets,\r\nmoreover, being a thousand feet back from the river's edge, could not\r\nhave been selected at that time as the site for a strictly water\r\nbattery intended for effective resistance. The fort must be looked for\r\nnearer the edge of the bluff, and there we find it. Both the Stiles\r\nand the Hessian maps place it directly on the bank of the river--the\r\nlatter, a little north of what was then known as the Bamper House, or\r\nat about the intersection of Clark and Columbia streets.[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Documents, Col. Hist. of New York_, vol. viii., p.\r\n792.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The recollections and incidents preserved by Stiles and\r\nFurman go to show that this was not an American-built fort.--_Stiles'\r\nBrooklyn_, vol. i., pp. 314, 315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: A return of the batteries around New York, March 24th,\r\ndescribes Fort Stirling as opposite the \"Fly Market\" in Maiden Lane\r\n[_Force_, Fourth Series, vol. v., p. 480]. Clark, Pineapple, and\r\nOrange streets, Brooklyn, can all be called \"opposite\" Maiden Lane in\r\nNew York. The Hessian map puts the fort nearest the line of Clark.]\r\n\r\nThe fort was a strong inclosed work, mounting eight guns. Ward's men\r\nbroke ground for it about the 1st of March, and continued digging, as\r\ntheir major, Douglas, writes, through \"cold, tedious weather,\" until\r\nother troops took their place.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The work, which was to be known as the _Citadel_, was in\r\nall probability the \"redoubte commencé,\" or unfinished fort, indicated\r\non the Hessian map in the rear and to the south of Fort Stirling. The\r\nsite corresponds with that of the British fort of 1780, corner of\r\nHenry and Pierrepont streets, which was then, as it still is, the\r\nhighest point on Brooklyn Heights, and hence the natural position for\r\na citadel or commanding fortification. Stirling, in his letter to the\r\nPresident of Congress of March 14, says: \"The work [Fort Stirling]\r\nfirst begun on Long Island opposite to this city is almost completed,\r\nand the cannon carried over. The grand citadel there will be marked\r\nout to-morrow, and will be begun by the inhabitants of King's County\r\nand Colonel Ward's Regiment.\"\r\n\r\nThe list of batteries, March 24th, contains a note to the effect that\r\na citadel covering five acres, called the _Congress_, was to be built\r\nin the rear of Fort Stirling. Major Fish writes, April 9th: \"There are\r\n_two_ fortifications on Long Island opposite this city, to command the\r\nshipping.\" One of these was Fort Stirling--the other, undoubtedly, the\r\ncitadel then in process of construction. The latter, though not in as\r\nfavorable a position for the purpose as the former, could still fire\r\non ships entering the river.\r\n\r\nThe position of these two works, taken in connection with Lee's plan\r\nof forming an intrenched camp on Long Island, fortified with a chain\r\nof redoubts, which, according to one of his letters, were to be three\r\nin number, indicates quite clearly that this general intended to hold\r\nsimply the heights along the river. The facts fail to bear out the\r\nsupposition that the lines, as finally adopted on Long Island, were of\r\nLee's planning. Work on the citadel was probably discontinued, because\r\nhis plan was so much enlarged as to make that fortification\r\nunavailable.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreene's soldiers, whose experience around Boston had made them\r\nveterans, at least in the use of the spade, now went to work to throw\r\nup these lines. He reminded them early of the importance of the post,\r\nand the necessity of preparation and vigilance. \"As the security of\r\nNew York greatly dependeth on this _pass_,\" runs his order of May 5th,\r\n\"while these works are constructing, the general hopes the troops will\r\ncarefully forward the same as fast as possible;\" and this he followed\r\nup with the caution that if any soldier left his work without liberty,\r\nhe should do fatigue duty for a whole week. Orders from headquarters\r\nin New York at the same time directed General Greene to report \"all\r\nextraordinaries\" to the commander-in-chief; the officers at Red Hook\r\nand Governor's Island to do the same; and the officer commanding the\r\nriflemen on Long Island to \"constantly report all extraordinaries to\r\nGeneral Greene.\" Although no enemy had yet appeared, every regiment in\r\nthe army was ordered to mount a picket every evening, to lie on their\r\narms, and be ready to turn out at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to follow the troops on Long Island in their routine of\r\ncamp life all through the tedious summer they were to spend on this\r\nground. Digging was the main thing at first, and they had so much of\r\nthis that the officers complained of their inability to keep the men\r\nin clothes, they wore them out so fast, and they made themselves so\r\nbegrimed with dirt at the trenches, that the allowance of soap would\r\nnot clean them; all which moved Greene to write to Washington that it\r\nwould be no more than \"a piece of justice to the troops\" to allow them\r\na double quantity of soap. Their encampment, in the rear of the lines,\r\nappears to have been a pleasant one. The soldiers lived in bell-shaped\r\ntents with board floors, and varied their regulation fare with the\r\nproduce of the Dutch farms; with the permission of their\r\nfield-officers they could occasionally cross on a visit to the city.\r\nTheir general, however, held them closely to duty, and we find in\r\nthese early orders the beginnings of that strictness which\r\nsubsequently made him known, with his other soldierly qualities, as a\r\nthorough disciplinarian. No enemy being near them, the men, when put\r\non guard, perhaps relaxed even ordinary vigilance; but they were soon\r\nbrought up sharply by the general, with the direction that every part\r\nof camp duty must be done with as much exactness as if the British\r\nwere in their front, for bad habits once contracted, they are told,\r\n\"are difficult to get over, and doing duty in a slovenly manner is\r\nboth disgraceful and dangerous to officers and men.\" They were sure of\r\nbeing watched, too, by Lieutenant-Colonel Cornell, of Hitchcock's\r\nregiment, whose habit of reprimanding the men for every neglect had\r\nwon for him the title of \"Old Snarl\" throughout the camp;[50] but his\r\nsubsequent promotion to offices of responsibility showed that in other\r\nquarters his particular qualities were appreciated. As the warm\r\nseason came on, Greene cautioned his soldiers about their health. The\r\n\"colormen\" were to keep the camps clean, and look after the hospitals.\r\nMany soldiers being down with fever in July, the general recommends\r\n\"the strictest attention to the cookery, and that broiling and frying\r\nmeat, so destructive to health, be prohibited;\" going into the water\r\nin the heat of the day is also forbidden. A neglect of these matters\r\nat this critical season, Greene continues, \"may be attended with\r\ndreadful consequences.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Letter from General Greene written at Fort Lee. Mrs.\r\nWilliams' Life of Olney._]\r\n\r\nOccasionally it was found necessary to give the soldiers a sharp\r\nreproof for insulting the inhabitants or trespassing on their\r\nproperty. When the complaint was brought to Greene that some of his\r\nmen had been stealing watermelons, he promptly issued an order that\r\nsuch practices must be punished. \"A few unprincipled rascals,\" he\r\nsaid, \"may ruin the reputation of a whole corps of virtuous men;\" and\r\non another occasion he called upon the soldiers to behave themselves\r\n\"with that decency and respect that became the character of troops\r\nfighting for the preservation of the rights and liberties of America.\"\r\nPerhaps the offenders found an excuse for their conduct in the Tory\r\ncharacter of the complainants; but Greene, though no friend himself to\r\nsuch people, could never accept this as a provocation to justify a\r\nbreach of military discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Tory element in the population required other and sterner\r\ntreatment.[51] It had developed to such an extent in Kings and Queens\r\ncounties as to require its suppression by the civil and military power\r\ncombined. The refusal of the majority of the voters in Queens to send\r\ndelegates to the New York Provincial Convention in 1775 indicated not\r\nonly a confidence on their part that the Home Government would succeed\r\nin crushing the rebellion, but a secret intention as well to give the\r\nBritish troops upon their arrival all the aid and comfort in their\r\npower. As they provided themselves with arms and the British fleet\r\nwith provisions, the Continental Congress took up the matter, ordered\r\nthe arrest of the leaders, and dispatched Colonel Heard, of New\r\nJersey, with a regiment of militia to execute the business. Arrests\r\nwere made, but the complete suppression of the loyalists here was\r\nnever effected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: A history of the Tories on Long Island and in New\r\nYork--the trouble they gave in the present campaign, and the measures\r\ntaken for their suppression--properly forms a subject by itself. The\r\nscope of the present work admits of but brief allusions to them.\r\nHowever honest this class of the population may have been in taking\r\nsides with the British, and whatever sympathy may be expressed for\r\nthem in their trials, losses, and enforced dispersion during and at\r\nthe end of the war, there was obviously no course left to the\r\nAmericans, then in the midst of a deadly struggle, but to treat them\r\nas a dangerous and obstructive set. The New York Provincial Congress,\r\nin the fall of the year and later, dealt with them unsparingly; and no\r\nman wished to see the element rooted out more than John Jay--a fact to\r\nbe borne in mind by those who condemn Lee and other American officers\r\nfor attempting to banish the Long Island Tories, as a military\r\nprecaution, in the early part of the year.]\r\n\r\nWhile Lee was in command he saw no solution of the problem other than\r\nto remove the entire Tory population to some other quarter where they\r\ncould do less mischief in the event of active operations; but\r\nCongress, to the regret of Washington, could not sanction so radical a\r\nmethod. Greene did his best to root out this element, but we may\r\nimagine that it was uncongenial work, and that he took far more\r\ninterest in the progress of his redoubts than in chasing suspected\r\npersons on the island.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: What General Greene thought of the Tories, and what\r\ntreatment he proposed in certain cases, appears from a report on the\r\nsubject signed by Generals Heath, Spencer, Greene, and Stirling, and\r\nsubmitted to Washington towards the close of June: \"With regard to the\r\ndisaffected inhabitants who have lately been apprehended,\" say these\r\nofficers, \"we think that the method at present adopted by the County\r\nCommittee, of discharging them on their giving bonds as a security for\r\ntheir good behavior, is very improper and ineffectual, and therefore\r\nrecommend it to your Excellency to apply to the Congress of this\r\nprovince to take some more effectual method of securing the good\r\nbehavior of those people, and in the mean time that your Excellency\r\nwill order the officers in whose custody they are to discharge no more\r\nof them until the sense of the Congress be had thereon.\"--_Journals of\r\nthe N.Y. Prov. Congress_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Colonel Huntington wrote to Governor Trumbull, June\r\n6th, as follows: \"Long Island has the greatest proportion of Tories,\r\nboth of its own growth and of adventitious ones, of any part of this\r\ncolony; from whence some conjecture that the attack is to be made by\r\nthat way. It is more likely to be so than not. Notwithstanding the\r\nvigilance of our outposts, we are sure there is frequent intercourse\r\nbetween the Asia and the shore, and that they have been supplied with\r\nfresh meat. New guards have lately been set in suspected places, which\r\nI hope will prevent any further communication.\"--_Force_, 4th Series,\r\nvol. vi., p. 725.]\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of June the works around Brooklyn appear to have so far\r\nprogressed as to admit of the mounting of some of the cannon, and on\r\nthe evening of that date the troops were ordered to parade with arms\r\nand man the lines. On the 17th the general assigned them to permanent\r\npositions as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Colonel Varnum's regiment is to take Fort Box and the\r\n     Oblong Redoubt for their alarm-posts--Fort Box, six\r\n     companies; Oblong Redoubt, two companies. Captain\r\n     Wolverton's Independent Company[53] to join those in the\r\n     redoubt, and to receive orders from Colonel Varnum.\r\n\r\n     Colonel Hitchcock's regiment to take Fort Putnam and the\r\n     fort or redoubt on the left of it for their alarm-posts.\r\n\r\n     Colonel Little's regiment to take Fort Greene for their\r\n     alarm-posts.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: This was a company of New Jersey Minute-men from Essex\r\nCounty, which had been sent over to Long Island on May 17th.]\r\n\r\nTo impress his soldiers with his own sense of the great importance of\r\nthe Long Island front, Greene added the determined words: \"In case of\r\nan attack, _all these posts are to be defended to the last\r\nextremity_.\" And Colonel Little, who had proved his fitness to command\r\nthe post assigned him by his cool and soldierly conduct at Bunker\r\nHill, quietly resolved that if the enemy assaulted Fort Greene it\r\nshould never be surrendered while he was alive.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Colonel Little to his son. Doc. No. 9.]\r\n\r\nGuards were now stationed at the forts and greater vigilance enjoined\r\nabout the camp. Even as early as May 25th, when the works were still\r\nfar from complete, the orders were strict that none but a general\r\nofficer should be admitted to them without special leave. The lines\r\nwere to be manned every morning \"between day and sunrise,\" and the\r\ntroops exercised at parapet firing. The orders of July 1st directed\r\nthe commanding officers of the regiments \"to make a line round each of\r\nthe forts and fortifications for the troops to begin a fire on the\r\nenemy if they attempt to storm the works, and the troops are to be\r\ntold not to fire sooner than the enemy's arrival at these lines,\r\nunless commanded. The line should be about eighty yards from the\r\nparapet.\" The officers of the guards were to be accountable for every\r\nthing in the forts, but particularly for the rum lodged there for the\r\nuse of the men in time of action. Provisions also were to be supplied\r\nto each alarm-post \"in case of siege,\" and the water-casks kept\r\nconstantly full of fresh water. To assure the effectiveness of the\r\nmeans of defence, one hundred spears were to be placed in Fort Greene,\r\nthirty in the works to the right, twenty in the Oblong Redoubt, fifty\r\nin Fort Putnam, and twenty to the left of it.\r\n\r\nAnd so the work went on under Greene's eye, and by the middle of\r\nsummer his troops[55] had inclosed themselves on the Brooklyn\r\npeninsula, with lines which, though unfinished, were still of very\r\nrespectable strength.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: It is a somewhat singular fact, indicating perhaps the\r\nscantiness of our material heretofore, that none of the local accounts\r\nof operations on Long Island mention either Hitchcock's, Varnum's, or\r\nLittle's regiments in any connection, whereas these, with Hand's,\r\nformed the permanent garrison on that side and threw up the greater\r\npart of the works.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRecrossing the river to New York, we find the other brigades there at\r\nwork as uninterruptedly as Greene's on Long Island. The many\r\nwell-known \"general orders\" issued by the commander-in-chief during\r\nthis season testify to the great amount of fatigue duty performed by\r\nthe troops. Washington regretted that the necessity for it left so\r\nlittle opportunity for drilling and he urged his officers to make the\r\nmost of what time they had for this purpose. But his chief anxiety was\r\nto have the defences pushed on, and by the middle of June the\r\nprincipal works were completed or well under way. The location and\r\nnames of these are indicated in the orders and maps of the day.[56]\r\nBeginning on the North River side and continuing around the city, they\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: In locating the works in New York City, the writer\r\nfollows the list of batteries reported March 24th, 1776 (Force, 4th\r\nSeries, vol. v., p. 480); Putnam's order of May 22d, naming the\r\nseveral works; Knox's artillery returns of June 10th, giving the\r\nnumber of guns in each; and Hills' map of the fortifications, drawn at\r\nthe close of the war. The first list shows the works as they stood at\r\nabout the time the Boston troops came down, and which Lee had planned.\r\nThere are alterations and additions in Putnam's and Knox's lists,\r\nwhich are to be followed where they differ from the list of March\r\n24th. Although many other works were erected, no names appear to have\r\nbeen attached to them, those only being designated which occupied the\r\nmost important points and were provided with guns and garrisons.\r\n\r\nThe Hills map is indispensable in this connection. John Hills,\r\nformerly a British engineer, surveyed the city and island of New York\r\nas far as Thirty-fourth Street in 1782, and in 1785 made a careful map\r\nof the same, which John Lozier, Esq., presented to the Common Council\r\nin 1847. This is still preserved, and is consulted at times for\r\nofficial purposes. In addition to giving all the streets, blocks,\r\ndocks, and squares, Hills added all the works thrown up in and around\r\nthe city during the Revolution, giving their exact location and shape.\r\nPart of the lines have a confused appearance, but they become clear on\r\nreferring to the following memorandum on the map: \"All the works\r\ncolored yellow were erected by the Forces of the United States in\r\n1776. Those works colored Orange were erected by Do and repaired by\r\nthe British Forces. Those works colored Green were erected by the\r\nBritish Forces during the War.\" In the map of New York accompanying\r\nthe present work, Hills' \"yellow\" line has been followed, showing all\r\nthe American forts. Their location corresponds precisely with that\r\nwhich Putnam gives, so far as he names them; and by projecting the\r\npresent streets over Hills' plan, it is possible to ascertain where\r\nthey stood in the plan of our modern city.]\r\n\r\nGRENADIER BATTERY.--This was a \"beautiful\" circular battery, situated\r\non the bank of the North River where it ran out into a well-defined\r\nbluff, at the corner of the present Washington and Harrison streets.\r\nCaptain Abraham Van Dyck's Grenadier Company of New York City\r\nIndependents built it while Lee and Stirling were in command, and\r\nreceived the thanks of Washington in general orders for the skilful\r\nmanner in which they had executed their work. The fort mounted two\r\ntwelve-pounders and two mortars. The grenadier company was organized\r\nby Stirling a few years before, when he lived in New York, and he\r\nwatched the construction of the battery with considerable pride. The\r\n_Pennsylvania Gazette_ of May 8th, 1776, contains a letter from\r\nCaptain Van Dyck to Stirling, informing him of the completion of the\r\nwork, and desiring \"the approbation of their former captain.\" Stirling\r\nreplied that he had frequently admired the battery, and reflected with\r\n\"real satisfaction\" on the hour when he formed the company.\r\n\r\nJERSEY BATTERY.--A short distance below, on the line of Reade Street,\r\njust west of Greenwich, stood the Jersey Battery--a five-sided work,\r\nmounting two twelve and three thirty-two pounders. A line of\r\nintrenchments connected these two batteries, and, extending beyond on\r\neither side, made the position a particularly strong one. Their guns\r\nhad the range of the bank up and down the river, and could enfilade an\r\nenemy attempting to land in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nMcDOUGALL'S AND THE OYSTER BATTERY.--The works next below on the\r\nHudson consisted of two batteries situated on the high ground in the\r\nrear and to the south of Trinity Church. The one on the bluff near the\r\nchurch, or on the line of the present Rector Street, a little east of\r\nGreenwich, was known under Stirling as McDougall's Battery; but this\r\nname does not appear in the return of June 10th, and in its place in\r\nthe order of the works we have the \"Oyster\" Battery. It is possible\r\nthat this was the work a little south of McDougall's, at the\r\nintersection of the present Morris and Greenwich streets. Its location\r\nis described by Putnam in May as \"behind General Washington's\r\nhead-quarters.\"[57] It mounted two thirty-two-pounders and three\r\ntwelve-pounders. In March, McDougall's Battery was provided with six\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK.--This reference\r\ncreates some uncertainty as to the particular house occupied by\r\nWashington in New York during the first part of the campaign. If the\r\nsite of the Oyster Battery were known exactly the house could be\r\nidentified. On the other hand, if headquarters, as generally supposed,\r\nwere at the Kennedy Mansion, No. 1 Broadway, then the battery should\r\nhave stood still lower down, at the corner of Battery Place and\r\nGreenwich Street; but the Grand Battery terminated there, and Hills'\r\nmap shows no distinct battery at that point. Mr. Lossing states\r\n(\"Field Book of the Rev.,\" vol. ii., p. 594, n.) that Washington, on\r\nhis first arrival in the city, took up his quarters at 180 Pearl,\r\nopposite Cedar Street, his informant being a survivor of the\r\nRevolution, and that, on his return from a visit to Philadelphia, June\r\n6th, he went to the Kennedy House. That Washington, however, spent the\r\ngreater part of the summer at the \"Mortier House,\" on Richmond Hill,\r\nis well known. He was there on June 22d and probably much earlier, as\r\nappears in _Force_, 4th Series, vol. vi., p. 1157, where one Corbie is\r\ndescribed as keeping a tavern \"to the south-east of General\r\nWashington's house, to the westward of Bayard's woods, and north of\r\nLispenard's meadows.\" The house referred to was the Mortier. From Mr.\r\nLossing's informant, and the reference in the orders of August 8th,\r\nwhich speaks of the \"old head-quarters on the Broadway,\" we may\r\nconclude that Washington first put up at 180 Pearl Street; that if he\r\nthen went to the Kennedy House at all, it was but for a short time;\r\nthat it is more likely, from the position of the batteries, that the\r\nhouse he did occupy was one of the two or three next above it; and\r\nthat in June he moved his quarters to the Mortier House, where he\r\nremained until September 14th, when he went to the Morris Mansion at\r\nHarlem Heights. The Kennedy House was Colonel Knox's artillery\r\nheadquarters during part if not all of the time, his wife being with\r\nhim there up to July 12th. (_Drake's Life of Knox._)]\r\n\r\nFORT GEORGE AND THE GRAND BATTERY.--These works at the lower end of\r\nthe city had been pronounced almost useless by Lee, but as it was of\r\ncourse necessary to include that point in the system of defence they\r\nwere repaired and greatly strengthened under Washington. In Fort\r\nGeorge were mounted two twelve-pounders and four thirty-two-pounders.\r\nThe walls of the Grand Battery were banked up from within, and mounted\r\nthirteen thirty-two-pounders, one twenty-four-pounder, three\r\neighteen-pounders, two twelve-pounders, one thirteen-inch brass\r\nmortar, two eight-inch and one ten-inch iron mortars.\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL BATTERY.--A small work on the Whitehall dock on the East\r\nRiver, and practically a continuation of the Grand Battery. It carried\r\ntwo thirty-two-pounders.\r\n\r\nWATERBURY'S BATTERY.--On the dock at the north-east angle of Catherine\r\nand Cherry streets, mounting, in June, two twelve-pounders.\r\n\r\nBADLAM'S REDOUBT.--On the hill above, south of Market and between\r\nMadison and Monroe streets. It mounted seven guns in March, but\r\nappears not to have been occupied later in the season.\r\n\r\nSPENCER'S REDOUBT.--This was either the horseshoe redoubt at the\r\nintersection of Monroe and Rutgers streets, or the larger star redoubt\r\nbetween Clinton and Montgomery, east of Henry Street.[58] It mounted\r\ntwo twelve-pounders and four field-pieces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Spencer's Brigade probably built both works, as it was\r\nstationed in the vicinity of both. Colonel John Trumbull, who was then\r\nSpencer's brigade major, and afterwards in the Canada army, says in\r\nthe \"Reminiscences\" of his own time: \"The brigade to which I was\r\nattached was encamped on the (then) beautiful high ground which\r\nsurrounded Colonel Rutgers' seat near Corlear's Hook.\"]\r\n\r\nJONES' HILL.--From Spencer's Redoubt a line of intrenchments extended\r\naround along the crest of the high land above Corlear's Hook to a\r\ncircular battery on the northern slope of Jones' Hill, a little north\r\nof the intersection of Broome and Pitt streets, and was pierced for\r\neight guns. During Stirling's command it was proposed to call this\r\nfortification \"Washington,\" but it was known subsequently simply as\r\nJones' Hill. From this battery the works continued along the line of\r\nGrand Street to the Bowery, and included two more circular\r\nbatteries--one on Grand at the corner of Norfolk Street, and the other\r\nnear the corner of Grand and Eldridge streets.\r\n\r\nBAYARD'S HILL REDOUBT.--Upon this commanding site, west of the Bowery,\r\nwhere Grand and Mulberry streets intersect, was erected a powerful\r\nirregular heptagonal redoubt, mounting eight nine-pounders, four three\r\npounders, and six royal and cohorn mortars. It had the range of the\r\ncity on one side and the approach by the Bowery on the other. Lasher's\r\nNew York Independent companies first broke ground for it about the 1st\r\nof March, and continued digging there as well as on the redoubt around\r\nthe hospital until May 16th, when they were relieved, with\r\nWashington's \"thanks for their masterly manner of executing the work\r\non Bayard's Hill.\"[59] In the March return this battery is called the\r\n\"Independent Battery,\" and it also received the name of \"Bunker Hill,\"\r\nwhich was retained by the British during their occupation; but its\r\nproper name as an American fort was \"Bayard's Hill Redoubt,\" this\r\nhaving been given to it officially in general orders; and it was so\r\ncalled in letters and orders repeatedly through the summer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Force_, 4th Series, vol. v., p. 492. Compare, also,\r\nDocuments 38 and 41.]\r\n\r\nTHOMPSON'S BATTERY.--This was the name given to the work thrown up at\r\nHorn's Hook by Colonel Drake's Westchester minute-men soon after Lee's\r\narrival. It mounted eight pieces.[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: This work stood at the foot of East Eighty-eighth\r\nStreet. See Document 41. Some ten years after the war, Archibald\r\nGracie occupied this site, and it became known as Gracie's Point. The\r\nwriter of a city guide-book in 1807, referring to Mr. Gracie, says:\r\n\"His superb house and gardens stand upon the very spot called\r\n_Hornshook_, upon which a fort erected by the Americans in 1776 stood\r\ntill about the year 1794, when the present proprietor caused the\r\nremains of the military works to be levelled, at great expense, and\r\nerected on their rocky base his present elegant mansion and\r\nappurtenances.\"--_The Picture of New York, etc., 1807, New York._]\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR'S ISLAND.--The forts erected on this island were among the\r\nstrongest around New York. According to a letter from Colonel Prescott\r\nof July 3d, they consisted of a citadel with outworks, and were\r\ngarrisoned during the latter part of the summer by Prescott's and\r\nNixon's regiments. The works mounted in June four thirty-two and four\r\neighteen pounders.\r\n\r\nPAULUS OR POWLE'S HOOK.--The point of land on the New Jersey side,\r\nopposite the city, and which is now the site in part of Jersey City.\r\nWorks were commenced here about May 20th, and in June they mounted\r\nthree thirty-two-pounders, three twelve-pounders, and two\r\nthree-pounder field-pieces.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The fortifications erected at the upper part of the\r\nisland are noticed in Chapter V. Mr. Lossing, it should be said, gives\r\na very full list of the Revolutionary works in and around New York\r\n(\"Field Book of the Rev.,\" vol. ii., p. 593), from which the list as\r\ngiven here, based on Hills' map, differs in several particulars.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, several other redoubts were erected north of the\r\ntown, in which no cannon were mounted, and which had no names. They\r\nwere probably thrown up to be ready for occupation in case the enemy\r\nsucceeded in landing above the city. There was a circular battery at\r\nthe corner of Broome and Forsyth streets; another in the middle of\r\nBroadway, opposite White Street; another, of octagonal shape, near the\r\ncorner of Spring and Mercer streets; a half-moon battery above this,\r\nbetween Prince and Spring, on the line of Thompson Street; another on\r\nthe northwesterly continuation of Richmond Hill, at McDougall and\r\nHouston streets; and still another on the river-bank, near the\r\njunction of Christopher and Greenwich streets. The hospital on Duane\r\nStreet was strongly fortified, and breastworks were thrown up at\r\nnumerous points between and around the forts. On June 10th the entire\r\nnumber of guns fit for service in and around New York was one hundred\r\nand twenty-one, thirty-three of which were held as a reserve for field\r\nservice, \"to be run where the enemy shall make their greatest\r\nefforts.\" The mortars were nineteen in number.\r\n\r\nAs for barricades, the city was full of them. Some were built of\r\nmahogany logs taken from West India cargoes. Not a street leading to\r\nthe water on either side that was not obstructed in this manner; so\r\nthat, had the enemy been able to gain a footing in the city under the\r\nfire of their ships, they would still have found it, to use Lee's\r\nexpression, \"a disputable field of battle.\" The City Hall Park was\r\nalmost entirely inclosed. There was a barrier across Broadway in front\r\nof St. Paul's Church, another at the head of Vesey Street, and others\r\nat the head of Barclay, Murray, and Warren. On the Park Row or Chatham\r\nStreet side a barricade stretched across Beekman Street; another, in\r\nthe shape of a right angle, stood in Printing House Square, one face\r\nopposite Spruce Street, the other looking across the Presbyterian\r\nchurchyard and Nassau Street;[62] another ran across Frankfort\r\nStreet; another at the entrance of Centre Street; and still another\r\nnear it, facing Chatham Street.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: One side of this barricade ran in front of the _Times_,\r\nand the other in front of the _Tribune_ building.]\r\n\r\nAnother element in the defence was a motley little fleet, made up of\r\nschooners, sloops, row-galleys, and whale-boats, and placed under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel Benjamin Tupper,[63] who had\r\ndistinguished himself by a naval exploit or two in Boston Harbor\r\nduring the siege. Crews were drafted from the regiments and assigned\r\nto the various craft, whose particular mission was to scour the waters\r\nalong the New Jersey and Long Island coast, to watch for the British\r\nfleets, and prevent communication between the Tories and the enemy's\r\nships already lying in the harbor. Tupper, as commodore, appears first\r\nin the sloop Hester as his flag-ship, and later in the season in the\r\nLady Washington, while among his fleet were to be found the Spitfire,\r\nGeneral Putnam, Shark, and Whiting. The gallant commodore's earliest\r\ncruises were made within the Narrows, along the Staten Island shore,\r\nand as far down as Sandy Hook, where he attempted the feat of\r\ndestroying the light-house. But he found this structure, which the\r\nenemy had occupied since Major Malcom dismantled it in March, a hard\r\npiece of masonry to reduce. He attacked it confidently, June 21st,\r\nafter demanding its surrender, but retired when he found that an\r\nhour's bombardment made no impression upon its walls.[64] He kept a\r\ngood lookout along these waters, gathered information from deserters,\r\nand when reporting on one occasion that the enemy's fleet were short\r\nof provisions and the men reduced to half allowance, he added, with\r\nunction, \"May God increase their wants!\" A little later we meet again\r\nwith the adventuresome Tupper and his flotilla.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: This officer was Lieutenant-Colonel of Jonathan Ward's\r\nMassachusetts Regiment, and subsequently became colonel in the\r\nMassachusetts Continental Line.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Force_, 4th Series, vol. vi., p. 1011.]\r\n\r\nAs the soldiers went on with their exacting duties, the monotony of\r\nthe routine was now and then relieved by some diversion or excitement.\r\nOne day there is \"Tory-riding\"[65] in the city, in which citizens\r\nappear to have figured principally. Then the whole camp is startled by\r\nthe report that a \"most accursed scheme\" had come to light, just \"on\r\nthe verge of execution,\" by which Washington and all his generals were\r\nto have been murdered, the magazines blown up, and the cannon spiked\r\nby hired miscreants in the army at the moment the enemy made their\r\ngrand attack upon the city.[66] Again, on the 9th of July, the\r\nbrigades are all drawn up on their respective parade-grounds, listen\r\nto the reading for the first time of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand receive it, as Heath tells us, \"with loud huzzas;\" and, finally,\r\nto celebrate the event, a crowd of citizens, \"Liberty Boys,\" and\r\nsoldiers collect that evening at Bowling Green and pull down the\r\ngilded statue of King George, which is then trundled to Oliver\r\nWolcott's residence at Litchfield, Ct., for patriotic ladies to\r\nconvert into bullets for the American soldiers.[67]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: \"_Thursday, 13th June._--Here in town very unhappy and\r\nshocking scenes were exhibited. On Munday night some men called Tories\r\nwere carried and hauled about through the streets, with candles forced\r\nto be held by them, or pushed in their faces, and their heads burned;\r\nbut on Wednesday, in the open day, the scene was by far worse;\r\nseveral, and among them gentlemen, were carried on rails; some\r\nstripped naked and dreadfully abused. Some of the generals, and\r\nespecially Pudnam and their forces, had enough to do to quell the\r\nriot, and make the mob disperse.\"--_Pastor Shewkirk's Diary, Doc.\r\n37._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The particulars of this plot need hardly be repeated;\r\nindeed, they were never fully known. It was discovered that an attempt\r\nhad been made to enlist American soldiers into the king's service, who\r\nat the proper time should assist the enemy in their plans. They were\r\nto spike cannon, blow up magazines, and, as at first reported,\r\nassassinate our generals; but the latter design seems not to have been\r\nproved, though universally believed. Governor Tryon and Mayor\r\nMatthews, of the city, were suspected of furthering the plot and\r\nfurnishing the funds. Matthews was arrested at Flatbush by a party of\r\nofficers under Colonel Varnum, but the evidence against him was\r\ninsufficient. Among the soldiers implicated was Thomas Hickey, of\r\nWashington's guard, who was tried by court-martial, found guilty of\r\nsedition, mutiny, and correspondence with the enemy, and executed in\r\nthe presence of the army on June 28th. Something of the feeling\r\nexcited by the discovery of the plot is exhibited in the letter from\r\nSurgeon Eustis of Colonel Knox's regiment (_Document_ 39). This is\r\nbetter known as the \"Hickey Plot.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The following memorandum, preserved among Governor\r\nWolcott's papers, is of interest in this connection:\r\n\r\n\"An Equestrian Statue of George the Third of Great Britain was erected\r\nin the City of New York on the Bowling Green at the lower end of\r\nBroadway. Most of the materials were _lead_ but richly _gilded_ to\r\nresemble gold. At the beginning of the Revolution this statue was\r\noverthrown. Lead being then scarce and dear, the statue was broken in\r\npieces and the metal transported to Litchfield a place of safety. The\r\nladies of this village converted the Lead into Cartridges for the\r\nArmy, of which the following is an account. O.W.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marvin,                    Cartridges        6,058\r\nRuth Marvin,                        \"            11,592\r\nLaura Wolcott,                      \"             8,378\r\nMary Ann Wolcott,                   \"            10,790\r\nFrederick   \"                       \"               936\r\nMrs. Beach,                         \"             1,802\r\nMade by sundry persons              \"             2,182\r\nGave Litchfield Militia on alarm,                    50\r\nLet the Regiment of Col.

It\r\nwas full time for them to make their appearance. Nearly three months\r\nand a half had elapsed since the evacuation of Boston; the spring and\r\na whole month of summer had gone; the best season for active movements\r\nwas passing rapidly; and unless the British began operations soon,\r\nall hope of conquering America \"in one campaign\" would have to be\r\nabandoned. Rumors of their coming took definite shape in the last week\r\nof June, when word reached camp that an American privateer had\r\ncaptured a British transport with more than two hundred Highlanders as\r\nprisoners. On the 25th and 26th three or four large ships arrived off\r\nSandy Hook, one of which proved to be the Greyhound, with Sir William\r\nHowe on board; on the 29th a fleet of forty-five sail anchored off the\r\nsame point, and four days later the number had increased to one\r\nhundred and thirty.[68] This was the fleet from Halifax with Howe's\r\nBoston veterans. Preparations were made to land them on the Long\r\nIsland coast near the Narrows; but on being informed that the\r\nAmericans were posted on a ridge of hills not far distant, Howe\r\ndisembarked his troops opposite on Staten Island,[69] and there went\r\ninto camp to wait the arrival of the reinforcements from England under\r\nAdmiral Howe. The middle of July saw these also encamped on the\r\nisland, with the fleet increased to nearly three hundred transports\r\nand ships of war. On the 1st of August there was an unexpected arrival\r\nin the shape of the discomfited expedition under Generals Clinton and\r\nCornwallis, that was to gain a foothold in the South;[70] and last of\r\nall, on the 12th of August came the British Guards and De Heister's\r\nHessians, after a tedious voyage of thirteen weeks from Spithead,\r\ncompleting Howe's force, and swelling the fleet in the Narrows to more\r\nthan four hundred ships. England had never before this sent from her\r\nshores a more powerful military and naval armament upon foreign\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: \"For two or three days past three or four ships have\r\nbeen dropping in, and I just now received an express from an officer\r\nappointed to keep a lookout on Staten Island, that forty-five arrived\r\nat the Hook to-day--some say more; and I suppose the whole fleet will\r\nbe in within a day or two.\"--_Washington to Hancock, June 29th._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Extract of a letter from an officer in the Thirty-fifth\r\nRegiment at Staten Island, July 9th, 1776: \"Our army consisted of 6155\r\neffectives, on our embarkation at Halifax; they are now all safe\r\nlanded here, and our head-quarters are at your late old friend, Will\r\nHick's Mansion house.\"--_London Chronicle._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The expedition sailed from Cork for the Cape River in\r\nNorth Carolina, where Clinton joined it. It was expected that the\r\nloyalists in the State would rise in sufficient numbers to give the\r\nexpeditionary corps substantial aid; but not over eighteen hundred\r\nwere mustered, and these under General McDonald were completely\r\ndefeated by the North Carolina Militia under Colonels Caswell and\r\nLillington at Moore's Creek Bridge on the 27th of February. The\r\nexpedition then moved against Charleston, S.C., and there met with the\r\nfamous repulse from Colonel Moultrie off Charleston Harbor on the 28th\r\nof June. Clinton and Cornwallis after this could do nothing but join\r\nHowe at New York.]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the enemy hastened Washington's preparations. The\r\ntroops which Congress had called out to reinforce his army were coming\r\nin too slowly, and expresses were sent to governors, assemblies, and\r\ncommittees of safety, announcing the appearance of the enemy, and\r\nurging in the most pressing terms the instant march of the\r\nreinforcements to New York. To his soldiers with him the\r\ncommander-in-chief issued both warning and inspiring orders. On the 2d\r\nof July, a few days after Howe arrived, he reminded them that the time\r\nwas at hand which would probably determine whether Americans were to\r\nbe freemen or slaves. \"The fate of unborn millions,\" he said, \"will\r\nnow depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. Our\r\ncruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us no choice but a brave resistance\r\nor the most abject submission. This is all we can expect. We have,\r\ntherefore, to resolve to conquer or die. Our country's honor calls\r\nupon us for a vigorous and manly exertion, and if we now shamefully\r\nfail we shall become infamous to the whole world. Let us, therefore,\r\nrely upon the goodness of the cause and the aid of the Supreme Being,\r\nin whose hands victory is, to animate and encourage us to great and\r\nnoble actions. The eyes of all our countrymen are now upon us, and we\r\nshall have their blessings and praises, if happily we are the\r\ninstruments of saving them from the tyranny meditated against them....\r\nAny officer or soldier, or any particular corps, distinguishing\r\nthemselves by any acts of bravery and courage, will assuredly meet\r\nwith notice and rewards; and, on the other hand, those who behave ill\r\nwill as certainly be exposed and punished: the general being resolved,\r\nas well for the honor and safety of the country as of the army, to\r\nshow no favor to such as refuse or neglect their duty at so important\r\na crisis.\"\r\n\r\nThe digging still went on; the troops were ordered to keep their arms\r\nin condition for immediate use; the officers cautioned to look after\r\nthe health of their men, as the season was excessively warm and\r\nsickly; and every attention to necessary details enjoined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to their military and naval commands, the two Howes were\r\ninvested by their government with extraordinary powers as civil\r\ncommissioners. They were authorized to issue pardons, and to open up\r\nthe question of reconciliation and a peaceable settlement of the\r\ntroubles; but their first advances in a civil capacity completely\r\nfailed, though not without furnishing an entertaining episode. On the\r\n14th of July they dispatched an officer in a barge with a\r\ncommunication for General Washington. The barge was detained by one of\r\nCommodore Tupper's boats in the harbor until Washington's pleasure in\r\nregard to it could be known. Suspecting, by previous experience at\r\nBoston, that Howe would not recognize his military title, Washington\r\nconsulted a few of his officers in the matter, and it was the\r\nunanimous opinion that should the communication be addressed to him as\r\na private individual it could not, with propriety, be received.\r\nColonel Reed, the adjutant-general, and Colonel Knox immediately went\r\ndown the bay and met the British officer. The latter, with hat in\r\nhand, bowed politely and said to Colonel Reed, \"I have a letter from\r\nLord Howe to Mr. Washington.\" \"Sir,\" replied Reed, \"we have no person\r\nin our army with that address.\" \"But will you look at the address?\"\r\ncontinued the officer, at the same time taking out of his pocket a\r\nletter marked\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQ.,\r\n  NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nHOWE.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Reed, \"I cannot receive that letter.\" \"I am very\r\nsorry,\" returned the officer, \"and so will be Lord Howe, that any\r\nerror in the superscription should prevent the letter being received\r\nby _General Washington_.\" \"Why, sir,\" replied Reed, whose instructions\r\nwere positive not to accept such a communication, \"I must obey\r\norders;\" and the officer, finding it useless to press the matter,\r\ncould only repeat the sentiment, \"Oh! yes, sir, you must obey orders,\r\nto be sure.\" Then, after exchanging letters from prisoners, the\r\nofficers saluted and separated. The British barge had gone but a short\r\ndistance when it quickly put about, and the officer asked by what\r\nparticular title Washington chose to be addressed. Colonel Reed\r\nreplied, \"You are sensible, sir, of the rank of General Washington in\r\nour army.\" \"Yes, sir, we are,\" said the officer; \"I am sure my Lord\r\nHowe will lament exceedingly this affair, as the letter is quite of a\r\ncivil nature, and not of a military one. He laments exceedingly that\r\nhe was not here a little sooner.\" Reed and Knox supposed this to be an\r\nallusion to the Declaration of Independence, but making no reply, they\r\nagain bowed, and parted, as Knox says, \"in the most genteel terms\r\nimaginable.\"[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Colonel Knox to his wife._--_Drake's Life of Gen.\r\nKnox_, p. 131.]\r\n\r\nBut Howe was unwilling to have the matter dropped in this fashion, and\r\non the 20th he sent his adjutant-general, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nPatterson, to hold an interview with Washington in person, if\r\npossible, and urge him to receive the letter and also to treat about\r\nthe exchange of prisoners. Patterson landed at the Battery, and was\r\nconducted to Colonel Knox's quarters at the Kennedy House, without the\r\nusual formality of having his eyes blindfolded. Washington, \"very\r\nhandsomely dressed\"[72] and making \"a most elegant appearance,\"\r\nreceived him with his suite, and listened attentively while Patterson,\r\ninterspersing his words at every other breath with \"May it please your\r\nExcellency,\" explained the address on the letter by saying that the\r\netc. etc. appended meant every thing. \"And, indeed, it might mean any\r\nthing,\" replied Washington, as Patterson then proceeded to say, among\r\nother things, that the benevolence of the king had induced him to\r\nappoint General and Admiral Howe his commissioners to accommodate the\r\nunhappy disputes; that it would give them great pleasure to effect\r\nsuch an accommodation, and that he (Colonel Patterson) wished to have\r\nthat visit considered as preliminary to so desirable an object.\r\nWashington replied that he himself was not vested with any authority\r\nin the case; that it did not appear that Lord Howe could do more than\r\ngrant pardons, and that those who had committed no fault wanted no\r\npardons, as they were simply defending what they deemed their\r\nindisputable rights.[73] Further conversation followed, when\r\nPatterson, rising to leave, asked, \"Has your Excellency no particular\r\ncommands with which you would please to honor me to Lord and General\r\nHowe?\" \"Nothing,\" replied Washington, \"but my particular compliments\r\nto both;\" and, declining to partake of a collation prepared for the\r\noccasion, the British adjutant-general took his departure. Again the\r\nking's \"commissioners\" had failed, and Washington had preserved the\r\ndignity of the young nation and his own self-respect as the commander\r\nof its armies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: \"General Washington was very handsomely dressed, and\r\nmade a most elegant appearance. Colonel Patterson appeared awe-struck,\r\nas if he was before something supernatural. Indeed, I don't wonder at\r\nit. He was before a very great man, indeed.\"--_Ibid._ p. 132.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Memorandum of an interview between General Washington\r\nand Colonel Patterson.--_Sparks' Washington_, vol. iv., p. 510.]\r\n\r\nAn incident, of greater moment as a military affair, and which\r\ndisturbed Washington as much as the Patterson interview must have\r\ndiverted him, was the easy passage, on the 12th of July, of two of the\r\nBritish men-of-war, the Rose and Phoenix, past all the batteries,\r\nunharmed, up the North River. Taking advantage of a brisk breeze and\r\nrunning tide, the ships with their tenders sailed rapidly up from the\r\nNarrows, and to avoid the fire of the batteries as much as possible\r\nkept near the Jersey shore. The American artillerists opened upon them\r\nwith all their guns along the river, but could do them no serious\r\ndamage, while by accident, in their haste to load the pieces, six of\r\ntheir own gunners were killed. The ships sent many shots into the\r\ncity, some crashing through houses but doing no other injury, while\r\nthe roar of the cannon frightened the citizens who had not already\r\nmoved away, and caused more to go.[74] At the upper end of the\r\nisland, around Fort Washington, where the batteries and river\r\nobstructions were as yet incomplete, the ships suffered still less\r\nharm, and sailing by, anchored safely in the broad Tappan Bay above.\r\nTheir object was to cut off the supplies which came down the river to\r\nWashington's army, and, as supposed, to encourage the loyalists in the\r\nupper counties and supply them with arms. Washington acknowledged that\r\nthe event showed the weakness and inadequacy of the North River line\r\nof defences, and reported to Congress that it developed a possible\r\nplan of attack by the British upon his rear. Measures were taken to\r\nannoy if not destroy the ships, and, on the 3d of August, Commodore\r\nTupper, with four of his sloops and schooners, boldly attacked the\r\nenemy, but though, as Washington wrote, \"our officers and men, during\r\nthe whole affair, behaved with great spirit and bravery,\" neither side\r\nsustained serious damage. On the night of the 16th two fire-rafts were\r\ndirected against the ships, which were successful so far as to destroy\r\none of the tenders; and on the 18th the enemy weighed anchor and\r\nreturned to the Narrows as readily as they came up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: On August 17th Washington requested the New York\r\nConvention to remove the women, children, and infirm persons, as the\r\ncity was likely soon to be \"the scene of a bloody conflict.\" He stated\r\nthat when the Rose and Phoenix sailed past, \"the shrieks and cries\r\nof these poor creatures, running every way with their children, was\r\ntruly distressing.\" Pastor Shewkirk says: \"This affair caused a great\r\nfright in the city. Women and children, and some with their bundles,\r\ncame from the lower parts and walked to the Bowery, which was lined\r\nwith people.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was now apparent that the great struggle between the two armies\r\ncould be postponed no longer, and no day after the arrival of the\r\nHessians passed that the British attack was not looked for. The orders\r\nof August 8th cautioned the men to be at their quarters, \"especially\r\nearly in the morning or upon the tide of flood,\" when the enemy's\r\nfleet might be expected, and every preparation was made to resist the\r\nlanding of the British at any point upon Manhattan Island.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Captain Nathan Hale, the \"Martyr-spy,\" says in a letter\r\nof the 20th of August: \"Our situation has been such this fortnight or\r\nmore as scarce to admit of writing. We have daily expected an\r\naction--by which means, if any one was going, and we had letters\r\nwritten, orders were so strict for our tarrying in camp, that we could\r\nrarely get leave to go and deliver them. For about six or eight days\r\nthe enemy have been expected hourly, whenever the wind and tide in the\r\nleast favored.\"--_Document_ 40.]\r\n\r\nUpon Long Island General Greene and his men were still at work on the\r\ndefences, and, since the arrival of the enemy, doubly vigilant. Hand's\r\nriflemen kept close watch at the Narrows and reported every suspicious\r\nmovement of the fleet. Word was brought in on the 9th that a large\r\nnumber of regulars were drawn up at the Staten Island ferry, and\r\nGreene immediately sent around the order for \"no officer or soldier to\r\nstir from his quarters, that we may be ready to march at a moment's\r\nwarning, if necessary.\" Upon another alarm, when probably he himself\r\nwas indisposed, he directed Colonel Little, the senior regimental\r\nofficer present, to superintend the disposition of the troops. His\r\nhastily written letter, penned apparently not long after midnight,\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\n     THURSDAY MORNING [August 8 or 15?]\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR--By Express from Col Hand and from Red Hook, and\r\n     from on board the Sloop at Governor's Island it is very\r\n     evident there was a General Imbarcation of the Troops last\r\n     evening from Statten Island--doubtless they'l make a dessent\r\n     this morning. Youl please to order all the troops fit for\r\n     duty to be at their Alarm posts near an hour sooner than is\r\n     common--let their flints arms and ammunition be examined and\r\n     everything held in readiness to defend the works or go upon\r\n     a detachment. A few minutes past received an Express from\r\n     Head Quarters. Youl acquaint the Commanding officers of Col\r\n     Hitchcock's Regiment and Col Forman's Regiment of this, and\r\n     direct them to observe the same orders, also the Artillery\r\n     officers.\r\n\r\n     I am ys,\r\n       N. GREENE.\r\n\r\n     [Addressed to Col. Little.][76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Original in possession of Chas. J. Little, Esq.,\r\nCambridge, Mass.]\r\n\r\nGreene had been promoted to the rank of major-general on the 9th, and\r\nhis old brigade on Long Island given to Brigadier-General John Nixon,\r\nof Massachusetts, who was promoted from a colonelcy at the same time.\r\nA new arrangement of the army was effected, and Brigadier-General\r\nHeard's brigade of five New Jersey regiments was ordered to Long\r\nIsland to reinforce Greene. His division, now consisting of these two\r\nbrigades--Nixon's and Heard's--numbered, August 15th, two thousand\r\nnine hundred men fit for duty. Parts of two Long Island militia\r\nregiments under Colonels Smith and Remsen which joined him about this\r\ndate, and Colonel Gay's Connecticut levies, who had been on that side\r\nsince the 1st of August, increased this number to something over\r\nthirty-five hundred.\r\n\r\nBut Greene was not to be a participator in the approaching scenes. The\r\nprevailing fever which had prostrated so many officers and men seized\r\nhim with all but a fatal hold, and he was obliged to relinquish his\r\ncommand. He clung to it, however, to the last moment in hopes of a\r\nchange for the better. \"I am very sorry,\" he wrote to Washington on\r\nthe 15th, \"that I am under the necessity of acquainting you that I am\r\nconfined to my bed with a raging fever. The critical situation of\r\naffairs makes me the more anxious, but I hope, through the assistance\r\nof Providence, to be able to ride before the presence of the enemy may\r\nmake it absolutely necessary;\" and he assured the commander-in-chief\r\nthat his men appeared to be \"in exceeding good spirits,\" and would no\r\ndoubt be able to render a very good account of the enemy should they\r\nland on Long Island. On the 16th there was no change for the better in\r\nhis condition, but on the contrary Livingston, his aid, reported that\r\nhe had \"a very bad night of it;\" and in a day or two he was removed to\r\nNew York, to the house of John Inglis now the intersection of Ninth\r\nStreet and Broadway where with rest and care he slowly passed the\r\ncrisis of his illness.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Greene's Life of Greene_, vol. i.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Washington gave orders to General Sullivan, who had\r\nrecently returned from Canada, to take the command upon Long Island,\r\nuntil General Greene's state of health should permit him to resume\r\nit.[78]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _General Orders, August 20, 1776._--... \"General\r\nSullivan is to take command upon Long Island till General Greene's\r\nstate of health will permit him to resume it, and Brigadier Lord\r\nStirling is to take charge of General Sullivan's division till he\r\nreturns to it again.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight here, before entering upon the details of the coming struggle,\r\nwe may delay a moment to glance at the two armies as they lay in their\r\nopposite camps waiting to engage in the serious business before them.\r\nWhat was their composition and organization, what their strength, who\r\ntheir officers and leaders? In the case of the American troops\r\nparticularly may these questions be asked, because to them and their\r\nservices the country has long acknowledged its obligations, and so far\r\nbound itself to perpetuate their memory. Who were the men who stood\r\nwith Washington in this first and critical year of our national\r\nlife--who came to this vicinity to fight on strange ground for a\r\ncommon cause? We are called upon to remember them, not as soldiers\r\nsimply, but as public-spirited citizens arming to secure themselves in\r\ntheir privileges, or perhaps as ancestors who had a thought for the\r\npeace and happiness of present generations.\r\n\r\nThe original army of the Revolution was that ardent though disjointed\r\nbody of provincials which gathered around Boston immediately after the\r\nLexington alarm, and came nominally under the command of General\r\nArtemas Ward, of Massachusetts. As a military corps it entirely lacked\r\ncohesion, as the troops from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and\r\nConnecticut were under independent control, and yielded to General\r\nWard's authority only by patriotic consent. The appointment of\r\nWashington as commander-in-chief of all the American forces relieved\r\nthis difficulty, and the adoption by Congress of the Boston troops as\r\na Continental army, under the orders and in the pay of Congress, gave\r\nthat army more of a military character. But the terms of enlistment\r\nwere short, and it became necessary to reorganize the entire body by\r\nnew enlistments for a year's service from the 1st of January, 1776.\r\nThis force thus recruited was the nucleus of the army which Washington\r\nmustered at New York in the present campaign. It consisted of\r\ntwenty-seven battalions, or \"regiments of foot,\" as they were styled,\r\neach divided into eight companies, and having a maximum strength of\r\nabout six hundred and forty officers and men. With the exception of\r\nthe First Regiment, or Pennsylvania Riflemen, all were from the New\r\nEngland States; and, as already stated, twenty-one of them, after the\r\nevacuation of Boston, marched to New York under the command of\r\nGenerals Heath, Spencer, Sullivan, and Greene.\r\n\r\nThis force, diminished by the regiments sent to Canada, was quite\r\ninadequate for the purposes of the campaign, and on the 1st of June\r\nCongress issued a call for large reinforcements both for the New York\r\narmy and that on the Canada border. For the former thirteen thousand\r\neight hundred troops were voted necessary, and for the latter six\r\nthousand, while in addition it was resolved to establish a \"flying\r\ncamp\" of ten thousand men, who could be sent wherever needed. The\r\nquota Massachusetts was to furnish for New York was two thousand;\r\nConnecticut, five thousand five hundred; New York, three thousand; and\r\nNew Jersey, three thousand three hundred. For the flying camp,\r\nPennsylvania was to recruit six thousand; Delaware, six hundred; and\r\nMaryland, three thousand four hundred. All these men were to be\r\nmilitia or State troops, but to serve under the orders of Congress and\r\nin its pay until at least the 1st of December following.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of these calls was impressed upon the country by urgent\r\nletters from the President and members of Congress and the leaders of\r\nthe day. \"The militia of the United Colonies,\" wrote Hancock, \"are a\r\nbody of troops that may be depended upon. To their virtue, their\r\ndelegates in Congress now make the most solemn appeal. They are called\r\nupon to say whether they will live slaves or die freemen.\" To the\r\ngovernors and State assemblies he added: \"On your exertions at this\r\ncritical period, together with those of the other colonies in the\r\ncommon cause, the salvation of America now evidently depends....\r\nExert, therefore, every nerve to distinguish yourselves. Quicken your\r\npreparations, and stimulate the good people of your government, and\r\nthere is no danger, notwithstanding the mighty armament with which we\r\nare threatened, but you will be able to lead them to victory, to\r\nliberty, and to happiness.\" But the reinforcements came forward\r\nslowly, and it was not until the enemy had actually arrived that the\r\npeculiar dangers of the situation were appreciated and the militiamen\r\nhurried to Washington's assistance at his own pressing call for them.\r\nBy the 27th of August, his army, which on July 13th numbered a little\r\nover ten thousand men fit for duty, had been increased in the\r\naggregate to twenty-eight thousand; but so many were on the sick list\r\nduring this month, that he could muster not quite twenty thousand\r\neffectives, officers and men, at the opening of active operations.\r\n\r\nTo this force the State of New York contributed thirteen regiments. Of\r\nher Continental battalions then in the service, three were in the\r\nNorthern department under Schuyler, part of another in the Highlands,\r\nand two, commanded by Colonels Alexander McDougall and Rudolph\r\nRitzema, here with Washington, both of which were largely recruited\r\nfrom New York City. McDougall, colonel of the first battalion, had\r\nidentified himself early with the liberty party in the city, became a\r\nmember of the Provincial Congress, and by his zealous and energetic\r\nefforts in both his civil and military capacity contributed much\r\ntowards preserving the honor and interests of the colony in the\r\npresent crisis. In August he was promoted to the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general in the Continental army, and rose to the grade of\r\nmajor-general before the close of the war. Nine of the other regiments\r\nfrom this State, chiefly militia, formed two brigades under\r\nBrigadier-Generals John Morin Scott and George Clinton. In Scott's\r\ncommand were two battalions which were credited to and represented the\r\ncity distinctively. The oldest and largest was the \"First Independent\r\nBattalion,\" commanded by Colonel John Lasher, remembered as one of the\r\nsubstantial citizens of the place. A man of property and influence,\r\nwith a taste for military affairs and evidently popular, he had been\r\nelected colonel of the Independent Companies during the colonial\r\nrégime, and now, with most of his officers and men, had taken up the\r\nContinental cause.[79] The battalion was a favorite corps, composed of\r\nyoung men of respectability and wealth, and when on parade was\r\ndoubtless the attraction of the city. Its companies bore separate\r\nnames, and the uniform of each had some distinguishing feature. There\r\nwere the \"Prussian Blues,\" under Captain James Alner; the \"Oswego\r\nRangers,\" under Captain John J. Roosevelt; the \"Rangers,\" under\r\nCaptain James Abeel; the \"Fusileers,\" under Captain Henry G.\r\nLivingston; the \"Hearts of Oak,\" under Captain John Berrian; the\r\n\"Grenadiers,\" under Captain Abraham Van Dyck; the \"Light Infantry,\"\r\nunder Captain William W. Gilbert; the \"Sportsmen,\" under Captain\r\nAbraham A. Van Wyck; the \"German Fusileers,\" under Captain William\r\nLeonard; the \"Light Horse,\" under Captain Abraham P. Lott; and the\r\n\"Artillery,\" under Captain Samuel Tudor. As reorganized in the summer\r\nof 1776, the regiment had for its field officers Colonel John Lasher,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Andrew Stockholm, and Major James Abeel. The Second\r\nNew York City Battalion was originally commanded by Colonel William\r\nHeyer, and among its companies were the \"Brown Buffs,\" \"Rifles,\"\r\n\"Grenadiers,\" \"Hussars,\" and \"Scotsmen,\" the latter of whom were\r\ncommanded by Captain Robert Smith, of New York, who, after doing good\r\nservice at various times during the war, settled in Philadelphia,\r\nwhere for nearly half a century after he filled offices of public and\r\nprivate trust.[80] In 1776, in the reappointment of field officers,\r\nWilliam Malcom, formerly first major, became colonel; Isaac\r\nStoutenburgh, lieutenant-colonel; and James Alner, major.[81] The two\r\nremaining regiments of Scott's brigade were commanded by Colonel\r\nSamuel Drake, of Westchester, and Colonel Cornelius Humphrey, of\r\nDutchess County. Scott himself was a man of the highest public spirit.\r\nA history of the progress of the revolutionary sentiment in the Colony\r\nof New York would be incomplete without a record of his career. An\r\nable lawyer and speaker, he early resisted the pretentions and\r\narbitrary policy of the home government, and when war became\r\ninevitable, he spared no energy to provide for the crisis. In 1775 and\r\n1776 he was one of the most active and useful members of the\r\nProvincial Congress and the Committee of Safety. \"Nothing from the\r\nother side of the water,\" he wrote to a friend in November, 1775, \"but\r\na fearful looking for of wrath. But let us be prepared for the worst.\r\nWho can prize life without liberty? It is a bauble only fit to be\r\nthrown away.\" He served through the present campaign, and then\r\ncontinued in the public service as Secretary of the State of New York\r\nand afterwards member of the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: In a letter to Peter Van Schaack, dated New York,\r\nFebruary 23d, 1776, Fred. Rhinelander says: \"We are going to raise a\r\nnew battalion; Colonel Lasher and Gouverneur Morris are candidates for\r\nthe command. As both the gentlemen have great merit, it is hard to\r\ntell which will succeed.\" The reference here is probably to a plan\r\nformed by private citizens in New York to raise a battalion of fifteen\r\nhundred men for nine months, on condition that the projectors could\r\nappoint the officers. This being refused by the Provincial Congress\r\nthe plan was abandoned.--_Life of G. Morris_, vol. i. p. 89, n.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: See Biographical Sketches, Part II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: The New York Congress voted that the City and County of\r\nNew York should furnish twelve hundred men as their quota of the three\r\nthousand recently called for, and these were to consist of \"the two\r\nindependent battalions.\" They were composed of ten companies each,\r\nwhich, however, never reached their maximum strength. In September\r\nLasher's total was 510; Malcom's, 297.]\r\n\r\nTwo other acquisitions to the army in this campaign were the brothers\r\nJames and George Clinton, of Ulster County, N.Y., both destined to be\r\nprominent characters in the Revolution. James Clinton, as colonel of\r\none of the Continental regiments, superintended the construction of\r\nfortifications in the Highlands, and in August was promoted to the\r\nrank of brigadier-general in the Continental service. George was\r\nmember of Congress, and after voting for the Declaration of\r\nIndependence returned to command a militia brigade which the State\r\ncalled out during the summer, and which joined Washington's army just\r\nbefore the battle of Long Island. These troops were commanded by\r\nColonel Levi Paulding, of Ulster County; Colonels Morris Graham and\r\nJames Swartwout, of Dutchess; Colonel Isaac Nichol, of Orange; and\r\nColonel Thomas Thomas, of Westchester. Before this, in November, 1775,\r\nan attempt was made to raise three regiments of militia in New York\r\nCity to be commanded respectively by Henry Remsen, John Jay, and\r\nAbraham P. Lott; but the enlistment of men into other corps made it\r\nimpossible to organize them.[82] In this campaign, too, we first meet\r\nwith young officers from this State who subsequently rose to\r\ndistinction in the service. Here Alexander Hamilton appears; and we\r\nread that upon the certificate of Captain Stephen Badlam, that he had\r\nexamined Hamilton and found him qualified for a command, the New York\r\nConvention appointed him, March 14th, Captain of the \"Provincial\r\nCompany of Artillery of the Colony.\" Among others were Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHenry B. Livingston, Majors Nicholas Fish and Richard Platt, and Hugh\r\nHughes, teacher of a classical school, who, as assistant\r\nQuartermaster-General, rendered, at least on one occasion, a most\r\nimportant service to the army.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Lewis Morris, one of the Signers of the Declaration, was\r\nappointed brigadier-general of the Westchester County militia, but he\r\nremained in Congress until later in the fall, when he took the field\r\nfor a short time with New York militia in the Highlands.]\r\n\r\nLong Island was represented in the New York quota by two regiments of\r\nmilitia and two small companies of \"troop.\" The Suffolk County\r\nregiment, at the eastern end, was commanded by Colonel Josiah Smith,\r\nof South Haven parish, and that from King's County by Colonel Rutgert\r\nVan Brunt. But the militia, especially in disaffected Kings and Queens\r\ncounties, could be mustered, as volunteers, with difficulty; and early\r\nin August the New York Provincial Congress ordered a draft to be made\r\nfrom these counties, and the troops so raised to be commanded by\r\nColonel Jeronimus Remsen, of Queens, with Nicholas Cowenhoven, of\r\nKings, for lieutenant-colonel, and Richard Thorne, of Queens, for\r\nmajor. Colonel Smith's lieutenant-colonel at this time was John Sands,\r\nand his major, Abraham Remsen. The two regiments--Smith's and\r\nRemsen's--did not report to Greene until August 15th and after, and\r\nmustered together probably less than five hundred men. The troopers,\r\nnot over fifty in all, were a few horsemen from Brooklyn under Captain\r\nAdolph Waldron and Lieutenant William Boerum; and others, representing\r\nKing's County, under Captain Lambert Suydam. About the middle of\r\nAugust, Nathaniel Woodhull, of Mastic, brigadier-general of the Long\r\nIsland militia, and now President of the State Convention, dropping\r\nhis civil functions, repaired to the Island to render whatever aid the\r\nsituation might demand. A man of the purest motives and capable of\r\ndoing good service, an unhappy, although a soldier's fate, awaited\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey at the outbreak of the war met an obstacle to hearty\r\nco-operation with the other colonies in the conduct of William\r\nFranklin, her royal governor. Little sympathy had he with the\r\nrevolutionary movement, and his influence was powerful in keeping men\r\nout of it, until the aroused State legislature ordered his arrest. In\r\nWilliam Livingston, her new governor, New Jersey found a patriot and\r\ncivil leader of the right stamp for the emergency. Part of the year he\r\nacted in a military capacity, and directed the movements of the\r\nmilitia in the vicinity of Amboy and Elizabeth. As the Tory element\r\nwas very considerable here, the State found the same difficulty\r\nexperienced by New York in raising troops for the army; but she\r\nfurnished a good proportion. Her three Continental regiments under\r\nColonels Dayton, Maxwell, and Winds, were in the Canada army during\r\nthe present campaign. In the spring and summer the State sent several\r\ndetachments of militia, under Lieutenant-Colonels Ward and Cadmus and\r\nother officers, to assist in fortifying New York. In answer to the\r\nlast call of Congress, the legislature voted to raise a brigade of\r\nfive battalions, to be known as \"new levies,\" to serve until December\r\n1st, and to each man that would enlist a bounty of three pounds was\r\noffered. The command of the brigade was given to Colonel Nathaniel\r\nHeard, of Woodbridge, now promoted to a State brigadier. The colonels\r\nwere Philip Van Cortland, whose regiment was recruited in Bergen,\r\nEssex, and Burlington counties; David Forman, with four companies from\r\nMiddlesex and four from Monmouth; Ephraim Martin, with four from\r\nMorris and four from Sussex; Philip Johnston, with three from Somerset\r\nand five from Hunterdon; and Silas Newcomb, with men from Salem,\r\nGloucester, Burlington, and Cumberland. In September the command\r\nnumbered seventeen hundred and sixty-two enlisted men, and one hundred\r\nand sixty officers.[83] We shall find these troops figuring in the\r\nmovements on Long Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _List of the Officers and Men from New Jersey who served\r\nin the Revolution._ By Adjutant-General W.S. Stryker.]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was well represented in this campaign. Her troops\r\nparticipated in nearly every engagement, and had the opportunity in\r\nmore than one instance of acquitting themselves with honor. Besides\r\nher large body of \"associators,\" or home guards, many of whom marched\r\ninto New Jersey, the State sent four Continental regiments under\r\nColonels Wayne, St. Clair, Irvine, and De Haas, to Canada, and eight\r\nother battalions, three of them Continental, to the army at New York.\r\nOf these, the oldest was commanded by Colonel Edward Hand, of\r\nLancaster. It was the first of the Continental establishment, where it\r\nwas known as the \"rifle\" corps. Enlisting in 1775, under Colonel\r\nThompson, it joined the army at the siege of Boston, re-enlisted for\r\nthe war under Colonel Hand in 1776, and fought all along the Continent\r\nfrom Massachusetts to South Carolina, not disbanding until the peace\r\nwas signed in 1783. Hand himself, a native of Ireland, and, like many\r\nothers in the service, a physician by profession, had served in the\r\nBritish army, was recognized as a superior officer, and we find him\r\nclosing his career as Washington's adjutant-general and personal\r\nfriend. The two other regiments, raised on the Continental basis, were\r\ncommanded by Colonels Robert Magaw, formerly major of Thompson's\r\nregiment, and John Shee, of Philadelphia. The remaining battalions\r\nwere distinctively State troops, and formed part of the State's quota\r\nfor the Flying Camp. Colonel Samuel Miles, subsequently mayor of\r\nPhiladelphia, commanded what was known as the First Regiment of\r\nRiflemen. Unlike any other corps, it was divided into two battalions,\r\nwhich on their enlistment in March aggregated five hundred men each.\r\nThe lieutenant-colonel of the first was Piper; of the second, John\r\nBrodhead. The majors were Paton and Williams. Another corps was known\r\nas the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry, under Colonel Samuel\r\nJohn Atlee, of Lancaster County, originally five hundred strong, and\r\nrecruited in Chester and the Piquea Valley. Atlee had been a soldier\r\nin his youth in the frontier service, afterwards studied law, and in\r\n1775 was active in drilling companies for the war. Mercer, who knew a\r\ngood soldier when he met him, wrote to Washington that Atlee was\r\nworthy his regard as an officer of \"experience and attention,\" and his\r\nfine conduct on Long Island proved his title to this word of\r\ncommendation from his superior. How much of a man and soldier he had\r\nin his lieutenant-colonel, Caleb Parry, the events of August 27th will\r\nbear witness. The three other battalions were incomplete. Two were\r\ncomposed of Berks County militia, under Lieutenant-Colonels Nicholas\r\nLutz and Peter Kachlein. Lutz's major was Edward Burd, and their\r\ncolonel was Henry Haller, of Reading, who did not join the army until\r\nafter the opening of the campaign. Another detachment consisted of\r\npart of Colonel James Cunningham's Lancaster County militiamen, under\r\nMajor William Hay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [signature: Edw. Hand]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL FIRST REGIMENT OF FOOT (PENN RIFLEMEN). BRIGADIER GENERAL 1777\r\n\r\nSteel Engr. F. von Egloffstein N.Y.]\r\n\r\nDelaware furnished more than her proportion to the flying camp. The\r\n\"Lower Counties,\" as this little State had been known in colonial\r\ntimes, had shown no haste to break with the mother country. Her people\r\nwere chiefly farmers of a peaceable disposition, who used herbs for\r\ntea and felt no weight of oppression. But Delaware had her\r\npublic-spirited men, who, when the crisis came, felt that the\r\n\"counties\" must take their place by the side of the colonies in the\r\npending conflict. Among these were Thomas MacKean and Cæsar Rodney.\r\nRodney's right-hand man in his patriotic efforts was John Haslet, born\r\nin Ireland, once a Presbyterian minister, now a physician in Dover,\r\n\"tall, athletic, of generous and ardent feelings.\" The news of the\r\nadoption of the Declaration of Independence Haslet celebrated with \"a\r\nturtle feast;\" and he did more. Already he had begun to raise a\r\nregiment for the field, and five weeks before the opening battle it\r\nleft Dover eight hundred strong, composed of some of the best blood\r\nand sinew Delaware had to offer.[84]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Delaware's Revolutionary Soldiers._ By William G.\r\nWhiteley, Esq., 1875.]\r\n\r\nMaryland raised as her contingent for this campaign four regiments and\r\nseven independent companies; but of these, Smallwood's battalion\r\nand four of the companies alone had joined the army when hostilities\r\ncommenced. Though forming part of the State's quota for the flying\r\ncamp, this was far from being a hastily-collected force. It stands\r\nupon record that while Massachusetts was preparing for the contest in\r\nthe earlier days, there were men along the Chesapeake and the Potomac\r\nwho took the alarm with their northern brethren. Mordecai Gist, Esq.,\r\nof \"Baltimore town,\" was among the first to snuff the coming storm,\r\nand the first to act, for he tells us that as early as December, 1774,\r\nat the expense of his time and hazard of his business, he organized \"a\r\ncompany composed of men of honor, family, and fortune,\" to be ready\r\nfor any emergency. The Lexington news, four months later, found the\r\nbest part of Maryland ready to arm. In Baltimore, William Buchanan,\r\nlieutenant of the county, collected a body of the older citizens for\r\nhome defence, while their unmarried sons and others organized\r\nthemselves into two more companies, donned \"an excellent scarlet\r\nuniform,\" and chose Gist for their leader. When the State called for\r\ntroops at large many of these young men responded, and in the spring\r\nof 1776 made up three companies, which, with six other companies that\r\ngathered at Annapolis from the surrounding country, formed the first\r\nMaryland battalion of \"State regulars.\" William Smallwood, living on\r\nthe banks of the Potomac, in Charles County, was chosen colonel;\r\nFrancis Ware, lieutenant-colonel; and Mordecai Gist, first major. On\r\nthe day it left for the field, July 10th, it numbered, inclusive of\r\nCaptain Edward Veazey's large independent company from the Eastern\r\nShore, seven hundred and fifty men. The State sent no better material\r\ninto the service. Without cares, patriotic, well drilled, well led,\r\npriding themselves in their soldierly appearance, both officers and\r\nmen were a notable and much needed acquisition to Washington's army.\r\n\r\nMen from Virginia, too, were to take an active part in this campaign,\r\nbut not until after it had opened. The State had nine regiments\r\norganized for service, five of which, under Colonels Weedon, Reed,\r\nScott, Elliott and Buckner, joined the army during the fall. There\r\nwere several Virginia officers on the ground, however, as early as\r\nJuly and August, one of whom was a host in himself. This was General\r\nHugh Mercer, who had been a surgeon in the Pretender's army on the\r\nfield of Culloden; who afterward coming to America figured as a\r\nvolunteer in Braddock's defeat, and then settled down to practice as a\r\nphysician in Fredericksburg. Appointed a Continental Brigadier,\r\nWashington intrusted him with the important command of the New Jersey\r\nfront, where he kept a constant watch along the shore opposite Staten\r\nIsland. He had at various times from three to six thousand troops\r\nunder him, composed of Pennsylvania and New Jersey home guards and\r\nmilitia, but which were never enrolled as a part of Washington's\r\narmy.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Durkee's Continentals garrisoned Powle's Hook, and\r\nBradley's Connecticut regiment was at Bergen, both being returned on\r\nWashington's rolls, but otherwise under Mercer's orders.]\r\n\r\nFrom New England, as we have seen, came the troops sent on from Boston\r\nby Washington, which formed the nucleus or basis of the force gathered\r\nat New York. These were all Continental or established regiments, and\r\nwere reinforced from this section during the summer by militia and\r\nState troops.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts furnished the Continental battalions commanded by\r\nColonels William Prescott, of Pepperell; John Glover, of Marblehead;\r\nMoses Little, of Newburyport; John Nixon, of Framingham; Jonathan\r\nWard, of Southboro; Israel Hutchinson, of Salem; Ebenezer Learned, of\r\nOxford; Loammi Baldwin, of Woburn; John Bailey, of Hanover; Paul\r\nDudley Sargent, of Gloucester, and Joseph Read. In August,\r\nBrigadier-General John Fellows, of Sheffield, brought down three\r\nregiments of militia under Colonels Jonathan Holman, of Worcester\r\nCounty, Jonathan Smith, of Berkshire, and Simeon Cary, with men from\r\nPlymouth and Bristol counties. The State also sent the only artillery\r\nregiment[86] then in the service, under Colonel Henry Knox, of Boston.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: At New York, the artillery was increased by Captain\r\nAlexander Hamilton's company, and soldiers were detached from the\r\nseveral regiments to act as gunners in consequence of Knox's inability\r\nto furnish enough from his own regiment to man all the points.]\r\n\r\nMany of these officers named had already made something of a record\r\nfor themselves. Prescott will be forever associated with Bunker Hill.\r\nWith him there were Nixon, who was severely wounded, Ward, Little,\r\nSargent, and not a few of the officers and men who were here in the\r\npresent campaign. Many of them were representative citizens. Little,\r\nof Newburyport, whose name we have seen associated with the defences\r\nof Long Island, had been surveyor of the king's lands, owned large\r\ntracts in his own right, and was widely known as a man of character\r\nand influence. As an officer he was distinguished for his judgment and\r\ngreat self-possession in the field. His lieutenant-colonel, William\r\nHenshaw, of Leicester, belonged to the line of Henshaws whose ancestor\r\nhad fallen in the English Revolution in defence of popular rights and\r\nprivileges. A man of the old type, with cocked hat and provincial\r\ndress, modest and brave, he writes home to his wife one day that he\r\nfinds it difficult to stop profanity among the troops; another day he\r\nhopes his children are improving in all the graces; and then he is\r\nheard of in the heat of some engagement. He was the first\r\nadjutant-general of the provincial army around Boston in 1775, and\r\nserved in that capacity with the rank of colonel until relieved by\r\nGeneral Gates. The services rendered by Colonel and afterwards General\r\nGlover in this as well as in other campaigns is a well-known record.\r\nLearned and Nixon became Continental brigadiers. Shepherd, Brooks,\r\nJackson, Winthrop Sargent, and many other officers from this State,\r\ndistinguished themselves in the later years of the Revolution. But\r\nperhaps no man proved his worth more in this campaign than Colonel\r\nRufus Putnam, of Brookfield, Washington's chief engineer. He succeeded\r\nColonel Gridley at Boston; and at New York, where engineering skill of\r\na high order was demanded in the planning and construction of the\r\nworks, he showed himself equal to the occasion. That Washington put a\r\nhigh estimate on his services, appears from more than one of his\r\nletters.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Document 43, Part II., contains interesting and\r\nimportant extracts from Colonel Putnam's Journal, now published for\r\nthe first time.]\r\n\r\nRhode Island at this time had two regiments in the field. In 1775 they\r\nwere around Boston; in 1776 they were here again with the\r\narmy--Varnum's Ninth and Hitchcock's Eleventh Continentals. A third\r\nregiment from this State, under Colonel Lippett, did not join the army\r\nuntil September. Varnum and Hitchcock were rising young lawyers of\r\nProvidence, the former a graduate of Brown University, the latter of\r\nYale. Hitchcock's lieutenant-colonel was Ezekiel Cornell, of Scituate,\r\nwho subsequently served in Congress and became commissary-general of\r\nthe army. Greene, Varnum, Hitchcock, and Cornell were among those\r\nRhode Islanders who early resisted the pretensions of the British\r\nMinistry. In the discipline and soldierly bearing of these two\r\nregiments Greene took special pride, and not a few of their officers\r\nsubsequently earned an honorable reputation. Varnum was created a\r\nbrigadier; Hitchcock, as will be seen, closed his career as a\r\nsacrifice to the cause; Colonels Crary and Angell and the Olneys\r\nserved with the highest credit; and the men of the regiments, many of\r\nthem, fought through the war to the Yorktown surrender.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to her population, no State contributed more men to the\r\narmy in 1776 than Connecticut, nor were all ranks of society more\r\nfully represented. Fortunately the State had in Trumbull, its\r\ngovernor, just the executive officer which the times demanded. A man\r\nof character and ability, greatly respected, prompt, zealous, ardent\r\nin the cause, his words and calls upon the people were seldom\r\nunheeded; and the people were generally as patriotic as their\r\ngovernor. In the present crisis Connecticut sent to New York six\r\nContinental battalions, seven of \"new levies,\" and twelve of militia.\r\nHer Continentals were commanded by Colonels Samuel Holden Parsons,[88]\r\nof Lyme; Jedediah Huntington, of Lebanon; Samuel Wyllys, of Hartford;\r\nCharles Webb, of Stamford; John Durkee, of Bean Hill, near Norwich;\r\nand Andrew Ward,[89] of Guilford. The \"levies\" were the troops raised\r\nin answer to the last call of Congress, and were commanded by Colonels\r\nGold Selleck Silliman, of Fairfield; Phillip Burr Bradley, of\r\nRidgefield; William Douglas, of Northford; Fisher Gay, of Farmington;\r\nSamuel Selden, of Hadlyme; John Chester, of Wethersfield; and Comfort\r\nSage, of Middletown. Among these names will be recognized many which\r\nrepresented some of the oldest and best families in the State. Wyllys\r\nwas a descendant of one of the founders of Hartford. His father held\r\nthe office of Secretary of State for sixty-one years; his grandfather\r\nhad held it before that, and after the Revolution the honor fell to\r\nthe colonel himself. The three held the office in succession for\r\nninety-eight years. Three members of this family, which is now\r\nextinct, were in the army during this campaign, and two served with\r\nhonor through the war. From Lebanon came Colonel Jedediah Huntington\r\nand his two brothers, Captains Joshua and Ebenezer. They were sons of\r\nJabez Huntington, who like Trumbull was a type of the patriotic\r\ncitizen of the Revolution. Although his business and property, as a\r\nWest India merchant, would be greatly endangered if not ruined by the\r\nwar, he and his family cheerfully ignored their personal interests in\r\ntheir devotion to the common cause. The three brothers and their\r\nbrother-in-law, Colonel John Chester, served through the present\r\ncampaign as they had in the previous one, and two of them, Jedediah\r\nand Ebenezer, fought to the end of the struggle. Parsons, who\r\nsubsequently rose to the rank of a Continental major-general, Wyllys\r\nand Webb, were among those who pledged their individual credit to\r\ncarry out the successful enterprise against Ticonderoga in 1775. In\r\nhis section of the State few men were more influential than Colonel\r\nSilliman, of Fairfield, where, before the war, he had held the office\r\nof king's attorney. After the present campaign, in the course of which\r\nhe was more than once engaged with the enemy, he was appointed a State\r\nbrigadier, rendered further service during the British forays into\r\nConnecticut, and marched with troops to the Hudson Highlands upon\r\nBurgoyne's approach from Canada. Colonel Douglas, of Northford,\r\nengaged heart and hand in the struggle. Joining Montgomery's command\r\nin 1775, he served in the flotilla on Lake Champlain, and was\r\nsubsequently appointed commodore by Congress; but accepting a\r\ncolonelcy of Connecticut levies he marched to New York in 1776, after\r\nfirst advancing the funds to equip his regiment. With Silliman he\r\nenjoyed the confidence and good opinion of the commander-in-chief, and\r\nboth were appointed to command regiments to be raised for the\r\nConnecticut Continental Line. Another of those citizen-soldiers who\r\ncame from the substantial element in the population was Colonel\r\nSelden. A descendant of the Seldens who were among the first settlers\r\nin the Connecticut Valley, fifty years of age, possessing a large\r\nestate, incapacitated for severe military duty, the father of twelve\r\nchildren, he nevertheless answered the governor's call for troops, and\r\njoined the army at New York, from which he was destined not to return.\r\nDurkee, Knowlton, Hull, Sherman, Grosvenor, Bradley, afterwards a\r\nContinental colonel, and many others, were men from Connecticut, who\r\ngave the country their best services. The militia regiments from this\r\nState turned out at the governor's call upon the arrival of the enemy.\r\nOf the fourteen he designated to march, twelve reported at New York\r\nbefore August 27th, each averaging three hundred and fifty men, with\r\nOliver Wolcott as their brigadier-general,[90] than whom no man in\r\nConnecticut had done more to further the public interests of both the\r\nState and the nation. Signing the Declaration in 1776, he was to be\r\nfound in the following year fighting Burgoyne in the field, and\r\nafterwards constantly active in a military or civil capacity until the\r\nsuccess of the cause was assured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: On his promotion to a brigadier-generalship in August,\r\nParsons was succeeded by his lieutenant-colonel, John Tyler.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: This was the same officer who came down with Lee in the\r\nspring. When his regiment returned home he was put in command of\r\nanother raised on the continental basis. He joined the army in August,\r\nbut did not cross to Long Island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The original letter from Trumbull to Wolcott, among the\r\nlatter's papers, informing him of his appointment, states that the\r\nfourteen regiments had been called out upon \"the most pressing\r\napplication of General Washington.\" The governor adds: \"Having formed\r\nraised expectations of your disposition and ability to serve your\r\ncountry in this most important crisis, on which the fate of America\r\nseems so much to depend, I trust you will cheerfully undertake the\r\nservice,\" etc. General Wolcott proceeded at once to New York, and was\r\nwith the militia in the city during the fighting on Long Island, and\r\nfor some time after. As to the number of the regiments that came down,\r\nsee Colonel Douglas' letter of August 23d (Document 22), where he says\r\ntwelve were on the parade the day before.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPass these men in review, and we have before us not a small proportion\r\nof those \"fathers\" of the Revolution, to whose exertions and\r\nsacrifices America owes her independence. It was a crude, unmilitary\r\nhost, strong only as a body of volunteers determined to resist an\r\ninvasion of their soil. Here and there was an officer or soldier who\r\nhad served in previous wars, but the great mass knew nothing of war.\r\nThe Continental or established regiments formed much less than half\r\nthe army, and some of these were without experience or discipline;\r\nvery few had been tested under fire. As to arms, they carried all\r\nsorts--old flint-locks, fowling-pieces, rifles, and occasionally good\r\nEnglish muskets captured by privateers from the enemy's transports.\r\nNot all had bayonets or equipments. Uniforms were the exception; even\r\nmany of the Continentals were dressed in citizens' clothes.[91] The\r\nmilitiamen, hurriedly leaving their farms and affairs, came down in\r\nhomespun, while some of the State troops raised earlier in the spring\r\nappeared in marked contrast to them, both in dress and discipline.\r\nSmallwood's Marylanders attracted attention with their showy scarlet\r\nand buff coats. The Delawares, with their blue uniform, were so nearly\r\nlike the Hessians as to be mistaken for them in the field. Miles'\r\nPennsylvanians wore black hunting shirts; and Lasher's New York\r\nbattalion perhaps appeared, in the various uniforms of gray, blue and\r\ngreen worn by the independent companies. The general and regimental\r\nofficers in the army were distinguished by different-colored cockades\r\nand sashes. For regimental colors, each battalion appears to have\r\ncarried those of its own design. One of the flags captured by the\r\nHessians on Long Island was reported by a Hessian officer to have been\r\na red damask standard, bearing the word \"Liberty\" in its centre.\r\nColonel Joseph Read's Massachusetts Continentals carried a flag with a\r\nlight buff ground, on which there was the device of a pine-tree and\r\nIndian-corn, emblematical of New-England fields. Two officers were\r\nrepresented in the uniform of the regiment, one of whom, with blood\r\nstreaming from a wound in his breast, pointed to children under the\r\npine, with the words, \"For posterity I bleed.\"[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: When it was proposed to put the Boston army on the new\r\nContinental basis on January 1st, 1776, Washington evidently hoped to\r\nhave it all uniformed. Thus his orders of December 11th, 1775, read:\r\n\"As uniformity and decency in dress are essentially necessary in the\r\nappearance and regularity of an army, his Excellency recommends it\r\nearnestly to the officers to put themselves in a proper uniform....\r\nThe general by no means recommends or desires officers to run into\r\ncostly or expensive regimentals; no matter how plain or coarse, so\r\nthat they are but uniform in their color, cut, and fashion. The\r\nofficers belonging to those regiments whose uniforms are not yet fixed\r\nupon had better delay making their regimentals until they are.\" The\r\norders of January 5th, 1776, say: \"The regimentals, which have been\r\nmade up, and drawn for, may be delivered to the respective Colonels,\r\nby the Quartermaster-General, to the order of those Colonels, who drew\r\nthem at such prices as they have cost the continent, which is much\r\ncheaper than could otherwise be obtained. As nothing adds more to the\r\nappearance of a man than dress, and a proper degree of cleanliness in\r\nhis person, the General hopes and expects that each regiment will\r\ncontend for the most soldierlike appearance.\" These \"regimentals\" were\r\nof a brown color. That Little's and Hitchcock's men, or most of them,\r\nwere in uniform when they came to New York, appears from General\r\nGreene's Providence order of April 4th (_ante_, p. 62). A description\r\nof the colors of Colonel Joseph Read's Massachusetts Continental\r\nregiment refers to the \"uniform of the regiment;\" so doubtless most of\r\nthe Boston army was in uniform. But whether they were kept supplied\r\nwith uniforms may be doubted. The men wore out their clothes fast\r\nwhile throwing up the works, and Washington speaks of the \"difficulty\r\nand expense\" of providing new ones. (Orders, July 24th, 1776.) At this\r\ndate he does not insist on uniforms, but recommends the adoption of\r\nthe hunting shirt and breeches as a cheap and convenient dress, and as\r\none which might have its terrors for the enemy, who imagined that\r\nevery rebel so dressed was \"a complete marksman.\" A valuable article\r\non \"The Uniforms of the American Army\" may be found in the _Magazine\r\nof American History_, for August, 1877, by Professor Asa Bird Gardner,\r\nof the West Point Military Academy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Force_, 5th Series, vol. ii., p. 244.]\r\n\r\nHad this force acquired the discipline and been hardened by the\r\nservice which made Washington's troops later in the war a most trusty\r\nand effective body, the campaign of 1776 would have shown another\r\nrecord. But not the less are we to respect it, with all its failings\r\nand defeats. If not all the men were \"patriots;\" if some lost faith in\r\nthe cause; if others deserted it entirely and joined the enemy; if\r\nsome entered the army from mercenary motives and proved cravens in the\r\nfield; if still others who were honest enough in their intentions were\r\nfound to be wretched material for the making of good soldiers--this\r\nwas only the common experience of all popular struggles. As a body, it\r\nfairly represented the colonists in arms; and as an army, it did its\r\nshare in bringing about the final grand result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: Washington's army, at the opening of the campaign on\r\nAugust 27th, consisted of seventy-one regiments or parts of regiments,\r\ntwenty-five of which were Continental, aggregating in round numbers\r\ntwenty-eight thousand five hundred officers and men. Of these,\r\nMassachusetts furnished seven thousand three hundred; Rhode Island,\r\neight hundred; Connecticut, nine thousand seven hundred; New York,\r\nfour thousand five hundred; New Jersey, one thousand five hundred;\r\nPennsylvania, three thousand one hundred; Delaware, eight hundred; and\r\nMaryland, nine hundred. Between eight and nine thousand were on the\r\nsick-list or not available for duty, leaving on the rolls not far from\r\nnineteen thousand effectives, most of them levies and militia, on the\r\nday of the battle of Long Island.[93] As officered and brigaded at\r\nthis date the army stood as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The last official return of the army before the battle,\r\npublished in _Force's Archives_, bears date of August 3d; the next\r\nabout September 12th. The latter is the proper basis for making an\r\nestimate of the numbers for August 27th, as it includes all the\r\nregiments except Haslet's known to be then present, and no more. On\r\nSeptember 12th the total of rank and file on the rolls, not including\r\nthe absent sick, was 24,100. To these add 1800 commissioned officers\r\nand 2500 sergeants, drums and fifes, and the total strength is 28,400.\r\nOn the same date, rank and file, _fit for duty_, numbered 14,700. Add\r\nto these 1000 lost on Long Island and 3500 officers, sergeants, drums\r\nand fifes fit for duty, and we have, all told, between 19,000 and\r\n20,000 effectives on August 27th; and these figures correspond with\r\nWashington's statement of September 2d: \"Our number of men at present\r\nfit for duty is under 20,000.\" The army suffered greatly from sickness\r\nduring August and September. General Heath writes in his _Memoirs_,\r\nunder date of August 8th: \"The number of sick amounted to near 10,000;\r\nnor was it possible to find proper hospitals or proper necessaries for\r\nthem. In almost every farm, stable, shed, and even under the fences\r\nand bushes, were the sick to be seen, whose countenances were but an\r\nindex of the dejection of spirit and the distress they endured.\" On\r\nthe 4th of August, Colonel Parsons wrote to Colonel Little: \"My Doctor\r\nand Mate are sick. I have near Two Hundred men sick in Camp; my\r\nneighbours are in very little better state.\" And he asks Little to\r\nconsent to his surgeon's mate remaining with him until his own\r\nsurgeons were better.

These brigades, forming Putnam's, Spencer's, and\r\nSullivan's divisions, with the Connecticut militia, were retained\r\nwithin the city and its immediate vicinity. Of Heath's division,\r\nMifflin's brigade was posted at Fort Washington, at the upper end of\r\nthe island, and George Clinton's at King's Bridge. Greene's\r\ndivision--Nixon's and Heard's brigades--with the exception of\r\nPrescott's regiment and Nixon's, now under his brother,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Thomas Nixon, which were on Governor's Island,\r\noccupied the Long Island front.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: See Appendix to Drake's _Life of General Knox_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA far more perfect and formidable army was that which lay encamped on\r\nStaten Island, seven miles down the bay. It was the best officered,\r\ndisciplined, and equipped that Great Britain could then have mustered\r\nfor any service. The fact that she found it difficult to raise new\r\ntroops to conquer America only made it necessary to send forward all\r\nher available old soldiers. The greater part of Howe's army,\r\naccordingly, consisted of experienced regulars. He had with him\r\ntwenty-seven regiments of the line, four battalions of light infantry\r\nand four of grenadiers, two battalions of the king's guards, three\r\nbrigades of artillery, and a regiment of light dragoons, numbering in\r\nthe aggregate about twenty-three thousand officers and men. The six\r\nthousand or more that came from Halifax were the Boston \"veterans.\"\r\nThese had been joined by regiments from the West Indies; and among the\r\nreinforcements from Britain were troops that had garrisoned Gibraltar\r\nand posts in Ireland and England, with men from Scotland who had won a\r\nname in the Seven Years' War.[100] Howe's generals were men who showed\r\ntheir fitness to command by their subsequent conduct during the war.\r\nNext to the commander-in-chief ranked Lieutenant-Generals Clinton,\r\nPercy, and Cornwallis; Major-Generals Mathews, Robertson, Pigot,\r\nGrant, Jones, Vaughan, and Agnew; and Brigadier-Generals Leslie,\r\nCleveland, Smith, and Erskine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: The \"Highlander\" regiments were the Forty-second and\r\nSeventy-first. In _Stewart's Highlanders_, vol. i., p. 354, as quoted\r\nin the _Memoir of General Graham_, the following passage appears: \"On\r\nthe 10th April, 1776, the Forty-second Regiment being reviewed by Sir\r\nAdolphus Oughton, was reported complete, and so unexceptionable that\r\nnone were rejected. Hostilities having commenced in America, every\r\nexertion was made to teach the recruits the use of the firelock, for\r\nwhich purpose they were drilled even by candle-light. New arms and\r\naccoutrements were supplied to the men; and the colonel of the\r\nregiment, at his own expense, supplied _broadswords and pistols_....\r\nThe pistols were of the old Highland fashion, with iron stocks. These\r\nbeing considered unnecessary except in the field, were not intended,\r\nlike the swords, to be worn by the men in quarters. When the regiment\r\ntook the field on Staten and Long Island, it was said that the\r\nbroadswords retarded the men by getting entangled in the brushwood and\r\nthey were therefore taken from them and sent on board the\r\ntransports.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Hessians or \"foreigners\" formed more than one fourth of the\r\nenemy's strength. They numbered eight thousand officers and men,\r\nwhich, added to the distinctively British force, raised Howe's total\r\nto over thirty-one thousand. His total of effectives on the 27th of\r\nAugust was something more than twenty-four thousand.[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: General Clinton, quoting from Howe's returns on this\r\ndate, says he had \"24,464 effectives fit for duty; a total of 26,980,\r\nofficers not included, who, when added, amount to 31,625 men.\" See\r\nGeneral Carrington's _Battles of the Revolution_, p. 199. To the\r\nBritish force should be added two or three companies of New York\r\nloyalists.]\r\n\r\nDrawn up in complete array upon the field this army would have\r\nconfronted Washington's in the following order:[102]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: The list that follows is copied from what appears to\r\nhave been the roster-book of Adjutant Gilfillan of the Fifty-fifth\r\nRegiment. The book was captured by Captain Nathaniel Fitz Randolph, of\r\nNew Jersey (see _Document_ 56), and is now in the possession of\r\nCaptain John C. Kinney, of Hartford, a great-grandson of the latter.\r\nThere is no date attached to the \"Order of Battle,\" but from the few\r\ndates that follow it was probably made out in the first part of\r\nAugust, 1776.

Or rather, the\r\nquestion was narrowed down to this: When and where will the British\r\nattack? With Washington there was no choice left but to maintain a\r\nstrictly defensive attitude. The command which the enemy had of the\r\nwaters was alone sufficient to make their encampment on Staten Island\r\nperfectly secure. As to assuming the offensive, Washington wrote to\r\nhis brother, John Augustine, on July 22d: \"Our situation at present,\r\nboth in regard to men and other matters, is such as not to make it\r\nadvisable to attempt any thing against them, surrounded as they are by\r\nwater and covered with ships, lest a miscarriage should be productive\r\nof unhappy and fatal consequences. It is provoking, nevertheless, to\r\nhave them so near, without being able to give them any disturbance.\"\r\nEarlier in the season an expedition had been organized under Mercer,\r\nin which Knowlton was to take an active part, to attack the enemy's\r\noutposts on Staten Island from the Jersey shore, but the weather twice\r\ninterfered with the plan. All that the Americans hoped to do was to\r\nhold their own at and around New York. Washington tells us that he\r\nfully expected to be able to defend the city.[105] Even the passage of\r\nthe Rose and Phoenix did not shake his faith. None of his letters\r\nwritten during the summer disclose any such misgivings as Lee\r\nexpressed, respecting the possibility of maintaining this base, and in\r\nattempting to hold it he followed out his own best military judgment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: \"Till of late I had no doubt in my own mind of\r\ndefending this place.\"--_Washington to Congress_, September 2d, 1776.]\r\n\r\nWhat occasioned the principal anxiety in the mind of the\r\ncommander-in-chief was the number of points at which the British could\r\nmake an attack and their distance from one another. They could advance\r\ninto New Jersey from Staten Island; they could make a direct attack\r\nupon the city with their fleet, while the transports sailed up the\r\nHudson and the troops effected a landing in his rear; they could cross\r\nto Long Island and fall upon Greene in force; or they could make\r\nlandings at different points as feints, and then concentrate more\r\nrapidly than Washington, as their water carriage would enable them to\r\ndo, and strike where he was weakest.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: \"Before the landing of the enemy in Long Island, the\r\npoint of attack could not be known, nor any satisfactory judgment\r\nformed of their intentions. It might be on Long Island, on Bergen, or\r\ndirectly on the city.\"--_Washington to Congress_, September 9th,\r\n1776.]\r\n\r\nThe summer and the campaign season were passing, and still the\r\nuncertainty was protracted--when and where will the enemy attack?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length, upon the twenty-second of August, after days of expectation\r\nand suspense in the American camp, the British moved forward.\r\nThoroughly informed of Washington's position, the strength of his\r\narmy, and the condition of his lines at every point,[107] Lord Howe\r\nmatured his plan of action deliberately, and decided to advance by way\r\nof Long Island. An attack from this quarter promised the speediest\r\nsuccess and at the least cost, for, should he be able to force the\r\ndefences of Brooklyn, New York would be at his mercy; or, failing in\r\nthis, he could threaten Washington's flank from Hell Gate or beyond,\r\nwhere part of the fleet had been sent through the Sound, and by a push\r\ninto Westchester County compel the evacuation of the city.\r\nPreparations were accordingly made to transport the troops from Staten\r\nIsland across to the Long Island coast and debark them at Gravesend\r\nBay, a mile to the eastward of the Narrows. A thunder-storm of great\r\nviolence on the previous evening, which had fallen with fatal effect\r\non more than one of Washington's soldiers, threatened to delay the\r\nmovement, but a still atmosphere followed, and the morning of the 22d\r\nbroke favorably.[108] At dawn the three frigates Phoenix, Greyhound\r\nand Rose, with the bomb-ketches Thunder and Carcass, took their\r\nstations close into the Bay as covering ships for the landing, while\r\nSir George Collier placed the Rainbow within the Narrows, opposite De\r\nNyse's Ferry, now Fort Hamilton, to silence a battery supposed to be\r\nat that point. Upon the Staten Island shore fifteen thousand British\r\nand Hessian troops, fully equipped, and forty pieces of artillery had\r\nbeen drawn up during the day and evening before, and a part of them\r\nembarked upon transports lying near at anchor. At the beach were\r\nmoored seventy-five flat-boats, eleven batteaux, and two galleys,\r\nbuilt expressly for the present service, and manned by sailors from\r\nthe ships of war, which, with the rest of the naval armament, were\r\nplaced under the direction of Commodore Hotham.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: The Tories gave Howe all the information he needed. One\r\nGilbert Forbes testified at the \"Hickey Plot\" examination that a\r\nSergeant Graham, formerly of the Royal Artillery, had told him that he\r\n(the sergeant), at the request of Governor Tryon, had surveyed the\r\nworks around the city and on Long Island, and had concerted a plan of\r\nattack, which he gave to the governor (_Force_, 4th Series, vol. vi.,\r\np. 1178). On his arrival at Staten Island, Howe wrote to Germaine,\r\nJuly 7th: \"I met with Governor Tryon, on board of ship at the Hook,\r\nand many gentlemen, fast friends to government, attending him, from\r\nwhom I have had the fullest information of the state of the rebels,\r\nwho are numerous, and very advantageously posted, with strong\r\nintrenchments, both upon Long Island and that of New York, with more\r\nthan one hundred pieces of cannon for the defence of the town towards\r\nthe sea,\" etc.--_Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: This storm, which is mentioned by Colonel Douglas,\r\nCaptain Hale, Chaplain Benedict, and others, hung over the city from\r\nseven to ten in the evening, and is described by Pastor Shewkirk as\r\nbeing more terrible than that which \"struck into Trinity Church\"\r\ntwenty years before. Captain Van Wyck and two lieutenants of\r\nMcDougall's regiment and a Connecticut soldier were killed by the\r\nlightning.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the covering frigates were in position, the brigade of\r\nlight infantry and the reserves of grenadiers and foot, forming an\r\nadvance corps four thousand strong and headed by Sir Henry Clinton and\r\nLord Cornwallis, entered the flotilla and were rowed in ten divisions\r\nto the Gravesend landing, where they formed upon the plain without\r\nopposition.[109] Then followed the remaining troops from the\r\ntransports, and before noon the fifteen thousand, with guns and\r\nbaggage, had been safely transferred to Long Island. All who witnessed\r\nthis naval spectacle that morning were the enemy themselves, a few\r\nDutch farmers in the vicinity, and the pickets of Hand's riflemen, who\r\nat once reported the movement at camp.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The landing-place was at the present village of Bath.\r\nNo opposition by the Americans would have availed and none was\r\nattempted. Washington wrote to Hancock, August 20th: \"Nor will it be\r\npossible to prevent their landing on the island, as its great extent\r\naffords a variety of places favorable for that purpose, and the whole\r\nof our works on it are at the end opposite to the city. However, we\r\nshall attempt to harass them as much as possible, which will be all\r\nthat we can do.\" To the same effect Colonel Reed's letter of August\r\n23d: \"As there were so many landing-places, and the people of the\r\nisland generally so treacherous, we never expected to prevent the\r\nlanding.\" General Parsons says (_Document_ 5): \"The landing of the\r\ntroops could not be prevented at the distance of six or seven miles\r\nfrom our lines, in a plain under the cannon of the ships, just within\r\nthe shore.\" An American battery had gone down to De Nyse's, earlier in\r\nthe summer, to annoy the Asia, but there was none there at this date.\r\nThe particulars of the debarkation and of subsequent movements of the\r\nenemy appear in the reports and letters of the two Howes and Sir\r\nGeorge Collier. (_Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., pp. 1255-6; and _Naval\r\nChronicle_, 1841.)]\r\n\r\nThe landing successfully effected, Cornwallis was immediately detached\r\nwith the reserves, Donop's corps of chasseurs and grenadiers, and six\r\nfield-pieces, to occupy the village of Flatbush, but with orders not\r\nto attempt the \"pass\" beyond, if he found it held by the rebels; and\r\nthe main force encamped nearer the coast, from the Narrows to\r\nFlatlands. As Cornwallis advanced, Colonel Hand and his two hundred\r\nriflemen hurried down from their outpost camp above Utrecht, and,\r\nkeeping close to the enemy's front, marched part of the way \"alongside\r\nof them, in the edge of the woods,\" but avoided an open fight in the\r\nfield with superior numbers.[110] Captain Hamilton and twenty men of\r\nthe battalion fell back on the road in advance, burning grain and\r\nstacks of hay, and killing cattle, which, says Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nChambers, he did \"very cleverly.\" Among the inhabitants along the\r\ncoast, confusion, excitement, and distress prevailed,[111] and many\r\nmoved off their goods in great haste to find refuge in the American\r\nlines or farther east on the island; while others remained to welcome\r\nthe enemy, for whose success they had been secretly praying from the\r\noutset.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: \"On the morning of the 22d of August there were nine\r\nthousand British troops on New Utrecht plains. The guard alarmed our\r\nsmall camp, and we assembled at the flagstaff. We marched our forces,\r\nabout two hundred in number, to New Utrecht, to watch the movements of\r\nthe enemy. When we came on the hill we discovered a party of them\r\nadvancing toward us. We prepared to give them a warm reception, when\r\nan imprudent fellow fired, and they immediately halted and turned\r\ntoward Flatbush. The main body also moved along the great road toward\r\nthe same place.\"--Lieutenant-Colonel Chambers, of Hand's riflemen, to\r\nhis Wife, September 3d, 1776. _Chambersburg in the Colony and the\r\nRevolution._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: _Strong's History of Flatbush._]\r\n\r\nThe section of Long Island which the enemy now occupied was a broad\r\nlow plain, stretching northward from the coast from four to six miles,\r\nand eastward a still further distance. Scattered over its level\r\nsurface were four villages, surrounded with farms. Nearest to the\r\nNarrows, and nearly a mile from the coast, stood New Utrecht; another\r\nmile south-east of this was Gravesend; north-east from Gravesend,\r\nnearly three miles, the road led through Flatlands, and directly north\r\nfrom Flatlands, and about half-way to Brooklyn Church, lay Flatbush.\r\nBetween this plain and the Brooklyn lines ran a ridge of hills, which\r\nextended from New York Bay midway through the island to its eastern\r\nextremity. The ridge varied in height from one hundred to one hundred\r\nand fifty feet above the sea, and from the plain it rose somewhat\r\nabruptly from forty to eighty feet, but fell off more gradually in its\r\ndescent on the other side. Its entire surface was covered with a dense\r\ngrowth of woods and thickets, and to an enemy advancing from below it\r\npresented a continuous barrier, a huge natural abattis, impassable to\r\nartillery, where with proportionate numbers a successful defence could\r\nbe sustained.\r\n\r\nThe roads across the ridge passed through its natural depressions, of\r\nwhich there were four within a distance of six miles from the harbor.\r\nThe main highway, or Jamaica Road--that which led up from Brooklyn\r\nFerry--after passing through Bedford, kept on still north of the\r\nhills, and crossed them at the \"Jamaica Pass,\" about four miles from\r\nthe fortified line. From this branched three roads leading to the\r\nvillages in the plain. The most direct was that to Flatbush, which cut\r\nthrough the ridge a mile and a half from the works. Three quarters of\r\na mile to the left, towards the Jamaica Pass, a road from Bedford led\r\nalso to Flatbush; and near the coast ran the Gowanus Road to the\r\nNarrows. Where the Red Lion Tavern stood on this road, about three\r\nmiles from Brooklyn Church, a narrow lane, known as the Martense Lane,\r\nnow marking the southern boundary of Greenwood Cemetery, diverged to\r\nthe left through a hollow in the ridge and connected with roads on the\r\nplain. To clearly understand succeeding movements on Long Island, it\r\nis necessary to have in mind the relative situation of these several\r\nroutes and passes.\r\n\r\nWhen word of the enemy's landing reached Sullivan and Washington the\r\ntroops were immediately put under arms. The commander-in-chief had\r\nalready been prepared for the intelligence by a dispatch from Governor\r\nLivingston, of New Jersey, the night before, to the effect that he had\r\ncertain information from the British camp that they were then\r\nembarking troops and would move to the attack on the following\r\nday.[112] As the report came in that the enemy intended to march at\r\nonce upon Sullivan, Washington promptly sent him a reinforcement of\r\nsix regiments, which included Miles' and Atlee's from Stirling's\r\nbrigade, Chester's and Silliman's from Wadsworth's, and probably\r\nLasher's and Drake's from Scott's, numbering together some eighteen\r\nhundred men. They crossed with light spirits, and were marched to\r\nalarm-posts. Miles' two battalions went on to the Bedford Pass;\r\nSilliman was ordered down into \"a woody hill near Red Hook, to prevent\r\nany more troops from landing thereabout.\"[113] Hand's riflemen,\r\nsupported by one of the Eastern regiments, watched and annoyed the\r\nHessians under Donop at Flatbush, and detachments were sent to guard\r\nthe lower roads near the Red Lion.[114] Within the Brooklyn lines the\r\ntroops stood to their alarm-posts. Colonel Little, expecting that\r\n\"morning would bring us to battle,\" and remembering his promise to\r\ndefend Fort Greene to the last extremity, enclosed his will to his\r\nson, and directed him in a certain event to take proper charge at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Livingston sent a spy to Staten Island on the night of\r\nthe 20th, who brought word that the British were embarking, and would\r\nattack on Long Island and up the North River. Washington received the\r\ninformation during the storm on the following evening, and immediately\r\nsent word to Heath at King's Bridge that the enemy were upon \"the\r\npoint of striking the long-expected stroke.\" The next morning, the\r\n22d, he wrote again instructing Heath to pick out \"eight hundred or a\r\nthousand, light, active men, and good marksmen,\" ready to move rapidly\r\nwherever they were most needed; and he promised to send him some\r\nartillery, \"if,\" he continues, \"we have not other employment upon\r\nhand, which General Putnam, who is this instant come in, seems to\r\nthink we assuredly shall, this day, as there is a considerable\r\nembarkation on board of the enemy's boats.\" (_Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll._,\r\nvolume for 1878. The Heath correspondence.) On the same date\r\nWashington wrote to Hancock: \"The falling down of several ships\r\nyesterday evening to the Narrows, crowded with men, those succeeded by\r\nmany more this morning, and a great number of boats parading around\r\nthem, as I was just now informed, with troops, are all circumstances\r\nindicating an attack, and it is not improbable it will be made to-day.\r\nIt could not have happened last night, by reason of a most violent\r\ngust.\" (_Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p. 1110). On the 21st, Colonel\r\nHand at the Narrows reported three times to General Nixon that the\r\nBritish transports were filling with men and moving down, and the\r\nreports were sent to Washington. These facts show how closely the\r\nenemy were watched. The embarkation was known at headquarters early on\r\nthe morning of the 22d, before the landing was made on Long Island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Washington wrote to Heath the next day: \"Our first\r\naccounts were that they intended by a forced march to surprise General\r\nSullivan's lines, who commands during the illness of General Greene;\r\nwhereupon I immediately reinforced that post with six regiments.\"\r\nMiles, Silliman, and Chester's adjutant, Tallmadge, state that their\r\nregiments were among the first to cross after the enemy landed.\r\nSullivan's orders of the 25th and other records seem to indicate that\r\nAtlee's, Lasher's, and Drake's were the other three battalions sent\r\nover at the same time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: See Sullivan's orders, Silliman's letters, Miles'\r\nJournal (Part II.), and Chambers' letter. [Transcriber's Note: The\r\nmarker in the text for this footnote is missing in the original.]]\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 23d, however, brought no battle, nor did the enemy\r\nattempt any advance for three days. Washington made Sullivan an early\r\nvisit, saw the situation there for himself, and during the day issued\r\nanother of his fervent orders to the army. He formally announced the\r\nlanding of the British, and again reminded his troops that the moment\r\nwas approaching on which their honor and success and the safety of the\r\ncountry depended. \"Remember, officers and soldiers,\" he said, \"that\r\nyou are freemen, fighting for the blessings of liberty; that slavery\r\nwill be your portion, and that of your posterity, if you do not acquit\r\nyourselves like men. Remember how your courage and spirit have been\r\ndespised and traduced by your cruel invaders; though they have found\r\nby dear experience at Boston, Charleston, and other places what a few\r\nbrave men, contending in their own land and in the best of causes, can\r\ndo against base hirelings and mercenaries.\" He urged them, too, to be\r\ncool, but determined; not to fire at a distance, but wait for the word\r\nfrom their officers; and gave express orders that if any man\r\nattempted to skulk, lie down, or retreat, he must be instantly shot\r\ndown as an example. Those who should distinguish themselves for\r\ngallantry and good conduct were assured that they might depend upon\r\nbeing honorably noticed and suitably rewarded. Strict orders as to\r\nother matters were also issued. The commissary-general was to have\r\nfive days' baked bread on hand for distribution; the men were to have\r\nconstantly ready with them two days' hard bread and pork, and the\r\nofficers were to see not only that they had it, but kept it. The\r\nofficers of the newly arrived militiamen were instructed also to see\r\nthat the cartridges fitted their soldiers' muskets, and that each man\r\nhad twenty-four rounds and two flints.\r\n\r\nOn the Long Island front, Sullivan was alert, and kept his division in\r\nreadiness for the attack, which was now hourly expected. He ordered\r\nhis command that afternoon, the 23d, to prepare two days' provisions\r\nand turn out the next morning at three o'clock. For the night, he\r\nassigned Hitchcock's and Little's regiments to guard the Flatbush\r\nPass, Johnston's and Martin's to the coast road, and Remsen's Long\r\nIsland militia to support Miles on the Bedford Road. They were all to\r\nbe at their posts at six o'clock, and the regiments they relieved were\r\nto return to their encampments and, like the rest, \"get two days'\r\nprovisions dressed, and be ready for action.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some brisk skirmishing occurred in front of Flatbush. In the\r\nafternoon of this day, the enemy, as Sullivan reported, formed, and\r\nattempted to pass the road by Bedford, but meeting a warm reception\r\nfrom the riflemen, some \"musketry\" sent to their support, and two or\r\nthree of our field pieces, they fell back. \"Our men,\" wrote Sullivan\r\nto Washington, \"followed them to the house of Judge Lefferts (where a\r\nnumber of them had taken lodgings), drove them out, and burnt the\r\nhouse and a number of other buildings contiguous. They think they\r\nkilled a number; and, as evidence of it, they produced three officers'\r\nhangers, a carbine, and one dead body, with a considerable sum of\r\nmoney in pocket. I have ordered a party out for prisoners\r\nto-night.\"[115] The enemy returned in force, and the American\r\nskirmishers, having but two wounded, withdrew to the hills; but their\r\nconduct in the affair was so highly appreciated by Sullivan, that he\r\nissued a congratulatory order in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"The general returns his thanks to the brave officers and soldiers\r\nwho, with so much spirit and intrepidity, repulsed the enemy and\r\ndefeated their designs of taking possession of the woods near our\r\nlines. He is now convinced that the troops he has the honor to command\r\nwill not, in point of bravery, yield to any troops in the universe.\r\nThe cheerfulness with which they do their duty, and the patience with\r\nwhich they undergo fatigue, evince exalted sentiments of freedom and\r\nlove of country, and gives him most satisfactory evidence that when\r\ncalled upon they will prove themselves worthy of that freedom for\r\nwhich they are now contending.\"[116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Referring evidently to this skirmish,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Chambers says: \"Strong guards were maintained all\r\nday on the flanks of the enemy, and our regiment and the Hessian\r\nyagers kept up a severe firing, with a loss of but two wounded on our\r\nside. We laid a few Hessians low, and made them retreat out of\r\nFlatbush. Our people went into the town and brought the goods out of\r\nthe burning houses. The enemy liked to have lost their field-pieces.\r\nCaptain Steel acted bravely. We would certainly have had the cannon\r\nhad it not been for some foolish person calling retreat. The main body\r\nof the foe returned to town, and when our lads came back they told of\r\ntheir exploits.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Little's Order Book, _Document_ 2. But it seems that\r\nRemsen's Long Island militiamen were seized by a panic, either during\r\nthis skirmish or at a later hour, on the Bedford Road, and ran from\r\ntheir posts. Sullivan rebuked them sharply in his orders of the 24th\r\n(_Document_ 2), and confined them thereafter to \"fatigue\" duty. This\r\nproved to be only the first of several militia panics experienced in\r\nthis campaign.]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, Washington was still in doubt as to the intentions of the\r\nenemy. Reports represented their numbers on Long Island at not more\r\nthan eight thousand, whereas they were double this estimate; and it\r\nwas suspected at headquarters that their landing might only be a feint\r\nto draw off our troops to that side, while the real attack should be\r\nmade on New York. But the imprudence of running any risks on the\r\nBrooklyn side was obvious, and Washington sent over a further\r\nreinforcement of four regiments, which appear to have been Wyllys's,\r\nHuntington's, and Tyler's of Parsons' brigade (his entire command was\r\nthere on the next day) together with the Pennsylvania detachments\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Lutz and Major Hay. On this date\r\nBrigadier-General Lord Stirling crossed over, where more than half his\r\nbrigade had preceded him; and Brigadier-General John Nixon, whose name\r\nnow first appears in connection with the operations on Long Island,\r\nwas detailed as field officer of the day, with orders to take command\r\nof the outer line and post his men \"in the edge of the woods next the\r\nenemy.\"[117]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Sullivan's Orders, August 24th. _Document_ 2.]\r\n\r\nBut the principal event of the 24th was the change made in the chief\r\ncommand on Long Island. Sullivan was superseded by Putnam. There were\r\nnow on that side the whole of Nixon's and Heard's brigades (the two\r\nregiments on Governor's Island excepted), the larger part of\r\nStirling's and Parson's, and half of Scott's and Wadsworth's. As this\r\nroster included one third of the army's effective force, the command\r\ncould properly be assigned to Putnam as the senior major-general\r\npresent; but it does not appear that the question of his rank entered\r\ninto the reasons for the change. In a letter to Governor Livingston\r\nfrom Colonel Reed, the adjutant-general, dated August 30th, 1776, the\r\nstatement is made that Washington, \"finding a great force going to\r\nLong Island, sent over Putnam;\" leaving the inference to be drawn\r\nthat, apart from his rank, Putnam was considered the proper officer,\r\nor an officer competent, to command such a force. Reed states further\r\nthat some movements had been made on Long Island of which the\r\ncommander-in-chief did not entirely approve, and this also called for\r\na change. Sullivan, too, was wholly unacquainted with the ground;\r\nalthough, as to this, Putnam's knowledge of it was not extensive, as\r\nhe had been over it only \"occasionally.\" That Sullivan was a brave,\r\nzealous, and active officer, his military career abundantly proves.\r\nAppointed a brigadier-general from New Hampshire, he commanded a\r\nbrigade under Lee throughout the Boston siege, and had been sent, as\r\nalready stated, in the spring of this year to help repair the\r\nmisfortunes attending our force on the Canada border; but success was\r\nnot to be met with there, and Sullivan, finding Gates promoted to the\r\nchief command in that quarter, returned, after visiting Congress, to\r\nthe New York army. Like most of our general officers at that date, he\r\nas yet lacked military experience, especially in an independent\r\ncapacity, for which his ambition to succeed was not a sufficient\r\nequivalent. How far Putnam was more competent to assume the command on\r\nLong Island, is a point which the issue there, at least, did not\r\ndetermine. His record before this was all in his favor. A veteran of\r\nthe old war, a man of known personal courage, blunt, honest,\r\npractical, and devoted to the American cause, he had the confidence\r\nof at least the older part of the army, with which he had been\r\nidentified from the beginning of the struggle. As he had never been\r\ntried in a separate department, Washington could not say how he would\r\nmanage it, but he could say, from his experience with him at Boston,\r\nthat Putnam was \"a most valuable man and fine executive officer,\"[118]\r\nand such he continued to prove himself through the present campaign.\r\nHe seconded Washington heartily and efficiently in all his plans and\r\npreparations, and when he was sent to Long Island the commander-in-chief\r\nhad reason to feel that whatever directions he might give as to\r\noperations there, Putnam would follow them out to the letter. But if\r\nPutnam took the general command across the river, Sullivan continued\r\nin active subordinate control, as second in command.[119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Washington to Congress, January 30th, 1776.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: In regard to the change in the command, the\r\nadjutant-general's statement in full is this: \"On General Greene's\r\nbeing sick, Sullivan took the command, who was wholly unacquainted\r\nwith the ground or country. Some movements being made which the\r\ngeneral did not approve entirely, and finding a great force going to\r\nLong Island, he sent over Putnam, who had been over occasionally; this\r\ngave some disgust, so that Putnam was directed to soothe and soften as\r\nmuch as possible.\" (_Sedgwick's Life of Livingston_, p. 201.) What\r\nmovements were referred to, unless it was the random firing of the\r\nskirmishers and the burning of houses at Flatbush by some of our men,\r\nor how Putnam was to reconcile Sullivan to the change, as he was\r\ndirected (this evidently being the meaning of Reed's last phrase),\r\ndoes not appear. From subsequent occurrences, the inference is\r\njustified that Putnam did not disturb Sullivan's arrangements, but\r\nleft the disposition of the troops to him. What Sullivan himself says\r\nis given in a note further along in the chapter. That Putnam went over\r\non the 24th, and in the forenoon, is evident from a letter from Reed\r\nto his wife of that date, in which he says: \"While I am writing, there\r\nis a heavy firing and clouds of smoke rising from the wood [on Long\r\nIsland]. General Putnam was made happy by obtaining leave to go\r\nover--the brave old man was quite miserable at being kept here.\"\r\n(_Reed's Life of Reed._) This firing, as Washington wrote to Schuyler\r\non the same date, occurred in the morning. Putnam had been engaged\r\nduring the summer, principally, in looking after the defences in the\r\ncity and the river obstructions. He had charge, also, of the water\r\ntransportation, boats, pettiaugers, etc. His division was in the city\r\nor close to it. Had the enemy, accordingly, attacked the city\r\ndirectly, it would have fallen largely to Putnam to conduct the\r\ndefence; and this is doubtless the reason why, as Reed says, he was\r\n\"kept here.\" But as it now seemed certain that the British were\r\nconcentrating on Long Island, he evidently wished to be with the\r\ntroops there, where that morning there was \"a heavy firing\" going on,\r\nand obtained leave to cross. Finding a change desirable, Washington,\r\nprobably at the same time, gave Putnam the command and \"sent\" him\r\nover.]\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, Putnam received written instructions from Washington. He\r\nwas directed to form a proper line of defence around his encampment\r\nand works on the most advantageous ground; to have a brigadier of the\r\nday constantly upon the lines that he might be on the spot to command;\r\nto have field-officers go the rounds and report the situation of the\r\nguards; to have the guards particularly instructed in their duty; and\r\nto compel all the men on duty to remain at their camps or quarters and\r\nbe ready to turn out at a moment's warning. The wood next to Red Hook\r\nbordering Gowanus Creek was to be well attended to, and the woods\r\nelsewhere secured by abattis, if necessary, to make the enemy's\r\nprogress as difficult as possible. The militia, or troops which were\r\nleast disciplined and had seen the least service, were to man the\r\ninterior lines, while the best men were \"at all hazards\" to prevent\r\nthe enemy's passing the woods and approaching the works. He\r\ndisapproved also of the unmeaning picket firing and the burning of\r\nhouses, and warned the general finally that when the attack came it\r\nwas certain to be \"sudden and violent.\"[120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Mr. Davis, in his Life of Aaron Burr, who was Putnam's\r\naid at this time, states that after crossing to Long Island and making\r\nthe round of the outposts, he (Burr) urged his general to beat up the\r\nenemy's camp, but that Putnam declined, on the ground that his orders\r\nrequired him to remain strictly on the defensive.]\r\n\r\nFor brigadier for the day, General Lord Stirling was assigned to duty\r\non this date.[121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Sullivan's Orders, August 25th. _Document_ 2.]\r\n\r\nIn the skirmishing that continued from the 24th to the 26th the\r\nAmericans showed skill and bravery, although at times indulging in\r\ndesultory firing. The riflemen, supported by field-pieces, made\r\noccasioned dashes upon the enemy and picked off their men with almost\r\nno loss to themselves. Among the troops on picket near Flatbush, on\r\nthe 25th, were Colonel Silliman and his Connecticut battalion; and\r\nfrom the colonel, who wrote from there, on a drum-head, to his wife,\r\nwe get a glimpse of the situation at that point during his tour of\r\nduty. \"I am now posted,\" he says, \"within about half a mile from the\r\nRegulars with my Regt. under the covert of a woody hill to stop their\r\npassage into the country. There are a number of Regts. posted all\r\naround the town within about the same distance and for the same\r\npurpose. The Regulars keep up an almost constant fire from their\r\nCannon and Mortars at some or other of us, but neither shott nor shell\r\nhas come near my Regt. as yet and they are at too great a distance to\r\nfire muskets at. I have a scouting party going out now to see if they\r\ncan't pick up some or get something from them.... They have wounded in\r\nall of our men in 3 days skirmish about 8 or 9, one or two mortally,\r\nwhich is not half the number that we have killed for them besides\r\nwounded.\" On the 26th a considerable party with artillery attacked the\r\nHessians and drove them in, killing several men belonging to the Von\r\nLossberg regiment, which later in the day advanced in turn and\r\ncompelled our skirmishers to fall back. In this affair Colonel Ephraim\r\nMartin, of New Jersey, was severely wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th, Washington again crossed to Long Island,\r\nwhere he remained until night. The records are quite silent as to how\r\nhe passed the most of his time, but judging from his letter to\r\nCongress of this date, in which he expressed his belief that the enemy\r\nhad landed nearly all their force on that side, and that it was there\r\nthey would make their \"grand push,\" it was doubtless a busy, watchful,\r\nand anxious day with him. To suppose that he did not inform himself of\r\nall the preparations made to meet the enemy, that he did not know what\r\nnumber of men were posted on the hills and at what points, that he did\r\nnot study the several modes and directions of attack possible for the\r\nenemy to adopt, and that he did not himself give personal directions,\r\nwould be to charge that at the most important moment of the campaign\r\nhe failed to exercise that care and attention to detail which he\r\nexercised on so many occasions both before and after. Indeed, although\r\nPutnam and Sullivan were in immediate command on Long Island,\r\nWashington never shifted the final responsibility from his own\r\nshoulders, and as a matter of fact was probably as well acquainted\r\nwith the ground as either of these generals. Towards evening, in\r\ncompany with Putnam, Sullivan, and other officers, he rode down to the\r\noutposts near Flatbush and examined the position of the enemy. How\r\nlong he remained, or what information he was able to gather, does not\r\nappear; but both the other generals, Putnam and Sullivan, made a\r\ndetour of the pickets either at this time or at an earlier hour in the\r\nday, visited Miles and Brodhead on the extreme left, took their\r\nopinion as to the movements and intentions of the British, so far as\r\none could be formed by them, and then rode off to the right \"to\r\nreconnoitre the enemies lines.\"[122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Several writers, Mr. Sparks among them, make the\r\nstatement that neither Washington nor Putnam went outside of the\r\nBrooklyn lines. It would be impossible to credit this without absolute\r\nproof of the fact. Washington always reconnoitred the position of the\r\nenemy whenever they were near each other; in the last scenes of the\r\nwar at Yorktown he was among the first at the outposts examining the\r\nBritish works. Undoubtedly he rode out to the Flatbush Pass on the\r\n26th, as stated by the writer of the letter to the _South Carolina\r\nGazette_ (Document 19), who says: \"The evening preceding the action,\r\nGeneral Washington, with a number of general officers, went down to\r\nview the motions of the enemy, who were encamped at Flatbush.\" A\r\nletter from a survivor of the Revolution, present on Long Island,\r\npublished in a newspaper several years since, well authenticated, and\r\npreserved in one of Mr. Onderdonk's scrap-books in the Astor Library,\r\nNew York, confirms this statement. The soldier recollects that he saw\r\nWashington and others looking at the enemy with their glasses.]\r\n\r\nOn this day also, the 26th, additional regiments were sent over. Two\r\nof these were the remainder of Stirling's brigade--Haslet's Delaware\r\nbattalion, the largest in the army, as we have seen, and Smallwood's\r\nMarylanders, one of the choicest and best equipped. Either on this or\r\none of the two previous days, Lieutenant-Colonel Kachlein's incomplete\r\nbattalion of Pennsylvania riflemen, with two or three independent\r\ncompanies from Maryland, crossed; and among the last to go over were\r\none hundred picked men, the nucleus of the \"Rangers,\" from Durkee's\r\nConnecticut Continentals at Bergen, with Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas\r\nKnowlton at their head.[123] These additions raised the force on Long\r\nIsland on the night of the 26th to a total of about seven thousand men\r\nfit for duty.[124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Statement of Colonel Thomas Grosvenor to the late David\r\nP. Hall, Esq., of New York, who knew Grosvenor well, and preserved\r\nmany facts in writing in regard to his military career. Knowlton's\r\ncaptains were Grosvenor and Stephen Brown, of Pomfret, Conn. The\r\ndetachment was on duty at the outposts on the night of the 26th. The\r\nsoldier whose letter is referred to in the note preceding this was one\r\nof the \"Rangers,\" and he states that their number was about one\r\nhundred. That Smallwood's and Haslet's regiments crossed on the 26th,\r\nwe have from Smallwood himself.--_Force_, 5th Series, vol. ii., p.\r\n1011.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: The regiments were Little's and Ward's, from\r\nMassachusetts; Varnum's and Hitchcock's, from Rhode Island;\r\nHuntington's, Wyllys's, Tyler's, Chester's, Silliman's, and Gay's, and\r\nKnowlton's \"Rangers,\" from Connecticut; Lasher's and Drake's, from New\r\nYork; Smith's and Remsen's, from Long Island; Martin's, Forman's,\r\nJohnston's, Newcomb's, and Cortland's, from New Jersey; Hand's,\r\nMiles', Atlee's, Lutz's, Kachlein's, and Hay's, detachment from\r\nPennsylvania; Haslet's, from Delaware; and Smallwood's, from Maryland.\r\nAmong other artillery officers on that side were Captains Newell and\r\nTreadwell, Captain-Lieutenants John Johnston and Benajah Carpenter;\r\nLieutenants Lillie and \"Cadet\" John Callender. This list is believed\r\nto include all the battalions and detachments on Long Island at the\r\ntime the British attacked.]\r\n\r\nFollowing in turn after Nixon and Stirling, Brigadier-General Parsons\r\nwas detailed as field officer of the day[125] for the next twenty-four\r\nhours--the day of the engagement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Parson's own statement, letter of October 5th: \"On the\r\nday of the surprise I was on duty.\"--_Document_ 5.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about the time that Washington started to return to his\r\nheadquarters at New York, on this evening, Sir William Howe began to\r\nset his columns in motion for the attack, and on the next morning, at\r\nthe passes in the hills and along their inner slopes, was fought what\r\nis known in our Revolutionary history as the battle of Long Island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortunately, a point so essential to the comprehension of the progress\r\nof any engagement, the position of both armies on Long Island, just\r\nbefore the attack, is now known nearly to the last detail. The record\r\nhere is clear and satisfactory. On the night of the 26th, the various\r\nregiments and detachments on guard at the American outposts numbered\r\nnot far from twenty-eight hundred men. At the important Flatbush Pass,\r\nsupporting the two or three gun battery there, and with strong pickets\r\nthrown out to the edge of the woods nearest the enemy, were posted\r\nHitchcock's and Little's Continental regiments, and Johnston's New\r\nJersey battalion, the two former being commanded by their\r\nlieutenant-colonels, Cornell and Henshaw. To this point, also,\r\nKnowlton and his rangers appear to have been sent. The battery or\r\nredoubt here stood about where the Flatbush and narrow Port Road\r\nunited, and was apparently no more than a plain breastwork, with\r\nfelled trees in front of it, thrown up across the road, and perhaps\r\nextending to the rising ground on the left.[126] At the coast road,\r\naround and beyond the Red Lion, the guards consisted of Hand's\r\nriflemen, half of Atlee's musketry, detachments of New York troops,\r\nand part of Lutz's Pennsylvanians under Major Burd. At the Bedford\r\nPass, to the left of the Flatbush Road, were stationed Colonel Samuel\r\nWyllys's Connecticut Continentals, and Colonel Chester's regiment from\r\nthe same State, under Lieutenant-Colonel Solomon Wills, of Tolland,\r\nwho had seen service in the French war and at Havana. Still further to\r\nthe left, Colonel Miles was now encamped a short distance beyond, in\r\nthe woods. Between these several passes, sentinels were stationed at\r\nintervals along the crest of the ridge, to keep communication open\r\nfrom one end of the line to the other.[127]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: The site of this breastwork is now within the limits of\r\nProspect Park, and it stood across what is known as \"Battle Pass.\" Dr.\r\nStiles in his History of Brooklyn, and Mr. Field in vol. ii. of the\r\nL.I. Hist. Society's _Memoirs_, put a well-constructed redoubt at this\r\npoint on a hill-top to the left of the road. The account in the _South\r\nCarolina Gazette_ says that the Flatbush Pass guards were posted \"near\r\na mile from the parting of the road [_i.e._, a mile from where the\r\nFlatbush Road branched from the Jamaica Road] where an _abattis_ was\r\nformed across the road, and a breastwork thrown up and defended by two\r\npieces of cannon.\" In the original sketch of the \"engagement,\" made by\r\nJohn Ewing, who was Hand's brother-in-law, and with him on the spot,\r\nthere is this reference: \"F. Where a considerable Number of our people\r\nwere stationed with several Field-pieces & Breast-works made with\r\nTrees felled across the Road to defend themselves when attacked.\"\r\n(_Document_ 15.) Colonel Miles speaks of \"a small redoubt in front of\r\nthe village [Flatbush]\" (_Document_ 20.) The breastwork across the\r\nroad was doubtless the principal defence here, and this was merely\r\ntemporary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: The number of men at each of the three passes was about\r\neight hundred, and on the left of these were Miles' two battalions,\r\nwith perhaps five hundred men on duty. Sullivan's orders of August\r\n25th give the detail which was to mount for picket on the following\r\nmorning. This detail, therefore, was the one on duty on the night of\r\nthe 26th. The order runs: \"Eight hundred [men] properly officered to\r\nrelieve the troops on Bedford Road to-morrow morning, six field\r\nofficers to attend with this party. The same number to relieve those\r\non Bush [Flatbush] Road, and an equal number those stationed towards\r\nthe Narrows. A picket of three hundred men under the command of a\r\nField Officer, six Captains, twelve subalterns to be posted at the\r\nwood on the west side of the creek every night till further orders.\"\r\n(See also _Documents_ 5, 18, 19.) That Miles was on the extreme left,\r\nwe well know; that Wyllys was at the Bedford Pass, appears from both\r\nMiles' and Brodhead's accounts; that Chester's regiment was with him,\r\nappears from an extract quoted below--Chester's lieutenant-colonel\r\nbeing Solomon Wills; that Johnston was at the Flatbush Pass, appears\r\nfrom the same and other authorities; that Henshaw with Little's\r\nregiment was there, he himself states; that Cornell was also there\r\nwith Hitchcock's Rhode Islanders, appears from Captain Olney's\r\nnarrative as given in _Mrs. Williams' Life of Olney_, and from the\r\nlists of prisoners; that Hand was at the lower road, until relieved,\r\nand Major Burd also, the major himself and Ewing's sketch both state;\r\nthe New York detachment there was probably a part of Lasher's\r\nregiment. The extract referred to is from the _Connecticut Courant_,\r\ncontaining a letter from an officer engaged in the battle, which says:\r\n\"The night before August 27th, on the west road, were posted Colonel\r\nHand's regiment, a detachment from Pennsylvania and New York; next\r\neast were posted Colonel Johnson, of Jersey, and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHenshaw, of Massachusetts; next east were posted Colonel Wyllys and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Wills, of Connecticut. East of all these Colonel\r\nMiles, of Pennsylvania, was posted towards Jamaica, to watch the\r\nmotion of the enemy and give intelligence.\"]\r\n\r\nAs far, then, to the left as Miles' position the hills were as well\r\nguarded as seemed possible with the limited force that could be\r\nspared, and at the passes themselves a stout resistance could have\r\nbeen offered. But it was still an attenuated line, more than four\r\nmiles long, not parallel but oblique to the line of works at Brooklyn,\r\nand distant from it not less than one and a half, and at the farthest\r\nposts nearly three miles. Should the enemy pierce it at any one point,\r\nan immediate retreat would have been necessary from every other. The\r\nline could have been defended with confidence only on the supposition\r\nthat the British would not venture to penetrate the thick woods, but\r\nadvance along the roads through the passes.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in this disposition no provision was made for\r\nholding the fourth or Jamaica Pass far over to the left. That the\r\nenemy could approach or make a diversion by that route, must have been\r\nwell understood. But the posting of a permanent guard there would\r\nobviously have been attended with hazard, for the distance from the\r\nlines to this pass was four miles, and from the Bedford Pass two miles\r\nand a half through the woods. The position was thus extremely\r\nisolated, if the troops stationed there were expected to make the\r\nfortified line their point of retreat. None were stationed there\r\nduring the five days since the British landed, and it nowhere appears\r\nthat any were intended or ordered to be so stationed by either\r\nSullivan, Putnam, or the commander-in-chief. There was but one\r\neffective way of preventing surprise from that quarter, and that was\r\nto have squads of cavalry or troops constantly patrolling the road,\r\nwho on the appearance of an enemy could carry the word immediately and\r\nrapidly to the outposts and the camp. But in all Washington's army\r\nthere was not a single company of horsemen, except the few Long Island\r\ntroopers from Kings and Queens counties, and these were now engaged\r\nmiles away in driving off stock out of reach of the enemy. The duty,\r\naccordingly, of looking after the open left flank fell, in part, upon\r\nColonel Miles' two battalions. Lieutenant-Colonel Brodhead leaves it\r\non record that it was \"hard duty.\" The regiment sent out scouting\r\nparties every day a distance of four or five miles; one hundred men\r\nwere mounted for guard daily, and thirty more with a lieutenant were\r\nkept on duty on the left, evidently in the direction of the Jamaica\r\nRoad. General Parsons reports that \"in the wood was placed Colonel\r\nMiles with his Battalion to watch the motion of the Enemy on that\r\npart, with orders to keep a party constantly reconnoitering to and\r\nacross the Jamaica road.\" Should he discover the enemy at any time,\r\nit would have been expected of him to report the fact at once, oppose\r\nthem vigorously, and retreat obstinately in order to give time for the\r\nother detachments to govern their movements accordingly.\r\n\r\nOne other circumstance is to be noticed in regard to this Jamaica\r\nPass. General Sullivan, subsequently referring to his connection with\r\nthis battle, claimed that while he was in sole command he paid\r\nhorsemen out of his own purse to patrol the road, and that he\r\npredicted the approach of the enemy by that road. Whatever inferences\r\nmay be drawn from this is not now to the point; but we have the fact\r\nthat upon the evening of the 26th he exercised the same authority he\r\nhad exercised in making other details, and sent out a special patrol\r\nof five commissioned officers to watch the Jamaica Pass. Three of\r\nthese officers belonged to Colonel Lasher's New York City\r\nbattalion--Adjutant Jeronimus Hoogland and Lieutenants Robert Troup\r\nand Edward Dunscomb; and the other two were Lieutenant Gerrit Van\r\nWagenen, a detached officer of McDougall's old regiment, and a\r\nLieutenant Gilliland, who with Van Wagenen had crossed to Long Island,\r\nas a volunteer. What part this patrol played in the incidents of the\r\nfollowing morning will presently appear.\r\n\r\nThus on the night of the 26th the American outposts stretched along\r\nthe hills from the harbor to the Jamaica Pass, with unguarded\r\nintervals, a distance of more than six miles, while in the plains\r\nbelow lay the enemy, nearly ten times their number, ready to fall upon\r\nthem with \"a sudden and violent\" shock. During the night one change\r\nwas made in the picket guard. Colonel Hand's riflemen, who had been on\r\nalmost constant duty since the arrival of the British, were relieved\r\nat two o'clock in the morning by a detachment from the flying camp,\r\nwhich may have been a part of Hay's and Kachlein's men, and returning\r\nto the lines, dropped down to sleep.[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Hand's letter of August 27th: \"I escaped my part by\r\nbeing relieved at 2 o'clock this morning.\" (Document 12.) See John\r\nEwing's letter and sketch.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we leave our outposts now upon the hills and pass into the enemy's\r\ncamp on the plain below, we shall find them on the eve of carrying out\r\na great plan of attack. The four days since the 22d had been given to\r\npreparation. On the 25th, Lieutenant-General De Heister crossed from\r\nStaten Island with the two Hessian brigades of Von Stirn and Von\r\nMirbach, leaving behind Von Lossberg's brigade, with some detachments\r\nand recruits, for the security of that island. With this addition,\r\nHowe's force on Long Island was swelled to a total of about twenty-one\r\nthousand officers and men, fit for duty and in the best condition for\r\nactive service.[129] As disposed on the 26th, the army lay with the\r\nHessians and the reserves under Cornwallis at Flatbush, the main body\r\nunder Clinton and Percy massed at Flatlands, and Grant's division of\r\nthe fourth and sixth brigades nearer the Narrows.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Extract from a British officer's letter dated, _Statton\r\nIsland, August 4, 1776_: ... \"We are now in expectation of attacking\r\nthe fellows very soon, and if I may be allowed to judge, there never\r\nwas an army in better spirits nor in better health, two very important\r\nthings for our present business.\"--_Hist. Mag._, vol. v., p. 69.]\r\n\r\nOutnumbering the Americans three to one on the island, Howe could lay\r\nhis plans with assurance of almost absolute success. He proposed to\r\nadvance upon the \"rebels\" in three columns. Grant was ordered to move\r\nup from the Narrows along the lower road, and De Heister was to engage\r\nthe attention of the Americans at the Flatbush Pass, while Clinton,\r\nPercy, and Cornwallis, with Howe himself, were to conduct the main\r\nbody as a flanking force around the American left by way of the\r\nJamaica Pass. A previous reconnoissance made by Clinton and Erskine,\r\nand information gathered from the Tories, showed the practicability of\r\nthis latter movement.[130] Grant and De Heister were simply to make a\r\nshow of an attack until they were assured by the sound of the firing\r\nthat the flanking column had accomplished its design, when their\r\ndemonstrations were to be turned into serious fighting. It was\r\nexpected that by this plan the Americans stationed at the hills and\r\npasses would be entirely enveloped and thoroughly beaten if not\r\ncaptured in a body. With what nice precision this piece of strategy\r\nwas executed, events will show.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Stedman, the British historian, who served as an\r\nofficer under Howe, says: \"Sir Henry Clinton and Sir William Erskine,\r\nhaving reconnoitred the position of the enemy, saw that it would not\r\nbe a difficult matter to turn their left flank, which would either\r\noblige them to risk an engagement or to retire under manifest\r\ndisadvantage. This intelligence being communicated to Sir William\r\nHowe, he consented to make the attempt.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first collision was ominous. Grant's advance-guard, marching up\r\nfrom the Narrows, struck the American pickets in the vicinity of the\r\nRed Lion about two o'clock on the morning of the 27th. Whether because\r\nthey were all new troops, a part of whom had but just come upon the\r\nground, and were alarmed by the night attack, or because they were\r\nsurprised at their posts and put in danger of capture, or whatever the\r\nreason, our picket guard at that point retreated before the enemy\r\nwithout checking their march. There was hardly more than an exchange\r\nof fire with Major Burd's detachment, as the major himself writes, and\r\nin the confusion or darkness he, with many others probably, was taken\r\nprisoner. This was an unfortunate beginning, so far as our men had\r\nabandoned one of the very posts which it had been proposed to hold;\r\nbut otherwise, there being other positions available, it was not\r\nnecessarily fatal to the plan of defending the hills.[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Hardly more than a general statement can be made in\r\nregard to the attack on the pickets at the lower road. A part of them\r\nwatched Martense Lane, where, it would appear from Ewing's sketch,\r\nHand's riflemen were posted before being relieved. Major Burd's\r\ndetachment, on the same authority, was probably on the direct road to\r\nthe Narrows, both parties communicating with each other at the Red\r\nLion Tavern, which stood near the fork of the roads. Grant's main\r\ncolumn advanced by the Narrows Road, and possibly a party of the enemy\r\ncame through the Martense Lane at about the same time. The skirmish\r\nMajor Burd speaks of occurred in the vicinity of Thirty-eighth and\r\nFortieth streets, on the Narrows Road, where former residents used to\r\nsay the Americans had a picket guard stationed. When the enemy came up\r\nfiring took place and some men were killed; and this firing \"was the\r\nfirst in the neighborhood.\" The pickets retreated, though General\r\nParsons was misinformed when he wrote that they did so \"without firing\r\na gun.\" There was firing, but no stand made.]\r\n\r\nWord of the attack was quickly carried to General Parsons at his\r\nquarters and to General Putnam in camp. Parsons, as the brigadier on\r\nduty, rode at once to the spot, and found \"by fair daylight\" not only\r\nthat the guards had \"fled,\" but that the enemy were through the woods\r\nand already on this side of the main hills. Hastily collecting some\r\ntwenty of the scattered pickets, he made a show of resistance, which\r\ntemporarily halted the enemy's column.[132] At the same time Putnam,\r\nwhose instructions were to hold the outposts \"at all hazards\" with his\r\nbest men, called up Stirling and directed him in person to take the\r\ntwo regiments nearest at hand and march down to meet the enemy.[133]\r\nStirling promptly turned out Haslet's and Smallwood's battalions and\r\nmarched down. Colonel Atlee, who was also ordered forward, was on the\r\nroad before him, with that part of his regiment, about one hundred and\r\ntwenty men, not already on picket; and Huntington's Connecticut\r\nContinentals, under Lieutenant-Colonel Clark (Huntington himself being\r\nsick),[134] and Kachlein's Pennsylvania riflemen were soon after\r\nstarted in the same direction. Meanwhile, within the lines, the\r\nalarm-guns were fired, the whole camp roused, and the troops drawn up\r\nat the forts and breastworks. Hand's riflemen, who had but just lain\r\ndown, \"almost dead with fatigue,\" were turned out to take post in Fort\r\nPutnam and the redoubt on its left.[135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Parsons' Letters._ Part II., Document 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: _Stirling to Washington, Aug. 29th:_ \"About three\r\no'clock on the morning of the 27th I was called up, and informed by\r\nGeneral Putnam that the enemy were advancing,\" etc.--_Force_, 5th\r\nSeries, vol. i., p. 1245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: \"Col. Huntington is unwell, but I hope getting a little\r\nbetter. He has a slow fever. Maj. Dyer is also unwell with a slow\r\nfever. Gen'l Greene has been very sick but is better. Genls. Putnam,\r\nSullivan, Lord Sterling, Nixon, Parsons, & Heard are on Long Island\r\nand a strong part of our army.\"--_Letter from Col. Trumbull, Aug.\r\n27th, 1776._ _Document_ 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: See references on Ewing's sketch, Document 15: \"H. Fort\r\nPutnam where part of Colo. Hand's men commanded by Lieut C.\r\n[Lieutenant-Colonel] Chambers were detached from the Regt. to man the\r\nfort.--I. A small upper Fort where [I] was with the Colo the Day of\r\nthe Engagement.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Chambers says: \"We had just got to\r\nthe fort, and I had only laid down, when the alarm-guns were fired. We\r\nwere compelled to turn out to the lines, and as soon as it was light\r\nsaw our men and theirs engaged with field-pieces.\" Nearly all the\r\naccounts put Hand and his battalion at the Flatbush Pass during the\r\nbattle on the 27th. This, as we now find, is an error. The battalion\r\nwas worn out by its continued and effective skirmishing since the\r\nlanding of the enemy, and required rest; but of this it was to get\r\nvery little, even within the lines.]\r\n\r\nWhen Stirling reached a point within half a mile of the Red Lion he\r\nfound, as Parsons had before him, that the enemy had met with little\r\nopposition or delay at the outposts on that road, and were now on the\r\nfull march towards the Brooklyn lines. As there were still good\r\npositions which he could occupy, he immediately made a disposition of\r\nhis force to offer resistance. The road here ran in a winding course\r\nalong the line of the present Third Avenue, but a short distance from\r\nthe bay, with here and there a dwelling which together constituted the\r\nGowanus village or settlement. Where the present Twenty-third Street\r\nintersects the avenue there was a small bridge on the old road which\r\ncrossed a ditch or creek setting up from the bay to a low and marshy\r\npiece of ground on the left, looking south; and just the other side of\r\nthe bridge, the land rose to quite a bluff at the water's edge, which\r\nwas known among the Dutch villagers as \"Blockje's Bergh.\" From the\r\nbluff the low hill fell gradually to the marsh or morass just\r\nmentioned, the road continuing along between them.[136] Right here,\r\ntherefore, the approach by the road was narrow, and at the corner of\r\nTwenty-third Street was confined to the crossing at the bridge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: The writer is indebted to the Hon. Teunis G. Bergen, of\r\nBay Ridge, L.I., for an accurate description and sketch of the Gowanus\r\nRoad, as it lay at the time of the battle.

BRIGADIER GENERAL 1777.\r\n\r\nSteel Engr. F. von Egloffstein N.Y.]\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, and from our present knowledge of the\r\ntopography, Stirling evidently came to a halt on or just this side of\r\n\"Blockje's Bergh.\" Seeing the British not far in his front, and taking\r\nin the situation at a glance, he ordered Atlee to post his men on the\r\nleft of the road and wait the enemy's coming up, while he himself\r\nretired with Smallwood's and Haslet's to form line on a piece of \"very\r\nadvantageous ground\" further back. Atlee reports this preliminary move\r\nas follows: \"I received orders from Lord Stirling to advance with my\r\nbattalion and oppose the enemy's passing a morass or swamp at the foot\r\nof a fine rising ground, upon which they were first discovered, and\r\nthereby give time to our brigade to form upon the heights. This order\r\nI immediately obeyed, notwithstanding we must be exposed without any\r\nkind of cover to the great fire of the enemy's musketry and\r\nfield-pieces, charged with round and grapeshot, and finely situated\r\nupon the eminence above mentioned, having entire command of the ground\r\nI was ordered to occupy. My battalion, although new and never before\r\nhaving the opportunity of facing an enemy, sustained their fire until\r\nthe brigade had formed; but finding we could not possibly prevent\r\ntheir crossing the swamp, I ordered my detachment to file off to the\r\nleft and take post in a wood upon the left of the brigade.\"[137]\r\nGeneral Parsons says: \"We took possession of a hill about two miles\r\nfrom camp, and detached Colonel Atlee to meet them further on the\r\nroad; in about sixty rods he drew up and received the enemy's fire and\r\ngave them a well-directed fire from his regiment, which did great\r\nexecution, and then retreated to the hill.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Atlee's Journal._ _Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p.\r\n1251.]\r\n\r\nThis advantageous site, where Stirling had now drawn up his brigade to\r\ndispute Grant's progress, was the crest of the slope which rose\r\nnortherly from the marsh and low ground around \"Blockje's Bergh,\" and\r\nwhich to-day is represented by about the line of Twentieth\r\nStreet.[138] Here was an elevation or ridge favorable for defence,\r\nand here Stirling proposed to make a stand. On the right, next to the\r\nroad, he posted Smallwood's battalion, under Major Gist; further along\r\nup the hillside were the Delawares, under Major MacDonough;[139] and\r\non their left, in the woods above, Atlee's men formed after falling\r\nback from their attempt to stop the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Probably the earliest of modern attempts to identify\r\nthe site where Stirling formed his line was that made in 1839 by Maj.\r\nD.B. Douglass, formerly of the United States Army. Greenwood Cemetery,\r\nsays Mr. Cleveland in his history of _Greenwood_, owes its present\r\nbeautiful appearance largely to this officer's \"energy and taste,\"\r\nDouglass having been one of the first surveyors of the ground. He\r\nlocated Stirling's position on what was then known as Wyckoff's hill,\r\nbetween Eighteenth and Twentieth streets; and tradition and all the\r\noriginal documents confirm this selection. This was a lower elevation\r\nin the general slope from the main ridge towards the bay. Stirling\r\nsimply drew his men up in a straight line from the road towards the\r\nhill-tops, and beyond him on the same line or more in advance, was\r\nParsons. The map in Sparks' _Washington_ putting Stirling down near\r\nthe Narrows is erroneous.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: The colonels and lieutenant-colonels of both these\r\nregiments were detained at New York as members of the court-martial\r\nwhich tried Lieutenant-colonel Zedwitz, of MacDougall's regiment,\r\ncharged with treasonable correspondence with the enemy. They joined\r\ntheir regiments after the battle.]\r\n\r\nWhen Kachlein's[140] riflemen came up, the general stationed part of\r\nthem along hedges near the foot of the hill in front of the\r\nMarylanders, and part in front of the woods near Atlee. The line had\r\nhardly been formed before it was observed that the enemy threatened to\r\noverlap it on the left, and Parsons was accordingly ordered to take\r\nAtlee's and Huntington's regiments and move still further into the\r\nwoods to defeat the designs on that flank.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: This name appears in other accounts as Kichline or\r\nKeichline. It is properly Kachlein, being so spelled by other members\r\nof this officer's family.]\r\n\r\nFinding Stirling thus thrown across their path, the British also drew\r\nup in line and disposed their force as if intending to attack him at\r\nonce. About opposite to the Marylanders, possibly on Blockje's Bergh,\r\nGrant posted the sixth brigade in two lines, while the fourth brigade\r\nwas extended in a single line from the low ground to the top of the\r\nhills in Greenwood Cemetery.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a regular battle formation--Grant and Stirling\r\nopposing each other--and we may regard it with interest not only as\r\nthe only line of battle preserved, on the American side at least,\r\nduring this day's struggle, but as being the first instance in the\r\nRevolution where we met the British in the open field. Before this it\r\nhad been fighting under different conditions--the regulars mowed down\r\nat Bunker Hill, Montgomery attempting to storm Quebec, or Moultrie\r\nbravely holding a fort against a fleet; now the soldiers on either\r\nside stood face to face, and the opportunity seemed at hand to fairly\r\ntest their native courage. Greatly disproportionate, however, was the\r\nstrength of these two lines. Stirling's, all told, contained not more\r\nthan sixteen hundred men; while Grant's, which besides the two\r\nbrigades included the Forty-second Highlanders and two companies of\r\nAmerican loyalists, was little less than seven thousand strong. But if\r\nwe find here a threatening attitude, let us not expect any desperate\r\nfighting. It was not Grant's object to bring on an engagement at this\r\nearly hour, now seven o'clock in the morning, for he wished to keep\r\nStirling where he was until the other movements of the day were\r\ndeveloped. He contented himself with appearing to be on the point of\r\nattack, and Stirling could do no more than prepare for a stubborn\r\ndefence of his ground.\r\n\r\nThe first move of the British was to send forward a small body of\r\nlight troops from their left, which advanced to within one hundred and\r\nfifty yards of Stirling's right. This would bring them not far from\r\nthe little bridge on the road, where, from behind hedges and\r\napple-trees, they opened fire on our advanced riflemen, who replied\r\nwith spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Stirling was reinforced by a two-gun battery from\r\nKnox's artillery, under Captain-Lieutenant Benajah Carpenter, of\r\nProvidence, R.I., which was at once placed on the hillside to command\r\nthe road, and, according to Stirling, \"the only approach for some\r\nhundred yards,\" which must have been that part of the road running\r\nover the bridge. The skirmishing was kept up at a lively rate for\r\nabout two hours, and occasionally, it would appear, our entire line\r\nengaged in the fire. Of the particular incidents which occurred at\r\nthis point we have almost nothing; but perhaps, from one or two mere\r\nreferences that have been preserved, the whole scene can be imagined.\r\n\"The enemy,\" writes one of the Maryland soldiers, \"advanced towards\r\nus, upon which Lord Stirling, who commanded, drew up in a line and\r\noffered them battle in true English taste. The British then advanced\r\nwithin about 200 yards of us, and began a heavy fire from their cannon\r\nand mortars, for both the Balls and Shells flew very fast, now and\r\nthen taking off a head. Our men stood it amazingly well; not even one\r\nof them shewed a Disposition to shrink. Our orders were not to fire\r\nuntil the Enemy came within fifty yards of us, but when they perceived\r\nwe stood their fire so cooly and resolutely they declined coming any\r\nnearer, altho' treble our number.\"[141] Colonel Haslet, although not\r\nwith his regiment, reported to his friend Cæsar Rodney that \"the\r\nDelawares drew up on the side of a hill, and stood upwards of four\r\nhours, with a firm, determined countenance, in close array, their\r\ncolors flying, the enemy's artillery playing on them all the while,\r\nnot daring to advance and attack them;\"[142] and his ensign, Stephens,\r\npointed with pride to the standard \"torn with shot\" while held in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _Extracts from the Stiles Diary_ in vol. ii., p. 488,\r\nof the Long Island Historical Society's _Memoirs_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: _Haslet to Rodney._ _Force_, 5th Series, vol. ii., p.\r\n881.]\r\n\r\nGalled perhaps by the fire of Carpenter's battery, the British light\r\ntroops retired to their main line, and the firing from this time was\r\ncontinued chiefly by the artillery. On their left they advanced one\r\nhowitzer to within three hundred yards of Stirling's right, and in\r\nfront of his left they opened with another piece at a distance of six\r\nhundred yards, and until about eleven o'clock the cannonading was\r\nvigorously sustained. Here was an engagement begun, and for four hours\r\nStirling's men were encouraged with the belief that they were holding\r\nback the invaders. Their general inspired them with his own resolution\r\nand bravery, both by word and example; and their good conduct in this\r\ntheir first experience under fire, exposed without cover to cannon and\r\nmusket shot, indicated that Grant could not have pushed them back\r\nwithout suffering severely. The casualties had not been large, but the\r\nnerves of the men were none the less tested by the ordeal. Among the\r\nMarylanders, Captain Edward Veazey, who commanded one of the\r\nindependent companies, doing duty with Smallwood's regiment, fell\r\n\"early in the engagement;\" and either here, or on the retreat at a\r\nlater hour, also fell Captain Carpenter, whose battery had been doing\r\ngood work on Stirling's line. Of the Delawares, Major MacDonough and\r\nLieutenants Anderson and Course were slightly wounded. Accounts agree\r\nthat few of the men in either Smallwood's, Haslet's, or Kachlein's\r\nbattalions were killed or wounded while holding this position.\r\n\r\nThe three regiments immediately under Stirling thus not only appeared\r\nto be doing well, but had actually proved themselves the best of\r\nsoldiers, both by keeping an unwavering line when the British light\r\ntroops advanced, as if to be followed by the main column, and in\r\nmaintaining their ranks and discipline when subjected to the\r\nsubsequent fire of the artillery.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only men who did themselves credit. That little\r\nparty composed of Atlee's and Huntington's battalions, under General\r\nParsons, which had gone into the woods to protect Stirling's left,\r\nmust not be forgotten. Our published accounts heretofore fail to\r\nparticularize the service it did; but it was of no small account, as\r\nParson's and Atlee's independent testimony and the returns of the\r\nBritish losses clearly show. The party, not much over three hundred\r\nstrong, filed off to the left, and soon came in sight of \"a hill of\r\nclear ground\" about three hundred yards distant, which was judged to\r\nbe the proper situation from which to watch the enemy.[143] The\r\ndirection Parsons' men took, the distances mentioned, and the fact\r\nthat tradition associates the site with part of the fighting on that\r\nday, can leave no doubt but that the hill referred to here was one of\r\nthe two or three distinct elevations in the north-western section of\r\nGreenwood Cemetery, and to one of which has since been given the\r\ncommemorative title of \"Battle Hill.\" A spot fitly named, for around\r\nit some brave work was done! As the detachment neared the hill, the\r\nBritish flanking troops were also observed to be marching to seize it.\r\nAtlee seeing this hurried his men to reach it first, but the enemy\r\nwere there before him and poured a volley into his battalion.\r\nFortunately, not being well aimed, this did trifling damage, but under\r\nthe shock a part of his men, with two companies from the Delaware\r\nregiment, which had been ordered to join them, wavered. Rallying the\r\nmost of them, Atlee soon ordered an advance up the hill, telling the\r\nmen at the same time \"to preserve their fire and aim aright;\" and they\r\nall pushed forward with so much resolution, and apparently with such\r\nan effective discharge of their pieces, that the enemy fell back,\r\nleaving behind them twelve killed and a lieutenant and four privates\r\nwounded. In this encounter Atlee lost his \"worthy friend\" and\r\nlieutenant-colonel, Caleb Parry, who fell dead upon the field without\r\na groan, while cheering on the battalion. Ordering four soldiers to\r\ntake the remains of \"the hero\" back into the Brooklyn lines, Atlee\r\nhalted his \"brave fellows\" on the hill, and all Parsons' command here\r\ntook post to await the further movements of the British on this flank.\r\nThe force they had met and repulsed consisted of the Twenty-third and\r\nForty-fourth and a part of the Seventeenth regiments, by whom they\r\nwere soon to be attacked again. In half an hour after the first affair\r\nthe enemy formed for another effort to seize the hill, but again\r\nAtlee's and Huntington's men opened upon them, and for a second time\r\ncompelled their retreat, with the loss of Lieutenant-Colonel Grant, a\r\nbrave and valued field-officer of the Fortieth Regiment, whose fall\r\ngave ground for the report, credited for some days after in the\r\nAmerican army, that Major-General Grant, the division commander, was\r\namong the enemy's killed in the battle of Long Island. Parsons' men by\r\nthis time had fired away all their ammunition (Atlee says that his\r\nbattalion, at least, had entirely emptied their cartridge-boxes), and\r\nhad used what charges could be got from the enemy's dead and wounded,\r\nwhen Huntington's ammunition cart \"very luckily\" came on the ground,\r\nand the men were re-supplied for still a third attack, which was\r\nthreatened with the assistance of the Forty-second Highlanders; but\r\nthe British this time kept a safe distance, and Parsons and Atlee\r\nremained on the hill, where they collected the enemy's dead and placed\r\ntheir wounded under the shelter of the trees. Thus bravely and\r\neffectively had this small body of Americans protected Stirling's\r\nflank and dealt the enemy the severest blows they suffered at any one\r\npoint during the day, and this, as in the case of Stirling's men, with\r\nbut small loss to themselves. From behind fences and trees, and, if\r\ntradition is correct, from the tops of trees as well, and from open\r\nground on the hill, they kept up their destructive fire and\r\nsuccessfully accomplished what they had been called upon to do.[144]\r\nThat the British did not intend at this hour to drive Parsons and\r\nAtlee from their post is no detraction from the spirited fight made by\r\nthese officers and their men, who knew nothing of the enemy's\r\nintentions, and who actually won the field from the troops they met.\r\nAll along this front, from Stirling holding the road on the right to\r\nParsons holding the left, with a long gap between them, the fighting\r\nthus far had resulted most favorably to the American side. The main\r\nline, as already stated, had lost not more than two officers killed\r\nand three or four wounded, with a small number of men; while Parsons\r\nand Atlee both report that in addition to the death of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nParry they lost only one or two men wounded. But, on the part of the\r\nBritish, Grant's two brigades, with the Forty-second Highlanders and\r\nthe two companies of New York loyalists, lost, according to Howe's\r\nofficial report, two officers killed and four wounded, and among the\r\nmen twenty-five killed and ninety-nine wounded. The four regiments\r\nalone which at different times encountered Parsons--the Seventeenth,\r\nTwenty-third, Forty-fourth, and Forty-second--lost in the aggregate\r\neighty-six officers and men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: _Atlee's Journal._ _Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p.\r\n1251.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Parsons' reference to this affair at or near \"Battle\r\nHill\" in Greenwood is as follows: \"I was ordered with Col. Atlee and\r\npart of his Reg't, and Lt. Col. Clark with Col. Huntington's Reg't to\r\ncover the left flank of our main body. This we executed though our\r\nnumber did at no time exceed 300 men and we were attacked three\r\nseveral times by two regiments, ye 44th and 23d and repulsed\r\nthem in every attack with considerable loss. The number of dead we had\r\ncollected together and the heap the enemy had made we supposed\r\namounted to about 60. We had 12 or 14 wounded prisoners who we caused\r\nto be dressed and their wounds put in the best state our situation\r\nwould admit.\"--_Document_ 5.\r\n\r\nSee Colonel Atlee's journal in _Force's Archives_ for a full account\r\nof the part his battalion took in this fighting.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile, now, Stirling and Parsons seemed to be effectually blocking the\r\nadvance of the British by the lower road and the Greenwood hills, what\r\nwas the situation at the other passes?\r\n\r\nUp to eight o'clock, some five hours after Grant's appearance at the\r\nRed Lion, no determined attack had been reported from either the\r\nFlatbush or Bedford roads. The Hessians had made some show of\r\nadvancing from Flatbush at an early hour, but they had not as yet\r\ndriven in our pickets, although approaching near enough for the guns\r\nat the breastwork on the road to fire upon them. No word had come from\r\nMiles; nothing had been heard from the patrol of officers at the\r\nJamaica Pass. Whatever tactics the enemy were pursuing, it was evident\r\nthat at this hour they had not developed indications of a simultaneous\r\nadvance \"all along the line.\" Were they making their principal push\r\nagainst Stirling? Were they waiting for the fleet to work its way up\r\nto co-operate? or would they still attempt to force the passes and the\r\nhills at all points and overcome the American outguards by sheer\r\nweight of numbers? Whatever theory our generals may have entertained\r\nat this time as to the intentions of the British--a point which we\r\nhave no means of determining--it is certain that at about half-past\r\neight or nine o'clock Major-General Sullivan rode out from the\r\nBrooklyn lines to the Flatbush Pass, with the evident purpose of\r\nexamining the situation at that and other points, and of obtaining the\r\nlatest information respecting the enemy's movements. We have this\r\nsubstantially from his own pen: \"I went,\" he says, \"to the hill near\r\nFlatbush to reconnoitre the enemy.\"[145] Nothing more natural, and\r\nnothing more necessary; the situation at that hour required that some\r\nresponsible general officer should be in this vicinity to direct the\r\ndisposition of the troops the moment the enemy uncovered their plan.\r\nStirling on the lower road had his hands full, and it became some\r\none's duty to see that he was not put in danger by any possible mishap\r\nelsewhere on the hills. Sullivan, therefore, the second in command,\r\nwent out to \"examine\" and to \"reconnoitre.\" He had been out the\r\nevening before, making the rounds with Putnam; to him Miles had\r\nreported the situation of affairs on the extreme left; and it was by\r\nhis general orders that the last detail of guards had been made for\r\neach of the passes. He was accordingly familiar with the plan of the\r\nouter defence, and upon reaching the Flatbush Pass, where, as Miles\r\nstates, he took his station at the redoubt or barricade on the road,\r\nhe seems to have given certain directions on the strength of the\r\ninformation he had obtained. If we may credit the writer of one of the\r\nletters published at the time, the general was told that the main\r\nbody of the enemy were advancing by the lower road, \"whereupon he\r\nordered another battalion to the assistance of Lord Stirling, keeping\r\n800 men to guard the pass.\"[146] It is not difficult to accept this as\r\na correct statement of what actually occurred, because it is what we\r\nshould expect would have taken place under the circumstances. That\r\nSullivan took out any additional troops with him when he went to the\r\npass does not appear, but doubtless some were sent there. But as to\r\nthis Flatbush Pass, the most that can be said with any degree of\r\ncertainty is, that at about nine o'clock in the morning the Hessians\r\nstill remained comparatively quiet at the foot of the hills below;\r\nthat our guards and pickets stood at their different posts, not in\r\nregular line, but detached on either side of the road, the commander\r\nof each party governing himself as necessity required; that they were\r\nexpected to hold that point stubbornly, if for no other purpose now\r\nthan to secure Stirling's line of retreat; and that if attacked they\r\nwere to be reinforced. At the hour Sullivan reached the pass the\r\nsituation at all points appeared to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Most of our writers are led into the error of supposing\r\nthat Sullivan was already at the Flatbush Pass, and that when he went\r\nto reconnoitre he started from this point. The general says: \"I went\r\nto the Hill near Flatbush to reconnoitre the enemy, and with a picket\r\nof four hundred men was surrounded by the enemy,\" etc. He went to the\r\nhill--where from? The main camp, necessarily. We already had our\r\npickets well out in front, and had Sullivan gone beyond these he would\r\nhave come upon the Hessians. Besides his position fully overlooked\r\nFlatbush, and no reconnoissance was necessary. Miles states that the\r\ngeneral remained at the redoubt. The quotation above means no more\r\nthan that Sullivan went out from the Brooklyn lines, and afterwards\r\nwas surrounded and fought with four hundred of the guard who were\r\nthere at the Pass with him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _Document_ 19.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut little did the Americans suspect that at the very moment their\r\ndefence seemed well arranged and their outguards vigilant they were\r\nalready in the web which the enemy had been silently weaving around\r\nthem during the night. That flanking column! Skilfully had it played\r\nits part in the British plans, and with crushing weight was it now to\r\nfall upon our outpost guards, who felt themselves secure along the\r\nhills and in the woods. Cross again into the opposite camp and follow\r\nthe approach of this unlooked-for danger. First, Lord Howe withdrew\r\nCornwallis from Flatbush to Flatlands towards evening on the 26th,\r\nand at nine o'clock at night set this flanking corps in motion. Sir\r\nHenry Clinton commanded the van, which consisted of the light dragoons\r\nand the brigade of light infantry. Cornwallis and the reserve\r\nimmediately followed; and after him marched the First Brigade and the\r\nSeventy-first Regiment, with fourteen pieces of field artillery. These\r\ntroops formed the advance corps, and were followed at a proper\r\ninterval by Lord Percy and Howe himself, with the Second, Third, and\r\nFifth brigades, the guards, and ten guns. The Forty-ninth Regiment,\r\nwith four twelve-pounders, and the baggage with a separate guard,\r\nbrought up the rear. All told, this column was hardly less than ten\r\nthousand strong. With three Flatbush Tories acting as guides, it took\r\nup the march and headed, as Howe reports, \"across the country through\r\nthe new lots\" towards the Jamaica Pass, moving slowly and cautiously\r\nalong the road from Flatlands until it reached Shoemaker's Bridge,\r\nwhich crossed a creek emptying into Jamaica Bay, when the column\r\nstruck over the fields to the Jamaica Road, where it came to a halt in\r\nthe open lots a short distance south-east of the pass, and directly in\r\nfront of Howard's Halfway House.[147]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Consult map of the battle-field, Part II.]\r\n\r\nHere now occurred one of those incidents which, though insignificant\r\nin themselves, sometimes become fatalities that turn the scale of\r\nbattle. The five American officers whom General Sullivan had sent out\r\nthe evening before to patrol this pass had stationed themselves at\r\nthis time, now between two and three o'clock on the morning of the\r\n27th, a short distance east of Howard's house, apparently waiting for\r\nsounds of the enemy on the line of the road. Evidently they had no\r\nthought of his approach \"across lots\" from the direction of Flatlands,\r\nor they could not have left the pass unwatched by one or more of the\r\nparty. For most of them, this was the first tour of military duty of\r\nso responsible a nature, and whatever mistakes they made may be\r\nreferred to their inexperience or ignorance of the relative situation\r\nof the roads in that vicinity. Who had charge of the party does not\r\nappear. So far as known, only one of them, Lieutenant Van Wagenen, had\r\nseen any considerable service; but although something of a veteran,\r\nhaving entered the army in 1775 and charged with Montgomery upon\r\nQuebec, he could have known nothing of the country he was now\r\npatrolling. Lieutenants Troup and Dunscomb were young Columbia College\r\ngraduates of two years' standing, who had eagerly taken up the cause\r\nof the colonists in the midst of adverse associations. Gilliland may\r\nhave once been an officer in McDougall's regiment, and Hoogland was\r\nadjutant of Colonel Lasher's battalion. Had these officers, who\r\nwithout doubt were all mounted, been patrolling at the pass or nearer\r\nthe lines, the events of the 27th might have worn a far different\r\naspect. As it was, the British by coming into the road at Howard's had\r\nput themselves in the rear of the patrol, and its capture was quickly\r\neffected. Captain William Glanville Evelyn, \"a gallant officer\" of the\r\nFourth Infantry, or King's Own, and a descendant of the eminent John\r\nEvelyn, of England, led the British advance this night, and it fell to\r\nhis fortune to surround and capture all five American officers and\r\nsend them immediately to Clinton, who commanded the leading column.\r\nHere was a blow inflicted upon us by the British, the real importance\r\nof which they themselves even were ignorant of, for they had made\r\nprisoners of the only patrol that was watching the Jamaica route from\r\nthe pass down to the very lines themselves!\r\n\r\nClinton \"interrogated\" the prisoners upon the spot, and ascertained\r\nfrom them that the pass had not been occupied by the Americans. He\r\nthen attempted to obtain information of the position at Brooklyn and\r\nthe number of troops now there, by pressing the officers with\r\nquestions, when Dunscomb, indignant at the advantage he was taking of\r\ntheir situation, replied to Clinton that \"under other circumstances he\r\nwould not dare insult them in that manner.\" For this the young\r\nlieutenant was called \"an impudent rebel,\" and the British officers\r\nthreatened to have him hanged. Dunscomb's courage was equal to the\r\noccasion, and, scouting the threat, declared that Washington would\r\nhang man for man in return, and that as for himself he should give\r\nClinton no further information. But stoutly as Dunscomb and his\r\nfellows maintained their rights and honor as prisoners, their capture\r\nwas one of the fatal turns that brought misfortune to the American\r\narmy.[148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Hardly one of our modern accounts refers to this patrol\r\nor its capture. The incident, however, affected the situation gravely.\r\nHowe mentions it in his report as follows: \"General Clinton being\r\narrived within half a mile of the pass about two hours before\r\ndaybreak, halted, and settled his disposition for the attack. One of\r\nhis patrols falling in with a patrol of the enemy's officers took\r\nthem; and the General learning from their information that the Rebels\r\nhad not occupied the pass, detached a battalion of Light Infantry to\r\nsecure it.\" Gordon says this: \"One of his [Clinton's] patrols falls in\r\nwith a patrol of American officers on horseback, who are trepanned and\r\nmade prisoners.\" The letter in the _South Carolina Gazette_\r\n(_Document_ 19) is to similar effect: \"Five officers were also sent\r\nout on horseback to patrol the last-mentioned road and that leading to\r\nJamaica, ... and were all made prisoners.\" Still stronger is the\r\ntestimony of a letter to be found in the _Autobiography and\r\nCorrespondence of Mary Granville, Mrs. Delany, with Interesting\r\nReminiscences of George III. and Queen Charlotte, &c., London, 1862_.\r\n\"The Hon. Mrs. Boscawen to Mrs. Delany.--_Glan Villa_, 17th Oct.\r\n1776.... To compleat the prosperity of my journey I found on my return\r\nto ye inn the most delightful news of our success on Long Island so\r\nthat I had a most agreeable supper and drank health to the noble\r\nbrothers [the two Howes]. We have had a letter from Capt. Evelyn from\r\nthe field of battle; he was in ye brigade of light infantry, and\r\ntook 5 officers prisoners who were sent to observe our motions. He\r\nmentions Dr. Boscawen's son being well, for whom we were in great\r\ncare, being the only child. O! to compleat this by good news from N.\r\nYork and then peace!\" We know who these officers were from several\r\nsources, the most authoritative and important being the documents left\r\nby one of the party himself, Lieutenant Van Wagenen, and now in the\r\npossession of his grandson, Mr. Gerret H. Van Wagenen, of Brooklyn.\r\nThis officer had been sent down to Philadelphia in charge of prisoners\r\nfrom Canada. At this point his deposition states that \"on his return\r\nto New York he found the enemy landing upon Long Island, and being a\r\nsupernumerary he went to Long Island and offered his services to Gen'l\r\nSullivan, who requested him, and four other officers, namely, Robert\r\nTroup, Edward Dunscomb, William Guilderland and Jeromus Hooghland, to\r\ngo and reconnoitre the enemy, who were observed to be in motion, and\r\nin the various advances on the enemy, fell in with a body of horse and\r\ninfantry by whom he and his little party were made prisoners, and\r\ncontinued a Prisoner for about twenty-two months.\" Respecting the\r\nquestioning of the officers by Clinton, there is good authority.\r\nLieutenants Troup and Dunscomb, who afterwards rose to the rank of\r\nLieutenant-colonel and Captain respectively, have daughters still\r\nliving in New York, and from their own recollections and from papers\r\nin their possession, the account given in the text is collated. At the\r\ntime of Captain Dunscomb's death one or more letters were published by\r\nfriends who had the particulars of the incident directly from him.\r\n(See biographical sketches of these officers, Part II.) The sending\r\nout of officers on such duty as was required this night, was not\r\nunusual. The British scouts who preceded the expedition to Lexington\r\nin 1775 were officers in disguise. Similar instances during the war\r\ncould be recalled as at Brandywine. Mr. Henry Onderdonk, Jr., of\r\nJamaica, states, in his carefully compiled and valuable collection of\r\n_Revolutionary Incidents on Long Island_, that the patrol was captured\r\nunder a tree east of Howard's House.]\r\n\r\nUpon learning that the pass was unguarded, Clinton, as Howe reports,\r\nordered one of the light infantry battalions to occupy it, and soon\r\nafter the main column followed. It would appear, however, that he\r\nstill moved cautiously, and that the battalion, or the troops that\r\nfollowed, avoided a direct approach, and reached the Jamaica Road on\r\nthe other side of the pass by a roundabout lane known as the Rockaway\r\nPath. The innkeeper Howard was waked up, and with his son compelled\r\nto guide the British around to the road, where it was discovered, as\r\nthe patrol had stated, that the pass was unguarded. When the whole\r\nforce had marched through to the other side it was halted for a brief\r\n\"rest and refreshment,\" and then continued down the road to Bedford,\r\nwhere the van, consisting of dragoons and light infantry, arrived\r\nabout half-past eight o'clock in the morning. So this flanking corps\r\nhad succeeded in making a slow, difficult, and circuitous march of\r\nsome nine miles from Flatlands during the night, and had placed itself\r\ndirectly in the rear of the left of the American outposts, before its\r\napproach was known in the Brooklyn camp. It was now nearer the lines\r\nthan were our picket guards at either of the outposts on the hills,\r\nand by a swift advance down the Jamaica Road and along the Gowanus\r\nRoad to its intersection with the Port Road, it could have interposed\r\nitself across every avenue of retreat from the hills to the lines. It\r\nwas Howe's plan to cut off the American retreat entirely, but while\r\nsuccessful in reaching our rear he fortunately failed to reap the\r\nfullest advantage of his move. The loss he was now able to inflict\r\nupon us was hardly a third of what might have been possible. But for\r\nthe Americans it was more than enough. From this point followed trial\r\nand disaster. The day, which had opened so promisingly on the lower\r\nroad, had already, at early dawn, been lost to them at the Jamaica\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nWhat next happened after the British reached Bedford? What, in the\r\nfirst place, had Miles been about in the woods on the extreme left\r\nthat the enemy should gain his rear before he knew it? Fortunately we\r\nhave the colonel himself and his lieutenant-colonel, Brodhead, to tell\r\nus much if they do not explain all. Miles then puts it on record that,\r\non the day before the engagement, General Sullivan came to his camp,\r\nto whom he reported his belief that when the enemy moved they would\r\nfall into the Jamaica Road, and he hoped there were troops there to\r\nwatch them. On the following morning, at about seven o'clock, firing\r\nbegan at the redoubt on the Flatbush Road, and he immediately marched\r\nin that direction, but was stopped by Colonel Wyllys at the Bedford\r\nPass, who informed him that he could not pass on, as they were to\r\ndefend the Bedford Road. \"Colonel Wyllys bearing a Continental, and I\r\na State commission,\" says Miles, \"he was considered a senior officer,\r\nand I was obliged to submit; but I told him I was convinced the main\r\nbody of the enemy would take the Jamaica Road, that there was no\r\nprobability of their coming along the road he was then guarding, and\r\nif he would not let me proceed to where the firing was, I would return\r\nand endeavor to get into the Jamaica Road before General Howe. To this\r\nhe consented, and I immediately made a retrograde march, and after\r\nmarching nearly two miles, the whole distance through woods, I arrived\r\nwithin sight of the Jamaica Road, and to my great mortification I saw\r\nthe main body of the enemy in full march between me and our lines, and\r\nthe baggage guard just coming into the road.\"\r\n\r\nHad Miles been surprised? This is one of the problems of the battle.\r\nFor four days he had been on the watch on this flank, and now the\r\nBritish were in his rear! Would he have made that \"retrograde\" march\r\nthis morning, when the strictest attention to one's particular orders\r\nwas necessary, unless he had known that there were no troops on the\r\nJamaica Road, and unless it was a part of his duty to reconnoitre in\r\nthat direction? But he was now making a stout effort to find and fight\r\nHowe, and before charging him with a blunder let us follow the battle\r\nto its close.\r\n\r\nOne of Miles' soldiers hurried into camp and reported to Putnam that\r\ninfantry and cavalry were marching down from the Jamaica Pass;[149]\r\nbut all too late, for right upon the heels of the information came the\r\nenemy! They pushed down the road from Bedford, and across the country,\r\nto attack the American outguards in the rear, while the Hessians were\r\nto come up in front. So, if we glance over the field again at about\r\nhalf-past nine or ten o'clock on this eventful morning, we find the\r\nwhole aspect changed, and our entire force on the hills apparently\r\ncaught in a trap. Stirling was still facing Grant upon the right, but\r\nhis rear was in danger; while Sullivan and the picket guards at the\r\nother passes were wedged in between the two powerful columns under\r\nHowe and De Heister. What now was done? Who escaped?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: _Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p. 1195.]\r\n\r\nEvidently Miles, way out in the woods on the left, had the least\r\nprospect of getting back to the Brooklyn lines. When he found the\r\nBritish on the road between him and camp he first proposed to attack\r\ntheir baggage guard and cut his way through to the Sound, but on\r\nconsulting his officers (his first battalion alone being with him) he\r\nturned about, determined to attempt a retreat to camp. It was\r\nimpossible for him to succeed, for he had a march of full three miles\r\nto make; and after encountering the enemy once or twice in the woods,\r\nhe, with many of his men, was compelled to surrender. Brodhead, while\r\nmarching through the woods in Indian file to join him, was also\r\nattacked and his men dispersed, though most of them, with the\r\nlieutenant-colonel himself, escaped to the lines. The rout was\r\nspeedily communicated to the guards at the two remaining points. At\r\nthe Bedford Pass the detachments under Colonel Wyllys and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Wills appear to have realized their danger about\r\nthe time the British reached Bedford village. Finding Miles' troops\r\nbroken up and flying, they too, through fear of being intercepted,\r\ntook up the retreat. Finally, at the Flatbush Pass--the last point in\r\nthe outpost line to be attacked--the peril was still greater, for now\r\nthe Hessians were moving up in front. Here, as we have seen, General\r\nSullivan had just arrived to examine the situation. He had not long to\r\nwait, however, before the nature of that situation fully dawned upon\r\nhim and the troops at the pass. While watching the Hessians at\r\nFlatbush they suddenly hear the rattle of musketry on the left of\r\ntheir rear, where British light infantry and dragoons are beginning to\r\nchase and fire upon Miles, Brodhead, and Wyllys, and their broken\r\ndetachments. The Flatbush Pass was a point to be held, for it was the\r\ncentre of the outpost line, and retreat therefrom would endanger\r\nStirling; but Sullivan and his men must act promptly if they would do\r\nno more even than save themselves, for the enemy by this time are much\r\nnearer the Brooklyn lines than they. Just what occurred at this\r\njuncture the records fail to tell us clearly. Did Sullivan, as one\r\nletter states, immediately send word to Stirling to retreat?[150]\r\nThis would have been the first and natural step. Whoever the\r\ncommanding officer might be at the Flatbush Pass, it was for him to\r\nwatch the situation at the outpost line and give orders to the right\r\nand left. All depended on what was done at that pass. If the guards\r\nthere gave way all the others must give way instantly. Whether the\r\nword, therefore, reached Stirling or not, we must believe that\r\nSullivan sent it, as he ought to have done, and is reported to have\r\ndone. As for the general himself and his party, retreat was the only\r\nalternative. Leaving the advanced pickets to fall back before the\r\nHessians, they turned towards the British in their rear. Very soon\r\nthey encountered the light infantry and dragoons, who were now\r\nengaging in the attack with the highest dash and spirit. Reinforced by\r\nfour companies of the guards, the latter captured three pieces of our\r\nartillery--the same, doubtless, which had just been playing upon the\r\nHessians, but were now turned, in the retreat, upon the British--and\r\nwhich our gunners defended \"heroically\" to the last. Sullivan and his\r\nmen fought well, and apparently in separate parties, until nearly all\r\nthat had been stationed at the Flatbush Pass succeeded in breaking or\r\nmaking their way through to the lines.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: The supposition that Stirling commanded outside of the\r\nlines on Long Island is erroneous. He had command of the reserves in\r\ncamp (Orders of August 25th), and was the proper officer to call upon\r\nto reinforce any part of the outer line in case of attack. Sullivan\r\nsays, \"Lord Stirling commanded the main body without the lines;\" by\r\nwhich is meant that he was with the principal force that went out, as\r\nhe was. Until the attack, the general officer of the day was in charge\r\nof the outposts. Sullivan governed himself according to circumstances.\r\nHe was to be second in command under Putnam within the lines, he\r\nwrites; but the situation soon required his presence outside, where he\r\nwas also familiar with the dispositions.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Hessians appeared. They came up from the Flatbush plains\r\nwith drums beating and colors flying. Donop's grenadiers and yagers\r\nled, and immediately after them followed the veteran De Heister at the\r\nhead of the brigades. Reaching the summit of the ridge, they deployed\r\ntheir lines, and putting their sharpshooters in advance, moved rapidly\r\nupon the position which our Flatbush Pass guard had just abandoned.\r\nThey met with little opposition, for they had nothing before them but\r\nour scattered pickets. Soon, however, they fell in with the\r\nretreating groups which the British had cut off from the lines and had\r\npushed back into the hills, and upon these they fell fiercely, and in\r\nmany instances cruelly. Where they found a rifleman resisting too\r\nlong, they pinned him with their bayonets, and to some of the wounded\r\nthey showed no mercy. Most of the prisoners fell into their hands, for\r\nthe reason that they had been driven towards the Hessians by the\r\nBritish; but otherwise the day afforded no opportunity for fair\r\nfighting between these \"foreigners\" and our troops.[151]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The Hessians are usually credited with taking a\r\nprominent part in this battle, whereas the day was practically decided\r\nbefore they came up. Necessarily our guards at the Flatbush Pass knew\r\nthat the British were in their rear as soon or sooner than the\r\nHessians knew it. They therefore turned to meet this unexpected enemy.\r\nWhat Olney and Henshaw say settles this point. Olney states that\r\nCornell marched towards the lines on hearing firing in his rear,\r\nleaving Olney to reinforce his pickets in front of the Hessians.\r\nHenshaw writes that, finding the enemy between him and the lines, and\r\nknowing no orders could come to retreat, he marched for camp. Cornell\r\nand Henshaw were old officers, knew the ground thoroughly, and saw at\r\nonce that they must retreat. No mention is made of the Hessians.\r\nLieutenant Olney was in front of the latter some time before he\r\nfollowed after his regiment. Howe reports that it was the _British_\r\nwho took our guns in that part of the field. If there was any such\r\nsevere fighting at that pass, as Von Elking makes out, would the\r\nHessians have lost but two men killed--all that they lost during the\r\nday? There are errors of fact in this writer's account. The most that\r\nthe Hessians did was to chase, capture, and sometimes bayonet those of\r\nour soldiers whom the British had already routed. The real fighting of\r\nthe day was done by Howe's English troops, and the very best he had,\r\nprincipally the light infantry, grenadiers, dragoons, and\r\nHighlanders.]\r\n\r\nThus all along the hills, from the Flatbush Pass to the extreme left,\r\nour outer guards were in full retreat! It was a flight and fight to\r\nreach the Brooklyn lines! Ten o'clock--and Miles, Brodhead, Wyllys,\r\nWills, Johnston, Henshaw, and Cornell, with two thousand men, were\r\nhurrying through the woods, down the slopes and across the fields,\r\nsome singly, some in groups, some keeping together in companies, some\r\nin battalions, all aiming for one objective--the camp! Here they\r\nfought the light infantry; there they were charged upon by the\r\ndragoons; those who were intercepted fell into the hands or upon the\r\nbayonets of the Hessians. It was a trying and desperate situation from\r\nwhich there was no relief and for a long time the woods echoed with\r\nthe shouts and cries of the contending parties. But upon the whole the\r\nloss to the Americans up to this time was not heavy, and could\r\nStirling have been saved, the enemy would have had no great victory to\r\nboast of. Full half of Miles' two battalions reached the lines;\r\nWyllys' and Chester's suffered but slightly; Henshaw and Cornell\r\nbrought their men in without much loss, and in comparatively good\r\norder; the greatest blow to the Jerseymen was the death of their brave\r\ncolonel, Johnston, their casualties otherwise being light; and\r\nKnowlton's hundred rangers just saved themselves from the dragoons,\r\n\"with the utmost difficulty and on the full run.\" The artillerymen\r\nsuffered more. General Sullivan himself, after showing good courage\r\nand avoiding capture until noon, endeavored to conceal himself, but\r\nwas found and made prisoner by three Hessian grenadiers.[152]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: During this fighting by the British infantry,\r\nCornwallis and the reserves moved straight down the Jamaica Road. The\r\nThirty-third Regiment and the grenadiers in their pursuit of some of\r\nthe American fugitives approached the fortified lines between Fort\r\nGreene and Fort Putnam, and showed such eagerness to storm them that,\r\naccording to Howe's report, it required repeated orders to hold them\r\nback. On the part of the Americans, Little reports that the enemy\r\n\"attempted to force our lines, but soon retreated, being met with a\r\nsmart fire from our breastworks;\" and Little, no doubt, was at Fort\r\nGreene, an eye-witness.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day was lost at the left and centre, and it only remains to return\r\nto Stirling on the right. This general stood his ground firmly, though\r\nthe firing in his rear grew ominously distinct. He refused to\r\nretreat, says Scott, for want of orders. If Sullivan sent him orders,\r\nas we have assumed on one writer's authority that he did, they failed\r\nto reach him. The time had come for the general to act on his own\r\njudgment, and finding his salvation dependent on an immediate retreat,\r\nhe fell back from Grant's front between eleven and twelve o'clock, but\r\nonly to discover that he too was surrounded. The force which had\r\nanticipated him was Cornwallis with the Seventy-first Regiment and the\r\nSecond Grenadiers, and they were holding his line of retreat on the\r\nGowanus Road. Stirling, realizing his danger, at once determined upon\r\nthe only manoeuvre that promised escape for any of his command. Upon\r\nhis left lay the Gowanus marsh and creek, where both were at their\r\nbroadest, and where a crossing had never been attempted. But now the\r\nattempt must be made, or every man is lost. Upon the other side of the\r\ncreek are the Brooklyn peninsula, the lines, and safety. Stirling\r\ntherefore ordered his men to make their way across as they could,\r\nwhile, to protect them as they forded or swam, he himself took Gist\r\nand half the Maryland battalion and proceeded to attack Cornwallis.\r\nAgainst all the misfortunes of the day this piece of resolution and\r\ntrue soldiership stands out in noble relief. The Marylanders followed\r\ntheir general without flinching, and were soon \"warmly engaged\" with\r\nthe enemy, who had posted themselves at a house--the old \"Cortelyou\"\r\nhouse--above the upper mills near the intersection of the Port and\r\nGowanus roads. They rallied to the attack several times, as Stirling\r\nreports, and seemed on the point of dislodging Cornwallis, when\r\nreinforcements came up, and the British drove back the Marylanders\r\ninto a piece of woods. Here, with conspicuous courage and\r\ndetermination, they formed again for still another effort to break\r\nthrough. Stirling's example was inspiring. \"He encouraged and animated\r\nour young soldiers,\" writes Gist, \"with almost invincible resolution.\"\r\nBut his handful of brave men had done all that was possible, and in\r\ntheir last charge they were met by great numbers and forced to retire\r\nagain, \"with much precipitation and confusion.\"[153] They broke up\r\ninto small parties and sought escape. Nine only, among whom was Major\r\nGist, succeeded in crossing the creek, the rest having retreated into\r\nthe woods.[154] Stirling endeavored to get into the lines between the\r\nBritish and Fort Box, or by way of the mill-dam, but finding this\r\nimpossible, he turned, ran through their fire, and eluding pursuit\r\naround a hill, made his way to the Hessian corps and surrendered\r\nhimself to General De Heister. He had sacrificed himself and party as\r\nprisoners, but his main object was accomplished. The rest of the\r\ncommand was saved! They crossed the marsh and creek with a loss of but\r\ntwo or three killed and six or eight drowned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: The conduct of the Marylanders was soldierly beyond\r\npraise. But some accounts subject them to a singular martyrdom,\r\nkilling every man of the two hundred and fifty-nine reported missing.\r\nAs there was but one officer wounded, or at the most one killed and\r\none wounded in the party, according to the official returns, the\r\nproportion of men killed was doubtless small. The letter in _Force_,\r\n5th Series, vol. i., p. 1232, referring to this attack, bears every\r\nevidence of having been written by Gist himself, and it is quoted as\r\nhis in the text. In this letter Gist speaks of being surrounded on all\r\nsides, and then adds: \"The impracticability of forcing through such a\r\nformidable body of troops rendered it the height of rashness and\r\nimprudence to risk the lives of our remaining party in a third\r\nattempt, and it became necessary for us to endeavor to effect our\r\nescape in the best manner we possibly could.\" This shows that there\r\nwere many left to disperse. Their prudence was equal to their\r\ncourage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Before Stirling's fight with Cornwallis took place, the\r\nmill and little bridge at the further end of the mill-dam across\r\nGowanus Creek were burned down. Colonel Smallwood charged \"a certain\r\nColonel Ward\" with the act, and claimed that the destruction of the\r\nbridge prevented the escape of Stirling and the Marylanders with him.\r\nMr. Bancroft and Mr. Field repeat the charge. But Smallwood is\r\ncontradicted both by Stirling and Gist, the former stating that he\r\ncould not get by the British on the road full half a mile beyond the\r\nbridge, and the latter adding that he was driven back into the woods.\r\nThe charge had no foundation, the bridge not having been set on fire\r\nuntil after the enemy took possession of the road above (see Ewing's\r\nsketch). The \"Colonel Ward\" was Colonel Jonathan Ward, of\r\nMassachusetts; and the probability is that he and Colonel Tyler, both\r\nof whom lost some men during the day, had been sent out on the Port\r\nRoad, but, finding Cornwallis there, retreated, burning mill and\r\nbridge to obstruct the latter's possible advance in that quarter.]\r\n\r\nIt was during this scene in the incidents of the day that Washington\r\nand his staff came upon the ground. They had remained at New York\r\nwatching the fleet, when, finding that no danger was to be apprehended\r\nfrom that quarter, they crossed to Long Island. From the top of one of\r\nthe hills within the lines, possibly Cobble Hill, the Chief witnessed\r\nStirling's retreat and fight, and is said there to have been\r\nprofoundly moved as he saw how many brave men he must inevitably lose.\r\nColonel Smallwood, of the Marylanders, who had rejoined his regiment,\r\npetitioned for a force to march out and assist Stirling, but the\r\ngeneral declined on account of the risks involved. Douglas's\r\nConnecticut levies, just coming up from the ferry,[155] were sent to\r\nthe extreme right opposite the mouth of Gowanus Creek, where, with\r\nCaptain Thomas' Maryland Independent Company and two pieces of\r\nartillery, they stood ready to prevent pursuit of the retreating party\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: The reinforcements that came over during the forenoon,\r\nbesides Douglas's regiment, were Sage's and Selden's, which, with\r\nDouglas, completed Wadsworth's brigade on that side; Charles Webb's,\r\nof McDougall's brigade; and Scott, with Malcom and Humphrey's men, or\r\nthe rest of his brigade.]\r\n\r\nLast of all, where were Parsons and Atlee? Had they been holding that\r\nhill in Greenwood all the morning, with a tenacity worthy of veterans,\r\nonly to be swallowed up in the defeat and confusion of the day? Such\r\nwas to be their fate. For some unexplained reason, when Stirling fell\r\nback, he failed to inform Parsons of his move. Both Parsons and Atlee\r\nstate that no word reached them to join the general, and that it was\r\ngreatly to their surprise when they found the line, whose flank they\r\nhad been protecting, no longer there. Whatever the mistake, there was\r\nno time to lose, for the enemy were now pressing on this little force,\r\nand it must retreat as Stirling had done. But it soon found itself\r\nmore effectually hemmed in than any party in the field. Cornwallis,\r\nafter driving the Marylanders back, had complete command of the road,\r\nand as Parsons and Atlee came along they found it impossible even to\r\nreach the marsh. Some escaped, but the greater part turned into the\r\nwoods and were all taken. Atlee, with twenty-three men, avoided\r\ncapture until five o'clock in the afternoon; while Parsons, more\r\nfortunate, hid in a swamp, having escaped from the action and pursuit\r\n\"as by a miracle,\" and with seven men made his way into our lines at\r\ndaylight next morning.[156]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: \"Colonel Huntington's and the Maryland regiment\r\nsuffered the most. General Parsons says that some of our men fought\r\nthrough the enemy not less than 7 or 8 times that day. He lay out\r\nhimself part of the night concealed in a swamp, from whence he made\r\nhis escape with 7 men to our lines about break of day the next\r\nmorning.\"--_Letter from an Officer, Conn. Journal_, September 18th,\r\n1776. \"I came in with 7 men yesterday morning, much fatigued.\"--_General\r\nParsons_, August 29th, 1776.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe battle was over. It had continued at intervals, at one point or\r\nanother, over a range of five miles, from three o'clock in the morning\r\nuntil nearly two in the afternoon. Less than five thousand Americans\r\nat the passes, including Stirling's command and all others who had\r\nmarched out during the morning, had been swept up or swept back by\r\nnearly twenty thousand British and Hessians. For our troops it was a\r\ntotal defeat. They had been forced to abandon the outer line of\r\ndefence--the very line Washington wished should be held \"at all\r\nhazards\"--and had been driven into the fortified camp on the Brooklyn\r\npeninsula. This result would have inevitably come, sooner or later,\r\nbut no one could have entertained the possibility of its coming in\r\nthis sudden and disastrous shape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back over the day's work, the cause of the defeat is apparent\r\nat once: _We had been completely outflanked and surprised on the\r\nJamaica Road._ Where the responsibility for the surprise should rest\r\nis another question. Evidently, if that patrol of officers had not\r\nbeen captured, but, upon discovering the approach of the enemy, had\r\ncarried the word directly to Miles' camp and to headquarters, the\r\nenemy would not have gained the rear of our outposts without warning.\r\nMiles and Wyllys could have interposed themselves across their path,\r\nand held the ground long enough at least to put our troops at the\r\nother points on their guard. The surprise of this patrol, therefore,\r\ncan alone explain the defeat. But as the officers appear to have been\r\nsent out as an additional precaution, the responsibility must be\r\nshared by Miles and his regiment, who were the permanent guard on the\r\nleft. Brodhead, who wrote eight days after the event, distinctly\r\nasserts that there were no troops beyond them, and that, for want of\r\nvidettes, that flank was left for them to watch. Parsons, as officer\r\nof the day, reports that Miles was expected to patrol across the\r\nJamaica Road. But to charge the colonel personally with a fatal\r\nmistake or neglect is not warranted by the facts. His own patrols and\r\npickets may have failed him. The simple fact appears that this\r\nregiment was put upon our left, that our left was turned, and the\r\nbattle lost in consequence. As to the generalship of the day, if the\r\nresponsibility falls on any one, it falls first on Sullivan, who sent\r\nout the mounted patrol in the first instance, and to whom it belonged\r\nto follow up the precautions in that direction. Putnam was in chief\r\ncommand, but nothing can be inferred from contemporary records to\r\nfasten neglect or blunder upon him any more than upon Washington, who,\r\nwhen he left the Brooklyn lines on the evening of the 26th, must have\r\nknown precisely what disposition had been made for the night at the\r\nhills and passes. And upon Washington certainly the responsibility\r\ncannot rest.[157]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFEAT.--According to some of\r\nour more recent versions of this battle, the disaster is to be\r\nreferred to the wilful disobedience, criminal inattention, and total\r\nincapacity of General Putnam. Several writers make the charge so\r\npointedly and upon such an array of fact, that the reader is left to\r\nwonder how all this should have escaped the notice of the\r\ncommander-in-chief at the time, and why Putnam was not immediately\r\ncourt-martialled and dismissed the service, instead of being\r\ncontinued, as he was, in important commands. The charge is the more\r\nserious as it is advanced by so respectable an authority as Mr.\r\nBancroft. Mr. Field, Mr. Dawson, and Dr. Stiles, following the latter,\r\nincline strongly in the same direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft first assails Putnam for sending Stirling out to the\r\nright when word came in that the enemy were advancing and our pickets\r\nflying. This is criticised as \"a rash order,\" because it sent Stirling\r\nto a position which was \"dangerous in the extreme,\" with the Gowanus\r\nmarsh in his rear. But as to this, it only needs to be said that\r\nPutnam's written instructions from Washington were imperative to\r\nprevent the enemy from passing the hills and approaching the works. It\r\nwould have been a clear disregard of Washington's intention had Putnam\r\nnot sent Stirling out precisely as he did. The enemy were coming up\r\nfrom the Narrows and must be checked \"at all hazards.\" Furthermore,\r\nthe position Stirling took up at about Nineteenth Street was actually\r\nsafer than any other on the outpost line. His right could not be\r\nturned, for it rested on the bay, and he could see every movement of\r\nthe fleet. His left was well covered by Parsons, and no one could have\r\nimagined his rear in danger with the other outposts guarding it for\r\nmore than three miles. As a matter of fact, Stirling was nearer the\r\nlines than either Miles or Wyllys.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is charged that when Putnam and Sullivan visited the extreme\r\nleft on the 26th \"the movements of the enemy plainly disclosed that it\r\nwas their intention to get into the rear of the Americans by the\r\nJamaica Road,\" yet nothing was done. The foundation of this is\r\nprobably a statement of Brodhead's and another by Miles to the effect\r\nthat these generals might have themselves observed that the enemy were\r\npreparing for the Jamaica move. But if the intentions of the latter\r\nwere so obvious at that time, it is proper to ask why it was not\r\nequally obvious on the next morning that they were actually carrying\r\nout their intentions, and why Miles and Brodhead did not so report at\r\nan early hour. These officers were rightly impressed with the\r\nconviction that the enemy would come by way of Jamaica, but it is\r\ncertain that the enemy made no observable move in that direction from\r\nFlatlands, where they had been for three days, until nine o'clock that\r\nnight. So says Howe. It was clearly in the plan of the British to give\r\nour outposts no ground for suspecting a flanking manoeuvre. Their\r\nmovements were far from being \"plainly disclosed.\" The quotation given\r\nby Mr. Bancroft in this connection, namely, that \"Washington's order\r\nto secure the Jamaica Road was not obeyed,\" unfortunately appears as\r\noriginal in a \"Review of the War\" published in 1779 and written by\r\nsome irresponsible individual in England, who could neither have known\r\nwhat Washington's orders were, nor whether any attempt was made to\r\ncarry them out.\r\n\r\nA further charge is this: \"Early in the morning, Putnam was informed\r\nthat infantry and cavalry were advancing on the Jamaica Road. He gave\r\nWashington no notice of the danger; he sent Stirling no order to\r\nretreat.\" This is doubtless on the authority of a letter in _Force_,\r\n5th Series, vol. i., p. 1195. But how early was Putnam informed? The\r\nwriter of the letter who brought the word was probably one of Miles'\r\nor Brodhead's men, for he tells us that his regiment was dressed in\r\nhunting-shirts, and he makes the very important statement that on his\r\nway back to his post he met the enemy! The information came too late,\r\nfor the British were now marching down towards the lines. Sullivan had\r\ngone to the Flatbush Pass, where he could understand the situation\r\nbetter than Putnam, and he was the proper officer to give directions\r\nto the outposts at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe charges made by Mr. Dawson have still less foundation. General\r\nPutnam is stated never to have reconnoitred the enemy's position.\r\nBrodhead, however, states distinctly that he did. \"It is also a\r\nwell-established fact,\" says this writer, \"that no general officer was\r\noutside the lines at Brooklyn on the night of the 26th.\" What is the\r\nauthority for this? Nixon, Stirling, and Parsons had been successively\r\nofficers of the day, and presumably did their duty. Parsons, on the\r\nmorning of the 27th, was on the lower road trying to rally the pickets\r\nbefore Stirling appeared with reinforcements. \"The mounted patrols\r\nwhich General Sullivan had established, as well as the guards at some\r\nof the passes established by General Greene, were withdrawn.\" The fact\r\nthat all the passes were well guarded and a special patrol sent out,\r\nis a complete answer to this assertion, so far as the night of the\r\n26th is concerned. In this light the general conclusion arrived at by\r\nMr. Dawson, that \"General Putnam paid no attention to the orders of\r\nGeneral Washington,\" cannot be sustained.\r\n\r\nWith regard to General Sullivan, it is but just to give his own\r\nexplanation. A year after the battle, he wrote: \"I know it has been\r\ngenerally reported that I commanded on Long Island when the actions\r\nhappened there. This is by no means true; _General Putnam_ had taken\r\nthe command from me four days before the action. Lord Stirling\r\ncommanded the main body without the lines; I was to have command under\r\nGeneral Putnam within the lines. I was very uneasy about a road\r\nthrough which I had often foretold the enemy would come, but could not\r\npersuade others to be of my opinion. I went to the Hill near Flatbush\r\nto reconnoitre the enemy, and, with a piquet of four hundred men, was\r\nsurrounded by the enemy, who had advanced by the very road I had\r\nforetold, and which I had paid horsemen fifty dollars for patrolling\r\nby night, while I had the command, as I had no foot for the purpose,\r\nfor which I was never reimbursed, as it was supposed unnecessary.\" In\r\nanother letter he adds: \"I was so persuaded of the enemy's coming the\r\n[Jamaica] route, that I went to examine, and was surrounded by the\r\nBritish army, and after a long and severe engagement was made\r\nprisoner.\" These letters were written when Sullivan was restless under\r\ncharges brought against him in connection with the defeat at\r\nBrandywine--charges which were properly dropped, however--and are not\r\nconclusive as to the Long Island affair. His statements are no doubt\r\nstrictly true, but they in no way affect the main point, namely, did\r\nwe or did we not have a patrol out on the Jamaica Road _on the night\r\nof the 26th_? We have seen that there was such a patrol, and probably\r\nthe best that had yet been sent out, and sent out, according to\r\nLieutenant Van Wagenen, by General Sullivan himself.\r\n\r\nThere are but few references to the question of responsibility in\r\ncontemporary letters and documents. Gordon blames Sullivan as being\r\nover-confident. Miles and Brodhead leave us to infer that this general\r\nhad much to do with the plan of action, and must be held at least in\r\npart responsible. Sullivan, on the other hand, according to Brodhead,\r\nblamed Miles for the defeat, as Parsons did. When these officers\r\nwrote, they wrote to defend their own conduct, and their testimony is\r\nnecessarily incomplete so far as others are concerned.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the case seems to be this: On the night of the 26th we had\r\nall the roads guarded. On the morning of the 27th Putnam promptly\r\nreinforced the guards on the lower road when the enemy were announced.\r\nThe arrangements were such that if an attack was made at any of the\r\nother points he and Sullivan were to have word of it in ample time. No\r\nword came in time from the left, for the reason that those who were to\r\nbring it were captured, or surprised, or failed of their duty. Hence\r\nthe disaster. The dispositions on Long Island were quite as complete\r\nas those at Brandywine more than a year later, where we suffered\r\nnearly a similar surprise and as heavy a loss. Suppose the very small\r\npatrols sent out by Washington and Sullivan to gain information before\r\nthat battle had been captured, as at Long Island--we should have\r\nsustained a greater disaster than at Long Island.\r\n\r\nUnder this state of facts, to charge Putnam with the defeat of the\r\n27th, in the terms which some writers have employed, is both unjust\r\nand unhistorical. That misfortune is not to be clouded with the\r\nadditional reflection, that it was due to the gross neglect and\r\ngeneral incapacity of the officer in command. No facts or inferences\r\njustify the charge. No one hinted it at the time; nor did Washington\r\nin the least withdraw his confidence from Putnam during the remainder\r\nof the campaign.]\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of other defeats may be said with equal truth of\r\nthis one: if it was a disaster, it was not a disgrace. Even the\r\nsurprise upon the left discloses no criminal misconduct. In the\r\nactual fighting of the day our soldiers stood their ground.\r\nNecessarily we suffered heavily in prisoners, but otherwise our loss\r\nwas inconsiderable. All the light that we have to-day goes to\r\nestablish the very important fact, originally credited and reported by\r\nWashington himself, but which hardly a single historical writer has\r\nsince ventured to repeat, that at the battle of Long Island _the\r\nBritish and Hessians suffered a loss in killed and wounded equal to\r\nthat inflicted upon the Americans_.[158] Howe reported his total\r\ncasualties at three hundred and sixty-seven officers and soldiers. On\r\nthe side of the Americans the total loss did not exceed one thousand.\r\nAbout eight hundred, including ninety-one officers, were taken\r\nprisoners; not more than six officers and about fifty privates were\r\nkilled; and less than sixteen officers and one hundred and fifty\r\nprivates wounded. No frightful slaughter of our troops, as sometimes\r\npictured, occurred during the action. It was a field where the\r\nAmerican soldier, in every fair encounter, proved himself worthy of\r\nthe cause he was fighting for.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: See note at the close of the chapter.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo those who fell in the engagement we may render here a grateful\r\ntribute, though something more than this is due. Their services and\r\nsacrifices are deserving of remembrance rather by a lasting memorial;\r\nfor men died here who showed not less of individual worth and heroism\r\nthan others who are immortalized on victorious fields. Thus at the\r\nFlatbush Road we find Philip Johnston, colonel of the Jersey\r\nbattalion, which formed part of the guard there during the night. He\r\nwas the son of the worthy Judge Samuel Johnston, of the town of Sidney\r\nin Hunterdon County. In his youth he had been a student at Princeton,\r\nbut, dropping his books, he took up the sword for the colonies in the\r\nFrench war, from which he returned with honor. The troubles with Great\r\nBritain found him ready again to fight in defence of common rights and\r\nhis native soil. Parting from his wife and child with touching\r\naffection, he took the field with his regiment, and when attacked on\r\nLong Island he showed all the qualities which mark the true soldier. A\r\ngentleman of high principle, an officer of fine presence, one of the\r\nstrongest men in the army, he fought near Sullivan with the greatest\r\nbravery until he fell mortally wounded. That August 27th was his\r\nthirty-fifth birthday.\r\n\r\nEqually glorious and regretted was the death of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCaleb Parry, of Atlee's regiment, which occurred, as already noticed,\r\nat an earlier hour and in another part of the field. He too was in the\r\nprime of life, and eager to render the country some good service. A\r\nrepresentative colonist, descended from an ancient and honorable\r\nfamily long seated in North Wales, and a man of polish and culture, he\r\nstood ready for any sacrifice demanded of him at this crisis. Parry\r\ncame from Chester County, Pennsylvania, leaving a wife and five\r\nchildren, and crossed with his regiment to Long Island four days\r\nbefore the battle. Under what circumstances he fell has been told. As\r\nthey crossed the line of Greenwood Cemetery to take position at or\r\nnear \"Battle Hill,\" the little command was greeted with a sudden\r\nthough harmless volley from the enemy. The men shrunk and fell back,\r\nbut Atlee rallied and Parry cheered them on, and they gained the hill.\r\nIt was here, while engaged in an officer's highest duty, turning men\r\nto the enemy by his own example, that the fatal bullet pierced his\r\nbrow. When some future monument rises from Greenwood to commemorate\r\nthe struggle of this day, it can bear no more fitting line among its\r\ninscriptions than this tribute of Brodhead's, \"Parry died like a\r\nhero.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Edward Veazey, of the Marylanders, belonged to the family of\r\nVeazeys who settled in Cecil County, on the eastern shore of that\r\nState, and who traced their lineage back to the Norman De Veazies of\r\nthe eleventh century. The captain was fifty-five years of age, took up\r\nthe colonial cause at the start, raised the Seventh Independent\r\nCompany of Maryland troops, and was among the earliest to fall in\r\nStirling's line.\r\n\r\nCaptain Joseph Jewett, of Huntington's Continentals, perhaps defending\r\nhimself to the last, even when escape was impossible, was three times\r\nstabbed with British bayonets after surrendering his sword. Cared for\r\nby a humane surgeon, but still lingering in pain, he died on the\r\nmorning of the 29th, and was buried in the Bennett orchard, near\r\nTwenty-second Street and Third Avenue. He left a family at Lyme, on\r\nthe Connecticut, where he lived, and from where he went to join the\r\narmy on the Lexington alarm. A soldier who fought on Long Island\r\nremembers him as \"an officer much respected and beloved, of elegant\r\nand commanding appearance, and of unquestionable bravery.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers and men of the artillery, who fought the six pieces we\r\nhad in the action, covered themselves with honor. They were \"the\r\nflower\" of Knox's regiment, picked for a field fight. Captain\r\nCarpenter, of Providence, fell in Stirling's command, leaving a widow\r\nto mourn him. Captain John Johnston, of Boston, was desperately\r\nwounded, but recovered under the care of Surgeon Eustis. The record\r\nwhich John Callender, of the same place, made for himself is a\r\nfamiliar story. To wipe out the stain of an undeserved sentence passed\r\nupon him after Bunker Hill, by which he was cashiered, he rejoined the\r\nartillery as a private soldier, and then, as a \"cadet,\" fought his\r\npiece on Long Island until the enemy's bayonets were at his breast.\r\nUpon his exchange as prisoner a year later, Washington restored him to\r\nhis rank as captain-lieutenant, and he served honorably to the end of\r\nthe war. Harmanus Rutgers, one of the patriotic Rutgers brothers in\r\nNew York, serving, it would seem, as a gunner, was struck in the\r\nbreast by a cannon-shot, and fell dead at his post. The tradition\r\npreserved in his family is that he was the first man killed in the\r\nbattle. Knox, hearing how well his men had done, wrote to his wife: \"I\r\nhave met with some loss in my regiment. They fought like heroes and\r\nare gone to glory.\"\r\n\r\nOf three others known to have been killed during the day, and who\r\nprobably complete the list of officers, we have no more than the fact\r\nthat they fell. They were Lieutenant Joseph Jacquet, of Miles' first\r\nbattalion, and Lieutenants David Sloan and Charles Taylor, of the\r\nsecond battalion--all apparently from Chester County, Pennsylvania.\r\nHardly more than three or four names of the private soldiers who were\r\nkilled have been preserved, owing doubtless to the fact that, if they\r\nwere ever known, it was not until long after, when no rolls would show\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nTo the roll of the dead must be added also the honored name of General\r\nNathaniel Woodhull, of Long Island. On the day after the battle, a\r\nparty of British light horse, under Oliver De Lancey, rode out on the\r\nJamaica Road and surprised the general at an inn, where without\r\nprovocation he was cruelly hacked in the head and arm, and carried off\r\na prisoner. He survived until the 20th, when he died at New Utrecht.\r\nHis loss was greatly regretted, for he was a man of energy and\r\nability, and had the success of the Revolutionary cause most fervently\r\nat heart.[159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Mr. Onderdonk, Mr. Thompson, and others have gathered\r\nand published all the known incidents respecting the fate of General\r\nWoodhull, which are doubtless familiar to those interested in the\r\nhistory of Long Island. See General Scott's brief reference to him in\r\n_Document_ 6.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis battle was regarded at the time as one of very great importance,\r\nand the result created a deep impression on both sides of the water.\r\nIn England they had long been waiting for the news, and the king\r\nbecame depressed at the British delay in moving; in addition, the\r\nfirst reports, coming by way of France, were unfavorable. But at last,\r\nat three o'clock on the morning of October 10th, Major Cuyler, of\r\nHowe's staff, reached the government with the official accounts of the\r\nvictory. Immediately, as Walpole tells us, the Court was filled with\r\n\"an extravagance of joy.\" The relief was so great that it was\r\ndisplayed with \"the utmost ostentation.\" The king at once determined\r\nto send Howe \"a red riband;\" and Lord Mansfield, who had thrown the\r\nweight of his great legal abilities against America, was created an\r\nearl. The Mayor and Corporation of York voted an address to his\r\nMajesty \"on the victory at Long Island;\" at Leeds they rang the\r\nbells, lighted windows, fired cannon, and started a huge bonfire which\r\nmade the town \"quite luminous;\" and at Halifax, Colne, Huddersfield,\r\nand many other places, similar rejoicings were held. At Limerick\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Campbell ordered the garrison under arms, and fired\r\nthree volleys \"on account of the success of his Majesty's troops at\r\nLong Island;\" and, for the same reason, in the evening \"a number of\r\nladies and gentlemen were elegantly entertained at dinner by the\r\nbishop.\" From Paris Silas Deane wrote to Congress: \"The want of\r\ninstructions or intelligence or remittances, with the late check on\r\nLong Island, has sunk our credit to nothing.\" In Amsterdam, the centre\r\nof exchange for all Europe, English stocks rose; but the Dutch, with\r\ncharacteristic shrewdness, failed to accept \"our misfortune\" as final,\r\nand took the opportunity to sell out. In London Tory circles they\r\nconsidered the American war as practically over, and some began to\r\ntalk of new schemes of colonial government.\r\n\r\nAs for America, the defeat, coupled with the subsequent retreat,\r\neverywhere carried alarm and keen disappointment. Greene speaks of the\r\n\"panic\" in the county. But at the same time many brave voices were\r\nraised to counteract despondency. Parsons, in the army, wrote: \"I\r\nthink the trial of that day far from being any discouragement, but in\r\ngeneral our men behaved with firmness.\" Bartlett, in Congress, sent\r\nword home to New Hampshire that he hoped the event would only make our\r\ngenerals more careful in their future operations. \"We have lost a\r\nbattle and a small island,\" said Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, in one of\r\nthe sessions a few days later, \"but we have not lost a State. Why\r\nthen should we be discouraged? Or why should we be discouraged even\r\nif we had lost a State? If there were but one State left, still that\r\none should peril all for independence.\" \"The panic may seize whom it\r\nwill,\" wrote John Adams; \"it shall not seize me.\" But the grandest\r\nwords inspired by the pervading anxiety were those penned by Abigail\r\nAdams, the noble wife of the Massachusetts delegate. \"We have had many\r\nstories,\" she wrote from Braintree, September 9th, \"concerning\r\nengagements upon Long Island this week, of our lines being forced and\r\nof our troops returning to New York. Particulars we have not yet\r\nobtained. All we can learn is that we have been unsuccessful there;\r\nhaving many men as prisoners, among whom are Lord Stirling and General\r\nSullivan. _But if we should be defeated, I think we shall not be\r\nconquered. A people fired, like the Romans, with love of their country\r\nand of liberty, a zeal for the public good, and a noble emulation of\r\nglory, will not be disheartened or dispirited by a succession of\r\nunfortunate events. But, like them, may we learn by defeat the power\r\nof becoming invincible!_\"\r\n\r\nThis was the true inspiration of the hour. It was this that sustained\r\nWashington and the strong men of the country through all the dark\r\nperiod that followed. The disaster of the 27th was a disciplinary\r\nexperience. It was but the first of a series of blows that were to\r\nharden us for future endurance. The event was accepted in this spirit\r\nby all who had taken up the cause in earnest; and in this light the\r\nmemory of the day deserves to be forever celebrated and perpetuated.\r\nHere, on Long Island, all was done that could be done, for we had met\r\nthe enemy at the sea. Here America made her first stand against\r\nEngland's first great effort to subdue her; and here her resolution to\r\ncontinue resistance was first tested and tempered in the fire of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     THE LOSSES AT THE BATTLE.--So many widely different\r\n     estimates have been made as to the extent of the American\r\n     loss on Long Island, that it becomes a matter of historical\r\n     interest to fix the actual figures, if possible, beyond\r\n     dispute.\r\n\r\n     The first official reference to the matter occurs in the\r\n     letter which Washington directed Colonel Harrison, his\r\n     secretary, to write to Congress on the evening of the\r\n     battle. Nothing definite on this point being known at that\r\n     hour, Harrison, after announcing the attack of the enemy,\r\n     and the retreat of the troops into the Brooklyn lines, could\r\n     only make the vague report that the American loss was\r\n     \"pretty considerable.\" On Thursday morning, the 29th, at\r\n     \"half after four A.M.,\" Washington himself wrote to Hancock\r\n     that he was still uncertain how far the army had suffered.\r\n     On Saturday, the 31st, he wrote again, and in this letter\r\n     gave an estimate in figures. This was the only report he\r\n     made to Congress in the matter, except indirectly. \"Nor have\r\n     I,\" he writes, \"been yet able to obtain an exact account of\r\n     our loss; we suppose it from seven hundred to a thousand\r\n     killed and taken.\" In subsequent public and private letters\r\n     to his brother, to Governor Trumbull, General Schuyler, and\r\n     the Massachusetts Assembly, Washington did not vary these\r\n     figures materially (except to make the estimate closer,\r\n     about 800), and they stand, therefore, as his official\r\n     return of the casualties of that day.\r\n\r\n     Sir William Howe's report, on the other hand, presented\r\n     altogether a different showing. It left no room for doubt as\r\n     to the extent of the British victory. Dated September 3d,\r\n     seven days after the affair, it contained all those\r\n     particulars of events up to that time which a successful\r\n     general is well aware will be received with special\r\n     satisfaction by his government. The landing at Gravesend,\r\n     the occupation of Flatbush, the skilful march of the\r\n     flanking column, the bravery of the troops, and the complete\r\n     success of the entire plan of action were mentioned in\r\n     order; while a detailed statement and estimate of the losses\r\n     on either side, including a tabulated return of prisoners\r\n     taken, only fortified the impression that a most damaging\r\n     defeat had been served upon the Americans. Against\r\n     Washington's estimate of a total of one thousand or less for\r\n     his own loss, Howe reported that the enlisted men he\r\n     captured alone numbered one thousand and six, and that in\r\n     addition he took ninety-one commissioned officers, of whom\r\n     three were generals, three colonels, four\r\n     lieutenant-colonels, three majors, eighteen captains,\r\n     forty-three lieutenants, eleven ensigns, one adjutant, three\r\n     surgeons, and two volunteers; and he \"computed\" that in\r\n     killed, wounded, and drowned, the Americans lost two\r\n     thousand two hundred more. On the part of the British, Howe\r\n     reported five officers and fifty-six men killed, twelve\r\n     officers and two hundred and fifty-five men wounded, and one\r\n     officer and thirty men prisoners and missing. The Hessians\r\n     lost two men killed, three officers and twenty-three men\r\n     wounded. Howe's total loss, in a word, was made to appear at\r\n     less than four hundred; Washington's full three thousand\r\n     three hundred.\r\n\r\n     The apparent exactness of this report has secured it, in\r\n     general, against close analysis. English historians, almost\r\n     without exception, quote it as it stands, while there are\r\n     American writers who respect it so far as to pronounce\r\n     Washington's report clearly, and even purposely, inaccurate.\r\n     Thus the most recent English history of this period says:\r\n     \"The Americans fled in confusion, leaving upwards of three\r\n     thousand killed, wounded, and prisoners, including their\r\n     three generals of division;\" and in a note the writer adds:\r\n     \"Washington's estimate of the loss on both sides was grossly\r\n     incorrect. In his letter to Congress of the 30th August,\r\n     giving a very meagre and evasive account of the action, he\r\n     says that his loss in killed and prisoners was from 700 to\r\n     1000; and that he had reason to believe the enemy had\r\n     suffered still more. This would seem to be a wilful\r\n     misrepresentation to prevent the public alarm which might\r\n     have been caused by the knowledge of his real loss; were it\r\n     not that in a private letter to his brother, three weeks\r\n     afterwards, he makes a similar statement. General Howe's\r\n     returns of _prisoners_, and of his own killed and wounded,\r\n     are precise.\" (_History of England during the Reign of\r\n     George the Third._ By the Right Hon. William Massey, 1865.)\r\n     Among Brooklyn writers, Mr. Field asserts that Washington\r\n     concealed the actual extent of his loss, and Dr. Stiles\r\n     accepts the British report as it stands. Marshall puts the\r\n     American loss at over 1000; Irving, 2000; Lossing, 1650;\r\n     Field, 2000; Sparks, 1100; Bancroft, 800; Carrington, 970.\r\n     Stedman, the earliest British historian, gives 2000, while\r\n     Adolphus, Jesse, and Massey, who cover the reign of George\r\n     III., blindly follow Howe and give over 3000 for the\r\n     American loss.\r\n\r\n     There is but one explanation of this wide discrepancy\r\n     between the British and American returns, namely:\r\n     Washington's original estimate at its largest limit--one\r\n     thousand, killed, wounded, and prisoners--_was almost\r\n     precisely correct_.\r\n\r\n     Of this there can be no question whatever, the proof being a\r\n     matter of record. Thus, on the 8th of October, Washington\r\n     issued the following order: \"The General desires the\r\n     commanding officers of each regiment or corps will give in a\r\n     list of the names and the officers and men who were killed,\r\n     taken, or missing in the action of the 27th of August on\r\n     Long Island and since that period. He desires the returns\r\n     may be correct, &c.\" (_Force_). A large number of these\r\n     lists are preserved in _Force_, 5th series, vol. iii., and\r\n     from these we obtain the losses of the following regiments:\r\n     Hitchcock's, total loss, one officer and nine men; Little's,\r\n     three men; Huntington's, twenty-one officers and one hundred\r\n     and eighty-six men; Wyllys', one officer and nine men;\r\n     Tyler, three men; Ward, three men; Chester, twelve men; Gay,\r\n     four men; Lasher, three officers. Smallwood's lost,\r\n     according to Gist, twelve officers and two hundred and\r\n     forty-seven men; Haslet, according to his own letters, two\r\n     officers and twenty-five men; Johnston's New Jersey, two\r\n     officers and less than twenty-five men, the rolls before and\r\n     after the battle showing no greater difference in the\r\n     strength of the regiment; Miles' two battalions, sixteen\r\n     officers and about one hundred and sixty men (_Document_\r\n     61); Atlee, eleven officers and seventy-seven men. (_Ibid._)\r\n     No official report of the losses in Lutz's, Kachlein's, and\r\n     Hay's detachments or the artillery can be found, but to give\r\n     their total casualties at one hundred and fifty officers and\r\n     men is probably a liberal estimate. Lutz lost six officers\r\n     (all prisoners); Kachlein not more; Hay, one; the artillery,\r\n     three. The regiments named in the foregoing list include all\r\n     from which Howe reported that he took officers prisoners,\r\n     from which it is safe to conclude that these were all that\r\n     lost any. No others are mentioned as having been engaged.\r\n     These figures show in round numbers a total of _one\r\n     thousand_, and this was our total loss, according to\r\n     official returns in nearly every case.\r\n\r\n     How many of these, in the next place, were killed and\r\n     wounded? If we are to credit certain Hessian and British\r\n     accounts, as well as those of our own local historians, the\r\n     battle-field on Long Island was a scene of carnage, a pen in\r\n     which our men were slaughtered without mercy. The confused\r\n     strife, says one writer, \"is too terrible for the\r\n     imagination to dwell upon.\" \"An appalling massacre,\" says\r\n     another, \"thus closed the combat.\" \"The forest,\" writes a\r\n     Hessian officer, \"was a scene of horror; there were\r\n     certainly two thousand killed and wounded lying about.\" Lord\r\n     Howe himself, as we have seen, \"computed\" that the American\r\n     loss in killed and wounded alone was two thousand three\r\n     hundred. But a striking commentary on this computation is\r\n     not only the total omission on his part to mention how many\r\n     of this very large number he buried on the field, but the\r\n     important admission he makes that not more than sixty-seven\r\n     wounded American officers and soldiers fell into his hands!\r\n     Where were the twenty-two hundred other maimed and fallen\r\n     rebels? Obviously, and as Howe must have well known, the\r\n     Americans could carry few if any of their dead with them on\r\n     their precipitate retreat, nor could any but the slightly\r\n     hurt of the wounded make their escape. Full two thousand, by\r\n     this calculation, must have been left upon the field. Who\r\n     buried them? Were they the victims of the supposed frightful\r\n     slaughter? Did the British general purposely give an evasive\r\n     estimate to cover up the inhumanity which would thus have\r\n     forever stained the glory of his victory? Far from it. That\r\n     \"computation\" has no basis to stand upon; but, on the\r\n     contrary, our loss in killed and wounded was not greater\r\n     than the enemy's, but most probably less.\r\n\r\n     This statement will bear close examination. On the 19th of\r\n     September, after he must have been able to satisfy himself\r\n     as to the extent of the defeat on Long Island, the\r\n     commander-in-chief wrote to the Massachusetts Assembly that\r\n     he had lost about eight hundred men, \"more than three\r\n     fourths of which were taken prisoners.\" He wrote the same\r\n     thing to others. So Washington felt authorized to state\r\n     positively that we lost in killed and wounded that day not\r\n     over two hundred men and officers. \"The enemy's loss in\r\n     killed,\" he added, \"we could never ascertain; but have many\r\n     reasons to believe that it was pretty considerable, and\r\n     exceeded ours a good deal.\" General Parsons, who saw as much\r\n     of the field as any other officer, wrote to John Adams two\r\n     days after the battle: \"Our loss in killed and wounded is\r\n     inconsiderable.\" General Scott, writing to John Jay, a week\r\n     later, could say: \"What our loss on Long Island was I am not\r\n     able to estimate. I think from the best accounts we must\r\n     have killed many of the enemy.\" Colonel Douglas wrote,\r\n     August 31st: \"The enemy surrounded a large detachment of our\r\n     army, took many, killed some and the rest got off.... By the\r\n     best account we killed more of them than they did of us. But\r\n     they took the most prisoners.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Chambers,\r\n     who was in the way of gathering many particulars from the\r\n     Pennsylvanians who escaped, says: \"Our men behaved as\r\n     bravely as men ever did; but it is surprising that, with the\r\n     superiority of numbers, they were not cut to pieces.... Our\r\n     loss is chiefly in prisoners.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Brodhead,\r\n     who had to retreat among the last over the very ground which\r\n     others have marked out as the scene of the massacre, as the\r\n     site where \"lay nearly one thousand men, slain in the shock\r\n     of battle, or by subsequent murder\" (_Field_)--Brodhead\r\n     says: \"I retreated to the lines, having lost out of the\r\n     whole battalion, about one hundred men, officers included,\r\n     which, as they were much scattered, must be chiefly\r\n     prisoners.... No troops could behave better than the\r\n     Southern, for though they seldom engaged less than five to\r\n     one, they frequently repulsed the Enemy with great\r\n     Slaughter, and I am confident that the number of killed and\r\n     wounded on their side, is greater than on ours,\r\n     notwithstanding we had to fight them front and rear under\r\n     every disadvantage.\" Colonel Silliman, of Connecticut, who\r\n     appears to have made particular inquiries in the matter,\r\n     wrote, September 10th: \"I think upon the best information I\r\n     can get that we are about 1000 men the worse for that\r\n     action. The Enemy say they have about 800 of them prisoners.\r\n     We have about 50 of them in the hospital wounded. Of the\r\n     other 150 'tis said that in the engagement a considerable\r\n     number of the riflemen deserted and went over to the enemy\r\n     and some no doubt escaped towards the other end of the\r\n     Island. On the whole I do not think we had 50 men killed in\r\n     the action.\" (_MS. letter._) These are statements made by\r\n     officers who were present at the battle, and who wrote\r\n     within a few days of the event. They all, with many others,\r\n     reach the same conclusion that the enemy suffered in killed\r\n     and wounded as much if not more than the Americans. Their\r\n     testimony, moreover, is strengthened by what we know\r\n     directly and indirectly from the returns and other sources.\r\n     The loss in officers, of which we have exact figures, is one\r\n     basis of calculation. Ninety-one, as already stated, were\r\n     taken prisoners, of whom nine were reported wounded in\r\n     Howe's return. Among these were General Woodhull, Colonel\r\n     Johnston, and Captain Jewett, all three mortally wounded,\r\n     and Captain Bowie and Lieutenant Butler, of the Marylanders;\r\n     Captain Johnston, of the artillery; Captain Peebles, of\r\n     Miles', and Lieutenant Makepeace, of Huntington's. [Colonel\r\n     Johnston is usually mentioned as having been killed on the\r\n     field. But Howe's return gives one New Jersey colonel\r\n     prisoner, and Elking's Hessian account states that he was\r\n     wounded after being made prisoner.] Among officers known to\r\n     be wounded, not captured, were Major McDonough, Lieutenants\r\n     Course and Anderson, of the Delawares; Lieutenant Hughes, of\r\n     Hitchcock's; and Captain Farmer, of Miles'. Lieutenant\r\n     Patterson, of Hay's detachment, was either killed or\r\n     captured (Colonel Cunningham's return). The officers killed\r\n     were Lieutenant-Colonel Parry, Captain Carpenter, Captain\r\n     Veazey, and Lieutenants Sloan, Jacquet, and Taylor. Various\r\n     accounts state that Colonel Rutgers, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n     Eppes, Major Abeel (of Lasher's), Captain Fellows, and\r\n     Lieutenant Moore (of Pennsylvania) were killed, but there is\r\n     an error in each case, all these officers being reported\r\n     alive at different dates after the battle. We have, then,\r\n     twenty-one killed or wounded (six only killed on the field)\r\n     among the American officers engaged in the action. If, as we\r\n     have a right to assume, the same proportion held among the\r\n     enlisted men, our total loss in killed and wounded could not\r\n     have exceeded two hundred or two hundred and fifty, or more\r\n     than one hundred less than the enemy's loss. Parsons and\r\n     Atlee write that they lost but two or three. Miles says that\r\n     in one of his skirmishes he lost a number of men, but nearly\r\n     all were made prisoners. Little's regiment lost one killed;\r\n     Hitchcock's the same. The five companies of Smallwood's\r\n     battalion that attacked Cornwallis lost but one officer\r\n     wounded, or at the most one killed and one wounded, and\r\n     there is no reason to suppose that the men suffered very\r\n     heavily. The loss among the Delawares was nearly all in\r\n     prisoners. Lutz had six officers taken, but none killed or\r\n     wounded; Hay lost one officer, either killed or prisoner. In\r\n     Kachlein's detachment it is certain that the\r\n     lieutenant-colonel, major, adjutant, three captains, and\r\n     three lieutenants were not killed, which leaves little room\r\n     for casualties in a party of not over four or five\r\n     companies. So of all the other regiments engaged, they\r\n     suffered but slightly in killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n     Howe's list of prisoners was undoubtedly swelled by captures\r\n     among the Long Island militia and citizen Whigs after the\r\n     battle. He includes General Woodhull and two lieutenants,\r\n     for instance, who were not taken at the battle but on the\r\n     day following, and who, as Washington says, were \"never\r\n     arranged\" in his army.\r\n\r\n     The reports of the slaughter and massacre of our troops\r\n     current in the enemy's camp at the time were greatly\r\n     exaggerated. Some of our men were probably cut down most\r\n     wantonly in the pursuit through the woods, both by British\r\n     and Hessians, but the number was small. It is a noticeable\r\n     and significant fact that the American accounts make no\r\n     mention of any such wholesale cruelty, and certainly our\r\n     soldiers would have been the first to call attention to it.\r\n     That word \"massacre\" should have no place in any accurate\r\n     description of the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE RETREAT TO NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation at the Brooklyn lines was relieved on the 29th by the\r\nfamous retreat of our army to New York. If Howe had surprised us by an\r\nunexpected manoeuvre on the 27th, Washington was now to surprise the\r\nBritish with a different manoeuvre, conducted with greater skill. \"A\r\nfine retreat,\" says Jomini, \"should meet with a reward equal to that\r\ngiven for a great victory.\" History assigns such a reward to\r\nWashington at Long Island.\r\n\r\nThis success--the extrication of the army from what was soon felt to\r\nbe a dangerous position--was not to be achieved without a previous two\r\ndays' experience of great hardship, trial, and despondency on the part\r\nof the troops; and unceasing anxiety and watchfulness on the part of\r\nthe commander-in-chief. The night of the 27th had closed cheerlessly\r\non the devoted Americans. The hills had been wrested from them; many\r\nof their best officers and soldiers were slain or prisoners; before\r\nthem stood the whole British army, flushed with success, and liable at\r\nany hour to rush upon their works, and in their rear flowed a deep,\r\nwide river.\r\n\r\nWashington realized the position the moment of the retreat from the\r\npasses, and immediately took measures to guard against further\r\ndisaster. Satisfied that Howe had his whole force with him, and that\r\nan attack was not to be apprehended at any other point, he ordered\r\nforward more troops to replace his losses and strengthen the lines.\r\nMifflin brought down from Harlem Heights the two well-drilled\r\nPennsylvania regiments under Colonels Magaw and Shee, with some\r\nothers; and Glover's Massachusetts was sent on from Fellows' brigade.\r\nThese all crossed to Long Island early on the morning of the 28th. At\r\nthe same time, the afternoon of the 27th, Washington sent word to\r\nGeneral Mercer in New Jersey to march all the forces under his command\r\n\"immediately to Powle's Hook\";[160] they might be needed in New York,\r\nthey might be needed on Long Island. By the morning of the 28th, the\r\ncommander-in-chief had drawn to the Brooklyn lines all the troops that\r\ncould be spared from other points, and all with which he proposed to\r\nresist the British if they attempted to carry his position by storm.\r\nHe had on that side the largest and best part of his army. The whole\r\nof Greene's division was there, the whole of Spencer's, half of\r\nSullivan's, one third of Putnam's, and a part of Heath's--in all not\r\nless than thirty-five regiments or detachments, which numbered\r\ntogether something over nine thousand five hundred men fit for\r\nduty.[161]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: This order was sent at two o'clock through General\r\nWooster, then temporarily in New York, and Mercer received it in the\r\nevening near Newark. He sent word at once to the militia at Amboy,\r\nWoodbridge, and Elizabethtown to march to Powle's Hook. _Force_, 5th\r\nSeries, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: A close analysis of the returns of September 12th,\r\nestimating all additions or reductions which should be made since the\r\nbattle, shows that this was about the number on Long Island at this\r\ndate and at the time of the retreat. The brigades now there were\r\nNixon's, Heard's, Parson's, Wadsworth's, Stirling's, Scott's, two\r\nregiments of Mifflin's, one at least of McDougall's (Webb's),\r\nGlover's, and Fellows', the Long Island militia, artillery, rangers,\r\nand several independent companies. We know at what part of the lines\r\nsome of these troops were posted. Greene's four old regiments\r\ndoubtless occupied the forts. Varnum was at Red Hook; Little at Fort\r\nGreene; Hitchcock at Fort Putnam, and Hand with him there and in the\r\nredoubt on the left. Forman's New Jersey had been at Fort Box. Three\r\nof Scott's battalions were assigned to the centre, where the\r\nbreastworks crossed the Jamaica Road. Magaw, Shee, and Glover guarded\r\nthe line from Fort Putnam to the Wallabout; Silliman was at the\r\n\"northern part\" of the works, probably on the right of Fort Putnam;\r\nGay's was between Fort Box and the Marsh; Douglas watched the extreme\r\nright in the woods at the mouth of Gowanus Creek; and there was a\r\n\"reserve,\" which perhaps included among others the remnants of\r\nStirling's shattered brigade. Encircling them a mile or a mile and a\r\nhalf distant in the edge of the woods, lay the British army with tents\r\nalready pitched in many places. North and south of the Jamaica Road,\r\njust below Bedford, was Howe's main column; within and west of\r\nProspect Park were the Hessians; and on the right, Grant's division\r\nbivouacked along the Gowanus Road.]\r\n\r\nHad all things been relatively equal, the Americans within the lines,\r\naccording to military experience, should have been well able to hold\r\nthat front. But there was a total inequality of conditions. The enemy\r\nwere thoroughly equipped, disciplined, and provided for. They were an\r\narmy of professional soldiers, superior to any that could be brought\r\nagainst them the world over. Thus far they had carried everything\r\nbefore them, and were eager to achieve still greater victories. Behind\r\nthe Brooklyn works stood a poorly armed, badly officered, and for the\r\nmost part untrained mass of men, hurriedly gathered into the semblance\r\nof an army. The events of the previous day, moreover, had greatly\r\ndepressed their spirits. Not a few of those who had been engaged in or\r\nwitnessed the battle were badly demoralized. To make matters worse,\r\nthe very elements seemed to combine against them. The two days they\r\nwere still to remain on the island were days of \"extraordinary wet.\"\r\nIt rained almost continuously, and much of the time heavily. No fact\r\nis better attested than this. August 28th, writes Colonel Little,\r\n\"weather very rainy;\" \"29th, very rainy.\" Major Tallmadge speaks of\r\nthe fatigue as having been aggravated by the \"heavy rain.\" \"The heavy\r\nrain which fell two days and nights without intermission, etc.,\" said\r\nthe council which voted to retreat. Pastor Shewkirk in his diary notes\r\nthe weather particularly: \"Wednesday 28th,\" he writes, ... \"in the\r\nafternoon we had extraordinary heavy rains and thunder.\" The flashes\r\nof the cannons were intermixed with flashes of lightning. On the 29th,\r\n\"in the afternoon, such heavy rain fell again as can hardly be\r\nremembered.\" To all this deluge our soldiers were exposed with but\r\nlittle shelter. Necessity required that they should be at the lines,\r\nand constantly on the watch, ready to repel any attempt to storm them.\r\nWhen they lay down in the trenches at brief intervals for rest, they\r\nkept their arms from the wet as they could. Cooking was out of the\r\nquestion, and the men were compelled to take up with the unaccustomed\r\nfare of hard biscuits and raw pork. Their wretched plight is referred\r\nto in more than one of the letters of the day. Writes General Scott:\r\n\"You may judge of our situation, subject to almost incessant rains,\r\nwithout baggage or tents, and almost without victuals or drink, and in\r\nsome part of the lines the men were standing up to their middles in\r\nwater.\" Captain Olney puts it on record that \"the rain fell in such\r\ntorrents that the water was soon ankle deep in the fort. Yet with all\r\nthese inconveniences, and a powerful enemy just without musket-shot,\r\nour men could not be kept awake.\" Captain Graydon, of Shee's\r\nPennsylvanians, says in his well-known \"Memoirs:\" \"We had no tents to\r\nscreen us from the pitiless pelting, nor, if we had them, would it\r\nhave comported with the incessant vigilance required to have availed\r\nourselves of them, as, in fact, it might be said that we lay upon our\r\narms during the whole of our stay upon the island. In the article of\r\nfood we were little better off.\" Under the circumstances could\r\nWashington's force have withstood the shock of a determined assault by\r\nthe enemy?\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of weather, hunger, and fatigue, there was many a\r\nbrave man in the American camp who kept up heart and obeyed all orders\r\nwith spirit. One thing is certain, the British were not permitted to\r\nsuspect the distressed condition of our army. Our pickets and\r\nriflemen, thrown out in front of the works, put on a bold face. On the\r\n28th there was skirmishing the greater part of the day, and in the\r\nevening, as Washington reports, \"it was pretty smart.\" Writing from\r\nthe trenches on the 29th, Colonel Silliman says: \"Our enemy have\r\nencamped in plain sight of our camp at the distance of about a mile\r\nand a half. We have had no general engagement yet, but no day passes\r\nwithout some smart and hot skirmishes between different parties, in\r\nwhich the success is sometimes one way and sometimes another. We are\r\nin constant expectation of a general battle; no one can be here long\r\nwithout getting pretty well acquainted with the whistling of cannon\r\nand musket shot.\" Scarcely any particulars of these encounters[162]\r\nare preserved, though one of them, at least, appears to have been\r\nquite an important affair. The enemy had determined to approach the\r\nlines by regular siege rather than hazard an assault, and late in the\r\nafternoon of the 28th they advanced in some force to break ground for\r\nthe first parallel. The point selected was doubtless the high ground\r\nbetween Vanderbilt and Clinton avenues, on the line of De Kalb. As to\r\nwhat occurred we have but the briefest account, and that is from the\r\npen of Colonel Little. \"On the morning of the 28th,\" he writes, \"the\r\nenemy were encamped on the heights in front of our encampment. Firing\r\nwas kept up on both sides from the right to the left. Firing on both\r\nsides in front of Fort Putnam. About sunset the enemy pushed to\r\nrecover the ground we had taken (about 100 rods) in front of the fort.\r\nThe fire was very hot; the enemy gave way, and our people recovered\r\nthe ground. The firing ceased, and our people retired to the fort. The\r\nenemy took possession again, and on the morning of the 30th [29th] had\r\na breastwork there 60 rods long and 150 rods distant from Fort\r\nPutnam.\" It was this move of the British, more than any incident since\r\nthe battle, that determined Washington's future course.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: In vol. ii. of the L.I. Hist. Society's \"Memoirs,\" the\r\nauthor, Mr. Field, devotes pages 254-258 to the skirmishing of some\r\nConnecticut soldiers on the extreme right on the other side of Gowanus\r\nCreek, which appears to him to have been rash and foolhardy, and\r\nstrangely in contrast with what also appears to him to have been an\r\nexhibition of cowardice on their part the day before. The narrative\r\nfrom which the incidents are taken (Martin's) shows no such singular\r\ninconsistency in the conduct of these men. This was Colonel Douglas'\r\nregiment, and, as Martin himself says, it moved promptly under orders\r\nfrom the ferry to the right to cover Stirling's retreat. \"Our\r\nofficers,\" he writes, \"pressed forward towards a creek, where a large\r\nparty of Americans and British were engaged.\" They very properly did\r\nnot halt to help a company of artillerymen drag their pieces along.\r\nThe skirmish on the following day was nothing remarkable in its way.\r\nIt was just such brushes as the men engaged in that Washington, on\r\nGraydon's authority, encouraged. The regiment displayed no particular\r\nrashness on the 28th, nor any cowardice on the 27th--that is, if\r\nMartin is to be credited.]\r\n\r\nDuring all these trying hours since the defeat on the 27th, the most\r\nconspicuous figure to be seen, now at one point and now at another of\r\nthe threatened lines, was that of the commander-in-chief. Wherever his\r\ninspiring presence seemed necessary, there he was to be found. He\r\ncheered the troops night and day. All that the soldiers endured, he\r\nendured. For forty-eight hours, or the whole of the 28th and 29th, he\r\ntook no rest whatever, and was hardly once off his horse. As he rode\r\namong the men in the storm he spoke to some in person, and everywhere\r\nhe gave directions, while his aids were as tireless as their Chief in\r\nassisting him.\r\n\r\nBut circumstanced as the army was, it was inevitable that the question\r\nshould come up: Can the defence of the Brooklyn front be continued\r\nwithout great hazard? It could not have escaped the notice of a single\r\nsoldier on that side, that if, with the river in their rear, the enemy\r\nshould succeed in penetrating the lines, or the fleet be able to\r\ncommand the crossing, they would all be lost. There was no safety but\r\nin retreat; and for twenty-four hours from the morning of the 29th,\r\nall the energies of the commander-in-chief were directed towards\r\nmaking the retreat successful.\r\n\r\nTo few incidents of the Revolution does greater interest attach than\r\nto this final scene in the operations on Long Island. The formal\r\ndecision to abandon this point was made by a council of war, held late\r\nin the day of the 29th, at the house of Phillip Livingston, then\r\nabsent as a member of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia. The\r\nmansion made historic by this event stood on the line of Hicks Street,\r\njust south of Joralemon.[163] There were present at the council, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Major-Generals Putnam and Spencer, and\r\nBrigadier-Generals Mifflin, McDougall, Parsons, Scott, Wadsworth, and\r\nFellows. As far as known, Scott alone of these generals has left us\r\nany thing in regard to what transpired on the occasion beyond the\r\nfinal result. He preserves the interesting fact that when the\r\nproposition to retreat was presented it took him by surprise and he as\r\nsuddenly objected to it, \"from an aversion to giving the enemy a\r\nsingle inch of ground.\" It was the soil of his own State. As a member\r\nof the New York Convention and of the Committee of Safety, and now as\r\na general officer, he had spent months in uninterrupted preparations\r\nto defend that soil, and on the first impulse of the moment the\r\nthought of yielding any more of it to the invaders was not to be\r\nentertained. But he was soon \"convinced by unanswerable reasons,\" and\r\nthe vote of the council was unanimous for retreat. Eight separate\r\nreasons were embodied in the decision. _First._ A defeat had been\r\nsustained on the 27th, and the woods lost where it was proposed to\r\nmake \"a principal stand.\" _Second._ The loss in officers and men had\r\noccasioned great confusion and discouragement among the troops.\r\n_Third._ The rain had injured the arms and much of the ammunition, and\r\nthe soldiers were so worn out, that it was feared that they could not\r\nbe kept at the lines by any order. _Fourth._ The enemy appeared to be\r\nendeavoring to get their ships into the East River to cut off\r\ncommunication with New York, but the wind as yet had not served them.\r\n_Fifth._ There were no obstructions sunk in the Channel between Long\r\nand Governor's Island, and the council was assured by General\r\nMcDougall, \"from his own nautic experience,\" that small ships could\r\nsail up by that channel; the hulks, also, sunk between Governor's\r\nIsland and the Battery were regarded as insufficient obstructions for\r\nthat passage. _Sixth._ Though the lines were fortified by several\r\nstrong redoubts, the breastworks were weak, being \"abattised with\r\nbrush\" only in some places, and the enemy might break through them.\r\n_Seventh._ The divided state of the army made a defence precarious.\r\n_Eighth._ Several British men-of-war had worked their way into\r\nFlushing Bay from the Sound, and with their assistance the enemy could\r\ncross a force to the mainland in Westchester County, and gain the\r\nAmerican rear in the vicinity of King's Bridge. In view of these\r\nconsiderations a retreat was considered imperative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: See _Document_ 6, in which General Scott says: \"I was\r\nsummoned to a council of war at Mr. Phillip Livingston's house on\r\nThursday, 29th ult., etc.\"]\r\n\r\nThis was the official record of the council's action as afterwards\r\ntransmitted to Congress. It is not to be inferred, however, that\r\nretreat was not thought of, or that nothing was done to effect it\r\nuntil the council met. That Washington had foreseen the necessity of\r\nthe move, that he discussed it with others, and that he had already\r\nbegun the necessary preparations, is obvious both from the record and\r\nfrom all that occurred during the day. The council did no more than to\r\ncoincide in his views and confirm his judgment.[164]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: ORIGIN OF THE RETREAT.--Precisely when and why\r\nWashington came to a determination in his own mind to retreat has been\r\nmade the subject of a somewhat nice historical inquiry. Gordon gives\r\none story; Mr. William B. Reed, biographer of Colonel Reed, gives\r\nanother; and Mr. Bancroft, General Carrington, and others indulge in\r\nmore or less extended criticisms on the point. Gordon's account is the\r\nmost probable and the best supported.\r\n\r\nWhatever Washington may have thought of the situation on Long Island\r\nafter the defeat, it is enough to know that he immediately reinforced\r\nhimself there, and that on the 27th and 28th he made no preparations\r\nto withdraw to New York. It far from follows, however, that he had\r\nconcluded to stay and fight it out \"on that line\" at all hazards. He\r\nwas acting on the defensive, and was necessarily obliged to guide\r\nhimself largely by the movements of the enemy. On Long Island,\r\ntherefore, he could only be on the watch, and, like a prudent general,\r\ndecide according to circumstances. Up to the morning of the 29th he\r\nwas still watching--watching not only the enemy, but his own army\r\nalso. In his letter to Congress, written at \"half after 4 o'clock\r\nA.M.\" of this date, he gives no intimation of a retreat, but rather\r\nleaves that body to infer that he proposed to remain where he was. He\r\nspeaks, for instance, of expecting tents during the day to make the\r\ntroops more comfortable. On the same morning Reed wrote: \"We hope to\r\nbe able to make a good stand, as our lines are pretty strong;\" and he\r\ndoubtless reflected the views of his Chief at the time.\r\n\r\nThe two particular dangers now to which the army was exposed were the\r\ndanger of having its communication with New York cut off by the ships,\r\nand the danger of being approached by the enemy in front by siege\r\noperations, which the army was not prepared to meet. The first danger\r\nhad existed ever since the arrival of the enemy, and had been provided\r\nfor. All the batteries on Governor's Island and on both sides of the\r\nEast River had been built to guard against it. In addition, ships had\r\nbeen sunk in the channel. Washington accordingly must have thoroughly\r\ncanvassed the risks he ran in regard to his communications. _These\r\nalone had not decided him to retreat._ On the morning of the 29th,\r\nhowever, he first became aware of the second danger. It was not until\r\nthen that the enemy fully developed their intention of advancing by\r\ntrenches. After working all night, as Howe reports, they had thrown up\r\nby morning, as Little reports, a parallel sixty rods long and one\r\nhundred and fifty rods distant from Fort Putnam. Reed wrote, \"They are\r\nintrenching at a small distance.\" In twenty-four hours at the farthest\r\nthey would have come within very close range, and the hazardous\r\nalternative would have been forced upon us to attempt to drive them\r\nout of their own works. Washington well knew that, in view of the\r\ncondition of his men and the great disparity of numbers, this could\r\nnot be done. When, therefore, he became assured of Howe's intentions\r\nhe acted promptly--_he determined to retreat_; and this determination\r\nhe reached early on the morning of the 29th.\r\n\r\nThis is substantially the theory which Gordon presents as a fact, and\r\nit is most consistent with fact. Gordon's account is this: \"The\r\nvictorious army encamped in the front of the American works in the\r\nevening; and on the 28th at night broke ground in form about 4 or 500\r\nyards distant from a redoubt which covered the left of the Americans.\r\nThe same day Gen. Mifflin crossed over from New York with 1000 men; at\r\nnight he made an offer to Gen. Washington of going the rounds, which\r\nwas accepted. He observed the approaches of the enemy, and the\r\nforwardness of their batteries; and was convinced that no time was to\r\nbe lost. The next morning he conversed with the General upon the\r\nsubject, and said, 'You must either fight or retreat immediately. What\r\nis your strength?' The General answered, 'Nine thousand.' The other\r\nreplied, 'It is not sufficient, we must therefore retreat.' They were\r\nboth agreed as to the calling of a Council of war; and Gen. Mifflin\r\nwas to propose a retreat. But as he was to make that proposal, lest\r\nhis own character should suffer, he stipulated, that if a retreat\r\nshould be agreed upon, he would command the rear; and if an action the\r\nvan.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that Mifflin was given the command of the rear on the\r\nretreat, and the fact that he sent the order to Heath that morning to\r\nsend down all the boats from King's Bridge, lend the highest\r\nprobability to Gordon's version of the story. Parsons, who was one of\r\nthe members of the council, mentions this particularly as one of the\r\nreasons for withdrawing, namely, that the enemy were \"not disposed to\r\nstorm our lines, but set down to make regular approaches to us.\" Reed\r\nalso puts as much stress on this point as any other. Giving the\r\nreasons for the retreat to Governor Livingston, he said: \"The enemy at\r\nthe same time possessed themselves of a piece of ground very\r\nadvantageous and which they had [fortified]. We were therefore reduced\r\nto the alternative of retiring to this place or going out with\r\n[troops] to drive them off.\" Washington, too, is to be quoted. In his\r\nletter to Trumbull, September 6th, he writes: \"As the main body of the\r\nenemy had encamped not far from our lines, and as I had reason to\r\nbelieve they intended to force us from them by regular approaches,\r\nwhich the nature of the ground favoured extremely, and at the same\r\ntime meant, by the ships of war, to cut off the communication between\r\nthe City and Island, and by that means keep our men divided and unable\r\nto oppose them anywhere, by the advice of the General officers, on the\r\nnight of the 29th, I withdrew our troops from thence without any loss\r\nof men and but little baggage.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Reed's account (Reed's Life of Reed) is to the effect,\r\nbriefly, that a heavy fog settled over Long Island on the 29th, and\r\nthat during the day Colonel Reed, Colonel Grayson, and General Mifflin\r\nrode to Red Hook inspecting the lines. While at the Hook, \"a shift of\r\nwind\" cleared the fog from the harbor, enabling the officers to catch\r\na glimpse of the fleet at the Narrows. From certain movements of boats\r\nthey inferred that the ships would sail up with the favorable breeze\r\nif it held until the tide turned and the fog cleared off. They\r\nimmediately hurried to Washington, informed him of the impending\r\ndanger, and induced him to call a council and order a retreat. Mr.\r\nBancroft, however, has shown very thoroughly that this account cannot\r\nbe accepted, because the fog did not come up until the morning of the\r\n30th, and no change of wind occurred. Colonel Reed himself says in the\r\nLivingston letter, written only the next morning, that the enemy's\r\nfleet were attempting every day to get up to town with \"the wind\r\n_ahead_\"--thus directly contradicting his biographer. The Reed account\r\nhas several errors of detail, one being the statement that the Red\r\nHook battery had been badly damaged by the guns of the Roebuck on the\r\n27th. It would be nearer the truth to say that it was not hit at all.\r\nThe fleet could do nothing that day; as Admiral Howe reports, the\r\nRoebuck was \"the only ship that could fetch high enough to the\r\nnorthward to exchange _a few random shot_ with the battery on Red\r\nHook.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, Washington, after receiving Mifflin's report in regard to\r\nthe approaches of the enemy, and probably other reports from Grayson,\r\nReed, and others in regard to the general condition of the troops (for\r\ninstance, Colonel Shee's uneasiness, referred to by Graydon), found\r\nthat the moment had come for decision. That decision was to retreat\r\nthat night; and during the forenoon, several hours before the council\r\nmet, he issued secret orders for the concentration of boats at the\r\nferry, as described in the text.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing necessary was to provide all the transportation\r\navailable in order to accomplish the retreat in the shortest time\r\npossible after beginning it. There were boats at the Brooklyn ferry\r\nand across at New York, but these were too few for the purpose.\r\nAccordingly, on the forenoon of the 29th, Washington sent an order\r\nthrough Mifflin to General Heath at King's Bridge to the following\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n     LONG ISLAND, August 29th, 1776.\r\n\r\n     DEAR GENERAL--We have many battalions from New Jersey which\r\n     are coming over to relieve others here. You will please\r\n     therefore to order every flat bottomed boat and other craft\r\n     at your post, fit for transporting troops, down to New York\r\n     as soon as possible. They must be manned by some of Colonel\r\n     Hutchinson's men and sent without the least delay. I write\r\n     by order of the General. I am Affectionately Yours\r\n\r\n     MIFFLIN.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, Colonel Trumbull, the commissary-general, was\r\ndirected to carry a verbal order to Assistant Quartermaster Hughes at\r\nNew York, \"to impress every kind of water craft from Hell Gate on the\r\nSound to Spuyten Duyvil Creek that could be kept afloat and that had\r\neither sails or oars, and have them all in the east harbor of the City\r\nby dark.\"[165] These two orders were carried out with great energy,\r\npromptness, and secrecy by all who had any part in their execution.\r\nHeath \"immediately complied\" with what Mifflin had written, and sent\r\ndown all his boats under Hutchinson's men from Salem, who, like\r\nGlover's from Marblehead, were, many of them, the best of sailors. He\r\nbrooked the less delay, perhaps, because he saw at once that\r\nWashington's \"real intention\" was, not to be reinforced from New\r\nJersey, but to retreat from Long Island.[166] Hughes, on his part, was\r\nuntiring, and rendered the greatest service. He would have been\r\nmistaken this day rather for the master of a military school, than for\r\nwhat he had been--the master of a classical one. For twenty-two hours,\r\nas his biographer tells us, he never dismounted from his horse, but\r\nsuperintended the collection of the vessels from all points, and at\r\nevening had them ready for their purpose.[167]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Memorial of Colonel Hugh Hughes. Leake's Life of\r\nGeneral Lamb.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: Heath's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: There is an interesting letter of Washington's\r\npreserved in the Hughes Memorial, which adds light on this point.\r\nEight years after the event, when Hughes needed some official\r\ncertificate showing his authority to impress all the craft he could\r\nfind, the general replied to him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My memory is not charged with the particulars of the verbal order\r\nwhich you say was delivered to you through Col. Joseph Trumbull, on\r\nthe 27th, August, 1776, 'for impressing all the sloops, boats, and\r\nwater craft from Spyhten Duyvel, in the Hudson, to Hell Gate, in the\r\nSound.' I recollect that it was a day which required the utmost\r\nexertion, particularly in the Quarter-Master's department, to\r\naccomplish the retreat which was intended, under cover of the\r\nsucceeding night; and that no delay or ceremony could be admitted in\r\nthe execution of the plan. I have no doubt, therefore, of your having\r\nreceived orders to the effect, and to the extent which you have\r\nmentioned; and you are at liberty to adduce this in testimony thereof.\r\nIt will, I presume, supply the place of a more formal certificate, and\r\nis more consonant with my recollection of the transactions of that\r\nday.\" It appears from this that Washington remembered that the _entire\r\nday_ of the 29th was devoted to planning and preparing for the\r\nretreat, and this fits the theory advanced in the note on the \"Origin\r\nof the Retreat.\" As to the delivery of the orders about boats, it is\r\nprobable that Trumbull crossed to New York with Mifflin's letter to\r\nHeath and gave it to Hughes to forward. At the same time he gave\r\nHughes his instructions verbally. Hughes received them, says his\r\nbiographer, about noon. He then had eight hours to carry them out,\r\nwhich gave him time to send to Heath and for Heath to comply, while he\r\nand his assistants scoured the coast everywhere else for boats, from\r\nHell Gate down. Among other sloops impressed was the Middlesex,\r\nCaptain Stephen Hogeboom, while on its way to Claverack. \"I was\r\nprevented from proceeding,\" says the captain, \"by Coll Wardsworth and\r\nCommissary Hughes who ordered your memorialist over with the sloop to\r\nLong Island ferry where she was used to carry off the Troops and\r\nstores after the unfortunate retreat, &c.\"--_N.Y. Hist. MS._, vol. i.,\r\np. 620.]\r\n\r\nThe final withdrawal of the troops from the lines was effected under\r\nthe cover of a plausible general order, which was the only one known\r\nto have been issued by the commander-in-chief while on Long\r\nIsland.[168] This order now comes to light for the first time, and is\r\nimportant as serving to correct the improbable though standard theory\r\nthat the regiments were moved from their posts under the impression\r\nthat they were to make a night attack upon the enemy.[169] The order\r\nas actually given was far more rational, and less likely to excite\r\nsuspicion as to its true intent. In the first place, the sick, \"being\r\nan encumbrance to the army\" were directed to be sent to the hospital,\r\ntheir arms and accoutrements taken with them, and from there to be\r\nconveyed across to New York and reported to Surgeon-General Morgan. In\r\nthe next place, the order announced that troops under General Mercer\r\nwere expected that afternoon from New Jersey, with whom it was\r\nproposed to relieve a proportionate number of the regiments on Long\r\nIsland, and \"make a change in the situation of them.\" In view of the\r\ndistressed condition of most of the troops at the lines, the propriety\r\nof such a \"change\" was obvious; and in all probability Washington did\r\noriginally intend to make the relief. And last, as it was apparently\r\nundecided what regiments were to be relieved, they were all, or the\r\ngreater part of them, directed \"to parade with their arms,\r\naccoutrements, and knapsacks, at 7 o'clock, at the head of their\r\nencampments and there wait for orders.\" On the evening of the 29th,\r\naccordingly, we find the troops ready at their camps and the lines to\r\nmarch off at a moment's notice, and all prepared for a retreat by the\r\nmost natural arrangement that could have been devised to conceal the\r\nreal design.[170]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Document_ 3. \"General Orders. Head-Quarters Long\r\nIsland, Aug. 29, 1776. Parole, _Sullivan_, Countersign,\r\n_Greene_.\"--_Col. Douglas' Order Book._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: All our principal accounts follow Graydon, who states\r\nthat the order to attack the enemy was given \"regimentally.\" Colonel\r\nHand, in his letter describing the night's incidents (Reed's Life of\r\nReed), makes no allusion to such an order, but on the contrary states\r\nthat he and the other colonels of the covering party were told that\r\nthey were to retreat. An order to attack would have been a poor\r\ndisguise for a retreat, for every man must have felt its utter\r\nrashness and at once suspected some other move.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: A letter from Tilghman, Washington's aid, shows that\r\nthe troops received the impression that they were to be relieved. The\r\nretreat, he says, \"was conducted with so much Secrecy that neither\r\nSubalterns or privates knew that the whole army was to cross back\r\nagain to N. York; they thought only a few regiments were to go\r\nback.\"--_Document_ 29.]\r\n\r\nAt dark, the withdrawal began. As one regiment moved away towards the\r\nferry another would have its situation \"changed\" to fill the gap, or\r\nextended from right to left. Every move at first was conducted busily,\r\nyet quietly and without confusion. Colonel Little, referring to his\r\npart this night, leaves the simple record that the general ordered\r\neach regiment to be paraded on their own parades at seven o'clock\r\nP.M., and wait for orders. \"We received orders,\" he says, \"to strike\r\nour tents and march, with our baggage, to New York.\" Colonel Douglas\r\nwrites: \"I received orders to call in my guard _all_, and march\r\nimmediately with the utmost silence.\" Hitchcock's Rhode Islanders\r\ncarried their baggage and camp equipage to the boats on their\r\nshoulders \"through mud and mire and not a ray of light visible.\" The\r\nembarkation was made from the ferry--the present Fulton Ferry--where\r\nGeneral McDougall superintended the movements. Between seven and eight\r\no'clock the boats were manned by Glover's and Hutchinson's men, and\r\nthey went to work with sailor-like cheer and despatch. The militia and\r\nlevies were the first to cross, though there was some vexing delay in\r\ngetting them off. Unluckily, too, about nine o'clock the adverse wind\r\nand tide and pouring rain began to make the navigation of the river\r\ndifficult. A north-easter sprang up, and Glover's men could do nothing\r\nwith the sloops and sail-boats. If the row-boats only were to be\r\ndepended upon, all the troops could not be ferried over before\r\nmorning. Discouraged at the prospect, McDougall sent Colonel Grayson,\r\nof Washington's staff, to inform the general as to how matters stood,\r\nbut unable to find him Grayson returned, and McDougall went on with\r\nthe embarkation in spite of its difficulties. Most fortunately,\r\nhowever, at eleven o'clock there was another and a favorable change in\r\nthe weather. The north-east wind died away, and soon after a gentle\r\nbreeze set in from the south-west, of which the sailors took quick\r\nadvantage, and the passage was now \"direct, easy, and expeditious.\"\r\nThe troops were pushed across as fast as possible in every variety of\r\ncraft--row-boats, flat-boats, whale-boats, pettiaugers, sloops, and\r\nsail-boats--some of which were loaded to within three inches of the\r\nwater, which was \"as smooth as glass.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [signature: J.W. Glover]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL FOURTEENTH REGIMENT OF FOOT (MASS.) BRIGADIER GENERAL 1777.\r\n\r\nSteel Engr. F. von Egloffstein N.Y.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile nearly a fatal blunder occurred at the lines. Early in the\r\nevening, a force had been selected, consisting of Hand's, Smallwood's,\r\nHaslet's, Shee's, Magaw's, and Chester's regiments, to remain at the\r\nworks to the last and cover the retreat. General Mifflin commanded the\r\nparty. Smallwood's men were stationed in Fort Putnam, part of Hand's\r\nunder Captain Miller in the redoubt on the left, and the rest at the\r\nlines on the right of the main road; and the other regiments near\r\nthem. Brooklyn Church was to be the alarm-post, where the covering\r\nparty was to concentrate in case the enemy attacked during the night.\r\nAbout two o'clock in the morning, Major Scammell, one of Sullivan's\r\naids now serving with Washington, mistook his orders and started\r\nMifflin's entire command for the ferry. All the regiments had left the\r\nlines and were marching down the main road, when Washington, who\r\nseemed to be everywhere during the night, met them and exclaimed in\r\nastonishment that unless the lines were immediately re-manned \"the\r\nmost disagreeable consequences\" might follow, as every thing then\r\nwas in confusion at the ferry. Mifflin's party promptly faced about\r\nand reoccupied their stations until dawn, when Providence again\r\n\"interposed in favor of the retreating army.\" To have attempted to\r\nwithdraw in clear daylight would have been a hazardous experiment for\r\nthese regiments, but just before dawn a heavy fog began to settle over\r\nLong Island, and the covering party was safe. So dense was this\r\n\"heavenly messenger,\" as Gordon happily describes it, that it\r\neffectually hid the American lines from the British pickets. When the\r\nfinal order, therefore, came about sunrise for Mifflin's men to retire\r\nto the ferry, they were enabled to do so under cover of the fog\r\nwithout exciting any suspicion of their movements in the enemy's\r\ncamp.[171] \"We kept up fires, with outposts stationed,\" says\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Chambers, \"until all the rest were over. We left\r\nthe lines after it was fair day and then came off.\" As our soldiers\r\nwithdrew they distinctly heard the sound of pickaxe and shovel at the\r\nBritish works.[172] Before seven o'clock the entire force had crossed\r\nto New York, and among the last to leave was the commander-in-chief.\r\n\"General Washington,\" adds Chambers, \"saw the last over himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Mr. Reed, the biographer, states that the fog rose on\r\nthe 29th. Dr. Stiles, in his \"History of Brooklyn,\" says: \"At midnight\r\na dense fog arose, which remained motionless and impenetrable over the\r\nisland during the whole of the next day [the 29th].\" \"A dense fog,\"\r\nwrites Mr. Field, \"hung over the island and river, when the morning of\r\nthe 29th dawned.\" Now nothing is more certain than that the fog did\r\nnot rise until shortly before dawn of the 30th, full six hours after\r\nthe retreat had begun. The 28th and 29th, as already seen, were days\r\nof rain-storms, not mist, nor fog, but storm, \"torrents,\" such rain at\r\ntimes the like of which could \"hardly be remembered.\" Contemporary\r\nwriters who mention the rains say nothing of fog on the 29th, whereas\r\nthey do notice its appearance the next morning. Major Tallmadge\r\nwrites: \"As the dawn of the next day approached, those of us who\r\nremained in the trenches became very anxious for our own safety, and\r\nwhen the dawn appeared, there were several regiments still on duty. At\r\nthis time a very dense fog began to rise, and it seemed to settle in a\r\npeculiar manner over both encampments. I recollect this peculiar\r\nprovidential occurrence perfectly well; and so very dense was the\r\natmosphere that I could scarcely discern a man at six yards'\r\ndistance.\" This officer's regiment was one of the covering party, and\r\nhe adds that after leaving the lines by mistake, and receiving orders\r\nto return, \"Col. Chester immediately faced to the right about and\r\nreturned, where we tarried until the sun had risen, but the fog\r\nremained as dense as ever.\" \"At sunrise a great fog came up,\" says a\r\nspectator (_Stiles' MS. Diary_). An officer or soldier of either\r\nShee's or Magaw's regiment, also of the covering party, wrote a few\r\nhours after crossing: \"We received orders to quit our station about\r\ntwo o'clock this morning, and had made our retreat almost to the ferry\r\nwhen Gen. Washington ordered us back to that part of the lines we were\r\nfirst at, which was reckoned to be the most dangerous post. We got\r\nback undiscovered by the enemy, and continued there until daylight.\r\nProvidentially for us, a great fog arose, which prevented the enemy\r\nfrom seeing our retreat from their works which was not more than\r\nmusket shot from us.\"--_Force_, 5th Series, vol. i., p. 1233. So also,\r\nStedman, the British historian, referring to the events of the night\r\nof the 29th-30th, says: \"Another remarkable circumstance was, that on\r\nLong Island hung a thick fog, which prevented the British troops from\r\ndiscovering the operations of the enemy.\" Washington did not, as often\r\nstated in popular accounts, take advantage of a fog to cover his\r\nretreat. More than half the army was over before the fog appeared; but\r\nit protected the covering party, and saved us the loss of considerable\r\nbaggage and other material.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: An English patrol under Captain Montressor discovered\r\nthe retreat of the Americans very soon after the latter left the\r\nlines, and reported the fact at once. But for some unexplained reason\r\npursuit was delayed until too late. One boat with four stragglers was\r\ntaken by the enemy.]\r\n\r\nBy the army the retreat was welcomed as a great relief, a salvation\r\nfrom probable calamity. Not a few appreciated its completeness and\r\nsuccess as a strictly military move. \"This evacuation,\" writes one,\r\n\"is a masterpiece.\" \"That grand retreat from the Island which will\r\never reflect honour to our Generals,\" says another. \"Considering the\r\ndifficulties,\" is Greene's criticism, \"it was the best effected\r\nretreat I ever read or heard of.\" \"It was executed,\" says Scott, \"with\r\nunexpected success.\" But in the country at large it was generally\r\nassociated with the defeat of the 27th, and the skilfulness with which\r\nit was conducted little compensated for the fact that the retreat was\r\nforced upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF NEW YORK--KIP'S BAY AFFAIR--BATTLE OF HARLEM HEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Island surrendered, could New York be held? Columbia Heights,\r\nwhere Fort Stirling stood, had been regarded by Lee as the \"capital\r\npoint,\" the key of the position. Greene called the Brooklyn front \"the\r\npass,\" on the possession of which depended the security of the city.\r\nBoth pass and heights were now in the enemy's hands, and New York was\r\nat their mercy. \"We are in hourly expectation,\" wrote Commissary\r\nTrumbull, September 1st, \"that the town will be bombarded.\" Lieutenant\r\nJasper Ewing, of Hand's riflemen, saw that the British could reduce\r\nthe place to \"a heap of ashes\" in a day's time. Colonel Douglas looked\r\nfor an immediate cannonade from Fort Stirling, \"which,\" he says, \"I\r\nhave the mortification to think I helped build myself.\" But the enemy\r\nkept their guns quiet, as they wished neither to injure the city nor\r\ndrive our army away. They contented themselves at first with\r\nstretching their troops along the water front from Red Hook to Hell\r\nGate, Newtown, and Flushing on Long Island, and threatening to land at\r\nany point on Manhattan Island from the Battery to Harlem, or beyond on\r\nthe Westchester shore.\r\n\r\nAs for Washington, the successful retreat had not in the least\r\nrelieved him from care or anxiety. He had escaped one trap: it was of\r\nthe utmost consequence now to see that he did not fall into another.\r\nWhat he feared most was a sudden move upon his rear in Westchester\r\nCounty, for in that case he would be hopelessly hemmed in on Manhattan\r\nIsland. \"The enemy,\" continued Trumbull on the 1st, \"are drawing their\r\nmen to the eastward on Long Island, as if they intended to throw a\r\nstrong party over on this island, near Hell Gate, so as to get on the\r\nback of the city. We are preparing to meet them.\" Haslet wrote August\r\n31st: \"I expect every moment orders to march off to Kingsbridge to\r\nprevent the enemy crossing the East River and confining us on another\r\nnook.... If they can coop us up in N. York by intrenching from river\r\nto river, horrid will be the consequences from their command of the\r\nrivers.\" General Heath pressed the matter of watching the Westchester\r\ncoast, and Washington, concurring with him \"as to the probability of\r\nthe enemy's endeavoring to land their forces at Hunt's Point,\" above\r\nHell Gate, wrote him on the 31st: \"In order to prevent such an attempt\r\nfrom being carried into execution I have sent up General Mifflin with\r\nthe troops he brought from your quarters, strengthened by\r\nreinforcements. With this assistance I hope you will be able to defeat\r\ntheir intentions. I beg you will exert yourself to the utmost of your\r\nabilities on this momentous occasion.\" Several days passing without\r\nany demonstration by the enemy, Washington's suspense was only\r\nprotracted, and on September 5th he wrote again to Heath as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"As everything in a manner depends upon obtaining\r\n     intelligence of the enemy's motions, I do most earnestly\r\n     entreat you and General Clinton to exert yourselves to\r\n     accomplish this most desirable end. Leave no stone\r\n     unturned, nor do not stick at expense to bring this to pass,\r\n     as I never was more uneasy than on account of my want of\r\n     knowledge on this score.\r\n\r\n     \"Keep, besides this precaution, constant lookouts (with good\r\n     glasses) on some commanding heights that look well on to the\r\n     other shore (and especially into the bays, where boats can\r\n     be concealed), that they may observe, more particularly in\r\n     the evening, if there be any uncommon movements. Much will\r\n     depend upon early intelligence, and meeting the enemy before\r\n     they can intrench. I should much approve of small harassing\r\n     parties, stealing, as it were, over in the night, as they\r\n     might keep the enemy alarmed, and more than probably bring\r\n     off a prisoner, from whom some valuable intelligence may be\r\n     obtained.\"[173]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: \"The Heath Correspondence,\" Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.,\r\n1878.]\r\n\r\nTo add to his burdens, the commander-in-chief found the condition of\r\nhis army growing worse instead of improving. The experiences on Long\r\nIsland had disheartened many of the troops, and their escape had not\r\nrevived their spirits.[174] The militia became impatient and went home\r\nin groups and whole companies, and indeed in such numbers as to\r\nmaterially diminish the strength of the army. To restore order and\r\nconfidence, Washington exerted himself to the utmost. Tilghman, one of\r\nhis aids, speaks of \"the vast hurry of business\" in which the general\r\nwas engaged at this time. \"He is obliged,\" he writes, \"to see into,\r\nand in a manner fill every department, which is too much for one man.\"\r\nTo Rodney, Haslet wrote: \"I fear Genl Washington has too heavy a\r\ntask, assisted mostly by beardless boys.\"[175] But fortunately for the\r\ncountry the general's shoulders were broad enough for these great\r\nduties, and his faith and resolution remained unshaken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Pastor Shewkirk notes in his diary that immediately\r\nafter the retreat \"a general damp\" seemed to spread over the army.\r\n\"The merry tones on drums and fifes had ceased, and they were hardly\r\nheard for a couple of days.\" The wet clothes, accoutrements, and tents\r\nwere lying about in front of the houses and in the streets, and every\r\nthing was in confusion. But this was to be expected. General Scott,\r\nreferring evidently to expressions heard among his own men, says that\r\nsome declared that they had been \"sold out,\" and others longed to have\r\nLee back from the South.--_Scott's MS. Letter_, September 6th, 1776.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Washington's aids were most of them quite young men.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible the army was reorganized and stationed to meet the\r\nnew phase of the situation. Several changes were made in the brigades,\r\nand the whole divided into three grand divisions, under Putnam,\r\nSpencer, and Heath. Putnam's, consisting of five brigades, remained in\r\nthe city and guarded the East River above as far as Fifteenth Street;\r\nSpencer's, of six brigades, took up the line from that point to Horn's\r\nHook and Harlem; and Heath with two brigades watched King's Bridge and\r\nthe Westchester shore. Greene had not sufficiently recovered from his\r\nillness, and his old troops, under Nixon and Heard, were temporarily\r\ndoing duty with Spencer's command.[176] This disposition was effected\r\nby the 2d of September, and by it our army again occupied an extended\r\nline, endeavoring to protect every point on the east side from the\r\nbattery to King's Bridge, or the entire length of the island, a\r\ndistance of fourteen and a half miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: A large number of changes were made in the organization\r\nof the army after the retreat. The Connecticut militia were divided up\r\nand formed into brigades with the levies under General Wadsworth,\r\nColonel Silliman, Colonel Douglas, and Colonel Chester. A brigade was\r\ngiven also to Colonel Sargent, of Massachusetts. Putnam's division\r\nincluded Parsons', Scott's, James Clinton's (Glover's), Fellows', and\r\nSilliman's brigades; Spencer's and Greene's divisions included\r\nNixon's, Heard's, McDougall's, Wadsworth's, Douglas', Chester's and\r\nSargent's brigades; while Heath had his former brigades, with a change\r\nof some regiments, under Mifflin and George Clinton.]\r\n\r\nThe question of abandoning New York and all that part of the island\r\nbelow Harlem Heights was, meanwhile, under consideration. The city\r\nwould obviously be untenable under a bombardment, and the island\r\nequally so if the British crossed into Westchester County. Yet\r\nWashington, strangely, we may say, expressed the conviction that he\r\ncould hold both provided his troops could be depended upon.[177] Among\r\nhis generals, Greene earnestly opposed any such attempt, and advocated\r\nthe evacuation and destruction of the place. \"The City and Island of\r\nNew York,\" he wrote to his chief, September 5th, \"are no objects for\r\nus; we are not to bring them into competition with the general\r\ninterests of America.... The sacrifice of the vast property of New\r\nYork and the suburbs, I hope has no influence on your Excellency's\r\nmeasures. Remember the King of France. When Charles the Fifth, Emperor\r\nof Germany, invaded his Kingdom, he laid whole Provinces waste; and by\r\nthat policy he starved and ruined Charles's army, and defeated him\r\nwithout fighting a battle. Two-thirds of the property of the City of\r\nNew York and the suburbs belong to the tories. We have no very great\r\nreason to run any considerable risk for its defence.... I would give\r\nit as my opinion that a general and speedy retreat is absolutely\r\nnecessary, and that the honour and interest of America require it. I\r\nwould burn the city.\" John Jay before this also proposed its\r\ndestruction. Scott urged abandonment of the place for sound military\r\nreasons, though the move would ruin him. Washington, however, on the\r\n2d, presented the whole question to Congress. Also convinced by the\r\ncondition of the army, that the city must be evacuated, he asked, \"If\r\nwe should be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to stand as winter\r\nquarters for the enemy?\" Congress voted, in reply, that \"it should in\r\nno event be damaged, for they had no doubt of being able to recover\r\nit, even though the enemy should obtain possession of it for a time.\"\r\nOn the 7th, a council of war, inferring that Congress wished the place\r\nto be held, decided to retain five thousand troops in the city and\r\nconcentrate the rest around and above Harlem; but on the 12th the\r\nmatter was reconsidered, and a second council voted to evacuate the\r\ncity and retire to Harlem Heights. The removal of stores and the sick\r\nhad already commenced; and on the 14th, when the enemy appeared to be\r\non the point of crossing from Montressor's, now Randall's, Island to\r\nthe mainland, all the teams and wagons that could be found were\r\nimpressed by the quartermasters to remove the remaining stores. In one\r\nday more the removal would have been complete and the troops all\r\nwithdrawn to the heights. In the evening of the 14th Washington left\r\nthe city, and established his headquarters at the Morris Mansion, at\r\nOne Hundred and Sixty-first Street, overlooking Harlem River and the\r\nplains.[178]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: \"Till of late I had no doubt in my own mind of\r\ndefending this place, nor should I have yet, if the men would do their\r\nduty, but this I despair of. It is painful, and extremely grating to\r\nme, to give such unfavorable accounts; but it would be criminal to\r\nconceal the truth at so critical a juncture.\"--_Washington to\r\nCongress_, September 2d, 1776.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Colonel Reed, the adjutant-general, wrote to his wife,\r\nSeptember 14th, from New York: \"My baggage is all at King's bridge. We\r\nexpect to remove thither this evening. I mean our headquarters.\"--_Reed's\r\nReed._ Washington, writing of the events of the 15th, says: \"I had\r\ngone the night before to the main body of the army which was posted on\r\nthe plains and heights of Harlem.\" These references fail to confirm\r\nthe common statement that Washington made the Murray House on\r\nThirty-sixth Street his quarters for a short time after leaving the\r\ncity.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enemy made no advance from Long Island until more than two weeks\r\nafter the battle. Howe's preparations were delayed because dependent\r\nupon the co-operation of the fleet. On the night of the 3d of\r\nSeptember, the frigate Rose, of thirty-two guns, sailed up the East\r\nRiver convoying thirty boats, and running through the fire of our guns\r\nat the Grand Battery, the ship-yards, and Corlears Hook, anchored\r\nclose into Wallabout Bay, where on the 5th our artillerists \"briskly\r\ncannonaded\" her. After dark on the 12th, thirty-six additional boats\r\npassed our batteries to Bushwick Creek, and the night after forty more\r\nfollowed. Then towards sunset on the 14th, the frigates Roebuck,\r\nPhoenix, Orpheus, and Carysfort, with six transports, joined the\r\nRose without receiving material injury from the heavy fire poured upon\r\nthem by our gunners.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the 15th, the British moved against\r\nManhattan Island, and in the afternoon New York City fell into their\r\npossession. What occurred beforehand during the day is known as the\r\n\"Kip's Bay affair.\"[179]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: According to the Hessian major, Baurmeister, the 13th\r\nhad been first named as the date for the attack. \"On this day,\" he\r\nwrites, \"General Howe wished to land upon the island of New York,\r\nbecause 18 years ago on this day General Wulff [Wolfe] had conquered\r\nat Quebec, but also lost his life. The watchword for this end was\r\n'Quebec' and the countersign 'Wulff,' but the frigates were too late\r\nfor this attack as they only sailed out of the fleet at five o'clock\r\non the evening of the 14th.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailing up of these ships is described as follows by the Hon.\r\nJoshua Babcock, one of the Rhode Island Committee who had come down to\r\nconsult with Washington in regard to military matters: \"Just after\r\nDinner 3 Frigates and a 40 Gun Ship (as if they meant to attack the\r\ncity) sail'd up the East River under a gentle Breeze towards\r\nHell-Gate, & kept up an incessant Fire assisted with the Cannon at\r\nGovernrs Island: The Batteries from the City return'd the Ships the\r\nlike Salutation: 3 Men agape, idle Spectators had the misfortune of\r\nbeing killed by one Cannon-Ball, the other mischief suffered on our\r\nSide was inconsiderable Saving the making a few Holes in some of the\r\nBuildings; one shot struck within 6 Foot of Genl Washington, as He\r\nwas on Horseback riding into the Fort.\"--_MS. Letter in R.I. Public\r\nArchives._ Also in _Force_.\r\n\r\nBaurmeister preserves the incident that Washington was often to be\r\nseen at the East River batteries in New York, and on one occasion\r\n\"provoked the Hessian artillery Captain Krug [on the Long Island side]\r\nto fire off 2 Cannon at him and his suite.\" \"A third shot too would\r\nnot have been wanting, if the horses of the enemy had been pleased to\r\nstay,\" adds the major.]\r\n\r\nKip's Bay was the large cove which then set in from the East River at\r\nabout the foot of Thirty-fourth Street. It took its name from the old\r\nKip family, who owned the adjacent estate. From this point breastworks\r\nhad been thrown up along the river's bank, wherever a landing could be\r\nmade, down as far as Corlears Hook or Grand Street. Five brigades had\r\nbeen distributed at this front to watch the enemy. Silliman's was in\r\nthe city; at Corlears Hook was Parsons' brigade, to which Prescott's\r\nMassachusetts men had now been added; beyond, in the vicinity of\r\nFifteenth Street, on the Stuyvesant estate, Scott's New York brigade\r\ntook post; above him, at about Twenty-third Street, was Wadsworth's\r\ncommand, consisting of Sage's, Selden's, and Gay's Connecticut levies;\r\nand further along near Kip's Bay was Colonel Douglas, with his brigade\r\nof three Connecticut militia regiments under Cooke, Pettibone, and\r\nTalcott, and his own battalion of levies.[180] Up the river a chain of\r\nsentinels communicated with the troops at Horn's Hook, and every half\r\nhour they passed the watchword to each other, \"All is well.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: We know the position of the troops from the statements\r\nof their officers. Douglas says: \"I lay with my brigade a little below\r\nTurtle [Kips] Bay where we hove up lines for more than one mile in\r\nlength. Gen'l Wadsworth managed the lines on the right and I on the\r\nleft.\" Brigade-Major Fish says of Scott's brigade that they were\r\n\"marched to the lines back of Stuyvesant's,\" about the foot of\r\nFifteenth Street. Parsons was below at Corlears Hook as appears from\r\n_Document_ 32. Silliman himself says that he was in the city. Consult\r\nmap of New York, Part II., where the position at the time of the\r\nBritish attack is given.]\r\n\r\nVery early on the morning of the 15th, which was Sunday, the five\r\nBritish frigates which had anchored under the Long Island shore sailed\r\nup and took position close within musket-shot of our lines at Kip's\r\nBay, somewhat to the left of Douglas. This officer immediately moved\r\nhis brigade abreast of them. The ships were so near, says Martin, one\r\nof Douglas' soldiers, that he could distinctly read the name of the\r\nPhoenix, which was lying \"a little quartering.\" Meanwhile, on the\r\nopposite shore, in Newtown Creek, the British embarked their light\r\ninfantry and reserves, and Donop's grenadiers and yagers, all under\r\nClinton and Cornwallis, in eighty-four boats, and drew up in regular\r\norder on the water ready to cross to the New York side.[181] The\r\nsoldier just quoted remembered that they looked like \"a large clover\r\nfield in full bloom.\" All along the line our soldiers were watching\r\nthese movements with anxious curiosity--that night they would have\r\nbeen withdrawn from the position--when suddenly between ten and eleven\r\no'clock the five frigates opened a sweeping fire from their seventy or\r\neighty guns upon the breastworks where Douglas and his brigade were\r\ndrawn up. It came like \"a peal of thunder,\" and the militiamen could\r\ndo nothing but keep well under cover. The enemy fired at them at their\r\npleasure, from \"their tops and everywhere,\" until our men soon found\r\nit impossible to stay in that position. \"We kept the lines,\" says\r\nMartin, \"till they were almost levelled upon us, when our officers,\r\nseeing we could make no resistance, and no orders coming from any\r\nsuperior officer, and that we must soon be entirely exposed to the\r\nrake of the guns, gave the order to leave.\" At the same time the\r\nflotilla crossed the river, and getting under cover of the smoke of\r\nthe ships' guns, struck off to the left of Douglas, where the troops\r\neffected a landing without difficulty. Howe says: \"The fire of the\r\nshipping being so well directed and so incessant, the enemy could not\r\nremain in their works, and the descent was made without the least\r\nopposition.\" The ordeal the militia were subjected to was something\r\nwhich in similar circumstances veteran troops have been unable to\r\nwithstand.[182] Retreating from the lines, Douglas's men scattered to\r\nthe rear towards the Post Road, and the enemy who landed and formed\r\nrapidly were soon after them. Douglas himself, who was an excellent\r\nofficer, was the last to leave, and all but escaped capture.[183]\r\nThere was no collecting the brigade, however, in any new position in\r\nthe field, for the thought of being intercepted had created a panic\r\namong the militia, and they fled in confusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: \"The first landing was of 84 boats with English\r\ninfantry and Hessian grenadiers under command of Lieut-General\r\nClinton. Commodore Hotham conducted this landing, under cover of 5\r\nfrigates anchored close before Kaaps [Kip's] Bay above Cron Point, and\r\nmaintained a 3 hours cannonade on the enemy's advanced posts in the\r\ngreat wood. The signal of the red flag denoted the departure of the\r\nboats, the blue on the contrary the stoppage of the passage, and if a\r\nretreat should become necessary, a yellow flag would be\r\nshown.\"--_Baurmeister._ \"Sunday morning at break of day, five ships\r\nweighed anchor and fell in close within a musket shot of our lines\r\nquite to the left of me. I then moved my brigade abreast of them. They\r\nlay very quiet until 10 o'clock and by that time they had about 80 of\r\ntheir boats from under Long Island shore full with men which contained\r\nabout five or six thousand and four transports full ready to come in\r\nthe second boats.\"--_Col. Douglas._\r\n\r\nMajor Fish wrote September 19th that the enemy's ships of war were\r\ndrawn up \"in line of Battle parallel to the shore, the Troops to the\r\namount of about 4000 being embarked in flat bottom Boats, and the\r\nBoats paraded.\"--_Hist. Mag._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: All accounts agree that it was next to impossible to\r\nremain under the fire of the men-of-war. Major Fish says that \"a\r\nCannonade from the ships began, which far exceeded my Ideas, and which\r\nseemed to infuse a Panic thro' the whole of our Troops, &c.\" Silliman\r\nspeaks of the \"incessant fire on our lines\" with grapeshot as being\r\n\"so hot\" that the militia were compelled to retreat. Douglas's\r\ndescription is as quaint as it is expressive: \"They very suddenly\r\nbegan as heavy a cannonade perhaps as ever was from no more ships, as\r\nthey had nothing to molest them.\" Martin thought his head would \"go\r\nwith the sound.\" Lieutenant John Heinrichs, of the Hessian yagers,\r\nwrites: \"Last Sunday we landed under the thundering rattle of 5\r\nmen-of-war.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: The enemy's boats, says Douglas, \"got under cover of\r\nthe smoke of the shipping and then struck to the left of my lines in\r\norder to cut me off from a retreat. My left wing gave way which was\r\nformed of the militia. I lay myself on the right wing waiting for the\r\nboats until Capt. Prentice came to me and told me, if I meant to save\r\nmyself to leave the lines, for that was the orders on the left and\r\nthat they had left the lines. I then told my men to make the best of\r\ntheir way as I found I had but about ten left with me. They soon moved\r\nout and I then made the best of my way out.\"--See further in\r\n_Documents_, Part II., p. 71.]\r\n\r\nWhen the cannonade at Kip's Bay began, Washington was four miles\r\ndistant, at Harlem. At the first sound of the guns he mounted his\r\nhorse and rode with all possible despatch to the scene. At about the\r\nsame time, General Parsons, probably by Putnam's order, directed\r\nPrescott's, Tyler's, and the remnant of Huntington's regiment, not\r\nover eighty strong, to march immediately to the assistance of the\r\ntroops where the enemy were landing.[184] Fellows' brigade was also\r\nordered along for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: _Document_ 32.]\r\n\r\nAt about the corner of the present Thirty-sixth Street and Fourth\r\nAvenue stood at that time the residence of Robert Murray, the Quaker\r\nmerchant, on what was known as \"Inclenberg\" heights, now Murray Hill.\r\nHis grounds extended to the Post Road, which there ran along the line\r\nof Lexington Avenue. Just above him a cross-road connected the Post\r\nand Bloomingdale roads, which is represented to-day by the line of\r\nForty-second and Forty-third streets. On the south side of the\r\ncross-road where it intersected the Post Road was a large corn-field\r\nadjoining or belonging to Murray's estate. When Washington reached\r\nthis vicinity he found the militia retreating in disorder along both\r\nthe cross and the Post roads, and Fellows' brigade just coming on to\r\nthe field. The general, with Putnam and others, was then on the rising\r\nground in the vicinity of the present Forty-second Street reservoir.\r\nIn a very short time Parsons and his regiments arrived by the\r\nBloomingdale Road, and Washington in person directed them to form\r\nalong the line of the Post Road in front of the enemy, who were\r\nrapidly advancing from Kip's Bay. \"Take the walls!\" \"Take the\r\ncorn-field!\" he shouted; and Parsons' men quickly ran to the walls and\r\nthe field, but in a confused and disordered manner. Their general did\r\nhis best to get them into line on the ground, but found it impossible,\r\nthey were so dispersed, and, moreover, they were now beginning to\r\nretreat. The panic which had seized the Connecticut militia was\r\ncommunicated to Fellows' Massachusetts men, who were also militia; and\r\nnow it was to sweep up Parsons' Continentals, including Prescott's men\r\nof Bunker Hill. The latter brigade had been brought on to the ground\r\nin bad shape through the fugitive militiamen, and when the British\r\nlight infantry appeared they broke and retreated with the rest.\r\n\r\nTo Washington all this confusion and rout seemed wholly unnecessary\r\nand unreasonable, and dashing in among the flying crowds he endeavored\r\nto convince them that there was no danger, and used his utmost\r\nexertions to bring them into some order. He was roused to more than\r\nindignation at the sight, and in his letter to Congress on the\r\nfollowing day denounced the conduct of these troops as \"disgraceful\r\nand dastardly.\"[185] Putnam, Parsons, Fellows, and others were\r\nequally active in attempting to stop the flight, but it was to no\r\npurpose. \"The very demons of fear and disorder,\" says Martin, \"seemed\r\nto take full possession of all and everything on that day.\" Nothing\r\nremained but to continue the retreat by the Bloomingdale Road to\r\nHarlem Heights.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: Washington's account of the panic is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I heard the firing, I rode with all possible despatch\r\ntowards the place of landing, where to my great surprise and\r\nmortification I found the troops that had been posted in the lines\r\nretreating with the utmost precipitation and those ordered to support\r\nthem (Parsons' and Fellows' brigades) flying in every direction, and\r\nin the greatest confusion, notwithstanding the exertions of their\r\ngenerals to form them. I used every means in my power to rally and to\r\nget them into some order; but my attempts were fruitless and\r\nineffectual; and on the appearance of a small party of the enemy, not\r\nmore than sixty or seventy, their disorder increased, and they ran\r\naway in the greatest confusion, without firing a single shot.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several stories current after the affair which cannot be\r\ntraced to any responsible source. One was that the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwas so \"distressed and enraged\" at the conduct of the troops that \"he\r\ndrew his sword and snapped his pistols to check them;\" and that one of\r\nhis suite was obliged to seize his horse's reins and take him out of\r\ndanger from the enemy. Another account represents that he threw his\r\nhat on the ground and exclaimed whether such were the troops with\r\nwhich he was to defend America; another states that he sought \"death\r\nrather than life.\" Mr. Bancroft has shown how far these statements are\r\nto be accepted.]\r\n\r\nDuring these scenes, Wadsworth's and Scott's brigades, which were\r\nbelow Douglas on the river lines, saw that their only safety lay,\r\nalso, in immediate retreat, and falling back, they joined the other\r\nbrigades above, though not without suffering some loss. The parties\r\nnow in the greatest danger were Silliman's brigade and Knox with\r\ndetachments of the artillery, who were still in the city three miles\r\nbelow. When Putnam, to whose division they belonged, found that no\r\nstand could be made at Kip's Bay or Murray's Hill, he galloped down\r\nthrough Wadsworth's and Scott's retreating troops, to extricate\r\nSilliman and the others.[186] Not a moment's time was to be lost, for\r\nshould the British stretch out their troops west of the Bloomingdale\r\nRoad to the North River, escape would be impossible. Silliman,\r\nmeanwhile, had taken post with Knox in and to the right of Bayard's\r\nHill Fort, from the top of which they could see the enemy occupying\r\nthe island above them. At this juncture, Major Aaron Burr, Putnam's\r\naid, rode up to the fort with orders to retreat. He was told that\r\nretreat was out of the question. Knox said that he should defend the\r\nfort to the last. But Burr, who knew the ground thoroughly, declared\r\nthat he could pilot them safely to the upper end of the island, and\r\nSilliman's men set out for the attempt.[187] Putnam also had called in\r\nother guards, and the entire force then took to the woods above\r\nGreenwich, on the west side, and keeping under cover wherever it was\r\npossible, made their way along without opposition. But it proved to be\r\na most trying and hazardous march. The day was \"insupportably hot;\"\r\nmore than one soldier died at the spring or brook where he drank; any\r\nmoment the enemy, who at some points were not half a mile away, might\r\nbe upon them. Officers rode in advance and to the right to reconnoitre\r\nand see that the way was clear. Putnam, Silliman, Burr, and others\r\nwere conspicuous in their exertions. Silliman was \"sometimes in the\r\nfront, sometimes in the centre, and sometimes in the rear.\" The men\r\nextended along in the woods for two miles, and the greatest\r\nprecautions were necessary to keep them out of sight of the main\r\nroad.[188] Putnam encouraged them continually by flying on his horse,\r\ncovered with foam, wherever his presence was most necessary. \"Without\r\nhis extraordinary exertions,\" says Colonel Humphreys, who frequently\r\nsaw Putnam that day, \"the guards must have been inevitably lost, and\r\nit is probable the entire corps would have been cut in pieces.\" Much,\r\ntoo, of the success of the march was due to Burr's skill and\r\nknowledge. Near Bloomingdale, the command fell in with a party of the\r\nBritish, when Silliman formed three hundred of his men and beat them\r\noff. After making a winding march of at least \"twelve miles,\" these\r\ngreatly distressed troops finally reached Harlem Heights after dark,\r\nto the surprise and relief of the other brigades, who had given them\r\nup for lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: Hezekiah Munsell, a soldier of Gay's regiment in\r\nWadsworth's brigade, says: \"We soon reached the main road which our\r\ntroops were travelling, and the first conspicuous person I met was\r\nGen. Putnam. He was making his way towards New York when all were\r\ngoing from it. Where he was going I could not conjecture, though I\r\nafterwards learned he was going after a small garrison of men in a\r\ncrescent fortification which he brought off safe.\"--_Hist. of Ancient\r\nWindsor_, p. 715.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Affidavits in Davis' \"Life of Burr,\" vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: The line of Putnam's retreat appears to have been from\r\nBayard's Hill Fort on Grand Street across the country to Monument Lane\r\n(now Greenwich Avenue), which led to the obelisk erected in honor of\r\nGeneral Wolf and others at a point on Fifteenth Street, a little west\r\nof Eighth Avenue. (See Montressor's Map of New York in 1775,\r\n\"Valentine's Manual.\") The lane there joined with an irregular road\r\nrunning on the line of Eighth Avenue, known afterwards as the Abington\r\nor Fitz Roy road, as far as Forty-second or Third Street. There\r\nPutnam, under Burr's guidance probably, pushed through the woods,\r\nkeeping west of the Bloomingdale Road, and finally taking the latter\r\nat some point above Seventieth Street, and so on to Harlem Heights.\r\n(See Map of New York, Part II.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough skilfully conducted, this escape is to be referred, in\r\nreality, to Howe's supineness and the hospitality of Mrs. Robert\r\nMurray, at whose house the British generals stopped for rest and\r\nrefreshment after driving back our troops. Instead of continuing a\r\nvigorous pursuit or making any effort to intercept other parties, they\r\nspent a valuable interval at the board of their entertaining hostess,\r\nwhose American sympathies added flavor and piquancy to the\r\nconversation. \"Mrs. Murray,\" says Dr. Thacher in his military journal,\r\n\"treated them with cake and wine, and they were induced to tarry two\r\nhours or more, Governor Tryon frequently joking her about her American\r\nfriends. By this happy incident, General Putnam, by continuing his\r\nmarch, escaped a rencounter with a greatly superior force, which must\r\nhave proved fatal to his whole party. Ten minutes, it is said, would\r\nhave been sufficient for the enemy to have secured the road at the\r\nturn and entirely cut off General Putnam's retreat. It has since\r\nbecome almost a common saying among our officers, that Mrs. Murray\r\nsaved this part of the American army.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the Kip's Bay affair there is but one criticism to be made--it was\r\nan ungovernable panic. Beginning with a retreat from the water-line,\r\nit grew into a fright and a run for safer ground. Panics are often\r\ninexplicable. The best troops as well as the poorest have been known\r\nto fly from the merest shadow of danger. In this case, so far as the\r\n_beginning_ of the rout is concerned, probably the militiamen did no\r\nworse than Washington's best men would have done. A retreat from the\r\nship's fire could not have been avoided, though, with better troops,\r\nthe subsequent rout could have been checked and the enemy retarded.\r\n\r\nThe incident was especially unfortunate at that time, as it served to\r\nincrease existing jealousies between the troops from the different\r\nStates, and so far impair the morale of the army. It excites a smile\r\nto-day to read that men from New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland\r\ncharged New Englanders generally with provincialism and cowardice, and\r\nthat the charge was resented; but such was the fact. The feeling\r\nbetween them grew to such an extent that Washington was obliged to\r\nissue orders condemning its indulgence. The Kip's Bay panic offered a\r\nfavorable opportunity for emphasizing these charges, and the\r\nConnecticut and Massachusetts runaways came in for their full share of\r\nuncomplimentary epithets. The Connecticut men were remembered\r\nparticularly, \"dastards\" and \"cowards\" being the terms which greeted\r\ntheir ears. All this of course could not but be ruinous to the\r\ndiscipline of the army, and it was an alarming fact to be dealt\r\nwith.[189] The men south of New England were not without reason in\r\nmaking their harsh criticisms, for many of the New England regiments,\r\nthe militia in particular, came upon the ground with an inferior\r\nmilitary organization. They were miserably officered in many cases,\r\nand the men, never expecting to become soldiers as such, were\r\nindifferent to discipline. But in another view the criticisms were\r\nunfair, because the Pennsylvanians and others, in making comparisons,\r\ncompared their best troops with New England's poorest. As two thirds\r\nof the army were from New England--more than one third from\r\nConnecticut--men from this section were necessarily represented\r\nlargely in every duty or piece of fighting, and whenever any\r\nmisconduct of a few occurred, it was made to reflect discredit upon\r\nthe whole. There was no difference between the better drilled and\r\nofficered regiments from the several States, just as there was little\r\ndifference between their hastily gathered militia. Thus it may be\r\nmentioned as a notable and somewhat humorous coincidence that at the\r\nvery moment the Connecticut militia were flying from the bombardment\r\nof the ships at Kip's Bay, New Jersey and Pennsylvania militia were\r\nflying with equal haste from the bombardment of other ships at Powle's\r\nHook as they sailed up the North River to Bloomingdale on the same\r\nmorning; and that while Reed, Tilghman, Smallwood, and others, were\r\ndenouncing the Kip's Bay fugitives in unmeasured terms, the indignant\r\nMercer was likewise denouncing the \"scandalous\" behavior of the\r\nfugitives in his own command.[190]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: This jealousy disappeared when the army was reorganized\r\nand the troops became proficient in discipline. The American soldier\r\nwas then found to be equal to any that could be brought against him,\r\nregardless of the locality from which he hailed. But in the present\r\ncampaign the sectional feeling referred to came near working mischief,\r\nespecially as it was kept alive by so prominent an officer as Colonel\r\nReed, the Adjutant-general. New England officers protested against the\r\n\"rancor\" and \"malice\" of his assertions, and represented their\r\ninjurious influence to members of Congress. Washington, finding that\r\nthe matter was becoming serious, took the occasion to send a special\r\ninvitation to Colonels Silliman and Douglas to dine with him in the\r\nlatter part of September, when he \"disavowed and absolutely\r\ndisapproved every such piece of conduct\" which had been a grievance to\r\nthese and other Eastern officers.--_Silliman's MS. Letter._ See also\r\nextracts in Gordon's history as to the condition of the army at this\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: \"The militia of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, stationed\r\non Bergen and at Paulus-Hook, have behaved in a scandalous manner,\r\nrunning off from their posts on the first cannonade from the ships of\r\nthe enemy. At all the posts we find it difficult to keep the militia\r\nto their duty.\" (_Mercer to Washington_, Sept. 17th, 1776.) \"I don't\r\nknow whether the New Engd troops will stand there [at Harlem\r\nHeights], but I am sure they will not upon open ground,\"\r\netc.--_Tilghman._ _Document_ 29.]\r\n\r\nThe events of the 15th naturally and justly roused the wrath of both\r\nWashington and Mercer, and their denunciations become a part of the\r\nrecord of the time. But in recording them it belongs to those who\r\nwrite a century later to explain and qualify. Justice to the men who\r\nfigured in these scenes requires that the terms of reproach should not\r\nbe perpetuated as a final stigma upon their character as soldiers of\r\nthe Revolution. All military experience proves that troops who have\r\nonce given way in a panic are not therefore or necessarily poor\r\ntroops; and the experience at Kip's Bay and Powle's Hook was only an\r\nillustration in the proof. These men had their revenge. If the records\r\nof New Jersey and Pennsylvania were to be thoroughly examined, they\r\nwould doubtless show that large numbers of Mercer's militia re-entered\r\nthe service and acquitted themselves well. This is certainly true of\r\nmany of the routed crowd whom Washington found it impossible to rally\r\non Murray's Hill and in Murray's corn-field. Some of those who ran\r\nfrom the Light Infantry on the 15th assisted in driving the same Light\r\nInfantry on the 16th. Prescott's men a few weeks later successfully\r\ndefended a crossing in Westchester County and thwarted the enemy's\r\ndesigns. Not a few of the militia in Douglas's brigade were the\r\nidentical men with whom Oliver Wolcott marched up to meet Burgoyne a\r\nyear later, and who, under Colonels Cook and Latimer, \"threw away\r\ntheir lives\" in the decisive action of that campaign, suffering a\r\ngreater loss than any other two regiments on the field. Fellows, also,\r\nwas there to co-operate in forcing the British surrender. In Parsons'\r\nbrigade were young officers and soldiers who formed part of the select\r\ncorps that stormed Stony Point, and among Wadsworth's troops were\r\nothers who, five years later, charged upon the Yorktown redoubt with\r\nthe leading American Light Infantry battalion.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: The Major of this battalion (Gimat's) was John\r\nPalsgrave Wyllys, of Hartford, who, as Wadsworth's Brigade-Major, was\r\ntaken prisoner at Kip's Bay. Alexander Hamilton and Brigade-Major\r\nFish, of New York, who were swept along in this retreat, also figured\r\nprominently at Yorktown. Two young ensigns in the Connecticut\r\n\"levies,\" Stephen Betts and James Morris, were captains of Light\r\nInfantry in that affair. Lieutenant Stephen Olney, of Rhode Island,\r\nwho barely escaped capture on Long Island by Cornwallis's grenadiers,\r\nled Gimat's battalion as captain, and was severely wounded while\r\nclambering into the redoubt; and there were probably a considerable\r\nnumber of others, officers and men, who were chased by this British\r\ngeneral in the present campaign, who finally had the satisfaction of\r\ncornering him in Virginia in 1781. Scammell, Huntington, Tilghman,\r\nHumphreys, and others, could be named.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Washington found that the enemy had made their principal landing\r\nat Thirty-fourth Street, and that a retreat was necessary, he sent\r\nback word to have Harlem Heights well secured by the troops there,\r\nwhile at the same time a considerable force under Mifflin marched\r\ndown to the strong ground near McGowan's to cover the escape of troops\r\nthat might take the King's Bridge road. Chester and Sargent evacuated\r\nHorn's Hook and came in with Mifflin. Upon the landing of more troops\r\nat Kip's Bay, Howe sent a column towards McGowan's, and in the evening\r\nthe Light Infantry reached Apthorpe's just after Silliman's retreat.\r\nWashington had waited on the Bloomingdale Road until the last, and\r\nretired from the Apthorpe Mansion but a short time before the British\r\noccupied it. Here at Bloomingdale the enemy encamped their left wing\r\nfor the night, while their right occupied Horn's Hook, their outposts\r\nnot being advanced on the left beyond One Hundredth Street. The\r\nAmericans slept on Harlem Heights, not quite a mile and a half above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"That night,\" says Humphreys, \"our soldiers, excessively fatigued by\r\nthe sultry march of the day, their clothes wet by a severe shower of\r\nrain that succeeded towards the evening, their blood chilled by the\r\ncold wind that produced a sudden change in the temperature of the air,\r\nand their hearts sunk within them by the loss of baggage, artillery,\r\nand works, in which they had been taught to put great confidence, lay\r\nupon their arms, covered only by the clouds of an uncomfortable\r\nsky.\"[192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: The American loss in prisoners in the Kip's Bay affair\r\nwas seventeen officers and about three hundred and fifty men, nearly\r\nall from Connecticut and New York. A very few were killed and wounded,\r\nMajor Chapman, of Tyler's regiment, being among the former.\r\n\r\nThe officer of highest rank among the prisoners was Colonel Samuel\r\nSelden, of Hadlyme, Conn., mentioned on page 121. (See biographical\r\nsketches, Part II.) One of his officers was Captain Eliphalet Holmes,\r\nafterwards of the Continental line, a neighbor of the Colonel's. Being\r\na man of great strength he knocked down two Hessians, who attempted to\r\ncapture him, and escaped.]\r\n\r\nDuring the day, meantime, the British occupied the city. After the\r\ndeparture of the last troops under Silliman (Knox with others escaping\r\nto Powle's Hook by boats) a white flag was displayed on Bayard's Hill\r\nRedoubt by citizens, and in the afternoon a detachment from the fleet\r\nfirst took possession.[193] In the evening a brigade from Howe's force\r\nencamped along the outer line of works. The next forenoon, the 16th,\r\n\"the first of the English troops came to town,\" under General\r\nRobertson, and were drawn up in two lines on Broadway. Governor Tryon\r\nwas present with officers of rank and a great concourse of people.\r\n\"Joy and gladness seemed to appear in all countenances;\" while the\r\nfirst act of the victors was to identify and confiscate every house\r\nowned and deserted by the rebels. \"And thus,\" says the now happy\r\nloyalist pastor Shewkirk, \"the city was delivered from those Usurpers\r\nwho had oppressed it so long.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: _Baurmeister's Narrative._ _Shewkirk's Diary._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortunately, the demoralizing effect of the panic of the 15th was to\r\nbe merely temporary. Indeed, before the details of the affair had time\r\nto circulate through the camps and work further discouragement or\r\ndepression, there occurred another encounter with the enemy on the\r\nfollowing morning, which neutralized the disgrace of the previous day\r\nand revived the spirits of our army to an astonishing degree. So much\r\nimportance was attached to it at the time as being a greatly needed\r\nstimulant for the American soldier that it becomes of interest to\r\nfollow its particulars. It has passed into our history as the affair\r\nor\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF HARLEM HEIGHTS.[194]\r\n\r\nNever for a moment relaxing his watch over the enemy's movements,\r\nWashington, before daylight on the morning of the 16th, ordered a\r\nreconnoitring party out to ascertain the exact position of the\r\nBritish. The party consisted of the detachment of \"Rangers,\"[195] or\r\nvolunteers from the New England regiments, which had been organized\r\nfor scouting service since the battle of Long Island, and placed under\r\nthe command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Knowlton, of Connecticut. No\r\nbetter man could have been found in the army to head such a corps, for\r\nhe had proved his courage at Bunker Hill, and on more than one\r\noccasion since had shown his capacity for leadership. The detachment\r\nstarted out, not more than one hundred and twenty strong, and passing\r\nover to the Bloomingdale heights, marched for the Bloomingdale Road,\r\nwhere the enemy were last seen the night before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: The centennial anniversary of this battle was\r\ncelebrated in 1876, under the auspices of the New York Historical\r\nSociety. The oration delivered on the occasion by the Hon. John Jay\r\nhas been published by the Society, with an appendix containing a large\r\nnumber of documents bearing upon the affair, the whole making a\r\nvaluable contribution to our Revolutionary history.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: THE RANGERS.--The small corps known by this name\r\nconsisted, first, as already stated, of about one hundred men of\r\nDurkee's Connecticut Regiment (Twentieth Continentals), who appear to\r\nhave accompanied Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton, of that regiment, when\r\nhe went on any special service. These he took with him to Long Island.\r\nAfter the battle there the Rangers were formally organized as a\r\nseparate body, composed of volunteer officers and men from several of\r\nthe New England regiments. These were borne on their respective\r\nregimental rolls as detached \"on command.\" For captains, Knowlton had\r\nat least three excellent officers, men from his own region, whom he\r\nknew and could trust--Nathan Hale, of Charles Webb's regiment, and\r\nStephen Brown and Thomas Grosvenor, of his own. The rolls in _Force_\r\nshow that there were officers and men in the Rangers from Durkee's,\r\nWebb's, Chester's, Wyllys', and Tyler's Connecticut; Ward's and\r\nSargent's Massachusetts; and Varnum's Rhode Island. For a time they\r\nreceived orders directly from Washington and then from Putnam, and\r\nwere of great service to the army in watching the enemy along the\r\nHarlem front. They distinguished themselves on the 16th, and later in\r\nthe season, when Colonel Magaw was in command of Fort Washington, he\r\nbegged to have the Rangers remain with him, as he declared that they\r\nwere the only safe protection to the lines. (Greene to Washington.)\r\nThey remained and were taken prisoners at the surrender of the fort,\r\nNovember 16th. Though probably not over one hundred and fifty strong,\r\ntheir losses seem to have been heavy. Knowlton fell at Harlem Heights;\r\nMajor Coburn, who succeeded him, was severely wounded a few weeks\r\nlater; Captain Nathan Hale was executed as a spy; and Captain Brown, a\r\nman as cool as Knowlton, was killed at the defence of Fort Mifflin\r\nnear Philadelphia, in 1777, a cannon-ball severing his head from his\r\nbody. Grosvenor served through the war, retiring as Lieutenant-Colonel\r\ncommanding the Fifth of the Connecticut line. These facts are gathered\r\nfrom MS. Order Books, documents in _Force_ and _Hist. Mag._, and from\r\nMS. letter of the late Judge Oliver Burnham, of Cornwall, Conn., a\r\nsoldier in Wyllys' regiment and one of the Rangers, in which he says:\r\n\"Soon after the retreat from Long Island, Colonel Knowlton was ordered\r\nto raise a battalion of troops from the different regiments called the\r\nRangers, to reconnoitre along our shores and between the armies. Being\r\ninvited by a favorite officer, I volunteered, and on the day the enemy\r\ntook New York we were at Harlem and had no share in the events of that\r\nday.\"]\r\n\r\nThe ground which Knowlton reconnoitred and which became the scene of\r\nthe action remains to-day unchanged in its principal features. What\r\nwas then known as Harlem Heights is that section of the island which\r\nrises prominently from the plain west of Eighth Avenue and north of\r\nOne Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street. Its southern face extended from\r\nan abrupt point, called \"Point of Rocks,\" at One Hundred and\r\nTwenty-sixth Street, east of Ninth Avenue, northwesterly to the\r\nHudson, a distance of three quarters of a mile. At the foot of these\r\nheights lay a vale or \"hollow way,\" through the centre of which now\r\nruns Manhattan Street, and opposite, at distances varying from a\r\nquarter to a third of a mile, rose another line of bluffs and slopes\r\nparallel to Harlem Heights. This lower elevation stood mainly in the\r\nBloomingdale division of the city's out-ward, and is generally known\r\nto-day as Bloomingdale Heights. In 1776 there were two farms on these\r\nheights, owned and occupied by Adrian Hogeland and Benjamin\r\nVandewater, which were partly cultivated, but mainly covered with\r\nwoods. The Bloomingdale Road, as stated in a previous chapter,\r\nterminated at Hogeland's lands about One Hundred and Eighth or Tenth\r\nstreets, and from there a lane or road ran easterly by Vandewater's\r\nand joined the King's Bridge road near One Hundred and Twentieth\r\nStreet. East of the Bloomingdale and south of Harlem Heights stretched\r\nthe tract of level land called Harlem Plains.\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat of the 15th, Washington's army encamped on Harlem\r\nHeights, with their pickets lining the southern slope from Point of\r\nRocks to the Hudson. The British, as we have seen, lay at Bloomingdale\r\nand across the upper part of Central Park to Horn's Hook. An enemy,\r\nposted at the lower boundary of Harlem Plains, around McGowan's Pass,\r\nwhere the ground again rises at the northern end of the Park, might be\r\neasily observed from the Point of Rocks, and any advance from that\r\nquarter could be reported at once. Nothing, however, could be seen of\r\nmovements made on the Bloomingdale Road or Heights, and it was in that\r\ndirection that the \"Rangers\" now proceeded to reconnoitre at dawn on\r\nthe 16th.\r\n\r\nKnowlton, marching under cover of the woods, soon came upon the\r\nenemy's pickets, somewhere, it would appear, between Hogeland's and\r\nApthorpe's houses on the Bloomingdale Road, more than a mile below the\r\nAmerican lines. This was the encampment of the Light Infantry, and\r\ntheir Second and Third Battalions, supported by the Forty-second\r\nHighlanders, were immediately pushed forward to drive back this party\r\nof rebels who had dared to attack them on their own ground.\r\nAnticipating some such move, Knowlton had already posted his men\r\nbehind a stone wall, and when the British advanced he met them with a\r\nvigorous fire. His men fired eight or nine rounds a piece with good\r\neffect, when the enemy threatened to turn his flanks, and he ordered a\r\nretreat, which was well conducted. In this brief encounter the Rangers\r\nlost about ten of their number, and believed that they inflicted much\r\nmore than this loss upon the Infantry.[196]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: The Rangers were thus engaged in a distinct skirmish\r\nbefore the main action of the day. Washington wrote to Congress early\r\non the 16th: \"I have sent some reconnoitring parties to gain\r\nintelligence, if possible, of the disposition of the enemy.\" A letter\r\nin the _Connecticut Gazette_, reprinted in Mr. Jay's documents, and\r\nwhich was probably written by Captain Brown, says: \"On Monday morning\r\nthe General ordered us to go and take the enemy's advanced guard;\r\naccordingly we set out just before day and found where they were; at\r\nday-brake we were discovered by the enemy, who were 400 strong, and we\r\nwere 120. They marched up within six rods of us and there formed to\r\ngive us Battle, which we were ready for; and Colonel Knowlton gave\r\norders to fire, which we did, and stood theirs till we perceived they\r\nwere getting their flank-guards round us. After giving them eight\r\nrounds apiece the Colonel gave orders for retreating, which we\r\nperformed very well, without the loss of a man while retreating,\r\nthough we lost about 10 while in action.\" Judge Burnham says\r\nsubstantially the same: \"Colonel Knowlton marched close to the enemy\r\nas they lay on one of the Harlem Heights, and discharged a few rounds,\r\nand then retreated over the hill out of sight of the enemy and\r\nconcealed us behind a low stone wall. The Colonel marked a place about\r\neight or ten rods from the wall, and charged us not to rise or fire a\r\ngun until the enemy reached that place. The British followed in solid\r\ncolumn, and soon were on the ground designated when we gave them nine\r\nrounds and retreated.... Our number engaged was only about 120.\"]\r\n\r\nAt his headquarters in the Morris Mansion, Washington, meantime, was\r\nwriting his despatches to Congress. The unwelcome duty fell to him to\r\nreport the scenes of the previous day which had so deeply stirred his\r\nindignation. He made a plain statement of the facts, described the\r\nretreat from New York, acknowledged the loss of baggage and cannon,\r\nand despondently expressed his misgivings as to the soldierly\r\nqualities of a majority of his troops. \"We are now,\" he wrote,\r\n\"encamped with the main body of the army on the Heights of Harlem,\r\nwhere I should hope the enemy would meet with a defeat in case of an\r\nattack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable\r\nbravery. But experience, to my extreme affliction, has convinced me\r\nthat this is rather to be wished for than expected. However, I trust\r\nthat there are many who will act like men, and show themselves worthy\r\nof the blessings of freedom.\" Not unfounded was this trust, for at the\r\nvery time the commander-in-chief was writing the words, the Rangers\r\nwere bravely fighting in the Bloomingdale Woods, and many others soon\r\nafter, including one of the very regiments which fled from Kip's Bay\r\ntwenty-four hours before, were likewise to act \"like men\" and prove\r\ntheir real worth in the open field. Just as the letters were sent off\r\nword came in to headquarters that the enemy had appeared in several\r\nlarge bodies upon the plains, and Washington rode down to the\r\npicket-posts to make the necessary dispositions in case of an attack.\r\nAdjutant-General Reed and Lieutenant Tilghman, who had also been\r\nwriting private letters describing Sunday's panic, and other members\r\nof the staff, went to the front about the same time. Knowlton's men\r\nhad not yet come in, and their fire was distinctly heard from the\r\nPoint of Rocks, where the commander-in-chief was now surveying the\r\nsituation. Anxious to learn whether the British were approaching in\r\nforce on the Bloomingdale Heights, no attack being threatened from the\r\nplains, Colonel Reed received permission to go \"down to our most\r\nadvanced guard,\" namely, to the Rangers, whom he found making a\r\nmomentary halt on their retreat. The enemy soon came up again in\r\nlarge numbers, and the Rangers continued to retire. Colonel Reed,\r\ndescribing his experience at this point, states that the British\r\nadvanced so rapidly that he had not quitted a house (which may have\r\nbeen Vandewater's) five minutes before they were in possession of it.\r\n\"Finding how things were going,\" to use Reed's words, he returned to\r\nWashington \"to get some support for the brave fellows who had behaved\r\nso well.\" Knowlton, however, fell back to our lines, and the enemy\r\nhalted in their pursuit on the north-east edge of Bloomingdale\r\nHeights, opposite the Point of Rocks, where a part of them appeared in\r\nopen sight, and \"in the most insulting manner\" sounded their\r\nbugle-horns as if on a fox chase. \"I never felt such a sensation\r\nbefore,\" says Reed; \"it seemed to crown our disgrace.\" But the chase\r\nwas not yet over.\r\n\r\nLearning from Knowlton that the British Infantry who had followed him\r\nin were about three hundred strong, and knowing that they were some\r\ndistance from their main army, Washington determined, if possible, to\r\neffect their capture. Knowlton's men, who had done nobly, were ready\r\nfor another brush, and there were troops at hand who could be depended\r\nupon to behave well under any circumstances. The opportunity for a\r\nbrisk and successful skirmish presented itself, and the general\r\nproposed to improve it. Accordingly he formed the plan of engaging the\r\nenemy's attention in their front, while a flanking party should\r\nattempt to get into their rear and cut off their escape. The troops\r\nthat were stationed nearest to the Point of Rocks at this time appear\r\nto have been Nixon's brigade, of Greene's division, Weedon's newly\r\narrived regiment of Virginians, General Beall's Marylanders, Colonel\r\nSargent's eastern brigade, Clinton's and Scott's brigades, and other\r\nregiments belonging to Putnam's and Spencer's divisions. For the\r\nflanking detachment, the general selected Knowlton's Rangers, to whom\r\nhe added a reinforcement of three of the Virginia companies, about one\r\nhundred and twenty men, under Major Andrew Leitch. These were directed\r\nto make their way or \"steal around\" to the rear of the enemy by their\r\nright flank. To make a demonstration against the enemy in their front,\r\nwhile the flanking party effected its object, a detachment of\r\nvolunteers was organized from Nixon's brigade, under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nArchibald Crary, of Varnum's Rhode Islanders,[197] who marched down\r\ninto the \"hollow way\" directly towards the British on the opposite\r\nridge. As Washington hoped, this move had the desired effect. The\r\nBritish, seeing so small a party coming out against them, immediately\r\nran down the rocky hill into an open field, where they took post\r\nbehind some bushes and a rail fence that extended from the hill to the\r\npost road about four hundred yards in front of the Point of\r\nRocks.[198] This field was part of the old Kortwright farm, lying\r\njust west of the present Harlem Lane, above One Hundred and Eighteenth\r\nStreet, in which the line of that fence had been established for more\r\nthan half a century before this engagement, and where it remained the\r\nsame for more than half a century after. It is possible to-day to fix\r\nits exact position, for the march of modern improvements has not yet\r\ndisturbed the site.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Captain John Gooch, of Varnum's regiment, wrote\r\nSeptember 23d: \"On the 16th the enemy advanced and took possession of\r\na hight on our right flank about half a mile Distance with about 3000\r\n[300?] men; a party from our brigade of 150 men, who turned out as\r\nvolunteers, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Crary, of the\r\nregmt I belong to, were ordered out if possible to dispossess\r\nthem.\"--_Document_ 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Tilghman's reference to these movements is as follows:\r\n\"The General rode down to our farthest lines, and when he came near\r\nthem heard a firing, which he was informed was between our scouts and\r\nthe outguards of the enemy. When our men [Knowlton's] came in they\r\ninformed the General that there was a party of about 300 behind a\r\nwoody hill, tho' they only showed a very small party to us. Upon this\r\nthe General laid a plan for attacking them in the rear and cutting off\r\ntheir retreat, which was to be effected in the following manner: Major\r\nLeitch, with three companies of Colo Weedon's Virginia regiment,\r\nand Colo Knowlton with his Rangers, were to steal round while a\r\nparty [Crary's] were to march towards them and seem as if they\r\nintended to attack in front, but not to make any real attack till they\r\nsaw our men fairly in their rear. The bait took as to one part; as\r\nsoon as they saw our party in front the enemy ran down the hill and\r\ntook possession of some fences and bushes and began to fire at them,\r\nbut at too great distance to do much execution,\" etc.--_Document_ 29.\r\nSee also Washington's letter to Congress, Sept. 18th, 1776.]\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the enemy engaged at that point, Crary's party opened\r\nfire at long range, to which the British replied, but not much\r\nexecution was done on either side. Meanwhile Knowlton and Leitch moved\r\nout to get in the rear. Colonel Reed accompanied the party, and as he\r\nhad been over the ground he undertook the lead, with the Virginians in\r\nadvance. It was probably his intention to march down under cover of\r\nthe bushes, cross the Kortwright farm unobserved some little distance\r\nbelow the enemy, and reach the top of the Bloomingdale ridge before\r\nthey were discovered. Once there, the British would be effectually\r\nhemmed in. Unfortunately, however, some \"inferior officers,\" as it\r\nwould appear, gave unauthorized directions to the flanking party; or\r\nthe party forming the \"feint\" in front pushed on too soon, in\r\nconsequence of which Leitch and Knowlton made their attack rather on\r\nthe British flank than in their rear.[199] The latter now finding a\r\nretreat necessary, left the fence and started back up the hill which\r\nthey had descended. Our men quickly followed, Crary in front, Knowlton\r\nand Leitch on the left, and with the Virginians leading, joined in the\r\npursuit with splendid spirit and animation. They rushed up the slope,\r\non about the line of One Hundred and Twentieth Street, and, climbing\r\nover the rocks, poured in their volleys upon the running Light\r\nInfantry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: It is quite clear that Knowlton and Leitch did not form\r\ntwo parties, as some accounts state, one moving against the right\r\nflank of the enemy and the other against the left. They acted as one\r\nbody, the Virginians marching in front, having been ordered on to\r\n\"reinforce\" Knowlton. Thus Captain Brown writes that after retreating\r\nthey \"sent off for a reinforcement,\" which they soon received; and\r\nColonel Reed confirms this in his testimony at the court-martial of a\r\nsoldier who acted a cowardly part in the fight. \"On Monday forenoon,\"\r\nhe says, \"I left Colonel Knowlton with a design to send him a\r\nreinforcement. I had accordingly ordered up Major Leitch, and was\r\ngoing up to where the firing was,\" etc. (_Force_, 5th Series, vol. ii.\r\np. 500.) Reed's letters to his wife show that Leitch and Knowlton fell\r\nnear him, within a few minutes of each other, which could not have\r\nbeen the case had they been on opposite flanks. The accounts of\r\nTilghman, Marshall, the soldier Martin, and others, leave no doubt as\r\nto this point that there was but one flanking party, and that Knowlton\r\ncommanded it.]\r\n\r\nIt was right here, now, just on the crest of the ridge, and when our\r\ngallant advance was turning the tide against the enemy, that we\r\nsuffered the loss of those two noble leaders whose memory is linked\r\nwith this day's action. In a very short time after the first rush,\r\nLeitch was severely wounded not far from Reed, having received three\r\nballs in his side in as many minutes; and in less than ten minutes\r\nafter a bullet pierced Knowlton's body, and he too fell mortally\r\nwounded. We can identify the spot where the fall of these brave\r\nofficers occurred as on the summit of the Bloomingdale Heights below\r\nOne Hundred and Nineteenth Street, and about half way between the line\r\nof Ninth and Tenth Avenues. The site is included within the limits of\r\nthe proposed \"Morningside Park,\" which will thus have added to its\r\nnatural attractiveness a never-fading historical association.[200]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: Judge Burnham refers to the flank attack briefly as\r\nfollows: \"Passing over we met the enemy's right flank which had been\r\nposted out of our sight on lower ground. They fired and killed Colonel\r\nKnowlton and nearly all that had reached the top of the height.\" This\r\nreference to the _top of the height_, taken in connection with Reed's\r\nstatement that \"our brave fellows mounted up the rocks and attacked\r\nthem as they ran in turn,\" goes to confirm the selection of the spot\r\nwhere Leitch and Knowlton fell. Burnham states that he was within a\r\nfew feet of the latter when he was shot.]\r\n\r\nLeitch was borne to the rear to be tenderly cared for until his death\r\nat a later day. In after years the Government remembered his services\r\nby granting his widow a generous pension. Knowlton met his fate with a\r\nsoldier's fortitude and a patriot's devotion. \"My poor Colonel,\"\r\nwrites an officer of the Rangers, who without doubt was Captain\r\nStephen Brown, next in rank to Knowlton, \"my poor Colonel, in the\r\nsecond attack, was shot just by my side. The ball entered the small of\r\nhis back. I took hold of him, asked him if he was badly wounded? He\r\ntold me he was; but says he, 'I do not value my life if we do but get\r\nthe day.' I then ordered two men to carry him off. He desired me by\r\nall means to keep up this flank. He seemed as unconcerned and calm as\r\ntho' nothing had happened to him.\" Reed, on whose horse the colonel\r\nwas carried to the lines, wrote to his wife on the following day: \"Our\r\nloss is also considerable. The Virginia Major (Leitch) who went up\r\nfirst with me was wounded with three shot in less than three minutes;\r\nbut our greatest loss was a brave officer from Connecticut, whose name\r\nand spirit ought to be immortalized--one Colonel Knowlton. I assisted\r\nhim off, and when gasping in the agonies of death, all his inquiry was\r\nif we had drove the enemy.\" Washington spoke of him in his letters and\r\norders as \"a valuable and gallant officer,\" who would have been \"an\r\nhonor to any country.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Rangers and Virginians kept up their attack under their\r\ncaptains, and Washington, finding that the entire party needed\r\nsupport, sent forward three of the Maryland Independent companies,\r\nunder Major Price, and parts of Griffith's and Richardson's Maryland\r\nFlying Camp.[201] At the same time, as Washington reports, some\r\ndetachments from the Eastern regiments who were nearest the place of\r\naction, which included most of Nixon's and Sargent's brigades, Colonel\r\nDouglas's Connecticut levies, and a few others, were ordered into the\r\nfield. Our total force engaged at this time, now about noon, was not\r\nfar from eighteen hundred strong, and very soon a considerable battle\r\nwas in progress. Besides Reed and other members of Washington's staff,\r\nGenerals Putnam, Greene, and George Clinton accompanied the\r\ndetachments, and encouraged the men by individual examples of\r\nbravery.[202] The troops now \"charged the enemy with great\r\nintrepidity,\" and drove them from the crest of the heights back in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction through a piece of woods to a buckwheat\r\nfield, about four hundred paces, as General Clinton describes it, from\r\nthe ridge, or just east of the present Bloomingdale Asylum, where the\r\nLight Infantry, now reinforced by the Forty-second Highlanders,\r\nfinally made a stand. The distance the latter troops had advanced and\r\nthe sound of the firing had evidently warned Howe, at his headquarters\r\nat Apthorpe's, that they needed immediate assistance, and he promptly\r\nordered forward the reserve with two field-pieces, together with the\r\nYagers and Linsingen's grenadiers of Donop's corps. The field-pieces\r\nand Yagers came into action at the buckwheat field, and here a\r\nstubborn contest ensued for about an hour and a half.[203] But our\r\ntroops pressed the enemy so hard at this point, and the Highlanders\r\nand Yagers having fired away their ammunition, the latter all again\r\nfell back, and the Americans pursued them vigorously to an orchard a\r\nshort distance below, in the direction of the Bloomingdale Road. Here\r\nhad been hard fighting in the open field, and the best British troops\r\nwere beaten! At the orchard the result was the same, the enemy making\r\nlittle resistance, their fire \"being silenced in a great measure,\" and\r\nthe chase continued down one of the slight hills on Hogeland's lands\r\nand up another, near or quite to the terminus of the Bloomingdale\r\nRoad. Beyond this third position our troops were not allowed to follow\r\nthe enemy, whose main encampment was not far distant. The Fifth\r\nRegiment of Foot had been trotted up \"about three miles without a halt\r\nto draw breath,\" reaching the ground at the close of the action.\r\nLinsingen's grenadiers appeared about the same time, while Block's and\r\nMinegerode's men were sent to McGowan's Pass, which had not yet been\r\noccupied. A large body of the enemy were put under arms, and within\r\ntheir camp every preparation was made for a general engagement; but\r\nthis, above all things, Washington wished to avoid, and, quite content\r\nwith the brilliant success of his troops thus far, he despatched\r\nLieutenant Tilghman to the front to bring them off. Before turning\r\nfrom the field they had won so gloriously, they answered the bugle\r\nblast of the morning with a cheer of victory, and marched back in good\r\norder.[204]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: There appear to have been nine companies of Maryland\r\ntroops engaged, three under Major Price, three under Major Mantz, and\r\nthree others of Richardson's regiment. Among these were one or more\r\ncompanies of Colonel Ewing's as yet incomplete battalion. One of his\r\nofficers, Captain Lowe, was wounded.--_Force_, 5th Series, vol. ii. p.\r\n1024. Also Capt. Beatty's letter in Mr. Jay's Documents.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Greene wrote at a latter date: \"Gen. Putnam and the\r\nAdj.

They gave a Hurra and left the field in good order.\"--_Tilghman's\r\nLetters_, Doc. 29.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.--Recently gathered material seems to settle all\r\ndoubts as to the several points occupied by the British and Americans\r\nduring the action. Where did it begin and where did it end? As to the\r\nfirst skirmish, it began near the British encampment at Bloomingdale.\r\nHere was Howe's left, and, as Howe reports, Knowlton approached his\r\nadvanced posts under cover of the woods \"by way of Vandewater's\r\nHeight.\" This was what we call Bloomingdale Heights. The original\r\nproprietor of the greater part of this site was Thomas De Key. From\r\nhim all or a large part of it passed to Harman Vandewater and Adrian\r\nHogeland, as the deeds on record show. In 1784 the property was\r\npurchased by Nicholas De Peyster. The position of Hogeland's and\r\nVandewater's houses as given on the accompanying map is taken from old\r\nsurveys which mark the location and give the names. The Bloomingdale\r\nRoad at that time stopped at these farms. That part of it above One\r\nHundred and Tenth Street, running through Manhattanville and\r\ncontinuing until recently to the King's Bridge Road at One Hundred and\r\nForty-sixth Street, did not exist during the Revolution, but was\r\nopened a few years later. (Hoffman's _Est. and Rights of the\r\nCorporation of New York_, vol. ii.) A lane or road running from\r\nHogeland's by Vandewater's connected the Bloomingdale with the King's\r\nBridge road at One Hundred and Nineteenth Street. Washington himself\r\ngives us the general line. Before the battle of Long Island he ordered\r\nHeath to have troops ready to march to New York as soon as called for,\r\nand he describes the proper route thus: \"There is a road out of the\r\nHaerlem flat lands that leads up to the hills, and continues down the\r\nNorth River by Bloomingdale, Delancy's, &c., which road I would have\r\nthem march, as they will keep the river in sight, and pass a tolerable\r\nlanding-place for troops in the neighborhood of Bloomingdale.\" (_Heath\r\nCorrespondence_, Mass. Hist. Coll. for 1878.) From this topography and\r\nthe records the position becomes clear: Howe camped around\r\nBloomingdale with his advance posts along the Bloomingdale Road,\r\nperhaps as far as its terminus near Hogeland's. They were last seen in\r\nthis vicinity the night before. Knowlton, next morning, marches out\r\nfrom Harlem Heights, reconnoitres \"by way of Vandewater's,\" and comes\r\nupon the British posts on and along the line of the Bloomingdale Road.\r\nThen he falls back under cover of the woods and over fences towards\r\nthe Point of Rocks, the enemy following him.\r\n\r\nAs to succeeding movements, if we can fix Washington's station and the\r\nhill which all agree that the British descended, there is no\r\ndifficulty in following them after. Point of Rocks was the extreme\r\nlimit of Harlem Heights. There were our advanced posts overlooking the\r\ncountry south. Washington states that he rode down to \"our advanced\r\nposts\" to direct matters. Where better could he do so than at Point of\r\nRocks? And in a sketch of the field preserved in the Stiles Diary, and\r\nreproduced among Mr. Jay's documents, Washington is given just that\r\nstation where an earthwork had been thrown up. To confirm this and\r\nalso to locate the next point, we have a letter from Major Lewis\r\nMorris (Jay documents), in which he says: \"Colonel Knowlton's regiment\r\nwas attacked by the enemy upon a height a little to the south-west of\r\nDays's Tavern, and after opposing them bravely and being overpowered\r\nby their numbers they were forced to retreat, and the enemy advanced\r\nupon the top of the hill opposite to that which lies before Days's\r\ndoor, with a confidence of success, and after rallying their men by a\r\nbugle horn and resting themselves a little while, they descended the\r\nhill,\" etc. In one of Christopher Colles's road maps (published in the\r\nN.Y. Corporation Manual for 1870, p. 778), Days's tavern is put\r\ndirectly opposite Point of Rocks on the King's Bridge Road, which\r\nfixes the hill occupied by the enemy as the north-east bluff of\r\nBloomingdale Heights, or about One Hundred and Twenty-third Street,\r\nbetween Ninth and Tenth avenues. They ran down this bluff to fences\r\nand bushes at the edge of \"a clear field.\" This was part of the\r\nKortwright farm, and the farm lines of 1812 show the same northern\r\nboundary that surveys show in 1711. This northerly fence line is given\r\nin the accompanying map, and it will be noticed that it would be the\r\nnatural line for the British Infantry to take in opposing Crary's\r\nparty. The soldier Martin speaks of their taking a post and rail fence\r\nwith a field in their rear. General George Clinton, who gives a clear\r\ndescription of the fighting from this point, also mentions this field\r\nand fence, but appears to have been mistaken in stating that the enemy\r\nwere driven back to that position. They ran down the hill and took up\r\nthat position. Then, when driven back, they retreated in the general\r\ndirection of their first advance--that is, towards their camp, passing\r\nthrough a buckwheat field, and orchard to the Bloomingdale Road, and\r\nnot, as generally stated, to the high ground in Central Park east of\r\nEighth Avenue. General Clinton says they fell back from the orchard\r\n\"across a hollow and up another hill not far distant from their own\r\nlines,\" which doubtless refers to undulations on Hogeland's place, and\r\npossibly to the then hilly ground about One Hundred and Seventh Street\r\nand Eleventh Avenue. One of the Hessian accounts states that the\r\nYagers who were sent to support the Light Infantry came into \"a hot\r\ncontest on Hoyland's Hill\"--a reference clearly to Hogeland's lands;\r\nand this with the fact that the Yagers and Grenadiers afterwards\r\nbivouacked \"in the wood not far from Bloomingdale,\" and that the\r\nBritish \"encamped in two lines\" at the same place, indicates the point\r\nwhere the action terminated--namely, near Bloomingdale, between\r\nHogeland's and Apthorpe's.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the beginning of the action, General Clinton, in his\r\naccount, starts with a locality called \"Martje Davits Fly,\" and\r\nestimates distances from it. This name, more properly \"Marritje\r\nDavid's Vly,\" strictly described the round piece of meadow at the\r\nwestern end of the Hollow Way close to the Hudson. It formed part of\r\nHarlem Cove. Old deeds, acts, and surveys give the name and site\r\nexactly. Clinton speaks of the \"Point of Martje David's Fly\" as if he\r\nhad reference to a point of land in its vicinity, possibly the Point\r\nof Rocks, and from which he gives his distances.\r\n\r\nThe name of the battle appears perhaps most frequently in modern\r\naccounts as that of Harlem _Plains_. Greene and others speak of it as\r\nthe action of Harlem _Heights_ or the heights of Harlem. As the\r\nmovements were directed by Washington from the Heights, and as the\r\nfighting was done practically in defence of the Heights, this seems to\r\nbe the proper name to adopt. Heath says the fighting took place \"on\r\nthe Heights west of Harlem Plains,\" and Washington, Clinton, and\r\nothers make similar references to the high ground, showing that the\r\naffair was not associated with the Plains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD of the HARLEM HEIGHTS \"AFFAIR\" Sept 16, 1776.\r\n\r\nTopography from RANDALL'S MAP OF NEW YORK and old Surveys.\r\n\r\nJ. Bien Photo. Lith. N.Y.]\r\n\r\nThis affair, as Washington wrote to Schuyler, \"inspirited our troops\r\nprodigiously.\" The next day the general most heartily thanked the men\r\n\"commanded by Major Leitch, who first advanced upon the enemy, and the\r\nothers who so resolutely supported them;\" and once more he called upon\r\nall to act up to the noble cause in which they were engaged.\r\n\r\nThe British loss, according to Howe, was fourteen killed and about\r\nseventy wounded, but Baurmeister puts it much higher--seventy killed\r\nand two hundred wounded. The Americans lost not far from eighty, of\r\nwhom at least twenty-five were killed or mortally wounded. The loss\r\nin officers, besides Knowlton and Leitch, included Captain Gleason, of\r\nNixon's Massachusetts, and Lieutenant Noel Allen, of Varnum's Rhode\r\nIsland, both of whom were killed. Captain Lowe, of Ewing's\r\nMarylanders, was wounded, also Captain Gooch, of Varnum's, slightly.\r\nThe heaviest loss fell upon Nixon's and Sargent's brigades, namely:\r\nNixon's regiment, four killed; Varnum's, four; Hitchcock's, four;\r\nSargent's, one; Bailey's, five, and two mortally wounded. Colonel\r\nDouglas lost three killed. Among the Marylanders there were twelve\r\nwounded and three missing. The loss in the Virginia detachment and\r\nthe Rangers does not appear. General Clinton on the next day buried\r\nseventeen of our men on the field, and reported over fifty wounded.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Henshaw, of Little's regiment, simply writes to his\r\nwife in regard to the action, \"I was there,\" and adds that our loss\r\nwas one hundred. He puts the casualties in his brigade alone [Nixon's]\r\nat seventy-five. All the troops behaved well. Greene speaks with pride\r\nof the conduct of his Rhode Islanders, Varnum's and Hitchcock's.\r\nCaptain Gooch wrote to a friend enthusiastically, \"The New England men\r\nhave gained the first Laurells;\" while Tilghman wrote with equal\r\nenthusiasm, \"The Virginia and Maryland troops bear the Palm.\" In\r\nreality, palm and laurel belonged to both alike.\r\n\r\nKnowlton, on the 17th, was buried with the honors of war near the road\r\non the hill slope, not far from the line of One Hundred and\r\nForty-third Street, west of Ninth Avenue. Leitch died on the 1st of\r\nOctober, and is said to have been buried by Knowlton's side, where\r\nMajor Thomas Henly, a Massachusetts officer, killed on Montressor's\r\nIsland on September 23d, was also buried.[205] On the 22d, Captain\r\nNathan Hale, \"the martyr-spy,\" was executed in New York. Finding\r\nWashington anxious to have information of the enemy's numbers and\r\ndesigns, Hale volunteered to enter their camp in disguise. Captured at\r\nthe last moment as he was on the point of escape, he frankly avowed\r\nhis mission, and just before his execution, on the Rutgers farm, he\r\ntold the spectators around him that he only regretted he had but one\r\nlife to give for his country. The war saw no more courageous or\r\nunselfish sacrifice. Few worthier of a monument than he!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Heath states that Henley was buried by Knowlton's side,\r\nand the spot is indicated in the orders of September 24th: \"Thomas\r\nHenley will be buried this P.M. from the quarters of Maj. David Henley\r\nbelow the hill where the redoubt is thrown up on the road.\" During the\r\naction of the 16th, troops were throwing up intrenchments across the\r\nisland at about One Hundred and Forty-fifth Street. This was the first\r\nand most southerly of the three lines constructed on the Heights.\r\nSauthier's map, the authority in the case, shows this line with a\r\nbattery across the King's Bridge Road, just at the top of what is\r\nknown as Breakneck Hill. It was on the slope of this hill that\r\nKnowlton and Henley were buried. Mr. Lossing puts his grave in one of\r\nthe redoubts on the second line, afterwards included in Trinity\r\nCemetery; but that line had not been thrown up when Knowlton died.\r\n(Silliman's letter of September 17th, P.M. Part II., page 55.) Mr. Jay\r\nand others have suggested the erection of a monument to Knowlton and\r\nLeitch. No finer site could be found than the spot where they fell in\r\nMorningside Park.\r\n\r\nRespecting Major Henley, spoken of by Washington as \"another of our\r\nbest officers,\" see Glover's letter, _Document_ 35.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of the 16th was followed by inactivity on the part of the\r\nBritish, and Washington securely established himself on Harlem\r\nHeights. The chief excitement was the occurrence of the great fire on\r\nthe night of the 21st of September, which broke out near Whitehall\r\nSlip, in New York, and destroyed a fourth of the city. In addition to\r\naccounts of the calamity already published and generally familiar, the\r\nexperiences of Pastor Shewkirk, as given in his diary in the present\r\nwork, will be read with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWHITE PLAINS--FORT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat now remains to be noticed as coming within the scope of the\r\npresent narrative are those incidents which led to the evacuation of\r\nHarlem Heights by our army, and the subsequent capture of Fort\r\nWashington, by which the British finally came into the possession of\r\nthe whole of New York Island.\r\n\r\nThe American position at the Heights, strong by nature, was made still\r\nmore so by defensive works. Three lines of intrenchments and redoubts\r\nwere thrown across the island between One Hundred and Forty-fifth and\r\nOne Hundred and Sixty-second streets; batteries were built around\r\nKing's Bridge, and at several points on the heights overlooking the\r\nHarlem; and on the commanding site on the line of One Hundred and\r\nEighty-third Street, two hundred and thirty feet above the Hudson,\r\nstood the powerful fortress called Fort Washington. Describing these\r\nworks more in detail, the first of the three lines, that furthest\r\nsouth, was the one already referred to on which troops were digging\r\nduring the action of Harlem Heights. It extended along the line of One\r\nHundred and Forty-sixth Street. The second line, which was much\r\nstronger, was laid out a short distance above at One Hundred and\r\nFifty-third Street. There were four redoubts in the line. Less than\r\nhalf a mile above, between One Hundred and Sixtieth and One Hundred\r\nand Sixty-second streets, and not extending east of Tenth Avenue, or\r\nthe old Post Road, was the third line. It mainly commanded the\r\ndepression in the heights which is now known as Audubon Park, and\r\nincluded no redoubts. In addition to this triple line, there were\r\nsingle breastworks and batteries at various points from Point of Rocks\r\nnorth, along the ridge. The high and rugged bank of the Harlem\r\noverlooking the present High Bridge was known as Laurel Hill, and at\r\nthe northern extremity, at One Hundred and Ninety-second Street, there\r\nwas an American battery, which the British afterwards named Fort\r\nGeorge. On the west side, at One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Street,\r\nthere was a small battery which became Fort Tryon. On the further side\r\nof Spuyten Duyvil Creek stood Fort Independence, commanding King's\r\nBridge and its approaches.[206]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: The position of the various works at Harlem Heights\r\nappears on Sauthier's plan which seems to have accompanied Howe's\r\nreport of the capture of Fort Washington. Good copies of it may be\r\nfound in Stedman's history and in the _New York Revolutionary MS._,\r\nvol. i. In 1812, when Randall surveyed the island, many of these works\r\nwere still traceable. He gives parts of the second and third lines,\r\nFort Washington and the others above, all of which agree with\r\nSauthier's locations. Some of the works remain well preserved to-day.]\r\n\r\nFort Washington was a large, five-sided work with bastions, strong by\r\nvirtue of its position, and important as commanding the passage of the\r\nHudson in connection with Fort Lee (first named Constitution),\r\nopposite, on the summit of the Palisades on the Jersey side. Much\r\nlabor had been expended upon it, and it was generally regarded as\r\nimpregnable. The obstructions in the river consisted mainly of a line\r\nof vessels chained together, loaded with stone, and then sunk and\r\nanchored just below the surface of the river. It was expected that\r\nthey would resist the passage of the British ships, which would thus\r\nbe also brought to a stop under the guns from either shore, and made\r\nto suffer heavily. Both the Continental Congress and the Provincial\r\nCongress of New York had urged that no means or expense should be\r\nspared to make the obstructions effectual, in view of the serious\r\nresults that would follow the enemy's possession of the river above.\r\n\r\nNearly a month now had elapsed since the retreat of our army to Harlem\r\nHeights, and the British had made no further progress. They had in the\r\nmean time thrown up a series of works across the island in front of\r\ntheir main camps at Bloomingdale and McGowan's Pass, which could be\r\ndefended by a comparatively small force. On the 9th, however, they\r\nshowed indications of taking the field again by sending two frigates\r\nup the Hudson. In spite of the sunken obstructions, the ships made\r\ntheir way through without difficulty. Then, on the morning of the\r\n12th, Howe embarked the greater part of his army in boats, and passing\r\nthrough Hell Gate, under cover of a fog, landed on Throg's Neck, an\r\narm of the Westchester coast, about six miles above. Percy was left to\r\nprotect New York with three brigades. By this move the British general\r\nplaced himself on Washington's flank in Westchester County, and\r\nthreatened his communications. But the Neck was a poor selection for a\r\nlanding-place.[207] It was practically an island, the crossings to\r\nthe mainland being a causeway and fords, the opposite approaches of\r\nwhich were fortified by the Americans. Colonel Hand's riflemen had\r\npulled up the planks on the bridges, and Prescott's Massachusetts were\r\nready behind breastworks to resist any attempt on the part of the\r\nenemy to cross. Here the British wasted five days in collecting their\r\nstores, while the Americans kept a sufficient force to meet them at\r\nthe causeway and vicinity. Among other regiments which relieved each\r\nother at this point were Nixon's, Varnum's, Malcom's, Graham's, and\r\nRitzema's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: \"Frog's Neck and Point is a kind of island; there are\r\ntwo passages to the main which are fordable at low water, at both of\r\nwhich we have thrown up works, which will give some annoyance should\r\nthey attempt to come off by either of these ways.\"--_Tilghman to\r\nWilliam Duer_, October 13th, 1776. _MS. Letter._ On hearing that they\r\nhad landed on the Neck, Duer replied from the Convention at Peekskill,\r\non the 15th: \"There appears to me an actual fatality attending all\r\ntheir measures. One would have naturally imagined from the Traitors\r\nthey have among them, who are capable of giving them the most minute\r\ndescription of the Grounds in the county of Westchester, that they\r\nwould have landed much farther to the Eastward. Had they pushed their\r\nimaginations to discover the worst place, they could not have\r\nsucceeded better than they have done.\"--_MS. Letter._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring and for some time before these movements an interesting\r\ncorrespondence was carried on between Washington's headquarters and a\r\ncommittee of the New York Convention, a portion of which may be\r\nintroduced in this connection. It gives us a glimpse of the deep\r\ninterest and anxiety felt in the Convention in matters affecting the\r\nprotection of the State, and the internal difficulties that had to be\r\nencountered. The correspondence was conducted mainly between\r\nLieutenant Tilghman for headquarters and Hon. William Duer for the\r\nConvention.[208] Thus, on September 20th, the latter writes to\r\nTilghman as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: The Convention's Committee on Correspondence consisted\r\nof William Duer, R.R. Livingston, Egbert Benson, and two others.\r\nNearly all of Tilghman's letters to the committee have been published\r\neither in Force or in the Proceedings of the N.Y. Provincial Congress.\r\nOf Duer's replies, however, but few are in print, the originals being\r\nin the possession of Oswald Tilghman, Esq., of Easton, Talbot County,\r\nMd., to whom the writer is under obligations for the favor of quoting\r\nthe extracts given in the text. (See biographical sketch of Colonel\r\nTilghman.)]\r\n\r\n     \"I can easily imagine that Genl Howe must be both\r\n     chagrined and disappointed at the Retreat of our Army from\r\n     New York. I have no doubt but what he expected fully to have\r\n     taken them in a net; and he certainly would have succeeded\r\n     had we pertinaciously persisted in the plan of defending the\r\n     city. You observe that if the passage of the North River is\r\n     sufficiently obstructed that our lines will keep the enemy\r\n     from making any progress in front. This is certainly true;\r\n     but you must recollect that the Sound is, and must ever be,\r\n     open; and if they should succeed in landing a Body of Men in\r\n     Westchester County, they might, by drawing lines to the\r\n     North River, as effectually hem us in, as if we were in New\r\n     York. From Sutton's Neck to the North River (if I am not\r\n     mistaken) is not above twelve miles.\"\r\n\r\nAgain on the 2d of October, speaking of the possibility of the enemy's\r\ngetting on our flank or rear, Duer says:\r\n\r\n     \"I wish they would delay this attempt till Genl. Lee\r\n     arrives, or till Mifflin comes from Philada. I am\r\n     sensible that however great General Washington's abilities\r\n     and vigilance are, he must stand in need of the assistance\r\n     of such excellent officers. Is Genl Greene with the Army,\r\n     or is he still in Jersey? If he could be spared from that\r\n     quarter his presence, I think, would be of great\r\n     consequence. I am much mistaken, if he is not possest of\r\n     that Heaven-born Genius which is necessary to constitute a\r\n     great General.--I can scarcely describe to you my feelings\r\n     at this interesting Period--what, with the situation of our\r\n     enemies in your quarter and the cursed machinations of our\r\n     Internal Foes, the fate of this State hangs on a single\r\n     battle of importance.\"\r\n\r\nAgain on the 8th:\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry to tell you (for the credit of this State) that\r\n     the Committee I belong to make daily fresh discoveries of\r\n     the infernal Practices of our Enemies to excite\r\n     Insurrections amongst the inhabitants of the State.\r\n     To-morrow one Company, actually enlisted in the enemy's\r\n     service, will be marched to Philadelphia, there to be\r\n     confined in jail, till the establishment of our Courts\r\n     enables us to hang the Ringleaders.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the following day Robert R. Livingston added on this subject:\r\n\r\n     \"Tho' we are constantly employed in the detection of\r\n     treasons, yet plots multiply upon us daily, and we have\r\n     reason every moment to dread an open rebellion. We have\r\n     ordered troops to be raised but fear they will be too slow\r\n     in coming, and that we shall be under the disagreeable\r\n     necessity of asking a small and temporary aid from the\r\n     Genl; but we shall defer this till reduced to the last\r\n     extremity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the ships went up the river on the 9th, it was feared they had\r\ntroops on board who might make an attempt on the Highlands, whereupon\r\nDuer wrote on the 10th:\r\n\r\n     \"In this [attempt] they will undoubtedly be joined by the\r\n     villains in Westchester and Duchess County; it is therefore\r\n     of the utmost consequence that a Force should be immediately\r\n     detached from the main body of our army to occupy these\r\n     posts.... By the Influence and Artifices of the capital\r\n     tories of this State the majority of Inhabitants in those\r\n     counties are ripe for a revolt.\"\r\n\r\nBut with a stout heart Duer continues:\r\n\r\n     \"It is our Duty, however, to struggle against the tide of\r\n     adversity, and to exert ourselves with vigour adequate to\r\n     our circumstances. This, as an Individual, I am determined\r\n     to do in the Capacity in which I am at present acting, and I\r\n     have no doubt those friends I have in the military line will\r\n     do the same. We are not to expect to purchase our Liberties\r\n     at a cheaper rate than other nations have done, or that\r\n     _our_ soldiers should be Heaven born more than those of\r\n     other nations. Experience will make us both have and win;\r\n     and in the end teach Great Britain that in attempting to\r\n     enslave us she is aiming a dagger at her own vitals.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, before he heard of the landing at Throg's Neck, he wrote\r\nto Tilghman:\r\n\r\n     \"Notwithstanding the enemy had, agreeable to your last\r\n     advices, sent no vessels up the Sound, depend upon it, they\r\n     will endeavor to make an attack upon your Flanks by means of\r\n     Hudson's and the East River.... If General Lee is returned\r\n     from the Southward and arrived at your camp (which I suppose\r\n     to be the case) I beg my affectionate compliments to him. I\r\n     wish to Heaven I could come and see you, but I am so\r\n     embarrassed with the Committee I am engaged in that I have\r\n     not hardly an hour, much less a few days to spare. This\r\n     morning we marched off a Company of men, who had been\r\n     enlisted to join the Battalion to be raised by Major Rogers,\r\n     to the City of Philadelphia. We have an admirable clue of\r\n     their abominable conspiracies, and (however late this\r\n     undertaking has been) I hope by spirit and perseverance we\r\n     may baffle their wretched Plots of occasioning a revolt in\r\n     this State.\"[209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: As evidence of the estimation in which Lee was held at\r\nthis time, Duer writes on the 15th to Colonel Harrison: \"I beg my\r\naffectionate compliments to Genl Lee, whom I sincerely congratulate\r\non his arrival in camp--partly on account of himself as he will have\r\nit in his [power] to reap a fresh Harvest of Laurels, and more on\r\naccount of his Country which looks to him as one of the brave\r\nasserters of her dearest rights.\"--_MS. Letter._\r\n\r\nLee had just returned from South Carolina, and was associated by the\r\narmy with the brave defence of Charleston harbor. The honor of that\r\naffair, however, belonged entirely to Moultrie.]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, Tilghman wrote to Duer:\r\n\r\n     \"When your favor of the 10th came to hand, I was attending\r\n     his Excellency, who was obliged to ride up to West Chester\r\n     upon the Alarm of the Enemy's Landing at Frog's Point....\r\n     From their not moving immediately forward, I imagine they\r\n     are waiting for their artillery and stores, which must be\r\n     very considerable if they seriously intend to set down in\r\n     the country upon our rear. The grounds leading from Frog's\r\n     Point towards our Post at King's bridge are as defensible as\r\n     they can be wished. The roads are all lined with stone\r\n     fences and the adjacent Fields divided off with stone\r\n     [fences] likewise, which will make it impossible for them to\r\n     advance their artillery and ammunition waggons by any other\r\n     Rout than the great roads, and I think if they are well\r\n     lined with troops, we may make a Considerable Slaughter if\r\n     not discomfit them totally. Our riflemen have directions to\r\n     attend particularly to taking down their Horses, which if\r\n     done, will impede their march effectually. Our troops are in\r\n     good spirits and seem inclined and determined to dispute\r\n     every inch of Ground.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th he wrote to Duer again as follows, after informing him\r\nthat the enemy had not moved from the Neck:\r\n\r\n     \"From the number of vessels that have been continually\r\n     passing up the Sound we conclude that they are transporting\r\n     cannon and stores necessary to enable them to penetrate the\r\n     country and set down in our rear. To hinder them from\r\n     effecting this, Genl Lee, who arrived yesterday, has\r\n     taken the command in that quarter. He will be posted in such\r\n     a situation with a very considerable number of Light Troops\r\n     that, let the Enemy advance by what road they will, they\r\n     cannot elude him; if they march in one great body he can\r\n     easily draw his Divisions together; if they divide and take\r\n     different Routs, they will fall in with the different\r\n     parties. He will have the Flower of the Army with him, as\r\n     our lines in front are so strong that we can trust them to\r\n     Troops who would not stand in the field.\"\r\n\r\nDuer, on the 17th, replied:\r\n\r\n     \"I expect daily to hear of some grand attempt made by the\r\n     Enemy.... If one half of our army think as much of the\r\n     Importance of the approaching Contest as you do, I shall\r\n     entertain no Doubt of our success. May Heaven protect you,\r\n     and all my Friends who are venturing their Lives in so great\r\n     and good a cause.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same date Tilghman wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"I have not time to describe the Disposition of our Army\r\n     perfectly to you, but you may depend that every step is\r\n     taken to prevent the enemy from outflanking us and at the\r\n     same time to secure our Retreat in case of need. The Enemy\r\n     have made no move from Frog's Point.... I don't know how it\r\n     is, but I believe their design to circumvent us this time\r\n     will prove as abortive as the former ones. If we can but\r\n     foil Genl Howe again, I think we knock him up for the\r\n     Campaign. You ask if Genl Lee is in Health and our people\r\n     feel bold? I answer both in the affirmative. His appearance\r\n     among us has not contributed a little to the latter. We are\r\n     sinking the ships as fast as possible; 200 men are daily\r\n     employed, but they take an immense quantity of stone for the\r\n     purpose.\"\r\n\r\nTo meet this move upon their flank and rear, the Americans were\r\nobliged to abandon their strong camp at Harlem Heights. On the 16th,\r\nwhile the British were still at Throg's Neck, Washington called a\r\ncouncil of war, when it was agreed that they could not keep their\r\ncommunications open with the back country, if they remained where they\r\nwere and the British advanced. At the same it was voted to hold Fort\r\nWashington. To be ready to counteract the next move of the enemy, a\r\npart of the army was stationed at advantageous points in Westchester\r\nCounty, the main camps being extended along the hills west of the\r\nBronx River. Both Valentine's Hill and Miles Square were occupied and\r\nfortified.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, Howe left Throg's Neck and transferred his army further\r\neastward to Pell's Point below New Rochelle. The Light Infantry\r\nadvanced from the coast, but were faced by Glover's brigade from\r\nbehind stone walls, and made to suffer some loss.[210] Glover and his\r\nmen were complimented for their conduct both by Washington and Lee.\r\nThe enemy again delayed in the vicinity of East Chester and New\r\nRochelle until the 22d.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: In this skirmish Captain Evelyn, the British officer\r\nwho captured the patrol of American officers on Long Island, was\r\nmortally wounded, and died soon after, much regretted. He is supposed\r\nto have been buried in New York.]\r\n\r\nWishing exact information of the position of the enemy and of the\r\ntopography of the country, the commander-in-chief, on the morning of\r\nthe 20th, requested Colonel Reed and Colonel Putnam, his engineer, to\r\nundertake a reconnoissance in person. Setting out from King's Bridge\r\nwith a foot-guard of twenty men, these officers proceeded to the\r\nheights at East Chester, where they saw some of the enemy near the\r\nchurch, but could obtain no intelligence. The houses in the vicinity\r\nwere deserted. From this point Reed returned to attend to his office\r\nduties, while Putnam, disguising his appearance as an officer by\r\ntaking out his cockade, loping his hat, and concealing his sword and\r\npistols under his loose coat, continued on alone in the direction of\r\nWhite Plains. Learning from a woman at a house that the British were\r\nat New Rochelle, he passed on to within three or four miles of White\r\nPlains, where he met some \"friends to the cause\" and ascertained the\r\ngeneral situation. \"I found,\" he writes, \"that the main body of the\r\nBritish lay near New Rochelle, from thence to White Plains about nine\r\nmiles, good roads and in general level open country, that at White\r\nPlains was a large quantity of stores, with only about three hundred\r\nmilitia to guard them, that the British had a detachment at Mamaroneck\r\nonly six miles from White Plains, and from White Plains only five\r\nmiles to the North River, where lay five or six of the enemies ships\r\nand sloops, tenders, etc. Having made these discoveries, I set out on\r\nmy return.\" Reporting this information to the commander-in-chief about\r\nnine o'clock in the evening, Colonel Putnam retired to \"refresh\"\r\nhimself and horse, only to receive orders soon after to proceed\r\nimmediately to Lord Stirling's brigade,[211] now in Spencer's\r\ndivision, which had already advanced on the road towards White Plains.\r\nHe reached Stirling at two o'clock that night, and at dawn the general\r\npushed on to White Plains, arriving there about nine o'clock on the\r\nmorning of the 21st. Washington himself and Heath's division followed\r\nduring the day, and the troops set to work throwing up lines at that\r\nimportant point. By delaying near New Rochelle, Howe had missed his\r\nopportunity. During the night of the 21st, Colonel Haslet, of\r\nStirling's brigade, surprised and captured some thirty men belonging\r\nto the partisan Rogers' Scouts, and soon after Colonel Hand with his\r\nnow veteran riflemen proved himself more than a match for an equal\r\nparty of yagers encountered near Mamaroneck. In the first of these\r\nskirmishes, Major Greene, a fine Virginia officer, was mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Stirling, who with Sullivan had recently been exchanged\r\nas prisoner, was now in command of Mifflin's brigade, Mifflin being\r\nabsent in Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nWashington concentrated his army at White Plains, completed two lines\r\nof works, with his right on the river Bronx, and awaited the advance\r\nof the British. Howe had moved from New Rochelle to Scarsdale, and on\r\nthe morning of the 28th marched against the Americans. A mile or more\r\nfrom White Plains, on the main road to New York, he fell in with\r\nGeneral Spencer's advance parties under Colonels Silliman,\r\nDouglas,[212] and Chester, who offered resistance and lost some men,\r\nbut they were driven back by superior numbers. On the left of the\r\nAmerican position, across the Bronx, rose Chatterton's Hill, which\r\noffered a good site for the better defence of that flank. Colonel\r\nPutnam had just arrived on the hill to throw up works when the enemy\r\nmade their appearance below.[213] According to Haslet, the Delawares\r\nwere the first troops to report on this hill, where they took post\r\nwith one of General Lincoln's Massachusetts militia regiments, under\r\nColonel Brooks, on their right. They were followed immediately by\r\nMcDougall's brigade, consisting of what was lately his own battalion,\r\nwhich had no field officers, Ritzema's, Smallwood's, and Webb's. The\r\ntroops formed along the brow of the hill, and stood waiting for the\r\nenemy. The two-gun battery brought up at the same time was Captain\r\nAlexander Hamilton's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: See letters of these officers, _Documents_ 17, 22. Also\r\nTallmadge's account, _Document_ 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: \"October 29th [28th] the British advanced in front of\r\nour lines at White Plains about 10 o'clock A.M. I had just arrived on\r\nChatterton Hill in order to throw up some works when they hove in\r\nsight; as soon as they discovered us they commenced a severe cannonade\r\nbut without any effect of consequence. General McDougal about this\r\ntime arriving with his brigade from Burtis's and observing the British\r\nto be crossing the Bronx below in large bodies in order to attack us,\r\nour troops were posted to receive them in a very advantageous\r\nposition. The British in their advance were twice repulsed; at length,\r\nhowever, their numbers were increased so that they were able to turn\r\nour right flank. We lost many men, but from information afterwards\r\nreceived there was reason to believe they lost many more than we. The\r\nrail and stone fence behind which our troops were posted proved as\r\nfatal to the British as the rail fence and grass hung on it did at\r\nCharlestown the 17th of June 1775.\"--_Colonel Rufus Putnam, Document_\r\n43.]\r\n\r\nThe British marched up in brilliant array towards Washington's\r\nposition, but unexpectedly declined to make an attack in front,\r\nalthough the centre was our weakest point. Chatterton's Hill appeared\r\nto engage Howe's attention at once, and it became the first object of\r\ncapture. The troops assigned for this purpose were the Second British\r\nbrigade and Hessians under Donop, Rall, and Lossberg, in all about\r\nfour thousand men. They crossed the Bronx, under cover of their\r\nartillery, and prepared to ascend the somewhat abrupt face of the hill\r\non the other side. McDougall's men reserved their fire until the enemy\r\nwere within short range, when they poured a destructive shower of\r\nbullets upon them. The British recoiled, but moved up again to the\r\nattack, while Rall came around more on the left, and after a brisk\r\nfight, in which the militia facing Rall failed to stand their ground,\r\nthey succeeded in compelling McDougall to retreat. Had the militia\r\nheld their own, the fight might have been another Bunker Hill for the\r\nenemy. As it was, Colonel Putnam compared it to that engagement. In\r\nfalling back, McDougall suffered some loss, but the whole force\r\nescaped to the right of our lines, with fewer casualties than they\r\ninflicted on the enemy. The latter lost about two hundred and thirty;\r\nthe Americans something over one hundred and forty. Colonel Smallwood\r\nwas wounded, and lost two of his captains, killed. Ritzema's New York\r\nContinentals suffered the most, having made a brave fight.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Samuel B. Webb, of Wethersfield, Ct., one of\r\nWashington's aids, who had shown his coolness under fire on Bunker\r\nHill, was slightly wounded and had a horse shot under him while\r\ncarrying orders.[214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Statement of his son, General James Watson Webb, of New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nThis affair on Chatterton's Hill is known as the Battle of White\r\nPlains. On the side of the Americans, not more than sixteen hundred\r\ntroops were engaged, but the action was an important one, as it had\r\nthe effect of changing the direction of future operations.[215]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: The details of the various movements in Westchester\r\nCounty would fill a long and interesting chapter; but in the present\r\nconnection not more than an outline can be attempted.]\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 29th, Howe waited for reinforcements. On the\r\n30th, the rain postponed an intended attack. On the 31st the weather\r\nproved fine about noon, but the British General \"did not think proper\r\nto put his former intentions in execution.\" The next morning, November\r\n1st, there was a further excuse for not attacking: Washington during\r\nthe night had fallen back to the almost unassailable heights of North\r\nCastle, in his rear. Howe was thus again baffled in his attempt to\r\nbring the Americans to a decisive engagement, or to surround them, and\r\nhe now turned his attention to another line of campaign. Stedman, the\r\nBritish historian, probably gives the correct reason why Washington\r\nwas not followed. The American position, he says, was now \"so\r\nadvantageous that any attack on them must have proved unsuccessful,\r\nfor the river Croton stretched along their front, and their rear was\r\ndefended by woods and heights. Convinced that it was part of the\r\nenemy's system studiously to avoid an action, and that their knowledge\r\nof the country enabled them to execute this system with advantage,\r\nGeneral Howe resolved to cease an ineffectual pursuit, and employ\r\nhimself in the reduction of King's Bridge and Fort Washington.\" This\r\naccomplished, he could then push on to Philadelphia and close the\r\nyear's operations with the occupation of that place. The capture of\r\ntwo cities, the successive defeats inflicted upon the Americans, and\r\nthe good prospect of ending the rebellion in the next campaign, would\r\nbe a brilliant military record with which to gratify the home\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nHowe broke up his camp near White Plains on November 5th, and marched\r\nwest to the Hudson at Dobb's Ferry. Knyphausen, who had lately arrived\r\nwith a second division of \"foreigners,\" had already been despatched to\r\nKing's Bridge. After various movements and delays, the entire British\r\nforce also moved on the 12th to the immediate vicinity of the bridge,\r\nand dispositions were made to attack and capture Fort Washington. On\r\nthe 15th, Howe sent a summons for the surrender of the fort, in which\r\nhe intimated that a refusal to comply would justify the putting of the\r\ngarrison to the sword.\r\n\r\nThe commander of Fort Washington was Colonel Robert Magaw, of\r\nPennsylvania. In addition to his own regiment and Colonel Shee's, now\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Cadwallader, he had with him several\r\ndetachments of troops from the Pennsylvania Flying Camp, under\r\nColonels Baxter, Swoope, and others, together with a Maryland rifle\r\nbattalion, under Colonel Rawlings, whose major was Otho Holland\r\nWilliams, an officer distinguished later in the war. The artillery\r\nnumbered about one hundred men, under Captain Pierce, and there were\r\nalso the \"Rangers,\" parts of Miles's and Atlee's old regiments, such\r\nas escaped the Long Island defeat, and about two hundred and fifty\r\nfrom Bradley's Connecticut levies, many of whom were to die in\r\ncaptivity. The whole force under Magaw numbered about twenty-eight\r\nhundred officers and men. The ground they were expected to hold was\r\nthat part of Harlem Heights from the first of the three lines already\r\ndescribed, northward to the end of Laurel Hill on the Harlem, and the\r\nhill west on the Hudson, a distance of two miles and a half.\r\n\r\nAt the lower lines at One Hundred and Forty-sixth Street,\r\nCadwallader's men, the Rangers, and some others were posted; at Laurel\r\nHill, Colonel Baxter, and west of him, at the northern termination of\r\nthe level summit of the ridge where Fort Washington stood, was Colonel\r\nRawlings. Magaw remained at the fort to direct movements during the\r\nattack. The outer defences where the troops were stationed were to be\r\nheld as long as possible, while the fort and the intrenchments\r\nimmediately surrounding it were to be the point of retreat. Magaw\r\nbelieved he could hold the post against almost any force until\r\nDecember, and when the summons for a surrender reached him he returned\r\nthe following spirited reply:\r\n\r\n     \"15 NOVEMBER, 1776.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: If I rightly understand the purport of your message\r\n     from General Howe communicated to Colonel Swoope, this post\r\n     is to be immediately surrendered or the garrison put to the\r\n     sword. I rather think it a mistake than a settled resolution\r\n     in General Howe to act a part so unworthy of himself and the\r\n     British Nation. But give me leave to assure his Excellency\r\n     that actuated by the most glorious cause that mankind ever\r\n     fought in, I am determined to defend this post to the last\r\n     extremity.\r\n\r\n     \"ROB'T MAGAW, Colonel Commanding.\r\n\r\n     \"To the Adjutant-General of the British Army.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th, the enemy opened the attack from three\r\ndirections.[216] The Hessians moved forward from King's Bridge against\r\nRawlings' position, Rall on the right nearest to the Hudson,\r\nKnyphausen a short distance to his left nearer the King's Bridge road.\r\nBrigadier-General Matthews, supported by Cornwallis, came down the\r\nHarlem from the bridge in boats, and landed at the foot of Laurel Hill\r\n(One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Street), where Baxter was posted. These\r\nformed the attacking columns from the north side. On the south side\r\nPercy marched up from Harlem Plains and engaged Cadwallader at the\r\nlower lines.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Consult \"Map of New York,\" etc., Part II.]\r\n\r\nAt about the moment the cannonade began, Washington, Putnam, Greene,\r\nand Mercer were putting off from the Jersey shore at Fort Lee to make\r\na final visit to Fort Washington, and determine whether to defend or\r\nevacuate the post. When they reached the island they found the\r\nthreatened attack in actual progress, and evacuation then was out of\r\nthe question. They saw Percy making his dispositions, and could see\r\nnothing to modify on their own side. All they could do was to await\r\nthe result. \"There,\" says Greene, \"we all stood in a very awkward\r\nsituation.\" Had they remained much longer it would have been more than\r\nawkward. Putnam, Greene, and Mercer felt that Washington at least\r\nought not to be exposed in a position which might become dangerous,\r\nand they all urged him to return to Fort Lee, while each in turn\r\noffered to stay and conduct the defence. But the chief, who never\r\nwished to hold the fort as an isolated post, foresaw the possible, if\r\nnot the probable, result of the British attack as clearly as his\r\ngenerals, and he advised the return of the entire party. Entering\r\ntheir boat they were rowed back to the Jersey side.[217]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Read the letter Greene wrote to Knox on the following\r\nday.--_Document_ 36.]\r\n\r\nThe fighting began under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery\r\nposted at advantageous points, both on the island and on the east side\r\nof the Harlem River. The several columns pushed forward nearly at the\r\nsame time. Rall and Knyphausen encountered the most serious obstacles,\r\nand met with the most obstinate resistance. Their course lay through\r\nwoods and underbrush and heavy abattis, felled by the Americans. As\r\nthey approached Rawlings, his men received them with a destructive and\r\ndetermined fire, which lasted a long time. Rall's force, including the\r\nnewly arrived Waldeckers, fought desperately, and, as Cornwallis\r\nafterwards declared, \"to the admiration of the entire British\r\narmy.\"[218] Knyphausen led his men and tore down obstructions with his\r\nown hands. Matthews and Cornwallis climbed up the steep hill, and\r\ndrove back Baxter's men; but not before Baxter had fallen while\r\nfighting manfully. Percy, with whose column Lord Howe had taken his\r\nstation, held Cadwallader's attention and made some progress in that\r\ndirection, when Howe ordered a fourth column, consisting of the\r\nForty-second Highlanders, under Lieutenant-Colonel Sterling, and two\r\nsupporting regiments, to cross Harlem River, and attempt to land\r\nbetween Cadwallader and Fort Washington. This movement was\r\nsuccessfully conducted under difficulties. The Highlanders rushed up\r\nthe steep side of Harlem Heights just below the Morris Mansion, and\r\ncaptured over one hundred and fifty of the Americans whom Cadwallader\r\nand Magaw had detached to oppose them. Sterling's force, however,\r\nsuffered considerably in making the landing. By this attack in flank,\r\nCadwallader could maintain his position no longer, and his entire\r\nparty retreated rapidly towards the fort.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Testimony of Cornwallis before Parliamentary Committee\r\non Howe's case in 1779.]\r\n\r\nKnyphausen and Rall, meanwhile, succeeded in driving back Rawlings,\r\nwho had made the best resistance during the day, and the former soon\r\nreached Fort Washington, where all the Americans had now retreated.\r\nThe German general at once sent in a summons for surrender, and Magaw\r\nfinding that the fort was so crowded with his beaten troops, and that\r\nit was impossible to attempt further resistance without great\r\nsacrifice of life, agreed to a capitulation on favorable terms,\r\nofficers and men to be guaranteed personal safety and allowed to\r\nretain private baggage.[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Washington, who with his officers watched the fighting\r\nfrom Fort Lee, sent over Captain Gooch to tell Magaw to maintain\r\nhimself until night, when an effort would be made to withdraw the\r\ngarrison to New Jersey. The captain reached the fort, delivered his\r\nmessage, and, running through the fire of the enemy, got to his boat\r\nagain and recrossed in safety.]\r\n\r\nBy this surrender the Americans lost in prisoners two thousand six\r\nhundred and thirty-seven enlisted men and two hundred and twenty-one\r\nofficers,[220] the greater part from Pennsylvania, and nearly half of\r\nthem well-drilled troops. These were the men, with those taken on Long\r\nIsland and at Kip's Bay, for whose accommodation the Presbyterian and\r\nReformed churches in New York were turned into prisons, and who were\r\nto perish by hundreds by slow starvation and loathsome disease, which\r\nbrutal keepers took little trouble to alleviate. The loss of the enemy\r\nin killed and wounded was something over four hundred and fifty, about\r\ntwo thirds of which fell upon the Hessians. The American casualties\r\nwere four officers and fifty privates killed, and not over one hundred\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: Henshaw's copy of return of prisoners.--_Document No._\r\n59.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon whom the responsibility for the loss of this post should rest is\r\na question on which divided opinions have been expressed.[221] Greene\r\nhad urged the retention of the fort as necessary, both to command the\r\npassage of the river, and because it would be a threatening obstacle\r\nto the enemy's future operations. For them to advance into the country\r\nwith such a fortification in their rear would be a hazardous move.\r\nThese reasons were sound, and, as already stated, when the main army\r\nevacuated Harlem Heights, Washington's council voted to retain Fort\r\nWashington. But on the 7th of November, some British men-of-war again\r\npassed the obstructions without difficulty, and Washington wrote to\r\nGreene on the 8th from White Plains as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: The late passage of the three vessels up the North\r\n     River (which we have just received advice of) is so plain a\r\n     proof of the inefficacy of all the obstructions we have\r\n     thrown into it, that I cannot but think it will fully\r\n     justify a change in the disposition which has been made. If\r\n     we cannot prevent vessels passing up, and the enemy are\r\n     possessed of the surrounding country, what valuable purpose\r\n     can it answer to attempt to hold a post from which the\r\n     expected benefit cannot be had? I am therefore inclined to\r\n     think it will not be prudent to hazard the men and stores at\r\n     Mount Washington; but as you are on the spot, leave it to\r\n     you to give such orders as to evacuating Mount Washington as\r\n     you judge best, and so far revoking the order given to Col.\r\n     Magaw to defend it to the last.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: Two weeks before the attack on the fort, Magaw's\r\nadjutant, William Demont, deserted to the enemy. This fact has lately\r\nbeen established by the recovery, by Mr. Edward F. de Lancey, of the\r\nNew York Historical Society, of Demont's own letter confessing the\r\ndesertion. It is dated London, January 16th, 1792, and is in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"On the 2d of Nov'r 1776 I Sacrificed all I was Worth in the World to\r\nthe Service of my King & Country and joined the then Lord Percy,\r\nbrought in with me the Plans of Fort Washington, by which Plans that\r\nFortress was taken by his Majesty's Troops the 16 instant, Together\r\nwith 2700 Prisoners and Stores & Ammunition to the amount of 1800\r\nPound. At the same time, I may with Justice affirm, from my Knowledge\r\nof the Works, I saved the Lives of many of His Majesty's\r\nSubjects--these Sir are facts well-known to every General Officer\r\nwhich was there.\"\r\n\r\nMr. De Lancey makes this letter the text of a detailed and highly\r\ninteresting account of the fall of Fort Washington (published in the\r\n_Magazine of American History_, February, 1877), in which the new\r\ntheory is advanced that the disaster was due in the first instance to\r\nDemont's treason. It is quite probable, as the deserter claimed, that\r\nhis information was of some use to the British general in making his\r\ndispositions for the attack, but beyond this the incident could hardly\r\nhave affected the situation on either side. Up to the night preceding\r\nthe assault, Howe did not know whether the Americans would remain in\r\nthe fort or not. Indeed, he gave them the opportunity to evacuate it\r\nby allowing a whole night to intervene between the summons to\r\nsurrender and the attack. He could not, therefore, have changed his\r\nplans, as alleged, in the confident expectation of taking a large\r\ngarrison prisoners and sending home word of another great victory.\r\nFort Washington was simply in his way, and he would have moved against\r\nit under any circumstances, regardless of Demont and his treachery.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene on the following day replied that he did not think the\r\ngarrison in any danger, and that it could be drawn off at any time.\r\nHe believed, too, that the stores could be removed at the last moment,\r\nin spite of an attack; and again he called attention to the advantage\r\nof holding the post as an annoyance to the enemy. No further\r\ncommunications passed on the subject, but Washington rode to the\r\nHighlands, and, returning on the Jersey side of the Hudson, reached\r\nGreene's headquarters at Fort Lee on the 14th, to find no steps taken\r\nto withdraw men or stores from Mount Washington. Had the enemy in the\r\nmean time invested and captured the fort, it is pertinent to inquire\r\nwhether Greene, having been acquainted with the distinct wishes of the\r\ncommander-in-chief not to hazard the post, could not have been justly\r\nand properly charged with its loss. Washington's instructions were\r\ndiscretionary only so far as related to the details or perhaps the\r\ntime of the evacuation; and to leave Greene free, he revoked the order\r\nalready given to Magaw to defend the fort to the last. Upon the\r\narrival of Washington at Fort Lee, however, one phase of the question\r\nchanged. By not renewing his instructions to evacuate the mount when\r\nhe found that nothing had been done in the case, or not making the\r\ninstructions peremptory, he entirely relieved Greene of the charge of\r\nnon-compliance, which could have been brought against him before. The\r\ncommander-in-chief was now present, and Greene was no longer under\r\ninstructions, discretionary or otherwise. Washington accepted the\r\nsituation as he now found it, and was reconsidering the propriety of a\r\ntotal evacuation. Finding Greene, of whose military judgment he had \"a\r\ngood opinion,\" strong in favor of holding the post, and others\r\nagreeing with him, among whom evidently were Putnam, Mercer, and\r\nMagaw, and knowing that Congress and the country would not easily be\r\nreconciled to its abandonment, Washington hesitated for the moment to\r\nenforce his own views and opinions. On the 14th and 15th, he still\r\ndelayed a final decision. So says Greene. \"His Excellency General\r\nWashington,\" he writes, \"has been with me several days. The evacuation\r\nor reinforcement of Fort Washington was under consideration, but\r\nfinally nothing concluded on;\" and it was not until the morning of the\r\n16th, just at the time of the attack, that they all went over to the\r\nfort \"to determine what was best to be done.\" This clearly settles the\r\nfact that Greene was not under instructions at the time of the\r\nsurrender of the post.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, upon a review of all the circumstances, it is\r\ndifficult to escape the conviction that but for General Greene's\r\nearnest opposition to an abandonment of the fort, the disaster would\r\nnot have occurred. It was an error of judgment, an over-confidence in\r\nthe sufficiency of the preparations made for the defence, and a belief\r\nthat if matters came to the worst the garrison could be withdrawn in\r\nspite of the enemy. That Greene himself felt that he would be held\r\nlargely accountable for the loss of the post, is evident from his own\r\nexpressions in the letter he wrote to Knox on the next day. \"I feel\r\nmad, vexed, sick, and sorry,\" are his words. \"Never did I need the\r\nconsoling voice of a friend more than now. Happy should I be to see\r\nyou. This is a most terrible event; its consequences are justly to be\r\ndreaded. Pray, what is said upon the occasion?\"[222]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: This is what Tilghman said upon the occasion: \"The loss\r\nof the post is nothing compared to the loss of men and arms, and the\r\ndamp it will strike upon the minds of many. We were in a fair way of\r\nfinishing the campaign with credit to ourselves and I think to the\r\ndisgrace of Mr. Howe, and had the General followed his own opinion the\r\ngarrison would have been withdrawn immediately upon the enemy's\r\nfalling down from Dobb's Ferry; but Gen'l Greene was positive that our\r\nforces might at any time be drawn off under the guns of Fort Lee.\r\nFatal experience has evinced the contrary.\"--_Correspondence in\r\nProceedings of the N.Y. Provincial Congress_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nThere were those who censured Washington for not overruling Greene,\r\nbut the chief kept his counsels to himself, and it was not until\r\nnearly three years later, in August, 1779, that he gave his version of\r\nthe affair in a private letter to Colonel Reed. In that he frankly\r\nadmits that Greene's representations and other reasons caused a\r\n\"warfare\" and \"hesitation\" in his mind, by which the evacuation was\r\ndelayed until too late. But he indulged in no censures on Greene. His\r\nconfidence in the latter remained steadfast. The disaster was one of\r\nthose misfortunes which occur in the career of every great general,\r\nand become, indeed, a step by which he rises to greatness. Greene,\r\nmore than any general of the Revolution, learned by experience. Every\r\nbattle, whether a defeat or victory, was for him a training-school;\r\nand at the close of the war we find him ranking hardly second to the\r\ncommander-in-chief, in military talents, and enjoying nearly an equal\r\nreputation for his achievements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis disaster at Fort Washington, the heaviest suffered by the\r\nAmericans during the entire war, closed the campaign in the vicinity\r\nof New York. All the western part of Long Island, New York City, and\r\nall Manhattan Island, had fallen into the possession of the British,\r\nand their fleet came into undisturbed control of the Hudson, the East\r\nRiver, and the waters of the Sound. Every thing that Washington and\r\nhis soldiers had sought to secure and defend was wrested from their\r\nhands. Their losses too, in men and material, were almost\r\nirreparable. Much the greater part of their artillery had been\r\ncaptured--two hundred and eighteen pieces of all calibres, according\r\nto the enemy's report. Three hundred and twenty-nine officers and four\r\nthousand one hundred men had been taken prisoners; nearly six hundred\r\nhad been killed or wounded; and numbers had been swept off by disease.\r\nThe enemy suffered more heavily, except in prisoners and cannon, in\r\nwhich their loss was nothing; but they had recovered territory, won\r\nvictories, and they were now to find before them only a flying and\r\ndissolving body of rebels.\r\n\r\nThe situation at this point presented a gloomy prospect for America.\r\nBut had the cause been then surrendered, we could still contemplate\r\nthis struggle around New York and Brooklyn with respect, as a noble\r\neffort to gain an end worth fighting for. As success, however, was\r\nfinally achieved, and achieved through the experience of these events,\r\nthey challenge our deepest interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTRENTON--PRINCETON--CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the full significance of what has been described in the\r\npreceding pages, follow the campaign in outline to its closing scenes.\r\n\r\nThus far the American army had met with nothing but defeat, retreat,\r\nsacrifice, hardship, and discouragement. First came the months of\r\npreparation, with England straining every nerve to conquer the\r\ncolonies; then the first and disastrous collision on Long Island, on\r\nwhich so much depended; then the retreat, the loss of New York, the\r\nwithdrawal to White Plains, and a battle which was not a victory for\r\nthe Americans; and, finally, the heavy blow struck in the fall of Fort\r\nWashington. Much had been endured and learned alike by general and\r\nprivate soldier during these gloomy months, and both were now destined\r\nto profit by the trial. All this faith and patience had its legitimate\r\nreward, as we shall find if we now place ourselves in the last days of\r\nthe year upon the banks of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nWhat had occurred in the mean time was the evacuation of Fort Lee, a\r\nhasty retreat through New Jersey, the dwindling away of the army, the\r\nadvance of the British towards Philadelphia, the removal of Congress\r\nto Baltimore, and an increase of despondency throughout the\r\ncountry.[223] Washington with the remnants of his army had taken post\r\non the right bank of the Delaware, and, still strong in hope, was\r\ncalling for militia to come to his assistance. At the same time he\r\nwatched the opportunity to inflict upon the enemy some happy\r\ncounter-stroke that might temporarily raise the spirits of his\r\nsoldiers and the people. The opportunity came. The British delayed\r\ncrossing the Delaware, and divided their force among different posts\r\nthroughout New Jersey. At Trenton they stationed Colonel Rall with a\r\nbody twelve hundred strong, composed chiefly of Hessians. This was the\r\nRall who marched up with De Heister on Long Island, and figured in the\r\ncapture of prisoners, who afterwards turned our right on Chatterton's\r\nHill, at White Plains, and whose attack on Rawlings at Fort Washington\r\nwas the brilliant feature of that day. He was every inch a soldier,\r\nexcept in possessing that reserve of caution which every commander is\r\nbound to exercise in the presence of an enemy, however remote the\r\nprobability of an attack. Rall despised Washington's troops, and would\r\nthrow up no intrenchments around Trenton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: After the battle of White Plains, Howe, we have seen,\r\nmoved against Fort Washington. On the other hand, Washington,\r\nsupposing that Howe would aim next for Philadelphia, prepared to cross\r\npart of his force into Jersey and endeavor to protect that city. He\r\nproposed to continue the policy of \"wasting\" the campaign. Heath was\r\nleft to look after the Highlands; Lee with another force remained at\r\nNorthcastle, and Connecticut troops were posted at Saw Pits and the\r\nborders of that State. Washington took with him Putnam, Greene,\r\nStirling, and Mercer, with less than four thousand men, and fell back\r\nbefore the British through Brunswick, Princeton, and Trenton. He wrote\r\nseveral times to Lee to join him, but Lee was full of excuses and\r\nutterly failed Washington at this crisis. While marching in no haste\r\nby a westerly route through Jersey, Lee was surprised at his quarters\r\nat Baskingridge on the morning of December 13th, and made prisoner by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Harcourt and a party of dragoons. (The account of\r\nthe capture by Captain Bradford, Lee's aid, not heretofore published,\r\nis given in _Document_ 46. In Wilkinson's _Memoirs_ there is another\r\naccount.) Sullivan then took command of Lee's troops and joined\r\nWashington, who at Trenton had crossed to the Pennsylvania side of the\r\nDelaware, removing all boats to delay the enemy, and had halted in\r\ncamp a few miles above.]\r\n\r\nWashington resolved to make a sudden dash upon this Hessian. A\r\nsurprise, an irresistible attack, the capture of a post with a\r\nthousand men, might work wonders in their moral effect. The soldiers\r\nwith him were trusty men, twenty-four hundred of whom he proposed to\r\nlead himself on this enterprise. Many of the regiments we have already\r\nbecome familiar with, and their leaders are men who have led them from\r\nthe first. Here are Greene, Sullivan, Stirling, Mercer, Glover, and\r\nSargent, for division and brigade commanders; and with them we meet\r\nnew officers--Brigadier-Generals Adam Stephen, of Virginia; Arthur St.\r\nClair, of Pennsylvania, and De Fermoy, a French officer, lately\r\ncommissioned by Congress. Here also are Hand's battalion, parts of\r\nSmallwood's and Haslet's, Knox and his artillerymen, Durkee's, Charles\r\nWebb's, Ward's, and parts of Chester's and Bradley's, from\r\nConnecticut; Sargent's, Glover's, Hutchinson's, Baldwin's, Shepherd's,\r\nBailey's, and Paterson's, of Massachusetts; Stark's, Poor's, and\r\nReed's, from New Hampshire, who, with Paterson's, have just arrived in\r\ncamp from Ticonderoga; the remnants of McDougall's and Ritzema's New\r\nYork Continentals, and Weedon's, Scott's, Elliot's, Buckner's, and\r\nReed's Virginians. How depleted are these battalions, many of them\r\nless than a hundred strong!\r\n\r\nWashington's plan included a simultaneous move from several points.\r\nThe body he was to lead was concentrated, on the night of December\r\n24th, at McConkey's Ferry, nine miles above Trenton. The troops were\r\nto cross at night, reach the town at dawn, and take its garrison by\r\nsurprise. Lower down were two other bodies of troops. About opposite\r\nTrenton, General Ewing was posted with Pennsylvania militia and\r\nNixon's Continental brigade, now commanded by Colonel Daniel\r\nHitchcock, of Rhode Island. At Bristol, General Cadwallader commanded\r\nstill another corps of Pennsylvanians, including many young men from\r\nthe best families in Philadelphia. Ewing and Cadwallader were to cross\r\nand intercept the retreat of the Hessians from Trenton, or prevent\r\nDonop at Burlington from affording relief. Putnam was to make a\r\ndemonstration from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nTo his own force Washington issued minute and stringent orders. The\r\ntroops he divided into two divisions, giving Sullivan the first, and\r\nGreene the second. Sullivan's brigades were Glover's, Sargent's, and\r\nSt. Clair's; Greene's were Stephen's, Mercer's, and Stirling's. De\r\nFermoy was to follow in Greene's rear with Hand's riflemen and\r\nHausegger's German battalion from Pennsylvania. To each brigade were\r\nattached from two to four pieces of artillery, eighteen guns in all,\r\nunder Knox. Greene's division was to cross first, Stephen's in\r\nadvance, provided with spikes and hammers to spike the enemy's guns,\r\nand with ropes to drag them off if that proved feasible. After the\r\ncrossing, Captain Washington, of the Third Virginia, was to proceed\r\nwith a guard on the road towards Trenton, and halt and detain any one\r\nwho might be passing in either direction. Three miles from the ferry\r\nthe road branched, making two lines of approach to the town. Greene's\r\ndivision was to take the upper road; Sullivan's the lower one near the\r\nriver. Stirling's and St. Clair's brigades were to act as reserves for\r\ntheir respective columns, and in case of necessity were to form\r\nseparately or join forces, as the emergency required. The officers\r\nset their watches by Washington's. Profound silence was enjoined. Not\r\na man to leave the ranks, read the orders, _under penalty of\r\ndeath_.[224]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Order of march to Trenton.--_Drake's Life of Knox._]\r\n\r\nThe night of the 24th brought storm, snow, and sleet. Ewing and\r\nCadwallader could do nothing on account of the ice in the river. But\r\nWashington was determined on the attempt. He called upon Glover's men\r\nto man the boats; and these amphibious soldiers, who had transported\r\nthe army on the retreat from Long Island, were ready again to strain\r\nevery nerve for the plans of their chief. It was a long, tedious night\r\nas they pushed across the Delaware, through ice and chilling spray,\r\nand it was not until four o'clock in the morning that the force was\r\nready to take up the march on the Jersey side. They could not surprise\r\nthe Hessians before daylight, but a return was not to be thought of.\r\nThe troops then marched on in the worst weather that could be\r\nencountered. \"As violent a storm ensued of Hail & Snow as I ever\r\nfelt,\" wrote Captain William Hull, of Webb's Continentals. The river\r\nwas crossed, says Knox, \"with almost infinite difficulty,\" the\r\nfloating ice making the labor incredible. Fortunately the storm was\r\nagainst our backs, \"and consequently in the faces of our enemy.\" The\r\nmarch was kept up swiftly and quietly. In Sullivan's column some of\r\nthe soldiers could not cover their muskets from the wet, and word was\r\nsent to Washington of the unfitness of their arms. Washington promptly\r\nsent word back by his aid, Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel B. Webb, that if\r\nthe men could not discharge their pieces they must use the bayonet,\r\nfor the town must be taken.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the two columns neared the enemy's\r\noutposts--Sullivan striking them on the lower road but three minutes\r\nafter Greene on the upper one. Greene's van was led by Captain\r\nWashington and Lieutenant James Monroe, the future President;\r\nSullivan's by Stark's New Hampshire men. Surprising the Hessian\r\noutguards, our troops dashed after them \"pell-mell\" into Trenton, gave\r\nthe enemy no time to form, cleared the streets with cannon and\r\nhowitzers \"in the twinkling of an eye,\" under Washington's own\r\ndirection, dislodged them from the houses, drove them beyond into a\r\nplain, surrounded and forced them to surrender, with the loss of their\r\ncommander Rall, who fell mortally wounded. A fine and remarkable\r\nexploit! The turning-point of the campaign--if not, indeed, the\r\ndecisive stroke of the war! Gathering up their nine hundred and fifty\r\nprisoners, six brass field-pieces, standards, horses, and \"a vast\r\nquantity of Plunder,\" the Americans marched back again, having lost\r\nnot a man killed, and hardly more than two or three wounded.\r\n\r\nIn General Orders next day, Washington congratulated his soldiers in\r\nthe warmest terms. He had been in many actions, in all of which he had\r\nseen misbehavior on the part of some; but at Trenton, he told them\r\ntheir conduct was admirable, without exception. Among others he\r\nthanked Knox for his services in terms \"strong and polite.\"\r\n\"Providence seemed to have smiled upon every part of this enterprise.\"\r\n\"What can't men do,\" said Hull, \"when engaged in so noble a cause!\"\r\n\"That victory,\" writes Bancroft, \"turned the shadow of death into the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne more encounter with the enemy, one more success, and the campaign\r\ncloses with final victory assured for America.\r\n\r\nConvinced that inaction would be as demoralizing as defeat, Washington\r\nonce more determined to try his fortunes in New Jersey, and at once\r\nprepared again \"to beat up\" the enemy's quarters. Crossing the\r\nDelaware as before, he marched on the 30th to Trenton, which the\r\nBritish had not reoccupied since Christmas. Hearing of this move,\r\nCornwallis at Princeton gathered a force of seven thousand veterans,\r\nand on the 2d of January started for Trenton. Washington sent out\r\ndetachments, and delayed his entry into the town until evening. At\r\nnightfall he took up position on the east bank of the Assanpink Creek,\r\nwhich ran along the east edge of the town and emptied into the\r\nDelaware. The British pursued our troops to the bridge, but were there\r\nrepulsed by Knox's artillery. Cornwallis rested at Trenton, sent off\r\nfor reinforcements, and expected the next morning to cross the\r\nAssanpink at the bridge or the fords above, and bring Washington to an\r\nengagement. Obviously the Americans were in a hazardous position.\r\nShould the British drive them back, there was no escape, for the\r\nDelaware flowed in their rear. They must save themselves that night. A\r\ncouncil of war was called, and the situation discussed. From Trenton\r\nto Princeton ran a second roundabout road east of the main highway,\r\nalong which Cornwallis had marched, and which it was possible for the\r\nAmericans to take, and put themselves in the rear of Cornwallis, with\r\nlines of retreat open beyond to Morristown and the back country.\r\nWashington proposed escape by this route, and the council seconded\r\nhim. Orders for a secret night march were given to the officers, and\r\nthe regiments were silently withdrawn from their posts along the\r\nAssanpink, and set in motion along this back road towards Princeton.\r\nThe camp-fires on the banks of the creek were kept up by guards left\r\nbehind for the purpose. Nothing occurred to excite suspicion of the\r\nmovement in the minds of the British sentinels, nearly within\r\nmusket-shot on the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nWashington's troops reached a point within two miles of Princeton\r\nabout sunrise. The main column pushed on for the village, while\r\nMercer's brigade, consisting of the remnants of Haslet's Delawares,\r\nSmallwood's Marylanders, and the First Virginia regiment under Captain\r\nFleming, turned to the left to break down a bridge on the main road\r\nover Stony Creek, which the enemy would have to cross on returning\r\nfrom Trenton, in pursuit of Washington.\r\n\r\nThree British regiments had been left at Princeton by Cornwallis, but\r\nwere now, on the morning of the 3d, proceeding under orders to join\r\nhim. These were the Fifty-fifth, the Fortieth, and Seventeenth, the\r\nlatter commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Mawhood. Mawhood was a mile in\r\nadvance of the others, and had just crossed the Stony Creek bridge,\r\nwhen, looking across the country to his left and rear, he discovered\r\nMercer's party on its march. Surprised at the appearance of a force of\r\nrebels where he least expected to see one, Mawhood, nevertheless, with\r\na soldier's instinct, promptly wheeled about and proceeded to attack\r\nMercer. They met on a hill and exchanged fire, when Mawhood ordered a\r\nbayonet charge, and put the Americans to rout. Mercer, on horseback,\r\nattempted in vain to rally his men, and was mortally wounded with\r\nbayonet thrusts. Haslet, gallantly fighting on foot, and also trying\r\nto form the broken brigade, fell dead with a bullet wound in his\r\nforehead. Captain Fleming, of Virginia, suffered a like fate, as well\r\nas Captain Neal of the artillery. This sudden and serious reverse\r\nrequired instant attention, for Washington could not afford to be\r\ndetained long in this position. Cadwallader's brigade, which had\r\nfollowed Mercer's, was accordingly brought up into line, while\r\nWashington attempted to rally the latter's force; but Mawhood was\r\nmaking a surprising fight, and he threw Cadwallader's militiamen into\r\nconfusion as he had Mercer's. Matters now were worse, and the\r\ncommander-in-chief made strenuous exertions, at great personal hazard,\r\nto bring the troops into some order. Meanwhile, he sent word for\r\nHitchcock's brigade to advance upon the enemy, while Hand's riflemen\r\nendeavored to turn their left. The \"gallant Hitchcock\" promptly took\r\nhis command into action--all that remained of it, five regiments\r\ntogether hardly five hundred strong--and formed in line. On the right\r\nwas Lieutenant-Colonel Nixon, next Varnum's battalion, under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Crary, in the centre Colonel Lippett, with the\r\nlargest number, one hundred and twenty-eight men, next Hitchcock's,\r\nunder Major Angell, and on the left Little's battalion, under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Henshaw.[225] They opened fire at one hundred\r\nyards, and then, in conjunction with Cadwallader's men, whom\r\nWashington had rallied in part, they rushed upon Mawhood's force,\r\nrecaptured the two guns we had lost, and joined in putting the enemy\r\ncompletely to rout.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: _Stiles' MS. Diary._ Statement of Rhode Island officers\r\nengaged at Princeton.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt these old troops experienced a glow of satisfaction over this\r\nbrief and final work of the campaign, for they had endured hard\r\nservice from the outset. Here was Greene's old brigade, which crossed\r\nwith him to Long Island on the 1st of May--Varnum's, Hitchcock's,\r\nLittle's, and, by a happy accident, Hand's, on the left--to assist in\r\nreversing the record of the year. These men had built the lines around\r\nBrooklyn; Hitchcock's and Little's at the Flatbush Pass had been\r\ncaught and all but captured in the surprise of August 27th; they\r\nfought manfully, and suffered the most at Harlem Heights; many of them\r\nresponded to Washington's appeal to remain six weeks beyond their term\r\nof service, and now they had shared in the successful manoeuvre at\r\nPrinceton, which changed the whole aspect of affairs.\r\n\r\nHitchcock, who had temporarily succeeded Nixon in command of the\r\nbrigade, received the thanks of Washington for himself and for his men\r\nin front of Princeton College for their aid and conduct in the action.\r\nBut the colonel, a brilliant, promising officer, whose regiment built\r\nand guarded Fort Putnam in Brooklyn, was destined to only a brief\r\ncareer henceforth. Overcome by the fatigue and hardships of the\r\ncampaign, he died in camp at Morristown, on the 13th of January, and\r\nwas buried by the Philadelphia and Delaware Light Infantry companies,\r\nunder Rodney, with all the honors of war. It was a fitting escort to\r\nthe remains of the brave soldier, for Rodney and most of his men had\r\nbehaved well at Princeton.\r\n\r\nSullivan's troops drove the other two British regiments out of\r\nPrinceton towards Brunswick, and Washington's tired army then pushed\r\non, and on the 6th went into camp at Morristown.[226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: In connection with the battles of Trenton and\r\nPrinceton, read the interesting letters from Knox, Haslet, Rodney, and\r\nHull in Part II. They have all appeared since our general accounts\r\nwere written.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect of these two unexpected strokes at Trenton and Princeton\r\nwas to baffle Howe, and utterly disconcert his plans. Expecting to\r\nmarch upon Philadelphia at his leisure, he suddenly finds Washington\r\nturning about and literally cutting his way through the British posts,\r\nback to a point where he threatened Howe's flank and rear. The enemy\r\nwere at once compelled to retire from all their positions below\r\nBrunswick, give up the thought of wintering in Philadelphia, and fall\r\nback to the vicinity of New York. When Horace Walpole heard of these\r\nmovements, he wrote to Sir Horace Mann: \"Washington has shown himself\r\nboth a Fabius and a Camillus. His march through our lines is allowed\r\nto have been a prodigy of generalship. In one word, I look upon a\r\ngreat part of America as lost to this country.\"[227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: In another letter Walpole says:\r\n\r\n\"It is now the fashion to cry up the manoeuvre of General Washington\r\nin this action [Princeton] who has beaten two English regiments, too,\r\nand obliged General Howe to contract his quarters--in short, the\r\ncampaign has by no means been wound up to content.... It has lost a\r\ngreat deal of its florid complexion, and General Washington is allowed\r\nby both sides not to be the worst General in the field.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in a humorous vein:\r\n\r\n\"Caius Manlius Washingtonius Americanus, the dictator, has got\r\ntogether a large army, larger than our ally, the Duke of Wirtemberg\r\nwas to have sold us; and General Howe, who has nothing but salt\r\nprovisions in our metropolis, New York, has not twenty thousand\r\npounds' worth of pickles, as he had at Boston.\"--_Walpole's Letters\r\nand Correspondence. Cunningham._]\r\n\r\nHere the campaign closed. Washington could not be dislodged from his\r\nstrong mountain position, and Howe was satisfied to rest his troops\r\nand postpone further operations until the next season. Meantime the\r\ncountry took heart, Congress voted troops and supplies, and the army\r\nwas recruited and organized on a better basis. \"The business of war is\r\nthe result of Experience,\" wrote Wolcott from Congress, with faith\r\nunshaken during the darkest hours of the campaign; and experience was\r\nnow put to good profit.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was passed. Events proved decisive. Hardship and anxiety\r\nwere yet to come during succeeding years of the war; but it was the\r\nresult of this year's struggle that cleared away misgivings and\r\nconfirmed the popular faith in final success. England could do no more\r\nthan she had done to conquer America; while America was now more ready\r\nthan ever to meet the issue. Independence was established in the\r\npresent campaign--in the year of its declaration; and more than to any\r\nothers we owe this political privilege to the men who fought from Long\r\nIsland to Princeton.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTIONS IN THE HUDSON.--The following letter from Mr. Duer to the\r\nSecret Committee of the New York Provincial Congress refers to the\r\ndefence of the Hudson at Fort Washington:\r\n\r\n\"WHITE PLAINS, Sunday 21st July, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR GENTL:--I have just arrived at this place from New York where I\r\nhave conversed with Genl. Washington on the Purport of the Letter from\r\nthe Secret Committee.\r\n\r\n\"Gens. Putnam and Mifflen have made an exact Survey of the River\r\nopposite Mount Washington and find that the Depth in no Part exceeds\r\nseven Fathoms; the Width, however, of the Channel (which is from three\r\nto seven Fathoms) is not much less than 1800 Yards, the shallow Part\r\nof the River running in an oblique Direction. Genl. Washington\r\nexpresses himself extremely anxious about the Obstruction of that\r\nChannel, and Measures are daily used for executing that Purpose. It is\r\nimpossible to procure Vessels enough at New York, so that the Measure\r\nmust be delayed till such Time as more Vessels can be brought through\r\nthe Sound from Connecticut; however, I am not without Apprehensions\r\nthat this Resource will be cut off, as I understand that some of the\r\nEnemy's Vessels have sailed out of the Hook with an Intention\r\n(probably) of cutting off our Communication with the Sound.\r\n\r\n\"It is, however an Object of so much Importance that no Difficulties,\r\nhowever great, ought to deter us from our Attempts to carry it into\r\nExecution; _if we succeed, the Designs of the Enemy in this Campaign\r\nare effectually baffled_--if we fail, we cannot be in a more\r\nlamentable Situation than we are now.\r\n\r\n\"Exclusive of the great Advantage we should reap in obstructing the\r\nChannel so far to the Southward, it is, I fear, the only Place we can\r\ndepend upon shallowing to the Southward of the Highlands, whilst the\r\nMen-of-War are in the River, for if proper Batteries are erected near\r\nthe Water at Mount Washington, and on the opposite Side, mounted with\r\nGuns of 18, 24 and 32 Pounders, it will not be practicable for any\r\nVessels to be so near as to prevent our working under the Cover of\r\nthese Works. I have strongly urged Genl. Washington to send Gen.\r\nMifflen some heavier Metal, and he seems half inclined. This necessary\r\noperation has not yet taken place.\r\n\r\n\"The Genl. is anxious to have either of you (as Members of the Secret\r\nCommittee) to be with him in Town, and has authorized me to make the\r\nOffer to you of his House during your Residence. Let me entreat One of\r\nyou immediately to come Down, and not to quit Genl. Washington till\r\nsuch Time as this Measure on which our Safety depends is effected....\r\n\r\n\"I am very sincerely, yours, etc.,\r\n  \"WM. DUER.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--For God's sake exert yourself to secure the Sea Vessels which\r\nare in the River.\"[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: From the Clinton papers as published in E.M.\r\nRuttenber's _Obstructions to the Navigation of Hudson's River, etc.\r\nMunsell, Albany_.]\r\n\r\nTo hasten the completion of the obstructions General Putnam proposed\r\nthe following plan of sinking ships, as appears in a letter from him\r\nto General Gates, dated July 26, 1776 (in Sparks'):\r\n\r\n\"We are preparing _Chevaux-de-Frize_, at which we make great Despatch\r\nby the Help of Ships, which are to be Sunk; a Scheme of mine, which\r\nyou may be assured is very simple, a Plan of which I send you. The two\r\nShips' Sterns lie towards each other, about Seventy Feet apart. Three\r\nlarge Logs, which reach from Ship to Ship, are fastened to them. The\r\ntwo Ships and Logs stop the River two hundred and eighty Feet. The\r\nShips are to be sunk, and, when hauled down on one side, the Picks\r\nwill be raised to a proper Height, and they must inevitably stop the\r\nRiver, if the Enemy will let us sink them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, the New York Convention resolved:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secret Committee for obstructing the Navigation of Hudson's\r\nRiver be empowered and directed to purchase or impress for the Service\r\nof the State any Number of Vessels not exceeding six, which they shall\r\nthink best calculated for the Purpose of completing the Obstructions\r\nin the Hudson's River opposite to Mount Washington....\r\n\r\n\"That the said Committee be directed to send all the Oak Plank which\r\nthey may have in their Possession, to Mount Washington with the utmost\r\nDispatch.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR'S ISLAND.--The obstructions in the East River between\r\nGovernor's Island and the Battery consisted of hulks sunk in the\r\nChannel. This was not done until a few days before the battle on Long\r\nIsland. Colonel Douglas, as he states, sounded the river. The present\r\nButtermilk Channel, between the island and Brooklyn, was not\r\nobstructed. Governor's Island was evacuated on the morning of the\r\nretreat from Long Island, but the enemy failed to take possession for\r\ntwo days. The interval was improved by the Americans in carrying off\r\nall except the heavy pieces to New York in the night-time.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LONG ISLAND.--The prisoners named in _Document_ 58 as having\r\nbeen captured by us at the battle of Long Island were a small party of\r\nmarines, who mistook the Delaware regiment in Stirling's force for\r\nHessians. They came too near and were taken by Lieut. Wm. Popham, who\r\nwas ordered to march them into camp. He made them cross Gowanus Creek\r\non Stirling's retreat, and brought all but one in safe. Popham\r\nafterwards became major and aid to General James Clinton, and settled\r\nin New York, where he lived to be over ninety years old. Was a member\r\nof the New York Cincinnati. During the battle the marines landed from\r\nthe fleet, which could not make its way up above Gowanus Bay, and,\r\naccording to one letter, Admiral Howe furnished Grant with ammunition\r\nwhile fighting Stirling. The Roebuck alone, as already stated, could\r\nwork its way along far enough to send some harmless long-range shot at\r\nthe Red Hook fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 1.]\r\n\r\nGENERAL GREENE'S ORDERS\r\n\r\nCAMP ON LONG ISLAND\r\n\r\n[_Colonel Little's Order Book_]\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS.[229]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: These orders are from the Order Book kept by Colonel\r\nMoses Little, of Greene's brigade, while encamped on Long Island\r\nduring the months of May, June, July, and August, 1776, the original\r\nbeing in the possession of Benjamin Hale, Esq., of Newburyport, Mass.\r\nThey cover the whole period of active operations there after the\r\narrival of the main army at New York.

Comg.\r\noff. of each regt. will receive orders on the spot when & where to\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe duties being exceedingly heavy on the men, the Genl. thinks\r\nproper to lessen the fatigue party 1/2 & reduce the guard in forts\r\nGreen & Putnam 1/3, & a Serjt. & 12 men to mount in fort Box,\r\ninstead of the present guard.\r\n\r\nJuly 24, 1776.\r\n\r\nA fatigue party of 40 men & 1 sub. to cut fascines to parade this P.M.\r\n4 days provisions to be provided.

Fatigue for home duty to be\r\nlessened as much as the number detached.\r\n\r\nIN CAMP LONG ISLAND, July 28, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe success of the campaign must depend on the health of the troops;\r\nnothing should be neglected that contributes to it. Good Policy as\r\nwell as humanity claims the attention of every officer to this object;\r\nour honor as well as our success depends on it.\r\n\r\nThe good officer discharges his duty not only in one but in every\r\nrespect. It is a mistaken notion that the minutiæ of military matters\r\nis only an employment for little minds. Such an officer betrays a want\r\nof understanding and showeth a person ignorant of the necessary\r\ndependence and connection of one thing upon another. What signifies\r\nknowledge without power to execute? He who studies the Branches of\r\nmilitary knowledge relating to Dispositions, & neglects to preserve\r\nthe health of his troops will find himself in that disagreeable\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe general is pained to discover inattention to the digging and\r\nfilling vaults for the regts. & to the burial of filth and putrid\r\nmatter. The general directs camp Columen(?) of the several regts.\r\nto dig new vaults, and fill up old ones every 3 days, & that fresh\r\ndirt be thrown in every day to the vaults, & that all filth in and\r\nabout the camp be daily buried. The sickly season coming on, & Putrid\r\nfevers prevailing, the Gen. recommends a free use of vegetables &\r\ndesires the men may keep themselves & clothes clean, & cook their\r\nprovisions properly; & little injury is to be dreaded. A neglect of\r\nthese matters at this critical season may be attended with dreadful\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nComplaints are made of the troops stealing water mellons. Such\r\npractices must be punished. A few unprincipled rascals may ruin the\r\nreputation of a whole corps of virtuous men. The General desires the\r\nvirtuous to complain of every offender that may be detected in\r\ninvading people's property in an unlawful manner, whatever his station\r\nor from whatever part of the country he may come.\r\n\r\nAug. 1, 1776.\r\n\r\nAll the straw bunks & ---- in ye different regts. occupied by\r\nthe well to be collected for the sick of Col.

He is now\r\nconvinced that the troops he has the honor to command, will not, in\r\npoint of bravery, yield to any troops in the universe. The\r\ncheerfulness with which they do their duty, & the patience with which\r\nthey undergo fatigue evince exalted sentiments of freedom, & love of\r\ncountry gives him most satisfactory evidence that when called upon\r\nthey will prove themselves worthy of that freedom for which they are\r\nnow contending.\r\n\r\nCol.

Both officers and soldiers are informed that the retreat from\r\n_Long-Island_ was made by the unanimous advice of all the General\r\nOfficers, not from any doubts of the spirit of the troops, but because\r\nthey found the troops very much fatigued with hard duty, and divided\r\ninto many detachments, while the enemy had their main body on the\r\nIsland, and capable of receiving assistance from the shipping. In\r\nthese circumstances it was thought unsafe to transport the whole of an\r\nArmy on an Island, or to engage them with a part, and therefore\r\nunequal numbers; whereas now our whole Army is collected together,\r\nwithout water intervening, while the enemy can receive little\r\nassistance from their ships. Their Army is, and must be, divided into\r\nmany bodies, and fatigued with keeping up a communication with their\r\nships; whereas ours is connected and can act together. They must\r\neffect a landing under so many disadvantages, that if officers and\r\nsoldiers are vigilant, and alert to prevent surprise, and add spirit\r\nwhen they approach, there is no doubt of our success....\r\n\r\n     [Force, 5th Series, Vol. I., p. 1248.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 4.]\r\n\r\nGEN.

I shall only add,\r\nthat in the former we lost about eight hundred men; more than\r\nthree-fourths of which were taken prisoners. This misfortune happened\r\nin great measure, by two detachments of our people who were posted in\r\ntwo roads leading through a wood, in order to intercept the enemy in\r\ntheir march, suffering a surprise, and making a precipitate retreat,\r\nwhich enabled the enemy to lead a great part of their force against\r\nthe troops commanded by Lord _Stirling_, which formed a third\r\ndetachment, who behaved with great bravery and resolution, charging\r\nthe enemy and maintaining their posts from about seven or eight\r\no'clock in the morning till two in the afternoon, when they were\r\nobliged to attempt a retreat, being surrounded and overpowered by\r\nnumbers on all sides, and in which many of them were taken. One\r\nbattalion (_Smallwood's_ of _Maryland_) lost two hundred and\r\nfifty-nine men, and the general damage fell upon the regiments from\r\n_Pennsylvania_, _Delaware_ and _Maryland_, and Colonel _Huntington's_,\r\nof _Connecticut_.\r\n\r\nAs to the retreat from the Island, it was effected without loss of\r\nmen, and with but very little baggage. A few heavy cannon were left,\r\nnot being moveable on account of the ground's being soft and miry\r\nthrough the rains that had fallen.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's loss in killed we could never ascertain; but have many\r\nreasons to believe that it was pretty considerable, and exceeded ours\r\na good deal. The retreat from thence was absolutely necessary, the\r\nenemy having landed the main body of their army there to attack us in\r\nfront, while their ships of war were to cut off the communication with\r\nthe city, from whence resources of men, provisions, &c., were to be\r\ndrawn....\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, &c.,\r\n  GO.

PARSONS TO JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\nLONG ISLAND 29 Aug 1776.\r\n\r\n... Before this reaches you the account of the battle of Tuesday last\r\nwill arrive--'tis impossible to be particular in a narrative of the\r\nmatter as many are yet missing, who we hope may come in. In the night\r\nof the 26th nine Regiments of the English troops perhaps about 2500\r\nwith Field artillery &c passed the Western road near the Narrows from\r\nthe flat land, for our lines. We had a guard of 400 or 500 men posted\r\nin the wood, who about three o'clock Tuesday morning gave notice of\r\nthe enemy's approach, a body of about 1500. We immediately marched\r\ndown to oppose the progress of the enemy. We took possession of a hill\r\nabout two miles from camp and detached Col Atlee with a Reg't of\r\nDelaware [Penn.] to meet them further on the road; in about 60 rods he\r\ndrew up & received the enemy's fire & gave them a well directed fire\r\nfrom his Reg't, which did great execution & then retreated to the\r\nhill; from thence I was ordered with Col Atlee & part of his Reg't &\r\nLt Col Clark with Col Huntington's Reg't to cover the left flank of\r\nour main body.\r\n\r\nThis we executed though our number did at no time exceed 300 men & we\r\nwere attacked three several times by two Regiments ye 44th &\r\n23d and repulsed them in every attack with considerable loss. The\r\nnumber of dead we had collected together & the heap the enemy had made\r\nwe supposed amounted to about 60. We had 12 or 14 wounded prisoners\r\nwho we caused to be dress'd & their wounds put in the best state our\r\nsituation would admit. About 10 o'clock we found a large body of the\r\nenemy had advanced on the other roads near our lines, but a constant\r\nfire was kept up on the enemy till about 12, when we found them fast\r\nadvancing on our rear to cut off our retreat. Our little main body\r\nadvanced boldly up to the enemy in the rear & broke through their\r\nlines and secured the retreat of most of the party; but it fared still\r\nharder with my little party who had three times repulsed the enemy in\r\nfront and once in the rear; we had no notice of the retreat of the\r\nmain body till it was too late for us to join them, the enemy having\r\ncut off our retreat on three sides & the main body having broke\r\nthrough the enemy's lines on the other side and left them between us.\r\nWe had no alternative left but force through one line into a thick\r\nwood, which we attempted & effected with part of our men, the other\r\npart with Col. Clark being before sent into the wood. When we had made\r\nour way into the wood, I was accidentally parted from Col. Atlee &\r\nmost of the men whom I have never seen since. I came in with 7 men\r\nyesterday morning much fatigued. Our loss is impossible to be\r\nascertained. In my party a Lt. Col. Parry was killed and one wounded.\r\nOur loss in killed & wounded is inconsiderable, but many are missing\r\namong whom are General Sullivan & Lord Sterling. Colonels Miles,\r\nAtlee, Johnson, Lt. Col. Clark Maj. Wells & several other officers of\r\ndistinction are yet missing. I think the trial of that day far from\r\nbeing any discouragement, but in general our soldiers behaved with\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\nI am sir, with esteem & Regard\r\n  Yr. Humble Svt.\r\n    SAM'L H. PARSONS.\r\n\r\nMORRISANIA Oct. 8, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour's of the 2d inst I rec'd last night, for which I am obliged to\r\nyou. If any information I can give will contribute to your\r\nsatisfaction or my country's good I am happy in furnishing what falls\r\nin my observation. I agree fully with you that you were in the dark\r\nas to some facts relative to the transactions on Long Island & am\r\nfully satisfied you still remain so, or you could not suppose the\r\nsurprise there was in the day time. To give you a clear idea of the\r\nmatter, I must trouble you with a description of that part of the\r\ncountry where the enemy landed, and encamped, and the intervening\r\nlands between that and our lines. From the point of land which forms\r\nthe east side of the Narrows, runs a ridge of hills about N.E. in\r\nlength about 5 or 6 miles, covered with a thick wood which terminate\r\nin a small rising land near Jamaica; through these hills are three\r\npasses only, one near the Narrows, one on the road called the Flatbush\r\nRoad & one called the Bedford Road, being a cross road from Bedford to\r\nFlatbush which lies on the southerly side of these hills; these passes\r\nare through the mountains or hills easily defensible being very narrow\r\nand the lands high & mountainous on each side. These are the only\r\nroads which can be passed from the south side the hill to our lines,\r\nexcept a road leading around the easterly end of the hills to Jamaica.\r\nOn each of these roads were placed a guard of 800 men, and east of\r\nthem in the wood was placed Col Miles with his Battalion to watch the\r\nmotion of the enemy on that part, with orders to keep a party\r\nconstantly reconnoitering to and across the Jamaica road. The\r\nsentinels were so placed as to keep a constant communication between\r\nthe three guards on the three roads. South of these hills lies a large\r\nplain extending from the North River easterly to Rockaway Bay perhaps\r\n5 miles & southerly to the sound bounded on the south by the sound and\r\non the north by the hills. Those hills were from two to three miles\r\nand a half from our lines. The enemy landed on this plain & extended\r\ntheir camp from the River to Flatbush perhaps 3 or 4 miles. On the day\r\nof the surprise I was on duty, and at the first dawn of day the guards\r\nfrom the West road near the Narrows, came to my quarters & informed me\r\nthe enemy were advancing in great numbers by that road. I soon found\r\nit true & that the whole guard had fled without firing a gun; these\r\n(by way of retaliation I must tell you) were all New Yorkers &\r\nPennsylvanians; I found by fair daylight the enemy were through the\r\nwood & descending the hill on the North side, on which with 20 of my\r\nfugitive guard being all I could collect, I took post on a height in\r\ntheir front at about half a mile's distance--which halted their column\r\n& gave time for Lord Sterling with his forces to come up; thus much\r\nfor the West road--On the East next Jamaica Col. Miles suffered the\r\nenemy to march not less than 6 miles till they came near two miles in\r\nrear of the guards before he discovered & gave notice of their\r\napproach. This also was in the night & the guard kept by\r\nPennsylvanians altogether--the New England & New Jersey troops being\r\nin the other two roads through which the enemy did not attempt to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised--our principal barrier lost by that surprise, but as\r\nfar as the cover of the night is an excuse we have it.--The landing of\r\nthe troops could not be prevented at the distance of 6 or 7 miles from\r\nour lines; on a plain under the cannon of the ships, just in with the\r\nshore. Our unequal numbers would not admit attacking them on the plain\r\nwhen landed.\r\n\r\nWhen our principal barrier was lost, our numbers so much inferior to\r\nthe enemy, they not disposed to storm our lines, but set down to make\r\nregular approaches to us--were part of the reasons which induced a\r\nretreat from thence and a consequent abandoning New York--. Our\r\nsentinels & guards in my opinion were well posted, they might have\r\nbeen better, too great security I thought prevailed with some leading\r\nofficers, but I still am of opinion, if our guards on the West road &\r\nCol. Miles on East End of the hills had done their duty, the enemy\r\nwould not have passed those important heights, without such very great\r\nloss as would have obliged them to abandon any further enterprise on\r\nthe Island....\r\n\r\nI am sir\r\n  Your Most Humble Sv't\r\n    SAM'L H. PARSONS.\r\n\r\n     [Originals in possession of Hon. Charles Francis Adams.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 6.]\r\n\r\nBRIG. GEN. SCOTT TO JOHN JAY\r\n\r\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK Sept. 6, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI received your letter about half an hour ago by the messengers of the\r\nhonorable convention, in which you inform me that they are anxious to\r\nbe informed of any transactions at this place that may be of use to\r\nthe State, or otherwise of importance. My duty would have directed me\r\nto execute this task before the receipt of your letter, had I been\r\npossessed of the means of conveyance. I shall do it now as far as the\r\nwant of good pen and ink, as scarce as almost every other necessary\r\narticle, will permit.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with our retreat from Long Island. For previous to that\r\nevent the convention was so near the scene of action that they must\r\nhave been acquainted with every occurrence. I was summoned to a\r\nCouncil of War at Mr. Philip Livingston's house on Thursday 29th\r\nult. never having had reason to expect a proposition for a retreat\r\ntill it was mentioned. Upon my arrival at the lines on the Tuesday\r\nmorning before, and just after the enemy, by beating General Sullivan\r\nand Lord Stirling, had gained the heights _which in their nature\r\nappear to have been more defensible than the lines were_, it was\r\nobvious to me we could not maintain them for any long time should the\r\nenemy approach us regularly. _They were unfinished in several places\r\nwhen I arrived there_, and we were obliged hastily to finish them, and\r\nyou may imagine with very little perfection, particularly across the\r\nmain road, the most likely for the approach of the enemy's heavy\r\nartillery. _In this place three of my battalions_ were placed, the\r\ntraverse of the line in ground so low, that the rising ground\r\nimmediately without it, would have put it in the power of a man at 40\r\nyards' distance to _fire under my horse's belly_ whenever he pleased.\r\nYou may judge of our situation, subject to almost incessant rains,\r\nwithout baggage or tents and almost without victuals or drink, and in\r\nsome part of the lines the men were standing up to their middles in\r\nwater. The enemy were evidently incircling us from water to water with\r\nintent to hem us in upon a small neck of land. In this situation they\r\nhad as perfect a command of the island, except the small neck on which\r\nwe were posted, as they now have. Thus things stood when the retreat\r\nwas proposed. As it was suddenly proposed, _I as suddenly objected to\r\nit_, from an aversion to giving the enemy a single inch of ground; but\r\n_was soon convinced by the unanswerable reasons for it_. They were\r\nthese. Invested by an enemy of above double our number from water to\r\nwater, scant in almost every necessary of life and without covering\r\nand liable every moment to have the communication between us and the\r\ncity cut off by the entrance of the frigates into the East River\r\nbetween (late) Governor's Island and Long Island; which General\r\nMcDougall assured us from his own nautic experience was very feasible.\r\nIn such a situation we should have been reduced to the alternative of\r\ndesperately attempting to cut our way [through] a vastly superior\r\nenemy with the certain loss of a valuable stock of artillery and\r\nartillery stores, which the continent has been collecting with great\r\npains; or by famine and fatigue have been made an easy prey to the\r\nenemy. In either case the campaign would have ended in the total ruin\r\nof our army. The resolution therefore to retreat was unanimous, and\r\ntho' formed late in the day was executed the following night with\r\nunexpected success. We however lost some of our heavy cannon on the\r\nforts at a distance from the water, the softness of the ground\r\noccasioned by the rains having rendered it impossible to remove them\r\nin so short a time. Almost everything else valuable was saved; and not\r\na dozen men lost in the retreat. The consequence of our retreat was\r\nthe loss of [late] Govrs Island which is perfectly commanded by the\r\nfort on Red Hook. The enemy however from fear or other reasons\r\nindulged with the opportunity of two nights to carry off all except\r\nsome heavy cannon. The garrison was drawn off in the afternoon after\r\nour retreat under the fire of the shipping who are now drawn up just\r\nbehind [late] Govrs Island, and the fire of some cannon from Long\r\nIsland shore; but with no other loss than that of one man's arm. What\r\nour loss on Long Island was I am not able to estimate. I think the\r\nhills might have been well maintained with 5000 men. _I fear their\r\nnatural strength was our bane by lulling us into a state of security_\r\nand enabling the enemy to steal _a march upon us_. I think from the\r\nbest accounts we must have killed many of the enemy. We are sure that\r\nlate Colonel and afterwards General Grant who was so bitter against us\r\nin Parliament, is among the slain. General Parsons late Col. and\r\npromoted to the rank of a general officer escaped from the action and\r\npursuit as by a miracle. I believe him to be a brave man. He is a\r\nConnecticut lawyer. He told me that in the action he commanded a party\r\nof about 250 men, with orders from Lord Stirling to cover his flank;\r\nand that when the enemy gave way, he threw into a heap about thirty of\r\nthe enemy's dead, and that in advancing a little further he found a\r\nheap made by the enemy at least as large as that which he had\r\ncollected. Lord Stirling had ordered him to maintain his ground till\r\nreceipt of his orders to retreat. However, finding that no such\r\norders came; and finding the enemy by rallying to increase on his\r\nhands, he flew to the place where Lord Stirling was posted, leaving\r\nhis party on the ground with strict orders to maintain it till his\r\nreturn, but he found his Lordship and his whole body of troops gone.\r\nThere can be no doubt but Lord Stirling behaved bravely; but I wish\r\nthat he had retreated sooner. He would have saved himself and a great\r\nnumber of troops from captivity, but he refused to retreat for want of\r\norders. We miss him much, he was a very active officer. General\r\nSullivan who was also made a prisoner in the action on the heights\r\nwent some days ago on parole to Congress to endeavor to procure his\r\nexchange for Prescot. I have not heard of his return. Two or three\r\ndays ago the Rose frigate went up between the islands and took\r\nshelter, after a severe cannonade from us, behind Blackwell's Island.\r\nShe retreated yesterday as far as Corlear's Hook, where she was\r\nbriskly cannonaded till night. I have not heard of her this morning.\r\nBy the loss on Long Island and the running away of our militia,\r\n_especially those of Connecticut_, to their respective homes, our army\r\nis much diminished, and I am sure is vastly inferior to that of the\r\nenemy....\r\n\r\nPoor General Woodhull with a lieutenant and four men were made\r\nprisoners on Long Island. I had a letter from him dated the first\r\ninst. but not dated from any place, nor does he tell me how he was\r\ntaken. He has lost all his baggage and requested of me two shirts and\r\ntwo pairs of stockings, which I should have sent him had not the flag\r\nof truce been gone before I recd the letter. I shall comply with\r\nhis request by the first opportunity. Commend me with all possible\r\ndevotion to the honorable Convention.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n  Your most obedient servant\r\n    JNO. MORIN SCOTT.\r\n\r\nP.S. _The army badly paid & wretchedly fed._ 1100 men arrived from the\r\nsouthward. A deserter tells me be (?) 3000 foreign troops on Staten\r\nisland. I know not what the flying camp is doing. He says the enemy on\r\nLong Island are 26,000. I believe this much exaggerated; and 1000 in\r\nthe shipping.\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Hon.

JOSEPH TRUMBULL TO HIS BROTHER\r\n\r\nLEBANON, CONN.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK 27th August 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER\r\n\r\nSince my last the enemy have landed their main force on Long Island\r\nnear New Utrecht Church--between that & Flat Bush, our people and\r\ntheirs have frequent skirmishes in all which our people have had the\r\nbetter of them. We have lost several men, killed and wounded--. Col.\r\nMartin of New Jersey badly wounded in the breast, but I hope not\r\nmortally. We just have received an account of a smart skirmish this\r\nmorning at break of day--the particulars I don't yet know, if I can\r\nget them before the gentlemen go who bring this I will write you them.\r\nCol. Huntington is unwell, but I hope getting a little better. He has\r\na slow fever. Maj. Dyer is also unwell with a slow fever. Gen'l Greene\r\nhas been very sick but is better. Genls. Putnam, Sullivan, Lord\r\nSterling, Nixon, Parsons & Heard are on Long Island and a strong part\r\nof our army. We have a fine ridge of hills and woods to meet them in\r\non Long Island before they come near our lines.\r\n\r\nI am dear Brother your Affectionate\r\n  JOS. TRUMBULL.\r\n\r\nJONA TRUMBULL JUNR Esq.\r\n\r\nP.S. It was true the enemy attacked in the morning--Several parties of\r\nthem penetrated thro' the woods & the whole body are now thro' &\r\nwithin 2 miles of our lines. Some parties of them have been up to the\r\nlines but are drove back, or upon the Heights about 2 miles off from\r\nthe lines. There has been some very brisk firing & smart engagements;\r\nwhat numbers are killed or wounded on either side--the firing ceases\r\nat present but expect it renewed again by & by. We have lost a Mr.\r\nRutgers of this town, an artillery man & Lt. Col. Parry of\r\nPennsylvania. These are all we know yet.\r\n\r\nYour's as before.\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Henry E.

We have been obliged to retreat from Long Island and Governor's\r\nIsland, from both of which we got off without loss of men. We have\r\nleft a great part of our heavy artillery behind. The field train is\r\noff. We are in hourly expectation that the town will be bombarded and\r\ncannonaded--and the enemy are drawing their men to the eastward on\r\nLong Island, as if they intended to throw a strong party over on this\r\nisland, near Hell Gate, so as to get on the back of the city. We are\r\npreparing to meet them. Matters appear to be drawing near to a\r\ndecisive engagement. Gen. Sullivan is allowed to come on shore, upon\r\nhis parole, and go to Congress, on the subject of exchange of himself,\r\nLord Sterling, and a large number who are prisoners; by the best\r\naccounts we yet have, we have lost, in last week's defeat, about 800\r\nmen killed and missing; how many of each, is not yet known. I rather\r\nexpect that they will push in a body of troops between the town and\r\nour posts at and near King's bridge. If they do we shall have them\r\nbetween two fires, and must push them to the last extremity or be\r\nkilled or taken prisoners. The event is in the hand of the Almighty,\r\nDisposer of all events....\r\n\r\nI am, honored Sir,\r\n  Your dutiful son,\r\n    JOS. TRUMBULL.\r\n\r\n     [Collections of the R.I. Hist.

No arrivals since\r\nmy last. Some hints this morning that the Torys had laid a plan to\r\ndestroy the general officers of our army. The particulars I have not\r\nyet. The Regt generally well.\r\n\r\nJuly 6--1776.\r\n\r\nAbout 160 ships and transports and other vessels are arrived with\r\nabout 10000 soldiers--Numbers are landed on Staten Island. We expect\r\n12000 more to join them. Camp very healthy. I have lost only one man\r\nsince we left Prospect Hill (near Boston). Our men in good spirits. I\r\nam of opinion our hands will be full--hope we shall do well.\r\n\r\nJuly 31, 1776.\r\n\r\nTen ships are added to the King's troops--part very large, can't say\r\nwhether they are men of war or transports. This island is a place of\r\ngreat importance, & if possible must be defended. We are five _small_\r\nregts, are scattered, & have 10 forts to defend. Col. Hand's\r\nRegt is scattered over 5 miles in length. I am posted in fort Green\r\nwhich is the largest. I never desire to give it up, nor be taken while\r\nI am alive. I am of opinion my regt. will stand fast in the cause\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nAugust 9, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were seen to embark 30 boats full of men on 3 vessels & 100\r\nboats full on the other transports. We expected an attack, but all is\r\nstill & quiet.\r\n\r\nOur enemies have been reinforced by the Hessians & Clinton's fleet.\r\nDeserters say the enemy are 30,000 strong & Genl. Greene judges\r\nthem 20,000. I think them 16,000. We have only 1600 fit for duty on\r\nLong Island. I shall pay the Q.M. Genl. the balance due him for\r\ncloathing my regt. this day, which will square all accounts.\r\n\r\nAug. 22 1776.\r\n\r\nI have thought fit to send you my will--you will take all charge\r\nnecessary &c.\r\n\r\nThe enemy this day landed on this Island & marched within 3 miles of\r\nour camp. Three or four regiments lodge within 2 miles of the enemy. I\r\nexpect morning will bring us to battle.\r\n\r\nIN CAMP NEW YORK Sep. 1, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe enemy left Staten Island & landed on Long Island the 22d.\r\nEncamped on a large plain 5 or 6 miles across, at Flat Bush 4 miles\r\ndistant. Our troops encamped in the edge of the woods in front of\r\nthem. Our line extended about four miles on the night of the 27th.\r\nIn the morning, at 2 o'clock, the enemy attacked our right wing (a\r\nsmart engagement for some time).\r\n\r\nThe enemy also advanced on the left. Lord Stirling reinforced the\r\nright wing & defended himself till 12 o'clock when our wing gave way.\r\nMy regt. was in the center on guard. The enemy's right wing almost\r\nencircled 2 or 3 regt's & as they were not together they were not able\r\nto defend themselves & retreated with about 20 wounded. Our people\r\ncame in about 11 o'clock. The enemy at the same time with their light\r\nhorse & English troops attempted to force our lines, but soon\r\nretreated being met with a smart fire from our breast works.\r\n\r\nTwo deserters informed us that the enemies dead & wounded was upwards\r\nof 500--I wish ours may not be more. On the morning of the 28th the\r\nenemy were encamped on the heights in front of our encampment. Firing\r\nwas kept up on both sides, from the right to the left. Weather very\r\nrainy. 29th very rainy. Firing by both sides in front of Fort\r\nPutnam. About sunset the enemy pushed to recover the ground we had\r\ntaken (about 100 rods) in front of the fort. The fire was very hot,\r\nthe enemy gave way, & our people recovered the ground. The fire\r\nceased, & our people retired to the fort. The enemy took possession\r\nagain, & on the morning of the 30th had a breastwork there 60 rods\r\nlong, & 150 rods distant from fort Putnam.\r\n\r\nTwo ships of war had got up the sound as far as Hell gate by this\r\ntime. The general ordered each regt. to be paraded on their own\r\nparades at 7 O'clock P.M. & wait for orders. We received orders to\r\nstrike our tents & march, with our baggage, to New York. Our lines\r\nwere manned until day break.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the retreat was, that we should have had no chance to\r\nretreat if the ships came up. I am not certain we shall be able to\r\nkeep the city of New York. You may hear of our being at King's Bridge.\r\nA great battle I think will be fought here, or near there.\r\n\r\nI am in a good measure of health.\r\n\r\nI am your affectionate father,\r\n  MOSES LITTLE.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. JOSIAH LITTLE.\r\n\r\nIN CAMP FORT CONSTITUTION, Oct. 1, 1776.\r\n\r\nI have been solicited by Genl.

I\r\nbefore declined, but he will not hear one word about my refusing to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Benjamin Hale, Esq.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 10.]\r\n\r\nLIEUT. COL.

Last evening a Conspiracy of the Tories was discovered; their plan\r\nwas to murder Genl. Washington, seize on the Persons of the other\r\nGeneral officers, & blow up our Magazines, at the Instant of Time the\r\nKing's Troops should Land. A number of our Officers rode last Night to\r\nFlat bush on this Island, & seiz'd the Mayor of the City, who is now\r\nin safe Custody & suppos'd to be in the Conspiracy--several others\r\nare also taken & the Names of others we have, which I hope we shall\r\nsoon be able to give a good account of.\r\n\r\nIn haste, I conclude\r\n  Yours affectionately,\r\n    WM. HENSHAW.\r\n\r\nAugt. 29th 1776.\r\n\r\nI have but just time to inform you I am well, as I hope this will find\r\nyou, our Family & Friends. You will undoubtedly hear, before you see\r\nthis, that we have had an engagement with the Enemy--were surrounded,\r\n& had a Number Killed & Taken. I was with the Party who were\r\nSurrounded & through a kind Providence, got through their fire without\r\nbeing Wounded or Taken.--The Particulars of which I have not time to\r\nrelate as the Enemy are close to us & we expect to be attacked every\r\nhour. I have wrote to Brother Josy by this conveyance which letter he\r\nwill let you see.--May God Bless & preserve you from every disaster,\r\nis the unremitting wish of yours &c.\r\n\r\nN. YORK Sept. 1st 1776.\r\n\r\nLast Friday we left Long Island, (being unable to keep it any longer,\r\nwithout being made Prisoners) and came to New York. How long we shall\r\nstay here is uncertain--Our Public Enemies are numerous--Our private\r\nOnes not a few. Happy shall I esteem myself, if I live to see these\r\nPublick Calamities at an End, when we can live peaceably at home &\r\nEnjoy the Fruit of our Labors, the Sweets of Liberty, & none to molest\r\nus: 7 Regiments marched to King's Bridge Yesterday Afternoon. Lord\r\nSterling & Gen. Sullivan are made prisoners by the Enemy. Sullivan was\r\nwith us yesterday and is now gone to Philadelphia to Congress.

In our Brigade was\r\nKill'd & Wounded, 75--in the whole Kill'd & Wounded on our side, about\r\n100--of the Enemy by the best Information we have about 500--since\r\nwhich we have had several Skirmishes. I was not in them, though I saw\r\nseveral of them. One of them last Week was fought by Reed's &\r\nLearned's Regts., where we had six--kill'd & a number Wounded; the\r\nEnemy had Kill'd & Wounded, about 200--the same Week, a Scouting Party\r\ncame across the famous Rogers Scouts, with a scouting party of the\r\nEnemy, took 30 of them Prisoners, & kill'd a number of them--This Week\r\nwe had some Battles with them. Monday the 28th Inst. about 2000\r\nof them came on a height of Land on these Plains, Attacked our\r\nPicquet, & after some time, forced our People to give Back. The Loss\r\non either side I cannot ascertain, but suppose we had Kill'd & Wounded\r\nnear 100, as the Fire of Cannon & Small Arms was heavy for some time.\r\nThe Day before, they Attacked our Lines near Fort Washington with two\r\nof their Brigades & some of their Ships--Their Ships were much\r\ndamaged; one of them they were obliged to Tow off; Our People at the\r\nLines reserv'd their Fire till the Brigades advanced pretty near, then\r\ngave them a heavy Fire which caused them to Retreat; they form'd &\r\nadvanc'd the second time, when our People gave them the second Fire;\r\nthey Retreated as before, & form'd the Third time, came up & Fired at\r\nthe Lines, which was so warmly returned, that they Retreated. Our\r\nPeople then Jump'd over the Lines, and pursued them, & Kill'd many,\r\nbut the Number is not ascertained.--should I have another Opportunity\r\nto write, can better inform you: we had but one Kill'd in this Battle.\r\nWe took 14 Hessians one Day this Week, & one English Officer; have had\r\nseveral Deserters come in this Week. The Enemy are now Encamp'd within\r\nGun shot of us, so that there is a continual firing of Small Arms--We\r\nlet two Hessians, which we took some time ago, return to the Enemy's\r\nCamp--We daily expect an engagement with the Enemy----\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Harlem Heights, Sept. 16.]\r\n\r\nBrother Denny was here Yesterday to see me; is well & station'd at\r\nTerry Town on the North River about 8 miles from this.

HENSHAW\r\n\r\n[Without date.]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Campaign in 1776, there were 3 Regts commanded by\r\nLt. Colonels. General Washington offered me the command of either of\r\nthem. I conversed with the Officers of these Regiments, & I found they\r\nwere averse to a change; I informed Gen'l W. that if I accepted his\r\noffer, it would be injurious to the Service and declined it. He then\r\nsaid he hoped I would not leave the Service, but would take a Lt.\r\nColonel's commission, which I did under Colonel Little, & in April we\r\nmarched for New York in the Brigade commanded by Genl Green. Soon\r\nafter Genl Washington came & ordered said Brigade to Long Island.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of August, I commanded in a picket guard at Flatbush,\r\nwhere the enemy was encamped, who marched by the East wing of the\r\nPickets, and formed a line between us and our encampments, and knowing\r\nthe Gen. could not send us orders to retreat we marched to reach our\r\nencampments. While marching in the rear of the enemy's line, they were\r\nholding a Council of War, whether to storm our lines, or take them by\r\na regular siege. They chose the latter. Had they broke their lines and\r\nmarched into our front, we must have been made prisoners; but they\r\nonly turned on their heels and fired at us and we got in with little\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Miss H.E.

JASPER EWING TO JUDGE YEATES\r\n\r\nNEW YORK Aug. 30, 1776.\r\n\r\nHONOURED SIR:\r\n\r\nAfter a very fatiguing march we are all safely arrived. The Genl.\r\nyesterday gave orders for all the Regts on Long Island to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to march at the shortest notice, and evacuate\r\nour Lines for the enemy already had extended their advanced posts\r\nacross the Island, & we were entirely surrounded, so that the only\r\nrefuge he had left was New York--This morn'g a party about fifty men\r\nwent a marauding and were surprised by the enemy, who after firing\r\nwhole vollies secured one of the Boats, & then the Hessian Riflemen\r\nbegan to play upon them, so that our loss including that of the first\r\nengagement amounts to 500 men & upwards.\r\n\r\nLord Stirling & Genl. Sullivan are Prisoners, several officers are\r\nstill missing amongst whom are Col. Miles and Atlee--The militia from\r\nBerks County are almost cut off. The inhuman wretches thrust their\r\nbayonets through our wounded men and refused that mercy to us, which\r\nwe granted to them. The situation of New York is very critical, the\r\nenemy being in possession of Long Island may reduce it to a Heap of\r\nashes in a days time.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the enemy amounts to 1500 men amongst whom are a Brigadier\r\nGenl. and several Field Officers.--The Idea which we at first\r\nconceived of the Hessian Riflemen was truly ridiculous but sad\r\nexperience convinces our people that they are an Enemy not to [be]\r\ndespised, Several Companies of their Light Infantry are cloathed\r\nexactly as we are, in hunting shirts and trowers--Mr. Burd who\r\ncommanded a detachment of 200 men is not yet returned, and sorry am I\r\nto say it, he is a Prisoner amongst them.--as this news must certainly\r\nafflict Aunt and the whole family, I have forwarned my Brother from\r\nmaking any mention of it.\r\n\r\nPlease to give my duty to Aunt, mammy, Kitty and my love to all the\r\nchildren,\r\n\r\nI remain, Honrd Sir\r\n  Yr dutiful & obliged Nephew\r\n    J.

Col. Hand's Regmt. had been on duty 2 days & the second Night\r\nwere relieved between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning and about Two\r\nit is thought the Enemy began their movements from Flat Bush to the\r\nRight, and Left, and at between 7 & 8 o'clock in the morning we had\r\nthe mortification from our Lines to see our men commanded by Lord\r\nStirling almost surrounded by the Regulars, as they kept their stand\r\non a Hill without flinching an inch, The Regulars were firing at them\r\nlike Fury they at last descended then there was a continual peal of\r\nSmall Arms for an Hour or better, our men at last partly got off by\r\nthe Marsh, as in the Draught inclosed, I have been very Ill of a Fever\r\nwhich I got by being cloathed too thin and lay at York about 2 Days\r\nbefore our People had made that Grand Retreat from the Island which\r\nwill ever reflect honour to our Generals, from York I was removed to\r\nKing's Bridge twelve or fifteen miles from thence, after I had\r\nrecovered, my Health suffered from Travelling. The Colo. was good\r\nenough to send me Home in a Carriage which thank God I happily--and\r\ndont doubt of recovering Health shortly--I am Sir\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n  Nephew\r\n    JNO.

Time\r\nwill not permitt my saying so much as I would wish--I left the\r\nColo. & all friends very well at King's Bridge where the Regt.\r\nis Stationed as I only left them this day week.\r\n\r\n     [Original among the Yeates papers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reduction from Original Map.

On Thursday the\r\nenemy landed on Long Island at 3 o'clock P.M. We had intelligence\r\nthat our Troops on the Island wanted to be reinforced. My Regiment and\r\n3 more were ordered over for that purpose. My regt. was ordered down\r\ninto a woody Hill near Red Hook to take Post that night to prevent any\r\nmore troops from landing thereabout. We had the Heavens for our\r\nCovering and the Earth for my bed, wrapt in my blanket, when after\r\nposting my Sentries I slept finely. Was mighty well yesterday, and was\r\nthen ordered here where I & my Regt. now are. The enemy are about 3\r\nmiles East of our troops, were a part of them skirmishing with them\r\nall day yesterday and are still on the same ground & have killed a\r\nnumber of the enemy. The enemy are said to be 8 or 9000 that are\r\nlanded here. I am posted here at a fort & to see some breastworks\r\ncompleated. By the blessing of Heaven I trust we shall be able to give\r\na good acct of the enemy.... My love to our Dear Sons & accept the\r\nsame yourself from most affec. & loveing Husband\r\n\r\nP.S. I refer you to Capt. Hawley for Particulars.\r\n\r\nFLATT BUSH ON LONG ISLAND Aug. 25, 1776\r\n  2 o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nI wrote you yesterday morning from Brookline upon the Drum Head in the\r\nfield as I do now, which I hope you will receive this day.... Have not\r\nso much as a bear skin to lie on, only my blanket to wrap me in, for\r\nour removals from place to place are so quick & sudden that we can\r\nhave no opportunity nor means to convey beds &c, but go only with the\r\ncloaths on our backs & our blankets and a little ready-cooked\r\nvictuals. I am now posted within about half a mile from the Regulars\r\nwith my Regt. under the Covert of a woody hill to stop their passage\r\ninto the Country. There are a number of Regts posted all around the\r\ntown within about the same distance & for the same purpose. The\r\nregulars keep up an almost Constant Fire from their cannon & mortars\r\nat some or other of us, but neither shott nor shell has come near my\r\nRegt. yet and they are at too great a distance to fire muskets at as\r\nyet. I have a scouting party going out now to see if they can't pick\r\nup some or get something from them. I came to this post this day at 12\r\no'clock & shall remain here till this time to-morrow if God spares my\r\nlife, with no other covering than the trees. I cant learn anything\r\nwith respect to them different from what I wrote yesterday. The rest\r\nof the troops & their Ships lie at Staten Island yet to wait the\r\nsuccess of this part of their army, as I suppose before they make any\r\nother attempt. They have wounded in all of our men in 3 days skirmish\r\nabout 8 or 9 men, one or two mortally, which is not half the number\r\nthat we have killed for them beside wounded....\r\n\r\nNEW YORK (BROOKLYN) Aug 29 1776.\r\n\r\n... Have been a stranger to a bed ever since last Wens'day night till\r\nlast night being relieved from manning a part of the lines with my\r\nregt. where I had been 36 hours I was invited by our mutual friend\r\nMajor Mott to take part of his bed & have had a fine night indeed, the\r\nNight before there was a waggon near our Lines into which I got &\r\nwrapt myself in my Blanket after Twelve & half after One was waked &\r\nacquainted that the Enemy were coming up to force our Lines & we\r\nimmediately took our Places in the Trenches & there remained untill\r\nafter Sun Rise, but it proved a false Alarm, our Enemy have encamped\r\nin plain sight of our camp at the distance of about a mile & half, We\r\nhave had no General Engagement yet, but no Day passes without some\r\nsmart & Hot skirmishes between different Parties in which the success\r\nis sometimes One Way & sometimes another, We are in constant\r\nExpectation of a General Battle; no one can be here long without\r\ngeting pretty well acquainted with the whistleing of Cannon & musket\r\nshott.\r\n\r\nHARLEM HEIGHTS Sep. 17th 1776.\r\n\r\n... On the morning of last Sabbath we had news that the regulars on\r\nLong Island were in motion as they would cross the East River & land\r\nabout 3 miles above the city. At this place lay their ships close in\r\nwith our shores & soon after the regulars marched in a large body down\r\nto the shore & embarked on Board the flat bottomed boats. Upon this\r\ntheir ships began a most incessant fire on our lines opposite to them\r\nwith their grape shot from which they were distant but about 50 rods &\r\nbehind which lay Genl. Wadsworth's & Col. Douglass' Brigades until\r\nthe fire was so hot from the ships that they were obliged to retreat.\r\nOn this the regulars landed & fired upon them which completed their\r\nconfusion & they ran away up here & are here now, but a part of them\r\nwere out in yesterday's action & behaved nobly.\r\n\r\nNow as to myself & my brigade we were left to guard the city until all\r\nthe rest of the troops were drawn off & about half an hour or an hour\r\nafter all the other troops were gone I was ordered with my brigade to\r\nmarch out of the city & man the lines on the East river opposite to\r\nBayard's Hill fort. Then I marched & saw the regular Army land above\r\nme & spread across the Island from one river to another until my\r\nretreat seemed to be entirely cut off & soon after received an order\r\nto retreat if I could.\r\n\r\nI attempted it along up through the woods by the North River when I\r\ncame in sight of the enemy several times but kept my brigade covered\r\nin the woods so that I got thro' them to their uppermost guard & they\r\npursued & fired on my rear & took a few of my men. I immediately\r\nformed about 300 of my men on an Hill to oppose them. On seeing this\r\nthe regulars fled & I pursued my retreat & got my brigade safe here\r\nwhere I am now posted--a particular detail of the risks I ran must be\r\ndeferred. It was supposed by everybody that I & my brigade were\r\nentirely cut off.\r\n\r\nHARLEM HEIGHTS, 17 Sept. 1777. 2 o'cl P.M.\r\n\r\nYesterday at 7 o'clock in the morning we were alarmed with the sight\r\nof a considerable number of the enemy on the Plains below us about a\r\nmile distant.--Our Brigades which form a line across the Island where\r\nI am were immediately ordered under arms--but as the enemy did not\r\nimmediately advance we grounded our arms & took spades & shovels &\r\nwent to work & before night had thrown up lines across the\r\nIsland--There was nothing before but three little redoubts in about a\r\nmile & we are at work this day in strengthening them. But yesterday a\r\nlittle before noon we heard a strong firing about half a mile below us\r\nin the woods near where we had two Brigades lying as an advanced\r\nguard. The enemy in a large body advanced in the woods a little before\r\n12 o'cl & began a heavy fire on those two Brigades who maintained the\r\nfire obstinately for some time & then they were reinforced by several\r\nregiments & the fire continued very heavy from the musketry & from\r\nfield pieces about two hours--in which time our people drove the\r\nregulars back from post to post about a mile & a half & then left them\r\npretty well satisfied with their dinner since which they have been\r\nvery quiet. Our loss on this occasion by the best information is\r\nabout 25 killed & 40 or 50 wounded. The enemy by the best accounts\r\nhave suffered much more than we.\r\n\r\nA prisoner we have I am told says that Genl. Howe himself commanded\r\nthe regular & Genl. Washington & Genl. Putnam were both with our\r\nTroops. They have found now that when we meet them on equal ground we\r\nare not a set of people that will run from them--but that they have\r\nnow had a pretty good drubbing, tho' this was an action between but a\r\nsmall party of the army.\r\n\r\nCAMP AT WHITE PLAINS Oct. 29th 1776.\r\n\r\n... Yesterday about 10 o'clock in the morning we had news that the\r\nenemy were approaching, when I with my regiment & 3 others were\r\nordered out about 1-1/2 miles below our lines to take post on a hill\r\nto gall them in their march as they advanced. We accordingly took our\r\npost & mine & one other regiment had the advantage of a stone wall\r\nright in front at which we had been waiting but little time before the\r\nenemy came up within 6 or 8 rods,--when our men rose from behind the\r\nwall, poured in a most furious fire.\r\n\r\nThe enemy retreated & came on several times & were so hotly received\r\nevery time that finally we drove them off from the hill. We killed\r\nsome they did not carry off & some they did.\r\n\r\nI had not one either killed or wounded. On this the enemy were coming\r\nupon us with a number of field pieces & as we had none there to meet\r\nthem with, we were ordered to retreat over West on to another Hill &\r\njoin another party of men & accordingly did it & formed a line of\r\nbattle. We were I believe near 2000 on the Hill (Chatterton's). The\r\nenemy soon brought their main body opposite to us & formed them into\r\nthree lines, one back of the other, & a large number of field pieces\r\nin their front & howitzers with which they threw small bombs on\r\nanother Hill. Then they marched their first line off from the Hill\r\nwhere they stood, down into a deep Valley that lay between us & then\r\nthey played on us most furiously with their artillery to keep us from\r\nmeeting their people in the hollow & in short the shot & shells came\r\nlike hail. I lay right in the heaviest of their fire, with my men by a\r\nfence & had two wounded there & were soon ordered to another post\r\nfurther on the line of battle up to which the enemy soon came as they\r\ndid for a long way in lengths. We gave them a heavy fire which made\r\nthem retreat but they soon returned when a most furious fire followed\r\nwhich continued for a few minutes when their numbers were increased so\r\namazingly that we were obliged to retreat which we did thro' a most\r\nfurious fire from the enemy for half a mile for so far there was\r\nnothing to cover us from it.... I have lost but 4 out of my reg't &\r\ncan hear of only 10 or 12 wounded. We are all now within our line &\r\nthe enemy are posted on a number of the neighboring hills & we\r\nexpected they would have come on this morning when we should have had\r\nan engagement with both armies but they don't yet move & it is now\r\nabout 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\n     [Originals in possession of Mrs. O.P.

I was\r\nrelieved on Monday about half (past) Two & marched Back within the\r\nLines to the Place where my Regiment was ordered for their Alarm Post\r\nin order to man the Lines there in case the Enemy advanced which was\r\nat the Northern Part of the Lines, and there was beside the Regiments\r\nthat were ordered to man the Lines some Regiments as a Corps de\r\nReserve to reinforce any Part of the Lines that might be attacked &c.\r\nEarly on Tuesday Morning the Guards at all those Three Avenues were\r\nattacked (by) parties that vastly out numbered them, and soon were\r\ndrove from their Posts and soon broken at the Same Time....

Hubbard, New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 19.]\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND\r\n\r\nThe evening preceding the action, General Washington, with a number of\r\ngeneral officers, went down to view the motions of the enemy, who were\r\nencamped at Flatbush. The enemy appeared to be striking their tents,\r\nand preparing for a march; whereupon it was ordered that 2400 men\r\nshould be posted as guards, in the following manner, viz: 800 on the\r\nroad that leads out of the Jamaica road by way of Yellow Hook to\r\nFlatbush; these men were posted in a woods, at four miles distant from\r\nour lines, to oppose the enemy if they attempted that road, and to\r\nannoy them on their march: 800 more were posted in a woods upon the\r\nMiddle road, which leads out of the Jamaica road to Flatbush, about a\r\nmile and a half from the lines; these were posted at about half a mile\r\ndistant from Flatbush, and near a mile from the parting of the road,\r\nwhere an _abatis_ was formed across the road, and a breastwork thrown\r\nup and defended by two pieces of cannon: 800 more were posted at the\r\nBedford road, which leads out of the Jamaica road, at about three\r\nmiles distant from our lines; this party was ordered to guard the\r\nBedford road, and to patrol the road leading through the New Lots in\r\nthe east of the Bedford road, from which it parts at the Halfway\r\nHouse, about six miles from the lines, and leads from it to Flatbush.\r\nFive officers were also sent out on horseback to patrol the\r\nlast-mentioned road and that leading to Jamaica. At 10 o'clock at\r\nnight about 5000 of the enemy marched by way of the New Lots, and\r\narrived, near 2 in the morning, at Halfway House, without being\r\ndiscovered; they took post in a field, and waited for daylight. The\r\nfive officers sent to patrol fell into their hands, and were all made\r\nprisoners. About 3 in the morning a party of the enemy advanced into\r\nthe Western road, leading by Yellow Hook, and attacked our guards; the\r\nguards returned their fire, threw them into confusion, caused the\r\nwhole to halt, and took one prisoner, who informed us that he belonged\r\nto the regiment which attacked our guards, and was by their fire\r\nthrown into confusion and forced to retreat, and that there were two\r\nbrigades, of four regiments each, on their march in that road,\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General Grant. At daylight Lord Stirling was\r\nordered with two battalions, into that road, to oppose the enemy. He\r\ntook post on an eminence in front of the enemy whereupon a smart fight\r\nensued, which lasted near an hour, and then abated. Two field-pieces\r\nwere sent to Lord Stirling, which soon began to play upon the enemy,\r\nwho returned the fire from four field-pieces. The two parties stood\r\nopposed to each other for near five hours, without either seeming to\r\nhave the advantage, keeping up a continual fire from their\r\nfield-pieces, and musketry, with some intervals.--About 8 o'clock\r\nGeneral Sullivan sent (went?) down the flat (bush) middle (road) and\r\ninquired of the guards whether they discovered any movements of the\r\nenemy in either of the roads. He was informed that the whole body of\r\nthe enemy had moved up the Yellow Hook road, whereupon he ordered\r\nanother battalion to the assistance of lord Stirling, keeping 800 men\r\nto guard the pass.--About 9 o'clock, the enemy, who came by the\r\nHalfway House, advancing, began a fire in the rear of the party and\r\nadvanced briskly to attack the men who guarded that Pass. General\r\nSullivan hearing at the same instant that the enemy were passing\r\nthrough the woods to attack Lord Stirling in the rear, ordered 400 men\r\nto succor him, and sent him orders to retreat as soon as possible. The\r\nenemy then wheeled off to the right, and marched up to Fort Green in a\r\ncolumn to attack.--Upon receiving a heavy fire from the lines, were\r\nforced to retire. They then fell back, and endeavored to cut off Lord\r\nStirling's retreat by destroying his party. He, with a party of his\r\ntroops' made an attempt on the enemy's left, commanded by Lord\r\nCornwallis, and ordered the rest of the troops to retreat across the\r\ncreek, which they did with some loss. The number of the enemy engaged\r\nwas not less than 11,000; of ours not more than 3,000. The enemy's\r\nloss in killed was over 1,000, exceeding ours.\r\n\r\n     [From the _South Carolina and American General Gazette_,\r\n     Charleston, Oct. 2, 1776, as reprinted in the _Brooklyn\r\n     Advocate_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 20.]\r\n\r\nJOURNAL OF COL. SAMUEL MILES\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1776, I was appointed to the command of a regiment of\r\nriflemen, consisting of 1,000 men, formed in two battalions.... My\r\nregiment was soon ordered to join the army at New York. At that time\r\nGeneral Washington had 24,000 men in his army, upwards of 7,000 of\r\nwhom were returned sick and unfit for duty.\r\n\r\nOn the landing of the British army on Long Island, I was ordered over\r\nwith my rifle regiment to watch their motions. I marched near to the\r\nvillage of Flat Bush, where the Highlanders then lay, but they moved\r\nthe next day to Gen'l Howe's camp, and their place was supplied by the\r\nHessians. I lay here within cannon shot of the Hessian camp for four\r\ndays without receiving a single order from Gen'l Sullivan, who\r\ncommanded on Long Island, out of the lines. The day before the action\r\nhe came to the camp, and I then told him the situation of the British\r\nArmy; that Gen'l Howe, with the main body, lay on my left, about a\r\nmile and a-half or two miles, and I was convinced when the army moved\r\nthat Gen'l Howe would fall into the Jamaica road, and I hoped there\r\nwere troops there to watch them. Notwithstanding this information,\r\nwhich indeed he might have obtained from his own observation, if he\r\nhad attended to his duty as a General ought to have done; no steps\r\nwere taken, but there was a small redoubt in front of the village\r\nwhich seemed to take up the whole of his attention, and where he\r\nstayed until the principal part of the British army had gotten between\r\nhim and the lines, by which means he was made prisoner as well as\r\nmyself. If Gen'l Sullivan had taken the requisite precaution, and\r\ngiven his orders agreeably to the attention of the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nthere would have been few if any prisoners taken on the 27th of\r\nAugust, 1776. As Gordon in his history of the war has charged me\r\nindirectly with not doing my duty, I will here state my position and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nI lay directly in front of the village of Flat Bush, but on the left\r\nof the road leading to New York, where the Hessians were Encamped. We\r\nwere so near each other, that their shells they sometimes fired went\r\nmany rods beyond my camp. The main body of the Enemy, under the\r\nimmediate command of Gen'l Howe, lay about 2 miles to my left, and\r\nGeneral Grant, with another body of British troops, lay about four\r\nmiles on my right. There were several small bodies of Americans\r\ndispersed to my right, but not a man to my left, although the main\r\nbody of the Enemy lay to my left, of which I had given General\r\nSullivan notice. This was our situation on the 26th of August. About\r\none o'clock at night Gen. Grant, on the right, and Gen. Howe, on my\r\nleft began their march, and by daylight Grant had got within a mile of\r\nour entrenchments, and Gen. Howe had got into the Jamaica road about\r\ntwo miles from our lines. The Hessians kept their position until 7 in\r\nthe morning. As soon as they moved the firing began at our redoubt. I\r\nimmediately marched towards where firing was, but had not proceeded\r\nmore than 1 or 200 yards until I was stopped by Colonel Wyllys, who\r\ntold me that I could not pass on; that we were to defend a road that\r\nlead from Flatbush road to the Jamaica road. Col. Wyllys bearing a\r\nContinental, and I a State commission, he was considered a senior\r\nofficer and I was obliged to submit; but I told him I was convinced\r\nthe main body of the enemy would take the Jamaica road, that there was\r\nno probability of their coming along the road he was then guarding,\r\nand if he would not let me proceed to where the firing was, I would\r\nreturn and endeavor to get into the Jamaica road before Gen. Howe. To\r\nthis he consented, and I immediately made a retrograde march, and\r\nafter marching nearly two miles, the whole distance through woods, I\r\narrived within sight of the Jamaica road, and to my great\r\nmortification I saw the main body of the enemy in full march between\r\nme and our lines, and the baggage guard just coming into the road. A\r\nthought struck me of attacking the baggage guard, and, if possible, to\r\ncut my way through them and proceed to Hell Gate to cross the Sound.\r\nI, however, ordered the men to remain quite still, (I had then but the\r\nfirst battalion with me, for the second being some distance in the\r\nrear, I directed Major Williams, who was on horseback, to return and\r\norder Lt. Col. Brodhead to push on by the left of the enemy and\r\nendeavor get into our lines that way, and happily they succeeded, but\r\nhad to wade a mill dam by which a few were drowned,) and I took the\r\nadjutant with me and crept as near the road as I thought prudent, to\r\ntry and ascertain the number of the baggage guard, and I saw a\r\ngrenadier stepping into the woods. I got a tree between him and me\r\nuntil he came near, and I took him prisoner and examined him. I found\r\nthat there was a whole brigade with the baggage, commanded by a\r\ngeneral officer.\r\n\r\nI immediately returned to the battalion and called a council of the\r\nofficers and laid three propositions before them: 1_st_, to attack the\r\nbaggage guard and endeavor to cut our way through them and proceed to\r\nHell Gate and so cross the Sound; 2_nd_, to lay where we were until\r\nthe whole had passed us and then proceed to Hell Gate; or, 3_d_, to\r\nendeavor to force our way through the enemy's flank guards into our\r\nline at Brooklyn. The first was thought a dangerous and useless\r\nattempt as the enemy was so superior in force. The 2nd I thought the\r\nmost eligible, for it was evident that adopting either of the other\r\npropositions we must lose a number of men without affecting the enemy\r\nmaterially, as we had so small a force, not more than 230 men. This\r\nwas, however, objected to, under the idea that we should be blamed for\r\nnot fighting at all, and perhaps charged with cowardice, which would\r\nbe worse than death itself. The 3d proposition was therefore adopted,\r\nand we immediately began our march, but had not proceeded more than\r\nhalf a mile until we fell in with a body of 7 or 800 light infantry,\r\nwhich we attacked without any hesitation, but their superiority of\r\nnumbers encouraged them to march up with their bayonets, which we\r\ncould not withstand, having none ourselves. I therefore ordered the\r\nTroops to push on towards our lines. I remained on the ground myself\r\nuntil they had all passed me, (the enemy were then within less than 20\r\nyards of us,) and by this means I came into the rear instead of the\r\nfront of my command. We had proceeded but a short distance before we\r\nwere again engaged with a superior body of the enemy, and here we lost\r\na number of men, but took Major Moncrieffe, their commanding officer,\r\nprisoner, but he was a Scotch prize for Ensign Brodhead, who took him\r\nand had him in possession for some hours, was obliged to surrender\r\nhimself. Finding that the enemy had possession of the ground between\r\nus and our lines, and that it was impossible to cut our way through as\r\na body, I directed the men to make the best of their way as well as\r\nthey could; some few got in safe, but there were 159 taken prisoners.\r\nI was myself entirely cut off from our lines and therefore endeavored\r\nto conceal myself, with a few men who would not leave me. I hoped to\r\nremain until night, when I intended to try to get to Hell Gate and\r\ncross the Sound; but about 3 o'clock in the afternoon was discovered\r\nby a party of Hessians and obliged to surrender--thus ended the career\r\nof that day.\r\n\r\n     [Penn. Archives, Second Series, Vol. I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 21.]\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-COL. DANIEL BRODHEAD TO ----\r\n\r\nCAMP NEAR KINGSBRIDGE, 5th Sep'r, 1776.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI doubt not the Hon'ble the Convention of the State of Penn'a, is\r\nanxious to know the state of the Provincial Troops since the Battle on\r\nLong Island, and as I have now all the information to be expected\r\nconcerning it for the present, will give them every circumstance that\r\noccurs to me. On the 26th of last month, Gen'ls Putnam, Sullivan and\r\nothers came to our camp which was to the left of all the other posts\r\nand proceeded to reconnoitre the enemie's lines to the right, when\r\nfrom the movements of the enemy they might plainly discover they were\r\nadvancing towards Jamaica, and extending their lines to the left so as\r\nto march round us, for our lines to the left, were, for want of\r\nVidettes, left open for at least four miles where we constantly\r\nscouted by Day, which beside mounting a Guard of one hundred men & an\r\nadvance party of subaltern and thirty to the left of us, was hard Duty\r\nfor our Reg't: during the night of the 26th, we were alarmed three\r\nDifferent times and stood to our Arms. As soon as it was light, Col.\r\nMiles, from the right of our first Battn, sent me orders to follow\r\nhim with the second, to the left of our lines; when I had marched\r\nabout half a mile, I was ordered to the right about to join Col.\r\nWillis's regt of New England troops, but by the time I returned to\r\nthe camp, Major Williams on horseback, overtook me with orders from\r\nCol. Miles, to march Obliquely & join him, but could not say where I\r\nmight find him; I Observed the orders and directed a Subaltern from\r\nthe front of the Battn (which was marching in Indian file) with a\r\nsmall party to the left of the Battn, and desired Major Patton to\r\nsend a Subaltern & small party from the rear to the right of the front\r\nof the Battalion, which he mistook and took the one-half of the\r\nBattn to the right, about two hundred yards, which immediately\r\nthrew the half the Battn, so far to the rear as to render it very\r\ndifficult to join without sustaining great loss, for presently after\r\nwe left our camp we discovered the Enemie's horse & foot to the number\r\nof four or five Thousand in our front, and as we could discover\r\nnothing of the first Battn, the Enemy being vastly superior to us\r\nin Number, I immediately ordered the Battn to gain a Wood to the\r\nleft and then formed, but seeing a Number of Artillerymen dragging a\r\nbrass field-piece & Howit through a clear field in order to gain a\r\nwood a little to the left of our Front, and knowing the Enemy were\r\nalso in our rear, I ordered that part of the Battn which was then\r\nwith me, to proceed to the second wood, & cover the Artillery and make\r\na stand, but the New England Regt aforementioned coming up with us,\r\nand running thro' our files broke them, and in the confusion many of\r\nour men run with them. I did all in my power to rally the musquetry &\r\nRiflemen, but to no purpose, so that when we came to engage the Enemy,\r\nI had not fifty men, notwithstanding which, we after about three\r\nRounds, caused the Enemy to retire, and as the Enemy's main body was\r\nthen nearly between us and the lines, I retreated to the lines, having\r\nlost out of the whole Battalion, about one hundred men, officers\r\nincluded, which, as they were much scattered, must be chiefly\r\nprisoners; during this time, four or five Reg'ts, among which were our\r\nmusquetry & flying Camp, Delaware & Maryland Reg'ts, and some of our\r\nRiflemen who had joined them, were engaged to the left of us and right\r\nof the Lines. I had no sooner got into the Lines than the Enemy\r\nadvanced up to them and kept up a brisk fire on us, but only one man\r\nkilled in the Lines; as soon as we returned the fire with our rifles\r\nand musquetry, they retreated, and if we had been provided with a\r\nfield piece or two, of which we had a sufficient number elsewhere, we\r\nmight have killed the greater part of their advance party; as soon as\r\nthe Enemy were beaten from the lines, I was ordered to a point about a\r\nmile and a-half to the right, to cover the retreat of the Delaware\r\nBattalion and the other Troops that might come over under the constant\r\nfire of the Enemie's field pieces and Howits; here I remained 'till\r\nalmost night before I was relieved, notwithstanding the Generals there\r\nhad a number of Reg'ts who were not engaged, and had had little or no\r\nfatigue. Upon the whole, less Generalship never was shown in any Army\r\nsince the Art of War was understood, except in the retreat from Long\r\nIsland, which was well conducted. No troops could behave better than\r\nthe Southern, for though they seldom engaged less than five to one,\r\nthey frequently repulsed the Enemy with great Slaughter, and I am\r\nconfident that the number of killed and wounded on their side, is\r\ngreater than on ours, notwithstanding we had to fight them front &\r\nrear under every disadvantage. I understand that Gen. Sullivan has\r\ntaken the Liberty to charge our brave and good Col. Miles, with the\r\nill success of the Day, but give me leave to say, that if Gen.\r\nSullivan & the rest of the Gen'ls on Long Island, had been as Vigilant\r\n& prudent as him, we might, & in all probability would have cut off\r\nClinton's Brigade; our officers & men in general, considering the\r\nconfusion, behaved as well as men could do--a very few behaved ill, of\r\nwhich, when I am informed, will write you.... Col. Miles & Col. Piper\r\nare prisoners, and I hear are well treated, poor Atly I can hear\r\nnothing of. Col. Parry died like a Hero. No allowance has as yet been\r\nmade for the Lieutenant Coll's and Majors Table Expenses, in care of\r\nseparate commands. I hope we shall be put upon as respectable a\r\nfooting on that acc't as the Maryland officers are, our present pay\r\nbeing not more than half sufficient to support us according to our\r\nRank in this Tory Country.\r\n\r\nI am Dear Sir, in great Haste, your most H'ble Serv't\r\n  DANIEL BRODHEAD.\r\n\r\nP.S. The Great Gen'l Putnam could not, tho' requested, send out one\r\nReg't to cover our retreat.\r\n\r\n     [Penn. Archives, First Series, Vol. V.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 22.]\r\n\r\nCOL. WILLIAM DOUGLAS TO HIS WIFE\r\n\r\nNORTHFORD, CONN.\r\n\r\n[LONG ISLAND, Feb. 26 (?) 1776.][234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: At the time of writing this letter, Col. Douglas was\r\nMajor of Ward's regiment which enlisted for six weeks' service under\r\nLee, and which was stationed by him on Long Island. The fortification\r\nthey were soon to begin was Fort Stirling.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR,\r\n\r\nOur Regiment is now stationed on _Long Island_ at and about the ferry.\r\nWe shall soon begin a fortification on this side that will command the\r\nEast River and the town. The troops in the City are fortifying in one\r\nof the Streets that will command the old fort, if the Enemy should get\r\npossession of it, (and are putting down the rear of the fort.) We have\r\nbegun another Fort near \"Hell Gate.\" The men of war have dropped down\r\nbelow the town and are very quiet, but supplied from the City by\r\norders of this Congress. Our troops are very hearty and fare well as\r\ntimes will admit, most of the valuable articles are moved out of the\r\nCity, and one third of the inhabitants. What are left behind look\r\nserious, as it is now a serious point with them. The destruction of\r\nsuch a City as this would be a great loss, & I hope it will be\r\nprevented. It will be in vain for us to expect to keep the shipping\r\nout of the North River, unless we can fortify at the Narrows, where I\r\nintend to view as soon as the weather is good. The Fenoex now lays\r\nthere in order to guard that place, but will not fire on us.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, July 20th, 1776.\r\n\r\nYou have likely heard before this that two ships passed this City\r\nyesterday week, through a warm fire from our batteries, our Gunners\r\nbeing in too much haste (I make no doubt,) was the occasion of our not\r\ndoing them much damage! and us the _loss_ of 4 men in loading our\r\nCannon. The Enemy did us no harm by their own shot and shells, which\r\nwas warmly applied,--as soon as the fire had got pretty warm I receivd\r\norders to march my Regt to the grand parade which brought us into\r\nBroadway, that leads along the North River, and as we were on our\r\nmarch in Broadway the tyrants did not fail to pelt at that part of the\r\ntown smartly, but luckily for us the houses fended off the shot very\r\nwell, &c.... My Regt is now quartered in _Broad Street_.\r\n\r\nN. YORK the 27th July, 1776.\r\n\r\nNo new arrivals of the enemy. The ships that went up the River I\r\nbelieve would now be glad they were safe back to their old station (by\r\ntheir motion). I had the Honor to dine with his Excellency Genl.\r\nWashington day before yesterday at which time he had nothing new from\r\nany quarter....\r\n\r\nNEW YORK Aug. 10, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe enemy have a very formidable Army (some say more) but I suppose\r\nequal in number to ours, and from the best intelligence it is expected\r\nthey will give us Battle soon, at which time I hope God in his\r\ninfinite mercy will be on our side, and we shall have no occasion to\r\ndread their numbers, or experience. Our cause being so _just_, I\r\ncannot but hope for success. Our lines are very extensive. The Enemy\r\nare very compact, and together; at what place they will bend their\r\nfury is unknown, but is expected to be at this City, and Long Island.\r\nThere sailed night before last, three Frigates and thirty transports\r\nfrom the Hook, supposed to be gone round the east end of Long Island,\r\nand are to come through the Sound, and land on the main to the\r\nEastward of us, whilst the Shipping goes up the north river, and lands\r\nabove us and endeavor to meet. If this be their plan I think we must\r\nmost surely work them! I suppose they may possibly fire the town, as\r\nthe buildings are many of them wood & very dry. But I do not believe\r\nthey will fire the town until they grow dubious about the victory, and\r\nthat will only serve to encourage us, and when the town is burned it\r\nwill be much easier to defend ourselves than at present. If the\r\n\"_Hessian_\" troops are so lucky as to fall into our hands I am in\r\nhopes they will meet with such treatment as properly belongs to their\r\nBloody crimes! For we have had no dispute with them but [they] have\r\nturned themselves out as murderers of the innocent.\r\n\r\nN. YORK, 13th of Augst 1776.\r\n\r\nThere was 43 large Ships came in yesterday--31 Ships, 10 Brigs & one\r\nScow. I am now going to sound the channel to see if it will not do to\r\nsink some vessels against the fort....\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, Augst 23, 1776.\r\n\r\n... The Enemy landed yesterday on Long Island, at _Gravesend_, about\r\nnine miles from our lines; our flying parties are annoying them all\r\nthe while. We have reinforced our side and I hope will be able to make\r\na good stand. We expect the fleet up every tide, if the wind serves.\r\nOur fire ships in the North River have behaved manfully, have burnt\r\none of their tenders. The rest of the enemy left the river the first\r\nopportunity afterwards. Our _Connecticut_ Militia have come in\r\n_bravely_; _twelve Regts_ were on the grand parade yesterday at one\r\ntime! Almost one half of the grand army now consists of _Connecticut\r\nTroops_!\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, Saturday, Augst 24, 1776.\r\n\r\n... Our men had yesterday two small brushes with the enemy on Long\r\nIsland, and repulsed them both times. As yet things look well on our\r\nside; a few days will now determine as the work is begun. Our troops\r\nare really in high spirits, and it is a general voice, let them come\r\non as they _can_ or dare! There has been a heavy clashing of Arms on\r\nLong Island this morning, but have not yet heard the Consequence....\r\n\r\nN. YORK, Augst 26th 1776.\r\n\r\nI am very well although many in the Regt are sick. We have not had\r\nany general action yet. The two Armies are intrenched on Long Island\r\nvery near each other and very often exchange a few shots. We have had\r\nno considerable loss as yet. Col. Martin of the Jersey's is supposed\r\nto be mortally wounded. Both the lines are constantly reinforcing, and\r\nby all appearances a general action can't be far off; we have got the\r\nadvantage of the hills & woods, they of the plains. We shall not\r\napproach their lines, and if they do ours, it must cost them dear. The\r\nwind and tide served this morning, but they have not dared to give us\r\nbattle in the City yet. The Lieut. Col. of the first battalion of York\r\ntroops is now before a court marshall for treacherous behavior, and by\r\nthe best accounts he will undoubtedly lose his life. I hope God in his\r\nprovidence will guard us from falling by our open enemy, and from all\r\n_traiterous wretches_.... It is expected that they mean to give battle\r\nat two places at one and the same time, that is Long Island, and this\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nN. YORK, Augst 31, 1776.\r\n\r\nI take this as the first opportunity to acquaint you that on Tuesday\r\nlast we got a severe flogging on Long Island. The enemy surrounded a\r\nlarge detachment of our army, took many, killed some, and the rest got\r\noff. Major Genl. Sullivan & Brigr Genl. Lord Sterling, Col. Clark\r\nand several other field officers are prisoners. Col. Johnson was\r\nkilled. By the best act's we killed more of them than they did of us.\r\nBut they took the most prisoners. We took twenty one, which I am a\r\nwitness to, as they came through my Regt as I was in the woods for\r\na covering party, and to prevent the enemy from flanking our right\r\nwing. We were prevented from getting even one shot at them by a large\r\ncreek which we could not cross. I remained at the most extreme part of\r\nthe right wing of our Army in a thick wood to prevent their crossing a\r\ncreek, where our sentry's could hail and often fire at each other,\r\nuntil night before last when I received orders to call in my guard\r\n_all_, and march immediately with the utmost silence, which was soon\r\ndone, and the whole army retreated into this city, without the loss of\r\nany lives, except 4 or 5, which were late yesterday morning and were\r\nshot in a boat, as they were coming off. We have also evacuated\r\nGovernor's Island where we have lost some Cannon. What is to be our\r\nnext manouver I can't tell but I hope it is to make a good stand\r\nsomewhere. I am well convinced that for us to try to defend Long\r\nIsland, New York, and the Jersey's against their land forces &\r\nshipping will require _three armies_ as large as theirs, as they have\r\nthe water carriage to place their men when & where they please. Many\r\npeople I suppose will wonder at our leaving Long Island. But I would\r\nhave them suspend their judgment for a while, as they know not our\r\nsituation or the _enemies_! The shipping lay now close by the city,\r\nand can in half an hour be abreast of it with the tide. I expect we\r\n[shall] soon have a cannonade from our own battery on Long Island,\r\n(Fort Sterling) which I have the mortification to think I helped build\r\nmyself, in cold tedious weather! They fired smartly from it yesterday\r\nat our boats passing from Governor's Island....\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY SEAT NEAR TURTLE BAY,\r\n  Septr 7th 1776.\r\n\r\nOur Army is now in three grand Divisions. One at the City, which is\r\nour _right_ wing, commanded by Genl. Putnam, one at and above Kings\r\nBridge, commanded by Genl Heath, and one at and about Harlem,\r\ncommanded by Genl Spencer, which is the Division that I belong to, and\r\nis called the Center Division. I have three Regts of militia in my\r\nBrigade and they give me much fatigue & trouble. Col's. Cook,\r\nPettibone, & Talcott are the commanders. We are encouraged by 1500\r\nTroops which have come in from Maryland. I am sorry to say it but it\r\nis a truth, I do not believe that we have got in all our Army as many\r\nmen as the enemy. I have heard that it has been said in the country\r\nthat we should not have left Long Island, but salied out and drove the\r\nenemy off. We never were more than _one_ to _three_, on the Island,\r\nneither was it so prudent to abandon other posts for that, as the\r\nshipping could & have since come up the East River and then our\r\ncommunication was gone, and the Army with it. We are now so as one\r\npart can get to the other, without water carriage, & think if we will\r\nonly stand by each other, and not run home like cowards, with God's\r\nblessing, we may keep them off, which is a victory of itself! I have\r\ntaken unwearied pains with the Militia, and I am afraid it is too much\r\nfatigue for me, as my cough is a little increased. But I hope it is\r\nonly for a short time.... My expenses has been so large that my money\r\nfalls a little short. I was obliged to entirely support the sick of my\r\nRegt for some time, but I suppose you have none to spare. I shall\r\nmake out, but not so well as I could wish....\r\n\r\nIN THE FIELD AT THE LINES ON HARLAM HEIGHTS,\r\n  18th Sept 1776.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote last we have had different scenes to go through. I lay\r\nwith my brigade a little below Turtle Bay where we hove up lines for\r\nmore than one mile in length. Gen'l Wadsworth managed the lines on the\r\nright and I on the left. We lay in the lines Friday and Saturday\r\nnights. Sunday morning at break of day, five ships weighed anchor and\r\nfell in close within a musket shot of our lines quite to the left of\r\nme. I then moved my brigade abreast of them. They lay very quiet until\r\n10 o'clock and by that time they had about 80 of their boats from\r\nunder Long Island shore full with men which contained about five or\r\nsix thousand and four transports full ready to come in the second\r\nboats. They very suddenly began as heavy a canonade perhaps as ever\r\nwas from no more ships, as they had nothing to molest them, but to\r\nfire on us at their pleasure, from their tops and everywhere--their\r\nboats got under cover of the smoke of the shipping and then struck to\r\nthe left of my lines in order to cut me of from a retreat. My left\r\nwing gave way which was formed of the militia. I lay myself on the\r\nright wing waiting for the boats until Capt Prentice came to me and\r\ntold me, if I meant to save myself to leave the lines for that was the\r\norders on the left and that they had left the lines. I then told my\r\nmen to make the best of their way as I found I had but about ten left\r\nwith me. They soon moved out and I then made the best of my way out.\r\nWe then had a mile to retreat through as hot a fire as could well be\r\nmade but they mostly overshot us. The brigade was then in such a\r\nscattered poster that I could not collect them and I found the whole\r\narmy on a retreat. The regulars came up in the rear and gave me\r\nseveral platoons at a time when I had none of my men with me and I was\r\nso beat out that they would have had me a prisoner had not I found an\r\nofficer that was obliged to leave his horse because he could not get\r\nhim over a fence so as to get out of their way. I found myself gone if\r\nI could not ride. I went over the fence and got the horse over whilst\r\nthey were firing, mounted him and rode off. We halted here at night\r\nand on Monday the enemy came on and we gave them a good drubbing. I\r\nhave not time to give you the particulars of any part of our action. I\r\nhave lost my major, a prisoner,--One sargeant or more killed and four\r\nwounded,--have missing out of my brigade which sustained the whole\r\nfire but 8 or 9 as yet. I hope God will be on our side at last. It is\r\nmemoriable that I have lost no more and God be praised for it. Our\r\nlines are now good and if they dare come on without their shipping I\r\nhope we shall give them a drubbing. In the utmost haste\r\n\r\nFrom your faithful husband\r\n  WM.

I was ordered\r\nout with my regiment with three others to meet and endeavor to retard\r\ntheir march. We moved on and at about twelve were attacked by their\r\nadvanced guard. We drove them back but soon after the main body came\r\non and we stood them until they got on our flank and I ordered a\r\nretreat. We had a most severe fire to retreat under, ten men to our\r\none, but we came off in good order and very surely fired on our\r\nretreat all the way. I lost three dead and five wounded. They cut my\r\nregiment off from our main body and got ahead of me but I took\r\nadvantage of a wood and got clear of them. My regiment has the honour\r\nof behaving most nobly. They are now near neighbors, our lines are\r\nabout half a mile.\r\n\r\n     [Originals in possession of Benj. Douglas, Esq., Middletown,\r\n     Conn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 23.]\r\n\r\nGEN. WOODHULL TO THE NEW YORK CONVENTION\r\n\r\nHARLEM.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA, August 27th, 1776.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN--I am now at Jamaica with less than 100 men, having brought\r\nall the cattle from the westward and southward of the hills, and have\r\nsent them off with the troops of horse, with orders to take all the\r\nrest eastward of this place, to the eastward of Hempstead Plains, to\r\nput them into fields and to set a guard over them.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, I am informed, are entrenching southward, and from the\r\nheights near Howard's.\r\n\r\nI have now received yours, with several resolutions, which I wish it\r\nwas in my power to put in execution; but unless Cols. Smith and\r\nRemsen, mentioned in yours, join me with their regiments, or some\r\nother assistance immediately, I shall not be able, for the people are\r\nall moving east, and I cannot get any assistance from them. I shall\r\ncontinue here as long as I can, in hopes of a reinforcement; but if\r\nnone comes soon, I shall retreat and drive the stock before me into\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nCols. Smith and Remsen, I think, cannot join me. Unless you can send\r\nme some other assistance, I fear I shall soon be obliged to quit this\r\nplace. I hope soon to hear from you.\r\n\r\nI am, gentlemen, your most humble serv't.\r\n  NATHANIEL WOODHULL.\r\n\r\nWESTWARD OF QUEENS COUNTY, August 27th, 1776.\r\n\r\nInclosed I send you a letter from Col. Potter, who left me yesterday\r\nat 11 o'clock, after bringing about 100 men to me at Jamaica. Major\r\nSmith, I expect has all the rest that were to come from Suffolk\r\ncounty. There have about 40 of the militia joined me from the\r\nregiments in Queens county, and about 50 of the troop belonging to\r\nKings and Queens counties, which is nearly all I expect. I have got\r\nall the cattle southward of the hills in Kings county, to the eastward\r\nof the cross-road between the two counties, and have placed guards and\r\nsentinels from the north road to the south side of the Island, in\r\norder to prevent the cattle's going back, and to prevent the\r\ncommunication of the tories with the enemy. I am within about six\r\nmiles of the enemy's camp: their light horse have been within about\r\ntwo miles, and unless I have more men, our stay here will answer no\r\npurpose. We shall soon want to be supplied with provisions, if we\r\ntarry here.\r\n\r\nJAMAICA, August 28th, 1776.\r\n\r\nI must again let you know my situation. I have about 70 men and about\r\n20 of the troop, which is all the force I have or can expect, and I am\r\ndaily growing less in number. The people are so alarmed in Suffolk,\r\nthat they will not any more of them march; and as to Cols. Smith and\r\nRemsen, they cannot join me, for the communication is cut off between\r\nus. I have sent about 1100 cattle to the great fields on the plains,\r\nyesterday. About 300 more have gone off this morning to the same\r\nplace, and I have ordered a guard of an officer and seven privates.\r\nThey can get no water in those fields. My men and horses are worn out\r\nwith fatigue. The cattle are not all gone off towards Hempstead. I\r\nordered them off yesterday; but they were not able to take them along.\r\nI yesterday brought about 300 from Newtown. I think the cattle are in\r\nas much danger on the north side as on the south side; and have\r\nordered the inhabitants to remove them, if you cannot send me an\r\nimmediate reinforcement.\r\n\r\n     [Journals of the New York Provincial Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 24.]\r\n\r\nGEN. WASHINGTON TO ABRAHAM YATES, NEW YORK CONVENTION\r\n\r\nLONG-ISLAND, Aug. 28th, 1776.\r\n\r\nSIR--I was just now honored with your favor of this date, with General\r\nWoodhull's letter, and should esteem myself happy, were it in my power\r\nto afford the assistance required, but the enemy having landed a\r\nconsiderable part of their force, here, and at the same time may have\r\nreserved some to attack New-York, it is the opinion, not only of\r\nmyself, but of all my general officers I have had an opportunity of\r\nconsulting with, that the men we have are not more than competent to\r\nthe defence of those lines, and the several posts which must be\r\ndefended. This reason, and this alone, prevents my complying with your\r\nrequest. I shall beg leave to mention, in confidence, that a few days\r\nago, upon the enemy's first landing here, I wrote to Governor\r\nTrumbull, recommending him to throw over a body of 1000 men on the\r\nIsland to annoy the enemy in their rear, if the state of the colony\r\nwould admit of it. Whether it will be done I cannot determine. That\r\ncolony having furnished a large proportion of men, I was, and still\r\nam, doubtful whether it could be done. If it could, I am satisfied it\r\nwill, from the zeal and readiness they have ever shown to give every\r\npossible succour. I am hopeful they will be in a condition to do it;\r\nand if they are, those troops, I doubt not, will be ready and willing\r\nto give General Woodhull any assistance he may want. But cannot the\r\nmilitia effect what he wishes to do? They, I believe, must be depended\r\non in the present instance for relief.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, in great haste,\r\n  Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n    GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n     [Journals of the New York Provincial Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 25.]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HITCHCOCK TO COLONEL LITTLE\r\n\r\nCAMP ON LONG ISLAND.\r\n\r\nN.

J. Little, Esq.,\r\n     Cambridge, Mass.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 26.]\r\n\r\nMAJOR TALLMADGE'S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES OF LONG ISLAND AND WHITE\r\nPLAINS.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the enemy indicating an intention to approach New\r\nYork by the way of Long Island, Gen. Washington ordered about 10,000\r\nmen to embark and cross the East River at Brooklyn. The regiment to\r\nwhich I belonged was among the first that crossed over, and, on the\r\n27th of August, the whole British army, consisting of their own\r\nnative troops, Hessians, Brunswickers, Waldeckers, etc, to the number\r\nof at least 25,000 men, with a most formidable train of field\r\nartillery, landed near Flatbush, under cover of their shipping, and\r\nmoved towards Jamaica and Brooklyn. As our troops had advanced to meet\r\nthe enemy, the action soon commenced, and was continued, at intervals,\r\nthrough most of the day. Before such an overwhelming force of\r\ndisciplined troops, our small band could not maintain their ground and\r\nthe main body retired within their lines at Brooklyn, while a body of\r\nLong Island Militia, under Gen. Woodhull, took their stand at Jamaica.\r\nHere Gen. Woodhull was taken prisoner and inhumanly killed. The main\r\nbody of our army, under Major-Gen. Sullivan and Lord Stirling, fought\r\nin detached bodies, and on the retreat both of those officers were\r\nmade prisoners. I also lost a brother the same day, who fell into\r\ntheir hands, and was afterwards literally starved to death in one of\r\ntheir prisons; nor would the enemy suffer relief from his friends to\r\nbe afforded to him.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in my life that I had witnessed the awful\r\nscene of a battle, when man was engaged to destroy his fellow man. I\r\nwell remember my sensations on the occasion, for they were solemn\r\nbeyond description, and very hardly could I bring my mind to be\r\nwilling to attempt the life of a fellow-creature. Our army having\r\nretired beyond their intrenchment, which extended from Vanbrunt's\r\nMills, on the West, to the East River, flanked occasionally by\r\nredoubts, the British army took their position, in full array,\r\ndirectly in front of our position. Our intrenchment was so weak, that\r\nit is most wonderful the British General did not attempt to storm it\r\nsoon after the battle, in which his troops had been victorious. Gen.\r\nWashington was so fully aware of the perilous situation of this\r\ndivision of his army, that he immediately convened a council of war,\r\nat which the propriety of retiring to New York was decided on. After\r\nsustaining incessant fatigue and constant watchfulness for two days\r\nand nights, attended by heavy rain, exposed every moment to an attack\r\nfrom a vastly superior force in front, and to be cut off from the\r\npossibility of retreat to New York, by the fleet, which might enter\r\nthe East River, on the night of the 29th of August, Gen. Washington\r\ncommenced recrossing his troops from Brooklyn to New York. To move so\r\nlarge a body of troops, with all their necessary appendages, across a\r\nriver full a mile wide, with a rapid current, in face of a victorious,\r\nwell disciplined army, nearly three times as numerous as his own, and\r\na fleet capable of stopping the navigation, so that not one boat could\r\nhave passed over, seemed to present most formidable obstacles. But, in\r\nthe face of these difficulties, the Commander-in-Chief so arranged his\r\nbusiness, that on the evening of the 29th, by 10 o'clock, the\r\ntroops began to retire from the lines in such a manner that no chasm\r\nwas made in the lines, but as one regiment left their station on\r\nguard, the remaining troops moved to the right and left and filled up\r\nthe vacancies, while Gen. Washington took his station at the ferry,\r\nand superintended the embarkation of the troops. It was one of the\r\nmost anxious, busy nights that I ever recollect, and being the third\r\nin which hardly any of us had closed our eyes to sleep, we were all\r\ngreatly fatigued. As the dawn of the next day approached, those of us\r\nwho remained in the trenches became very anxious for our own safety,\r\nand when the dawn appeared there were several regiments still on duty.\r\nAt this time a very dense fog began to rise, and it seemed to settle\r\nin a peculiar manner over both encampments. I recollect this peculiar\r\nprovidential occurrence perfectly well; and so very dense was the\r\natmosphere that I could scarcely discern a man at six yards' distance.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose we had just received orders to leave the lines, but\r\nbefore we reached the ferry, the Commander-in-Chief sent one of his\r\nAids to order the regiment to repair again to their former station on\r\nthe lines. Col. Chester immediately faced to the right about and\r\nreturned, where we tarried until the sun had risen, but the fog\r\nremained as dense as ever. Finally, the second order arrived for the\r\nregiment to retire, and we very joyfully bid those trenches a long\r\nadieu. When we reached Brooklyn ferry, the boats had not returned\r\nfrom their last trip, but they very soon appeared and took the whole\r\nregiment over to New York; and I think I saw Gen. Washington on the\r\nferry stairs when I stepped into one of the last boats that received\r\nthe troops. I left my horse tied to a post at the ferry.\r\n\r\nThe troops having now all safely reached New York, and the fog\r\ncontinuing as thick as ever, I began to think of my favorite horse,\r\nand requested leave to return and bring him off. Having obtained\r\npermission, I called for a crew of volunteers to go with me, and\r\nguiding the boat myself, I obtained my horse and got off some distance\r\ninto the river before the enemy appeared in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the ferry, we were saluted merrily from their\r\nmusketry, and finally by their field pieces; but we returned in\r\nsafety. In the history of warfare, I do not recollect a more fortunate\r\nretreat. After all, the providential appearance of the fog saved a\r\npart of our army from being captured, and certainly myself among\r\nothers who formed the rear guard. Gen. Washington has never received\r\nthe credit which was due to him for this wise and most fortunate\r\nmeasure....\r\n\r\nAs the enemy showed a disposition to cross over into Westchester, Gen.\r\nWashington removed the main body of his army up to the White Plains,\r\ntaking possession of the high ground North and East of the town. Here\r\nhe seemed determined to take his stand, his lines extending from a\r\nmountain on the right, called Chadderton's Hill, to a lake or large\r\npond of water on his left. An intrenchment was thrown up from right to\r\nleft, behind which our army formed. Long poles with iron pikes upon\r\nthem, supplied the want of bayonets. Chadderton's Hill was separated\r\nfrom the right of our intrenchment by a valley of some extent, with\r\nthe river Bronx directly before it; but being within cannon shot of\r\nour intrenchment on the right, Gen. Washington thought it best to\r\noccupy it, and ordered Gen. McDougall, with 800 or 1000 men, to defend\r\nit, and if driven from it, to retire upon the right of the line. The\r\nAmerican army were all at their several posts on the last September\r\nand beginning of October; and here it looked as if Gen. Washington\r\nintended to give battle to the British army. On the 27th October,\r\n1776, it was announced at Head Quarters that the enemy was in motion\r\nfrom Westchester, through Eastchester, directly toward the White\r\nPlains. A detachment of 2000, or 3000 men was ordered to proceed on\r\nthe Old York road to meet the enemy in front. As _our brigade_ formed\r\na part of the force, I, of course, was among them. Before the dawn of\r\nday, on the 28th of October, we learned that the enemy were in full\r\nmarch directly in front of us. Gen. Spencer, who commanded this body\r\nof troops in advance, immediately made the necessary disposition to\r\nreceive the enemy, having the river Bronx on our right, and between us\r\nand the troops on Chadderton's Hill. At the dawn of day, the Hessian\r\ncolumn advanced within musket shot of our troops, when a full\r\ndischarge of musketry warned them of their danger. At first they fell\r\nback, but rallyed again immediately, and the column of British troops\r\nhaving advanced upon our left, made it necessary to retire. As stone\r\nwalls were frequent, our troops occasionally formed behind them, and\r\npoured a destructive fire into the Hessian ranks.\r\n\r\nIt, however, became necessary to retreat wholly before such an\r\noverwhelming force. To gain Chadderton's Hill, it became necessary to\r\ncross the Bronx, which was fordable at that place. The troops\r\nimmediately entered the river and ascended the Hill, while I being in\r\nthe rear, and mounted on horseback, endeavored to hasten the last of\r\nour troops, the Hessians then being within musket shot. When I reached\r\nthe bank of the river, and was about to enter it, our chaplain, the\r\nRev. Dr. Trumbull, sprang up behind me on my horse, and came with such\r\nforce as to carry me with my accoutrements, together with himself,\r\nheadlong into the river. This so entirely disconcerted me, that by the\r\ntime I reached the opposite bank of the river, the Hessian troops were\r\nabout to enter it, and considered me as their prisoner. As we ascended\r\nthe hill, I filed off to the right, expecting our troops on the hill\r\nwould soon give them a volley. When they had advanced within a few\r\nyards of a stone wall, behind which Gen. McDougall had placed them,\r\nour troops poured upon the Hessian column, under Gen. Rahl, such a\r\ndestructive fire, that they retreated down the hill in disorder,\r\nleaving a considerable number of the corps on the field. This relieved\r\nme from my perilous situation, and I immediately remounted my horse,\r\nand taking my course in the valley, directly between the hostile\r\narmies, I rode to Head Quarters, near the Court-house, and informed\r\nGen. Washington of the situation of the troops on Chadderton's Hill.\r\nThe enemy having rallied, and being reinforced, made a second attempt\r\nupon Gen. McDougall's detachment, who gave them a second warm\r\nreception; but, being overpowered, retired upon the right of our line,\r\nthen in order of battle. A severe cannonade was kept up from both\r\narmies through the day, and every moment did we expect the enemy would\r\nhave attempted to force us from our lines. In the mean time, Gen.\r\nWashington had begun to remove his stores and heavy baggage up to\r\nNorthcastle. After remaining in our lines and on constant military\r\nduty for several days and nights, on the 1st of November Gen.\r\nWashington retired with his army to the heights in the neighborhood of\r\nNorthcastle.\r\n\r\n     [Memoir of Col. Benjamin Tallmadge. Prepared by himself. New\r\n     York, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 27.]\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF EVENTS ON THE 15TH AND 16TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1776, BY\r\nPRIVATE JAMES S. MARTIN, OF COL. WM. DOUGLAS' REGIMENT\r\n\r\n... One evening while lying here (Turtle Bay) we heard a heavy\r\ncannonade at the city; and before dark saw four of the enemy's ships\r\nthat had passed the town and were coming up the East River; they\r\nanchored just below us. These ships were the Phoenix, of 44 guns;\r\nthe Roebuck of 44; the Rose of 32; and another the name of which I\r\nhave forgotten. Half of our regiment was sent off under the command of\r\nour Major, to man something that were called \"lines,\" although they\r\nwere nothing more than a ditch dug along on the bank of the river,\r\nwith the dirt thrown out towards the water. They staid in these lines\r\nduring the night, and returned to the camp in the morning unmolested.\r\nThe other half of the regiment went the next night, under the command\r\nof the Lieut.-Colonel, upon the like errand. We arrived at the lines\r\nabout dark, and were ordered to leave our packs in a copse wood, under\r\na guard, and go into the lines without them; what was the cause of\r\nthis piece of _wise_ policy I never knew; but I knew the effects of\r\nit, which was, that I never saw my knapsack from that day to this; nor\r\ndid any of the rest of our party, unless they came across them by\r\naccident in our retreat. We \"manned the lines\" and lay quite\r\nunmolested during the whole night. We had a chain of sentinels quite\r\nup the river for four or five miles in length. At an interval of every\r\nhalf hour, they passed the watch-word to each other--\"All is well.\" I\r\nheard the British on board their shipping answer, \"We will alter your\r\ntune before tomorrow night\"--and they were as good as their word for\r\nonce. It was quite a dark night, and at daybreak, the first thing that\r\nsaluted our eyes, was all the four ships at anchor, with springs upon\r\ntheir cables, and within musket shot of us. The Phoenix, lying a\r\nlittle quartering, and her stern toward me, I could read her name as\r\ndistinctly as though I had been directly under the stern--. As soon as\r\nit was fairly light, we saw their boats coming out of a creek or cove,\r\non the Long Island side of the water, filled with British soldiers.\r\nWhen they came to the edge of the tide, they formed their boats in\r\nline. They continued to augment these forces from the Island until\r\nthey appeared like a large clover field in full bloom.... We lay very\r\nquiet in our ditch, waiting their motions, till the sun was an hour or\r\ntwo high. We heard a cannonade at the city, but our attention was\r\ndrawn to our own guests. But they being a little dilatory in their\r\noperations, I stepped into an old warehouse which, stood close by me,\r\nwith the door open, inviting me in, and sat down upon a stool; the\r\nfloor was strewed with papers which had in some former period been\r\nused in the concerns of the house, but were then lying in woful\r\nconfusion. I was very demurely perusing these papers, when, all of a\r\nsudden, there came such a peal of thunder from the British shipping,\r\nthat I thought my head would go with the sound. I made a frog's leap\r\nfor the ditch, and lay as still as I possibly could, and began to\r\nconsider which part of my carcass was to go first. The British played\r\ntheir parts well; indeed, they had nothing to hinder them. We kept the\r\nlines till they were almost levelled upon us, when our officers seeing\r\nwe could make no resistance, and no orders coming from any superior\r\nofficer, and that we must soon be entirely exposed to the rake of the\r\nguns, gave the order to leave the lines. In retreating we had to cross\r\na level clear spot of ground, forty or fifty rods wide, exposed to the\r\nwhole of the enemy's fire; and they gave it to us in prime order; the\r\ngrape shot and langrage flew merrily, which served to quicken our\r\nmotions.... We had not gone far (in the highway) before we saw a party\r\nof men, apparently hurrying on in the same direction with ourselves;\r\nwe endeavored hard to overtake them, but on approaching them we found\r\nthat they were not of our way of thinking; they were Hessians. We\r\nimmediately altered our course and took the main road leading to\r\nKing's bridge. We had not long been on this road before we saw another\r\nparty, just ahead of us, whom we knew to be Americans; just as we\r\novertook these, they were fired upon by a party of British from a\r\ncorn-field, and all was immediately in confusion again. I believe the\r\nenemies' party was small; but our people were all militia, and the\r\ndemons of fear and disorder seemed to take full possession of all and\r\neverything on that day. When I came to the spot where the militia were\r\nfired upon the ground was literally covered with arms, knapsacks,\r\nstaves, coats, hats and old oil flasks, perhaps some of those from the\r\nMadeira town cellar in New York.... Several of the regiment were\r\nmissing among whom was our major; he was a fine man, and his loss was\r\nmuch regretted by the men of the regiment. We lay that night upon the\r\nground which the regiment occupied when I came up with it. The next\r\nday in the forenoon, the enemy, as we expected, followed us \"hard up\"\r\nand were advancing through a level field; our rangers and some few\r\nother light troops under the command of Col. Knowlton, of Connecticut\r\nand Major Leitch of (I, believe) Virginia, were in waiting for them.\r\nSeeing them advancing, the rangers, &c, concealed themselves in a deep\r\ngully overgrown with bushes; upon the western verge of this defile was\r\na post and rail fence, and over that the forementioned field. Our\r\npeople let the enemy advance until they arrived at the fence when they\r\narose and poured in a volley upon them. How many of the enemy were\r\nkilled & wounded could not be known, as the British were always as\r\ncareful as Indians to conceal their losses. There were, doubtless,\r\nsome killed, as I myself counted nineteen ball-holes through a single\r\nrail of the fence at which the enemy were standing when the action\r\nbegan. The British gave back and our people advanced into the field.\r\nThe action soon became warm. Col. Knowlton a brave man and commander\r\nof the detachment, fell in the early part of the engagement. It was\r\nsaid, by them who saw it, that he lost his valuable life by\r\nunadvisedly exposing himself singly to the enemy. In my boyhood I had\r\nbeen acquainted with him; he was a brave man and an excellent citizen.\r\nMajor Leitch fell soon after, and the troops who were then engaged,\r\nwere left with no higher commanders than their captains, but they\r\nstill kept the enemy retreating. Our regiment was now ordered into the\r\nfield, and we arrived on the ground just as the retreating army were\r\nentering a thick wood, a circumstance as disagreeable to them as it\r\nwas agreeable to us, at that period of the war. We soon came to action\r\nwith them. The troops engaged being reinforced by our regiment kept\r\nthem still retreating, until they found shelter under the cannon of\r\nsome of their shipping, lying in the North River. We remained on the\r\nbattle ground till nearly sunset, expecting the enemy to attack us\r\nagain, but they showed no such inclination that day. The men were very\r\nmuch fatigued and faint, having had nothing to eat for forty-eight\r\nhours--at least the greater part were in this condition & I among the\r\nrest.... We had eight or ten of our regt killed in the action & a\r\nnumber wounded, but none of them belonging to our company. Our Lt.\r\nCol. was hit by a grape-shot, which went through his coat, westcoat\r\nand shirt, to the skin on his shoulder, without doing any other damage\r\nthan cutting up his epaulette.\r\n\r\n     [_A Narrative of Some of the Adventures, Dangers and\r\n     Sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier, etc._ Hallowell, Me.\r\n     1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 28.]\r\n\r\nCAPT.

Sunday morning last, our\r\nregiment, with a number of other regiments, were ordered to the lines\r\na little below Turtle Bay, where lay five or six ships within musket\r\nshot of our lines. About six o'clock a most furious cannonade began\r\nfrom the ships. At the same time the enemy landed a large body of men\r\na little above where our men were posted, and marched directly for the\r\nmain road in order to cut off our retreat, which they had like to have\r\neffected, as the greatest part of our army were from six to fourteen\r\nmiles distant from the city. In this skirmish we lost some men though\r\nI think not many. I have been unwell about a fortnight, with a slow\r\nfever and the camp disorder, which prevented my being in the skirmish.\r\nI had not passed the enemy but a little while before the enemy came\r\nup; and if I had been with the regiment at the lines, I was so weak\r\nand feeble, I should without doubt have fallen into their hands. I\r\nhave now left the regiment for a few days, and am with brother\r\nChester, about sixteen miles from the city, getting better....\r\n\r\n     [Huntington Family Memoir, p. 164.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 29.]\r\n\r\nLIEUT.

YORK 3rd Sepr 1776.\r\n\r\nHOND SIR\r\n\r\nI have attempted to write to you several times since our Return from\r\nLong Island, but have been as often interrupted by the vast hurry of\r\nBusiness in which the General is engaged. He is obliged to see into,\r\nand in a Manner fill every Department, which is too much for one\r\nMan--Our Retreat [from Long Island] before an Enemy much superior in\r\nNumbers, over a wide River, and not very well furnished with Boats\r\ncertainly does Credit to our Generals. The thing was conducted with so\r\nmuch Secrecy that neither subalterns or privates knew that the whole\r\nArmy was to cross back again to N. York, they thought only a few\r\nRegiments were to go back. General Howe has not yet landed upon this\r\nIsland, but I imagine something of that kind is in Agitation, as the\r\nFleet drew nearer and nearer, they are now about long Cannon Shot from\r\nthe Battery, but no firing on either side. We shall be prepared to\r\nmeet them here or retreat over Kings Bridge as we shall find Occasion,\r\nour supernumerary and heavy stores are removed, we must leave our\r\nheavy Cannon behind us in Case of Retreat, but I dont know that that\r\nwill be any loss, as we never used them to much advantage....\r\n\r\nI am most dutifully & Affecty Yrs.\r\n  TENCH TILGHMAN.\r\n\r\nHEAD QUARTERS, HARLEM HEIGHTS, Monday, 16 Sepr. 1776.\r\n\r\nOur Army totally evacuated New York yesterday, the Enemy landed a\r\nparty of about 3000 from Appearance four miles above the City where\r\nthey encamped last Night. They kept up a very heavy fire from their\r\nShips while their Men were landing, altho' no Body opposed them, I\r\nimagine they did it, thinking we might have some men concealed behind\r\nsome lines on the Water side. We removed everything that was valuable,\r\nsome heavy cannon excepted, before we left the Town. Our army is\r\nposted as advantageously as possible for Security, out of reach of the\r\nFire of the Ships from either River; and upon high Grounds of\r\ndifficult Access. I dont know whether the New Engd Troops will\r\nstand there, but I am sure they will not upon open Ground. I had a\r\nSpecimen of that yesterday. Hear two Brigades ran away from a small\r\nadvanced party of the Regulars, tho' the General did all in his power\r\nto convince them they were in no danger. He laid his Cane over many of\r\nthe officers who shewed their men the example of running. These were\r\nmilitia, the New England Continental Troops are much better....\r\n\r\nHEAD QUARTERS COLO. MORRIS'S 19th Sepr. 1776.\r\n\r\n... On Monday last we had a pretty smart skirmish with the British\r\nTroops which was brought on in the following Manner. The General rode\r\ndown to our farthest Lines, and when he came near them heard a firing\r\nwhich he was informed was between our Scouts and the out Guards of the\r\nEnemy. When our men came in they informed the General that there were\r\na party of about 300 behind a woody hill, tho' they only showed a very\r\nsmall party to us. Upon this General laid a plan for attacking them in\r\nthe Rear and cutting off their Retreat which was to be effected in the\r\nfollowing Manner. Major Leitch with three companies of Colo.\r\nWeedons Virginia Regiment, and Colo Knowlton with his Rangers were\r\nto steal round while a party were to march towards them and seem as if\r\nthey intended to attack in front, but not to make any real Attack\r\ntill they saw our men fairly in their Rear. The Bait took as to one\r\npart, as soon as they saw our party in front the Enemy ran down the\r\nHill and took possession of some Fences and Bushes and began to fire\r\nat them, but at too great distance to do much execution: Unluckily\r\nColo. Knowlton and Major Leitch began their Attack too soon, it was\r\nrather in Flank than in Rear. The Action now grew warm, Major Leitch\r\nwas wounded early in the Engagement and Colo. Knowlton soon after,\r\nthe latter mortally, he was one of the bravest and best officers in\r\nthe Army. Their Men notwithstanding persisted with the greatest\r\nBravery. The Genl finding they wanted support ordered over part of\r\nColo. Griffiths's and part of Colo. Richardson's Maryland\r\nRegiments, these Troops tho' young charged with as much Bravery as I\r\ncan conceive, they gave two fires and then rushed right forward which\r\ndrove the enemy from the wood into a Buckwheat field, from whence they\r\nretreated. The General fearing (as we afterwards found) that a large\r\nBody was coming up to support them, sent me over to bring our Men off.\r\nThey gave a Hurra and left the Field in good Order. We had about 40\r\nwounded and a very few killed. A Serjeant who deserted says their\r\nAccounts were 89 wounded and 8 killed, but in the latter he is\r\nmistaken for we have buried more than double that Number--We find\r\ntheir force was much more considerable than we imagined when the\r\nGeneral ordered the Attack. It consisted of the 2d Battn. of\r\nlight Infantry, a Battn. of the Royal Highlanders and 3 Comps.\r\nof Hessian Rifle Men. The prisoners we took, told us, they expected\r\nour Men would have run away as they did the day before, but that they\r\nwere never more surprised than to see us advancing to attack them. The\r\nVirginia and Maryland Troops bear the Palm. They are well officered\r\nand behave with as much regularity as possible, while the Eastern\r\npeople are plundering everything that comes in their way. An Ensign is\r\nto be tried for marauding to-day, the Genl. will execute him if he\r\ncan get a Court Martial to convict him--I like our post here\r\nexceedingly, I think if we give it up it is our own faults. You must\r\nexcuse me to my other friends for not writing to them. I can hardly\r\nfind time to give you a Line.\r\n\r\n     [Memoir of Lieut. Col. Tench Tilghman. J.

Colo Crary of the Regmt I belong to\r\n[Varnum's, R.I.] were ordered out if possible to dispossess them, in\r\nabout 20 minutes the Engagement began with as terrible a fire as ever\r\nI heard, when Orders came for the whole Brigade immediately to march\r\nto support the first detachment, the Brigade consisted of abt 900\r\nmen, we immediately formed in front of the Enemy and march'd up in\r\ngood order through their fire, which was incessant till within 70\r\nyards, when we engaged them in that situation, we engaged them for one\r\nhour and eights minits, when the Enemy Broke & Ran we pursued them to\r\nthe next hights, when we were ordered to Retreat. Our loss does not\r\nexceed in killed and wounded twenty five men, the loss of the Enemy\r\nwas very considerable but cannot be ascertained, as we observed them\r\nto carry of their dead and wounded the whole time of the Engagement,\r\nthey left a Number of killed and wounded on the Field of Battle & a\r\ngreat number of Small Armes, the great Superiority of Numbers and\r\nevery other advantage the enemy had, when considered makes the Victory\r\nGlorious, and tho' but over a part of their Army yet the consequences\r\nof it are attended with advantages very great, as they immediately\r\nquitted the hights all round us and have not been troublesome since,\r\nour people behaved with the greatest Spirit, and the New England men\r\nhave gained the first Lawrells. I received a slight wound in the\r\nAnckle at the first of the Engagement but never quited the field\r\nduring the Engagement. I'm now Ready to give them the second part\r\nwhenever they have an appetite, as I'm convinced whenever [they] stir\r\nfrom their ships we shall drubb them.\r\n\r\n     [N.E. Hist. and Gen. Register, vol. xxx.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 31.]\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE RETREAT FROM NEW YORK AND AFFAIR OF HARLEM HEIGHTS, BY\r\nCOLONEL DAVID HUMPHREY\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 15th, the British, after sending three ships of war\r\nup the North River, to Bloomingdale, and keeping up, for some hours, a\r\nsevere cannonade on our lines, from those already in the East river,\r\nlanded in force at Turtle bay. Our new levies, commanded by a state\r\nbrigadier-general, fled without making resistance. Two brigades of\r\nGeneral Putnam's division, ordered to their support, notwithstanding\r\nthe exertion of their brigadiers, and of the commander-in-chief\r\nhimself, who came up at the instant, conducted themselves in the same\r\nshameful manner. His excellency then ordered the heights of Harlaem, a\r\nstrong position, to be occupied. Thither the forces in the vicinity,\r\nas well as the fugitives, repaired. In the mean time, General Putnam,\r\nwith the remainder of his command, and the ordinary outposts, was in\r\nthe city. After having caused the brigades to begin their retreat by\r\nthe route of Bloomingdale, in order to avoid the enemy, who were then\r\nin possession of the main road leading to Kingsbridge, he galloped to\r\ncall off the pickets and guards. Having myself been a volunteer in his\r\ndivision, and acting adjutant to the last regiment that left the city,\r\nI had frequent opportunities, that day, of beholding him, for the\r\npurpose of issuing orders, and encouraging the troops, flying, on his\r\nhorse, covered with foam, wherever his presence was most necessary.\r\nWithout his extraordinary exertions, the guards must have been\r\ninevitably lost, and it is probable the entire corps would have been\r\ncut in pieces. When we were not far from Bloomingdale, an aide-de-camp\r\ncame from him at full speed, to inform that a column of British\r\ninfantry was descending upon our right. Our rear was soon fired upon,\r\nand the colonel of our regiment, whose order was just communicated for\r\nthe front to file off to the left, was killed on the spot. With no\r\nother loss we joined the army, after dark, on the heights of\r\nHarlaem.--Before our brigades came in, we were given up for lost by\r\nall our friends. So critical indeed was our situation, and so narrow\r\nthe gap by which we escaped, that the instant we had passed, the enemy\r\nclosed it by extending their line from river to river. Our men, who\r\nhad been fifteen hours under arms, harassed by marching and\r\ncounter-marching, in consequence of incessant alarms, exhausted as\r\nthey were by heat and thirst, (for the day proved insupportably hot,\r\nand few or none had canteens, insomuch, that some died at the works\r\nwhere they drank,) if attacked, could have made but feeble\r\nresistance....\r\n\r\nThat night our soldiers, excessively fatigued by the sultry march of\r\nthe day, their clothes wet by a severe shower of rain that succeeded\r\ntowards the evening, their blood chilled by the cold wind that\r\nproduced a sudden change in the temperature of the air, and their\r\nhearts sunk within them by the loss of baggage, artillery, and works\r\nin which they had been taught to put great confidence, lay upon their\r\narms, covered only by the clouds of an uncomfortable sky.... Next\r\nmorning several parties of the enemy appeared upon the plains in our\r\nfront. On receiving this intelligence, General Washington rode quickly\r\nto the outposts, for the purpose of preparing against an attack, if\r\nthe enemy should advance with that design. Lieutenant-colonel\r\nKnowlton's rangers, a fine selection from the eastern regiments, who\r\nhad been skirmishing with an advanced party, came in, and informed the\r\ngeneral that a body of British were under cover of a small eminence at\r\nno considerable distance. His excellency, willing to raise our men\r\nfrom their dejection by the splendor of some little success, ordered\r\nLieutenant-colonel Knowlton, with his rangers, and Major Leitch, with\r\nthree companies of Weedon's regiment of Virginians, to gain their\r\nrear; while appearances should be made of an attack in front. As soon\r\nas the enemy saw the party sent to decoy them, they ran precipitately\r\ndown the hill, took possession of some fences and bushes, and\r\ncommenced a brisk firing at long shot. Unfortunately, Knowlton and\r\nLeitch made their onset rather in flank than in rear. The enemy\r\nchanged their front, and the skirmish at once became close and warm.\r\nMajor Leitch having received three balls through his side, was soon\r\nborne from the field; and Colonel Knowlton, who had distinguished\r\nhimself so gallantly at the battle of Bunkerhill, was mortally wounded\r\nimmediately after. Their men, however, undaunted by these disasters,\r\nstimulated with the thirst of revenge for the loss of their leaders,\r\nand conscious of acting under the eye of the commander-in-chief,\r\nmaintained the conflict with uncommon spirit and perseverance. But the\r\ngeneral, seeing them in need of support, advanced part of the Maryland\r\nregiments of Griffith and Richardson, together with some detachments\r\nfrom such eastern corps as chanced to be most contiguous to the place\r\nof action. Our troops this day, without exception, behaved with the\r\ngreatest intrepidity. So bravely did they repulse the British, that\r\nSir William Howe moved his _reserve_, with two field-pieces, a\r\nbattalion of Hessian grenadiers, and a company of chasseurs, to succor\r\nhis retreating troops. General Washington not willing to draw on a\r\ngeneral action, declined pressing the pursuit. In this engagement were\r\nthe second and third battalions of light infantry, the forty-second\r\nBritish regiment, and the German Chasseurs, of whom eight officers,\r\nand upward of seventy privates were wounded, and our people buried\r\nnearly twenty, who were left dead on the field. We had about forty\r\nwounded; our loss in killed, except of two valuable officers, was very\r\ninconsiderable. An advantage so trivial in itself produced, in event,\r\na surprising and almost incredible effect upon the whole army. Amongst\r\nthe troops not engaged, who, during the action, were throwing earth\r\nfrom the new trenches, with an alacrity that indicated a determination\r\nto defend them, every visage was seen to brighten, and to assume,\r\ninstead of the gloom of despair, the glow of animation. This change,\r\nno less sudden than happy, left little room to doubt that the men, who\r\nran the day before at the sight of an enemy, would now, to wipe away\r\nthe stain of that disgrace, and to recover the confidence of their\r\ngeneral, have conducted themselves in a very different manner.\r\n\r\n     [Life of General Putnam, by Colonel Humphrey.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 32.]\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY AT A COURT OF INQUIRY RESPECTING THE RETREAT FROM NEW\r\nYORK[238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Col. Tyler, commanding the 10th Regiment of\r\nContinentals (from Connecticut) was ordered under arrest by General\r\nWashington for \"cowardice and misbehaviour before the enemy on Sunday,\r\nthe 15th instant.\" The testimony at the preliminary trial brought\r\nout some of the incidents of that day's confusion and panic.]\r\n\r\n... Brigadier General _Parsons_: Says on the 15th, he ordered three\r\nregiments of his brigade, viz: _Prescott's_, _Tyler's_, and\r\n_Huntington's_, to march from the lines near Corlear's Hook to assist\r\nthe troops in the middle division under General _Spencer_, where the\r\nenemy were attempting to land; that he soon rode on after these\r\nregiments by General Putnam's order, and found them in the main road;\r\nasked the reason why they were not near the river where the enemy were\r\nlanding, as he then supposed; was told by the officers that the\r\nenemy's boats were gone farther eastward, and probably would land at\r\nor near _Turtle's Bay_, on which they pursued their march on the road\r\nto the barrier across the street; he, the examinant, being then near\r\nthe rear of the three regiments, observed the front to advance on the\r\nroad called _Bloomingdale_ road, instead of going in the post-road; on\r\nwhich he rode forward to the front of the brigade, in order to march\r\nthem into the other road, when he found Colonel Tyler with his\r\nregiment, and was there informed they marched that way by order of\r\nGenerals _Putnam_ and _Spencer_, who were just forward; this examinant\r\nthen rode forward on that road some little distance, perhaps sixty or\r\neighty rods, to a road which turned off eastward to the post road, and\r\nfound General _Fellows'_ brigade in that cross road, marching\r\neastward, and also saw Generals _Washington_, _Putnam_, and others, at\r\nthe top of the hill eastward, and rode up to them; General\r\n_Washington_ directed that the examinant should attend to keep his\r\nbrigade in order and march on into the cross road; he accordingly rode\r\nback and met the brigade as they came into the cross road; as he was\r\nriding back he saw Colonel Tyler in a lot on the south side the cross\r\nroad coming from the _Bloomingdale_ road to the cross road and asked\r\nhim why he was not with the regiment; he said he was very much\r\nfatigued, it being very hot, and was going across the lot to join the\r\nregiment, it being nearer than to keep the road; this examinant then\r\nrode by the side of the brigade to near the top of the hill, his\r\nattention being to keep the brigade in order, and then heard General\r\n_Washington_ call out, \"Take the walls!\" and immediately added, \"Take\r\nthe corn-field!\" a corn-field being then on the right adjoining east\r\non the main road, and north on the cross road; immediately from front\r\nto rear of the brigade the men ran to the walls, and some into the\r\ncorn-field, in a most confused and disordered manner; this examinant\r\nthen used his utmost endeavour to form the brigade into some order\r\nupon that ground, but the men were so dispersed he found it\r\nimpossible; he then rode back into the _Bloomingdale_ road and there\r\nfound a considerable part of the brigade but in no order; General\r\n_Washington_ was then forward in the _Bloomingdale_ road, and sent for\r\nthis examinant, and gave order to form the brigade as soon as could be\r\ndone, and march on to _Harlem Heights_; as soon as the brigade could\r\nbe reduced to any form, they marched on to _Harlem Heights_; when they\r\nhad proceeded about a mile or two, a sudden panick seized the rear of\r\nthe brigade; they ran into the fields out of the road; the reason he\r\nknows not; in the fields he saw Colonel Tyler, which was the first\r\ntime he recollects to have seen the colonel after the time he saw him\r\ncrossing the lot to the front of his regiment....\r\n\r\nEnsign _Wait_: Says that he was in the rear of the first company of\r\nColonel _Tyler's_ regiment; that after the brigade had crossed over\r\nfrom the _Bloomingdale_ road towards the post road, where they met the\r\nenemy, he saw Colonel _Tyler_ at the head of the brigade; that when\r\norders were given to man the stone wall, he saw the Colonel at the\r\nhead of the regiment, who marched up to the fence and presented his\r\npiece, and supposes that he fired; that after that he understood that\r\norders were given to go into the corn-field, that after they had got\r\ninto the corn-field, and a principal part of the brigade were\r\nretreating, the examinant heard Colonel _Tyler_ say to the men, \"Why\r\ndo you run? this will never beat them;\" that at that time he supposes\r\nthe Colonel was nearly in the same place where he was when the fire\r\nfirst began, and that from his behaviour, he has no reason to believe\r\nthat the Colonel was at all intimidated; that from the situation the\r\nColonel was in at the time of the firing, he has reason to believe\r\nthat the Colonel was one of the last that retreated from the enemy;\r\nthat the first time he noticed the Colonel after the retreat from the\r\nenemy, was when they had marched about a mile from the cross road up\r\nthe _Bloomingdale_ road, where they got into some order, and that\r\nafter that the Colonel continued in the front till the brigade reached\r\nthe Heights of _Harlem_....\r\n\r\nPaymaster _Sill_: Says that he had no opportunity of observing Colonel\r\n_Tyler's_ conduct from the time that they crossed over from the\r\n_Bloomingdale_ road towards the post road, and had returned back to\r\nthe _Bloomingdale_ road and marched up it one mile; that when the\r\nbrigade had marched up that far, there was a cry from the rear that\r\nthe Light-Horse were advancing, and that a great part of the battalion\r\nwhich Colonel _Tyler_ commanded precipitately threw themselves into\r\nthe lot on the west side of the road; that the Colonel went into the\r\nlot and this examinant with him; that from the Colonel's conduct at\r\nthis juncture, it appeared to this examinant that his design in going\r\ninto the lot was to bring back the men to the brigade, for that in his\r\npresence and hearing the Colonel threatened to fire upon them if they\r\ndid not join the brigade.\r\n\r\nSergeant _Palmer_: Says that when the brigade crossed over from the\r\n_Bloomingdale_ road towards the post road, he was on the right of the\r\nfront rank of the brigade which was led by Colonel _Tyler_, and that\r\nhe had a full opportunity of observing the Colonel's conduct till the\r\ntime of the retreat; that on notice that the enemy were approaching\r\nand orders given to take the wall, the Colonel advanced to it, still\r\nkeeping in the front, and was the first man in the brigade who fired;\r\nthat this examinant discharged his piece twice at the enemy, and on\r\nlooking around he saw the whole brigade were retreating, the Colonel\r\nstill remaining on the ground, with this examinant, and no person\r\nwithin several rods of them; that upon this the Colonel ordered them\r\nto stop, and asked them why they run and commanded the officers to\r\nstop them; that this not being effected, the Colonel and he retreated,\r\nthe two last men of the brigade, the Colonel along the cross road as\r\nfar as he remained in sight, and this examinant along the corn-field;\r\nthat when this examinant joined the brigade in the _Bloomingdale_\r\nroad, he saw the Colonel at the head of it; that when the cry was\r\nraised that the Light-Horse were advancing, which occasioned a great\r\npart of the battalion in front to betake themselves to the lot on the\r\nwest side of the road, he heard the Colonel order them back.\r\n\r\nCorporals _Brewster_ and _Chapman_: Confirm what Sergeant _Palmer_\r\nsaid, that the Colonel was the last man that retreated from the enemy,\r\nand that they saw the Colonel, after having marched some distance on\r\nthe cross road, strike off to the right, with intent, as they\r\nconceived, to get to the head of the regiment.\r\n\r\nI do hereby certify that the whole Court were of opinion that there is\r\nnot sufficient evidence to warrant the charge of cowardice and\r\nmisbehaviour against Colonel Tyler; and that this report would have\r\nbeen made immediately on taking the examinations, had not the Court\r\napprehended that, the Colonel, having been put under arrest by express\r\norder from Head Quarters, some evidence against him might have been\r\npointed out from thence.\r\n\r\nCAMP AT WHITE-PLAINS, October 26, 1776.\r\n  JOHN MORIN SCOTT, Brigadier-General,\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n     [Force's Archives, Fifth Series, vol. ii. p. 1251.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 33.]\r\n\r\nMAJOR BAURMEISTER'S NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTURE OF NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER,\r\n1776[239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Maj. C.L. Baurmeister, of the Hessian Division.]\r\n\r\nIN CAMP AT HELEGATTE, September 24, 1776.\r\n\r\nI had the honor on the 2d inst., of dispatching to Captain von\r\nWangenheim a complete relation, to date, of our doings here with the\r\ncondition, that he should send an exact copy of it to you, mentioning\r\nthat the continuation would be forwarded to you, with a similar\r\nrequest to communicate it to Captain von Wangenheim.... I announced\r\ntherefore, that the army camped from New Thown to Blockwels\r\n[_Blackwell's_] peninsula, only the brigade of Major-General Grand\r\nremained under the orders of General von Heister at Belfort\r\n[_Bedford_] opposite New York, with the two Hessian brigades of\r\nMajor-Generals Stirn and von Mirbach, together with Captain Bitter's\r\nEnglish artillery brigade, which were posted behind the hostile works,\r\nin order to keep the rebels within bounds, in the city as well as in\r\ntheir redoubts thrown up on the side of the city, for which end 1\r\nCaptain and 100 men, towards noon on the 2nd. of September, were\r\nobliged to occupy Gouverneurs Island, upon which were found 10 iron\r\ncannons spiked, 4 18- and 6 32-pounders, many unfilled bombs, some\r\nthousand bullets, flour and salt meat in barrels. Every 24 hours this\r\npost was relieved by the pickets of the English and Hessian regiments;\r\nthe shore was occupied from Helgatte to Reed-Hurck. Before Helgatte 2\r\nfrigates lay at anchor: la Brüne and Niger, both of 32 guns, with a\r\nbombarding vessel, and on terra firma, just to the left side of these\r\nvessels, a battery was erected of 2 24-pounders, 4 12-pounders and 2\r\nhowitzers. Blockwell Island was occupied by 1 Captain and 100 men of\r\nthe English infantry, and in the night of the 3d. of September the\r\nfrigate Rose of 32 guns sailed out of the fleet up the East River,\r\nwith 30 boats, leaving New York on the left, and without the slightest\r\ndifficulty anchored in Whall Bay [Wallabout] and Buschwickfeste. All\r\nthe enemy's cannon were put into a serviceable condition and conveyed\r\nto the batteries, which were found in part and also erected on the\r\nrising ground to the left of the village ferry as far as to\r\nGouverneurs Island.... Often in the night rebels came over to the\r\nEnglish camp in small boats, asked to serve, and enlisted in the newly\r\nraised brigade, 2000 men strong, of a Colonel de Lancy, whose\r\nancestors settled on York Island, and who had much to suffer from the\r\npresent rebels. Some 100 men, from the prisoners of the attack of\r\nAugust 27th., are also enrolled in this brigade. On the 4th. of\r\nSeptember, the English left their post on Blockwells Island, the\r\nrebels occupied it in force, and so strong, that the outposts on the\r\nmain shore were exposed to a continuous fire, which even the great\r\nbattery could not silence. The 5th. of September, 5 wagons and the\r\nrequisite draught horses were furnished to every regiment, in New\r\nThown also a forage magazine was erected, and the inhabitants of Long\r\nIsland recognized the royal authority, excepting the county of\r\nSuffolck, in which several thousand rebels still remain, not collected\r\ntogether but scattered, ready to fight against us everywhere on the\r\nfirst opportunity; why now Brigadier General Erkskine with his strong\r\ndetachment advanced no farther than 9 English miles beyond Jamaika and\r\nthe 6th of September was obliged to return is not to be divined; it\r\nwas then, that this best part of Long Island should have been kept for\r\nthe winter-quarters, for till now wherever the army has been the\r\ncountry is stripped of provisions, cattle and horses, as everything is\r\ndeclared rebel property; there is no longer an English regiment to be\r\nfound incomplete in horses, and this want will soon no longer appear\r\nin the Hessian regiments, as many officers obtain the horses they need\r\nfor little money and even for nothing. I myself have 3 in this way.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of the inhabitants, whose ancestors were all Dutch, must\r\nhave been great; genuine kindness and real abundance is everywhere,\r\nanything worthless or going to ruin is nowhere to be perceived. The\r\ninhabited regions resemble the Westphalian peasant districts, upon\r\nseparate farms the finest houses are built, which are planned and\r\ncompleted in the most elegant fashion. The furniture in them is in the\r\nbest taste, nothing like which is to be seen with us, and besides so\r\nclean and neat, that altogether it surpasses every description.\r\n\r\nThe female sex is universally beautiful and delicately reared, and is\r\nfinely dressed in the latest European fashion, particularly in India\r\nlaces, white cotton and silk gauzes; not one of these women but would\r\nconsider driving a double team the easiest of work. They drive and\r\nride out alone, having only a negro riding behind to accompany them.\r\nNear every dwelling-house negroes (their slaves) are settled, who\r\ncultivate the most fertile land, pasture the cattle, and do all the\r\nmenial work. They are Christians and are brought on the coasts of\r\nGuinea, being sold again here among the inhabitants for 50 to 120 York\r\npounds a head; 20 York shillings are such a pound and 37 York\r\nshillings make the value of a guinea.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the fleet was stationed between Reed Huck and Governeurs\r\nIsland nearer to New York, and the baggage of the Hessian corps,\r\nremaining for the chief part on board was loaded upon one transport\r\nfor the greater convenience of each regiment, whereby there was a\r\ngreat relief from the repeated sending, frequently in vain for want of\r\nboats. The Brocklands-Leinen was to be demolished, but on the\r\nrepresentation of General von Heister, that this could not be done by\r\nsoldiers without compensation, especially as it would be the work of\r\nfour weeks, General Howe recalled this order....\r\n\r\nMany subjects are returning to the legitimate authority, and on Long\r\nIsland the villages of Grevesand, New Utrecht, Flattbusch, Brockland\r\nand Ferry are filled with the fugitive settlers, most of whom however\r\nfind their dwellings empty, furniture smashed, not a window left whole\r\nand their cattle gone forever....\r\n\r\nI am to present the compliments of General von Heister. Colonel George\r\nOrboune, our Muster-Commissioner has already reviewed us. Major-Gen.\r\nMirbach has had an attack of apoplexy, but he expects to recover; but\r\nMajor-General Stirn and Col. von Hering are more sick.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest respect\r\n  (Signed) BAURMEISTER.\r\n\r\nIN THE DETACHED CAMP, AT HELGATTE, Sept. 24, 1776.\r\n\r\n     [Magazine of American History, N.Y., January, 1877.

The Enemy have not altered their situations much since you left\r\nus. Not long since Genl Putnam with a party of 16 or 1800 men as\r\ncovering party went on to Harlem plains & with a number of waggons\r\nbrought off a large quantity of Grain, but not the whole, for just at\r\nDay break the Enemy had manned their lines & were seen in collumn\r\nadvancing: as our party were not more than half theirs it was thought\r\nbest to retreat which was done in good order & without a skirmish. We\r\nare daily fetching off large quantities of Hay & Grain from Morrisania\r\nas we are daily in expectation of Landing & an attack there, though we\r\nare determined not to leave the Ground without disputing it Inch by\r\nInch. Whilst you was here there was a frigate opposite the Wido\r\nMorris's House. Since that there has another come through & anchored\r\njust above Hell Gate opposite Harlem Church almost. Another has moved\r\nup East of Morrisania a mile or two near Frogs point where if they\r\nland they will probably march up through West Chester & come upon us\r\nby Williams's Tavern.\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Rev.

JOHN GLOVER TO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\nMARBLEHEAD, MASS.\r\n\r\nFORT CONSTITUTION, }\r\n     Oct. 7: 1776. }\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER:\r\n\r\n... On the 23d (Sept.) a detachment from several Corps commanded by\r\nLieut. Col. Jackson, consisting of 240 men were sent off to dislodge\r\nthe enemy from Montressor's (Ward's) Island, for which purpose six\r\nboats were provided to carry 40 men each. Col. Jackson led, Major\r\nHendly, of Charlestown with him. They were met by the enemy at the\r\nwater's edge before they landed, who gave them a heavy fire.\r\nNotwithstanding this the Col. landed with the party in his boat, gave\r\nthem battle and compelled them to retreat, called to the other boats\r\nto push and land, but the scoundrels, coward-like, retreated back and\r\nleft him and his party to fall a sacrifice. The enemy seeing this, 150\r\nof them rushed out of the woods and attacked them again at 30 yards\r\ndistance. Jackson with his little party nobly defended the ground\r\nuntil every man but eight was killed on the spot, and himself wounded,\r\nbefore he ordered a retreat. Major Hendly carrying off Col. Jackson\r\nwas shot dead as he was putting him into a boat, and not a single man\r\nof the 8 but what was wounded. One of them died at the oar before they\r\nlanded on the Main. The officers who commanded the other boats are all\r\nunder arrest and will be tried for their lives. In short if some\r\nexample is not made of such rascally conduct, there will be no\r\nencouragement for men of spirit to exert themselves. As the case now\r\nis they will always fall a sacrifice, while such low-lived scoundrels,\r\nthat have neither Honour nor the Good of their Country at heart, will\r\nskulk behind and get off clear.\r\n\r\nYours &c\r\n  JOHN GLOVER.\r\n\r\n     [Collections of the Essex, Mass., Institute, vol. v.

The\r\nmisfortune of losing Fort Washington, with between two and three\r\nthousand men, will reach you before this, if it has not already. His\r\nExcellency General Washington has been with me for several days. The\r\nevacuation or reinforcement of Fort Washington was under\r\nconsideration, but finally nothing concluded on. Day before yesterday,\r\nabout one o'clock, Howe's adjutant-general made a demand of the\r\nsurrender of the garrison in the general's name, but was answered by\r\nthe commanding officer that he should defend it to the last extremity.\r\nYesterday morning, General Washington, General Putnam, General Mercer,\r\nand myself, went to the island to determine what was best to be done;\r\nbut just at the instant we stepped on board the boat the enemy made\r\ntheir appearance on the hill where the Monday action was, and began a\r\nsevere cannonade with several field-pieces. Our guards soon fled, the\r\nenemy advanced up to the second line. This was done while we were\r\ncrossing the river and getting upon the hill. The enemy made several\r\nmarches to the right and to the left,--I suppose to reconnoitre the\r\nfortifications and the lines. There we all stood in a very awkward\r\nsituation. As the disposition was made, and the enemy advancing, we\r\ndurst not attempt to make any new disposition; indeed, we saw nothing\r\namiss. We all urged his Excellency to come off. I offered to stay.\r\nGeneral Putnam did the same, and so did General Mercer; but his\r\nExcellency thought it best for us all to come off together, which we\r\ndid, about half an hour before the enemy surrounded the fort. The\r\nenemy came up Harlem River, and landed a party at head-quarters, which\r\nwas upon the back of our people in the lines. A disorderly retreat\r\nsoon took place; without much firing the people retreated into the\r\nfort. On the north side of the fort there was a very heavy fire for a\r\nlong while; and as they had the advantage of the ground, I apprehend\r\nthe enemy's loss must be great. After the troops retreated in the\r\nfort, very few guns were fired. The enemy approached within small-arm\r\nfire of the lines, and sent in a flag, and the garrison capitulated in\r\nan hour. I was afraid of the fort; the redoubt you and I advised, too,\r\nwas not done, or little or nothing done to it. Had that been complete,\r\nI think the garrison might have defended themselves a long while, or\r\nbeen brought off. I feel mad, vexed, sick, and sorry. Never did I need\r\nthe consoling voice of a friend more than now. Happy should I be to\r\nsee you. This is a most terrible event: its consequences are justly to\r\nbe dreaded. Pray, what is said upon the occasion? A line from you will\r\nbe very acceptable.\r\n\r\nI am, dear sir, your obedient servant,\r\n  N. GREENE.\r\n\r\nNo particulars of the action as yet has come to my knowledge. [Mem. on\r\nthe back.] I have not time to give you a description of the battle.\r\n\r\n     [Life and Correspondence of Henry Knox, Maj. Gen., &c. By\r\n     Francis S.

SHEWKIRK, PASTOR OF THE MORAVIAN CHURCH, NEW\r\nYORK[240]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: A part of this diary was published in the _Moravian_,\r\nBethlehem, Penn., in 1876, with notes prepared by Rev. A.A. Reinke,\r\npresent pastor of the Moravian congregation in New York. The extracts\r\nfor 1775 appear in print now for the first time, and, of the whole,\r\nonly those which bear upon public affairs are given here. In 1776, the\r\nMoravian Church stood in Fair street (now Fulton), opposite the old\r\nNorth Dutch Church on the corner of William street.]\r\n\r\n1775.\r\n\r\n_Sunday April 23rd._--In Town were many Commotions tho' it was Sunday,\r\non account of various Reports, especially from Boston, that\r\nHostilities had been begun between the King's Troops and the\r\nProvincials.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 27th._ Late in the evening, Br. & Sr. Van Vleck arrived from\r\nBethlehem; but finding the Town in such Commotions, he did not think\r\nit proper to stay for the present, apprehending that he might be\r\ncalled upon to be a Member of the Committee, &c.; and therefore went\r\nthe following Evening to Jacobsen's at Staten Island.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 29th._--This whole week, ever since last Sunday all was\r\nalarmed in the City; there was nothing but Co[=m]otion & Confusion.\r\nTrade & publick business was at a stand;--soldiers were enlisted; the\r\nPort was stopt, and the Inhabitants seized the Keys of the Custom\r\nHouse; took the Arms & Powder into their Custody, not trusting the\r\nCorporation, &c. A Panic & Fear seized the People; many were for\r\nmoving into the Country, & several did. The case was the same with\r\nsome of our People, & especially the Sisters;--we comforted &\r\nencouraged them as well as we could. To-day matters as to the Town\r\ntook a Turn; the Divisions & Animosities among one another ceased;\r\nfrom whence the most was to be feared at present;--they all in general\r\nagreed to stand by one another, & use moderate measures; & since then\r\nit is grown more quiet; & not so many fearful reports are spread.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 30th._ This afternoon some of the new England Provincials came\r\nto Town.\r\n\r\n_Friday May 26th._--Being informed this Ev'ning that the Provincial\r\nCongress which has begun in this City, had made out that all those\r\nMinisters that preach in English are by Turns to open each day the\r\nCongress's Consultations with Prayers, some further Inquiry was made\r\ninto this Matter, & we understood,\r\n\r\n_Saturday 27th_ that the Matter is not so general as it is thought, &\r\nthat if it should be offer'd one may excuse one's self.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday June 6th._--There was again a Hurry in the Town on account of\r\nthe King's Soldiers being taken on Board of the Man of War. But we\r\nremained in Peace.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 25th._--In the Town it was very noisy; for our Governor,\r\nWm. Tryon was expected to come in on his return from England; and\r\nat the same time General Washington of the Provincials, who has been\r\nappointed Chief Co[=m]ander of all the Troops by the Continental\r\nCongress. They would show some regard to the Governor too, but the\r\nchief attention was paid to Gen. Washington. At one Church the\r\nMinister was obliged to give over; for the People went out, when the\r\nGeneral came, who was received with much ado. The Governor came on\r\nshore late in the Ev'ning.\r\n\r\n_Thursday August 24th._--Last night was a great Disturbance in the\r\nCity. About Mid-night some of the Town Soldiers began to take away the\r\nCa[=n]ons from the Battery. The Asia Man of War watched their motion;\r\nthe Captain Vandeput who is an humain Man & has no Intention to hurt\r\nthe Town, but must protect the King's Property, fired a couple of guns\r\nabout 12 o'clock;--his Barge & the Town People fired upon one another;\r\non both sides some were wounded, & one of the Barge Men killed. The\r\nwhole city got up; all was in alarm; the Drums beating, & the soldiers\r\ngathering together. They got away 21 Ca[=n]ons; the Man of War fired a\r\nBroadside with balls, &c. Several houses were damaged. Many people\r\nflew from their houses, & among them Sr. Kilburn, who was but\r\nyesterday with her Effects, and many of Abr. V. Vlecks & his 2 little\r\nchildren, &c. come back to her own house. Thus things went on till\r\nMorning, & now the whole day thro' there is nothing but moving out of\r\nthe Town; & fearful Reports. Several of our People moved likewise Abm.\r\nV. Vleck's family & Kilburn moved to Jas. Cargyll's, & on fresh\r\nalarming news the next day, with Eliz. Vandeursen & Hil. Waldron to\r\nSecond River [New Jersey].\r\n\r\n_Friday 25th._--Things were the same in the Town as yesterday, &\r\nrather worse. A correspondence was carried on between the Capt. of the\r\nAsia, & the Mayor of the City, & thro' the latter with the Committee\r\nor Congress, to adjust matters. Gov. Tryon acted as Mediator. Some\r\nhot-headed Men seemed to insist on pursuing their rash measures, while\r\nothers, & rather the Majority, did not approve of it.\r\n\r\n_Monday 28th._--The Moving out of the Town continues, & the City looks\r\nin some Streets as if the Plague had been in it, so many Houses being\r\nshut up. Br. & Sr. Seuneffs, with their 7 children, moved to-day to\r\nPhiladelphia, for good & all.\r\n\r\nAnother measure in the Town, which takes place this Week, namely to\r\ndivide all Men between 16 & 50 years into Ward companies, caused\r\nTroubles, & was one reason why Seuneff made Haste to get away, tho' he\r\nwill doubtless meet with the same in Philad.\r\n\r\n_Monday Sept. 11th._--Last week & to-day several of the Inhabitants\r\ncame back again to Town; also some of our People.\r\n\r\n_Monday 18th._--The Town-Soldiers, or the Minute Men made a great\r\nParade to-day; marching with their Baggage & Provision, &c. It was\r\nthought they went on an Expedition, but it was only a Trial. They went\r\nbut 5 miles, & came back in the Ev'ning; they made not only for\r\nthemselves, but for the greatest Part of the Inhabitants an idle,\r\nnoisy, & exceedingly ill-spent Day; & they got, most of them, drunk;\r\nfought together where they had stopt; & when they came back to Town;\r\nso that many are now under the Doctor's & Surgeon's Hands. May the\r\nLord have Mercy on this poor City.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday Oct. 10th._--On account of an attempt which had been made to\r\ntake Blankets, Sheets, &c. out of the King's Store, the city was again\r\nin danger of being fired upon, & it caused new fear & alarm. However\r\nupon Consultations of the Co[=m]ittee or Congress & the Corporation,\r\nthe goods were carried back again, & this Storm blew over, tho' some\r\nill designed Persons were not pleased with it.\r\n\r\nOther accounts & Reports this Week made that several families move\r\nagain out of the Town; & it is observed that some of the Head-Men\r\nbegin to hang down their Heads, & many believe they will be ruin'd\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n_Monday 16th._--The Report that the Crown Officers, & also our\r\nGovernor here, will be taken up, & on which account Gov. Tryon had\r\nwrote a Letter to the Mayor, which appeared in print, caused new Alarm\r\nthis week.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 19th._--In the Afternoon a Captain[241] of the Rifle Men\r\nwho some time ago marched with his Company thro' Bethlehem, & now\r\ncoming from Cambridge near Boston died here, was interred in Trinity\r\nChurch-yard, with great Pomp, & military Honours. All the Companies,\r\nmany of the Clergy Men, & a great Concourse of the People attended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: Capt. Michael Cresap, of Maryland.]\r\n\r\n_Saturday 21st._--In the afternoon Br. & Sr. Henry Van Vleck all on\r\nsudden resolved to leave N. York & to return to Bethlehem, or at least\r\nfor the present to go to Brunswig. The Reason was because a Report was\r\nspread that a Transport with Troops had been cast away on the Jersey\r\nCoast; from whence it was concluded, & they thought to have sure\r\nIntelligence, that some Troops, with the Fleet from England, would be\r\nhere soon. They went this Ev'ning to Powl's Hook.\r\n\r\n1776.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 18th January._--Last night and to-day Troops came in from\r\nthe Jerseys; the troubles begin again.\r\n\r\n_Monday 29th._--The troubles in the town increased. Tenbroeks' moved\r\nto Second River on Wednesday. They would have gone on Tuesday, but the\r\nweather was too bad.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 4th February._--This afternoon Mr. Lee, a General of the New\r\nEnglish (New England) troops came to town; as also the \"Mercury,\" a\r\nman of war, with General Clinton. The men of war _here_ took a\r\nmerchant ship coming in, &c.; all which made many commotions in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n_Monday 5th._--Soldiers came to town both from Connecticut and the\r\nJerseys, and the whole aspect of things grew frightful, and increased\r\nso from day to day. The inhabitants began now to move away in a\r\nsurprising manner. The weather was very cold, and the rivers full of\r\nice, which proved a great obstruction to the People's moving. However,\r\nin the middle of the week it thawed fast, which seemed also to answer\r\nthe prevention of designs against the men of war, the execution of\r\nwhich might have proved very fatal to the city. One could not pass the\r\nstreets without feeling a great deal; and at last we were obliged to\r\nencourage it that our sisters and young People might retreat. At the\r\nend of the week about 40 of our People were Moved.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 11th._--This was a gloomy day. The carts went all the day with\r\nthe goods of the people that are moving; moreover, in the forenoon the\r\nSoldiers began to take away all the guns from the Battery and the\r\nFort, and continued till late. This caused an hourly expectation,\r\nespecially in the afternoon, that the men of war would fire; however\r\nthey did not. It did not at all look like a Sunday. In some churches\r\nthey had no service; in others hardly any People. In the forenoon we\r\nhad a discourse from behind the table, from the yesterday's\r\nwatch-word; \"I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment, lest\r\nany hurt it,\" &c. In the afternoon was preaching on Lamentations III.\r\n39-41: \"Wherefore doth a living man complain, &c. Let us search and\r\ntry our ways,\" &c. Both times we had more hearers than we expected.\r\n\r\n_Monday 12th._--His Majesty's ship, the \"Mercury,\" with Genl. Clinton,\r\nand the \"Transport\" with the soldiers left the harbour yesterday, to\r\nproceed on their voyage southward. The moving out of the town\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 17th._--The whole week those of our people who are yet in\r\ntown were visited. This morning the \"Phoenix\" went out of the\r\nharbor, down to the watering place and the hook. In the afternoon the\r\n\"Asia,\" the ship with the Governor and the two Prices, moved also out\r\nof the east river, and when she was opposite the White Hall she was\r\nfast upon a rock. All was in agitation in town; and it seemed there\r\nwas a thought of attacking her, &c.; but they dropt it; and with the\r\nhigh water the \"Asia\" got afloat and lies now in the bay below the\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 21st._--In the afternoon Sister Esther Pell came to town\r\nfrom Middle Town Point. The boat she came in, laden with wood, was\r\nstopped by the men of war, and was sent back; but the passengers were\r\nallowed to come to town.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 25th._--In the forenoon only a discourse was kept on the\r\nwatch-word of to-morrow. In the afternoon a sermon was preached on\r\nthe day's gospel. Several of the New England people were present. In\r\nthe town the work at the entrenchments continued, and some branches of\r\ntrade were likewise working. At night Sister Shewkirk came back from\r\nSecond River.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 13th March._--A packet from England arrived once again, and\r\nbrought an uncommon number of letters; but they came not on shore. The\r\npostmaster would not take them, for fear that they might be seized\r\nwithout the postage being paid. The people were not suffered to go on\r\nboard to fetch them; unless they took an oath to tell nothing that is\r\ndone in the city. A packet for Bethlehem, directed to Bro. Shewkirk,\r\nhad been sent from England along with the government despatches\r\npost-free, and was brought by Mr. Ross in the King's Service, who had\r\nbeen on board privately.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 7th April._--Easter. To-day and last night the commotions in\r\nthe city begin to be greater; attacks have been made on the little\r\nislands, and at the watering place.\r\n\r\n_Monday 8th._--Sister Kilburn who had got the officers, &c., out of\r\nher house, got it cleaned and in order again. Tho' these lodgers had\r\nbeen better than common soldiers, yet she found her house and premises\r\nmuch injured. Sister Hilah Waldron on the following days got likewise\r\nthe soldiers out of one of her houses, but she has suffered a great\r\ndeal more. Indeed it is beyond description, how these uncivilized,\r\nrude, and wild People, abuse the finest houses in the city.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 30th._--Sisters Kilburn and Hilah Waldron, and Sister Boelens\r\nhave got the soldiers out of their houses.\r\n\r\n_Friday 17th May._--This day had been appointed a day of fasting and\r\nprayer throughout the country; therefore we had preaching in the fore\r\nand afternoon. The Text, a.m., was from Joel ii. 12, 13, 14.\r\n\"Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your\r\nheart, and with fasting and with weeping, and with mourning; and rend\r\nyour hearts and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God;\r\nfor He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness,\r\nand repenteth Him of the evil. Who knoweth if He will return and\r\nrepent, and leave a blessing behind Him?\" The text, p.m., was from\r\nHosea xiv. 1-3: \"O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast\r\nfallen by thine iniquity,\" &c. Our Saviour gave grace, in this\r\ncritical juncture of affairs, to keep in the speaking to the subject\r\nof the text, and to avoid in the application what might be\r\nexceptionable. We had a pretty numerous auditory in the afternoon;\r\nalso some of the officers. All behaved with attention. To-day the news\r\ncame that the Provincials have raised the Siege of Quebec, with the\r\nloss of their artillery, baggage, and some hundreds of sick.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 13th June._--Here in town very unhappy and shocking scenes\r\nwere exhibited. On Munday night some men called Tories were carried\r\nand hauled about through the streets, with candles forced to be held\r\nby them, or pushed in their faces, and their heads burned; but on\r\nWednesday, in the open day, the scene was by far worse; several, and\r\namong them gentlemen, were carried on rails; some stripped naked and\r\ndreadfully abused. Some of the generals, and especially Pudnam and\r\ntheir forces, had enough to do to quell the riot, and make the mob\r\ndisperse.\r\n\r\n_Friday 14th._--A printed letter from the Continental Congress was\r\ndistributed, which gave intelligence that for certain, within ten\r\ndays, the fleet from Halifax would be here, and it was strongly\r\nrecommended to make all possible defence. In consequence of this, many\r\nmore troops came to town, and all was in alarm.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 18th._--To-day men were drafted out of the different Ward\r\nCompanies. This matter gave us some anxiousness. Our brethren could\r\nnot stand out, as times and circumstances are, and had none to apply\r\nto. One Alleviation is, that a man drafted may hire another man, if he\r\ncan get one. Of our people were only drafted Robt. Thomas and Abraham\r\nVan Vleck. The town is now pretty full again of the soldiers that are\r\ncome from Pennsylvania and other parts; and the moving of the\r\ninhabitants out of town continues.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 22d._--Yesterday and to-day the news came that the fleet was\r\narrived at the Hook, and the troops from Halifax; which caused new\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 30th._--Some of the inhabitants moved to-day out of town; the\r\nProvincial Soldiers were busy, and had no service; and in general\r\nthere is little attention paid to the Sunday. Our preachings were yet\r\ntolerably well attended. The to-day's Word was, \"The work of\r\nRighteousness shall be Peace, &c.\" At 5 was the Congregational\r\nMeeting, in which we called to mind that to-day we conclude the first\r\nhalf of this year; and how graciously our dear Lord has helped us\r\nthrough in the troubles of the country, that begun to increase much\r\nwith the beginning of the year, and have lasted more or less ever\r\nsince; and now, as they approach yet more seriously, the watch-word\r\nwith which we begin the next half year, is very comfortable, and was\r\nspoke upon: \"Thou shalt know that I am the Lord, for they shall not be\r\nashamed that wait for me.\" Our brethren and sisters parted as if there\r\nmight again be a scattering, and it proved so; for, the following week\r\nseveral more left again the town.\r\n\r\n_Monday 1st July._--The watch-word of the first day of this month was\r\nvery comfortable, and suitable to the time we are in. In the evening\r\nthe news came that the fleet, or part of it, had left the Hook, and\r\nwas coming nearer.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 2d._--This, and more so when towards noon the first ships\r\nappeared in sight this side the narrows,--put the whole town into\r\ncommotion. On the one hand every one that could was for packing up and\r\ngetting away; and on the other hand the country soldiers from the\r\nneighboring places came in from all sides; and _here_ the Ward\r\ncompanies were likewise warned out. Theodore Sypher's wife and child\r\ncame to our house, and staid with us this night; but the next day went\r\nto a house a couple of miles out of town. In the evening we had our\r\nusual meeting.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 3d._--Bro. Sleur who had brought his wife and daughter into\r\nthe country put several of his things into Bro. Henry Van Vleck's\r\nvault; we put also in some goods belonging to the house, &c. To-day we\r\nheard that the shop goods and clothes belonging to Sr. Hilah Waldron\r\nand sons, Henry Ten Broeck, Eliz. Van Deursen, Sr. Keed, Sr. Kilburn,\r\nAbr. Van Vleck, &c., to the amount of above £700, which went in a boat\r\nyesterday with several other people's goods were taken, with the\r\nboat, by a Man of War. Our people would not have sent their goods\r\nwith this boat, if they had not been encouraged by the people\r\nbelonging to the boat, whom they knew; and who repeatedly told that\r\nthey could not nor would they go _down_ the river, but go _up_ the\r\nNorth river, or put the goods down at or about Powl's Hook; and yet\r\nthey went straight down towards the fleet. There were also some\r\npassengers on board. From all circumstances it appeared plain that it\r\nwas done designedly.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 4th._--The fear that the fleet would come up to the town\r\nbegan to subside. It was heard that they had taken possession of\r\nStaten Island; and that they would hardly advance farther before the\r\nfleet from England arrives. The country soldiers of the neighboring\r\nplaces were sent back again; on the other hand more of the New England\r\ntroops came in.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 10th._--Sr. Hilah Waldron, who had applied to Washington to\r\nget a pass to Staten Island, but got none, went again to Second river,\r\nin order to go with Sr. Kilburn to Elizabethtown, to try whether they\r\ncould get one there; for the captain of the Man of War had told them\r\nthat he wished they would come for their goods.\r\n\r\n_Friday 12th._--A few more ships came in through the Narrows, and it\r\nwas reported that the great fleet from England began to arrive. In the\r\nafternoon about 3 o'clock there was unexpectedly a smart firing. Two\r\nMen of War, with some Tenders came up. They fired from all the\r\nbatteries, but did little execution. The wind and tide being in their\r\nfavor, the ships sailed fast up the North river, and soon were out of\r\nsight. When they came this side of Trinity Church, they began to fire\r\nsmartly. The balls and bullets went through several houses between\r\nhere and Greenwich. Six men were killed; either some or all by\r\nill-managing the cannons; though it is said that a couple were killed\r\nby the ship's firing; one man's leg was broke, &c. The six were put\r\nthis evening into one grave on the Bowling Green. The smoke of the\r\nfiring drew over our street like a cloud; and the air was filled with\r\nthe smell of the powder. This affair caused a great fright in the\r\ncity. Women, and children, and some with their bundles came from the\r\nlower parts, and walked to the Bowery, which was lined with people.\r\nMother Bosler had been brought down into their cellar. Phil.\r\nSypher's, with their child, which was sick, came again to our house.\r\nNot long after this affair was over, the fleet below fired a Salute,\r\nAdmiral Howe coming in from England. The Srs. Van Deursen and Reed\r\nwould fain have gone out of town this evening, but they could not\r\nbring it to bear.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 14th._--It was a wettish day, and it looked as if all was dead\r\nin the town. The English (Church of England) churches were shut up,\r\nand there was services in none, or few of the others; we had not many\r\nhearers either.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 16th._--Bro. Wilson who came to town last Friday,--for he\r\ncould be in peace no more at Second River, as the country people will\r\nhave the Yorkers to be in town,--asked for a pass to go over on\r\nbusiness; but they would give him none. This week they have begun to\r\nlet no man go out of the city. Last Sunday, a flag of truce brought a\r\nletter to Washington; but having not the title which they give him\r\nhere, it was not received. Yesterday a message was sent down from\r\nhere; to-day an answer came, (Geo. Washington, Eqr., &c., &c.,) but\r\nwas again returned on account of the direction.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 18th_, was the day appointed when Independence was to be\r\ndeclared in the City Hall here; which was done about noon; and the\r\nCoat of Arms of the King was burnt. An unpleasant and heavy feeling\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 20th._--About noon a General Adjutant from Lord Howe came,\r\nand had a short conversation with General Washington, in Kennedy's\r\nhouse. When he went away he said, it is reported, to Washington and\r\nthe others with him: \"Sir and gentlemen, let it be remembered that the\r\nKing has made the first overture for peace; if it be rejected, you\r\nmust stand by the consequences\" and thus--which seems to have been the\r\nmain errand--he departed. Much politeness passed on both sides.\r\n\r\n_Monday 22nd._--Our Bro. Wilson looking at the ferry, whither his\r\nnegro was come with some goods from Second River, was put under arrest\r\nby one Johnson, and treated very basely by him, on account of a charge\r\nlaid against him by one Gordon, at the Falls, about 12 miles from\r\nSecond River; that he and his son had spoken against the American\r\ncause; were dangerous persons; and had done much mischief to their\r\nneighborhood, &c. Bro. Wilson appeared before the Committee, the\r\nchairman knew nothing of the charge. Wilmot, one of the Committee did,\r\nbut they could prove nothing; and Wilson could easily clear himself.\r\nThe result was,--if he resided at Second River, they thought he should\r\nstay there. Many persons were ordered to-day to quit the town, because\r\nthey were suspected.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 23d._--Bro. Wilson got a pass, and went to Second River\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n_Monday 29th._--Bro. Wilson came from Second River; he had got a\r\ncertificate of the Committee there, which cleared him sufficiently of\r\nthe late charge; and the Committee here gave him a pass to go to\r\nPennsylvania. He brought letters from Bethlehem, where he intends to\r\ngo this week; and returned to Second River this afternoon. He also\r\nbrought word that our people have got their goods that were taken with\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 14th August._--There was much alarm in the town, as it was\r\nexpected that the next morning an attack would be made on the city by\r\nthe King's troops; which however, did not prove so.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 17th._--Towards night a proclamation was published, in which\r\nall women, children, and infirm people were advised to leave the city,\r\nwith all possible speed; as a bombardment was expected; those that\r\nwere indigent should be assisted and provided for. This caused a new\r\nfright. Some of the sisters yet in town came to Br. Shewkirk to advise\r\nwith him about it.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 18th._--Early in the morning the two men of war and their\r\ntender, that had been up the North River, came back; which caused\r\nagain a sharp cannonading till they were passed. Yesterday, a\r\nfortnight ago, they had been attacked by the Row-gallies and a\r\nPrivateer, which were obliged to desist from their attempt; having\r\nbeen gradually worsted by the men-of-war, and lost several of their\r\nmen. Last week they attacked them with fire-ships, but could not\r\nobtain their end, and lost one of their captains; they then sunk\r\nvessels, and thought to be sure of having stopped their passage;\r\nhowever, they came back. It was a rainy morning, with a north east\r\nwind. The fright seemed to be not as great as it was when they went\r\nup; and yet the balls hurt more houses; some men were likewise hurt.\r\n\r\nPhil. Sypher's experienced a kind preservation. A nine pounder came\r\nthrough the old German church on the Broad Way, into the house they\r\nlived in, opposite the Lutheran church, and into the room where they\r\nslept; but they were up and out of the room. The ball come through the\r\nwindow, which it mashed to pieces, with part of the framework; went\r\nthrough the opposite wall near the head of the bedstead; crossed the\r\nstaircase to another room; but meeting with a beam in the wall, came\r\nback and went a part through the side wall, and then dropt down on the\r\nstairs. A thirty-two pounder, supposed coming from the Powlis Hook\r\nbattery, fell into Sr. Barnard's garden, just before her door. If\r\nthere was service kept, it was but in one church. Our preaching in the\r\nforenoon was on Jer. 45:19; \"I said not unto the seed of Jacob, seek\r\nye me in vain,\" &c., and in the evening from Matt. 6, 19 20; \"Lay not\r\nup for yourselves treasures on earth\" &c.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 21st._--In the evening ... a very heavy thunder storm came\r\non. It lasted for several hours, till after 10 o'clock; an uncommon\r\nlightning; one hard clap after the other; heavy rain mixed at times\r\nwith a storm like a hurricane. The inhabitants can hardly remember\r\nsuch a tempest, even when it struck into Trinity church twenty years\r\nago; they say it was but one very hard clap, and together did not last\r\nso long by far. Upon the whole it was an awful scene. Three officers,\r\nviz., one Captain, and two Lieuts., were killed in one of the Camps;\r\nthey were all Yorkers; and one soldier of the New English People was\r\nlikewise killed in a house in the square; several others were hurt,\r\nand the mast of one of the row gallies mash'd to pieces.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 22d_ and _Friday 23d._--The king's troops landed on Long\r\nIsland. The troops from here went over, one Battalion after the other,\r\nand many kept on coming in; yet, upon the whole their number certainly\r\nwas not so great as it commonly was made. In the evening we had the\r\ncongregational meeting with the little company that was present. We\r\nresolved to drop the Wednesday meeting for the present, and to begin\r\nthat on Tuesday and Friday at 6 o'clock.\r\n\r\n_Monday 26th._--A good deal of firing was heard on Long Island, and\r\nseveral skirmishes happened between the scouting parties, wherein the\r\nProvincials sustained loss.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 27th_ was a Fast and Prayer-day in this Province; which had\r\nbeen appointed by the Convention; but here in the city it was not and\r\ncould not be observed. On the one hand, there are but few inhabitants\r\nin the town, and the soldiers were busily employed; on the other hand\r\nthere was much alarm in the city. Soon, in the morning, an alarm gun\r\nwas fired in expectation, that the ships were coming up; which however\r\nproved not so; but on Long Island there was a smart engagement, in\r\nwhich the Americans suffered greatly. Two generals, Sullivan and\r\nSterling, and many other officers and soldiers were taken prisoners.\r\nAll the troops now went over; those from King's Bridge came likewise,\r\nand went over the next morning. As very few of our people came, we\r\nkept only a little meeting in the forenoon, in which a short discourse\r\nwas kept on Jer. 48, 17 and 18; and concluded with a moving prayer,\r\nkneeling. This (the result of the battle) was an agreeable\r\ndisappointment for all honest men; for what could such a fast signify,\r\nwhen men want to pursue measures against the Word and Will of God, &c.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 28th._--The different parties on Long Island kept on to be\r\nengaged with one another; the firing was plainly heard. Bro. Shewkirk\r\nmet with a young man, who waited on Ensign Goodman, and who was come\r\nback from Long Island. He told him that he, and a small number of his\r\nregiment--Huntington's,--had escaped with their lives. It had been a\r\nsight he should never forget; such as he never wished to see again.\r\nThis young man is of a serious turn, and religious more than common,\r\nand promises to be the Lords'. In the afternoon we had extraordinary\r\nheavy rains and thunder. From one of the Forts of the Continental army\r\non Long Island, two alarm guns were fired in the midst of the heavy\r\nrain; supposing that the regulars would attack their line somewhere\r\nbetween Flatbush and Brockland; all the men were ordered out though it\r\nrained prodigiously; it was found, after some time, that it was a\r\nfalse alarm. The sound of these alarm guns had just ceased, when,\r\nimmediately after, a flash of lightning came, followed by a clap of\r\nthunder. It was awful. The very heavy rain, with intermixed thunder,\r\ncontinued for some hours till towards evening. In the night the\r\nbattling on Long Island continued, and likewise,\r\n\r\n_Thursday 29th_; and in the afternoon such heavy rain fell again as\r\ncan hardly be remembered; nevertheless the operations on Long Island\r\nwent on more or less; and behold, in the night, the Americans thought\r\nit advisable to retreat, and leave Long Island to the King's troops.\r\nThey found that they could not stand their ground, and feared to be\r\nsurrounded, and their retreat cut off. The great loss they had\r\nsustained, the want of provision and shelter, in the extraordinary\r\nWet; the unfitness of many of their troops for war, &c.; undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to this resolution.\r\n\r\n_Friday 30th._--In the morning, unexpectedly and to the surprize of\r\nthe city, it was found that all that could come back was come back;\r\nand that they had abandoned Long Island; when many had thought to\r\nsurround the king's troops, and make them prisoners with little\r\ntrouble. The language was now otherwise; it was a surprising change,\r\nthe merry tones on drums and fifes had ceased, and they were hardly\r\nheard for a couple of days. It seemed a general damp had spread; and\r\nthe sight of the scattered people up and down the streets was indeed\r\nmoving. Many looked sickly, emaciated, cast down, &c.; the wet\r\nclothes, tents,--as many as they had brought away,--and other things,\r\nwere lying about before the houses and in the streets to-day; in\r\ngeneral everything seemed to be in confusion. Many, as it is reported\r\nfor certain, went away to their respective homes. The loss in killed\r\nand wounded and taken has been great, and more so than it ever will be\r\nknown. Several were drowned and lost their lives in passing a creek to\r\nsave themselves. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland people\r\nlost the most; the New England people, &c., it seems are but poor\r\nsoldiers, they soon took to their heels. At night, the few that came\r\nor would come, had a meeting on the texts; and the next day we ended\r\nthis troublesome month with the watch-word, \"He that believeth shall\r\nnot make haste.\" \"Grant me to lean unshaken, &c.\"\r\n\r\n_Sunday 1st September._--We had our preaching in the forenoon, and in\r\nthe evening as usual; and in the afternoon the Congregation meeting.\r\nAt the preachings we had goodly companies of strangers.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 3d._--The evening meeting was on the Watchword and Text. The\r\nrebel army begun to re-collect themselves; and the greatest part\r\nmarched towards Harlem, and along the East River, some miles from\r\nhere; the king's army advanced eastward on Long Island, opposite the\r\nHell Gate, and thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Monday 9th._--Whereas the troubles of War were now near Watts' House,\r\nPhil. Sypher fetched his wife, child, and goods back from thence to\r\ntown, as also the things out of the Chapel House that had been there;\r\nand it was just high time, else they might have been lost; for this\r\nhouse soon after was plundered by the king's troops. Several other\r\npeople came back from those parts. By the measures and proceedings of\r\nthe Rebel army, it appeared evident, that they intended to leave the\r\ncity; for as they had begun last week, so all this week, they removed\r\ntheir sick, their stoves, and ammunition, and gradually the soldiers\r\nmarched away. They likewise took the bells out of all the Churches and\r\nconveyed them away.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 11th_ and _Thursday 12th._--Night and day they were busy to\r\nbring their things away; and it appeared plain, that there would be a\r\nchange soon; the reports were various. Almost daily there was firing\r\nfrom Long Island to Horn's Hook, and the ship yards here.\r\n\r\n_Friday 13th._--In the afternoon, some Men of War went up the East\r\nriver; the few cannons left, fired on the ships, which caused that\r\nthey fired back from Long Island and Governor's Island and very\r\nsmartly. Isaac Van Vleck, who is too much bewildered in the matter,\r\nmade haste to get out of town.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 14th._--In the afternoon more ships went up the East River,\r\nwhich being fired on again, brought on another smart cannonading; some\r\nHouses were damaged and it was very unsafe to walk in the streets. The\r\nremainder of the Rebel army hasted away, and so did the members of\r\nthe Committee, and others of the deluded people.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 15th._--Soon in the morning when the tide served, more ships\r\npassed up both the North and East river; and though what was yet in\r\ntown of the Rebel troops got away as fast as they could, yet they\r\nfired again on the ships, as they did likewise from Powles Hook; which\r\ncaused a cannonading which made the houses shake, and the sound of it\r\nwas terrible. One large ball, supposed to come from Powles Hook flew\r\nagainst the North Church, just opposite the chapel broke, and a part\r\nof it went back into a neighboring cellar kitchen, where a negro woman\r\nwas, who came running over to the kitchen of the chapel-house; where\r\nalso Syphers' family was, who had been there all night, as they lived\r\nnear the fort, where the houses were most exposed to the firing. After\r\nsome time the firing ceased, and at the usual time we had the\r\nforenoon's preaching, in all stillness; the only service kept in the\r\ncity. About this time the king's troops had landed on York Island,\r\nabout three miles from the city; there was some slaughter, and the\r\nrebels were made to retreat towards Harlem. In the afternoon at three\r\nwas the congregation meeting; but the evening preaching we thought\r\nproper to drop. There was a good deal of commotion in the town; the\r\nContinental stores were broke open, and people carried off the\r\nprovisions; the boats crossed to Powles' Hook backward and forward yet\r\ntill toward evening; some people going away and others coming in; but\r\nthen the ferry boats withdrew, and the passage was stopped. Some of\r\nthe king's officers from the ships came on shore, and were joyfully\r\nreceived by some of the inhabitants. The king's flag was put up again\r\nin the fort, and the Rebels' taken down. And thus the city was now\r\ndelivered from those Usurpers who had oppressed it so long.\r\n\r\n_Monday Sept. 16th._--In the forenoon the first of the English troops\r\ncame to town. They were drawn up in two lines in the Broad Way;\r\nGovernor Tryon and others of the officers were present, and a great\r\nconcourse of people. Joy and gladness seemed to appear in all\r\ncountenances, and persons who had been strangers one to the other\r\nformerly, were now very sociable together, and friendly. Bro.\r\nShewkirk, who accidentally, came to it, met with several instances of\r\nthat kind.--The first that was done was, that all the houses of those\r\nwho have had a part and a share in the Rebellion were marked as\r\nforfeited. Many indeed were marked by persons who had no order to do\r\nso, and did it perhaps to one or the other from some personal\r\nresentment. Bro. Shewkirk, walking through the streets, saw to his\r\ngrief, that several houses belonging to our people were likewise\r\nmarked; as Sr. Kilburn's, Hilah Waldron's, and Sr. Bouquet's, King's,\r\nIsaac Van Vleck's, &c. He wrote afterwards to Governor Tryon,\r\ncongratulating him on the late happy event, and at the same time\r\ninterceded in behalf of the 2 Ww's houses. The word of this day was\r\nremarkable: \"Israel shall be saved in the Lord, with an everlasting\r\nsalvation; ye shall not be confounded world without end.\" The\r\nfollowing day everything was pretty quiet, though almost daily they\r\nbrought in prisoners, who were lodged in the Dutch and Presbyterian\r\nchurches. The fear one had of the city's being destroyed by fire\r\nsubsided, and the inhabitants thought themselves now pretty secure;\r\nlittle thinking that destruction was so near.\r\n\r\n_Friday 20th._--Bro. Jacobsen came from Staten Island, and it was a\r\ntrue mutual joy to see one another; as, for a couple of months we\r\ncould have no communication with Staten Island. By him we heard that\r\nour people there were all well.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 21st._--In the first hour of the day, soon after midnight,\r\nthe whole city was alarmed by a dreadful fire. Bro. Shewkirk, who was\r\nalone in the chapel-house, was not a little struck, when he saw the\r\nwhole air red, and thought it to be very near; but going into the\r\nstreet, he found that it was in the low west end of the town; and went\r\nthither. When he came down the Broad Way, he met with Sr. Sykes and\r\nher children. She was almost spent carrying the child, and a large\r\nbundle besides. He took the bundle, and went back with them, and let\r\nthem in to our house; when he left them, and returned with their\r\nprentice to the fire, taking some buckets along. The fire was then in\r\nthe lower part of Broad street, Stone street, &c. It spread so\r\nviolently that all what was done was but of little effect; if one was\r\nin one street and looked about, it broke out already again in another\r\nstreet above; and thus it raged all the night, and till about noon.\r\nThe wind was pretty high from south-east, and drove the flames to the\r\nnorthwest. It broke out about White Hall; destroyed a part of Broad\r\nstreet, Stone street, Beaver street, the Broadway, and then the\r\nstreets going to the North River, and all along the North river as far\r\nas the King's College. Great pain was taken to save Trinity church,\r\nthe oldest and largest of the English churches, but in vain; it was\r\ndestroyed, as also the old Lutheran church; and St. Paul's, at the\r\nupper end of the Broadway, escaped very narrowly. Some of our families\r\nbrought of their goods to our house. Bro. Shewkirk had the pleasure to\r\nbe a comfort to our neighbors, who were much frightened the fire might\r\ncome this way; and indeed, if the wind had shifted to the west as it\r\nhad the appearance a couple of times, the whole city might have been\r\ndestroyed. The corner house of our street, going to the Broadway,\r\ncatched already; Bro. Shewkirk ordered our long ladder, and the others\r\nto be fetched out of our burying ground; which were of service in\r\ncarrying the water up to the roof of said house in buckets; and by the\r\nindustry of all the people the fire was put out. Several of our people\r\nhave sustained considerable loss: Sr. Kilburn has lost two houses;\r\nPell's three houses; Jacobson one, and Widow Zoeller her's; and others\r\nhave lost a part of their goods; as Lepper, Eastman, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are great reasons to suspect that some wicked incendiaries had a\r\nhand in this dreadful fire, which has consumed the fourth part of the\r\ncity; several persons have been apprehended; moreover there were few\r\nhands of the inhabitants to assist; the bells being carried off, no\r\ntimely alarm was given; the engines were out of order; the fire\r\ncompany broke; and also no proper order and directions, &c.; all which\r\ncontributed to the spreading of the flames.\r\n\r\n_Monday 23d._--The fire has thrown a great damp on the former joyful\r\nsensation; numbers of people were carried to Jail, on suspicion to\r\nhave had a hand in the fire, and to have been on the Rebel's side; it\r\nis said about 200; however, on examination, the most men were as fast\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nBro. Conrad, also, was taken to Jail, but after a couple of days he\r\ncame out again. Daniel Van Vleck expected the same, which made his\r\nwife and family much distressed; for he had often talked too\r\ninconsiderate, and in a wrong spirit; however it blew over. After all,\r\nit is observable, that those of our people who had kept themselves\r\nfree from the Infatuation, were acknowledged as such, and met with\r\nnothing disagreeable of that kind.\r\n\r\n_November._--In November new troubles began on account of the\r\nquartering of the soldiers, of whom more and more come in; as also\r\nmany of their women and children. Many of the public buildings were\r\nalready filled with Prisoners, or sick, &c; especially all the Dutch\r\nand Presbyterian churches, as also the French church, the Baptists,\r\nand new Quaker meeting; and we were not without apprehension, that\r\nsomething of that nature might come upon us; and this the more, as the\r\nChapel-House has the appearance of a spacious building; and just\r\nopposite the same they were fitting up the fine north church of the\r\nEnglish Dutch for Barracks.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 16th._--From early in the morning till towards noon, a heavy\r\ncannonading was heard, tho' at a considerable distance; one heard\r\nafterwards that the king's troops had attacked the lines and the\r\nfamous Fort Washington, and carried it; several thousands of the\r\nrebels were taken prisoners, &c. The king's army has been about 2\r\nmonths thereabouts; and there have been, from time to time, sharp\r\nengagements, at the White Plains, &c; till at last they have driven\r\nthem away from the York Island; and it was a matter of moment, as now\r\none may hope that the communication with the Jerseys will be open'd,\r\nas also with the places up the East River; so that the Inhabitants may\r\ncome to the city and provisions be brought in; especially wood, which\r\nis not to be had, and is extremely dear; a cord of oak wood, bought\r\nformerly for 20s. now 4£s. Fort Constitution, or Lee, opposite Fort\r\nWashington, now Fort Kniphausen, on the Jersey side surrender'd, or\r\nwas left by the rebels; and the king's troops got soon master of this\r\npart of the Jerseys, and advanced swiftly towards Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 18th._--In the forenoon, about 11 o'clock, 2 officers, with 2\r\nother gentlemen came to see the chapel and house; Bro. Shewkirk showed\r\nthem about; one of the officers asked whether service was kept in the\r\nchapel; and hearing it was, said, it would be a pity to take it; the\r\nother ran about very swiftly, and saw every part of the premises. Bro.\r\nShewkirk, who easily could guess what the meaning was, as soon as they\r\nwere gone, made application to the present commanding General\r\nRobertson, and to Governor Tryon. The former was not at home; the\r\nlatter received him kindly, but said he could do nothing in the\r\nmatter, as now all the power was lodged with the army; yet he would\r\nrecommend the matter to the General; and this he did in a few lines he\r\nwrote under the petition, referring it to the favorable consideration\r\nof the General. Bro. Shewkirk carried it to him, but he was not come\r\nhome yet, and so he left it there. He did not know that the 2000 and\r\nmore prisoners taken in Fort Washington, had come already to town. In\r\nthe afternoon about 4 o'clock he saw at once the street before the\r\nwindow full of people. The serjeant of the guard came to the door, and\r\nasked whether this was the Moravian meeting? He was order'd to bring\r\nthese 400 prisoners here by command of the Generals Smith and\r\nRobertson. If the latter had order'd it, it may be it was done before\r\nhe came home to his quarters. Bro. Shewkirk, who was alone in the\r\nhouse, did not know what to do; he could not go away. By and by the\r\nMajor who had command of the prisoners and another man came in; they\r\nlooked at the Chapel, and said it was too small; the latter said he\r\nhad told that before, he had been in the place before now, and knew\r\nit. He spoke to Bro. Shewkirk, and condoled with him that the place\r\nshould be taken; they began to doubt of the certainty, and thought\r\nthere was a mistake in the matter; another young man of the city who\r\nknows Bro. Shewkirk, and has now the care of the provisions for the\r\nrebel prisoners, was likewise inclined in our favour. These 3 persons\r\nwent backward and forward to make another inquiry; at last one of them\r\ncame back and told he had met with the Deputy Barrack Master, a Jew;\r\nwho had told him they must be here. Well--the gate on the men's side\r\nwas open'd.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant of the guard, quite a civil man, advised to take all\r\nloose things out of the chapel before the prisoners came in. This was\r\ndone accordingly. Phil. Sykes, who was come before this time, and\r\nextremely welcome, while Bro. Shewkirk was alone in the house,\r\nassisted herein; as also young Wiley; and it took up some time, during\r\nwhich the Major came again, and order'd the serjeant to wait awhile\r\nlonger; he would go to Genl. Robertson. After some time he came back,\r\nand addressed Bro. Shewkirk in a friendly manner; saying, he had\r\nbelieved they would have been a disagreeable company; and took the\r\nprisoners to the North Church. Bro. Shewkirk thanked the Major for his\r\nkindness; may the Lord reward him as also the other two men. The\r\nprisoners, with the guard, stood above half an hour in the street\r\nbefore our door, and many spectators, of whom none, so far as one\r\ncould see, showed a wish for their coming in, but several signified\r\nthe reverse, and were glad when it did not take place. An old\r\ngentleman, several weeks after, accosted Bro. Shewkirk in the street,\r\nand told him how sorry he had been when he saw these people standing\r\nbefore our door; he had heard Bro. Rice, &c. After this affair was\r\nover, Bro. Shewkirk retreated to this room, and thanked our Saviour,\r\nwith tears, for his visible help; He has the hearts of all men in His\r\nhands. If these prisoners had come in, how much would our place have\r\nbeen ruined, as one may see by the North Church; not to mention the\r\npainful thought of seeing a place dedicated to our Savior's praise,\r\nmade a habitation of darkness and uncleanness. Praise be to Him and\r\nthe Father!\r\n\r\nAs the winter quarters of the soldiers in this city were not settled\r\nyet, the apprehension was not over, that some would be put to us; and\r\nso one of our neighbors thought, who in time of peace was one of the\r\nCommon Council men; but at the same time he assured Bro. Shewkirk that\r\nas far as he knew, none of the creditable and sensible men of the\r\ntown, wished it out of spite, &c. Bro. Shewkirk's character was\r\nwell-known, but the house was large, and there was want of room.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, December 1st._--In the afternoon about two o'clock, a company\r\nof officers came into the House, looking for some quarter for\r\nthemselves. It was assured by some that they would not disturb our\r\nchurch and service; some talked but of some rooms; others said they\r\nmust have the whole house, and the chapel too. One, a Cornet of the\r\nLight Horse marked one room for himself; desired to clear it this\r\nafternoon, and let him have a table and a couple of chairs, and he\r\nwould willingly pay for it. After they were gone, Bro. Shewkirk, and\r\nWilson who was just with him, went to Genl. Robertson. The Genl. was\r\nkind; he said he had given them no orders; he intended to have no\r\nplace disturbed where service was kept. He took down Bro. Shewkirk's\r\nname and the matter; which chiefly was, not to disturb our chapel, nor\r\nto desire the whole house, Bro. Shewkirk offer'd a couple of rooms if\r\nnecessary; and at last said he would go to Alderman Waddel. He was\r\nalong with the officers in the street, before they came in, but told\r\nWilson he had nothing to do with it; he only upon their desire had\r\ngone along with them, and hear what he knew of the matter, and they\r\nshould come along with him. When they were on the way, they met one of\r\nthose officers, (the Genl's clerk) and indeed him, who spoke the most\r\nimperiously, and that he would have the chapel; upon which the Genl.\r\nand they returned to the Genl's house. The officer spoke here quite in\r\nanother tone and said he had already told the other to look out for\r\nanother place, etc. The Genl. said he would see about the matter, and\r\ngive an answer the next morning. The brethren went home, and Bro.\r\nShewkirk held the congregation meeting for which the brethren and\r\nsisters were gathered together. Upon this occasion we found again that\r\nour neighbors were not against us. One said, it cannot be that they\r\nwould take your place, the only place where public service was held\r\nwhen there was none in the whole city. In the evening the room which\r\nthe Cornet had marked was cleared, in case he should come; but none of\r\nthem came again. Some time after, Dr. Edmunds, belonging to the\r\nhospital came one day, and with much civility and modesty inquired\r\nafter a room. Bro. Shewkirk, thinking perhaps it might be a means to\r\nbe free from a further endeavor of somebody's being quartered\r\nhere,--and moreover wishing to have a man in the house in these\r\ndays,--offered him the room the Cornet had marked; and after some\r\nweeks he came, and proves a very civil and quiet gentleman, who causes\r\nlittle or no troubles.\r\n\r\n_Monday 2nd._--The commissioner's extraordinary gracious proclamation\r\nin the name of the King, was published in the public papers; by virtue\r\nof which all rebels within 60 days may return without suffering any\r\nforfeiture or punishment; and it has had a great effect; numbers are\r\ncome in, have signed the prescribed declaration, availed themselves of\r\nthe benefit of the proclamation, and returned to the peaceable\r\nenjoyment of their property; though afterwards some of them have shown\r\ntheir insincerity and bad principles, going back again to the rebels.\r\nThe officers yesterday doubtless thought in a hurry to secure lodgings\r\nto themselves before the proclamation was published, as now they can't\r\ntake houses as they please. This was also the answer Genl. Robertson\r\ngave to Bro. Wilson this morning, when he carried in his name, and\r\nmentioned again our house and chapel. The Genl. said the proclamation\r\nwould settle these matters.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 31st._--Whereas it is at present very unsafe in the evenings\r\nto be out, on account of several late robberies, and persons having\r\nbeen knocked down besides, we were obliged to submit to the times and\r\ncircumstances; and therefore the congregation members met at 4 o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, and had a love feast; to praise together our dear\r\nand gracious Lord for all his goodness bestowed on us during this year\r\nfull of troubles. Indeed these times have been a time of shaking, and\r\nwhat had no root is dropped off.\r\n\r\n1777.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 7th January._--Since the attack and defeat which the Hessians\r\nsustained near Trenton some time ago, the rebels are again in high\r\nspirits; and whereas the King's troops have been ordered down towards\r\nPhiladelphia from Newark, and about Hackensack, the rebels are come\r\nagain to these places, and distress the inhabitants greatly. Several\r\nare come to town, having fled from thence.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 14th._--Upon the request of General Howe to lend our benches\r\nfor the entertainment on the Queen's birthday, several wagons full\r\nwere fetched.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 18th._--Several reports prevailed that a part of the rebel\r\narmy was approaching this city, and early this morning they had made\r\nan attack upon a fort above King's Bridge; but they were repulsed.\r\nSome of the soldiers here were ordered up that way to-day, and all the\r\nnight soldiers kept a look-out.\r\n\r\n_Monday 20th._--It appears from the public papers, that intelligence\r\nhas been had of a further intention to destroy this city by fire. For\r\nthis reason the city watch has been regulated anew, according to which\r\nabout 80 men watched every night in the different wards. Besides this,\r\nsome of the Light Horse patrol the streets in the night. Some other\r\nregulations were likewise published, which give again an aspect of\r\nmatters coming again into some order. The effect has also shown\r\nitself, the breaking down of fences, &c., does not go on as it did for\r\na while; the bread is larger &c.\r\n\r\nTo-day a beginning was made with the inhabitants to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to his Majesty. Every day 2 wards are taken; it is done\r\nbefore the governor, mayor, &c.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 6th February._--Our burying ground at Fresh Water, (corner\r\nof Mott and Pell streets) lies entirely open; not the least of a board\r\nor post is left.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 16th._--The evening preaching at 6, was on a part of the\r\nto-day's Epistle: 2 Cor. vi: 1, 2; the subject,--\"not to receive the\r\ngrace of God in vain.\" When near the conclusion, another cry of fire\r\nwas heard in the street, so that the last verses could not be sung. It\r\nhappened to be in the Broadway, but was put out soon.\r\n\r\n_Monday 17th._--Towards evening there was another alarm of fire, but\r\nit proved to be a false one, and the engines were ordered back.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 4th March._--In the afternoon was the burial of Dr.\r\nAutchmuty, Rector of Trinity Church here, who departed this life last\r\nTuesday. Bro. Shewkirk was invited, and was one of the ministers that\r\nwere pall-bearers. There was a large company of ministers present; the\r\nmost of them were strangers, partly belonging to the army. He was\r\nburied in St. Paul's. The weather was bad, raining and snowing, yet\r\nthere was a great concourse of people. Mr. Inglis kept the funeral\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n_Sunday 16th._--Some wild officers who came into the evening meeting\r\ndisturbed the devotion somewhat; however they went away soon; the\r\nauditory was pretty large and attentive.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 18th._--We have had fine weather of late. On Sunday night\r\nabout 100 of the rebels being in a house somewhere above King's\r\nBridge, some of the King's troops went to take them prisoners; and as\r\nsoon as they saw and heard nothing of an opposition, they surrounded\r\nthe house, and the Captain and some men went in; but some of the\r\nrebels took up their guns, and killed the captain, and 4 or 5 men;\r\nupon which the others rushed in with their fixed bayonets, killed\r\nabout 40, and took the rest prisoners. In the Jerseys some fightings\r\nhave likewise been within these days.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 29th May._--The King's troops are preparing for the\r\ncampaign, and to leave the town and winter quarters. The day before\r\nyesterday some of the fleet with fresh troops from home arrived, and\r\nyesterday a large number of troops came in from King's Bridge to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 31st._--As many troops are come in, some were lodged in the\r\nNorth Church opposite us, who made a great wild noise. They were of\r\nthe recruits that are come from England. Others were lodged in the\r\nMethodist meeting, and in the old Dutch church, &c.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday 3rd June._--The packet came in, as also more troops; but we\r\ngot no letter.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 4th._--At noon a salute was given from all the ships in the\r\nriver, this being His Majesty's birthday. In the evening meeting we\r\nblessed our dear king; afterwards the front of our house was\r\nilluminated with 48 candles, and made a fine sight to the satisfaction\r\nof the beholders. To-day our Sister Len. Venema came back out of the\r\ncountry to our joy.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 5th._--In these days the troops were moving, and everything\r\nwas in an emotion; and on\r\n\r\n_Friday 6th._--Many went away into the Jerseys; more of the German\r\ntroops were arrived.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday 25th._--An account had come to town within these days, that\r\nthe intended expedition of the army had not succeeded:--finding the\r\nrebel army too much entrenched and fortified; and therefore they had\r\nreturned to Amboy; would leave the Jerseys, embark, and go upon\r\nanother expedition. A good many of the army came to town, especially\r\nalso women and children, so as to make the place and streets pretty\r\nfull again. Several of the Jersey inhabitants flocked likewise to the\r\ncity. In the evening the xii. chapter of the Hebrews was read, and\r\nspoken on.\r\n\r\n_Saturday 28th._--Since Thursday, a report prevailed that there had\r\nbeen a smart battle in the Jerseys. After the King's troops had\r\nembarked, and the day was appointed to sail on an expedition, the\r\ngeneral got intelligence that part of the rebel army was come within\r\nthree miles from Amboy; upon which the troops were ordered back on\r\nshore, and march'd in the night to surround the rebels, with whom\r\nWashington was, it is said. The reports vary much, and were\r\nexaggerated exceedingly: 1,100 killed of the King's troops; 5 or 6,000\r\nof the rebels; as many taken prisoners, and their artillery; they were\r\nsurrounded with Washington; that they could not escape; nay,\r\nWashington was among the slain; Stirling dead of his wounds; Genl.\r\nLivingston likewise, &c.; 400 Pennsylvanians had grounded their arms,\r\nand come over to the regulars, &c., &c. To-day, the account fell very\r\nmuch, and came down to a few hundreds lost on the rebel side; how many\r\non our side, is not said at all. Seventy were taken prisoners, who\r\nwere, together with a couple of field-pieces, brought to town early in\r\nthe morning. Matters go but slow, and cause concern to all\r\ndisinterested well-wishers.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 3rd July._--The King's army has left the Jerseys, and is\r\ncome back to Staten Island. Many came to town daily; so that it grows\r\nquite full again for the present. The rebels have now the whole\r\nJerseys again except Powless's Hook; and we are just where we were\r\nlast year, after the being in possession of N.Y. Island. 'Tis very\r\ndiscouraging, may the Lord pity this poor country.\r\n\r\n     [Original in the Archives of the Moravian Church.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 38.]\r\n\r\nMAJOR NICHOLAS FISH TO RICHARD VARICK\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April 9, 1776.\r\n\r\nI have since my last been on Several Excursions in military\r\nCapacity--That to West Chester County to Guard the Cannon & find out\r\nthe Authors of Spiking them, has probably ere this time reached you; I\r\nshall not therefore trouble you with a detail.\r\n\r\nYou wish to hear what we are about in New York [ ] [Transcriber's\r\nNote: blank in original] To be informed, picture to yourself the once\r\nflourishing City evacuated of most of its Members (especially the\r\nfair).

This, tho' you will suppose\r\nit did not agree well with the tender Hands & delicate Textures of\r\nmany, was notwithstanding with amazing agility and neatness, and\r\nlaying vanity aside, is generally judged to be the best work of the\r\nkind in the city; the Hospital round which our Works are, is made an\r\nArsenal for Provisions. On Bayards Mount now called Montgomerie Mount,\r\nas a Monument to that great Heroe, who honorably fell supporting\r\nfreedom's cause, there will be a Fortification superior in Strength to\r\nany my Imagination could ever have conceived.

The Parapet of\r\nthe old Battery is raised to a proper Height, with a sufficient number\r\nof Ambersures--As also the Parapet on the Fort Wall. There are two\r\nfortifications on Long Island opposite this City to command the\r\nshipping, one on Gours Island, one at red Hook, and the City itself\r\nand Suburbs filled with them.

You will be in Boston long before this can reach you, and will\r\ndoubtless have heard of the Discovery of the greatest and vilest\r\nattempt ever made against our country: I mean the _plot_, the infernal\r\n_plot_ which has been contrived by our worst enemies, and which was on\r\nthe verge of execution: you will, I say, undoubtedly have _heard_ of\r\nit, but perhaps I may give you a better idea of it than as yet you\r\nhave obtained. The Mayor of York with a number of villains who were\r\npossessed of fortunes, and who formerly ranked with Gentlemen, had\r\nimpiously dared an undertaking, big with fatal consequences to the\r\n_virtuous_ army in York, and which in all probability would have given\r\nthe enemy possession of the city with little loss. Their design was,\r\nupon the first engagement which took place, to have murdered (with\r\ntrembling I say it) the best man on earth: Genl Washington was to\r\nhave been the first subject of their unheard of SACRICIDE: our\r\nmagazines which, as you know, are very capacious, were to have been\r\nblown up: every General Officer and every other who was active in\r\nserving his country in the field was to have been assassinated: our\r\ncannon were to be spiked up: and in short every the most accursed\r\nscheme was laid to give us into the hands of the enemy, and to ruin\r\nus. They had plenty of money, and gave large bounties and larger\r\npromises to those who were engaged to serve their hellish purposes. In\r\norder to execute their Design upon our General, they had enlisted into\r\ntheir service one or two from his Excellency's _life-Guard_, who were\r\nto have assassinated _him_: knowing that no person could be admitted\r\ninto the magazines or among the cannon but those who were of the\r\nArtillery they have found several in our Regiment vile enough to be\r\nconcerned in their diabolical Designs--these were to have blown up the\r\nMagazines and spiked the cannon. (Tell Homans, one Rotch, a fellow he\r\nbled for me in Morton's company at No 1 is taken up with his\r\nbrother for being concerned.) Their Design was deep, long concerted,\r\nand wicked to a _great Degree_. But happily for us, it has pleased God\r\nto discover it to us in season, and I think we are making a right\r\nimprovement of it (as the good folks say). We are hanging them as fast\r\nas we find them out. I have just now returned from the Execution of\r\none[242] of the General's Guard: he was the first that has been tried:\r\nyesterday at 11 o'clock he received sentence, to-day at 11 he was hung\r\nin presence of the whole army. He is a Regular-Deserter ... he\r\nappeared unaffected and obstinate to the last, except that when the\r\nChaplains took him by the hand under the Gallows and bad him adieu, a\r\ntorrent of tears flowed over his face; but with an indignant scornful\r\nair he wiped 'em with his hand from his face, and assumed the\r\n_confident look_. You remember General Greene commands at Long Island;\r\nwith his last breath the fellow told the spectators, that unless\r\nGenl Greene was very cautious, the Design would _as yet_ be\r\nexecuted on him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: Thomas Hickey.]\r\n\r\nThe trial will go on, and I imagine they will be hung, gentle and\r\nsimple, as fast as the fact is proved upon them.\r\n\r\nThat any set of men could be so lost to every virtuous principle, and\r\nso dead to the feelings of humanity as to conspire against the person\r\nof so great and good a man as Genl Washington is surprising; few of\r\nour countrymen (as you may imagine) are concerned; they are in general\r\nforeigners: upwards of 30 were concerned, and 'tis said Govr Tryon\r\nis at the bottom....\r\n\r\nOur Expedition against the Light house did not succeed; they command\r\nit so well with ye shipping that 'tis thought wise to let it\r\nstand....\r\n\r\nW.

Our situation has been such this\r\nfortnight or more as scarce to admit of writing. We have daily\r\nexpected an action--by which means, if any one was going, and we had\r\nletters written, orders were so strict for our tarrying in camp that\r\nwe could rarely get leave to go and deliver them.--For about 6 or 8\r\ndays the enemy have been expected hourly, whenever the wind and tide\r\nin the least favored. We keep a particular look out for them this\r\nmorning. The place and manner of attack time must determine. The event\r\nwe leave to Heaven. Thanks to God! we have had time for compleating\r\nour works and receiving reenforcements. The militia of Connecticut\r\nordered this way are mostly arrived. Col. [Andrew] Ward's Regt has\r\ngot in. Troops from the Southward are daily coming. We hope, under\r\nGod, to give a good account of the Enemy whenever they choose to make\r\nthe last appeal.\r\n\r\nLast Friday night, two of our five vessels (a Sloop and a Schooner)\r\nmade an attempt upon the shipping up the River. The night was too\r\ndark, the wind too slack for the attempt. The Schooner which was\r\nintended for one of the Ships had got by before she discovered them;\r\nbut as Providence would have it, she run athwart a bomb-catch which\r\nshe quickly burned. The Sloop by the light of the fire discovered the\r\nPhoenix--but rather too late--however, she made shift to grapple\r\nher, but the wind not proving sufficient to bring her close along side\r\nor drive the flames immediately on board, the Phoenix after much\r\ndifficulty got her clear by cutting her own rigging. Sergt Fosdick\r\nwho commanded the above Sloop, and four of his hands, were of my\r\nCompany, the remaining two were of this Regt.\r\n\r\nThe Genl has been pleased to reward their bravery with forty\r\ndollars each, except the last man who quitted the fire Sloop, who had\r\nfifty. Those on board the schooner received the same.\r\n\r\nI must write to some of my brothers lest you should not be at home.\r\nRemain\r\n\r\nYour friend and Brother\r\n  N. HALE.\r\n\r\nMR.

When you are informed that New York is deserted by its old\r\ninhabitants, and filled with soldiers from New England, Philadelphia,\r\nand Jersey--you will naturally conclude, the _Environs_ of it are not\r\nvery safe from so undisciplined a multitude, as our Provincials are\r\nrepresented to be; but I do believe, there are few instances of so\r\ngreat a number of men together, with so little mischief done by them;\r\nthey have all the simplicity of ploughmen in their manners, and seem\r\nquite strangers to the vices of older soldiers. They have been\r\nemployed in erecting fortifications in every part of the town; and it\r\nwould make you sorry to see the place so changed: the old fort walls,\r\nare demolished in part, although that is an advantage to the Broadway.\r\nThere is a Battery carried across the street, erected partly at Lord\r\nAbingdon's expense, for the Fascines, were cut out of the _wood_ that\r\nbelonged to the Warren estate: it was beautiful _wood_--Oliver De\r\nLancey, had been nursing it these forty years; it looks in a piteous\r\nstate now: Mr. D. hoped to have it somewhat spared by telling the New\r\nEngland men, who were cutting it, that a third part belonged to one of\r\nthe _Protesting Lords_. One of them answered, 'Well, and if he be such\r\na great liberty boy, and so great a friend to our country, he will be\r\nquite happy that his wood, was so _happy_ for our use.' You remember\r\nBayard's Mount covered with cedars? It commanded a prospect\r\nexceedingly extensive! The top of it is so cut away, that there is\r\nroom enough for a house and garden; a fortification is there erected\r\nas well as round the _Hospital_:--in short, every place that can be\r\nemployed in that way, is or will be, so used. You may recollect a\r\nsweet situation at Horn's Hook, that Jacob Walton purchased, built an\r\nelegant house, and greatly and beautifully improved the place; he was\r\nobliged to quit the place; the troops took possession, and fortified\r\nthere. Oh, the houses in New York, if you could but see the insides of\r\nthem! Kennedy's house, Mallet's, and the next to it, had six hundred\r\nmen in them. If the owners ever get possession, they must be years in\r\ncleaning them. The merchants have raised their goods to an enormous\r\nprice; many articles are scarce indeed; and there is quite a hue and\r\ncry about _pins_. Common rum, 6 to 7 shillings per gallon; poor sugar,\r\n4l a hundred; molasses none; cotton 4s per pound.\"\r\n\r\n     [From the Historical Magazine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 42.]\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM THE LONDON CHRONICLE\r\n\r\nSEPT.--OCT. 1776.\r\n\r\nFROM A BRITISH OFFICER AT NEW YORK, SEPT. 6, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"General Howe finding himself at the head of 21,000 men, in high\r\nhealth and fit for action, was determined to begin upon it as soon as\r\npossible; accordingly a great number of regiments were reimbarked on\r\nboard the transports, and everything prepared for an Expedition, so\r\nsecret, that neither the second in Command at land or sea could guess\r\nwhere the blow was to fall.\r\n\r\nEverything being prepared, and the Cannon embarked in the night of the\r\n21st of September [August], the Rainbow of 50 guns, commanded by Sir\r\nGeorge Collier, got under weigh, and anchored near a strong post of\r\nthe enemy's, called Denysys, upon Long Island, who fled from thence\r\ninstantly, expecting the man of war would level the place to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA little after nine, the transports all anchored in Gravesend-bay on\r\nthe southern part of Long Island; the flat-bottom boats immediately\r\nlanded the troops, and the gallant Lord Howe was present to direct the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe army, when landed, consisted of 18000 men, the rest being left\r\nupon Staten Island. Lord Cornwallis Commanded one of the\r\nadvance-posts, Gen. Grant another, and Earl Percy had a post of\r\ndifficulty and danger, to which he on all occasions shewed himself\r\nequal. The King's forces lay still, getting ashore Cannon &c. for 3 or\r\n4 days, and then encamped at Flatbush; after this they moved on in\r\nthree bodies, and surprised many of the enemy's outposts, and killed\r\nand took a number of men.\"\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nOCT. 20, 1776.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt but before you receive this you'll be informed of the King's\r\ntroops being in possession of New York, to the great satisfaction of\r\nthe loyal part of its inhabitants, who have for a long time suffered\r\nevery hardship from a set of tyrants that is possible to be conceived;\r\nhowever, they are now rewarded who have withstood the traitors, and\r\nremained firm to their King. The Howes do all that is possible to\r\nalleviate the sufferings of a persecuted people, who rather than turn\r\nrebels have despised death and ruin; and if it had not pleased God to\r\nsend us death and relief, dreadful would have been the consequence to\r\nevery person that dared to be honest; however, we are now protected in\r\nour lives and properties; and some thousands have joined the King's\r\ntroops; and every time they attack the rebels they rout them with\r\ngreat loss; they fly before our victorious army on every onset; and I\r\ndon't doubt but in a very little time this daring rebellion will be\r\ncrushed. It would before now have been the case, had not the Americans\r\nbeen fed with hopes from the Court of France. But now let France or\r\nany other Power dare to assist them, we are prepared, and don't at all\r\nfear but we shall be able to give them a proper reception. It is\r\nresolved to attack Washington directly. Proper dispositions are making\r\nfor that purpose; and I hope by the next letter to give you an account\r\nof an end being put to a government that have dared to call themselves\r\nthe Independent States of America. Almost all the New Yorkers have\r\nreturned to their allegiance, and there is not a doubt but the other\r\nColonies will do the same when they dare declare themselves, and be\r\nproperly supported by government.\r\n\r\n\"There is a broad R put upon every door in New York that is\r\ndisaffected to government, and examples will be made of its\r\ninhabitants; on the other hand, every person that is well affected to\r\ngovernment finds protection.\"\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM WHITE PLAINS.\r\n\r\n\"The following Letter is from an officer of eminence, who was present\r\nat the engagement at White Plains, to his friend in Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n\"_Camp at White Plains, 31 Miles from New York, N.E. within six Miles\r\nof Hudson's River, Nov. 2, 1776._\r\n\r\n\"Our whole army, except about 2000 men, left New York Island, and on\r\nthe 12th of Oct. passed Hell-gates in our flat boats, and landed on\r\na part called Frogs-neck, in Westchester county; here we halted a few\r\ndays, until provisions were brought to us; and on the 18th we again\r\ntook to our boats, and passed a creek, in order to move this way, and\r\nto cut the rebels off from King's-Bridge. On our march the 18th, we\r\nhad two pretty smart skirmishes, but made the provincials give way as\r\nfast as we advanced. After marching about three miles, we halted to\r\nget cannon, provisions, &c. brought forward. On the 26th we marched\r\nagain by New Rochelle, about four miles without opposition, where we\r\nhalted till the 28th; and finding that the rebels had moved to this\r\nplace from King's-bridge, we followed them, and drove them from hill\r\nto hill, until we came within three quarters of a mile of their\r\nentrenched camp, where they made a shew of disputing a commanding\r\nground. A brisk Cannonade ensued, and we attacked them on the top of a\r\nrugged hill, where, though covered behind stone walls and fences, we\r\ndrove them off. We had about 200 killed and wounded. The rebels left\r\nabout 50 killed, besides what they carried off. We then encamped on\r\nthe ground, with an intent to drive them from their entrenchments; but\r\nyesterday at day-break they went off of themselves and took post on\r\nanother hill, about three-quarters of a mile further on where they are\r\nnow. They have left a post behind them in New York Island, near\r\nKing's-bridge of about 1500 men, [Fort Washington] which, I think, we\r\nshall give a very good account of. We have taken in their abandoned\r\nworks 74 pieces of cannon. Their whole force is now opposed to us.\r\nThey burn all the country as they retreat; they are a set of base\r\nfellows. I do not imagine we shall go much further this campaign, but\r\njust force them to go towards New England. I heard from Col. Campbell\r\nthe other day. He is well and anxious to be relieved. I write on my\r\nknee very cramped, and have lain in a waggon for three nights past,\r\none of which was very wet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 43.]\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE MEMOIRS OF COLONEL RUFUS PUTNAM[243]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: Washington's Chief Engineer in 1776.]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY HIMSELF\r\n\r\nThe 31st of March 1776, I received General Washington's orders \"to\r\nmarch to New York by the way of Providence, to afford Governor Cooke\r\nmy best advice and assistance in the construction of the work there.\"\r\nIn this tour I went to visit Newport again, where I laid out some\r\nadditional works; on my return from Newport to Providence I met with\r\nGeneral Washington there, I believe the 6th of April, and obtained\r\nleave to go by Brookfield to New York. I believe I tarried with my\r\nfamily part of two days and then pushed for New York where I arrived\r\nabout the 20th. On my arrival at New York I was charged as chief\r\nengineer with laying out and overseeing the works which were erected\r\nduring the campaign at New York, Long Island and their dependencies\r\nwith Fort Washington, Fort Lee, King's Bridge, etc., most of which,\r\nbut not all, appear in a plan of New York island etc., and\r\nobstructions in the river, which accompanies Marshall's Life of\r\nWashington. This was a service of much fatigue, for my whole time was\r\ntaken up from daylight in the morning until night in the business,\r\nbesides sometimes going in the night by water from New York to Fort\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nSeptember 8th 1776, a council of general officers had determined on\r\nholding the City of New York. See General Washington's letter of that\r\ndate. On the 12th of September having been out with General Miflin, by\r\norder of General Washington, to reconnoiter the country between\r\nKingsbridge and Morrisania and eastward, on our return we met with\r\nGeneral Washington near Harlem Heights, where we made our report to\r\nhim, in consequence of which a council of general officers was\r\nconvened, whose advice was the withdrawing the army from the\r\ncity,--see the General's letter of the 14th of September,--and this\r\nmeasure was the salvation of the army, and which probably would not\r\nhave been but for the discoveries made by Miflin and myself.\r\n\r\nMy being appointed engineer by Congress was wholly unexpected. I had\r\nbegun to act in that capacity through pure necessity, and had\r\ncontinued to conduct the business more from necessity and respect for\r\nthe General than from any opinion I had of my own abilities, or\r\nknowledge of that art; true it is that after my arrival at New York I\r\nhad read some books on fortification, and I knew much more than when I\r\nbegan at Roxbury, but I had not the vanity to suppose that my\r\nknowledge was such as to give me a claim to the first rank in a corps\r\nof engineers, yet my experience convinced me that such a corps was\r\nnecessary to be established, therefore near the last of September, I\r\ndrew up a plan for such an establishment and presented it to General\r\nWashington, and which he transmitted to Congress--see his letter to\r\nthat body of the 5th of November 1776. In my letter to General\r\nWashington on the subject I disclaimed all pretension of being placed\r\nat the head of the proposed corps, and signified it would be my choice\r\nto serve in the line of the army.\r\n\r\nOctober 19th 1776, the British landed on Pell's point and some\r\nskirmishing took place in the afternoon between part of Glover's\r\nbrigade and some advance parties of the enemy near East Chester, the\r\nnext morning by order of the General I set out from Kingsbridge to\r\nreconnoiter their position etc. I set out in company with Colo\r\nReed, the adjutant-general and a foot guard of about twenty men, when\r\nwe arrived on the heights of East Chester we saw a small body of\r\nBritish near the church, but we could obtain no intelligence; the\r\nhouses were deserted. Colo Reed now told me he must return to\r\nattend to issuing general orders. I observed that we had made no\r\ndiscovery yet of any consequence, that if he went back I wished him to\r\ntake the guard back for I chose to go alone. I then disguised my\r\nappearance as an officer as far as I could, and set out on the road to\r\nWhite-plains; however, I did not then know where White-plains was, nor\r\nwhere the road I had taken would carry me. I had gone about two and a\r\nhalf miles when a road turned off to the right, I followed it perhaps\r\nhalf a mile and came to a house where I learned from the woman that\r\nthis road led to New Rochelle, that the British were there and that\r\nthey had a guard at a house in sight; On this information I turned and\r\npursued my route toward White-plains (the houses on the way all\r\ndeserted) until I came within three or four miles of the place; here I\r\ndiscovered a house a little ahead with men about it. By my glass I\r\nfound they were not British soldiers; however I approached them with\r\ncaution. I called for some oats for my horse, sat down and heard them\r\nchat some little time, when I found they were friends to the cause of\r\nAmerica, and then I began to make the necessary enquiries, and on the\r\nwhole I found that the main body of the British lay near New Rochelle,\r\nfrom thence to White-plains about nine miles, good roads and in\r\ngeneral level open country, that at Whiteplains was a large quantity\r\nof stores, with only about three hundred militia to guard them, that\r\nthe British had a detachment at Mamaraneck only six miles from\r\nWhite-plains, and from Whiteplains only five miles to the North river,\r\nwhere lay five or six of the enemies ships and sloops, tenders, etc.\r\nHaving made these discoveries I set out on my return. The road from\r\nWard's across the Brunx was my intended route unless I found the\r\nBritish there, which haply they were not, but I saw Americans on the\r\nheights west of the Brunx who had arrived there after I passed up. I\r\nfound them to be Lord Sterling's division; it was now after sunset. I\r\ngave my Lord a short account of my discoveries, took some refreshment,\r\nand set off for headquarters by the way of Philip's at the mouth of\r\nSawmill river, a road I had never travelled, among tory inhabitants\r\nand in the night. I dare not enquire the way, but Providence conducted\r\nme. I arrived at headquarters near Kingsbridge (a distance of about\r\nten miles) about nine o'clock at night. I found the General alone. I\r\nreported to him the discoveries I had made, with a sketch of the\r\ncountry; he complained very feelingly of the gentlemen from New York\r\nfrom whom he had never been able to obtain a plan of the country, that\r\nfrom their information he had ordered the stores to Whiteplains as a\r\nplace of security. The General sent for General Greene and Genl\r\nGeorge Clinton, since Vice-President of the United States. As soon as\r\nGeneral Clinton came in my sketch and statement was shown to him and\r\nhe was asked if the situation of those places was as I had reported.\r\nGenl Clinton said it was.\r\n\r\nI had but a short time to refresh myself and horse when I received a\r\nletter from the General with orders to proceed immediately to Lord\r\nSterling's, and I arrived at his quarters about two o'clock in the\r\nmorning October 21st 1776. Lord Sterling's division marched before\r\ndaylight and we arrived at Whiteplains about 9 o'clock A.M. and thus\r\nwas the American army saved (by an interposing providence from a\r\nprobable total destruction.). I may be asked wherein this particular\r\ninterposition of providence appears, I answer, first, in the stupidity\r\nof the British general, in that he did not early on the morning of the\r\n20th send a detachment and take possession of the post and stores at\r\nWhiteplains, for had he done this we must then have fought him on his\r\nown terms, and such disadvantageous terms on our part, as humanly\r\nspeaking must have proved our overthrow; again when I parted with\r\nColo Reed on the 20th as before mentioned, I have always thought\r\nthat I was moved to so hazardous an undertaking by foreign influence.\r\nOn my route I was liable to meet with some British or tory parties,\r\nwho probably would have made me a prisoner (as I had no knowledge of\r\nany way of escape across the Brunx but the one I came out). Hence I\r\nwas induced to disguise myself by taking out my cockade, loping my hat\r\nand secreting my sword and pistols under my loose coat, and then had I\r\nbeen taken under this disguise, the probability is that I should have\r\nbeen hanged for a spy.\r\n\r\nOctober 29th, the British advanced in front of our lines at\r\nWhite-plains about 10 o'clock A.M., I had just arrived on Chatterton\r\nhill in order to throw up some works when they hove in sight, as soon\r\nas they discovered us they commenced a severe cannonade but without\r\nany effect of consequence. General McDougal about this time arriving\r\nwith his brigade from Burtis's and observing the British to be\r\ncrossing the Brunx below in large bodies in order to attack us, our\r\ntroops were posted to receive them in a very advantageous position.\r\nThe British in their advance were twice repulsed; at length however\r\ntheir numbers were increased so that they were able to turn our right\r\nflank. We lost many men but from information afterwards received there\r\nwas reason to believe they lost many more than we. The rail and stone\r\nfence behind which our troops were posted proved as fatal to the\r\nBritish as the rail fence and grass hung on it did at Charlestown the\r\n17th of June 1775.\r\n\r\nAfter the affair of the 29th of October my time was employed in\r\nexamining the nature of the country in a military point of view in our\r\nrear towards North Castle, Croton river, etc., until about the 5th of\r\nNovember when I received the following order from the General which I\r\nshall take the liberty to transcribe.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS WHITEPLAINS, November 5th 1776.\r\n\r\nSIR:--You are directed to repair to Wright's mills and lay out any\r\nwork there you conceive to be necessary, in case it is not already\r\ndone, from thence you are to proceed towards Croton bridge, and post\r\nthe two regiments of militia in the most advantageous manner, so as to\r\nobstruct the enemies passage to that quarter, you are also to give\r\nwhat directions you think are proper to those regiments, respecting\r\nthe breaking up the roads leading from the North river eastward, after\r\nthis you are to go up to Peekskill and direct Lasher's detachment to\r\nbreak up the roads there. You are likewise to lay out what works will\r\nbe advisable there and order them to be set about.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand--\r\n  GO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nTo Colo Putnam, Engineer.\r\n\r\nNovember 11th 1776, Genl Washington came to Peekskill and I went\r\nwith him to visit Fort Montgomery, on the same day or the next he\r\ncrossed the North river, leaving instructions with me to ascertain the\r\ngeography of the country with the roads and passes through and about\r\nthe highlands, a report of which I afterwards made with a sketch of a\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nDecember 8th 1776, I wrote to Genl Washington informing him that I\r\nhad accepted of a regiment in the Massachusetts line of the\r\nContinental army, with my reasons for so doing, assuring him at the\r\nsame time of my attachment to him and readiness to execute any\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n     [Original in the archives of Marietta College, Marietta,\r\n     Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 44.]\r\n\r\nSCATTERING ORDERS BY GENERALS LEE, SPENCER, GREENE AND NIXON\r\n\r\n[_Colonel Little's Order Book_]\r\n\r\nGENERAL SPENCER'S ORDERS.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, Sept. 8th.\r\n\r\nAll the guards in the posts are to be continued as large as at any\r\ntime, & be very vigilant & alert.

The\r\nRest of their Army are at Trenton, and upon the Banks of the River\r\nabove it; their numbers are uncertain, but are computed about twelve\r\nthousand, and as their Designs, are undoubtedly to gain Possession of\r\nthis City, the Congress, upon the advice of Genls Putnam and\r\nMifflin (who are now here to provide for the Protection of the\r\nPlace,) as well as the Result of their own Opinion, have adjourned\r\nthemselves to Baltimore in Maryland, about 110 miles from this City,\r\nas it was judged, that the Council of America, ought not to sit in a\r\nPlace liable to be interrupted by the rude Disorder of Arms, so that I\r\nam at this moment, going forward for that place. Whether the Army will\r\nsucceed in their cruel Designs against this City, must be left to time\r\nto discover. Congress have ordered the General to defend it to the\r\nlast extremity, and God grant that he may be successful in his\r\nExertions.\r\n\r\nWhatever Event may take place, the American Cause will be supported to\r\nthe last, and I trust in God that it will succeed. The Grecian, Roman\r\nand Dutch States were in their Infancy reduced to the greatest\r\nDistress, infinitely beyond what we have yet experienced. The God who\r\ngoverns the Universe and who holds Empires in His Hand, can with the\r\nleast Effort of His Will, grant us all that Security Opulence and\r\nPower which they have enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe present scene it is true appears somewhat gloomy, but the natural\r\nor more obvious cause seems to be owing to the term of enlistment of\r\nthe Army having expired. I hope we may have a most respectable one\r\nbefore long established. The business of war is the result of\r\nExperience.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that France before long will involve Great Britain in a\r\nwar who by unhappy Experience may learn the Folly of attempting to\r\nenslave a People who by the ties of Consanguinity and Affection ever\r\nwere desirous of promoting her truest Happiness.\r\n\r\nGen.

After we had\r\nrecruited a few days of a fatiguing March of more than 250 Miles\r\n(thro' all our Windings) Genl. Washington gave orders for us to be\r\nevery way equiped for Action. On the Evening of the 25th Ult. we were\r\nordered to March to a ferry [McConkey's] about twelve Miles from\r\nTrenton, where was stationed near two Thousand Hessians. As violent a\r\nStorm ensued of Hail & Snow as I ever felt. The Artillery and Infantry\r\nall were across the Ferry about twelve O'clock, consisting of only\r\ntwenty one hundred principally New England Troops. In this Violent\r\nStorm we marched on for Trenton. Before Light in the Morning we gained\r\nall the Roads leading from Trenton. The Genl. gave orders that every\r\nOfficer's Watch should be set by his, and the Moment of Attack was\r\nfixed. Just after Light, we came to their out Guard, which fired upon\r\nus and retreated. The first Sound of the Musquetry and Retreat of the\r\nGuards animated the Men and they pushed on with Resolution and\r\nFirmness. Happily the fire begun on every Side at the same instant,\r\ntheir Main body had just Time to form when there ensued a heavy\r\nCannonade from our Field Pieces and a fine brisk and lively fire from\r\nour Infantry. This continued but a Short Time before the Enemy finding\r\nthemselves flanked on every Side laid down their Arms. The Resolution\r\nand Bravery of our Men, their Order and Regulariety gave me the\r\nhighest Sensation of Pleasure. Genl. Washington highly congratulated\r\nthe Men on next day in Genl. Orders, and with Pleasure observed, that\r\nhe had been in Many Actions before, but always perceived some\r\nMisbehaviour in some individuals, but in that Action he saw none.\r\nPennsylvania itself is obliged to acknowledge the Bravery of New Eng'd\r\nTroops. I have a List from Head Quarters of the Killed and taken,\r\nwhich was taken the day after the Action, since which many more have\r\nbeen brought in: 1 Col. wounded since dead, 2 Lieut. Cols. taken, 3\r\nMajors, 4 Capts. 8 Lieuts., 12 Ens'ns, 92 Serj'ts, 9 Musicians, 12\r\nDrums, 25 Servants, 842 Privates, 2 Capt's Killed, 2 Lieuts. killed 50\r\nprivates Six Brass Field Pieces, One Mortar, and about 1500 Stand of\r\nArms. A large Number of Horses and a vast Quantity of Plunder of every\r\nkind. And this, Sir, I will assure you with only the Loss of six or\r\nseven on our side, this is no Exaggeration but simple fact, 'tis\r\nimpossible to describe the scene to you as it appeared. We immediately\r\nretreated across the River and did not get to our Tents till next\r\nMorning--two Nights and one day in as violent a Storm as I ever felt.\r\nWhat can't Men do when engaged in so noble a Cause. Our Men's Time\r\nExpired Yesterday, they have generally engaged to tarry six weeks\r\nlonger. My company almost to a man. Orders have now come for us to\r\nmarch for Princetown. We have a Rumor that it was burned last night by\r\nthe Enemy, who we suppose are about retreating. Compliments to Miss\r\nAdams & Children. Adieu and believe me to be sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nWM.

Munsell, Albany. 1875.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 49.]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL KNOX TO HIS WIFE\r\n\r\nDELAWARE RIVER, NEAR TRENTON,\r\n  Dec. 28, 1776, near 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\n... Trenton is an open town, situated nearly on the banks of the\r\nDelaware, accessible on all sides. Our army was scattered along the\r\nriver for nearly twenty-five miles. Our intelligence agreed that the\r\nforce of the enemy in Trenton was from two to three thousand, with\r\nabout six field cannon, and that they were pretty secure in their\r\nsituation, and that they were Hessians--no British troops. A hardy\r\ndesign was formed of attacking the town by storm. Accordingly a part\r\nof the army, consisting of about 2,500 or 3,000, passed the river on\r\nChristmas night, with almost infinite difficulty, with eighteen\r\nfield-pieces. The floating ice in the river made the labor almost\r\nincredible. However, perseverance accomplished what at first seemed\r\nimpossible. About two o'clock the troops were all on the Jersey side;\r\nwe then were about nine miles from the object. The night was cold and\r\nstormy; it hailed with great violence; the troops marched with the\r\nmost profound silence and good order. They arrived by two routes at\r\nthe same time, about half an hour after daylight, within one mile of\r\nthe town. The storm continued with great violence, but was in our\r\nbacks, and consequently in the faces of our enemy. About half a mile\r\nfrom the town was an advanced guard on each road, consisting of a\r\ncaptains guard. These we forced, and entered the town with them\r\npell-mell; and here succeeded a scene of war of which I had often\r\nconceived, but never saw before. The hurry, fright, and confusion of\r\nthe enemy was [not] unlike that which will be when the last trump\r\nshall sound. They endeavored to form in streets, the heads of which we\r\nhad previously the possession of with cannon and howitzers; these, in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye, cleared the streets. The backs of the houses\r\nwere resorted to for shelter. These proved ineffectual; the musketry\r\nsoon dislodged them. Finally they were driven through the town into an\r\nopen plain beyond. Here they formed in an instant. During the contest\r\nin the streets measures were taken for putting an entire stop to their\r\nretreat by posting troops and cannon in such passes and roads as it\r\nwas possible for them to get away by. The poor fellows after they were\r\nformed on the plain saw themselves completely surrounded, the only\r\nresource left was to force their way through numbers unknown to them.\r\nThe Hessians lost part of their cannon in the town; they did not\r\nrelish the project of forcing, and were obliged to surrender upon the\r\nspot, with all their artillery, six brass pieces, army colors, &c. A\r\nColonel Rawle commanded, who was wounded. The number of prisoners was\r\nabove 1,200, including officers,--all Hessians. There were few killed\r\nor wounded on either side. After having marched off the prisoners and\r\nsecured the cannon, stores, &c, we returned to the place, nine miles\r\ndistant, where we had embarked. Providence seemed to have smiled upon\r\nevery part of this enterprise. Great advantages may be gained from it\r\nif we take the proper steps. At another post we have pushed over the\r\nriver 2,000 men, to-day another body, and to-morrow the whole army\r\nwill follow. It must give a sensible pleasure to every friend of the\r\nrights of man to think with how much intrepidity our people pushed the\r\nenemy, and prevented their forming in the town.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the General has done me the unmerited great honor of\r\nthanking me in public orders in terms strong and polite. This I should\r\nblush to mention to any other than to you, my dear Lucy; and I am\r\nfearful that even my Lucy may think her Harry possesses a species of\r\nlittle vanity in doing [it] at all.\r\n\r\nMORRISTOWN Jan. 7 1777.\r\n\r\nI wrote to you from Trenton by a Mr. Furness which I hope you have\r\nreceived. I then informed you that we soon expected another tussle. I\r\nwas not out in my conjecture. About three o'clock on the second of\r\nJanuary, a column of the enemy attacked a party of ours which was\r\nstationed one mile above Trenton. Our party was small and did not make\r\nmuch resistance. The enemy, who were Hessians, entered the town\r\npell-mell pretty much in the same manner that we had driven them a few\r\ndays before.\r\n\r\nNearly on the other side of Trenton, partly in the town, runs a brook\r\n[the Assanpink], which in most places is not fordable, and over which\r\nthrough Trenton is a bridge. The ground on the other side is much\r\nhigher than on this, and may be said to command Trenton completely.\r\nHere it was our army drew up with thirty or forty pieces in front. The\r\nenemy pushed our small party through the town with vigor, though not\r\nwith much loss. Their retreat over the bridge was thoroughly secured\r\nby the artillery. After they had retired over the bridge, the enemy\r\nadvanced within reach of our cannon, who saluted them with great\r\nvociferation and some execution. This continued till dark when of\r\ncourse it ceased, except a few shells which we now and then chucked\r\ninto town to prevent their enjoying their new quarters securely. As I\r\nbefore mentioned, the creek was in our front, our left on the\r\nDelaware, our right in a wood parallel to the creek. The situation was\r\nstrong, to be sure; but hazardous on this account, that had our right\r\nwing been defeated, the defeat of the left would almost have been an\r\ninevitable consequence, and the whole thrown into confusion or pushed\r\ninto the Delaware, as it was impassable by boats.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances the general thought best to attack\r\nPrinceton, twelve miles in the rear of the enemy's grand army, and\r\nwhere they had the 17th, 40th, and 55th regiments, with a number of\r\ndraughts, altogether perhaps twelve hundred men. Accordingly about one\r\no'clock at night we began to march and make this most extra\r\nmanoevre. Our troops marched with great silence and order, and\r\narrived near Princeton a little after daybreak. We did not surprise\r\nthem as at Trenton; for they were on their march down to Trenton, on a\r\nroad about a quarter of a mile distant from that in which we were. You\r\nmay judge of their surprise when they saw such large columns marching\r\nup. They could not possibly suppose it was our army, for that they\r\ntook for granted was cooped up near Trenton. They could not possibly\r\nsuppose it was their own array returning by a back road; in short, I\r\nbelieve they were as much astonished as if an army had dropped\r\nperpendicularly upon them. However they had not much time for\r\nconsideration. We pushed a party to attack them. This they repulsed\r\nwith great spirit, and advanced upon another column just then coming\r\nout of a wood, which they likewise put in some disorder; but fresh\r\ntroops coming up, and the artillery beginning to play, they were after\r\na smart resistance put totally to the rout. The 18th regiment used\r\ntheir bayonets with too much severity upon a party they put to flight;\r\nbut they were paid for it in proportion, very few escaping. Near sixty\r\nwere killed on the spot besides the wounded. We have taken between\r\nthree and four hundred prisoners, all British troops. They must have\r\nlost in this affair nearly five hundred killed, wounded, and\r\nprisoners. We lost some gallant officers. Brigadier-General Mercer was\r\nwounded: he had three separate stabs with a bayonet. A Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nFleming was killed, and Captain Neil of the artillery an excellent\r\nofficer. Mercer will get better. The enemy took his parole after we\r\nleft Princeton. We took all their cannon, which consisted of two brass\r\nsix-pounders, a considerable amount of military stores, blankets,\r\nguns, &c. They lost, among a number of other officers, a Captain\r\nLeslie, a son of the Earl of Leven and nephew to General Leslie: him\r\nwe brought off and buried with honors of war.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been about two hours at Princeton, word was brought that\r\nthe enemy was advancing from Trenton. This they did, as we have since\r\nbeen informed, in a most infernal sweat,--running, puffing, and\r\nblowing, and swearing at being so outwitted. As we had other objects\r\nin view, to wit, breaking up their quarters, we pursued our march to\r\nSomerset Court House, where there were about thirteen hundred\r\nquartered, as we had been informed. They, however, had marched off,\r\nand joined the army at Trenton. We at first intended to have made a\r\nforced march to Brunswick; but our men having been without rest, rum,\r\nor provisions for two nights and days were unequal to the task of\r\nmarching seventeen miles further. If we could have secured one\r\nthousand fresh men at Princeton to have pushed for Brunswick, we\r\nshould have struck one of the most brilliant strokes in all history.\r\nHowever the advantages are very great: already they have collected\r\ntheir whole force, and drawn themselves to one point, to wit,\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were within nineteen miles of Philadelphia, they are now\r\nsixty miles. We have driven them from almost the whole of West Jersey.\r\nThe panic is still kept up. We had a battle two days ago with a party\r\nof ours and sixty Waldeckers, who were all killed or taken, in\r\nMonmouth County in the lower part of the Jerseys. It is not our\r\ninterest to fight a general battle, nor can I think, under all\r\ncircumstances, it is the enemy's. They have sent their baggage to\r\nStaten Island from the Jerseys, and we are very well informed they are\r\ndoing the same from New York. Heath will have orders to march there\r\nand endeavor to storm it from that side. 'There is a tide in the\r\naffairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to victory.'\r\n\r\n     [_Life, etc. of General Knox._ By Francis S. Drake.

HASLET TO CÆSAR RODNEY\r\n\r\nALLENTOWN January 2nd 1777.\r\n\r\nThis morning we were called up at 2 o'clock under a pretended alarm\r\nthat we were to be attacked by the enemy but by daylight we were\r\nordered to march for Trenton, and when we reached Crosswicks found\r\nthat the brigade had gone. We reached Trenton about 11 o'clock and\r\nfound all the troops from our different posts in Jersey, collected and\r\ncollecting there under General Washington himself; and the regular\r\ntroops were already properly disposed to receive the enemy, whose main\r\nbody was then within a few miles and determined to dispossess us.\r\n\r\nTrenton stands upon the River Delaware, with a creek called the\r\nAssanpink passing through the town across which there is a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe enemy came down on the upper side of this creek, through the town,\r\nand a number of our troops were posted with Riflemen and artillery to\r\noppose their approach.\r\n\r\nThe main body of our army was drawn up on a plain below, or on the\r\nlower side of the Assanpink, near the bridge, and the main force of\r\nour Artillery was posted on the banks and high ground along the creek\r\nin front of them.\r\n\r\nGen. Mercer's brigade was posted about 2 miles up the creek, and the\r\ntroops under Gen. Cadwallader were stationed in a field on the right\r\nabout a mile from the town, on the main road, to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom flanking. We had five pieces of Artillery with our division and\r\nabout 20 more in the field, near, and at the town. Our numbers were\r\nabout five thousand, and the enemy's about seven thousand. The attack\r\nbegan about 2 o'clock and a heavy fire upon both sides, chiefly from\r\nthe artillery continued untill dark.\r\n\r\nAt this time the enemy were left in possession of the upper part of\r\nthe town, but we kept possession of the bridge, altho' the enemy\r\nattempted several times to carry it but were repulsed each time with\r\ngreat slaughter. After sunset this afternoon the enemy came down in a\r\nvery heavy column to force the bridge. The fire was very heavy and the\r\nLight troops were ordered to fly to the support of that important\r\npost, and as we drew near, I stepped out of the front to order my men\r\nto close up; at this time Martinas Sipple was about 10 sets behind the\r\nman next in front of him; I at once drew my sword and threatened to\r\ncut his head off if he did not keep close, he then sprang forward and\r\nI returned to the front. The enemy were soon defeated and retired and\r\nthe American army also retired to the woods, where they encamped and\r\nbuilt up fires. I then had the roll called to see if any of our men\r\nwere missing and Martinas was not to be found, but Leut. Mark McCall\r\ninformed me that immediately upon my returning to the head of the\r\ncolumn, after making him close up, he fled out of the field.[246] We\r\nlost but few men; the enemy considerably more. It is thought Gen.\r\nWashington did not intend to hold the upper part of the town.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: Sipple afterwards joined the Delaware Regiment under\r\nCol.

He was with\r\nCadwallader's force during the battle of Trenton; and his vivid\r\ndescription of the storm that night, and the condition of the river\r\n[_Force_, fifth series, vol. iii.], has frequently been quoted by\r\nhistorical writers. His interesting account of subsequent events, as\r\ngiven above, is now published for the first time. It has been made the\r\nsubject of a highly interesting paper prepared and read by Cæsar A.\r\nRodney, Esq., of Wilmington, before the Historical Societies of\r\nDelaware and Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 3rd 1777.\r\n\r\n... At two o'clock this morning, the ground having been frozen firm by\r\na keen N. West wind, secret orders were issued to each department and\r\nthe whole army was at once put in motion, but no one knew what the\r\nGen. meant to do. Some thought that we were going to attack the enemy\r\nin the rear; some that we were going to Princeton; the latter proved\r\nto be right. We went by a bye road on the right hand which made it\r\nabout 16 miles. During this nocturnal march I with the Dover Company\r\nand the Red Feather Company of Philadelphia Light Infantry led the van\r\nof the army and Capt. Henry with the other three companies of\r\nPhiladelphia Light Infantry brought up the rear. The van moved on all\r\nnight in the most cool and determined order, but on the march great\r\nconfusion happened in the rear. There was a cry that they were\r\nsurrounded by the Hessians, and several corps of Militia broke and\r\nfled towards Bordentown, but the rest of the column remained firm and\r\npursued their march without disorder, but those who were frightened\r\nand fled did not recover from their panic until they reached\r\nBurlington.\r\n\r\nWhen we had proceeded to within a mile and a half of Princeton and the\r\nvan had crossed Stony Brook, Gen. Washington ordered our Infantry to\r\nfile off to one side of the road and halt. Gen. Sullivan was ordered\r\nto wheel to the right and flank the town on that side, and two\r\nBrigades were ordered to wheel to the left, to make a circuit and\r\nsurround the town on that side and as they went to break down the\r\nBridge and post a party at the mill on the main road, to oppose the\r\nenemy's main army if they should pursue us from Trenton.\r\n\r\nThe third Division was composed of Gen. Mercer's Brigade of\r\nContinental troops, about 300 men, and Cadwalader's brigade of\r\nPhiladelphia Militia to which brigade the whole of our light Infantry\r\nRegiment was again annexed.\r\n\r\nMercer's brigade marched in front and another corp of infantry brought\r\nup the rear. My company flanked the whole brigade on the right in an\r\nIndian file so that my men were very much extended and distant from\r\neach other; I marched in front and was followed by Sargeant McKnatt\r\nand next to him was Nehemiah Tilton. Mercer's brigade which was headed\r\nby Col. Haslet of Delaware on foot and Gen. Mercer on horseback was to\r\nmarch straight on to Princeton without turning to the right or left.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that two Regiments of British troops that were on their\r\nmarch to Trenton to reinforce their army there, received intelligence\r\nof the movements of the American Army (for the sun rose as we passed\r\nover Stony Brook) and about a mile from Princeton they turned off from\r\nthe main road and posted themselves behind a long string of buildings\r\nand an orchard on the straight road to Princeton.\r\n\r\nThe two first Divisions of our army therefore passed wide to the right\r\nand left, and leaving them undiscovered went into Princeton. Gen.\r\nMercer's Brigade, owing to some delay in arranging Cadwallader's men\r\nhad advanced several hundred yards ahead and never discovered the\r\nenemy until he was turning the buildings they were posted behind, and\r\nthen they were not more than fifty yards off.\r\n\r\nHe immediately formed his men, with great courage, and poured a heavy\r\nfire in upon the enemy. But they being greatly superior in number\r\nreturned the fire and charged bayonets, and their onset was so fierce\r\nthat Gen. Mercer fell mortally wounded and many of his officers were\r\nkilled, and the brigade being effectually broken up, began a\r\ndisorderly flight. Col. Haslet retired some small distance behind the\r\nbuildings and endeavored to rally them, but receiving a bullet through\r\nhis head, dropt dead on the spot and the whole brigade fled in\r\nconfusion. At this instant Gen. Cadwallader's Philadelphia Brigade\r\ncame up and the enemy checked by their appearance took post behind a\r\nfence, and a ditch in front of the buildings before mentioned, and so\r\nextended themselves that every man could load and fire incessantly;\r\nthe fence stood on low ground between two hills; on the hill behind\r\nthe British line they had eight pieces of artillery which played\r\nincessantly with round and grape shot on our brigade, and the fire\r\nwas extremely hot. Yet Gen. Cadwalader led up the head of the column\r\nwith the greatest bravery to within 50 yards of the enemy, but this\r\nwas rashly done, for he was obliged to recoil; and leaving one piece\r\nof his artillery, he fell back about 40 yards and endeavored to form\r\nthe brigade, and some companies did form and gave a few vollies, but\r\nthe fire of the enemy was so hot, that, at the sight of the Regular\r\ntroops running to the rear, the militia gave way and the whole brigade\r\nbroke and most of them retired to a woods about 150 yards in the rear;\r\nbut two pieces of artillery stood their ground and were served with\r\ngreat skill and bravery.\r\n\r\nAt this time a field officer was sent to order me to take post on the\r\nleft of the artillery, until the brigade should form again, and, with\r\nthe Philadelphia Infantry keep up a fire from some stacks and\r\nbuildings, and to assist the artillery in preventing the enemy from\r\nadvancing. We now crossed the enemy's fire from right to Left and took\r\nposition behind some stacks just on the left of the artillery; and\r\nabout 30 of the Philadelphia Infantry were under cover of a house on\r\nour left and a little in the rear.\r\n\r\nAbout 150 of my men came to this post, but I could not keep them all\r\nthere, for the enemies fire was dreadful and three balls, for they\r\nwere very thick, had grazed me; one passed within my elbow nicking my\r\ngreat coat and carried away the breech of Sargeant McKnatts gun, he\r\nbeing close behind me, another carried away the inside edge of one of\r\nmy shoe soles, another had nicked my hat and indeed they seemed as\r\nthick as hail. From these stacks and buildings we, with the two pieces\r\nof Artillery kept up a continuous fire on the enemy, and in all\r\nprobability it was this circumstance that prevented the enemy from\r\nadvancing, for they could not tell the number we had posted behind\r\nthese covers and were afraid to attempt passing them; but if they had\r\nknown how few they were they might easily have advanced while the two\r\nbrigades were in confusion and routed the whole body, for it was a\r\nlong time before they could be reorganized again and indeed many, that\r\nwere panic struck, ran quite off. Gen. Washington having rallied both\r\nGen. Mercer's and Gen. Cadwallader's brigade, they moved forward and\r\nwhen they came to where the Artillery stood began a very heavy platoon\r\nfire on the march. This the enemy bore but a few minutes and then\r\nthrew down their arms and ran. We then pushed forwards towards the\r\ntown spreading over the fields and through the woods to enclose the\r\nenemy and take prisoners. The fields were covered with baggage which\r\nthe Gen. ordered to be taken care of. Our whole force met at the Court\r\nHouse and took there about 200 prisoners and about 200 others pushed\r\noff and were pursued by advanced parties who took about 50 more. In\r\nthis engagement we lost about 20 killed, the enemy about 100 men\r\nkilled and lost the field. This is a very pretty little town on the\r\nYork road 12 miles from Trenton; the houses are built of brick and are\r\nvery elegant especially the College which has 52 rooms in it; but the\r\nwhole town has been ravaged and ruined by the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy's main army heard our cannon at Princeton (and\r\nnot 'til then) they discovered our manouvre and pushed after us with\r\nall speed and we had not been above an hour in possession of the town\r\nbefore the enemy's light horse and advanced parties attacked our party\r\nat the bridge, but our people by a very heavy fire kept the pass until\r\nour whole army left the town. Just as our army began our march through\r\nPrincetown with all their prisoners and spoils the van of the British\r\narmy we had left at Trenton came in sight, and entered the town about\r\nan hour after we left it, but made no stay and pushed on towards\r\nBrunswick for fear we should get there before him, which was indeed\r\nthe course our General intended to pursue had he not been detained too\r\nlong in collecting the Baggage and Artillery which the enemy had left\r\nbehind him. Our army marched on to Kingston then wheeled to the left\r\nand went down the Millstone, keeping that River on our left; the main\r\nbody of the British army followed, but kept on through Kingston to\r\nBrunswick; but one division or a strong party of horse took the road\r\nto the left of the Millstone and arrived on the hill, at the bridge on\r\nthat road just as the van of the American Army arrived on the opposite\r\nside. I was again commanding the van of our army, and General\r\nWashington seeing the enemy, rode forward and ordered me to halt and\r\ntake down a number of carpenters which he had ordered forward and\r\nbreak up the bridge, which was done and the enemy were obliged to\r\nreturn. We then marched on to a little village called Stone brook or\r\nSummerset Court House about 15 miles from Princeton where we arrived\r\njust at dusk. About an hour before we arrived here 150 of the enemy\r\nfrom Princeton and 50 which were stationed in this town went off with\r\n20 wagons laden with Clothing and Linen, and 400 of the Jersey militia\r\nwho surrounded them were afraid to fire on them and let them go off\r\nunmolested and there were no troops in our army fresh enough to\r\npursue them, or the whole might have been taken in a few hours. Our\r\narmy now was extremely fatigued not having had any refreshment since\r\nyesterday morning, and our baggage had all been sent away the morning\r\nof the action at Trenton; yet they are in good health and in high\r\nspirits....\r\n\r\nMORRISTOWN January 6th 1777.\r\n\r\nWe left Pluckemin this morning and arrived at Morristown just before\r\nsunset. The order of march, was first a small advance guard, next the\r\nofficers who were prisoners, next my Light Infantry Regiment, in\r\ncolumns of four deep; next the prisoners flanked by the riflemen, next\r\nthe head of the main column, with the artillery in front. Our whole\r\nLight Infantry are quartered in a very large house belonging to Col.\r\nFord having 4 Rooms on a floor and Two stories high. This town is\r\nsituated among the mountains of Morris County, about 18 miles from\r\nElizabethtown, 28 from Brunswick and 20 from Carroll's Ferry.\r\n\r\n     [Originals in possession of Cæsar A.

Howe's army on the 6th\r\nof January, 1777, from an authentic account.\r\n\r\nAt New York.--The first brigade of British consisting of the 4th,\r\n15th, 27th, and 45th regiments; a squadron of light dragoons of the\r\n17th; and three Hessian regiments, viz. Hereditary Prince, Cassel and\r\nDonop.\r\n\r\nAt Harlem.--The sixth brigade, British, consisting of the 23d, 44th,\r\nand 6th regiments, and a brigade of Hessians.\r\n\r\nAt Amboy.--33d and 71st Regiments, and remains of 7th and 16th [?]\r\nregiments; a detachment of dragoons, and the Waldeck regiment.\r\n\r\nAt Brunswick.--The guards, grenadiers, and light infantry. Second\r\nbrigade, British, consisting of the 5th, 28th, 35th, and 49th\r\nregiments. Fourth brigade, British, consisting of the 17th, 40th,\r\n46th, and 55th regiments, and the 42 regiment, which is not brigaded.\r\nAlso Donop's corps, Hessian grenadiers, and chasseurs.\r\n\r\nAt Bergen.--The 57th regiment, ordered to Amboy, and preparing to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\nAt Rhode Island.--Third and fifth brigades of British, consisting of\r\nthe 10th, 37th, 38th, and 52d; of the 22d, 43d, 54th, and 63d\r\nregiments; a battalion of grenadiers, and one of light infantry; a\r\ntroop of light dragoons; a detachment of artillery, and two brigades\r\nof Hessians.\r\n\r\nThis account shews clearly what places Gen. Howe is in possession of,\r\nand what he is not; that in Jersey he has only Brunswick and Amboy,\r\nand in New York only York city and Harlem. All other places are in\r\npossession of the Americans, who seem by the last accounts to be\r\nendeavoring to cut off the troops at Brunswick.\"\r\n\r\n     [_London Chronicle_, March 1-4, 1777.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURNS AND STATEMENTS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nPRISONERS.\r\n\r\n1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[No. 53.]\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF LIEUT.

Sept. the 15th. I am as\r\nhearty as the time will admit. The Generals who were taken on Long\r\nIsland are Genl Sullivan, Lord Sterling. They were taken the 27th\r\nof Augt. 1776. That day there were twenty-three thousand of the King's\r\ntroops on Long Island and about twenty-six hundred of the Continental\r\ntroops against them which was suffered very much. Sept. 22d. We\r\nsailed from below the Narrows up near New York and there we ---- the\r\n23d day. There was some firing from the Rowbuck & another small\r\nvessel against our work on Paulus Hook which continued about half an\r\nhour. Col. Miles got leave to go to Philadelphia this 26th of November\r\n1776, from New York where he was prisoner. The 7th of October we all\r\nleft the Snow Mentor and were taken into New York and was put into a\r\nclose house there. All the officers signed their parole this day & got\r\na small bound to walk round to stretch their legs, which we found\r\ngrateful.

JAMES MORRIS, PRISONER AT FLATBUSH,\r\nL.I.[251]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: Captain James Morris was a Connecticut officer. He\r\nfirst entered the service as ensign in Colonel Gay's Regiment, and was\r\nengaged in the battle of Long Island. In the following year, as\r\nlieutenant, he fought at the battle of Germantown, where he was taken\r\nprisoner, and closely confined in Philadelphia until removed to Long\r\nIsland. When released, in 1781, he was detailed to Scammell's Light\r\nInfantry Corps, and took part in the capture of Yorktown, Virginia.\r\nOne of his letters, written from Flatbush while prisoner, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFLATBUSH, LONG ISLAND, June 30, 1778.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 17th inst., the American Prisoners of war left\r\nPhiladelphia. I embarked on board the Sloop Nancy, Capt. Hill. Sailed\r\nas far as Billings Port; then went on board the Brig Minerva, Capt.\r\nSmith, in order to sail for New York. After a passage of 12 days\r\narrived at New York, being the 28th inst. The 29th I was paroled upon\r\nLong Island, and went to live at the House of Mr. John Lott. Our\r\ntreatment, both officers and soldiers, while on board the shipping,\r\nwas much better than I expected; our situation was as agreeable as\r\ncircumstances would admit. We had the liberty of any part of the ship,\r\nand both officers and soldiers had a supply of provisions and a gill\r\nof Rum per man per day.]\r\n\r\n\"I was put on board with the other prisoners of war [at Philadelphia]\r\nand sailed down the river Delaware, and went to New York. We were 12\r\ndays on our passage. I was then put on my parole of honour and boarded\r\nwith a plain Dutch family in Kings County, at the west end of Long\r\nIsland. We were confined within the limits of said County.\r\n\r\nAt Flat Bush I became acquainted with a Mr Clarkson a man of\r\nscience and of a large property, he owned the most extensive private\r\nLibrary that I had ever known in the United States, his wife had a\r\ncapacious mind and she was remarkably distinguished for her piety. Mr.\r\nClarkson made me a welcome visitor at his house and gave me access to\r\nhis library. He allowed me to take as many books as I chose and carry\r\nthem to my lodgings. I there lived two years and six months devoting\r\nmy time to reading. I read through a course of ancient and modern\r\nhistory. My exercise was hand labour and walking. I tended a garden\r\none summer upon shares and my net profits were about twelve dollars.\r\nThe next summer I obtained the use of a small piece of Land and\r\nplanted it with potatoes from which my net profits were 30 dollars. I\r\nwas treated with great kindness by the family with which I lived. I\r\nendeavored to be always on the pleasant side with them and to be sure,\r\nnot to be wanting in my attentions to my landlady. Here I learned that\r\nthe little nameless civilities and attentions were worth a great deal\r\nmore than they cost me. Here I was peculiarily situated to learn the\r\nhuman character: for the inhabitants in this county were all attached\r\nto the British Government and said the officers paroled there were all\r\nrebels, and that they would finally be hung for their rebellion, so\r\nthat if any of us received any injury or met with any abuse from the\r\ninhabitants we could have no redress we must patiently bear it. The\r\nDutch inhabitants were uncultivated yet many of them possessed\r\nstrength of mind and were intelligent. They were mostly strangers to\r\nthe sympathies and tender sensibilities which so much rejoiced the\r\nheart of friends with friends and promote the happiness of society.\r\nBut notwithstanding I was thus secluded from my particular friends\r\nand acquaintances yet I enjoyed my share of comfort and worldly\r\nfelicity. I felt no disposition to murmer and repine in my then\r\ncondition. Every day afforded me its enjoyments excepting a time when\r\nI had a pretty severe attack with the ague and fever which reduced me\r\nlow. The whole term of my Captivity was three years and three months\r\nlacking one day. I was exchanged on the 3rd day of Jany 1781. I was\r\ntaken from Flat Bush to New York and from thence conveyed to\r\nElizabethtown in New Jersey and set at liberty.\"\r\n\r\n     [Original in possession of Hon.

General Lee was born in Wales, had served in the\r\nBritish army, and settled in Virginia. General De Fermoy was a\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\nCALLENDER, CAPTAIN JOHN.--This officer, who behaved so well on Long\r\nIsland, was the son of Eliezer Callender, of Boston. At the close of\r\nthe war he became a merchant in Virginia, and died at Alexandria, in\r\nOctober, 1797.\r\n\r\nCLARK, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOEL.--Lieutenant Fitch states that Clark,\r\nwho commanded Huntington's regiment at the battle of Long Island, and\r\nwas taken prisoner, died about one o'clock on the morning of December\r\n19th, after a long sickness, and was buried in the New Brick\r\nChurch-yard [now Park Row], in New York. Officers followed his remains\r\nto the grave.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS, COLONEL WILLIAM.--Born in Plainfield, Conn., January 17th,\r\n1742. Afterwards lived in Northford. Served as Putnam's\r\norderly-sergeant in the French and Indian War. In 1775 joined\r\nMontgomery, who put him in charge of the flotilla on Lake Champlain,\r\nin view of his nautical experience. In 1776 he raised a regiment for\r\nthe army at New York, where, as appears in the narrative, he proved\r\nhimself a thorough soldier. In 1777 he raised a Continental regiment,\r\nbut his health broke down, and he died May 28th of that year. His\r\ndeath was a loss to the service, as he was a man of faith, character,\r\nand personal courage. The regiment he raised was given to the famous\r\nColonel Return Jonathan Meigs.\r\n\r\nDUNSCOMB, LIEUTENANT EDWARD.--Born May 23d, 1754, in New York. Died\r\nNovember 12th, 1814. Graduate of Columbia College in 1774. He was son\r\nof Daniel Dunscomb, a firm friend of the colonial cause. After his\r\ncapture at the Jamaica Pass, August 27th, he was confined on a prison\r\nship and fell sick, but recovered, and on his exchange rejoined the\r\narmy, where, in 1780, he appears as Captain of the Fourth New York\r\nLine. After the war he became clerk of the United States Courts. He\r\nwas also a vestryman of Trinity Church, and a trustee of Columbia\r\nCollege. The tradition in his family is that he was asked to be\r\nHamilton's second in the duel with Burr, but declined in disapproval\r\nof the practice.\r\n\r\nFISH, MAJOR NICHOLAS.--Born in New York, August 28th, 1758; died June\r\n20th, 1833. He was at Princeton a short time, but leaving college,\r\nstudied law with John Morin Scott, whose brigade-major he became in\r\n1776. Fish afterwards served with the New York Line through the war,\r\nand as major of light infantry under Hamilton at Yorktown. In 1786 he\r\nbecame adjutant-general of New York, was afterwards an alderman of the\r\ncity and president of the Cincinnati. He was the father of the Hon.\r\nHamilton Fish, ex-Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGAY, COLONEL FISHER.--Of Wadsworth's brigade. He came from Farmington,\r\nConn., having served also at the siege of Boston. His regiment was for\r\nsome time on Long Island, but the colonel had been sick, and either\r\ndied or was buried on the day of the battle, August 27th.\r\n\r\nHALE, CAPTAIN NATHAN.--The most authoritative account of his capture\r\nand death is given by Hull, who was captain with him in Webb's\r\nregiment. Lossing states that he was hanged from an apple-tree in\r\nRutgers' orchard. Hale was a young graduate of Yale; came from\r\nAshford, Conn. The sketch of his life by I.W. Stuart, Hartford, 1856,\r\ncontains the particulars of his career. See page 262, Part I.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON, CAPTAIN ALEXANDER.--See chapter on \"The Two Armies.\"\r\nHamilton was stationed in New York at the Grand Battery and Fort\r\nGeorge, and doubtless participated in the firing on the ships whenever\r\nthey passed up either river. At White Plains his guns did good\r\nexecution, also in the subsequent actions in New Jersey. In March,\r\n1777, he became aid to Washington with rank of lieutenant-colonel, and\r\nparticularly distinguished himself at Monmouth, and afterwards as\r\ncommander of a light infantry battalion at Yorktown. He had few if any\r\nsuperiors among the younger officers of the Revolutionary army.\r\n\r\nHENSHAW, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WILLIAM.--Born at Boston February 20th,\r\n1735, and removed to Leicester in 1745. He served in the French war\r\nunder Amherst. The Lexington alarm he answered promptly, and marched\r\nto Boston at the head of his militia regiment. The Massachusetts\r\nProvincial Congress appointed him adjutant-general of the army\r\nmustered around Boston, and he held that position until relieved by\r\nGeneral Gates in July. He was actively engaged through the entire\r\ncampaign in 1776, being in the midst of the fighting on Long Island,\r\nat Harlem Heights, and at Princeton. At the close of the campaign he\r\nretired from the service. A full and interesting sketch of him,\r\ntogether with his Order Book of 1775, has lately been published by the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society. Colonel Henshaw died February 20th,\r\n1820.\r\n\r\nHUGHES, COLONEL HUGH.--Of Welsh extraction. Taught a select grammar\r\nschool, in 1765, in the French Church Consistory Rooms in Nassau\r\nStreet, New York. He served most efficiently in the quartermaster's\r\ndepartment during much of the war, and died in 1802, seventy-five\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nJOHNSTON, CAPTAIN JOHN.--After partially recovering from his severe\r\nwounds received at the battle of Long Island, Captain Johnston took up\r\nthe artist's profession, and painted several historical portraits,\r\namong them that of Samuel Adams and his wife. He also painted his own,\r\nwhich is in possession of his grandson, Mr. J.J. Soren, of Boston.\r\n\r\nKNOWLTON, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL.--Born in West Boxford, Mass., November,\r\n1740, and removed to Ashford, Conn. He served in the French war as\r\nprivate in Captain Durkee's company. A full and accurate sketch of him\r\nmay be found in the _New England Historical and Gen. Register_ for\r\nJanuary, 1861, by Ashbel Woodward, M.D., of Franklin, Conn.\r\n\r\nLASHER, COLONEL JOHN.--Born March 3d, 1724, probably in New York. A\r\nmerchant of some wealth. He lost four houses in the fire of September\r\n21st, 1776. On the expiration of the term of service of his battalion,\r\nhe was elected a lieutenant-colonel of one of the New York Continental\r\nregiments, but declined. He died in New York at an advanced age. See\r\nreferences to him in the chapter on \"The Two Armies.\"\r\n\r\nLITTLE, COLONEL MOSES.--Frequently mentioned in the account of the\r\ncampaign. He was one of the \"Descendants of George Little, who came to\r\nNewbury, Mass., in 1640\"--the title of a handsome little work compiled\r\nby Mr. George T. Little, and printed in 1877. During the retreat\r\nthrough New Jersey, Colonel Little was sick at Peekskill, and could\r\nnot participate with his men at Trenton and Princeton. He rendered\r\nfurther service at various times during the war.\r\n\r\nMcDOUGALL, GENERAL ALEXANDER.--Born in Scotland in 1731; died in New\r\nYork, June 8th, 1786. It is understood that a biography of this\r\nofficer is in the course of preparation. As he was so closely\r\nidentified with the Revolutionary struggle, it could be made a\r\nvaluable work, if his papers are all preserved. He was a leader of New\r\nYork's \"Liberty\" party before 1776, and served continuously through\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nMILES, COLONEL SAMUEL.--Born March 22d, 1739, probably in\r\nPhiladelphia. Served in the French war. After the Revolution, held\r\npositions as Judge of the High Court of Errors, member of the\r\nGovernor's Council, and Mayor of Philadelphia. He died at Cheltenham,\r\nMontgomery County, Pa., December 29th, 1805.\r\n\r\nPARRY, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL CALEB.--Killed on Long Island. See notice of\r\nhim on page 196, Part I. A genealogy recently prepared by Richard\r\nRandolph Parry, Esq., of Philadelphia, contains much interesting\r\npersonal history of the family.\r\n\r\nPIPER, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JAMES.--He was lieutenant-colonel of Miles'\r\nFirst Battalion, and \"a very worthy gentleman.\" Taken on Long Island,\r\nand died in New York not long after the battle. Captain Peebles, of\r\nMiles', Captain Bowie and Lieutenant Butler, of Smallwood's, and\r\nLieutenant Makepeace, of Huntington's, who were all wounded and taken\r\nprisoners, died afterwards in New York, says Fitch.\r\n\r\nRUTGERS, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL HENRY.--Of New York City. Brother of\r\nHarmanus Rutgers, killed on Long Island. He was connected with the\r\narmy much of the time in the Commissary of Musters Department. Rutgers\r\nCollege takes its name from him. He left many Revolutionary papers,\r\nwhich have been unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\nSCOTT, GENERAL JOHN M.--Born in New York in 1730; died September 14th,\r\n1784. He was the only child of John and Marian Morin Scott, and fourth\r\nin the line of descent from Sir John Scott, Baronet of Ancram, County\r\nRoxburgh, Scotland, who died in 1712. At the age of sixteen he\r\ngraduated at Yale College in the class of 1746, and took up the\r\nprofession of law in New York, where he rose steadily in practice and\r\nreputation. With Wm. Smith, the historian of New York, and Wm.\r\nLivingston, he became identified with the Whig element in the colony,\r\nand at an early date advocated principles which paved the way for the\r\nfinal opposition to ministerial measures. These three--Smith,\r\nLivingston, and Scott--became leaders at the bar, and the two latter\r\nalso in politics. Scott's residence stood at about the corner of\r\nThirty-third Street and Ninth Avenue, as appears from Ratzer's\r\nofficial map of the city and island in 1766-67, and contained 123\r\nacres. At that date it was some three miles out of town. From papers\r\nstill preserved it appears that, very soon after the Revolution, this\r\nfine estate, which had become embarrassed, was sold for $8250, and\r\nthat as early as 1813 it was worth $100,000. Scott associated himself\r\nwith enterprises that contributed to the progress and social\r\nadvancement of the city, becoming in 1754 one of the founders of the\r\nSociety for the Promotion of the Arts, and also of a City Library.\r\nFrom 1757 to 1762 he was alderman of the Out-ward of New York. He\r\ncontributed to the _Watch Tower_ and _Reflector_, and was the author\r\nof several official and literary papers and reports during his\r\nlifetime. When the Revolutionary troubles opened, he was made one of\r\nthe committee of one hundred citizens in 1775, took a foremost part\r\nagainst England's designs, and, as a powerful public speaker in favor\r\nof the colonial cause, might be called the Samuel Adams or James Otis\r\nof New York. As stated in the text, he became a member of the\r\nprovincial committee and Congress in 1775-76, and brigadier-general of\r\nState troops in March, 1776, taking active part in the campaign around\r\nhis native city. At the close of the year he offered his last month's\r\nsalary to those of his troops who would remain in the service a few\r\nweeks longer, and served himself a month without pay. In 1777 he was\r\nappointed secretary of the State, and continued in the public service\r\nin that capacity and as State senator and member of Congress until his\r\ndeath. His remains lie buried in Trinity Church-yard, near the line of\r\nBroadway, north of the church.\r\n\r\nSELDEN, COLONEL SAMUEL.--Of Hadlyme, Conn. Son of Samuel and Deborah\r\nDudley Selden. Born January 11th, 1723. His grandfather was Thomas\r\nSelden, one of the original founders of Hartford. A genealogy of the\r\nfamily is in the course of preparation by Mr. Henry M. Selden, of\r\nHaddam Neck. Colonel Selden was taken prisoner in the Kip's Bay\r\nretreat, being prostrated by the exertions of the day. He was confined\r\nin the present Register's building, in the City Hall Park, where he\r\ndied of fever, \"on Friday P.M., October 11th, about three o'clock.\" In\r\nthe latter part of his sickness he was attended by Dr. Thacher, a\r\nBritish surgeon, who paid him every attention. He was buried in the\r\nBrick Church-yard. See chapter on \"The Two Armies\" for further\r\nreference. Among this officer's great-grandsons are Chief-Justice\r\nWaite, Hon. Lyman Trumbull, General McDowell, Judge Selden of\r\nRochester, Colonel Joseph Selden of Norwich, and many others, the\r\ndescendants being numerous.\r\n\r\nSMITH, CAPTAIN ROBERT.--Born in New York in 1752; of Scotch ancestry.\r\nEntered the counting-house of his brother, Alex. Robertson Smith, a\r\nwealthy merchant. In 1776 he raised a company of Scotsmen and sons of\r\nScotsmen, and joined Malcom's New York Regiment. He was on Long Island\r\nwith Scott's brigade, and at White Plains received a severe contusion\r\nfrom a spent shot. Obliged by ill-health to retire from the service\r\nfor a time, he appeared again as a volunteer at Monmouth, and fought\r\non foot, having given up his horse to a general officer. After the war\r\nhe settled in Philadelphia, where he was a bank director for\r\nforty-eight years, holding also other offices of trust. He was a man\r\nof liberal disposition, a Presbyterian elder, and gave freely for all\r\ncharitable purposes.\r\n\r\nSTIRLING, GENERAL LORD.--This officer's name was properly William\r\nAlexander. His father claimed the title of the Earl of Stirling, and\r\nhe himself continued it. There is this description of the general in\r\nSurgeon Waldo's diary, kept at Valley Forge _(Historical Magazine_,\r\nvol. v.):\r\n\r\n\"Major-General Lord Stirling is a man of a very noble presence, and\r\nthe most martial Appearance of any General in the Service; he much\r\nresembles the Marquis of Granby--by his bald head--the make of his\r\nface, and figure of his Body. He is mild in his private conversation,\r\nand vociferous in the Field.\"\r\n\r\nTILGHMAN, CAPTAIN TENCH.--Aid to Washington. Born near Easton, Talbot\r\nCounty, Md., December 25, 1744; died April 18th, 1786. From Maryland,\r\nTilghman went to Philadelphia, became captain of a city military\r\norganization, and joined Washington as volunteer secretary and aid in\r\nAugust, 1776. He served with his chief through the war, participating\r\nin many battles, and having Washington's closest confidence. His rank\r\nas lieutenant-colonel was dated from April, 1777, by his own desire,\r\nthat he might not outrank Hamilton and Meade, who had been appointed\r\naids earlier in the year. His descendants preserve many relics of his\r\nRevolutionary service.\r\n\r\nTROUP, LIEUTENANT ROBERT.--His father was an officer in the British\r\nNavy, and died before the Revolution. Troup graduated from Columbia\r\n(old King's) College in 1774, and after his capture on Long Island as\r\none of the patrol at the Jamaica Pass was exchanged in December\r\nfollowing, with a few others. In March, 1777, he accepted a\r\ncaptain-lieutenancy in the artillery, offered by Knox, but soon after\r\njoined General Gates' staff. In May, 1778, Gates wrote to Laurens,\r\nPresident of Congress:\r\n\r\n\"Having neglected when I left York to recommend a proper person for\r\nD.A. General [deputy adjutant-general] to the army under my command, I\r\nbeg to mention Lieut Col: Robert Troup, and desire the Favor you will\r\npropose him to Congress for that office; my knowledge of his Honor,\r\nMerit, Integrity induces me apart from any personal regard, thus\r\nearnestly to wish his promotion.\"--_MS. Letter._\r\n\r\nAfter the war, Troup studied law in New York, became intimate with\r\nHamilton and Burr, and was one of the very few who retained his\r\nfriendship for the latter after the duel. Colonel Troup was appointed\r\nthe first United States District Judge for New York.\r\n\r\nVAN WAGENEN, LIEUTENANT GERRIT H.--Son of Huybert Van Wagenen and\r\nAngenietje Vredenburg, was born in New York at No. 5 Beekman Slip (now\r\nFulton Street), 1753, January 21st. He went to Canada in August, 1775,\r\nas second lieutenant in the Eighth Company of the First Regiment of\r\nNew York State troops under Colonel McDougall. Was at the storming of\r\nQuebec, in the columns of General Montgomery. In May, 1776, he was\r\nsent to New York, and then to Philadelphia, in charge of some\r\nprisoners. On returning to New York and finding that the British were\r\nlanding on Long Island, he offered his services to General Sullivan,\r\nand was sent by him with four other officers to the Jamaica Pass, as\r\ndescribed in the chapter on the battle. The party were all taken\r\nprisoners, and he continued a prisoner twenty-two months, when he was\r\nexchanged. He then received an appointment in the Commissary of\r\nPrisoners Department, and continued in that office about three years.\r\n(For a full account of his services, see the \"Gen. and Biog. Record,\"\r\nvol. viii., page 44). In 1783, March 11th, he married Sarah, daughter\r\nof Derrick Brinckerhoff and Rachel Van Ranst. He now engaged in the\r\nhardware business with his father at No. 5 Beekman Slip, where the\r\nbusiness had been carried on by his father since about 1760. The\r\nvolume entitled \"New York during the Revolution\" says, under date of\r\n1767, \"In Beekman Slip, near Queen Street, was the extensive hardware\r\nstore of Huybert Van Wagenen, whose sign of the golden broad axe was\r\nso often referred to in the annals of the period.\" He lived at Beekman\r\nSlip till 1811, when he removed to 69 Gold Street, near Beekman, and\r\nin 1821 removed with his family to Oxford, Chenango County, where he\r\ndied, 1835, November 20th.\r\n\r\nWEBB, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL S.B.--Born in Wethersfield, Conn., December,\r\n1753. He went to Boston on the Lexington alarm, and was at Bunker Hill\r\nas Captain Chester's lieutenant. He became aid to General Putnam and\r\nthen to Washington in 1776. In 1777 he raised a Continental regiment\r\nin Connecticut, and served as its colonel to the end of the war,\r\nthough for two years he was a prisoner on parole. His lieutenant-colonel\r\nwas Ebenezer Huntington, and major, John P. Wyllys, both young\r\nofficers in this campaign. Colonel Webb resided in New York until\r\n1789, and then removed to Claverack, where he died December 3d, 1807.\r\n\r\nWOODHULL, GENERAL.--There is a good sketch of General Woodhull in\r\n\"Thompson's History of Long Island,\" vol. ii. In regard to his\r\ncapture, Lieutenant Jabez Fitch, of Huntington's regiment, says in his\r\nnarrative: \"On ye 6th [of Sept.] Genll Woodhull, of ye Long Island\r\nmalitia, was sent from ye Mentor to ye Hospital at Newatrect [New\r\nUtrecht]; he was an aged Gentleman, & was taken by a party of ye\r\nEnemy's light Horse at Jameca, & altho he was not taken in arms, yet\r\nthose Bloodthirsty Savages cut & wounded him in ye head & other parts\r\nof ye body, with their Swords, in a most Inhuman manner of which\r\nwounds he Died at ye Hospital; and altho ye Director of their affairs\r\ntook but little care to preserve his Life yet they were so generous to\r\nhis Lady, as to endulge her with liberty to carry home ye General's\r\ncorpse and bury it with Deacence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND AND THE BROOKLYN DEFENCES.\r\n\r\nThe outlines and topography of this \"Plan\" have been compiled from\r\nRatzer's and United States Coast Survey maps. Bernard Ratzer was a\r\nBritish Engineer, ranking as lieutenant in the Sixtieth Royal American\r\nRegiment of Foot in 1756. In 1767-8, he made an official survey of New\r\nYork and part of Long Island with many details, the accuracy of which\r\nis beyond question. There is an advertisement in the _Connecticut\r\nGazette_ for October 25th, 1776, in which Samuel Loudon (late printer\r\nand bookseller in New York, but now in Norwich) offers for sale\r\n\"Ratzer's elegant map of New York and its Invirons from Actual\r\nSurveys, showing the present unhappy seat of War.\" This survey on Long\r\nIsland extends nearly to the line of the hills. All beyond is\r\nreproduced from maps of the coast survey, farm lines, and Brooklyn\r\nmaps. The whole represents the ground almost exactly as it lay in\r\n1776. One correction should be made at the Jamaica Pass. The name\r\nbelongs to the dotted roundabout line which represents the original\r\npass, the straight road having been cut afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STILES SKETCH OF THE BROOKLYN WORKS.\r\n\r\nNow published for the first time, and quite important as confirming\r\nthe Hessian map in vol. ii. of the Society's \"Memoirs.\" The\r\nfortifications at Red Hook are undoubtedly exactly reproduced. Taken\r\nin connection with General Greene's orders, the sketch is valuable,\r\nenabling us to locate the works. The drawing, of course, is not\r\nprecise, but the names and relative positions are enough as long as we\r\nhave Ratzer to follow in the matter of outline and topography. The\r\nwriter is indebted to the librarians of Yale College, Profs. Van Name\r\nand Dexter, for the favor of tracing the sketch from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nEWING'S DRAUGHT.\r\n\r\nThis is a one-half reduction from the original in the possession of\r\nMr. Stauffler, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has kindly furnished\r\nthe writer with a tracing. It was drawn by John Ewing, Colonel Hand's\r\nbrother-in-law, but in topography is far out the way. It contains,\r\nhowever, several important items in the references, which are noticed\r\nin the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAP OF NEW YORK CITY AND OF MANHATTAN ISLAND, WITH THE AMERICAN\r\nDEFENCES IN 1776.\r\n\r\nSo far as known, no contemporary map exists showing the whole of\r\nManhattan Island, except the very small and inaccurate sketches in\r\nStedman, Sparks, and some other works. The one presented in this\r\nvolume is believed to be the first to give the entire island, with its\r\nroads, settlements, and topographical features, as it lay in 1776. In\r\nthe compilation, Ratzer and Montressor have been followed as far as\r\nthey go--namely, from the Battery to about Fiftieth Street. From this\r\npoint to King's Bridge the map of the commissioners who first laid out\r\nthe island into streets in 1814 has been adopted. This is official,\r\nand gives the old roads as they existed during the Revolution. The\r\nBloomingdale and King's Bridge roads are laid down in the present map\r\nas the commissioners have them, the surveys being made by Randall. The\r\nfortifications at Harlem Heights are from Sauthier's English map as\r\ngiven in New York Hist. MS. and Stedman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD OF THE HARLEM HEIGHTS AFFAIR.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the topography of this battle-field in a\r\nnote in Chapter VI. The outlines are taken from Randall's city map,\r\nand the ground has been frequently visited by the writer. Point of\r\nRocks has been partly cut away, but the main features in the vicinity\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AND BROOKLYN WITH THEIR ENVIRONS IN 1776.\r\n\r\nIn this outline map, a bird's-eye view is presented of the entire\r\nposition in this vicinity. Details will be found in the larger maps.\r\nCare has been taken to give the outlines, roads, and relative\r\ndistances with accuracy. The plan is a photographic reduction of\r\nRatzer's, Randall's, and Coast Survey charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The portraits are those of representative officers--men who rendered\r\ngood service, not only during the campaign, but, in the case of three\r\nof them, during the war. Lasher's and Hand's have never been\r\npublished; and the other two are not found in any general work. They\r\nare given here (two of them, at least) as contributions to the list of\r\nRevolutionary portraits. All have been specially photographed and\r\ntransferred to steel by Mr. Egloffstein's process, for the present\r\nvolume.]\r\n\r\nCOLONEL LASHER'S portrait is enlarged from a finely-painted and\r\nwell-preserved miniature in the possession of Mrs. Kernochan, of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HAND'S portrait is in the possession of his granddaughter,\r\nMrs. S.B. Rogers, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL GLOVER'S portrait appeared first in the publications of the\r\nEssex Institute at Salem, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HUNTINGTON'S portrait appears in the Huntington family\r\n_Memoir_. The original is a miniature by Trumbull, in possession of\r\nGeneral Huntington's descendants at Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The pages refer to Part I., unless otherwise indicated.]\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nADAMS, ABIGAIL, on the Long Island defeat, 201.\r\n\r\nADAMS, JOHN, describes New York, 38;\r\n  on Long Island defeat, 201.\r\n\r\nAMERICA, success assured for, 292.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, rise of stocks at, on news from Long Island, 200.\r\n\r\nANGELL, MAJ., at Princeton, 295.\r\n\r\nAPTHORPE, CHARLES W., 43;\r\n  British at house of, 244.\r\n\r\nARMY, AMERICAN, described, 104-132;\r\n  roster of, 126-131;\r\n  on Long Island, 154, 208;\r\n  reorganized at New York, 228;\r\n  at Trenton, 289.\r\n\r\nASSANPINK CREEK, Washington outgenerals Cornwallis at, 293, 294.\r\n\r\nATLEE, COL., sketch of, 113, 129;\r\n  crosses to Long Island, 144;\r\n  at the battle, 163, 164;\r\n  near \"Battle Hill\" in Greenwood, 170, 171;\r\n  taken prisoner, 190;\r\n  loss in regiment, 204.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nBADLAM'S REDOUBT, 55, 87.\r\n\r\nBADLAM, CAPT., examines Hamilton, 110.\r\n\r\nBAILEY, COL., 117, 127.\r\n\r\nBALDWIN, COL.
