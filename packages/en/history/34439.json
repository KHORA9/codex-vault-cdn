The first\r\n(undated) was issued in or about 1801.  It appeared in pamphlet form\r\n(f'cap 8vo), and contained (1) a brief topographical description of the\r\ncity and county; (2) a \"Chronological Retrospect of the most remarkable\r\nevents which have occurred in Norfolk and Norwich during the 18th\r\ncentury, with a list of Bishops, Deans, High Sheriffs, Mayors and\r\nSheriffs of Norwich, and Mayors of Yarmouth and Lynn within that period\";\r\n(3) an Index Villaris, \"including an accurate account of the population,\r\n&c., of every parish in the county, extracted from the official returns\r\ntaken in 1801, with the measured and computed distance of each market\r\ntown and village from the city of Norwich; also the returns of the\r\npopulation of Norwich, as taken in 1693, 1752, 1786, and 1801\"; (4) a\r\nlist of direct and cross roads from Yarmouth, Lynn, and Cromer; and (5)\r\nan alphabetical list of \"noblemen and gentlemen's seats and villas in the\r\ncounty, with their distance from Norwich.\"  The work was printed and sold\r\nby Stevenson and Matchett, Market Place, Norwich, and was \"to be had of\r\nthe distributors of the NORFOLK CHRONICLE and of all booksellers.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Remembrancer\" consisted of 80 pages, and was published at\r\neighteenpence.  Although the \"Chronological Retrospect\" extended over the\r\nperiod of one hundred years--from 1701 to 1800 inclusive, it was\r\ncompressed into 43 pages.  This, the most important section of the work,\r\nwas reprinted from a local chronology published in the NORFOLK CHRONICLE,\r\ncompiled partly from old Norwich histories and partly from the early\r\nfiles of the newspaper.  \"Omissions or errors which may have occurred in\r\nthis work,\" says a footnote to the \"advertisement\" to the first edition,\r\n\"shall be corrected in a future edition, and notice of such will be\r\nthankfully received by the Editors.\"\r\n\r\nBut many years elapsed before the publication of a second edition, and it\r\nwas not until 1822 that the \"Remembrancer\" again made its appearance.\r\nThe modest pamphlet of 1801 had grown to a crown 8vo volume of 274 pages,\r\nbound in cloth, and issued at three shillings and sixpence.  It was\r\nprinted in bolder type, and contained additional information of a\r\nmiscellaneous character, which, published at a time when few general\r\ndirectories and books of reference were in circulation, and local\r\nstatistics difficult to obtain, was received with favour as one of the\r\nearliest attempts to supply the want now so fully met by local handbooks\r\nand year-books.  In this, as in the first edition, the Chronology was by\r\nfar the most important part of the book.  The 18th century \"Retrospect\"\r\nwas revised and amplified, and the record, continued from January, 1801,\r\nto December, 1821, occupied 208 pages.  The compiler of this edition, and\r\nprobably of the former issue, although his name did not appear in\r\nconnection therewith, was Mr. Jonathan Matchett, the senior proprietor of\r\nthe NORFOLK CHRONICLE, who states in his preface: \"The Chronology of\r\nRemarkable Events has been compiled principally from the volumes of the\r\nNORFOLK CHRONICLE, of which, with the local occurrences of the last fifty\r\nyears at least, the Retrospect may be considered an epitome.  Such errors\r\nof omission or commission as may be discovered in this humble compilation\r\nshall, if pointed out, be corrected in a future edition, if ever a third\r\nshould be called for.\"  As no subsequent issue appeared, it may be\r\nassumed that the demand for the work was not such as to justify the\r\nexpenditure of the time and labour necessary to its production.  Mr.\r\nMatchett died November 24th, 1844, and from that time until the present\r\nno effort had been made to continue the Chronology.\r\n\r\nLittle need be written by way of preface to this work.  It was commenced\r\nas an index to the Nineteenth Century files of the NORFOLK CHRONICLE, and\r\nwas not, as originally planned, intended for publication.  The compiler,\r\nhowever, was advised to elaborate his scheme and to prepare, in place of\r\na MS. index designed for private use, a work which would serve the\r\ntwofold purpose of continuing the excellent Chronology begun by Mr.\r\nMatchett, and of supplying a book of reference upon a variety of subjects\r\npertaining to Norfolk and Norwich.  In Volume I. of \"Norfolk Annals\" are\r\nrecorded the events of the two decades included in the second edition of\r\nthe \"Remembrancer,\" but the matter has been entirely re-written, and the\r\nfield of research considerably enlarged.  With the lapse of time many\r\nthings, too familiar and commonplace to be very fully noticed in the\r\n\"Remembrancer,\"--_e.g._, the coaching system, sports which are now\r\nobsolete, country celebrations and observances, &c.,--have acquired an\r\ninterest which they did not present to a compiler of eighty or a hundred\r\nyears ago.  Some of the facts recorded in these pages may not in\r\nthemselves be considered \"remarkable,\" but collectively they illustrate\r\nthe manners and customs, the wisdom and follies, the labours and\r\namusements, of Norfolk people in the century just closed, and, it is\r\nhoped, show to what extent the county and city have progressed morally\r\nand socially during the last hundred years.  In one respect \"Norfolk\r\nAnnals\" is less pretentious than its antecessor--it gives no\r\ntopographical and statistical information of the kind published in the\r\n\"Norfolk and Norwich Remembrancer\"; in another sense it is more\r\npretentious--it contains an index, which will add to its usefulness as a\r\nbook of reference.\r\n\r\nThe writer is indebted to the Chairman (Sir Charles Gilman) and the\r\nDirectors of the NORFOLK CHRONICLE CO., Limited, for permitting him to\r\nmake use of the files of that newspaper, from which exclusively the\r\nfollowing pages have been compiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA. {0}\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 128, last line, _for_ \"present\" _read_ \"presented.\"\r\n\r\n,, 138, line 9, _for_ \"Hawkes\" _read_ \"Hankes.\"\r\n\r\n,, 166, line 2, _for_ \"Henry\" _read_ \"Hurry.\"\r\n\r\n,, 187, line 8, _for_ \"Miller\" _read_ \"Milles.\"\r\n\r\n,, 216, first line of last paragraph _for_ \"Norfolk\" _read_ \"Norwich.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORFOLK ANNALS.\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n1801-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--_Marginal dates distinguished by an asterisk are dates of\r\npublication_, _not of occurrence_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--This day (Thursday) was observed as the first day of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.  It was also the day upon which the legislative Union of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland was effected.  At Norwich, the 13th Regiment of Light\r\nDragoons and the East Essex Militia fired a _feu de joie_ in the Market\r\nPlace, and the Union flag was displayed upon the tower of St. Peter\r\nMancroft.  At Yarmouth, there was a ceremonial parade of the Durham\r\nMilitia, and the vessels in the Roads fired a royal salute and hoisted\r\ntheir new colours in honour of the Union.  Rain fell heavily throughout\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n3.--The Norwich Theatre was opened with the performance of \"the last new\r\ncomedy, 'Life,' and the farce, 'Curiosity.'\"  The manager, Mr. Hindes,\r\ndelivered an address to a crowded and fashionable audience.  The\r\nalterations in the house were executed after designs by Mr. William\r\nWilkins, the patentee, and it was said to be one of the handsomest\r\ntheatres in the provinces.\r\n\r\n5.*--\"The Duke of Grafton's hounds unkenneled a fox at Fakenham Wood,\r\nnear Euston, and after a chase of upwards of 50 miles in 4 hours 5\r\nminutes, killed him at New Buckenham.\"\r\n\r\n27.*--\"A match for ten guineas (two miles) was trotted on the turnpike\r\nroad between Setch and Lynn, between Mr. Robson's pony Filch and Mr.\r\nScarfe's pony Fidler, which was won with great ease by the former, he\r\nhaving trotted over the ground at the rate of 18 miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nGreat scarcity prevailed throughout this month.  About 1,500 pounds was\r\nsubscribed for supplying the poor of Norwich with soup, and upwards of\r\n247,000 quarts were distributed.  At Norwich market wheat was quoted at\r\nthe beginning of the month at 146s. per quarter, and rose at the end to\r\n180s.; barley, 84s.; and oats, 50s.  Various expedients were adopted to\r\nlessen the consumption of bread.  \"The officers of the West Norfolk\r\nMilitia\" it was stated, \"have entirely left off the use of bread at their\r\nmess, and have forbid the use of puddings and pies, except the crust is\r\nmade of rice or potatoes, which they eat in a variety of shapes as a\r\nsubstitute for bread.\"  Nurses were advised to use linseed meal and water\r\ninstead of bread and milk in making poultices.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--Died at Postwick, aged 21, Edward West, who had served as midshipman\r\nunder Lord Nelson at the battle of the Nile, and accompanied Capt. Sir\r\nEdward Berry in the Foudroyant.  In the action with the Guillaume Tell\r\n\"he received a most severe wound, which occasioned a decline.\"\r\n\r\n11.--A General Fast was observed in Norwich.\r\n\r\n14.*--\"It is much to be regretted that although many large manufactures\r\nof hempen cloth are established in Norwich, all the spinning of the hemp\r\nis done in Suffolk, and a sufficient quantity is with difficulty obtained\r\nfrom thence.  It is suggested to establish a spinning school for\r\nchildren, under the patronage of benevolent ladies.\"\r\n\r\n17.--A company was formed at Norwich for the erection of a \"public mill\r\nto be worked by steam for supplying the bakers and inhabitants with\r\nflour.\"  A capital of 12,500 pounds was raised in transferable shares of\r\n25 pounds, and the mill was erected upon a site near Blackfriars' Bridge.\r\n\r\n24.--Mr. Charles Harvey, Steward of Norwich, elected Recorder, in place\r\nof Mr. Henry Partridge, resigned.\r\n\r\n28.--The price of wheat at Norwich Market was 168s. per quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--The Anacreontic Society, \"which for many years has been established\r\nin Norwich, and to which the cause of music owes so much,\" closed its\r\nwinter session.  The Hon. Mr. Wodehouse, Sir William Jerningham, Sir\r\nRichard Bedingfeld, and Capt. Sir Edward Berry were present.  The Society\r\ngave monthly concerts in the Assembly Room from October to March.  In the\r\nadvertisement announcing the commencement of the next session, it was\r\nstated that the first concert would \"begin precisely at 6; supper-rooms\r\nopen at 9, and the President to quit the chair at 12 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n7.--Arrived in Yarmouth Roads, the St. George, of 98 guns, bearing the\r\nflag of Lord Nelson.  The grand fleet of 47 ships of war (with 3,000\r\nmarines), sailed on the 12th, under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde\r\nParker, in the London, of 98 guns, with Nelson as his Vice-Admiral.  The\r\nfleet first \"rendezvoused\" in Leith Roods, where it was joined by seven\r\nsail of the line, and afterwards proceeded to Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n10.--A mob assembled at Lynn and grossly assaulted several millers and\r\nfarmers by throwing at them stones and dirt.  In the evening they broke\r\nthe windows in the dining-room of the Duke's Head Inn.  \"One of the\r\nringleaders was taken to gaol, and by the active exertions of the Rutland\r\nMilitia tranquillity was restored without bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n11.*--\"Mr. Kett, butcher, of Norwich, undertook to ride his horse 50\r\nmiles in four hours.  He started from St. Stephen's Gates at 12 o'clock,\r\nreached the 25th milestone on the Thetford road in about 2.5 hours, and\r\nreturned to the place whence he had set out one and a half minutes before\r\nthe time allowed.  Six to four was laid that the horse did not perform\r\nthe journey.\"\r\n\r\n14.*--[Advt.]  \"The Yarmouth and Norwich mail coach will set out from the\r\nKing's Head, Market Place, Norwich, and the Star Tavern, Quay, Yarmouth,\r\nevery day, at 12 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n16.--The Invincible, of 74 guns (built in 1766), Rear-Admiral Totty, on\r\nher way to join the grand fleet, got on the Ridge, near Happisburgh Sand,\r\nand remained there till daybreak next morning, when she floated off.  On\r\nentering deep water she went down immediately, with several officers and\r\n300 men.  Daniel Grigson, master of the Nancy cod-smack, saved seven\r\nofficers and about 190 of the crew.  At a Court Martial held at\r\nSheerness, on March 31st, on Admiral Totty and the surviving officers and\r\ncrew, it was proved that the disaster occurred through the ignorance of\r\nthe pilot, and a verdict of honourable acquittal was returned.\r\n\r\n19.--At the Norfolk Assizes, held at Thetford, before Mr. Justice Grose,\r\nthe action, the King _v._ Augustus Beevor, clerk, was tried.  The\r\ninformation was filed against the defendant by leave of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, for sending a challenge to Major Edward Payne, in\r\nconsequence of a dispute that had taken place between the Major and the\r\ndefendant's father.  Defendant, referring to this dispute, wrote to Major\r\nPayne, demanding an apology, \"or he should be under the necessity of\r\ncompelling it by a mode generally used among gentlemen.\"  No notice was\r\ntaken of the letter, and the defendant meeting Major Payne in the Market\r\nPlace at Norwich told him publicly that \"the contempt he had for his\r\ncharacter protected his person.\"  The defendant was found guilty, and at\r\nthe next term of the Court of King's Bench (May 7) was sentenced to three\r\nweeks' imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison, and ordered to enter into\r\nhis own recognisances of 500 pounds, to find two sureties of 250 pounds\r\neach, and to be of good behaviour for three years.\r\n\r\n20.*--\"The remains of Miss Sophia Goddard, of the Theatre Royal, Norwich,\r\nwere interred at St. Peter Mancroft.  Mr. Hindes, the manager, and the\r\nprincipal actors attended on the melancholy occasion.  This young lady\r\nhad obtained considerable reputation on the Norwich boards, and was\r\nmaking rapid advance to eminence in her profession when death prematurely\r\ndeprived the theatrical world of an actress whose talents would have\r\nensured her success on any stage.  She supported with great fortitude and\r\nresignation a long and painful illness, brought on by exertions that her\r\nconstitution was unequal to, and died on Sunday last (March 15), in her\r\n26th year, sincerely beloved and lamented by her family and friends.\"\r\n\r\nWheat this month rose to 180s. per quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Died at the Cavalry Barracks, Norwich, Lieut. Robert Scully, 13th\r\nLight Dragoons.  His remains were interred on Sunday, April 4th, with\r\nmilitary honours, at St. Peter Mancroft.\r\n\r\n4.--Died at Cambridge, Mrs. Lloyd, widow of Dean Lloyd, aged 79.  \"Her\r\nperformances in needlework were so exquisitely wrought that they may\r\njustly be compared with the paintings of the most celebrated artists.\r\nThe Transfiguration and other figures represented in the eastern windows\r\nof Norwich Cathedral have displayed the superior skill of her personal\r\nattainments.\"\r\n\r\n--Mousehold Heath, Norwich, was enclosed and cultivated.  Plots of land\r\nwere afterwards let at 25s. per acre.\r\n\r\n--John Allen (23) and John Day (26), for burglary at the house of the\r\nRev. Isaac Horsley, at North Walsham; Richard Grafton, for stealing a cow\r\nand three heifers; and James Chettleburgh (36), for stealing six sheep at\r\nSaxlingham, were executed at Thetford.  \"Day confessed to having\r\ncommitted four burglaries previous to that for which he suffered, and to\r\nhaving deserted thirteen times from different regiments.\"\r\n\r\n--In consequence of objections being made to the elections of Messrs.\r\nStaff and Proctor in the Wymer Ward, and of Messrs. Brittan and Scott in\r\nthe Northern Ward, Norwich, on the ground of their being ineligible under\r\nthe Corporation Act, having omitted to receive the Sacrament within a\r\nyear previous to the election of Common Council, the Mayor did not make\r\nthe returns till several days after the usual time.  At a Court held on\r\nthis day, the Recorder (Mr. Harvey), after the objections had been fully\r\nargued by counsel, declared that the persons objected to, who had the\r\nmajority of votes, having omitted to come into Court according to\r\nsummons, were not duly elected; but, as no regular notice had been given\r\nprevious to the election, the candidates in the minority could not be\r\nreturned.

The two main\r\npoints which the plaintiff endeavoured to substantiate were, first, that\r\nthe tenant had not set out the tithes according to law; and, secondly, if\r\nset out, it was done fraudulently and unfairly.  It was proved that in\r\none field defendant cut the whole crop, tithed and carried a part on one\r\nday, and the remainder on the following day.  The Judge ruled that this\r\nmode of tithing was contrary to law, and said he was sorry to be obliged\r\nto direct the special jury to find for the plaintiff.  The jury, after\r\nrequesting his lordship to inform them what was the lowest sum they could\r\naward, so as not to subject the defendant to costs, assessed the amount\r\nat 8 pounds.

At the same Assizes,\r\nMr. Leathes brought an action against a farmer, named Long, for not\r\nsetting out his tithes according to law.

Several witnesses now\r\ndeposed to having seen Johnson and Hardiment in company at about the time\r\nof the murder, and two persons confined in Aylsham bridewell at the same\r\ntime that Hardiment and Neal were prisoners there gave evidence as to\r\nhearing conversations between the two when planning the murder.

In consequence of simony alleged\r\nto have been committed by the Rev. Dr. Lock, the patron of the advowson\r\nof Hilgay, the Crown had seized the living and presented the Rev. Dr.\r\nHewlett thereto on April 6th, 1819.  This action of _quare impedit_ was\r\ninstituted by the plaintiff to try the right of the Crown to such\r\npresentation.  The defendant raised three pleas: (1) that the Rev. John\r\nRoyle being seized of the living of Hilgay it was corruptly agreed that\r\nLock should resign the living of Compton Martin, in Somersetshire, and\r\ncause him (Royle) to be presented to it, and also that Lock should pay\r\nRoyle the sum of 12,900 pounds for the advowson of Hilgay, and that in\r\nconsideration of the promises Royle should resign the living and cause\r\nLock to be presented to it.  (2) That Lock being seized of the living of\r\nHilgay did corruptly agree with one James Craddock, that in consideration\r\nof the said Craddock paying to him the sum of 25,000 pounds he (Lock)\r\nshould convey to Craddock the advowson of Hilgay, and also resign the\r\nliving and cause him (Craddock) to be presented to it.  (3) That Lock,\r\nbeing seized of Hilgay, having presented Craddock, did corruptly agree\r\nthat, in consideration of Lock abandoning certain proceedings in an\r\naction for debt against Craddock, he should forego proceedings upon a\r\nbill of indictment for perjury preferred by Lock against Craddock, but\r\nLock corruptly prevailed upon Craddock to resign the living in order that\r\nhe (Lock) might present himself to it.  The jury gave a verdict for the\r\nCrown generally upon all pleas.  The Judge: A very proper verdict.  It is\r\nvery disgraceful dealing, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n30.*--(Advt.)  \"To be fought at the White Swan Inn, Norwich, on Monday,\r\nApril 15th, 1822, and two following days, three double-days' play of\r\ncocks for ten guineas a battle and 200 guineas the odd, between the\r\ngentlemen of Norwich and the gentlemen of Northampton.

At the Summer Assizes on August 11th, the Grand Jury for\r\nthe county presented an address to the Judges expressing regret at their\r\ndecision, and pointing out that the chief benefits contemplated by the\r\nrecent Act of Parliament for the regulation of gaols must be in a great\r\ndegree frustrated by a continuance of the then state of things in\r\nNorfolk.  \"The late city calendar,\" said the NORFOLK CHRONICLE,\r\n\"furnishes no less than three cases of exceptional long confinement\r\nbefore trial; namely, one person for more than twelve months, who has\r\nbeen acquitted, and two others in custody upwards of eleven months\r\nagainst whom no true bills were found.\"\r\n\r\n16.--At the Norfolk Quarter Sessions at Norwich, the magistrates agreed\r\nthat the whole of Mr. Wilkin's plan for erecting a new gaol at Norwich\r\nCastle be carried into execution.

In the same paper was another letter\r\naddressed by Mr. N. Bolingbroke, of Norwich, to the High Sheriff of\r\nHertfordshire, in which he wrote: \"It may appear to some that he (the\r\nfather) has not acted with sufficient kindness of feeling towards his\r\nunhappy son; but you may be assured, Sir, that there was no part of his\r\nconduct which could not be satisfactorily explained.  He has generally\r\nacted under the advice of Mr. Unthank, a respectable solicitor in this\r\ncity, my own, and others.  There are many actions in a man's life of\r\nwhich no correct opinion can be formed without a knowledge of the motives\r\nby which such have been influenced.\"\r\n\r\n29.--At a meeting held at the Guildhall, Norwich, under the presidency of\r\nLieut.-Col.

A resolution was moved to the effect that the meeting viewed\r\nwith satisfaction the measures proposed for the extension of the silk\r\nmanufactory, \"but the object could not fully be attained by the proposed\r\nimmediate remission of so great a proportion of the duties on raw and\r\nthrown silks.\"  It was advocated that endeavours be made to obtain\r\ncompensation for the loss sustained upon stocks of manufactured goods,\r\nand a petition to Parliament embodying that view was adopted.  On April\r\n5th \"an unusual scene was witnessed in Norwich, that being the last day\r\non which manufacturers of the city warehoused their raw and foreign silk\r\nin order to obtain the drawback according to the late decision of\r\nParliament.  The number of pieces of bombazines and crapes bonded was\r\nabout 40,000, which may be averaged at 7s. 6d. each, and the total amount\r\nof the drawback will be 30,000.  Such of the goods as are for exportation\r\nare already returned to the owners, and an order is expected in a few\r\ndays for the delivery of those intended for the home trade.  By this\r\narrangement, which was recommended to Government by a gentleman deputed\r\nfrom Norwich, little time will be lost, and the manufacturer will obtain\r\nthe relief which, but for its adoption, would, under the late alteration\r\nof the law, have proved highly injurious to many of our fellow citizens.\"\r\nOn June 23rd a dinner was given at the Rampant Horse Inn by the merchants\r\nand manufacturers to Mr. John Harvey, Mr. E.

Parkinson (who had been\r\nelected in place of Mr. Skipper), declined to recognise Mr. Beckwith as\r\nChamberlain.  Mr. Goodwin was then proposed, and elected to the office.\r\nAt a Council meeting on June 7th, Mr. Beckwith took his seat as\r\nChamberlain, and was asked to retire; he refused, and the beadle was\r\ncalled in.  Mr. Beckwith, addressing that officer, said, \"I give you\r\nnotice, if you lay your hands on me you do so at your peril.\"  One of the\r\nmembers remarked that if the beadle did not turn him out they would.  Mr.\r\nBeckwith was then led out by the beadle, and the incident terminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--A fine specimen of the sea eagle (_falco ossifragus_) was shot near\r\nFritton Decoy.

All at once, however,\r\nthe 'Blue and Whites' have roused themselves from their inaction, and\r\nagain entering the field of party warfare, have succeeded in displacing\r\ntheir opponents.  It is useless to deny that the week's proceedings have\r\nbeen marked by undisguised bribery and corruption, and that the object of\r\nthe triumphant party has mainly been achieved by superior weight of\r\nmetal--by dint of money.\"\r\n\r\n10.--Died at his residence in London, aged 78, the Marquis of\r\nCholmondeley, of Houghton Hall, Lord Steward of his Majesty's Household,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n13.--Died, aged 82, Mr. Daniel Clark, of Norwich.  \"He was in the\r\ncommercial establishment of Messrs.

Lieut. White, in his\r\nsubsequent address, wrote: \"I consider my failure more honourable than to\r\nhave gained the day by bribery and corruption.

A very\r\nsuperior day's play is expected, as there are several other matches\r\nbesides.\"\r\n\r\n--*\"Died lately, at Northrepps, Hannah Storey, in her 101st year.\"\r\n\r\n--Lieut.-Col. Harvey, commanding the 3rd Regiment of Norfolk Yeomanry\r\nCavalry, addressed a letter to the Marquis of Lansdowne, Secretary of\r\nState for War, detailing the services rendered by the regiment in\r\nquelling disturbances, &c., and expressing the hope that the Government\r\nwould not order the disbandment of the corps.  His lordship replied that\r\nhe had not lost sight of the valuable services of the Yeomanry, but that\r\nthe Barracks at Norwich were then, and were likely to continue, a station\r\nfor regular cavalry, and consequently he was unable to accede to the\r\nrequest to continue the pay and allowance to the regiment.\r\n\r\n24.--Died at Lynn, Samuel Pearson, a journeyman cabinetmaker, \"who, in\r\nthe intervals of his labour, acquired a deep knowledge of mathematics,\r\nand possessed the faculty of communicating his knowledge to others.

The case was tried\r\nat Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief Baron Alexander, on August 11th,\r\n1828, when only Vaughan (or Smith) was proceeded against.  Robert Barker\r\nturned King's evidence, and described the method by which the graves were\r\nrobbed, and how the bodies were sent to London by the wain.  A verdict of\r\nguilty was returned, and on November 14th, 1828, the prisoner was brought\r\nup for sentence in the Court of King's Bench.  He urged that he was\r\ndriven by poverty to the commission of the offence, and was sentenced by\r\nMr. Justice Bayley to six months' imprisonment in the house of correction\r\nat Norwich.\r\n\r\n31.--Miss Clark, a native of the city, commenced an engagement with her\r\nequestrian company at the Pantheon, Ranelagh Gardens, Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1828.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--A grand concert, given at Wells Theatre, was attended by Earl\r\nRosebery, Lord and Lady Bury, Lord Dalmeney, Viscountess Andover, Admiral\r\nDigby, Lady H.

In the parishes the old valuation\r\nwas 61,302 pounds; the new, 89,080 pounds; increase, 27,778 pounds--45\r\nper cent.  In the hamlets the old valuation was 19,722 pounds; the new,\r\n21,487 pounds; increase, 1,765 pounds--about 9 per cent.  At the vestry\r\nmeetings in several parishes the new assessment was rejected--(1) on the\r\nground of increased local and public burdens to which the citizens would\r\nbe exposed by increased rent on such valuation; and (2) because of the\r\ndisproportion of the assessment of the hamlets as compared with the\r\nassessment of the city at large.  At a meeting of the Guardians on April\r\n1st, a resolution was adopted declaring the mulct to be unequal, and\r\nadvising that steps be taken to place it upon a fair and equitable basis.\r\n\r\n8.--A \"trial of speed\" took place between the Westacre and Melton\r\nConstable hounds.  \"A noble stag stood before the hounds an hour and ten\r\nminutes, but from the numerous field, amounting at least to 400, the\r\ngreater part of whom were shamefully riding the roads and heading the\r\nstag at every point, the sport was not brilliant.  Through the greater\r\npart of the day the Westacre hounds took the lead, carried the best head,\r\nand did all the work; but from the jockeyship of Sir Jacob Astley's\r\nhuntsman in continually lifting his hounds, and numerous horsemen\r\npressing on them in the lanes and woods, so completely frightened the\r\nWestacre hounds, which are more timid and less accustomed to such crowds\r\nthan the Melton, that most of them were thrown out and could not again\r\nrecover their ground.\"  The match took place in the neighbourhood of East\r\nDereham.\r\n\r\n12.--In the Court of King's Bench, Sir James Scarlett moved for a rule to\r\nshow cause why a _quo warranto_ information should not be filed against\r\nMr. Angell, of Norwich, for exercising the office of alderman without\r\nbeing properly elected thereto.  \"A very ancient custom,\" he said,\r\n\"prevailed at Norwich on the election of aldermen, which he was sure\r\nwould not, from its antiquity, receive their lordships' sanction.  It was\r\ncalled the cooping of voters, and consisted of taking the voters by force\r\nin a body, bribing them, giving them drink, and keeping them locked up\r\nuntil they consented to vote for the party on whose side they had been\r\ntaken.\"  It was alleged that several of the supporters of Mr. Angell's\r\nopponent (Mr. Marshall) were waylaid, carried away by force in a coach,\r\nput on board a boat on the broads, and had persons placed over them as\r\nguards.  If these persons had had their liberty, Mr. Marshall, it was\r\ncontended, would have been elected.  Lord Tenterden granted a rule to\r\nshow cause.  It was abandoned, however, on April 28th, and \"the bells of\r\nSt. Peter rang a triumphant peal on the result being known.\"\r\n\r\n13.--A squadron of the 6th Dragoons arrived at Norwich Barracks, to\r\nreplace the depot of the 12th Lancers.\r\n\r\n23.--A man named Bailey did penance in the chancel of Yarmouth parish\r\nchurch for applying an opprobrious epithet to a Mrs. Jenner.  \"It being a\r\nvery great novelty, there was a large assemblage of persons to witness\r\nthe performance of the ceremony and to hear Bailey repeat his\r\nrecantations, which continued for some time, but he did _not_, as\r\ngenerally supposed, stand in a white sheet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The election of a County Coroner took place at Norwich, consequent\r\nupon the resignation of Mr. C. Bringloe.  Mr. E. Press, of Hingham, the\r\nsuccessful candidate, polled 1,073 votes, as against 766 obtained by his\r\nopponent, Mr. Henry Hobart, Norwich.\r\n\r\n17.--Died at his house in Surrey Street, Norwich, aged 68, Sir James\r\nEdward Smith, M.D., F.R.S., President of the Linnaean Society.  He was\r\nborn in Norwich December 2nd, 1759, proceeded to Edinburgh University in\r\n1780, and completed his medical studies in London.  In 1792 he had the\r\nhonour of instructing her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Princesses in\r\nbotany at Windsor.  He married, in 1796, a daughter of Mr. Robert Reeve,\r\nof Lowestoft, and in 1810 received the distinction of knighthood.

This alteration in the market was followed, about an hour\r\nafterwards, by a similar declaration from the 'Orange and Purples.'  From\r\nthis moment stock looked up; the price for the freemen altered from five\r\nshillings to half a sovereign, and a whole sovereign, and so on to sums\r\nof which we are not prepared to limit the extent.  A whole club,\r\nconsisting of 20 members, calling themselves 'the Independent Club,' was\r\npurchased in the lump by one of the 'Blue and White' candidates.  The\r\nprice first demanded was 5 guineas a man, but others allow they were\r\nknocked down at the price of 50 gs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Died, aged 106, Thomas Scrape.  \"He was the father of Mrs. Lovell, of\r\nthe Lobster Inn, St. John Maddermerket, Norwich, and was born at Stalham\r\nin 1722, in the 9th year of the reign of George I.  He had been often\r\nheard to speak of remembering as a child the illuminations on the\r\noccasion of the accession of George II.  At the age of 105 this\r\nextraordinary old man presided at a large convivial party at his\r\nresidence.  His pipe was his constant companion, and he was often to be\r\nseen smoking and enjoying it at his daughter's house, where his latter\r\ndays were rendered comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n3.--Tombland Fair, Norwich, was ushered in by a severe snowstorm.  \"The\r\nBanisters, the Samwells, the Chipperfields, the Adamses, and a host of\r\nother ornaments of the vagrant stage for daylight gauds and the practical\r\nwit of buffoons displayed themselves in imposing array.\"  The only\r\n\"rational\" exhibition at the fair was Atkins' Menagerie.\r\n\r\n5.--A vessel, named the Lord William Bentinck, was launched from the\r\nshipyard of Mr. Frederick Preston, at Yarmouth.  She was nearly 500 tons\r\nburden, and the largest ship, with one exception, ever built at the port.\r\n\r\n7.--Ching Lau Lauro, \"the celebrated posture master and buffo from Drury\r\nLane,\" appeared at Norwich Theatre.  On the 10th he performed in a\r\nharlequinade, entitled, \"The Man in the Moon.\"  \"No viler tissue of\r\nnonsensical stuff could be foisted on the patience of an insulted\r\naudience.  It had more revolting coarseness, and infinitely less\r\ningenuity than ever characterised the worst puppet shows' clumsiest\r\nperformers.  'Harlequin in the Shades' descended to the lowest vault of\r\nthe Capulets, amidst universal hisses which such execrable trash\r\ndeservedly called forth, in spite of Ching Lau Lauro swallowing his own\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n19.--The Norfolk County Cricket Club announced the completion of a new\r\ncricket ground at East Dereham, described as one of the best in the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n25.--A remarkable whirlwind occurred at Gresham.  \"It came suddenly as in\r\na moment from the south-west, accompanied by a roar like thunder, and\r\ntaking a north-easterly direction towards Cromer, spent itself at sea.\r\nThe extreme force of the whirlwind lasted scarcely three minutes, but in\r\nthat time it completely ruined one William Watts, by rending the sails\r\nand stocks from his mill, lifting the whole fabric from off the post, and\r\ncrushing the beams and inside works to pieces, together with the roof and\r\nwalls of the round-house.\"\r\n\r\n27.--Died at his house, Vauxhall, Lambeth, Mr. Thomas H. Hull, aged 74,\r\n\"a gentleman well-known in Norwich and Norfolk for a great number of\r\nyears, and where many of his beautifully-executed pictures remain as\r\nspecimens of his superior talent in the miniature department of portrait\r\npainting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Mr. Angell and Mr. Patteson were nominated for the Mayoralty of\r\nNorwich.  Mr. W. Wilde nominated Mr. Alderman Thurtell, the senior\r\nalderman below the chair; and Mr. Alderman Yallop was also proposed.  A\r\npoll was demanded, and the result was declared as follows: Thurtell,\r\n1,144; Yallop, 1,148; Angell, 1,042; Patteson, 979.  Application was made\r\nby Messrs. Angell and Patteson for the reopening of the books on the\r\nfollowing morning, when the voting was: Thurtell, 1,210; Yallop, 1,212;\r\nAngell, 1,097; Patteson, 1,020.

It was\r\nalso decided to petition Parliament to repeal such bounties and duties,\r\nand to take measures to ensure the immediate alleviation and the ultimate\r\nextinction of British Colonial slavery.

He was at\r\nGibraltar, at the Chesapeak with Hood, in the same ship with our present\r\nLord High Admiral, then a boy; and was in the Formidable (flagship) with\r\nSir George, afterwards Lord Rodney, in the memorable battle of 1782, when\r\nM.

During his engagement he appeared also as Jaffier\r\n(\"Venice Preserved\") and Felix (\"Hunter of the Alps\").  \"It is difficult,\r\nindeed, to imagine,\" says the critic, \"what besides an irresistible\r\n_penchant_ for the stage and an hereditary attachment for the most\r\nelevated dramatic work, could have induced this gentleman to choose the\r\nprofession of a tragedian.  Of a stature rather below the middle size,\r\nand with a countenance that forms no index of the heroic mind, the\r\nyounger Kean seems studious of displaying all those peculiarities of\r\nattitude, action, and intonation which we have been accustomed to regard\r\nrather as defects than as excellencies in his justly celebrated father.\r\nThe genius of the elder Kean does not shine forth in his son.\"\r\n\r\n--A prize-fight took place between Warren and Cocks, light weights, for\r\n50 pounds a side.  The gathering, which was at Mattishall, was attended\r\nby many of the principal gentry in the county, and by several members of\r\nthe London ring, including Phil Sampson (conqueror of Big Brown), Dick\r\nCurtis, Tom Oliver, Frank Redmond, Ned Stockman, and Frosty-Faced Fogo,\r\n\"the Poet Laureate of the Ring.\"  The combatants met in a meadow\r\nbelonging to Mr. Petchell, but a magistrate interfered, and a move was\r\nmade to Elsing Common, where the fight was brought off.  Cocks was\r\nattended by Ned Painter and Ben Gale, and Warren by Curtis and Redmond.\r\nForty-one rounds were fought in 56 minutes.  Cocks, who won, threw his\r\nman 23 times in the first 25 rounds.\r\n\r\n17.--Guild Day was celebrated in Norwich.  Mr. Alderman Thurtell, on\r\nbeing sworn in as Mayor, stated that he stood in rotation for the office\r\nin 1818, and to his utter astonishment the late Mr. Back was put in\r\nnomination and elected.  \"I thank God,\" he added, \"I have had nerve\r\nenough to break all connection with a set of men who have acted with so\r\nmuch duplicity and injustice towards me.\"  The Guild feast at St.\r\nAndrew's Hall was attended by 460 guests.\r\n\r\n24.--Died, Captain John Murray Browne, of the 75th Regiment, aged 36,\r\nonly son of the Rev.

There was no\r\ncommunication, however, with St. Andrew's Street, and it was not until\r\nApril, 1829, that operations were commenced for the removal of the old\r\nbuildings at the north end of the new thoroughfare.  That portion of the\r\nstreet was opened to the public on May 21st, 1832; and public business\r\nwas for the first time transacted in the Post Office erected there, on\r\nJune 25th, 1832.\r\n\r\n--The members of the Norfolk and Suffolk Institution, the new title by\r\nwhich the Norwich Society of Artists established in 1805 was known,\r\ncelebrated the opening of their new gallery in Exchange Street by dining\r\nat the Norfolk Hotel, under the presidency of Mr. J.

The windows of the lower\r\ncourt had been screwed down, to prevent persons entering by that way\r\nbefore the arrival of the magistrates.  The court was crowded, the heat\r\nintolerable, and the Mayor (Mr. Thurtell) ordered the windows to be\r\nbroken.  Upon the Sheriffs-elect, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Grout, presenting\r\nthemselves, the latter was objected to, on the ground that he was not a\r\nfreeman; and Mr. Stevenson declined to serve unless he received legal\r\nindemnity from his colleague.  The Recorder (Mr. Alderson) disposed of\r\nthe legal difficulty in Mr. Stevenson's case, but the uproar was so great\r\nthat an adjournment had to be made to the Aldermen's Chamber, where the\r\nTown Clerk administered the oath to Mr. Grout, notwithstanding a protest\r\nby Col. Harvey.  At a meeting of the Common Council, on October 2nd, a\r\nnotice signed by eight of the \"Purple and Orange\" Aldermen was read,\r\nintimating that any act done by the Council would not be valid, as one of\r\nthe Sheriffs was improperly elected.  They therefore declined to attend\r\nthe meeting.  The Mayor complained that he was being set at defiance, and\r\nthreatened to appeal to a higher power.  On November 8th a motion was\r\nmade in the Court of King's Bench, to show cause why an information in\r\nthe nature of a _quo warranto_ should not be filed against Mr. Grout, to\r\nshow by what authority he exercised the office of Sheriff; the Court\r\ngranted a rule _nisi_.  On February 24th the Corporation unanimously\r\nconferred on Mr. Grout the freedom of the city.  The case, after being\r\nseveral times before the Court, was finally disposed of on June 28th,\r\n1830, when Mr. Justice Bailey delivered judgment, and said that the Court\r\nwere of opinion that it was essential to the validity of election to the\r\noffice of Sheriff that the individual chosen should be a freeman.\r\nJudgment of ouster was therefore entered.  Retaliatory proceedings were\r\ntaken in the Court of King's Bench by the other political party against\r\nMr. Alderman Patteson for holding the office of Treasurer of the city,\r\nand against Mr. Alderman T. S. Day, for acting as Corn Inspector.  A rule\r\n_nisi_ was obtained against Mr. Patteson on May 30th, 1829, and was made\r\nabsolute on July 4th, after that gentleman had resigned the\r\ntreasurership.\r\n\r\n29.--The 6th Inniskilling Dragoons marched from Norwich for Chesterfield\r\nand Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--A troop of the 12th Lancers arrived at Norwich, from Canterbury.\r\n\r\n7.--Died, aged 72, at New York, Mr. John B.

The truth is that the\r\nbells were set out by the ringers upon speculation, and they were\r\nafterwards handsomely rewarded by the Catholics for their liberalism, the\r\nvenality of which is disgusting enough.\"\r\n\r\n4.--The body of a woman, named Ann Coe, buried two days previously, in\r\nFincham churchyard, was disinterred and stolen.  \"The churchyard is _very\r\nnear the turnpike road_.

Bull, the Norwegian violinist, appeared at a morning concert\r\nheld at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.  The vocalists were Mdlle. De\r\nAngiole, Signor Curioni, and Mr. Bochisa.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Municipal elections were held for the first time on this date, under\r\nthe Municipal Reform Act.  At Norwich the contests in the eight wards\r\nresulted in the return of eight Conservatives and eight Whig-Radicals.\r\n\r\n--Died at King's Lynn, Mr. Joseph Waters, for many years a prominent\r\nmerchant in that town.  \"This melancholy event took place owing to a\r\nviolent fright which he received in the Theatre on that day.\"\r\n\r\n4.--In the Court of King's Bench commenced a long course of litigation in\r\nwhich the Corporation of Norwich was concerned.  Sir W. Follett applied\r\nfor a rule to shew cause why a _quo warranto_ should not be filed calling\r\nupon Mr. Thomas Brightwell to show by what authority he claimed to\r\nexercise the office of Alderman.  It was explained that after the passing\r\nof the Municipal Reform Act a certain number of Aldermen were elected for\r\nthe city.  Instead of each being nominated separately, they were all\r\nproposed and elected in a batch, which, it was contended, was clearly\r\nillegal.  The court granted the application.  A similar rule was applied\r\nfor against the Mayor, Mr. Springfield, for, it was argued, if the\r\nAldermen had not themselves been properly elected, they could not elect a\r\nMayor.  A rule was also granted in this case.  On November 24th the rule\r\nwas made absolute in the case of Mr. Brightwell, and enlarged in the case\r\nof Mr. Springfield.  In the Bail Court on the same date Mr. Kelly\r\nobtained rules _nisi_ calling upon fourteen persons to show by what\r\nauthority they took upon themselves to act as Aldermen.  On December 19th\r\nthe Attorney-General applied in the Rolls Court for an injunction to\r\nrestrain the Mayor and Corporation from defraying out of the municipal\r\nfunds the expenses incurred in defending the _quo warrantos_ in the Court\r\nof King's Bench, calling upon Messrs. Springfield and Brightwell to show\r\ncause by what authority they held the offices, the former of Mayor and\r\nthe latter of Alderman, as well as the expenses attending the\r\npresentation of a petition to the Lord Chancellor to appoint new trustees\r\nof the funds of the public charities, the management of which was vested\r\nin the Corporation.  The bill charged the defendants with applying the\r\nCorporation funds wrongfully, in a manner inconsistent with the duties of\r\na Mayor and Corporation, and in direct violation of the provisions of the\r\nMunicipal Corporation Act, by applying them for the aforesaid purposes,\r\nin consequence of certain resolutions to which the corporate body had\r\ncome.  The effect of these resolutions was that the City Treasurer should\r\nfrom time to time pay out of the city funds such sums of money as the\r\ncommittee of the Corporation should deem necessary towards defraying the\r\nexpenses of the _quo warrantos_ and petition above-named.  The defendants\r\nput in two demurrers to the bill, and Lord Langdale said he would\r\nconsider the case before pronouncing judgment.  (_See_ January 13th,\r\n1837.)\r\n\r\n5.*--\"We wish to direct the attention of landowners and farmers in\r\nNorfolk to the extraordinary success which has attended the attempt of\r\nMr. R. Crawshay, of Honingham Hall, to cultivate hops in Norfolk.  A\r\nsample of them may now be seen at Norgate and Co.'s, which competent\r\njudges have declared to surpass the growth of any other county in the\r\nkingdom.  Our agriculturists will be deeply indebted to this gentleman\r\nfor proving to them that a valuable plant indigenous to the soil may be\r\ncultivated with profitable success in Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\n9.--Mr. Thomas Brightwell was elected Mayor, and Mr. John Bateman\r\nappointed Sheriff, of Norwich.\r\n\r\n23.--A musical festival took place at Fakenham parish church.  \"The\r\nMessiah\" was rendered in the morning, and \"Judas Maccabeus\" in the\r\nevening.  The soloists were supplied by the choir of Norwich Cathedral.\r\n\"Admission, middle aisle, 3s.; other parts, 2s.\"\r\n\r\n26.*--\"The allotment system has been tried on a tolerably large scale in\r\nthe parish of Attleborough, by Sir John Smyth, Bart., of Woodmarston\r\nHall, Surrey, lord of the manor of Attleborough.  The allotments are let\r\nat moderate rents, not exceeding the rent of similar lands in farm, with\r\nthe addition of the tithes and other charges which are paid by the\r\nlandlord.\"\r\n\r\n28.--Sir James Flower's hounds met at Stow, where the stag was turned off\r\nand was taken at Garboldisham Lings, after a run of five hours.  The\r\ndistance from point to point was about eleven miles, but the stag ran at\r\nleast 40 miles, and the only horsemen up at the finish were the huntsman\r\nand first whip.\r\n\r\n29.--A severe gale occurred.  A large wooden building erected at the\r\nRanelagh Gardens, Norwich, for circus performances, was blown down by the\r\ntremendous violence of the wind.  \"The great oak at Necton, for which the\r\nlate Mr. William Mason was offered by a shipwright at Lynn, in 1812, 120\r\nguineas, had two arms blown off it, each the size of ordinary timber\r\ntrees.\"  Barns and wheat stacks were blown down at Necton, Ashill, West\r\nBradenham, and Beeston.  At Carbrooke a windmill, the property of Mr.\r\nRobert Homes, was wrecked, and his son killed.\r\n\r\n--The Freebridge Lynn Hundred Association for the encouragement of\r\nagricultural labourers and servants was formed at a meeting held at the\r\nDuke's Head Inn, Lynn.  Sir W. B. ffolkes was elected president; the Rev.\r\nC. D. Brereton, of Little Massingham, secretary; and Mr. B. Aldham,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--The directors of the Norwich Yarn Company having obtained the minimum\r\nsum necessary for commencing their new works on the ground purchased of\r\nMr. Youngman, the first stone of the new factory was laid on this day.\r\nThe event was celebrated by a procession in honour of Bishop Blaize, to\r\nillustrate the pagan story of Jason's argonautic expedition to Colchis in\r\nsearch of the Golden Fleece.  The last celebration of the kind took place\r\nin 1783.  The character of Bishop Blaize was impersonated \"most\r\nappropriately, both as to age and gravity, by Richard Dickerson, comber,\r\nwho had taken part in the former procession.\"  Starting from the premises\r\nof the company, the procession paraded the principal streets of the city,\r\nand halted opposite Mr. Bignold's house in Surrey Street, where an\r\n\"oratorical address\" was delivered by the senior orator, Edward Warman.\r\nAt noon the procession arrived at St. Edmund's, where Mr. Bignold laid\r\nthe foundation stone, and, in addressing the company, stated that the\r\nbuilding about to be erected would be 163 ft. in length, by 42 feet in\r\nwidth, and four storeys high.  As the works already in operation afforded\r\nemployment to 800 people, this mill, which would be one-third larger,\r\nwould yield employment to 1,200.  Upwards of 15,000 pounds had been\r\nraised for defraying the cost of the works.  The procession afterwards\r\nmoved by a circuitous route to St. Andrew's Hall, where the directors\r\nentertained 900 persons who had taken part in the proceedings.  John Sell\r\nCotman, who had sketched the pageant, announced the issue and sale of\r\nfolio prints illustrating the event.  He stated: \"In pure regard of the\r\nchildren of the industrious poor of my native city, I give my labour,\r\nwith the entire profits of the work.\"\r\n\r\n10.--The skeleton of a gigantic whale, taken at Plymouth in October,\r\n1831, was exhibited on the Castle Hill, Norwich.  It measured 85 feet in\r\nlength, and was advertised as \"The Prince of Whales at Home.\"\r\n\r\n25.--Christmas Day was ushered in with snowstorms and hailstorms,\r\nthunder, and lightning.  On the 26th the roads were rendered almost\r\nimpassable by the drifting snow, which, in some localities, was from ten\r\nto twelve feet deep.  Soon all vehicular traffic was stopped.  The\r\nIpswich mail coach, which should have arrived at Norwich on Christmas\r\nDay, did not reach the city until eleven o'clock on the night of the\r\n29th.  It was detained at Thwaite Duke's Head, whence the letter bags\r\nwere despatched in the charge of mounted messengers.  One of the\r\npassengers, Capt. Petre, undertook to walk to Norwich, a distance of\r\ntwenty-eight miles; he arrived in the city on the 28th, and thence\r\nproceeded on his journey to Westwick House.  The Newmarket mail could get\r\nno further than Bury St. Edmund's, and all other public vehicles were\r\ndelayed.  On the Dereham, Fakenham, and other turnpikes gangs of\r\nlabourers were employed to remove the snowdrifts.  There were many\r\nshipping casualties on the Norfolk coast.  Such severe weather had not\r\nbeen experienced since 1799.  The thaw commenced in the middle of\r\nJanuary, 1837, and high floods occurred in the neighbourhood of Norwich\r\nand in other localities.\r\n\r\n26.--Ryan's Royal Circus was opened for the season in a large wooden\r\nbuilding erected at the Ranelagh Gardens, Norwich, by Mr. Bunn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Hannah Manfield (or Saddler), aged 50, a woman of eccentric habits,\r\nresiding on Denver Common, was found dead in her cottage, with her throat\r\ncut.  A considerable quantity of plate had been taken from a cupboard,\r\nand a sum of money, supposed to be nearly 20 pounds, was also stolen.  On\r\nthe 14th Mr. Wright, a police-officer of Lynn, apprehended at Doncaster\r\nJohn Smith, aged 25, John Varnhem, 23, and George Timms, 22, who were\r\ncommitted for trial on the capital charge.  (_See_ April 6th, 1837.)\r\n\r\n5.--In consequence of a resolution passed at a special meeting of the\r\nTown Council, the Mayor of Norwich convened a meeting at the Guildhall on\r\nthis date, \"to take into consideration the sufferings of the poor in this\r\ninclement season, and to adopt measures for relieving the same.\"  A\r\npublic subscription was opened.  At a general meeting of the subscribers,\r\non March 21st, Mr. W. G. Edwards, one of the secretaries, reported that\r\nthe amount subscribed was 2,008 pounds 7s. 3d., out of which a grant of\r\n300 pounds was made to the Sick Poor Society; 20,093 coal tickets, and\r\n37,831 bread tickets were distributed, and 423 pounds 3s. 5d. was placed\r\nin the treasurer's hands to meet future emergencies.\r\n\r\n7.--Wombwell's Menagerie was exhibited on the Castle Meadow, Norwich.\r\nThe proprietor presented to the Museum fine specimens of a lioness, boa\r\nconstrictor, racoon, and kangaroo.\r\n\r\n13.--In the Rolls Court, Lord Langdale gave judgment in the action the\r\nAttorney-General _v._ the Corporation of Norwich.  He said that, as far\r\nas regarded the _quo warrantos_, if a Corporation was not allowed to\r\ndefend an election duly made, the interests of corporations would be\r\nhazarded in every case where a Mayor or other officer did not chose to be\r\nat the expense of defending his own election against a rule _nisi_.  It\r\nwas not a reasonable construction of the new statute that corporations\r\nhad no interests whatever in the charitable trusts of boroughs.  It was\r\ntrue that the administration of charitable estates was distinct from the\r\nadministration of borough funds, and that neither a corporation as a body\r\nnor any member thereof in his corporate capacity ought to be trustees of\r\nsuch estates; still, a corporation, in attending to the public benefits\r\nof the inhabitants of a borough, had a due interest in the appointment of\r\nthose trustees.  Under all the circumstances of the case, therefore, he\r\nwas of opinion that the demurrers must be allowed.  At Norwich Assizes on\r\nApril 6th, before Mr. Justice Parke, the case Rex _v._ Brightwell was\r\ntried by a special jury.  This was an information in the nature of a _quo\r\nwarranto_, calling upon the defendant to show by what authority he\r\nexercised the office of Alderman.  Mr. Andrews, for the defendant,\r\ncontended that if he was not a good Alderman he was not a good Mayor; and\r\nif he had not been legally elected Alderman, then all the other Aldermen\r\nwho had been elected in the same way were elected equally contrary to the\r\nlaw, and all the proceedings which had taken place respecting the police\r\nand borough rates would be bad, and the Corporation of the city entirely\r\ndissolved, and nothing could cure the defect but a fresh Act of\r\nParliament.  Mr. Kelly, for the Crown, urged that the law of England had\r\nfixed from time immemorial that corporate officers should not be elected\r\nin one batch, but that they must be proposed and voted for separately,\r\nand that all elections conducted in any other way were null and void.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for the Crown.  In the Court of King's Bench,\r\non April 19th, application was made to move a rule to show cause why the\r\nverdict for the Crown could not be set aside, on the ground that the\r\nelection was perfectly fair, and there was no pretence for saying that\r\nthe wishes and intentions of the electors had not been carried into\r\neffect.  A rule was granted.  In the Court of Chancery, on May 6th, the\r\ncase assumed another phase.  An information was filed against the\r\nCorporation by Mr. Samuel Bignold, alleging that they intended to divert\r\ntheir funds from corporate purposes by paying the expenses incurred by\r\nthe Town Clerk and other persons who had proceeded to London to support a\r\npetition presented to the Lord Chancellor, in order to secure the return\r\nof certain persons as trustees of the charities hitherto vested in the\r\nold Corporation; and by paying the expenses arising out of the\r\nproceedings by _quo warranto_ in the cases of Mr. Springfield and Mr.\r\nBrightwell.  The further hearing was adjourned till next term.  On May\r\n22nd it was reported to the Court of King's Bench that at a meeting of\r\nthe Town Council on the 19th, an order was passed \"that 1,000 pounds be\r\npaid to the Town Clerk on account of disbursements by him relative to law\r\nproceedings,\" such law proceedings being the matter in which the\r\ninjunction had been applied for.  The Lord Chancellor, on the 24th,\r\ngranted an order to restrain the payment of the amount.  The appeal from\r\nthe decision of the Master of the Rolls, allowing a demurrer on the\r\ninformation filed by Mr. Bignold, came before the Court of Chancery on\r\nMay 27th.  The Lord Chancellor, after adjournment, gave judgment on the\r\ndemurrer against the injunction, and confirmed the decision of the Master\r\nof the Rolls, with costs.  At a meeting of the Town Council on June 2nd,\r\nMr. Bignold expressed his intention to carry the case to the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\n13.--Died at St. Gregory's, Norwich, aged 81, Mr. William Lorkin.  \"He\r\nwas for 65 years a member of the Wesleyan Methodist body, having joined\r\nthem soon after Mr. Wesley first visited Norwich.\"  In 1825 he published\r\na work entitled \"A concise history of the establishment of Wesleyan\r\nMethodism in Norwich.\"\r\n\r\n28.--The influenza epidemic at this date prevailed in city and county,\r\nand cases occurred in almost every family.\r\n\r\n--An omnibus \"upon the London plan\" commenced running between Norwich and\r\nNorth Walsham.\r\n\r\n--The Magnet coach, from the Swan and Rampant Horse Inns, was advertised\r\nto do the journey from Norwich to London, through Thetford and Newmarket,\r\nevery night, in twelve hours.  \"The proprietors, in returning thanks for\r\nthe very liberal patronage bestowed on them, beg most respectfully to\r\ninform their friends and the public that they have, at an additional\r\nexpense, fixed a light inside this coach, which, having given such\r\nuniversal satisfaction, will be continued.\"\r\n\r\n31.--At a meeting of the Conservative party at the Norfolk Hotel,\r\nNorwich, held under the presidency of Col. Harvey, the Marquis of Douro\r\nwas asked to become a candidate for the representation of the city, in\r\nplace of Lord Viscount Stormont, M.P., who had acceded to the request of\r\nthe electors of his own county, Perthshire, to offer himself as their\r\ncandidate on the dissolution of Parliament.  The requisition to the\r\nMarquis was signed by 1,600 of the electors of Norwich; his lordship\r\ncomplied with the request and issued his address on February 13th.  Lord\r\nDouro and the sitting member, the Hon. Robert Campbell Scarlett,\r\ncommenced a personal canvass of the city on June 16th, and in the evening\r\nattended a meeting of the Orange and Purple Club, at the Maid's Head\r\nHotel, at which they were unanimously adopted Conservative candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n24.--During a severe gale from the N.N.W., accompanied by heavy snow\r\nsqualls, the Raby Castle, of 60 tons burden (Greensides, master), went\r\nashore at Salthouse, and became a total wreck.  She was bound from London\r\nto Stockton, with a valuable cargo.  The crew and passengers were saved.\r\n\"When she broke up the beach was strewed with spirits, wine, oranges,\r\nnuts, teas, toys, hampers, boxes, &c.  The scene beggared description.\r\nThe most outrageous and beastly conduct was exhibited.  Here might be\r\nobserved a group broaching a spirit cask, and letting it run into their\r\noil-skin hats, shoes, &c.  There another stood filling their pockets and\r\nhandkerchiefs.  Plunder, wholesale plunder, appeared to be the order of\r\nthe day, in spite of contingents of coastguard men.  Many who were\r\ncharged to watch the property became themselves intoxicated.  Many were\r\nconveyed from the beach literally dead drunk, and it is with disgust we\r\nadd that many women were in the same state.\"  The cargo of the Raby\r\nCastle was worth 5,000 pounds; about 800 pounds worth was recovered.  The\r\nvessel was sold by auction for 41 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--A fine specimen of the sea eagle was shot at Blickling.  It measured\r\nfrom tip to tip of the extended wings 7 ft. 3.5 inches, and from the head\r\nto the tail 3 ft.  Dowager Lady Suffield presented it to the Norfolk and\r\nNorwich Museum.\r\n\r\n13.--The tolls arising from the Norwich provision and cattle markets, and\r\nfrom Tombland Fair, were, for the first time, put up to public auction\r\nand let for the term of two years.  The dues and stallage accruing from\r\nthe provision and vegetable markets were let to Mr. Eccleston, jun., for\r\n985 pounds; of the cattle market on the Castle Ditches to Mr. Liddelow,\r\nfor 480 pounds; and of Tombland Fair, &c., to Mr. Cooke for 250 pounds.\r\n\r\n16.--Died at his residence, Chapel Field, Norwich, aged 48, Mr. Alfred\r\nPettet, organist of St. Peter Mancroft and St. Stephen's.  Mr. S.\r\nCritchfield was elected his successor at St. Peter's, and Mr. Harcourt\r\nwas appointed organist at St. Stephen's.  A performance of \"The Messiah\"\r\nwas given at St. Andrew's Hall on May 26th for the benefit of the widow\r\nand family of the deceased, by the choir of the Cathedral and the members\r\nof the Choral Society, under the direction of Mr. Buck.\r\n\r\n18.*--\"From an idea that when the new Registration Act comes into\r\noperation the fees will be increased, numbers of persons have thronged\r\nYarmouth parish church for several Sundays past, to have their children\r\nbaptised, in order to avoid additional expense.\"\r\n\r\n--Matters were brought before the Lord Chancellor in relation to affairs\r\nof the Norwich charities arising from the Master's report assigning the\r\nseveral charities to certain lists of trustees, and naming the parties to\r\nexecute the respective trusts.  The only new point noticed was the\r\nexception taken by a cross petition on the part of Mr. Bignold and Mr.\r\nRackham to the Master's report, first as to his rejecting _en masse_\r\nevery individual who was at its close, or ever had been, a member of the\r\nold Corporation; and, secondly, in not assigning to the Church list the\r\nBoys' and Girls' Hospital trusts.  The Chancellor decided against the\r\ncross petition.  (The leading charity of the city, the Bishopgate Street\r\nHospital, whose revenues formed two-thirds of the whole of the trusts,\r\nwas secured to a body of trustees composed exclusively of members of the\r\nChurch of England.)  In the House of Lords on April 24th Mr. Samuel\r\nBignold and Mr. William Rackham appealed from the order of the Lord\r\nChancellor referring it to the Master to approve of the trustees of the\r\ncharity estates of the Corporation.  Their lordships decided that they\r\nhad jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and time was given for the\r\nrespondents to prepare their case.\r\n\r\n20.--Mr. Villebois' staghounds had a remarkable run.  The stag was\r\nuncarted on Bradenham Green, and ran to Shipdham.  It was then headed\r\nback to Saham, after which it went to Ovingon, and thence to Watton,\r\nScoulton, Ellingham, Caston, and Rocklands.  Bearing away for\r\nAttleborough and Besthorpe, it crossed the stream and went through\r\nSnetterton, Eccles, and Larlingford, to Roudham, where it was taken after\r\na run of 35 miles.  \"James Lynn, the huntsman, rode his favourite horse,\r\nCockfighter, which carried him at least eighty miles that day.  What\r\nmakes the run more remarkable is that the deer did not run more than 200\r\nyards upon any roads during the whole distance.\"\r\n\r\n22.--A fire occurred at Rollesby Workhouse, which completely destroyed\r\none half of the building.  \"The clause of the Poor Law Bill, by which men\r\nare separated from their wives, being carried into effect, caused a great\r\ndisturbance,\" and it was supposed that the fire resulted from motives of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\n27.--Mr. G. V. Brooke appeared at Lynn Theatre in the character of Romeo.\r\n\r\n30.--At a meeting held at the King's Head Inn, Diss, the Rev.

Henry\r\nBathurst, Lord Bishop of Norwich.  His lordship was in the 94th year of\r\nhis age, and had been Bishop of the diocese for 32 years.

The funeral took place on the 14th at\r\nMalvern Church, Worcestershire, and a memorial service was held on the\r\nsame day at Norwich Cathedral.  A funeral sermon was preached on the 16th\r\nby the Dean of Norwich.

The stock of wine consisted of 2,650 bottles, and the library\r\nof 2,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n6.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Coltman, John Smith,\r\nGeorge Timms, and John Varnham, were indicted for the murder of Hannah\r\nManfield (or Saddler), on the night of the 2nd, or morning of the 3rd of\r\nJanuary.  The trial commenced at 10.20 in the morning, and concluded at\r\nfifteen minutes past midnight, when the jury returned a verdict of\r\nguilty, and the prisoners were sentenced to death.  The sentence on\r\nVarnham was commuted on an ample confession by the other prisoners.\r\nLarge numbers of persons arrived at Norwich on April 22nd, to witness the\r\nexecution, which, however, had been ordered for the 29th.  A full\r\ndescriptive account of the supposed execution, and of the behaviour of\r\nthe men on the gallows, with a copy of their confessions and their \"last\r\ndying words,\" was hawked about the streets of the city.  The capital\r\nsentence was duly carried out on the 29th.  The procession issued from\r\nthe castle doors at noon, headed by a number of javelin men of the High\r\nSheriff's posse.  Smith, who was in the last stage of a rapid decline,\r\nwas assisted to the scaffold.  \"After the bolt was drawn and the bodies\r\nswung round, a piercing cry of horror rose from the dense mass of people\r\nof both sexes.  After hanging the usual space of time the bodies were\r\ntaken down and carried into the interior of the gaol, when all the\r\nprisoners were brought forward to view them in the place where they lay.\"\r\n\r\n7.--North Walsham Steeplechases took place over a four mile course on the\r\nestate of Mr. Bidwell, at Swafield.  The heavy weight race was won by\r\nLord Suffield's Metternich (Capt. Lawrenson, 17th Lancers), second Mr.\r\nThompson's Mungo (owner); and the light weight race by Mr. Sandiford's\r\nGulnoire (Mr. Brown); Mr. Hornor's O'Connell (owner) second.  Lord\r\nSuffield presided at the race dinner, afterwards held at the King's Arms\r\nInn, and presented the silver tankard, given and won by himself in the\r\nheavy weight race, to Capt. Lawrenson.  A large coloured plate,\r\nillustrating the start of the eleven horses for the heavy weight race,\r\n\"with a distant view of the country, from sketches made on the spot by\r\nGeorge Fenn, animal portrait painter, Beccles,\" was subsequently\r\nadvertised.\r\n\r\n11.--James Greenacre, who on this day was found guilty, at the Central\r\nCriminal Court, of the murder of Hannah Brown, in the Edgeware Road, was\r\na Norfolk man, and was born in 1785, at North Runcton, near Lynn.

Brooke (then under twenty years of age) made his first\r\nappearance at Norwich Theatre as Romeo.  \"His performance was of that\r\nsuperior kind, exhibiting all the fervour and enthusiasm of youth\r\nattempered by that discriminating judgment and illumined by those nice\r\nand acute perceptions which belong to the faculties of much maturer\r\nyears.\"  He afterwards appeared as Ion, Othello, Rolla, Richard the\r\nThird, William Tell, Hamlet, Rosenberg (\"Ella Rosenberg\"), Macbeth, and\r\nTeddy (\"Teddy the Tiler\"), and concluded his engagement on May 20th.\r\nBrooke was re-engaged for two nights' performances, commencing on August\r\n1st, when he played the part of Walter Tyrrel, in a new drama of that\r\ntitle, and of Frederick Bury (\"The Youthful Queen\").\r\n\r\n20.--A meeting, presided over by Col.

Handbills inviting tenders for\r\nthe work have for some time been in circulation.  The principal object of\r\ndemolition is the splendid east window of the south isle, one of the most\r\nelaborate examples of a highly-enriched style of architecture in the\r\ncounty.  This capacious building has long been suffering from the effects\r\nof mutilations which every admirer of our antient ecclesiastical\r\narchitecture must lament.  The modern and ghastly eastern windows of the\r\nnorth isle and chancel are deformities which would disgrace a dilapidated\r\nchurch of the meanest village.\"\r\n\r\n15.--Mr. Farren, of Covent Garden, and Mr. J.

He finished the undertaking on Saturday, June\r\n27th.  After he had crossed Foundry Bridge on his last return journey he\r\nwas followed by a tremendous crowd, who bore the toll collectors before\r\nthem and made a free passage.  The only remuneration Mountjoy received\r\nfor his self-imposed task were the contributions prompted by the\r\ngenerosity of the public.  On July 13th, at Ranelagh Gardens, he ran a\r\nmile, walked backwards a mile, ran a wheelbarrow half a mile, trundled a\r\nhoop a mile, hopped 200 yards, picked up with his mouth 40 hazel nuts\r\nplaced a yard apart without putting his knees to the ground, and jumped\r\nover 30 hurdles ten yards apart within five minutes of the time\r\nstipulated, one hour.

Leaving Ranelagh Gardens at four\r\no'clock in the morning, he reached Wymondham at 5.5 and Thetford at 9.20,\r\nBarton Mills before 11, and Newmarket at 12.45.

Page, and the entire cost of the\r\nwork was 2,400 pounds.  \"More than 300 years have elapsed since a parish\r\nchurch has been raised in this city.  Of the 36 churches, St. Andrew's is\r\nthe last that was erected, or rather rebuilt, about the year 1500, on the\r\nsite of an ancient church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--On the opening of the Eastern Counties Railway from Shoreditch to\r\nBrentwood, the London coaches from Norwich, Yarmouth, and other places in\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk there transferred their passengers and mails to the\r\ntrains in communication with the Metropolis.\r\n\r\n4.*--\"The very antient _lectorium_ or reading-desk which has for many\r\nyears lain neglected in Norwich Cathedral has, by order of the Hon. the\r\nVery Rev. the Dean, recently been restored, and is now placed in the\r\nchoir.  It was originally adorned with figures, which, in the time of the\r\nusurpation, were destroyed or mutilated.

Harrison, many years a popular actor on the\r\nNorwich stage.\r\n\r\n31.--Married, Mr. Charles Fisher, of the Norfolk and Suffolk Company of\r\nComedians, to Miss Richardson, only daughter of Richard Richardson,\r\ngent., of Swafield, North Walsham.\r\n\r\n--The non-commissioned officers and men of the East Norfolk Yeomanry\r\nCavalry presented to Major Charles Loftus a silver candelabrum, in\r\n\"testimony of the sincere regard and admiration which they bear towards\r\nhim both as their commanding officer and as a private gentleman.\"  The\r\npresentation was made by Lord James Townshend, at a dinner given at the\r\nKing's Arms Inn, East Dereham, under the presidency of Quarter-Master\r\nWood.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Sir John Patteson and Sir Edward Hall Alderson, the Judges of Assize,\r\narrived at Norwich.\r\n\r\n3.--Mr. Yates, Mr. and Mrs. Keeley, and Mr. Paul Bedford commenced a six\r\nnights' engagement at Norwich Theatre for the Assize week, in the new\r\ndrama, \"Jack Shephard.\"  Mrs. Keeley appeared in the title _role_, Mr.\r\nYates as Abram Monday, and Mr. Bedford as Joe Blueskin.

A singular feature of the case was that none of the murdered\r\nwoman's relatives were aware that she was married to the prisoner.\r\nRandalsome had formed an illicit acquaintance with a girl named Punchard,\r\nand desired to be rid of his wife.  Having enticed her from the house of\r\nher father, with whom she resided, he wounded her severely about the head\r\nand face with a hedge stake, and threw her into a pond.  The medical\r\nevidence proved that death resulted from drowning.  The jury returned a\r\nverdict of guilty, and the prisoner was executed on the Castle Hill,\r\nNorwich, on August 22nd.\r\n\r\n--The new Amphitheatre and Royal Albert Saloon, Ranelagh Gardens, St.\r\nStephen's Gates, Norwich, was opened.  \"The building is after a new\r\ndesign, constructed with great solidarity, and on a considerably\r\nincreased scale of dimensions.

Round the spacious arena rise lower and upper\r\ntiers of boxes splendidly fitted up.  The entrance to the circle and\r\nboxes is through a lofty and well-proportioned saloon, about 70 ft. long\r\nand 30 ft. wide.  The facade of the building presents above the principal\r\nentrance an open portico of three arches looking into the gardens; and\r\nthere is an exactly similar arcade opening internally towards the\r\ntheatre.\"  A portion of the building here described is now the Victoria\r\nStation of the Great Eastern Railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--At the King's Head Inn, Diss, the brewery, public-houses, mansion,\r\nfarm, and other property of Mr. Robert Sheriffe, of Diss, were sold by\r\nauction by Mr. W. W. Simpson, of London.  The brewery and public-houses\r\nwere purchased by Mr. Samuel Farrow, and the amount realised by the three\r\ndays' sale was 50,000 pounds.  \"The great increase in the value of\r\ncountry public-houses apparent from the enormous prices which have lately\r\nbeen realised for this description of property leads us to believe that\r\nthe shook which the trade suffered on the passing of the Beer Bill some\r\nyears since has been entirely recovered, and that country public-houses\r\nare now even of greater value than they were antecedent to the passing of\r\nthat measure.\"\r\n\r\n9.--The two days' annual race meeting commenced on the Mousehold course,\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\n10.--A \"great ringing festival\" took place at Heydon, to celebrate the\r\nopening of the new peal of bells put up by Thomas and Joshua Hurry, of\r\nNorwich.

The hair and the\r\nbeard remained profuse and perfect, though the flesh of the face as well\r\nas of every other part was totally gone.

It\r\nwas proposed that Col. Harvey should take the chair, but the Chartists\r\nelected one Matthew Smith, a working man.  On the latter assuming the\r\npresidency of the meeting, Col. Harvey, Mr. Bignold, and other gentlemen\r\nleft the hall.  A number of resolutions of a revolutionary character were\r\nadopted, and Dover, at the conclusion of the meeting, congratulated his\r\nfollowers on the success of the gathering, remarking that \"it had cost\r\nthe Tories 20 pounds for bills, and the Whigs 20 pounds for bullies.\"\r\nThe proceedings, which were of a very orderly character, concluded with\r\nthree cheers for Fergus O'Connor.  Meanwhile the gentlemen who had\r\nconvened the original meeting adjourned to the Norfolk Hotel, where they\r\npassed a series of resolutions emphasising the statements contained in\r\nthe requisition.

Dover,\r\nthe Chartist, nominated a third candidate, Mr. William Eagle, of\r\nLakenheath, Suffolk.  \"Conservatives and Whigs, in the show of hands,\r\nvoted against Eagle, and the Sheriff declared the Marquis of Douro and\r\nMr. Smith duly elected.\"  Dover thereupon demanded a poll for Eagle, but\r\nwas unable to deposit one-third of the expense (about 200 pounds).  The\r\nproceedings were temporarily adjourned.  \"Dover then went out of the\r\nroom, and, after the lapse of half an hour, _something_ took place which\r\nour readers will guess by the result.  When Dover came back there was no\r\nfurther demand for a poll--we believe Dover received 50 pounds to\r\nwithdraw the nomination.\"  The rumour quickly spread among the Chartists\r\nthat Dover had \"sold\" them.  The mob waylaid him in Dove Lane, and he\r\nretreated to the Guildhall for protection.  The windows of the room in\r\nwhich he was supposed to have taken refuge were demolished by the stones\r\nthrown by the mob, and the police who went out to quell the disturbance\r\nwere assailed by volleys of brickbats and other missiles.  The 7th\r\nDragoon Guards were called out, the Mayor read the Riot Act, and in the\r\nexcitement and confusion Dover left the Guildhall unnoticed.  On the 29th\r\nthe Chartists assembled in force and went to the King's Head, St.\r\nGeorge's Colegate, where Dover lived with a woman named Charlotte\r\nHumphrey.  They burst into the house and found him armed with his\r\nChartist weapons, which were wrested from him; he was knocked down,\r\nbrutally belaboured, and hurried to the river, and would have been thrown\r\nfrom the bridge had it not been for the piteous intercession of one of\r\nhis children.  The mob were moving towards the Market Place with their\r\nprisoner when he was rescued by the police.  At the same time a\r\ndetachment of dragoons, commanded by Cornet Crofts, with the Mayor at\r\ntheir head, rode up, a coach was procured, and Dover, having been placed\r\ninside, was conveyed, under military escort, to the City Gaol, where his\r\nserious injuries were attended to by the surgeon of the prison.  On the\r\n30th several persons appeared before the magistrates and were punished\r\nfor taking part in the disturbances.  Public tranquillity was somewhat\r\nrestored the same day by a procession in which \"Philip Augustus, the\r\nmusical pieman,\" and \"Jerry, the lucifer match seller, in a military\r\ncostume, with an immense plume of feathers in his cap,\" were \"chaired.\"\r\n\r\n28.--Lord George Bentinck and Sir Stratford Canning were returned\r\nunopposed for the borough of King's Lynn.\r\n\r\n--Mr. W.

His lordship declined to take any part in\r\nthese proceedings.  The objection against one voter having been\r\nsustained, Sir James Flower was placed in a majority, and the Committee\r\nthen passed the following resolution:--\"That the Right Hen. Henry\r\nFitzRoy, commonly called the Earl of Euston, was not duly elected member\r\nfor the borough of Thetford; that Sir James Flower, Bart., was duly\r\nelected, and ought to have been returned; and that the Committee have\r\naltered the poll by striking off the vote of William Burlingham from the\r\npoll of the Earl of Euston.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--Mr. William Bagge and Mr. W.

The action was brought by the executors\r\nof a person of the name of Howes to recover from the company the sum of\r\n1,503 pounds, the amount of a policy on the life of Howes.

The rocket unquestionably carries the furthest, and flies with\r\ngreat precision.

The head is put through a\r\ncircle, and the jacket falls down at the back and the front of the person\r\nwearing it, leaving the arms perfectly free, being suspended from the\r\nshoulders and strapped round the body.  There is a semi-circular thick\r\ncork collar in front and coming under the chin, so that the jacket is not\r\nonly calculated to keep any person afloat in the water, but also to keep\r\nhis head at a sufficient elevation.  It was agreed that the jacket should\r\nbecome the property of the society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--An appalling loss of life was occasioned at Yarmouth by the fall of\r\nthe Suspension Bridge, which had been the subject of so much litigation\r\nbetween Mr. Cory and the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway Company.  A clown\r\nnamed Nelson, belonging to Cooke's Equestrian Circus, had announced that\r\nhe would perform the feat of sailing in a tub drawn by four geese from\r\nthe old Draw Bridge to the Suspension Bridge.  Thousands of persons\r\nassembled to witness the spectacle, and upon the bridge itself there were\r\nbetween 400 and 500.  The bridge, which was the chief means of transit\r\nfrom the railway terminus to the town, and had been widened to admit of\r\nincreased traffic by a footpath constructed on either side, was suspended\r\nfrom two piers.  Just as the clown was entering the Bure, at ten minutes\r\nto six o'clock, there was a rush to the south side of the bridge, the\r\nsuspension rods snapped, the chains gave way, and \"the bridge fell on\r\nthat side like the leaf of a table let down,\" pouring the crowd upon it\r\ninto the water.  A terrible scene ensued.  As many as possible were\r\nrescued and conveyed to the Vauxhall Gardens, but notwithstanding the\r\nefforts made by watermen in boats and upon the river banks, there was\r\nfearful loss of life.  An inquest was opened at the Church Hall on the\r\n3rd, when Mr. Cooke, the proprietor of the circus, intimated that he\r\nwould at once withdraw his company from the town.  The inquiry was\r\nadjourned from time to time, and at the last sitting Mr. James Walker,\r\nC.E., who had been sent down to examine into the cause of the disaster,\r\nreported: (1) the immediate cause of the accident was a defect in the\r\nwelding of the bar which first gave way; (2) that the quality of the iron\r\nand the workmanship were defective, and the accident would not have\r\nhappened had the work been properly examined at the time of construction;\r\n(3) the widening of the bridge appeared to have been made without\r\nsufficient reference to its original strength and the weight which it had\r\nto support; and (4) that in the original construction of the bridge the\r\ncasualty of a great load all on one side did not appear to have been\r\ncontemplated.  The jury returned a verdict in accordance with Mr.\r\nWalker's conclusions.  The number of dead bodies recovered was 77; some,\r\nhowever, were supposed to have been carried away by the current.  Nearly\r\nall the sufferers were children or very young persons, but it was related\r\nas \"a very extraordinary circumstance\" that \"Mr. Thomas Bowles, aged 84,\r\nwho was on board the Royal George when she sank, and who is probably the\r\nonly living survivor, should have been on the Suspension Bridge during\r\nthe late accident.  He was precipitated into the water, but was once more\r\nmiraculously saved.\"\r\n\r\n3.--The Norfolk Yeomanry Cavalry assembled at East Dereham in stronger\r\nforce than on any previous occasion, for eight days' permanent duty.\r\n\r\n--The last troop of the 4th Dragoons marched from Norwich Barracks, and\r\nwere, on the same day, replaced by the 7th Hussars.\r\n\r\n5.--Died at West Somerton, aged 74, \"Mr. William Hales, father of nine\r\nchildren, whose united heights amount to 57 ft. 6 in., including the\r\nNorfolk giant and giantess.\"\r\n\r\n7.--The experiment was made at Norwich Theatre of still further reducing\r\nthe prices of admission to 2s. 6d. for dress boxes, and to 1s. 6d. for\r\nthe upper circle.\r\n\r\n8.--Mr. Walter Morgan, aged 23, of the firm of Messrs.

He\r\nhad witnessed the drama in its high and palmy state; he had seen its\r\ngradual decline.  Many had been the causes assigned for this decay--the\r\nincrease of Dissent and fanaticism on the one hand, errors of management\r\non the other, and the reduction of prices.\"\r\n\r\n29.--A prize-fight took place on Mousehold Heath, Norwich, between Jim\r\nWoods and Ben Clarke, \"the Norfolk Slasher,\" for 5 pounds a side.  Woods\r\nwas the favourite, at 5 to 2, and obtained \"first blood,\" but in the\r\nsecond round Clarke struck him a severe blow on the temple and felled\r\nhim.  In the third round Clarke put in another blow, and as his opponent\r\nwas falling, struck him behind the ear and laid him senseless.  Clarke\r\nwas declared the winner, after a contest which lasted only five minutes.\r\n\r\n--The Norfolk Railway was opened.  The directors ran a special train from\r\nTrowse to Cambridge, by which about 200 guests, including the Dean and\r\nMayor of Norwich, were conveyed.  A special train from London brought a\r\nlike contingent to Cambridge, where luncheon was served, under the\r\npresidency of the chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway, Mr. Henry\r\nBosanquet.  One of the first projects for a long line was the proposal to\r\nconstruct a railway between London and Norwich, _via_ Thetford, with a\r\ncontinuation to Yarmouth.  A prospectus was printed and partially\r\ncirculated in 1825, but the scheme was abandoned.  In 1835 the prospectus\r\nof the Eastern Counties (or Grand Eastern Counties) Railway appeared.\r\nThe requisite notices were published in November of that year,\r\napplication was made in the ensuing session of Parliament for a Bill, and\r\nthe first Act for the construction of the works received the Royal assent\r\non July 4th, 1836.  Up to 1840 this line was opened only as far as Warley\r\nLane, between Brentwood and Warley Common.  In 1843 it was completed as\r\nfar as Colchester, but as the original capital was more than expended in\r\ncarrying the line that distance, all hope of proceeding to Norwich was\r\nabandoned.  In 1839 two Acts connected with the Northern and Western\r\nCompany were passed, and received the Royal assent on July 19th.  The\r\nfirst was for the purpose of extending the time for the purchase of land\r\nas far as Bishop's Stortford, and the second was chiefly to confirm an\r\nagreement with the Eastern Counties Company as to the terms, &c., for\r\npassing over their line.  In 1840 another Act was passed, receiving the\r\nRoyal assent on June 4th, for reducing the joint stock capital to 700,000\r\npounds, giving the company power to raise 240,000 pounds on debentures so\r\nsoon as one moiety of the capital should be paid off, and abandoning that\r\nportion of the line between Bishop's Stortford and Cambridge.  In 1840\r\nthe idea of railway communication between Norwich and the Metropolis was\r\nrevived, and it was resolved to form a company, to be styled the Norfolk,\r\nSuffolk, and Cambridge Railway Company.  It was afterwards known as the\r\nEast Anglian Railway Company.  It received the support of the landowners'\r\ncommittee in Norfolk, and the expense was estimated as follows: From\r\nBishop's Stortford to Cambridge, 22 miles, 572,000 pounds; from Cambridge\r\nto Norwich, 63 miles, 1,126,695 pounds; from Norwich to Yarmouth, 18\r\nmiles, 291,512 pounds.  After the opening of the Yarmouth and Norwich\r\nline according to the plan of Mr. Stephenson, the project for the East\r\nAnglian Railway was dropped for a time, and was revived by the promoters\r\nof the Norwich and Brandon Railway, the prospectus of which was published\r\nin 1843.  The capital to be raised was stated to be 380,000 pounds, in\r\n19,000 shares of 20 pounds each.  In the Session of 1844 an Act was\r\napplied for and received the Royal assent in the month of June.  The line\r\nin connection with that from Yarmouth and with that from Ely to Brandon\r\nresulted, and it was known as the Norfolk Railway.  Messrs. Grissell and\r\nPeto were the contractors, and Messrs. Stephenson and Bidder the\r\nengineers in chief.  The works were commenced at Wymondham on May 17th,\r\n1844, and finished on July 1st, 1845.  The first through train to London\r\nstarted from Trowse on the morning of July 30th.  At that date the swing\r\nbridge at Trowse had not been completed.  Of the travelling it was said\r\nit \"cannot be rendered more comfortable than it is upon the Norfolk\r\nRailway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n12.--The foundation-stone of the Leicester monument was laid in Holkham\r\nPark by Lord Coborne, in the presence of a large gathering of the\r\nnobility and gentry and of the tenant-farmers of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n15.--Died at his residence in Golden Ball Street, Norwich, aged 78, Mr.\r\nJohn Angell, who served the office of Sheriff in 1825 and of Mayor in\r\n1830.\r\n\r\n16.*--\"Within the last few days no less than 500 coach horses have been\r\nsent for sale at Aldridge's Repository, owing to the further opening of\r\nthe Northern and Eastern Railway from Bishop's Stortford by way of Ely\r\nand Thetford to Norwich, and the consequent discontinuation of coaches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--The Brundall estate, consisting of a mansion and 143 acres of land,\r\nthe property of the Rev.

Angerstein,\r\n\"that the Corn Laws and all other laws designed to restrict trade under\r\npretence of protecting particular classes are unjust in principle and\r\ninjurious in operation, and ought to be forthwith abolished,\" was carried\r\nby a large majority, in face of an amendment proposed by Mr. Wodehouse,\r\nM.P., and supported by Lord Hastings, Mr. Hamond of Westacre, and other\r\nprominent Protectionists.  \"Reporters from all the London daily papers\r\nattended the meeting, and the proprietors engaged special trains to carry\r\nback the report of the proceedings.  The first special left Norwich\r\nStation at 8.45 p.m., and reached Shoreditch at 12.40 a.m.; the second\r\nleft at 10.29 p.m. and reached London at 2.38 a.m.  At half-past two p.m.\r\non Wednesday (the 21st) we received the 'Times' containing the speeches\r\nto the extent of rather more than four columns.\"\r\n\r\n7.--Died at Malta, aged 77, the Right Hon. John Hookham Frere, of Roydon\r\nHall, eldest son of Mr. John Frere, formerly member for Norwich.  Mr.\r\nHookham Frere was educated at Eton, where he had Canning as a school\r\ncompanion.  When very young he evinced a love for verse, and made, when\r\nonly an Eton school boy, his clever translation of the Anglo-Saxon War\r\nSong on the victory of Athelstan, written when the Rowley controversy was\r\nat its height.  George Ellis gave it a place in his historical essay\r\nbefore his \"Specimens of the Poets,\" and Scott invariably spoke of it as\r\nsomething more than a mere curiosity.  Another of Mr. Frere's works was a\r\n\"prospectus and specimen\" of his \"Intended National Work by William and\r\nRobert Whistlecraft of Stowmarket in Suffolk, Hemp and Collar Makers,\r\nintended to comprise the most interesting particulars relating to King\r\nArthur and his Round Table\"--the precursor and original of Byron's\r\n\"Beppo\" and \"Don Juan.\"  \"I have written,\" says Byron, \"a poem of 84\r\noctave stanzas, in or after the excellent manner of Mr. Whistlecraft,\r\nwhom I take to be Mr. Frere.\"\r\n\r\n17.*--\"All the coaches between Norwich and London have ceased to run, the\r\nlast being the mail through Bury St. Edmund's, which was discontinued on\r\nthe 6th inst.  Six or seven coaches direct to London from Norfolk have\r\nbeen discontinued, and about 700 horses thrown off the road.  There are,\r\nhowever, about 30 coaches constantly running from various towns to the\r\nprincipal stations between Yarmouth and London.  There are many\r\nomnibuses, cabs, and flys.  The railway has very much increased the\r\nnumber of horse conveyances to and from all the towns along the line.  In\r\nfact, horses are dearer than ever they were and more in demand, and the\r\nconsumption of oats is not likely to be diminished, but rather\r\nincreased.\"  The adverse effects of the railway were shown in the\r\nfollowing paragraph, published on April 25th: \"During the droving season\r\nlast year 9,300 beasts were housed at the Bird-in-Hand public-house,\r\nTasburgh, and the landlord purchased for their consumption, and for\r\nhorses, &c., 50 tons of hay; but so great is the diminution of the\r\ntraffic occasioned by the Norfolk Railway, that during the present season\r\nonly twelve beasts have been taken in, and the landlord has had occasion\r\nfor only eight and a half hundredweight of hay.\"\r\n\r\n21.--The Norwich School of Design was opened by Sir J. P. Boileau, Bart.\r\n\r\n31.*--\"By order of the Mayor and magistrates of Norwich, the shop-keepers\r\nhave had notice that no goods are to be exposed or sold after ten o'clock\r\non Sunday morning, and bakers are not to sell or bake goods after\r\nhalf-past one o'clock in the afternoon.\"  Several tradesmen were\r\nafterwards charged before the magistrates for contravention of the order.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--A large sea-borne vessel, heavily laden with coal, and between 60 and\r\n70 tons burden, was brought up to the head of the navigation at Norwich,\r\nthe first vessel of the kind that had ever got beyond Foundry Bridge.  It\r\nwas a Dutch-built craft, drawing only two feet of water, and was the\r\nproperty of Messrs. Bullard and Watts, St. Michael-at-Coslany Bridge.\r\n\r\n6.--Mr. D. N. Fisher gave the first of three subscription concerts at the\r\nAssembly Rooms, Norwich.  The _artistes_ included Mdlle. Schloss, Madame\r\nand Signor F. Lablache, Mr. W. L. Phillips (principal violoncello), Mr.\r\nD. N. Fisher (leader), Mr. William Sterndale Bennett (director), and Mr.\r\nJames Harcourt (director of rehearsals).  \"The musical world of Norwich\r\nowe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Fisher for introducing to them Mr. William\r\nSterndale Bennett.  As a pianist, Mr. Bennett, without the extravagance\r\nand with less fire and brilliance than Liszt, has all the expression and\r\nmusical enthusiasm of that performer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n27.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Maule, Samuel Yarham was\r\nindicted for the murder of Harriet Candler, at Yarmouth, on November\r\n18th, 1844.  The prisoner, who at the Spring Assizes in 1845 turned\r\nQueen's evidence against three other men (Hall, Mapes, and Royal) charged\r\nwith the murder, had made certain admissions which led to his\r\napprehension at Gloucester, where he had gone to work.  The jury found\r\nhim guilty, and he was sentenced to death.  The execution took place on\r\nthe Castle Hill, Norwich, on April 11th (Tombland Fair-day), in the\r\npresence of 30,000 spectators.  \"Eight hundred persons came from\r\nWymondham in one train; it was found necessary to use bullock-trucks to\r\nconvey the people, there not being a sufficient number of regular\r\ncarriages.\"  The fancy fair (the Sick Poor Repository) and all business\r\nin the city was suspended during the morning.  \"After the execution,\r\ngongs, drums, and other instruments commenced their uproar, mountebanks\r\nand clowns their antics, the vendors of wares and exhibitors of prodigies\r\ntheir cries, while the whirligigs and ups-and-downs were soon in full\r\nswing.  The public-houses round the Hill were crowded, and hundreds\r\nfinished the day in riot and intoxication.  Royal and Hall were on the\r\nHill during the execution, and got jostled by the crowd.  They were\r\nturned out of the Golden Ball public-house and other houses where they\r\npresented themselves.\"  Owing to the scandalous character of the\r\nproceedings, a public meeting was held at St. Andrew's Hall on April\r\n17th, under the presidency of the Mayor, when it was decided to petition\r\nParliament for the abolition of capital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--The first general meeting of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological\r\nSociety was held at the Norfolk and Norwich Museum, under the presidency\r\nof the Lord Bishop of Norwich.\r\n\r\n8.--Died at his residence at Lakenham, aged 81, Mr. Thomas Thurtell,\r\nformerly an Alderman of Norwich, who served the office of Sheriff in\r\n1815, and of Mayor in 1828.  \"He was universally esteemed as an honest\r\nand upright man.\"  (_See_ April 30th.)\r\n\r\n11.--George Clarke, a Norwich pedestrian, commenced a walk of 1,500 miles\r\nin 1,000 successive hours, \"a mile and a half at the beginning of each\r\nhour,\" at the West End Retreat Gardens, Norwich.

Elwin, of Norwich, was presented with a silver coffee\r\nservice, in recognition of \"his promotion of the objects of the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Musical Festival from its institution, in 1824.\"\r\n\r\n18.--The 7th Hussars left Norwich for Ipswich, where they joined\r\nheadquarters and marched for Hounslow.  They were succeeded by the 6th\r\nDragoon Guards (Carabineers), with headquarters and staff.  \"This\r\nregiment received its _nom de guerre_ from being the first corps which\r\ncarried the modern carbine.\"\r\n\r\n20.--The Norwich Board of Health was established as a permanent\r\ninstitution at a meeting held at the Guildhall.  Among its objects was\r\nthe encouragement of vaccination amongst the poor.  The Bishop of Norwich\r\nwas elected president, and the Mayor vice-president.\r\n\r\n21.--Many hundreds of persons attended a steeplechase meeting at East\r\nDereham.  \"The course from the Common was marked out by flags describing\r\na circle round the country, over Mr. Greenacre's piece, across Mr.\r\nNeale's land, and round to the Common again, making a distance of three\r\nand a half miles in two rounds.\"\r\n\r\n--The first stone of the Cromer sea-wall was laid by the vicar, the Rev.\r\nW.

The works were opened amid\r\nmuch festivity on August 7th.\r\n\r\n23.--The North Cove Hall estates were sold at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich,\r\nby Mr. Simpson, for 36,960 pounds.\r\n\r\n29.--At a meeting of \"The Friends of Permanent and Universal Peace,\" held\r\nat St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. J. J. Gurney,\r\nit was resolved: \"That in consideration of the points now at issue\r\nbetween this country and the United States of America, involving, as they\r\ndo, the question of war or peace, an address be presented to the\r\nmagistrates and to the ministers of the several denominations of the city\r\nof Norwich in Connecticut, and generally to the people of the United\r\nStates, asking them to use their endeavours to avert war.\"\r\n\r\n30.--At the Norwich Police Court, Mr. George Thurtell, horticulturist,\r\nwas charged with assaulting a Mr. Riches, of St. George Colegate.  Mr.\r\nRiches was the Norwich correspondent of the \"Daily News,\" and he had sent\r\nto that journal a notice of Mr. Thomas Thurtell's death \"and a private\r\ncommunication respecting one of Mr. Thurtell's sons.\"  Mr. George\r\nThurtell was greatly incensed on seeing the paragraph, more particularly\r\nas his father was not dead at the time, although he had been ill for some\r\nweeks, and meeting the complainant in the Market Place, he severely\r\nchastised him with a whip.  The Bench, who considered the paragraph\r\nhighly improper, imposed upon the defendant the nominal fine of one\r\nshilling.  (_See_ January 5th, 1848.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.--The Norfolk Yeomanry Cavalry commenced eight days' permanent duty at\r\nCromer.\r\n\r\n9.*--\"During the last week as many as 18 seaborne vessels, _via_\r\nLowestoft, many of them of considerable burden, have been lying at\r\nFoundry Bridge, Norwich, laden with coke, coals, and other materials, for\r\ndelivery at the railway station.  This proves how excellent and how\r\npractical was the plan of our late fellow-citizen, Mr. Crisp Brown, and\r\nmust cause universal regret that it then failed.\"\r\n\r\n18.--An inquest was opened at Happisburgh by Mr. Pilgrim, one of the\r\nCounty Coroners, upon the bodies of Jonathan Balls, his wife, and four\r\ngrandchildren, who were believed to have been poisoned.  The bodies had\r\nbeen exhumed, and were placed in a tent erected in the churchyard; peace\r\nofficers were sworn to prevent the incensed villagers from rushing into\r\nthe tent.  Several other bodies were disinterred, and in nearly every\r\ninstance traces of arsenic were found.  At the adjourned inquiry some\r\ncurious facts were elicited.  Suspicion pointed to Balls as having\r\ndestroyed his wife and grandchildren, and then poisoned himself.  His\r\nconduct years previously had been suspicious, children having died\r\nsuddenly while at his house.  What number of persons had been thus\r\ndestroyed it was impossible to ascertain.  The jury found that, in the\r\nmajority of the cases, death resulted from the effects of poison, but how\r\nit was administered there was no evidence to show.\r\n\r\n26.--The bells of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, were rung on the reception\r\nof the news of the birth, on the previous day, of a Princess (Princess\r\nHelena Augusta Victoria).\r\n\r\n31.--Died at Kimberley Hall, in his 76th year, the Right Hon.

His lordship was succeeded in his title and estates by his\r\ngrandson, John Gurdon Wodehouse, son of Henry Wodehouse and of Anne, only\r\ndaughter of Mr. T. T. Gurdon.  The deceased nobleman was a staunch\r\nConservative.  \"He was of commanding appearance, both in personal figure\r\nand dignity of deportment.  During the contest for the representation of\r\nNorfolk in 1806 it was remarked with perfect truth that three finer men\r\nor more perfect gentlemen than Mr. Windham, Mr. Coke, and Col. Wodehouse\r\nnever presented themselves together as candidates for the electoral\r\nsuffrages of a great county.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--A fire occurred at St. James's Factory, Norwich.

On June 30th 6,000 passengers\r\nwere conveyed by two special cheap trains to Yarmouth and back.

The railway journey was performed\r\nin 3 hrs. 35 mins. 15 secs., and was more successful than the trip by the\r\nsteamer known as the Norfolk.  On the return voyage the crew were under\r\nthe influence of drink, bad weather was experienced, and the vessel got\r\nout of her course.  The boiler of the engine of the return train to\r\nLondon burst when a mile and a half from Ely, and the excursionists\r\nalighted from the carriages and walked to that city.  The Norfolk\r\nafterwards plied regularly between Yarmouth and Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n12.--Died, Charlotte Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Lewis Tonna and only daughter\r\nof the Rev.

He was also wounded at Waterloo,\r\nin defending the baggage from an attack by the enemy.  He joined his\r\nregiment (the 13th Light Dragoons) in India in 1819, and brought it home,\r\nhaving the command of it, about five or six years since.  Whilst lying in\r\nNorwich with the regiment, in 1841 and 1842, he was universally beloved\r\nby both officers and men.\"  Col.

The return fare to London is 7s. 6d.\"\r\n\r\n7.--The Wymondham and Dereham Railway was opened for goods traffic.  The\r\nBill for the construction of this railway, which was applied for by the\r\nNorfolk Company, was strenuously opposed by Norwich traders, who\r\nconsidered that a direct line to Dereham would be to their greater\r\nadvantage.  The Act authorised the Company to make an extension of 22.5\r\nmiles from Dereham to Wells, with a branch line of 6.5 miles to Blakeney,\r\nmaking the total from Wymondham 40.5 miles.  Messrs. Grissel and Peto\r\nwere the general contractors, and the electric telegraph was established\r\nunder the superintendence of the Rev. A. Bath Power.  (_See_ February\r\n15th, 1847.)\r\n\r\n18.--Winter set in with great severity.

It would be a great advantage\r\nin this and other counties if a general Act were passed for widening and\r\nlevelling the turnpike roads and for laying down tramways on which\r\ncarriages could be drawn by horses or by engines of small power to the\r\nprincipal railway.  Unless some measure of this sort be carried out, the\r\ncommon roads will soon be of little use, and not worth keeping in\r\nrepair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--A new form of entertainment was introduced at this date--\"Ethiopian\r\nminstrelsy,\" the precursor of the Christy minstrels.

J. Gurney received his early education under the Rev.\r\nM. Browne, of Hingham; he then went to the Academical Institution at\r\nOxford.  He was a great traveller.  Several times he visited the West\r\nIndies, travelled twice on the Continent, made a tour in Scotland, in\r\ncompany with Mr. Hoare, for the purpose of inspecting the prisons, and,\r\naccompanied by Mrs. Fry, he visited Ireland in the spring of 1827, in\r\norder to personally investigate the condition of the prisons and the\r\ncharitable institutions of that country.  On July 8th, 1837, he embarked\r\nat Liverpool for Philadelphia on a Gospel mission to parts of North\r\nAmerica and the West Indies.  Of this tour he gave an interesting account\r\nin \"Familiar Letters to Amelia Opie\"; his \"Winter in the West Indies\" is\r\ndescribed in \"Familiar Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky.\"  He was three\r\ntimes married; his first wife was a daughter of Mr. J. Birkbeck, of Lynn,\r\nhis second a Wiltshire lady, and his third an American lady.

In 1792 she married William Assheton, second Lord\r\nSuffield, and in 1744 her youngest sister, Amelia Ann, was married to\r\nLord Castlereagh.  \"In consequence of this union her connection with the\r\npolitical world was maintained even more intimately than before.\r\nThroughout her life she continued to take a lively interest in the\r\npolitics of the county, and the influence of the united houses of Gunton\r\nand Blickling in the days of contested elections was not lightly esteemed\r\nby conflicting parties.\"  In 1821 she became a widow, and thenceforth\r\ndevoted herself to charitable works.  The family estates descended to the\r\nMarquis of Lothian, her grand-nephew.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--The announcement was made of the engagement of Mr. and Mrs. F.\r\nPhillips as members of the Norwich Company, under the management of Mr.\r\nJoseph Clarence.

R. Pratt) presided over a county\r\nmeeting at the Shirehall, when resolutions condemnatory of the action of\r\nthe Pope were adopted, and an address voted to the Queen.
