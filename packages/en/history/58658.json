I. 1501-1530.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SAN FRANCISCO:\r\n     A. L. BANCROFT & COMPANY, PUBLISHERS.\r\n     1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Entered according to Act of Congress in the Year 1882, by\r\n     HUBERT H. BANCROFT,\r\n     In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _All Rights Reserved._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1875 I published under title of _The Native Races of\r\nthe Pacific States_ what purports to be an exhaustive research into\r\nthe character and customs of the aboriginal inhabitants of the western\r\nportion of North America at the time they were first seen by their\r\nsubduers. The present work is a history of the same territory from the\r\ncoming of the Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe plan is extensive and can be here but briefly explained. The\r\nterritory covered embraces the whole of Central America and Mexico,\r\nand all Anglo-American domains west of the Rocky Mountains. First given\r\nis a glance at European society, particularly Spanish civilization at\r\nabout the close of the fifteenth century. This is followed by a summary\r\nof maritime exploration from the fourth century to the year 1540, with\r\nsome notices of the earliest American books. Then, beginning with the\r\ndiscoveries of Columbus, the men from Europe are closely followed as\r\none after another they find and take possession of the country in its\r\nseveral parts, and the doings of their successors are chronicled. The\r\nresult is a HISTORY OF THE PACIFIC STATES OF NORTH AMERICA, under the\r\nfollowing general divisions:—_History of Central America_; _History of\r\nMexico_; _History of the North Mexican States_; _History of New Mexico\r\nand Arizona_; _History of California_; _History of Nevada_; _History of\r\nUtah_; _History of the Northwest Coast_; _History of Oregon_; _History\r\nof Washington, Idaho, and Montana_; _History of British Columbia_, and\r\n_History of Alaska_.\r\n\r\nBroadly stated, my plan as to order of publication proceeds\r\ngeographically from south to north, as indicated in the list above\r\ngiven, which for the most part is likewise the chronological order of\r\nconquest and occupation. In respect of detail, to some extent I reverse\r\nthis order, proceeding from the more general to the more minute as I\r\nadvance northward. The difference, though considerable, is however less\r\nin reality than in appearance. And the reason I hold sufficient. To\r\ngive to each of the Spanish-American provinces, and later to each of the\r\nfederal and independent states, covering as they do with dead monotony\r\ncenturies of unchanging action and ideas, time and space equal to that\r\nwhich may be well employed in narrating north-western occupation and\r\nempire-building would be no less impracticable than profitless. It is\r\nmy aim to present complete and accurate histories of all the countries\r\nwhose events I attempt to chronicle, but the annals of the several\r\nCentral American and Mexican provinces and states, both before and after\r\nthe Revolution, run in grooves too nearly parallel long to command the\r\nattention of the general reader.\r\n\r\nIn all the territorial subdivisions, southern as well as northern, I\r\ntreat the beginnings and earliest development more exhaustively than\r\nlater events. After the Conquest, the histories of Central America\r\nand Mexico are presented on a scale sufficiently comprehensive, but\r\nnational rather than local. The northern Mexican states, having had a\r\nmore varied experience, arising from nearer contact with progressional\r\nevents, receive somewhat more attention in regard to detail than other\r\nparts of the republic. To the Pacific United States is devoted more\r\nspace comparatively than to southern regions, California being regarded\r\nas the centre and culminating point of this historical field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the _History of Central America_, to which this must serve as\r\nspecial as well as general introduction, I would say that, besides the\r\nstandard chroniclers and the many documents of late printed in Spain and\r\nelsewhere, I have been able to secure a number of valuable manuscripts\r\nnowhere else existing; some from the Maximilian, Ramirez, and other\r\ncollections, and all of Mr E. G. Squier's manuscripts relating to the\r\nsubject fell into my hands. Much of the material used by me in writing\r\nof this very interesting part of the world has been drawn from obscure\r\nsources, from local and unknown Spanish works, and from the somewhat\r\nconfused archives of Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador, and\r\nGuatemala.\r\n\r\nMaterial for the history of western North America has greatly increased\r\nof late. Ancient manuscripts of whose existence historians have never\r\nknown, or which were supposed to be forever lost, have been brought to\r\nlight and printed by patriotic men and intelligent governments. These\r\nfragments supply many missing links in the chain of early events, and\r\nilluminate a multitude of otherwise obscure parts.\r\n\r\nMy efforts in gathering material have been continued, and since the\r\npublication of _The Native Races_ fifteen thousand volumes have been\r\nadded to my collection. Among these additions are bound volumes of\r\noriginal documents, copies from public and private archives, and about\r\neight hundred manuscript dictations by men who played their part in\r\ncreating the history. Most of those who thus gave me their testimony\r\nin person are now dead; and the narratives of their observations\r\nand experiences, as they stand recorded in these manuscript volumes,\r\nconstitute no unimportant element in the foundation upon which the\r\nstructure of this western history in its several parts must forever\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the experienced writer, who might otherwise regard the completion\r\nof so vast an undertaking within so apparently limited a period as\r\nindicative of work superficially done, I would say that this History was\r\nbegun in 1869, six years before the publication of _The Native Races_;\r\nand although the earlier volumes of the several divisions I was obliged\r\nfor the most part not only to plan and write, but to extract and arrange\r\nmy own material, later I was able to utilize the labors of others. Among\r\nthese as the most faithful and efficient I take pleasure in mentioning\r\nMr Henry L. Oak, Mr William Nemos, Mr Thomas Savage, Mrs Frances Fuller\r\nVictor, and Mr Ivan Petroff, of whom, and of others, I speak at length\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf my methods of working I need say but little here, since I describe\r\nthem more fully in another place. Their peculiarity, if they have\r\nany, consists in the employment of assistants, as before mentioned,\r\nto bring together by indices, references, and other devices, all\r\nexisting testimony on each topic to be treated. I thus obtain important\r\ninformation, which otherwise, with but one lifetime at my disposal,\r\nwould have been beyond control. Completeness of evidence by no means\r\ninsures a wise decision from an incompetent judge; yet the wise judge\r\ngladly avails himself of all attainable testimony. It has been my\r\npurpose to give in every instance due credit to sources of information,\r\nand cite freely such conclusions of other writers as differ from my\r\nown. I am more and more convinced of the wisdom and necessity of such\r\na course, by which, moreover, I aim to impart a certain bibliographic\r\nvalue to my work. The detail to be encompassed appeared absolutely\r\nunlimited, and more than once I despaired of ever completing my task.\r\nPreparatory investigation occupied tenfold more time than the writing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to express briefly my idea of what history should be,\r\nand to indicate the general line of thought that has guided me in this\r\ntask. From the mere chronicle of happenings, petty and momentous, to the\r\nhistorico-philosophical essay, illustrated with here and there a fact\r\nsupporting the writer's theories, the range is wide. Neither extreme\r\nmeets the requirements of history, however accurate the one or brilliant\r\nthe other. Not to a million minute photographs do we look for practical\r\ninformation respecting a mountain range, nor yet to an artistic painting\r\nof some one striking feature for a correct description. From the two\r\nextremes, equally to be avoided, the true historian will, whatever his\r\ninclination, be impelled by prudence, judgment, and duty from theory\r\ntoward fact, from vivid coloring toward photographic exactness. Not\r\nthat there is too much brilliancy in current history, but too little\r\nfact. An accurate record of events must form the foundation, and\r\nlargely the superstructure. Yet events pure and simple are by no means\r\nmore important than the institutionary development which they cause or\r\naccompany. Men, institutions, industries, must be studied equally. A\r\nman's character and influence no less than his actions demand attention.\r\nCause and effect are more essential than mere occurrence; achievements\r\nof peace should take precedence of warlike conquest; the condition of\r\nthe people is a more profitable and interesting subject of investigation\r\nthan the acts of governors, the valor of generals, or the doctrines of\r\npriests. The historian must classify, and digest, and teach as well as\r\nrecord; he should not, however, confound his conclusions with the facts\r\non which they rest. Symmetry of plan and execution as well as rigid\r\ncondensation, always desirable, become an absolute necessity in a work\r\nlike that which I have undertaken. In respect to time and territory\r\nmy field is immense. The matter to be presented is an intricate\r\ncomplication of annals, national and sectional, local and personal.\r\nThat my plan is in every respect the best possible, I do not say; but\r\nit is the best that my judgment suggests after long deliberation. The\r\nextent of this work is chargeable to the magnitude of the subject and\r\nthe immense mass of information gathered rather than to any tendency\r\nto verbosity. There is scarcely a page but has been twice or thrice\r\nrewritten with a view to condensation; and instead of faithfully\r\ndischarging this irksome duty, it would have been far easier and cheaper\r\nto have sent a hundred volumes through the press. The plan once formed,\r\nI sought to make the treatment exhaustive and symmetrical. Not all\r\nregions nor all periods are portrayed on the same scale: but though\r\nthe camera of investigation is set up before each successive topic at\r\nvarying distances, the picture, large or small, is finished with equal\r\ncare. I may add that I have attached more than ordinary importance to\r\nthe matter of mechanical arrangement, by which through title-pages,\r\nchapter-headings, and indices the reader may expeditiously refer to\r\nany desired topic, and find all that the work contains about any event,\r\nperiod, place, institution, man, or book; and above all I have aimed at\r\nexactness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe hear much of the philosophy of history, of the science and\r\nsignification of history; but there is only one way to write anything,\r\nwhich is to tell the truth, plainly and concisely. As for the writer,\r\nI will only say that while he should lay aside for the time his own\r\nreligion and patriotism, he should be always ready to recognize the\r\ninfluence and weigh the value of the religion and patriotism of others.\r\nThe exact historian will lend himself neither to idolatry nor to\r\ndetraction, and will positively decline to act either as the champion\r\nor assailant of any party or power. Friendships and enmities, loves\r\nand hates, he will throw into the crucible of evidence to be refined\r\nand cast into forms of unalloyed truth. He must be just and humble. To\r\nclear judgment he must add strict integrity and catholicity of opinion.\r\nEver in mind should be the occult forces that move mankind, and the\r\nlaws by which are formulated belief, conscience, and character. The\r\nactions of men are governed by proximate states of mind, and these are\r\ngenerated both from antecedent states of mind and antecedent states of\r\nbody, influenced by social and natural environment. The right of every\r\ngeneration should be determined, not by the ethics of any society, sect,\r\nor age, but by the broad, inexorable teachings of nature; nor should\r\nhe forget that standards of morality are a freak of fashion, and that\r\nfrom wrongs begotten of necessity in the womb of progress has been\r\nbrought forth right, and likewise right has engendered wrongs. He should\r\nremember that in the worst men there is much that is good, and in the\r\nbest much that is bad; that constructed upon the present skeleton of\r\nhuman nature a perfect man would be a monster; nor should he forget how\r\nmuch the world owes its bad men. But alas! who of us are wholly free\r\nfrom the effects of early training and later social atmospheres! Who of\r\nus has not in some degree faith, hope, and charity! Who of us does not\r\nhug some ancestral tradition, or rock some pet theory!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the relative importance of early history, here and elsewhere,\r\nit is premature for any now living to judge. Beside the bloody battles\r\nof antiquity, the sieges, crusades, and wild convulsions of unfolding\r\ncivilization, this transplanting of ours may seem tame. Yet the great\r\ngathering of the enlightened from all nations upon these shores, the\r\nsubjugation of the wilderness with its wild humanity, and the new\r\nempire-modelling that followed, may disclose as deep a significance in\r\nthe world's future as any display of army movements, or dainty morsels\r\nof court scandal, or the idiosyncrasies of monarchs and ministers. It\r\nneed not be recited to possessors of our latter-day liberties that\r\nthe people are the state, and rulers the servants. It is historical\r\nbarbarism, of which the Homeric poems and Carlovingian tales not\r\nalone are guilty, to throw the masses into the background, or wholly\r\nto ignore them. \"Heureux le peuple dont l'histoire ennuie,\" is an oft\r\nrepeated aphorism; as if deeds diabolical were the only actions worthy\r\nof record. But we of this new western development are not disposed to\r\nexalt brute battling overmuch; as for rulers and generals, we discover\r\nin them the creatures, not the creators, of civilization. We would\r\nrather see how nations originate, organize, and unfold; we would rather\r\nexamine the structure and operations of religions, society refinements\r\nand tyrannies, class affinities and antagonisms, wealth economies, the\r\nevolutions of arts and industries, intellectual and moral as well as\r\næsthetic culture, and all domestic phenomena with their homely joys and\r\ncares. For these last named, even down to dress, or the lack of it, are\r\nin part the man, and the man is the nation. With past history we may\r\nbecome tolerably familiar; but present developments are so strange,\r\ntheir anomalies are so startling to him who attempts to reduce them\r\nto form, that he is well content to leave for the moment the grosser\r\nextravagances of antiquity, howsoever much superior in interest they\r\nmay be to the average mind. Yet in the old and the new we may alike from\r\nthe abstract to the concrete note the genesis of history, and from the\r\nconcrete to the abstract regard the analysis of history. The historian\r\nshould be able to analyze and to generalize; yet his path leads not\r\nalone through the enticing fields of speculation, nor is it his only\r\nprovince to pluck the fruits and flowers of philosophy, or to blow brain\r\nbubbles and weave theorems. He must plod along the rough highways of\r\ntime and development, and out of many entanglements bring the vital\r\nfacts of history. And therein lies the richest reward. \"Shakspere's\r\ncapital discovery was this,\" says Edward Dowden, \"that the facts of\r\nthe world are worthy to command our highest ardour, our most resolute\r\naction, our most solemn awe; and that the more we penetrate into fact,\r\nthe more will our nature be quickened, enriched, and exalted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the success of this work should be proportionate to the labor\r\nbestowed upon it is scarcely to be expected; but I do believe that in\r\ndue time it will be generally recognized as a work worth doing, and\r\nlet me dare to hope fairly well done. If I read life's lesson aright,\r\ntruth alone is omnipotent and immortal. Therefore, of all I wrongfully\r\noffend I crave beforehand pardon; from those I rightfully offend I ask\r\nno mercy; their censure is dearer to me than would be their praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THIS VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n     SPAIN AND CIVILIZATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH\r\n     CENTURY.\r\n\r\n

Already\r\nAsia was prematurely old. Ships skirted Africa; but, save the\r\nnorthern seaboard, to all but heaven the continent was as dark as\r\nits stolid inhabitants. America was in swaddlings, knowing not its\r\nown existence, and known of none. Europe was an aged youth, bearing\r\nthe world-disturbing torch which still shed a dim, fitful light and\r\nmalignant odor.\r\n\r\nSocieties were held together by loyalty to civil and ecclesiastical\r\nrulers; not by that coöperation which springs from the common interests\r\nof the people. Unhallowed were all things real; divine the unsubstantial\r\nand potential. Beyond the stars were laid out spiritual cities,\r\nand under foot the hollow ground was dismal with the groans of the\r\ndeparted. Regions of the world outlying the known, were tenanted by\r\nsea-monsters, dragons, and hobgoblins. European commerce crept forth\r\nfrom walled towns and battlemented buildings, and peradventure, escaping\r\nthe dangers of the land, hugged the shore in open boats, resting by\r\nnight, and trembling amid-ships by day. Learning was chiefly confined\r\nto the clergy. Feudalism as a system was dead, but its evils remained.\r\nInnumerable burdens were heaped upon the people by the dominant classes\r\nwho gave them little protection in return. Upon the most frivolous\r\npretexts the fruits of their industry were seized and appropriated by\r\ntheir masters. It was a praiseworthy performance for a hundred thousand\r\nmen to meet and slay each other to gratify the whim of a state minister\r\nor a king's concubine. Then came a change, and by reason of their\r\nrevised Ptolemies, their antipodal soundings, and new geographies,\r\ntheir magnetic needles, printing machines, and men-killing implements,\r\nlearning began to revive, and the people began in some faint degree to\r\nthink for themselves.\r\n\r\nUnder the shifting sands of progress truth incubates, and the hatched\r\nideas fashion for themselves a great mind in which they may find\r\nlodgment; fashion for themselves a tongue by which to speak; fashion\r\nfor themselves a lever by which to move the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANSITIONAL EPOCH.]\r\n\r\nThe epoch of which I speak rested upon the confines of two\r\ncivilizations, the old and the new. It was a transition period from\r\nthe dim twilight of the dark age to the brightness of modern thought;\r\nfrom an age of unquestioning faith to one of curiosity and scepticism.\r\nIt was a period of concretions and crystallizations, following one\r\nof many rarefactions; religion was embracing science; astrology was\r\nmerging into astronomy; magic into physics; alchemy into chemistry.\r\nSaltpetre was superseding steel in warfare; feudalism having fulfilled\r\nits purpose was being displaced by monarchical power; intercourse was\r\nspringing up between nations, and international laws were being made.\r\nEven the material universe and the realms of space were enlarging with\r\nthe enlargement of mind. Two worlds were about that time unveiled to\r\nSpain, an oriental and an occidental; by the capture of Constantinople\r\nancient Greek and Latin learning was emancipated, and the Christian\r\nreligion became settled as the faith of Europe; while toward the west,\r\nthe mists of the ages lifted from the ocean, and, as if emerging from\r\nprimeval waters, a fair new continent ripe for a thousand industries\r\nstood revealed.\r\n\r\nThis was progress indeed, and the mind, bursting its mediæval fetters,\r\nstood forth and took a new survey. With the dawn of the sixteenth\r\ncentury there appeared a universal awakening throughout Christendom.\r\nSlumbering civilization, roused by the heavy tread of marching events,\r\nturned from royal prison-houses of learning, and beheld with wonder\r\nand delight the unfolding of these new mysteries. The dust and cobwebs\r\nof the past, which had so long dimmed the imagination, were disturbed\r\nby an aggressive spirit of inquiry. The report of exploding fallacies\r\nreverberated throughout Europe; and as the smoke cleared away, and\r\nlight broke in through the obscurity, there fell as it were scales\r\nfrom the eyes of the learned, and man gazed upon his fellow-man with\r\nnew and strange emotions. For centuries men's minds had been chained\r\nto the traditions of the past; thought had traveled as in a treadmill;\r\nphilosophy had advanced with the face turned backward; knight-errantry\r\nhad been the highest type of manhood, and Christianity, like its\r\nfounder, had been made to bear the sins of the many. While its friends\r\nclaimed for it all the virtues of mankind, its enemies charged it with\r\nall the vices. The first efforts of scholastics in their exposition of\r\nthese new appearances was to square the accumulative information of the\r\nday with the subtleties of the schools and the doctrines and dogmas\r\nof the past. The source of all knowledge and the foundation of all\r\nscience were claimed to be in the holy scriptures and in the tenets of\r\nthe church. Any conception, or invention, or discovery that might pass\r\nunscathed these two touchstones was denominated truth, though human\r\nreason could not grasp it. Likewise, any stray fact which by these\r\ntests failed satisfactorily to account for itself, was pronounced false,\r\nthough human reason declared it true.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that all darkness and nescience were swept\r\naway in a breath, or that knowledge fell suddenly on mankind like an\r\ninspiration; it was enough for some few to learn for the first time of\r\nsuch a thing as ignorance. Although the change was real and decisive,\r\nand the mind in its attempt to fathom new phenomena was effectually\r\nlured from the mystic pages of antiquity, there yet remained enough and\r\nto spare of ignorance and credulity. Searchers after the truth yet saw\r\nas through a glass darkly; the clearer vision of face to face could be\r\nattained only by slow degrees, and often the very attempt to scale the\r\nprison-house walls plunged the aspirant after higher culture yet deeper\r\ninto the ditch; but that there were any searchings at all was no small\r\nadvance. Shackles were stricken off, but the untutored intellect as\r\nyet knew not the use of liberty; a new light was flashed in upon the\r\nmental vision, but the sudden glare was for the moment bewildering,\r\nand not until centuries after was the significance of this transitional\r\nepoch fully manifest. It may be possible to exaggerate the importance\r\nof this awakening; yet how exaggerate the value to western Europe of\r\nGreek literature and the revival of classic learning, of the invention\r\nof printing, or the influence for good or evil on Spain of her New World\r\ndiscoveries?\r\n\r\nRightly to understand the condition of education in Spain in the\r\nfifteenth century, we must remember that mental training and not the\r\nacquisition of knowledge was the object of education, and as the object\r\nto be attained differed greatly from that which we are now seeking, so\r\nthe result was proportionately different. The tendency of education\r\nin the fifteenth century was toward a more determined reliance and\r\nbelief in authority and in revelation; the tendency of education in\r\nthe nineteenth century is toward inquiry and scepticism. As to the\r\ncomparative value of these results there are of course many differences\r\nof opinion, and I shall not discuss them here. We may be sure, however,\r\nthat in whatsoever direction human mind is trained by other human mind,\r\nthere is ever present and underlying all activities inexorable progress,\r\nan eternal unfolding into ever fairer proportions of all that is best\r\nand noblest in mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPANISH HISTORY.]\r\n\r\nOur history dates from Spain, at the time when Castile and Aragon\r\nwere the dominant power of Europe. Before entering upon the doings, or\r\npassing judgment upon the character, of those whose fortunes it is the\r\npurpose of this work to follow into the forests of the New World, let\r\nus glance at the origin of the Spaniards, examine the cradle of their\r\ncivilization, and see out of what conditions a people so unlike any on\r\nthe globe to-day were evolved.\r\n\r\nFar back as tradition and theory can reach, the Iberians, possibly\r\nof Turanian stock, followed their rude vocations, hunting, fishing,\r\nfighting; guarded on one side by the Pyrenees, and on the others by the\r\nsea. Next, in an epoch to whose date no approximation is now possible,\r\nthe Celts came down on Spain, the first wave of that Aryan sea destined\r\nto submerge all Europe. Under the Celtiberians, the fierce and powerful\r\ncompound race now formed by the union of Iberian and Celt, broken\r\nindeed into various tribes but with analogous customs and tongues, Spain\r\nfirst became known to the civilized world. Then came the commercial and\r\ncolonizing Phœnician and planted a settlement at Cádiz. After them the\r\nCarthaginians landed on the eastern shore of the Peninsula and founded\r\nCarthago Nova, now Cartagena. The power of the Carthaginians in Spain\r\nwas broken by the Scipios, in the second Punic war, toward the close of\r\nthe third century B. C.; and yet, says Ticknor, \"they have left in the\r\npopulation and language of Spain, traces which have never been wholly\r\nobliterated.\"\r\n\r\nThe Romans, after driving out the Carthaginians, attacked the interior\r\nCeltiberians, who fought them hard and long; but the latter being\r\nfinally subjugated, all Hispania, save perhaps the rugged north-west,\r\nwas divided into Roman provinces, and in them the language and\r\ninstitutions of Rome were established. Forced from their hereditary\r\nfeuds by the iron hand of their conquerors, the Celtiberians rapidly\r\nincreased in wealth and numbers, and of their prosperity the Empire\r\nwas not slow to make avail. From the fertile fields of Spain flowed\r\nvast quantities of _cerealia_ into the granary of Rome. The gold and\r\nsilver of their metal-veined sierras the enslaved Spaniards were forced\r\nto produce, as they in succeeding ages wrung from the natives of the\r\nNew World the same unjust service. The introduction of Christianity,\r\nabout the middle of the third century, brought upon the adherents of\r\nthis religion the most cruel persecutions; which, however, instead of\r\ndestroying it but rooted it the more firmly. Some say, indeed, that\r\nSaint Paul preached at Saragossa, and planted a church there; however\r\nthis may be, it was not until the conversion of Constantine that\r\nChristianity became the dominant religion of the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe fifth century opens with the dissolution of the empire of the\r\nRomans, for the barbarians are upon them. Over the Pyrenees, in awful\r\ndeluge, sweep Suevi, Alani, Vandals, and Silingi. The Suevi, in A.\r\nD. 409, take possession of the north-west, now Galicia; the Alani\r\nseize Lusitania, to-day Portugal; and the Vandals and Silingi settle\r\nVandalusia, or Andalusia, the latter tribe occupying Seville. Blighted\r\nby this barbaric whirlwind, civilization droops; the arts and sciences\r\nintroduced by the Romans fall into disgrace; the churlish conquerors\r\nwill have none of them; and the culture of ancient Greece and Rome,\r\nturning toward its original seat, flees the inhospitable west and takes\r\nrefuge in the capital of the eastern empire, which thereafter becomes\r\nthe depository of the wrecks of classic learning. In their dilemma the\r\nRomanized indigenes call to their help the less uncouth Visigoths. In\r\n427 the Vandals pass into Africa. Between 455 and 584 the Visigoths\r\nconquer the Romans and subjugate the Suevi; so that now their kingdom\r\nstretches from the bank of the Loire to Gibraltar. Thus to the Latin\r\nis added the Gothic element; the Latin language, corrupted as it had\r\nbecome, gains upon, or rather for the most part holds its original\r\nadvantage over the Gothic tongue, and becomes the basis of the modern\r\nCastilian, with such grammatical simplifications as the northern taste\r\nrenders necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVENT OF THE MOORS.]\r\n\r\nStill the great Peninsula seethes and bubbles like a caldron over the\r\nfurnace-fires of its progressional unrest. Two centuries of contentions\r\nbetween states, and between kings and nobles, aggravated by the usual\r\nconvulsions incident to elective monarchies, suffice to bring upon them\r\na new foe. The crescent of Islam, resting on Mecca and threatening at\r\nonce the Bosporus and the Pillars of Hercules, flames suddenly out at\r\nits western horn over fated Spain. At Algeciras, near Gibraltar, in\r\n711, in great force, the Mauritanian Arabs, or Moors, effect a landing,\r\ninvited thither by Count Julian, commander of Andalusia, in revenge\r\nfor the violation of his daughter by Rodrigo, last of the Gothic\r\nkings. Routing the Visigoths in the battle of Jerez de la Frontera, in\r\nfive swift years the Saracens are masters of all save the mountainous\r\nnorth-west; and penetrating Aquitania, the kingdom of the Franks is\r\nprevented from falling into their hands only by the decisive victory\r\nwon by Charles Martel at Tours in 732. An emirate under the caliphate of\r\nBagdad is established at Córdova, and multitudes of Syrian and Egyptian\r\nMahometans flock to Spain. Thus pressed, to the rugged mountains\r\nof Asturias, under Pelayo, one of their national heroes, flee such\r\nChristians as will not submit. There the wreck of the Visigothic kingdom\r\ntakes refuge; there stubborn patriots rally and nurse their nationality\r\nbetimes in the caves of the Pyrenees, waiting opportunity to deliver\r\ntheir country from the yoke of the hated Infidel. In 755 Abdurrahman,\r\nthe last caliph of the dynasty of Ommiades, having escaped the massacre\r\nof Damascus, wrests Spain from the hands of the Abbassides and founds\r\nthe caliphate of Córdova, which then formed one of the four great\r\ndivisions of the Prophet's dominions. Moorish kings now take the place\r\nof Moorish emirs, and thus is governed Córdova till 1238, and Granada\r\ntill 1492.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Mahometans ruled mildly and well. The native Christians\r\nliving among them kept their religion, churches, and clergy, as well as\r\ntheir laws and tribunals except in cases involving capital punishment,\r\nor where a Mahometan was a party in the suit. The usual consequences\r\nof race-contact followed; over wide tracts Arabic became the common\r\nlanguage, and so remained even after Moslem power had fallen. As late as\r\nthe fourteenth century public acts in many parts of Spain were written\r\nin Arabic. As the result of this intermixture, there was the linguistic\r\nmedley called _lingua franca_, a composite of Arabic, Gothic, Latin,\r\nHebrew, and Gallic, with the Romance, or corrupted Latin of Spain,\r\nunited with the Limousin, the language of the gay science spoken in\r\nLanguedoc and Provence, as a base. Out of this came the Castilian,\r\nwhich after undergoing various modifications settled into the Spanish\r\nlanguage, leaving it substantially in its present form, though refined\r\nand polished by subsequent centuries of civilization. It was not,\r\nhowever, until near the reign of Alfonso X., 1252-1282, long after\r\nthe Christians had emerged from the mountains and had mingled with the\r\nreconquered indigenes, that the Castilian became perfectly established\r\nas a written, settled, and polite language. Nor were the consequences\r\nof Arabic occupation confined to language; they tinged the whole life\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards who under Pelayo had taken refuge in the mountains of\r\nAsturias, in 716 founded a small government called the kingdom of\r\nOviedo. There the seeds of liberty, trampled by adversity, took root,\r\nand from the patriot soil arose a nation that spread its branches wide\r\nover the land. Gradually the Christian kingdoms enlarged. First Galicia,\r\nthen, two hundred years later, Leon and Castile were added to the little\r\nempire. The latter part of the tenth century the kingdoms of Leon,\r\nCastile, and Navarre, held the northern extremity of the Peninsula,\r\nwhile all the rest was under the dominion of the caliphate of Córdova.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EIGHT-CENTURY WAR.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, emerged from the mountain fastnesses whither they had fled\r\nbefore this southern swarm of turbaned Infidels, the sturdy Christians\r\npress heavily on their foe. Inch by inch, each step counting a century,\r\nthey fight their way from the Pyrenees back to Granada. Assuming the\r\ntitle of caliph, Abdurrahman III. defeats the Christians at Zamora on\r\nthe Douro, but is in turn repulsed, in 938, at Simancas. In vain the\r\nMahometans call to their aid the Almoravides of Morocco; their race\r\nupon the Peninsula is run. As portions of the country are wrested from\r\nthem, lands are awarded to notable Christian leaders, who at intervals\r\npause in their holy crusade, and fall to warring on each other; and by\r\nthese intestine brawls more Christian blood is spilt than by all the\r\ncimiters of the Saracens. At such times the Infidels might turn and make\r\nthe Christians an easy prey; but centuries of opulence, and, except\r\nalong their northern border, of inaction, have sapped their strength\r\nand left them nerveless. It is the old story alike of peoples, sects,\r\nand individuals; discipline, begotten by necessity, engenders strength,\r\nwhich fattened by luxury swells to weakness.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the eleventh century finds the Christians occupying\r\nabout half the Peninsula, that is to say the kingdoms of Leon, Castile,\r\nAragon, Navarre, and Portugal. Leon was but another name for the\r\nkingdom of Oviedo, or Asturias, the birthplace of Spanish nationality.\r\nCastile—Roman, _castella_; Arabic, _ardo-l-koláa_, land of castles,\r\nso called from the _castillos_, or forts, built there—though destined\r\neventually to absorb all the kingdoms of the Peninsula, was at first a\r\nrepublic, consisting of a few small towns or fortified castles, which\r\nhad united for mutual protection from both Mahometans and contentious\r\nChristian brethren. In 1037 Leon was united by Ferdinand I., called\r\nthe Great, to Castile; and from its central position, and the strength\r\narising from perpetual vigilance, the new kingdom gradually widened\r\nand added to its dominions, until eventually all the kingdoms of the\r\nPeninsula were united under the banner of Castile. Navarre belonged to\r\na French count, whose successor drove the Saracens from the territory\r\nadjacent on the south-west, and founded the kingdom of Aragon.\r\n\r\nIn 1085 the Cid, a Castilian chieftain, born at Búrgos, and famous in\r\npoetry, romance, and war, seized Toledo, and overran Valencia; in 1118\r\nAlfonso of Aragon wrested Saragossa from the Moors. Portugal, hitherto\r\na province of Castile, assumed the title of kingdom in 1139. Finally\r\nthe four kingdoms of the north, together with Portugal, formed a league\r\nagainst the Infidels, and in a great battle fought in the Sierra Morena,\r\nnear Tolosa, in 1212, Mahometan power in Spain was effectually broken.\r\nIn this decisive engagement the Christian confederates were commanded\r\nby Alfonso III. of Castile, who never rested till the followers of the\r\nProphet were driven from the central plateau. To the kingdom of Castile,\r\nFerdinand III., 1217-1252, annexed Jaen, Córdova, and Seville, which\r\nwith difficulty were held by his son Alfonso X., surnamed the Wise—a\r\nbetter scholar than soldier, as we see. Alfonso XI. was succeeded by\r\nPedro el Cruel, who died in 1369.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPAIN'S GRANDEUR.]\r\n\r\nA succession of singularly brilliant events, culminating in the empire\r\nof Charles V., brought Spain, at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, to the front rank among European powers. The marriage of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, which in 1479 united the crowns of Aragon and\r\nCastile; the conquest of Granada in 1492, terminating eight centuries\r\nof almost continuous warfare; the discovery of America the same year;\r\nthe annexation of Naples in 1503, and of Navarre in 1512, after the\r\nunion of Spain and the Netherlands in the marriage of Juana, daughter\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella, with Philip the Fair, son of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian I., and father of Charles V., all coming in quick succession,\r\nform a train of important incidents unparalleled in the history of\r\nnations. Before the death of Philip II. in 1598, the empire of Spain\r\nextended to every part of the globe—Portugal, conquered by the duke\r\nof Alva in 1580; Sicily and Sardinia, Artois and Franche Comté, the\r\nBalearic and Canary islands; in Africa—Melilla, Ceuta, Oran, and Tunis;\r\nin Asia—the Moluccas and the Philippine Islands, together with several\r\nsettlements elsewhere; beside a large part of the two Americas, which\r\nalone comprised about one fifth of the world.\r\n\r\nBut nations like men must die. The full measure of prosperity had been\r\nmeted out to Spain, and now she must lay it down—such is the inexorable\r\nlaw of progress. It was the very irony of autocracy, that one man\r\nshould rule half the world! Spain's pyramid of greatness, which assumed\r\nsuch lofty proportions during the reign of their Catholic Majesties,\r\nculminated during the reigns of their immediate successors. A long line\r\nof ambitious and able princes had raised the empire to a giddy height;\r\nbut with an illiterate and non-progressive populace, no sooner did\r\nthe rulers become incompetent than the nation fell in pieces. In the\r\nheight of his grandeur Spain's grandest monarch surfeited of success\r\nand abdicated; and with the death of his son Philip the glory of the\r\nempire departed. Then might her epitaph be written—Nine centuries of\r\nsteady growth—a long and lusty youth, more than falls to the lot of most\r\nnations—and in three brief centuries more she rose, and ripened, and\r\nrotted.\r\n\r\nIt is not with death, however, but life, we have to do. Intellectual\r\nsparks were lighting up the dark corners of the earth, and a series of\r\nbrilliant epochs began with the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella—modern\r\nGolden Ages they might be called. The golden age of Spain, dating from\r\n1474 to 1516, was followed by Germany's golden age, which was during\r\nthe reign of Charles V., 1519-1558. Then came England with the reign\r\nof Elizabeth, 1558-1603; then France under Louis XIV. and Louis XV.,\r\n1640-1740; Russia under Peter the Great, 1672-1725; and Prussia under\r\nFrederick the Great, 1740-1786. During this time European civilization\r\nwas bursting its narrow confines and encircling the hitherto unknown\r\nworld in every direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEASUREMENTS OF CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards we would know and judge. We shall judge them, even though\r\nwe know them not. We love to judge our fellows, and to think how much\r\nbetter are we than they. Little attention we give it, though it is a\r\nself-evident proposition, that to judge a people by any other standard\r\nthan that to which they have been taught to conform is to do them\r\ngreat injustice. If we may believe psychology, thought, in its higher\r\nphases, develops only with the development of language; the conceptions\r\nof the mind can not rise much higher than forms of speech will enable\r\nit to express. Apply this postulate to the measure of character,\r\nand the corollary is, that to interpret fairly, we must restrict our\r\nimagination to such ideas, our mind to such beliefs, and our tongue\r\nto such formulas as belong to those we judge. This, however, is no\r\neasy matter. In the present age of intellectual progress and changing\r\nactivity, when old delusions are being rapidly dispelled by science,\r\nand new discoveries are constantly opening new channels to distinction,\r\nit is almost impossible to place ourselves within the narrow limits of\r\nmediæval restrictions, in which thought and opinion were not allowed to\r\ngerminate, but were passed unchanged from one generation to another. \"It\r\noften happens,\" as John Stuart Mill remarks, \"that the universal belief\r\nof one age of mankind—a belief from which no one was, nor, without an\r\nextra effort of genius or courage, could at that time be, free—becomes\r\nso palpable an absurdity, that the only difficulty then is to imagine\r\nhow such a thing can ever have appeared credible.\" Not only were the\r\nChurch dogmas of the Middle Age accepted as truth, but at that time to\r\nhold opinions antagonistic to established creeds was seldom so much as\r\ndeemed possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing premises it clearly follows, that rightly to measure\r\nthe character of those who carried European civilization into the\r\nwilds of America, we must, in so far as we may, divest ourselves of the\r\npresent, and enter into the spirit of their times. We must fix in our\r\nminds the precise epoch in the history of human progress to which the\r\ndiscovery of this New World belongs. We must roll up four brilliant\r\ncenturies of the scroll of science, cloud nine tenths of the world\r\nin obscurity, throw a spell upon the ocean; then wall the imagination\r\nwithin the confines of this narrow horizon and conceive the effect. We\r\nmust know something, not alone of national polities and the attitude\r\nof kings, but we must enter the society of individuals, and study the\r\nimpulses of the people. We must call up the inscrutable past, surround\r\nourselves with those influences that give the stamp to character and the\r\ncolor to creed. We must familiarize ourselves with scenes familiar to\r\nthe people we discuss; we must walk their streets, look through their\r\neyes, think their thoughts; we must personate them and practically\r\nconstrue them. We should fill our breast with the aspirations that\r\nimpelled them, our imagination with the fears that restrained them,\r\nand feel those subtle forces which for generations had been developing\r\nintellect and moulding opinion. We should dare even to gain access to\r\ntheir domestic and religious _penetralia_, to invade the sanctity of the\r\nhearth and altar, to sound the hidden chords of domestic life, to walk\r\nsoftly through vaulted aisles and convent corridors, bending the ear\r\nto catch the whisperings of the confessional; we should enter with the\r\nmonk his cloister-cell, with the gallant the presence of his lady-love,\r\nand learn whence the significance and whither the tendency of their\r\nstrange conceits. If, at the outset, with the political position, we\r\nalso thus firmly grasp their inner social life, much that were otherwise\r\nenigmatical or suspicious appears in a clearer light; and we can then\r\nbehold their chivalrous but cruel deeds with the same charity in which\r\nwe hope posterity may shroud our own enormities. Thus only may we be led\r\nto understand the various processes by which this phase of civilization\r\nwas evolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe configuration and climate of the Peninsula assist in giving\r\nvariety to the character of its inhabitants. The interior is one vast\r\ntable-land, higher than any other plateau in Europe, being from two\r\nto three thousand feet above the level of the sea. On either side\r\nprecipitous mountain ranges interpose between the table-land and\r\nthe shores, and through these numerous streams thread their way. The\r\ntable-land is for the most part dry and treeless, hot in summer and cold\r\nin winter; Asturias is wet and wooded; the valleys of the Guadalquivir,\r\nDouro, Ebro, Tagus, and other rivers, are in places quite fertile.\r\nIn the southern provinces of Andalusia and Murcia, autumn and winter\r\nare mild and pleasant, and spring is surpassingly lovely; but the\r\n_solano_ which during summer blows from the heated plains of Africa is\r\nintolerable to any but the acclimated. From the snow-clad Pyrenees the\r\npiercing blasts of winter sweep over Leon, Castile, and Estremadura,\r\nat the north protracting the long winter and making cold and humid the\r\nspring, and arrive at the middle provinces stripped of their moisture,\r\nbut not of their raw unwelcome chilliness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the eleven convulsive centuries preceding our epoch we\r\nhave seen mix and agglutinate the several ingredients of Spanish\r\ncharacter—Iberian, Celt, Phœnician; Roman, Goth, and Moor, all\r\ncontributing their quota. Christian, Infidel, and Jew, with their loves\r\nand hates, season the mass; and thus society becomes an _olla podrida_,\r\nand Spain presents the anomalous race of the world.\r\n\r\nIn different provinces different race-elements preponderate, that of\r\nRome tincturing the whole more strongly than any other. Under analysis\r\nthese several social ingredients may be easily detected. By comparison\r\nwith Strabo, Arnold traces many of the social characteristics of the\r\nSpaniards back to the Iberians. \"The grave dress, the temperance and\r\nsobriety, the unyielding spirit, the extreme indolence, the perverseness\r\nin guerilla warfare, and the remarkable absence of the highest military\r\nqualities ascribed by the Greek and Roman writers,\" he affirms, \"are\r\nall more or less characteristic of the Spaniards of modern times. The\r\ncourtesy and gallantry of the Spaniard to women has also come down to\r\nhim from his Iberian ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nSo in the volatile, dark-haired Celt, where reckless courage and\r\nindifference to human life reached their height, where quick perception\r\nand ready wit supplied the place of sober thought and logical\r\ndeductions, where man was courageous and changeable, and woman was\r\nat once fickle, chaste, and passionate—in these fierce barbarians we\r\nsee a multitude of traits handed by them to their descendants. Of\r\nPhœnician and Iberian influence, traces are seen in their skill in\r\nscientific mining; of Gothic, in their comparatively liberal forms of\r\ngovernment, their attachment to military display, and in their good\r\nfaith, integrity, and morality—would these latter had been a trifle\r\nmore Gothic; of Roman, in their love of ecclesiastical forms, church and\r\nstate loyalty, in their stately dignity and sobriety of deportment; of\r\nArab, in their hatred of work, their love of freedom, their religious\r\nenthusiasm, their tactics in war, and in their language, poetry, art,\r\nand architecture. Some of these terms appear paradoxical, but human\r\nnature, in its ingredients, is ever paradoxical. In the Spanish language\r\nBrace discovers that the principal \"terms for agriculture and science\r\nare Latin; for the Church, Latin or Greek; for arms, riding, and war,\r\nTeutonic; and for arts and plants in southern Spain, Arabic.\" From the\r\nnorth and east and south the boldest of the nations had congregated on\r\nthis frontier peninsula, waiting the outburst which, after a thousand\r\nyears of fermentation, broke over its western slope.\r\n\r\nBuckle, in support of a theory referring the origin of character to\r\nphysical causes, ascribes the superstition of Spain to famine and\r\ndisease, to earthquakes and the awe-producing phenomena of wild scenery;\r\ntheir fickleness he attributes to climate, the heat and dryness in\r\nSpain interrupting labor and leading to desultory habits; their love\r\nof romance and adventure he traces to pastoral life, which prevailed to\r\nthe neglect of agriculture during the Moorish invasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVOLUTION OF THE SPANISH NATION.]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Granada left the Peninsula occupied essentially as follows:\r\nIn the north and west were the descendants of Goths and Celts who,\r\nunmolested by Roman or Moor, retained in a measure their ancestral\r\ncharacteristics. Low of stature, thick-set and awkward, as strong and\r\nas hairy almost as bears, the men of Asturias and Galicia, of Leon\r\nand Biscay, century after century come and go, living as their fathers\r\nlived, neither better nor worse, caring nothing for Arab or Dutchman,\r\nand little even for the Spanish kings; proud as ever of Pelayo, of the\r\nmountains that cradled Spanish liberty, of their great antiquity, which\r\nthey boast as greater than that of any living nation; superstitious,\r\nirritable, and impetuous, but honest, frank, and sincere; implacable as\r\nenemies, but faithful as friends. Their boast is that never have they\r\nbeen subdued by Moor. Their chiefs were of the ancient Gothic blood,\r\nblue blood they called it, not being tainted with Arabic like that of\r\ntheir darker southern neighbors; of such material were early founded\r\nthe kingdoms of Leon and Castile.\r\n\r\nOn their eastern side was the kingdom of Navarre, founded by the counts\r\nof the French marches. Though at one time these two sections had been\r\nunited, the usual partition of heritage had soon dismembered them.\r\nPortugal, an offshoot of Castile, was permanently separated; Aragon,\r\nfounded by Navarre, became also independent. Upon the eastern seaboard\r\nthe people of Catalonia and Valencia, though diluted with the Limousin\r\nelement, yet retain traces of their foreign relationships. \"Of the\r\nmodern evidences of race in the different provinces,\" says Brace,\r\n\"travellers tell us that in Valencia the people resemble both their\r\nKeltiberian and Carthaginian ancestors, being cunning, perfidious,\r\nvindictive, and sullen. The burning sun has tanned their skin dark\r\nand aided to form in them an excitable and nervous temperament; they\r\nhave, too, the superstitious tendencies that characterize the people\r\nof a hot climate. The Valencian women are fairer than the men, and\r\nare conspicuous for their beauty of form. They wear the hair and the\r\nornaments of the head after the old Romish style. The Catalan is rude,\r\nactive and industrious, a good soldier, and fond of his independence,\r\nresembling both Kelts and Iberians in his covetous, bold, cruel, and\r\nwarlike character. The Aragonese are two children of the Goths in their\r\nforce of will, their attachment to constitutional liberties, and their\r\nopposition to arbitrary power.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall, tough, agile eastern mountaineer presents as marked a contrast\r\nto the stubby Asturian as does the sparkling Andalusian to the grave\r\nCastilian. For a long time the people of Andalusia were semi-Moorish\r\nin their character. There, where the soft air of Africa comes fresh\r\nfrom the Mediterranean, had dwelt the dusky, graceful Arab; worshipping\r\nMahomet as the Castilian worshipped Christ, and regarding his Christian\r\nand Jewish neighbors with as little affection as either Jew or Christian\r\nregarded him. Scattered along the banks of the Guadalquivir, and in\r\nseparate quarters of many towns of southern Spain, were bands of that\r\nanomalous race, the gypsies. Short, dark, ugly, with long, coarse, wavy\r\nhair, mixing with other men as light and darkness mix, they plied their\r\ntrade of buying, stealing, and selling. During the latter part of the\r\nwar they occupied themselves in bringing horses from Africa and selling\r\nthem to Moors or Christians.\r\n\r\nIn the mountain fastnesses of Toledo there yet lived a remnant of\r\nSilingi stock, known as _almogávares_, who had never bent knee to\r\nInfidel; who, throughout the long contest which waged on every side of\r\nthem, had kept green their liberty and their faith—a Christian oasis in\r\nthe broad pagan desert. There, too, a broken band of the chosen Israel,\r\nnow fairly launched upon their eternal wanderings, found a momentary\r\nresting-place. Before the arrival of the Visigoths, it is said, a\r\ncolony of Hebrews planted themselves near Toledo, and by their industry\r\nand superior financial ability, became at length the royal bankers,\r\nand notwithstanding bitter prejudices, they rose high in influence,\r\neven to the honor of having their daughters enrolled among the king's\r\nmistresses.\r\n\r\nThus for a time the several parts of the Peninsula differ widely\r\nin language, manners, and institutions; but at length, by wars and\r\npolitical combinations, race-barriers are broken down, and opposing\r\nclanships welded by an intenser hatred for some common enemy. The south\r\nthrough its Mediterranean trade soonest attains eminence, but warlike\r\nCastile subsequently acquires predominance. Meanwhile the masses\r\nretain their old ways better than their leaders. The nobility, and\r\nfrequenters of courts, mingling more with the world, adopt the fashions\r\nof courts, and change with their changes. The inhabitants of the\r\nborder provinces feel the influences of the war comparatively little;\r\nupon the great central plateau, however, there meet and mix almost\r\nall the stocks and creeds of the then known world. Aryan and Semite;\r\nRoman, Goth, and Mauritanian; Mahometan, Christian, and Jew; planting\r\nand plucking, building up and tearing down, fattening and starving,\r\nfighting and worshipping and burning—the whole table-land of Spain\r\nturned into a battle-arena of the nations, into a world's gladiatorial\r\nshow; its occupants alternately marrying and battling, Moslem with\r\nChristian, Moslem with Moslem, Christian with Christian, Christian\r\nand Moslem uniting now against Christian and now against Moslem, while\r\nthe slaughter of Jew, heretic, and gypsy fills the interlude. So pass\r\ncenturies; and from this alembic of nations is distilled the tall,\r\nsymmetrical, black-haired, bright-eyed, sharp-featured Castilian and\r\nEstremaduran.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESULTS OF INTERMIXTURES.]\r\n\r\nOut of this heterogeneous medley of opposing qualities we have now to\r\ndraw general characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn demeanor the Spaniard is grave, punctilious, reserved with strangers,\r\njealous of familiarity or encroachment on his dignity; but among\r\nhis acquaintances, or with those who are ready to recognize what\r\nhe conceives to be his due, he throws off restraint, and becomes an\r\nagreeable companion and a firm friend. While impatient and resentful of\r\nfancied slights, he is easily won by kindness, and is always dazzled by\r\nskill in arms and personal valor.\r\n\r\nIn disposition he is serious almost to melancholy, firm to stubbornness,\r\nimperturbable, lethargic, inert, moody; yet when roused there breaks\r\nforth the deepest enthusiasm and the most ungovernable passion. So\r\npunctilious is his sense of honor, so zealous and truthful is he\r\nin his friendships, so affectionate and humane in all his private\r\nrelations, that at one time the term Spanish gentleman was synonymous\r\nwith everything just, generous, and high-minded throughout Europe. In\r\nintellect he is contemplative rather than profound, apt in emergencies,\r\nbut lacking breadth and depth. In habits he is temperate and frugal,\r\neasily satisfied, indolent. To live without work is his ideal of\r\nenjoyment. Dissoluteness and intemperance can not be ranked among his\r\nvices, nor do travellers place hospitality in his list of virtues. There\r\nis no such word as rowdy in his vocabulary. Turbulent from imposition he\r\nmay be, and after injury vengeful; but brawler, disturber of peace and\r\nsocial order, he is not. Though taciturn, he is deep in feeling; in his\r\nlove of country he is provincial rather than national. Though hard to\r\nbe driven he is easily led; acting collectively, officially, he is given\r\nto venality, when personally thrown upon his honor he is scrupulous and\r\ntrusty.\r\n\r\nIn manners the Spaniard is proverbial for high breeding, courtesy,\r\nand decorum. Whether beggar or courtier, his politeness seldom deserts\r\nhim. \"Dios guarde á usted,\" May God protect you; \"Vaya usted con Dios,\r\ncaballero,\" God be with you, sir; are the usual valedictions. In reply\r\nto the importunities of a beggar the cavalier exclaims, \"Perdone usted,\r\npor Dios, hermano,\" For the love of God excuse me, my brother. To the\r\nhighest noble and to the meanest peasant the greeting is the same.\r\nSedate, sober-minded, reserved, the Spaniard is but the modified result\r\nof his several exemplars. \"All Spaniards,\" remarks Ford, \"are prodigal\r\nto each other in cheap names and titles of honor; thus even beggars\r\naddress each other as _señor y caballero_, lord and knight. The most\r\ncoveted style is _excelencia_, your excellency.\" Nicknames are common.\r\nNo one rises to distinction without carrying with him one or more\r\nappellations significant of the skill or occupation of his early days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASTILIAN PRIDE AND POLITENESS.]\r\n\r\nThe Castilian has less ingenuity in mechanics, less skill in trade,\r\nless taste, less delicacy of perception, than the Italian, but far more\r\npride, firmness, and courage; a more solemn demeanor, and a stronger\r\nsense of honor.\r\n\r\nEvery Spaniard of whatever class considers himself a _caballero_, a\r\nwell-born and Christian gentleman, the superior of most, the equal of\r\nany, the inferior of none. Profuse in proffers of kindness, he is no\r\nless slow to fulfil them than to accept favors from others. He is very\r\nvain; vain of personal appearance, vain of his ancestry, his breeding;\r\nvain of his ignorance and superstition; proud of many things he should\r\nbe ashamed of, and ashamed of nothing. Thieving was never prominent as a\r\nnational vice. As a rule Spaniards are too proud to steal; the impulse\r\nof wounded affection or injured pride nerves the arm that strikes,\r\noftener than the desire for plunder.\r\n\r\nThe old German cosmographer Sebastian Munster quaintly writes, Basel,\r\n1553: \"The Spaniards have good heads, but with all their studying they\r\nlearn but little, for after having half learned a thing they think\r\nthemselves very wise, and in their talk try to show much learning\r\nwhich they do not possess.\" Comparing them with the French, the same\r\nchronicler says: \"The Frenchmen are taller, but the Spaniards more\r\nhardy. In war, the Spaniards are deliberate, and the French, impetuous.\r\nThe French are great babblers, but the Spaniards can well keep a secret.\r\nThe French are joyous and light of thought; they like to live well; but\r\nthe Spaniards are melancholy, serious, and not given to carousing. The\r\nFrench receive their guests friendlily and treat them well, but the\r\nSpaniards are cross to strangers, so that one must go from house to\r\nhouse in search of entertainment. The cause of this is that Spaniards\r\nhave travelled little, and do not like to spend their money for food.\"\r\n\r\nIn Castile, more than elsewhere, was seen the perfect central type,\r\nwhich in its earlier stages was so remarkable for practical sagacity,\r\nfor an insight into causes and motives, and skill in the adaptation of\r\nmeans to ends. In the wars of the New World, affirms Macaulay, \"where\r\nsomething different from ordinary strategy was required in the general,\r\nand something different from ordinary discipline of the soldier, where\r\nit was every day necessary to meet by some new expedient the varying\r\ntactics of a barbarous enemy, the Spanish adventurers, sprung from\r\nthe common people, displayed a fertility of resource, and a talent for\r\nnegotiation and command, to which history scarcely affords a parallel.\"\r\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that the New World adventurer was\r\nnot always a national type.\r\n\r\nGraham declares that \"the history of the expeditions which terminated\r\nin the conquest of Mexico and Peru displays, perhaps, more strikingly\r\nthan any other portion of the records of the human race, what amazing\r\nexertions the spirit of man can prompt him to attempt, and sustain\r\nhim to endure.\" And again—\"The masses,\" says Ford, who has studied\r\nthem well, \"the least spoilt and the most national, stand like pillars\r\namid ruins, and on them the edifice of Spain's greatness must be\r\nreconstructed.\" \"All the force of Europe,\" exclaims Peterborough, \"would\r\nnot be sufficient to subdue the Castiles with the people against it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REVERENCE FOR ANTIQUITY.]\r\n\r\nSo great is their reverence for antiquity, that they appear to live\r\nalmost as much in the past as in the present. Age is synonymous with\r\nwisdom; the older the habit or opinion, the more worthy of belief it is.\r\nInnovation they abhor as dangerous; the universe of knowledge stands\r\nalready revealed; there is nothing more to learn. Their premises they\r\nknow to be sound, their conclusions correct, their beliefs true; what\r\nnecessity then for further troubling themselves? Children in everything\r\nbut teachableness, with themselves and their traditions they are\r\ncontent. Their education is finished. This is the most hopeless form of\r\nignorance. Their legends they carefully preserve, old-time customs they\r\nlove to practise, and they dwell with devoted enthusiasm on the exploits\r\nof their ancestors. To this day, twelve centuries after the occurrence,\r\nthe peasantry of Asturias are divided between the descendants of those\r\nwho aided the patriot Pelayo against the Moors, and those who did\r\nnot—the latter being stigmatized as _vaqueros_; while the Andalusian\r\nMorisco keeps alive the story of Granada's grandeur, and dreams of\r\nMoslem warriors, of Abencerrage knights, and the restoration of former\r\ngreatness. So strong is the influence of tradition and dead ancestry.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the quality of firmness, and tenacity of purpose, says\r\nBell, \"So obstinate is the Spaniard, and in some provinces so remarkably\r\nself-willed, that the inhabitants of one part of Spain make a jest of\r\nthe others on that account. Thus the obstinate Biscayan is represented\r\nas driving a nail into the wall with his head, whilst the still more\r\nobstinate Aragonian is figured in the same act and attitude, but with\r\nthe point of the nail turned outward!\" With the poniard at his throat,\r\nmany a prostrate foe will die rather than yield, and as surely will the\r\nvictor plunge in the fatal weapon if the cry for quarter be not quickly\r\nuttered. In Andalusia there was a fashion prevalent among duellists,\r\nwhen determined to fight their quarrel to the end, of firmly binding\r\ntogether, below the elbows, the left arms of the combatants; then, with\r\nknives in their right hands, they fought until one or both were dead.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their excessive loyalty to their rulers, their love of\r\nantiquity and hatred of change; and notwithstanding the oppression of\r\ntheir princes, the condition of the lower classes in Spain at the close\r\nof the fifteenth century was far above that of the same class in any\r\nother European country. This was owing, not to any special consideration\r\non the part of their political or ecclesiastical rulers, but to that\r\ngreatest of scourges, war.\r\n\r\nWhile the rulers were absorbed in conquering, and in keeping themselves\r\nfrom being conquered, except within the immediate battle-arena the\r\npeople were left much alone. Besides, armies must have supplies, and\r\nproducers were held in esteem by the military consumers.\r\n\r\nInequalities of power and wealth, unless arrested by extrinsic causes,\r\never tend to wider extremes. In Spain, the increase of wealth in\r\nthe hands of priests and princes was checked by long-continued war.\r\nThe products of the country must be used to feed the soldiery, and\r\nthe power of the nobility must be employed against the common enemy.\r\nThere was neither the time nor the opportunity to grind the people to\r\nthe uttermost. Though the war bore heavily upon the working classes,\r\nit proved to them the greatest blessing; while the masses elsewhere\r\nthroughout Europe were kept in a state of feudalistic serfdom, the\r\nnecessity of Spain being for men rather than for beasts, elevation\r\nfollowed. Further than this, race-contact, and the friction attending\r\nthe interminglings of courts and camps, tended in some degree towards\r\npolishing and refining society. \"Since nothing makes us forget the\r\narbitrary distinctions of rank,\" says Hallam, \"so much as participation\r\nin any common calamity, every man who had escaped the great shipwreck\r\nof liberty and religion in the mountains of Asturias was invested with\r\na personal dignity, which gave him value in his own eyes and those of\r\nhis country. It is probably this sentiment transmitted to posterity, and\r\ngradually fixing the national character, that had produced the elevation\r\nof manner remarked by travellers in the Castilian peasant.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASTE AND SOCIAL STRATA.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet there were caste and social stratification enough. The stubborn\r\nmanliness of the lower orders did not make them noble. Royalty alone was\r\ndivine. The nobles loved money, yet for them to traffic was disgraceful.\r\nThe ecclesiastic, whose calling placed him on a plane distinct from\r\nthese, aside from his religious teachings, stood out as the earnest\r\nadvocate of honest labor. Work was well enough for Moor, and Jew, and\r\nIndian; but he whose line of fighting ancestors had not beginning within\r\nthe memory of man, must starve rather than stain his lineage by doing\r\nsomething useful.\r\n\r\nThe several social strata, moreover, were jealously kept distinct.\r\nThe first distinction was that which separated them from foreigners.\r\nIn the days of Cæsar and Cicero, Rome was master of the world; Rome\r\nwas the world; were any not of Rome they were barbarians. So it was\r\nwith Spaniards. To be of Castile was to be the most highly favored of\r\nmortals; to be a Spaniard, though not a Castilian, was something to be\r\nproud of; to be anything else was most unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe next distinction was between the Spaniard of pure blood and the\r\nChristianized native of foreign origin. In the eyes of the Castilian\r\nbaptism could not wholly cleanse a Moor or Jew. Moriscos the Church\r\nmight make; heretics the Inquisition might reconstruct; but all Spain\r\ncould not make from foreign material a Christian Spaniard of the pure\r\nancient blood. About foreign fashions, foreign inventions, foreign\r\nprogress, foreign criticism, they cared nothing. And probably nowhere\r\nin modern times was this irrational idea of caste carried to such an\r\nabsurd extent as in the New World. Children of Spanish parentage, born\r\nin America, were regarded socially as inferior to children of the same\r\nparents who happened to be born in Spain. To be born a Spanish peasant\r\nwas better than _hidalgo_, or cavalier, with American nativity; for at\r\none time the former, on migrating to America, was entitled by virtue\r\nof that fact to the prefix 'Don.' Under the viceroys native Mexicans,\r\nthough of pure Castilian ancestry, were too often excluded from the\r\nhigher offices of Church and State; and this notwithstanding that both\r\ncanonical and civil law, if we may believe Betancur y Figueroa, provided\r\nthat natives should be preferred in all ecclesiastical appointments\r\nfrom the lightest benefice to the highest prelacy. \"But notwithstanding\r\nsuch repeated recommendations,\" says Robertson, \"preferment in almost\r\nevery different line is conferred on native Spaniards.\" Mr Ward,\r\nEnglish consul at Mexico in 1825-7, affirms that \"the son, who had the\r\nmisfortune to be born of a creole mother, was considered as an inferior,\r\nin the house of his own father, to the European book-keeper or clerk,\r\nfor whom the daughter, if there were one, and a large share of the\r\nfortune were reserved. 'Eres criollo y basta;' You are a creole and\r\nthat is enough, was a common phrase amongst the Spaniards when angry\r\nwith their children.\" Truly it was a good thing in those days to be at\r\nonce 'of Christ' and 'of Spain.' It was positively believed by some that\r\nblood flowed in accordance with the majesty of law, and that the quality\r\nof one was inferior to the quality of another. The blood of the Indian\r\nwas held as scarcely more human than the blood of beasts, and was often\r\nshed as freely.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there was a distinction between the profession of arms and\r\nall other professions. Following republican Rome again, the education of\r\nno man aspiring to a public career was complete until he had served as\r\na soldier. No one can truthfully charge the Spaniards of the sixteenth\r\ncentury with lack of courage. Military skill was the highest type of\r\nmanhood. Of danger they made a plaything, not only in their wars but in\r\ntheir sports. Life was dull unless brightened by blood.\r\n\r\nIn Aragon the barons were limited to a few great families who traced\r\ntheir descent from twelve peers, called _ricos homes de natura_.\r\nAlthough obliged to attend the king in his wars, in every other respect\r\nthey were independent. They were themselves exempt from taxation and\r\npunishment, and held absolute authority over the lives and property\r\nof their vassals. The next lower order of nobility in Aragon was\r\ncalled _infanzones_, corresponding to the hidalgos of Castile. The\r\n_caballeros_, or knights, were the immediate followers of the _ricos\r\nhomes_, and were possessed of important privileges.\r\n\r\nIn La Mancha the peasantry were of a quality different from those\r\nsent by Castile and Estremadura to the New World. Quintana writes of\r\nthem, \"He who travels through La Mancha will see the scaffold before\r\nhe sees the town. They are lazy, dirty, quarrelsome, and never suffer\r\nfrom hunger, for when they wish to become the owners of anything they\r\ntake it;\" and remarks another, \"They live on parched _garbanzos_, and\r\npass the winter lying on their bellies like reptiles in the sun.\" See\r\nMurillo's matchless pictures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JEWS AND MOORS.]\r\n\r\nAnother class and race, broken fragments of which we have before\r\nencountered, secured more rest in Spain than elsewhere, yet from a\r\ndifferent cause. Homeless Israel in the Arab found a friend. Not that\r\nthe Mahometans loved the Jews, but because the Christians hated them,\r\nwas their condition made so tolerable in Spain under Saracen rule.\r\nThen, and until their expulsion, they occupied an important position,\r\nbeing the chief money-handlers, merchants, and bankers. Overcome in\r\ntheir dislike for each other by a more bitter hatred against their\r\ncommon enemy, the Jews and Moors lived upon terms somewhat approaching\r\nequality. The Jews surpassed their Moorish masters in wealth, and were\r\nbut little inferior to them in arts and letters. They were not only\r\nusurers, but husbandmen, artisans, and doctors. As Christian domination\r\nextended southward, this comparatively happy state of the Spanish Jews\r\ndisappeared. Under pretext of justice, their moneys were wrested from\r\nthem by the nobles; indeed, if too stubborn they were not unfrequently\r\nput to death; and with the capitulation of Granada and the loss of\r\ntheir Moorish allies, the condition of the Jews became pitiable in the\r\nextreme. Two incidents of the crowning of Pope John XXIII., in 1410,\r\nas related by Monstrelet, give us a tolerably fair idea of the feelings\r\nentertained toward the Jews. In his progress through Rome, these people\r\npresented him with a manuscript copy of the old Testament. He, \"having\r\nexamined it a little, threw it behind him, saying, 'Your religion is\r\ngood, but this of ours is better.'\" And again, \"There were before and\r\nbehind him two hundred men-at-arms, each having in his hand a leathern\r\nmallet, with which they struck the Jews in such wise as it was a\r\npleasure to see.\"\r\n\r\nWith such an example the condition of the Jews grew more serious. As\r\nfor the Spaniards, they bettered the instruction, as was sufficiently\r\nproved by their expulsion-edict of March, 1492—an edict forbidding\r\nunbaptized Jews to be found within the limits of Spain at the end of\r\nfour months; an edict allowing them in that time to sell their property,\r\nbut forbidding them at the end of that time \"to carry away with them\r\nany gold, silver, or money whatsoever;\" \"an edict,\" says the Catholic\r\nhistorian, Lafuente, \"that condemned to expatriation, to misery, to\r\ndespair, and to death, many thousands of families born and bred in\r\nSpain.\"\r\n\r\nIn almost every mediæval town there was a Jewish district, in which,\r\nsays M. Depping, their historian, \"Jews like troops of lepers were\r\nthrust away and huddled together into the most uncomfortable and most\r\nunhealthy quarters of the city, as miserable as it was disgusting;\"\r\nor, as Paul Lacroix describes it, \"a large enclosure of wretched\r\nhouses, irregularly built, divided by small streets with no attempt at\r\nuniformity. The principal thoroughfare is lined with stalls, in which\r\nare sold not only old clothes, furniture, and utensils, but also new\r\nand glittering articles.\" Within their prescribed limits, all their\r\nnecessities were supplied, and a dirt-begrimed prison-like synagogue\r\nusually occupied the center. But even in these wretched places they were\r\noften subjected to cruelties the most severe and sickening. Terrible as\r\nwere the indignities heaped upon this unfortunate people it must not be\r\nsupposed that they were wholly unprovoked, or that all the forbearance\r\nwas on the part of the sufferers. Opinions on these questions are\r\nwidely divergent, and I refer to them here only to show more clearly\r\nthe condition of Europe at the time of which I write.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHARGE OF CRUELTY.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards of the sixteenth century have been called a cruel people;\r\nand so they were. Yet they were no more cruel than other nations of\r\ntheir day, and no more cruel relatively, according to the progress\r\nof humanity, than are we to-day. Time evolves in many respects a more\r\nrefined civilization, but the nature of man changes not. Individuals\r\nmay be less beastly; society may be regulated more by law and less by\r\npassion; between nations in their wars and diplomacy there may be less\r\nsystematic torture, less unblushing chicanery; but the world has yet to\r\nfind a weightier right than might. I fail to discover in America, by\r\nCatholic Spaniards or heathen savages, deeds more atrocious than some\r\ncommitted in India and China within the century by Protestant England,\r\nthe world's model of piety and propriety; and yet the treatment of\r\nIndians in North America by the people of Great Britain has been far\r\nmore just and humane than their treatment by the people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBefore such a charge as that of excessive cruelty can be made good\r\nagainst a people, there are several things to be considered. And\r\nfirst the motive. The surgeon who amputates a limb to save a life is\r\nnot called cruel. Now the Spaniards were the spiritual surgeons of\r\ntheir day. Nine tenths of all their cruelties were committed under\r\nthe conviction that what they did was in the line of duty, and that\r\nto refrain from so doing would have been no kindness. Though with the\r\nexperience of the past and by the clearer light of the nineteenth\r\ncentury we conclude that these convictions were false, and though\r\nwe contemplate them with horror and condemn the acts which resulted\r\nfrom them as barbarous, yet it is almost superfluous to say that with\r\ntheir teachings and surroundings we should have been the same. The\r\ninherent qualities of human nature seem to be changed but little if at\r\nall by the cultivation and development of mind. Secondly, the quality\r\nof cruelty is not pronounced, but relative. There are cruelties of\r\nthe heart, of the sensibilities, no less cruel than bodily tortures.\r\nThe age of savagism is always cruel. Cruelty springs from ignorance\r\nrather than from instinct. Childlike and thoughtless things, things\r\ntender by instinct, are cruel from disingenuous perversity. A clouded,\r\nunreasoning, unreasonable mind, even when hiding beneath it a tender\r\nheart, begets cruelty; while a sterner disposition, if accompanied by\r\na clear, truth-loving intellect, delights in no injustice—and cruelty\r\nis always unjust. This is why, if it be true as has been charged, that\r\nnotwithstanding boys are more cruel than girls, women are more cruel\r\nthan men. Children, women, and savages are cruel from thoughtlessness;\r\nthough the cruel boy may be very tender of his puppy, the cruel woman\r\nof her child, the cruel savage of his horse. Even the moralities and\r\nintellectual refinements of that day were not free from what would seem\r\nto us studied and unnecessary cruelty. I will cite a few instances of\r\nEuropean cruelty, not confined to Spaniards, which will show not only\r\nthat Spain was not more cruel than other nations, but that the savages\r\nof America were not more cruel than the Europeans of their day. Both\r\ntortured to the uttermost where they hated, even as men do now; the\r\nchief difference was, the Europeans, being the stronger, could torture\r\nthe harder. Civilization changes, not the quantity of cruelty, but the\r\nquality only.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BARBARISMS OF EUROPE.]\r\n\r\n\"Cæsar Borgia,\" writes Sebastiano de Branca in his diary, about the\r\nyear 1500, \"Cæsar Borgia was the cruelest man of any age.\" To serve\r\nhis purposes he did not hesitate to use poison and perjury. He was\r\ntreacherous, incestuous, murderous, even keeping a private executioner,\r\nMichilotto, to do his bidding. Louis XI. of France, and other princes,\r\nkept a court assassin. The fifteenth century was lurid with atrocities.\r\nRodrigo Lenzuoli, the father, Lucretia, the daughter, and Cæsar,\r\nthe son, comprised the Borgia trio, distinguished no less for their\r\nintellect, beauty, wealth, and bravery, than for their craft, lust,\r\ntreachery, and cruelty. Says Lecky: \"Philip II. and Isabella the\r\nCatholic inflicted more suffering in obedience to their consciences than\r\nNero or Domitian in obedience to their lusts.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1415 John Huss was burned for his religion, and in 1431 Joan of Arc\r\nfor her patriotism. In like manner perished thousands of others. Mahomet\r\nII., disputing with the Venetian artist Gentile Bellini as to the\r\nlength of John the Baptist's neck after decollation, called a slave, and\r\nstriking off his head with one blow of his cimeter, exclaimed: \"There!\r\ndid not I say yours is too long?\"\r\n\r\nPrinces made bloodshed a pastime. Edward IV. put to death a tradesman\r\nfor perpetrating a pun; caused a gentleman to be executed for speaking\r\nagainst a favorite; and condemned his own brother to death in a fit of\r\npetulance. In an interview between this same Edward of England and the\r\nking of France, the monarchs were brought together in huge iron cages,\r\neach distrustful of the other. Louis XII. confined Ludovico Sforza, duke\r\nof Milan, in an iron cage for ten years, and until his death. This was\r\na punishment common at that time in Italy and Spain. Pedro el Cruel is\r\ncharged by Hallam with having murdered his wife and mother, most of his\r\nbrothers and sisters, many of the Castilian nobility, and multitudes of\r\nthe commonalty.\r\n\r\nThe church tolerated the persecution of its enemies, believing it was\r\nfor the glory of God. Nor was this idea confined to Spain or to the\r\nfifteenth century, for we find in England and even in America that\r\npersecutions for conscience' sake, with all the cruelties that refined\r\ncivilization could devise existed at the opening of the present century;\r\nnor indeed is the world yet completely emancipated from this thraldom.\r\n\r\nYet the Spaniards, I say, were bad enough. The cruelties following the\r\ncapitulation of Málaga, in 1487, were more befitting fiends than a man\r\nand woman who prided themselves in the title of Catholic king and queen.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the Inquisition, religious persecutions\r\nhad become but too gratifying to the national taste. On this occasion\r\nat Málaga, the apostate Moors were first caught and burned. Twelve\r\napostate Christians were then fastened to stakes in an open place and\r\nmade the barbarous sport of Spanish cavaliers, who, mounted on fleet\r\nhorses, hurled at their naked bodies pointed reeds while rushing past\r\nat full speed. This was continued until the torn and bleeding flesh\r\nof their victims was filled with darts, and the wretched sufferers\r\nexpired under the most excruciating torments. Then, of the rest of the\r\nMoorish prisoners, three divisions were made; one for the redemption of\r\nChristian captives, one to be distributed among the victors as slaves,\r\nand one to be publicly sold into slavery.\r\n\r\nSpanish knights returned from their incursions against the Moors with\r\nstrings of turbaned heads hanging from their saddle-bows, which, as they\r\npassed along, they threw to the boys in the streets, in order to inspire\r\ntheir youthful minds with hatred to the foes of their religion.\r\n\r\nFrom making slaves of prisoners of war, a traffic in human flesh\r\nsprings up. A slave-trade association was formed in Portugal in 1443.\r\nGonzalez brought slaves to Seville; Columbus sent to Spain a cargo of\r\nIndian slaves in 1495; in 1503 the enslavement of American Indians\r\nwas authorized by Ferdinand and Isabella; and in 1508 the African\r\nslave-trade unfolded in all its hideous barbarity. The slave-trade,\r\nhowever, was tolerated by these sovereigns from mistaken kindness,\r\nrather than from cruelty. It was to shield the Indian, who died under\r\nthe infliction of labor, that Isabella permitted the importation of\r\nAfricans into the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIVILIZED TORTURES.]\r\n\r\nCruelty was a prominent wheel in the machinery of government, as well as\r\nin religious discipline. Torture was deemed inseparable from justice,\r\neither as preparatory to trial to elicit a confession of guilt, or as\r\npart of an execution to increase the punishment. Hippolite de Marsilli,\r\na learned jurisconsult of Bologna, mentioned fourteen ways of inflicting\r\ntorture, which are given by Lacroix. Among them were compressing the\r\nlimbs with instruments or cords; the injection of water, vinegar, or\r\noil; application of hot pitch; starvation; placing hot eggs under the\r\narmpits; introducing dice under the skin; tying lighted candles to\r\nthe fingers which were consumed with the wax, and dropping water from\r\na great height upon the stomach. Josse Damhoudere mentioned thirteen\r\nmodes of execution or punishment—fire, the sword, mechanical force,\r\nquartering, the wheel, the fork, the gibbet, dragging, spiking, cutting\r\noff the ears, dismembering, hogging, and the pillory. Every country had\r\nits peculiar system of torture.\r\n\r\nIn 1547 English vagrants were branded with a V and enslaved for two\r\nyears. Should the unfortunate attempt escape, a hot S was burned into\r\nthe flesh and he was a slave for life. A second attempted escape was\r\ndeath. In those days wife-whipping was a common and respectable domestic\r\ndiscipline; culprits in the pillory and stocks were stationed in the\r\nmarketplace where all the people might strike them; prisoners were\r\nstripped of their clothes, confined in filthy dungeons half filled with\r\nstagnant water, and there not unfrequently left to starve, while slimy\r\nreptiles crawled over the naked body, or drove their poisonous fangs\r\ninto the quivering flesh.\r\n\r\nThe sports of the Spaniards we now regard as cruel, as ours will be\r\nregarded four hundred years hence. Although delighting in games, in\r\npantomimic dance, in fencing, wrestling, running, leaping, hunting,\r\nhawking, with the gentler pastime of song and guitar, the more popular\r\namusements were cock-fights, dog and bull fights, bull and bear fights,\r\nbear and dog fights, enjoyed alike by high and low, by women, boys,\r\nand men, by laity and clergy. Sometimes fighters would enter the arena\r\nblindfolded and engage in deadly encounter. Yet how much more cruel were\r\nthese sports than modern horse-racing, cock-fighting, dog-fighting,\r\nprize-fighting, rope-walking, lion-taming, steeple-chases, to say\r\nnothing of the more gentlemanly cruelty of raising foxes to be hunted,\r\nand worried, and finally torn in pieces by dogs, let posterity judge.\r\nI do not say that the sixteenth-century sports of Spain were not more\r\ncruel than the English sports of to-day. I think they were. But that\r\nSpaniards were inherently more cruel, that is to say, that their hearts\r\nwere more wickedly wanton, their sympathies more inhumane, or that they\r\nenjoyed a more ardent pleasure in inflicting pain upon others than men\r\ndo now, I do not believe. The Spaniards were a nation of soldiers, and\r\nsoldiers are necessarily cruel. Men go to war to hurt the enemy, not\r\nto be kind to him. Unquestionably the effect of bull-fights, like the\r\ngladiatorial shows of imperial Rome, was debasing, tending to excite\r\na love of the bloody and terrible, and to render insipid tamer and\r\nmore refined amusements. This to them was a misfortune, although the\r\nrepulsive sport did foster a spirit of courage and endurance.\r\n\r\nThe _corrida de toros_, bull-run, or bull-fight, the national sport of\r\nSpain, is a relic of Moorish chivalry, yet no less Spanish than Arabic;\r\nfor the institution as it exists in Spain is found neither in Africa\r\nnor in Arabia. Originally, as in the ancient tournament, in the sport\r\nengaged only cavaliers, or gentlemen, in whom were combined such skill\r\nand strength that the head of a bull was sometimes stricken off by\r\na single blow of the _montante_. Since which time the tournament has\r\ndegenerated into a prize-ring, and the chivalrous bull-fight which in\r\nprinciple was a display of courage combined with skill in horsemanship,\r\nand in the use of the lance, has become a sort of dramatic shambles,\r\nwhere the actors are low-born and mercenary professionals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPANISH DOMESTIC LIFE.]\r\n\r\nThe home life of the Spaniard, which pictures his softer shades of\r\ncharacter, and shows the more delicate tracings of his mental and moral\r\nsensibilities, must not be disregarded. There alone we shall see him as\r\nhe is, stripped of the paraphernalia attending his appearance before\r\nmen, with the intents and purposes of heart and mind laid open before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed how the genius of the Mahometan clung to the soil long\r\nafter he was driven away; to this day southern Spain is more Arabic\r\nthan Gothic. The towns of Andalusia—of which Cádiz, with its whitewashed\r\nantiquity and its streets and walls clean as a _taza de plata_, is the\r\nkey; and Seville, radiant with sunny gardens and glittering towers,\r\nis the pride—consist of narrow, tortuous streets walled by Moorish\r\nmansions enclosing cool courts. Shutterless windows, through which\r\nhalf-muffled lovers whisper soft nothings to bar-imprisoned _señoritas_,\r\nopen without; fresh young love and musty antiquity thus mingling in\r\nharmonious contrast. Then, favored by the voluptuous air of spring, or\r\nbroiling beneath the enervating heat of summer, are Granada, Córdova,\r\nand Málaga, where glory and shame, heroic virtue and unblushing vice,\r\nerudition and ignorance, Christianity and paganism were so blended that\r\nthe past and present seem almost one. As if proud of their Moorish\r\norigin, these cities of southern Spain battle with time, and hold in\r\nfast embrace the shadows of departed grandeur. The better class of\r\nMoorish houses are yet preserved; and the otherwise unendurable heat\r\nof this so-called oven of Spain is rendered supportable by the narrow,\r\ncrooked streets—so narrow, indeed, that in some of them vehicles can\r\nnot pass each other—and by the irregular, projecting stories of the\r\nterrace-roofed houses.\r\n\r\nThough widely separate in their religious systems much there is alike\r\nin the national characteristics of these grave and haughty sheiks and\r\nthe Spaniards. To both were given conquest, wealth, and opportunity.\r\nBoth struggled blindly and bravely, sinking into national decay and\r\ncorruption, which closed in around them like a pestilence. But in their\r\nreligion there was no doubt a difference. One was sensual, the other\r\nspiritual. In one were the seeds of progress, of intellectual culture,\r\nand of all those enlightenments and refinements which make men more\r\nfit to dominate this earth. And though the _Allah akbar_ echoes from\r\nthe receding hosts who worship God and his prophet, yet its mission\r\nis fulfilled. Where now is the might of Mauritania? Where the power\r\nand pride that caused Egypt to dream again of the days of the Pharaohs\r\nand the Ptolemies? Syria and Palestine are desolate, Bedouinized. To\r\nBagdad remains but the memory of ancient splendor; her palaces are\r\nheaps. No more the good Haroun al Raschid walks her streets; no more\r\nthe universities of Kufa and Bassora, Samarcand and Balkh enlighten the\r\nworld. The sons of Hagar have had their day; their work is done. What\r\nSpain and her colonies now are need not here be told.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DWELLINGS AND FURNITURE.]\r\n\r\nEvery Spanish town has its plaza, great square, or public market-place,\r\nwhich every day presents a busy scene. Thither in early morning resort\r\nthe improvident—though not specially lazy—common people for their daily\r\nsupply of food. Then there is the _paseo_, or public promenade, or,\r\nas it is more frequently called, the _alameda_, from _álamo_, poplar,\r\na beautiful walk, shaded on either side by trees. There may be seen\r\nevery pleasant day after the _siesta_, or midday sleep, groups of\r\neither sex, and all classes, high and low, rich and poor, walking to\r\nand fro, chatting, smoking, flirting, drinking in health and content\r\nand merriment with the cool, delicious evening air; while ladies in\r\ncarriages and cavaliers on curveting steeds occupy and enliven the\r\nroadway.\r\n\r\nNumberless kinds of dwellings obtain in various parts, conspicuous among\r\nwhich are the Asturian caverns, the subterranean abodes of La Mancha,\r\nthe forts of Castile, and the Moorish palaces of Andalusia. Stone, hewn\r\nand unhewn, is the material employed in mountainous districts; _adobe_,\r\nor sun-dried brick, with thatched roof, upon the plains. A common class\r\nof architecture is a windowless parallelogram divided into two rooms,\r\none for the family, and the other for the cattle, the attic being used\r\nas a barn. Houses of this kind are built in one and two stories. An\r\nout-house for stores, which is also used as a sleeping-place for the\r\nwomen, perched on pillars eight feet high, sometimes stands adjacent.\r\nAcross one end of the family room, which, of necessity, is used for\r\nall domestic purposes, extends a fire-place, ten or fifteen feet in\r\nlength and six feet in depth, over which is a large bell-shaped chimney\r\nextending out into the middle of the room. This style of building might\r\nbe elaborated, wings added, or the form changed. Tiled roofs are common,\r\nand overhanging eaves. Some houses are of three or four stories; others\r\nrun out long and low upon the ground. More pretentious dwellings are\r\noften in the form of a hollow square, with a _patio_ and garden within.\r\nOf such are convents with cloisters, and over them ranges of corridors\r\nand rooms.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper classes the apartments of the lady consist of an\r\nantechamber, or drawing-room, a boudoir, a bed-room, a dressing-room,\r\nand an oratory. The drawing-room is furnished with tapestry hangings\r\non which are represented battles and biblical scenes—war and religion\r\neven here; polished oak or mahogany high-backed chairs, clumsy, and\r\nelaborately carved; in the corners of the room triangular tables on\r\nwhich stand heavy silver or gold candlesticks with sperm candles,\r\nthe light from which is reflected by small oval Venetian mirrors, in\r\nfantastically wrought gold or silver frames; cupboards with glass doors\r\nfor plate, etc. In the boudoir is a toilet-table before Venetian mirrors\r\nprofusely draped in handsome lace; a book-case, work-table, arm-chairs,\r\nsacred paintings and family portraits; in the sleeping-room, a tall\r\nheavy bedstead with damask or velvet curtains, a crucifix—the image\r\nof silver or gold, and the cross of ivory—with a little basin of holy\r\nwater near it, a _priedieu_ and prayer-book; in the dressing-room a\r\nwardrobe, and all necessary toilet appliances; in the oratory an altar,\r\na crucifix, two or more priedieux, and, if mass is said, as is often\r\nthe case in the houses of the great or wealthy, images of saints by the\r\nmasters, with all the accompanying ornaments of devotion.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings of southern Spain, large and small, lean toward the\r\nArabic in architecture—Arabic decorations, with second-story balconies;\r\nthe rooms rich in carved ceilings, wainscoting, and arabesque; the\r\nentrance from the street in city houses being through a vestibule and\r\nan ornamented iron-grated gate. During the summer, when the sun's rays\r\nstrike like poisoned darts, the family live for the most part in the\r\npatio. There upon the marble pavement, beside the cooling fountain, and\r\namidst fragrant orange, palm, and citron trees, visitors are received,\r\nchocolate drank, and cigarettes smoked. There too they dance to the\r\nmusic of the guitar, play cards, and take their siesta.\r\n\r\nTo oriental customs may be attributed the jealous privacy by which\r\nthe women of Spain were guarded by husbands and fathers. Besides her\r\nnatural weakness, woman was yet inferior, inept, characterless, not\r\nto be trusted. The fortress-like houses of the better sort, which are\r\nscattered all over the table-land of the Peninsula, with their spacious\r\ninner court and iron-barred windows, were so arranged that the part\r\noccupied by the female members of the household was separate from the\r\nmore public rooms of the men. This precinct was unapproachable by any\r\nbut the most intimate friend or invited guest. Their domestic policy,\r\nlike every other, was suspicious and guarded.\r\n\r\nThis is further illustrated by the mode of entering a house, which also\r\nshows the effect of centuries of warfare upon manners. In outer doors,\r\nand in those of distinct floors, and apartments, was inserted a small\r\ngrate and slide. On knocking, the slide moved back, and at the grating\r\nappeared the lustrous, searching eyes of the inmate. \"Quien es?\" Who\r\nis it? was the salutation from within. \"Gente de paz.\" Peaceful people,\r\nwas the reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOMEN AND DRESS.]\r\n\r\nExtreme sensitiveness with regard to dress characterizes Spaniards\r\nof the better sort, and rather than appear in public unbecomingly\r\nattired, they remain hidden at home, only stealing out for necessities\r\nat nightfall, or perhaps in the early morn, and then back to their home\r\nfor the day. In this we see a strong mixture of pride and _bienséance_,\r\nin which there is more sensitiveness than sense. But man can not live\r\nby reason alone. He who in this factitious world is guided only by the\r\ninstincts of a sound mind, regardless of the frivolities of fashion, of\r\n_convenance_, indifferent to his neighbor's ideas of propriety, and to\r\nany taste except his own, commits a mistake. Though he alone is wise,\r\nand all the world fools, yet of necessity he must become foolish, else\r\nhe is not wise.\r\n\r\nMales, in their costume, were the birds of gay plumage at the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century. So fantastically clad was the English\r\nnobleman in his laced doublet and open gown, that he was scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from a woman. In the time of Charles V. courtiers dressed\r\nin bright colors, but with his sombre son Philip, all was black—black\r\nvelvet trimmed with jet; and stiff—stiff collars, and stiff black\r\ntruncated cone hats, with brim scarcely an inch wide, in place of the\r\nsoft slouchy _sombrero_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MANTILLA AND CAPA.]\r\n\r\nThe national and characteristic garment of both sexes in Spain for about\r\nthree centuries was, for the outer covering, the _capa_, or cloak, of\r\nthe cavalier, and the _mantilla_ of the lady. In the reign of Charles\r\nV. the former was a short cape, and the latter simply a head-dress;\r\nbut with time both enlarged until one reached below the knee, and the\r\nother below the waist. Some writers give to these garments a remote\r\nantiquity. They point to ancient coins where Iberia is represented as\r\na veiled woman, and ignoring sex claim that to the Iberians the Romans\r\ngave the _toga_, and that for fifteen centuries the fashion continued.\r\nOthers deny such connection. It is undoubtedly true that the capa of\r\nthe sixteenth century was much shorter than the cloak of to-day, being\r\na cape rather than a cloak, and not at all resembling the Roman toga.\r\nSebastian Franc in his _Weltbuch_, Tübingen, 1534, writes: \"Their women\r\nwear a curious dress around the neck; they have an iron band to which\r\nare fastened bent prongs reaching over the head, over which, when they\r\ndesire it, they draw a cloth for the protection of the head, and this\r\nthey hold to be a great ornament.\" To the men and women of Spain this\r\ngarment is as the shell to the turtle; within it, though on a crowded\r\nthoroughfare, they may at any moment retire from the world, and ensconce\r\nthemselves within themselves. The cavalier with a peculiar fling,\r\nutterly unattainable by a foreigner, throws the skirt over the breast\r\nand shoulder so as to partially or completely hide the face according to\r\nhis pleasure. On the way to and from church the lady's face is covered;\r\nand the gallant sighing for a glimpse of features divinely fair, is\r\nobliged to enter the sanctuary, hide behind a column near the altar;\r\nthen as one female after another approaches, kneels, and unveils, he\r\nmay feast his eyes on the faces before him. The mantilla serves as a\r\nbonnet, veil, and shawl; formerly it was but an oblong piece of cloth,\r\nwith velvet or lace border; later a lace veil was added as part of it;\r\nand now the Spanish female face is becoming more and more visible in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe capa is indispensable to the Spaniard; it fits his nature like a\r\nglove, and is almost a part of him. It may be worn over a rich dress,\r\nor it may conceal rags or nakedness; it may cover a noble, generous\r\nheart, or a multitude of sins. Hidden beneath it, in secret the wearer\r\nmay work out his purpose, though in the market-place. It keeps out the\r\ncold; it may hide the assassin's dagger; it serves as a disguise in love\r\nintrigues, and is a grateful protection from importunate creditors.\r\nTwisted round the left arm, it is a shield; at night, it is a bed;\r\nand with a sword, _capa y espada_, it not unfrequently constitutes the\r\nentire earthly possessions of the haughty, poverty-stricken cavalier.\r\nWhatever be the character or condition of the wearer, dignity is lent\r\nhim by its ample folds, and comeliness by its graceful drapery. It is\r\nan unpardonable breach of decorum for a muffled cavalier to address\r\na person, or for any one to speak to him while so muffled. Politeness\r\nteaches him to throw open to his friend both his garment and his heart,\r\nthat it may be plain that no concealed weapon is in the one, or malice\r\nin the other. A son dare not speak to his own father when his face is\r\ncovered by his cloak.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry flaunted the gayest and most picturesque attire on holiday\r\noccasions; the _majo_, a rustic beau, wore a figured velvet waistcoat\r\nwith square velvet buttons, and brilliant with colored ribbons;\r\nembroidered stockings, silver-buckled shoes, and a colored capa thrown\r\ngracefully over the left shoulder. The dress of Fígaro in the play, is\r\nthat of an Andalusian dandy. The costume of Valencia is more Asiatic,\r\nor Asiatic-antique it might be called, partaking somewhat, as it does,\r\nof the ancient Greek costume—wide linen drawers, linen shirt, hempen\r\nsandals, footless stockings, wide red woollen belt, gay velvet jacket\r\nwith silken sash, with a colored capa over all. The long hair is bound\r\nby a silken band in the form of a turban. The female peasant dress is\r\nno less showy; a red velvet bodice, with scarlet or purple petticoat,\r\nall profusely embroidered, a gay-colored square-cut mantilla fastened\r\nby a silver brooch, with chains and jewels and colored stones according\r\nto the purse of the wearer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIOUS COSTUMES.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary peasant dress of Estremadura consists of wide cloth\r\nknee-breeches, closely resembling those of the Moors, a gabardine\r\nof cloth or leather, and cloth leggings. The men wear the hair long.\r\nThe women have a fashion of putting on a great number of petticoats;\r\nthe rustic belles of Zamarramala, a village of Estremadura, manage\r\nto carry from fourteen to seventeen. In Andalusia the men have short\r\njackets ornamented with jet or steel beads, knee-breeches, and highly\r\nornamented leathern leggings; the women wear short embroidered and\r\nflounced petticoats, and a Moorish sleeveless jacket embroidered with\r\ngold or silver and laced in front. Asturian peasants have wooden shoes\r\nwith three large nails in the soles, which keep them from the ground;\r\nleathern shoes they frequently carry in their travels, and to and from\r\nchurch, under their arms, or on their heads, putting them on just before\r\nentering the village or church. The women wear ear-rings and necklaces\r\nof glass imitation of coral; a handkerchief, folded triangularly, covers\r\nthe head; at funerals, a large black mantle is worn. The Castilians\r\nwear sandals, called _abarcas_, tied to the ankle by narrow strips\r\nof rawhide. The Estremadurans wear a hat, very broad-brimmed; the\r\nCatalonians, a red Phrygian cap; the Valencians, a kind of Greek cap;\r\nthe Asturians, a three-cornered black or dark blue cap with velvet\r\nfacings; the Biscayans, a flat red woollen cap; the Andalusians, a\r\nturban-like hat, or a silk handkerchief. In Aragon, as well as in some\r\nof the southern provinces, the broad-brimmed slouching sombrero obtains.\r\nHats were invented by a Swiss, Pansian, in 1404, and a Spaniard first\r\nmanufactured them in London in 1510. Jews in Spain were obliged to wear\r\nyellow hats; in Germany bankrupts, in like manner, were required to wear\r\nhats of green and yellow.\r\n\r\nThe general costume of a Spanish nobleman consisted of a silk gabardine,\r\nwith sleeves close-fitting at the wrist but puffed and slashed between\r\nthe elbow and shoulder so as to show the fine linen shirt beneath;\r\nchamois-skin doublet, thick but flexible; silk hose, and silk trowsers\r\nslashed; long bell-shaped boots with golden spur-supporters; broad,\r\npolished leathern belt, from which hung a long sword on the left side,\r\nand a long dagger in a leathern or velvet scabbard on the right; a\r\nround, soft, broad-brimmed beaver hat, with an ostrich-feather fastened\r\nby a diamond brooch on the side or in front; a cape or cloak embroidered\r\nor laced with gold or silver thread, fastened with cord and tassel,\r\nand worn hanging from the left shoulder, or thrown around the body so\r\nas to cover part of the face. Within doors, the cloak was laid aside;\r\na velvet doublet was substituted for the leathern one; and instead of\r\nboots, shoes of leather or velvet, slashed over the toes, were worn.\r\nThe dress of the lady was a heavy, flowing brocade or velvet skirt, open\r\nin front, displaying an underdress of light silk or satin; a chemisette\r\nwith slashed sleeves; a stomacher with long ends hanging in front, and\r\na velvet sleeveless jacket laced with gold or silver cord. The breast\r\nwas covered with lace, and the neck and shoulders were bare, except\r\nwhen covered by the _toca_, a kind of head-dress, out of which by\r\nelongation grew the characteristic mantilla. Her shoes were of velvet,\r\nher stockings of silk or wool; from the waist on the right side hung a\r\nreticule, a silver or gold whistle for calling servants, and a poniard.\r\nHer _dueña_ wore a black skirt, and a large black mantle completely\r\ncovering the head, face, and shoulders down to the waist. Swords formed\r\nno part of domestic dress prior to the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nBlack was the color of the church, certain clerical orders excepted.\r\nThose of the learned professions wore black. The ladies usually attended\r\nchurch in black, and indeed were sometimes seen in sombre hues upon\r\nthe alameda. Black robes and a canoe-shaped hat covered the Basque\r\npriest; and the friar, sackcloth and gray, bound round the waist with a\r\ntwisted cord. _Alguaciles_, or constables, followed the ancient cavalier\r\ncostume—broad-brimmed hat, black cloak, short knee-breeches, black\r\nstockings, silver-buckled shoes, Vandyke ruffles, and white lace collar.\r\nThis in the Basque provinces only. Friars appeared in a hooded robe,\r\nextending to the ankles, over woollen breeches and jacket. A cord was\r\ntied round the waist from which hung a rosary. Hempen or leathern shoes\r\nwere worn, and by some orders broad hats. The robe of the friar was of\r\ncoarse wool; that of the clergyman serge, with a cloak, low leathern\r\nshoes with buckle, black stockings, knee-breeches, a white collar,\r\nand a black hat with broad brim turned up at the sides. The robes of\r\nvicars, parish curates, and other church dignitaries were of silk. The\r\nFranciscan's robe was of a yellowish gray color, the Dominican's white,\r\nthe Carmelite's reddish gray, the Capuchin's silver gray, the Jesuit's\r\nblack. The bishop's color was violet, the cardinal's red or purple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDomestic routine in Spain, with allowances for class, season, and\r\nlocality, was substantially as follows. The noble or wealthy master\r\nof a household was served before rising with chocolate, which service\r\nwas called the _desayuno_. He then rose and dressed; after which,\r\nkneeling before the crucifix, he said a prayer; then he proceeded to\r\nthe avocations of the day, taking _las once_, or the eleven o'clock\r\nluncheon of cake and wine, either at home or at the house of a friend,\r\nor wherever he happened to be. After a twelve or one o'clock dinner\r\ncame the siesta. At five o'clock there was to be eaten the _merienda_,\r\nconsisting of chocolate, preserved fruit, and ices; and between nine and\r\neleven, supper. In the private chapel of the grandees mass was said.\r\nThe middle class usually attended church about sunrise; after which\r\nbreakfast, and at noon dinner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUS TRAINING.]\r\n\r\nThe religious training of children was excessive. At daybreak the\r\n_angelus_ was recited, then to chapel or church to mass, after which\r\nthe child might breakfast; at noon angelus and dinner; after the siesta\r\nvespers at church, and rosary at home; at six o'clock angelus and\r\nchocolate; prayers at eight; supper at nine; after which more prayers\r\nand to bed. The child was expected to attend all these devotions, the\r\nnight prayer perhaps excepted, the youngest children being sent to bed\r\nafter the rosary. And this not alone Sunday, but every day.\r\n\r\nA national dish, centuries old, common to Spain and all Spanish\r\ncountries, called the _olla podrida_, constitutes a staple food with\r\nalmost all classes. It is made of meat and vegetables boiled together,\r\nbut usually served in two dishes, and its constituents depend upon\r\nthe resources of the cook, for everything eatable is put into it that\r\ncan be obtained. Beef, mutton, pork, and fowl; beans, peas, potatoes,\r\nonions, cabbage, and garlic; the water in which the mess is boiled is\r\nserved as soup with rice or bread, and the two courses constitute the\r\nwhole of every meal of the lower classes. On the tables of the wealthy,\r\nafter the olla podrida, fish, roast meats, and a profuse dessert of\r\nsweetmeats, jellies, preserves, and bonbons are served. The Andalusians\r\nmake a salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, green-peppers, chiccory,\r\nwith oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and stale bread, which with them is a\r\nstaple dish, called _gazpacho_.\r\n\r\nIt was a gluttonous, sensual age, that of the century preceding\r\nour epoch; but from these vices Spain was probably more free than\r\nany other civilized nation of Europe. There the discipline of war\r\nabsorbed the attention which elsewhere was given to luxurious living.\r\nWe find nothing in Spain such as we are told about in England, where\r\nthe households of the great were composed of brawling retainers,\r\nill-mannered clowns, and riotous serving men and women who terminated\r\nmany a feast with bloodshed; where guests snatched and scrambled for\r\nfood, gorging themselves with whatever they could lay hands on; where\r\ndrunken broils were of daily occurrence, and the master of the household\r\nwas not unfrequently obliged to sheath his sword in the body of some\r\ncontumacious servant grown dangerous by the unbridled license in which\r\nhe had been indulged.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say of the monks and cardinals now grown fat from the\r\nwell filled coffers of the Church? With their wealth in some instances\r\nthey had grown sensuous and extravagant. Their cupboards were loaded\r\nwith rich viands, in which they freely indulged; and their tables were\r\nsurrounded by musicians and all the luxuries and delicacies the world\r\ncould contribute. Not to the faults of the few, however, would we call\r\ntoo much attention, but to the virtues of the many; for during these\r\ndark years of ignorance and voluptuousness the Church was planting and\r\nwatering the seeds of the sanctity of marriage and domestic life in\r\nSpain, and surrounding the family altar with so many safeguards among\r\nher people, that the long ages since have not sufficed to dispel nor\r\ndestroy them. The wealthy families of Spain had their court jesters,\r\nbut coarse buffoonery or indecent jests were seldom tolerated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOOD AND FILTHINESS.]\r\n\r\nTwo persons often ate from one plate, using their fingers for forks.\r\nA sheath-knife, or dagger, which they carried upon the person, served\r\nto cut the food. Among the first books printed in Venice was a folio\r\nvolume on cookery, issued in 1475. In the English metrical _Stans Puer\r\nad Mensam_, following Wright, the guest is told to \"bring no knyves\r\nunskoured to the table;\" in other words, his sheath knife should be\r\nclean, and he is also informed that polite persons will not pick their\r\nteeth with it while at table. It was considered a breach of good manners\r\nto blow the nose with the same fingers used in conveying food to the\r\nmouth. Hats were worn by the men, and head-dresses by the women, on all\r\ndomestic occasions. In France, the metrical _Contenances de Table_, or\r\nmanual of table manners, shows but little more refinement there than\r\nelsewhere. Among other directions the reader is told first to examine\r\nhis seat whether it be clean:\r\n\r\n     \"Enfant, prens de regarder peine\r\n     Sur le siege où tu te fierras,\r\n     Se aucune chose y verras\r\n     Qui soit deshonneste où vilaine.\"\r\n\r\nHe is forbidden to spit upon the table while at dinner:\r\n\r\n     \"Ne craiche par dessus la table\r\n     Car c'est chose desconvenable.\"\r\n\r\nOr to spurt water from his mouth into the basin used in common by the\r\ncompany:\r\n\r\n     \"Quant tu bouche tu laveras\r\n     Ou bacin point ne cracheras.\"\r\n\r\nOr leave sops in his wine glass:\r\n\r\n     \"Se tu fais souppes en ton verre\r\n     Boy le vin ou le gette à terre.\"\r\n\r\nBut by implication he may spurt and throw remnants on the floor, as much\r\nas he pleases.\r\n\r\nEven in their use of tobacco, of which they are excessively fond, the\r\nSpaniards are temperate. Though they smoke it almost constantly, it is\r\nin such small quantities, and in so mild a form, that tobacco does them\r\nless injury than it inflicts on many other nations. It was the custom to\r\ncarry a daily supply wrapped in a lettuce or cabbage leaf to preserve it\r\nmoist. The cigarette was prepared for smoking by taking a small quantity\r\nof tobacco, finely cut, rolling it in a piece of corn-husk or paper, and\r\nlighting with flint, steel, and punk. Though the tobacco may be strong,\r\nprepared in this way the effect is less injurious than when rolled in\r\nlarger quantities into a cigar, or cut from a plug and smoked from a\r\npipe or chewed.\r\n\r\nNoble youths of both sexes were accustomed, to serve a sort of\r\napprenticeship for a number of years in the king's household. In like\r\nmanner the sons and daughters of gentlemen served in the houses of the\r\nnobility, and common people in the houses of gentlemen, that each might\r\nbe benefited by the knowledge and refinement of his superior.\r\n\r\nSpaniards, as I have said, are called inhospitable; but this charge must\r\nbe taken with allowance. Every phase of human nature has its generous\r\nquality; locked in every heart is a wealth of kindliness which opens to\r\nhim who holds the key. By nature these people are reserved, suspicious.\r\nThey carry no window in their breast. In their domestic affairs they are\r\nspecially reticent before strangers. Their wives and daughters they hide\r\naway; their troubles they cover within the ashes that preserve them;\r\ntheir sensibilities shrink from cold contact with the world. If some\r\nfind certain Spaniards at given periods inhospitable, others at other\r\ntimes and places find them very generous. In early times inns were not\r\ncommon in Spain, and we are told that in certain places every private\r\nhouse had its guest's quarters consisting of one or more rooms according\r\nto the opulence of the owner. To this apartment every stranger of\r\nwhatsoever degree was welcome. There he lived as long as he pleased, fed\r\nand cared for by the host; and—you may call it pride—if through poverty\r\nprovisions grew scarce, the family would undergo the greatest privation\r\nrather than the guest should suffer want, or be forced to hasten his\r\ndeparture. Furthermore all was free; to offer pay for entertainment was\r\ndeemed an insult, though a present might be given and accepted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMUSEMENTS.]\r\n\r\nWhile called a melancholy people, amusement appeared at times to be\r\nthe life of the nation. Royalty and religion at rest, peace here and\r\nhereafter secured, there was nothing more of life than to enjoy it. To\r\nlabor when one might repose; to sigh when one might sing; to undergo the\r\npains of culture when sweet pleasure temptingly proposed a holiday—ah\r\nno! Fools attempt to better their condition and make it worse. Let those\r\nwho need improving scour themselves; we know enough.\r\n\r\nSo lazily lapped in stupidity, beside their feast-days and bull-fights,\r\ntheir passions and passion-plays, they lolled upon the greensward and\r\ndanced to tambourine and castanets, and wrestled, and ran races; they\r\nfenced, fought, played cards, shook dice, and enlivened home monotony by\r\nall sorts of games and gymnastic exercises. Dancing was carried to such\r\nexcess as to lead to dissoluteness and occasional death, even as it does\r\nto-day. The dances of the peasantry in many instances bear a striking\r\nresemblance to those of the native races of America. In Asturias, men,\r\nand sometimes men and women, form a circle joining hands by the little\r\nfinger. A leader sings in plaintive monotone a description of some\r\nSpanish feat of arms prior to the eleventh century, or of a tournament\r\nof later days, or of some unhappy love adventure, or of a thrilling\r\nincident in the conquest of America. At the end of every strophe, all\r\nsing in chorus the refrain which sometimes terminates in an invocation,\r\nas for example, May Saint Peter be with me! May the Magdalen protect\r\nus! The dance is a long step forward, and two short steps backward and\r\nlaterally to the right, so that the circle keeps constantly moving in\r\nthat direction, meanwhile keeping time to the music with arms as well as\r\nfeet. These dances take place on Sunday afternoons, and on feast-days,\r\nand when the priest is present men and women are separated in the dance.\r\nThe _fandango_, danced by two persons with castanets to the music of\r\nthe guitar, is peculiar to the south of Spain.\r\n\r\nBetween the eras proper of tournaments and bull-fights, a species\r\nof tilting called _correr la sortija_ was greatly in vogue. A gold\r\nfinger-ring was suspended by a thread from the top of a pole, and at\r\nit charged the cavalier with lance in rest and horse at full speed. The\r\nsmallness of the object, its constant motion, and its proximity to the\r\npole rendered it an exceedingly difficult feat to accomplish.\r\n\r\nCards and dice were at this time in the height of their fascination.\r\nEvery class, age, profession, and sex were filled with a passion\r\nfor gambling—a most levelling vice, at this juncture, bringing in\r\ncontact noble and commoner, knight and squire, women, servants, and\r\ntrades-people. An English poet about the year 1500 thus laments the\r\ndegeneracy of the nobles:\r\n\r\n     \"Before thys tyme they lovyd for to juste,\r\n       And in shotynge chefely they sett ther mynde;\r\n     And ther landys and possessyons now sett they moste,\r\n       And at cardes and dyce ye may them ffynde.\"\r\n\r\nFrom her low estate of mediæval drudge or plaything, woman was lifted\r\nby the exaltation of the Virgin,—lifted too high by chivalry; then fell\r\ntoo low with the sensual reaction. Finally, after many waverings, she\r\nrises again, and in the more favored spheres takes her rightful place\r\nbeside her lord, his confidant and equal. At the time of which I write,\r\nhowever, she was less respected than now, and hence less respectable;\r\nless trusted, and consequently less trustworthy. Her virtue, fortified\r\nby bolts and bars at home, was watched by servants abroad. Falling into\r\nthe customs of the invaders during Moslem domination, Castilian ladies\r\nbecame more and more retired, until the dwelling was little better than\r\na nunnery. The days of tournaments, and jousts, and troubadours were\r\nover, and indifference succeeded chivalric sentimentality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FEMALE CHASTITY.]\r\n\r\nSeldom has Spanish society been conspicuous for its high moral tone.\r\nFemale chastity was an abstract quality, the property of the father\r\nor husband, rather than an inherent virtue for the safe-keeping of\r\nwhich the female possessor was responsible. The master of a household\r\nexercised sovereign authority therein, claiming even the power of life\r\nand death over the members of his family. He was addressed in the third\r\nperson as 'your worship;' sons dare not cover their head, cross their\r\nlegs, or even sit in his presence unless so directed; daughters were\r\nbetrothed without their knowledge, and to men whom they had never seen;\r\nthe selection of a husband rested entirely with the father, and the\r\ndaughter had only to acquiesce. Female decorum and purity were placed\r\nunder espionage. A dueña kept guard over the wife and daughter at home,\r\nand closely followed at their heels whenever they stepped into the\r\nstreet. Ladies, closely veiled, marched solemnly to church, preceded\r\nby a _rodrigon_, or squire, with cushion and prayer-book, and followed\r\nby a dueña. At service, her place was in front, and men took up their\r\nstation behind her. Teach woman first that she is inferior, next that\r\nshe is impotent; add to this intellectual inanity and implied moral\r\nunaccountability, and you have a creature ripe for wickedness.\r\n\r\nThis excess of caution defeated its own purpose. Women, left much alone\r\nwithin their cloister-like homes, waited not in vain for opportunity.\r\nThe gay mistress could often too easily win over her attendant, and make\r\nof her dueña a go-between; yet if we may believe the record, infidelity\r\nwas rare, and for two reasons. First, woman in her seclusion escaped\r\nmany temptations; and secondly, a wholesome fear, the certainty that\r\nvengeance, swift and sure, would follow the offence, resulting in the\r\ndeath of one or both offenders, placed a curb on passion. Females of\r\nthe lower classes, left alone to take care of their virtue as best\r\nthey might, with faces open and actions free, were less given to\r\ntransgression than their wealthier sisters.\r\n\r\nLewd women could not testify in criminal cases. Respectable women\r\nwere permitted to testify, but the judge was obliged to wait on them\r\nat their homes, as they were not allowed to attend court. Learning to\r\nwrite was discouraged in females, as they could then have it in their\r\npower to scribble love-letters to their gallants. Queen Isabella did\r\nmuch to elevate and purify both religion and morals. The court of\r\nEnrique IV., her predecessor, has been described as but little better\r\nthan a brothel, where \"the queen, a daughter of Portugal, lived openly\r\nwith her parasites and gallants, as the king did with his minions and\r\nmistresses.\" Maids of honor were trained courtesans, and the noblemen\r\nof the court occupied their time in illicit amours and love intrigues.\r\nFrom the king on his throne to his lowest subject, all who could afford\r\nit kept a mistress.\r\n\r\nWare states that within a century the widows of Madrid were \"compelled\r\nto pass the whole first year of their mourning in a chamber entirely\r\nhung with black, where not a single ray of the sun could penetrate,\r\nseated on a little mattress with their legs always crossed. When this\r\nyear was over, they retired to pass the second year in a chamber hung\r\nwith grey.\" This savagism is paralleled by the Thlinkeets of Alaska,\r\nwho at certain times confine women in a little kennel for six months,\r\ngiving them one a size larger for the second six months; likewise by\r\nthe Tacullies of New Caledonia, who make the widow carry the deceased\r\nhusband's ashes upon her back in a bag for one or two years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EUROPEAN SOCIETY IN GENERAL.]\r\n\r\nA glance at English and French society shows us, however, that the\r\ncharacter of the Spanish women of this epoch compared favorably with\r\nthat of their northern sisters. Though perhaps no chaster than the\r\nFrench, they were not street-brawlers like the English women. These\r\nlatter, we are told, from whom the men would separate themselves in\r\ntheir debauches, would likewise assemble at the public house, drink\r\ntheir ale, talk loudly and lewdly, and gossip, swear, and fight. In a\r\nreligious play of the period, representing the deluge, Noah, when ready\r\nto enter the ark, seeks his wife, and finds her carousing with her\r\ngossips at the public drink-house.\r\n\r\n\"Young ladies, even of great families,\" says Wright, \"were brought up\r\nnot only strictly but even tyrannically by their mothers, who kept\r\nthem constantly at work, exacted from them almost slavish deference\r\nand respect, and even counted upon their earnings.\" A mother in those\r\ndays was accounted a little severe who beat her daughter \"once in the\r\nweek, or twice, and sometimes twice a day,\" and \"broke her head in two\r\nor three places,\" or still worse, permitted her to \"speak with no man,\r\nwhosoever come.\"\r\n\r\nWitness the wooing of Matilda of Flanders by William the Conqueror.\r\nHaving had the audacity to refuse him, the noble suitor entered her\r\nhome, seized her long tresses, dragged her about the floor, struck her;\r\nthen flinging her from him, he spurned her with his foot. Matilda at\r\nonce accepted him, saying: \"He must be a man of courage who dare beat\r\nme in my father's palace.\"\r\n\r\nPedro el Cruel, king of Castile and Leon, about the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century held good, and commanded, under heavy penalties,\r\nthat no one of the laboring classes, man or woman, who was able to\r\nwork, should be found begging. He fixed the day's wage of every class\r\nwith the most punctilious exactitude. Shoemakers, tailors, armorers,\r\nand others who worked by the job, had a definite price attached to the\r\nmaking of every article. A shoe of such and such leather, made after\r\nsuch a fashion, with a double or single sole; a cloak, lined or unlined;\r\na weapon of an ordinary, or of a superior temper and finish—each article\r\nin its fabrication was to cost just so much and no more.\r\n\r\nIt was an age of interference in the affairs of men, the strong against\r\nthe weak. It was in these trade regulations, and in sumptuary laws, the\r\nsuperstition of political economy and social statics, that the science\r\nof ignorance culminated. It was then that learned men threw dust into\r\nthe air, cast a cloud about their own intellect, and labored hard to\r\ninculcate the principles of nescience into the minds of men. In England\r\nthe number of servants a nobleman might have was fixed by law, as was\r\nalso costume, and the number of courses at dinner. Soup and two dishes\r\nlegally constituted a Frenchman's dinner in 1340.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella were, perhaps, the most parentally inclined of\r\nall. No affair, religious, moral, political, judicial, economical,\r\nliterary, industrial, mechanical, or mercantile could escape their\r\nattention. From the regulation and organization of the high councils,\r\nand of the civil and ecclesiastical tribunals, to the ordinances for\r\nthe leather-dressers and cloth-shearers; from the decrees concerning\r\nthe universities and the literary and scientific bodies, to the orders\r\nthat prescribed the weight of horseshoes; from the general laws on\r\ncommerce and navigation, to those which fixed the expenditure at\r\nweddings and baptisms, and the amount of wax to be burned at funerals;\r\nfrom the highest interests and rights of religion and of the throne,\r\ndown to the most humble and mechanical industries—all were considered,\r\nlegislated upon, and seen to by their Catholic Majesties, with infinite\r\npains and vigilance. In 1510, thinking the colonists of Española too\r\nfond of ostentation and extravagance, Ferdinand issued a proclamation,\r\nforbidding them to wear rich silks, brocades, or gold or silver lace.\r\nOwners of vessels, in times of peace, were forced to engage at fixed\r\nprices in perilous voyages of discovery or commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUMPTUARY LAWS.]\r\n\r\nIn England it appears that the dress of the men commanded the special\r\nattention of their rulers. Spaniards made men and women alike to\r\nfeel the iron heel of sumptuary legislation; while the English, in\r\nlaws of nearly coincident date, for the most part omitted the sex. By\r\ndistinctive qualities, Edward IV., 1461-1483, regulated the dress of his\r\npeople—from the royal cloth-of-gold down to the two-shillings-a-yard,\r\nand under, cloth of the laboring classes; but, if we may believe\r\nSanford, he took care to exempt his women subjects from the provisions\r\nof this act, save only the wives of the two-shillings-a-yard boor, who\r\nmight be expected to have other things to attend to.\r\n\r\nThe continental ladies, it appears, could flaunt it bravely upon\r\noccasion, at least in France and Flanders. For through these countries\r\ncrusaded, in 1428, Thomas Conecte, a Carmelite friar, preaching against\r\nthe evils of the age, or what he considered as such. Among these, dress\r\nheld a place, and many other things not generally condemned at present.\r\nHis manner of going to work was peculiar, and is pretty well described\r\nby Monstrelet.\r\n\r\nIn his audiences he always separated the men from the women by a\r\ncord, \"for he had observed some sly doings between them while he was\r\npreaching.\" Having taken these wise precautions, he was accustomed\r\nearnestly to admonish his hearers \"on the damnation of their souls and\r\non pain of excommunication, to bring to him whatever backgammon-boards,\r\nchessboards, nine-pins, or other instruments for games of amusement\r\nthey might possess.\" Right bitterly would he then attack the luxurious\r\napparel of ladies of rank; especially the monstrous head-gear which was\r\nin fashion at that time; all of which bred trouble, as may readily be\r\nimagined, and produced no good results.\r\n\r\nWe see the same style of preaching indulged in by the Wesleys in England\r\nand Whitefield and others in America at different times, and ever with\r\nthe same lack of practical results. The most costly jewelry, the finest\r\napparel, grand houses and free living are as conspicuous among the\r\nfollowers of these self-sacrificing and conscientious men as among the\r\nmembers of any other church, or among those who are not members of any\r\nchurch. And if the pious Carmelite friar failed in his crusade against\r\nfine clothes, free living, and monstrous head-gear among the Spanish of\r\nthe fifteenth century, so have more modern crusaders failed in similar\r\nattempts in later times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis then was Spain and Spanish character, as nearly as I have been able\r\nto picture them in the short space allotted, at or prior to the dawn\r\nof the sixteenth century. We have found Spaniards the noblest race on\r\nearth at that time; their men brave, their women modest. Before them\r\nopened a career more brilliant than the world has ever seen before or\r\nsince. To follow them in some parts of that career is the purpose of\r\nthese volumes.\r\n\r\nWe have found these people after all not so very different from\r\nourselves—more loyal than we, but more ignorant; more religious, but\r\nmore superstitious; more daring, but more reckless; more enthusiastic,\r\nbut more chimerical. They were endowed with the virtues and vices of\r\ntheir age, as we are with the virtues and vices of ours. They were\r\nsincere in their opinions, and honest in their efforts; but we have\r\nthe advantage of them by four centuries of recorded experiences. Our\r\nknowledge, our advantages, are superior to theirs; do we make superior\r\nuse of them? Spain lighted a hemisphere of dark waters, brought forth\r\nhidden islands and continents, and presented half a world to the other\r\nhalf. With all our boasted improvement, have we done more?\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of historical commentators to praise and to blame _ad\r\nlibitum_. This is right if it be done judiciously. We should praise\r\ndiscreetly, and blame with steadiness. But there is really little to\r\npraise or to blame in history, and most of it that is done is simply\r\npraising or blaming the providence of progress. Would you blame the\r\nSpanish people for being ignorant, submissive, and cruel? They were as\r\nGod and circumstances made them. Would you blame their king and princes\r\nfor domineering them? They were as the people and circumstances made\r\nthem. The people were indignant if their rulers did not impose upon\r\nthem. Says Grenville, writing in his memoirs so late as 1818: \"The\r\nRegent drives in the park every day in a tilbury, with his groom sitting\r\nby his side; grave men are shocked at this undignified practice.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, amidst the many so-called spirits which in this epoch hovered\r\nover man, the spirit of discovery was not the least potent. Curiosity,\r\nthe mother of science, became the mother of new worlds; gave birth to\r\ncontinents, islands, and seas; gave form and boundary to earth. Over the\r\nsea, the mists of the Dark Age had rested with greater density even than\r\non land. The aurora of progress now illumined the western horizon as of\r\nold it did the eastern. Hitherto the great ocean, beyond a few leagues\r\nfrom shore, was a mystery. As may be seen depicted on ancient charts,\r\nit was filled, in the imaginations of navigators, with formidable\r\nwater-beasts and monsters, scarcely less terrible than those that Æneas\r\nsaw as he entered the mouth of Hades:\r\n\r\n     \"Multaque præterea variarum monstra ferarum:\r\n     Centauri in foribus stabulant, Scyllæque biformes,\r\n     et centumgeminus Briareus, ac belua Lernæ\r\n     horrendum stridens, flammisque armata Chimæra,\r\n     Gorgones Harpyiæque et forma tricorporis umbræ.\"\r\n\r\nAncient geographers affirmed that the heat of the torrid zone was\r\nintolerable, that men and ships entering it would shrivel. This belt of\r\nconsuming heat presented an impenetrable barrier between the known and\r\nthe unknown.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that intellect was stunted, civilization dwarfed, restricted\r\nas was human knowledge to the narrow grave-like walls of western\r\nEurope! No sooner were these ancient boundaries burst, and the black and\r\ndreadful fog-banks which lay upon primeval ocean pierced, than fancy,\r\nlike a freed bird, bounded forth, swept the circumference of the earth,\r\nsoared aloft amid the stars, and dared even to ask of religion a reason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EUROPE AND AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nOne glance westward. On either side of an unswept sea, a Sea of Darkness\r\nit was called by those that feared it, there rested at the opening of\r\nthis history two fair continents, each unknown to the other. One was\r\ncultivated; its nations were well advanced in those arts and courtesies\r\nthat spring from accumulated experiences; the other, for the most part,\r\nunmarred by man, lay revelling in primeval beauty, fresh as from the\r\nCreator's hand. The leaven of progress working in one, brought to its\r\nknowledge the existence of the other; the Sea of Darkness with its\r\nuncouth monsters was turned into a highway, and civilized Europe stood\r\nface to face with sylvan America. This world newly found was called the\r\nNew World; though which is the new and which the old; which, if either,\r\npeopled the other, is yet undetermined. One in organism and in the\r\nnature human, the people of the two worlds were in color, customs, and\r\nsentiment several. The barbarous New World boasted its civilizations,\r\nwhile the civilized Old World disclosed its barbarisms; on Mexican\r\nand Peruvian highlands were nations of city-builders as far superior\r\nin culture to the islanders and coast-dwellers seen by Columbus, as\r\nwere the European discoverers superior to the American highlanders. Of\r\nprobable indigenous origin, this lesser civilization shows traces of\r\nhigh antiquity; even the ruder nations of the north leave far behind\r\nthem absolute primevalism.\r\n\r\nI do not say with some that in America were seen in certain directions\r\nmarks of as high culture as any in Europe. There were no such marks.\r\nBut this unquestionably is true; that, as in Europe, we here find that\r\nmost inexplicable of phenomena, the evolution of civility; man's mental\r\nand spiritual necessities, like his physical wants, appear everywhere\r\nthe same. The mind, like the body, craves nutriment, and the dimmed\r\nimprisoned soul a higher sympathy; hence we see men of every clime\r\nand color making for themselves gods, and contriving creeds which\r\nshall presently deliver them from their dilemma. The civilizations of\r\nAmerica, unlike well-rooted saplings of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, were\r\nsensitive-plants which collapsed upon the first foreign touch, leaving\r\nonly the blackness of darkness; hence it was the wild tribes, far more\r\nthan the cultivated nations, that influenced the character of subsequent\r\nAmerican societies.\r\n\r\nIn her civil and religious polities America was every whit as consistent\r\nas Europe. Neither was altogether perfect or wise; and we wonder at the\r\nblindness and stupidity of one as of the other. Although we could catch\r\nbut a glimpse of the Americans before they vanished, yet we might see\r\nthat intellect was not stationary, but growing, and that society was\r\ninstinct with intelligent and progressional activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE RELIGIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn their religions the Americans paralleled the rest of mankind. Every\r\nreligion derives its form and color from the mind of the worshippers,\r\nso that by their gods we may know them. From elevated natures emanate\r\nchaste and refined conceptions of the deity; from brutish natures coarse\r\nconceptions. Christianity is the highest and purest of all religions;\r\nbut if we study the moral precepts of the foremost American nations,\r\nwe shall see that in many respects they were not far behind, and were\r\nindeed in some instances in advance of Christianity. True, the Aztecs\r\npractised human sacrifice, with all its attendant horrors; but what were\r\nthe religious wars, the expulsion of Jews, the slaughter of Infidels,\r\nthe burning of heretics, but human sacrifice? Moreover, while we turn\r\nin horror from the sacrificial stone of the Aztecs, where the human\r\nvictims were treated as gods and whence their souls were sent direct\r\nto Paradise, yet we find among them little of that most infamous of\r\ncrimes—persecution for opinion's sake; nor yet do we read of their\r\ningenuity being taxed for the contrivance of engines of the most\r\nexcruciating torture, as we do in the history of Christianity. Tortures\r\nwhich, while killing the body, it was believed consigned the soul to\r\neternal agonies.\r\n\r\nThere was little in the social or political systems of Europe of which\r\nthe counterpart could not be found in America; indeed, the economical,\r\nsocial, and political condition of every civilization finds its\r\ncounterpart in every other civilization; and there were institutions\r\nthen existing in America at whose feet Europe might have sat with\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMERICAN ABORIGINALS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the wilder tribes we find prevalent the patriarchal state, with\r\nits hundreds of languages and theologies; a slight advance from which\r\nare those associations of families banded for safety, thus presenting a\r\nstate of society not unlike that of European feudalism. From this point,\r\nevery quality and grade of government presents itself until full-blown\r\nmonarchy is attained, where a sole sovereign becomes an emperor of\r\nnations with a state and severity equal to that of the most enlightened.\r\nThe government of the Nashua nations, which was monarchical and nearly\r\nabsolute, denotes no small progress from primordial patriarchy.\r\n\r\nLike their cousins of Spain and England, the sovereigns of Mexico had\r\ntheir elaborate palaces, with magnificent surroundings, their country\r\nresidence and their hunting-grounds, their botanical and zoological\r\ngardens, and their harems filled with the daughters of nobles, who\r\ndeemed it an honor to see them thus royally defiled. There were\r\naristocratic and knightly orders; nobles, plebeians, and slaves;\r\npontiffs and priesthoods; land tenures and taxation; seminaries of\r\nlearning, and systems of education, in which virtue was extolled and\r\nvice denounced; laws and law courts of various grades, and councils\r\nand tribunals of various kinds; military orders with drill, engineer\r\ncorps, arms, and fortifications; commerce, caravans, markets, merchants,\r\npedlers, and commercial fairs, with a credit system, and express and\r\npostal facilities.\r\n\r\nThey were not lacking in pleasures and amusements similar to those\r\nof the Europeans, such as feasts with professional jester, music,\r\ndancing; and after dinner the drama, national games, gymnastics, and\r\ngladiatorial combats. They were not without their intoxicating drink,\r\ndelighting in drunkenness while denouncing it. Their medical faculty and\r\nsystems of surgery they had, and their burial-men; also their literati,\r\nscholars, orators, and poets, with an arithmetical system, a calendar,\r\na knowledge of astronomy, hieroglyphic books, chronological records,\r\npublic libraries, and national archives.\r\n\r\nThe horoscope of infants was cast; the cross was lifted up; incense\r\nwas burned; baptism and circumcision were practised. Whence arose these\r\ncustoms so like those of their fellow-men across the Atlantic, whom they\r\nhad never seen or heard of?\r\n\r\nThe conquerors found all this when they entered the country. They\r\nexamined with admiration the manufactures of gold, silver, copper,\r\ntin, and lead, wrought to exquisite patterns with surprising skill.\r\nThey gazed with astonishment on huge architectural piles, on monumental\r\nremains speaking louder than words; on temples, causeways, fountains,\r\naqueducts, and light-houses, surrounded as they were with statues and\r\nintricate and costly stone carvings. They found that the Americans made\r\ncloth, paper, pottery, and dyes, and were proficient in painting. Their\r\nmosaic feather-work was a marvel.\r\n\r\nThere are many points of interest, well worth examination, which I have\r\nnot space here properly to mention. The interested reader, however, will\r\nfind all material necessary to careful comparison in my _Native Races of\r\nthe Pacific States_. He will there find described conditions of society\r\nanalogous to feudalism and chivalry; he will find municipal governments,\r\nwalled towns, and standing armies. There were legislative assemblies\r\nsimilar to that of the Cortes, and associations not unlike that of the\r\nHoly Brotherhood. To say that trial by combat sometimes occurred is\r\naffirming of them nothing complimentary; but upon the absence of some\r\nEuropean institutions they were to be congratulated.\r\n\r\nAlthough living lives of easy poverty, the wild tribes of America\r\neverywhere possessed dormant wealth enough to tempt the cupidity alike\r\nof the fierce Spaniard, the blithe Frenchman, and the sombre Englishman.\r\nUnder a burning tropical sun, where neither meat nor clothing was\r\nessential to comfort, the land yielded gold, while in hyperborean\r\nforests where no precious metals were discovered the richest peltries\r\nabounded; so that no savage in all this northern continent was found so\r\npoor that grasping civilization could find nothing to rob him of.\r\n\r\nWhen Europe undertook the mastery of America, she found the people, as a\r\nrule, ready to be friendly. Some at first were startled into the seizure\r\nof their arms, the first impulse of the wild man on meeting anything\r\nstrange being to defend himself. But their fears were easily allayed,\r\ntheir confidence easily gained, and their pledges of good faith were\r\nusually to be depended upon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE CHARACTERISTICS.]\r\n\r\nThe variations between them and their brethren across the Atlantic\r\nwere less of kind than of quality. They were more children than wild\r\nbeasts. Physically they were complete, but mentally they were not fully\r\ndeveloped. Their minds were not so broad, nor so strong or subtle as\r\nthose of white men. Their cunning partook more of brute instinct than\r\nof civilized artifice. There was mind-power enough, but it lacked shape\r\nand consistency. They were naturally no more blood-thirsty, or cruel, or\r\nsuperstitious than their conquerors, but their cruelty and superstitions\r\nwere of coarser, cruder forms. The American aboriginal character has\r\nbeen greatly misconstrued, and is to-day but imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference, or cause of difference, between the people\r\nof Europe and the more advanced nations of America, it seems to me,\r\nlay in the ignorance of some few things, apparently insignificant in\r\nthemselves, yet mighty enough to revolutionize Christendom; such as the\r\nuse of iron, gunpowder, and movable types. The absence of horses, and\r\nother of the more useful domestic animals, was also a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nAfter reading of the Europeans of that day it is irony to call the\r\nAmericans revengeful or cruel. Where is it possible to find more\r\nstrongly developed those qualities which civilization most condemns\r\nthan among civilized nations—the same, only refined? So blind are we to\r\nour own faults, so quick to see and condemn the faults of our weak and\r\ndefenceless neighbor!\r\n\r\nCatalogue crime and place the white beside the red. Seldom was the\r\nIndian treacherous until he had been deceived. The Indians tortured\r\ntheir prisoners; so did the white men, hunting them with bloodhounds,\r\nenslaving them, branding them with hot irons, beating and roasting them,\r\nmaking them work in the mines until death relieved them by thousands,\r\nbutchering wives and children because the husband and father dared\r\nstrike a blow in their defence. It is well to call them brutal in\r\nwarfare when the white man so quickly adopts their most brutal customs;\r\nit is well to call them beasts of prey, when the white man crosses the\r\nocean to prey upon those very beasts which he pretends to slur.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Indians, it has become the custom wilfully to\r\nmisapply terms. If a tribe resist an injury, it is called an outbreak;\r\nif successful in war, it is a massacre; if successful in single combat,\r\nit is a murder. Thus soldiers speak to cover the disgrace of defeat,\r\nand thus reports are made by men who regard not decency in speaking\r\nof a savage, to say nothing of fairness. It is enough that we have\r\nexterminated this people, without attempting to malign them and exalt\r\nour own baseness. What should we do were a foreign power to come in\r\nships to our shore and begin to slaughter our animals, to stake off our\r\nland and divide it among themselves? We should drive them away if we\r\nwere able; but if we found them the stronger, we should employ every art\r\nto destroy them, and in so doing regard ourselves as patriots performing\r\na sacred obligation. This is the Indians crime; and in so doing we\r\ncall him cunning, revengeful, hateful, diabolical. But the white man\r\nbrings him blankets, it may be said, brings him medicine, tells him of\r\ncontrivances, teaches him civilization. These things are exactly what\r\nthe savage does not want, and what he is much better off without. The\r\nwhite man's comforts kill him almost as quickly as do his cruelties; and\r\nthe teachings of Christ's ministers are abhorrent if they are coupled\r\nwith the examples of lecherous and murderous professors of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were by no means all that white men gave the Indian.\r\nWe might enumerate alcohol, small-pox, measles, syphilis, and a dozen\r\nother disgusting adjuncts of civilization of which the savage before\r\nknew nothing. Can savagism boast greater achievements? White men have\r\nkilled fifty Indians where Indians have killed one white man, and\r\nthis, notwithstanding that nine tenths of all injuries inflicted have\r\nbeen perpetrated by white invaders. A thousand Indian women have been\r\noutraged by men whose mothers had taught them the Lord's prayer, where\r\none white woman has been injured by these benighted heathen. At any\r\ntime in the history of America I would rather take my chances as a white\r\nwoman among savages, than as an Indian woman among white people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIGNIFICATIONS OF PROGRESS.]\r\n\r\nBrethren by procreation, but by destiny foes, as we behold them there\r\nthe so-called New and Old thus so strangely brought together, naturally\r\nenough we ask ourselves, Whence came the one, and whither tends the\r\nother? Whence came these dusky denizens of the forest, and for how many\r\nthousands of ages has the feeble light of their intelligence struggled\r\nwith the darkness, dimly flickering, now gathering strength, now falling\r\nback into dense obscurity; how long and in what manner has the divine\r\nspark thus wrestled with its environment? And whither tends this fierce\r\nflame of human advancement which just now bursts its ancient boundaries,\r\nsweeps across the Sea of Darkness, absorbs all lesser lights, and\r\ndazzles and consumes a hemisphere of souls? More especially, when we\r\nlook back toward what we are accustomed to call the beginning, and mark\r\nthe steady advance of knowledge, the ever-increasing power of mind;\r\nwhen we consider the progress of even the last half century, and listen\r\nto the present din and clatter of improvement, do we raise our eyes\r\nto the future and ask, Whither tends all this? Whither tends with so\r\nrapidly accelerating swiftness this self-begetting of enlightenment,\r\nthis massing of human acquirements; whither tends this perpetually\r\nincreasing domination of the intellectual over the material? Within the\r\npast few thousand years we have seen our race emerge from barbarism,\r\nand notwithstanding the inherent tendency to evil ever present in\r\nour natures, we have seen mankind put on civilization and accept for\r\ntheir faith Christianity, the purest and highest type of religion.\r\nWe have seen nations cease somewhat their hereditary growlings, and\r\nbrutal blood-sheddings, and mingle as brethren; we have seen wavy grain\r\nsupplant the tangled wildwood, gardens materialize from the mirage,\r\nand magnificent cities rise out of the rocky ground. Thus we have seen\r\nthe whole earth placed under tribute, and this mysterious reasoning\r\nintelligence of ours elevating itself yet more and more above the\r\ninstincts of the brute, and asserting its dominion over nature; belting\r\nthe earth with an impatient energy, which now presses outward from every\r\nmeridian, widening its domain as best it may toward the north and toward\r\nthe south, building equatorial fires under polar icebergs. All this and\r\nmore from the records of our race we have seen accomplished, and yet do\r\nsee it; civilization working itself out in accordance with the eternal\r\npurposes of Omnipotence, unfolding under man's agency, yet independent\r\nof man's will; a subtile, extraneous, unifying energy, stimulated by\r\nagencies good not more than by agencies evil, yet always tending in its\r\nresults to good rather than to evil; an influence beyond the reach or\r\ncognizance of man, working in and round persons and societies, turning\r\nand overturning, now clouding the sky with blackness and dropping\r\ndisorder on floundering humanity, but only to be followed by a yet\r\nmore fertilizing sunshine; laying waste and building up, building up by\r\nlaying waste, civilizing as well by war and avarice as by good-will and\r\nsweet charity, civilizing as surely, if not as rapidly, with the world\r\nof humanity struggling against it, as with the same human world laboring\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nSlowly rattles along the dim present, well-nigh buried in its own dust;\r\nit is only the past that is well-defined and clear to history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE AND DISCOVERY FROM THE EARLIEST\r\nRECORDS TO THE YEAR 1540.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the narration of events composing this history,\r\nit seems to me important, in order as well properly to appreciate the\r\nforegoing Introduction as to gain from succeeding chapters something\r\nmore than gratified curiosity, that an exposition of Early Voyages\r\nshould be given,—acting powerfully as they did on evolving thought and\r\nmaterial development, giving breadth and vigor to intellect, enthusiasm\r\nto enterprise, and in elevating and stimulating that commercial spirit\r\nwhich was eventually to depose kings, exalt the people, strip from\r\nscience its superstitions, from religion its cabalistic forms, and by\r\nits associations, its negotiations, its adventurous daring, its wars,\r\nits alliances, and its humanizing polities, to break the barriers of\r\nancient enmity and bring together in common brotherhood all the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I now propose to give a chronological statement of every\r\nauthentic voyage of discovery made beyond the Mediterranean prior to\r\n1540, while doubtful and disputed voyages will be discussed according\r\nto their relative importance. I shall notice, moreover, such books and\r\ncharts relating to America as were produced during this period, with\r\nfac-similes of the more important maps, to illustrate, at different\r\ndates, the progress of discovery. It is my purpose, so far as possible,\r\nin the very limited space allowed, to state fairly the conclusions of\r\nthe best writers on every important point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne word as to the authorities consulted in the preparation of this\r\nSummary. Of books relating to America, published prior to 1540, there\r\nare in all about sixty-five; only twenty-five, however, contain original\r\ninformation; twenty-three are general cosmographical works with brief\r\nsections on America compiled from the original twenty-five; while\r\nseventeen merely mention the New World or its discoveries, and are\r\ntherefore of no value in this connection. Of the forty-eight containing\r\nmatter more or less important, there are over two hundred editions, the\r\nearliest of which only, in most instances, will be mentioned, and that\r\nwithout extensive bibliographical notes. These books and charts I notice\r\nin chronological order under dates of their successive appearance.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Early Voyages has been so frequently and so thoroughly\r\ndiscussed by able modern writers that it is unnecessary, and indeed\r\nimpracticable in so condensed an essay, to refer to ancient authorities\r\nalone, and prove everything from the beginning. I shall therefore,\r\nbesides the Spanish historians Peter Martyr, Oviedo, Las Casas,\r\nGomara, Herrera, and the standard collections of Ramusio, Grynæus,\r\nPurchas, and Hakluyt, freely use the works of later writers according\r\nto their relative worth. And of these last mentioned I epitomize\r\nthe following. _Historia del Nuevo-Mundo, escribíala D. Juan Baut.\r\nMuñoz_, tom. i.—all ever published—_En Madrid_, 1793, contains a\r\nclear well-written _prologo_, or essay, on the first three voyages of\r\nColumbus with minor mention of contemporary discoveries. An account\r\nis also given of the author's labors in beginning the large and\r\ninvaluable collection of documents completed and published by Martin\r\nFernandez de Navarrete, _Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos que\r\nhicieron por mar los Españoles desde fines del siglo XV._, 5 vols. 4to,\r\nMadrid, 1825-37. This collection of Navarrete's is without doubt the\r\nmost valuable work on the subject of early American voyages, and the\r\nfoundation of all that followed; containing as it does the original\r\nSpanish, Latin, and Portuguese texts of the more important Spanish\r\nand Portuguese expeditions from 1393 to 1540—the Latin and Portuguese\r\ndone into Spanish—together with over five hundred original documents\r\nfrom the Spanish archives, with extensive and generally impartial\r\nnotes by the editor. For a biographical sketch of this author see\r\nchapter iii. of this volume. Washington Irving's _Life and Voyages\r\nof Christopher Columbus and his Companions_, published in London,\r\n1828-31 (edition used, that of New York, 1869, 3 vols.), is an able and\r\nelegant abridged translation of Navarrete, and of _La Historia de el\r\nAlmirante D. Christoval Colon_, by his son Fernando Colon, in _Barcia_,\r\n_Historiadores Primitivos_, tom. i., Madrid, 1749. Alexander von\r\nHumboldt's _Examen critique de l'histoire de la Géographie du nouveau\r\ncontinent, et des progrès de l'astronomie nautique aux 15ème et 16ème\r\nSiècles_, 5 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1836-9, is a most exhaustive digest of\r\nmaterials furnished by Navarrete and the older historians, illustrated\r\nwith the results of the author's personal investigations. The work\r\nembraces two treatises; first, the causes which led to the discovery of\r\nAmerica; second, facts relating to Columbus and Vespucci, with the dates\r\nof geographic discoveries. Humboldt's _Abhandlung über die ältesten\r\nKarten_, printed as an introduction to _Ghillany_, _Geschichte des\r\nSeefahrers Ritter Martin Behaim_, Nuremberg, 1853, of which I have only\r\na manuscript English translation, is an essay as well on the naming of\r\nAmerica as on early maps. Another important treatise is that of J. G.\r\nKohl, _Die beiden ältesten General-Karten von America_, Weimar, 1860,\r\nof nearly two hundred large folio pages on the earliest manuscript and\r\nprinted maps, two of the former, dated 1527 and 1529, accompanying the\r\nwork, reproduced in chromo-lithographic fac-simile. The same author\r\nhas produced other works on the subject, the most important being _A\r\nHistory of the Discovery of the East Coast of North America, published\r\nin Collections of the Maine Historical Society_, 2d series, vol. i.,\r\nPortland, 1869. This contains reduced copies of twenty-three early\r\nmaps, and is perhaps the most complete work existing, so far as the\r\nnorthern coasts are concerned, giving comparatively little attention to\r\nmore southern voyages. _Kunstmann_, _Die Entdeckung Amerikas_, Munich,\r\n1859, is a careful compilation of ninety-six imperial quarto pages,\r\nwith copious notes and references, written to accompany a collection\r\nof thirteen large chromo-lithographic reproductions of manuscript\r\nmaps preserved in the Academy of Sciences at Munich, and generally\r\nknown as the _Munich Atlas_. Herr Kunstmann treats chiefly of the\r\nAtlantic islands, with special reference to the connection between the\r\ndiscoveries of Spaniards and Northmen. _Major's Life of Prince Henry of\r\nPortugal_, London, 1868, is the best authority for Portuguese voyages as\r\nwell as for the revival of maritime enterprise in the fifteenth century.\r\n_Stevens' Historical and Geographical Notes on the Earliest Discoveries\r\nin America, 1453-1530_, New Haven, 1869, was written originally as\r\nan introduction to a book by the author's brother on his proposed\r\ninteroceanic communication via Tehuantepec. It is a concise statement\r\nof the whole matter, presenting some of its phases in a practically new\r\nlight. _Varnhagen_, _Le Premier Voyage de Amerigo Vespucci_, Vienna,\r\n1869, must not be omitted as the chief support of a theory on Vespucci's\r\nvoyages which nearly concerns the first discovery of our Pacific States\r\nterritory proper. _Rafn_, _Antiquitates Americanæ_, Hafniæ, 1837, is the\r\nsource of nearly all our knowledge of the discoveries of the Northmen\r\nin America in the tenth and following centuries; and _De Costa_, _The\r\nPre-Columbian Discovery of America_, Albany, 1868, presents an English\r\ntranslation of the same Icelandic _sagas_ in which the enterprises\r\nof the Northmen are recorded. The _Cartografía Mexicana_ of Orozco y\r\nBerra, published by the Mexican Geographical Society, contains, as its\r\ntitle indicates, a mention of early maps in chronologic order; and the\r\n_Mapoteca Colombiana_ of Urricœchea, London, 1860, is another important\r\ncontribution of similar nature. There should be mentioned the excellent\r\nreview given in the first volume of _Bryant's History of the United\r\nStates_, which has appeared since this Summary was written; and I might\r\npresent quite a list of papers read before the various learned societies\r\nof Europe and America on different topics connected with this subject in\r\nlate years, none of them I believe materially affecting my conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe above form but a small portion of the works devoted wholly or in\r\npart to the subject, but they are believed to contain all the material\r\nnecessary for even a more detailed statement than my purpose demands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVENTURES OF THE ANCIENTS.]\r\n\r\nOf the voyages of the ancients, properly so called, that is, of such as\r\npreceded the fall of the Roman Empire at the end of the fourth century,\r\nI shall here say little. These maritime expeditions, confined for the\r\nmost part to the Mediterranean, though extending for some distance\r\nalong the coasts of the Indian and Atlantic oceans, with occasional\r\nvoyages designedly or accidentally prolonged to more distant islands,\r\nand it may be continents, come down to us through antique histories,\r\ncosmographies, and poems, so mixed with vague hypothetical and\r\nmythological conceptions, that the most searching investigation is often\r\nunable to separate fact from fable. There are multitudes of classic\r\nand mediæval legends adopted by Tasso, Pulci, and other Italian poets,\r\nsuch, for example, as that which makes the Greek wanderer Ulysses the\r\npioneer of western adventure, which in a sober treatise are scarcely\r\nworthy of mention. Turning to the dawn his vessel's poop, this son of\r\nLaertes, it is said, passed Gibraltar, the bound ordained by Hercules\r\nnot to be overstepped by man, and, as Dante tells us, sailed for the\r\nHappy Isles of the unknown Atlantic, unrestrained by son, or father, or\r\neven Penelope's ever-weaving web of love.\r\n\r\nA little journey was a wonderful exploit before the time of\r\nChrist—instance the immortal fame achieved by Hanno, the Carthaginian,\r\nin visiting the west coast of Africa, B. C. 570; by Herodotus, in making\r\nthe excursion of Egypt and India, B. C. 464-456; by Pytheas, in his\r\nvoyage to the British Isles, B. C. 340; by Nearchus, in descending the\r\nIndus, B. C. 326; by Eudoxus, in his attempt to sail round Africa, B.\r\nC. 130; by Cæsar, in undertaking the conquest of Gaul, B. C. 58; by\r\nStrabo, in penetrating Asia some thirty or forty years later. After\r\nthe Christian era Pausanias, a Roman, in 175 wrote a guide-book of\r\nGreece; Fa Hian, a Chinese monk, went westward into India in the year\r\n400 or thereabout; Cosmas Indicopleustes travelled in India a century\r\nand a half later and wrote a book to prove the world square, and the\r\nuniverse an oblong coffer; Arculphe wrote of the Holy Land about 650; an\r\nEnglishman, Willibald, made the tour of southern Europe and Palestine,\r\nsetting out from Southampton in 721; in 851 went Soliman from Persia to\r\nthe China sea. So it has been said.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the writings of Herodotus indicate that, over two thousand years\r\nbefore Dias and Vasco da Gama, Africa was circumnavigated by a fleet of\r\nPhœnician ships sent by Pharaoh Necho down the Red Sea with orders to\r\nreturn to Egypt by way of the Pillars of Hercules. A Persian, Sataspes,\r\nendeavored to accomplish the voyage from the other direction, but\r\nfailed. Plato's island of Atlantis, founded by the god Neptune, was of\r\ngreat size, \"larger than Asia and Libya together, and was situated over\r\nagainst the straits now called the Pillars of Hercules.\" The climate\r\nand soil were so good that fruits ripened twice every year. There were\r\nmetals, with elephants and other animals in abundance. Upon a mountain\r\nwas a beautiful city with gold and ivory palaces, having gardens and\r\nstatues. Unfortunately in time the sea swallowed up this island, so that\r\nit could scarcely have been America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROPHECY OF QUETZALCOATL.]\r\n\r\nSo far as these voyages and strange tales concern the possible knowledge\r\nof America by the ancients, I have already discussed them in my _Native\r\nRaces of the Pacific States_. Therein is mentioned a theory which has\r\nfound many advocates, and to which I will again briefly allude in this\r\nplace. It is that at the beginning of the Christian era America was\r\nvisited by the Apostle St Thomas. He was accompanied by a number of\r\nfellow-laborers in the ministry, who preached the gospel and planted\r\nthe Christian religion in America. The theory is ably advocated in the\r\nexcellent work of Rev. W. Gleeson, _The History of the Catholic Church\r\nin California_. The principal arguments advanced may be briefly stated\r\nas follows: First, that the whole tenor of Scripture teaching is in\r\nfavor of the supposition that the gospel was preached to all the world\r\nfrom the beginning, rather than after the lapse of several centuries.\r\nSecond, that at a date fixed by Mexican hieroglyphics as a little before\r\nthe middle of the first century after Christ, a celebrated personage,\r\ncertainly the most remarkable in Mexican mythology, came from the north.\r\nHe is represented as a white man, with flowing beard, clad in a long\r\nwhite robe, adorned with red crosses, head uncovered, and a staff in his\r\nhand. This was the Quetzalcoatl, whom the Mexicans afterward worshipped,\r\nand whose return was so anxiously looked for by them. See _Torquemada_,\r\n_Monarq. Ind._ Third, that to him popular tradition ascribes the worship\r\npaid to the cross, the practice of confession, and in a word all the\r\ncustoms found on the arrival of the Spaniards to be nearly identical\r\nwith those of the Christian religion. _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. de Mexico_.\r\nFourth, that the name Quetzalcoatl is synonymous with that of St Thomas.\r\nSee _Native Races_, v. 26. Fifth, that Quetzalcoatl promised on his\r\ndeparture to return at some future day with his posterity and resume\r\nthe possession of the empire, and that day was looked forward to with\r\ngeneral confidence, _Prescott's Conq. Mex._, and that a general feeling\r\nprevailed at the time of Montezuma that the period of his return had\r\narrived. _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Mex._ Sixth, that there were at the\r\nconvent of Nijapa, in the province of Oajaca, hieroglyphs containing\r\nall the principal doctrines of the Christian religion, and the coming\r\nof the Apostle to the country. _Id._\r\n\r\nSahagun, who wrote at the time of the conquest, speaks of the general\r\nbelief in this prophecy, and assures us that on the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards they repeatedly offered them divine honors, believing that\r\ntheir god Quetzalcoatl had returned. _Conq. Mex._, i. chap. iii.\r\n\r\n\"It is then undeniably true,\" says Gleeson, _Catholic Church in Cal._,\r\n185, \"that a popular tradition existed in the country respecting a\r\nprophecy made by Quetzalcohuatl, in which was foretold the future\r\narrival of whites on the coast; and this, while it proves the reality\r\nof the man, and his character as a teacher of religion, also proves the\r\nstill more important and appreciable fact of his being a Christian, and\r\nof western origin; for, it was clearly set forth in the prophecy, that\r\nthe persons who should come would be whites, and of the same religion\r\nas he. The time also seems to have been specified by the Apostle, if\r\nwe are to judge by the expression that they were expecting him every\r\nday. And, indeed, Boturini assures us that the time mentioned in the\r\nMexican hieroglyphics was that in which the Christians arrived. The year\r\n_ce acatl_ was that foretold by Quetzalcohuatl, and in that year the\r\nSpaniards landed in the Country.\" On ancient voyages and cosmography\r\nsee also Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp. 125-206.\r\n\r\nIt is the results of ancient voyages, the point of geographical\r\nknowledge attained by ancient civilization in its most advanced stage\r\nand by it bequeathed to the Dark Age, and not the voyages themselves,\r\nwith which we have to do at present. This knowledge is found for the\r\nmost part embodied in the system of Ptolemy, the Alexandrian geographer\r\nof the second century, whose works became the standard text-books, and\r\nholding their prominence for fourteen hundred years were not superseded\r\nas late as the sixteenth century, but were republished from time to\r\ntime, with additions, setting forth the results of new discoveries. In\r\nthis manner twenty-one editions appeared during the first half of that\r\ncentury. Nor was even Ptolemy the originator of this prolonged system.\r\nOne hundred and fifty years before him was the Greek geographer Strabo,\r\nwho gave descriptions of countries and peoples, fixing his localities\r\nusually by itinerary distances; and to this work of Strabo's, Ptolemy\r\nadded a century and a half of progress, and determined his localities\r\nby astronomical observation. The work of Pomponius Mela, the Roman\r\ngeographer who wrote probably somewhat later than Strabo, is regarded\r\nas no improvement on that of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nPtolemy's World was nearly all in the north temperate zone, embracing\r\nabout fifty degrees of latitude and one hundred and twenty of longitude.\r\nThe Fortunate Isles, now called the Canaries, were known to Ptolemy, and\r\nby him used as a western limit or first meridian. This, and as a nucleus\r\nof poetic myths, seem to have been their only use; as Muñoz says,\r\n_Hist. del Nuevo Mundo_, p. 30: \"Fuera de este uso apenas aprovecharon\r\nsino para entretenir ociosas imaginaciones con fábulas de poetas.\"\r\nThe eastern limit was vaguely located in the region beyond the Ganges;\r\nactually in about 100° east longitude. On the south were included the\r\nAfrican coasts of the Mediterranean and Red Sea, with the southern\r\ncoasts of Arabia and India proper—the term India being then applied\r\nindefinitely to all eastern lands, including even parts of Africa—thus\r\nfixing the southern bound at about 30° north latitude in the west, and\r\n10° in the east. Northward the limit may be placed a little above 60°,\r\nwithin which falls the southern part of the Scandinavian peninsula, then\r\nsupposed to be an island, and also the island of Thule, the location\r\nof which is disputed, some claiming it to have been Iceland, others the\r\nFaroe Islands, and others the Shetland Islands. But Ptolemy's latitudes\r\nwere all some ten degrees too far north, while in his longitudes he\r\nwent still further astray; since, reckoning from the Canaries as his\r\nfirst meridian, he made his last meridian 180°, when it should have been\r\n120°, and thus by narrowing half the circumference of the globe some\r\nsixty degrees he made the world nearly one third less than it really\r\nis. Authorities differ, however, as to what were Ptolemy's ideas. But\r\nmore of this hereafter. On the opposite page is a map in which the world\r\nas known in these times is left white, the shaded portions being the\r\nresult of subsequent discoveries down to the last half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. A map of Ptolemy's World, reduced to its true proportions,\r\nmay be seen in _Goselin_, _Recherches sur la géographie systématique et\r\npositive des anciens_, tom. iv., Paris, 1813.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WORLD; THE WHITE PART AS KNOWN AT THE END OF THE\r\n   FOURTH CENTURY, THE LIGHTLY SHADED PORTIONS AS KNOWN AT THE END OF\r\n   THE FIFTEENTH.]\r\n\r\nWithin these limits, then, geographical knowledge was confined at the\r\nend of the fourth century; limits not sharply defined, but indefinite\r\nand wavering according to ages, to the directions of conquest, and to\r\ndistances from Mediterranean centres. Beyond these limits was a realm\r\nof darkness peopled by strange beings, creatures of poetic fancy or\r\ncrude conjecture. Just as the wonder-land of Homer to contemporaneous\r\neastern Greeks, was Italy, with its strange waters inhabited by very\r\nstrange beasts, and Sicily, and neighboring isles, where were the\r\nSatyrs, and the gigantic one-eyed Cyclops eating milk and mutton and\r\nmen, so to later teachers were the strange seas beyond. On the north was\r\nan impenetrable region of eternal ice; on the south, an equatorial zone\r\nof burning heat; a barrier of frost on the one side and of fire on the\r\nother, both equally uninhabitable to the European man, and cutting off\r\nall communication with possible habitable lands elsewhere. The burning\r\nzone, however, seems to have been a popular idea, rather than a part of\r\nthe system taught by Ptolemy, who, indeed, held that Africa extended\r\nsouth-east and north-east toward the eastern parts of Asia, making of\r\nthe Indian Ocean an immense gulf not connected with the Atlantic on\r\nthe west. Strabo and other geographers who preceded Ptolemy gave Africa\r\napproximately its correct shape; traditions of its circumnavigation even\r\nwere kept alive, in spite of Ptolemy's theory, influencing geographic\r\nthought not a little during the fifteenth century. Irving is of opinion,\r\n_Columbus_, vol. iii. p. 440, that modern authors consider the knowledge\r\nof the ancients concerning Africa much less extensive than has been\r\ngenerally supposed; but Major, _Prince Henry_, p. 89 et seq., accepts\r\na circumnavigation of Africa in the seventh century B. C., and also\r\nHanno's voyage far down the African coast, placing the date of the\r\nlatter 570 B. C. Among the philosophers of western Europe no definite\r\nhypotheses appear to have been advanced as to the extent of land beyond\r\nthe known region; as to the ideas of the Arabs and Buddhist priests\r\nconcerning the matter it is difficult to determine. See _Kohl's Hist.\r\nDiscov._, p. 149; _Draper's Intellectual Development_, p. 451, New\r\nYork, 1872. Beyond the Fortunate Isles to the west stretched a _Mare\r\nTenebrosum_, or Sea of Darkness, as early writers express it, separating\r\nthe known western coast from the far unknown east. In this dark sea\r\ntradition planted islands at various points, reiterating the fact of\r\ntheir existence so often that names and locations were finally given\r\nthem on maps, though the islands themselves have never yet been found.\r\nExcept these fabulous islands, there was little thought of land between\r\nthe coasts of Europe and Asia. Compare maps in this volume; also _George\r\nBancroft's History of the United States_, vol. i. p. 6, Boston, 1870;\r\n_D'Avesac_, in _Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_, 1845, tom. cv. p. 293;\r\ntom. cvi. p. 47.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the geographical knowledge of the ancients, we have first,\r\nthe sphericity of the earth surmised, although its size was vaguely\r\nconceived and underrated; secondly, the positive knowledge of Europeans\r\nlimited to the unshaded portion of the map on page 73; thirdly, divers\r\ntheories respecting the conformation of southern Africa; fourthly,\r\na _mare oceanum_ stretching westward to the unknown Asiatic shore,\r\nwith hypothetical islands intervening, and expressed opinions that\r\nthis sea was navigable, and that possibly India might be reached by\r\nsailing westward. These ideas, vague as they seem, were held only by\r\nthe learned few; the world of the ignorant reached scarcely beyond the\r\nhorizon of their actual experience. Not until long after its actual\r\ncircumnavigation, in the sixteenth century, was the popular mind able\r\nto grasp the idea of the earth's sphericity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come now to mediæval times, when from the fifth to the fifteenth\r\ncentury the cosmographical as well as all other knowledge of the\r\nancients lay well-nigh dormant; to the people a land of darkness as\r\nwell as a sea, though in some few colleges and convents these things\r\nwere thought of. \"Ces ténèbres,\" says Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom.\r\ni. p. 59, \"s'étendaient sans doute sur les masses; mais, dans les\r\ncouvens et les colléges quelques individus conservaient les traditions\r\nde l'antiquité.\" Upon this world of darkness light first broke from\r\nthe far north, the voyages of the Scandinavians from the ninth to the\r\ntwelfth centuries being the _aurora borealis_ of maritime discovery.\r\nThese Northmen, as in their expeditions Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes\r\nwere indiscriminately called, by their warlike propensities made\r\nthemselves known and feared along the shores of Europe at an early\r\ndate; but their western discoveries were known only to themselves; at\r\nall events, no trace of distant voyages to the west are found in the\r\nrecords of their neighbors. It is only quite recently that the sagas\r\nof the Northmen were brought to the attention of European scholars;\r\nand when the Danish bishop, Müller, published his bibliography of the\r\nsagas, 3 vols., Copenhagen, 1817-1820, these narratives were held to\r\nbe more fiction than fact. Even so late a writer as George Bancroft,\r\n_History of the United States_, vol. i. pp. 5, 6, says that the story\r\nof colonization by the Northmen \"rests on narratives, mythological in\r\nform, and obscure in meaning; ancient, yet not contemporary,\" and that\r\n\"no clear historic evidence establishes the natural probability that\r\nthey accomplished the passage.\" Irving, _Columbus_, vol. iii. pp. 432-5,\r\nconsiders the matter \"still to be wrapped in much doubt and obscurity.\"\r\nBoth of these authors, however, seem to have considered only the\r\nevidence presented by Malte-Brun and Forster. Since their time proofs\r\nbeyond question have established the authenticity of these voyages of\r\nthe Northmen. The sagas on American discoveries are preserved in the\r\narchives at Copenhagen, with a collection of other historical data,\r\nreaching down to the fourteenth century, the date of their completion.\r\nIt is true that they deal somewhat in the marvellous—they would not\r\nbe authentic else, written at that time—but they contain tales no more\r\nwonderful or monstrous than the writings of more southern nations. See\r\nan account of the Copenhagen documents and the examination of their\r\nauthenticity in _De Costa's Pre-Columbian Discov. Am._, pp. i-lx. Two\r\nnearly contemporary ecclesiastical histories—that of Adam of Bremen,\r\n1073, and Ordericus Vitalis, about 1100—describe briefly the western\r\nlands of the Northmen. Further reference, _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._,\r\np. 32; _Rafn_, _Antiquitates Am._, p. 337; _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, p.\r\n76.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NORTHMEN AND THEIR SAGAS.]\r\n\r\nVague notions were not wanting of communication with America before the\r\ntime of the Northmen, but these, whatever they were, are now to us pure\r\nspeculation and may be omitted here. Passing over a general movement\r\nby which before the middle of the ninth century the Northmen appear\r\nto have broken through their former bounds, and to have extended their\r\nplundering raids in all directions, taking possession of the Shetland\r\nand Faroe islands and even of the north of Britain, we come to the first\r\ndefinite adventure westward.\r\n\r\n[A. D. 860-4.] Two bold men, Naddod and Gardar, in one of their\r\ncoast-island cruises, were driven from their course to the north-west\r\nand discovered Iceland, called by one Snowland, and by the other Gardar\r\nIsland. Kohl, _Hist. Discov._, p. 61, dates both voyages 860; Forster\r\ngives 861 to Naddod's; other authors place the former in the year 860,\r\nand the latter in 864.\r\n\r\n[874.] Ingolf made a settlement in Iceland at a point still called\r\nby his name. Other immigrants followed, and a flourishing colony was\r\nfounded. The Northmen found on the island Irish priests, who had come\r\nthere at a time not definitely known, but who immediately abandoned\r\nthe country to the new settlers. Within twenty years thereafter Iceland\r\nwas fairly well inhabited. De Costa, _Pre-Columbian Discov. Am._, pp.\r\nxxii-iv., makes the date A. D. 875.\r\n\r\n[876.] One Gunnbjörn, an Icelandic colonist, is reported to have seen\r\naccidentally, from a distance, the coast of Greenland. Kohl dates this\r\nvoyage 877.\r\n\r\n[982-6.] Eric the Red, banished from Iceland for murder in 982, sailed\r\nwest, found land, remained there three years, and returned, naming the\r\ncountry Greenland to attract settlers. In 985, or 986, he sailed again\r\nwith a larger force, this time founding a settlement to which other\r\nadventurers resorted. Of the first voyage Kohl makes no mention.\r\n\r\n[983.] One of the sagas contains a report by an Irish merchant that one\r\nAre Marson was carried in a storm to Whiteman's Land \"in the Western\r\nOcean, opposite Vinland, six days' sail west of Ireland.\" Rafn thinks\r\nthis may have been that part of America in the vicinity of Florida;\r\nothers make it the Azores. There are also vague reports of later voyages\r\nto the same land by Björn Asbrandson in 999, and by Gudleif in 1027.\r\nIn the present stage of investigation the proof is insufficient to\r\nestablish an Irish pre-Scandinavian discovery of America.\r\n\r\n[990.] In this year, or, as De Costa makes it, in 986, Biarne, sailing\r\nfrom Iceland in search of his father, who had previously gone to\r\nGreenland, was carried far to the south-west, to within sight of land,\r\nundoubtedly America, which he coasted north-east for several days and\r\nreturned to Greenland. Three points particularly noticed on the new\r\ncoast are conjectured by Kohl to have been Cape Cod, Nova Scotia, and\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\n[1000.] Leif, son of Eric the Red, sailed from Greenland south-west in\r\nsearch of the lands seen by Biarne, reached the same in reverse order,\r\nlanding probably at Newfoundland, which he named Helluland (Stony\r\nLand); Nova Scotia, he called Markland (Woodland); and passing round\r\nCape Cod, made a settlement, named after himself, Leifsbudir, at some\r\npoint on Narragansett Bay. He called this country Vinland from the fact\r\nthat vines were found there, and the name was afterwards applied to the\r\nwhole region extending northward to Markland. In the spring of 1001 Leif\r\nreturned to Greenland with a cargo of grapes and wood.\r\n\r\n[1002-5.] Thorwald, another of Eric's sons, sailed with one vessel to\r\nVinland, where Leif had landed, and lived there through the winter by\r\nfishing. Early in 1003 he explored the country westward in boats, and in\r\nthe spring of 1004 doubled Cape Cod, naming it Kialarnes (Ship's Nose),\r\nand perished in a battle with the Skraellings, or Indians, at some point\r\non the shore of Massachusetts Bay. His companions spent the winter at\r\nLeifsbudir and returned to Greenland in 1005.\r\n\r\n[1008.] In the spring of 1008 Thorfinn Karlsefne sailed from Greenland\r\nwith three vessels to Helluland—which name was applied not only to\r\nNewfoundland but to the region north of that point—and thence along the\r\ncoast to Nova Scotia, and to Cape Cod. Here the party divided, Thorhall,\r\nthe hunter, in attempting to explore northward, being driven by a\r\nstorm to Ireland, while Thorfinn spent the winter farther south near\r\nLeifsbudir, where a son was born to him. After an unsuccessful search\r\nfor Thorhall by one vessel, a third winter was spent in Vinland, and in\r\n1011 Thorfinn returned to Greenland, leaving perhaps a small colony. De\r\nCosta, _Pre-Columbian Discov. Am._, pp. 48-76, makes the date of this\r\nvoyage 1007-10.\r\n\r\n[1012.] Helge, Finboge, and Eric's daughter Freydisa, who had before\r\nvisited America with her husband, sailed to Vinland, and such as\r\nwere not killed in the internal dissensions of the party returned to\r\nGreenland in 1013. The records of this expedition are very slight. De\r\nCosta's date is 1011-12.\r\n\r\n[1035.] Adam of Bremen speaks of Frisian or German navigators who about\r\nthe year 1035 landed on an island beyond Iceland, where the inhabitants\r\nwere of great size, and were accompanied by fierce dogs—perhaps the\r\nEskimos.\r\n\r\n[1121.] After the expeditions that have been mentioned, concerning each\r\nof which the sagas contain one or more accounts, no farther regular\r\nreports have been preserved; but various voyages are briefly alluded\r\nto in different records, as though trips to the new regions of Vinland\r\nwere no longer of sufficient rarity to be specially noticed. Such\r\nallusions refer to voyages made in 1121, 1285, 1288, 1289, 1290, and\r\n1357. After 1357 no more is heard of the western lands. The settlements\r\nwere gradually abandoned both in Vinland and Greenland, as the power of\r\nthe Northmen declined, and so far as can be known, even their memory\r\nwas buried in the unread records of former greatness. On Scandinavian\r\ndiscoveries, besides Rafn and De Costa, see _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung\r\nAm._, p. 32; _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, pp. 61-85 and 478; _Humboldt_,\r\n_Exam. Crit._, tom. ii. pp. 88-128; _Abstract of Rafn_, in _Journal\r\nLond. Geog. Soc._, 1838, vol. viii. pp. 114-29.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DECLINE OF SCANDINAVIAN DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\nThus after this play of northern lights upon the western horizon\r\nfor four or five centuries, enterprise in that direction languished,\r\nand finally the Sea of Darkness lapsed into its primeval obscurity.\r\nNevertheless the deeds of the Scandinavians must have become more or\r\nless known to other parts of Europe, for the spirit of uneasiness\r\nwhich sent these Northmen across their western waters sent them\r\nalso—particularly the Danes—eastward in the Holy Crusades. It would\r\nbe well for the student to examine the works of Adam of Bremen, and\r\nOrdericus Vitalis, who beside these pre-Columbian voyages describe also\r\nthe Crusades. Moreover, Iceland had Catholic bishops and was therefore\r\nin communication with Rome, where the discoveries of the Northmen\r\nmust have been known. Rafn, _Antiquitates Am._, pp. 283, 292, and De\r\nCosta, _Pre-Columbian Discov. Am._, pp. 106-109, give translations from\r\nScandinavian archives of contemporaneous descriptions of the earth in\r\nwhich these New World discoveries of the Northmen are included. Sailing\r\ncharts and maps of the new discoveries must have been drawn by the\r\nNorthmen, for although none of them were preserved, yet in _Torfæus_,\r\n_Grœnlandia antiqua_, Hauniæ, 1706, made by Icelandic draughtsmen in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and in Ptolemy's Geography, edition\r\nof 1482, is information of certain things contained in no other charts\r\nof the period extant, which must therefore have been partially compiled\r\nfrom Scandinavian sources.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the Northmen imagined that they had found\r\na new continent; very naturally to them Greenland, Helluland, Markland,\r\nand Vinland were but the western continuation of Europe. It is to this\r\nbelief, as well as to the prevailing apathy and skepticism of the age\r\nconcerning matters beyond the reach of positive knowledge, that the\r\nstrange fact of the loss of all trace of these discoveries is due.\r\n\r\nThe exact results of these ancient expeditions, and their influence on\r\nthe subsequent revival of maritime enterprise, form a difficult and as\r\nyet undecided point in the discussion of this subject. Kunstmann gives\r\nparticular attention to this matter, and attaches more importance to\r\nnorthern voyages and their connection with later expeditions than most\r\nother authors; still it has not yet been proved that Prince Henry,\r\nToscanelli, or Columbus in the fifteenth century had any knowledge of\r\nnorth-western discoveries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[1096-1271.] The Crusades—as expeditions, but chiefly for their\r\nresults—deserve a brief mention in this connection. When in the\r\nseventh century Palestine passed from Christian to Mahometan hands,\r\nin which possession it has remained with but temporary interruptions\r\nto the present time, Christian pilgrimages to the Holy City for a few\r\ncenturies were allowed, and to some extent protected. By successive\r\nchanges of dynasty, however, power was transferred from the Arab to\r\nthe Turkish branch of the Mahometans, so that in the eleventh century\r\nChristian pilgrims were cruelly oppressed, and hindered from their\r\npious visits to the tomb of Christ. Roused at first by the exhortations\r\nof Peter the Hermit, Italy, France, England, and Germany sent armies\r\nof the undisciplined and fanatical rabble to avenge the insults to\r\ntheir faith, and wrest the Holy City from the power of barbarian\r\nheretics. From the eleventh to the thirteenth century nine expeditions\r\nwere undertaken eastward in the prosecution of this work. Jerusalem\r\nwas several times taken and retaken, but finally the Crescent was\r\nsuccessful in resisting the encroachments of the Cross, and the Crusades\r\nfailed in their visionary purpose. Still the continued migration of\r\nvast multitudes, from different nations through strange and distant\r\nlands, contributed much to increase popular knowledge of the world, to\r\narouse fresh interest in regions hitherto little known, and to excite\r\ncuriosity respecting the countries still further to the east. Meanwhile,\r\ncommerce received an impetus from the work of furnishing supplies to\r\nthe crusaders; so that these expeditions are included by modern writers\r\nas prominent among the causes which led to the coming revival of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n[1147.] During the twelfth century few maritime expeditions are reported\r\ndeserving of notice. At some not very clearly defined date before 1147,\r\neight Arabs, the Almagrurins, are said to have sailed thirty-five\r\ndays south-west from Lisbon with the intention of exploring the Sea\r\nof Darkness. At the end of the thirty-five days they found and named\r\nan Isle of Sheep, and twelve days farther south reached another island\r\npeopled by red men. They are said to have found there a man who spoke\r\nArabic. Upon the whole the claim to a discovery of any part of America\r\nin this voyage should be slight. If the voyage be authentic, the land\r\nreached was perhaps the Canary Islands; some say those of Cape Verde.\r\n\r\n[1160-73.] Benjamin de Tudela, a Spanish Jew, travelled for thirteen\r\nyears in India, bringing back considerable information respecting\r\nChinese Tartary and the islands of the Indian Ocean. _D. Benjamini_,\r\n_Itinerarium ex versione Montani_, Antwerp, 1575; _Itinerarium D.\r\nBenjaminis_, Leyden, 1633; _Travels of Benjamin, Son of Jonas_, London,\r\n1783.\r\n\r\n[1170.] In this year is placed the reported voyage of Madoc, a Welsh\r\nprince, who, sailing to the west and north from Ireland, landed on an\r\nunknown shore. He afterward returned to this new country with ten ships\r\nwith the intention of colonizing, but was never again heard of. This\r\nvoyage rests on very slight authority, but has claimed importance by\r\nreason of reports, long believed, of the existence in various parts of\r\nAmerica of Welsh-speaking Indian tribes. These reports, like scores\r\nof others referring the Americans to European relationships, proved\r\ngroundless. To say the least, the voyage of Madoc must be considered\r\ndoubtful. _The most ancient Discouery of the West Indies by Madoc the\r\nsonne of Owen Guyneth, Prince of North-wales, in the yeere 1170; taken\r\nout of the history of Wales, in Hakluyt_, vol. iii. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[1246 et seq.] In the middle of the thirteenth century the desire\r\nto extend Christianity was encouraged by rumored conversions already\r\nmade in the dominions of the Mogul, and especially by the report of a\r\npowerful Christian monarch, Prester John, who had reigned somewhere in\r\nthe interior of Asia. This report led to the sending of several priests\r\nas missionaries to the far East. Carpini in 1246, and Ascelino in 1254,\r\nItalian Franciscans, penetrated to the region now known as Chinese\r\nTurkestan. About the same time, 1253 according to Hakluyt, Rubruquis,\r\nalso a Franciscan, from Brabant, traversed the central Asiatic deserts.\r\nHe was the first to present a definite idea of the position of Tartary\r\nand Cathay. A notice of his travels was given in the writings of Roger\r\nBacon in 1267. Toward the end of this century Odorico, of the same\r\norder, visited Persia, India, and finally China, remaining three years\r\nin Peking. _Viaggio del Beato Frate Odorico di Porto Maggiore del\r\nFrivli fatto nell'Anno MCCCXVIII_ (half a century later than above), in\r\n_Ramusio_, tom. ii., fol. 254. See also _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. i. pp.\r\n21-117; vol. ii. pp. 39, 53; _Navarrete_, _Col. Viages_, tom. i. pp.\r\nix. x.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENETIAN AND GENOESE EXPEDITIONS.]\r\n\r\n[1250-95.] Nicolo and Maffio Polo, Venetian brothers, left Venice in\r\n1250 on a trading trip north-eastward. Passing north of the Caspian Sea,\r\nthey spent three years at Bokhara, and afterward in 1265, proceeded to\r\nthe court of Kublai Khan at Kemenfu in Chinese Tartary, whence they\r\nreturned in 1269, intrusted with a mission to the Pope. In 1271 they\r\nagain set out, taking with them Marco, son of Nicolo. They revisited\r\nthe Tartar court, where they spent seventeen years, and returned by\r\nsea down the Chinese and Indian coasts to Ormuz in Persia and thence\r\noverland to Constantinople, reaching Venice in 1295. Marco seems to have\r\nbeen a great favorite at the eastern court, where he was intrusted with\r\nmissions in all directions. By means of his own travels and by reports\r\nof the natives from all sections whom he met, he gained an extensive\r\nknowledge of China and adjoining countries, including the numerous\r\nislands of the coast, chief among which was Zipangu, or Japan. From his\r\nmemoranda, he afterwards wrote in prison, a full account of his eastern\r\ntravels, which was copied and widely circulated in manuscript. See\r\n_Hakluyt Society_, _Divers Voyages_, Introd., p. lii., London, 1850,\r\nfor an account of printed editions of Polo's work. Its authenticity\r\nand general reliability are now admitted, though doubtless errors have\r\nbeen multiplied by copyists. This journey of Marco Polo was by far the\r\nmost important, for revising geography, of any undertaken during the\r\nmiddle ages. From this time the coasts of Asia were laid down on maps\r\nand described with tolerable accuracy by cosmographers. _De i Viaggi\r\ndi Messer Marco Polo, Gentil 'hvomo Venetiano_, in _Ramusio_, tom. ii.\r\nfol. 2-60; _Marco Polo de Veniesia de le meravegliose cose del mondo_,\r\nVenice, 1496; _Marci Pauli veneti de regionibus orientalibus libri\r\ntres_, Cologne, 1671.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians were the most enterprising navigators of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries. They reached England at an early\r\ndate,—_Estancelin_, _Recherches_, pp. 114-16, Paris, 1832—and not\r\nimprobably extended their commercial operations still farther north,\r\nIceland being at the time a flourishing republic with Catholic bishops.\r\n_Kohl's Hist. Discov._, pp. 92-4. No details however are preserved\r\nof any particular one of these voyages, nor of such as may have been\r\ndirected toward Cape Non, the southern limit of oceanic navigation. Some\r\ntime during this century a Moor, Ibn Fatimah, was driven by storms from\r\nCape Non down past Cape Blanco, and his adventure was recorded in an\r\nArabian geography.\r\n\r\n[1291.] Doria and Vivaldi, Genoese, undertook a voyage down the African\r\ncoast with a view of reaching India, and were last heard of at a place\r\ncalled Gozora. On this voyage, which rests on several authorities,\r\nhas been founded a claim that the Italians preceded the Portuguese in\r\npassing Cape Bojador. Major, _Prince Henry_, pp. 99-110, concludes\r\nfrom an examination of all the documents that there are no grounds\r\nfor this claim, although admitting the voyage and its purpose, in fact\r\neverything but its success. Gozora was probably Cape Non. Kohl regards\r\nthis expedition as uncertain. One of the documents gives the date as\r\n1281; from which circumstance Kohl and Humboldt erroneously make of it\r\ntwo voyages. D'Avesac, in _Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_, 1845, tom.\r\ncviii. p. 45, has the date 1285. Muñoz, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 30-1,\r\nspeaks of Genoese expeditions and the rediscovery of the Canaries during\r\nthis century.\r\n\r\n[1306.] On a map made by the Venetian Sanuto in 1306, Africa is\r\nrepresented as surrounded by the sea, but there is no evidence that the\r\ngeography of that region is derived from any actual observations. The\r\nmap simply shows one of the two theories then held respecting the shape\r\nof southern Africa.\r\n\r\n[1332 et seq.] Sir John Mandeville, an English physician, between 1332\r\nand 1366, travelled in eastern parts, including the Holy Land, India,\r\nand China. On his return he wrote in three languages an account of his\r\nadventures, with descriptions of the countries visited. See _Hakluyt\r\nSoc._, _Divers Voy._, Introd. p. xliii. His work corroborates that of\r\nMarco Polo, and although full of exaggerations, and probably tampered\r\nwith by copyists in respect to adventures and anecdotes, \"yet,\" says\r\nIrving, \"his accounts of the countries which he visited have been found\r\nfar more veracious than had been imagined.\" _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_,\r\nvol. iii. pp. 128-38; _Travels of Sir John Mandeville_, London, 1725.\r\n\r\n[1341 et seq.] As we have seen, the Canaries were known to the ancients,\r\nand made by Ptolemy the western limit of the world; but subsequently\r\nthey were nearly forgotten until rediscovered and visited, perhaps\r\nseveral times, toward the middle of the fourteenth century, by the\r\nPortuguese. There is a definite account of one of these voyages. Two\r\nvessels were sent there by the King of Portugal in 1341, and nearly all\r\nthe islands of the group visited, but no settlement was made. Before\r\nthis, Luis de la Cerda represented to the Pope the existence of such\r\nislands, and received by a bull of lordship of them, with the title of\r\nPrince of Fortune. The king of Portugal claimed in 1345 to have sent\r\nout previous expeditions to the islands. The project of Cerda proved\r\na failure and no colony was founded. Voyages to the Canaries became\r\nquite frequent before the end of the century. _Galvano_, _Discoveries_,\r\nLondon, 1862; and in _Collection of Curious Voyages_, London, 1812, p.\r\n10; _Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 30-1; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung\r\nAm._, pp. 1-4. Major, _Prince Henry_, pp. 139-45, dates the bull 1334.\r\n\r\n[1346.] In August, 1346, Jaime Ferrer, a Catalan navigator, sailed from\r\nMajorca in the Mediterranean to search down the African coast for the\r\nRujaura, or River of Gold, and never was heard from. This is proved by\r\na document in the Genoese archives, and by an inscription on a Catalan\r\nmap of 1375. Major shows this to have been an expedition in search of an\r\nunknown or imaginary river of gold, whose supposed existence rested on\r\nancient traditions that a branch of the Nile flowed into the Atlantic,\r\nand which belief was strengthened by the gold brought from Guinea by\r\nthe Arabs. Humboldt understands this Rujaura to have been the Rio d'Ouro\r\nbelow Cape Bojador, an inlet named later by the Portuguese; and he also\r\nstates that Ferrer actually reached that point; but of this there seems\r\nto be no evidence.\r\n\r\n[1351 et seq.] The Azores appear to have been discovered by the\r\nPortuguese early in this half century, appearing on a map of 1351.\r\nThere is however no account of the voyage by which this discovery was\r\nmade, although there is a tradition of a Greek who was there cast away\r\nin 1370. On a Genoese map of the same date the Madeira group is shown,\r\nhaving probably been discovered by Portuguese ships under Genoese\r\ncaptains early in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[1364.] By Villault de Bellefond, _Relation des costes d'Afrique_,\r\nParis, 1669, it is stated that the Dieppese in 1364 made a voyage round\r\nCape Verde, and far beyond, establishing trading-posts, which were\r\nrepeatedly visited in the following years. On this account, repeated\r\nby many writers—_Estancelin_, _Recherches_, p. 72; _Humboldt_, _Exam.\r\nCrit._, tom. i. p. 285—is founded the French claim of having preceded\r\nthe Portuguese in passing Cape Bojador and occupying the gold coast.\r\nMajor, _Prince Henry_, pp. 117-33, maintains by strong proofs that this\r\nvoyage rests on no good authority, and that the French occupation of\r\nthat coast is of much later date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ZENI.]\r\n\r\n[1380.] Nicolo Zeno, a Venetian, sailing northward for England, was\r\ndriven in a storm still farther north, and landed on some islands in\r\npossession of the Northmen, which he named Friesland, but which are\r\nsupposed to have been the Faroe group. Kindly received by the people,\r\nhe sent to Venice for his brother, and both spent there the rest of\r\ntheir lives, making frequent excursions to neighboring islands, and\r\ngaining a knowledge of other more distant lands known to the Northmen,\r\nincluding two countries called Drogeo and Estotiland, lying to the\r\nsouthward of Greenland, which countries the Frieslanders claimed\r\nonce to have visited. Nicolo died in 1395, and Antonio in 1404, after\r\nwriting an account of their adventures, which, with a chart, he sent\r\nto a third brother, Carlo. The manuscript was preserved by the family\r\nand first published under the title _Dei Commentarii del viaggio in\r\nPersia, etc._, Venezia, 1558. After passing the ordeal of criticism the\r\nwork is generally accepted as a faithful report of actual occurrences,\r\nthough embellished, like all writings of the time, with fable. _Dello\r\nScoprimento dell' Isola Frislanda Eslanda, en Grovelanda, et Icaria_,\r\nin _Ramusio_, tom. ii. fol. 230-4; _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. iii. pp.\r\n121-8; _Bos_, _Leben der See-Helden_, pp. 523-7; _Cancellieri_, _Notizie\r\ndi Colombo_, pp. 48-9; _Lelewel_, _Géog. du moyen âge_, tom. iii. pp.\r\n74 et seq. Irving, however, _Columbus_, vol. iii. pp. 435-40, sees in\r\nthis voyage only another of \"the fables circulated shortly after the\r\ndiscovery of Columbus, to arrogate to other nations and individuals the\r\ncredit of the achievement,\" while Zahrtmann, _Remarks on the Voy. to\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere, ascribed to the Zeni of Venice_, in _Journal\r\nof the Geog. Soc._, vol. v. pp. 102-28, London, 1835, claims that the\r\nwhole account is a fable.\r\n\r\nThe chart by the brothers Zeni, published with the manuscript, is of\r\ngreat importance as the first known map which shows any part of America.\r\nIt contains internal evidences of its own authenticity, one of which\r\nis that Greenland is much better drawn than could have been done from\r\nother or extraneous sources even in 1558. I give from Kohl's fac-simile\r\na copy of the map, omitting a few of the names.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ZENO'S CHART, DRAWN ABOUT 1390.]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the countries marked Estotiland, Drogeo,\r\nand Icaria—possibly Nova Scotia, New England, and Newfoundland—owe their\r\nposition on this chart to the actual knowledge of America, obtained\r\neither by a fishing-vessel wrecked there, as stated by the Zeni, or\r\nfrom a tradition preserved since the time of the Northmen. The lines of\r\nlatitude and longitude were not on the original manuscript chart, but\r\nwere added by the editors in 1558. _Lelewel_, _Géog. du moyen âge_, tom.\r\niii. pp. 79-101, Bruxelles, 1852; _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, pp. 97-106.\r\n\r\nAt an unknown date, probably near the end of the thirteenth century,\r\nRobert Machin, an Englishman, eloped with a lady in his own vessel\r\nfrom Bristol. He steered for France, but was driven by a tempest to\r\nthe island of Madeira, where both died. Some of the crew escaped to\r\nthe African coast, where they were taken prisoners, but afterward were\r\nredeemed by the Spaniards, to whom one of them related the discovery of\r\nMadeira, his account leading to its rediscovery. Major concludes, \"that\r\nhenceforth the story of this accidental discovery of Madeira by Machin\r\nmust be accepted as a reality,\" but the date cannot be fixed. That of\r\n1344 often assigned to the voyage results from a misreading of Galvano.\r\nBeside _Galvano_, _Discov._, pp. 58-9, see _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 1672; _The Voyage of Macham, an English man, wherein he\r\nfirst of any man discovered the Iland of Madera_, in _Hakluyt_, vol. ii.\r\npt. ii. p. 1; _Curious and Ent. Voy._, p. 13; _Major's Prince Henry_,\r\np. 67; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[1402.] At the beginning of the fifteenth century, Jean de Betancourt\r\nwith a company of Norman adventurers conquered Lanzarote, one of the\r\nCanary Islands. He afterward became tributary to the crown of Castile,\r\nand by the aid of the Spanish government obtained possession of other\r\nislands of the group, establishing there a permanent colony. _Muñoz_,\r\n_Hist. del Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 30-33; _Peter Martyr_, dec. i. cap.\r\ni., gives the date 1405; _Galvano_, _Discov._, p. 60; _Kunstmann_,\r\n_Entdeckung Am._, p. 6; _Pinkerton's Col.

Hitherto, if we exclude\r\nthe voyages of the Northmen, there had been no attempt worthy the name\r\nof systematic ocean exploration. In the words of Major, \"the pathways\r\nof the human race had been the mountain, the river, and the plain, the\r\nstrait, the lake, the inland sea,\" but now a road is open through the\r\ntrackless ocean, \"a road replete with danger, but abundant in promise.\"\r\nPortugal, guided by the genius of Prince Henry the Navigator, was the\r\nfirst to shake off the lethargy which had so long rested on Europe.\r\nFor some time past the Portuguese had been gradually eclipsing the\r\nItalians in maritime enterprise; but not until a prince leaves the\r\npleasures of youth for the perils of the sea, throwing his life into\r\nthe cause with all the ardor of a devotee, does ocean navigation become\r\nanything more than private commercial speculation, with now and then\r\nsome slight aid from governments. True, others had undertaken the\r\nvoyage round Africa, but Portugal was perhaps the first to make it. As\r\nD'Avesac remarks, _Nouvelles Annales des Voy._, 1846, tom. cx. p. 161:\r\n\"Les Portugais ne s'y engagèrent point les premiers; mais seuls ils y\r\npersevérèrent, et les premiers ils atteignirent le but.\" Born in the\r\nyear 1394, at a time when under his father, John, Portugal was already\r\ncasting wistful glances over the Sea of Darkness, Prince Henry devoted\r\nhis early life to geographical studies and his later life to discovery.\r\nLeaving the pomp and luxury of his father's court, he removed to the\r\ncoast of Algarve, and from the dreary headland of Sagres let fly his\r\nimagination along the unknown shores of Africa. Drawing to him such\r\nyoung noblemen as were willing to share his labors, he established a\r\nschool of navigation, giving special care to the study of cartography\r\nand mathematics. The geographical position of his native land was to\r\nthe Portuguese, in regard to oceanic adventure, not unlike that of the\r\nItalians in regard to Mediterranean navigation. Several causes united\r\nto inspire this prince with so noble an ambition. He desired to promote\r\ngeographical science; to test the theories and traditions of the day; to\r\nknow the truth concerning the disputed question of the form and extent\r\nof southern Africa; to turn the flow of riches, the gold and spices and\r\nslaves of India, from Italy into his own country. Nor was this last\r\nstimulant lessened by the fact that of late, by reason of Mahometan\r\nencroachments on Christian dominions, the old avenues of eastern traffic\r\n_via_ the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf, or by the Red Sea and caravans\r\nacross the deserts, were yearly becoming more insecure, and this too at\r\na time when the taste for eastern luxuries was constantly increasing.\r\nYet other incentives were Christian rivalry and Christian zeal. Spain\r\nhad carried the cross to the Canaries; rumors kept coming in of Prester\r\nJohn and his Christian kingdom, now supposed to be in Africa instead of\r\nin Asia. Prince Henry moreover was grand master of the Order of Christ,\r\nand it behooved him to be stirring. _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom.\r\ni. p. xxvi.; _Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 33-4.\r\n\r\n[1415.] Prince Henry began his voyages along the coast of Africa about\r\nthe year 1415, at which time João de Trasto was sent with vessels to the\r\nCanaries. It was Henry's custom to despatch an expedition almost every\r\nyear, endeavoring each time to advance upon the last, and so finally\r\nattain the end of the mystery—whereat the nobles grumbled not a little\r\nabout useless expense. Obviously progress southward at this rate was\r\nvery slow, and many years elapsed before Cape Bojador was passed and\r\nunknown seas were entered. _Major's Prince Henry_, pp. 64-65.\r\n\r\n[1416-28.] Meanwhile Pedro, Henry's brother, travelled extensively,\r\njourneying through the Holy Land, visiting Rome, Babylon, and even\r\nEngland. Fortunately he found at Venice a copy of Marco Polo's work,\r\nand brought it home to Prince Henry. _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 66-7;\r\n_Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[1418.] Gonzalez and Vaz, who were sent this year by Prince Henry\r\non the regular annual expedition, were driven from their course and\r\nrediscovered Porto Santo. _Galvano_, _Discov._, pp. 62-4; _Kunstmann_,\r\n_Entdeckung Am._, pp. 11, 12; _Curious and Ent. Voy._, pp. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n[1419.] Nicolo di Conti, Venetian, spent twenty-five years in India,\r\nMangi, and Java, returning in 1444, and confirming many of Polo's\r\nstatements. _Discorso sopra il Viaggio di Nicolo di Conti Venetiano_, in\r\n_Ramusio_, tom. i. fol. 373. Twice in 1419, if we may credit Navarrete,\r\n_Col. de Viages_, tom. i. p. xxvi., did Prince Henry's ships pass\r\nseventy leagues beyond Cape Non.\r\n\r\n[1420.] Gonzalez again embarks from Portugal intending to plant a\r\ncolony, and guided by one Morales, a survivor of Machin's voyage,\r\nrediscovered Madeira. _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. i. pp.\r\nxxvi-vii.; _Major's Prince Henry_, pp. 73-7; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung\r\nAm._, p. 13; _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 63-4; _Aa_, _Naaukeurige\r\nVersameling_, tom. i. pt. ii. p. 16. On a certain map dated 1459 is a\r\ncape supposed to be Good Hope, with the statement that in 1420 an Indian\r\njunk had passed that point from the east; but for this no authority is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n1431.] The Formigas and Santa María islands of the Azore group were this\r\nyear discovered by Cabral. Kunstmann, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 15, makes\r\nthe date August 15, 1432. For details of the discovery and settlement\r\nof all the eastern Atlantic islands, see _idem_, pp. 1-25.\r\n\r\n[1434-6.] Gil Eannes, after an unsuccessful attempt in the preceding\r\nyear, succeeded in 1434 in doubling Cape Bojador for the first time.\r\nMuñoz, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, p. 34, makes the date 1433, and Navarrete,\r\n_Col. de Viages_, tom. i. p. xxvii., 1423. In 1435 Eannes with Baldaya\r\npassed fifty leagues beyond the cape, and in 1436 Baldaya advanced to\r\na point fifty leagues beyond the inlet since known as Rio d'Ouro.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SLAVE-TRADE.]\r\n\r\n[1441-8.] For several years after the successful doubling of Cape\r\nBojador, no new attempt of importance is recorded, but in 1441 the\r\nvoyages were renewed, and in the next eight years the exploration was\r\npushed one hundred leagues below Cape Verde. Prior to 1446 fifty-one\r\nvessels had traded on the African coast, nearly one thousand slaves\r\nhad been taken to Portugal, and the discoveries in the Azores had been\r\ngreatly extended. By these explorations Prince Henry had exploded the\r\ntheory of a burning zone impassable to man, and of stormy seas impeding\r\nall navigation; his belief that Africa might be circumnavigated was\r\nconfirmed; and he had obtained from the pope a grant to the crown of\r\nPortugal of lands he might discover beyond Cape Bojador to the Indies\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\n[1455-6.] According to Ramusio, _Viaggi_, tom. i. p. 105, Alvise\r\nCadamosto, a Venetian, the first of his countrymen as he claims to sail\r\ndown the new coast, made a voyage for Prince Henry to the Gambia River\r\nbelow Cape Verde. This expedition derives its importance not from the\r\nlimit reached, where others had preceded him, but from his numerous\r\nlanding points, careful observations, and the detailed account published\r\nby the voyager himself in _La Prima Navigazione, etc._, Vicenza, 1507;\r\nalso in _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, tom. i. pp. 104-15. This explorer touched\r\nat Porto Santo, Madeira, the Canaries, Cape Blanco, Senegal, Budomel,\r\nCape Verde, and the Gambia River.\r\n\r\n[1457.] Cadamosto claims, _La seconda navigazione_, in _Ramusio_,\r\n_Viaggi_, tom. i. pp. 116-20, to have made a second voyage, during which\r\nhe discovered the Cape Verde Islands; but Major, _Prince Henry_, pp.\r\n278-88, shows that such a voyage was not made in that year, if at all.\r\n\r\n[1460.] Diogo Gomez discovered the Cape Verde Islands, and their\r\ncolonization was effected during the following years. Major, _Prince\r\nHenry_, pp. 288-99, publishes the original account for the first\r\ntime in English. Prince Henry died in November of this year. _Major's\r\nPrince Henry_, p. 303; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 19. Irving,\r\n_Columbus_, vol. i. p. 30, fixes this date 1473; and Galvano, _Discov._,\r\np. 14, says 1463.\r\n\r\n[1461.] The spirit of discovery and the thirst for African gold and\r\nslaves had become too strong to receive more than a temporary check in\r\nthe death of its chief promoter. In the year following Prince Henry's\r\ndeath a fort was built on the African coast to protect the already\r\nextensive trade, and in 1461 or 1462 Pedro de Cintra reached a point\r\nin nearly 5° north, being over six hundred miles below the limit\r\nof Cadamosto's voyage. _La Nauigation del Capitan Pietro di Sintra\r\nPortoghese, scritta per Meser Aluise da ca da Mosto_, in _Ramusio_, tom.\r\ni. fol. 119.\r\n\r\n[1469-89.] In 1469 Fernam Gomez rented the African trade from the king\r\nof Portugal for a term of five years, and during that time pushed his\r\nexplorations under Santarem and Escobar to Cape St Catherine in 2°\r\nsouth, first crossing the equator in 1471. Under João II., who succeeded\r\nAlfonso V. in 1481, the traffic continued, and in 1489 Diogo Cam reached\r\na point in 22°, over two hundred leagues below the Congo River, planting\r\nthere a cross which is said to be yet standing. Martin Behaim, the\r\nmathematician and cosmographer, accompanied Cam on this voyage, and an\r\nerror or interpolation in _Schedel_, _Registrum, etc._, Nuremberg, 1493,\r\ngave rise to the unfounded report that they sailed west and discovered\r\nAmerica. _Humboldt_, _Exam.

About\r\n1484, Christopher Columbus having proposed a new scheme of reaching\r\nIndia by sailing west, the king of Portugal surreptitiously sent a\r\nvessel to test his theory, which, after searching unsuccessfully for\r\nland westward, returned to the Cape Verde Islands. _Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo\r\nMundo_, pp. 53-4 et al. Columbus had resided in Portugal since 1470,\r\nand had made several trips in Portuguese ships down the African coast,\r\nin the course of which he is supposed to have first conceived his new\r\nproject. Indignant at the conduct of the Portuguese king, Columbus left\r\nfor Spain. _Colon_, _Hist. del Almirante_, in _Barcia_, _Hist. Prim._,\r\ntom. i. pp. 9-10; translation in _Pinkerton's Col. Voy._, vol. xii. pp.\r\n1-16; and in _Kerr's Col. Voy._, vol. iii. pp. 1-242.\r\n\r\nIn 1486 Bartolomeu Dias sailed round Cape Good Hope and continued his\r\nvoyage to Great Fish River on the south-east coast, from which point\r\nhe was compelled to return on account of the murmurs of his men. The\r\ncape, now for the first time doubled by Europeans, was seen and named\r\nby him on his return. In 1487 King João sent two priests, Covilham and\r\nPayva, to travel in the East, in the hope of gathering more definite\r\ninformation respecting Prester John and his famous Christian kingdom.\r\nPrester John they did not find, but Covilham in his wanderings reached\r\nSofala on the east coast of Africa in about 20° south latitude,\r\nbeing the first of his countrymen to sail on the Indian Ocean. At\r\nSofala he learned the practicability of the voyage which Dias had\r\nactually accomplished a little before, and a message to that effect\r\nwas immediately sent to the king. _Major's Prince Henry_, pp. 339-42;\r\n_Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. i. p. xl-i; _Humboldt_, _Exam.\r\nCrit._, tom. i. pp. 230 et seq.; _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 77-8.\r\n\r\nFrom this time to the great discovery of 1492, few expeditions remain\r\nto be mentioned. It must not be forgotten, however, that by this time\r\ntrading voyages were of ordinary occurrence all along the eastern\r\nAtlantic coast and its adjoining islands from Scandinavia to Guinea.\r\nA lively commerce was carried on throughout this century between\r\nBristol and Iceland, and in the words of Kunstmann, substantiated by\r\nolder authorities, \"a bull of Nicolas IV. to the bishops of Iceland,\r\nproves that the pope in 1448 was intimately acquainted with matters in\r\nGreenland.\" It seems incredible that during all this intercourse with\r\nnorthern lands, no knowledge of America was gained by southern maritime\r\nnations, yet so far as we know there exists no proof of such knowledge.\r\n\r\n[1476.] John of Kolno, or Szkolny, is reported to have made a voyage\r\nin the service of the king of Denmark in 1476, and to have touched on\r\nthe coast of Labrador. The report rests on the authority of Wytfliet,\r\n_Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ augmentum_, Lovanii, 1598, fol. 188, supported\r\nby a single sentence, \"Tambien han ydo alla hombres de Noruega con el\r\nPiloto Iuan Scolno,\" in _Gomara_, _Hist. Gen. de las Indias_, Anvers,\r\n1554, cap. xxxvii. fol. 31; by a similar sentence in _Herrera_, _Hist.\r\nGen._, Madrid, 1601, dec. i. lib. vi. cap. xvi., in which the name is\r\nchanged to Juan Seduco; and by the inscription, _Jac Scolvus Groetland_,\r\non a country west of Greenland on a map made by Michael Lok in 1582,\r\nfac-simile in _Hakluyt Soc._, _Divers Voy._, p. 55. According to Kohl,\r\n_Hist. Discov._, pp. 114-15, this voyage is considered apocryphal by\r\nDanish and Norwegian writers. Lelewel, _Géog. du moyen âge_, p. 106,\r\nregards the voyage as authentic, and Kunstmann, _Entdeckung Am._, pp.\r\n45-8, attaches to it great importance as the source of all the voyages\r\nto the north which followed. Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom. ii. pp.\r\n152-4, gives but little attention to the voyage, and confesses his\r\ninability to decide on its merits: \"Je ne puis hasarder aucun jugement\r\nsur cette assertion de Wytfliet.\"\r\n\r\n[1477.] In this year Columbus, whom we first find with the Portuguese\r\ntraders on the African coast, sailed northward, probably with an English\r\nmerchantman from Bristol, to a point one hundred leagues beyond Thule,\r\nin 73° north. _Colon_, _Hist. del Almirante_ in _Barcia_, tom. i. p. 4;\r\n_Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 43-7; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom.\r\ni. p. 272. He probably visited Iceland, although he gives the latitude\r\nincorrectly, taking it very likely from ancient geography rather than\r\nhis own observations.\r\n\r\n[1482.] According to Kunstmann, the edition of Ptolemy this year,\r\n_Ptolomæi Cosmographia_, Ulmæ, 1482, lib. viii., contains a map that\r\nincludes Greenland, and must have been compiled from northern sources.\r\n\r\n[1488.] Desmarquets, _Mémoires Chronologiques, etc._, Dieppe, 1785, tom.\r\ni. pp. 92-8, states that one Cousin sailed from Dieppe early in 1488,\r\nstood off further from land than other voyagers had done, and after\r\ntwo months reached an unknown land and a great river, which he named\r\nthe Maragnon. Was this the Marañon in South America? He then sailed\r\nsouth-eastward and discovered the southern point of Africa, returning\r\nto Dieppe in 1489. The discovery was kept secret, but Cousin made a\r\nsecond voyage round the cape and succeeded in reaching India. Major,\r\nbesides pointing out some inconsistencies in this account, shows that M.\r\nDesmarquets \"could commit himself to assertions of great moment which\r\nare demonstrably false.\" He is not good authority for so remarkable a\r\ndiscovery not elsewhere recorded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COLUMBIAN EPOCH.]\r\n\r\nBefore striking out with Columbus in his bold venture to the west,\r\nlet us sum up what we have learned thus far and see where we stand.\r\nFirst, the geographical knowledge of the ancients was restricted to a\r\nparallelogram extending north-west and south-east from the Atlantic\r\nto the Indian ocean, comprising one hundred and twenty degrees east\r\nand west by fifty degrees north and south; circumscribe this knowledge\r\nwith legendary stories and hypothetical and traditional beliefs\r\nconcerning the regions beyond; then add a true theory of the earth's\r\nsphericity, though mistaken as to its size. This is all they knew,\r\nand this knowledge they committed to the Dark Age, during which time\r\nit was preserved, and, indeed, little by little enlarged, as we have\r\nseen. During the latter part of the fifteenth century, particularly,\r\na powerful impulse had been given to discovery, especially toward the\r\nsouth; so that now the limits of the ancients were moved eastward\r\nat least forty degrees, to the eastern coasts and islands of Asia,\r\nchiefly by the travels of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville. Toward\r\nthe south, the true form of Africa had been ascertained, and its coasts\r\nhad been explored by the Portuguese, except a space of about fifteen\r\ndegrees on the south-west. Northward the old limit had been advanced\r\nbut slightly, but within this limit much information had been gained\r\nby actual navigation about regions only vaguely described by Ptolemy.\r\nWestward, in what was still a Sea of Darkness, great discoveries had\r\nbeen made by the Northmen, but their results were now practically lost;\r\nwhile toward the south, several important groups of islands had been\r\nadded to the known world. See map on page 73, where the regions added\r\nduring this period are lightly shaded. And now, within the old bound\r\nthe world is much better known than at the beginning of the period, and\r\nmany minor geographical errors of the ancients have been corrected by\r\nthe Crusaders, and others who attempted on a smaller scale to extend\r\nthe Catholic faith, as well as by commercial travellers in distant\r\nlands. Again, by the influx of Mahometans into Europe during five or six\r\ncenturies, eastern luxuries had been introduced to an extent hitherto\r\nunknown, and had in fact become necessities in Christian courts, thus\r\nmaking the India trade the great field of commercial enterprise even\r\nby the tedious and uncertain overland routes where middle-men absorbed\r\nthe profits, and rendering the opening of other and easier routes an\r\nobject of primary importance. The almost exclusive possession of trade\r\n_via_ the old routes by the Italians, furnished an additional motive\r\nto other European nations for explorations by sea. The art of printing,\r\nrecently invented, facilitated the diffusion of learning, so that it was\r\nimpossible for the world ever again to lapse into the old intellectual\r\ndarkness. The astrolabe, the foundation of the modern quadrant, had been\r\nadapted by a meeting of cosmographers in Portugal to the observation\r\nof latitudes by the sun's altitude, and thus the chief obstacle to long\r\nsea-voyages was removed. The polarity of the magnet had long been known,\r\nbut the practical adaptation of the magnetic needle to purposes of\r\nnavigation occurred about the beginning of the fourteenth century. The\r\nmariner's compass, however, only attained its highest purpose toward the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, when the Sea of Darkness was traversed.\r\nBut before this, the greatest impediments to ocean navigation had been\r\novercome by voyages actually made through the aid of the new inventions.\r\nBeside the coasts brought to light by these voyages, they had done much\r\nto dispel the old superstitions of burning zones, impassable capes, and\r\nunnavigable seas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REAL AND IMAGINARY ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, as a result either of the poetic fancy or of the\r\nactual discovery of the ancients, various islands were traditionally\r\nlocated in the Atlantic. Most of them undoubtedly owed their existence\r\nto the natural tendency of man to people unknown seas with fabulous\r\nlands and beings, \"Il est si naturel à l'homme de rêver quelque chose\r\nau-delà de l'horizon visible,\" observes Humboldt. For a full account\r\nof the history and location of these islands, \"dont la position est\r\nencore plus variable que le nom,\" and the important part played by them\r\nin ancient and middle-age geography, see _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._,\r\ntom. ii. pp. 156-245, and _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 6 et seq.,\r\nand 35-37. In the fifteenth century, with the revival of maritime\r\nenterprise, came a renewal and multiplication of the old fables.\r\nMonastic scholars, by their continued study of the old writers, by their\r\nattempts to reconcile ancient geography with fabulous events in the\r\nlives of the saints, and by their inevitable tendency to exaggeration,\r\nhad contributed largely to their preservation. Still, throughout the\r\npreceding period, the belief in the existence of such islands had\r\nbeen vague and hypothetical; but when the actual existence of numerous\r\nislands in the western ocean was proved, and the Canary, Madeira, Azore,\r\nand Cape Verde groups were discovered and explored, the old ideas\r\nwere naturally revived and confirmed, and with them rose a desire to\r\nrediscover all that had been known to the ancient voyagers. The reported\r\nwonders of the fabulous isles, having on them great and rich cities,\r\nwere confidently sought in each newly found land, and not appearing in\r\nany of them, the islands themselves were successively located farther\r\nand farther to the west, out in the mysterious sea, to be surely brought\r\nto light by future explorations.\r\n\r\nAnd of a truth, this wondrous western empire was subsequently brought\r\nto light; peoples and cities were found, but beyond the limits within\r\nwhich the wildest dreams of their discoverers had ever placed them. On\r\nthis foundation not a few speculators build a theory that America was\r\nknown to the ancients. The chief of the hypothetical isles were San\r\nBrandan, Antilia, and the Island of the Seven Cities; their existence\r\nwas firmly believed in, and they were definitely located on maps of\r\nthe period. San Brandan is said to have been visited by the saint whose\r\nname it bears in the sixth century. It was at first located far north\r\nand west of Ireland, but gradually moved southward until at the time\r\nof Columbus' first voyage it is found nearly in the latitude of Cape\r\nVerde. To the inflamed imagination mirage is solid earth, or sea, or\r\na beautiful city; an island which was long supposed to be visible from\r\nMadeira and the Canaries had something to do with the location of this\r\nisland of the saint, and of the others.\r\n\r\nAntilia, and the Island of Seven Cities, according to Behaim's map, are\r\nidentical. See page 93 this volume; also a reputed letter of Toscanelli,\r\nabout the existence of which Humboldt thinks there may be some doubt.\r\nThe only tangible point in the traditionary history is the migration\r\nof seven bishops, driven from the Peninsula by the Moorish invasion in\r\nthe eighth century, who took refuge there and built the Seven Cities.\r\nThe history and location of this Island of the Seven Cities in the\r\nfifteenth century are similar to those of San Brandan Island. Galvano\r\nsays a Portuguese ship was there in 1447. Brazil, Bracie, or Berzil,\r\nwas another of these wandering isles, whose name has been preserved\r\nand applied to a rock west of Ireland, to one of the Azore islands,\r\nand to a country in South America. This name has been the theme of much\r\ndiscussion, which, so far as I know, leads to no result beyond the fact\r\nthat the name of a valuable dye-wood known to the ancients was afterward\r\napplied to lands known or conjectured to produce such woods. _Humboldt_,\r\n_Exam. Crit._, tom. ii. pp. 214-45; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp.\r\n7-10, and 35 et seq. Kunstmann attaches greater geographical importance\r\nto the fabulous isles than Humboldt, connecting them in a manner\r\napparently not quite clear to himself with the previous discoveries\r\nof the Northmen. Thus stood facts and fancies concerning the geography\r\nof the world, when the greatest of discoverers arose and achieved the\r\ngreatest of discoveries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough in the chapters following I speak more at length of the\r\ndeeds of the Genoese and his companions, yet in order to complete\r\nthis Summary it is necessary to mention them here. I shall attempt no\r\ndiscussion concerning the country, family, date of birth, or early\r\nlife of Christopher Columbus. For the differences of opinion on\r\nthese points, with numerous references, see _Harrisse_, _Bibliotheca\r\nAmericana Vetustissima_, New York, 1866, p. 2 et seq. Born somewhere\r\nin Italy, probably Genoa, about 1435, he received something more than\r\na rudimentary education, went to sea at the early age of fourteen, and\r\nin 1470, which is about the date of his coming to Portugal, had already\r\nan extensive experience in the navigation of the Mediterranean, and\r\nwas skilled in the theory as well as the practice of his profession.\r\nWe have already seen him with the Portuguese on the African coast, and\r\nwith the English in Iceland. In fact, before his first voyage westward\r\nin 1492, he was practically acquainted with all waters then navigated\r\nby Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe promptings which urged forward this navigator to the execution\r\nof his great enterprise may be stated as follows: The success of the\r\nPortuguese in long voyages down the African coast suggested to his\r\nmind, soon after 1470, that if they could sail so far south, another\r\nmight sail west with the same facility and perhaps profit. Says his\r\nson: \"Estando en Portugal, empeçó à congeturar, que del mismo modo que\r\nlos Portugueses navegaron tan lejos al Mediodia, podria navegarse la\r\nbuelta de Occidente, i hallar tierra en aquel viage.\" _Colon_, _Hist.\r\ndel Almirante_, in _Barcia_, tom. i. p. 4; edition of Venetia, 1709,\r\npp. 22-3; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. p. 12; _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\nde Viages_, tom. i. p. lxxix; _Herrera_, _Hist. Gen._, dec. i. lib.\r\ni. cap. 1-7. His ardent imagination once seized with this idea, every\r\nnook and corner of geographical knowledge was searched for evidence\r\nto support his theory. By intercourse with other navigators he learned\r\nthat at different times and places along the western coasts of Europe\r\nand Africa, objects apparently from unknown western lands had been\r\nwashed ashore, suppositionally by the wind, really by the Gulf Stream\r\nor other oceanic currents. _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. ii. p. 249.\r\nThough well aware of existing rumors of islands seen at different times\r\nin the western ocean, it was not upon these, if any such there were,\r\nthat he built his greatest anticipations of success. In the writings of\r\nthe ancients he found another stimulant. Filled with fervent piety and\r\nsuperstitious credulity, he pored over every cosmographical work upon\r\nwhich he could lay his hands, as well the compilations of antiquated\r\nnotions, such as the _Imago Mundi_ of Pierre D'Ailly, or the more\r\nmodern travels of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville. _Colon_, _Hist.\r\ndel Almirante_, in _Barcia_, tom. i. p. 4 et seq.; _Major's Prince\r\nHenry_, pp. 349, 352; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp. 46, 60;\r\n_Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 74-6.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVOLUTION OF THE GRAND CONCEPTION.]\r\n\r\nThe result of these studies was a complete acquaintance with the\r\ngeographical knowledge of the day, with the greater part of what I have\r\nthus far epitomized, the doings of the Northmen excepted. From all\r\nthis he knew of the earth's sphericity; he believed that the larger\r\npart of the world's surface was dry land; that the land known to\r\nPtolemy extended over at least 180 degrees, or half the circumference\r\nof the globe, that is, from the Canaries to the Ganges; he knew that\r\nby later travels the eastern limit of geographical knowledge had been\r\nmoved much farther east, even to Cathay; he believed that far out in\r\nthe ocean lay the island of Zipangu; he knew that some eight or ten\r\ndegrees had been added on the west by the discovery of the Azores;\r\nhe believed that at most only one third of the circumference remained\r\nto be navigated; that this space might naturally contain some islands\r\navailable as way stations in the voyage; that the explorations in the\r\nEast were very indefinite, and consequently Asia might, and probably\r\ndid, extend farther east than was supposed; that Ptolemy's figures\r\nwere not undisputed—Marino making the distance from the Canaries to the\r\nGanges 225 degrees instead of 180, while another geographer, Alfragano,\r\nby actual measurement, made each degree about one sixth smaller than\r\nPtolemy, thus reducing the size of the earth, and with it the remaining\r\ndistance to India; that several ancient writers—see quotations from\r\nAristotle, Strabo, Seneca, et al., in _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i.\r\npp. 38, 61, 98 et seq.—had pronounced the distance to India very short,\r\nand had affirmed that it might be navigated in a few days; and finally\r\nthat other scholars, as Toscanelli, had arrived at the same conclusions\r\nas himself, possibly before himself. _Cartas de Pablo Toscanelli, Físico\r\nFlorentin, á Cristobal Colon y al Canónigo Portugues Fernando Martinez,\r\nsobre el descubrimiento de las Indias_, in _Navarrete_, tom. ii. pp.\r\n1-4; _Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 48-9. See also, on Columbus'\r\nmotives, _Irving's Columbus_, vol. i. pp. 42-51, and vol. ii. p. 148;\r\n_Muñoz_, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, pp. 45-7; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom.\r\nii. pp. 324-9; _Stevens' Notes_, p. 28; _Major's Prince Henry_, pp.\r\n347-52; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 74. Many of these conclusions\r\nwere erroneous, being founded on an incorrect idea of longitude;\r\nbut this reduction of the earth's size was an error most fortunate\r\nfor discovery, inasmuch as with a correct idea of the distance to be\r\ntraversed, and with no suspicion of an intervening continent, such an\r\nexpedition as that of the Genoese would not have been undertaken at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ideas and aspirations of Columbus before his undertakings;\r\nlater in life a theologic mysticism took possession of his mind,\r\nand his success was simply a fulfillment of divine prophecy in which\r\ncosmographical realities went for nothing. See _Cartas de Don Cristobal\r\nColon_, in _Navarrete_, tom. i. p. 330.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to diminish the glory of Columbus' achievement by proving\r\na previous discovery whose results were known to him have signally\r\nfailed. The reports of mysterious maps which have been claimed to have\r\nprompted his enterprise evidently amount to nothing in view of the fact\r\nthat Columbus never suspected the existence of any new countries, yet\r\nthat he saw maps of the world, including the Asiatic coasts, can not\r\nbe doubted. The case of the pilot Sanchez, said to have died in the\r\nhouse of Columbus, and to have told him of lands he had seen toward the\r\nwest, if true, is likewise of little moment as touching the honor due\r\nto Columbus, for many men were confident of having seen such lands from\r\nthe Canaries and other islands, and several voyages had been made in\r\nsearch of them, all of which was certainly known to Columbus. The story\r\nof Sanchez was started by Oviedo, who gives no authority or date for the\r\nevent; it was repeated generally with disapproval by other historians,\r\nuntil revived by Garcilaso de la Vega with date and details; but his\r\ndate, 1484, is ten years after Columbus is known to have proposed his\r\nscheme to the Portuguese government. Columbus originated no new theory\r\nrespecting the earth's form or size, though a popular idea has always\r\nprevailed, notwithstanding the statements of the best writers to the\r\ncontrary, that he is entitled to the glory of the theory as well as to\r\nthat of the execution of the project. He was not in advance of his age,\r\nentertained no new theories, believed no more than did Prince Henry,\r\nhis predecessor, or Toscanelli, his contemporary; nor was he the first\r\nto conceive the possibility of reaching the east by sailing west. He\r\nwas however the first to act in accordance with existing beliefs. The\r\nNorthmen in their voyages had entertained no ideas of a New World, or\r\nof an Asia to the west. To knowledge of theoretical geography, Columbus\r\nadded the skill of a practical navigator, and the iron will to overcome\r\nobstacles. He sailed west, reached Asia as he believed, and proved old\r\ntheories correct.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two undecided points in that matter, neither of which\r\ncan ever be settled. First, did his experience in the Portuguese\r\nvoyages, the perusal of some old author, or a hint from one of the\r\nfew men acquainted with old traditions, first suggest to Columbus his\r\nproject? In the absence of sustaining proof, the statement of the son\r\nFernando that the father should be credited with the reconception of\r\nthe great idea, goes for little. Second, to what extent did his voyage\r\nto the north influence his plan? There is no evidence, but a strong\r\nprobability, that he heard in that voyage of the existence of land\r\nin the west. It is hardly possible that no tradition of Markland and\r\nVinland remained in Iceland, when but little more than a hundred years\r\nhad passed since the last ship had returned from those countries, and\r\nwhen many persons must have been living who had been in Greenland. If\r\nsuch traditions did exist, Columbus certainly must have made himself\r\nacquainted with them. Still his visit to the north was in 1477, several\r\nyears after the first formation of his plan, and any information gained\r\nat the time could only have been confirmatory rather than suggestive.\r\nBoth Humboldt and Kunstmann think that even if he ever heard of the\r\ndiscoveries of the Northmen—which is thought probable by the latter—this\r\nknowledge would not have agreed with, nor encouraged, his plans. Kohl,\r\n_Hist. Discov._, pp. 115-20, believes that such a knowledge would have\r\nbeen the strongest possible confirmation of his idea of the nearness\r\nof Asia and Europe, in which opinion I concur. The idea of Draper,\r\n_Hist. Int. Develop._, p. 446, that had Columbus known of the northern\r\ndiscoveries he would have steered farther to the north, seems of no\r\nweight, since he sought not the northern but the southern parts of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nWhat Columbus had to contend with at this juncture was not, as I have\r\nsaid, old doctrines oppugnant to any new conception, but the ignorance\r\nof the masses, who held no doctrine beyond that of proximate sense,\r\nwhich spread out the earth's surface, so far as their dull conceptions\r\ncould reach, in one universal flatness; and the knowledge of courts,\r\nwhence alone the great discoverer could hope for support, was but\r\nlittle in advance of that of the people. Then the Church, with its\r\nusual firmness and conservatism, was against him. The monks, who were\r\nthen the guardians of learning, knew, or might have known, all that\r\nPrince Henry, Columbus, and other earnest searchers had ascertained\r\nregarding the geography of the earth; but what were science and facts\r\nto them if they in any wise conflicted with the preconceived notions\r\nof the Fathers, or with Church dogmas? \"II est vrai,\" says Humboldt,\r\n\"que les scrupules théologiques de Lactance, de St. Chrysostôme et de\r\nquelques autres Pères de l'Eglise, contribuèrent à pousser l'esprit\r\nhumain dans un mouvement rétrograde.\" And again, the African expeditions\r\nof the Portuguese had not on the whole been profitable or encouraging\r\nto other similar undertakings, and the financial condition of most\r\nEuropean courts was not such as to warrant new expenses. Portugal, more\r\nadvanced and in better condition to embark in new enterprises than any\r\nother nation, now regarded the opening of her route to India _via_ the\r\nCape of Good Hope an accomplished fact, and therefore looked coldly\r\non any new venture. Nor were the extravagant demands of Columbus with\r\nrespect to titles and authority over the new regions of Asia which he\r\nhoped to find, likely to inspire monarchs, jealous of their dignities,\r\nwith favor toward a penniless, untitled adventurer. Passing as well\r\nthe successive disappointments of Columbus in his weary efforts to\r\nobtain the assistance necessary to the accomplishment of his project,\r\nas his final success with Queen Isabella of Castile, let us resume our\r\nchronological summary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARTIN BEHAIM'S GLOBE, 1492.]\r\n\r\n[1492.] Shortly before the sailing of Columbus, the learned astronomer\r\nMartin Behaim, of Nuremberg, constructed a globe showing the whole\r\nsurface of the earth as understood by the best geographers of the\r\ntime. This globe has been preserved, and I present a fac-simile of the\r\nAmerican hemisphere published in _Ghillany_, _Geschichte des Seefahrers\r\nRitter Martin Behaim_, Nürnberg, 1853. The entire globe may be seen\r\nin _Jomard_, _Les Monuments de la Géographie_, no. xv., Paris, 1854. A\r\nsection of the globe is given by Irving, _Columbus_, vol. i. p. 53 (see\r\nalso _Id._, p. 135), by _London Geog. Soc. Journal_, 1848, vol. xviii.\r\np. 76; and a copy from Ghillany, with some of the names omitted, may be\r\nfound in _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, p. 147, map no. iv.\r\n\r\nThe chart by which the voyage of Columbus was made is supposed to\r\nhave been a copy of Behaim's Globe, which indeed may be regarded as\r\nthe exponent of geographical conceptions, those of Columbus as well\r\nas those of the learned men and practical navigators of the day. By\r\nan inscription on the original, the Asiatic coast is known to have\r\nbeen laid down from Marco Polo, and to the islands of Antilia and San\r\nBrandan are joined other inscriptions giving their history as I have\r\nbefore indicated. Sailing from Palos on the 3d of August, 1492, with\r\none hundred and twenty men in three vessels commanded by himself and the\r\ntwo brothers Pinzon, Columbus was at last fairly launched on the Sea of\r\nDarkness. After a detention of three weeks at the Canaries, he sailed\r\nthence the 6th of September; marked, not without alarm, the variation\r\nof the needle on the 30th of September; and on the 12th of October\r\ndiscovered San Salvador, or Cat Island.\r\n\r\nSo far all was well; all was as the bold navigator had anticipated;\r\nall accorded with current opinions, his own among the number; he had\r\nsailed certain days, had accomplished a certain distance, and had\r\nreached triumphantly one of the numerous islands mentioned by Marco\r\nPolo, and, God willing, would soon find the larger island of Zipangu.\r\nAlas for mathematical calculations, for that other third of the earth's\r\ncircumference; alas for the intervening continent and broad Pacific sea,\r\nwhich baffled the great discoverer to the day of his death!\r\n\r\nPassing over the cruise through the Bahamas, or Marco Polo's archipelago\r\nof seven thousand islands, in which the discoverers touched successively\r\nat Concepcion, Exuma (Fernandina), and Isla Larga (Isabela), we find\r\nColumbus sailing from the last-mentioned island on the 24th of October\r\nfor Zipangu, with the intention of proceeding thence to the main-land,\r\nand presenting his credentials to the great Khan.\r\n\r\nTouching at the Mucaras group, Columbus arrived at Zipangu, which was\r\nnone other than the island of Cuba, on the 28th of October, and gave to\r\nthe island, in place of its barbarous appellation, the more Christian\r\nname of Juana. Cruising along the northern shore of Cuba, in frequent\r\nconverse with the natives, he soon learned that this was not Zipangu,\r\nwas not even an island, but was the veritable Asiatic continent itself,\r\nfor so his fervid mind interpreted the strange language of this people.\r\nUnfortunately he could not find the Khan; after diligent search he\r\ncould find no great city, nor any imperial court, nor other display\r\nof oriental opulence such as were described by Marco Polo and Sir John\r\nMandeville—only naked barbarians and thatched huts; so after advancing\r\nwest beyond Savana la Mar, the discoverers returned to the eastern end\r\nof Cuba, visiting on the way the group El Jardin del Rey. Postponing\r\nthe exploration of the coast toward the south-west, Columbus returned\r\neastward and followed the northern coast of Española, turning off on his\r\nway to discover the Tortugas, and arriving at La Navidad, where he built\r\na fort and left a colony of thirty-nine men. Now, Española, and not Cuba\r\nas he had at first supposed, was the true Zipangu; for the main-land\r\nof China could not by any possibility be the island of Japan; and in\r\nthis belief Columbus sailed for Spain on the 16th of January, reaching\r\nthe Azores on the 18th of February, and arriving at Palos the 15th of\r\nMarch, 1493. _Primer viage de Colon_, in _Navarrete_, tom. i. pp. 1-197;\r\n_Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. i. booke ii. pp. 10-13; _Sammlung\r\naller Reisebeschreibungen_, tom. xiii. p. 10; _Napione_ and _De Conti_,\r\n_Biografia Colombo_, pp. 305-36; _Peter Martyr_, dec. i. cap. i.;\r\n_Oviedo_, _Hist. Gen._, tom. i. pp. 21-31, 46-55; _Colon_, _Hist. del\r\nAlmirante_, in _Barcia_, tom. i. pp. 13-38; _Irving's Columbus_, vol. i.\r\npp. 124-289; vol. iii. pp. 447-68; _Major's Prince Henry_, pp. 356-7;\r\n_West-Indische Spieghel_, p. 10; _Cancellieri_, _Notizie di Colombo_,\r\npp. 66-76.\r\n\r\n[1493.] Just before reaching the Azores, Columbus wrote on shipboard two\r\nletters describing his voyage, one under date of the 15th of February,\r\nand the other of the 14th of March. The manuscript of one, with copies\r\nprinted in Spain probably during this same year, are yet preserved. Of\r\nthe other, both the original manuscript and Spanish copies, if any were\r\nprinted, are lost; but of a Latin translation, six editions are extant,\r\nsupposed to have been printed in 1493, in France and in Italy, under\r\nthe title _Epistola Christofori Colom_, or _De Insulis Inventis_, etc. A\r\npoetical paraphrase of the same letter appeared the same year as _Dati_,\r\n_Questa e la Hystoria_, etc., Florence, 1493, and four other works of\r\nthis year contain slight allusions to Columbus. Seven or eight editions\r\nof Columbus' letters appeared in different forms during the next forty\r\nyears. Both letters may be found with Spanish translations in the first\r\nvolume of Navarrete's collection. For the bibliographical notices of\r\nthis sketch I have depended chiefly on Harrisse, _Bib. Am. Vet._, as the\r\nlatest and most complete essay on early American books, notwithstanding\r\nthe few blunders that have subjected it to so much ridicule. I shall\r\nnot consider it necessary to repeat the reference with each notice, as\r\nHarrisse's work is arranged chronologically.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PAPAL BULL OF PARTITION.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Columbus had explained to Ferdinand and Isabella the nature\r\nof his important discovery, the Spanish sovereigns applied to the Pope\r\nfor the same grants and privileges respecting lands discovered, and to\r\nbe discovered, in the west, that had before been granted the Portuguese\r\nin the south and east. His Holiness, accepting the Spanish statements\r\nthat the concessions demanded did not in any way conflict with previous\r\ngrants to the Portuguese, by bull of May 2, 1493, ceded to Spain all\r\nlands which might be discovered by her west of a line drawn from pole\r\nto pole, one hundred leagues west of the Azores; the Portuguese to have\r\nall new lands east of the same line. It is obvious that his Holiness\r\nfixed this line arbitrarily, without a thought of the position or\r\nimportance of the corresponding meridian at the antipodes. This opposite\r\nmeridian, according to the idea of longitude entertained at the time,\r\nwould fall in the vicinity of India proper; and the Portuguese, besides\r\ntheir natural jealousy of this new success of Spain, feared that the\r\nwestern hemisphere thus given to her rival might include portions of\r\ntheir Indian grants. Hence arose much trouble in the few following years\r\nbetween the two courts. See _infra_.\r\n\r\nAmidst the enthusiasm following his success Columbus had no difficulty\r\nin fitting out another expedition. Embarking from Cádiz September\r\n25, 1493, with seventeen vessels and over 1,200 men, among whom were\r\nAlonso de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa, _el almirante_, or the admiral,\r\nas Columbus was now called, touched at the Canaries, discovered\r\nDominica the 3d of November, and Guadalupe a few days later; thence\r\nsailing north-west through the Caribbean Archipelago, he occasionally\r\nlanded and gave names to islands. Resting two days at Puerto Rico, he\r\nreached the coast of Española on the 22d of November, and on the 27th\r\nanchored off the port of Navidad. The settlement established at this\r\nplace in the previous voyage had totally disappeared; the colonists\r\nas is supposed falling victims to internal dissensions and general\r\nexcesses. A new city called Isabela was then founded at another port of\r\nthis island, and Ojeda was sent inland to explore the country. After a\r\nshort absence he returned, reporting the country rich in gold. On the\r\nsecond of February, 1494, twelve vessels, with specimens of the people\r\nand products of the country, were despatched for Spain under Antonio\r\nde Torres. By this departure was also sent a request for immediate\r\nsupplies. Recovering from a serious illness, Columbus checked a revolt\r\namong his people on the 24th of April, built a fort in the interior,\r\nand then sailed to explore the main coast of Asia—as he supposed, but in\r\ntruth Cuba—south-westward from the point where he left it on his first\r\nvoyage. Following the south coast of Cuba the admiral at length reached\r\nthe vicinity of Philipina, or Cortés Bay, where the shore bends to the\r\nsouthward. This to him seemed conclusive proof that it was indeed the\r\nmain-land of Asia which he was coasting. The statements of the natives\r\nwho said that Cuba was in fact an island, but that it was so large that\r\nno one had ever reached its western extremity, confirmed him in his\r\nbelief—since one might question the knowledge of a boundary which no\r\none had ever reached and from which no one had ever come. The theory of\r\nthe age was thus made good, and that was sufficient; so Columbus brought\r\nall his crew, officers and men, before the notary, and made them swear\r\nthat the island of Cuba was the continent of Asia—an act significant of\r\nmethods of conversion in those days. He even proposed to continue the\r\nvoyage along the coast to the Red Sea, and thence home by way of the\r\nMediterranean, or, better still, round the Cape of Good Hope, to meet\r\nand surprise the Portuguese; but his companions thought the supplies\r\ninsufficient for so long a voyage, and the admiral was persuaded to\r\npostpone the attempt.\r\n\r\nReturning therefore to Española, on the way back Columbus discovered\r\nand partially explored Jamaica, Isla de Pinos, and the small islands\r\nscattered to the southward of Cuba, arriving at Isabela on the 4th of\r\nSeptember. There he found matters in a bad way. The colony, comprising\r\na motley crew of lawless adventurers, ever ready to attribute success\r\nto themselves and ill-fortune to their governor, trumped up numerous\r\ncomplaints which caused the admiral no little trouble. Margarite, to\r\nwhom had been given a command for an expedition inland, had revolted and\r\nsailed with several ships for Spain. Open war had been declared with the\r\nnatives, and the colonists were hard pressed; but the admiral's presence\r\nand Ojeda's impetuous bravery soon secured order. Meanwhile two arrivals\r\ninspired the colonists with fresh courage; that of Bartolomé Colon,\r\nbrother of the admiral, with three ships, and that of Torres, with four\r\nvessels laden with supplies. With the gold that had been accumulated,\r\nand specimens of fruits and plants, and five hundred natives as slaves,\r\nTorres was sent back to Spain, accompanied by Diego Colon, whose mission\r\nwas to defend his brother's interests at court. The pacification of the\r\nnatives was then completed, and heavy taxes were imposed upon them. In\r\nOctober, 1495, arrived Juan de Aguado, sent by the king to ascertain\r\nthe facts concerning charges against the admiral. This man, in place\r\nof executing his commission fairly, only stirred up the accusers of\r\nColumbus to greater enmity—which quality of justice well accorded with\r\nthe temper of his master Ferdinand. On account of these troubles, as\r\nwell as from the discovery of a new gold mine, which proved beyond\r\nquestion that Española was the ancient Ophir of King Solomon, Columbus\r\ndecided to return to Spain. So leaving his brother, Bartolomé, in\r\ncommand as _adelantado_, or lieutenant-governor, he sailed with Aguado,\r\non the 10th of March, in two caravels, carrying 225 Spaniards and thirty\r\nnatives. Touching at Marigalante, and Guadalupe, he arrived at Cádiz\r\nJune 11, 1496. _Segundo Viage de Cristobal Colon_, in _Navarrete_, tom.\r\ni. pp. 198-241; _Colon_, _Hist. del Almirante_, in _Barcia_, tom. i.\r\npp. 42-73; _Peter Martyr_, dec. i. cap. 2-4; _Oviedo_, _Hist.

The letters which\r\nColumbus sent to Spain by Torres in February, 1494, if ever printed, are\r\nlost; but in _Syllacio_, _ad Sapiẽtissimũ ... de insulis_, etc., Pavia,\r\n1494 or 1495, appeared certain letters from Spain to the author of this\r\nwork, describing the second voyage of Columbus.\r\n\r\n[1494.] Thus during the absence of Columbus on his second voyage we have\r\nseen the ocean route between Spain and Española six times navigated;\r\nfirst, by the fleet of twelve vessels sent back to Spain by the admiral\r\nunder Antonio de Torres; second, by Bartolomé Colon, who followed his\r\nbrother to Española with three ships; third, by Margarite, who revolted\r\nand left Española during the absence of Columbus in Cuba; fourth, by\r\nTorres in command of four vessels from Spain with supplies for the\r\ncolony; fifth, by the return of the same four ships to Spain with gold\r\nand slaves; and sixth, by Juan de Aguado with four ships from Spain in\r\nAugust, 1495.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REPARATION OF THE WORLD.]\r\n\r\nWith the division of the world by Pope Alexander VI., Portugal was not\r\nsatisfied. The world was thought to be not so large then as now, and\r\none half of it was not enough for so small a kingdom which had boasted\r\nso great a navigator as Prince Henry. It was not their own side, but\r\nthe other side, that troubled the Portuguese, fearing as they did that\r\nthe opposite meridian threw into Spain's half a part or the whole of\r\nIndia. So Spain and Portugal fell to quarrelling over this partition\r\nby his Holiness; and the matter was referred to a commission, and\r\nfinally settled by the treaty of Tordesillas in June, 1494, which moved\r\nthe line 270 leagues farther west. About the location of this line of\r\ndemarcation, and its effect on Brazil, and the Moluccas, much has been\r\nwritten, though little has been said as to the motive that prompted\r\nPortugal in making this change. The fact is, that at a time when the\r\nSpice Islands were but vaguely known, and the existence of Brazil not\r\neven suspected, it is impossible to conceive why Portugal desired to\r\nchange the partition line from 100 leagues to 370 leagues west of the\r\nAzores; for the change could only diminish the possessions of Portugal\r\nin India by 270 leagues, as in truth it did, including the Moluccas\r\nin the loss, and gaining in return 270 leagues of open Atlantic sea!\r\nTrue, there proved to be an accidental gain of a part of Brazil, but\r\nthere could have been no idea at the time that this partition line\r\ncut through any eastern portion of lands discovered by Columbus to the\r\nwest. In whatever light we imagine them to have regarded it, there is\r\nstill an unexplained mystery. The Pacific ocean was unknown; between the\r\ndiscoveries of Spain and Portugal, so far as known, all was land—India.\r\nBy carrying the partition line westward, Portugal may have thought to\r\nfind some western land; at all events, it is generally believed that the\r\neffect of the partition in the antipodes was not well considered; that\r\nthe only point in question was the right of making discoveries in the\r\nwestern ocean, and that the treaty of Tordesillas was decided in favor\r\nof Spain—Portugal being forced to yield the main point, but insisting on\r\nthe change of partition in order to give her more sea-room. On the other\r\nhand it may be claimed that the antipodes, of which they knew so little,\r\nwere the avowed object of all the expeditions sent out by both parties.\r\nSee the original bull and treaty in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom.\r\nii. pp. 28, 130; also _Prescott's Ferdinand and Isabella_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n173-83; _Calvo_, _Recueil Complet des Traités_, Paris, 1862, tom. i. pp.\r\n1-36; _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. i. booke ii. pp. 13-15; _Curious\r\nand Ent. Voy._, p. 20; _Cancellieri_, _Notizie di Colombo_, p. 183.\r\n\r\nItaly, and especially Venice, as we have seen, was the first of the\r\nEuropean states to display in any marked degree in mediæval times that\r\ncommercial spirit so early and so well developed in the Phœnicians.\r\nPortugal caught the flame under John the Great, 1385-1433, and led the\r\nvan of a more daring discovery and exploration by conquests on the\r\nnorth-west coast of Africa. Simultaneously Prince Henry was sending\r\nexpeditions farther down the western coast of Africa, and among the\r\nislands of the Atlantic. His country reaped the reward in 1486, when\r\nthe discovery of the Cape of Good Hope opened her a way by sea to\r\nHindostan, and to the commerce of the Orient, and gave at the same time\r\nthe death-blow to Venetian ascendancy in that market.\r\n\r\nBut Spain, as chance would have it, did not lag far behind her sister\r\nkingdom. The fact of the great navigators, Columbus and Vespucci, being\r\nItalians, and yet having to seek assistance of Spain, sufficiently\r\nindicates in what direction the swing of maritime power was tending.\r\nThe astronomical schools of Córdova, Seville, and Granada had well\r\nprepared Spain for the application of astronomy to navigation, and the\r\nlong internal wars had bred those bold and enduring spirits who alone\r\nare fitted to conduct with success great enterprises of certain danger\r\nand uncertain result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some that John and Sebastian Cabot made their first\r\nvoyage and discovered Newfoundland in 1494. The claim rests on a\r\nstatement of the Spanish ambassador to England in a letter dated July\r\n25, 1498, to the effect that during the past seven years several vessels\r\nhad been sent each year from Bristol in search of Brasil and the Islands\r\nof the Seven Cities, and on an inscription on Sebastian Cabot's map\r\nof 1544, which states that land was first discovered by the Cabots on\r\nJune 24, 1494. _D'Avesac_, _Letter on the Voyages of John and Sebastian\r\nCabot_, in _Kohl_, pp. 506-7. But other authors consider the map—even\r\nif made by Cabot, which is extremely doubtful—insufficient authority to\r\nprove such a voyage.\r\n\r\n[1495.] At the solicitation of the brothers Pinzon and other navigators,\r\na license was granted April 10, 1495, permitting any native-born\r\nSpaniard to make private voyages for trade and discovery from Cádiz\r\nto the Western India; such expeditions to be under the inspection\r\nof government, one of whose officials was to accompany each vessel\r\nto ensure the payment to the crown of one tenth of the profit of the\r\nvoyage. For this document in full, see _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_,\r\ntom. ii. p. 165. See also _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp. 356 et\r\nseq. Whether any one actually took advantage of this license before its\r\nrepeal—which was on June 2, 1497, at the instigation of Columbus—is a\r\ndisputed point of some importance in connection with certain doubtful\r\nexpeditions to be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\n[1496.] Pedro Alonso Niño sailed from Cádiz June 17, 1496, just after\r\nthe return of Columbus, in command of three vessels laden with supplies\r\nfor the colony at Española.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMERIGO VESPUCCI.]\r\n\r\n[1497.] Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine navigator, claims to have set\r\nsail from Cádiz with four vessels in the service of the king of Spain on\r\nthe tenth, or twentieth, of May, 1497. In what capacity he accompanied\r\nthe expedition, or who was its commander, he does not state, but says\r\nthat he was chosen by the king to go with the expedition. \"Me ad talia\r\ninvestiganda in ipsam societatem elegit.\" Sailing south-south-west to\r\nthe Canaries, 280 leagues from Lisbon, he remained there eight days, and\r\nthen sailed west-one-quarter-south-west 1,000 leagues in twenty-seven,\r\nor thirty-seven, days, to a point on the main-land in 16° north and 75°\r\nwest of the Canaries—that is to say, on the coast of Central America\r\nnear Cape Gracias á Dios. This must have been about the 1st of July,\r\nsome days perhaps after Cabot's landing farther north, which was the\r\n24th of June. The Spaniards went ashore in boats, but the natives\r\nwere too timid to trade; so that continuing their voyage for two days\r\nnorth-west in sight of the flat coast, they reached a more secure\r\nanchorage, established friendly relations with the people, and found\r\nsome traces of gold. The ships then followed the coast for several\r\ndays, to a port where was found a village built over the water like\r\nVenice, and there fought with the natives (of Tabasco?); sailed eighty\r\nleagues along the coast to a region of many rivers (Pánuco?), where\r\nthey were kindly received by people of a different language, and made a\r\njourney of eighteen leagues inland, visiting many towns. This province\r\nwas called by the inhabitants Lariab, and is situated in the torrid\r\nzone, near the tropic of Cancer, in 23° north. Again they started,\r\npursued a north-west course and frequently anchored, sailing thus 870\r\nleagues, until after thirteen months, that is to say in June, 1498,\r\nthey reached \"the best harbor in the world\" (port of Cape Cañaveral?),\r\nin 28° 30', where they resolved to repair their ships for the return\r\nvoyage. There they remained thirty-seven days, and when about to depart,\r\nthe natives complained of certain cannibals who came each year from\r\nan island 100 leagues distant to attack them. The Spaniards, in return\r\nfor their kindness, promised to avenge their wrongs. Accordingly they\r\nsailed north-east and east to a group of islands, some of which were\r\ninhabited (Bermudas?); landing at one of them called Ity, they defeated\r\nthe cannibals, and made 250 prisoners, with a loss of one man killed\r\nand twenty-two wounded. Returning, they arrived at Cádiz October 15,\r\n1499, with 222 prisoners, who were sold as slaves. The above is the\r\naccount given by Vespucci in a letter written in 1504, according to\r\nthe edition adopted as authentic and original by Varnhagen, _Le premier\r\nVoyage de Amerigo Vespucci_, who believes that Vicente Yañez Pinzon and\r\nJuan Diaz de Solis were the commanders. This voyage is not generally\r\nregarded as authentic; and a long and complicated discussion has arisen\r\non the question whether the account given is to be regarded as true,\r\nas wholly a fabrication, or as belonging to a subsequent voyage and\r\naccidentally or intentionally dated back two years. As this voyage, if\r\nactually made as claimed by M. Varnhagen, would be the first to touch\r\nthe territory which I denominate the Pacific States, I find it necessary\r\nto give in this place the leading points in the discussion. In what\r\nmay be called the standard authorities on American discovery, such as\r\nNavarrete, Humboldt, and others, is found fully presented the question\r\nof the authenticity of Vespucci's voyage, always, however, under the\r\nsupposition that the land claimed to have been visited was the coast\r\nof Paria. The theory of M. Varnhagen, that that region must be sought\r\nin North America, reopens the question and introduces some new features\r\nwhich cannot be passed by unnoticed in this connection. Without entering\r\nupon the somewhat complicated bibliography of Vespucci's narrations, or\r\ntaking up the question of his claims in the matter of naming America,\r\nI shall attempt to state briefly, and as clearly as I am able, the\r\narguments for and against the authenticity of a voyage, in which perhaps\r\nis involved the question of the first post-Scandinavian discovery of\r\nthe North American continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DISPUTED VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI.]\r\n\r\nBesides Vespucci's own statement, in a letter written in 1504, no\r\ncontemporary document has been found which mentions such an expedition,\r\nthough most diligent search for such documents has been made in the\r\nSpanish archives by partisans and opponents of the Florentine's claim.\r\nThis absence of confirmatory documents is the more noticeable as the\r\nexpedition was made under royal patronage. In another and previously\r\nwritten letter describing his second voyage in 1499, Vespucci not only\r\nmakes no mention of this voyage, but even excuses his long silence by\r\nsaying that nothing had occurred worth relating. True, a short letter\r\nof one Vianello, dated 1506, published by Humboldt, mentions a voyage\r\nto which no date is given, made by Vespucci in company with Juan de la\r\nCosa. M. Varnhagen supposes this to have been the voyage in question,\r\nand a large river discovered at the time to have been the Mississippi;\r\nbut, beside the fact that there is no reason for attributing the date\r\nof 1497 rather than any other to this voyage, Vianello's letter, with\r\ntwo others, published by Harrisse, indicates a much later date for the\r\nexpedition with Juan de la Cosa.\r\n\r\nMoreover, not only is there a want of original records, but contemporary\r\nhistorians are silent respecting this expedition; the first mention by\r\nlater writers being a denial of its authenticity when it was thought\r\nto conflict with the admiral's claims as discoverer of the continent.\r\nYet, on the supposition of a voyage to the North American coast, there\r\nare some passages in the historians Peter Martyr, Oviedo, Gomara, and\r\nHerrera, which point more or less definitely to an exploration of the\r\ngulf of Honduras before 1502. Peter Martyr, dec. i. cap. vi., writing\r\nbefore 1508, says that many claim to have sailed round Cuba; and later,\r\ndec. i. cap. x., he mentions a report that Pinzon and Solis had explored\r\nthe coast of Honduras, giving, however, no dates. Oviedo, _Hist.\r\nGen._, tom. ii. p. 140, says positively that the gulf of Honduras was\r\ndiscovered not by Columbus, but by Pinzon and Solis, and that before\r\nthe former discovered the Amazon, or the latter the Rio de la Plata,\r\nthat is to say before 1499. Gomara, _Hist. de las Indias_, fol. 63,\r\nstates that Pinzon and Solis are said by some to have explored the\r\ncoast of Honduras three years before Columbus, which would make it in\r\n1499. Herrera, _Hist. Gen._, dec. iv. lib. viii. cap. iii., says that\r\nthe gulf of Honduras was named Hibueras from the gourds found floating\r\nin its waters by the first Spaniards who sailed along the coast. To M.\r\nVarnhagen, this it may be random remark of Herrera is proof positive\r\nthat as Columbus did not enter or name the gulf, he was not the first\r\nSpaniard who sailed along the coast. Whatever weight may be attached to\r\nthese passages from the historians, in proving a voyage to North America\r\nprevious to that of the admiral, such evidence is manifestly increased\r\nby the fact that the date of the voyage attributed to Pinzon and Solis\r\nseems to rest entirely on the statement of Herrera, _Hist. Gen._, dec.\r\ni. lib. vi. cap. xvi., who describes the expedition with other events\r\nunder the date of 1506. Yet in the testimony in the lawsuit hereinafter\r\nto be mentioned, it is implied, though not expressly stated, that the\r\nvoyage was after that of Columbus, since special pains was taken by\r\nthe king to prove the coast explored by Pinzon to be distinct from that\r\ndiscovered by the admiral. Another point is that in this same testimony\r\nthe name 'Caria' is given to a place visited during Pinzon's voyage,\r\nand for this name Vespucci's 'Lariab' may possibly be a misprint.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. pp. 59, 267, 272-4, repeatedly states\r\nit as an undeniable fact that Vespucci was employed in Spain in fitting\r\nout the vessels for the third voyage of Columbus, up to the date of the\r\nsailing of the expedition, May 30, 1498, and consequently could not\r\nhimself have sailed in May or any other month of 1497. He makes this\r\nstatement on the authority of documents collected by Muñoz. Harrisse,\r\n_Bib. Am. Vet._, p. 57, states, also on the authority of Muñoz, that\r\nfrom April, 1497, to May 30, 1498, Vespucci was \"constantly travelling\r\nfrom Seville to San Lúcar.\" Vespucci is known to have succeeded Juanoto\r\nBerardi, who died in December, 1495, in a contract to fit out vessels\r\nfor the Spanish government, and to have received money on account of\r\nthat contract on the 12th of January, 1496. Irving, with access to the\r\ndocuments of Muñoz, says that four caravels fitted out by Vespucci\r\nsailed February 3, 1496, but were driven back; and he speaks of no\r\nevidence of his presence in Spain in 1497 or 1498. Navarrete, relying\r\non the same Muñoz documents—which consist of extracts from the books of\r\nexpenses of Indian armadas in the Casa de Contratacion in Seville—gives\r\nno date to the sailing and wreck of the four vessels mentioned by\r\nIrving, but implies that the event took place before Berardi's death.\r\nAfter speaking of the receipt of money on the 12th of January, 1496,\r\nhe states that Vespucci \"went on attending to everything until the\r\narmada was despatched from San Lúcar.\" _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. p.\r\n317. He does not state that the fleet thus fitted out was that in which\r\nColumbus sailed in 1498. Muñoz in the printed portion of his work is\r\nsilent on the subject. Varnhagen, _Vespuce et son Premier Voy._, p. 18,\r\nargues that Humboldt had no authority whatever for applying Navarrete's\r\nstatement respecting the armada despatched from San Lúcar to the\r\nadmiral's fleet, that statement having probably been his authority, and\r\nnot the original documents of Muñoz; and that the four vessels whose\r\nfitting-out Vespucci personally superintended were much more probably\r\nthose in which he himself sailed and made the voyage in question.\r\nVarnhagen furthermore thinks that the death of Berardi furnished a\r\nreasonable motive for the resolution formed by Vespucci to visit the\r\nIndies, and a favorable opportunity for carrying out his resolution. If\r\nit can be proved that Vespucci was in Spain in 1497 and 1498, of course\r\nthe question of his claimed voyage admits of no farther discussion;\r\nbut if Humboldt's only authority be his interpretation of Navarrete's\r\nstatement, even if the interpretation be not unnatural or improbable,\r\nthe matter must still be considered doubtful until the original Muñoz\r\ndocuments are produced.\r\n\r\nThe silence of contemporary documents respecting Vespucci's voyage\r\ncarries the greater weight from the fact that there are special reasons\r\nfor the existence of such documents, if the voyage had been actually\r\nmade. In 1508 a suit was begun by Diego Colon against the Spanish\r\ncrown for the government of certain territory claimed by virtue of\r\nthe discovery of Paria by his father, the admiral. The suit continued\r\nto 1513, and every effort was made by the crown to prove a previous\r\ndiscovery of the coast in question; hundreds of witnesses were examined,\r\nand their testimony has been preserved and published in Navarrete's\r\ncollection. In this suit Vespucci was not summoned as a witness,\r\nalthough much of the time in royal employ, having held the office of\r\n_piloto mayor_ from 1508 to his death in 1512. No claim was advanced\r\nfor his discovery, although the voyage is stated to have been made\r\nunder royal patronage, and by proving its authenticity the crown would\r\nhave gained its object. Indeed, Vespucci's name is only mentioned once\r\nin all the testimony, and that as having accompanied Alonso de Ojeda\r\nin his voyage of 1499. That no one of the many witnesses examined knew\r\nof Vespucci's voyage in 1497, if it were a fact, is hardly possible.\r\nNot only were the witnesses silent on the Florentine's expedition, but\r\nmany of them, including Ojeda, affirmed that Paria was first discovered\r\nby Columbus, and next afterward by Ojeda himself. Now as Vespucci\r\naccompanied Ojeda, the latter would surely have known of any previous\r\ndiscovery by Vespucci, and as Ojeda was not friendly to Columbus he\r\ncertainly would have made the fact known. Moreover, the admiral's\r\ncharts and sailing-directions were followed by Ojeda in his voyage,\r\nwhich would hardly have been done with a skilful pilot like Vespucci\r\non board, and one who had visited the coast before. True, this last\r\npoint would have little weight if the coast of Paria was not the region\r\nvisited by Vespucci, while the other points would be little if at all\r\naffected by the theory that North America was the coast explored. No\r\nother Spanish voyage to the new region was neglected; indeed, to have\r\nso completely disregarded Vespucci's expedition, it must be supposed\r\nthat the king not only knew exactly what region he explored, but had a\r\npositive conviction that said region was entirely distinct from Paria;\r\nand we have seen that no such definite opinion was held at the time, but\r\non the contrary, special pains was taken to prove that the new regions\r\nwere \"all one coast.\" When it is considered that Vespucci's voyage, that\r\nis the voyage of Pinzon and Solis, was mentioned in the testimony, the\r\nfailure to summon the piloto mayor appears all the more remarkable. What\r\nmore efficient witness could have been brought forward? Thus the silence\r\nof the testimony in this suit on the question under discussion, must\r\nbe deemed something more than mere negative proof, as it is termed by\r\nM. Varnhagen. This gentleman also notes that only one witness mentions\r\nthat Vespucci accompanied Ojeda in 1499; but he does not note that the\r\npresence of Vespucci on Ojeda's ships was of no importance to either\r\nparty in the suit, while a previous discovery by him was of the very\r\ngreatest importance to the crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESPUCCI'S VOYAGE FURTHER CONSIDERED.]\r\n\r\nThe date of sailing from Cádiz is given by different editions of\r\nVespucci's letter as May 10, and May 20, 1497; and of his return as\r\nOctober 1, 15, and 18, 1499. From these dates two difficulties arise;\r\nfirst, the duration of the voyage is stated in the letter to have been\r\neighteen months, while the period between the dates of sailing and\r\nreturn is twenty-nine months; and again, Vespucci is known to have\r\nsailed with Ojeda in May, 1499, that is, five months before he returned\r\nfrom the voyage in question. One way of reconciling the first difficulty\r\nis to suppose that the author reckoned time by the Florentine method,\r\nthen common in familiar correspondence, according to which the year\r\nbegan the 25th of March. Then in case of a very natural misprint in\r\nthe original of May for March, the voyage really began in 1498, its\r\nduration being thus reduced to nineteen months. A more simple method of\r\nremoving both difficulties is to suppose a misprint of 1499 for 1498\r\nas the date of the return; this would reduce the time to seventeen\r\nmonths. Several later editions have made this change. The edition\r\nclaimed as original by M. Varnhagen has the date 1499 according to his\r\ntranslation, and strangely enough the editor makes no allusion to it in\r\nhis notes, although in a former pamphlet he speaks of 1498 as the date\r\nof the return. I attach very little weight to discrepancies in dates\r\nin this relation except as evidence against any intentional deception\r\non the part of Vespucci. Confusion in dates is common in all relations\r\nof the period; and Vespucci's letters were written hastily, not for\r\npublication, and merely to interest his correspondents by a description\r\nof the marvels he had seen in his New World adventures. It may here be\r\nstated that the long and bitterly argued question of the rival claims of\r\nVespucci and Columbus in the matter of naming America has no bearing on\r\nthe present discussion. There is no evidence that the voyage in question\r\nhad any influence in fixing the name America; and to pronounce this\r\nexpedition not authentic has no tendency to weaken Vespucci's reputation\r\nfor honesty, which may now be considered fully established; nor do the\r\narguments against intentional falsification on Vespucci's part tend to\r\nprove the voyage authentic.\r\n\r\nSeveral coincidences between the narratives of this voyage and that\r\nof Ojeda have led many writers to conclude that both describe the same\r\nexpedition, the dates having been accidentally or intentionally changed.\r\nHumboldt, after a careful examination, was convinced that the two\r\nvoyages were identical. But when we consider that Humboldt, Navarrete,\r\nand Irving formed their conclusions without a suspicion of a voyage\r\nto North America, and before that question had ever once arisen; that\r\nNavarrete severely criticises Vespucci's narrative as applied to Ojeda's\r\nvoyage; that two of the strongest coincidences—the mention of Paria as\r\nthe coast visited, and the discovery of a town built over the water like\r\nVenice—have no weight in view of the new theory, since the province is\r\ncalled Lariab in the original edition, and that method of building was\r\nnot uncommon in all the tropical regions of America, it must be admitted\r\nthat this argument has by itself little force against the authenticity\r\nof Vespucci's voyage.\r\n\r\nThe right granted to private individuals by the Spanish government in\r\nApril, 1495, to make voyages of discovery at their own expense, subject\r\nto certain regulations, was partially revoked in June, 1497, after\r\nVespucci's claimed departure. All authorities agree that during this\r\ntime such private voyages, or even clandestine expeditions, may have\r\nbeen and probably were made, of which no records have been preserved.\r\nIt is argued that Vespucci's voyage may have been of this number,\r\nalthough claimed to have been made under royal patronage, and by no\r\nmeans clandestine. It is even suggested that the revocation of the right\r\nof private navigation, brought about by the influence of Columbus, was\r\npurposely delayed until after Vespucci's departure—all of which proves,\r\nif it proves anything, simply that there was nothing to prevent Vespucci\r\nfrom making the voyage.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how certain statements of the old chroniclers may be taken\r\nas indicative of a voyage along the Central American coast previous\r\nto that of Columbus. There are also similar indications in some of the\r\nearly maps. Thus Juan de la Cosa's map representing Cuba as an island\r\nin 1500 (see page 115 this volume) might be accounted for by such a\r\nvoyage as Vespucci claims to have made. It will be seen hereafter that\r\nearly maps show some slight traces of a knowledge of Florida before its\r\ndiscovery in 1512 (pp. 128-9 this vol.) In the Ruysch map of 1508 (p.\r\n126 this vol.) the eastern coast of what seems to be Cuba is identified\r\nby M. Varnhagen with the main-land; in his opinion the inscription at\r\nthe north point of that coast refers directly to Vespucci's expedition,\r\nand 'Cape S. Marci' at the southern point may indicate Vespucci's\r\narrival on Saint Mark's day, especially as his uncle was a priest of\r\nthe order of St Mark. If this appears somewhat far-fetched, perhaps\r\nmore weight should be attached to the name 'Cape Doffin de Abril' on\r\nthe southern point of what may be Florida on the Ptolemy map of 1513 (p.\r\n130 this vol.), for at the end of April Vespucci may, according to his\r\nnarrative, have been at that point. On this matter of an early voyage it\r\nmay be noted that Columbus, striking the coast at Guanaja Island in 1502\r\nin search of a passage westward, instead of following westward, as he\r\nnaturally would have done, at least to the head of the gulf of Honduras,\r\nturned directly east. A knowledge on his part that Vespucci had already\r\nexplored westward and northward without finding a passage, would account\r\nfor his actions. But they have already been satisfactorily accounted for\r\nby the fact that he simply proposed to sail along the sinuosities of the\r\nsupposed southern coasts of Asia to India, rather than to penetrate any\r\nintervening continent, whose existence he did not suspect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the leading arguments for and against the voyage in\r\nquestion, the following minor points are urged:\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that the command of such an expedition would not have been\r\ngiven to a foreigner, and Vespucci did not become a naturalized citizen\r\nof Spain until 1505. But on the other hand, if Vespucci had rendered no\r\nother service to Spain than to have accompanied Ojeda, he would hardly\r\nhave received so many favors from the government, especially after\r\nhaving served four years under the king of Portugal.\r\n\r\nSeñor Navarrete finds a difficulty in Vespucci's claim to have brought\r\nback to Spain 222 slaves in the few small vessels under his command.\r\nVespucci also speaks of Ferdinand as king of Castile, which it was not\r\ncustomary to do until after Isabella's death.\r\n\r\nThe high opinion held of Vespucci during his life by Columbus and his\r\nzealous friends is of little weight, because the admiral's claim to\r\nhave discovered the supposed Asiatic continent or islands adjacent\r\nthereto was undoubted; but the favorable opinions expressed by later\r\nwriters, especially by Fernando Colon, writing after America was known\r\nto be distinct from Asia, tend to prove that the Florentine made in\r\nhis lifetime no claim to a voyage in 1497. Yet the publication and\r\ncirculation of his letter in several languages, uncontradicted for\r\nyears, would indicate its authenticity, unless it be taken as a sign\r\nof carelessness for dates and details so long as they were not supposed\r\nto conflict with the admiral's claims. It must also be remembered that\r\nthe same voyager's second, third, and fourth expeditions have all been\r\ndisputed and have at last proved authentic.\r\n\r\nM. Varnhagen applies to Vespucci and his men the well-known tradition\r\nrelated by Sahagun and others of white men who appeared at Pánuco from\r\nthe east before the coming of the Spaniards. He also supposes Guerrero,\r\nthe soldier found by Cortés at Cozumel, and believed by other authors\r\nto have been a survivor with Aguilar of Valdivia's shipwreck in 1512,\r\nto have been left in Yucatan by Vespucci; but he gives no reason for\r\nthis belief, except that Guerrero had married among the natives, and\r\nhad adopted many of their customs. By the same writer it is thought much\r\nmore likely that Cape Gracias á Dios was named by Vespucci after a long\r\nvoyage in search of land, than by Columbus after following the coast a\r\nfew days and taking possession; especially as Columbus in his own letter\r\nsimply mentions his arrival at the cape, the fact of his having given\r\nthe name coming from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe events of the voyage, and the description of the coast visited\r\nby Vespucci as given in his letter, furnish no evidence whatever for\r\nor against the authenticity of the expedition; but if it be admitted\r\nfrom outside evidence that the voyage was actually made, and was\r\ndistinct from that of Ojeda, while the narrative has nothing except the\r\noccurrence of the name Paria in favor of a South American destination,\r\nfrom it may be gathered the following points in support of the theory\r\nthat a more northern coast was the one explored. The course sailed\r\nfrom the Canaries, W. ¼ SW.; the time thirty-seven days; the distance\r\n1,000 leagues, taking the distance from Lisbon to the Canaries, 280\r\nleagues, as a scale of measurement; the latitude of the landing 16°,\r\nand longitude 75° west of the Canaries; and the arrival by sailing up\r\nthe coast at a province situated in about 23°, and near the tropic of\r\nCancer, are worthy of consideration, since a series of blunders such\r\nas these is hardly probable. The natives of Lariab were of different\r\nlanguage from and hostile to the nations passed further south, as the\r\nHuastecs of the Pánuco region are known to have been with respect to\r\nthe Mexicans. Moreover, Lariab has a slight claim to being a Huastec\r\nword, since Orozco y Berra gives three names of places in that language\r\ncontaining an _l_ and ending in _ab_; but of course this would interfere\r\nsadly with the theory that Lariab is a misprint of Caria. Vespucci's\r\ndescription of the natives, criticised by Navarrete as incorrect when\r\napplied to the people of Paria, agrees better, as M. Varnhagen thinks,\r\nwith the aborigines of Honduras. Other parts of Vespucci's vague and\r\nrambling descriptions apply well enough to the North American coasts,\r\nor in fact to any part of tropical America, north or south.\r\n\r\nThe application of the narrative to North America is not, however,\r\nwithout its difficulties. Vespucci makes no mention of the Antilles,\r\nthrough which his course must have led him; perhaps not seeing them\r\nby reason of fog; or he had instructions not to concern himself with\r\nwhat the admiral had already discovered. He also refers to a larger\r\nwork, never published, in which details were to be given. Neither does\r\nhe mention the prominent peninsulas of Yucatan and Florida, nor the\r\nlofty mountain peaks which he would naturally have seen in following\r\nthe Mexican coast. He claims to have sailed north-west from Pánuco 870\r\nleagues (over dry land?) to the best harbor in the world. M. Varnhagen's\r\nexplanation of this difficulty is that Vespucci simply states\r\nincidentally that he left Pánuco \"tuttavia verso il Maestrale\" still\r\ntoward the north-west, not intending to include in this course the whole\r\nvoyage of 870 leagues. All the windings of the coast and the entering\r\nand leaving of many ports or rivers must be taken into account to make\r\nup a distance of 870 leagues between Pánuco and Cape Cañaveral; and the\r\nlatter port would hardly be considered the 'best harbor in the world'\r\nexcept by a great stretch of the imagination, or by a navigator little\r\nacquainted with good harbors. The archipelago of Ity has generally been\r\nsupposed to be Hayti, but there is probably no reason for the identity\r\nbeyond the resemblance of names. The Bermudas when discovered in 1522\r\nwere uninhabited, but this does not prove that they were always so; the\r\nSpaniards may have returned and captured the people for slaves. Indeed\r\nthe Bermudas may have been the archipelago of San Bernardo, famous\r\nfor its fierce Carib population, but generally located off the gulf of\r\nUrabá. It may even have been named by Vespucci, for on San Bernardo's\r\nday, the 20th of August, he was probably there.\r\n\r\nThus have I given, and let me hope without prejudice, the arguments for\r\nand against this disputed voyage; and from the evidence the reader may\r\ndraw his own conclusions. To me the proofs seem conclusive that Vespucci\r\nmade no voyage to South America prior to 1499, when he accompanied\r\nAlonso de Ojeda. Against a North American expedition the evidence,\r\nif less conclusive, is still very strong; since the most that can be\r\nclaimed in its favor is a probability that the Central American coast\r\nwas visited by some navigator before 1502, and a possibility, though\r\ncertainly a very slim one, that Vespucci accompanied such navigation.\r\n\r\nOn this voyage see _Navigationum Alberici Vesputii Epitome_, in\r\n_Grynæus_, _Novus Orbis_, pp. 122, 155; _Varnhagen_, _Le Premier\r\nVoyage de Vespucci_; Id., _Vespuce et son Prem.

Following the brilliant\r\nsuccess of Spain, England was the first nation to attempt discovery\r\nto the westward. Fully acquainted with the achievements and hypotheses\r\nof Columbus, having been indeed almost persuaded by him to embrace his\r\nbeliefs, King Henry VII. on the 5th of March, 1496, granted a license\r\nto John Cabot, a Venetian citizen and trader of Bristol, to attempt\r\ndiscoveries in that direction.\r\n\r\nEither from respect for Portuguese and Spanish rights in the south, or\r\nfrom some vague hints received from the Northmen during their trading\r\nvoyages to Iceland, or possibly from a dim idea of the advantages of\r\ngreat-circle sailing, the English determined to attempt reaching India\r\nby a northern route. This expedition of Cabot's, with perhaps several\r\nvessels, sailed from Bristol probably in May, 1497; discovered land the\r\n24th of June on the coast of Labrador between 56° and 58°; sailed some\r\n300 leagues in a direction not known, but probably northward; and one\r\nvessel, the _Matthew_, returned to Bristol in August of the same year.\r\nNo further details of the voyage are known, and those given, which are\r\nthe conclusions of Humboldt, Kohl, and Stevens, have all been disputed\r\nin respect to date, commander, and point of landing. D'Avesac, as we\r\nhave seen (pp. 98-9), insists on a previous voyage in 1494. Biddle,\r\n_Memoir of Sebastian Cabot_, London, 1831, p. 42 et seq., claims that\r\nSebastian Cabot was the commander. Robinson, _Account of Discov. in\r\nthe West_, Richmond, 1848, pp. 81-93, explains that by a change in the\r\nmethod of reckoning time after 1752, the date should properly read 1498.\r\nMany authors moreover confound this voyage with a later one. _Hakluyt's\r\nVoy._, vol. iii. pp. 4-11; _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 87-9; _Viages\r\nMenores_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. pp. 40-1. Irving, _Columbus_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 316, names but one voyage and regards the accounts as\r\n\"vague and scanty.\" See also _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp.\r\n279, 313; _Hakluyt Soc._, _Divers Voy._, pp. lxviii., 19-26; _Kohl's\r\nHist.

Trading somewhat,\r\njealous of everybody, after quarrelling with Arabian merchants and\r\nfailing to make good his arbitrary measures, he thought best to return.\r\nAccordingly he set sail the 29th of August, passed the cape March 20,\r\n1499, and reached Lisbon about the end of August. Thus Gama was the\r\nfirst to accomplish the grand object of so many efforts, and to reach\r\nIndia by water. His achievement would doubtless have been regarded as\r\nthe most glorious on record, both to himself and to Portugal, had not\r\nColumbus for Spain reached the same continent, as he supposed, farther\r\neast several years before. _Navigatione di Vasco di Gama_, in _Ramusio_,\r\ntom. i. fol. 130; _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 93-4; _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\nde Viages_, tom. i. pp. xli.-ii.; _Major's Prince Henry_, pp. 391-406;\r\n_Voyages, Curious and Entertaining_, p. 103; _Leben der See-Helden_, p.\r\n40; _Notizie di Vasquez di Gama_, in _Cancellieri_, _Notizie_, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[1498.] After the return of the Cabots in August, 1497, with the news\r\nof having discovered the northern regions of Cathay, King Henry issued\r\na new patent dated February 3, 1498, and, probably in May of the same\r\nyear, two vessels with 300 men sailed from Bristol under command of\r\nSebastian Cabot. Little is known of the voyage, save that he reached\r\nthe coast of Labrador, which he followed northward until at a certain\r\npoint where the coast trends eastward he found much ice even in July.\r\nThis northern limit is placed by Ramusio at latitude 56°; by Gomara,\r\nwho states that Cabot himself gives a much higher latitude, at 58°;\r\nby Galvano, at above 60°. Kohl follows Humboldt in the opinion that\r\nit was 67° 30', which would place it on the Cumberland peninsula.\r\nCabot then turned southward and sailed as near shore as possible. The\r\nsouthern limit of this voyage is more indefinite than the northern.\r\nIn a conversation with Peter Martyr, prior to 1515, Cabot stated that\r\nhe reached the latitude of Gibraltar, and the chronicler adds that he\r\nsailed so far west that he had Cuba on his left. Cabot's remark would\r\nplace him in latitude 36°, near Cape Hatteras, while Martyr's addition\r\nmight apply to any locality on the east coast. Martyr's statement is\r\nthe only authority for the supposition by Humboldt and others—see\r\n_Exam. Crit._, tom. i. p. 313, and Preface to Ghillany—that Cabot\r\nreached Florida. Stevens, _Notes_, pp. 17-19 and 35, considers Peter\r\nMartyr's remark as absurd, since it would place Cabot near Cincinnati.\r\nHe is satisfied that the southern limit was the gulf of St Lawrence,\r\nfounding this belief on maps of 1500 (see p. 115 this vol.) and 1508\r\n(p. 126 this vol.), 1514, and 1544, the latter said to have been\r\nmade by Cabot himself. That Cabot did not reach the southern coast of\r\nthe United States seems proved by the fact that he was in Spain from\r\n1513 to 1524, holding high positions, including that of piloto mayor,\r\nwhile that coast was actually being explored, and he making no claim\r\nto a previous discovery. The point reached, therefore, must remain\r\nundetermined between Cape Hatteras, where Kohl fixes it, and the gulf\r\nof St Lawrence, with a strong probability, as I think, in favor of\r\nthe latter. Nothing whatever is known of the route or date of Cabot's\r\nreturn. And it is to be remembered that concerning this voyage we have\r\nonly one contemporary document, which is a letter dated in 1498, stating\r\nsimply that the expedition was still absent. All additional details are\r\nfrom accounts written after the geography of the New World was better\r\nknown in consequence of the discovery of the South Sea. Nothing, then,\r\ncan be proved by Cabot's voyages beyond the discovery of the continent\r\nin June, 1497, and the exploration of the coast from the gulf of St\r\nLawrence to above 60° in 1498. The statement of Asher, _Life of Henry\r\nHudson_, London, 1860, that Cabot \"was the first to recognize that a\r\nnew and unknown continent was lying as one vast barrier between western\r\nEurope and eastern Asia,\" accepted also by Kohl, _Hist. Discov._, p.\r\n145, appears to me utterly without foundation. Cabot's complaint that\r\na new-found land—that is a land further north and east than any part of\r\nAsia described by Polo—was a barrier to his reaching India, and the fact\r\nthat on a map made as late as 1544, and doubtfully attributed to him,\r\na separate continent is shown, seem weak authority for according him so\r\nimportant a discovery, especially when other voyagers and geographers,\r\nintimate with him and fully acquainted with his discoveries, continued\r\nfor many years to join those discoveries to the Asiatic continent.\r\nSee, beside references on page 107, _Peter Martyr_, dec. iii. cap.\r\nvi.; _Gomara_, _Hist.

The voyage had not\r\nbeen profitable, had not been fruitful enough in gold to satisfy the\r\nadventurers who accompanied him, and the ghastly faces of the mariners\r\nmore than counteracted the effect of the specimens of native products\r\nexhibited. It was difficult, therefore, to obtain men for a new\r\nenterprise. Still, notwithstanding the reports of his numerous enemies,\r\nthe admiral was considerately treated at court, and finally, by the\r\nefforts of the queen, six vessels were made ready, and Columbus embarked\r\nfrom San Lúcar on a third voyage May 30, 1498. This time he determined\r\nto steer farther to the south than before, in order to reach, as he\r\nsupposed, the richer parts of Asia. After touching at Madeira, Porto\r\nSanto, and the Canaries, he divided his fleet, sent three vessels direct\r\nto Española, and with the other three reached the Cape Verde Islands\r\nthe 27th of June. Thence he sailed first south-west and west through\r\nthe region of tropical calms, and then northward to Trinidad Island,\r\nwhere he arrived the 31st of July. Coasting the island on the south, in\r\nsight of the main-land, he entered the gulf of Paria, landed, and found\r\nmuch gold of an inferior quality, and an abundance of pearls; from which\r\ncircumstance, that land, which was the northern end of South America,\r\nwas for some time thereafter known as the Pearl Coast. Passing out by\r\nthe Boca del Drago on the 14th of August, he followed the northern coast\r\nof Paria to the island of Cubagua, beginning to suspect meanwhile that\r\nthe land on his left was the main-land of Asia. Ill health and the state\r\nof his supplies did not permit him to satisfy himself on that point at\r\nthe time, and consequently he turned his course north-west for Española.\r\nOn the 30th of August he arrived at the mouth of the river Ozema, where\r\nhe met his brother Bartolomé, who informed him of the internal discords\r\nand external wars of the colonists. Francisco Roldan had refused to\r\nsubmit to the admiral's authority, and on the 18th of October five ships\r\nwere despatched for Spain with news of the rebellion. By this departure\r\nColumbus sent letters and charts describing this Pearl Coast, as his\r\npresent South American discoveries which yielded so many gems were\r\ncalled. During the whole year following, peace was maintained among the\r\ncolonists only by the most humiliating concessions of Columbus to Roldan\r\nand his crew. On the 5th of September, 1499, Alonso de Ojeda arrived at\r\nEspañola from the Pearl Coast, whither he had been to take advantage of\r\nthe discoveries and misfortunes of the admiral.\r\n\r\nVessels laden with complaints by and against Columbus were despatched\r\nfor Spain in October; needy, ambitious courtiers held King Ferdinand's\r\nwilling ear against him; from his persistent advocacy of Indian\r\nslave-traffic the friendship of his patron, Queen Isabella, grew\r\ncold; and in July, 1500, Francisco de Bobadilla was sent to Española\r\nwith powers to investigate. Arrived at Santo Domingo August 23, the\r\ncommissioner assumed at once authority, which at most was his right\r\nonly after careful and conscientious inquiry, seized Columbus and his\r\nbrother, and in October sent them in irons to Spain. _Colon_, _Hist.\r\ndel Almirante_, in _Barcia_, tom. i. pp. 74-99; _Peter Martyr_, dec. i.\r\ncap. vi.-vii.; _Tercer Viage de Cristobal Colon_, in _Navarrete_, tom.\r\ni. pp. 242-76; _Napione_ and _De Conti_, _Biografia di Colombo_, pp.\r\n350-75; _Cancellieri_, _Notizie di Colombo_, pp. 99-108, where is given\r\nColumbus' letter received in Spain in December, 1498, but apparently\r\nnot printed at the time.\r\n\r\nDuring this third voyage, while about the gulf of Paria, new visions\r\nof the earth's form filled the mind of the great navigator, inflamed\r\nas it was by illness and anxiety. The world was indeed for the most\r\npart spherical, as had been supposed, but in this great central region\r\non the equator he believed the surface to rise gradually to a great\r\nheight, making the earth pear-shape with the terrestrial paradise, or\r\nbirth-place of man, on its apex, the waters and islands visited by him\r\nbeing on the borders of this elevated portion. It is not necessary to\r\nenumerate the natural phenomena, scientific writings, and scripture\r\ntexts with which he confirmed his theory. In his distracted enthusiasm\r\nhe leaves us somewhat uncertain as to his idea of the situation of this\r\nnew region with respect to India proper and those parts of Asia found by\r\nhim in a former voyage farther north. If he had supposed it to be simply\r\na southern extension of Marco Polo's Asia, he would not subsequently\r\nhave sought for a strait or passage to India to the north rather than\r\nto the south of this point. Gama's successful circumnavigation of\r\nAfrica forbade a revival in the mind of Columbus of the old theory of\r\nPtolemy, that Africa extended east and north so as to enclose the Indian\r\nOcean like an immense gulf. The admiral's idea, so far as he formed a\r\ndefinite one on the subject, must have been that of a large island, or\r\ndetached portion of the Asiatic continent, occupying very nearly the\r\nactual relative position of the Australian archipelago, and only vaguely\r\nincluded, if at all, in ancient or mediæval knowledge of the far East.\r\nNo other conclusion could rationally be drawn from his letters and\r\nsubsequent actions; and we shall find such an idea of the geography of\r\nthese parts often repeated in following years. We shall also see how\r\nunfortunate it was for the posthumous glory of the great discoverer in\r\nthe matter of naming the western world, that he did not more clearly\r\nspecify his idea of this new land—for I believe this was the first\r\nsuspicion that new lands of any considerable extent existed—and that his\r\naccount of this and his fourth voyage were not more widely circulated\r\nin print.\r\n\r\n[1499.] The discovery of the Pearl Coast, made known in Spain in\r\nDecember, 1498, caused several expeditions to be sent out in the\r\nfollowing year. These were trading and not exploring voyages, and their\r\ncommanders had no thought of cosmography, caring little whether Paria\r\nwere the terrestrial paradise or the infernal regions, so that pearls,\r\nand gold, and slaves were abundant. No connected journals of these\r\nvoyages have been preserved, our knowledge of them being derived from\r\nstatements of the early historians and from testimony in the famous\r\nlawsuit with the heirs of Columbus, printed in Navarrete's collection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINOR EXPEDITIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe first was that of Alonso de Ojeda, who, by the influence of Bishop\r\nFonseca, the admiral's most bitter enemy, obtained a commission to\r\nvisit the Pearl Coast, avoiding, however, lands discovered by the\r\nPortuguese and by Columbus prior to 1495. In company with Juan de la\r\nCosa and Amerigo Vespucci, Ojeda embarked with four vessels from Santa\r\nMaría, near Cádiz, on the 20th of May, 1499. Sailing by the admiral's\r\ncharts, he touched at the Canaries, and after twenty-four days reached\r\nthe main-land of South America between 3° and 6° north latitude—that\r\nis according to Ojeda's testimony; but Vespucci's account of what was\r\nprobably the same voyage brings them first upon the continent further\r\nsouth. This is claimed by Varnhagen, _Examen de quelques points de\r\nl'histoire géographique du Brazil_, Paris, 1858, as the first discovery\r\nof Brazil. Following the coast north-west for 200 leagues without\r\nlanding, but discovering the two great rivers Essequebo and Orinoco,\r\nthey landed on Trinidad Island, the first inhabited coast which they\r\ntouched, where they traded for pearls and found traces of the admiral\r\nwho had preceded them. Out through the Boca del Drago, following the\r\ncoast of Paria to the gulf of Pearls, or Curiana, landing on Margarita\r\nIsland, anchoring in the bay of Corsarios, they continued from port to\r\nport to Chichirivichi, where they had a fight with the natives, and\r\nspent twenty days in a port near by. Ojeda then visited Curazao and\r\nthe gulf of Venezuela, where was found a town built over the water\r\nlike Venice. On the 24th of August he discovered Lake Maracaibo, and\r\nafterward followed the coast westward to Cape de la Vela, whence he\r\ndirected his course, on the 30th of August, to Española, arriving, as\r\nwe have seen, September 5, 1499. He finally returned to Spain in the\r\nmiddle of June, 1500, the voyage having yielded but a small profit.\r\n_Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 4-11 and 543-5; _Major's\r\nPrince Henry_, pp. 367-9; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. pp. 195,\r\n220; _Oviedo_, _Hist. Gen._, tom. i. p. 76.\r\n\r\nThe second minor expedition to South America was that of Pedro Alonso\r\nNiño and Cristóbal Guerra, similar in its object to that of Ojeda. A\r\nfew days after Ojeda's departure they sailed from Palos in one vessel\r\nwith thirty-three men, reaching the main-land farther north, and some\r\nfifteen days later than Ojeda. They traded on the coast of Cumaná for\r\nthree months, their western limit being the region of Chichirivichi,\r\nstarted for home February 13, 1500, and arrived in Spain about the\r\nmiddle of April with a large quantity of pearls. _Peter Martyr_, dec.\r\ni. cap. viii.; _Gomara_, _Hist. de las Indias_, fol. 98; _Navarrete_,\r\n_Col. de Viages_, tom. ii. p. 147; tom. iii. pp. 11-18, 542; _Irving's\r\nColumbus_, vol. iii. p. 37-42; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. p.\r\n220.\r\n\r\nThe third expedition of this year was that of Vicente Yañez Pinzon,\r\nwho had commanded a vessel under Columbus in 1492. Sailing early in\r\nDecember, 1499, from Palos with a fleet of four vessels he crossed the\r\nequator, and on the 20th of January—Peter Martyr says the 26th, and\r\nIrving the 28th of January—discovered land in latitude 8° south, at Cape\r\nSt Augustine, which he named Santa María de la Consolacion. Varnhagen,\r\n_Examen_, pp. 19-24, entertains doubts regarding the spot where Pinzon\r\nfirst landed, and thinks it quite as likely to have been some cape\r\nfurther north. From this point, wherever it may have been, Pinzon\r\nfollowed the coast to the north, touched at various places, discovered\r\nthe Amazon, and in due time reached the gulf of Paria. Thence he sailed\r\nthrough the Boca del Drago, arrived at Española on the 23d of June, and\r\nreturned to Spain in September, 1500. This voyage was as disastrous\r\nas the preceding one had been profitable. Peter Martyr states, dec.\r\ni. cap. ix., that Paria was thought to be a part of Asia beyond the\r\nGanges. See also _De Navigatione Pinzoni Socii Admirantis, et de rebus\r\nper eum repertis_, in _Grynæus_, _Novus Orbis_, p. 119; _Navarrete_,\r\n_Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 18-23; _Major's Prince Henry_, p. 369;\r\n_Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp. 313-14; tom. iii. p. 221.\r\n\r\nHere belongs Amerigo Vespucci's account of a second voyage made in\r\nconjunction with others in the service of the king of Spain. Departing\r\nin May, 1499—some editions of his letters have it 1489—from Cádiz\r\nand touching at the Canaries he steered south-west for nineteen days,\r\nsailing in that time 500 leagues to a point on the main-land in latitude\r\n5° south,—from incorrect readings of the originals some editors make\r\nhim say 800 leagues and latitude 8°—where the days and nights are\r\nequal on the 27th of June, at which time the sun enters Cancer. Thence\r\ncoasting eastward forty leagues; then north-west to a beautiful island\r\nand convenient harbor; and yet eighty other leagues to a secure harbor\r\nwhere he remained seventeen days and gathered many pearls; thence to\r\nanother port; then to an island fifteen leagues from the main-land; and\r\nagain to another island, which was called Gigantes, where captives were\r\ntaken; then to a fine bay where the ships were refitted; and finally,\r\nafter forty-seven days at this last place they sail for Antilla, that is\r\nEspañola. Two months and two days are spent at Antilla, whence on the\r\n22d of July they embark for Spain, and reach Cádiz September 8, 1500.\r\n_De Secundariæ Navigatinis Cursu_, Latin text and Spanish translation\r\nof Vespucci's letter in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp.\r\n242-62.\r\n\r\nIt has never been claimed that Vespucci attempted discoveries in 1499\r\nas chief in command. The voyage described by him is without doubt that\r\nof Pinzon or Ojeda, although D'Avesac, in _Bulletin de la Soc. Géog._,\r\nmakes it identical with that of Lepe. Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv.\r\npp. 200 et seq., by comparing the details decides that it was that of\r\nPinzon, and by the same method he concludes that Vespucci's first voyage\r\nwas that under Ojeda. As the points of resemblance are slight in either\r\ncase; as Vespucci is known to have accompanied Ojeda; as he would have\r\nbeen obliged to return to Spain before Ojeda in June, 1500, in order\r\nto sail with Pinzon in December, 1499; and as Vespucci describes an\r\nastronomical phenomenon which, as Humboldt admits, could not possibly\r\nhave taken place during Pinzon's voyage, I am inclined to accept the\r\ngenerally received opinion that Ojeda's is the voyage described. \"There\r\ncan now be no doubt that Vespucci's voyage in 1499 was identical with\r\nthat of Ojeda.\" _Major's Prince Henry_, p. 370; _Varnhagen_, _Exam._,\r\npp. 1-19. Navarrete and Irving imply that this was the only voyage made\r\nby Vespucci for the crown of Spain. However it may be, for the purposes\r\nof this Summary the question is of little importance; for there are\r\nno disputed points of geographical import depending on the two trading\r\nvoyages, one of which Vespucci attempts to describe; and if there were,\r\nhis account in the different forms in which it exists is so full of\r\nblunders that it could throw but little light upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEPE, GUERRA, AND CABRAL.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth minor expedition of this year was that of Diego de Lepe,\r\nwho sailed in less than a month after Pinzon—that is near the end\r\nof December, 1499—with two vessels. Touching main-land below Cape St\r\nAugustine, he observed the south-western trend of the coast below that\r\npoint; but of his voyage along the shore nothing is known save that\r\nhe reached the Pearl Coast. Before the 5th of June he had returned\r\nto Spain. _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 23-4, 553-5;\r\n_Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. i. pp. 314-15; tom. iv. pp. 221-2.\r\n\r\nThere are some scattered hints collected in _Biddle's Memoir of\r\nSebastian Cabot_, pp. 91 et seq., of a new expedition in 1499 by the\r\nCabots, directed this time to tropical regions. They are not sufficient\r\nto render it probable that such a voyage was made, although Ojeda\r\nreported that he found several Englishmen cruising on the Pearl Coast.\r\n_Viages Menores_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. p. 41; _Kohl's Hist.\r\nDiscov._, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[1500.] In this year Cristóbal Guerra made a second voyage to the Pearl\r\nCoast with some success, and returned to Spain before November 1, 1501.\r\n_Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 24-5. Spain also made\r\npreparations to explore the northern lands discovered by the Cabots, but\r\nwithout any known results. _Peschel_, _Geschichte der Entd._, Stuttgart,\r\n1858, p. 316; _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 41-46;\r\n_Biddle's Mem. Cabot_, p. 236; _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, pp. 192-3. In\r\n_Diccionario Universal, Apénd._, article 'Viages,' p. 805, is mentioned\r\na voyage to the Pearl Coast by Alonso Velez de Mendoza in two vessels.\r\nNo authorities are given.\r\n\r\nThe year following the return of Gama from his successful voyage to\r\nIndia, Pedro Alvarez Cabral was entrusted with the command of thirteen\r\nwell-armed vessels, and sent to establish commercial relations with\r\nthe new countries now made accessible to Portuguese enterprise. Cabral\r\nembarked from Lisbon on the 9th of March, 1500; thirteen days later\r\nhe left behind him the Cape Verde Islands, pursuing a south-westerly\r\ncourse. Whether he was driven by storms in this direction, or wished to\r\navoid the calms of the Guinea coast, or whether he entertained a hope of\r\nreaching some part of the regions recently discovered by the Spaniards\r\nis not known. Certain it is, however, that notwithstanding his having\r\nsailed for India, on the 22d of April—Humboldt says in February—he found\r\nhimself on the coast of Brazil in about latitude 10° south, leaving a\r\ngap probably of some 170 leagues between this point and the southern\r\nlimit of Lepe and Pinzon. Thence he coasted southward, took formal\r\npossession of the land on the 1st of May at Porto Seguro, and named the\r\ncountry Vera Cruz, which name soon became Santa Cruz. Cabral immediately\r\nsent Gaspar de Lemos in one of the ships back to Portugal with an\r\naccount and map of the new discoveries. Leaving two convicts with the\r\nnatives of that coast, Cabral continued his journey for India on the 22d\r\nof May. Off the Cape of Good Hope he lost four vessels, in one of which\r\nwas Bartolomeu Dias, the discoverer of the cape, and reached Calicut\r\non the 13th of September. Returning he met at Cape Verde a fleet, on\r\nboard of which is supposed to have been Amerigo Vespucci, and arrived\r\nat Lisbon July 23, 1501. _Navigation del Capitano Pedro Alvares_, in\r\n_Ramusio_, tom. i. fol. 132-9; _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. i.\r\nbooke ii. pp. 30-1; _Cancellieri_, _Notizie di Colombo_, pp. 48-9;\r\n_Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 45-6, 94-101; _Humboldt_,\r\n_Exam.

Two vessels, probably in the spring of 1500,\r\nwere sent out under Gaspar Cortereal. No journal or chart of the voyage\r\nis now in existence, hence little is known of its object or results.\r\nStill more dim is a previous voyage ascribed by Cordeiro to João\r\nVaz Cortereal, father of Gaspar, about the time of Kolno, which, as\r\nKunstmann views it, \"requires further proof.\" Touching at the Azores,\r\nGaspar Cortereal, possibly following Cabot's charts, struck the coast\r\nof Newfoundland north of Cape Race, and sailing north discovered a land\r\nwhich he called Terra Verde, perhaps Greenland, but was stopped by\r\nice at a river which he named Rio Nevado, whose location is unknown.\r\nCortereal returned to Lisbon before the end of 1500. _Cancellieri_,\r\n_Notizie di Colombo_, pp. 48-9; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 57;\r\n_Galvano's Discov._, pp. 95-6; _Major's Prince Henry_, p. 374; _Kohl's\r\nHist. Discov._, pp. 166-8, 174-7. Biddle, _Mem. Cabot_, pp. 137-261,\r\nthinks that Cortereal landed south of Cape Race; Humboldt, _Exam.\r\nCrit._, tom. iv. p. 222, is of the opinion that Terra Verde was not\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\nIn October of this same year Rodrigo de Bastidas sailed from Cádiz with\r\ntwo vessels. Touching the shore of South America near Isla Verde, which\r\nlies between Guadalupe and the main-land, he followed the coast westward\r\nto El Retrete, or perhaps Nombre de Dios, on the isthmus of Darien,\r\nin about 9° 30' north latitude. Returning, he was wrecked on Española\r\ntoward the end of 1501, and reached Cádiz in September, 1502. This\r\nbeing the first authentic voyage by Europeans to the territory herein\r\ndefined as the Pacific States, such incidents as are known will be given\r\nhereafter.

In the year 1500, however, a map of the\r\nworld was made by the veteran pilot Juan de la Cosa, who had sailed with\r\nColumbus on his second voyage, and had accompanied Alonso de Ojeda to\r\nthe Pearl Coast. It is preserved in the Royal Library of Madrid, and\r\nshows in a remarkably clear manner all discoveries up to that date.\r\nDrawn in colors and gold on ox-hide, on a scale of fifteen leagues to\r\nthe degree, it lays down the parallels of Gibraltar and Paris, beside\r\nthe equator and tropic of Cancer, and gives a scale at the top and\r\nbottom. _Stevens' Notes_, p. 16. Humboldt first published a copy of\r\nthe American portion, and the whole, or parts thereof, have been since\r\npublished or described in _Lelewel_, _Géog. du moyen âge_, tom. ii. pp.\r\n109 et seq., atlas, no. 41; _Sagra_, _Hist. physique et politique de\r\nl'île de Cuba_, Paris, 1838, and atlas; _Ghillany_, _Geschichte_, etc.,\r\npref. by Humboldt; _Jomard_, _Monuments de géog._, atlas no. xvi., which\r\ngives a full-sized fac-simile; _Kohl's Hist. Discov._, pp. 151-5, 239,\r\nplate v., being a copy of the northern part from Humboldt with additions\r\nfrom Jomard. Stevens in his _Notes_, see pp. 11-16, 33, 51, and plate\r\ni., produces a photo-lithographic copy of the western hemisphere from\r\nJomard. I give a copy of the central portions of the western hemisphere\r\nfrom Humboldt, Stevens, and Kohl.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JUAN DE LA COSA'S MAP, 1500.]\r\n\r\nThe upper portion is North America, and the lower South America, between\r\nwhich a continuous coast line remains as yet undiscovered.\r\n\r\nAll the newly found regions are represented as parts of Asia,\r\nand consequently names are applied only to islands and particular\r\nlocalities. Up to this time three portions of the supposed Asiatic\r\nseaboard have been explored. First, there are the discoveries of the\r\nCabots in the north, represented as extending from 'Cabo de Yngleterra'\r\nwestward to the flag which bounds the 'Sea discovered by the English.'\r\nThis direct western trend of the coast, most likely laid down from\r\nCabot's charts, is one of the strongest evidences that the coast\r\nexplored by Cabot was the northern shore of the gulf of St Lawrence.\r\nAnother reason for entertaining such belief is the use of the words _Mar\r\ndescubierta por Yngleses_ instead of _Mare Oceanus_, thus indicating\r\nthat it was a sea or gulf and not the open ocean. Cosa could not at\r\nthe time have known the results of Cortereal's voyage. On Cabot's\r\ncoast various points are named, but farther to the north-east and to\r\nthe south-west the line is laid down indefinitely and without names,\r\nprobably from Marco Polo. Kohl puts the inscription _Mar descubierta_,\r\netc., farther south and west than on the original, and thinks the curve\r\nin the coast west of the last flag to be Cape Cod. Then we have in\r\nthe south the northern coast of South America quite accurately laid\r\ndown from Cape de la Vela south-eastward to the limit of Pinzon's\r\nvoyage in 1499; with a nameless coast-line south-east to the locality\r\nof Cape St Augustine. From Cape de la Vela we have the same imaginary\r\ncoast-line without names extending westward, as if to meet the line\r\nfrom the north-east; but just at the point where the lines must meet,\r\nor be separated by a strait leading to India proper, the non-committal\r\nmap-maker inserted a picture—indicated by the double dotted lines—thus\r\navoiding the expression of his opinion as to whether the Pearl Coast\r\nwas joined to Asia, or was detached from the continent. On the original\r\nmap no attempt is made to show inland topography, although the copies of\r\nHumboldt and Kohl have some lakes and rivers. I have taken the liberty\r\nto indicate the indefinite, nameless coasts by a dotted line for greater\r\nclearness. The last of the three several explored regions shown by this\r\nmap are the central islands, Cuba, Española, and others discovered by\r\nColumbus, who was accompanied in at least one of his voyages by the\r\nauthor himself. In this part of the map some difficulty has arisen from\r\nthe fact that Cuba is represented as an island, while Columbus is known\r\nto have held the opinion that it was a part of the mainland; an opinion,\r\nas before stated, which was subscribed to under oath by all his men,\r\nincluding Juan de la Cosa. On the original, the western part of Cuba\r\nis cut off by green paint, the conventional sign of _terra incognita_,\r\nwhich leads Stevens to infer that the pilot \"did not intend to represent\r\nCuba to be an island,\" but that he only supposed it to be such. This,\r\nhowever, by no means implies that the draughtsman intended to say that\r\nCuba was not an island, but rather that he was not certain that it was\r\nan island, but only supposed it to be. It will be remembered that the\r\nnatives affirmed from the first that it was an island, although so large\r\nthat no one had ever reached its western extremity. This statement,\r\ntogether with his own observations during the voyage, probably caused\r\nJuan de la Cosa to afterward change the opinion to which he had perhaps\r\nhastily subscribed at the request of Columbus. There can be but little\r\ndoubt of the authenticity of this map, although Stevens considers it has\r\nbeen distorted in the various copies and descriptions. That the author\r\ndid not himself make any later additions to it is evident from the fact\r\nthat his own subsequent discoveries are not shown.\r\n\r\n[1501.] Again King Henry of England issues commissions permitting\r\nprivate persons to make discovery at their own expense. So far as known,\r\nhowever, no voyage was effected under this royal encouragement, although\r\nit is not improbable that intercourse with Newfoundland was continued\r\nafter Cabot's discovery. _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 55; _Kohl's\r\nHist. Discov._, pp. 185-7; _Biddle's Mem. Cabot_, p. 228 et seq.;\r\n_Peschel_, _Geschichte der Entd._, p. 334 et seq.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUAN DE NOVA AND THE CORTEREALS.]\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese, more practical in their attempts, push discovery in\r\nall directions. Juan de Nova with four vessels sails from Lisbon March\r\n5, 1501, doubles the Cape of Good Hope, and returning reaches Lisbon\r\nSeptember 11, 1502, having discovered Ascension Island on the voyage\r\nout, and St Helena on the return. _Galvano's Discov._, pp. 97-8;\r\n_Major's Prince Henry_, p. 413; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. p.\r\n225; tom. v. p. 107. The Cape of Good Hope route to India may now be\r\ndeclared open; voyages thither from this time cannot properly be called\r\nvoyages of discovery; hence of the frequent subsequent voyages of the\r\nPortuguese to India I shall make no mention except of such as in some\r\nway relate to America. For a summary of these later voyages see _Major's\r\nPrince Henry_, pp. 413-18.\r\n\r\nGaspar Cortereal this year makes a second voyage to the regions of the\r\nnorth, sailing from Belem, near Lisbon, May 15, 1501, with two or three\r\nvessels, touching probably at some point in Newfoundland, and coasting\r\nnorthward some six or seven hundred miles. He does not, however, reach\r\nthe Terra Verde of the former voyage on account of ice. One of the\r\nvessels—Kunstmann says two—returned, arriving at Lisbon October 8,\r\n1501; the other with the commander was never afterward heard from. One\r\nof the chief objects of this expedition seems to have been the capture\r\nof slaves. The name Labrador is applied by Cortereal to this discovery,\r\n\"and is perhaps the only permanent trace of Portuguese adventure within\r\nthe limits of North America.\" _Bancroft's Hist. U. S._, vol. i. p.\r\n16; _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. p. 44; _Major's Prince\r\nHenry_, p. 374; _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. p. 224; _Kohl's\r\nHist. Discov._, pp. 169-71; _Peschel_, _Geschichte der Entd._, pp. 331\r\net seq.; _Biddle's Mem. Cabot_, pp. 237 et seq.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese also send an expedition to prosecute the discoveries\r\nbegun by Cabral, who has not yet returned from India, but whose\r\ndiscovery of Brazil has been reported by Lemos. Strangely enough no\r\ndocuments exist in the Portuguese archives touching this voyage, nor is\r\nthe name of its commander known, although Varnhagen thinks it may have\r\nbeen Manuel. It is known as Vespucci's third voyage, and its incidents\r\nare found only in his letters. The authenticity of this as of his other\r\nvoyages has been often doubted and denied, and as it is the voyage that\r\nresulted in the naming of America, it has given rise to much discussion,\r\ninto which however I shall not enter. The discussion does not affect the\r\nvoyage itself, nor the leading facts connected with it, the questions\r\nbeing whether Vespucci was in command, which indeed he does not claim to\r\nhave been; and above all, whether the results of the voyage entitled him\r\nto the honor of naming America, which they certainly did not, even had\r\nhe commanded, from the fact that other navigators had discovered both\r\nof the Americas before him. Navarrete, one of Vespucci's most jealous\r\nenemies, admits that he visited the coast of Brazil in a subordinate\r\ncapacity in some Portuguese expedition; and Humboldt, in an essay of 115\r\npages, effectually defends the veracity of Vespucci in his accounts of\r\nhis voyages, which the distinguished commentator quotes with notes on\r\nthe variations of different editions.\r\n\r\nVespucci was induced to leave Seville in order to accompany the\r\nfleet, which consisted of three vessels—some editions say ten, some\r\nfourteen—and which sailed from Lisbon on the 13th of May. Passing the\r\nCanaries without landing, to the African coast and Basilica in 14°,\r\nprobably Cape Verde, there he remained eleven days. At this place he\r\nmet Cabral's fleet returning from India and learned the particulars\r\nof the voyage, including the American discoveries, of which he gives\r\na full account in a letter written at the time under date of June 4,\r\n1501, which is a strong proof of the veracity of his other accounts.\r\nSee extracts in _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. v. pp. 34-44. It is\r\nextraordinary that in the several accounts of this meeting the name\r\nof Vespucci's commander is not mentioned. From Cape Verde the fleet\r\nsailed south-west sixty-seven days and touched the main-land the 17th\r\nof August, at a point in 5° south latitude, taking possession for the\r\nking of Portugal. Thence it followed the coast south-east, doubled\r\nCape St Augustine, and went on in sight of land for 600 leagues to\r\na point in 32° south—according to Gomara, 40°; Navarrete thinks it\r\ncould not have been over 26°. Having found no precious metals during\r\na voyage of ten months, the Portuguese abandoned this coast on the\r\n13th (or 15th) of February, 1502, and after having been driven by\r\nstorms far to the south-east, and discovering some land whose identity\r\nis uncertain—Humboldt thinks it was an accumulation of ice, or the\r\ncoast of Patagonia—they reached the coast of Ethiopia on the 10th of\r\nMay, the Azores toward the end of July, and Lisbon September 7, 1502.\r\nVespucci gives full descriptions of the natives of Brazil, but these\r\ndescriptions, together with the numerous conflicting statements, or\r\nblunders of the various texts relating to details of the voyage, I pass\r\nover as unimportant to my purpose. That Vespucci was with a Portuguese\r\nfleet which in 1501-2 explored a large but ill-defined portion of the\r\nBrazilian coast, there can be no doubt. _Grynæus_, _Novus Orbis_, pp.\r\n122-30; _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, tom. i. pp. 139-44; _Viages Menores_, in\r\n_Navarrete_, tom. iii. pp. 46, 262-80; _Humboldt_, _Exam.

Neither of his\r\ntwo vessels appears to have returned. _Viages Menores_, in _Navarrete_,\r\ntom. iii. p. 44; _Humboldt_, _Exam.

Accompanied by Garcia de Ocampo, Juan de\r\nVergara, Hernando de Guevara, and his nephew Pedro de Ojeda, he touched\r\nat the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands, and reached the gulf of Paria.\r\nRefitting his vessels, on the 11th of March he set sail and coasted\r\nnorth-westward, touching at various points until he came to a port\r\nwhich he called Santa Cruz, probably Bahía Honda, about twenty-five\r\nmiles east of Cape de la Vela. During the voyage along the coast the\r\nvessels were much of the time separated, following different courses. At\r\nSanta Cruz Ojeda found a man who had been left by Bastidas, and there\r\nhe determined to establish his colony. A fort was built, and a vessel\r\nsent to Jamaica for supplies; but the colony did not prosper. To other\r\ntroubles were added dissensions among the fiery leaders, and about\r\nthe end of May Ojeda was imprisoned by his companions; the colony was\r\nfinally abandoned, and its governor brought as a prisoner to Española\r\nin September. The few disputed points of this voyage concern only the\r\npersonal quarrels of Ojeda and his fellow-captains. _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\nde Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 28-39, 168-70, 591 et seq.; _Humboldt_, _Exam.\r\nCrit._, tom. i. p. 360; tom. iv. p. 226.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOURTH VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of May, 1502, Columbus embarked from Cádiz on his\r\nfourth and last voyage. Refitting at Española, he directed his course\r\nwestward, discovered _terra firma_ at the Guanaja Islands, off the north\r\ncoast of Honduras, and sailing southward, followed the shores of the\r\nsupposed Asia to El Retrete on the isthmus of Darien, where terminated\r\nthe discovery of Bastidas from the opposite direction, whose chart may\r\nhave been in the admiral's possession. Particulars of this voyage are\r\ngiven hereafter. See _Cuarto y Último Viage de Cristobal Colon_, in\r\n_Navarrete_, tom. i. pp. 277-313; _Colon_, _Hist. del Almirante_, in\r\n_Barcia_, tom. i. pp. 101-18; _Gomara_, _Hist. de las Indias_, fol. 31;\r\n_Peter Martyr_, dec. iii. cap. iv.; _Herrera_, _Hist.

His special aim in this fourth\r\nvoyage was to do what various circumstances had prevented him from\r\ndoing before, namely, to sail along the eastern and southern coasts of\r\nAsia to India, passing, of course, through the supposed strait between\r\nthe main-land and the land of Paria. It is certainly extraordinary\r\nthat this idea entertained by Columbus corresponded so closely with\r\nthe actual conformation of the eastern Asiatic coast, and its southern\r\naddition of the Australian archipelago; that this conformation is so\r\nclosely duplicated in the American coasts; and that the position of\r\nthe admiral's hypothetical strait was almost identical with the actual\r\nnarrowest part of the American continent. Columbus followed the coast\r\nto the western limit of Bastidas' voyage and could find no opening\r\nin the shore, either because the ancient chroniclers were faulty in\r\nmaking no mention of this great supposed southern extension of Asia, or\r\nbecause the strait had in some way escaped his scrutiny. He therefore\r\nabandoned the search, and gave himself up to other schemes, but he\r\nnever relinquished his original idea, and died, 1506, in the belief\r\nthat he had reached the coast of Asia, and without the suspicion of a\r\nnew continent. Moreover, his belief was shared by all cosmographers and\r\nscholars of the time. _Peter Martyr_, dec. i. cap. viii.; _Humboldt_,\r\n_Exam.

Am. Vet._, pp. 173-4, we have \"authentic\r\ndeeds and depositions proving beyond doubt a French expedition to Brazil\r\nas early as 1503;\" in support of which he refers to _De Gonneville_,\r\n_Mémoires_, Paris, 1663; _De Brosses_, _Hist. des Navigations_, Paris,\r\n1756, tom. i. pp. 104-14; _Revista Trimensal_, Rio de Janeiro, tom. vi.\r\np. 412-14; _D'Avesac_, in _Bulletin de la Soc. Géog._, tom. xiv. p. 172.\r\n\r\nIn 1503 the Portuguese sent a third fleet of six vessels under Gonzalo\r\nCoelho to make farther explorations on the coast of Brazil, then called\r\nSanta Cruz, and to sail, if possible, around its southern extremity to\r\nIndia, an idea that seems to have been conceived during the preceding\r\nvoyage, but which could not then be carried into effect for want of\r\nsupplies. Vespucci commanded one of the vessels, and set out with\r\nhigh hopes of accomplishing great things for his country, his God, and\r\nhimself. This is known as Vespucci's fourth voyage. Beyond the account\r\nwhich he gives in his letters, little is known of it except the fact\r\nthat Coelho made such a voyage at the time. The identity of the two\r\nexpeditions has not been undisputed, but Humboldt and Major both show\r\nthat there can be little doubt in the matter. The fleet sailed from\r\nLisbon on the 10th of June—Vespucci says May—remained twelve or thirteen\r\ndays at the Cape Verde Islands, and thence sailed south-east to within\r\nsight of Sierra Leone. The navigators were prevented by a storm from\r\nanchoring, and so directed their course south-west for 300 leagues\r\nto a desert island in about lat. 3° south, supposed to be Fernando de\r\nNoronha, where Coelho lost his ship on the 10th of August. Vespucci's\r\nvessel was separated from the rest for eight days, but afterward joined\r\none of them, and the two sailed south-west for seventeen days, making\r\n300 leagues, and arriving at the Bahía de Todos os Santos. Remaining\r\nthere two months and four days, they followed the coast for 260 leagues\r\nto the port now called Cape Frio, where they built a fort and left\r\ntwenty-four men who had belonged to the vessel which had been wrecked.\r\nIn this port, which by Vespucci's observations was in lat. 18° south\r\nand 35° (or 57°) west of Lisbon, they remained five months, exploring\r\nthe interior for forty leagues; they then loaded with Brazil-wood, and\r\nafter a return voyage of seventy-seven days arrived in Lisbon June 28\r\n(or 18), 1504. Vespucci believed the other ships of the fleet to have\r\nbeen lost, but after his account was written, Coelho returned with\r\ntwo ships; nothing, however, is now known of his movements after the\r\nseparation. _Di Amerigo Vespucci Fiorentino_, in _Ramusio_, tom, i.,\r\n_Lettera prima_, fol. 139, _Lettera secondo_, fol. 141, _Sommario_,\r\nfol. 141; _Viages de Vespucio_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. pp. 281-90;\r\n_Southey's Hist.

In my copy, which is dated ten years\r\nlater, this chapter is on folio 328. At least nine editions of the work\r\nappeared before 1540.\r\n\r\n[1504.] Soon after the return from his third voyage, Vespucci wrote a\r\nletter to Piero de' Medici, setting forth its incidents. This letter,\r\nwhich bears no date, was probably written in corrupt Italian, and after\r\ncirculating to some extent in manuscript, as was the custom at the\r\ntime, it may have been printed, but no copies are known to exist, and\r\nthe original is lost. Translations were made, however, into Latin and\r\nGerman, which appeared in small pamphlet form in at least seventeen\r\ndifferent editions before 1507, under the title of _Mundus Novus_,\r\nor its equivalent. The earliest edition which bears a date is that of\r\n1504, but of the nine issues without date, some undoubtedly appeared\r\nbefore that year. It is probable that other editions have disappeared\r\non account of their undurable form. None of Vespucci's other accounts\r\nare known to have been printed before 1507.\r\n\r\nThis same year the _Libretto de tutta le Navigazione del Re di Spagna_\r\nis said to have been printed at Venice, being the first collection of\r\nvoyages, and containing, according to the few Italian authors who claim\r\nto have seen it, the first three voyages of Columbus and those of Niño\r\nand Pinzon. If authentic, it was the first account of the voyage of\r\nColumbus to the Pearl Coast; but no copy is known at present to exist,\r\nand its circulation must have been small compared with Vespucci's\r\nrelations. _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._, tom. iv. pp. 67-77; _Harrisse_,\r\n_Bib. Am. Vet._, nos. 22-41.\r\n\r\nA chart made about 1504 has been preserved which shows Portuguese\r\ndiscoveries only. In the north are laid down Newfoundland and Labrador\r\nunder the name of 'Terra de Cortte Reall,' and Greenland with no name,\r\nbut so correctly represented as to form a strong evidence that it was\r\nreached by Cortereal. On the south we have the coast of Brazil, to\r\nwhich no name is given; between the two is open sea, with no indication\r\nof Spanish discoveries. _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 127-8, and\r\n_Munich Atlas_, no. iii.; _Kohl's Hist.

Five editions are mentioned as having been issued in the years\r\n1510, 1511, and 1530, all but one at Paris.\r\n\r\nM. Varnhagen claims that the original mixed Italian text of Vespucci's\r\nfirst voyage was printed in Florence in 1505 or 1506, and that several\r\ncopies have been preserved. This is the text used by him in his defense\r\nof Vespucci. See _Premier Voy._, Vienna, 1869, and _Vespucci, son\r\ncaractère_, etc., Lima, 1865, in which the letter is reproduced. I find\r\nno mention by any other author of such an edition.\r\n\r\n[1507.] No voyages are mentioned in this year; but the bibliography\r\nof the year is remarkable. _Montalboddo_ (or Zorzi), _Paesi Nouamente\r\nretrouati, Et Nouo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio, Florentino, intitulato_,\r\nVicentia, 1507, is the second collection of voyages issued, and the\r\nfirst of which any copies at present exist. This work is divided into\r\nsix books, of which the fourth and fifth relate to America, the fourth\r\nbeing a reproduction of the _Libretto_ of 1504, while the fifth is\r\nthe _Nouo Mondo_, or third voyage of Vespucci; and its mention in\r\nthe title shows how important a feature it was deemed in a work of\r\nthis character. In the following year, besides a new Italian edition,\r\nthere appeared a German translation under the title of _Ruchamer_,\r\n_Newe unbekanthe landte_, Nuremberg, 1508, and a Latin translation,\r\n_Itinerariũ Portugallẽsiũ_, Milan, 1508. At least fourteen editions in\r\nItalian, Latin, German, and French appeared before 1530.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NAMING OF AMERICA.]\r\n\r\n_Hylacomylus (Waldsee-Müller)_, _Cosmographiæ Introdvctio ... Insuper\r\nquatuor Americi Vespucij Nauigationes_, Deodate (St Dié, Lorraine),\r\n1507, is the title of a work which appeared four times in the same\r\nplace and year. It is the first collection of Vespucci's four voyages,\r\nand generally regarded as the first edition of the first and fourth,\r\nalthough as we have seen M. Varnhagen claims an Italian edition of the\r\nfirst in 1506. This account of the third voyage is different from that\r\nso widely circulated before as _Mundus Novus_. Three other editions of\r\nthe work, or of the part relating to Vespucci, appeared in 1509 and\r\n1510. In _Hylacomylus_ the following passage occurs: \"But now that\r\nthose parts have been more extensively examined, and another fourth\r\npart has been discovered by Americus (as will be seen in the sequel),\r\nI do not see why we should rightly refuse to name it America, namely,\r\nthe land of Americus or America, after its discoverer, Americus, a man\r\nof sagacious mind, since both Europe and Asia took their names from\r\nwomen.\" Here we have the origin of the name 'America.' To the northern\r\ndiscoveries of Columbus, Cabot, and Cortereal, on the islands and coast\r\nof the supposed Asia, no general name was given because those regions\r\nwere already named India, Cathay, Mangi, etc., while names were applied\r\nby Europeans only to particular places on the new coasts. When Columbus\r\nin 1498 explored the northern coast of South America he had no doubt\r\nit was a portion, though probably a detached portion, of Asia, and\r\nthe terms Paria and the Pearl Coast sufficed to designate the region\r\nduring the succeeding trading voyages. Concerning these voyages, only a\r\nletter of Columbus and a slight account of Pinzon's expedition had been\r\nprinted, apparently without attracting much attention. The voyages of\r\nColumbus, Bastidas, and Pinzon along the coast of Central America were\r\nalmost unknown. Meanwhile the fame of the great navigator had become\r\nmuch obscured. His enterprises on the supposed Asiatic coast had been\r\nunprofitable to Spain. The eyes of the world were now directed farther\r\nsouth. By the Portuguese the coasts of Brazil had been explored for a\r\nlong distance, proving the great extent of this south-eastern portion of\r\nthe supposed Asia, whose existence was not indicated on the old charts,\r\nand which certainly required a name. These Portuguese explorations and\r\ntheir results were known to the world almost exclusively by the letter\r\nof Vespucci so often printed. To the Latin translation of the letter,\r\nthe name _Mundus Novus_ had been applied, meaning not necessarily a\r\nnew continent, but simply the newly found regions. The name 'America'\r\nsuggested itself naturally, possibly through the influence of some\r\nfriend who was an admirer of Vespucci, to the German professor of\r\na university in Lorraine, as appropriate for the new region, and he\r\naccordingly proposed it. Having proposed it, his pride and that of his\r\nfriends—a clique who had great influence over the productions of the\r\nGerman press at that period—was involved in securing its adoption. No\r\nopen opposition seems to have been made, even by the Portuguese who\r\nhad applied the name 'Santa Cruz' to the same region; still it was\r\nlong before the new name replaced the old ones. In later years, when\r\nAmerica was found to be joined to the northern continent, and all that\r\ngreat land to be entirely distinct from Asia, the name had become too\r\nfirmly fixed to be easily changed, and no effort that we know of was\r\nmade to change it. Later still some authors, inadvertently perhaps,\r\nattributed the first discovery to Vespucci. This aroused the wrath of\r\nLas Casas and others, and a discussion ensued which has lasted to the\r\npresent time. See list of partisans on both sides in _Harrisse_, _Bib.\r\nAm. Vet._, pp. 65-7. Muñoz and Navarrete insist that Vespucci was an\r\nimpostor, but others, headed by Humboldt, have proved conclusively that\r\nthe name 'America' was adopted as the result of the somewhat strange\r\ncombination of circumstances described, without any intentional wrong to\r\nColumbus. This conclusion is founded chiefly on the following reasons,\r\nnamely: The honor to Vespucci resulted chiefly from his third voyage in\r\n1501, and not from his first voyage in 1497, which last mentioned is\r\nthe only one possible to have claimed precedence over Columbus in the\r\ndiscovery of the continent. Furthermore, neither Columbus nor Vespucci\r\never suspected that a new continent had been found; and to precede Cabot\r\nin reaching Asia, Vespucci, even if relying on his first voyage, must\r\nhave dated it somewhat earlier in 1497 than he did; while to precede\r\nColumbus he must have dated it before 1492, when, as they both believed,\r\nColumbus had touched Asia at Cuba. Then, again, there is no evidence\r\nwhatever that Vespucci ever claimed the honor of discovery. He was on\r\nintimate terms with the admiral and his friends, and is highly spoken\r\nof by all, especially by Fernando Colon, who was extremely jealous in\r\nevery particular which might affect his father's honor. Moreover, it is\r\ncertain that Vespucci did not himself propose the name 'America;' it is\r\nnot certain that he even used the term Mundus Novus or its equivalent\r\nin his letters; and it is quite possible that he never even knew of\r\nhis name being applied to the New World, since the name did not come\r\ninto general use until many years after his death, which occurred\r\nin 1512. The most serious charge which in my opinion can be brought\r\nagainst Vespucci is neglect—perhaps an intentional deception for the\r\npurpose of giving himself temporary prominence in the eyes of his\r\ncorrespondent—in failing to name the commanders under whom he sailed;\r\nand with exaggeration and carelessness in his details. But it is to be\r\nremembered that his writings were simply letters to friends describing\r\nin familiar terms the wonders of his voyages, with little care for dry\r\ndates and names, reserving particulars for a large work which he had\r\nprepared, but which has never come to light. \"After all,\" says Irving,\r\n\"this is a question more of curiosity than of real moment ... about\r\nwhich grave men will continue to write weary volumes, until the subject\r\nacquires a fictitious importance from the mountain of controversy heaped\r\nupon it.\" _Cancellieri_, _Notizie di Colombo_, pp. 41-8; _Humboldt_,\r\n_Exam.

Sailing from San Lúcar June 29, 1508, they touched at the\r\nCape Verde Islands, proceeded to Cape St Augustine, and followed the\r\ncoast south-west to about 40° south latitude, returning to Spain in\r\nOctober, 1509. _Viages Menores_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. p. 47.

Ptolemæi_,\r\nRome, 1508, is said to be the first edition of this work which contains\r\nallusions to the New World. Other editions of Ptolemy, prepared by\r\ndifferent editors, with additional text and maps, and with some changes\r\nin original matter, appeared in 1511, 1512, 1513, 1519, 1520, 1522,\r\n1525, 1532, and 1535. The edition first mentioned contains, in addition\r\nto the preceding one of 1507, fourteen leaves of text and an engraved\r\nmap by Johann Ruysch—the first ever published which includes the New\r\nWorld. Copies have been printed by Lelewel in his _Géog. du moyen âge_,\r\natlas; by Santarem, in his _Recherches_, Paris, 1842, atlas; and by\r\nHumboldt, Kohl, and Stevens. I have taken the annexed copy from the\r\nthree last mentioned authorities, omitting some of the unimportant\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAP BY JOHANN RUYSCH, 1508.]\r\n\r\nThis map follows closely that of Juan de la Cosa in 1500, but\r\nillustrates more clearly the geographical idea of the time. The\r\ndiscoveries of Cabot, whom Ruysch is supposed to have accompanied, as\r\nwell as those of Cortereal in the north, of Greenland, Labrador, and\r\nNewfoundland, are laid down with tolerable accuracy; and the rest of the\r\nsupposed Asiatic coast as in Behaim's globe is taken from Marco Polo.\r\nIn the centre we have the lands discovered by Columbus, and the old\r\nfabulous island of Antilia restored. To 'Spagnola' (Española) is joined\r\nan inscription stating the compiler's belief that it was identical with\r\nZipangu, or Japan. Western Cuba is cut off by a scroll, instead of by\r\ngreen paint as in the map of Juan de la Cosa, with an inscription to the\r\neffect that this was the limit of Spanish exploration. Ruysch, having\r\nas yet no knowledge of Ocampo's voyage performed during this same year,\r\nevidently entertained the same idea respecting Cuba that was held by\r\nJuan de la Cosa, but did not venture to proclaim it an island. In the\r\nsouth, the New World is shown under the name 'Terra Sanctæ Crucis sive\r\nMvndvs Novvs.' An open sea separates the New World from Asia, showing\r\nthat Ruysch did not know of the unsuccessful search for this passage\r\nby Columbus, Bastidas, and Pinzon. It is worthy of remark that the name\r\nAmerica is not used by this countryman of Hylacomylus. Humboldt thinks\r\nthat he had not seen the _Cosmographiæ Introdvctio_, but had read some\r\nother edition of Vespucci's third voyage. _Exam.

King Ferdinand of Spain\r\ndetermined to establish colonies on that coast. The region known as\r\nTierra Firme was to that end divided into two provinces, of which Alonso\r\nde Ojeda was appointed governor of one, and Diego de Nicuesa of the\r\nother. Ojeda sailed from Española November 10, 1509, and Nicuesa soon\r\nfollowed. Their adventures form an important part of early Central\r\nAmerican history, and are fully related in the following chapters.\r\nDuring the succeeding years frequent voyages were made back and forth\r\nbetween the new colonies, Jamaica, Cuba, and Española, which are\r\nfor the most part omitted here as not constituting new discoveries.\r\n_Peter Martyr_, dec. ii. cap. i.; _Gomara_, _Hist.

Martyris_,\r\n_Anglimediolanensis opera_, Seville, 1511, is the first edition of Peter\r\nMartyr's first decade; containing in ten letters, or books, accounts of\r\nthe first three voyages of Columbus, certain expeditions to the Pearl\r\nCoast, and closing with a brief mention of the admiral's fourth voyage.\r\nThe learned author was personally acquainted with Columbus, and his\r\nrelations are consequently of great value. This work contains a map, of\r\nwhich I give a copy from Stevens, the only fac-simile I have seen.\r\n\r\nThe map shows only Spanish discoveries, but it is by far the most\r\naccurate yet made. Cuba, now proved to be an island, is so laid down. No\r\nname is given to the Mundus Novus, which, by a knowledge of the Spanish\r\nvoyages, is made to extend much farther north and west than in Ruysch's\r\nmap; but above the known coasts a place is left open where the passage\r\nto India it was believed might yet be found. The representation of a\r\ncountry, corresponding with Florida, to the north of Cuba, under the\r\nname of 'Isla de Beimini,' may indicate that Florida had been reached\r\neither by Ocampo in 1508, by some private adventurer, as Diego Miruelo,\r\nwho is said to have preceded Ponce de Leon, or, as is claimed by some,\r\nby Vespucci in his pretended voyage of 1497; but more probably this\r\nregion was laid down from the older maps—see Behaim's map, p. 93—and\r\nthe name was applied in accordance with the reports among the natives of\r\na wonderful country or island, which they called _bimini_, situated in\r\nthat direction. The map is not large enough to show exactly the relation\r\nwhich Peter Martyr supposed to exist between these regions and the rest\r\nof the world, but the text of the first decade leaves no doubt that he\r\nstill believed them to be parts of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe _Ptolemy_ of 1511 has a map which I have not seen, but which from\r\ncertain descriptions resembles that of Ruysch, except that it represents\r\nTerra Corterealis as an island separated from the supposed Asiatic\r\ncoast; the name Sanctæ Crucis for South America being still retained. As\r\nlong as the new lands were believed to be a part of Asia, the maps bore\r\nsome resemblance to the actual countries intended to be represented,\r\nbut from the first dawning of an idea of separate lands we shall see\r\nthe greatest confusion in the efforts of map-makers to depict the New\r\nWorld. _Harrisse_, _Bib. Am. Vet._, no. 68; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung\r\nAm._, 133; _Kohl_, _Die beiden ältesten Karten von Am._, p. 33. A copy\r\nof this map was published in _Lelewel's Atlas_.\r\n\r\n[1512.] The West India Islands, in which the Spaniards are at length\r\nfirmly established, become now the point of new departures. Conquerors\r\nand discoverers henceforth for the most part sail from Española or\r\nCuba rather than from Spain. Juan Ponce de Leon, a wealthy citizen who\r\nhad been governor of Puerto Rico, fitted out three vessels at his own\r\nexpense, and sailed in search of a fountain, which according to the\r\ntraditions of the natives had the property of restoring youth, and\r\nwhich was situated in the land called Bimini far to the north. This\r\ninfatuation had been current in the Islands for several years, and, as\r\nwe have seen, the name was applied to such a land on Peter Martyr's\r\nmap of 1511. Sailing from Puerto Rico March 3, 1512, Ponce de Leon\r\nfollowed the northern coast of Española, and thence north-west through\r\nthe Bahamas, reaching San Salvador on the 14th of March. Thirteen days\r\nthereafter he saw the coast of Florida, so named by him from the day\r\nof discovery, which was Pascua Florida, or Easter-day. The native name\r\nof the land was Cautio. On the 2d of April the Spaniards landed in\r\n30° 8', and took possession for the king of Spain; then following the\r\ncoast southward they doubled Cape Corrientes (Cañaveral) May 8, and\r\nadvanced to an undetermined point on the southern or eastern coast,\r\nwhich Kohl thinks may have been Charlotte Bay. All this while they\r\nbelieved the country to be an island. On the 14th of June Ponce de\r\nLeon departed from Florida, and on his return touched at the Tortugas,\r\nat the Lucayos, at Bahama, and at San Salvador, arriving at Puerto\r\nRico the 21st of September. He left behind one vessel under Juan\r\nPerez de Ortubia, who arrived a few days later with the news of having\r\nfound Bimini, but no fountain of youth. _Reise des Ponce de Leon, und\r\nEntdeckung von Florida_, in _Sammlung aller Reisebesch._, tom. xiii. p.\r\n188; _Viages Menores_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. pp. 50-3: _Real cédula\r\ndando facultad á Francisco de Garay_, in _Navarrete_, tom. iii. p. 148;\r\n_Uitvoerlyke Scheepstogt door den Dapperen Jean Ponze de Leon gedaan\r\nnaar Florida_, in _Gottfried_, tom, iii.; _Gomara_, _Hist.

Kohl places the voyage in 1513,\r\nrelying on Peschel, who, he says, has proved the year 1512 to be an\r\nimpossible date.\r\n\r\nIn 1512 the Regidor Valdivia was sent by the colonists from the gulf of\r\nDarien, then called Urabá, to Española for supplies. Being wrecked in\r\na violent tempest, he escaped in boats to the coast of Yucatan, where\r\nhe and his companions were made captives by the natives. Some were\r\nsacrificed to the gods, and then eaten; only two, Gonzalo Guerrero and\r\nGerónimo de Aguilar, survived their many hardships, the latter being\r\nrescued by Cortés in 1519. _Torquemada_, _Monarq.

The Isthmus here runs\r\neast and west, and on either side, to the north and to the south are\r\ngreat oceans, which for a long time were called the North Sea and the\r\nSouth Sea. After exploring the neighboring coasts he returned to Antigua\r\nin January, 1514, after an absence of four months. _Galvano's Discov._,\r\npp. 123-5; _Peter Martyr_, dec. iii. cap. i.; _Oviedo_, _Hist.

Many of the\r\nnames given by other maps to points on the coast of Cuba are transferred\r\nto the main-land opposite. The compiler evidently was undecided whether\r\nCuba was a part of the Asiatic main or not, and therefore represented\r\nit in both ways. The coast line must be regarded as imaginary or taken\r\nfrom the old charts, unless, as M. Varnhagen thinks, Vespucci actually\r\nsailed along the Florida coast in 1497. This map if made in 1508 may\r\nbe regarded as the first to join the southern continent, or Mundus\r\nNovus, to the main-land of Asia. This southern land is called 'Terra\r\nIncognita,' with an inscription stating expressly that it was discovered\r\nby Columbus, notwithstanding the fact that its supposed author proposed\r\nthe name America in honor of Vespucci only the year before. In fact the\r\nmap is in many respects incoherent, and is mentioned by most writers but\r\nvaguely. _Harrisse_, _Bib. Am. Vet._, no. 74; _Humboldt_, _Exam.

The special object of this expedition was to\r\ndiscover and settle the shores of the South Sea, whose existence had\r\nbeen reported in Spain, but whose discovery by Vasco Nuñez de Balboa was\r\nnot known before the departure of Pedrarias. _Herrera_, dec. i. lib.\r\nx. cap. xiii.; _Peter Martyr_, dec. ii. cap. vii.; dec. iii. cap. v.;\r\n_Galvano's Discov._, p. 125; _Quintana_, _Vidas de Españoles Célebres_,\r\n'Balboa,' p. 28; _Robertson's Hist.

Three vessels were fitted out at\r\nSeville, well manned and armed for a cruise against the Caribs, under\r\ncommand of Juan Ponce de Leon, but the Spaniards were defeated in their\r\nfirst encounter with the savages at Guadalupe, and the expedition was\r\npractically abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRADUAL ENLARGEMENT OF THE TWO AMERICAS.]\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Badajoz, Mercado, Morales, and others in 1515-16 and\r\nthe following years, by which the geography of the Isthmus was more\r\nfully determined, are given elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Schöner_, _Luculentissima quædã terræ totius descriptio_, Nuremberg,\r\n1515, and another edition of the same work under the title _Orbis\r\nTypvs_, same place and date, have a chapter on America 'discovered by\r\nVespucci in 1497.' In _Reisch_, _Margaritha Philosophica_, Strasburg,\r\n1515, an encyclopedia frequently republished, is a map which is almost\r\nan exact copy of that in the _Ptolemy_ of 1513, except in its names.\r\nThe main-land to the north-west of Cuba is called Zoana Mela, but the\r\nnames of certain localities along the coast are omitted.

Among these is that of\r\nDiego de Miruelo in 1516, who probably visited the western or gulf coast\r\nof Florida, and brought back specimens of gold. No details are known of\r\nthe expedition. _Garcilaso de la Vega_, _La Florida del Inca_, Madrid,\r\n1723, p. 5.\r\n\r\n_Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci_, Florence, 1516, the second collection of\r\nthe four voyages; _Peter Martyr_, _Ioannes ruffus, De Orbe Decades_,\r\nAlcala, 1516, the first edition of three decades; and _Giustiniani_,\r\n_Psalterium_, Genoa, 1516, which appends a life of Columbus to the\r\nnineteenth Psalm, are among the new books of the year.\r\n\r\n[1517.] Eden, in his dedication of an English translation of _Munster's\r\nCosmography_, in 1553, speaks of certain ships \"furnished and set\r\nforth\" in 1517 under Sebastian Cabot and Sir Thomas Pert; but so faint\r\nwas the heart of the baronet that the voyage \"toke none effect.\" On\r\nthis authority some authors have ascribed a voyage to Cabot in 1517,\r\nto regions concerning which they do not agree. An expedition whose\r\ndestination and results are unknown, can have had little effect on\r\ngeographical knowledge; and Kohl, after a full discussion of the\r\nsubject, seems to have proved against Biddle, its chief supporter,\r\nthat there is not sufficient evidence of such a voyage. _Navigatione\r\ndi Sebastiano Cabota_, in _Ramusio_, tom. ii. fol. 212; _Kunstmann_,\r\n_Entdeckung Am._, pp. 54-5; _Roux de Rochelle_, in _Bulletin, Soc.\r\nGéog._, Apr. 1832, p. 209; _Peter Martyr_, dec. iii. cap. vi.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Hernandez de Córdoba, with three vessels and 110 men, sailed\r\nfrom La Habana February 8, 1517, sent by the governor of Cuba to make\r\nexplorations toward the west. Touching at Cape Catoche, in Yucatan,\r\nhe coasted the peninsula in fifteen days to Campeche, and six days\r\nlater reached Potonchan, or Champoton, where a battle was fought with\r\nthe natives, and the Spaniards defeated. Accounts indicate that the\r\nexplorers were not unanimous in supposing Yucatan to be an island, as\r\nit was afterward represented on some maps. Failing to procure a supply\r\nof water in the slough of Lagartos, Córdoba sailed across the Gulf to\r\nFlorida, and thence returned to Cuba, where he died in ten days from\r\nhis wounds. I find nothing to show what part of Florida he touched.\r\n_Torquemada_, _Monarq. Ind._, tom. i. pp. 349-51; _Peter Martyr_, dec.\r\niv. cap. i.; _Oviedo_, _Hist.

Grijalva sailed from Santiago\r\nde Cuba April 8, 1518, with four vessels, reached the island of Santa\r\nCruz (Cozumel) on the 3d of May, took possession on the 6th of May, and\r\nshortly after entered Ascension Bay. From this point he coasted Yucatan\r\n270 leagues, by his estimate, to Puerto Deseado, entered and named the\r\nRio de Grijalva (Tabasco), and took possession of the country in the\r\nvicinity of Vera Cruz about the 19th of June. Advancing up the coast to\r\nCabo Rojo, he turned about and entered Rio Tonalá, engaged in a parting\r\nfight at Champoton, followed the coast for several weeks, and then\r\nturned for Cuba, arriving at Matanzas about the 1st of November. During\r\nhis absence, Cristóbal de Olid had coasted a large part of Yucatan in\r\nsearch of Grijalva's fleet. _Peter Martyr_, dec. iv. cap. iii.-iv.;\r\n_Torquemada_, _Monarq.

Stevens believes it to have\r\nbeen made some time about 1514; Kohl about 1520; Kunstmann some time\r\nafter 1511. Unexplored coasts are left out instead of being laid down\r\nfrom old Asiatic maps; as for example the United States coast from\r\nNewfoundland (Bacalnaos) to Florida (Bimini), and the Gulf coast from\r\nFlorida to Yucatan. In the central region the names 'Terram Antipodum'\r\nand 'Antilhas de Castela' are used without any means of deciding to\r\nexactly what parts they are to be applied. The South Sea discovered by\r\nBalboa in 1513 is here shown for the first time with the inscription\r\n'Mar visto pelos Castelhanus.' To South America the name 'Brasill' is\r\ngiven. The presence of two Mahometan flags in locations corresponding\r\nto Honduras and Venezuela, shows that the compiler still had no doubt\r\nthat he was mapping parts of Asia. _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp.\r\n129 et seq.; _Munich Atlas_, no. iv., from which I take my copy; _Kohl's\r\nHist.

The author was a companion of\r\nOjeda in his unfortunate attempt to found a colony on Tierra Firme.\r\nAnother edition appeared in 1530.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONQUEST OF MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nOn February 18, 1519, Hernan Cortés set sail from Cuba to undertake\r\nthe conquest of the countries discovered by Córdoba and Grijalva. After\r\nspending some time on the island of Cozumel, where he rescued Gerónimo\r\nde Aguilar from his long captivity (see p. 129), he followed the coast\r\nto Rio de Grijalva, where he defeated the natives in battle, and took\r\npossession of the land in the name of the Catholic sovereigns. From this\r\nplace he continued his voyage sailing near the shore to Vera Cruz, where\r\nhe landed his forces and began the conquest of Montezuma's empire, the\r\nhistory of which forms part of a subsequent volume of this series.\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, prompted by the reports of\r\nPonce de Leon, Córdoba, and Grijalva, despatched four vessels in 1519,\r\nunder Alonso Alvarez Pineda, who sailed northward to a point on the\r\nPánuco coast (where, according to Gomara, an expedition had been sent\r\nduring the preceding year, under Camargo). Prevented by winds and shoals\r\nfrom coasting northward as he desired, he sailed along in sight of the\r\nlow gulf shores until he reached Vera Cruz, where he found the fleet of\r\nCortés. Troubles between the commanders arose from this meeting which\r\nwill be narrated hereafter.\r\n\r\nGaray continued for some time his attempts to found a settlement in the\r\nregion of Pánuco, but without success. _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. i.;\r\n_Gomara_, _Hist.

Alaminos sailed July 16, 1519, following a\r\nnew route north of Cuba, through the Bahama Channel, and down the Gulf\r\nStream, of which current he was probably the first to take advantage.\r\nTouching at Cuba and discovering Terceira he reached Spain in October.\r\n_Diaz del Castillo_, _Hist.

Suffice it to say that in 1519 the city of Panamá was\r\nfounded, and a second expedition sent under Gaspar de Espinosa up the\r\nSouth Sea coast. The northern limit reached was the gulf of San Lúcar\r\n(Nicoya), latitude 10° north, in Nicaragua, and the expedition returned\r\nto Panamá by land from Burica. _Andagoya's Narrative of the Proceedings\r\nof Pedrarias Dávila_, London, 1865, pp. 23-4; _Kohl_, _Die beiden\r\nältesten Karten von Am._, p. 162; _Oviedo_, _Hist Gen._, tom. iii. p.\r\n61 et seq.\r\n\r\nWe have seen several unsuccessful attempts by both Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese to find a passage to India by the southern parts of Brazil,\r\nSanta Cruz, or America. In 1519 a native of Oporto, Fernando de\r\nMagalhaens, called by Spaniards Magallanes, and by English authors\r\nMagellan, after having made several voyages for Portugal to India _via_\r\nGood Hope, quit the Portuguese service dissatisfied, entered the service\r\nof Spain, and undertook the oft-repeated attempt of reaching the east\r\nby sailing west. His particular destination was the Moluccas, which the\r\nSpaniards claimed as lying within the hemisphere granted to them by the\r\ntreaty of Tordesillas in 1494. It appears that Magellan had seen some\r\nmap, of unknown origin, on which was represented a strait instead of\r\nan open sea at the southern point of America—probably the conjecture of\r\nsome geographer, for, says Humboldt, \"dans le moyen âge les conjectures\r\nétaient inscrits religieusement sur les cartes.\" See _Exam. Crit._,\r\ntom. i. pp. 306, 326, 354; tom. ii. pp. 17-26. Sailing from San Lúcar\r\nSeptember 20, 1519, with five ships and 265 men, he reached Rio de\r\nJaneiro on the coast of Brazil on the 13th of December, and from that\r\npoint coasted southward. An attempt to pass through the continent by the\r\nRio de la Plata failed, and on March 31, 1520, the fleet reached Port\r\nSt Julian in about 49° south, where it remained five months until the\r\n24th of August. On the 21st of October Magellan arrived at Cabo de las\r\nVírgenes and the entrance to what seemed, and indeed proved, to be the\r\nlong-desired strait. Having lost one vessel on the eastern coast, and\r\nbeing deserted by another which turned back and sailed for Spain after\r\nhaving entered the strait, with the remaining three he passed on, naming\r\nthe land on the south Tierra del Fuego, from the fires seen burning\r\nthere. Emerging from the strait, which he called Vitoria after one of\r\nhis ships, on the 27th of November he entered and named the Pacific\r\nOcean. Then steering north-west for warmer climes he crossed the line\r\nFebruary 13, 1521, arrived at the Ladrones on the 6th of March, and at\r\nthe Philippines on the 16th of March. This bold navigator, \"second only\r\nto Columbus in the history of nautical exploration,\" was killed on the\r\n27th of April, in a battle with the natives of one of these islands; the\r\nremainder of the force, consisting of 115 men under Caraballo, proceeded\r\non their way, touching at Borneo and other islands, and anchoring on the\r\n8th of November at the Moluccas, their destination. From this point one\r\nof the vessels, the _Vitoria_, in command of Sebastian del Cano, sailed\r\nround the Cape of Good Hope, and reached San Lúcar September 6, 1522,\r\nwith only eighteen survivors of the 265 who had sailed with Magellan.\r\nThus was accomplished the first circumnavigation of the globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NAMING OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nAs to the circumstances attending the naming of the Pacific Ocean, a few\r\nwords may not be out of place. Magellan was accompanied by one Antonio\r\nPigafetta, of Vicenza, afterward Caviliere di Rhodi, who wrote in bad\r\nItalian a narrative of the voyage, which was rewritten and translated\r\ninto French, _Primer voyage autour du Monde, par le Chevallier\r\nPigafetta, sur l'Escadre de Magellan pendant les années 1519, 20, 21,\r\net 22_, by Charles Amoretti. \"Le mercredi, 28 novembre,\" says Pigafetta,\r\nliv. ii. p. 50, \"nous débouquâmes du détroit pour entrer dans la grande\r\nmer, à laquelle nous donnâmes ensuite le nom de mer Pacifique; dans\r\nlaquelle nous naviguâmes pendant le cours de trois mois et vingt jours,\r\nsans goûter d'aucune nourriture fraiche.\" And again, p. 52, \"Pendant cet\r\nespace de trois mois et vingt jours nous parcourûmes à peu près quatre\r\nmille lieues dans cette mer que nous appelâmes Pacifique, parce que\r\ndurant tout le temps de notre traversée nous n'essuyâmes pas le moindre\r\ntempête;\" or, as Ramusio, _Viaggio atorno il mondo fatto et descritto\r\nper M. Antonio Pigafetta_, in _Viaggi_, tom. iii. fol. 393, puts it,\r\n\"Et in questi tre mesi, & venti giorni fecero quattro mila leghe in\r\nvn golfo per questo mar Pacifico, il qual ben si puó chiamar pacifico,\r\nperche in tutto questo tempo senza veder mai terra alcuna, non hebbero\r\nné fortuna di vento, né di altra tempesta.\" Peter Martyr, dec. v. cap.\r\nvii., speaks of it only as \"the huge Ocean\" first found by Vasco Nuñez,\r\nand then called the South Sea. Galvano, _Discov._, p. 142, alludes to\r\nit as a \"mightie sea called Pacificum.\" Oviedo, _Hist. Gen._, tom. ii.\r\np. 22, merely remarks: \"Es aquel estrecho en algunas partes mas ó menos\r\nde media legua, y çircundado de montañas altissimas cargadas de nieve, y\r\ncorre en otra mar que le puso nombre el capitan Fernando de Magallanes,\r\nel _Mar Pacífico_; y es muy profundo, y en algunas partes de veynte é\r\nçinco hasta en treynta braças.\" Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, fol. 120, says,\r\n\"No cabia de gozo por auer hallado aq̃l passo para el otro mar del Sur,\r\npor do pẽsava llegar presto alas yslas del Maluco,\" without any mention\r\nof the word Pacific. The _Sammlung aller Reisebeschreibungen_, tom.\r\nxi. p. 346, gives it essentially the same as Pigafetta: \"In einer Zeit\r\nvon drey Monaten und zwanzig Tagen, legete er viertausend Meilen in\r\neiner See zurück, welche er das friedfertige oder stille Meer nannte;\r\nweil er keinen Sturm auf demselben ausstund, und kein anderes Land sah,\r\nals diese beyden Inseln.\" Kohl, _Die beiden ältesten Karten von Am._,\r\np. 161, is unable to find the name on the old maps: \"Der Name 'Oceano\r\nPacifico,' der auch schon auf den Reisen des Magellan und Loaysa in\r\nSchwung kam, steht nirgends auf unseren Karten.\" Herrera, dec. ii.\r\nlib. ix. cap. xv., describes the exit from the strait in the language\r\nfollowing: \"a veynte y siete de Nouiẽbre, salio al espacioso mar del\r\nSur, dando infinitas gracias a Dios.\" Navarrete, _Viages al Maluco;\r\nPrimero el de Hernando de Magallanes_, in tom. iv. pp. 49-50, of his\r\ncollection says: \"Salió pues Magallanes del _estrecho que nombraron\r\nde Todos los Santos_ el dia 27 de Noviembre de 1520 con las tres naos\r\nTrinidad, Victoria, y Concepcion, y se halló en una mar oscura y gruesa\r\nque era indicio de gran golfo; pero despues le nombraron _Mar Pacífico_,\r\nporque en todo el tiempo que navegaron por él, no tuvieron tempestad\r\nalguna.\" Happening thus, that in this first circumnavigation of the\r\nglobe, as the strangers entered at its southern end the South Sea of\r\nVasco Nuñez, the waters greeted them kindly, in return they gave them\r\na peaceful title; other voyagers entering this same sea at other times\r\ngave to it a far different character.

Voy._, tom. i. pp.\r\n1-26; _Aa_, _Naaukeurige Versameling_, tom. ix. pt. ii. p. 7; _Purchas_,\r\n_His Pilgrimes_, vol. i. pt. ii. pp. 33-46.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAPS AND BOOKS.]\r\n\r\nA manuscript map supposed to have been made by Maiollo in 1519, of\r\nwhich a fac-simile is given in the _Munich Atlas_, no. v., shows the\r\nislands and main-land from Yucatan south and east, closely resembling,\r\nexcept in names of localities, the map of 1518 (see page 133). The\r\neastern part of Brazil is called 'Sante Crucis,' and on the Pearl Coast\r\nis an inscription to the effect that it was discovered by Columbus.\r\n_Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 135-6; _Schmeller_, in _Abhandl.\r\nAkademie der Wissensch._, tom. iv. pt. i. p. 253.\r\n\r\n[1520.] An anonymous pamphlet without date, _Copia der Newen Zeytung_,\r\nis a translation of a letter describing a voyage of two thousand miles\r\nalong the Brazilian coast. Harrisse places it under date of 1520, and\r\nthinks it may furnish grounds for the belief that Magellan was not the\r\nfirst to reach the strait. Varnhagen, _Hist. Brazil_, Madrid, 1854,\r\nmaintains that the voyage described was under Solis and Pinzon in 1508.\r\nHumboldt, _Exam. Crit._, tom. v. p. 249, applies the description to some\r\nlater voyage made between 1525 and 1540.\r\n\r\nTo _Varthema_, _Itinerario Nello Egitto_, Venetia (supposed to be 1520),\r\nis joined an account of Grijalva's voyage to Yucatan in 1518 (see page\r\n132), translated from the original diary of Juan Diaz, chaplain of the\r\nexpedition. Other editions appeared in 1522-26-35. _Discorso sopra lo\r\nitinerario di Lodouico Barthema_, in _Ramusio_, tom. i. fol. 160. The\r\nItinerary of Diaz is not given by Ramusio. _Provinciæ sive Regiones\r\nin India Occidentali_, Valladolid, 1520, is a Latin translation of\r\nan account, by an unknown author, of the conquest of Cuba by Diego\r\nVelazquez. _Pigghe_, _De æquinoctiorum sol_, etc., Paris, supposed to\r\nhave been printed in 1520, has a passage on the lands discovered by\r\nVespucci. _A New Interlude_, London, 1519 or 1520, has a verse in which\r\nthe name America is used.\r\n\r\nA globe made by John Schöner in 1520 is preserved in Nuremberg, and\r\ncopies have been given by Ghillany, Lelewel, and Kohl, of which I give\r\na reduction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SCHÖNER'S GLOBE, 1520.]\r\n\r\nThis is the first drawing to represent all the regions of the New World\r\nas distinct, although not distant, from the Asiatic coast, which is laid\r\ndown mostly as in Behaim's globe, with some imaginary additions round\r\nthe north pole. This separation was undoubtedly a mere conjecture of\r\nthe compiler, for the voyage of Magellan, which might have suggested\r\nsuch an idea, was not yet known or even consummated, and the map shows\r\nno knowledge of the later voyages even to the eastern coast. All the\r\nnorthern discoveries are given as an island, 'Terra Corterealis.'\r\nThe central and southern parts—except their separation from Asia—are\r\naccurately copied from the map of Ptolemy, 1513 (see page 130), although\r\na strait leads through the Isthmus into the South Sea. 'Terra de Cuba'\r\nis the name applied to the northern part of what may be regarded as\r\nthe nucleus which afterward grew into North America, while the southern\r\npart is called Paria. Several names of localities on the coast, as 'C.\r\nDellicontis' and 'C. Bonaventura,' are retained from the map of 1513,\r\nalthough Kohl erroneously calls all the names new and original. To\r\nthe southern continent various names are applied, as America, Brazil,\r\nParia (repeated), Land of Cannibals and of Parrots. On the original\r\nis an antarctic region round the south pole, called 'Brasiliæ Regio,'\r\nand separated from America in lat. 42° south by a strait, although\r\nthe discovery of such a strait could not at the time have been known.\r\n_Humboldt_, _Exam.

The map was made by\r\nPetrus Apianus, and afterward used by him in his cosmography. According\r\nto various descriptions it agrees very nearly with Schöner's globe\r\nexcept in the extreme north, where Engronelant is represented very\r\nmuch as in the map of the Zeni in 1400 (see page 82). _Kunstmann_,\r\n_Entdeckung Am._, pp. 134-5; _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten Karten von Am._,\r\np. 33; _Harrisse_, _Bib.

The map is\r\nvaluable only for its list of names along the whole extent of the gulf\r\ncoast, and it is therefore unnecessary to reproduce it here. Yucatan\r\nseems to be represented as an island. _Stevens' Notes_, pp. 38, 53, pl.\r\niv. no. vii.\r\n\r\nIn 1520 Lucas Vazquez de Aillon and other wealthy citizens of Española\r\nsent two vessels, probably under one Jordan, to the Lucayos Islands\r\nfor slaves. Not succeeding according to their expectations in the\r\nislands, the Spaniards directed their course northward toward the\r\ncountry discovered by Ponce de Leon in 1513, and finally touched the\r\ncoast in about 32° or 33°—Port Royal according to Navarrete; Stevens\r\nsays Cape Fear—a region probably never before visited. They called the\r\ncountry Chicora, and the place of landing was named Cabo de Santa Elena\r\nand Rio Jordan. They made no explorations in any direction. One vessel\r\nand nearly all the slaves were lost on the return. _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\nde Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 69-71; _Kohl's Hist.

Hearing from natives that the\r\nPacific extended as far north as the land he had conquered, he sent\r\nsmall parties to explore and take possession, which they did at two\r\npoints, Tehuantepec and Zacatula, before the end of 1521. Cortés was\r\nfully acquainted with the cosmographic theories of the time, and was\r\nenthusiastic in their application to the discovery of islands and main,\r\nrich in spices and precious metals. It was now established in a general\r\nway, as shown by the best maps, that the newly discovered lands were\r\nnot the main Asiatic continent of Marco Polo, but a great south-eastern\r\nprojection of that continent, probably separated from it by a strait.\r\nCortés' idea was to sail down the coast as he termed it, northward at\r\nfirst, until he should either reach the rich Indian lands, or on the\r\nway find the strait which should afford a short cut from Spain to those\r\nlands. His efforts will be briefly noticed here in chronologic order,\r\nbut fully presented in another part of my work. The best and almost only\r\nauthority is _Cortés_, _Cartas_.\r\n\r\n[1521.] Juan Ponce de Leon, learning from other voyagers that the land\r\nof Florida discovered by him was not, as he had believed it to be, an\r\nisland, fitted out an expedition in Puerto Rico and sailed to repeat in\r\nFlorida the glorious achievements of Cortés in New Spain. He reached the\r\nwest coast of the peninsula, but was killed by the natives soon after\r\nlanding, and his men returned without having accomplished their object.\r\n\r\n_Peter Martyr_, _De nvper svb D. Carolo repertis Insulis_, Basiliæ,\r\n1521, is the first edition of a part of the fourth decade.\r\n\r\n[1522.] Pomponius Mela, _De Orbis Sitv_, Basiliæ, 1522, reproduced\r\nApianus' map of 1520 (see page 137), also _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten\r\nKarten_, p. 33. The _Ptolemy_ of this year, edited by Frisius, contains\r\ntwo maps resembling in their general appearance the Ptolemy map of\r\n1513, and showing but little advance in geographical knowledge. These\r\nmaps are also in the edition of 1525. _Asher's Catalogue_, no. civ.,\r\nBerlin, 1873. _Translationus hispanischer_, etc., n.p., n.d., has a\r\nslight notice of the City of Mexico. _Ein Schöne Newe Zeytung_, Augsburg\r\n(1522), notices the voyages of Columbus and the conquest of Mexico.\r\n_Of the newe lãdes and of ye people founde by the Messengers of the\r\nKynge of portygale_, attributed to this year, is regarded as the first\r\nbook in English to treat of America, which it calls Armenica. _Cortés_,\r\n_Carta de Relaciõ_, Seville, 1522, is the letter dated October 30, 1520,\r\nsupposed to be the conqueror's second letter, the first having been\r\nlost. Eight other editions or translations appeared in various forms\r\nbefore 1532.\r\n\r\nIn 1522 Pascual de Andagoya followed the west coast of America southward\r\nfrom Panamá, to a point six or seven days' sail below the gulf of San\r\nMiguel in the province of Birú (Peru), a little beyond Point Pinos.\r\nInformation obtained during this expedition concerning more southern\r\nlands, furnished the motive for the conquest of Peru undertaken a few\r\nyears later by Francisco Pizarro. _Pascual de Andagoya_, _Narrative_,\r\npp. 40-1.\r\n\r\nGil Gonzalez Dávila with a fleet of four vessels sailed from the islands\r\nin the Bay of Panamá, January 21, 1522, to explore the South Sea coast\r\nnorth-westward. Reaching the gulf of Nicoya, the limit of Espinosa's\r\nvoyage, Gil Gonzalez proceeded by land and discovered Lake Nicaragua.\r\nThe pilot Andres Niño continued westward, discovered and named the gulf\r\nof Fonseca, and reached, according to Herrera, dec. iii. lib. iv. cap.\r\nv.-vi., the province of Chorotega, having discovered 350 leagues of\r\nsea-coast from Nicoya, or 650 leagues from the gulf of San Miguel. Peter\r\nMartyr places Niño's ultimate limit at 300 leagues beyond the gulf of\r\nSan Vicente; Ribero's map at 140 leagues west of the bay of Fonseca.\r\nKohl, _Beiden ältesten Karten von Am._, pp. 163-9, thinks he probably\r\nreached the mountains south of Soconusco.

Not long afterward the cities of Granada\r\nand Leon were founded, and communication with Nicaragua from the south\r\nbecame of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn 1522 Pedro de Alvarado occupied Tututepec on the Pacific; while at\r\nZacatula a _villa_ was founded, and a beginning made there on several\r\nvessels for exploration northward. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, Letter of May\r\n15, 1522.\r\n\r\n[1523.] Francisco de Garay fitted out a new fleet of eleven vessels,\r\nwith 850 men, which sailed from Jamaica June 26, 1523. This force was\r\nintended for the conquest and settlement of Pánuco, but soon united with\r\nthe army of Cortés without having accomplished anything of importance.\r\n_Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. iii. pp. 67-9; _Herrera_, _Hist.\r\nGen._, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. v.-vi.; _Peter Martyr_, dec. vii. cap.\r\nv.; _Cortes_, _Carta tercera de Relaciõ_, Seville, 1523.

Other editions are mentioned as having appeared\r\nin 1523, 1524, 1534, 1536, and 1537.\r\n\r\n[1524.] _Apianus_, _Cosmographicus Liber_, Landshutæ, 1524, contains\r\na short chapter on America, which the author describes as an island,\r\nbecause he says it is surrounded by water; furthermore, he affirms\r\nthis land was named from Vespucci, its discoverer. The map of\r\n_Solinus-Camers_, 1520, is repeated in this and in several succeeding\r\neditions of the cosmography. _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, pp. 134-5.\r\nFrancis, _De Orbis Sitv ac Descriptione_, Antwerp, 1524, also describes\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 Cortés' fleet at Zacatula was not yet launched, the work having\r\nbeen delayed by fire. The conquest of Colima had however made known a\r\ngood port, and brought new rumors of rich islands further north. The\r\nconqueror's plans were unchanged and his enthusiasm undiminished. His\r\nuse of the term \"la costa abajo,\" or down the coast, when he meant\r\nto sail northward, has sadly confused many writers as to his real\r\nintentions, and as to his ideas of the strait. _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\nLetter of Oct. 15, 1524.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 was made the first official French expedition to the New\r\nWorld. A fleet of four vessels was made ready under Giovanni Verrazano\r\nat Dieppe, but three of his ships were separated from him in some\r\ninexplicable manner before leaving European waters; and in the remaining\r\none, the _Dauphine_, with fifty men, he sailed on the 17th of January,\r\n1524, from an island near Madeira. After a voyage of forty-nine days,\r\nduring which time he sailed 900 leagues, Verrazano struck the United\r\nStates coast in about latitude 34°, perhaps at Cape Fear. Thence he\r\nsailed first southward fifty leagues, then turning about he followed\r\nthe coast northward, frequently touching, to Newfoundland, whence he\r\nreturned to Dieppe in July, 1524. Verrazano in his journal mentions\r\nonly one date, and names but one locality; consequently there is much\r\ndifference of opinion concerning his landings.\r\n\r\nThe southern limit of the voyage, so far as it can be known, was in the\r\nvicinity of Cape Romain, South Carolina, though some authors, apparently\r\nwithout sufficient authority—the voyager says he saw palms—have placed\r\nthe limit in Florida. It is probable that a large part of the United\r\nStates coast was for the first time explored during this voyage, which\r\nalso completed the discovery of the whole eastern shore-line of America,\r\nexcept probably a short but indefinite distance in South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, between the limits reached by Ponce de Leon in 1513 and by\r\nVerrazano; one intermediate point having also been visited by Aillon\r\nin 1520. _Relatione di Giouanni da Verrazzano Fiorentìno della terra\r\nper lui scoperta in nome di sua Maestà, scritta in Dieppa, adi 8_,\r\nLuglio, MDXXIIII., in _Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 420.

Copy in _Kohl_, p. 290.)\r\n\r\nIn 1522 Pedro de Alvarado had accomplished the conquest of Tehuantepec\r\non the South Sea; in 1524 and the following years he extended his\r\nexplorations and conquests by land across the isthmus over all the\r\nnorth-western region of Central America, joining his conquests to\r\nthose of his countrymen from Panamá. In 1523 Cristóbal de Olid made\r\nan expedition by water to Honduras in the service of Cortés, founding\r\na settlement; and in 1524 Cortés himself marched overland from\r\nMexico to Honduras. _Lettres de Pédro de Alvarado à Fernan Cortés_,\r\nin _Ternaux-Compans_, _Voy._, série i. tom. x. pp. 107-50, and in\r\n_Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, tom. iii. fol. 296-300; _Peter Martyr_, dec.\r\nviii. cap. v. x.; _Oviedo_, _Hist.

For references to Pizarro's discovery see a later chapter\r\nof this volume.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the leading pilots and cosmographers of Spain and Portugal,\r\nknown as the Council of Badajoz, was convened for the purpose of\r\nsettling disputed questions between the two governments. Failing in\r\nits primary purpose, the council nevertheless contributed largely to\r\na better knowledge of New World geography. Indeed, from this time the\r\nEuropean governments may be supposed to have had, and to have delineated\r\non their official charts, tolerably accurate ideas of the general form\r\nof America and of its relation to Asia, except in the north-west,\r\nalthough the existence of a passage through the continent was still\r\nfirmly believed in. Writers on cosmography and compilers of published\r\nmaps did not, however, for a long time obtain the knowledge lodged in\r\nthe hands of government officials.\r\n\r\n[1525.] The man who accompanied Magellan in 1519, but left him after\r\nentering the strait and returned with one vessel to Spain, was named\r\nEstévan Gomez. In 1525 this captain was sent by Spain to search for a\r\ncorresponding strait in the north. Although an official expedition, and\r\nthe only one ever sent by Spain to northern parts, no journal has been\r\npreserved, and only slight particulars derived from the old chroniclers\r\nare known. Gomez expected to find a strait somewhere between Florida\r\nand Newfoundland, probably not knowing the result of Verrazano's voyage\r\nof the preceding year. Cabot was at the time piloto mayor in Spain, and\r\nif Verrazano had, as is claimed for him by some, reached the southern\r\nUnited States coasts, it is not likely that Gomez would have looked\r\nthere so confidently for his strait. This voyage lasted about ten\r\nmonths, and in it Gomez is supposed to have explored the coast from\r\nNewfoundland to a point below New York—possibly to Georgia or Florida.\r\n_Peter Martyr_, dec. vi. cap. x.; _Herrera_, _Hist.

According to Harrisse, _Fries_, _Auslegung der Mercarthen oder\r\nCartha Marina_, Strasburg, 1525, contains a map of the world, including\r\nAmerica, but Kohl states that this map, although made in 1525, was not\r\npublished till 1530. Other publications of the year are: _Pietro Arias_\r\n(Pedrarias Dávila), _Lettere di Pietro Arias Capitano generale, della\r\nconquista del paese del Mar Occeano_, written from Darien, and printed\r\nwithout place or date; _Pigafetta_, _Le voyage et nauigation faict par\r\nles Espaignolz es Isles de Mollucques_, an abridgment of the original\r\naccount by the author, who was with Magellan; _Cortes_, _La quarta\r\nRelacion_, Toledo, 1525, dated October 15, 1524.\r\n\r\nGarcía de Loaisa sailed from Corunna July 24, 1525, to follow Magellan's\r\ntrack. Passing through the strait between January and May, 1526, he\r\narrived at the Moluccas in October. _Viages al Maluco, Segundo el del\r\nComendador Fr.

Guevara decided to steer for the coast of\r\nNew Spain, which was first seen in the middle of July; and on the 25th\r\nhe anchored at Tehuantepec. _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom. v. pp.\r\n176-81, 224-5.\r\n\r\nCortés' exploring vessels, begun in 1522—the first having been burned\r\non the stocks, others were built in their place—were now, after long\r\ndelay, nearly ready to sail; and Guevara's vessel was brought up from\r\nTehuantepec to join them. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, Letter of September, 1526.\r\n\r\nAillon, in 1523, was made adelantado of Chicora, the country discovered\r\nby him in 1520, and immediately prepared a new expedition with a view\r\nto colonize the country, explore the coasts, and to find, if possible,\r\na passage to India. The preparations were not completed until July,\r\n1526, when he sailed from Española with six vessels, 500 men, and\r\nninety horses. He reached the Rio Jordan—perhaps St Helena Sound, South\r\nCarolina—and thence made a careful exploration northward, at least\r\nto Cape Fear, and probably much farther. Aillon died on the 18th of\r\nOctober, and after much internal dissension 150 men, all that remained\r\nalive, returned to Santo Domingo. _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, tom.\r\niii. pp. 71-4, 153-60; _Kunstmann_, _Entdeckung Am._, p. 71.\r\n\r\nOviedo, _De la Natural hystoria de las Indias_, Toledo, 1526, describes\r\nthe New World, but this book is not the great historical work,\r\nlately printed, by the same author. It may be found also in _Barcia_,\r\n_Historiadores Primitivos_, and in _Ramusio_.\r\n\r\nSebastian Cabot attempted a voyage to India in 1526, sailing with\r\nfour vessels in April, with the intention of bearing succor to Loaisa.\r\nOwing to insubordination among his officers, and other misfortunes, he\r\nreached only the Rio de la Plata, and after extensive explorations in\r\nthat region, returned to Spain, having been absent four years. _Oviedo_,\r\n_Hist.

The two vessels sailed in company\r\nto latitude 53°, and reached the coast, where, on the 1st of July, they\r\nwere separated by a storm, and one of them was probably lost. The other,\r\nunder John Rut, turned southward, followed the coast of New England,\r\noften landing, probably reached Chicora, and returned to England _via_\r\nthe West India Islands, arriving early in October. _Hakluyt's Divers\r\nVoy._, pp. 27, 33; _Biddle's Mem.

But an order from\r\nSpain required the fleet to be sent to India direct—instead of by the\r\nroundabout route proposed by Cortés—for the relief of Loaisa; and the\r\nthree vessels sailed from Zacatula in October under Saavedra, arriving\r\nsafely in India. Guevara's ship was too worm-eaten to accompany them;\r\nbut several vessels were already on the stocks at Tehuantepec to replace\r\nthose sent across the ocean. _Sutil y Mexicana_, _Viage_, introd. pp.\r\nvi.-xi.; _Navarrete_, _Col.

It was afterward printed as _The booke made by the right\r\nworshipful M. Robert Thorne_, in _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. i. pp. 214-20.\r\n\r\nIn 1526 a commissioner was appointed to correct the Spanish charts.\r\nFernando Colon was charged with the revision, and in 1527 a map was made\r\ncalled _Carta universal en que se contiene todo lo que del mundo se ha\r\ndescubierto fasta agora_. This map has been preserved, and a fac-simile\r\nis given in _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten Karten von Am._ It shows the whole\r\neastern coast line from the strait of Magellan to Greenland, and the\r\nwestern coast from Panamá to the vicinity of Soconusco, and indicates\r\nthat the information in possession of the Spanish government was\r\nremarkably accurate and complete. Yucatan is represented as an island,\r\nand the discoveries on the Pacific side of South America are not laid\r\ndown; otherwise this map varies but little except in names from a map\r\nmade by Diego Ribero, in 1529, of which I shall give a copy. _Kohl_,\r\n_Beiden ältesten Karten von Am._, pp. 1-24; _Humboldt_, _Exam.

It contains some\r\nimprovements and additions to Colon's map of 1527 with the same title,\r\nalthough criticised, perhaps justly, by Stevens as partisan in its\r\ndistribution of the new regions among the European powers. I give a\r\ncopy reduced from the full-sized fac-simile in _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten\r\nKarten von Am_.\r\n\r\nGreenland is called Labrador and is joined to the continent, as the\r\nseparating strait had not at the time been explored. It will be noticed\r\nthat Greenland is far less accurately laid down on this and other late\r\nmaps than on some earlier ones which are supposed to have derived some\r\nof their details from northern sources. Labrador, Newfoundland, and\r\nNova Scotia have the general name of Bacallaos. Many of the numerous\r\nislands along the coast are named in the original. Corresponding\r\nperhaps to the New England and middle United States we have the 'Tiera\r\nde Estevã Gomez,' stated by an inscription to have been discovered by\r\nthe Spaniards in 1525. From this land to Florida extends the 'Tiera de\r\nAyllon,' between which and 'Nveva España' comes the 'Tiera de Garay,'\r\nthus dividing nearly all of the northern continent among the Spaniards.\r\nThe West India Islands have here their true number, position, and names.\r\nYucatan is given in its true proportions but is separated by a strait\r\nfrom the main-land. The South Sea coast is represented only to the limit\r\nof the voyage of Gil Gonzalez Dávila on the north, and extends southward\r\nto the port of Chinchax in about latitude 10° south, including,\r\naccording to an inscription, the countries which had been reached by\r\nPizarro in 1527. The form of South America is correctly laid down and\r\nthe name 'Mvndvs Novvs' is applied to the whole, which is divided into\r\nthe provinces of 'Castilla del Oro,' 'Perv,' 'Tiera del Brasil,' 'Tiera\r\nde Patagones,' and 'Tiera de Fernã de Magallaes,' or land of Magellan.\r\nSouth of the strait is the 'Tiera de los Fuegos,' whose true form and\r\nextent were not known until Schouten and Le Maire doubled Cape Horn in\r\n1616.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus far I have copied or mentioned all maps which could throw any light\r\non the progress of geographical knowledge, and have endeavored to give\r\na statement of all the voyages by which this progress was made. Thus\r\nfar we have seen the coasts of both North and South America, except in\r\nthe south-west and the far north-west, more or less carefully explored\r\nby European voyagers; we have seen the New World recognized as distinct\r\nfor the most part from Asia, a tolerably correct idea of its form and\r\nextent given by government pilots, and the name America applied, except\r\non official maps, to the southern continent. Henceforth voyages to\r\nthe parts already discovered become of common occurrence, and numerous\r\nmaps, both in manuscript and print, are made, no one of which I shall\r\nattempt to follow. In the expeditions of the next and concluding ten\r\nyears of this Summary I shall notice chiefly those by which a knowledge\r\nwas acquired of the countries lying toward California and the great\r\nNorthwest, presenting several maps to illustrate this part of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[1530.] During the absence of Cortés in Spain no progress had been\r\nmade in maritime exploration; and by 1530 his ships on the stocks at\r\nTehuantepec were ruined, but he made haste to build more. _Cortés_,\r\n_Cartas_, letters of Oct. 10, 1530, and April 20, 1532.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NUÑO DE GUZMAN.]\r\n\r\nNuño de Guzman, formerly president of the audiencia of New Spain, and\r\nthe inveterate enemy of Cortés, undertook with a large force, recruited\r\nin Mexico, the conquest of the region lying to the north-west of that\r\ncity. The northern limit of his conquest in 1530-1 was Culiacan, between\r\nwhich and Mexico the whole country was brought under Spanish control by\r\nexpeditions sent by Guzman in all directions under different leaders.\r\n_Relation di Nvnno di Gvsman_, in _Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 331, and\r\nabridged in _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. iv. p. 1556; _Jornada que\r\nhizo Nuño de Guzman á la Nueva Galicia_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. de\r\nDoc._, tom. ii.; _Primera relacion_, p. 288; _Tercera relacion_, p. 439;\r\n_Cuarta relacion_, p. 461; _Doc. para Hist. de Mex._, serie iii. p. 669;\r\n_Mota Padilla_, _Conquista de Nueva Galicia_, MS. of 1742; _Oviedo_,\r\n_Hist.

The\r\nfollowing map, made in 1544, illustrates still further the absurdities\r\ncirculated for many years under the name of geography. Scores of\r\nadditional examples might be given.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RUSCELLI'S MAP, 1544.]\r\n\r\n[1532.] At last, in the middle of 1532, Cortés was able to despatch from\r\nAcapulco two vessels, under Hurtado de Mendoza and Mazuela, to make the\r\nfirst voyage up the coast beyond Colima. Mendoza touched at Santiago and\r\nat the port of Jalisco, near the later San Blas, discovering the islands\r\nof Magdalena, or Tres Marías. Then they took refuge from a storm in a\r\nport located only by conjecture, probably on the Sonora coast, where\r\nafter a time the vessels parted. Mendoza went on up the coast. Having\r\nlanded and ascended the Rio Tamotchala—now the Fuerte—he was killed,\r\nwith most of his men, by the Indians. The rest were massacred a little\r\nlater, when the vessel grounded and broke up at the mouth of the Rio\r\nPetatlan, or Sinaloa. Meanwhile, Mazuela with the other vessel returning\r\ndown the coast was driven ashore in Banderas Bay, where all his men but\r\ntwo or three were killed by the natives. Authorities, being voluminous,\r\ncomplicated, and of necessity fully presented elsewhere, are omitted\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n_Cortes_, _De Insvlis nvper inventis_, Coloniæ, 1532, is a translation\r\nof Hernan Cortés' second and third letters, with Peter Martyr's _De\r\nInsulis_, and a letter from Fray Martin de Valencia, dated Yucatan, June\r\n12, 1531, with some letters from Zumárraga, first bishop of Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Grynævs_, _Novvs Orbis_, Paris and Basle, 1532, is a collection of the\r\nvoyages of Columbus, Pinzon, Vespucci, and others. In this work the\r\nassertion is made that Vespucci discovered America before Columbus,\r\nwhich aroused the wrath of Las Casas, and seems to have originated\r\nthe subsequent bitter attacks on Vespucci. About the maps originally\r\npublished with this work there seems to be some doubt, most copies, like\r\nmy own, having no map. According to _Stevens' Notes_, pp. 19, 51-2,\r\npl. iii. no. 4, the Paris edition of _Grynæus_ contained a map made\r\nby Orontius Fine in 1531. The following is a reduction from Stevens'\r\nfac-simile on Mercator's projection:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ORONTIUS FINE'S MAP, 1531.]\r\n\r\nAll of the New World, so far as explored, is represented with tolerable\r\naccuracy, but the unexplored South Sea coast is made to extend westward\r\nfrom the region of Acapulco, and to join the southern coast of Asia,\r\nwhich is laid down from the ancient chronicles. Instead of being, as\r\nStevens terms it, a \"culmination of absurdities,\" I regard this map as\r\nmore consistent with the knowledge of the time than any other printed\r\nduring the first half of the sixteenth century. North America when found\r\nwas regarded as Asia; South America was at first supposed to be a large\r\nisland, and later an immense south-eastern extension of Asia; subsequent\r\nexplorations, chiefly that of Magellan, showed the existence of a\r\nvast ocean between southern America and southern Asia; official maps\r\nleft unexplored regions blank, expressing no theory as to the northern\r\nextension of the Pacific Ocean; other maps, as we have seen, without\r\nany authority whatever, make that ocean extend north and completely\r\nseparate Asia from the New World. The present map, however, clings to\r\nthe original idea and makes North America an eastern extension of Asia,\r\ngiving the name America to the southern continent.\r\n\r\nThe map in the Basle edition of _Grynæus_, also given in _Stevens'\r\nNotes_, pl. iv. no. 4, closely resembles _Schöner's Globe_ of 1520 (see\r\npage 137).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOWER CALIFORNIA DISCOVERED.]\r\n\r\n[1533.] The expedition of Becerra, Grijalva, and Jimenez, sent out by\r\nCortés to search for Hurtado de Mendoza and to continue north-western\r\ndiscoveries, sailed from Santiago in November. This voyage, like those\r\nfollowing, will be fully treated elsewhere in this work. The only\r\nresult, so far as the purposes of this chapter are concerned, was the\r\ndiscovery of the Revilla Gigedo group of islands and the southern part\r\nof the peninsula of Lower California, supposed then to be an island.\r\nJimenez landed and was killed at Santa Cruz, now known as La Paz. The\r\nsubsequent expedition of 1535-6, headed by Cortés in person, added only\r\nvery slightly to geographical knowledge of the north-west. Many points\r\nwere touched and named along the coast; but comparatively few can be\r\ndefinitely located except by the aid of information afforded by the\r\nearlier explorations of Guzman by land.\r\n\r\nSchöner, _Opvscvlvm Geographicvm_, supposed to have been printed in\r\n1533, maintains that the New World is part of Asia, and contains, so far\r\nas known, the first charge against Vespucci. _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._,\r\ntom. v. pp. 174-5. Other books of the year are: _Franck_, _Weltbuch_,\r\nTübingen, 1533, which includes America in a description of the world;\r\nand _Zummaraga_, _Botschafft des Grossmechtigsten Königs Dauid_, n.p.,\r\nn.d., containing a letter from Mexico dated in 1532.\r\n\r\n[1534.] In 1534, 1535, and 1540, Jacques Cartier made three voyages for\r\nFrance, in which Newfoundland and the gulf and river of St Lawrence\r\nwere carefully explored. _Prima Relatione di Iacqves Carthier della\r\nTerra Nvova detta la Nuoua Francia, trouata nell'anno_ MDXXXIIII., in\r\n_Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 435; _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. iii. pp. 201-36;\r\n_Sammlung alter Reisebeschreibungen_, tom. xv. p. 29.\r\n\r\nSimon de Alcazaba sailed from San Lúcar in September, 1534, with two\r\nships and 280 men, intending to conquer and settle the western coast of\r\nSouth America south of Peru. After spending a long time in the strait\r\nof Magellan, he was finally prevented by the mutiny of his men from\r\nproceeding farther. His explorations in the Patagonian regions were more\r\nextensive than had been made before. Seventy-five men, the remnant of\r\nhis expedition, reached Española in September, 1535, one vessel having\r\nbeen wrecked on the coast of Brazil. _Oviedo_, _Hist.

Steinhowel, _Chronica\r\nBeschreibung_, Franckenfort, 1535, has a chapter on 'America discovered\r\nin 1497.'\r\n\r\n[1536.] In April, 1528, as we have seen, Pánfilo de Narvaez had landed\r\non the west coast of Florida, probably at Tampa Bay, and attempted\r\nwith three hundred men to reach Pánuco by land. The company gradually\r\nmelted from famine, sickness, and battles with the savages, until\r\nonly Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca with a few companions remained. They\r\nwere held as slaves by the natives of the Gulf coast for six years;\r\nand then escaping, traversed Texas, Chihuahua, and Sonora, by a route\r\nwhich has not been very definitely fixed. Cabeza de Vaca with three\r\ncompanions reached the Spanish settlements in northern Sinaloa early in\r\n1536, and their reports served as a powerful incentive to more extended\r\nexploration. _Relatione che fece Alvaro Nvnez detto Capo di vacca_, in\r\n_Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 310-30; _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. iv.\r\np. 1499; _Cabeça de Vaca's Relation_, New York, 1871; _Ternaux-Compans_,\r\n_Voy._, série i. tom, vii.; _Oviedo_, _Hist.

There are vague reports\r\nthat Grijalva sailed westward from Peru and made a long cruise in the\r\nPacific, visiting various islands which cannot be located. _Herrera_,\r\n_Hist.

Here\r\nSoto died, and the remnant of his company, after penetrating farther\r\nwest to the buffalo country, floated down the Mississippi and returned\r\nto Mexico in 1543. Soto's travels are esteemed by Kohl as \"the principal\r\nsource of knowledge regarding these regions, for more than a hundred\r\nyears.\" _Discov. and Conq. of Terra Florida_, _Hakluyt Soc._, London,\r\n1851; _Selection of Curious Voy._, _Sup. to Hakluyt_, London, 1812, p.\r\n689; _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. iv. p. 1532; _Ferdinands von Soto\r\nReise nach Florida_, in _Sammlung_, tom. xvi. p. 395.\r\n\r\n[1539.] In August, 1539, three vessels under Alonso de Camargo were\r\ndespatched from Seville for India _via_ the South Sea, and reached Cabo\r\nde las Vírgenes January 20, 1540. One of the vessels was wrecked in the\r\nstrait of Magellan; another returned to Spain, and the third entered\r\nthe Pacific, and finally, after touching Chile in 38° 30', arrived at\r\nArequipa in Peru. This voyage is supposed to have afforded the first\r\nknowledge of the intermediate coast between the strait of Magellan and\r\nPeru. _Diccionario Univ._, app. tom. x. p. 807; _Herrera_, _Hist.

Marcos de Niza reached the Pueblo\r\ntowns of Zuñi and brought back greatly exaggerated reports of the\r\nwealth of the people and the magnificence of their cities. _Relatione\r\ndel Reverendo Fra Marco da Nizza_, in _Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 356;\r\n_Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, vol. iv. p. 1560; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n_Col. de Doc._, tom. iii. p. 325; _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. iii. pp.\r\n366-73; _Ternaux-Compans_, _Voy._, série i. tom. ix. p. 256. See also\r\n_Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner_, in _Pacific R. R. Reports_, vol. iii.\r\npp. 104-8.\r\n\r\nNiza's report prompted Cortés to renewed efforts in his Californian\r\nenterprise, and in July, 1539, Francisco de Ulloa was sent from Acapulco\r\nwith three vessels to prosecute the discoveries by water. Ulloa spent\r\nsome time in the port of Santiago for repairs, lost one vessel in a gale\r\nnear the entrance to the gulf, visited Santa Cruz, and then followed\r\nthe main coast to the mouth of the Colorado, and returned along the\r\ncoast of the Peninsula to Santa Cruz, where he arrived on the 18th of\r\nOctober. From this place he doubled the southern point of California,\r\nand sailed up the western coast to Cedros Island, and somewhat beyond.\r\nDuring the whole voyage he touched and named many places, whose names\r\nhave seldom been retained, but some of which may be with tolerable\r\ncertainty identified. In April the vessels separated, one returning by a\r\nquick passage to Colima. Ulloa himself with the other vessel attempted\r\nto continue his explorations northward, with what success is not\r\nknown. According to Gomara and Bernal Diaz, he returned after several\r\nmonths spent in fruitless endeavors to reach more northern latitudes;\r\nother authorities state that he was never heard from. Preciado, who\r\naccompanied the expedition, wrote of it a detailed but not very clear\r\nnarrative or journal. _Relatione dello scoprimento che nel nome di\r\nDio va à far l'armata dell' illustrissimo Fernando Cortese_, etc.\r\n(Preciado's Relation), in _Ramusio_, tom. iii. 339-54, and in _Hakluyt's\r\nVoy._, vol. iii. pp. 397-424; _Gomara_, _Hist.

While in Sonora, he sent forth Melchor Diaz,\r\nwho explored the head of the gulf, and the mouths of the rivers, Gila\r\nand Colorado, where he found letters left by Alarcon. See _infra_. From\r\nCibola, Coronado sent Garcia Lopez de Cárdenas west, who passed through\r\nthe Moqui towns and followed the Colorado for some distance. Coronado\r\nreturned in 1542. _Relatione che mando Francesco Vazquez di Coronado_,\r\nin _Ramusio_, tom. iii. fol. 359; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. de\r\nDoc._, tom. iii. p. 511. _Hakluyt's Voy._, vol. iii. pp. 373-82, has the\r\nsame and Gomara's account. _Ternaux-Compans_, _Voyages_, série i. tom.\r\nix., gives the relations of Coronado, Castañeda, and Jaramillo. See also\r\n_Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner_, in _Pacific R. R. Reports_, vol. iii.\r\npp. 108-12; _Simpson_, in _Report of Smithsonian Institution_, 1869.\r\n\r\nTo coöperate with Coronado's land expedition, Hernando de Alarcon\r\nwas despatched from Acapulco in May, 1540. Alarcon followed the coast\r\nto the head of the gulf, and ascended the Buena Guia (Colorado) some\r\neighty-five leagues in boats, but hearing nothing from Coronado, he\r\nreturned after burying letters, which, as we have seen, were found by\r\nMelchor Diaz.

Nueva-España_, edited by Lorenzana, Mexico, 1770, p.\r\n325.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CASTILLO'S MAP, 1541.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA DISCOVERED.]\r\n\r\nA similar chart is mentioned by Señor Navarrete as existing in the\r\nhydrographic archives in Madrid. The second, from the _Munich Atlas_,\r\nno. vi., is of uncertain date. Peschel places it between 1532 and 1540;\r\nand it was certainly made about that time, as Yucatan is represented as\r\nan island, and California as a peninsula, although later it came again\r\nto be considered an island, as at its first discovery.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MANUSCRIPT MAP, AUTHOR UNKNOWN, SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN\r\n   DRAWN BETWEEN 1532 AND 1510.]\r\n\r\nThis, then, was Discovery. And in the progress of discovery we may\r\ntrace the progress of mind. We can but wonder now, when we see our\r\nlittle earth belted with steam and lightning, how reluctantly the infant\r\nintellect left its cradle to examine its surroundings. Wrapped in its\r\nMediterranean swaddlings, it crept forth timidly, tremblingly, slowly\r\ngaining courage with experience, until, throwing off impediments, it\r\ntrod the earth in the fearless pride of manhood. Like all science,\r\nphilosophy, and religion, cosmography was at first a superstition.\r\nWalled within narrow limits, as we have seen, by imaginary frost and\r\nfire, shaken from fear of heaven above and hell beneath, there is little\r\nwonder that the ancients dared not venture far from home; nor that, when\r\nmen began to explore parts unknown, there should appear that romance\r\nof geography so fascinating to the Greek mind, that halo thrown by the\r\ndimness of time and distance over strange seas and lands. From this time\r\nto that of the adaptation of the magnet to purposes of navigation, about\r\na score of centuries, there was little progress in discovery.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange how the secrets of nature, one after another, reveal\r\nthemselves according to man's necessities? Who would have looked for\r\nthe deliverance of pent-up humanity from certain mysterious qualities\r\nin magnetic iron ore, which floated toward the north that side of a\r\ncork on which it was placed? When Vasco da Gama and Columbus almost\r\nsimultaneously opened to Europe oceanic highways through which were\r\ndestined to flow the treasures of the eastern and the western Indies,\r\nthen it was that a new quality was discovered in the loadstone; for in\r\naddition to its power to take up iron, it was found to possess the rare\r\nvirtue of drawing gold and silver from distant parts into the coffers\r\nof European princes; then it was that paths were marked out across the\r\nSea of Darkness, and ships passed to and fro bearing the destroyers of\r\nnations, and laden with their spoils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AND HIS DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n1492-1500.\r\n\r\n     EARLY EXPERIENCES—THE COMPACT—EMBARKATION AT PALOS—THE\r\n     VOYAGE—DISCOVERY OF LAND—UNFAVORABLE COMPARISON WITH\r\n     THE PARADISE OF MARCO POLO—CRUISE AMONG THE ISLANDS—ONE\r\n     NATURE EVERYWHERE—DESERTION OF PINZON—WRECK OF THE\r\n     SANTA MARÍA—THE FORTRESS OF LA NAVIDAD ERECTED—RETURN\r\n     TO SPAIN—RIGHTS OF CIVILIZATION—THE PAPAL BULL\r\n     OF PARTITION—FONSECA APPOINTED SUPERINTENDENT OF\r\n     THE INDIES—SECOND VOYAGE—NAVIDAD IN RUINS—ISABELA\r\n     ESTABLISHED—DISCONTENT OF THE COLONISTS—EXPLORATIONS OF THE\r\n     INTERIOR—COASTING CUBA, AND DISCOVERY OF JAMAICA—FAILURE\r\n     OF COLUMBUS AS GOVERNOR—INTERCOURSE WITH SPAIN—DESTRUCTION\r\n     OF THE INDIANS—GOVERNMENT OF THE INDIES—DIEGO AND\r\n     BARTOLOMÉ COLON—CHARGES AGAINST THE ADMIRAL—COMMISSION\r\n     OF INQUIRY APPOINTED—SECOND RETURN TO SPAIN—THIRD\r\n     VOYAGE—TRINIDAD DISCOVERED—SANTO DOMINGO FOUNDED—THE\r\n     ROLDAN REBELLION—FRANCISCO DE BOBADILLA APPOINTED TO\r\n     SUPERSEDE COLUMBUS—ARBITRARY AND INIQUITOUS CONDUCT OF\r\n     BOBADILLA—COLUMBUS SENT IN CHAINS TO SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the developments of progress the agent, however subordinate to\r\nthe event, cannot fail to command our intelligent curiosity. The fact\r\nis less one with us than the factor. The instrument is nearer us in\r\npulsating humanity than the event, which is the result of inexorable\r\ncausations wholly beyond our knowledge. That America could not have\r\nremained much longer hidden from the civilized world does not lessen the\r\nvivid interest which attaches to the man Columbus, as he plods along the\r\ndusty highway toward Huelva, leading by the hand his boy, and bearing\r\nupon his shoulders the more immediate destinies of nations.\r\n\r\nNor are we indifferent to the agencies that evolved the agent. Every\r\nsignal success springs from a fortuitous conjunction of talent\r\nand opportunity; from a coalition of taste or training with the\r\napproaching fancy or dominant idea of the times. While assisting his\r\nfather wool-combing, the youthful Genoese was toughening his sinews\r\nand acquiring habits of industry; while studying geometry and Latin\r\nat Pavia, while serving as sailor in the Mediterranean, or afterward\r\ncruising the high seas, he was knitting more firmly the tissues of his\r\nmind, and strengthening his courage for the life-conflict which was to\r\nfollow. Without such discipline, in vain from the north and south and\r\nwest might Progress come whispering him secrets; for inspiration without\r\naction is but impalpable breath, leaving no impression, and genius\r\nunseasoned by application decomposes to corruption all the more rank by\r\nreason of its richness.\r\n\r\nHis marriage with the daughter of Bartolommeo Perestrello, a\r\ndistinguished navigator under Prince Henry; his map-making as means\r\nof support; his residence on the isle of Porto Santo, and his interest\r\nwhile there in maritime discovery; his conversations and correspondence\r\nwith navigators and cosmographers in various quarters; his zealous\r\nstudy of the writings of Marco Polo, Benjamin of Tudela, and Carpini,\r\nand his eager absorption of the fantastic tale of Antonio Leone, of\r\nMadeira; his ponderings on ocean mysteries, and his struggles with\r\npoverty; his audience of John of Portugal, and the treachery of that\r\nmonarch in attempting to anticipate his plans by secretly sending out a\r\nvessel, and the deserved defeat which followed; his sending his brother\r\nBartolomé with proposals to England; his stealing from Lisbon with his\r\nson Diego, lest he should be arrested for debt; his supposed application\r\nto Genoa; his interviews with the dukes of Medina Sidonia and Medina\r\nCeli, and the letter of the latter to Queen Isabella of Castile; his\r\nvisit to the court at Córdova, and the dark days attending it; the\r\nconference of learned men at Salamanca, and their unfavorable verdict;\r\nthe weary waitings on the preoccupied sovereigns at Málaga and Seville;\r\nthe succor given at La Rábida, and the worthy prior's intercession with\r\nthe queen; the humble dignity of the mariner at Granada amidst scenes\r\nof oriental splendor and general rejoicings, which only intensified his\r\ndiscontent; the lofty constancy in his demands when once a royal hearing\r\nwas obtained; the fresh disappointment after such long delay, and the\r\nproud bitterness of spirit with which he turned his back on Spain to\r\nseek in France a patron for his schemes; the final appeal of Santángel,\r\nwho afterward assisted in obtaining the money, and the conversion of\r\nIsabella, who now offered, if necessary, to pledge her jewels to meet\r\nthe charges of the voyage; the despatching of a royal courier after the\r\ndetermined fugitive, who returned in joy to receive the tardy aid—these\r\nincidents in the career of Columbus are a household story.\r\n\r\nAnd therein, thus far, we see displayed great persistency of purpose by\r\none possessed of a conception so stupendous as to overwhelm well-nigh\r\nthe strongest; by one not over-careful in money-matters, or morality;\r\nproud and sensitive whenever the pet project is touched, but affable\r\nenough otherwise, and not above begging upon necessity. It was a long\r\ntime to wait, eighteen years, when every day was one of alternate hope\r\nand despair; and they were not altogether worthless, those noiseless\r\nvoices from another world, which kept alive in him the inspiration that\r\noft-times now appeared as the broken tracery of a half-remembered dream.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TERMS OF AGREEMENT.]\r\n\r\nAn agreement was made by the sovereigns and the mariner, that to\r\nColumbus, his heirs and successors forever, should be secured the office\r\nof admiral, and the titles of viceroy and governor-general of all the\r\nlands and seas he should discover, with power to nominate candidates\r\nfrom whom the sovereigns might choose rulers for the realms discovered;\r\nthat one tenth of the net returns of gold, pearls, or other commodities\r\nbrought therefrom should be his; that in disputes arising from the new\r\ntraffic he, or his lieutenant, should be sole arbitrator within his\r\ndomain, the high admiral of Castile being judge within his district;\r\nand that by contributing one eighth of the cost of any enterprise to the\r\nregions found by him he should receive one eighth the profits. To these\r\ndignities and prerogatives was added the right of the discoverer, and\r\nof his heirs, to prefix to their names the title 'Don,' which should\r\nelevate them into respectability beside the grandees of Spain. This\r\nagreement was signed by Ferdinand as well as by Isabella, although the\r\ncrown of Castile alone assumed the risk, and alone was to receive the\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not a common spectacle in those days along the southern\r\nseaboard of Spain, that of science urging religion into its service.\r\nNevertheless, by royal order, reiterated by Peñalosa in person with\r\npronounced effect, the devil-fearers of Palos were forced to provide\r\nships and seamen for what they regarded as anything but an orthodox\r\nadventure. This they did with the greatest reluctance.\r\n\r\nEven under pressure of that civil and ecclesiastical system so\r\ncompletely interwoven in Spain that to disobey one was rebellion against\r\nboth, even in the face of king and priest, these mechanical sea-farers,\r\nwho halted not before tangible danger in any form, shrank from the\r\nawful uncertainty of a plunge into the mysteries of the dim, lowering,\r\nunintelligible west. Then came bravely forward the brothers Pinzon, and\r\nnot only assisted in providing two ships, so that Queen Isabella, after\r\nall, might wear her jewels while her deputy was scouring the high seas\r\nfor new dominions, but furnished Columbus with money to equip another\r\nvessel and to pay his eighth of the charge which should secure him\r\none eighth of the profits—a service never sufficiently remembered or\r\nrewarded by either Columbus, his masters, or successors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST VOYAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe expedition comprised one hundred and twenty men, in three small\r\nvessels, the _Santa María_, decked, and carrying the flag of the\r\nadmiral, and the _Pinta_ and _Niña_, open caravels, commanded by Martin\r\nAlonso Pinzon and Vicente Yañez Pinzon respectively. Among others were\r\nthe inspector-general of the armament, Rodrigo Sanchez; the chief\r\nalguacil, Diego de Arana; the royal notary, Rodrigo de Escobar; and\r\nfour pilots, Francisco Martin Pinzon, Sancho Ruiz, Pedro Alonso Niño,\r\nand Bartolomé Roldan. The commander-in-chief with his tall, enduring\r\nform bowed by an idea; his long, thin face, with its large, round eyes,\r\nhigh forehead, straight, pointed nose; features, in which tenacity\r\nand gloom struggled for the predominance, surrounded by thin locks and\r\ngray beard—was scarcely a personage either to inspire confidence or win\r\naffection. The squadron sailed from the port of Palos August 3, 1492.\r\n\r\nBut for the fact that it was the first, the voyage was quite\r\ncommonplace; the most serious occurrences being the breaking of a\r\nrudder, which obliged the expedition to put in at the Canaries for\r\nrepairs, and the variation of the needle, which caused a little fright\r\namong the pilots. The sea was tranquil, toward the last extremely so,\r\nand the wind generally favorable; yet no small trepidation attended this\r\ngradual loosening of hold upon the substantial world, and the drifting\r\ndaily farther and farther into the fathomless unknown. Hence it was with\r\nthe wildest joy that early in the morning of the 12th of October the cry\r\nof Land! was heard, and that soon afterward the venturesome navigators\r\nfelt beneath their feet the indubitable isle to which they gave the name\r\nSan Salvador, taking possession for Castile.\r\n\r\nNow the sovereigns had promised that he who first saw land should\r\nbe recompensed by a pension of ten thousand maravedís, equivalent to\r\nthirty-six dollars. It was at two o'clock in the morning that Rodrigo de\r\nTriana, a mariner on board the _Pinta_, gave the signal, the first that\r\nproved true after several had been mistakenly made; whereupon he claimed\r\nthe reward. But previously, during the night, Columbus had fancied he\r\ndescried a fitful light that should be on some shore. On the strength\r\nof this surmise he secured to himself the insignificant sum, which,\r\nto say nothing of its justness, was not a very magnanimous proceeding\r\nin so great a discoverer. We are told of Triana, that, burning under\r\na sense of wrong, after returning to Spain, he passed into Africa and\r\nturned Mahometan. However this may have been, dawn had shown them the\r\nisland, which seemed itself but dawn, to be dispelled by the full sun's\r\nrays when the night's dream had passed. Over the trackless waste of\r\nsea, suspended between earth and sky, the good ships had felt their\r\nway, until now, like goddesses, they sat at anchor on the other side of\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough this land was unlike the Zipangu of his dreams, Columbus was not\r\ndisposed to complain; but rather, midst tears and praises, to kiss the\r\nearth, be it of whatsoever quality, and smile benignantly upon the naked\r\nnatives that crept timidly forward, wondering whether the ships were\r\nmonsters of the deep, or bright beings dropped from heaven.\r\n\r\nOf a truth, it was a wonderful place, this India of Marco Polo that\r\nthe Genoese now sought. Intersected by rivers and canals, spanned by\r\nbridges under which the largest ships might sail, were fertile provinces\r\nfragrant with fruit and spices. Mangi alone boasted twelve thousand\r\ncities with gorgeous palaces, whose pillars and roofs were emblazoned\r\nin gold, and so situated as to be compassed within a few days' travel.\r\nThe cities and fortresses of Cathay were counted by tens of thousands,\r\nand their busy population by millions. On every side were gardens and\r\nluxurious groves; pleasure-boats and banqueting-barges floated on the\r\nlakes, and myriads of white sails swept over the bays. The mountains\r\nwere veined with silver, the river-beds paved with gold, and pearls\r\nwere as common as pebbles. Sheep were as large as oxen, and oxen were\r\nas large as elephants. Birds of brilliant plumage filled the enchanting\r\nair, and strange beasts of beauty and utility roamed the forests. The\r\ninhabitants were arrayed in silks and furs, and fed on luscious viands;\r\nthere were living springs that cured all diseases. The army of the great\r\nKhan, the happy ruler of all these glories, was in number as the grains\r\nof the sand which the sea surrounds; and as for vessels of war, and\r\nhorses, and elephants, there were a thousand times ten thousand. What a\r\ncontrast to such a creation was this low-lying strip of jungle-covered\r\nsand, peopled by copper-hued creatures dwelling in huts, and sustaining\r\nlife by the natural products of the unkempt earth! This, however, was\r\nbut an outlying island of Cathay; the main-land of Asia could not be far\r\ndistant; in any event, here was India, and these people were Indians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TWO INDIAS COMPARED.]\r\n\r\nThere was little enough, now appearing, in the India thus far found\r\nto enrich Spain. In their noses the natives displayed gold, always a\r\nroyal monopoly when discovered; and they brought cotton for barter,\r\non which the admiral immediately laid the same restriction. Being\r\ninformed, by signs, that the metal came from the south, after examining\r\nthe shore thereabout in boats, the Spaniards set sail on the 14th, took\r\npossession of Santa María de la Concepcion on the 15th, of Fernandina,\r\nnow Exuma, the day following, and afterward of Isabela, now Isla Larga,\r\nor Long Island; also of a group to which they gave the name Islas de\r\nArena. Soils and other substances, atmospheres and sunshines, were all\r\nfamiliar; plants and animals, though differing in degree and kind, were\r\nsimilar to those they had always been accustomed to see. One creation\r\nwas everywhere apparent; one nature; one rule. It was wonderful,\r\nstupendous! And if these human kind have souls, what a mighty work is\r\nhere to fit them for eternity!\r\n\r\nCrossing the Bahama Bank, they came on the 28th to Cuba, which Columbus\r\ncalled Juana, and which, with its dense uprolling green spangled with\r\nparrots, gay woodpeckers, and humming-birds, scarlet flamingoes and\r\nglittering insects; its trees of royal palm, cocoanut, cedar, mahogany,\r\nand shrubs of spicy fragrance; its unknown fruits and foods; its\r\ntransparent waters whose finny denizens flashed back the sunlight from\r\ntheir variegated scales, all under the brightest of skies, all breathed\r\nupon by softest airs, and lapped in serenest seas, was more like his\r\nown Zipangu, if, indeed, it was not Mangi itself.\r\n\r\nCoasting eastward, the _Pinta_ sailed away and left the other vessels,\r\nand it was with deep chagrin that Columbus saw no attention paid\r\nhis signals to return. Pinzon had heard of gold-fields in advance of\r\nhim, and he was going to reap them. The wreck of the _Santa María_\r\na month afterward, leaving the admiral only the little _Niña_, made\r\nhis situation all the more critical, and made him feel more keenly\r\nthan ever the desertion. Nor was this the first indication of mutiny\r\nand disruption among his people during the voyage. If the truth\r\nmust be told, the character of the man, though inured to the cruel\r\nhardihood of the age, seems here to be undergoing change; else it was\r\nnot originally as either he or his friends have estimated. The new\r\nand varied experiences amidst the new and varied phenomena attending\r\nthe idea and its consummation make it a matter of no wonder that his\r\nhead began to be a little turned. He had pondered painfully on what\r\nAristotle taught regarding the sphericity of the earth, on what Seneca\r\nsaid about sailing to the Indies westwardly, and on the terrestrial\r\nparadise placed by Dante at the antipodes of the holy city; and now he\r\nwas here among those happy regions of which so long ago philosophers\r\nhad spoken and poets sung. Under the inspiration of rare intelligence,\r\nand by wonderful courage and force of will, this Genoese sailor had\r\nbrought to his own terms the world's proudest sovereigns. Success,\r\nin his mind the most perfect, the most complete, was by this time\r\nproved beyond peradventure. At the outset he had suspected himself the\r\nspecial agent of the supernatural; now he was sure of it. It was meet,\r\ntherefore, that all men should fear and obey him. Impelled to activity,\r\nhe was impelled, if necessary, to severity. During the passage he had\r\ndeemed it expedient several times to mislead the sailors, who were\r\nconsequently backward about reposing in him the respect and confidence\r\ndue a commander. Suspicious of the Spanish sovereigns from the first,\r\nhis fears constantly increased as the magnitude of his discovery slowly\r\nunfolded before him, that he should eventually be robbed of it. He was\r\njealous lest any of those who had shared with him the perils of the\r\nadventure should secure to themselves some part of the honor or profit\r\nattending it. He had quarrelled with the Pinzons, who, having staked\r\ntheir money and lives on what was generally regarded a mad risk, thought\r\nsome consideration from the commander their due. The admiral's temper\r\nwas tamed somewhat by the very boldness of Pinzon's act; for when the\r\n_Pinta_ returned from her cruisings, little was then said about it; but\r\nif ever the opportunity should come, her commander must pay dearly for\r\nhis disobedience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAILING AMONG THE ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nCuba failed to display any opulent oriental city, but furnished tobacco\r\nand maize, gifts from savagism to civilization as comforting, perhaps,\r\nas any received in return. The mariners next discovered and coasted\r\nHayti, or Española, thus occupying the greater part of December. On the\r\nnorthern side of the island, out of the wrecked _Santa María_ and her\r\nbelongings, Columbus built and equipped a fortress, which he called La\r\nNavidad; and leaving there thirty-nine men under command of Diego de\r\nArana, with Pedro Gutierrez and Rodrigo de Escobedo, lieutenants, on\r\nthe 4th of January, 1493, he embarked for Spain. Those left behind were\r\nexpected by the ardent-minded admiral, during his absence, to obtain,\r\nin trade, a ton of gold, beside discovering mines and spices.\r\n\r\nViolent storms attended the homeward voyage; but on the 15th of March\r\nthe expedition reached Palos in safety, after touching at the Azores\r\nand the coast of Portugal. Then followed rejoicings. Over Spain, over\r\nEurope, the tidings flew: A New World to the westward! Bells rang and\r\nchoirs pealed hosannas. A New World for Spain; now were their Catholic\r\nMajesties well paid for their losses and trials in connection with\r\nMahometans and Jews!\r\n\r\nWith six natives, and divers birds and plants and other specimens from\r\nthe Islands, Columbus set out for Barcelona, then the residence of the\r\nSpanish sovereigns. Throughout the journey, the highway and houses were\r\nthronged with spectators eager for a glimpse of the strange spectacle.\r\nArrived at court, the great mariner was most graciously received,\r\nbeing permitted even to be seated in the presence of royalty. He\r\ntold his tale. It is said that all present wept. Columbus was as much\r\nexcited as any. In a delirium of joy he vowed within seven years to\r\nappoint an army of four thousand horse and fifty thousand foot for the\r\nrescue of Jerusalem, and to pay the cost out of his own pocket; but,\r\nunfortunately, he never found himself in funds sufficient to fulfil\r\nhis pious promise. The original compact between the sovereigns and the\r\ndiscoverer was confirmed, and to the latter was granted a family coat\r\nof arms. While Columbus was fêted by the nobles, and all the world\r\nresounded with his praises, Martin Alonso Pinzon lay a-dying; the reward\r\nfor his invaluable services, exceeding a hundred-fold all that Isabella\r\nand Ferdinand together had done, being loss of property, loss of health,\r\nthe insults of the admiral, the scorn of the queen, all now happily\r\ncrowned by speedy death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A HAPPY PEOPLE.]\r\n\r\nNever had nature made, within historic times, a paradise more perfect\r\nthan this Cuba and this Hayti that the Genoese had found. Never was a\r\nsylvan race more gentle, more hospitable than that which peopled this\r\nprimeval garden. Naked, because they needed not clothing; dwelling\r\nunder palm-leaves, such being sufficient protection; their sustenance\r\nthe spontaneous gifts of the ever generous land and sea; undisturbed\r\nby artificial curbings and corrections, and tormented by no ambitions,\r\ntheir life was a summer day, as blissful as mortals can know. It was as\r\nEden; without work they might enjoy all that earth could give. Disease\r\nand pain they scarcely knew; only death was terrible. In their social\r\nintercourse they were sympathizing, loving, and decorous, practising\r\nthe sublimest religious precepts without knowing it, and obeying Christ\r\nmore perfectly than many who profess to serve him. With strangers\r\nthe men were frank, cordial, honest; the women artless and compliant.\r\nKnowing no guile, they suspected none. Possessing all things, they gave\r\nfreely of that which cost them nothing. Having no laws, they broke none;\r\ncircumscribed by no conventional moralities, they were not immoral.\r\nIf charity be the highest virtue, and purity and peace the greatest\r\ngood, then were these savages far better and happier beings than any\r\ncivilization could boast. That they possessed any rights, any natural or\r\ninherent privileges in regard to their lands or their lives; that these\r\ninnocent and inoffensive people were not fit subjects for coercion,\r\ntreachery, robbery, enslavement, and slaughter, was a matter which\r\nseems never to have been questioned at that time by either discoverer,\r\nadventurer, or ruler. However invalid in any of the Spanish courts might\r\nhave been the argument of a house-breaker, that in the room he entered\r\nhe discovered a purse of gold, and took it, Spaniards never thought of\r\napplying such logic to themselves in regard to the possessions of the\r\nnatives in the new lands their Genoese had found.\r\n\r\nWhat Spain required now was a title such as the neighboring nations of\r\nEurope should recognize as valid. So far as the doctrine was concerned,\r\nof appropriating to themselves the possessions of others, they were\r\nall equally sound in it. Europe with her steel and saltpetre and\r\nmagnetic needle was stronger than naked barbarians, whose possessions\r\nwere thereupon seized as fast as found. The right to such robbery has\r\nbeen held sacred since the earliest records of the human race; and it\r\nwas by this time legalized by the civilized nations. Savagism had no\r\nrights which civilization was bound to respect. The world belonged not\r\nto Christian or Mahometan, but to whatever idea, principle, or power\r\ncould take it. In none of their pretended principles, in none of their\r\ncodes of honor or ethics, was there any other ultimate appeal than brute\r\nforce; their deity they made to fit the occasion, whatever that might\r\nbe. This they did not know, however. They thought themselves patterns\r\nof justice and fair morality; and all that troubled them was in what\r\nattitude they would stand toward each other with regard to their several\r\ndiscoveries and conquests. But while such was the recognized condition\r\nof affairs at the beginning of the sixteenth century among the reckless\r\nadventurers of Spain, such were not the teachings of the Church, nor\r\nthe views of the intelligent and right thinking men of the time. True,\r\nthe army of fortune-seekers who first rushed to the new world in search\r\nof gold came for lust and plunder, but with them, and inspired with\r\nvery different motives, came the missionaries of the cross, pointing\r\nthe savages to civilization and a purer religion than their own. But\r\ncivilization and religion, it must be confessed, had little to recommend\r\nthem in the examples of unprincipled men who were ever present to give\r\nthe lie to the teachings of the priests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE WORLD PARTITIONED BY THE POPE.]\r\n\r\nThus it was that the Spanish sovereigns, being Christian, applied\r\nfor a confirmation of title to Alexander VI., then sovereign pontiff\r\nof Christendom, at the same time insinuating, in a somewhat worldly\r\nfashion, that learned men regarded the rights of their Catholic\r\nMajesties secure enough even without such confirmation. No valid\r\nobjections before the holy tribunal could be raised against Christian\r\nprinces powerful enough to sustain their pretensions to ownership while\r\npropagating the true faith in heathen lands; but Pope Eugene IV. and\r\nhis successors had already granted Portugal all lands discovered by\r\nPortuguese from Cape Bojador to the Indies. In order, therefore, to\r\navoid conflict, the bull issued the 2d of May, 1493, ceding Spain the\r\nsame rights respecting discoveries already granted Portugal, was on the\r\nday following defined to this effect:—An imaginary line of demarcation\r\nshould be drawn from pole to pole, one hundred leagues west of the\r\nAzores and Cape Verde Islands; all lands discovered east of that line\r\nshould be Portugal's, while west of that line all should belong to\r\nSpain. Thus by a very mortal breath and the flourish of a pen, the\r\nunknown world, with all its multitudes of interests and inhabitants,\r\nwas divided between these two sovereignties, occupying the peninsula of\r\nsouth-western Europe; though in their wisdom they forgot that if the\r\nworld was round, Portugal in going east and Spain in going west must\r\nsomewhere meet, and might yet quarrel on the other side. Subsequently,\r\nthat is to say on the 7th of June, 1494, by treaty between Spain and\r\nPortugal the papal line of partition was removed, making it three\r\nhundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, Portugal\r\nhaving complained of want of sea-room for southern enterprise. This\r\nremoval ultimately gave the Portuguese Brazil. And ecclesiastics claim\r\nthat care was ever exercised by the Spanish crown to comply with the\r\nobligations thus laid upon it by this holy sanction.\r\n\r\nAppointed to take charge of the affairs of the New World was Juan\r\nRodriguez de Fonseca, arch-deacon of Seville, and afterward patriarch\r\nof the Indies. Although high in ecclesiastical preferment, he was a\r\nbustling man of business, and ably filled the office during a period\r\nof some thirty years. Of unflinching devotion to his sovereign, sedate,\r\nstern in the accomplishment of his duty, and obliged as he was, in the\r\ninterests of the crown, to exercise occasional restraint on the rashness\r\nor presumption of the conquerors, he incurred their enmity and was\r\nreviled by their biographers. That he was retained so long in office by\r\nsuch able monarchs as Ferdinand and Charles goes far to prove invalid\r\nthe charges of misrule and villainy so liberally made against him.\r\nAssociated with Fonseca was Francisco Pinelo, as treasurer, and Juan de\r\nSoria as _contador_, or auditor. Their chief office was at Seville, with\r\na custom-house at Cádiz belonging to the same department. This was the\r\ngerm of the famous _Casa de Contratacion de las Indias_, or India House\r\nof Trade, so long dominant in the government of the New World.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SECOND VOYAGE.]\r\n\r\nThus all went swimmingly. Columbus found no difficulty in fitting out\r\na fleet for a second venture, a royal order being issued that all\r\ncaptains, with their ships and crews, in all the Andalusian ports,\r\nshould hold themselves in readiness for that purpose. Seventeen vessels\r\nsailed from Cádiz the 25th of September, 1493, having on board twelve\r\nhundred persons,—miners, mechanics, agriculturists, and gentlemen,—with\r\nhorses, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, and fowls; the seeds of vegetables,\r\nof orchard fruits, of oranges, lemons, and grain for planting;\r\ntogether with provisions, medicines, implements, goods for trade, arms,\r\nammunition, and all the requirements for founding a colony. Among the\r\npassengers were Diego Colon, the admiral's brother, Bernal Diaz de Pisa,\r\ncontador, Fermin Cedo, assayer, and Alonso de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa,\r\nsubsequently famous in New World discoveries; also twelve priests,\r\nchief among whom was Bernardo Buil, a Benedictine monk, sent by the\r\npope as his apostolic vicar, with all the ornaments and vestments for\r\nfull service, which always had a wonderful effect upon the natives. The\r\nwork of conversion had already been begun by baptizing in solemn state\r\nthe six savages brought over by Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella with\r\nPrince Juan standing sponsors. The 3d of November the expedition reached\r\nDominica, so named from the day of arrival, Sunday. Next was discovered\r\nan island to which Columbus gave the name of his ship, _Marigalante_;\r\nthen Guadalupe, where were tamed geese, and pine-apples, also human\r\nbones, significant of the presence of the horror-breeding Caribs,\r\nor cannibals. Thus cruising among these Caribbee Islands, and naming\r\nthem one after another, Columbus continued his way and finally came to\r\nNavidad, only to find the fortress in ruins, its former occupants having\r\nfallen victims to their own follies.\r\n\r\nChoosing a site a little to the east of Navidad, still on the north\r\nside of Hayti, the Spaniards landed their effects, and laid out a city,\r\nwhich they called Isabela, surrounding it with ramparts. As soon as the\r\nvessels could be laden with gold, they were to be sent back to Spain;\r\nbut the death of the Spaniards left at Navidad had somewhat marred\r\noriginal plans.\r\n\r\nWhile Columbus lay ill, directing affairs as best he might, early in\r\nJanuary, 1494, two parties under Ojeda and Gorvalan reconnoitred the\r\nisland, each in a different direction, and returning, reported gold.\r\nAs it was inconvenient to their anchorage, and as many of the colonists\r\nwere prostrate with disease, it was deemed best to let the ships go back\r\nempty rather than detain them longer; hence, on the 2d of February,\r\ntwelve of the largest craft put to sea under command of Antonio de\r\nTorres, having on board further specimens of the people and products\r\nof the country. By this departure was sent a request for immediate\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nMurmurs now arose against Columbus, the sick and disappointed ones\r\ncomplaining most loudly that he had deceived them, had lured them\r\nthither with false hopes to die. And they begged Diaz de Pisa, already\r\nat the head of a faction, and Cedo, who said there was not gold in those\r\nisles in paying quantities, to seize the remaining ships and sail with\r\nthem for Spain. But the admiral hearing of it, arrested Diaz, and held\r\nhim in irons on board one of the vessels to await trial in Spain.\r\n\r\nRecovered from illness, Columbus left his brother Diego in command at\r\nIsabela, and set out, at the head of four hundred men, for the golden\r\nmountains of Cibao, in the interior of the island, intending there to\r\nbuild a fortress, and to work the mines on an extensive scale. Arrived\r\nat a favorable locality, where gold seemed plentiful in the brooks, the\r\nSpaniards threw up a strong wooden fort, which they called Santo Tomás,\r\na piece of pleasantry aimed at the doubting assayer, Cedo. Leaving\r\nin command Pedro Margarite, Columbus returned to Isabela. Afterward a\r\nsmaller post was built, called Magdalena, and the command was given to\r\nLuis de Arriaga.\r\n\r\nThe natives could not welcome so large an invasion, which they now\r\nclearly saw would bring upon them serious results. Thereupon they\r\nwithdrew from the vicinity of Santo Tomás, refusing all intercourse with\r\nits inmates; and as a Spanish hidalgo could by no means work, even at\r\ngold-gathering, success in that direction was not marked. Provisions\r\nand medicine then began to fail, and fresh discontent arose, even Father\r\nBuil arraying himself in opposition to the admiral.\r\n\r\nAs much to keep his people occupied as through any expectation of\r\nprofit, Columbus sent another expedition into the interior of Hayti, and\r\nhimself crossed to the south side of Cuba in three caravels, intending\r\nthence to reach Cathay. Soon he discovered to the southward a lofty\r\nisle, which he called at first Santa Gloria, then Santiago, but which\r\nfinally retained its native name, Jamaica, that is to say, Island of\r\nSprings. After reaching nearly the western end of Cuba, thinking it\r\nstill the continent of Asia, and that possibly he might by that way\r\nreach Spain, in which event he could then see what was beyond, he\r\ncoasted the south sides of Jamaica and Hayti, and returned to Isabela,\r\nwhere he arrived insensible from excitement and fatigue. When he awoke\r\nto bodily suffering, which for a time had been drowned in delirious\r\nenergy, there, to his great joy, he found his brother Bartolomé, who\r\nhad come from Spain with three well-laden ships to his assistance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLONIZATION A FAILURE.]\r\n\r\nGreat events generally choose great men for their accomplishment, though\r\nnot unfrequently we see no small dust raised by an insignificant agent.\r\nAs a mariner and discoverer, Columbus had no superior; as colonist and\r\ngovernor, he had by this time proved himself a failure. There are some\r\nthings great men cannot do as well as their inferiors. It was one thing\r\nto rule at sea, and quite another to rule on shore. In bringing to his\r\nIndia these unruly Spaniards, he had sown for himself the whirlwind.\r\nHad he been more judicious in the selection of his followers, his\r\nlater days would have been more successful as well as more peaceful.\r\nDiscovery was his infatuation; he was never for a moment unattended by\r\na consuming curiosity to find a western way to civilized India. Had he\r\nbeen possessed of sound practical judgment in the matter, of the same\r\nknowledge of himself and of political affairs that he had of navigation,\r\nhe would have seen that he could not, at the same time, gratify his\r\npassion for discovery and successfully govern colonies. In his fatal\r\ndesire to assume rulership, and upon the ill-understood reports of\r\nsimple savages, with no knowledge of the resources or capabilities of\r\nthe country, without definite purpose or mature plans, he had brought\r\nupon himself an avalanche of woes. Beside his incapacity for such a\r\ntask, his position was rendered all the more trying by the fact that he\r\nwas a foreigner, whose arbitrary acts galled his impatient subordinates,\r\nand finally wrought them to the pitch of open rebellion. The Spaniards\r\nwere quick enough to perceive that this Genoese sailor was in no wise\r\nfitted to lay the foundation of a prosperous Spanish colony; and when\r\nduring his absence he left in command his brother, to whom attached no\r\nprestige of high achievement to make up for his misfortune in not being\r\nborn in Spain, complications grew daily worse. Even the ecclesiastics\r\nwere against the admiral; for with a foresight born of a deep study of\r\nhuman nature they saw that between the fires of the real and the unreal\r\nthis man was becoming mad. They saw the religious hypochondria, which\r\nhad already inflamed his intellect, now aggravated by the anxieties\r\nincident to the government of a turbulent element under circumstances\r\nunprecedented, undermining his health, and bringing rapidly upon him\r\nthose mental and physical distempers which rendered the remainder of\r\nhis life prolonged misery. Thus we may plainly see how Columbus brought\r\nupon himself the series of calamities which are commonly found charged\r\nto unscrupulous sovereigns and villainous rivals.\r\n\r\nAnd thickly enough misfortunes were laid upon him on his return to\r\nIsabela. Margarite, who had been ordered to explore the island, leaving\r\nOjeda in command at Santo Tomás, had abandoned himself to licentious\r\nidleness, followed by outrages upon the natives, which notwithstanding\r\ntheir pacific disposition had driven them to retaliation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREATMENT OF THE NATIVES.]\r\n\r\nAnd here was the beginning of these four centuries of such rank\r\ninjustice, such horrible atrocities inflicted by the hand of the\r\nstronger upon the weaker, of the civilized upon the savage, that should\r\nmake a man blush to own kinship to a race so defiled before its maker\r\nin whose image it was created.\r\n\r\nIt is the self-same story, old and new, from Española to Darien and\r\nMexico, from Brazil to Labrador, and from Patagonia to Alaska, by sailor\r\nand cavalier, Spaniard and Englishman, by gold-hunter and fur-hunter—the\r\nunenlightened red man welcoming with wonder his destroyer, upon whom\r\nhe is soon forced to turn to save himself, his wife, his children, but\r\nonly at last to fall by the merciless arm of development beneath the\r\npitiable destiny of man primeval.\r\n\r\nThrowing off all pretence of allegiance to Columbus, when satiated\r\nwith his excesses, Margarite, with a mutinous crew at his heels and\r\naccompanied by Father Buil, had taken such ships as best suited them\r\nand had departed for Spain. Two _caciques_, or native chieftains,\r\nGuatiguana, and Caonabo the Carib, with their followers had arisen in\r\narms, had killed some of the Spaniards, had besieged Magdalena and Santo\r\nTomás, and had even cast an ominous eye on Isabela. Such were the chief\r\noccurrences at the settlement during the absence of the admiral.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Columbus made his brother Bartolomé _adelantado_, that is\r\nto say, leader of an enterprise, or governor of a frontier province.\r\nThen he sent relief to the fortress of Magdalena, and established\r\nanother military post near where was subsequently Santiago, which he\r\ncalled Concepcion. Later the chain was continued by building other\r\nposts; one near the Rio Yaquí, called Santa Catalina, and one on the\r\nriver Yaquí, called Esperanza. Meanwhile Ojeda offered to take the\r\nredoubtable Carib, Caonabo, by stratagem; which was accomplished,\r\nwhile he was surrounded by a multitude of warriors, by first winning\r\nthe admiration and confidence of the cacique, and then on the plea of\r\npersonal ornamentation and display obtaining his consent to wear some\r\nbeautiful bright manacles, and sit bound behind Ojeda on his steed; in\r\nwhich plight he was safely brought by the dashing cavalier at the head\r\nof his horsemen into Isabela.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Antonio de Torres arrived with four ships from Spain,\r\nand was sent back with the gold which had been collected, and five\r\nhundred Indians to be sold as slaves. By this departure went Diego Colon\r\nto refute the charges of incompetency and maladministration now being\r\npreferred against his brother at court.\r\n\r\nThough suffering from a fresh attack of fever, on the 27th of March,\r\n1495, accompanied by the adelantado and all his available forces,\r\nColumbus set out from Isabela to subjugate the caciques of the island,\r\nwho had combined to extirpate the Spaniards. Charging the naked red\r\nmen amidst the noise of drum, trumpet, and halloo, with horse and\r\nbloodhound, lance, sabre, and firelock, a peace was soon conquered.\r\nMultitudes of the inhabitants were butchered, and upon the rest\r\nwas imposed such cruel tribute that they gradually sank beneath the\r\nservitude. But when the white men thus had the domain to themselves,\r\nthey did not know what to do with it. It was not for them to till the\r\nsoil, or labor in the mines; hence famine threatened, and they were\r\nfinally reduced to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nThere is little wonder, under the circumstances, that orders were issued\r\nin Spain to depose Columbus, first by the appointment of a commission\r\nof inquiry, and finally by removal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT OF THE INDIES.]\r\n\r\nThus far the government of the Indies, as the New World began to be\r\ncalled, had been administered solely by the admiral, according to\r\nagreement, with Fonseca as superintendent in Spain. None but they were\r\npermitted to freight or despatch any vessel to the New World. Columbus\r\nwas authorized to appoint two subordinate officers subject to royal\r\nsanction; and yet the sovereigns took offense when he named Bartolomé\r\nadelantado, which office was not that of lieutenant-governor, as many\r\nwriters aver, but nearer that of territorial governor, with political\r\nas well as military powers, usually appointed by and subject only to\r\nthe king. Assuming a certain degree of state, the admiral appeared at\r\nIsabela richly dressed, with ten _escuderos de á pié_, or squires of\r\nfoot, and twenty _familiares_, composing his civil and military family.\r\nHe had been directed before leaving Spain to appoint in each of the\r\nseveral settlements or colonies which should be planted an _alcalde_,\r\nor justice, exercising the combined duties of mayor and judge, with\r\njurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, appeal being to the admiral;\r\nalso an _alguacil mayor_, or high sheriff; and, if necessary, an\r\n_ayuntamiento_, or town council. All edicts, orders, and commissions\r\nmust be issued in the name of the sovereigns, countersigned by the\r\nnotary, with the royal seal affixed. The admiral had been further\r\ndirected to build a warehouse where the royal stores should be kept,\r\nand all traffic should be subject to his direction. When he sailed upon\r\nhis Cuban expedition he left for the direction of the colony a junta,\r\nof which his brother Diego was president, and Alonso Sanchez Carvajal,\r\nJuan de Luxan, Pedro Fernandez Coronel, and Father Buil, councillors.\r\n\r\nDiego Colon was a well-meaning man, gentle and discreet, approaching in\r\nvisage and dress nearer the priest than the cavalier; he was neither\r\nshrewd nor energetic. Bartolomé was quite the opposite, and in many\r\nrespects was the ablest of the brothers. Powerful in mind and body,\r\nauthoritative and determinate in demeanor, generous in disposition,\r\nfearless in spirit, a thorough seaman, a man of no narrow worldly\r\nexperience, fairly educated, and talented with the pen, he was neither\r\nthe amiable, inefficient Diego, nor the dreamy, enthusiastic admiral.\r\n\r\nQuick to notice in their deputy any indication of misrule, or undue\r\nassumption of authority, their Majesties did not fail to lend an\r\nattentive ear to the charges preferred against him. Yet the record\r\ndoes not show from first to last that either Isabella or Ferdinand\r\never really desired or intended to do Columbus injustice or injury.\r\nWhen Torres returned from Spain, after the first accusation had\r\nbeen made, the sovereigns, besides a letter expressing the warmest\r\nconfidence in the discoverer, and high consideration for the affairs\r\nof the colony, sent a special _real provision_ ordering all to obey\r\nthe admiral as themselves, under penalty of ten thousand maravedís for\r\nevery offence. When further accusations came, instead of divesting him\r\nof his authority, they sent as commissioner of inquiry Juan Aguado,\r\na warm friend of the admiral. Often they checked Fonseca's too harsh\r\nmeasures with regard to Columbus and his brothers, and interposed their\r\nroyal protection from such officers as acted too severely under the\r\nexasperating folly of the admiral. To satisfy the discoverer would have\r\nbeen impossible for any patron, so wild were his desires, so chimerical\r\nhis plans, so injudicious his acts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAguado arrived at Isabela in October. He brought four caravels laden\r\nwith supplies, and Diego Colon, passenger. Soon it was noised abroad\r\nthat the conduct of the admiral was to be questioned, whereat both white\r\nmen and red rejoiced. Aguado could but see the pitiable state of things\r\nupon the island, idleness, poverty, excesses, and disobedience among the\r\ncolonists, folly and mismanagement among the rulers, and seeing, could\r\nbut report accordingly; for which, and for no other reasons that I am\r\nable to discover, the biographers of Columbus heap upon the commissioner\r\nopprobrious epithets.\r\n\r\nWhen Aguado returned to Spain, Columbus accompanied him to make such\r\nexcuses before the sovereigns as best he might. They embarked from\r\nIsabela March 10, 1496, leaving the adelantado in command, and carrying\r\nwith them two hundred and twenty-five disaffected colonists, and a\r\nnumber of Indian captives, among whom was the proud and once powerful\r\nchieftain, Caonabo, so treacherously taken by Ojeda. Contrary winds and\r\nstarvation attended them, Caonabo dying during the voyage. Arrived at\r\nCádiz in June, the admiral found Pedro Alonso Niño about to sail with\r\nthree caravels for Hayti. Niño carried out more priests, and brought\r\nback more slaves.\r\n\r\nColumbus appeared in Spain in a Franciscan garb and with dejected\r\ndemeanor. To all the world, except to himself, it was by this time\r\nevident that his gorgeous India was a myth, and settlement on the\r\nsupposition of its existence a mistake. He seemed now dazed by reverses,\r\nas formerly he had been dazed by successes. Nevertheless, he continued\r\nto make as much as possible of his discoveries, parading a brother of\r\nCaonabo in a broad gold collar with a massive gold chain attached.\r\n\r\nStill the sovereigns were gracious. They scarcely alluded to the\r\ncomplaints and ever-increasing charges against the admiral, but\r\nconfirmed anew his dignities, enlarged his perquisites, and showed\r\nhim every kindness. The title of adelantado was formally vested by\r\nthem in Bartolomé. When asked for more ships and money, they readily\r\ngranted both; moreover, they offered the admiral a tract of land in\r\nHayti, twenty-five by fifty leagues, which, however, he declined; they\r\noffered him sixty sailors, a hundred and forty soldiers, one hundred\r\nminers, mechanics, and farmers, and thirty women, the services of all\r\nto be paid by the crown. But because there was some delay, occasioned\r\nby the operations in Italy and the armada for Flanders, the biographers\r\nof the admiral again break out in abuse of the sovereigns and their\r\nservants. The truth is, Ferdinand and Isabella stood by the Genoese\r\nmuch longer than did their subjects. For example, when certain millions\r\nof maravedís, equivalent to over a hundred thousand dollars to-day,\r\nhad been appropriated, and eight vessels equipped, so unpopular had\r\nthe admiral and his enterprises become, that it was found necessary to\r\npress sailors into the service, and empty the prisons for colonists.\r\nAnd it was only when their admiral, viceroy, and governor of the Indies\r\nso far forgot himself, when on the point of sailing, as publicly, and\r\nwith his own hand and foot, to strike down and kick Jimeno de Berviesca,\r\nan official under Fonseca, that the sovereigns began to realize the\r\nunfitness of Columbus for the management of colonies. It was a serious\r\noffense to attack a public servant; and when this was done under the\r\nvery eyes of royalty, and by the man they had so delighted to honor, the\r\ntruth came home to them, and they never afterward regarded the Genoese\r\nwith the same degree of favor. Yet for his great merits, his genius,\r\nenthusiasm, and perseverance, and for the glory unparalleled conferred\r\nby him on Spain, they would ever be to him just and generous. He could\r\nnever become again the pauper pilot, as he had been called at Granada\r\nwhile begging help for his first voyage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THIRD VOYAGE.]\r\n\r\nTwo vessels were despatched to the colony under Pedro Fernandez Coronel\r\nearly in 1498. On the 30th of May Columbus embarked from San Lúcar\r\nwith six vessels, arrived at the northern seaboard of South America,\r\nand discovered there the isle of Trinidad the 31st of July, sailed\r\nthrough the gulf of Paria, where gold and pearls were seen in profusion,\r\ndiscovered the Margarita Islands, and came to Hayti, arriving off the\r\nriver Ozema, on the southern side of the island, the 30th of August.\r\n\r\nPrior to the last departure of the admiral for Spain, gold had been\r\ndiscovered in this vicinity, and during his absence a military post,\r\ncalled San Cristóbal, had been planted there, and at the adjacent\r\nharbor a fort built, which was named Santo Domingo, and which was from\r\nthis time the capital of the Indies. At intervals during the past two\r\nyears, the adelantado at the head of his marauders had scoured the\r\nisland, collecting the quarterly tribute, and making observation on such\r\nmeasures as he thought might increase the same. Insurrections had been\r\noccasionally organized by the caciques, but were usually stifled by the\r\nprompt and politic action of the adelantado. Many of the colonists had\r\ngradually relaxed in their loyalty to Columbus, until finally, at the\r\ninstigation of Francisco Roldan, they declared their independence of the\r\nadelantado, though still acknowledging fealty to Spain. After creating\r\nno small disturbance about Concepcion and Isabela, Roldan had retired\r\nwith his band to the province of Jaraguá.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AFFAIRS AT SANTO DOMINGO.]\r\n\r\nOn landing at Santo Domingo, the admiral first proclaimed his approval\r\nof the adelantado's measures, and then set about to pacify the\r\ncolonists. With the common people, many officers of trust had joined the\r\nrevolt of Roldan. Columbus offered amnesty to all, which was at first\r\nrefused, and letters from both sides were sent to Spain. But at length\r\nthere was reconciliation; Roldan became a partisan of Columbus, and\r\nassisted in subduing other hostile factions, which resulted in flinging\r\nAdrian de Moxica off the battlements of Fort Concepcion.\r\n\r\nThe distracted state of the colony, the continued charges against\r\nColumbus, and the inadequate returns from large outlays, impelled\r\nthe sovereigns to send out another commission with power to punish\r\noffenders, civil and criminal, and, if necessary, to supersede the\r\nadmiral in the government. The commissioner chosen for this purpose was\r\nFrancisco de Bobadilla, an arrogant, shallow-minded man, who delighted\r\nrather in degrading merit than in exercising justice. He was authorized\r\nby letters patent to acquaint himself concerning the truth of the\r\nrebellion against the admiral; what robberies, cruelties, or other\r\novert acts had been committed; he was directed to seize the person and\r\nsequestrate the property of any offender, or punish in any way he might\r\ndeem best. A provisional letter was addressed by the sovereigns to the\r\nadmiral of the ocean sea, ordering him to surrender to the commissioner\r\nall forts, arms, ships, houses, cattle, or other public property, which\r\nletter was to be used only if necessary. Bobadilla, accompanied by a\r\nbody-guard of twenty-five men, sailed with two caravels in July, 1500,\r\nand arrived at Santo Domingo on the 23d of August. By this opportunity\r\nsome of the Indians sent over by Columbus as slaves were returned in\r\ncharge of six friars. It is doubtful whether the enslavement of the red\r\nman could ever have been made profitable, but whether it could or not,\r\nthe Catholic Church is entitled to much credit for thus promptly setting\r\nits foot upon the diabolical traffic which had already received the\r\napproval of some of the first jurists of the day. Indeed the doctrine\r\nthat the Indians were not endowed with souls was rapidly spreading,\r\nand had found many believers, and had not the pope fortunately at this\r\njuncture decided against the proposition, the subject of Indian slavery\r\nwould not have been so easily or so quickly settled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNWARRANTED CONDUCT OF BOBADILLA.]\r\n\r\nAmong the first objects to meet the eye of Bobadilla, on landing, were\r\nthe bodies of two Spaniards swinging from gibbets, which argued not very\r\nfavorably for the quietude of the island. Columbus was absent at Fort\r\nConcepcion; the adelantado and Roldan were pursuing rebels in Jaraguá;\r\nDiego Colon, who was in charge at Santo Domingo, was peremptorily\r\ncommanded to surrender certain prisoners, which he refused to do until\r\nthe admiral, whose commission was higher than that of Bobadilla, and\r\nunder whom he served, should order it.\r\n\r\nThereupon Bobadilla broke open the jail, and the prisoners were finally\r\nset at liberty. He not only assumed the custody of the crown property,\r\nbut he entered the house of Columbus, took possession of his effects,\r\nand made his residence there. He sided with the late insurgents, giving\r\near only to them. Next he ordered to appear before him the admiral,\r\nwho came with all quietness, and was immediately ironed and cast into\r\nprison. The brothers of Columbus met the same fate. It was a most\r\nvillainous proceeding on the part of Bobadilla, wholly unauthorized,\r\nwholly unnecessary. Columbus was condemned before he was tried. While in\r\nthe act of coming forward of his own accord, not with hostile front, but\r\nunattended, he was seized, manacled, and incarcerated. It was not until\r\nafterward that he was charged with inflicting on the colonists, even on\r\nhidalgos, oppressive labor, abuse, and cruel punishments; with failing\r\nto provide them sufficient food; with opposing royal authority; with\r\nsecreting gold and pearls; and with unjust treatment of the natives,\r\nmaking unnecessary war upon them, levying iniquitous tribute, preventing\r\ntheir conversion, and sending them as slaves to Spain. Some went so far\r\nas to hint at an intended transfer of allegiance to some other power.\r\nBut were all the calumnies true, twice told, which vile, revengeful men\r\nhad heaped upon him, he would not have merited the treatment that he now\r\nreceived at the hand of their Majesties' agent. Ever loyal, high-minded,\r\nand sincere, ever performing his duties to the best of his ability,\r\nthe worst that can be truthfully said of him is that he was unfitted\r\nby temperament and training, unfitted by his genius, by those very\r\nqualities which made him so superior to other men in other directions,\r\nfor organizing in a tropical wilderness that social thrift upon which\r\nmight be built a staid community out of the ignorant, presumptuous, and\r\ndesperate element fresh from conflicts with Jews and Moors.\r\n\r\nAfter having been subjected to much insult and indignity, the three\r\nbrothers were placed on shipboard and sent to Spain. Andrés Martin,\r\nmaster of the caravel, offered to remove the manacles, but the admiral\r\nsaid no. It was by the king's agent the irons were put on; it must be\r\nby the king's order if ever they are taken off. \"And I will always keep\r\nthese chains,\" he added with proud bitterness, \"as memorials of reward\r\nfor faithful services.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Ferdinand and Isabella and all the people were shocked to see the\r\nillustrious discoverer in such a plight. Immediately the sovereigns\r\nheard of it the chains were stricken off, and the prisoners released.\r\nFrom the odious abasement into which he had been unjustly thrust by an\r\ninfamous agent, Columbus was once more lifted high into favor by the\r\nsovereigns, whose moist eyes testified their hearts' sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF DARIEN.\r\n\r\n     RODRIGO DE BASTIDAS—EXTENSION OF NEW WORLD PRIVILEGES—THE\r\n     ROYAL SHARE—JUAN DE LA COSA—SHIPS OF THE EARLY\r\n     DISCOVERERS—COASTING DARIEN—THE TERRIBLE TEREDO—WRECKED\r\n     ON ESPAÑOLA—SPANISH MONEY—TREATMENT OF BASTIDAS BY\r\n     OVANDO—ACCUSED, AND SENT TO SPAIN FOR TRIAL—HE IS IMMEDIATELY\r\n     ACQUITTED—FUTURE CAREER AND CHARACTER OF BASTIDAS—THE ARCHIVES\r\n     OF THE INDIES—THE SEVERAL COLLECTIONS OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS\r\n     IN SPAIN—THE LABORS OF MUÑOZ AND NAVARRETE—BIBLIOGRAPHICAL\r\n     NOTICES OF THE PRINTED COLLECTIONS OF NAVARRETE,\r\n     TERNAUX-COMPANS, SALVÁ AND BARANDA, AND PACHECO AND CÁRDENAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Spaniard to touch the territory which for the purposes of my\r\nwork I have taken the liberty to denominate the Pacific States of North\r\nAmerica was Rodrigo de Bastidas, a notary of Triana, the gypsy suburb\r\nof Seville.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NEW WORLD OPENED TO SETTLEMENT.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the discoveries of Columbus had been made for Castile, and\r\nCastilians regarded their rights to the new lands superior to those\r\nof any others, even other inhabitants of Spain; and although at first\r\nnone might visit the New World save those authorized by Columbus or\r\nFonseca; yet, owing to inadequate returns from heavy expenditures, and\r\nthe inability of the admiral properly to control colonization in the\r\nseveral parts of the ever-widening area, at the solicitation of several\r\npersons desirous of entering the new field of commerce and adventure at\r\ntheir own charge, on the 10th of April, 1495, the sovereigns issued a\r\nproclamation granting native-born subjects of Spain permission to settle\r\nin Hayti, or Española,[III-1] as I shall continue to call the island,\r\nand to make to other parts private voyages of discovery and trade, under\r\nroyal license. The regulations were that the vessels so sailing should\r\nbe equipped under royal inspection, that they should depart only from\r\nthe port of Cádiz, and that they should carry one or two crown officers.\r\nThe sovereigns retained, without payment, one tenth of the tonnage, and\r\nwere to receive one tenth of the gross returns. Settlers on Española\r\nwere to receive grants of land, and one year's provision; of the gold\r\nthey gathered they were to pay two thirds to the crown; on all other\r\nproducts one tenth. Although this step was taken without consulting\r\nColumbus, it was the aim of the sovereigns fully to respect his rights\r\nin the matter; therefore, and in lieu of his property in one eighth of\r\nall the tonnage, for every seven vessels thus privately adventured he\r\nwas privileged to despatch one on his own account. The admiral still\r\ncomplaining, such parts of the proclamation as in any wise interfered\r\nwith his rights were revoked, and his former privileges confirmed, the\r\n2d of June, 1497.[III-2]\r\n\r\nAmong those to take advantage of this permission, beside Bastidas, was\r\nAlonso de Ojeda, who embarked with four vessels from Spain in May, 1499,\r\nin company with Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo Vespucci, sailed along the\r\nseaboard of South America from Paria and the Pearl Coast, discovered by\r\nColumbus, to the gulf of Venezuela, so called because like Venice the\r\nnative villages were built over the water. At Cape de la Vela, Ojeda\r\nleft the coast and crossed to Española, whence he was driven off by\r\nRoldan at the command of Columbus. He reached Spain in June, 1500; and\r\nthough his ships were crowded with slaves, after paying expenses there\r\nwere left but five hundred ducats to divide among fifty-five persons.\r\nSailing in a caravel of only fifty tons, a few days later than Ojeda,\r\nwere Pedro Alonso Niño and Cristóbal Guerra, who, following the track\r\nof Columbus and Ojeda to the Pearl Coast, thence crossed to Margarita,\r\nreturned to the main-land and coasted Cumaná, and finally returned to\r\nSpain, arriving about two months before Ojeda, well laden with gold and\r\npearls. This was the first really profitable voyage, pecuniarily, to\r\nthe New World. Then there was Vicente Yañez Pinzon, who sailed in four\r\ncaravels in December, 1499, and shortly after Diego de Lepe, in two\r\nvessels, both going to Brazil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOYAGE OF BASTIDAS.]\r\n\r\nQuite exceptional to the ordinary adventurer was Bastidas. He was a man\r\nof standing in the community, possessed of some means himself and having\r\nwealthy friends; he was intelligent and influential, and withal humane,\r\neven Las Casas admitting that no one ever accused him of illtreating\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the honest notary, among them Juan de Ledesma, were\r\nready enough to join him, pecuniarily, in a venture to the famous Pearl\r\nCoast, as the South American shore of the admiral's third voyage was\r\nnow called. Obtaining from Fonseca's office a royal license,[III-3]\r\nand enlisting the coöperation of Juan de la Cosa, already veteran in\r\nwestern pilotage, Bastidas equipped two caravels,[III-4] embarked at\r\nCádiz in October, 1500, took on board wood, water, meat, and cheese at\r\nGomera, and steering a little north of the admiral's last track, came\r\nto a green isle, which he called Isla Verde, and reached the mainland\r\nnear Venezuela. Coasting westward, he passed Santa Marta, and arrived\r\nat the Magdalena River in March, 1501, so naming it on arrival from the\r\nday, which was that of the woman's conversion. There he narrowly escaped\r\nshipwreck. Continuing, and trading on the way, he found the ports of\r\nZamba and Coronados—the latter so called because the natives wore large\r\ncrowns—the islands of San Bernardo, Barú, and the Arenas, off Cartagena\r\nBay. Next he saw Fuerte and tenantless Tortuga, touched at the port of\r\nCenú, passed Point Caribana, entered the gulf of Urabá, and saw the\r\n_farallones_, or craggy islet peaks, rising abruptly from the water\r\nnear the Darien shore. Thus far from Cape de la Vela he had discovered\r\none hundred and fifty leagues[III-5] of new seaboard. And because when\r\nthe tide was low the water was fresh, he called the place Golfo Dulce.\r\nThus came the Spaniards upon the isthmus that unites the two Americas;\r\nand along it they sailed to Point Manzanilla, in which vicinity were El\r\nRetrete and Nombre de Dios.[III-6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLORIES OF THE ISTHMUS.]\r\n\r\nIt is a balmy beginning, this of these men from Spain, of that\r\nintercontinental commerce which is shortly to bring destruction on one\r\nside and retrogression on the other; a commerce which shall end only\r\nwith the next general cataclysm. Threading their way among islands\r\nsmothered in foliage, which seemed upon the glossy water-surface as\r\nfloating fragments of the thickly matted verdure of the mainland,\r\nlistening to notes unfamiliar to their ears, and seeing these strange\r\nmen and women so like and yet so unlike Spaniards, they find themselves\r\nwondering whether they are in the world or out of it. We who so well\r\nknow our little planet and its ways can scarcely imagine what it was in\r\nthe darkness to be taken up at Seville, and put down amidst the magic\r\nplay of light and shade at Darien. Probably now the world was round; yet\r\nstill it might be fungiform, or crescent-shaped, or amorphous, having\r\na smooth or ragged edge, from which a fearful slipping-off might any\r\nmoment ensue. All they can know is what they see, and that they cannot\r\nhalf know, for they can scarcely more than half see or feel or smell.\r\nSome part of the perpendicular rays of the incandescent sun falling on\r\ntheir toughened skins they can feel; some part of the water that from\r\nthe surcharged reservoirs of low-lying clouds so frequently and freely\r\npours upon the spot whence it is pumped by this same vertical sun. They\r\ncan turn their bewildered eyes toward the south and see beyond its clean\r\nwhite border the mainland stretching off in billows of burnished green\r\nto the far-away hazy horizon, where like a voluptuous beauty it imprints\r\na kiss upon the blushing sky; they may lie in the gray mist of evening\r\nand dream, and dream, their minds—how many removes from the intelligence\r\nof the impatient sea and the self-tuned life upon the shore? Or they may\r\ndrift about in the amber light of a soft vaporous morning without much\r\ndreaming; one thing at least to them is real, and that is gold. Without\r\nthe aid of divine revelation they fathom the difference between the\r\nprecious solid substance and hollow brass. So do the savages, thinking\r\nthe latter much the prettier; and thus both sides, each believing the\r\nothers fools and well cheated, are happy in their traffic. The Spaniards\r\nare enchanted less by the lovely garb in which nature everywhere greets\r\nthem than by the ease with which the golden harvest is gathered. Thus\r\nall betokens the most flattering success when a luckless event casts a\r\nshadow over their bright fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe two ships were found to be leaking badly. An examination was made,\r\nwhen the bottoms were found pierced by teredos;[III-7] and thus before\r\nthey knew it their vessels were unfit for service. Hoping still to reach\r\nCádiz, Bastidas immediately set sail, touched at Jamaica for wood and\r\nwater, and continued his voyage as far as Contramaestre, an islet one\r\nleague distant from Española, where he was obliged to anchor and repair\r\nhis ships. Again embarking for Spain, he was met by a gale which threw\r\nhim back upon the island. Buffeted in a second attempt, he ran the\r\nships for safety into the little port of Jaraguá, where they filled and\r\nsank, the loss in vessels, slaves, Brazil-wood, cloth, and gold, being\r\nnot less than five millions of maravedís.[III-8] For notwithstanding\r\nthe estimable reputation for piety, justice, and humanity which he\r\nhas always borne, the good Bastidas did not scruple gently to entrap\r\non board his ships, along the shore of Darien, several scores of\r\nunsuspecting natives, to be sold as slaves; nor, having thus exercised\r\nhis virtues in the klopemania of the day, did he scruple to abandon\r\nwith his sinking ships the greater portion of these innocent wretches\r\nin order to save the more of his gold, which was deemed of greater\r\nproximate and certain value than the bodies or even the souls of the\r\nheathen.\r\n\r\nThus observing everywhere, as perforce we must as we proceed, the\r\nmagnanimity and high morality with which our so prized and petted\r\ncivilization greeted weak, defenseless, and inoffensive savagism, we\r\nare prepared when shipwrecked mariners are thrown upon a distant isle\r\ninhabited by their own countrymen, subjects of the same sovereigns—we\r\nare prepared by their reception, which we shall presently see, to\r\nexclaim with uplifted hands, Behold, how these brethren love one\r\nanother!\r\n\r\nAfter burning superfluous ammunition, the Spaniards gathered up\r\ntheir valuables, and placing them on the backs of such captives as\r\nfor that purpose they had kindly permitted to live, set out in three\r\ndivisions over separate routes, so as to secure a more liberal supply\r\nof provisions on the way, for Santo Domingo, distant seventy leagues.\r\nIn his license, as we have seen, Bastidas was authorized to trade only\r\nin lands discovered by himself. But on the way his followers with their\r\ntrinkets had purchased food from the natives; for which offence, on\r\nhis arrival at Santo Domingo, Bastidas was seized by Bobadilla and cast\r\ninto prison. In vain did all the shipwrecked company protest that they\r\nhad bought only such articles as were necessary for their nourishment\r\nduring the march. To their affirmations the governor turned a deaf ear;\r\nand as Bobadilla was about to depart for Spain, the notary was ordered\r\nthither for trial, sailing in July, 1502.\r\n\r\nBefore the sovereigns Bastidas found no difficulty in justifying his\r\nconduct; and so rich were the returns from his traffic with the natives\r\nof Darien, that notwithstanding the unfortunate termination of the\r\nadventure he was enabled to pay a large sum into the royal treasury. For\r\ntheir important successes, to Rodrigo de Bastidas was awarded an annual\r\npension of fifty thousand maravedís, and to Juan de la Cosa a similar\r\nsum with the title of alguacil mayor of Urabá, all to be paid them out\r\nof returns from the new lands which they had found. \"Such,\" remarks\r\nIrving, \"was the economical generosity of King Ferdinand, who rewarded\r\nthe past toils of his adventurous discoverers out of the expected\r\nproduce of their future labors.\"[III-9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARCHIVES OF THE INDIES.]\r\n\r\nThe most fertile source of information relative to the early affairs\r\nof America is the _Archives of the Indies_, a general term comprising\r\nvarious collections in various places. From this source many writers\r\nhave drawn, and are still drawing; many documents have been printed,\r\nand many yet remain to be printed. Altogether the collections are very\r\nnumerous, as the government required full records, and in some cases\r\ncopies, to be kept of official documents concerning discovery, conquest,\r\nand settlement. The several council-chambers and public offices where\r\nthe business was transacted were the first depositories of these papers,\r\nthe chief places then being Seville, Cádiz, and Madrid. In 1566 Philip\r\nII. ordered all collections, ecclesiastic and secular, to be united,\r\nand deposited in the fortress of Simancas. Again in 1717, when all the\r\ncouncils were consolidated in one, Felipe V., who founded the _Academia\r\nde la Historia_, among other things for the gathering and preserving\r\nof materials for history, directed all papers to be conveyed annually\r\nto the _Archivo de Simancas_. These provisions could not have been\r\nfully carried out, or else a very extensive system of copying must have\r\nbeen practised; for later, when the Archives were thrown open to the\r\nsearch of historians, the accumulation at Simancas, though large, did\r\nnot appear to be much greater than at some other places. Further than\r\nthis, there were family archives in the houses of those who had played\r\nprominent parts in public affairs, and ecclesiastical relaciones in the\r\nconvents of the several orders, of little less importance than public\r\nrecords. And while the government insisted on the making of complete\r\nrecords, and observed great care in preventing their contents from being\r\nknown, especially to foreigners, little pains was taken to preserve\r\nthem from damage or destruction, or to arrange them for convenient\r\nreference. Therefore when they came to light it was in the form of\r\nbulky masses of unassorted, worm-eaten, and partially illegible papers.\r\nMany documents, mentioned by contemporary writers, are known to have\r\nbeen lost, and their contents blotted from existence. Fernando VI.,\r\n1746-1759, commissioned Burriel and Santiago Palomares to examine the\r\narchives of the kingdom and to copy and form into a collection such of\r\nthe manuscripts as they should deem best. This collection was placed\r\nin the _Biblioteca Nacional_ at Madrid. Other collections were made\r\nduring the two following reigns by Abella, Traggia, Velazquez, Muñoz,\r\nNavarrete, Sans, Vargas Ponce, and Villanueva, which found lodgment in\r\nvarious localities.\r\n\r\nThe early chroniclers of the Indies picked up their knowledge as best\r\nthey might, by observation, by conversation, and by the examination\r\nof written evidence. Las Casas and Oviedo spent much time in the New\r\nWorld; Peter Martyr had access to whatever existed, beside talking with\r\neverybody who had been to America; Gomara copied much from Oviedo.\r\nEverything was at the disposal of Herrera as crown historiographer,\r\nas a matter of course, though he did not always make the best use of\r\nhis opportunities. Gashard affirms that both Cabrera and Herrera were\r\nignorant of the existence of many of the most valuable documents of\r\ntheir day. Ramusio, Hakluyt, Purchas, and others, succeeded in getting\r\nnow and then an original paper on the Indies to print in their several\r\ncollections. Among the first English historians who attempted for\r\npurposes of history to utilize the Archives of the Indies was William\r\nRobertson, who published the _History of the Reign of the Emperor\r\nCharles_, London, 1769; and in 1777, his _History of America_, 2 vols.\r\n4to, several editions appearing subsequently also in 8vo. Robertson was\r\na Scotch clergyman of great learning and ability. His style was elegant\r\nand vigorous, and he was by far the most philosophic writer on America\r\nup to his time. Although his statements are full of errors, intensified\r\nby dogmatism, but for which he cannot always be blamed, all who have\r\ncome after him have profited by his writings; and some of these, indeed,\r\nhave reaped richer rewards than he to whom they owed their success, and\r\nwith far less labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROBERTSON AND MUÑOZ.]\r\n\r\nEarly in his work Mr Robertson applied to the proper authorities at\r\nMadrid, Vienna, and St Petersburg for access to material. Germany and\r\nRussia responded in a spirit of liberality, but Spain would none of\r\nit. In 1775 Robertson ascertained that the largest room occupied by\r\nthe _Archivos de Simancas_ was filled with American papers, in 873\r\nbundles; that they were concealed from strangers with solicitous care,\r\nSpanish subjects even being denied access without an order from the\r\ncrown; and that no copies could be obtained except upon the payment\r\nof exorbitant fees. However, through the assistance of Lord Grantham,\r\nEnglish ambassador at Madrid, and by preparing a set of questions\r\nto be submitted to persons who had lived in America, much new and\r\nimportant information was elicited, and copies of certain manuscripts\r\nwere obtained. The letters of Cortés, and the writings of Motolinia,\r\nMendieta, and others, which Robertson used in manuscript, have since\r\nbeen printed.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that the learned Juan Bautista Muñoz\r\ndid not live to complete his _Historia del Nuevo Mundo_, only the\r\nfirst volume of which appeared. This was published in Madrid, in 1793,\r\nbringing his work down to 1500. Muñoz was born near Valencia in 1745,\r\ngraduated at the University, and in 1779 was commissioned by the king\r\nto write a history of America, all public and private material being\r\nplaced at his disposal by royal order. Many papers were wanting in\r\nthe archives of the department of the Indies in Madrid; whereupon he\r\nwent to Simancas, Seville, Cádiz, and other towns, armed with a royal\r\n_cédula_, which opened to him family and monastic accumulations as\r\nwell as all public depositories. So great was the confusion in which\r\nhe found the royal archives, that it seemed to him as if they had been\r\ndisarranged purposely to hide what they contained. Even in the indices\r\nof the _Archivo Secreto del Consejo de Indias_ there was scarcely\r\nany indication of papers belonging to the earlier American periods.\r\nNevertheless, by persistent search, mass after mass of rich material was\r\nunearthed in the secret archives as well as in the _Real Casa Audiencia\r\nde la Contratacion_, the archives at Simancas, the royal libraries of\r\nMadrid and the Escorial, the _Contaduría Principal_ of the _Audiencia de\r\nIndias_ in Cádiz, the _Archivo General de Portugal_, the monastery of\r\nMonserrate, the colleges of San Bartolomé and Cuenca at Salamanca, and\r\nSan Gregorio at Valladolid, the cathedral of Palencia, the Sacromonte of\r\nGranada, and in the convents of San Francisco of Tolosa in Guipúzcoa,\r\nSanto Domingo of Málaga, and San Acacio, San José, and San Isidro del\r\nCampo of Seville, until it may be said of him that his efforts were\r\nburied beneath the magnitude of their invocation. Then it was that he\r\nfound he had undertaken greater things than he could accomplish. Even\r\nwith the aid of government he could not master the confused masses;\r\nfor money and men unlimited cannot accomplish everything without time.\r\nThe indefatigable Muñoz worked faithfully; the king complained of the\r\nmeagre results; the author died doing his best, and his work to this\r\nday remains undone. During his labors he made an extensive collection\r\nof papers, memorials, and other manuscripts relating to America, known\r\nas the _Coleccion de Muñoz_, which he once intended to publish, but this\r\nwith a portion of his history was left in manuscript. Irving states that\r\nthe papers of Muñoz were left with Señor Uguina, and Ternaux-Compans\r\nclaims to have obtained all of Uguina's manuscripts; but Prescott\r\nasserts that the collection of Muñoz was deposited in the archives of\r\nthe Royal Academy of History at Madrid, and was there augmented by the\r\nmanuscripts of Vargas Ponce, obtained chiefly from the archives of the\r\nIndies at Seville. Prior to 1793 the _Archivo General de Indias_ was\r\nestablished at Seville, and a large quantity of old papers conveyed\r\nthither from Madrid and Simancas. About 1810 the archives at Simancas\r\nwere sacked by Napoleon; in 1814 the remnant was re-arranged and\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\nBefore the death of Muñoz, Navarrete was commissioned by the king to\r\nsearch the archives for documents relating to the doings of the Spanish\r\nnavy. By him personally, or under his direction when occupied in other\r\nduties, the search was continued from 1789 to 1825. The results of these\r\nlabors were as follows: before 1793, twenty-four folio volumes of copies\r\nfrom the Royal Library at Madrid, the collections of the marquises\r\nof Santa Cruz and of Villafranca, of the dukes de Medina Sidonia and\r\ndel Infantado, and from the _Biblioteca de los estudios reales de San\r\nIsidro_, and the _Biblioteca alta del Escorial_; after 1793, seventeen\r\nvolumes of copies from the _Archivo General de Indias_, including the\r\npapers in the _Casa de Contratacion_ in Seville, the _Colegio de San\r\nTelmo_, the _Biblioteca de San Acacio_, and from the collection of the\r\nConde del Aguila. With this material, increased by subsequent researches\r\nin the libraries of the Royal Academy of History in Madrid, and other\r\npublic institutions, and in many private collections, particularly\r\nthat of the Duke of Veraguas, and with access to the Muñoz collection,\r\nNavarrete began in 1825 the publication of his _Coleccion de los Viages\r\ny Descubrimientos, que hicieron por mar los Españoles desde fines del\r\nSiglo_ XV., in 5 vols., Madrid, 1825-37, in which he printed over 500\r\ndocuments, many of them of the highest importance. As this collection\r\nconstitutes one of the chief authorities upon the early affairs of\r\nDarien, a brief notice of the author may not be out of place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARTIN FERNANDEZ DE NAVARRETE.]\r\n\r\nMartin Fernandez de Navarrete was born in 1765 in Ábalos in old Castile.\r\nHe entered the seminary of Vergara in 1777, where he studied Latin and\r\nmathematics and displayed some literary taste. In 1780 he joined the\r\nnavy, was stationed first as a midshipman at Ferrol, joined Córdoba's\r\nsquadron in 1781, and cruised in the summer of that year on the English\r\ncoast. He did good service before Gibraltar in September, 1782, and\r\nin the battle off Cape Espartel the 20th of October following. In\r\n1783, having been promoted to a naval ensigncy, he was appointed to\r\nthe Cartagena department, and cruised in consequence against the Moors\r\nduring the years 1784-5. On the close of the Algerine wars he studied\r\nthe higher mathematics, navigation, and manœuvring with Gabriel de\r\nCíscar, distinguishing himself in these branches. In 1789, his health\r\nforcing him to quit active service, he was commissioned by Carlos IV.\r\nto examine the archives of the kingdom and collect manuscripts relating\r\nto marine history; a work for which his zeal and knowledge particularly\r\nfitted him. This was the beginning of his famous Collection of Voyages,\r\nalthough its first volumes did not appear till thirty-six years after.\r\nWhen the war broke out between France and Spain in 1793, he joined the\r\nsquadron commanded by Juan de Lángara, who appointed him his chief aid,\r\n_primer ayudante_, and secretary. He was still at sea, in 1796, when war\r\nwas declared against England; but in 1797, Lángara being named minister\r\nof marine, and unwilling to lose his young secretary, he brought him to\r\nMadrid, giving him a place in the department. Here, in 1802, Navarrete\r\npublished, as a preface to the _Relacion del Viage hecho por las goletas\r\nSutil y Mexicana_, a résumé of Spanish discoveries on the Californian\r\nand Northwest coasts, that has been much cited in the English-American\r\ndisputes about the Oregon boundary. Meanwhile his merits were recognized\r\nin Madrid. In 1807 he was named _ministro fiscal_ of the supreme council\r\nof the admiralty court, he holding already the rank of captain. But\r\nin this year came the French invasion, overturning all things. Madrid\r\nfell in 1808. In 1812 Navarrete was found in Cádiz; in 1814 in Murcia.\r\nFernando regained his throne, however, May 14, 1814; four months after\r\nwhich event Navarrete returned to Madrid. In 1815 he proposed from his\r\nplace in the Spanish Academy that new system of orthography which has\r\nbeen adopted for its dictionary. He interested himself also in the fine\r\narts, and as secretary of the Academy of San Fernando contributed many\r\nvaluable papers to its Transactions. Soon after his return to Madrid,\r\nbeing little pleased with the stormy and veering statesmanship of the\r\nday, he retired as much as possible from politics, and began to collect\r\nmaterials for his life of Cervantes—an excellent and very complete work\r\npublished by the academy, with its edition of _Don Quijote_, in 1820.\r\nHonors continued to cluster around the historian. Toward the close\r\nof 1823 he was appointed director of the hydrographic department, and\r\nhe became for many years in fact, if not in name, the great and chief\r\nnaval authority of Spain; and this without prejudice to his literary\r\nactivity. In 1825 appeared the first two volumes of his Collection of\r\nVoyages; the third appeared in 1829; the fourth and fifth in 1837; while\r\nthe sixth and seventh were still unfinished at the author's death. On\r\nthe publication of the _Estatuto Real_, in 1834, he received a place in\r\nthe new peerage, and sat afterward as senator for his own province, in\r\nalmost every legislature. But his studious life and pacific character\r\nwere hardly destined to shine in a political career, nor was it for\r\nthe interest of science that they should. In the winter of 1844, in\r\nthe seventy-ninth year of his age, Navarrete died. The Academy issued\r\na posthumous work of his in 1846, a dissertation on the history of\r\nthe nautical and mathematical sciences in Spain. A collection of his\r\nsmaller works, _Coleccion de Opúsculos_, was begun in 1848 by his son.\r\nThe two volumes which have already appeared consist mainly of short\r\nbiographies of Spanish navigators and literary men, previously scattered\r\nin periodicals and in the transactions of the various academies and\r\nsocieties. Navarrete was a man of learning and research, as clearly\r\nappears; inclined somewhat to verbosity; tiresome to most readers,\r\nthough pronounced _elegante y castizo_ by his contemporaries. Of the\r\nhistorical value of his works, however, there is but one opinion.\r\nHumboldt speaks of his Collection of Voyages as 'one of the most\r\nimportant monuments of modern times,' and calls him 'the most accurate\r\nhistorian of the geographical discoveries on the New Continent.' The\r\nBaron de Zach, M. de Berthelot, Prescott, Helps, Irving, and Stirling,\r\nhave all given him much consideration. Indeed, the friends of Navarrete\r\ncannot complain that he has not been honored. Decorated with grand\r\norders, member in high place of many academies and societies, his\r\nlot was more fortunate than is usual among literary men. The parts\r\nof Navarrete's collection which bear most directly upon this history\r\nare: _Relacion de Diego de Porras_, i. 282-96; _Carta que escribió D.\r\nCristóbal Colon_, i. 296-313; _Relacion hecha por Diego Mendez_, i.\r\n314-29; _Cartas de Colon_, i. 330-52; _Viages Menores_, iii. 1-74; _Real\r\ncédula por la cual, con referencia á lo capitulado con Diego de Nicuesa\r\ny Alonso de Hojeda_, iii. 116-17; _Noticias biográficas del capitan\r\nAlonso Hojeda_, iii. 163-76; and the _Establecimientos ó Primeras\r\nPoblaciones de los Españoles en el Darien_, including instructions to\r\nPedrarias, letters of Vasco Nuñez, memorial of Rodrigo de Colmenares,\r\nand the relation of Pascual de Andagoya, iii. 337-459.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Navarrete's _Coleccion de Viages_ put to press, when\r\nWashington Irving heard of it, and went to Madrid with the intention\r\nof translating it into English. But he soon saw that with less labor\r\nhe could accomplish a work which would yield him greater returns.\r\nNavarrete, who had already collected the material and prepared the way,\r\nwas still disposed to lend the genial American every assistance; it was\r\nnecessary for him to make few original investigations; so that under the\r\ncircumstances the _Life of Columbus_ was by no means a difficult task\r\nfor so ready a writer. Humboldt visited Madrid before coming to America,\r\nbut seems to have consulted no important historical documents not in the\r\npossession of others. Prescott obtained from the collections of Muñoz\r\nand Navarrete 8000 foolscap pages of copies, most of which having any\r\nimportance have since been printed by Icazbalceta, Alaman, and others.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1837 and 1841 Henri Ternaux-Compans published at\r\nParis twenty volumes of _Voyages, relations, et mémoires originaux\r\npour servir à l'histoire de la découverte de l'Amérique_, containing,\r\nbeside translations of several rare and then unobtainable works,\r\nsome seventy-five original documents, several of them from the Muñoz\r\ncollection, and others obtained from the Spanish archives in some\r\nunexplained way, possibly not wholly disconnected with the French\r\ncampaign on the Peninsula. Among his translations are documents relating\r\nto the conquest and settlement of Central America and Mexico, the\r\nrelations of Cabeza de Vaca and Ixtlilxochitl, Oviedo's History of\r\nNicaragua, Zurita's Report on New Spain, and Ixtlilxochitl's History of\r\nthe Chichimecs. Ternaux-Compans also published _Recueil de documents\r\net mémoires originaux sur l'histoire des possessions espagnoles dans\r\nl'Amérique_, Paris, 1840; and _Bibliothèque américaine_, a catalogue of\r\nbooks on America appearing prior to 1700.\r\n\r\nThe project of printing original papers selected from national and\r\nfamily archives was agitated in Spain by Campomanes, Jovellanos,\r\nVillamil, and others, who collected and wrote much upon the subject. The\r\nscheme was delayed by the political disruptions incident to the early\r\npart of the century, by which the archives became badly scattered. In\r\n1842, under the auspices of the _Academia de la Historia_, was begun\r\nthe publication, at Madrid, of a _Coleccion de Documentos Inéditos para\r\nla Historia de España_, with the names of Martin Fernandez Navarrete,\r\nMiguel Salvá, and Pedro Sainz de Baranda on the title-page. Navarrete\r\nlived to see only the fifth volume; Salvá and Baranda continued the\r\npublication to vol. xxiii., after which, Salvá edited alone to vol.\r\nxxxii., when he was joined by the marquises of Pidal and of Miraflores.\r\nAfter vol. xlvii., Pidal's name was dropped, and with vol. lvii. Salvá\r\nand the Marqués de Fuente del Valle appeared as editors. In connection\r\nwith documents relating to the general history of Spain is here printed\r\na vast amount of matter about America, and the doings of Spaniards in\r\nthat quarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TERNAUX-COMPANS, ALAMAN, AND OTHERS.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next score of years floods of light are let in upon the dark\r\nrecesses of hidden treasures, the spirit of unearthing which extends\r\nto Mexico. I may mention incidentally Ramirez, who, in his _Proceso de\r\nResidencia contra Alvarado_ and _Nuño de Guzman_, gives some original\r\nMexican documents not elsewhere published. Alaman, at the close of his\r\n_Disertaciones_, prints about forty original documents on the time of\r\nthe Conquest, some of them from the collection of Navarrete, and others\r\nfrom original sources, such as the Hospital de Jesus in Mexico. The\r\n_Documentos para la Historia de México_, Mexico, 1853-7, in 21 volumes,\r\nwas made chiefly from Mexican sources, and is specially valuable\r\nfor north-west Mexico. Icazbalceta's collection includes fifty-three\r\ndocuments, with few exceptions _inéditos_, the existence of several\r\nof which, such as a letter of Cortés, and the relation of Tapia on the\r\nConquest, was then unknown. Most of them were obtained through Gonzalez\r\nde Vera, of Madrid; only two or three were found in Mexico. Thus far\r\nIcazbalceta's collection refers exclusively to the sixteenth century.\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg, for his _Histoire des Nations Civilisées du\r\nMexique_, Paris, 1857-9, one volume of which is devoted to a history\r\nof the Conquest from an Indian stand-point, seems to have relied\r\non his Nahua manuscripts, the standard histories, and a few Spanish\r\nmanuscripts. Although much thus far had been done, it seemed little to\r\nthe savans of Spain in comparison with what yet might be accomplished.\r\nAnd it was with this feeling that the government authorized the printing\r\nof any documents in the _Real Archivo de Indias_ affecting the history\r\nof America down to the end of the seventeenth century. The publication\r\nof this new series of papers was begun at Madrid in 1864 under title of\r\n_Coleccion de Documentos Inéditos relativos al Descubrimiento, Conquista\r\ny Colonizacion de las posesiones Españolas en América y Oceanía,\r\nsacados, en su mayor parte, del Real Archivo de Indias_. Joaquin F.\r\nPacheco, Francisco de Cárdenas, and Luis Torres de Mendoza were editors\r\nat the first. After vol. iii. the first two names were dropped, and\r\nafter vol. xii. the third, the work being thenceforth continued,\r\n_competentemente autorizada_. By this publication alone were placed\r\nwithin easy reach of all the world hundreds of the richest treasures\r\nof the Archives of the Indies, twenty for every one that the writer of\r\nthirty years ago could reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS ON THE COASTS OF HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, AND COSTA RICA.\r\n\r\n1502-1506.\r\n\r\n     THE SOVEREIGNS DECLINE EITHER TO RESTORE TO THE ADMIRAL HIS\r\n     GOVERNMENT, OR TO CAPTURE FOR HIM THE HOLY SEPULCHRE—SO HE\r\n     SAILS ON A FOURTH VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY—FERNANDO COLON AND HIS\r\n     HISTORY—OVANDO DENIES THE EXPEDITION ENTRANCE TO SANTO DOMINGO\r\n     HARBOR—COLUMBUS SAILS WESTWARD—STRIKES THE SHORE OF HONDURAS\r\n     NEAR GUANAJA ISLAND—EARLY AMERICAN CARTOGRAPHY—COLUMBUS COASTS\r\n     SOUTHWARD TO THE DARIEN ISTHMUS—THEN RETURNS AND ATTEMPTS\r\n     SETTLEMENT AT VERAGUA—DRIVEN THENCE, HIS VESSELS ARE WRECKED\r\n     AT JAMAICA—THERE MIDST STARVATION AND MUTINY HE REMAINS A\r\n     YEAR—THEN HE REACHES ESPAÑOLA AND FINALLY SPAIN, WHERE HE\r\n     SHORTLY AFTERWARD DIES—CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS—HIS BIOGRAPHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOURTH VOYAGE OF THE ADMIRAL.]\r\n\r\nSince his last return to Spain, Columbus had rested at Granada under\r\nthe smiles of the sovereigns, who readily promised him all that he\r\nmight wish, while resolved to grant nothing which could interfere\r\nwith their absolute domination of the new lands that he had found for\r\nthem. When tired of begging the restoration of his rights he urged\r\ntheir Majesties' assistance in seizing the holy sepulchre, that his\r\nvow might be fulfilled, and his mind at rest. After profound study and\r\nelaborate preparation he presented the case to them in a manuscript\r\nvolume of prophecies and portents intermingled with poetry. Failing\r\nin winning them to this scheme, he promised, if ships were provided\r\nhim, to undertake new discoveries. Partly because they would know\r\nmore of their New World possessions, and partly to rid themselves of\r\nuncomfortable importunities, the sovereigns assented to this proposal,\r\nmeanwhile intimating that after two years had been allowed in which to\r\nquiet Española, the admiral should have his own again, but as clearly\r\nindicating to others that he should not.\r\n\r\nFour vessels, ranging in burden from fifty to seventy tons, were then\r\nmade ready, the _Capitana_, the _Santiago de Polos_, the _Gallego_,\r\nand the _Vizcaino_, commanded respectively by Diego Tristan, Francisco\r\nde Porras, Pedro de Terreros, and Bartolomé de Fresco, and embarked\r\nat Cádiz the 9th of May, 1502. With the expedition sailed Diego de\r\nPorras as chief clerk and notary, and Juan Sanchez as chief pilot; one\r\nhundred and forty men and boys constituted the company. The admiral was\r\naccompanied by his brother Bartolomé, the adelantado,[IV-1] and by his\r\nson Fernando,[IV-2] then thirteen years of age. The sail across the\r\nocean was prosperous, with favorable winds and nothing to augur the\r\napproaching misfortunes until the ships arrived off Santo Domingo on\r\nthe 29th of June.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FATE OF BOBADILLA.]\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years matters had not improved at Española. It\r\nseems that others could govern badly as well as the admiral. Indeed, the\r\nkings of Spain, most of them meaning well by their New World subjects,\r\nwere too often unfortunate in their choice of agents. Until recently\r\nBobadilla had held sway, the sovereigns being apparently in no haste to\r\ndisplace him; from which course it was evident either that they had not\r\nbeen properly informed of his conduct, or they approved of it. Perhaps\r\nit was true that a knave was better for the place than an honest man. A\r\nsuccessor, however, had at length arrived in the person of Nicolás de\r\nOvando, and the superb fleet which had brought him, and was to carry\r\nback the displaced governor to Spain, now rode at anchor in the harbor.\r\n\r\nIn following that contriving policy which others beside princes\r\nsometimes regard as necessary when straightforwardness were better, it\r\nhad been deemed expedient that Columbus should not on this expedition\r\ntouch at Española, lest his presence engender fresh broils on the\r\nisland. And the admiral appeared to entertain no intention of breaking\r\nthe royal commands, until he found, on reaching the Indies, that one\r\nof his vessels was unfit for service; or else he pretended that it was\r\nso in order to look in on his late government. But whether in actual\r\nor feigned distress, when the admiral sent the 29th of June to ask of\r\nOvando permission to exchange a leaky caravel, or at least to shelter\r\nthe vessels from an impending storm, his messenger Terreros returned\r\nwith a refusal.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly an anomalous position in which the great discoverer\r\nfound himself, vainly knocking at the door of a possession which he had\r\nso lately given to Spain, and he not convicted, nay, scarcely accused\r\nof any crime. Columbus sent again and warned the governor of approaching\r\nbad weather. Ovando would not heed him. The gubernatorial fleet sailed;\r\nbut only to face a hurricane which soon strewed the shores of Española\r\nwith its fragments. Current biographies here read like a moral story. On\r\nthe wrecked vessels were Bobadilla, Roldan, and other inveterate enemies\r\nof the admiral, who with a huge mass of ill-gotten treasure were buried\r\nbeneath the waves. On a little caravel which survived the tempest was\r\nthe good Bastidas with his property; and on another, which likewise\r\nreached Spain in safety, were four thousand _pesos de oro_ belonging\r\nto Columbus. Furthermore the admiral sheltered his vessels, and so\r\nreceived no injury from the storm. From all which, grave deductions were\r\nseverally made—by Columbus, that the Almighty had preserved him; by his\r\nenemies, that he had employed witchcraft to save himself and property;\r\nby others, of a luckless order which providence refuses to recognize,\r\nthat the admiral and adelantado were good seamen. After certain ship\r\nrepairs, made without difficulty in a little port near Santo Domingo,\r\non the 14th of July Columbus sailed westward on his explorations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EARLY CARTOGRAPHY.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that at this time, and for several years\r\nafterward, the Spaniards did not know where they were. They supposed\r\nthe earth smaller than it is, and that they were on the barbarous\r\noutposts of India,[IV-3] whose interior was civilized and wealthy; and\r\nit was the present object of the admiral to find some strait or passage\r\nbetween this border-land and the detached southern regions about Paria,\r\non which he might sail to these rich inner realms, still coasting Asia\r\nsouth-westward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GUANAJA ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nA storm greeted him, followed by a calm, during which he was carried\r\nfirst southward by Jamaica, then northward past the western end of Cuba;\r\nafter which, the wind freshening, he continued his course, and on the\r\n30th of July came to a small elevated island, called by the natives\r\nGuanaja[IV-4], to which, from the trees that covered it, he gave the\r\nname Isla de Pinos. On going ashore, the adelantado found the island\r\ninhabited by people like those of Española and Cuba, except that they\r\nseemed more intelligent and knew more of the useful arts. Presently a\r\nlarge canoe appeared coming from the direction of Yucatan. It measured\r\neight feet in its greatest width, and was rowed by twenty-five men. In\r\nthe middle, under a palm-leaf awning, sat a _cacique_,[IV-5] or chief,\r\nwho manifested neither surprise nor fear on being brought into the\r\npresence of the admiral. He signified to the Spaniards as best he was\r\nable the extent and power of Mexico, and displayed utensils of copper,\r\nstone, and wood, earthen-ware, and cotton cloth brought thence. Gold was\r\nplentiful there, he also said; but the imagination of the admiral had\r\nmapped his strait somewhere southward; so Mexico was kept for Cortés.\r\n\r\nThere was on the island an ancient aboriginal of scientific attainments\r\nsufficient to enable him to draw for the Spaniards a chart of the\r\nmainland coast, and tell them much of the country. Him they took on\r\nboard, and after dismissing the cacique with presents, crossed to\r\nthe continent, and anchored near a point which Columbus called Punta\r\nde Caxinas,[IV-6] from the native name of a certain fruit abounding\r\nthereabout. Here the Spaniards landed on the 14th of August, and\r\ncelebrated mass; then proceeding eastward some fifteen leagues to\r\nthe mouth of a river,[IV-7] they again landed on the 17th, and took\r\nformal possession for Spain. About a hundred painted savages displayed\r\nthemselves, finer specimens than any on the islands, some naked,\r\nand others partially covered with white or colored cotton. They were\r\nfriendly, and presented fruit and vegetables, fish, fowl, and maize. So\r\nconspicuously distended were the ears of the natives at one place that\r\nthe name Costa de la Oreja was given to that vicinity.[IV-8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISCOVERY OF HONDURAS.]\r\n\r\nProceeding, the discoverers encountered a succession of gales which\r\ncontinued more than forty days, and having weathered them safely they\r\nwere so delighted that in sailing round the point of their deliverance\r\nthey thanked God, and called it Cape Gracias á Dios.[IV-9] All this\r\ntime Columbus suffered severely. Indeed, he was now but little better\r\nthan a wreck in body and mind. On the after part of the deck his bed\r\nwas placed, and there he lay overwhelmed with pain and melancholy, lost\r\nin endless mazes of speculation. Now and then he would rouse himself\r\nto translate his visions, or to direct the management of the ship, for\r\nthough half his senses should leave him, he was still a sailor from\r\ninstinct; but had it not been for the faithful energy of the adelantado,\r\nthe voyage might as well never have been undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe mariners had now entered a smooth sea; with a favorable wind they\r\npassed rapidly down the Mosquito Coast, giving the name Limonares to a\r\ncluster of islands on which grew something like lemons or limes, and on\r\nthe 16th of September anchored at the mouth of a large river. Boats were\r\nsent ashore for water, and in returning one was upset and the whole crew\r\nwere drowned; from which melancholy occurrence the stream was named Rio\r\ndel Desastre.[IV-10] Continuing, the 25th found the Spaniards off the\r\nRio San Juan de Nicaragua, where, to escape a storm, they ran in behind\r\nan island, the native name of which was Quiriviri,[IV-11] but which from\r\nits verdant beauty Columbus called La Huerta, The Garden. There they\r\nrested several days, and found sweet speculation, easily inducing the\r\nsavages to tell them such things as they should most delight to hear.\r\nIndeed, all along the coast had vague information been given, by signs\r\nill interpreted, of a remarkable country called Ciguare, nine days'\r\njourney westward beyond the mountains. The people there were like the\r\nSpaniards, clothed, and armed with steel weapons, with horses and great\r\nships. The women wore bands of coral and strings of pearls, and the\r\ncommonest utensils were of gold. Ten days' journey from Ciguare must\r\nlie the river Ganges; and best of all, there was a passage thither by\r\nsea; all the Spaniards had to do was to keep right on; they could not\r\nmiss the way. The Europeans gave full credit to these assertions. Thus\r\nfrom the beginning mankind have been directed, and oftentimes to the\r\ngrandest discoveries, by mingled accident and ignorance, and wise men\r\nlike Columbus have believed these supremely silly stories because it\r\npleased them to do so. These savages may have had rumors of Mexico or\r\nPeru on which to build their brilliant fictions; their statements were\r\nfictions none the less.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SORCERIES, SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED.]\r\n\r\nAnd indeed as they came together there for the first time, the white\r\nmen and the red, it is often difficult to tell on which side was the\r\ngreater simplicity and credulity. The folly of the Spaniard was moulded\r\ninto firmer consistence, was less inept and vapory than the folly of\r\nthe Americans, and that was about all. For instance, at the village of\r\nCariay,[IV-12] just opposite on the main-land, Columbus thought to raise\r\nthe Spaniards in the estimation of the savages by declining to take\r\nthe _guanin_, an inferior kind of gold which they presented; whereupon\r\nfor the same reason, and in retaliation, the natives refused European\r\ntrinkets. When the adelantado, seated on a knoll with the notary by his\r\nside, sought to transfix some of the wild knowledge of those parts, the\r\nnatives fled terrorstruck, supposing some magic spell was being cast\r\nupon them by the pens, ink, and paper so solemnly drawn forth by the\r\nscribe. Presently with great caution they returned, and with exorcising\r\ngesticulations burned and scattered in the air an odorous powder. On\r\nthe other hand, with equally enlightened common sense, the Christians,\r\nunable to fathom the incantations of savagism, fancied these heathen\r\nsorcerers bringing from the shades of their wilderness wrathful demons\r\nto hurl upon their adversaries; and ever after on the voyage all the\r\nills that befell the Spaniards were attributed to the enchantments of\r\nthe people of Cariay.[IV-13] At another port called Huiva, Columbus\r\nfound the huts of the natives built in trees, which he attributed\r\nto fear of griffins. After a short excursion into the interior the\r\nadelantado returned to the ships. Near Cape Gracias á Dios the old man\r\nof Guanaja had been liberated with presents, as no longer of use; now,\r\nseven natives were seized and made to divulge what they knew of the\r\ncountry, two of them being retained as guides.\r\n\r\nSailing from Cariay the 5th of October, the second day they came to\r\nthe Laguna de Chiriquí, the country thereabout being called by the\r\nnatives Cerebaro.[IV-14] If some distance back Columbus had found The\r\nGarden, here was a pluralized paradise. The wonder was how nature\r\ncontrived such glories. Round the entrance clustered islands whose\r\noutspread foliage brushed the venturesome sails that threaded the deep\r\nnarrow channels. Celestial beauty irradiated the land, and a celestial\r\nbrightness overspread the sea. But a small additional rent was necessary\r\nin the ragged imagination of the admiral to fancy himself already\r\ntranslated. The part of the laguna explored by this expedition was the\r\nnorth-western, known to-day as the Bahía del Almirante; the southern\r\npart was called by the natives Aburema.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GATHERING GOLD.]\r\n\r\nHanging from the necks of the natives was pure gold in plates, now\r\nfirst found since touching these shores, but the owners were content to\r\nkeep it. Further on, anywhere but here, they said, was plenty of gold,\r\nnotably at a place called Veragua, twenty-five leagues distant, where\r\nthese much-admired plates of gold were fabricated. Hastening forward,\r\nthe Spaniards arrived, on the 18th, at a river twelve leagues to the\r\neastward of Cerebaro, called by Fernando Colon, Guaiga, and by Porras,\r\nGuyga, where the savages attempted at first to drive them away by\r\nsplashing water, brandishing wooden swords, beating drums, and sounding\r\nconchs; which demonstration being over they quietly traded sixteen of\r\ntheir gold-plates, valued at one hundred and fifty ducats, for three\r\nhawk-bells. The following day the Spaniards were met in like manner by\r\nother savages whom a shot sent scampering; after which they returned\r\nand traded dutifully.\r\n\r\nAfter this the discoverers touched at the provinces of Catibá and\r\nCobrabá, where they saw the ruins of a wall built of stone and lime,\r\nwhich excited in them anticipations of a near approach to civilization;\r\nbut as they neared the rich river the wind freshened and carried them\r\npast, without however preventing a glimpse of five towns, one of which\r\nthe guides assured them was Veragua.[IV-15] In the next province,\r\nCubigá, terminated the gold region, so they were told. Some were eager\r\nto go back to Veragua and gather gold, but anxious to find his strait\r\nColumbus put them off, saying he would return anon.\r\n\r\nFancy the old admiral groping in the darkness, the world, the universe\r\nclear enough to him as mapped in his own mind, but unhappily not fitting\r\nthe substantial facts. Instinctively he seems to hover about this the\r\nnarrowest part of the continent, his ship's prow now pointed directly\r\ntoward Spain, with India so far away, and the vast water intervening,\r\nand the small but mighty strip of land that makes his mental map of no\r\navail. Thus since the world began millions have mapped eternity, and\r\nstill do map it, the heavenly powers meanwhile laughing at the miserable\r\nwork men make of it.\r\n\r\nThus vainly searching, on the 2d of November Columbus finds his ships at\r\nanchor in a beautiful and commodious harbor entered between two islands.\r\nOn every side are fields of maize, and orchards of fruit, and groves of\r\npalm; for the people dwell in houses and cultivate the ground. There\r\nhe remains seven days, waiting the cessation of a storm; and he calls\r\nthe place Puerto Bello, also written Portobello, which name it has ever\r\nsince retained. Venturing forth on the 9th, he makes eastward eight\r\nleagues, but is driven back, and takes refuge behind some islands in\r\na small harbor, which he calls Puerto de Bastimentos,[IV-16] from the\r\nabundance of provisions brought them there. After repairing the ships,\r\nnow badly worm-eaten, he again on the 23d attempts an advance eastward,\r\nbut is speedily driven into a cove, which he names El Retrete, some\r\ncalling it Puerto de Escribanos, and which is so small as barely to\r\nadmit the ships, and so deep that bottom cannot be touched.[IV-17]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: END OF THE ADMIRAL'S DISCOVERIES.]\r\n\r\nAnd now the mariners show signs of discontent; with gold so near they\r\nare not Spaniards else. And the great discoverer, the admiral of the\r\nocean sea, must he bury in this little crevice of a barbarous shore\r\nhis mighty hopes? Bastidas was here,[IV-18] although it is not certain\r\nhow well informed the admiral is of the fact, whether he had notice\r\nfrom Bastidas at Santo Domingo as to the termination of his voyage,\r\nor whether the natives here had told him; in any event, there cannot\r\nbe now in the admiral's mind much doubt that the coast is practically\r\ndiscovered from Trinidad to Guanaja, and that between these two islands\r\nis a shore-line of continent unbroken by any strait. Yes, as well\r\nunbrace here as elsewhere; and gold-hunting is not a bad occupation for\r\nan old man after his life's work is done.\r\n\r\nTurning then toward Veragua for solace, the Spaniards sailed from\r\nEl Retrete the 5th of December. But with this change the fickle wind\r\nhad likewise changed its course; wherever they went were storms and\r\nbuffetings, until Columbus pronounced upon that shore the name La Costa\r\nde los Contrastes. Where now was the balmy breath of perfumed isles,\r\nthe sparkling sun dancing beneath the wanton waters? Demonized. Gale\r\nfollowed gale in quick succession; winds contending, veering; now the\r\nmariners were hurried on toward their destination, only to be driven\r\nback to their starting-point. The stubborn waves struck the crazy barks\r\nwith such menacing force as to send the terror-stricken sailors to their\r\nknees in confession, and prayer for deliverance. For nine days the sea\r\nwas white with angry foam; the sky blazed with electric fires; the men\r\nfell sick; provisions spoiled. Long, lank, muscular sharks, weatherwise\r\nmonsters, followed the ships expectantly, until the hunger-smitten crews\r\neyed them ominously in return, until these creatures that had come to\r\neat were caught and eaten by these other creatures. All this time down\r\npoured the rain in torrents and nearly submerged the ships. In the\r\nmidst of these cataclysmal horrors a water-spout was seen approaching,\r\n\"which,\" Fernando Colon is sure, \"if they had not dissolved by reciting\r\nthe gospel of St John, would certainly have sunk whatever it had fallen\r\nupon.\" Twenty-nine days were occupied in making as many leagues to\r\nthe westward. Once the ships parted company for three days; twice they\r\nran into Portobello, and twice they took refuge at other places on the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nAt length, with thanksgiving, January 6, 1503, they came to anchor at\r\nthe mouth of a river, the native name of which was Yebra; but Columbus,\r\nin honor of the day, Epiphany, called it Santa María de Belen.[IV-19]\r\nOne league to the westward was the river Veragua. The admiral ordered\r\nboth streams to be sounded. The Veragua was found too shallow for the\r\nships. At the mouth of the Belen was a bar, which however could be\r\ncrossed at high water; above the bar the depth was four fathoms. On the\r\nbank of the Belen stood a village, whose inhabitants at first opposed\r\nthe landing of the Spaniards; but being persuaded by the interpreter,\r\nthey at length yielded. They were a well-developed, muscular people,\r\nrather above medium stature, intelligent, and exceptionally shrewd;\r\nin fact, in point of native ability they were in no wise inferior to\r\nthe Spaniards. When questioned concerning their country, they answered\r\nguardedly; when asked about their gold mines, they replied evasively.\r\nFirst, it was from some far-off mysterious mountain the metal came;\r\nthen the river Veragua was made to yield it all; there was none at all\r\nabout Belen, nor within their territory, in fact. Finally they took a\r\nfew trinkets, and gave the intruders twenty plates of gold, thinking\r\nto be rid of them. Within a day or two the vessels were taken over the\r\nbar, and on the 9th two of them ascended the river a short distance.\r\nThe natives made the best of it, and brought fish and gold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE QUIBIAN.]\r\n\r\nWith an armed force the adelantado sets out in boats to explore the\r\nVeragua. He has not proceeded far when he is met by a fleet of canoes,\r\nin one of which sits the _quibian_,[IV-20] the king of all that country,\r\nhaving under him many subordinate chiefs. He is tall, well-modelled,\r\nand compactly built, with restless, searching eyes, but otherwise\r\nexpressionless features, taciturn and dignified, and, for a savage,\r\nof exceptionally bland demeanor. We shall find him as politic as he\r\nis powerful; and as for his wealth, unfortunately for him, his domain\r\nincludes the richest gold mines of that rich coast. On the whole, the\r\nquibian is as fine a specimen of his race as the adelantado is of his.\r\nAnd thus they are fairly met, the men of Europe and the men of North\r\nAmerica; and as in the gladiatorial combat, which opens with a smiling\r\nsalutation, this four-century life-struggle begins with friendly\r\ngreetings. Pity it is, they are outwardly not more evenly matched; pity\r\nit is that the European with his superior civilization, his saltpetre,\r\nand blood-hounds, his steel weapons, and strange diseases, should be\r\nallowed to do his robbery so easily! But ravenous beasts and bloody\r\nbipeds are so made that they do not hesitate to take advantage of the\r\nhelpless; it is only civilized man, however, that calls his butcherings\r\nby pleasant names, such as progress, piety, and makes his religion and\r\nhis law conform to his heart's unjust desires.\r\n\r\nAs the champions approach each other, we see about them both an air of\r\ndetermination and command; and while extremely cordial, we see on either\r\nside that courtesy common to those who fear while they suspect. With\r\nprincely grace the red man takes from his naked body some massive golden\r\nornaments and presents them to the white man; the adelantado, not to\r\nbe outdone in generosity by a savage, with equal dignity and solemnity\r\npresents the red man a handful of valueless baubles. The ceremony over,\r\nwith mutual assurances of friendship the chieftains retire. Next day\r\nthe quibian visits the admiral in his ship. Neither has much to say;\r\npresents are exchanged, and the savage returns to his people.\r\n\r\nWhile the ships of the Spaniards lay by the bank in fancied security, on\r\nthe 24th of January the storm-demon, as if enraged at the escape of its\r\nvictims from the fury of the sea, rushed to the mountains, and opening\r\nthe windows of heaven, let down a deluge on the land. The rushing\r\ntorrents swept everything before them. The vessels were torn from their\r\nmoorings and carried down the river, only to be met at the mouth by the\r\nincoming breakers from the sea. And thus to their imminent peril they\r\nwere tossed for several days by the contending waters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BARTOLOMÉ PENETRATES THE INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nThe storm abating, and the ships made secure, the adelantado again\r\nstarted in search of the gold-fields. With sixty-eight men he ascended\r\nthe Veragua to the village of the quibian, whose house was situated\r\non a hill round which were scattered the dwellings of his people. The\r\nchieftain with a large retinue, unarmed in token of peace, welcomed\r\nthe visitors at the landing. Guides were readily furnished at the\r\nadelantado's request; so leaving part of his company to guard the boats,\r\nwith the remainder he set out on foot for the base of the mountain,\r\ndistant six leagues, which he reached the following day. For many miles\r\nhe found the soil richly impregnated with gold, and returned elated,\r\nas visions of populous cities and unbounded wealth floated through\r\nhis brain. Which seeing, the quibian grimly smiled that they should\r\ndeem their work already done, himself subdued, the land their own; and\r\nhe smiled to think how he had sent them round and away from his own\r\nrich mines to the poorer and more distant fields of Urirá, his ancient\r\nenemy. Then the adelantado explored westward, and came to the town and\r\nriver[IV-21] of this Urirá, and to the towns of Dururi, Cobrabá, and\r\nCatibá, where he obtained gold and provisions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were here fifty leagues of coast, from Cerebaro to Veragua,\r\ncalled by the Spaniards the _tierra de rescate_, or land of trade,\r\nmeaning trade in gold, that being the only thing worth trading for\r\nin an expedition of this kind. This seaboard was heavily wooded, and\r\nuninhabited except along the rivers, for three leagues inland. And\r\nall things seeming so favorable, Columbus thought he would plant a\r\ncolony here, leave eighty men and one of the vessels in charge of\r\nthe adelantado, and with the remainder return to Spain, report the\r\nresults of his discovery, and obtain reinforcements. In a word, if\r\nnot restrained by some Ferdinand, or Fonseca, or other hateful friend,\r\nhe would repeat with fresh enthusiasm his former errors which had so\r\nnearly wrought his ruin. But his usual ill-luck came to the rescue.\r\nThe quibian did not view with favor the preparations which he saw\r\nthe Spaniards making for a permanent residence on his lands, and he\r\ndetermined it should not be. But how could he prevent it? For he was\r\nwell aware of the advantages these strangers possessed in open warfare.\r\nYet there were several ways open to him; if he did not wish to attack\r\nthem with an overwhelming force he could devastate the country around,\r\nwithdraw his people, and leave the Spaniards to die, meanwhile cutting\r\noff such stragglers and foraging parties as he could easily handle. And\r\nthis he did, beginning operations by summoning the neighboring tribes,\r\nostensibly for the purpose of organizing an expedition against Urirá,\r\nand Cobrabá.\r\n\r\nThe suspicions of the Spaniards were aroused. Diego Mendez, _escudero_,\r\nesquire, or shield-bearer of the ship _Santiago_,[IV-22] a sharp, bold,\r\nand somewhat boastful man, but courageous beyond the comprehension of\r\nfear, asked and obtained permission to investigate the matter. Entering\r\nthe Veragua in an armed boat he found encamped below the quibian's\r\nvillage about a thousand painted warriors. Assuming an air of unconcern\r\nMendez landed and strolled leisurely among the savages. Remarking on\r\ntheir proposed expedition he offered to join them; but his services\r\nwere rejected, and his presence was manifestly distasteful to them.\r\nHe returned and reported that the savages were preparing to attack the\r\nSpaniards. Yet to satisfy some who doubted, Mendez went again, this time\r\ntaking with him one companion, Rodrigo de Escobar, intending plainly to\r\ndemand of the quibian his purpose. A host of frowning savages greeted\r\nthe visitors, who asked to see the quibian. They were informed that he\r\nwas lying ill from the effects of a wound received in battle. \"For that\r\nvery purpose,\" replied the ready Mendez, \"I a surgeon am come to heal\r\nhim.\" But the Spaniards could not gain audience of the chief, and they\r\nreturned more than ever convinced of his bloody intention toward them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAPTURE OF THE QUIBIAN.]\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? The admiral could not depart while hostilities\r\nwere pending, nor could the Spaniards delay their operations until it\r\nshould please the savages to attack them. The adelantado determined to\r\nforce an issue. With seventy-five men, on the morning of the 30th of\r\nMarch, he ascended the Veragua, and landed unobserved near the quibian's\r\nvillage. Hiding his men, he advanced, first with four attendants, then\r\nalone, until after some difficulty he gained admission to the quibian's\r\npresence. What Bartolomé was now attempting was the regular game,\r\nafterward played for higher stakes, but now being pretty generally\r\npractised in the New World; namely, to capture the chief and hold him\r\nhostage for the good behavior of his people. It was at the door in\r\nfront of the quibian's dwelling that this interview took place. The\r\nsavage suspected nothing. The very boldness of the scheme, so foreign\r\nto aboriginal warfare, tended to allay apprehension. Within were fifty\r\nof his household, and at easy call five hundred warriors; what had\r\nthe quibian to fear? The two chiefs sat and talked, first on general\r\nsubjects; then the adelantado enquired concernedly about his host's\r\nillness, examined the wound tenderly, passed his hands over the disabled\r\nlimb while proposing remedies. Suddenly the savage felt the grasp of the\r\nSpaniard tighten upon him, and before his suspicions were fairly aroused\r\nhis arms were pinioned behind him. Mendez, who had been watching, fired\r\nhis arquebuse, and the concealed Spaniards rushed forward and surrounded\r\nthe house. The quibian struggled, but weakened by sickness he was easily\r\nheld in the iron grasp of the adelantado, until by the aid of the other\r\nSpaniards he was made powerless. So adroitly was the feat performed,\r\nthat before the presence of the Spaniards was generally known among the\r\nnatives, their chief and all his family were captive, and on the way to\r\nthe boats. The savages lifted up the usual lamentations, and offered\r\nenormous ransom; but it had been determined beforehand that the chief\r\npersonages of the nation should be sent to Spain; for in such procedure,\r\nthe admiral thought, lay the greater security of his plans.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture in the narrative historians, even modern writers of\r\nfair intelligence, gravely discuss the probabilities of guilt in the\r\nquibian's supposed treachery, some holding with Diego de Porras that\r\nthe natives did not meditate attack; as if they had not the right to\r\ndefend their country, their wives and little ones, from the ravages of\r\nthe invader by any means within their power.\r\n\r\nPassing conventional twaddle—for if the quibian was not guilty he ought\r\nin honor to have been—it is very certain that this action on the part of\r\nthe Spaniards was the cause of many woes, and of their final overthrow\r\nin these parts.[IV-23] In any event it was now of the highest importance\r\nto secure the quibian. The whole adventure on this coast depended upon\r\nit; therefore the adelantado hastened to send his captives on board the\r\nships. Desirous of instituting other proceedings for the pacification\r\nof that section before returning, the adelantado looked about him for\r\na reliable person to whom he might entrust his weighty charge. Present\r\nwas Juan Sanchez, chief pilot, an honest sailor, not wholly indifferent\r\nto military honors, who earnestly offered service and was accepted. The\r\nquibian, tied hand and foot, was firmly bound to his seat in the boat;\r\nand superfluous as might appear any admonition, the adelantado charged\r\nJuan Sanchez to look well to his prisoner. \"Pluck out my beard hair by\r\nhair if he escape me,\" was the vaunting reply of the pilot as he shoved\r\nhis boat from the bank and started down the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUAN SANCHEZ OUTWITTED.]\r\n\r\nBut alas for the overweening confidence of a Peter or a Juan Sanchez!\r\nFighting the elements at sea is a different thing from fighting Indians\r\non land. Quite a different order of tactics is required; and the\r\nsailor's life is not the school in which to study the wiles of Indian\r\nstrategy. In the one place the sailor is not more superior than is the\r\nsavage in the other. The quibian, outwardly calm, inwardly is fiercely\r\nexcited; and like the wild beast when hotly pursued, his instincts\r\nquicken with the occasion. He and his loved ones are prisoners,\r\ntreacherously entrapped by a strange species of the human kind in\r\nreturn for fair words and generous hospitality. Their probable fate\r\npossesses all the horrors of uncertainty. Swiftly with the swift boat\r\nruns the time away; something must be done or all is lost. Narrowly,\r\nbut cautiously, the chief surveys his keeper. It is pleasant to look\r\nupon the homely face of honest Juan Sanchez; not a lineament there\r\nbut shines with God's best message to man, and in language which\r\neven dumb intelligence may read. Stern duty is largely diluted with\r\nhumanity, integrity with charming simplicity; from which the wily\r\nquibian takes his cue, and thenceforth is master of the situation.\r\nWith quiet dignity and cheerful resignation he sits among his people,\r\nhushing their lamentations and chiding their complaints. By words and\r\nlittle acts of consideration he lightens the labors of the boatmen, and\r\nstudies for himself and people to give no unnecessary trouble. These\r\nconciliatory measures are not lost on the warm-hearted sailor, whose\r\nregard for his royal captive rises every moment. He is pronounced by all\r\na well-mannered savage, a most courteous savage. And now the quibian\r\nmodestly complains of the cords so tightly drawn by the too zealous\r\nMendez. They do indeed cut into the flesh, and constrain him to a most\r\nuncomfortable position. And he such a gentleman-savage! Juan Sanchez\r\nis not the man to sit there and see a fellow-creature unnecessarily\r\nsuffer; he cannot do it. The thongs which lacerate the prisoner's wrists\r\nare loosened, the cord which binds him to the seat is untied; but for\r\nsecurity—for above all this great chief must be kept secure—one end of\r\nit the ever-watchful pilot twists round his hand. Night comes on. It is\r\nvery dark, but the captives are quiet, and the boat glides noiselessly\r\ndown the stream. Suddenly the light craft sways; a plunge is heard; the\r\npilot feels his hand violently wrenched; he must loosen his hold or be\r\ndrawn into the water. It is all as the flash of a pistol in point of\r\ntime; the quibian's seat is empty; and honest Juan Sanchez is obliged\r\nto present his hanging front before his comrades, a Spaniard outwitted\r\nby a savage!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter scouring the country in several directions, the adelantado\r\nreturned to the ships, bringing gold-plates, wristlets, and anklets\r\nto the value of three hundred ducats, which were divided, after\r\ndeducting the king's fifth. Among the spoils taken from the quibian\r\nwere two golden coronets, one of which was presented to Bartolomé by\r\nthe admiral. Notwithstanding the escape of the chief, who, after all,\r\nwas probably drowned, Columbus proceeded to execute his plans. There\r\nwere the king's household and his chief men safely on board, and these\r\nshould be sufficient to guarantee the tranquillity of the nations. So\r\nthe arrangements for the comfort and security of the colony during the\r\ncontemplated absence of the admiral were hastened to completion. The\r\nthree vessels, after discharging part of their cargoes, were carried by\r\nthe newly swollen stream over the bar, and reloaded. There they lay at\r\nanchor waiting a favorable wind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COUNTRY ROUSED.]\r\n\r\nAll this time, however, the Spaniards were reckoning without their host.\r\nThe quibian was not dead. In spite of his bonds, he had made good his\r\nescape. After his bold plunge, finding himself free from the boat, he\r\nhad extricated his wrists from the loosened cords, swam beneath the\r\nwater to the bank, and had set out for his village, resolving vengeance.\r\nAnd now, hastily arming a thousand warriors, he attacked the Spaniards\r\nunder cover of the dense vegetation, killing one and wounding eight,\r\nbut was soon repulsed with heavy loss. Shortly afterward Diego Tristan,\r\ncoming ashore from one of the vessels with eleven men, recklessly\r\nascended the river a league for wood and water. All but one were\r\nkilled.[IV-24]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aspect of affairs was serious. It was now evident that no fear\r\nof what might befall his imprisoned household would deter the quibian\r\nfrom his bloody purpose. Alive or dead might be his brothers, wives,\r\nand children, he would rid his country of these perfidious strangers.\r\nTo this end he secured the coöperation of the neighboring chieftains,\r\nand filled the forest with his warriors. Stealthily they lurked in the\r\nvicinity of the settlement, and watched every pathway, ready to cut off\r\nany who should venture abroad. Nowhere on the Islands had the Spaniards\r\nmet such stubborn opposition, and serious misgivings filled their minds.\r\nTheir own probable doom they saw foreshadowed in the mutilated bodies\r\nof Tristan and his men, which came floating past them down the stream,\r\nattended by ravenous fishes; and the requiems sung by quarrelling\r\nvultures over the remains when afterward they were thrown back by\r\nthe waves upon the beach, tended in no wise to lessen their dismal\r\nforebodings. To heighten their misfortunes, a furious storm arose,\r\nwhich cut off all communication between the settlement and the ships.\r\nThe adelantado endeavored in vain to quiet the fears of his people, who\r\nemboldened by despair would have seized the remaining caravel and put to\r\nsea had the weather permitted. Yet closer pressed upon them the enraged\r\nquibian, until dislodged they retreated to the river bank, before their\r\ncaravel, and threw up earthworks, which they capped with the ship's\r\nboat, and behind which they planted their guns, and so kept the savages\r\nat bay.\r\n\r\nOn shipboard matters were no better. The continued absence of Tristan\r\nand his crew caused the admiral great anxiety. In such a heavy sea\r\nit was unsafe to remain near the shore; the parting of a cable would\r\ndoom the clumsy craft to swift destruction. And as if this were not\r\nenough, the spirit of the quibian broke out among his encaged family.\r\nPreferring death to captivity they plotted escape. During the night the\r\nprisoners were confined in the forecastle, and on the covering slept\r\na guard of soldiers. Collecting one night such articles as were within\r\nreach, stones used as ballast, boxes, and provision casks, they piled\r\nthem up under the hatchway cover. Toward morning, when the guards were\r\nsleeping soundly, as many of the captives as were able mounted the heap,\r\nand placing their shoulders to the covering, by quick concerted action\r\nburst it open, throwing the sleeping sentinels in every direction, and\r\nspringing out leaped into the sea. Those whose escape was prevented were\r\nfound next morning dead, some hanging to the roof and sides of their\r\nprison, some strangled by means of strings round the neck drawn tight\r\nwith the foot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SETTLEMENT ABANDONED.]\r\n\r\nIt was now of the utmost importance to communicate with the shore,\r\nas the admiral was convinced that the situation of the colonists was\r\nbecoming perilous in the extreme. At least, all hope of settlement\r\nin that quarter must for the present be abandoned. The fate of the\r\ncaptives, when once it was known, would move the very rocks to revenge.\r\nBut no boat could live in the surf intervening. Then stepped forward\r\nPedro Ledesma, a Sevillian pilot, and offered if rowed to the breakers\r\nto attempt to gain the shore by swimming. The thing was done. Scarcely\r\nhad Ledesma picked himself up from the spot where the waves threw him\r\nwhen he was surrounded by his forlorn countrymen, who informed him of\r\nthe fate of Tristan, and of their determination to quit that accursed\r\ncoast at any hazard. Ledesma returned and told the admiral, upon\r\nwhose mind thereupon gloom settled in yet denser shades. Unrighteously\r\ndeprived of his command at Santo Domingo, he had nourished the hope that\r\nthis last and most important of his discoveries might prove the base of\r\nbetter fortune than was possible on the Spanish Isle. For had it not\r\nbeen revealed to him that this Veragua was the source whence Solomon\r\ndrew the gold to build the temple? These lamentations continued during\r\nthe remainder of the storm, which lasted nine days longer; after which\r\npreparations were made for the embarkation of the colonists, the admiral\r\nconsoling himself with the promise of return under more favorable\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\nFinally the caravel stationed in the river was dismantled, and out of\r\nthe spars and some Indian canoes was made a raft, by means of which the\r\ncolonists and their effects were in two days taken on board. The admiral\r\nthen bore away eastward for Española. And it may have been the lingering\r\nhope of blind infatuation—so his followers thought it—that made him\r\ncling to the shore until the Darien country was passed, before striking\r\nout across the Caribbean Sea; others say it was to avoid contrary winds,\r\nwhile he affirms it was to deceive his pilots that they might not be\r\nable to find Veragua again without his charts. One worm-eaten caravel\r\nhe was obliged to drop at Portobello. The other two held together until\r\nthey reached Jamaica, where they were beached.\r\n\r\nA new series of misfortunes here awaited the Great Unlucky One. From\r\nJune 1503 to June 1504 he was doomed to remain on his wrecks, which now\r\nlay side by side, partially filled with water. Food became scarce, and\r\nthe foraging expeditions met with constantly increasing difficulties\r\nin seeking the necessary supply. By desperate efforts Diego Mendez\r\nsucceeded in reaching Española in a canoe; but when he had notified\r\nOvando of the perilous situation of Columbus, the governor was in no\r\nhaste to relieve his rival. Sickness next followed, and then mutiny.\r\nFrancisco de Porras with forty-eight men threw off allegiance to the\r\nadmiral, and taking ten canoes set out for Española. Twice thrown back\r\nupon Jamaica by adverse winds they abandoned the attempt, and gave\r\nthemselves up to licentious roving about the island. A second mutiny\r\nwas near its culmination when a small vessel appeared in the distance.\r\nPresently Diego de Escobar approached in a boat, and without leaving\r\nit, thrust in upon the admiral a letter, a side of bacon, and a barrel\r\nof wine, all from Ovando; then he disappeared as mysteriously as he\r\nhad come. Following an attempted reconciliation with Porras was a fight\r\nbetween his gang and the Spaniards under Bartolomé, in which six were\r\nkilled, among them our honest friend Juan Sanchez, who had cast his lot\r\nwith Porras. The doughty Ledesma, also a rebel, though badly wounded,\r\nlived to be assassinated in Spain. Porras and several others were\r\ntaken prisoners and confined on board the wreck. The remainder of the\r\ndeserters then returned, penitent. Finally the admiral's agent at Santo\r\nDomingo, Diego de Salcedo, came to his relief with two ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF THE ADMIRAL.]\r\n\r\nIt was infamous in Ovando to leave Columbus so long in such a strait.\r\nThe excuses he pleaded were absence at Jaraguá, and lack of suitable\r\nships; but had he been in earnest to deliver the admiral, means could\r\nhave been found before the lapse of a year. Although on arriving at\r\nSanto Domingo Columbus received lodgings in Ovando's house, and the\r\ngovernor was outwardly exceedingly attentive to his guest, in reality\r\nthere was little in common between the two men but jealousy and\r\ndistrust. Porras was allowed to roam at large, though finally sent to\r\nSpain for trial. Columbus sailed for Spain September 12, 1504. For\r\na time he kept his bed at Seville, writing heart-rending letters to\r\nthe sovereigns, who paid little attention to them. By the help of the\r\nadelantado, ever his most faithful friend and brother, Columbus managed\r\nthe following year to creep up to court and beg redress from the king,\r\nfor the queen was now dead. But Ferdinand was deeply disgusted; not so\r\nmuch however as to prevent his granting the illustrious discoverer a\r\nmagnificent burial shortly after. It was the 20th of May, 1506, that\r\nColumbus died at Valladolid, at the age of about seventy years.[IV-25]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus terminated the first attempt of Spaniards to plant a colony on the\r\nmain-land of North America. Columbus himself, the leader, advanced with\r\nproffers of friendship in one hand and a sword in the other, retaliated\r\nupon a fancied savage treachery by a still more insidious treachery,\r\nand was driven from the country by a brave ruler, whose deeds deserve\r\nto be enrolled beside those of patriots everywhere. One kind act of a\r\ntender-hearted Spanish sailor—would I had more of them to record in this\r\nhistory—brings the direst misfortune on his countrymen, delays for a\r\ndozen years the occupation of Veragua, and turns the tide of conquest\r\nin other directions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nMost remarkable in the character of Columbus was the combination of\r\nthe theoretical and the practical; and most remarkable in his theories\r\nwas the anomaly that though nearly all of them were false, they led\r\nto as grand results as if they had been true. The aperture through\r\nwhich failure creeps into carefully laid schemes is usually some\r\nglaring defect of character; and such defect often appears where little\r\nsuspected, in natures warped by genius, or where one quality is unduly\r\ndeveloped at the expense of another quality. We often see men of rare\r\nability wrecked by what would be regarded an act of folly unaccountable\r\nin the stupidest person; but we do not often see success resulting from\r\nthese same defects. The greatest defect in the faculties of Columbus,\r\nextravagance of belief, was the primary cause of his success. Simple to\r\nus as is the reality of the earth's rotundity, and of the practicability\r\nof a western route to Asia, no one could then have entertained those\r\ndoctrines without extraordinary credulity; even though Pythagoras and\r\nothers had so long ago expressed such ideas, no one could then have\r\nacted on them short of infatuation bordering on insanity. To say the\r\nworld is round was not enough; Thales of Miletus proved it not a plane\r\ntwo thousand years before. If it were round, the water would run off;\r\nif it were flat, why then one safely might sail on it; if it be flat,\r\nand the water runs not off, then at the other end there must be land\r\nthat keeps the water on, and one might sail over the flat sea to that\r\nland—all such logic was less puerile than the feelings by which the\r\nGenoese ordinarily reached conclusions. His efforts were the embodiment\r\nof the ideas of many thoughtful men, timorous persons, perhaps, or\r\nmerely meditative and passive, but in none of whom united his ability,\r\ncourage, and enthusiasm; above all, none so scientific were at the\r\nsame time so determined. Often the knowledge of a prophecy is the\r\ncause of its fulfilment. Some say Alonso Sanchez told him of Española,\r\nand he himself affirms that once he visited Iceland. It may have been\r\nthat on this voyage he learned from the Norsemen of their Vinland and\r\nHelluland. What then? Were this true, such stories would have had with\r\nhim scarcely greater weight than the sayings of the ancients, or than\r\ncurrent interpretations of holy writ.\r\n\r\nNothing more plainly proves the power that sent him forth than the fact\r\nthat in scarcely one of his original conceptions was he correct. He\r\nthought to reach Asia over an unobstructed ocean sea by sailing west; he\r\ndid not. To the day of his death he thought America was Asia, and that\r\nCuba was mainland; that the earth was much smaller than it is, and that\r\nsix sevenths of it was land. He dwelt much on a society of Amazons who\r\nnever had existence, and at every step among the Islands he ingenuously\r\nallowed his inflamed imagination to deceive him. He claimed to have\r\nbeen divinely appointed for this mission; he affirmed his voyage a\r\nmiracle, and himself inspired with the conception of it by the most holy\r\nTrinity; he vowed to rescue the holy sepulchre, which he never did; he\r\nproclaimed visions which he never saw, such as St Elmo at the top-mast\r\nwith seven lighted tapers, and told of voices which he never heard; he\r\npictured himself a missionary to benighted heathen, when in truth he was\r\nscattering among them legions of fiery devils. But what he knew and did,\r\nassuredly, was enough, opening the ocean to highways, and finding new\r\ncontinents; enough to fully entitle him to all the glory man can give to\r\nman; and as for his errors of judgment, had he been able to map America\r\nas accurately as can we to-day, had he been divine instead of, as he\r\nclaimed, only divinely appointed, with myriads of attendant ministers,\r\nhis achievement would have been none the greater. From the infirmities\r\nof his nature sprang the nobility of Brutus; from the weaknesses of\r\nColumbus was compounded his strength.\r\n\r\nAssuredly it was no part of the experience and ingenuity which\r\nsprings from life-long application that made Columbus so essentially\r\na visionary; nor was it his scientific attainments, nor the splendid\r\nsuccesses which despite the so frequent frowns of fortune we must\r\naccredit him. In his avocation of mariner he was a plain, thoughtful\r\nman of sound judgment and wise discretion; but fired by enthusiasm he\r\nbecame more than an ordinary navigator; he became more as he fancied\r\nhimself, superhuman, the very arm of omnipotence. Once born in him\r\nthe infatuation that he was the divinely appointed instrument for the\r\naccomplishment of this work, and frowning monarchs or perilous seas were\r\nas straws in his way. We see clearly enough what moved him, these four\r\nhundred years after the event, though he who was moved in reality knew\r\nlittle about it. By the pressure of rapidly accumulating ideas we see\r\nbrought to the front in discovery Christopher Columbus, just as in the\r\nreformation of the church Martin Luther is crowded to the front. The\r\nGerman monk was not the Reformation; like the Genoese sailor, he was\r\nbut an instrument in the hands of a power palpable to all, but called\r\nby different persons different names.\r\n\r\nWhile yet mingling in the excitements of progressive manhood, he\r\nbecame lost in a maze of mysticism, and to the end of his life he\r\nnever recovered possession of himself. Not that self-mastery, the first\r\nnecessity of correct conduct, was wholly gone; there was method in his\r\nmadness; and he could deny the demons within him, but it was only to\r\nleave open the door and give himself up to yet other demons.\r\n\r\nIn the centuries of battle now lately renewed between science and\r\nreligion, Columbus fought on both sides. Never was a man more filled\r\nat once with the material and the spiritual, with the emotional and the\r\nintellectual. Mingling with beatified spirits in the garden of his moral\r\nparadise were naked wild men equally as glorious in their immoralities.\r\nHis creed, which was his very life, was not in his eyes a bundle of\r\nsupernatural abstractions, but concrete reality as much as were any\r\nof his temporal affairs. Himself an honest devotee of science, and\r\nbelieving science the offspring of religion, science and himself must\r\ntherefore finally be forever laid upon the same altar. He had no thought\r\nof work apart from religion, or of religion apart from work. He had\r\nready a doctrine for every heavenly display, a theory for every earthly\r\nphenomenon. When pictures of other lands rose in his imagination, he\r\nknew them to be real, just as Juan Diego of Mexico knew to be real the\r\napparition of our Lady of Guadalupe at Tepeyacac. By the gnawing hunger\r\nof temporal and spiritual ambition he was enabled to see the new lands\r\nsuggested by science, just as the imprisoned monk, starved and scourged\r\ninto the beholdings of insanity, sees angels of every incarnation.\r\n\r\nWhile thus obliged to view all his achievements through the atmosphere\r\nof creative mysticism, in weighing his manifold qualities, it is well\r\nalways to remember that there were achievements, and those of the very\r\nhighest order. His mysticism was the mysticism of practical life rather\r\nthan of inactive ideality. His faith was of value to him in giving\r\ndefiniteness to energy otherwise vague and fitful. His all-potential\r\nenthusiasm subordinated to one idea every erratic and incoherent\r\naspiration. It gave his life a fixedness of purpose which lust, avarice,\r\nand every appetite combined could not have given without it; so that\r\nwhile he brooded with misanthropic wistfulness he did not shirk any\r\nfancied duty, even when attended by pain and misfortune. His was not\r\na cloistered inspiration, but an overwhelmingly active enthusiasm.\r\nThere was in him no longing after a perfect life; in his own eyes his\r\nlife was perfect. No restless questionings over the unknowable; there\r\nwas no unknowable. His oblique imagination encompassed all worlds and\r\npenetrated all space. His positivism bound the metaphysical no less\r\nfirmly than the material. Abstract conceptions were more tangible\r\nthan concrete facts. Realities were but accidents; ideas were the\r\nonly true realities. The highway of the heavens which to profoundest\r\ninvestigation is dusty with the débris of an evolving universe, to this\r\nself-sufficient sailor was as plain as the king's road from Seville to\r\nCádiz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANOMALIES AND ABERRATIONS.]\r\n\r\nAnd as genius grows with experience, so grew his determination with the\r\nerrors he so frequently fell into. He was not a happy man, nor was he\r\nalways a pleasant companion. In his delusions he was self-satisfied;\r\nin the loss of himself self-possessed. He endeavored to be prudent and\r\nthought himself worldly wise; but, like many self-flatterers wrapped in\r\ntheir own fancies he was easily imposed upon, even by the sovereigns,\r\nwith whom he aimed to be exceedingly shrewd. His contact with man did\r\nnot deepen his humanity, but seemed rather to harden his heart, and\r\ndrive his affections all the more from earth to heaven. His mind was of\r\nthat gloomy cast which made even his successes sorrowful. We have seen\r\namong his practical virtues integrity of a high conventional order,\r\nsingle-mindedness, courage, and indomitable perseverance; and in other\r\ncharacteristics which were not so pleasing—pride displaying itself, as\r\nit often does, in religious humility; a melancholy temper; a selfish\r\nambition, which with one grasp would secure to himself and his family\r\nthe uttermost that man and God could give; with all his devout piety\r\nand heavenly zeal a painful and often ludicrous tenacity in clutching\r\nat high-sounding titles and hollow honors—there were even in the most\r\nunlovable parts of him something to respect, and in his selfishness a\r\nself-sacrificing nobleness, a lofty abandonment of self to the idea,\r\nwhich we can but admire. It was not for himself, although it was always\r\nmost zealously and jealously for himself; the ships, the new lands, the\r\nnew peoples, his fortunes and his life, all were consecrate; should the\r\nadventure prove successful, the gain would be heaven's; if a failure,\r\nthe loss would fall on him. Surely the Almighty must smile on terms so\r\nfavorable to himself. And that he did not finally make good his promises\r\nwith regard to rescuing the holy sepulchre, and building temples, and\r\nconverting nations, was for the same reason that he did not finally\r\nsatisfy his worldly pretensions, and secure himself in his rulership. He\r\nhad not the time. In all his worldly and heavenly ambitions, the glory\r\nof God and the glory of himself were blended with the happy consummation\r\nof his grand idea. And never did morbid broodings over the unsubstantial\r\nand shadowless produce grander results than these incubations of\r\nalternate exaltation and despondency that hatched a continent. And in\r\nall that was then transpiring, there are few intelligent readers of\r\nhistory who cannot see an overshadowing, all-controlling destiny shaping\r\nevents throughout the world, so that this then unknown continent should\r\nbe prepared to fill the grand purpose which even then appeared to be\r\nmarked out for it.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, in the study of this remarkable character, whose\r\ndescription is but a succession of paradoxes, we see everywhere\r\nfalsehood leading up to truth and truth to falsehood; while we see\r\nspring out of the ideal the real, results the most substantial and\r\nsuccess the most signal come from conceptions the most fantastical,\r\nwe can but observe, not only that penetrative vision which in the\r\nmind of genius sees through the symbol the divine significance, but\r\nthat they have not been always or altogether fruitless of good, those\r\nspectral fancies which riot in absurdities, building celestial cities,\r\nand peopling pandemoniums, even in the absence of genius, symbol, or\r\nsignificance.[IV-26]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIBLIOGRAPHY.]\r\n\r\nProbably not one of the many accounts of Columbus which have been\r\npublished is presented with such fulness of detail, commanding vivid\r\ninterest from first to last, as that of Mr Washington Irving, _The Life\r\nand Voyages of Christopher Columbus; to which are added those of His\r\nCompanions_, 3 vols., New York, 1869. The first editions, one in London,\r\nin 4 vols., and one in New York, appeared in 1828; since which time\r\nthere have been many issues, in English and other languages. The author\r\nwas born in New York, in 1783, and died at Sunnyside, near Tarrytown, on\r\nthe Hudson River, in 1859. A strong literary taste was early displayed,\r\nspecially manifested in 1802 in a series of articles contributed to the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_. In 1804 he visited Europe for his health, returning\r\nin 1807. Then appeared the serial _Salmagundi_, and in 1809 _A History\r\nof New York_. Again in 1815 he went to Europe, and after engaging for\r\na time in mercantile pursuits, abandoned them and gave himself up to\r\nletters. The publication of the _Sketch Book_ was begun in numbers in\r\n1818, and was followed by _Bracebridge Hall_ in 1822, and _Tales of\r\na Traveller_ in 1824. Then came _Columbus_, the material for which he\r\nobtained from Navarrete in Spain. See chapter iii. note 9, this volume.\r\nAfter serving as secretary of the American Legation in London from 1829\r\nto 1832, he returned to New York and published _The Alhambra_; then\r\n_Crayon Miscellany_ in 1835; _Astoria_ in 1836; _Captain Bonneville_ in\r\n1837; and _Wolfert's Roost_ in 1855. From 1842 to 1846 he was American\r\nMinister to Spain. His later works were _Goldsmith_, 1849; _Mahomet_,\r\n1850; and _Washington_, 1855-9. Mr Irving has been most praised for\r\nhis genial manner, his gentleness of thought, and his charming style,\r\nwhich carries the reader almost unconsciously along over details in\r\nother hands dry and profitless. Among these is found his highest merit;\r\nand yet one would sometimes wish the author not quite so meritorious.\r\nElegance and grace eternal tire by their very faultlessness. In handling\r\nthe rough realities of life one relishes now and then a rough thought\r\nroughly expressed. Neither is Irving remarkable for historical accuracy,\r\nor exact thinking. An early criticism on _Columbus_ complains of that\r\nwithout which the works of Irving never would have attained great\r\npopularity. He was pronounced too wordy, his details too long drawn. If\r\nthis was the case fifty years ago, it is much more so now. And yet how\r\nfascinating is every page! And who but Irving could make thrilling such\r\ntrivial events? Permit him the use of words, and howsoever isolated the\r\nideas, or commonplace the events, the result was brilliant; but force\r\nhim within narrow compass, not only would the charm be lost, but the\r\nwork would be almost worthless.\r\n\r\nThe highest delight of a healthy mind, of a mind not diseased either by\r\neducation or affection, is in receiving the truth. The greatest charm\r\nin expression, to a writer who may properly be placed in the category\r\nof healthful, is in telling the truth. It is only when truth is dearer\r\nto us than tradition, or pride of opinion, that we are ready to learn;\r\nit is only when truth is dearer to us than praise or profit that we are\r\nfit to teach. If the mind be intelligent as well as healthy, it knows\r\nitself to be composed of truth and prejudice, the latter engendered of\r\nignorance and environment, holding it in iron fetters, and with which\r\nit knows it must forever struggle in vain wholly to be free. Thus keenly\r\nalive as well to the difficulties as to the importance of right thinking\r\nand exact forms of expression, it nevertheless has its keenest pleasure\r\nin striving toward concrete truth. It is truthfulness to nature in all\r\nher beauties and deformities, rather than the construction of some more\r\nbeautiful than natural ideal, that alone satisfies art, whether in the\r\ndomain of painting, oratory, or literature. We of to-day, while holding\r\nin high esteem works of the imagination, are becoming somewhat captious\r\nin regard to our facts. The age is essentially informal and real; even\r\nour ideal literature must be rigidly true to nature, while whatever\r\npretends to be real must be presented in all simplicity, without\r\ncircumlocution or disguisement.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago it was deemed necessary, particularly by writers\r\nof selected epochs of history, in order to clothe their narrative with\r\ndramatic effect equal to fiction, to intensify characters and events.\r\nThe good qualities of good men were made to stand out in bold relief,\r\nnot against their own bad qualities, but against the bad qualities\r\nof bad men, whose wickedness was portrayed in such black colors as to\r\novershadow whatever of good they might possess. Thus historical episodes\r\nwere endowed, so far as possible without too great discoloration of\r\ntruth, like a theatrical performance, each with a perfected hero and a\r\nfinished villain. Of this class of writers were Macaulay and Motley,\r\nFroude, Freeman, Prescott, and Irving, whose works are wonderful in\r\ntheir way, not only as art-creations, but as the truest as well as\r\nmost vivid pictures of their several periods yet presented, and which\r\nfor generations will be read with that deep and wholesome interest\r\nwith which they deserve to be regarded. For, although their facts are\r\nsometimes highly varnished, their most brilliant creations are always\r\nbuilt upon a substantial skeleton of truth. I say that these, the\r\nforemost writers of their day, are none of them free from the habit\r\nof exaggeration, deception. Indeed, with a wasteful extravagance in\r\nthe use of superlatives it is almost impossible to draw character\r\nstrongly without in some parts of it exaggerating. But in these days of\r\nrational reflection wherein romance and reality are fairly separated,\r\ncelestial fiction and mundane fact being made to pass under the same\r\n_experimentum crucis_; mind becoming so mechanical that it introverts\r\nand analyzes not only its own mechanism but the mechanism of its maker;\r\niconoclasm becoming spiritualized, and the doctrine revived of the old\r\nAdamic serpent, that the knowledge of good and evil is not death but\r\nlife and immortality, this knowledge being king of kings, vying with\r\nnature's forces and oftentimes defying them—I say, in days like these\r\nmature manhood becomes impatient of the Santa Claus, or other fictitious\r\nimagery, from which the infant mind derives much comfort, and prefers,\r\nif necessary, the torments of truth to the elysium of fable. It is no\r\nlonger valid logic that if the hero stoops to trickery, his biographer\r\nshould stoop to trickery to cover it. For once undertake to shape the\r\nstiff clay of material facts into the artistic forms of fiction, and\r\nthe result is neither history nor romance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WASHINGTON IRVING.]\r\n\r\nProud as I am of the names of Prescott and Irving, at whose shrines none\r\nworship with profounder admiration than myself; thankless as may be the\r\ntask of criticising their classic pages, whose very defects shine with a\r\nsteadier lustre than I dare hope for my brightest consummations; still,\r\nforced by my subject, in some instances, into fields partially traversed\r\nby them, I can neither pass them by nor wholly praise them. In justice\r\nto my theme, in justice to myself, in justice to the age in which I\r\nlive, I must speak, and that according to the light and the perceptions\r\ngiven me.\r\n\r\nMr Irving's estimate of the value of honesty and integrity in a\r\nhistorian may be gathered from his own pages. \"There is a certain\r\nmeddlesome spirit,\" he writes, \"which, in the garb of learned research,\r\ngoes prying about the traces of history, casting down its monuments,\r\nand marring and mutilating its fairest trophies. Care should be taken\r\nto vindicate great names from such pernicious erudition. It defeats one\r\nof the most salutary purposes of history, that of furnishing examples\r\nof what human genius and laudable enterprise may accomplish.\" Now, if\r\nconscientious inquiry into facts signifies a meddlesome spirit; if the\r\nplain presentment of facts may rightly be called pernicious erudition;\r\nif the overthrow of fascinating falsehood is mutilating the trophies\r\nof history; if fashioning golden calves for the worship of the simple\r\nbe the most salutary purpose of history; then I, for one, prefer\r\nthe meddlesome spirit and the pernicious erudition which mutilates\r\nsuch monuments to the fairest trophies of historical deception.\r\nAgain—\"Herrera has been accused also of flattering his nation;\r\nexalting the deeds of his countrymen, and softening and concealing\r\ntheir excesses. There is nothing very serious in this accusation. To\r\nillustrate the glory of his nation is one of the noblest offices of the\r\nhistorian; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the extraordinary\r\nenterprises and splendid actions of the Spaniards in those days. In\r\nsoftening their excesses he fell into an amiable and pardonable error,\r\nif it were indeed an error for a Spanish writer to endeavor to sink them\r\nin oblivion.\" When a writer openly avows his allegiance to falsehood,\r\nto amiable falsehood, to falsehood perpetrated to deceive in regard\r\nto one's own country, about which one professes to know more than a\r\nstranger, nothing remains to be said. Nothing remains to be said as to\r\nthe veracity of that author, but much remains to be said concerning the\r\nerroneous impressions left by him of the persons and events coming in\r\nthe way of this work.\r\n\r\nWith what exquisite grace, with what tender solicitude and motherly\r\nblindness to faults Mr Irving defends the reputation of Columbus!\r\nIs the Genoese a pirate, then is piracy \"almost legalized;\" is he a\r\nslave-maker, \"the customs of the times\" are pleaded; without censure\r\nhe lives at Córdova in open adultery with Beatriz Enriquez, and there\r\nbecomes the father of the illegitimate Fernando; a bungling attempt\r\nis made to excuse the hero for depriving the poor sailor of the prize\r\noffered him who should first see land; Oviedo is charged with falsehood\r\nbecause he sometimes decides against the discoverer in issues of\r\npolicy and character; Father Buil was \"as turbulent as he was crafty\"\r\nbecause he disagreed with the admiral in some of his measures; the most\r\nextravagant vituperation is hurled at Aguado because he is chosen to\r\nexamine and report on the affairs of the Indies; Fonseca is denounced\r\nas inexpressibly vile because he thwarts some of the discoverer's\r\nhare-brained projects; and so with regard to those who in any wise\r\nopposed him, while all who smiled on him were angels of light. All\r\nthrough his later life when extravagant requests were met by more\r\nthan the usual liberality of royalty, Irving is petulantly complaining\r\nbecause more is not done for his hero, and because his petulant hero\r\ncomplains. And this puerile pride from which springs such petulance the\r\neloquent biographer coins into the noble ambition of conscious merit.\r\nThough according to his own statement the madness of the man increased\r\nuntil toward the latter end he was little better than imbecile, yet we\r\nare at the same time gravely assured that \"his temper was naturally\r\nirritable, but he subdued it by the magnanimity of his spirit.\" The\r\nson Fernando denies that his father once carded wool; Irving does not\r\nattempt to excuse this blemish because his readers do not regard work\r\nignoble.\r\n\r\nNow it is not the toning-down of defects in a good man's character\r\nthat I object to so much as the predetermined exaltation of one\r\nhistorical personage at the expense of others utterly debased under like\r\npremeditation. Did Mr Irving, and the several scores of biographers\r\npreceding and following him, parade the good qualities of Bobadilla,\r\nRoldan, and Ovando as heartily as those of their hero, the world would\r\nbe puzzled what to make of it. We are not accustomed to such statements.\r\nUnseasoned biography is tasteless, and we are taught not to expect\r\ntruth, but a model. We should not know what these writers were trying\r\nto do if they catalogued the misdemeanors of Columbus and his brothers\r\nwith the same embellishments applied to Aguado, Buil, and Fonseca;\r\ntelling with pathetic exaggeration how the benign admiral of the ocean\r\nsea was the first to employ bloodhounds against the naked natives; how\r\nhe practised varied cruelties in Española beyond expression barbarous;\r\nand how he stooped upon occasion not only to vulgar trickery, but to\r\nbase treachery.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with those who seek notoriety by attempting to\r\ndegrade the fair fame of noble and successful genius because more credit\r\nmay have been given by some than is justly due, or by affecting to\r\ndisbelieve whole narratives and whole histories because portions of them\r\nare untrue or too highly colored, I have no sympathy. Books have been\r\nwritten to prove, what no one denies, that centuries before Columbus\r\nother Europeans had found this continent, and that thereby the honor\r\nof his achievement is lessened—of which sentiment I fail to see the\r\nforce. So far as the Genoese, his works, and merits are concerned, it\r\nmakes no whit difference were America twenty times before discovered,\r\nas elsewhere in this volume has been fully shown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IRVING AND PRESCOTT COMPARED.]\r\n\r\nPrescott was a more exact writer than Irving, though Prescott was not\r\nwholly above the amiable weakness of his time. In the main he stated\r\nthe truth, and stated it fairly, though he did not always tell the whole\r\ntruth. The faults of his heroes he would speak, though never so softly;\r\nhe seldom attempted entirely to conceal them. He might exaggerate, but\r\nhe neither habitually practised nor openly defended mendacity. Prescott\r\nwould fain please the Catholics, if it did not cost too much. Irving\r\nwould please everybody, particularly Americans; but most of all he would\r\nmake a pleasing tale; if truthful, well; if not, it must on no account\r\nrun counter to popular prejudice. The inimitable charm about them both\r\namply atones in the minds of many for any imperfections. Since their\r\nday much new light has been thrown upon the subjects treated by them,\r\nbut not enough seriously to impair the value of their works. In their\r\nestimates of the characters of Ferdinand and Isabella, relatively and\r\nrespectively, these brilliant writers are not alone. They copied those\r\nwho wrote before them; and those who came after copied them. It has been\r\nthe fashion these many years, both by native and foreign historians,\r\nto curse Ferdinand and to bless Isabella, to heap all the odium of the\r\nnation and the times upon the man and exalt the woman among the stars.\r\nThis, surely, is the more pleasant and chivalrous method of disposing\r\nof the matter; but in that case I must confess myself at a loss what to\r\ndo with the facts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.]\r\n\r\nNone but the simple are deceived by the gentle Irving when he insinuates\r\n\"she is even somewhat bigoted;\" by which expression he would have us\r\nunderstand that the fascinating queen of Castile was but little of a\r\nbigot. Again: \"Ferdinand was a religious bigot; and the devotion of\r\nIsabella went as near to bigotry as her liberal mind and magnanimous\r\nspirit would permit\"—that is to say, as the plan of Mr Irving's story\r\nwould permit. Quite as well as any of us Irving knew that Isabella was\r\none of the most bigoted women of her bigoted age, far more bigoted than\r\nFerdinand, who dared even dispute the pope when his Holiness interfered\r\ntoo far in attempting to thwart his ambitious plans. She was, indeed,\r\nso deeply dyed a bigot as to allow her ghostly confessor to overawe her\r\nfinest womanly instincts, her commonly strict sense of honor, justice,\r\nand humanity, and cause her to permit in Spain the horrible Inquisition,\r\nthe most monstrous mechanism of torture ever invented in aid of the most\r\nmonstrous crime ever perpetrated by man upon his fellows, the coercion\r\nand suppression of opinion. Fair as she was in all her ways, and\r\ncharming—fair of heart and mind and complexion, with regular features,\r\nlight chestnut hair, mild blue eyes, a modest and gracious demeanor—she\r\ndid not scruple, for the extermination of heresy, to apply to such\r\nof her loving subjects as dared think for themselves the thumb-screw,\r\nthe ring-bolt and pulley, the rack, the rolling-bench, the punch, the\r\nskewer, the pincers, the knotted whip, the sharp-toothed iron collar,\r\nchains, balls, and manacles, confiscation of property and burning at\r\nthe stake; and all under false accusations and distorted evidence. She\r\ndid not hesitate to seize and put to death hundreds of wealthy men like\r\nPecho, and appropriate to her own use their money, though her exquisite\r\nwomanly sensibilities might sometimes prompt her to fling to the widows\r\nand children whom she had turned beggars into the street a few crumbs\r\nof their former riches. This mother, who nursed children of her own\r\nand who should not have been wholly ignorant of a mother's love, turned\r\na deaf ear to the cries of Moorish mothers as they and their children\r\nwere torn asunder and sold at the slave mart in Seville. Thousands of\r\ninnocent men, women, and children she cruelly imprisoned, thousands she\r\ncast into the fiery furnace, tens of thousands she robbed and then drove\r\ninto exile; but it was chastely done, and by a most sweet and beautiful\r\nlady. We can hardly believe it true, we do not like to believe it true,\r\nthat when old Rabbi Abarbanel pleaded before the king for his people,\r\n\"I will pay for their ransom six hundred thousand crowns of gold,\"\r\nIsabella's soft, musical voice was heard to say, \"Do not take it,\" her\r\nconfessor meanwhile exclaiming \"What! Judas-like, sell Jesus!\" Besides,\r\nthrice six hundred thousand crowns might be secured by not accepting\r\nthe ransom. And yet this was the bright being, and such her acts by\r\nPrescott's own statements, cover them as he will never so artfully,\r\nwhose practical wisdom, he assures us, was \"founded on the purest and\r\nmost exalted principle,\" and whose \"honest soul abhorred anything like\r\nartifice.\" Isabella was unquestionably a woman of good intentions; but\r\nwith such substance the soul-burner's pit is paved.\r\n\r\nPrescott throws all the odium of the Inquisition on Torquemada, and\r\nI concur. The monk's mind was the ashy, unmelting mould in which\r\nthe woman's more plastic affections were cast. But then he should be\r\naccredited with some portion of the virtues that adorned the character\r\nof Isabella, for he was the author of many of them. To be just, if\r\nIsabella is accredited with her virtues, she must be charged with her\r\ncrimes. And if the queen may throw from her shoulders upon those of her\r\nadvisers the responsibility of iniquity permitted under her rule, why\r\nnot King Ferdinand, who likewise had men about him urging him to this\r\npolicy and to that? True, we excuse much in woman as the weaker, and\r\nvery justly so, which we condemn in the man of powerful cunning. But\r\nIsabella was not exactly clay in the hands of those about her; or if\r\nso, then praise her for her imbecility, and not for any virtue. But she\r\ncould muster will and spirit enough of her own upon occasion—witness\r\nher threat to kill Pedro Giron with her own hand rather than marry\r\nhim, and the policy which speaks plainly her sagacity and state-craft\r\nin the selection of Ferdinand, and in the strict terms of her marriage\r\ncontract which excluded her husband from any sovereign rights in Castile\r\nor Leon. Most inconsistently, indeed, in reviewing the administration\r\nof Isabella, at the end of three volumes of unadulterated adulation\r\nPrescott gives his heroine firmness enough in all her ways; independence\r\nof thought and action sufficient to circumscribe the pretensions of\r\nher nobles; and she \"was equally vigilant in resisting ecclesiastical\r\nencroachment;\" \"she enforced the execution of her own plans, oftentimes\r\neven at great personal hazard, with a resolution surpassing that of her\r\nhusband.\" When, however, she signed the edict for the expulsion of the\r\nJews, the excuse was that \"she had been early schooled to distrust her\r\nown reason.\" But why multiply quotations? The _Ferdinand and Isabella_\r\nof Prescott is full of these flat contradictions.\r\n\r\nWe all know that when carried away by feeling women are more cruel\r\nthan men; so Isabella under the frenzy of her fanaticism was, if\r\npossible, more cruel than Ferdinand, whose passions were ballasted by\r\nhis ambitions. Her feelings were with her faith; and her faith was with\r\nsuch foul iniquity, such inhuman wrong as should cause her euphemistic\r\napologists to blush for resorting to the same species of subterfuge\r\nthat makes heroes of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin. Again, murder and\r\nrobbery for Christ's sake suits the devil quite as well as when done for\r\none's own sake. And here on earth, to plead in a court of justice good\r\nintentions in mitigation of evil acts nothing extenuates in the eyes of\r\nany righteous judge. Therefore there is little to choose between those\r\nof whom it may be said—Here is a man who perfidiously robs, tortures,\r\nand murders his fellow-beings by the hundred thousand in order to\r\nglorify himself, and extend and establish his dominions; and, Here is\r\na woman who perfidiously robs, tortures, and murders her fellow-beings\r\nby the hundred thousand in order to glorify herself, her priest, her\r\nreligion, and extend and establish the dominions of her deity. At the\r\nfarthest, and in the minds of the eloquent biographers themselves, the\r\nrelative refinement and nobility of the two characters must turn wholly\r\nupon one's conception of the relative refinement and nobility of earthly\r\nselfishness and heavenly selfishness.\r\n\r\nWhat can we say then, if we make any pretensions to fairness in\r\nportraying historical personages, in excuse for Isabella that cannot\r\nas rightfully be said in excuse for Ferdinand? For even he, whom\r\nsensational biographers array in such sooty blackness in order that the\r\nsatin robes of Isabella may shine with whiter lustre, has been called\r\nin Spain the wise and prudent, and in Italy the pious. Of course there\r\nwere differences in their dispositions and their ambitions, but not such\r\nwide ones as we have been told. He was a man, with a man's nature, cold,\r\ncoarse, stern, and artful; she a woman, with a woman's nature, warm,\r\nrefined, gentle, and artful. He was foxlike, she feline. Opposing craft\r\nwith craft, she jealously guarded what she deemed the interests of her\r\nsubjects, and earnestly sought by encouraging literature and art, and\r\nreforming the laws, to refine and elevate her realm. He did precisely\r\nthe same. In all the iniquities of his lovely consort Ferdinand lent a\r\nhelping hand; man could do nothing worse; and all the world agree that\r\nFerdinand was bad. And yet, in what was he worse than she? Both were\r\ntools of the times, incisive and remorseless. To the ecclesiastical\r\ntyranny of which they were victims they added civil tyranny which they\r\nimposed upon their subjects. Ferdinand was the greatest of Spain's\r\nsovereigns, far greater than Charles, whose fortune it was to reap\r\nwhere his grandfather had planted. It was Ferdinand who consolidated\r\nall the several sovereignties of the Peninsula, save Portugal, into one\r\npolitical body, weighty in the affairs of Europe. He was ambitious; and\r\nto accomplish his ends scrupled at nothing. There was no sin he dared\r\nnot commit, no wrong he dared not inflict, provided the proximate result\r\nshould accord with his desires. He was less bound by superstition than\r\nthe average of the age; he was thoughtful, powerful, princely. Both were\r\npersonages magnificent, glorious, who achieved much good and much evil,\r\nthe evil being as fully chargeable to the times, which placed princes\r\nabove promises and religion, above integrity and humanity, as to any\r\nspecial depravity innate in either of them. And what was the immediate\r\nresult of it; and what the more distant conclusion; and how much after\r\nall were Spaniards indebted to these rulers? First Spain enwrapped in\r\nsurpassing glories! Spain the mistress of the world, on whose dominions\r\nthe sun refuses to go down. Fortunate Ferdinand! Thrice amiable\r\nand virtuous Isabella! And next? Do we not see that these brilliant\r\nsuccesses, these gratified covetings are themselves the seeds of Spain's\r\nabasement? Infinitely better off were Spain to-day, I will not say had\r\nshe not driven out her Moors and Jews, but had she never known the New\r\nWorld. How much soever of honor Isabella may have brought upon herself\r\nby her speculations in partnership with the Genoese, for the self-same\r\nreason, resulting in the great blight of gold and general effeminacy\r\nthat followed, Spain's posterity might reasonably anathematize her\r\nmemory could they derive any comfort therefrom.\r\n\r\nIn regard to that much-lauded act of Isabella's in lending her\r\nassistance to Columbus when Ferdinand would not, there is this to be\r\nsaid. First, no special praise is due her for assisting the Genoese;\r\nand secondly, she never assisted him in the manner or to the extent\r\nrepresented. Santángel and the Pinzons were the real supporters of that\r\nfirst voyage. Isabella did not pawn her jewels; she did not sell her\r\nwardrobe, or empty her purse. But if she had, for what would it have\r\nbeen? It makes a pleasing story for children to call her patronage by\r\npretty names, to say that it was out of pity for the poor sailor, that\r\nit was an act of personal sacrifice for the public good, that it was\r\nfor charity's sake, or from benevolence, for the extension of knowledge\r\nor the vindication of some great principle—only it is a very stupid\r\nchild that does not know better. Clearly enough the object was great\r\nreturns from a small expenditure; great returns in gold, lands, honors,\r\nand proselytings—a species of commercial and political gambling more\r\nin accordance with the character as commonly sketched of the \"cold\r\nand crafty Ferdinand,\" whose measureless avarice and insatiable greed\r\nnot less than his subtle state-craft and kingly cunning would have\r\nprompted him to secure so great a prize at so small a cost, than with\r\nthe character of an unselfish, heavenly-minded woman. And were it not\r\nfor the danger of being regarded by the tender-minded as ungallant, I\r\nmight allude to the haggling which attended the bargain, and tell how\r\nthe queen at first refused to pay the sailor his price, and let him go,\r\nthen called him back and gave him what he first had asked, more like a\r\nJew than like even the grasping Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I feel it almost unnecessary to say that Columbus,\r\nIsabella, and all those bright examples of history whose conduct and\r\ninfluence in the main were on the side of humanity, justice, the useful,\r\nand the good, have my most profound admiration, my most intelligent\r\nrespect. All their faults I freely forgive, and praise them for what\r\nthey were, as among the noblest, the best, the most beneficial to their\r\nrace—though not always so, nor always intending it—of any who have come\r\nand gone before us. And I can hate Bobadilla, Roldan, and others of\r\ntheir sort, all historical embodiments of injustice, egotism, treachery,\r\nand beastly cruelty, with a godly hatred; but I hope never to be so\r\nblinded by the brightness of my subject as to be unable to see the\r\ntruth, and seeing it, fairly to report it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF THE INDIES.\r\n\r\n1492-1526.\r\n\r\n     COLUMBUS THE RIGHTFUL RULER—JUAN AGUADO—FRANCISCO DE\r\n     BOBADILLA—NICOLÁS DE OVANDO—SANTO DOMINGO THE CAPITAL OF THE\r\n     INDIES—EXTENSION OF ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT TO ADJACENT ISLANDS\r\n     AND MAIN-LAND—RESIDENCIAS—GOLD MINING AT ESPAÑOLA—RACE AND\r\n     CASTE IN GOVERNMENT—INDIAN AND NEGRO SLAVERY—CRUELTY TO THE\r\n     NATIVES—SPANISH SENTIMENTALISM—PACIFICATION, NOT CONQUEST—THE\r\n     SPANISH MONARCHS ALWAYS THE INDIAN'S FRIENDS—BAD TREATMENT\r\n     DUE TO DISTANCE AND EVIL-MINDED AGENTS—INFAMOUS DOINGS OF\r\n     OVANDO—REPARTIMIENTOS AND ENCOMIENDAS—THE SOVEREIGNS INTEND\r\n     THEM AS PROTECTION TO THE NATIVES—SETTLERS MAKE THEM THE\r\n     MEANS OF INDIAN ENSLAVEMENT—LAS CASAS APPEARS AND PROTESTS\r\n     AGAINST INHUMANITIES—THE DEFAULTING TREASURES—DIEGO COLON\r\n     SUPERSEDES OVANDO AS GOVERNOR—AND MAKES MATTERS WORSE—THE\r\n     JERONIMITE FATHERS SENT OUT—AUDIENCIAS—A SOVEREIGN TRIBUNAL\r\n     IS ESTABLISHED AT SANTO DOMINGO WHICH GRADUALLY ASSUMES ALL\r\n     THE FUNCTIONS OF AN AUDIENCIA, AND AS SUCH FINALLY GOVERNS THE\r\n     INDIES—LAS CASAS IN SPAIN—THE CONSEJO DE INDIAS, AND CASA DE\r\n     CONTRATACION—LEGISLATION FOR THE INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how it had been first of all agreed that Columbus should be\r\nsole ruler, under the crown, of such lands and seas as he might discover\r\nfor Spain. We have seen how, under that rule, disruption and rebellion\r\nfollowed at the heels of mismanagement, until the restless colonists\r\nmade Española an _angustiarum insula_ to the worthy admiral, and until\r\ntheir majesties thought they saw in it decent excuse for taking the\r\nreins from the Genoese, and supplanting him by agents of their own\r\nchoosing. The first of these agents was Juan Aguado, who was merely\r\na commissioner of inquiry. With him, it will be remembered, Columbus\r\nreturned to Spain after his second voyage, leaving his brother Bartolomé\r\nin command. The admiral was permitted to try again; but on reaching the\r\nseat of his government he was unable to quiet the disturbances which had\r\nincreased during his absence. Rebellion had almost reached the dignity\r\nof revolution, and stronger than the government were factions whose\r\nleaders openly defied the governor-general, viceroy, and admiral of the\r\nocean sea. That their Majesties were greatly grieved at this, I do not\r\nsay; or that they were displeased that the rebels, or revolutionists,\r\nof Española should refer their troubles to them. But this is certain,\r\nthat after another fair trial Columbus was obliged to give it up, and\r\nto see himself displaced by a person far worse than himself. Perhaps it\r\nis true that a knave was better for the office than an honest man.\r\n\r\nNot that Francisco de Bobadilla may be lawfully accused of dishonesty;\r\nthe sovereigns seemed competent to take care of themselves where their\r\nrevenue was concerned. And yet he was certainly influenced in his\r\nconduct by no sense of right or of humanity. He was a man of narrow\r\nmind, of ignoble instincts and mean prejudices. He was popular for a\r\ntime with the colonists because he was like them, and because he reduced\r\nthe royal share of the product of the mines from a third to an eleventh,\r\nand permitted the dissolute to idle their time and illtreat the natives;\r\nand because he released those whom the admiral had imprisoned, and\r\nenabled Columbus to pay his debts—for which last mentioned measure I\r\nhave no fault to find with him.\r\n\r\nIt was the 21st of March, 1499, that Bobadilla was authorized to proceed\r\nagainst offenders at Española, but he did not leave Spain until July,\r\n1500, reaching Santo Domingo the 23d of August. The enchaining of the\r\nillustrious discoverer by an infamous agent, and for no crime, excited\r\nuniversal disgust throughout Christendom; and yet their Majesties seemed\r\nin no haste to depose him; for it was not until the 3d of September,\r\n1501, in answer to the persistent remonstrances of Columbus, that a\r\nchange was made, and the government given to Nicolas de Ovando, who\r\nsailed from Spain the 13th of February following, and arrived at Santo\r\nDomingo the 15th of April, 1502; so that Bobadilla was in office on\r\nthe island over a year and a half, long enough to sow the seeds of much\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NICOLAS DE OVANDO.]\r\n\r\nOvando was a knight of the order of Alcántara, of neither massive mind\r\nnor commanding mien. But his firm and fluent speech lent strength to\r\nhis slight figure and fair complexion, and a courteous manner made\r\namends for a vanity which in him assumed the form of deep humility. He\r\nwas well known to their Majesties, having been one of the companions\r\nof Prince Juan, and it was thought would make a model governor. Ample\r\ninstructions, both written and verbal, were given him before sailing.\r\nThe natives should be converted, but their bodies should not be enslaved\r\nor inhumanly treated. They must pay tribute, and gather gold, but for\r\nthe latter they should be paid wages. There was to be a complete change\r\nof soldiers and officials at Española, that the new government might\r\nbegin untainted by the late disorders. Neither Jews nor Moors might go\r\nto the Indies, but negro slaves, born into the possession of Christians,\r\nwere to be permitted passage. For any loss resulting from Bobadilla's\r\nacts, full restitution must be made the admiral, and henceforth his\r\nrights of property must be respected. Columbus might always keep\r\nthere an agent to collect his dues, and he was to be treated with\r\nconsideration. The idle and profligate were to be returned to Spain.\r\nExcept the provinces given to Ojeda and Pinzon, Ovando's jurisdiction\r\nwas made to extend over all the Indies, that is to say, over all the\r\nNew World dominions of Spain, islands and firm land, with the capital\r\nat Santo Domingo, and subordinate or municipal governments in the more\r\nimportant localities. All mining licenses issued by Bobadilla were to\r\nbe revoked; of the gold thus far collected one third should be taken for\r\nthe crown, and of all thereafter gathered one half. Supplementing these\r\ninstructions with much paternal advice consisting of minor moralities\r\nand Machiavelisms, their Majesties bade their viceroy God speed and sent\r\nhim forth in a truly royal fashion.\r\n\r\nThere were no less than thirty ships and twenty-five hundred persons\r\ncomprising the expedition. Of the company were Alonso Maldonado,\r\nnewly appointed _alcalde mayor_,[V-1] and twelve Franciscans, with\r\na prelate, Antonio de Espinal. Las Casas was present; and Hernan\r\nCortés would have been there but for an illness which prevented him.\r\nThere were seventy-three respectable married women, who had come with\r\ntheir husbands and children, and who were to salt society at their\r\nseveral points of distribution. It was evident as the new governor\r\nentered his capital, elegantly attired, with a body-guard of sixty-two\r\nfoot-soldiers and ten horsemen, and a large and brilliant retinue,\r\nthat the colonization of the New World had now been assumed in earnest\r\nby the sovereigns of Spain. Nor was Ovando disposed to be dilatory in\r\nhis duty. He at once announced the _residencia_[V-2] of Bobadilla, and\r\nput Roldan, _ci-devant_ rebel, and later chief judge, under arrest. He\r\nbuilt in Española several towns to which arms and other privileges were\r\ngiven, founded a hospital, removed Santo Domingo to a more healthful\r\nsite on the other side of the river, and established a colony at Puerto\r\nde Plata, on the north side of Española, near Isabela.\r\n\r\nDistant eight leagues from Santo Domingo were the mines where the\r\ntwenty-five hundred thought immediately to enrich themselves. For\r\nseveral days after landing the road was alive with eager gold hunters\r\ndrawn from all classes of the community; cavalier, _hidalgo_,[V-3] and\r\nlaborer, priest and artisan, honest men and villains, whose cupidity\r\nhad been fired by the display of precious metal lately gathered, and\r\nwho were now hurrying forward with hard breath and anxious eyes under\r\ntheir bundle of necessities. But there was no happy fortune in store\r\nfor these new-comers. The story then new has been oft repeated since:\r\nexpecting to fill their sacks quickly and with ease, and finding that\r\na very little gold was to be obtained only by very great labor, they\r\nwere soon on their way back to the city, where many of them fell into\r\npoverty, half of them dying of fever.\r\n\r\nPoor fools! they did not know; their countrymen, those that were\r\nleft from former attempts, did not tell them, though Roldan's men,\r\nBobadilla's men knew well enough, and in truth the remnant of Ovando's\r\nmen were not slow to learn, that the wise man, the wise and villainous\r\nman from Spain, did not work or die for gold, or for anything else, when\r\nthere were savages that might be pricked to it by the sword.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT OF THE NATIVES.]\r\n\r\nDuring this earliest period of Spanish domination in America, under\r\nsuccessive viceroys and subordinate rulers, by far the most important\r\nmatter which arose for consideration or action was the treatment of the\r\naborigines. Most momentous to them it was, certainly, and of no small\r\nconsequence to Spain. Unfortunately, much damage was done before the\r\nsubject was fairly understood; and afterward, evils continued because\r\nbad men were always at hand ready to risk future punishment for present\r\nbenefits. Spain was so far away, and justice moved so slowly, if it\r\nmoved at all, that this risk was seldom of the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns of Spain now found themselves called upon to rule two\r\nraces in the New World, the white and the red. And it was not always\r\neasy to determine what should be done, what should be the relative\r\nattitude of one toward the other. As to the superiority of the white\r\nrace there was no question. And among white men, Spaniards were the\r\nnatural masters; and among Spaniards, Castilians possessed the first\r\nrights in the new lands the Genoese had found for them.\r\n\r\nAll was plain enough so far. It was natural and right that Spaniards\r\nshould be masters in America. Their claim was twofold; as discoverers,\r\nand as propagandists. But in just what category to place the red man\r\nwas a question almost as puzzling as to tell who he was, and whence he\r\ncame. Several times the question arose as to whether he had a soul, or\r\na semi-soul, and whether the liquid so freely let by the conquerors\r\nwas brute blood, or of as high proof as that which ran in Castilian\r\nveins. The savages were to be governed, of course; but how, as subjects\r\nor as slaves? Columbus was strongly in favor of Indian slavery. He had\r\nparticipated in the Portuguese slave-trade, and had found it profitable.\r\nSpaniards enslaved infidels, and why not heathens? Mahometans enslaved\r\nChristians, and Christians Mahometans. Likewise Christians enslaved\r\nChristians, white as well as black, though it began to be questioned in\r\nSpain whether it was quite proper to enslave white Christians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SLAVERY.]\r\n\r\nThe negro slave-trade was at this time comparatively a new thing. It was\r\none of the proximate results of fifteenth-century maritime discovery.\r\nThe Portuguese were foremost in it, organizing for the purpose a company\r\nat Lagos, and a factory at Arguin, about the middle of the century,\r\nPrince Henry receiving his fifth. Europe, however, offered no profitable\r\nfield for African slave labor, and but for the discovery of America the\r\ntraffic probably never would have assumed large proportions. Public\r\nsentiment was not in those days averse to slavery, particularly to\r\nthe enslavement of the children of Ham. And yet neither Isabella nor\r\nFerdinand was at all disposed, in regard to their New World possessions,\r\nto follow the example of Portugal on the coast of Africa. Though they\r\nhad scarcely made personal the application that the practice was one of\r\nthe chief causes of Rome's ruin, yet they seemed instinctively opposed\r\nto it in this instance. They did not want these creatures in Spain,\r\nthey had no use for them. In regard to the ancient custom of enslaving\r\nprisoners of war, particularly the detested and chronically hostile\r\nMoors, it was different. This New World had been given them for a higher\r\npurpose. Its natives were not the enemies of Spain; they were innocent\r\nof any offence against Spain. It was better, it was more glorious, there\r\nwas higher and surer reward in it, to Christianize than to enslave.\r\nThis the clergy constantly urged; so that in Spain the passion for\r\npropagandism was greater than the passion for enslaving.\r\n\r\nColumbus must have been aware of this when in 1495 he sent by Torres,\r\nwith the four ship-loads of Indian slaves, the apology to their\r\nMajesties that these were man-eating Caribs, monsters, the legitimate\r\nprey of slave-makers wherever found. Peradventure some of them might be\r\nmade Christians, who when they had learned Castilian could be sent back\r\nto serve as missionaries and interpreters to aid in delivering their\r\ncountrymen from the powers of darkness. This was plausible, and their\r\nMajesties seemed content; but when Columbus pressed the matter further,\r\nand requested that arrangements should be made for entering extensively\r\ninto the traffic, they hesitated. Meanwhile the Genoese launched\r\nboldly forth in the old way, not only making slaves of cannibals but\r\nof prisoners of war; and whenever slaves were needed, a pretence for\r\nwar was not long wanting. Thereupon, with another shipment, the admiral\r\ngrows jubilant, and swears by the holy Trinity that he can send to Spain\r\nas many slaves as can be sold, four thousand if necessary, and enters\r\nupon the details of capture, carriage, sale, and return cargoes of\r\ngoods, with all the enthusiasm of a sometime profitable experience in\r\nthe business. Further than this he permits enforced labor where there\r\nhad been failure to pay tribute, and finally gives to every one who\r\ncomes an Indian for a slave.\r\n\r\nThen the monarchs were angry. \"What authority from me has the admiral\r\nto give to any one my vassals!\" exclaimed the queen. All who had thus\r\nbeen stolen from home and country, among whom were pregnant women\r\nand babes newly born, were ordered returned. And from that moment the\r\nsovereigns of Spain were the friends of the Indians. Not Isabella alone\r\nbut Ferdinand, Charles, and Philip, and their successors for two hundred\r\nyears with scarcely an exceptional instance, stood manfully for the\r\nrights of the savages—always subordinate however to their own fancied\r\nrights—constantly and determinately interposing their royal authority\r\nbetween the persistent wrong-doing of their Spanish subjects, and their\r\ndefenceless subjects of the New World. Likewise the Catholic Church is\r\nentitled to the highest praise for her influence in the direction of\r\nhumanity, and for the unwearied efforts of her ministers in guarding\r\nfrom cruelty and injustice these poor creatures. Here and there in the\r\ncourse of this narrative we find a priest carried away by the spirit of\r\nproselytism commit acts of folly and unrighteousness; and men announcing\r\nas church measures proceedings which when known in the mother country\r\nreceived the prompt condemnation of the church. These men and measures\r\nI shall not be backward to condemn. But it is with no small degree of\r\npleasure that I record thus early in this history the noble attributes\r\nof the self-sacrificing Christian heroes who while preaching their faith\r\nto the savage endeavored to bridle as best they could the cupidity and\r\ncruelty of the Spanish adventurers who accompanied them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAWS RESPECTING THE ABORIGINES.]\r\n\r\nAfter the first invasions, in various quarters, aggressive warfare\r\non the natives, even on obdurate heathen nations, was prohibited. In\r\nthe extension of dominion that followed, the very word 'conquest' was\r\nforbidden to be employed, even though it were a conquest gained by\r\nfighting, and the milder term 'pacification' was substituted.[V-4]\r\nLikewise, after the first great land robberies had been committed, side\r\nby side with the minor seizures was in practice the regulation that\r\nenough of the ancient territory should be left each native community\r\nto support it comfortably in a fixed residence. The most that was\r\nrequired of the Indians was to abolish their ancient inhuman practices,\r\nput on the outward apparel of civilization, and as fast as possible\r\nadapt themselves to Christian customs, paying a light tax, in kind,\r\nnominally for protection and instruction. This doing, they were to be\r\nleft free and happy. Such were the wishes of crown and clergy; for which\r\nboth strove steadily though unsuccessfully until the object of their\r\nsolicitude crumbled into earth.[V-5]\r\n\r\nFor the soldier, the sailor, the cavalier, the vagabond, the governor,\r\nand all their subordinates and associates, all the New World rabble from\r\nviceroy to menial willed it otherwise, the New World clergy too often\r\nwinking assent. However omnipotent in Spain, there were some things in\r\nAmerica that the sovereigns and their confessors could not do. They\r\ncould not control the bad passions of their subjects when beyond the\r\nreach of rope and dungeon. That these evil proclivities were of home\r\nengendering, having for their sanction innumerable examples from church\r\nand state, statesmen and prelates would hardly admit, but it is in truth\r\na plausible excuse for the excesses committed. The fact is that for\r\nevery outrage by a subject in the far away Indies, there were ten, each\r\nof magnitude tenfold for evil, committed by the sovereigns in Spain; so\r\nthat it is by no means wonderful that the Spaniards determined here to\r\npractise a little sinfulness for their own gratification, even though\r\ntheir preceptors did oppose wickedness which by reason of their absence\r\nthey themselves could not enjoy.\r\n\r\nThough the monarchs protested earnestly, honestly, and at the length of\r\ncenturies, their subjects went their way and executed their will with\r\nthe natives. Were I to tell a tenth of the atrocities perpetrated by\r\nChristian civilization on the natives of America, I could tell nothing\r\nelse. The catalogue of European crime, Spanish, English, French, is as\r\nlong as it is revolting. Therefore, whenever I am forced to touch upon\r\nthis most distasteful subject, I shall be as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DASTARDLY DOINGS OF OVANDO.]\r\n\r\nPassing the crimes of Columbus and Bobadilla, the sins of the two being,\r\nfor biographical effect, usually placed upon the latter, let us look\r\nat the conduct of Ovando, who, as Spanish provincial rulers went in\r\nthose days, was an average man. He ruled with vigor; and as if to offset\r\nhis strict dealings with offending Spaniards, unoffending Indians were\r\ntreated with treachery and merciless brutality.\r\n\r\nRumor reaching him that Anacaona, queen of Jaraguá, meditated revolt,\r\nhe marched thither at the head of two hundred foot-soldiers and seventy\r\nhorsemen. The queen came out to meet him, and escorted him with music\r\nand dancing to the great banqueting-hall, and entertained him there for\r\nseveral days. Still assured by evil tongues that his hostess intended\r\ntreachery, he determined to forestall her. On a Sunday afternoon, while\r\na tilting-match was in progress, Ovando gave the signal. He raised his\r\nhand and touched his Alcántara cross—a badge of honor it was called,\r\nwhich, had it been real, should have shrivelled the hand that for such\r\na purpose touched it. On the instant Anacaona and her caciques were\r\nseized and a mock trial given them; after which the queen was hanged,\r\nthe caciques tortured and burned, and the people of the province, men,\r\nwomen, and children, ruthlessly and indiscriminately butchered. Those\r\nwho escaped the massacre were afterward enslaved. For intelligence,\r\ngrace, and beauty Anacaona was the Isabella of the Indies, and there was\r\nno valid proof that she meditated the slightest injury to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Saona and Higuey, in revenge for the death of a chief\r\ntorn in pieces by a Spanish bloodhound, rose to arms, and slew a boat's\r\ncrew of eight Spaniards. Juan de Esquivel with four hundred men was\r\nsent against them, and the usual indiscriminate hanging and burning\r\nfollowed. It is stated that over six hundred were slaughtered at one\r\ntime in one house. A peace was conquered, a fort built; fresh outrages\r\nprovoked a fresh outbreak; and the horrors of the extermination that\r\nfollowed Las Casas confessed himself unable to describe. A passion arose\r\nfor mutilation, and for prolonging agony by new inventions for refining\r\ncruelty. And the irony of Christianity was reached when thirteen men\r\nwere hanged side by side in honor of Christ and his apostles. Cotubano,\r\nthe last of the five native kings of Española, was taken to Santo\r\nDomingo, and hanged by order of Ovando. In Higuey were then formed two\r\nsettlements, Salvaleon and Santa Cruz. To take the places in the Spanish\r\nservice of the Indians thus slain in Española, forty thousand natives\r\nof the Lucayas Islands were enticed thither upon the pretext of the\r\ncaptors that they were the Indians' dead ancestors come from heaven to\r\ntake their loved ones back with them. Española was indeed their shortest\r\nway to heaven, though not the way they had been led to suppose. When\r\ntidings of Ovando's doings reached Spain, notably of his treatment of\r\nAnacaona, Queen Isabella was on her death-bed; but raising herself as\r\nbest she was able, she exclaimed to the president of the council, \"I\r\nwill have you take of him such a residencia as was never taken.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LABOR QUESTION.]\r\n\r\nBoth the Spaniards and the Indians, as we have seen, were averse to\r\nlabor. To both it was degrading; to the latter, killing. And yet it\r\nwas necessary that mines should be worked, lands cultivated, and cattle\r\nraised. Else of what avail was the New World?\r\n\r\nThe colonists clamored, and the crown was at a loss what to do. In her\r\ndilemma there is no wonder the queen appeared to equivocate; but when\r\nin December, 1503, she permitted Ovando to use force in bringing the\r\nnatives to a sense of their duty, though they must be paid fair wages\r\nand made to work \"as free persons, for so they are,\" she committed a\r\nfatal error. The least latitude was sure to be abused. Under royal\r\npermission of 1501 a few negro slaves from time to time were taken\r\nto the Indies. Las Casas urged the extension of this traffic in\r\norder to save the Indians. Ovando complained that the negroes fled\r\nand hid themselves among the natives, over whom they exercised an\r\nunwholesome influence; nevertheless in September, 1505, we find the\r\nking sending over more African slaves to work in the mines, this time\r\nabout one hundred. From 1517, when importations from the Portuguese\r\nestablishments on the Guinea coast were authorized by Charles V., the\r\ntraffic increased, and under the English, particularly, assumed enormous\r\nproportions. This unhappy confusion of races led to a negro insurrection\r\nat Española in 1522.\r\n\r\nWe come now to some of the results of the temporizing policy of\r\nSpain—always a bad one when the subject is beyond the reach of the\r\nruling arm—in regard to the Indians. For out of a desire to avoid the\r\nodium of Indian slavery, and yet secure the benefits thereof, grew\r\na system of servitude embodying all the worst features of absolute\r\nbondage, with none of its mitigations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REPARTIMIENTOS AND ENCOMIENDAS.]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during his second voyage Columbus made war\r\non the natives of Española, and after sending some as slaves to Spain,\r\nimposed a tribute on the rest; on some a bell-measure of gold, and\r\non others an _arroba_[V-6] of cotton, every three months. So severe\r\nwas this tax that many could not meet it, and in 1496 service was\r\naccepted in place of tribute. This was the beginning in the New World\r\nof the _repartimiento_,[V-7] or as it shortly afterward became the\r\n_encomienda_, system, under which the natives of a conquered country\r\nwere divided among the conquerors, recommended to their care, and made\r\ntributary to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADMINISTRATION OF THE INDIES.]\r\n\r\nThe theory was that the Indians were the vassals of Spain, no more to\r\nbe imposed upon than other Spanish subjects. The sovereigns wishing\r\nto stimulate discovery, pacification, and settlement, were willing to\r\nwaive their right to the tribute due the crown in favor of enterprising\r\nand meritorious persons, who had taken upon themselves the hardships\r\nincident to life in a new country. At first in certain instances, but\r\nlater to an extent which became general, they settled this tribute\r\nupon worthy individuals among the conquerors and colonists and their\r\ndescendants, on condition that those who thus directly received a\r\nportion of the royal revenue should act the part of royalty to the\r\npeople placed temporarily in their care. They were to be as a sovereign\r\nlord and father, and not as a merciless or unjust taskmaster. They\r\nwere to teach their wards the arts of civilization, instruct them in\r\nthe Christian doctrine, watch over and guide and guard them, and never\r\nto restrict them in the use of their liberties, nor impose burdens on\r\nthem, nor in any way to injure or permit injury to befall them. And\r\nfor this protection they were neither to demand nor receive more than\r\nthe legal tribute fixed by the royal officers, and always such as the\r\nnatives could without distress or discomfort pay. What the system was\r\nin practice we shall have ample opportunity of judging as we proceed\r\nin this history. Suffice it to say here that to the fatherly-protection\r\npart of their compact the colonists paid little heed, but evaded the law\r\nin many ways, and ground the poor savages under their iron heel, while\r\nthe crown by ordering, and threatening, earnestly but vainly sought to\r\ncarry out in good faith and humanity what they deemed a sacred trust.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PARTITION SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nFirst, repartimientos of lands were authorized by the sovereigns. This\r\nwas in 1497, and nothing was then said about the natives. But after\r\ndividing the land it was but a step to the dividing of the inhabitants.\r\nWith the shipment of six hundred slaves in 1498, and an offer to\r\ntheir Majesties of as many more as they could find sale for, Columbus\r\nwrote asking permission to enforce the services of the natives until\r\nsettlement should be fairly begun, say for a year or two; but without\r\nwaiting for a reply he at once began the practice, which introduced a\r\nnew feature into repartimientos. Then to all who chose to take them,\r\nto Roldan and his followers, to the worst characters on the island,\r\namong whom were the late occupants of Spanish prisons, the vilest of\r\nhumankind, was given absolute dominion over these helpless and innocent\r\ncreatures. Having paid nothing for them, having no pecuniary interest\r\nin them, they had no object in caring whether they were fed or starved,\r\nwhether they lived or died, for if they died there were more at hand\r\nupon the original terms.\r\n\r\nUnder Bobadilla the infamy assumed bolder proportions. Columbus had\r\napportioned to certain lands certain natives to labor for the benefit\r\nof Spaniards, but they worked under their cacique. Natives were forced\r\nby Spaniards to work mines, but only under special monthly license.\r\nBobadilla not only permitted the exaction from the natives of mining and\r\nfarming labor, but all restrictions were laid aside, and from working\r\ntheir own soil they became mere labor-gangs to be driven anywhere.\r\nBefore sailing for the New World Ovando had been charged by the\r\nsovereigns with the exercise of extreme moderation in levying tributes\r\nand making repartimientos. Those who came with him not only failed in\r\nmining, but neglected to plant, as did likewise the natives, thinking\r\nthereby the quicker to rid themselves of the invaders. Hence famine,\r\nengendering new diseases, was at hand for both white men and red. Then\r\nthe Indians were systematically parcelled among the Spaniards, to one\r\nfifty, to another one hundred, and the repartimiento unfolded into the\r\nencomienda. Columbus and Bobadilla had each endeavored to fasten Indian\r\nslavery upon the New World, but this legalizing by Ovando what had been\r\nillegally done by them, was the heaviest blow in that direction. \"To you\r\nis given an encomienda of Indians with their chief; and you are to teach\r\nthem the things of our holy Catholic faith,\" was the thin subterfuge by\r\nwhich this foul act was accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KING'S STRONG BOX.]\r\n\r\nIn 1508 was sent to Santo Domingo as treasurer-general Miguel de\r\nPasamonte to supersede Bernardino de Santa Clara, who had received the\r\noffice of treasurer from Ovando. Santa Clara loved display and lacked\r\nhonesty. Using freely the king's money he bought estates, and gave\r\nfeasts, in one of which the salt-cellars were filled with gold-dust.\r\nThis folly reaching the king's ears, Gil Gonzalez Dávila, of whom we\r\nshall know more presently, was sent to investigate the matter, and\r\nfound Santa Clara a defaulter to the extent of eighty thousand pesos\r\nde oro. His property was seized and offered at auction. Ovando, with\r\nwhom Santa Clara was a favorite, stood by at the sale, and holding up\r\na pineapple offered it to the most liberal bidder, which pleasantry\r\nwas so stimulating that the estate brought ninety-six thousand pesos\r\nde oro, more than twice its value. Afterward the plan was adopted of\r\nhaving three locks upon the government's strong-box, the keys to which\r\nwere carried by the three chief treasury officials.[V-8] Pasamonte\r\nwas an Aragonese, in the immediate service of Ferdinand, with whom\r\nhe corresponded in cipher during his residence in the Indies. A very\r\ngood repartimiento of Indians was ordered by the king to be given the\r\nfaithful Pasamonte. In 1511 Gil Gonzalez Dávila was made contador of\r\nEspañola, and Juan de Ampues factor; to each were given two hundred\r\nIndians, and they were ordered to examine the accounts of the treasurer,\r\nPasamonte. For the faithful must be kept faithful by the strictest\r\nwatching; such was Spanish discretion, whether in the management of men\r\nor women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe removal of Ovando was delayed by the death of Isabella in 1504, and\r\nof Columbus in 1506. After persistent importunities Diego Colon, son\r\nof the admiral, was permitted in 1508 to plead in the courts of Spain\r\nhis claim, as his father's successor, to the viceroyalty of the Indies.\r\nHis marriage, meanwhile, with María de Toledo, a lady of high birth and\r\nconnection, assisted in opening the eyes of the law to the justness of\r\nhis demands, fully as much as did any argument of counsel. Ovando was\r\nrecalled and Diego authorized to take his place.\r\n\r\nThe new governor, accompanied by his wife, his brother Fernando, his\r\nuncles Bartolomé and Diego, and a retinue brilliant with rank and\r\nbeauty, landed at Santo Domingo in July, 1509. Although Ferdinand had\r\nwithheld the title of viceroy, Diego evidently regarded his appointment\r\nnothing less than a viceroyalty, although the two mainland governors,\r\nAlonso de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa, for the provinces east and west\r\nof Urabá, remained independent of him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SOVEREIGN TRIBUNAL.]\r\n\r\nDiego's administration was but little if any improvement on those of\r\nhis predecessors. He possessed neither the ability nor the prudence\r\nof Ovando. He had intended equity and honesty in his rulings, and\r\nexceptional kindness to the natives; notwithstanding which he began by\r\ngranting repartimientos to himself, his wife, and kindred, and giving\r\nthe best of the remainder to his favorites. So that the now standard\r\nevils of favoritism and cruelty were in no wise mitigated. Not only were\r\nthe Indians no better used than formerly, but falling into the errors\r\nof his father in the management of men Diego's weak government soon\r\nfound opposed to it a faction at whose head was the powerful Pasamonte.\r\nCharges of a serious nature against the son of the Genoese so frequently\r\nreached Spain that in 1511 the king found it necessary to establish at\r\nSanto Domingo a sovereign tribunal to which appeals might be made from\r\nthe decisions of the governor. This tribunal which at first was only a\r\nroyal court of law, superior to any other colonial power, was the germ\r\nof the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo by which the greater part of the\r\nIndies, islands and firm land, were governed for a period subsequent\r\nto 1521. It was at first composed of three _jueces de apelacion_, or\r\njudges of appeal, Marcelo de Villalobos, Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, and\r\nLúcas Vazquez de Aillon. These _licenciados_, having brought with them\r\ninstructions from Spain, and also orders on Diego Colon for partitions\r\nof land and two hundred Indians each, in 1511 were ready to rule. They\r\nwere empowered to hear and determine appeals from the governor, his\r\n_tenientes_ and _alcaldes mayores_, and from any other judges that\r\nhad been or should be appointed either by the colonial governor or by\r\nthe crown, appeal from their decision being only to the Council of the\r\nIndies in Spain. Although from its creation clothed with many of the\r\npowers of an audiencia, it did not all at once possess that title, but\r\ngradually assumed it.[V-9] By decree of September 14, 1526, we find\r\nthe emperor ordering that in the city of Santo Domingo there should\r\nreside the _Audiencia y Chancillería Real_, \"como está fundada,\" as at\r\npresent constituted. It was to consist of a president; four _oidores_,\r\nwho were also _alcaldes del crímen_, or criminal judges; a _fiscal_, a\r\nprosecuting officer in this case; an _alguacil mayor_, or high sheriff;\r\na _teniente de gran canciller_, or deputy grand chancellor, and other\r\nnecessary officers. Indeed, beside some of the other officers, a\r\npresident had already been provided in 1521, in the person of Luis de\r\nFigueroa, bishop of Concepcion. Francisco de Prado was appointed fiscal\r\nin 1523, at which time the salaries of the oidores were raised, as they\r\nhad been deprived of the right of holding Indians. All appeals from\r\nthe _jueces de residencia_, where the amount involved was less than six\r\nhundred pesos de oro, were thereafter referred to this tribunal. Alonso\r\nde Zuazo took his seat among the oidores in 1526. To the audiencia of\r\nSanto Domingo was given for its district the West India Islands; and\r\non the mainland the governments of Venezuela, Nueva Andalucía, Rio\r\nde Hacha, and Guayana, or el Dorado, this district being bounded by\r\nthose of the audiencias of the Nuevo Reino de Granada, Tierra Firme,\r\nGuatemala, Nueva España, and the provinces of Florida. The president\r\nwas empowered to make such ordinances as he should deem essential\r\nto the good government and defence of the island, just as was done,\r\nwithin their jurisdiction, by other governors of Indian provinces.\r\nHe might fill vacancies in the various subordinate offices until the\r\npleasure of the king should be known, and he might do generally all\r\nthings pertaining to the executive power. In these matters the oidores\r\nwere forbidden to interfere; nor could the president exercise judicial\r\nfunctions, but must nevertheless sign with the judges all sentences. In\r\nother respects this tribunal was on an equal footing with others of its\r\nclass.[V-10]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUDIENCIAS.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the most disturbing question in the colony was that of labor.\r\nTo govern the few Spaniards at Española, under the arbitrary system of\r\nSpain, was a small matter; but to divide among them lands, agricultural\r\nand mineral, and laborers in such a way as to satisfy at once the\r\ncolonists and the many tender and enlightened consciences in Spain, in\r\nsuch a way as to prevent the utter ruin either of colonial enterprise\r\nor of the natives themselves, was indeed a difficult task.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: END OF DIEGO COLON.]\r\n\r\nIn 1509 possession had been taken of Jamaica by Juan de Esquivel, and\r\ntoward the end of 1511[V-11] the governor of Española had sent Diego\r\nVelazquez to occupy Cuba, which was done without the loss of a Spaniard.\r\nOjeda and Nicuesa having failed in colonizing Darien, the mainland\r\nin that vicinity was offered by the king in 1514 to the adelantado,\r\nBartolomé Colon, but he was then too ill to accept the charge, and died\r\nnot long after. In April, 1515, Diego Colon embarked for Spain; and we\r\nfind him attempting his vindication at court, when Ferdinand died, the\r\n23d of January, 1516. Cardinal Jimenez, who held the reins of Spanish\r\ngovernment for a time, refused to decide between the governor and\r\ntreasurer; but in 1520 the emperor directed Pasamonte to molest Diego no\r\nmore. Then affairs at Española became more intolerable than ever, and in\r\n1523 Diego was divested of authority by the Council of the Indies, the\r\nsovereign tribunal at Santo Domingo furnishing ample information of a\r\ncondemnatory character. Diego succeeded, however, in having a commission\r\nappointed to examine the matter more carefully, but this tended only\r\nto further complications; and the last days of the son, which ended in\r\n1526, were not more happy than those of the father had been.[V-12]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BARTOLOMÉ DE LAS CASAS.]\r\n\r\nA steadily growing character, impressing itself more and more upon the\r\naffairs of the Indies as time went by, was that of Bartolomé de las\r\nCasas. Born at Seville in 1474, he conned his humanities at Salamanca,\r\nmaking little stir among the Gamaliels there, but taking the bachelor's\r\ndegree in his eighteenth year. After a residence of about eight years in\r\nthe Indies, having come with Ovando in 1502, he was admitted to priestly\r\norders, from which time he takes his place in history. He was a man\r\nof very pronounced temperament and faculties, as much man of business\r\nas ecclesiastic, but more philanthropist than either; possessed of a\r\nburning enthusiasm, when once the fire of his conviction was fairly\r\nkindled, he gave rest neither to himself nor to his enemies. For every\r\nevil-minded man who came hither was his enemy, between whom and himself\r\nwas a death-struggle. The Apostle of the Indies he was sometimes called,\r\nand the mission he took upon himself was to stand between the naked\r\nnatives and their steel-clad tormentors. In this work he was ardent,\r\nofttimes imprudent, always eloquent and truthful, and as impudently\r\nbold and brazen as any cavalier among them all. Nor was he by any means\r\na discontented man. He sought nothing for himself; he had nothing that\r\nman could take from him except life, upon which he set no value, or\r\nexcept some of its comforts, which were too poor at best to trouble\r\nhimself about. His cause, which was the right, gave breadth and volume\r\nto his boldness, beside which the courage of the hare-brained babbler\r\nwas sounding brass.\r\n\r\nWhen the attention of the church was first seriously drawn toward the\r\namelioration of the condition of the Indians, which was in 1511, there\r\nwere at Española some thirteen Dominicans, living with their vicar,\r\nPedro de Córdoba, according to the strictest rules of the order, and\r\nlikewise several Franciscans, among whom was Antonio de Espinal. The\r\nDominicans began their protest by a sermon denouncing the course of the\r\ncolonists, and when ordered to retract, they repeated their charges\r\nwith still greater emphasis. The colonists sent agents to Spain to\r\nhave the contumacious monks displaced, and among them Espinal; for the\r\nFranciscans, as much in a spirit of opposition to the Dominicans as to\r\nfind favor with the laity, showed a leaning toward the repartimiento\r\nsystem, though they could not decently defend it. The Dominicans sent\r\nAntonio Montesino, he who had preached the distasteful sermon, all\r\nthe Dominicans present having signed approval of it. To consider the\r\nmatter, a junta was summoned in Spain, which pronounced the Indians a\r\nfree people, a people to be Christianized, and not enslaved; they were\r\ninnocent heathen, not infidel enemies like the Moors, or natural-born\r\nslaves like the negroes. Ferdinand and Fonseca were both earnest in\r\nobtaining this verdict, for so had said the king's preachers. Meanwhile\r\nMontesino encountering Espinal in Spain, won him over to the side of\r\nhumanity. But all the same the repartimientos were continued, for they\r\nwere fatherly protection only in theory, and the colonists went on\r\nscourging the poor red men.\r\n\r\nIn the occupation of Cuba, Pánfilo de Narvaez was named by Velazquez\r\nhis lieutenant, and sent forth to subjugate other parts of the island.\r\nWith Narvaez went Las Casas, who put forth almost superhuman exertions\r\nin vain to stay the merciless slaughter of the helpless and innocent.\r\nA warm friend of Las Casas was Velazquez' alcalde, Pedro de Rentería,\r\nwho in the division of the spoils joined Las Casas in accepting a large\r\ntract of land, and a proportionate repartimiento of Indians. This was\r\nbefore Las Casas had seriously considered the matter, and he was at\r\nfirst quite delighted with his acquisition. But the enormity of the\r\nwrong coming upon him, his conversion was as decisive as that of St\r\nPaul. Like the Dominicans of Española, Las Casas began by preaching\r\nagainst repartimientos. In 1515 he sailed for Spain in company with\r\nMontesino, leaving his charge with certain monks sent over from Española\r\nby the prelate Córdoba. These Dominican brothers did what they could,\r\nbut to such straits were the savages driven after the departure of Las\r\nCasas that to escape the bloodhounds and other evils set upon them by\r\nthe Spaniards thousands of them took refuge in suicide. When Diego Colon\r\narrived in 1509 there were left in Española forty thousand natives.\r\nA _repartidor_ was appointed in the person of Rodrigo de Alburquerque\r\nto repartition the Indians, but when he arrived in 1514 there were but\r\nthirteen thousand left to divide. After proclaiming himself with great\r\npomp, Alburquerque plainly intimated that bribery was in order, that he\r\nwho paid the most money should have the best repartimiento. Afterward\r\nthe Licentiate Ibarra, sent to Española to take the residencia of the\r\nalcalde Aguilar, was authorized to make a new partition. Large numbers\r\nof natives were given to the king's favorites in Spain, and the evil\r\ngrew apace. Nor were affairs at Española mended by sending out so\r\nfrequently new officials with new and conflicting powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE JERONIMITE FATHERS.]\r\n\r\nWhatever hopes the monks may have derived from Ferdinand's benign\r\nreception, death cut short the proposed relief. Fonseca, now bishop of\r\nBúrgos, with coarse ribaldry dismissed the subject; but when Las Casas\r\napplied to the regent, Cardinal Jimenez, an earnest and active interest\r\nwas manifest. Las Casas, Montesino, and Palacios Rubios were directed\r\nto present a plan for the government of the Indies, which resulted\r\nin sending thither three Jeronimite Fathers, Luis de Figueroa, Alonso\r\nde Santo Domingo, and Bernardino Manzanedo, monks of the order of St\r\nJerome, being selected because they were free from the complications\r\nin which those of St Francis and St Dominic already found themselves\r\ninvolved in the New World. The Jeronimites were ordered to visit the\r\nseveral islands and inform themselves regarding the condition of the\r\nIndians, and adopt measures for the formation of native settlements.\r\nThese settlements or communities were to be governed each by a cacique,\r\ntogether with an ecclesiastic; and for every two or three settlements\r\na civil officer, called an administrator, having supreme power in the\r\nsettlements, was to be appointed. The cacique, after obtaining the\r\nconsent of the ecclesiastic, should inflict no higher punishment on\r\nhis subjects than stripes; none should be capitally punished except\r\nunder regular process of law. The matters of education, labor, tribute,\r\nmining, and farming were then treated, in all which the welfare of the\r\nnatives was carefully considered, although the repartimiento system\r\nremained. Las Casas was named Protector of the Indians with a salary\r\nof one hundred pesos de oro. Zuazo, a lawyer of repute, was sent with\r\nthe most ample powers to take a residencia of all the judges in the New\r\nWorld, and against his decisions there was to be no appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Jeronimites set out wrapped in mighty determinations. They would\r\nnot even sail in the same ship with Las Casas, wishing to be wholly\r\nfree. In this they were right; but unfortunately, on arriving among\r\nthe wrangling colonists, and having the actual issues thrust upon them,\r\nthey found themselves by no means infallible. Their measures were tame,\r\nand they soon found the Protector arrayed against them. The result was\r\ntheir open defence of the repartimiento system, as the only one by which\r\nSpain could colonize the Indies. The burden should be laid as lightly\r\nas possible on the shoulders of the natives, but they must be made\r\nto work. Las Casas set out in 1517 to enter his complaints at court,\r\nclosely followed by an emissary of the Jeronimites to represent their\r\nside of the question; but they arrived in Spain only to find the regent\r\ndying. Had Charles V. remained in Flanders, and had the life of Cardinal\r\nJimenez been spared to Spain and the New World a few years longer, it\r\nis certain that the cruelties to the Indians would many of them have\r\nbeen prevented, and it is doubtful if negro slavery would ever have been\r\nintroduced into America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIVERS RULES AND RULERS.]\r\n\r\nThough the change of rulers which now occurred seriously clogged the\r\nwheels of government in Spain, the affairs of the Indies seemed directly\r\nto suffer little inconvenience therefrom. It was indeed a great change,\r\nIsabella and Ferdinand gone, Columbus and Jimenez also; and the presence\r\nof this young Charles, undemonstrative, thoughtful, cautious, even when\r\na boy, and enveloped in a Flemish atmosphere that shut out all that was\r\nmost beautiful in Spain, even Castile's liquid language, made it seem\r\nstrange there even to Spaniards, made it seem a long, long time since\r\nthe Moors were beaten and America discovered. The Indies, however, were\r\nfar away, and so little understood by the Flemings that they did not\r\ntrouble themselves much about them.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was fortunate in winning the favor of the Flemish chancellor,\r\nSelvagius, but as in the two previous cases, scarcely was the friendly\r\nfooting established when the great man died, and the bishop of Búrgos,\r\nwhose influence in the government of the Indies had fallen low of late,\r\nwas again elevated. All the measures that Las Casas had proposed to\r\nSelvagius fell to the ground—all save one, the only bad one, and one\r\nconcerning which Las Casas afterward asserted that he would give all he\r\npossessed on earth to recall it; it was the introduction of negro slaves\r\nto relieve the Indians.\r\n\r\nIf the Jeronimite Fathers accomplished no great things in the Indies,\r\nthey at least did little harm. Small-pox attended the herding of\r\nthe natives in settlements, but it never prevailed to the extent\r\nrepresented. The fact that Fonseca held an encomienda of eight hundred\r\nIndians, the Comendador Conchillos one of eleven hundred, Vega one of\r\ntwo hundred, and other influential men at court other numbers, may have\r\nhad something to do with the hostility manifested in that quarter toward\r\nLas Casas, who was unflinching to the end in denouncing the system as\r\nunjust, unchristian, and inhuman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASA DE CONTRATACION.]\r\n\r\nThe office of Indian distributor was most important, and one in\r\nwhich the vital interests of the colonists were involved. It should\r\nhave been filled by one of high integrity who would hold aloof from\r\ncontaminating influences. Such was not Ibarra, who became offensively\r\nmeddlesome in the affairs of the common council, and died under\r\nsuspicious circumstances not long after, Lebron being sent out to take\r\nhis place. When the Jeronimites countenanced negro slavery to relieve\r\nthe Indians, the colonists were benignant; when they undertook civil\r\nservice reform, some of them became furious, especially Pasamonte, who\r\nhad been enriching himself as fast as possible while his patron lived,\r\nbut who had now sunk into insignificance. The favorites of the Flemish\r\nministers, such as Rodrigo de Figueroa, to whom was given charge of\r\nthe Indian settlements, were now the recipients of the fat offices; and\r\nthe fact of their being Flemish favorites was sufficient to array the\r\ncolonists against them. It was not long before they succeeded in having\r\nthe residencia of Figueroa ordered, and Lebron installed as overseer\r\nof Indians in his place. In 1518, Jimenez who sent the Jeronimites\r\nbeing dead and Fonseca once more manager, the monks were recalled to\r\nSpain, and the affairs of Española and of the Indies were left with the\r\naudiencia of Santo Domingo, acting in conjunction with the _Consejo de\r\nIndias_[V-13] in Spain, the _Casa de Contratacion_ having more especial\r\ncharge of commercial matters.\r\n\r\nMany schemes for the benefit of the Indians filled the mind of Las\r\nCasas, who continued to labor for them indefatigably. One, originating\r\nwith Pedro de Córdoba, was to set apart on the mainland one hundred\r\nleagues as a place of refuge for the savages, into which no Spaniards\r\nbut priests might enter. This measure was opposed by Fonseca, who said:\r\n\"The king would do well, indeed, to give away a hundred leagues without\r\nany profit to himself.\" After this Las Casas spent some time travelling\r\nthrough Spain and inducing Spaniards to emigrate to the Indies, but\r\nlittle that was beneficial came of it. Succeeding finally in enlisting\r\nthe sympathies of the king's preachers in behalf of the Indians,\r\na plan for founding a colony on the Pearl Coast was carried, and\r\nnotwithstanding Oviedo appeared in opposition to his brother chronicler\r\nby offering a larger royalty, a grant of two hundred and sixty leagues\r\nwas signed in May, 1520. Failing as a colonist, Las Casas retired for a\r\ntime to the Dominican convent at Santo Domingo. After many years spent\r\nas missionary and preacher in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, he\r\nwas appointed bishop of Chiapas, where in the progress of this history\r\nwe shall again meet him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUNDRY PROVISIONS.]\r\n\r\nCertain attention which the Indies were now receiving may be mentioned\r\nhere. Some little attention was paid by the ever-watchful government\r\nto the welfare of society in these distant parts. The wearing of rich\r\napparel in Española was forbidden by the king in 1523. The appellations\r\nof certain of the islands were undergoing change, so that in due\r\ntime their aboriginal names were restored to Cuba and Jamaica, the\r\nauthorities thereby evincing a good taste which rulers and explorers\r\nof other nations might well have profited by at a later period. In 1515\r\nsix loaves of sugar and twenty _cassia fistula_ were taken by Oviedo to\r\nSpain. In 1517 the pope made bishops in the Indies inquisitors; and when\r\nin 1521-2 the bulls of Leo X. and Adrian VI. ordered the Franciscans\r\nto prepare for mission work in the New World, liberal concessions were\r\nmade to friars going thence. After the death of Pedro de Córdoba, who\r\nhad been appointed inquisitor of the Indies, authority became vested in\r\nthe audiencia of Santo Domingo. Desirous of stimulating emigration, the\r\nemperor in 1522 granted further privileges to settlers in the Indies.\r\nColonists were ordered to take their families to the New World under\r\nsevere penalties for neglect. Licenses were revised, and regulations\r\nconcerning the going to the New World of the religious orders as well as\r\nof all others were made to the utmost extent favorable, but friars found\r\nin the New World without a license must be sent forthwith to Spain.\r\nThen laws were made attempting to regulate the method of making war on\r\nIndians; and in 1523 it was decreed that idols should be destroyed and\r\ncannibalism prevented. Provision was made for the annual payment of\r\nthirty thousand maravedís for the support of a preceptor of grammar.\r\nAnd because of the heavy expenses of living, the emperor permitted the\r\nsalaries of New World officials to be increased. The tribunals were\r\nlikewise reorganized to fit the emergency and facilitate business.\r\nDirections were issued how gold chains should be made and dye-woods cut.\r\nIt seemed to the emperor necessary in 1526 to issue orders facilitating\r\nthe arrest of dishonest mercantile agents in the Indies, and to send\r\nPadre de Bobadilla, a provincial of the order of La Merced, to look\r\nafter the baptism of the Indians. And as to the question of negroes,\r\nvexatious from the beginning, the emperor in 1523 revoked for a time the\r\npermission given in 1511 to send negroes as slaves to the Indies; and\r\nit was again ordered in 1526 that Indian slaves then in Spain should be\r\nreturned to their country and treated as vassals.[V-14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENTS OF NUEVA ANDALUCÍA AND CASTILLA DEL ORO.\r\n\r\n1506-1510.\r\n\r\n     TIERRA FIRME THROWN OPEN TO COLONIZATION—RIVAL\r\n     APPLICATIONS—ALONSO DE OJEDA APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF NUEVA\r\n     ANDALUCÍA, AND DIEGO DE NICUESA OF CASTILLA DEL ORO—HOSTILE\r\n     ATTITUDES OF THE RIVALS AT SANTO DOMINGO—OJEDA EMBARKS\r\n     FOR CARTAGENA—BUILDS THE FORTRESS OF SAN SEBASTIAN—FAILURE\r\n     AND DEATH—NICUESA SAILS FOR VERAGUA—PARTS COMPANY WITH HIS\r\n     FLEET—HIS VESSEL IS WRECKED—PASSES VERAGUA—CONFINED WITH HIS\r\n     STARVING CREW ON AN ISLAND—SUCCOR—FAILURE AT VERAGUA—ATTEMPTS\r\n     SETTLEMENT AT NOMBRE DE DIOS—LOSS OF SHIP SENT TO ESPAÑOLA\r\n     FOR RELIEF—HORRIBLE SUFFERINGS—BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES OF LAS\r\n     CASAS, OVIEDO, PETER MARTYR, GOMARA, AND HERRERA—CHARACTER OF\r\n     THE EARLY CHRONICLERS FOR VERACITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyages of Bastidas and Columbus completed the discovery of a\r\ncontinuous coast line from the gulf of Paria to Cape Honduras. In 1506\r\nJuan Diaz de Solis, a native of Lebrija, and Vicente Yañez Pinzon took\r\nup the line of discovery at the island of Guanaja, where the admiral had\r\nfirst touched, and proceeding in the opposite direction sailed along\r\nthe coast of Honduras to the westward, surveyed the gulf of Honduras\r\nand discovered Amatique Bay, but passed by without perceiving the Golfo\r\nDulce which lies hidden from the sea. The object still was to find the\r\nmuch-desired passage by water to the westward. Continuing northerly\r\nalong Yucatan, and finding the coast trending east rather than west,\r\nthey abandoned the undertaking and returned to Spain. Meanwhile Juan\r\nPonce de Leon was enriching himself by the pacification of Puerto Rico,\r\npreparatory to invading the mainland to the northward in search of the\r\nfountain of youth; in which sapient attempt he lost his money, and\r\nnot long afterward his life, unfortunately never finding the liquid\r\nimmortality that bubbled somewhere in the jungles of Florida.\r\n\r\nAnd now ten years had elapsed since Cabot and Columbus first saw the\r\nwestern continent, the former in 1497, the latter in 1498, and although\r\nseveral attempts had been made, as yet there was no European settlement\r\non any part of it. It was not that the thirst for western spoils was\r\nby any means assuaged; but Ferdinand was busy, and the experiences\r\nof Ojeda and Columbus on the mainland were not encouraging to the\r\nmost chivalrous cupidity. Returned, however, from his Neapolitan wars\r\nin 1507, his disaffected nobles somewhat quieted, and the disputes\r\nattending Isabella's succession allayed, the king began to look about\r\nhim. By the queen's testament he inherited one half the revenues of the\r\nCastilian colonies. And the king wanted money. It is a royal weakness.\r\nThen he remembered what Columbus had reported of the rich coast of\r\nVeragua; and although the licenses hitherto granted for private voyages\r\nhad not proved very lucrative, and expenditures at Santo Domingo were\r\ntoo near receipts to be satisfactory, no better way seemed feasible\r\nthan to throw open to colonization the mainland, or _tierra firme_, as\r\nthe discovered portion of the continent now began to be called.[VI-1]\r\nFurther than this, Ferdinand was well aware that if he would retain his\r\nwestern possessions he must occupy them; for stimulated by the success\r\nof Portugal and Spain, France, England, Holland, and Sweden had all\r\nawakened to oceanic enterprise. He had before this commissioned Ojeda\r\nto watch the inroads of the English at the north, and directed Pinzon\r\nto have an eye on the Portuguese and the pope's partition line at the\r\nsouth; now he was resolved to break the territory into kingdoms and\r\nprovinces, and apportion them for government to such of his subjects as\r\nwere able and willing to colonize at their own cost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OJEDA AND NICUESA.]\r\n\r\nWhen the intention of the king was known, two dashing cavaliers appeared\r\nand asked for the government of the rich coast of the Tierra Firme. One\r\nwas Diego de Nicuesa, a native of Baeza, well-born and an accomplished\r\ncourtier, having been reared by Enrique Enriquez, chief steward and\r\nuncle of the king. He came to the Indies first with Ovando. The other\r\nwas Alonso de Ojeda, then in Santo Domingo, and already famous in\r\nNew World annals, making his first appearance there with Columbus in\r\nhis second voyage, and having already achieved two notable voyages to\r\nParia, or the Pearl Coast, one in 1499 with Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo\r\nVespucci, and one in 1502, with García de Ocampo and Juan de Vergara.\r\nThe last had been made in four ships, and for the purpose of colonizing;\r\ninstead of which disputes arose, and the fiery commander was seized and\r\ncarried in shackles to Española. There he was tried, and a decision\r\nrendered against him, which however was overruled on appeal to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies; but he came out of his difficulties stripped of\r\nall his possessions.\r\n\r\nThe candidates were much alike, each being a fair type of the Spanish\r\ncavalier. Both were small in stature, though none the less men of\r\nprowess. Symmetrical in form, muscular, active, and skilful in the use\r\nof weapons, they delighted in tilting matches, feats of horsemanship,\r\nand in all those pastimes which characterized Spanish chivalry at the\r\nclose of the Mahometan wars. The school in which Ojeda had studied\r\nexperience, as page to the duke of Medina Celi, who appeared in the\r\nMoorish wars at the head of a brilliant retinue, was in no wise inferior\r\nto that of his rival. Their accomplishments were varied, though not\r\nspecially in the direction of colonizing new countries. Not only was\r\nNicuesa a fine musician, playing well the guitar, and having some\r\nknowledge of ballad literature, but he could make his horse prance in\r\nperfect time to a musical instrument. As for Ojeda, there was little,\r\nin his own opinion, he could not do. The more of recklessness and folly\r\nin the exploit the better he could perform it. Once at Seville, while\r\nIsabella was in the cathedral tower, out from which ran a beam, at a\r\nheight so great that from it men on the ground looked like pygmies,\r\nto show the queen of what metal he was made, he mounted this beam,\r\nbalanced himself, then tripped lightly as a rope-dancer to the end\r\nof it, wheeled, and lifting one foot poised himself on the other at\r\nthis fearfully dizzy height, where almost a breath would dash him to\r\ndestruction; then, returning, he stopped at the wall and placing one\r\nfoot against it threw an orange to the top of the tower.\r\n\r\nWith such distinguished ability on either side, it was difficult to\r\ndetermine between them. Who so suitable to baffle miasma, poisonous\r\nreptiles, and wild beasts while dressing the institutions of Spain\r\nfor the wilderness of America, as the graceful and witty Nicuesa!\r\nWhat a glorious missionary Ojeda would make! So moderate, so wise, so\r\ngentle, so just, both! Nicuesa had money, a necessary commodity to him\r\nwho would colonize at his own cost. But then Ojeda had influence; for\r\nFonseca was his friend, and an inquisitor his cousin. Yet Nicuesa was\r\nnot without advocates at court; money alone was a powerful argument.\r\nWhen, finally, the veteran pilot, Juan de la Cosa, threw his experience\r\nand earnings upon the side of Ojeda, to whom he was devotedly attached,\r\nand offered himself to embark in the adventure, the king concluded to\r\nlet them both go; and then it was that he divided Tierra Firme between\r\nthem, making the gulf of Urabá[VI-2] the dividing point. The eastern or\r\nSouth American portion was called Nueva Andalucía, and of this Alonso\r\nde Ojeda was appointed governor; the western division, extending from\r\nthe gulf of Urabá, or Darien, to Cape Gracias á Dios, was named by the\r\nking Castilla del Oro,[VI-3] or Golden Castile, and the command given to\r\nDiego de Nicuesa. The island of Jamaica, whence they expected to draw\r\ntheir supplies, was to be held in common by the two governors. Were it\r\nnot so much more delightful to bargain with new suitors who have money,\r\nthan to reward old servants who have none, a fine sense of decency might\r\nhave prompted the monarch to give Castilla del Oro to the adelantado,\r\nBartolomé Colon, who had assisted in discovering, and in an attempt\r\nto colonize the country, and who had little to show for his many and\r\nvaluable services to Spain. But Diego Colon was determined they should\r\nnot have Jamaica, and so sent thither Juan de Esquivel, as we have seen,\r\nto hold it for the governor of Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAINLAND DIVISIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe mainland governors were each appointed for four years, during which\r\ntime supplies were free from duties. Their outfit, with four hundred\r\nsettlers and two hundred miners each, might be obtained from Santo\r\nDomingo. They were given the exclusive right to work for ten years\r\nall mines discovered by them on paying into the royal treasury for the\r\nfirst year one tenth of the proceeds, the second year one ninth, the\r\nthird one eighth, the fourth one seventh, the fifth one sixth, and for\r\nthe remaining five years one fifth. The king conditioned, moreover,\r\nthat each governor should build two forts for the protection of the\r\ncolonists, to whom the lands in the vicinity of which were to belong.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the doughty little governors met at Santo Domingo,\r\nwhile making their final preparations. Swelling with new dignities,\r\nactive and mettlesome, each desirous of obtaining as many recruits as\r\npossible, it was not long before they came into collision. First they\r\nquarrelled about Jamaica; as a supplement to which Ojeda stoutly swore\r\nthat should he there encounter Juan de Esquivel, his head should pay\r\nthe penalty. Then their partition line became a bone of contention,\r\nboth claiming the Indian province of Darien.[VI-4] The geography of\r\nthe coast was at that time but little known; their dominions toward\r\nthe south were limitless, and for aught they knew larger than Spain.\r\nAlthough both the commanders were small corporally, in feeling they were\r\nlarge, and required much room. The breach thus opened was in no wise\r\nlessened by the superior success of Nicuesa, who with a deeper purse,\r\nand a government famous for its wealth, drew off recruits from his less\r\nfortunate rival. Five large caravels and two brigantines, flying the\r\nflag of Castilla del Oro, rode in the harbor. All were well equipped\r\nand liberally provisioned; and already Nicuesa mustered nearly eight\r\nhundred men and six horses, while Ojeda at his best could muster but\r\nthree hundred men in two small ships and two brigantines.[VI-5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RIVAL GOVERNORS.]\r\n\r\nNettled at every turn he made about the little town, Ojeda, who was a\r\nbetter swordsman than logician, at length proposed to settle all scores\r\nby single combat. \"Agreed,\" replied Nicuesa, who was equally brave\r\nyet less passionate, \"but for what shall we fight? Match me with five\r\nthousand castellanos, and I am your man.\" Finally old Juan de la Cosa\r\ninterfered to prevent bloodshed; the river Darien, or Atrato, was made\r\nthe dividing line, and measures were taken to hasten departure before\r\nthe fire of hot Ojeda should blaze out again.\r\n\r\nBut Ojeda was not without his little triumphs. There dwelt at this time\r\nat the capital of the Indies a lawyer, known as the Bachiller[VI-6]\r\nMartin Fernandez de Enciso, who during a successful practice of many\r\nyears had accumulated some two thousand castellanos. Tempted by the\r\noffer of being made alcalde mayor[VI-7] of the new government, he was\r\ninduced by the impetuous Ojeda to embark his entire fortune in the\r\nadventure. It was arranged that the bachiller should remain at Santo\r\nDomingo for some time after the departure of Ojeda, in order to obtain\r\nfurther recruits and fit out another ship, and then follow the governor\r\nto Nueva Andalucía.\r\n\r\nOf Ojeda's party was Francisco Pizarro; and flitting restlessly from\r\none heterogeneous group to another, enviously watching preparations in\r\nwhich circumstances prevented their participating, were other dominant\r\nspirits waiting opportunity, notably Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, tied by debt\r\nto distasteful agriculture, and Hernan Cortés, fortunately forbidden to\r\nembark by illness.\r\n\r\nOjeda was the first to sail, embarking November 10, 1509. Nicuesa\r\nwould have weighed anchor at the same time, but was prevented by his\r\ncreditors; for his success in securing followers was attended by so\r\ncopious a drain of purse that not only his money but his credit was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nFavorable winds wafted Ojeda quickly to Cartagena, where he landed and\r\nproclaimed in loud and vaunting tones his manifesto.[VI-8] A shower of\r\npoisoned darts was the reply; a mark of disrespect from his new subjects\r\nwhich set the governor's blood boiling. Breathing a short prayer to the\r\nvirgin, Ojeda seized a lance, and charging the natives at the head of\r\nhis followers scattered them in the forest, and rashly pursued them.\r\nThese were no effeminate islanders; the women fought side by side\r\nwith the men, who were equal to those of Veragua, with the additional\r\nadvantage of envenomed arrow-points, which, with the occasional\r\nshelter their forests afforded, made them more than a match for the\r\nSpaniards.[VI-9] This Ojeda had all to learn, and to pay dearly for\r\nthe knowledge. Of seventy of his best and bravest who followed him four\r\nleagues inland but one returned. Even his staunch and veteran friend,\r\nJuan de la Cosa, after vainly attempting to dissuade his self-willed\r\ncolleague from his purpose, placed himself by his side and died there.\r\nOjeda fought like a tiger until his men were scattered and killed, and\r\nhe was left wounded and alone in a marshy thicket, where several days\r\nafter a fresh party from the ships found him half-dead. When warmed into\r\nlife and returned to the harbor he saw entering it Nicuesa's fleet he\r\nhid himself, afraid to meet his rival in that plight. Told of this by\r\nOjeda's men, as supplemental to their dismal tale, Nicuesa's anger was\r\naroused at the unjust suspicion. \"Tell your commander,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"that Diego de Nicuesa is a Christian cavalier who makes no war on a\r\nprostrate foe; that not only shall past feuds be buried, but he promises\r\nnever to leave this spot until the deaths of Juan de la Cosa and his\r\ncomrades are avenged.\" He was as good as his word. Landing four hundred\r\nmen, he surprised an Indian village, put men, women, and children to\r\nthe sword, and secured large booty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NUEVA ANDALUCÍA.]\r\n\r\nAfter Nicuesa had departed on his way, Ojeda cast off from that\r\nill-fated shore his ships, and brought them to the gulf of Urabá,\r\nwhere on its eastern side, near the entrance, he built a fortress, the\r\nbeginning of his capital city, and called it San Sebastian[VI-10] in\r\nhonor of the arrow-martyred saint, whose protection he craved from the\r\nvenomous darts of his subjects. From San Sebastian, Ojeda despatched\r\nto Santo Domingo one of his vessels with the gold and captives he had\r\ntaken, at the same time urging Enciso to hasten his departure, and\r\nsend supplies. Meanwhile Ojeda's temper, which was as sharp and fiery\r\nas Damascus steel, made little head-way against tangled marshes and\r\npoisoned arrows. Persisting in his high-handed policy, he could do\r\nnothing with the natives, food being as difficult to obtain as gold,\r\nand his ranks rapidly thinned.\r\n\r\nWhile harassed by hunger and watching anxiously the coming of Enciso\r\nand the return of their ships, the colonists descried one day a strange\r\nsail. On reaching San Sebastian it proved to be a Genoese vessel which,\r\nwhile loading with bacon and cassava bread at Cape Tiburon, had been\r\npiratically seized by one Bernardo de Talavera and a gang of vagabonds\r\nfrom Santo Domingo, who escaped with their prize and had come to Nueva\r\nAndalucía to seek fortune under the wise and happy rule of Governor\r\nOjeda. To buy the cargo was the work of a moment, for the pirates were\r\nvery ready to sell; and, indeed, had they not been, the governor would\r\nhave compelled them. The poison was in his blood, which was now hot\r\nwith fever, and he was in no mood for ceremony. But the relief thus\r\nobtained was only temporary. Day by day the food supply diminished. The\r\ncolonists were reduced in number from three hundred to three score. And\r\nwith bodily ailment came as usual mind-distempers, wranglings, ruin,\r\nand despair. Where now was the valiant Ojeda? Humiliated to the dust,\r\nas well before the savages as before the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF OJEDA.]\r\n\r\nYet he would not yield to fate without another effort, wasted and weak\r\nas he was. Giving Pijano command of the fortress, Ojeda took passage in\r\nthe freebooter's ship and sailed for Santo Domingo. But his patroness,\r\nthe virgin, had indeed deserted him. Shipwreck met him at Cuba,\r\nwhence he crossed to Jamaica. Talavera and his gang, after the most\r\nextraordinary exertions, likewise reached Jamaica, but only to be seized\r\nby order of Diego Colon and hanged. Ojeda said nothing to Esquivel\r\nabout striking off his head, but humbly took the kindly extended aid.\r\nProceeding to Española in a caravel he found Enciso gone, and himself a\r\nbankrupt invalid. Pride, which seldom deserts a Spanish cavalier, gave\r\nway. Reduced to penury, broken-hearted, he died, begging as proof of his\r\nhumility to be buried under the monastery portal, that all who entered\r\nshould tread upon his grave. Farewell, daring, dashing, irrational\r\nOjeda!\r\n\r\nLet us now look after Nicuesa. When from the discomfited Ojeda the\r\ngallant governor of Castilla del Oro last parted, he coasted westward\r\ntoward Veragua, where he purposed to plant his colony. The better\r\nto survey the seaboard, he took a small caravel, and ordered Lope de\r\nOlano, his lieutenant, to attend him with two brigantines, while the\r\nlarger vessels kept farther from the shore. Thus they proceeded until\r\nreaching the Indian province of Cueba, where a port was discovered into\r\nwhich flowed a small stream called Pito. There they landed and said\r\nmass,[VI-11] and therefore named the place Misas.\r\n\r\nLeaving there the largest ships in charge of a relative named Cueto,\r\nwho was to receive word when to follow, Nicuesa pressed forward toward\r\nVeragua with a caravel carrying sixty men, Lope de Olano still attending\r\nin a brigantine with thirty men. A storm arising not long after, the\r\nlatter took advantage of this and the darkness of the night to separate\r\nfrom him, impelled partly by a conviction that they were on the wrong\r\ncourse, partly by ambitious projects. After waiting two days in vain for\r\nhis companion Nicuesa continued westward. In the search for Veragua he\r\nattempted to follow a chart drawn by Bartolomé Colon, though his pilots\r\nDiego de Ribero and Diego Martin, both of whom had been with Columbus,\r\nassured him that he had passed the place. The storm increasing, Nicuesa\r\nran his vessel into the mouth of a large river; but when attempting\r\nto proceed after the storm he found himself caught in a trap, and his\r\nvessel on the bar amidst the breakers, the water having subsided. Unable\r\nto move the ship in either direction, its destruction was inevitable,\r\nand the men set about saving themselves. A rope was stretched to the\r\nshore at the cost of a life; and scarcely had the last person reached\r\nland when the vessel went to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASTILLA DEL ORO.]\r\n\r\nBehold, then, the courtly Nicuesa, so lately the proud commander of a\r\nfleet, by this sudden freak of fortune cast upon an inhospitable shore,\r\nhis whereabouts unknown to himself or to those in the ships, and his\r\nalmost naked followers destitute of food, save one barrel of flour and\r\na cask of oil flung them by the surly breakers! His mind was moreover\r\nill at ease concerning Olano, whose reputation was none of the best,\r\nand who Nicuesa thought might have joined him had he been disposed. The\r\nship's boat fortunately drifted ashore, and in it Nicuesa placed Diego\r\nde Ribero and three seamen, ordering them to keep him company along the\r\nshore, and render assistance in crossing streams and inlets. Already\r\nfaint with hunger, they began their march. But whither? Still westward,\r\nbut not toward Veragua. Each weary footstep carried them farther and\r\nfarther from their destination. It was not a pleasant journey feeling\r\ntheir way through tropical forests, with such impediments as tangled\r\njungles, hot malarious mudbeds, craggy hills and treacherous streams\r\nto block their way. Some of the party had no shoes, some no hat; sharp\r\nstones cut their feet, thorny brambles tore their flesh, and their\r\nhalf-clad bodies were exposed alternately to burning sun and drenching\r\nrain. They were soon glad to get shell-fish and roots to eat with\r\ntheir leaves. One day an arrow from an overhanging height struck dead\r\nNicuesa's page, but fortunately the savages retired without pressing\r\ntheir advantage. Nicuesa's dog, seeing murder in his hungry master's\r\neye, took to his heels and was never afterward seen. Yet greater\r\nmisfortunes awaited the Spaniards. After crossing an inlet in the boat\r\none evening, they rested for the night, and in attempting to resume\r\ntheir march next morning found themselves upon an island. Calling for\r\nRibero, he was missing. Nor was the boat anywhere to be seen. It could\r\nnot be possible that he had left them to die on that circumscribed and\r\nbarren spot. Loudly they called, searching every inlet, and sweeping\r\nthe horizon with terror-lighted eyes. It was true; they were abandoned!\r\n\r\nIt is curious to witness the effect of despair on different minds,\r\nof the near approach of that hateful means for our final suppression.\r\nSome will fight the monster; others succumb, sinking into drivelling\r\nimbecility; others calmly abandon themselves to the inevitable, even\r\nthe ludicrous aspect of the case coming home to some of them, looking\r\ngrimly cheerful. As elsewhere, both fools and philosophers were found\r\namong Nicuesa's crew. Some prayed and confessed, with divers degrees\r\nof accompaniment, from low lamentation to frantic raving; some cursed;\r\nsome nursed their horror in sullen silence.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to describe Nicuesa's sufferings while on this\r\nisland. Suffice it to say that on a scanty diet of roots and shell-fish\r\nwith brackish water many died, while others wished themselves dead; for\r\nthe former might rot in peace, but the latter yet living swarmed with\r\nimpatient vermin. And there was little satisfaction in effort, when\r\ndrinking only increased thirst, and eating but kept alive despondency.\r\nTruly it was a good thing, a grand thing to adventure life to capture\r\nwild lands and rule one's fellows!\r\n\r\nThus weeks passed. Then like a ray shot from the Redeemer's throne a\r\nsail was seen. Men wasted to the last extremity shook off death's grip\r\nand roused themselves, stretching their long lank necks, their bony\r\nchins and glazed eyes toward the approaching vessel, which soon came to\r\nanchor before the island. Ribero was not a villain after all. Satisfied\r\nthat Veragua was behind them, but unable to convince Nicuesa, Ribero\r\nwon over to his views the three boatmen, left the island during the\r\nnight, retraced their course and reached Veragua. There they found the\r\ncolonists, with Olano bearing rule, who on the information of Ribero\r\ncould scarcely do less than send his governor succor.[VI-12]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving here Nicuesa, let us inquire concerning the other portions of\r\nhis scattered colony. Two months having elapsed since the departure of\r\nthe governor from the port of Misas, and hearing nothing from any one,\r\nCueto, in whose charge the fleet was left, became uneasy, and taking\r\na small vessel, set out in search of his commander. The only tidings\r\nhe could gain were from a letter found on an island, wrapped in a leaf\r\nand fastened to a stick, which informed him that Nicuesa was well and\r\nstill journeying westward. Returning to Misas, Cueto with the entire\r\nfleet sailed for Veragua; but so badly worm-eaten were the ships that he\r\nwas obliged to come to anchor at the mouth of the River Chagre,[VI-13]\r\nwhich from the ravenous alligators that swarmed there was called by\r\nthe Spaniards Lagartos. There portions of the cargoes were landed; and\r\nwhile attempts were made to repair the ships, one of the pilots, Pedro\r\nde Umbría, was sent in quest of the lost governor. Meanwhile Lope de\r\nOlano arrived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOES OF NICUESA.]\r\n\r\nEvidently the lieutenant did not in his heart desire his captain's\r\nreturn. For although in reciting to his comrades the circumstances of\r\nthe storm, and the disappearance of the governor, with such variations\r\nas suited his purpose, with tears which would have done honor to the\r\ncrocodiles thereabout, he made no effort to find Nicuesa. He affected\r\nto believe him dead. \"And now, gentlemen,\" he said, \"let no more mention\r\nbe made of him if you would not kill me.\"\r\n\r\nThe fleet now proceeded to Belen, where the usual catalogue of disasters\r\nattends the disembarkation. Four men are drowned. The worm-eaten ships\r\nare dismantled, broken in pieces, and of the fragments huts are made\r\non the site formerly occupied by Bartolomé Colon. Olano, after some\r\nopposition, is formally proclaimed lieutenant-governor. Raids follow;\r\nbut the quibian, grown wise by experience, retires with his people, and\r\nleaves the Spaniards to shift for themselves. There being nothing to\r\nsteal, they starve. Disease and disaffection follow; Olano is not happy.\r\n\r\nWrathful, indeed, was Nicuesa on reaching Belen. Against Olano his\r\nindignation was extreme. He charged him with wilful desertion, with\r\nfelonious destruction of the ships, and with gross mismanagement. He\r\nhad ruined all. Branding him as a traitor he ordered his arrest; and\r\nwhen some feeble attempts were made by the others to mitigate the\r\ngovernor's displeasure, he broke forth on them. \"It well becomes you,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"to ask pardon for him, when you should be begging mercy\r\nfor yourselves!\"\r\n\r\nBut of what use were oaths and bickerings? Of his gallant company half\r\nwere dead, and the less fortunate remainder lived only to suffer yet\r\nawhile before following. Of all the men who came from Spain, proud\r\nNicuesa lost the most, having most to lose. Of all New World woes,\r\nNicuesa's woes were greatest; the half of what thus far has been words\r\ncannot tell, and the worst part is yet to come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOMBRE DE DIOS.]\r\n\r\nNow that the rich Veragua was reached, the Golden Castile of greedy\r\nanticipations, what then? The gold with which to load the ships was\r\nwanting; the ships with which to bear away that gold were almost all\r\ndestroyed. The fertile soil was marshy, the spicy air malarious, the\r\nredundant vegetation yielded little food for man. Sallow-faced skeletons\r\nof men clamored their distress. Death was busy enough, so Olano's life\r\nwas spared, though his badge of office was exchanged for fetters. Even\r\nforagers perished for want of food; every member of one band died from\r\neating of a putrescent Indian. The governor grew peevish; his generous\r\ntemper was soured by misfortune. The colonists complained of his\r\nharsh treatment and indifference to their sufferings. And they said to\r\nhim: \"The fates are against us here; let us abandon this place.\" \"Oh,\r\nvery well!\" snarled Nicuesa. Leaving Alonso Nuñez, with the dignified\r\ntitle of alcalde mayor, and a few men to harvest some grain planted by\r\nOlano, the colonists embarked in two brigantines and a caravel, built\r\nof fragments of the broken ships, to seek some healthier spot. After\r\nsailing eastward some twenty leagues, a Genoese sailor named Gregorio\r\naddressed the governor: \"I well remember, when with the admiral in this\r\nvicinity we entered a fine port where we found food and water.\" After\r\nsome search the place was found, the Portobello of Columbus, and an\r\nanchor dropped there by the admiral was seen protruding from the sand.\r\nLanding for food, the Spaniards were attacked and twenty killed; indeed,\r\nthey could scarcely wield their weapons so weak were they. Faint and\r\ndisheartened they continued their way about seven leagues farther, when\r\napproaching the shore Nicuesa cried out: \"Paremos aquí en el nombre de\r\nDios!\" Here let us stop in God's name! They found anchorage, the place\r\nbeing the Puerto de Bastimentos of Columbus. The companions of Nicuesa,\r\nhowever, ready in their distress to seize on any auspice, took up the\r\ncry of their commander and applied the words Nombre de Dios[VI-14] to\r\nthe harbor which they then entered, and which name to this day it bears.\r\n\r\nHere another attempt was made to locate the government of Castilla del\r\nOro. Disembarking, Nicuesa took formal possession, erected a fortress,\r\nand began again his necessary though suicidal policy of foraging. The\r\nnatives retired. The malarious atmosphere wrapped the strangers in\r\ndisease and death. The caravel was sent back to Veragua, and Alonso\r\nNuñez and the remnant of the colony brought away. The vessel was\r\nthen sent to Española for supplies, but neither ship nor crew were\r\never afterward heard from. Meanwhile Nicuesa and the remnant of his\r\nluckless company made a brave stand, but all of no avail. Long since\r\nfate had decreed their destruction. It was not possible in their\r\npresent condition to live. Reptiles as food became a luxury to them;\r\nthe infected sunlight dried up their blood; despair paralyzed heart and\r\nbrain; and to so dire extremity were they finally reduced that they were\r\nscarcely able to mount guard or bury their dead.[VI-15]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my bibliographical notices thus far I have had occasion to make\r\nmention more particularly of original documents referring to individual\r\nepisodes. I will now say a few words concerning the early chroniclers,\r\nLas Casas, Oviedo, Peter Martyr, and Gomara, and of the later and more\r\ngeneral writer, Herrera. On these, the corner-stones of early Spanish\r\nAmerican annals, the fabrics of all who follow them must forever rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE WRITINGS OF LAS CASAS.]\r\n\r\nThe lives of Las Casas and Oviedo constitute in themselves no small\r\nportions of their respective histories. Both came to the New World,\r\nand each took an active and prominent part in many of the matters of\r\nwhich he wrote. They were nearly of an age; the former being born at\r\nSeville in 1474, and the latter at Madrid in 1478; but Oviedo did not\r\ncome to America until 1514, being with Pedrarias Dávila when he went\r\nto govern Darien, while Las Casas took up his residence under Ovando at\r\nEspañola in 1502. Las Casas was an ecclesiastic whose life was devoted\r\nto befriending the Indians, and he did not leave America for the last\r\ntime until 1547, after half a century of most humane service; Oviedo was\r\na cavalier who sought to better his broken fortunes by obtaining through\r\nhis influence at court the office of _veedor de las fundiciones del\r\noro de la Tierra Firme_, supervisor of gold-melting for Tierra Firme,\r\nwhich office he held throughout his connection with the affairs of the\r\ncontinental Indies, until 1532. Both were influential men at court,\r\nLas Casas being quite intimate with young Charles, while Oviedo had\r\nbeen _mozo de cámara_, or page to Prince Juan. Both made frequent trips\r\nbetween Spain and America; Oviedo crossed the Atlantic twelve times,\r\nLas Casas even more.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was as able an annalist as he was reformer. His greatest\r\nwork, _Historia de las Indias_, was begun in his fifty-third year, and\r\ncompleted in 1561, five years before his death. It was extensively\r\ncopied and used in manuscript, but was not printed until 1875-76.\r\nThough consisting of five volumes, it comprises but three decades, or\r\nbooks, and brings the history of the New World down only to 1520. It\r\nwas the author's original intention to have continued his work through\r\nsix decades, which would have brought it down to 1550, and hence have\r\nincluded his important experiences in Guatemala, Chiapas, and Mexico.\r\nNext to the general history of the Indies stands the _Apologética\r\nHistoria_, comprising a description of the country and the customs of\r\nthe people, and written to defend the natives against the accusation\r\nthat they lacked system in their societies, not having reason to govern\r\nthemselves. His first printed work was issued in Mexico in 1546;\r\nit was entitled _Cancionero Spiritual_, and was dedicated to Bishop\r\nZumárraga. At Seville, in 1552, was published, in one volume 4to, _Breve\r\nrelacion de la destruccion de las Indias Occidentales_, and other\r\ntracts of a similar nature; such as his Controversy with Sepúlveda;\r\nhis Thirty Propositions; Remedies for the Reformation of Indies; Rules\r\nfor Confessors; a treatise proving the sovereign empire and universal\r\nauthority which the kings of Castile and Leon have over the Indies, etc.\r\nThis collection was put in print in Latin, French, Italian, German,\r\nand Dutch, some of the translations appearing in several editions.\r\nThe Controversy with Sepúlveda was issued separately. Juan Antonio\r\nLlorente printed at Paris in 1822 a _Coleccion de las Obras del Obispo\r\nde Chiapa_, 2 vols. 8vo, which was published the same year in French,\r\nunder title of _Œuvres de Don Barthélemi de las Casas_. The collection\r\ncomprises several of his less important works; the French translation\r\nis remarkably free, the author being at times quite lost sight of,\r\nand several new pieces of doubtful origin are added. As a writer, Las\r\nCasas is honest, earnest, and reliable, except where his enthusiasm\r\ngets the better of him. His learned opponent and arch-enemy, Sepúlveda,\r\npronounces him most subtle, most vigilant, and most fluent, compared\r\nwith whom the Ulysses of Homer was inert and stuttering. He was not only\r\na thorn in the flesh of evil-doers, but by his persistent and stinging\r\neffrontery he often exasperated mild and benevolent men. But whatever\r\nhis enemies may say of him, and they are neither few nor silent, true\r\nit is that of all the men who came to the Indies he almost alone leaves\r\nthe furnace with no smell of fire upon him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GONZALO FERNANDEZ DE OVIEDO Y VALDÉS.]\r\n\r\nGonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés was of the noble family of Oviedo\r\nin Asturias. In early childhood, before entering the service of Prince\r\nJuan, he was with the duke of Villa Hermosa. While watching the fall\r\nof Granada he met Columbus, and afterward witnessed his triumph at\r\nBarcelona. After the death of his young master in 1497, who in fact\r\nwas of his own age, Oviedo went to Italy, where art and science were\r\nenlivened by war, serving under Frederico of Naples, and sometimes\r\njewel-keeper to Queen Juana. Married at Madrid, in 1502, to the\r\nbeautiful Margarita de Vergara, whom he lost in childbirth ten months\r\nafter, he plunged into the excitement of war, serving as secretary\r\nto Córdoba in the French campaign. Marrying again, he hovered about\r\nthe court until, in his thirty-sixth year, his dwindling fortunes\r\nsent him with Pedrarias to Darien, in the capacity before mentioned.\r\nHis doings there will be told in the text of this history; suffice\r\nit to say here that most of his time there was spent in broils with\r\nthe governor, beside which he had to endure the loss of his wife and\r\nchild, imprisonment, and the dangerous wound of an assassin's knife.\r\nBut, obtaining at last the appointment of Pedro de los Rios in place of\r\nPedrarias, and for himself the governorship of Cartagena, which office,\r\nhowever, he never exercised, after three years' further residence in\r\nTierra Firme, this time in Nicaragua, he returned to Spain in 1530,\r\nspent two years in arranging his notes, resigned his _veeduría_, and\r\nreceived the appointment of _Cronista general de Indias_. In the autumn\r\nof 1532 he went to Santo Domingo, and although appointed the following\r\nyear alcalde of the fortress of Santo Domingo, the remainder of his\r\nlife was passed chiefly in literary work. After an eventful life of\r\nseventy-nine years he died at Valladolid in 1557, while engaged in the\r\npreparation for the press of the unpublished portion of his history.\r\nThroughout the whole of his career Oviedo seems to have devoted every\r\nspare moment to writing. Even before he was appointed royal chronicler\r\nhe was an indefatigable collector of material. He was well acquainted\r\nwith the prominent persons of his time, and few expeditions were made\r\nwithout adding to his store. Want of discrimination in the use of\r\nauthorities is more prominent in his writings than want of authorities.\r\nOf twelve literary efforts but one, beside those relating to America,\r\nfound its way into print. He formed the plan of writing about the New\r\nWorld long before he first crossed the ocean, and actually began his\r\nhistory, according to José Amador de los Rios, before 1519, keeping open\r\nthe general divisions for additions to the day of his death. After his\r\nreturn from the second voyage to Darien he wrote at the request of the\r\nking, and chiefly from memory, as his notes were at Santo Domingo, _De\r\nla Natural Hystoria de las Indias_, printed at Toledo in 1526. This work\r\nwas republished by Barcia, _Historiadores Primitivos_, i., translated\r\ninto Italian by Ramusio, _Viaggi_, iii., and garbled by Purchas in _His\r\nPilgrimes_, iv. 5. This, it must be borne in mind, is totally distinct\r\nfrom the _Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Islas y Tierra-Firme\r\ndel Mar Océano, por el Capitan Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés,\r\nprimer cronista del Nuevo Mundo_, and which alone admits the author\r\nto the first rank as a historian. The General History was originally\r\ndivided into three parts, containing in all fifty books. The first\r\npart, comprising nineteen books, with the preface and ten chapters of\r\nthe fiftieth book—not 20, 21, or 22 books as different bibliographers\r\nstate—was published during the author's life at Seville in 1535, under\r\nthe title _Historia General_, etc., and republished at Salamanca in\r\n1547 as _Hystoria General_. This rare issue contains in several places\r\na few columns of additional matter which have not escaped my attention.\r\nAn Italian version of the same parts was published by Ramusio in his\r\n_Viaggi_, iii.; the first ten books were translated into French and\r\npublished as _Histoire Naturelle_, etc., Paris, 1556; the twentieth\r\nbook, or the first of the second part, was published separately at\r\nValladolid in 1557 as _Libro XX._, etc. Thirteen chapters of Book XLII.,\r\nrelating to Nicaragua, were published in French by Ternaux-Compans,\r\n_Histoire du Nicaragua_, in his second series of Voyages, iii.,\r\nParis, 1840. Finally, the fifty books complete were beautifully and\r\naccurately printed at Madrid in four folio volumes, with plates, by\r\nthe Real Academia de la Historia in 1851-55. The editor, José Amador\r\nde los Rios, gives in an introduction the best notice of the life and\r\nwritings of the author extant. Oviedo was not a learned man like Peter\r\nMartyr, and it is doubtful if a further insight into the books of the\r\nday would have made him any wiser; yet a man who could dictate the\r\nnatural history of a new country without his notes cannot be called\r\nilliterate. He knew Latin and the modern languages; but his familiarity\r\nwith Latin was not sufficient to prevent an unpleasant parade of it.\r\nNor did he possess the genius or practical sagacity of Las Casas; yet\r\nhis extraordinary opportunities were not wholly wasted, nor did life\r\nat court, political quarrels, or gold-gathering at any time wholly\r\nstifle his ambition to achieve the useful in letters. Oviedo was a fair\r\nexample of the higher type of Spaniard of that day; he was intelligent,\r\nenergetic, brave; but cold, unscrupulous, and cruel. And this is true,\r\nwithout going full length with Las Casas in his fiery fanaticism when\r\nhe says:—\"Oviedo should regret what he has written of the Indians;\r\nhe has borne false witness against them; and has calumniated them in\r\nevery way.... He should have inscribed on his title-page, 'This book\r\nwas written by a conqueror, robber, and murderer of the Indians, whole\r\npopulations of whom he consigned to the mines, where they perished'....\r\nHis work is as full of lies as of pages.\" To which sentiment I by\r\nno means subscribe. Probably no kind of work, however thoroughly and\r\nconscientiously done, is more open to criticism, is more certain to\r\nbe criticised on every side, than contemporaneous history from facts\r\nfor the first time gathered, and from many and conflicting witnesses.\r\nTernaux-Compans says well:—\"Oviedo n'est pas exempt des préjugés de son\r\ntemps contre les Indiens, mais après tout, ce qu'il dit se rapproche\r\nplus de la vérité que les peintures fantastiques de l'évêque de Chiapa,\r\nqui veut retrouver l'âge d'or même chez les nations les plus féroces.\"\r\nBoth of these authors, Las Casas and Oviedo, wrote in the heat of the\r\nengagement of the abnormal and ill-understood scenes passing under\r\ntheir immediate notice. What they wrote was certainly true to them;\r\nit is our business to analyze and sift, and make their records true\r\nto us. In the showy criticisms of these and a kindred class of authors\r\nwe see generally something brought in about style and arrangement. The\r\nlatter is always bad, and the index worse than none; but critics should\r\nfind something better to do than find fault with the words and their\r\narrangement of these old fighting chroniclers. Of course their style\r\nis bad, abominable; but who cares for style in them? One wants only the\r\nfacts. Their books are not made to be read, but to be used. Rios seems\r\nto entertain a proper appreciation of the matter when he writes:—\"Mas\r\nya fuera porque procurase dar á su lectura aquella diversidad, tantas\r\nveces por él apetecida, ya porque la misma fatiga é irregularidad\r\ncon que recibia los datos, le impidiese someterlos á un plan maduro\r\né inalterable; es lo cierto que la crítica de nuestros dias, al par\r\nque aprecia y agradece tan interesantes inquisiciones, echa de menos\r\ncierta cohesion y armonia en la exposicion de las costumbres de los\r\nindios, no hallando mayor enlace en la narracion de los descubrimientos\r\ny conquistas, que ni se refieren siempre en órden cronológico, ni\r\nguardan entre sí la conveniente relacion para que pueda comprenderse\r\nsin dificultad su influencia recíproca.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETER MARTYR'S WORKS.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Protector of the Indians and the First Chronicler of the New\r\nWorld were thus gathering and recording historical data in the several\r\nparts of America, one of the most learned men of Europe, Pietro Martire\r\nd'Anghiera, or latinized Anglerius, commonly called Peter Martyr,\r\nwas collecting similar facts in Spain, and recording them, copiously\r\ndiluted with the philosophy of the day, in the form of ten-year epochs,\r\nconstituting in the end a series of decades. The duchy of Milan was\r\nthe early home of this chronicler, and 1457 the year of his birth. His\r\nfamily was of noble descent, and originally of Anghiera. Going to Rome\r\nin 1477 to finish his education, he became so conspicuous for learning\r\nand eloquence that ten years later the Spanish ambassador invited him to\r\ntry his fortune at the court of the Spanish sovereigns. By them he was\r\ngraciously received, especially by Isabella, who wished to occupy him\r\nin the instruction of the young nobles of Castile. The ardent Italian\r\nmust have a taste of war, however, before settling into permanent\r\nsagedom; so he fought before Baza, and laid not down the sword till\r\nthe city of the Alhambra fell. Then he became a priest, and turned\r\ntoward pursuits more in keeping with his natural bent and erudition.\r\nHe opened various schools of learning, which youth of quality made it\r\nthe fashion to attend. Having risen into high consideration at court,\r\nin 1501 he was sent by the crown on missions to Venice and Cairo, in\r\nwhich he acquitted himself creditably, and wrote on his return the _De\r\nLegatione Babylonicâ_, an account of Lower Egypt in three books. On\r\nFerdinand's death he was appointed by Jimenez ambassador to the Sultan\r\nSelim, but refused the honor on account of his age; and afterward he\r\ndid not find Charles less inclined to acknowledge his merits. During\r\nthe three years following his return from Egypt he was appointed prior\r\nof the cathedral of Granada, and by the pope apostolic prothonotary,\r\nand in 1518 he took his seat in the Council of the Indies. His life\r\nwas one of rare industry, in which he gathered and disseminated much\r\nknowledge, and which gained him the respect of princes; his death\r\noccurred in 1526, in the 69th year of his age, and he was buried in his\r\ncathedral at Granada. Peter Martyr is the author of at least two great\r\nworks, viewed historically. They are written in Latin, of anything but\r\nCiceronian ring, for patristic is to the patrician Latin as the 'Frenche\r\nof Stratford atte Bowe' is to the French of Paris. Of these his two\r\nnotable works the chief is _De Orbe Novo_, an account of the New World\r\nand its wonders, in eight decades, or books. The first, and the first\r\nthree, of these decades were published at different times during the\r\nauthor's life, but the eight decades complete did not appear before\r\n1530, when they were printed at Alcalá under the title _De Orbe Novo\r\nPetri Martyris ab Angleria Mediolanensis Protonotarii Cæsaris senatoris\r\ndecades_. Three of the decades translated into English by R. Eden were\r\nprinted in 1555, and reprinted in 1577, with another decade added by\r\nR. Willes. The best complete edition of the eight decades, in their\r\noriginal Latin, next appeared in Paris, published by R. Hakluyt, 1587.\r\nIndeed, beside the edition of 1530, this is the only complete original\r\nedition of the _De Orbe Novo_. In 1612 appeared the work entire in\r\nEnglish, the result of the 'Industrie and painefull Trauaile of M. Lok\r\nGent.' This has been included in a supplement to _Hakluyt's Voyages_,\r\nLondon, 1812. Beside these important editions, partial translations,\r\nextracts, and compilations have appeared at various times and in various\r\nlanguages. In 1534, at Venice, in Italian, were published, in three\r\nseveral parts, summaries of the history of the Indies taken from Peter\r\nMartyr, Oviedo, and others. The other of the two works alluded to is a\r\ncollection of Peter Martyr's letters, in Latin, which brim with notices\r\nof contemporary events, and run from 1488 to his death. Two editions of\r\nthese collected letters were published, the first at Alcalá in 1530,\r\nthe second at Amsterdam, by the Elzevirs, in 1670. The title runs\r\nthus—_Opus Epistolarum Petri Martyris Anglerii Mediolanensis_, etc.;\r\na translation of the letters has never been published. So confused,\r\nmisdated, and interposed are the epistles that Hallam expressed his\r\ndisbelief in any connection whatever between actual and ostensible dates\r\nand service. But the _De Orbe Novo_ may be regarded equal in authority\r\nto the relations of the eye-witnesses Las Casas and Oviedo. Peter Martyr\r\nwas the first of the chroniclers to write and to publish on the New\r\nWorld, his decades beginning to appear about the time Oviedo first went\r\nto the Indies. Immediately Columbus set foot on shore, on his return\r\nfrom the first voyage, the eloquent and philosophic scholar began to\r\nquestion him and those who came with him, and to write, and he never\r\nceased writing until death stopped him. There was so much for a man\r\nof his mind to think and talk about. For a time after this marvellous\r\ndiscovery the learned and intelligently curious lived in a ferment\r\nconcerning it. It was to some extent the revolutionizing of science and\r\nphilosophy. The lines of tradition were snapped; the cosmos had lost its\r\ncontinuity. Peter Martyr, a grave man of broad and deep capabilities;\r\nwell situated for procuring information, meeting daily, many of them\r\nat his own table, those who had returned from the Indies—discoverers,\r\nconquerors, explorers, sailors, priests, and cavaliers—having access to\r\nthe official letters, diaries, charts, and relations of these men, his\r\naccount, I say, should be as reliable and as valuable as that of one who\r\nhad actually mingled in the scenes described. In some respects it should\r\nbe more so, able as he was to see with a hundred eyes instead of two,\r\nand to determine disputes more coolly and equitably. It is true his,\r\nrecords are marred by the haste with which they were written, and by the\r\nadmitted lack of correction or revision by the author; order and method\r\nare nowhere present; mistakes and contradictions are frequent. But we\r\nhave the raw material, which is far better than any elaboration. Las\r\nCasas was the first of the chroniclers to visit the Indies, and the last\r\nof the three thus far named to begin to write and publish history, which\r\nwas in 1552. Oviedo began to write at about the date the history of Las\r\nCasas terminates. It was four years after the death of Peter Martyr that\r\nOviedo was appointed official chronicler of the New World. The general\r\nrelations of the three historians were antagonistic; from which their\r\nwritings may all the better be brought to harmonize with truth. Of the\r\nhundreds who have made their criticisms on the writings of Peter Martyr\r\nI will mention but two. Says Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, i. 32: \"De los\r\ncuales cerca destas primeras cosas á ninguno se debe dar más fe que á\r\nPedro Martir;\" and Muñoz remarks, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, xiii.: \"Merece\r\nindulgencia por el candor con que lo confiesa todo, por su ningun afan\r\nen publicar sus borrones, y principalmente porque tal qual es la obra\r\nde las décadas contiene muchísimas especies que no se hallan en otra\r\nparte alguna, y estas escritas con la conveniente libertad por un autor\r\ncoetáneo, grave, culto, bien instruido de los hechos, y de probidad\r\nconocida.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOMARA AND HERRERA.]\r\n\r\nOf much less importance than the preceding are the writings of Francisco\r\nLopez Gomara, particularly his history of the Indies, which is an\r\nimitation rather than a genuine original, and of which too much has\r\nbeen made, notwithstanding Muñoz pronounces it the first history worthy\r\nthe name. Although Icazbalceta, a high authority on the subject, gives\r\nthe name Gómara, or Gómora, with the accent on the first syllable as\r\nthe Peninsular pronunciation, with the remark that it is commonly\r\ncalled Gomára in Mexico, I have not thought best to depart from an\r\nalmost universal usage. Bustamante goes out of his way to signify an\r\naccent where it would naturally fall, writing Gomára. Born in Seville\r\nin 1510, of an illustrious family—it seems exceptional to find any man\r\nof note in Spain whose family was not illustrious—and educated at the\r\nuniversity of Alcalá, he became a doctor of both civil and canonical\r\nlaw, and filled for a time the chair of rhetoric. From the military\r\nlife designed for him by his parents he was driven by literary tastes\r\ninto the priesthood; and in 1540, upon the return of Cortés from his\r\nlast visit to Mexico, he became chaplain and secretary to the marquis.\r\nFrom this some have inferred and erroneously stated that he spent four\r\nyears in America prior to publishing his history. At Saragossa in 1552-3\r\nappeared his _La Historia General de las Indias_, in two folio parts,\r\nthe first general, and dealing chiefly with Peru, the other devoted to\r\nMexico. The book was popular; and in 1553 from Medina del Campo issued\r\nanother folio edition; and another from Saragossa the year following,\r\nwith this difference as to the last, however, that its second part was\r\ntreated as a separate work and entitled _Cronica de la nueua España con\r\nla conquista de Mexico, y otras cosas notables: hechas por el Valoroso\r\nHernando Cortes_, while the first part appropriated the original title\r\nof _Historia General_, etc. Then appeared an edition at Antwerp, 1554,\r\nand one in which the date, 1552, is evidently spurious. The author\r\nseems to have handled government affairs too roughly; for in 1553 we\r\nfind the book suppressed by royal decree, which, however, was not fully\r\nenforced, and was revoked in 1729. Barcia printed a mutilation of the\r\ntwo works in his _Hist. Prim._, ii., in 1749, and the two were again\r\npublished, in a correct form, in _Biblioteca de Autores Españoles_,\r\nxxii., Madrid, 1852. A somewhat singular case occurred in Mexico in\r\n1826, when was issued, in 2 volumes 8vo, _Historia de las Conquistas\r\nde Hernando Cortés, escrita en Español por Francisco Lopez de Gomára,\r\ntraducida al Mexicano y aprobada por verdadera por D. Juan Bautista\r\nde San Anton Muñon Chimalpain Quauhtlehuanitzin, Indio Mexicano.\r\nPublílcala para instruccion de la juventud nacional, con varias notas y\r\nadiciones, Carlos María de Bustamante_, which being interpreted, at best\r\nis confused. It says that the work, written in Spanish by Gomara, was\r\ntranslated into the Mexican language, and there leaves it. On turning\r\nover the leaves we find the book printed in Spanish, and not in Nahuatl,\r\nas we were led to suppose. Nor does a lengthy preface by Bustamante\r\nmake the matter clear in every respect. Turning to other sources, and by\r\ncomparing all information, we finally learn that Bustamante and others\r\nonce believed in the existence, somewhere, of a history of Mexico,\r\nby the learned and noble native Chimalpain. Probably it lay hidden in\r\nsome one of the libraries or government offices about Mexico. Boturini\r\nspoke of various historical manuscripts written by Domingo de San\r\nAnton Muñon Chimalpain, some in Castilian, and some in Nahuatl. Note,\r\nin passing, the difference in the name, here Domingo, and in the title\r\nJuan Bautista. Clavigero, Leon Pinelo, Beristain, and Antonio de Leon y\r\nGama also vaguely mentioned some work or works by Chimalpain. Bustamante\r\nclaimed, at first, to have found the Mexican history of Chimalpain in\r\nmanuscript, and obtained contributions of money from various sources\r\nto enable him to print a translation of it, with notes. But before the\r\ntranslation was fairly issued in Spanish, the editor was obliged to\r\nconfess himself mistaken as to its being an original work; it was only\r\nGomara rendered into Mexican by the learned Indian, and now translated\r\nback again into Spanish by Bustamante, the text much marred by the\r\ndouble transformation, but enriched by notes from both editors. There\r\nare men so uncharitable as to say that Don Carlos María Bustamante never\r\nfound Chimalpain's translation, because Chimalpain never made one. I\r\ndo not know. Any one of three or four ways was possible. Bustamante may\r\nhave found the alleged translation of Chimalpain, and while translating\r\ninto Spanish what he believed an original work, may have discovered\r\nit to be Gomara; it may have been then in type or printed, or too far\r\nadvanced to stop; or it may be Bustamante, having received the money,\r\nfelt bound to go on with the work, and concluded to trust to his own\r\nand Chimalpain's notes to satisfy those concerned and the public; or\r\nBustamante may have perpetrated a deliberate fraud. This last, although\r\nhe is openly accused of it by his countrymen high in authority, I can\r\nscarcely believe to be the true solution of the mystery, and rather lean\r\nto the first possibility; but I must say that Bustamante committed a\r\nserious mistake in not admitting this frankly, if true. Gomara's history\r\nwas translated into Italian, and published at Rome, one edition, 4to,\r\nin 1555, and one in 1556; and at Venice, one in 8vo, 1565, one in 4to,\r\n1566, and in 8vo again, in 1576. In French, at Paris, six editions in\r\n8vo, 1569, 1578, 1580, 1584, 1587, and 1597, the last five reprints\r\nof the first, except slight augmentations in the last three. London\r\nfurnished an English translation by Henry Bynneman, in 4to, in 1578. The\r\nprologue warns all persons against translating the book into Latin, as\r\nhe was engaged thereat himself; but his Latin version never appeared.\r\nGomara wrote well. His style is better than that of any predecessor;\r\nbut while his opportunities were great, for he had culture, leisure, and\r\naccess to the knowledge and material of Cortés, it is painfully apparent\r\nthat his desire was greater to please the master than to present a plain\r\nunvarnished tale.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after a century of writing and discussions, comes Antonio de\r\nHerrera y Tordesillas as royal historiographer to gather, arrange, and\r\nembody in one general history all knowledge available at that time. It\r\nwas a work needing attention; for if it were further postponed much\r\ninformation then obtainable would be lost. He was born in Cuéllar in\r\n1549, and although the father bore the name of Tordesillas and the\r\nmother of Herrera, for the sake of euphony, distinction, or other\r\nunknown vagary, the son took the name of his mother, a thing not unusual\r\nthen or now in Spain. At an early age we find him in Italy holding the\r\nposition of secretary to Vespasiano Gonzaga, viceroy of Naples, upon\r\nwhose death Herrera was so well recommended to Philip II. that, in\r\n1596, he was made chief historiographer for the Indies. Honored also\r\nwith the title of historiographer of Castile and Leon, he fulfilled\r\nthe duties of both offices through portions of the reigns of the three\r\nPhilips, II., III., and IV. He was likewise nominated for the first\r\nvacant place among the secretaries of state, but died before that\r\nvacancy occurred, in the 76th year of his age. As an historian Herrera\r\nhas made a respectable place for himself, but his reputation rests\r\nprincipally, though not wholly, for he wrote much, on his _Historia\r\nGeneral de los Hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas i Tierra Firme\r\ndel Mar oceano ecrita por Antonio de Herrera coronista mayor de sv\r\nM:d d las Indias y sv coronista de Castilla_, 4 vols. folio, Madrid,\r\n1601-15. On the elaborately engraved title-page of the first volume\r\nis added, _En quatro Decadas desde el Año de 1492 hasta el de 1531_,\r\nwhich refers only to the first two volumes, as the whole four volumes\r\nconsist of 8 decades, comprising general events to 1554. The first two\r\nvolumes were printed in 1601, and reprinted at Valladolid in 1606; the\r\nsecond two volumes appeared in 1615. The work was freely translated;\r\nthe first decade appearing in French, at Paris, in 1659, and with the\r\nsecond decade the year following, the remaining decades in 1671. A most\r\nvile translation into English was made by John Stevens and published\r\nin London, in 6 volumes, the first two in 1725 and the last four in\r\n1726, new editions of which appeared in 1740 and 1743. There were two\r\nreprints in Spanish; one in Antwerp, in 1728, by Verdussen, without\r\nmaps and otherwise faulty; and one in Madrid, 1728-30, with notes,\r\ncorrections, and index by Barcia, and therefore better than the first\r\nedition, in fact the best extant. At the end of the second volume of\r\nthe first edition, and as a prefix to the first volume of the Barcia\r\nedition, should appear the _Description de las Indias Occidentales_,\r\nwith maps, translations of which were made in Latin, Dutch, and French.\r\nAn attempt was made to carry on Herrera's history, and it was continued\r\nfor three decades, from 1555 to 1584, by Pedro Fernandez del Pulgar,\r\nthe chronicler who succeeded Solis, but it was not deemed of sufficient\r\nimportance to print. The original manuscript is in the Royal Library at\r\nMadrid. Herrera was quite a voluminous writer, being author of a general\r\nhistory during the reign of Philip II.; of a history of Scotland and\r\nEngland during the life of Mary Stuart; of Portugal, and the conquest\r\nof the Azores; of France from 1585 to 1594, and of moral and political\r\ntracts, and historical, political, and ecclesiastical translations.\r\nBut though all his works were highly prized for their erudition, none\r\nattained the celebrity of his History of the Indies. Even to-day he may\r\nbe called chief among historians of Spanish-American affairs; not for\r\nhis style, bald, and accurately prolix; nor for his method, slavishly\r\nchronological, and miserably failing in the attempt to do several things\r\nat once; but because of his massed material. His position as state\r\nhistoriographer gave him, of course, access to everything, and he made\r\nuse of his opportunity to an extent then exceptional. At a later period\r\nin the art of history-writing his work must have been regarded as crude\r\neven for early times. But from one who lived when piety and patriotism\r\nwere ranked as the highest virtues, higher than truth, integrity, or\r\nhumanity, the more searching philosophy cannot be expected. Beside\r\nthe faults of style and arrangement there are evidences everywhere of\r\ninexperience and incompetent assistance. Now that we have before us\r\nmany of the sources of Herrera's material we can see that his notes were\r\nbadly extracted, and compiled in a bungling manner; so much so that in\r\naddition to the ordinary errors, from which to some extent the most\r\ncarefully executed work cannot be expected to be wholly free, there\r\nare many and serious discrepancies and contradictions for which there\r\nis no excuse, the cause being simply carelessness. Yet, for all that,\r\nHerrera's is not only the most complete, but one of the most reliable of\r\nthe New World chronicles, and for this the writer merits the gratitude\r\nnot alone of his countrymen but of the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMMENTARY ON THE EARLY CHRONICLERS.]\r\n\r\nBefore closing this note, I will give clearly my opinion regarding the\r\ncredibility of the early chroniclers, including in that category for the\r\npresent purpose all the early writers, conquerors as well as historians,\r\nsuch as Columbus and Cortés, Bernal Diaz, Solis, Torquemada, Boturini,\r\nand the Anonymous Conqueror; for I have been assailed by those who, to\r\ngain cheap notoriety in refuting them, have attributed to me doctrines\r\nwhich I have nowhere expressed or held. They who cannot build for\r\nthemselves seem to think it gravely incumbent on them to demolish any\r\nstructure another may rear, and with one scurrile sweep they would wipe\r\nout the work of twenty years. They are correct enough to this extent,\r\nthat, if ever a building is found so frail as to fall under their\r\nattacks, it does not deserve to stand. Hence we find it the fashion\r\nin certain quarters, under cover of criticism, to repudiate the early\r\nwritings, in so far at least as they interfere with cherished theory or\r\ndogmatic opinion. Spain had lately emerged from the Moorish wars with\r\ngreat glory, they say, and Spaniards in the New World, so long as it\r\nremained with them to tell the story, would not be in the least behind\r\ntheir brethren at home in this new field of fiery exploits. Hence,\r\nfor their accounts, naked barbarians were gorgeously apparelled, and\r\nsurrounded by stately pageantry; art, science, and literature wholly\r\nmythical were given them, and cities equal, at least, to the average\r\nof civilization were built. Instance the Tenochtitlan, the Tezcuco,\r\nthe Tlacopan of Cortés and his contemporaries, which must have been\r\npure fictions. Else where are the vestiges of the walls and gardens\r\nand palaces? There are no ruins of splendid cities, they continue with\r\nthe effrontery of ignorance, no remains of aqueducts, stone carvings,\r\nand tumuli. There are some fine ruins in Central America and Yucatan,\r\nthey admit, displaying no mean advancement in architectural art; but\r\nthey must have been the work of Egyptians, or Phœnicians, or some\r\nother foreigners, because they resemble the ruins standing among those\r\nnations, and because no aboriginal people capable of such performance\r\nexist in America to-day. There was no human sacrifice in Mexico, because\r\nbigoted ecclesiastics in those days were apt to invest with religious\r\nsignificance every hieroglyph, statue, and consecrated stone. One, more\r\nvirulent than the rest, himself of Indian origin and apparently jealous\r\nlest other aboriginals should outshine his Cherokee ancestry, and\r\nknowing little either of the Mexicans or their conquerors, denies the\r\nexistence of a Nahua or Maya civilization and denounces every one who\r\ndiffers in opinion with him, on the ground that all American societies\r\nof which he knew aught were formed on one skeleton, a most earthy,\r\nred, and ignoble one, and that the conquerors, not understanding this\r\nsocial structure, could not correctly describe it, and therefore their\r\nstatements are not to be relied on.\r\n\r\nI can only say that I have studied these chronicles some score of\r\nyears, that I have studied the monumental and literary remains of the\r\nnations conquered, that, apart from the modern writings of both those\r\nwho believe and those who disbelieve, I have instituted comparisons\r\nand weighed evidence with no more desire to reach one conclusion than\r\nanother, except always to arrive at the right one; and that in my own\r\nmind I am well enough satisfied as to about the measure of truth that\r\nshould be accorded the respective writers of early New World annals.\r\nOthers, my assistants and friends, equally earnest and unbiassed,\r\nequally desirous of reaching only the truth, and for whose convictions\r\nI entertain the highest respect, have devoted many years to the same\r\nresearch and with similar results. It is not my purpose, nor has it ever\r\nbeen, to appear as the champion of the sixteenth-century chroniclers.\r\nIt is not my province to champion anything. It is a matter of profound\r\nindifference to me what these or those are proven to be, whether angels\r\nof light or devils of darkness; it is a matter of lively apprehension\r\nwith me that I should estimate men and nations at their value, and\r\ndeduce only truth from statements fair or false. While I entertain a\r\ndistinct conception of the status of the Aztecs and Quichés relatively\r\nto other nations of the globe, I have no theory concerning the origin of\r\nthe Americans, or the origin of their civilization—except that it seems\r\nto me indigenous rather than exotic; nor should I deem it wise in me to\r\nhusband a doctrine on this or any other palpably unprovable proposition.\r\n\r\nI am not prepared by any means to accept as truth all that has been\r\nsaid by priest and soldier. No one is readier than I to admit their\r\nfrequent attempted deceptions. Navigators the world over have been\r\nnotoriously untrue in regard to their discoveries, giving strange lands\r\nstrange sights, stocking barren shores with boundless wealth in pearls,\r\nand gems, and precious metals, peopling the ocean with monsters, and\r\nplacing islands, straits, continents, and seas wherever the gaping\r\nsavans at home would have them. Many of these stories are false on\r\ntheir very face, being contrary to nature and to reason. Some of them\r\nare unintentional falsehoods, the off-float from imaginations warped\r\nby education, and now morbidly excited under new conditions. By bodily\r\nsuffering and perils the mind was now and then reduced to the border of\r\ninsanity; at which times the miracles, the visions, and the supernatural\r\ninterpositions they record were real to them. But the best of the early\r\nwriters wilfully lied in some things, and held it serving God to do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the temptation and tendency was to exaggerate, to make the\r\nNew World conquest equal or superior to any Old World achievement;\r\nalthough assertions were at the first not open to contradiction, and\r\nthe sailors and soldiers of those times, returned from foreign parts,\r\nwere no more celebrated for telling the truth than those of our own day,\r\nyet in the main and as a whole the writings of the Spaniards earliest\r\nin America are unquestionably true. Most of the several phases of error\r\nand misstatement are easily enough detected, the events described being\r\neither impossible or opposed to preponderant and superior evidence.\r\nFor example, when Las Casas, who was conscientious and in the main\r\ncorrect, asserts that Manicaotex opposed Columbus at the head of\r\n100,000 warriors in Española, we may safely put it down as exaggeration\r\nsimply from our general knowledge, gained from other sources, of the\r\naboriginal population of these islands and the adjoining continent.\r\nHere was a multitude of witnesses, European and American, whose verbal\r\nor written statements were usually subordinate to substantial facts,\r\nunknown to each other, and giving their evidence at widely different\r\ntimes and places. Often the conquerors fell out and fought each other\r\nto the death, writing to Spain lengthy epistles of vindication and\r\nvilification, many of which have been preserved; so that where one\r\nextolled himself and his achievements, there were a dozen to pull him\r\ndown. Thus from a mass of contradictory statements, on either side\r\nof which the less penetrating are apt to linger, to the patient and\r\nlaborious investigator unfold the clearest truths. He who habitually\r\npractises deceit is sure somewhere to expose himself; and the taking of\r\nevidence does not proceed far before the examiner can tell the witness\r\nmore than he himself knows or remembers of the scenes through which he\r\nhas passed. The native witnesses, living at the time of the Conquest\r\nand subsequently, were likewise naturally inclined unduly to magnify\r\nthe glories of their ancestors and of their nation; yet to verify their\r\nstatements they point to the monuments and material remains then and now\r\nexisting, to manuscripts, huge piles of which it was the infamous boast\r\nof the fanatical conquerors to have burned, but of which enough have\r\nbeen preserved to authenticate all the more important parts of their\r\nstories; they also refer to tradition, which is worth as much, and no\r\nmore, than that of other nations.\r\n\r\nBlank assertions similar to those advanced against the New World\r\nchroniclers might with equal reason and effect be brought forward to\r\noverthrow the early records of any nation. Christ and Confucius may\r\nbe denied, Homer and Shakespeare, but that does not prove they never\r\nlived. That Columbus made his seamen swear that no doubt Cuba was\r\nZipangu, does not prove that there was in those days no Japan. Because\r\nDrake's chaplain chose to tell the most monstrous and wilful falsehoods\r\nrespecting the climate, metals, and inhabitants of California; because\r\nCook, Meares, and Vancouver sailed by the mouth of the Columbia,\r\nsuperciliously scourging those who had spoken of it, this does not prove\r\nthe non-existence of Marin County, or of the River of the West. In such\r\nways as these neither the truth of the one statement nor the falsity of\r\nthe other is established. But, as I have observed, before us is abundant\r\nevidence, palpable and incontestable, that the early writings on America\r\nare for the most part true; and if, in the following pages, it does\r\nnot clearly appear which are true and which false, then has the author\r\nsignally failed in his effort. I do not in the least fear the overthrow\r\nof the general veracity of these writers until there come against them\r\nenemies more powerful with more powerful weapons than any that have\r\nyet appeared. How senselessly speculative their reasonings! Because the\r\nnatives of the present day cannot tell who or whence were the authors\r\nof the carvings, or the builders of the structures upon whose ruins\r\nthey have gazed since childhood, these works must forsooth have been\r\ndone by foreign visitors. Europeans now and then may have found their\r\nway to America, but I find no evidence of such visits before the time\r\nof Columbus except by the Northmen; no one knows of such, nor can know\r\nuntil more light appears. The material relics, I fancy, will always\r\nprove a stumbling-block to those who would reject American aboriginal\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThat different conquerors, teachers, and travellers of various creeds\r\nand nationalities, in various pursuits, in different lands and at\r\nvarious times, together with native testimony, hieroglyphic writings,\r\nand traditions, to say nothing of carvings in stone and other monumental\r\nremains, should all combine, with satanic inspiration, to perpetrate\r\nupon the world one grand and overwhelming fraud is so preposterously\r\nridiculous that the marvel is how there could be found, outside the\r\nwalls of a lunatic asylum, a single individual with cool impudence\r\nenough to ask men to believe it. And yet there are several such,\r\nand they find believers. So charmed by the sound of their own voice\r\nare these captious cavillers, that they apparently do not deem it\r\npossible for such things to exist in this enlightened age as pedantic\r\nignorance and literary fanaticism, of which they are bright examples.\r\nThey do not seem to know that the petty and puerile theories which\r\nthey would pass upon the simple as startling conceptions, original\r\nwith themselves, are as old as the knowledge of the continent. They\r\ndo not consider that before taking the first step toward proving\r\norigin, migration, or kinship by analogy, they must first dispose of\r\nthe universal relationship of man, the oneness of human nature, human\r\nneeds, and human aspirations, and then show how men first came upon this\r\nearth, and which was land and which water then and since. But those\r\nwho thus array themselves against American aboriginal civilization\r\nand the early Spanish writers on the New World do not pretend to\r\noffer counter evidence, or to refute with reason; they rely chiefly\r\non flat contradiction. I have yet to find among them all any approach\r\nto reasonable propositions or logical argument. They have nothing\r\non which to base argument, neither fact nor plausible supposition.\r\nTheir hypotheses are as chimerical as their deductions are false.\r\nThey would have the world exercise a far more irrational credulity in\r\naccepting their hollow negations, than in believing every word of the\r\nmost mendacious chronicler. And when they come to deny the presence\r\nof a native civilization upon the Mexican table-land, they betray\r\nlamentable ignorance both of the facts of history and of the nature of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF SANTA MARÍA DE LA ANTIGUA DEL DARIEN.\r\n\r\n1510-1511.\r\n\r\n     FRANCISCO PIZARRO ABANDONS SAN SEBASTIAN—MEETS ENCISO AT\r\n     CARTAGENA—HE AND HIS CREW LOOK LIKE PIRATES—THEY ARE TAKEN\r\n     BACK TO SAN SEBASTIAN—VASCO NUÑEZ DE BALBOA—BOARDS ENCISO'S\r\n     SHIP IN A CASK—ARRIVES AT SAN SEBASTIAN—THE SPANIARDS CROSS\r\n     TO DARIEN—THE RIVER AND THE NAME—CEMACO, CACIQUE OF DARIEN,\r\n     DEFEATED—FOUNDING OF THE METROPOLITAN CITY—PRESTO, CHANGE!\r\n     THE HOMBRE DEL CASCO UP, THE BACHILLER DOWN—VASCO NUÑEZ,\r\n     ALCALDE—NATURE OF THE OFFICE—REGIDOR—COLMENARES, IN SEARCH\r\n     OF NICUESA, ARRIVES AT ANTIGUA—HE FINDS HIM IN A PITIABLE\r\n     PLIGHT—ANTIGUA MAKES OVERTURES TO NICUESA—THEN REJECTS HIM—AND\r\n     FINALLY DRIVES HIM FORTH TO DIE—SAD END OF NICUESA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alonso de Ojeda left San Sebastian for Española, he stipulated\r\nwith Francisco Pizarro, who for the time was commissioned governor,\r\nthat should neither he himself return, nor the bachiller Enciso arrive\r\nwithin fifty days, the colonists might abandon the post and seek safety\r\nor adventure in other parts.\r\n\r\nAnd now the fifty days had passed; wearily and hungrily they had come\r\nand gone, with misery an ever present guest; and no one having come,\r\nthey dismantled the fortress, placed on board the two small brigantines\r\nleft them the gold they had secured—trust Francisco Pizarro for scenting\r\ngold, and getting it—and made ready to embark for Santo Domingo. But\r\nthough only seventy remained, the vessels could not carry them all; and\r\nit was agreed that they should wait awhile, until death reduced their\r\nnumber to the capacity of the boats.\r\n\r\nNor had they long to wait; nor would their grim attendant let them put\r\nto sea without him. He had been so long domiciled with them, and had\r\nbecome so useful in settling disputes, adjusting accounts, and the like,\r\nthat he was one of them, and one, indeed, with all the companies which\r\nattempted colonization on these pestilential shores. As they coasted\r\neastward in search of food before steering across for Española, a squall\r\nstruck the vessels, overturning one of them and sending all on board\r\nto swift destruction. Entering with the other the harbor of Cartagena,\r\nPizarro found there the tardy Enciso hunting his colony.\r\n\r\nNow the bachiller, beside possessing great learning, was a man of\r\nexperience, all the way from Spain; a man of keen intelligence and\r\npractical sagacity, his wits sharpened by the narrow-minded legal\r\nbigotry of a sixteenth-century Spanish lawyer. He must be of exceedingly\r\nready wit who could deceive the bachiller. It was scarcely to be\r\nexpected a man of his kidney should credit the stories of Ojeda's\r\nvisit to Santo Domingo, of the deputy governorship, and of the late\r\ndisaster; though honest Pizarro on this occasion told only the truth,\r\nand his companions vouched for it with all the feeble force of their\r\nhigh-keyed husky voices. If Ojeda had gone to Santo Domingo more than\r\nfifty or seventy days before, would not the bachiller have seen him\r\nthere? Indeed, to a less erudite judge than Enciso, a band of robbers\r\non the high seas, with an abundance of gold and no bread, would call up\r\nsuspicions rather of foul play than honest adventure. And back they must\r\ngo. The functions of high judge should begin here and now. Was not this\r\nNueva Andalucía? With the horrors of San Sebastian still fresh in their\r\nminds, the thought of returning there was repugnant in the extreme,\r\nand the poor wretches begged the lawyer to let them go to Española,\r\nor join Nicuesa. No. Enciso had staked his whole earthly possessions\r\non the delightful prospect of domination, and these should not escape\r\nhim. They were just the clay for his fashioning; men for whom the law\r\nwas made. Whipping out his commission, which at once deposed Pizarro,\r\nthe bachiller drove them back into their boat, and all embarked for San\r\nSebastian. But scarcely had they turned the Punta de Caribana,[VII-1]\r\nwhen the bachiller's well-stored ship struck upon rocks and broke in\r\npieces, those on board barely escaping with their lives. Thus the worthy\r\nbachiller was beggared; the savings from life-long pettifoggings were\r\nswept away within the hour. Still his original stock in trade, egotism\r\nand arrogance, was left unimpaired.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NUEVA ANDALUCÍA]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADMINISTRATION OF ENCISO.]\r\n\r\nMaking their way along the shore to San Sebastian, the Spaniards found\r\ntheir fort demolished and their houses, some thirty in number, burned.\r\nIn a feeble way they began to forage again, but even Enciso saw that\r\nit was useless. The absence of food, the poisoned arrows, and the\r\npoisoned air were too much for the bravest long to contend with. \"Let\r\nus leave this accursed spot,\" they all cried. \"Whither would you go?\"\r\ndemanded the lawyer. One of them said:—\"Once when I coasted this gulf\r\nwith Rodrigo de Bastidas, along the western shore we found the country\r\nfertile and rich in gold. Provisions were abundant; and the natives,\r\nthough warlike, used no poisoned arrows. Through this land of which I\r\nspeak flows a river called by the natives Darien.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VASCO NUÑEZ DE BALBOA.]\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon the speaker. It was the _hombre del casco_,\r\nVasco Nuñez de Balboa, a fine specimen of the Spanish cavalier, at that\r\ntime about thirty-five years of age. He was taller than Ojeda, though\r\nperhaps not stronger; there was not about him the assurance of breeding\r\nand position that Nicuesa bore; nor were there present in his features\r\nthose marks of greed and brutality plainly discernible in the face\r\nof Francisco Pizarro, who stood not far from him. Strong and comely\r\nin every part, apparently, of body and mind, one to be observed with\r\nintuitive respect in a society of this kind, one to be approached with\r\nease, but with due care; frank and manly, with a firm and winning eye\r\nand manner, yet there was about him noticeable something between shyness\r\nand reticence. Indeed, the standing of this person, since his sudden\r\nand altogether informal appearing as one of the present company had been\r\nsomewhat dubious, and he seemed to regard it good taste to hold himself\r\nrather in the background. For all this there was that innate superiority\r\nabout him over every one present, not excepting the erudite judge or\r\nthe subsequently cunning conqueror of Peru, that could not always remain\r\nconcealed, particularly amid constantly recurring vital issues.\r\n\r\nOf the invariable poor but noble family, a native of Jerez de\r\nlos Caballeros, Vasco Nuñez was reared in the service of Pedro\r\nPuertocarrero, the deaf lord of Moguer. Drawn with the crowd to the\r\nNew World, upon the abrupt termination of the voyage of Bastidas, he\r\nobtained a repartimiento of Indians, and applied himself to agriculture\r\nat Salvatierra, a town of Española. Becoming embarrassed by debts,\r\nand disgusted with the plodding life of a farmer, he determined to\r\ntry fortune in the new colony of Alonso de Ojeda. But how to escape\r\nhis creditors was the question. Debtors were prohibited by edict from\r\nleaving the island. The town of Santo Domingo at this time swarmed\r\nwith insolvent adventurers anxious to engage in new adventure, and the\r\nstrictest watch was kept on them by the authorities. An armed escort\r\naccompanied every departure until well out at sea, to bring back\r\ndiscovered stowaways. For all this Vasco Nuñez determined to sail with\r\nEnciso. Now mark the budding of genius! Taking a large cask, such as\r\nwas used in shipping stores, he ensconced himself therein, and caused\r\nit to be headed up, placed upon a wagon, and driven from his farm to the\r\nlanding, where it was placed with the other stores, and finally carried\r\non board the ship. The vessel put to sea; the tender returned to port;\r\nto the creditors was left the farm of Vasco Nuñez, while the late owner\r\nwas forever safe beyond their reach.[VII-2]\r\n\r\nWhen, like Aphrodite from her circling shell, the serio-comic face\r\nof the bankrupt farmer appeared emerging from the provision cask, the\r\nbachiller was disposed to treat the matter magisterially, and threatened\r\nto land the refugee from justice on the first deserted island. But as\r\nthe learned judge could not be held accountable as a party to the fraud,\r\nand as he thereby gained a valuable recruit, his judicial sensitiveness\r\nwas finally mollified, and he assigned to the stowaway the ordinary\r\nduties of a soldier. Nevertheless the mildly murderous threat of the\r\nlawyer was not lost upon the farmer.\r\n\r\nInto the hearts of the desponding colonists at San Sebastian the words\r\nof Vasco Nuñez infused new life. No time was lost in making ready; and\r\ncrossing the gulf, they found the country and river as he had said. Near\r\nthis river of Darien,[VII-3] for so the Atrato and country thereabout\r\nwas then called, stood the village of the cacique, Cemaco, a brave and\r\nupright ruler.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE OF ANTIGUA.]\r\n\r\nEnciso, who is no less valiant than wise and conscientious, determines\r\nto make this place judicially his own. Cemaco, who believes himself the\r\nlegal owner, objects. Whereupon is invoked that admirable provision,\r\nthe ultimate appeal; and the man of the long robe and the man of no\r\nrobe at all, each after his fashion, prepare for war. Sending his women\r\nand children up the river, Cemaco posts himself with five hundred\r\nwarriors before the village. Enciso, in whose person are united the\r\ncombined essences of Christendom, civil, ecclesiastical, and military,\r\nconcentrates all his forces, human and divine, to hurl upon the\r\npresumptuous savage. First, as is his wont in legal battles, to every\r\nsoldier he administers the oath that he will not flinch before the\r\nenemy; then he invokes the powers above to aid him in the approaching\r\ncontest, vowing that if victory shall be his and the town shall fall\r\ninto his hands he will name it in honor of the virgin and build and\r\ndedicate a church within the town in honor of her sacred image, Antigua\r\nof Seville. Moreover, he promises that he will make a pilgrimage to\r\nher holy shrine if she will give him the victory over Cemaco; and with\r\nthese preparations the battle begins. The half-starved Spaniards fight\r\nlike fiends. Cemaco for a time maintains his position with firmness;\r\nbut the awe-inspiring appearance of the strangers, their ship, their\r\nshining armor, their beards, the whiteness of their skin, the wonderful\r\nsharpness of their weapons, and the solemn thunder and smoke of their\r\nfire-arms soon scatter to the forest his terror-smitten people. To\r\nthe unbounded joy of the conquerors the town is found rich in gold and\r\ncotton, and the adjacent fields afford abundance of provisions.\r\n\r\nThis is something like reward for toilsome missionary labors. Along the\r\nriver banks, secreted in caves, are found golden ornaments to the value\r\nof ten thousand castellanos.[VII-4] The virgin's share and the king's\r\nshare are set aside, and the remainder of the spoils divided among the\r\nband. Thus Cemaco's village becomes the seat of government in Tierra\r\nFirme; and to it, as the lawyer promised the virgin, is given the name\r\nof Santa María de la Antigua del Darien.[VII-5]\r\n\r\nIn good truth fortune had at length smiled upon the colonists. Captives\r\ntaken in the skirmishes which followed the pitched battle were made\r\nto gather gold and work in the fields. The bachiller began a rigorous\r\nrule with a full sense of the responsibilities resting upon him as\r\nrepresentative of the crown of Spain and of his own importance before\r\nhis soldiers, and as a hero in the great work of pacification. This\r\nview of his own merits appeared to him by no means diminished after his\r\nrecent success. Though small in number, this colony should be mighty\r\nin law. Poor Ojeda! How happy he might have been in the position now\r\noccupied by this mummified bundle of quiddities.\r\n\r\nSettling themselves in Cemaco's houses, the Spaniards began to look\r\nabout. First in order after his lawless raid, in the eyes of Enciso,\r\nwas law. The bachiller, as we have ere this surmised, was one of\r\nthose super-wise and self-opinioned men who to achieve a fall have\r\nonly to attain a height. Very little law was here needed, very little\r\ngovernment; but Enciso was a lawyer and a ruler, and little of it would\r\nnot suffice him. His first edict was the prohibition of private traffic\r\nwith the natives. This measure, though strictly legal, could scarcely be\r\ncalled politic. The hundred or so ragged piratical wretches cast on this\r\nrich and feebly defended shore wanted few decrees; and the fewer laws\r\ntheir ruler made for them the fewer would be broken. But, necessary or\r\nnot, the alcalde mayor must issue orders, else he is no alcalde mayor.\r\nHence other regulations followed, equally unpopular, until the colonists\r\nbegan to consider how best they might make a plug which should stop this\r\ngreat running to waste of law. Though convinced that Enciso was planning\r\nto get the gold as well as the government all into his own hands, and\r\nemploy the colonists as tools wherewith to mine, and hold the savages\r\nin check, so inbred is Spanish loyalty, that even the reckless members\r\nof this crude commonwealth hesitated before committing any overt act\r\nwhich might forever outlaw them from their country. Better employ his\r\nown weapon against the bachiller, for law is safer than hemp for hanging\r\neven lawyers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VASCO NUÑEZ ASSUMES COMMAND.]\r\n\r\nThere was about Vasco Nuñez a plain directness of thought and purpose\r\nthe very opposite of those engendered of the law's entanglements. Ever\r\nsince his fortunate suggestion to cross from San Sebastian to Darien\r\nhe had been regarded as the savior of the colony; and now he thought\r\nhe saw open a way of deliverance from their present trouble, and so he\r\ntold them. \"The gulf of Urabá,\" said he, \"separates Nueva Andalucía\r\nfrom Castilla del Oro. While on the eastern side we belonged to the\r\ngovernment of Alonso de Ojeda; now that we are on the western, we\r\nare subject only to Diego de Nicuesa.\" Before this simple logic the\r\nbachiller was dumfoundered. Of what value was legal lore that could\r\nbe so easily overturned by an illiterate adventurer? In vain he feebly\r\nargued that wherever was Ojeda's colony, Ojeda's deputy was master. The\r\npeople were against him; and the opinion of the people concerning him\r\nwas expressed by Vasco Nuñez when some time afterward he wrote the king\r\nregarding persons of that cloth in infant settlements: \"Most powerful\r\nsire,\" he said, \"there is one great favor that I pray your royal\r\nhighness to do me, since it is of great importance to your service. It\r\nis for your royal highness to issue an order that no bachiller of laws,\r\nor of anything unless it be of medicine, shall come to these parts\r\nof Tierra Firme, under a heavy penalty that your highness shall fix;\r\nbecause no bachiller ever comes hither who is not a devil, and they all\r\nlive like devils, and not only are they themselves bad, but they make\r\nothers bad, having always contrivances to bring about litigations and\r\nvillainies. This is very important to your highness' service in this a\r\nnew country.\"[VII-6]\r\n\r\nSo the lawyer was deposed, and the cavalier elevated. Enciso gracelessly\r\nyielded his clear authority; and after much wrangling among the\r\nill-assorted fraternity, a municipality was decided upon, and two\r\nalcaldes[VII-7] were chosen, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa and Martin Zamudio.\r\nThe office of regidor[VII-8] fell among others to one Valdivia.\r\nSubsequently additional officials were chosen.\r\n\r\nGovernment without law, however, proved no less ineffectual than law\r\nwithout government. Disaffections and altercations continued. In the\r\nadministration of justice, Balboa was accused of favoring his friends\r\nand frowning upon his enemies. Some repented having crossed the gulf;\r\nsome desired the restoration of Enciso; some suggested that as they were\r\nnow within the jurisdiction of Nicuesa, it was his right to rule, or to\r\nname their ruler.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLMENARES COMES.]\r\n\r\nWhile these strifes were raging, the inhabitants of Antigua were\r\nstartled one day by the report of a gun coming from the direction of\r\nSan Sebastian. Thinking perhaps Ojeda had returned, or sent supplies,\r\nthey built fires on the adjacent heights in order to attract attention.\r\nPresently two ships approached, and anchored before the town. They\r\nproved to be vessels belonging to Nicuesa, freighted at Española with\r\nsupplies for the colony of Castilla del Oro, and commanded by Rodrigo\r\nEnriquez de Colmenares. Thrown by stress of weather upon the coast of\r\nSanta Marta,[VII-9] he had there lost a number of his men; after which\r\nhe entered the gulf of Urabá, hoping to find information of Nicuesa.\r\n\r\nA quick observer and a faithful officer, Colmenares soon understood\r\nthe position of affairs, and took prompt measures to secure to his\r\ngovernor such advantages as might accrue from profitless contentions. By\r\na judicious distribution of articles greatly needed by the colonists,\r\nattended by wise counsels, he gained their confidence, and partly\r\nhealed their feuds; so that before sailing he prevailed on them to send\r\ntwo ambassadors to treat with Nicuesa concerning the affairs of their\r\nsettlement. The two envoys chosen were Diego de Albites, and an aspiring\r\nlawyer, hitherto overshadowed by the august presence of Enciso, called\r\nthe bachiller Diego del Corral, and they were directed to accompany the\r\nships of Colmenares in the brigantine belonging to the settlement of\r\nAntigua.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of November, 1510, when Colmenares entered the\r\ngulf of Urabá. Unable to gather any tidings of Nicuesa, he continued\r\nhis voyage westward, searching the inlets along the coast. He would\r\nnevertheless have passed Nombre de Dios had he not seen some of\r\nNicuesa's men in their boat, at one of the islands, seeking food. The\r\nwildest joy greeted the new arrival. It was to the colony of Castilla\r\ndel Oro as a reprieve from death. Gazing sadly on the sallow faces\r\nand emaciated forms before them, the miserable wreck of Nicuesa's\r\ngallant company now reduced to sixty souls, listening to their tales\r\nof wretchedness, tears of honest sympathy fell from the eyes of the\r\nhardy sailors. With difficulty could be recognized in the leader of\r\nthe hapless troop the once gay and courtly Nicuesa. Colmenares gave\r\nthe sufferers food and comforted them. He told Nicuesa of Ojeda's\r\nfailure, of the settlement at Antigua, and how Enciso and his company,\r\nhaving found a spot rich in gold and well provisioned, had fallen to\r\nquarrelling among themselves about the government, and had finally\r\nsent messengers to him, the rightful ruler, for the healing of their\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\nTo Nicuesa these words were as fresh oil in an expiring lamp. But in\r\nhis enfeebled state, the sudden change from blank despair to brilliant\r\nhope played havoc with his discretion. After brief thanksgiving for\r\ndeliverance, his mind became excited by dreams of boundless wealth and\r\nempire. He ordered a feast, at which he presided with insensate levity.\r\nToward the ambassadors from the gulf he assumed a haughty arrogance,\r\nclaiming supreme authority relative to all matters at Antigua, and\r\nstoutly swearing that the gold taken from his subjects of Darien should\r\nbe disgorged.\r\n\r\nColmenares had marked the effect of Nicuesa's altered temper on his\r\nfollowers. He saw that disaffection was rife, and that the governor held\r\ncontrol by a feeble thread. Showing Nicuesa the madness of his course,\r\nhe explained the importance of attaching the remnant of Ojeda's colony\r\nto his own, and pointed out their strength and his weakness; he received\r\nin reply only insolent rebukes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the ambassadors Albites and Corral, men whose wits were about\r\nthem, were not pleased with this foretaste of Nicuesa's rule; nor did\r\nintercourse with Nicuesa's men tend in any wise to diminish their\r\nunfavorable impressions. One night they visited Lope de Olano, who\r\nfor his sins was chained to a rock and made to grind corn. \"Behold my\r\ncondition,\" he exclaimed. \"I have ever served my governor faithfully. I\r\nsaved him from perishing, when I had but to delay his rescue to become\r\nmyself the governor. This is my reward. You men of Antigua may draw\r\nyour own conclusions.\" By others the ambassadors were informed that\r\nthe chief officers of the new government were already selected: Vasco\r\nNuñez was to be stripped of all authority, and Zamudio, as a relative\r\nof Olano, could scarcely hope to fare better. Those who had trafficked\r\nwith the natives were to be severely punished. It was enough. Stealing\r\naway, they hastened back to Antigua. \"A pretty mess you have made of it,\r\nwith your infernal bickerings,\" they said to the assembled confederates.\r\n\"Nicuesa will give you more of law than Enciso, and more of arbitrary\r\nrule than Vasco Nuñez and Zamudio ten times over.\" A few days after\r\na messenger, one Juan de Caicedo, arrived from Nicuesa, and informed\r\nthem, for their further comfort, that the governor was detained at\r\none of the islands capturing natives, but would be with them shortly.\r\nPerceiving that his tidings were not hailed with transports of joy, and\r\nbeing himself embittered against Nicuesa, as were indeed almost all his\r\nfollowers, Caicedo swung round upon his bearings and laughed at them.\r\n\"Silly señores! free and rich, you call in a cormorant to swallow your\r\nsubstance and yourselves.\" And now, as usual when folly comes home,\r\ncurses flowed freely on themselves and others. The prospect of losing\r\ntheir gold touched them. What should they do?\r\n\r\nOnce more Vasco Nuñez offers a pertinent suggestion. \"You were\r\ndissatisfied with Enciso, and questioned many of my acts. Now you fear\r\na governor possessing all the bad qualities of your former rulers,\r\nwith, perhaps, few of their redeeming traits. If calling Nicuesa was an\r\nerror, is not receiving him a greater one?\" Struck by the suggestion,\r\nthe colonists drop their differences and unite as one man against\r\nNicuesa, each taking a solemn oath never to serve under him. Sentries\r\nare then stationed to give notice of his approach, and measures taken\r\nto prevent his landing. After eight days pleasantly passed kidnapping\r\namong the islands, the ill-fated governor enters the harbor and comes\r\nto anchor, little dreaming of the reception that awaits him. On shore\r\nbefore the town he observes a company of armed men, assembled, as he\r\nsupposes, to give him welcome. As he prepares to disembark, the public\r\nprocurator[VII-10] advances and, to his astonishment, in a loud voice\r\nwarns him on pain of death not to place foot on shore, but instantly to\r\nabandon these parts and return no more.\r\n\r\nThe colony at Antigua was at this time comparatively strong and\r\nwell-conditioned; Nicuesa's followers were few, weak, and disaffected.\r\nFor him to enforce authority was not possible. His mind had dwelt\r\nfondly of late on his rising fortunes, and this hostile reception was a\r\nterrible disappointment, for it was the last earthly resource. To return\r\nto the broken camp at Nombre de Dios would be to enter again the jaws\r\nof death; if he could not remain here, he certainly could not depart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ILL-TREATMENT OF NICUESA.]\r\n\r\nRecovering in a measure, as from a heavy blow, the governor requested\r\npermission to land, promising solemnly to enter into any stipulations\r\nconcerning the government which the colonists should deem just. His\r\nproposals were drowned by the shouts of the rabble; and he was warned,\r\nas he valued his life, to approach no nearer the shore. Nicuesa\r\ncontinued his expostulations till nightfall, when he retired with his\r\nship a little farther from land. Returning next morning, he renewed his\r\nimportunities. A change had apparently taken place in the minds of the\r\npeople, for he was now permitted to land with his page. Balboa received\r\nthe governor courteously, conducted him to his house, and made him a\r\nguest for the night. The affairs of the government were discussed, and\r\nan amicable understanding was arrived at by the two leaders. It was\r\nnothing less, in fact, than that one of them should be first, and the\r\nother second, in Castilla del Oro. On the following day a portion of\r\nthe crew on board Nicuesa's ship was permitted to land; and Vasco Nuñez\r\nnow endeavored to reconcile his comrades to the rule of the governor.\r\nIt was too late. Sedition is more easily raised than allayed. Not only\r\nwas Zamudio jealous of his colleague, but he well knew that under the\r\nproposed regime the odium of all the opposition would fall on him.\r\nDrawing round him the rougher element, he reminded the colonists of\r\ntheir oath, and pictured to them the poverty and restraint under the\r\nproposed government. So successful was he in exciting bad blood, that\r\nNicuesa was glad to escape insult and violence by retiring to his ship.\r\nThus encouraged, Zamudio resolved to press a final issue by capturing\r\nthe governor, and dictating terms to him. The next day accordingly\r\nhe placed his men in ambush near the landing, and with one companion,\r\nPedro Macaz, appeared before the ship. Hailing the commander, he assured\r\nhim that all was well, and that he now might safely venture on shore.\r\nNicuesa fell easily into the trap. Joining the conspirators, he walked\r\nunsuspiciously with them toward the spot where the gang lay concealed.\r\nWhen near it Zamudio changed his tone to one of harsh insolence, \"Señor\r\nNicuesa,\" he said, \"why do you persist in remaining here contrary\r\nto our wishes? Your presence is our ruin. We can neither accept you,\r\nnor abandon this place. You must depart instantly, or die. Take your\r\nchoice.\" Meanwhile his minions sprang forward. Nicuesa saw it all at a\r\nglance. He was fleet of foot, and this was his only hope. So flinging\r\noff dignity, he eluded their clutches, dashed off at the top of his\r\nspeed along the shore, and outstripping his pursuers, turned into the\r\nforest to hide.\r\n\r\nWhen Vasco Nuñez saw the desperate plight to which Nicuesa was reduced,\r\nall the generous impulses of his nature were aroused. He hated himself\r\nfor the part he had played, and cursed the sordid ambition which thus\r\nunjustly humiliated so chivalrous a gentleman. More in earnest than\r\never, he sought out Nicuesa in the wood; and then endeavored to excite\r\nthe sympathies of the colonists, and even to intimidate them; but all\r\nwas of no avail. Those there were who well knew they had gone too far\r\never to be forgiven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAD FATE OF NICUESA.]\r\n\r\nSatan now wholly possessed Zamudio. No fiend could ever invent and\r\nexecute a more dastardly measure than was now proposed. With sixty men\r\nhe entered the forest, seized Nicuesa, and made him swear instantly to\r\nsail for Spain, touching no port till he should reach Cádiz. Then, as\r\nif in mockery, he took from him his only serviceable ship, placed him\r\ninto the old brigantine, now rotten and unsafe, which had been in use at\r\nVeragua, and sent him forth with seventeen men and a few devoted members\r\nof his household. It was in March, 1511, that the so lately proud and\r\ngallant Nicuesa was thus driven from Antigua, and neither he nor any of\r\nthat ill-fated company was ever afterward heard from![VII-11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFACTIONS AND FORAGINGS IN DARIEN.\r\n\r\n1511-1513.\r\n\r\n     THE GARRISON AT NOMBRE DE DIOS—SUBTLE DIPLOMACIES—VASCO NUÑEZ\r\n     ASSUMES COMMAND—ENCISO, HIS LIFE AND WRITINGS—THE TOWN AND\r\n     THE JAIL—RIGHTS OF SANCTUARY—VALDIVIA'S VOYAGE—ZAMUDIO'S\r\n     MISSION—EXPEDITION TO COIBA—CARETA GIVES VASCO NUÑEZ HIS\r\n     DAUGHTER—PONCA PUNISHED—JURA, THE SAVAGE STATESMAN—VISIT OF\r\n     THE SPANIARDS TO COMAGRE—PANCIACO TELLS THEM OF A SOUTHERN\r\n     SEA—THE STORY OF VALDIVIA, WHO IS SHIPWRECKED AND EATEN BY\r\n     CANNIBALS—VASCO NUÑEZ UNDERTAKES AN IMPIOUS PILGRIMAGE TO THE\r\n     GOLDEN TEMPLE OF DABAIBA—CONSPIRACY FORMED BY THE NATIVES TO\r\n     DESTROY ANTIGUA—FULVIA DIVULGES THE PLOT—DARIEN QUIETED—VASCO\r\n     NUÑEZ RECEIVES A ROYAL COMMISSION—SERIOUS CHARGES—VASCO NUÑEZ\r\n     RESOLVES TO DISCOVER THE SOUTHERN SEA BEFORE HE IS PREVENTED\r\n     BY ARREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far the first decade of disaster along Tierra Firme; thus far the\r\ndiscovery of Rodrigo de Bastidas in 1501; the ineffectual attempt of\r\nColumbus at Veragua in 1502; the failure of the impetuous Ojeda, and\r\nthe death of the veteran pilot, Juan de la Cosa; the founding of Nombre\r\nde Dios and Antigua; the destruction of the superb armament of Diego\r\nde Nicuesa, and the sad fate of its commander. Meanwhile we behold\r\nevolved from the factions of Antigua two notable characters, Francisco\r\nPizarro and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa. We will now further observe society\r\nin Darien, and the attempts of the Spaniards to govern themselves and\r\npacify their neighbors.\r\n\r\nWhen Diego de Nicuesa embarked to assume command at Antigua, he left\r\nin the fortress of Nombre de Dios a small garrison under Gonzalo de\r\nBadajoz, with Alonso Nuñez de Madrid as alcalde. Their provisions\r\nfalling low, and expected relief failing them, like ill-mannered wolves\r\nthey fell to fighting over the little remaining food, and but for the\r\nopportune arrival of Colmenares, civilization at Nombre de Dios would\r\nsoon have found a miserable ending. To the proposal to join their\r\ncountrymen at Antigua, they eagerly assented, and embarked without delay\r\nin the two brigantines sent for the purpose. Lope de Olano was released,\r\nand subsequently rose high in the esteem of Balboa. Thus the settlement\r\nof Antigua, after the departure of the hapless Nicuesa, comprised all\r\nthat was left of the two colonies of Nueva Andalucía and Castilla del\r\nOro, and numbered about two hundred and fifty men.[VIII-1]\r\n\r\nThe final disappearance of the two commanders by no means allayed the\r\ndiscords of the colony. Factions assumed broader dimensions than ever.\r\nA band of two hundred and fifty bears, after accomplishing the duties\r\nof the day, would sensibly stretch themselves under the welcome covert;\r\nbut intellectual and moral beasts are, by reason of their superiority,\r\ndoomed to the eternal curse of government; nor does it make much\r\ndifference as to the quality or quantity of the herd; fools will fight\r\nfor domination all the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEEP DIPLOMACIES.]\r\n\r\nZamudio, followed by the gang that had driven out Nicuesa, claims\r\npreëminence as a reward for his villainies. Enciso, the learned and\r\ndisinterested representative of the higher orders of mastership, earthly\r\nand heavenly, never fails to keep the high and holy law spread before\r\nthese misguided men. Vasco Nuñez keeps his own counsel; but he feels\r\nwithin himself that neither Zamudio nor Enciso shall rule Antigua. All\r\nhe need do is to continue as hitherto to turn against his opponents\r\ntheir own weapons. The lawyer he vanquishes with law; the ruffian, by\r\ngiving him a rope wherewith to hang himself. In the present instance,\r\nlike a skilful tactician, he separates his antagonists and opposes\r\none to the other. Calling Zamudio aside, he makes evident to him the\r\nnecessity, if he would continue a municipal government, of withholding\r\nall power from the bachiller. Having no intention of relinquishing\r\nthe sweets of office, for which he has risked so much, Zamudio lends\r\na willing ear. The lawyer must be quieted, but lawfully. High-handed\r\nmeasures may be employed, but only exceptionally. The law is too useful\r\na weapon to be flung aside by intelligent knaves. So the two alcaldes\r\nput their heads together and frame charges to fit the occasion. Enciso\r\nis accused of wilful usurpation of authority, of assuming the duties\r\nand exercising the functions of alcalde mayor without license from the\r\nking—grave charges, truly, emanating from so scrupulous a society.\r\nThe lawyer's skill at pleading avails him nothing. He is convicted,\r\nhis property confiscated, and himself cast into prison.[VIII-2] He\r\nis not long kept in confinement, however, but is set free on giving a\r\npromise immediately to leave the country.[VIII-3] Thus one of the two\r\nambitious Cæsars is out of the way; but how dispose of the other? Again\r\nVasco Nuñez draws Zamudio aside and expresses a fear that the enraged\r\nbachiller, once in Spain, will stir up the king against them, and\r\nenter false statements before the tribunal of the Indies regarding the\r\nquality of justice dispensed by the alcaldes of Antigua. \"Would it not\r\nbe well,\" continues Balboa, \"for one of us to accompany the bachiller?\r\nand thus, while misrepresentations may be promptly refuted, we may at\r\nthe same time secure our government upon a more substantial basis.\"\r\nZamudio sees this necessity, and is finally induced to accept the\r\ncommission. Thus Vasco Nuñez is left to reign alone; and every effort\r\nis made by him firmly to secure his government. While cementing his\r\nfriends, he conciliates his enemies; above all he strives to deal justly\r\nby everybody, and with fair success. By caring for their comfort and\r\nexercising strict impartiality in the division of spoils, he wins the\r\nhearts of the fighting men. Even Oviedo, who was not friendly to Balboa,\r\nsays: \"No chieftain who ever went to the Indies equalled him in these\r\nrespects.\" And yet, beneath the accumulating honors the recipient sits\r\nnot wholly at ease. \"No one need hope to rule this land,\" writes Vasco\r\nNuñez to the king, \"and sit or sleep; for if he sleep, he will never\r\nwake. Day and night I think only of your Majesty's interests. In every\r\nbattle I lead my men, and with truthful example, and kind treatment of\r\nthe natives, seek to bring into favor your Majesty's government in these\r\nparts.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the settlers were idle all this time, or\r\nthat the natives, or their gold, were neglected. The town had grown in\r\nsize and importance since the driving out of Cemaco. Streets had been\r\nregularly laid out round a _plaza_,[VIII-4] or public square, common to\r\nall Spanish towns, and a church and religious houses established, for\r\npriests had come hither with the rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENCISO AND THE ALCALDES.]\r\n\r\nWhile Enciso made ready for departure, Bachiller Corral, Captain\r\nBadajoz, and others, enemies of Balboa, improved the time by secretly\r\nmaking specifications of both the alcaldes' errors, and by instigating\r\nothers to assist in criminating the rulers. These charges were to be\r\ndelivered to the king by Enciso. Hearing of it, the alcaldes seized\r\nthe ringleaders and confined them in a pen,[VIII-5] the municipal jail,\r\nsituated in the middle of the plaza. But the prisoners escaped from the\r\ncage to the Franciscan monastery, and, claiming the protection of the\r\nsanctuary,[VIII-6] they were finally discharged.\r\n\r\nValdivia, the regidor, was Balboa's friend; before leaving the\r\nSalvatierra plantation they had been warmly intimate. Supplies were\r\nneeded, and Enciso and Zamudio required passage to Spain. Taking,\r\ntherefore, a small vessel, and placing in Valdivia's hands a large\r\namount of gold,[VIII-7] Vasco Nuñez sent him to Española, with\r\ninstructions to buy the good opinion of Diego Colon the governor,\r\nand Pasamonte[VIII-8] the king's treasurer, and bring back recruits.\r\nThe regidor was fairly successful. He set forth the wealth of Tierra\r\nFirme, and the important services of Vasco Nuñez in glowing colors,\r\nand obtained from the governor a commission authorizing Balboa to act\r\nas his lieutenant in those parts. He begged for his friend Pasamonte's\r\ninfluence with the king; but Enciso was active there with opposing\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Balboa was haunted by thoughts not of the happiest. He well\r\nknew how precarious was his tenure of position. Nicuesa's wrongs were\r\never before him. Though not the chief criminal in that affair, he knew\r\nhe was criminal enough. Yet before the deed was done, and since, he\r\nhad striven to make amends. \"Once, twice, three times,\" writes he to\r\nthe king, \"have I sent aid to Nicuesa's men, and saved them when dying\r\nat the rate of five and six a day.\" Then, too, he must confess having\r\ntreated poor Enciso somewhat shamefully; and the bachiller was stronger\r\nwhere there was more strength in the law; while Zamudio was not the same\r\nbefore the king as before his Antigua ruffians. There remained only one\r\ncourse. Action was the word. If he would play the great man, and rule\r\nothers, he must bestir himself to something nobler than political strife\r\nand demagogy at Antigua. Gold would help him; he thoroughly appreciated\r\nthe weakness of officials in that direction; but a notable adventure,\r\na great discovery, were better. At all events, upon whatever he should\r\ndecide, he must act immediately, before being deprived of his present\r\nmodicum of authority.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he would begin his career of greatness by assuming to be\r\ngreat. One is never nearer the truth than when one puts on humility and\r\ncurses one's self for an ass. Without offensive ostentation he assumed\r\nbecoming forms of dignity, took upon himself the title of governor,\r\nappointed officers, and drilled soldiers in the tactics of Indian\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE WITH CEMACO.]\r\n\r\nSome twenty leagues westerly from Antigua, adjoining the lands of\r\nCemaco, was an Indian province called Coiba, of which Careta[VIII-9]\r\nwas chief. The governor, being informed that Careta was rich in gold\r\nand maize, despatched thither a small company under Pizarro, whom\r\nhe had made captain. They were hardly on the march before Cemaco was\r\nencountered, at the head of four hundred men, all fired, like their\r\nchief, with ever-living rage. Never for an hour since the strangers\r\nlanded to seize their homes had the eyes of the savages been removed\r\nfrom them. It was hopeless to fight, naked as they were; yet for what\r\nhad they to live, with houses and lands and all their property taken\r\nfrom them? The mode of warfare, too, was against the natives; they did\r\nnot fight here, as at San Sebastian, with poisoned arrows shot from\r\nbehind rocks and trees, but engaged in hand-to-hand conflict, opposing\r\ntheir defenceless bodies to the steel weapons of the Spaniards, on\r\nwhose coats of mail their darts and clubs fell harmless. A fight ensued\r\nnevertheless, and fiercely it was waged. It is somewhat difficult to\r\nbelieve Herrera when he says that Pizarro had with him but six men,\r\nwho, when the four hundred closed with them, eviscerated one hundred\r\nand fifty savages, and put the remainder to flight. Hastening back to\r\nAntigua, leaving one man wounded on the field, Pizarro stood before\r\nthe governor exhausted and bleeding. Balboa's anger at the desertion\r\noverpowered for a moment his admiration for the desperate courage\r\ndisplayed by the little band, and turning to Pizarro, he said sharply,\r\n\"Go instantly and bring me Francisco Hernan, and, as you value your\r\nlife, never again leave one of my soldiers alive upon a field of\r\nbattle.\" Pizarro departed, and soon returned with his disabled comrade.\r\nBalboa immediately placed himself at the head of a hundred men, and\r\nstarted in pursuit of Cemaco, determined to extirpate the tribe; but,\r\nafter ascending the river for some distance and finding no enemy, he\r\nabandoned pursuit. Scarcely had he returned, when the two brigantines\r\nsent to Nombre de Dios for the remainder of Nicuesa's men made their\r\nappearance at Antigua. They brought no news of Nicuesa, greatly to the\r\ndisappointment of Balboa, who would now gladly have fortified himself\r\nin a less elevated position, and placed Antigua under the banner of the\r\nlawful governor of the territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPEDITION AGAINST CARETA.]\r\n\r\nFresh accounts of the wealth of Coiba, by this arrival, soon dispelled\r\nthe governor's misgivings, and turned his thoughts in other directions.\r\nIt seems that as the vessels were returning from Nombre de Dios, they\r\ntouched the shore of Coiba; and while there were greeted by two painted\r\nsavages in plain Castilian. The riddle was solved when the men told them\r\nthey were gentlemen renegades, escaped from Nicuesa's colony for fear\r\nof punishment for misdemeanor. After long and dangerous wanderings in\r\nthe wilderness, they had thrown themselves, half-dead, upon the mercy\r\nof Careta, who received them with gentle courtesy, bestowing food and\r\nevery kindness, which they were now ready to requite by betraying to\r\nthe Spaniards the cacique's treasures, for he was very rich.\r\n\r\nTo this act of treachery the Spanish yielded a prompt compliance, and\r\nwere ready for the adventure on the instant. Owing to their present\r\nweak condition Colmenares advised delay, and arranged that one of the\r\nmiscreants should go with them to Antigua, while the other remained\r\nwith Careta in readiness to betray him at the proper time. Nor had\r\nthe governor the least scruple in availing himself of this villainy.\r\nWith one hundred and thirty men he marched on Coiba, directing the\r\ntwo brigantines to meet him there. Acting under the direction of the\r\nfugitive whom he had made his confidant and counsellor, Careta went\r\nout to meet the Spaniards, brought them to his village, and entertained\r\nthem to the best of his ability. Balboa began with the modest request\r\nfor maize to fill his ships. Careta answered, that owing to war with\r\nhis ever hostile neighbor, Ponca, he had this year planted nothing, and\r\nhence had no surplus. Careta's Spanish friend assured his countrymen\r\nthat this was false, that the savage had abundance. It was enough. A\r\nheathen had lied to a Christian. Let the nation be anathema!\r\n\r\nBidding the chief a friendly farewell, with thanks for his hospitality,\r\nthe Spaniards took their departure as if for Antigua; but about midnight\r\nthey returned, attacked the village on three sides, slaughtered the\r\ninhabitants, burned the houses, loaded the brigantines with booty, and\r\ncarried Careta and his family prisoners to Antigua. \"Why should you do\r\nthis?\" asked Careta. \"How have I wronged you? Take my gold, but restore\r\nme to my country. And as a pledge of my good faith, there is my daughter\r\nwho shall remain a hostage in your hands. Take her and let us be\r\nfriends.\" The proposal pleased the governor, not less from the advantage\r\nof the alliance, than from the influence thrown over him by the charms\r\nof the dusky maiden, for she was very beautiful, and had already given\r\nher heart to the Christian chieftain. And thus according to the usage\r\nof her people she became his wife, though not wedded after the Spanish\r\nfashion; and Vasco Nuñez ever cherished her with fond affection.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the new allies with presents to their homes, care\r\nwas taken to excite their admiration by showing them the arms and\r\nimplements of civilization, and unfolding to them the doctrines of the\r\ntrue faith. These doctrines must have appeared in strange contrast to\r\nthe blood-thirsty deeds of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nA joint expedition against Ponca, in which Balboa participated with\r\neighty men, overran that chieftain's domain with great damage to him,\r\nand with some gain to the Spaniards in provisions and gold.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Careta's lands, on the seaboard to the west, were those\r\nof Comagre,[VIII-10] whose nation numbered ten thousand souls, and\r\nmustered three thousand warriors. Balboa visited him peaceably, upon the\r\narrangement of a friendly interview by a native _jura_, or official,\r\na deserter from Careta's council, who had become offended with his\r\nmaster, and joined Comagre. The jura was a statesman in a rude way, and\r\na diplomat. He knew of the Spaniards, of their fearful doings, and of\r\ntheir alliance with Careta; and being an honest, well-meaning savage\r\nwithal, he thought to avert disaster by interposing friendly relations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PANCIACO'S STORY.]\r\n\r\nWith a train of attendants, Comagre met his distinguished guest, and\r\nwith much ceremony conducted him to the palace,[VIII-11] which for size,\r\ndurability, and rude excellence, far exceeded anything the Spaniards\r\nhad seen in the New World. Among the numerous descendants of Comagre,\r\nfor he was much married, were seven sons, remarkable for their valor,\r\nand nobleness of demeanor. The eldest, Panciaco, united with a haughty\r\nbearing exceptional sagacity. He saw at once the superiority of steel\r\nweapons; he saw that the Spaniards coveted gold; and he thought he\r\nsaw an easy way open for purchasing their good-will. Collecting four\r\nthousand ounces of the metal finely wrought, he presented it with\r\nseventy slaves to the Spaniards, and watched the effect. The king's\r\nfifth was first solemnly set aside. Then they began to divide the\r\nremainder of the gold among themselves; and in this division arose\r\na dispute which made Panciaco's lip curl in scorn as he watched them\r\nweighing the stuff. Louder grew their altercations, which were followed\r\nby blows. Overcome at length by disgust, Panciaco darted forward and\r\nstruck the scales a violent blow which sent their precious contents\r\nflying. \"Why quarrel for such a trifle!\" he exclaimed. \"Is it for this\r\nyou leave your country, cross seas, endure hardships, and disturb the\r\npeace of nations? Cease your voracious brawl and I will tell where you\r\nmay obtain your fill of gold. Six days' march across yon mountain will\r\nbring you to an ocean sea, like this near which we dwell, where there\r\nare ships as large as yours, and cities, and wealth unbounded.\"\r\n\r\nForgetting in the matter the manner of the discourse, the Spaniards\r\nlistened with eager attention. \"How say you?\" said Vasco Nuñez.\r\n\"What proof have you of this?\" \"Listen to me,\" replied Panciaco. \"You\r\nChristians seem to prize this metal more than body, life, or soul; more\r\nthan love, hate, revenge. Some mysterious virtue it must possess to\r\ncharm men so! We who can not translate its subtle power, love better\r\nfriends, and sweet revenge. My father has an ancient enemy, Tubanamá,\r\nwho lives beyond the mountains fronting the other sea. From time\r\nimmemorial our people have fought his people; many have been killed on\r\neither side, and many enslaved. Could we for once bring low this hated\r\nTubanamá, no sacrifice would be too dear. Be yours the gold; give us\r\nrevenge. The path is difficult, the enemy fierce. One thousand Spaniards\r\nare none too many successfully to cope with him. Prepare your army. I\r\nmyself will accompany you with all the warriors of our nation; bind me\r\nfast; keep me in close custody; and if my words prove false, hang me\r\nto the nearest tree.\"[VIII-12] Vasco Nuñez pondered. The area of his\r\ndestiny seemed suddenly to have enlarged. If this the young man had\r\nsaid were true, and he might tap the mystery, and bring to the light\r\nof nations this other side of Tierra Firme, the temporary governor of a\r\nhandful of heterogeneous colonists might achieve everlasting fame as one\r\nof the world's great discoverers, and realize the dream of Columbus, to\r\nrule the Aurea Chersonesus of King Solomon. To him who can execute comes\r\nopportunity. \"God has revealed the secrets of this land to me only,\" he\r\npiously writes the 20th of January, 1513, \"and for this I never shall\r\ncease to thank him.\" But whence were to come the requisite one thousand\r\nmen? After closely interrogating Comagre, Careta, and other chieftains\r\nconcerning the tramontane regions, the Spaniards returned to Darien;\r\nbut not until many of the natives had renounced idolatry and received\r\nbaptism at the hands of the priests. There they found Valdivia returned\r\nfrom Santo Domingo, after an absence of six months, with a small store\r\nof provisions, and what was of the highest consequence to Vasco Nuñez at\r\nthis juncture, the commission from Diego Colon as governor of Antigua.\r\n\r\nTo guard against the scarcity of food which had thus far been one of\r\nthe chief causes of failure in every attempt to colonize Tierra Firme,\r\nthe governor had this year caused to be planted a large tract adjacent\r\nto Antigua, the labor of course being performed by captives. \"Food\r\nhas been our great necessity rather than gold,\" said Vasco Nuñez in a\r\nletter to the king. But a hurricane, followed by inundation, destroyed\r\nthe crop, and Valdivia was again sent with the caravel to Santo Domingo\r\nfor provisions. In a letter to Diego Colon, the governor set forth\r\nin extravagant terms his further knowledge of the country, dwelling\r\nupon the information received of a great sea to the southward, and\r\nbegging assistance in raising a thousand men for its discovery. Gold to\r\nthe value of fifteen thousand pesos[VIII-13] was, by this departure,\r\nremitted the king's officers as the royal share for the last six\r\nmonths. Large sums were also sent by private persons to their friends\r\nand creditors in Española and Spain. But all to no end. For when near\r\nJamaica, the vessel was struck by a squall, carried westward, and thrown\r\non some rocks off Yucatan. Ship and cargo were all lost. Twenty men,\r\nwithout water, or food, or sail, or oars, in an open boat, escaped with\r\nbare life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HORRIBLE FATE OF VALDIVIA.]\r\n\r\nAnd now comes another tale of wretchedness which might well grace the\r\nannals of Acheron. In their helpless condition they are carried by the\r\ncurrents for thirteen days; one third of their number die of thirst,\r\nand the survivors drift to a yet more horrible fate. Thrown on the Maya\r\nshore, they are seized by savages, placed in a pen, and well fed. After\r\ntheir sufferings at sea, this is not so bad; but one day Valdivia and\r\nfour others are taken to the temple and sacrificed, and their roasted\r\nlimbs eaten in honor of the gods; over which prospect for themselves\r\nthe survivors are uncomfortable, and nerved by desperation, they break\r\ncage and escape to the forest, where they wander naked and starving\r\nuntil life is a burden. Then they cast themselves at the feet of Ahkin\r\nXooc, cacique of Jamancana, neighbor and enemy of the Maya lord. He and\r\nhis successor, Taxmar, make them serve as beasts of burden until two\r\nonly are left alive, Gonzalo Guerrero, sailor, and Gerónimo de Aguilar,\r\nfriar. In an interchange of captives, the sailor becomes the property\r\nof Nachan Kan, chief of Chetumal. Bold and buoyant-hearted, he rises to\r\nbarbaric distinction, becomes a great general, marries a princess, and\r\nin after years, when opportunity offers, declines return to civilized\r\nlife. The friar is rescued by Cortés, in 1519, in which connection we\r\nshall again meet him.[VIII-14]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DABAIBA AND ITS GOLDEN TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nCannibals are horrible things; but their teeth were hardly so sharp\r\nas Spanish steel, which, in following the law of survival common to\r\nthe animal kingdom, was sacrificing freely about Antigua at this time.\r\n\"Thirty caciques have already been slain in the attempted pacification\r\nof this country,\" writes Vasco Nuñez to Diego Colon, \"and now that I\r\nam obliged to penetrate still further in search of food, I must kill\r\nall who fall into my hands; otherwise our colony can not exist while\r\nwaiting relief.\" In pursuance of this humane measure, early in 1512—it\r\nwas toward the close of 1511 that Valdivia had sailed for Española—the\r\ngovernor organized an expedition against Dabaiba,[VIII-15] a rich\r\nprovince some thirty leagues to the southward.\r\n\r\nStartling stories were told of this place. At a temple lined with gold,\r\nslaves were sacrificed for the gratification of the gods, who returned\r\nin miracles the favors of their worshippers; so that Dabaiba became as\r\nMecca in the wilderness. Of course, it was an outrage against heaven\r\nthat the heathen gods should have so much gold and glory; though hunger\r\nand avarice lent as much assistance, perhaps, as piety, in instigating\r\nthe contemplated raid.\r\n\r\nSelecting one hundred and sixty men, Vasco Nuñez embarked in two\r\nbrigantines for the mouths of the river.[VIII-16] There he divided his\r\nforce, sending one third, under Colmenares, up the channel San Juan,\r\nwhile with the remainder he ascended the Rio de las Redes, the more\r\ndirect route to Dabaiba, as he had been informed. But the eye of Cemaco,\r\nin restless hate, was still upon them. Rousing the country, he induced\r\nthe caciques along the river to retire, and leave wasted fields to\r\nthe invaders, a measure which defeated the expedition. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Spaniards secured, a short distance up the river, two canoe-loads\r\nof plunder, valued at seven thousand pesos, but on reaching the gulf\r\nthey were overturned in a storm, and the boatmen drowned. Balboa then\r\nproceeded to the Rio San Juan and joined Colmenares, after which the\r\nentire party ascended the Negro channel for six leagues, and captured\r\na town of five hundred houses, governed by a cacique named Abenamechey,\r\none of whose arms a Spaniard cruelly struck off after he had been made\r\nprisoner. Leaving there half the men in charge of Colmenares, with the\r\nremainder Balboa continued his ascent of the stream, until, on entering\r\na small branch, he found himself within the domain of Abibeiba, whose\r\npeople built their houses in the branches of palm trees, making the\r\nascent by ladders drawn up at night for safety. A supply of stones was\r\nkept in the houses for artillery purposes. When they saw the Spaniards\r\ncoming, the people ran like squirrels for their houses, and drawing up\r\nafter them the ladders, fancied themselves in security.\r\n\r\nApproaching the tree in which lived the chief, Balboa hailed him and\r\nordered him down. \"What brings you hither to molest me?\" demanded\r\nthe chief. \"Go your way. I know you not as friends or foes. I have no\r\ngold. I desire only to be left in peace.\" The Spaniards answered by\r\napplying the axe to the tree, and when the chief saw the chips fly,\r\nwhile his stone showers fell harmless upon the mail-coated men below,\r\nhe capitulated, and the village descended to earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CONSPIRACY DIVULGED.]\r\n\r\nAfter further foraging and fighting with varied success, the governor\r\nreturned to Antigua, leaving Bartolomé Hurtado with thirty-one men\r\nin possession of the country. Of these more than half fell sick, and\r\nHurtado incautiously despatched them for Antigua with twenty-four\r\ncaptives in charge. They had not proceeded more than three leagues\r\nbefore Cemaco was upon them with one hundred warriors; and of the\r\nSpaniards only two escaped to carry the news to Hurtado, who hastened\r\nto Antigua with the further intelligence that five caciques, namely,\r\nAbibeiba of the high-tree house, Abenamechy of the severed arm,\r\nDabaiba of the golden temple, Abraiba and Cemaco of Darien, had\r\nconfederated with five thousand men to exterminate the Spaniards. The\r\nrumor was lightly regarded until Vasco Nuñez was informed by one of his\r\nmistresses, Fulvia he called her, that her brother had notified her to\r\nwithdraw from the town on a certain night, so that she might not fall\r\nin the massacre intended. Love overruling duty, Fulvia thus divulged\r\nthe secret. She saved the settlement, but she lost her country.\r\n\r\nPoor heart of woman touched with love! Vasco Nuñez induced Fulvia\r\nto lure thither her brother, who thereupon was seized and forced to\r\nconfess the plot. Furthermore, he told Balboa that then at work in his\r\nfields were forty men long pledged to assassinate him, but as he had\r\nalways appeared before them armed and armored, and on a caparisoned\r\nhorse, which was their greatest terror, they had feared to attack him.\r\nThe rendezvous of the conspirators was Tichirí, not far distant. With\r\nseventy men, by a circuitous route, Balboa marched on the encampment,\r\nwhile Colmenares with an equal force ascended the river in canoes,\r\nguided by the traitress Fulvia's traitorous brother. Attacked thus\r\nunexpectedly from opposite sides, the confederates were thrown into\r\nconfusion; many were killed and many taken prisoners. The chief general\r\nwas honored by being shot to death with arrows, while the others were\r\nhanged. Cemaco escaped. So sudden and bold and severe was this blow,\r\nthat, while Antigua existed, the savages never recovered from it, and\r\nthe wooden fortress which Balboa immediately built as a guard against\r\nfuture surprise was scarcely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe natives being thus pacified, the Spaniards were at liberty to evolve\r\nfresh projects. Gold and grain in the vicinity of Antigua were well-nigh\r\nexhausted, and new fields must be found. The time for Valdivia's return\r\nhad elapsed; and doubts respecting the integrity of the regidor were\r\nentertained by Vasco Nuñez, with fears for the safety of his treasure.\r\nUnable to endure the suspense he resolved on visiting Spain and pleading\r\nhis own cause before the king. But the colony demurred. Friends declared\r\nhis presence necessary, while enemies saw danger in his absence. It\r\nwas finally arranged that Colmenares and Caicedo, both worthy men who\r\nhad been faithful to Nicuesa as long as Nicuesa had been faithful to\r\nhimself, and faithful to Vasco Nuñez, should take the only remaining\r\nvessel fit for service and embark for Spain in the general interests\r\nof the colony. The reasoning by which the mistrustful populace arrived\r\nat this agreement was, that if Balboa went he would secure all the\r\nadvantages to himself, or never return; while Colmenares, who left large\r\nproperty in lands and laborers, and Caicedo, a genuine Spanish wife to\r\nwhom he was devotedly attached, would be sure to return.\r\n\r\nAgain the governor wrote Pasamonte soliciting his favor; not forgetting,\r\nin addition to the king's fifth, a valuable present in gold for the\r\nking's treasurer. The commissioners sailed from Darien in October, 1512,\r\nand reached Spain the May following.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile times at Antigua ran their varying course. At first nothing of\r\ninterest occurred; and such were the composite elements of this society\r\nthat inactivity invariably resulted in spontaneous combustion. Again it\r\ncentred round the ruling powers. \"Who is this Vasco Nuñez that he should\r\nlord it over us? a renegade! an absconding debtor! he of the cask!\"\r\nThe immediate cause of the outbreak was the investiture of Hurtado, an\r\nunpopular person, with authority; and the more specific charges were\r\npartiality in the division of spoils, and the unlawful assumption of\r\npowers pertaining to a royally appointed ruler.\r\n\r\nThe new faction was led by one Alonso Perez de la Rua, who for fancied\r\ninsult pawed the earth and bellowed vengeance. The agitation becoming\r\ntroublesome Perez was arrested and placed in confinement. The insurgents\r\nrushed to arms and demanded the release of their leader, and this\r\nbeing denied they prepared to rescue him by force. The governor placed\r\nhimself at the head of his adherents, and the two parties prepared\r\nfor battle. At this juncture peaceful measures were interposed by a\r\nthird party, consisting of those who had taken no active part in the\r\ndisputes, and embracing many respectable colonists. Perez was released;\r\nbut the gnawings of hate continuing he roused his party and made\r\nprisoner Hurtado, who in his turn was given liberty at the hands of the\r\nconciliators.\r\n\r\nChivalry having had its brief day, avarice came in for a share of public\r\nattention. Among the yet undivided plunder was gold obtained in the late\r\nAtrato River raids, equivalent in value to ten thousand castellanos. Of\r\nthis the disaffected demanded immediate division.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GOVERNOR WITHDRAWS.]\r\n\r\nThe governor well knew that in their present mood it was beyond the\r\npower of man to satisfy them. Though omniscient justice distributed this\r\ntreasure, new troubles would grow out of it. He determined therefore to\r\nadopt a non-committal policy, retire from the scene, and freely give\r\nthem the opportunity, for which they were so ready, to shed blood.\r\nQuitting the town at night, ostensibly on a hunting tour, he remained\r\naway for several days, leaving them to their destruction. The result\r\nwas as he had anticipated. Finding themselves free the rioters elevated\r\nto the command Perez of the wounded honor, and Bachiller Corral. Then\r\nbreaking into the public plunder-house, they brought out the gold and\r\nplaced it in the hands of their leaders for distribution. Proof that the\r\ndivision was fair lay in the fact that every one was dissatisfied. Each,\r\nrating his own services superior to most and inferior to none, thought\r\nhe received too little and another too much. They began to suspect\r\ntheir mistake. A dim perception of the infelicities that mix with the\r\nrapturous sweets of governing entered their stolid brains. Balboa's\r\nparty quickly assumed the ascendency, and thrusting the ringleaders of\r\nthe insurgents into prison they awaited the return of the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness must know,\" writes Vasco Nuñez of this affair to the\r\nking, January 20, 1513, \"that some days ago little differences occurred\r\nhere, because the alcaldes, filled with envy and falsehood, attempted to\r\narrest me. Failing in this they brought against me false accusations and\r\nfalse witnesses. Hereof I complain to your highness, for if these men\r\ngo unpunished, no governor that your highness may hereafter send will\r\nbe free from this evil. That your highness may know the truth in the\r\nmatter, and of my great and loyal services in these parts of the Indies\r\nand Tierra Firme, I have appointed two judges to investigate my conduct,\r\nand report to your majesty all that I have done. I hope,\" concludes the\r\nmodest cavalier, \"that your majesty will read all this, and reward my\r\ngreat services according to their value.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout this time there arrived at Antigua two vessels, in command of\r\nCristóbal Serrano, sent by Diego Colon, with one hundred and fifty men\r\nand provisions for the colony. But what gave Vasco Nuñez the greatest\r\njoy was a royal commission, signed by Pasamonte, the treasurer,\r\ninvesting him with the supreme command of the colony. Thus established\r\nin authority, and being of a generous temper, the governor at the\r\nsolicitations of their friends readily pardoned the rebels and set them\r\nat liberty.\r\n\r\nAnother communication, however, which Vasco Nuñez received by this\r\narrival, caused him no little anxiety. This was a letter from Zamudio\r\ninforming him of his failure to conciliate the royal favor. As had been\r\nfeared, the bachiller Enciso, burning under a sense of injuries, had\r\ndenounced the alcaldes before the Council of the Indies, and aroused\r\nthe king's wrath by a recital of Nicuesa's banishment and probable\r\ndeath. The Council had decreed that Enciso should be indemnified, and\r\nthat Vasco Nuñez should be summoned to court to answer graver charges.\r\nMoreover, Zamudio with difficulty escaped the arrest imposed on him by\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALBOA'S RESOLVE.]\r\n\r\nThis was as wormwood in Balboa's cup of joy. Yet it was not wholly\r\nunexpected; it was not wholly unmerited. There was one redeeming feature\r\nabout it; the intelligence was private. He was still master of himself;\r\nay, and governor of the colony. Might not some signal service be made\r\nto cover his transgressions, and win for him the royal favor? There was\r\nthat mysterious sea to the southward, reported by Panciaco. The very\r\nthing, were men and means at hand for its achievement. Means! There was\r\nno time to talk of means; the next arrival would bring a warrant for\r\nhis arrest. Do it without means, and so gain glory the more. Where was\r\nthe true Spanish cavalier who would hesitate in such an emergency? Why,\r\nthe very danger itself was a fascination. He would do it or die!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\n1513.\r\n\r\n     DEPARTURE OF VASCO NUÑEZ FROM ANTIGUA—CARETA'S\r\n     WELCOME—DIFFICULTIES TO BE ENCOUNTERED—TREACHEROUS CHARACTER\r\n     OF THE COUNTRY—HISTORICAL BLOODHOUNDS—PONCA RECONCILED—CAPTURE\r\n     OF QUAREQUÁ—FIRST VIEW OF THE PACIFIC FROM THE HEIGHTS\r\n     OF QUAREQUÁ—THE SPANIARDS DESCEND TO CHIAPES—TAKE FORMAL\r\n     POSSESSION OF THE SOUTH SEA—FORM OF TAKING POSSESSION—THE\r\n     NAMES SOUTH SEA AND PACIFIC OCEAN—FURTHER DISCOVERIES—PERILOUS\r\n     CANOE VOYAGE—GOLD AND PEARLS IN PROFUSION—TUMACO\r\n     PACIFIED—THE PEARL ISLANDS—THE RETURN—TEOCA'S KINDNESS—PONCA\r\n     MURDERED—POCOROSA PACIFIED—TUBANAMÁ VANQUISHED—GOLD, GOLD,\r\n     GOLD—PANCIACO'S CONGRATULATIONS—ARRIVAL AT ANTIGUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolving matters in his mind, plans quickly unfolded. Winning for the\r\nproject a few staunch friends, Vasco Nuñez selected with great care one\r\nhundred and ninety men.[IX-1] More could have been taken, but he had\r\ndetermined on a rapid march of discovery rather than pacification and\r\noccupation. Hence he preferred only tried men, those inured to fatigue,\r\nmen resolute and reckless, with heart and head hard, and sinews of\r\nsteel. He also provided from among his captives and the neighboring\r\nnations one thousand natives, to serve as warriors and beasts of burden.\r\nThese, might live or die, as it should happen: no great matter what\r\nbecame of them. A pack of bloodhounds completed the company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EMBARKATION OF THE EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nThe men were armed with crossbows, swords, arquebuses and targets, and\r\nprovisions for the expedition were placed on board a brigantine and ten\r\nlarge canoes. Before embarking, the hazardous nature of the enterprise\r\nwas made known to the soldiers. Wealth and glory awaited success; the\r\nreward of failure, death; opportunity was then offered for any one to\r\nwithdraw without prejudice or injury.\r\n\r\nSailing with his little armament from Antigua on the first day of\r\nSeptember, 1513, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa followed the coast of Darien\r\nnorth-westward to Careta's province, where the expedition disembarked\r\non the fourth day. The chieftain's dusky daughter, whom the governor\r\ncontinued to regard with great affection, was still a bond of friendship\r\nbetween this nation and the Spaniards. Careta added to their stock of\r\nprovisions and furnished them with guides; and some of his warriors\r\njoined the expedition, in the hope of witnessing the downfall of their\r\nenemies beyond the mountains. The boats were left in charge of a guard;\r\nand after invoking divine favor the expedition was ready to move.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI know the tendency of the historian, warmed by his theme, to magnify\r\nmerit, and the obstacles it overcomes; and I have elsewhere said as\r\nmuch. While I endeavor to confine myself to the plain words of a simple\r\nstory, those who have sat at ease, sipping iced champagne, during a\r\ndelightful ride of three or four hours across this sometime terrible\r\nneck, may find in this chapter expressions appearing strong. But I\r\ndo assure the reader that it is difficult to magnify in the present\r\ninstance. Vasco Nuñez now stood on the northern coast, opposite the\r\ngulf of San Miguel, which, breaking the shore of Panamá Bay, narrows\r\nthe isthmus of Darien to a width of fifty miles.[IX-2] But such is\r\nthe infamous character of the country, that even modern efforts to\r\npenetrate the unexplored interior from either side have met disaster\r\nand ruin.[IX-3] Inaccessible forests filled with noxious reptiles and\r\nwild beasts, tangled jungles through which man must cut his way foot\r\nby foot; rugged mountains, slippery slopes, and rocky precipices, over\r\nand round which the weary traveller threads his way under a blooming\r\ntropical canopy; frequent and sudden rains and inundations; treacherous\r\nmorasses, and the malarious exhalations from putrid vegetation, unite\r\nwith warlike savages to render this spot one of the most difficult on\r\nthe globe to explore. Add to these obstructions the weight of heavy\r\narmor and cumbrous weapons, and some conception may be formed of a\r\nmilitary march through an equatorial wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF THE BAND.]\r\n\r\nNo wonder Vasco Nuñez scrutinized his company before starting. \"I beg\r\nyour very royal Highness,\" he had written before this to the king,\r\n\"to give me men from Española; for such as come from Castile are\r\nfor my purpose worthless, bringing loss not only on themselves but\r\nothers.\"[IX-4] Born amidst the clash of arms in chivalrous Spain, broken\r\nto adversity at Española, and many of them toughened at Santa Marta,\r\nVeragua, and Antigua, the present band mustered the survivors of daring\r\nexpeditions whose bones strewed the shores of Tierra Firme.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards began their march on the 6th of September. The second\r\nday brought them to the lands of Ponca, who having been warned of their\r\napproach had retired from the path.[IX-5] But other thoughts than those\r\nof plunder and petty warfare now filled the mind of Vasco Nuñez; and,\r\npreferring to leave no enemy in his rear, while resting in the cacique's\r\ncomfortable quarters he made overtures of friendship to the chief,\r\nwho straightway returned from his hiding, and gave gold, together with\r\nvaluable information concerning the southern sea and the route thither\r\nin return for beads, mirrors, hawk-bells, and axes. For none knew better\r\nthan the courteous governor how to kindle friendship in the savage\r\nbreast, and make it profitable. The gold which Ponca gave consisted of\r\nfinely wrought ornaments from beyond the mountains, and ten pounds of\r\nthe metal from his own mines. He described a certain summit from which\r\nthis southern sea might easily be seen, gave information of the nations\r\nto be encountered by the Spaniards, and furnished them with guides for\r\nthe secret passes.\r\n\r\nRoused by this encouragement, and leaving here the sick and wayworn,\r\nthe Spaniards were on their southward march again the 20th of September.\r\nBetween the several provinces were no beaten paths, across the rivers no\r\nbridges; so great were the impediments to their progress, and so much\r\nmore time was consumed than had been anticipated, that food began to\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nMaking their way amid these difficulties, they came to the foot of the\r\nhigh mountains where terminated their pacified territory, and where they\r\nmust prepare to dispute the way with native sovereigns of the soil.\r\nAscending the mountains, they encountered on the 24th a cacique named\r\nPorque, lord of the province of Quarequá, the ruler of these parts,\r\nwhose arrogance, fed by his successes, had kept full pace with them. At\r\nthe head of a thousand warriors, Porque appeared before Vasco Nuñez,\r\ndemanded the object of his visit, and threatened to kill every man\r\nwho should put foot within his dominions. The Spaniards nevertheless\r\ncontinued slowly to advance, keeping well together. Amazed at their\r\ntemerity, and indignant at the seeming indifference to his threat,\r\nPorque swept down upon them with flourish of weapons and terrific\r\nyells, confident of easy victory. But as well might he have spent his\r\nunleavened force against the eternal hills.\r\n\r\nWaiting until the whole swarm was well within reach, Vasco Nuñez gave\r\nthe order to charge. Shouting the inspiriting war-cry, Santiago, y á\r\nellos! the Spaniards sprang upon them. The fire-arms were discharged,\r\nthe bloodhounds[IX-6] let loose, and striking the cruel steel into the\r\nnaked bodies of the enemy, he was literally hewn in pieces. Vainly, in\r\nwild confusion, the savages struggled to escape; the flash of fire, the\r\nthundering noise, the sulphurous smoke, bereft them of their senses,\r\nmaking easy work for the sharp iron which entered unresisted their\r\nvitals, until six hundred lay dead upon the ground, Porque among the\r\nnumber. Many prisoners were taken; the survivors escaped to the hills.\r\nIn the village of Quarequá was found much needed food, and some gold.\r\nSo toilsome had been the march that eighteen days had passed since\r\nleaving Careta's town. And here Vasco Nuñez rested for the night,\r\nnursing his wounded, and cheering the sick and down-hearted. The guides\r\nwhom Ponca had furnished, and who had proved of incalculable service\r\nto the explorers, were dismissed to their home with presents, and with\r\nhearts made glad by the destruction of Porque. So rolls round the planet\r\ninexorable nature, detested death giving hourly joy to universal life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST VIEW OF THE SOUTH SEA.]\r\n\r\nThe 25th[IX-7] of September, 1513, a day ever memorable in the annals\r\nof the Pacific States, dawned brightly over the sierra of Quarequá. The\r\nvillage in which the Spaniards had made their quarters was situated on\r\nan elevated plateau, and near it rose the reputed mountain whose summit\r\nhad for ages gazed on the mysterious southern sea. At an early hour\r\nVasco Nuñez was astir, to prepare with thrilling anticipations for the\r\nascent. But sixty-seven, out of the one hundred and ninety Spaniards who\r\nwithin the month had embarked upon this enterprise at Antigua, possessed\r\nsufficient strength for the present effort. Departing from the town,\r\ntheir way at first lay through a tangled forest, which fringed the\r\nmountain base, and whose dense foliage hid from view the more distant\r\nobjects. As they mounted upward into a cooler, drier atmosphere, the\r\nvegetation became more stunted, yet the undergrowth was still so thick\r\nthat the soldiers had to cut a passage with their sabres. Emerging at\r\nlength into an open space near the summit, a bare eminence was pointed\r\nout by the guides, whence the view was said to be unobstructed, and the\r\nsea distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nViewed prosaically, there was nothing astounding in ascending a hill\r\nand taking a look at the ocean. It had been often done elsewhere; it\r\nhad been often done here. Nor was there any peculiar difference between\r\nsea and land here and sea and land elsewhere. But there was that to the\r\nminds of the impetuous and impressible Spaniards, there is that to our\r\nown minds, in first things and first views of things, our first view,\r\nour country's first awakening, that stirs the soul and sets faster\r\nbeating the heart. Reduced to words, the sentiment is the pleasure the\r\nmind derives from improving surprises; it is the joy of development,\r\nthe ecstasy of evolution.\r\n\r\nIf such be commonly the case, how much more reason had Vasco Nuñez de\r\nBalboa to be impassioned on this occasion. Behind him was ignominy,\r\nperhaps chains and death; before him was glory, immortal fame. And it\r\nwas meet in him that this ordinarily trivial act should be consummated\r\nwith a ceremony becoming to one of civilization's great achievements.\r\n\r\nOrdering a halt, Vasco Nuñez advanced alone. His should be the first\r\nEuropean eye to behold what there was to behold, and that without\r\nperadventure. With throbbing heart he mounted the topmost eminence\r\nwhich crowned these sea-dividing hills. Then, as in the lifting of a\r\nveil, a scene of primeval splendor burst on his enraptured gaze, such\r\nas might fill with joy an archangel sent to explore a new creation.\r\nThere it lay, that boundless unknown sea, spread out before him, far as\r\nthe eye could reach, in calm, majestic beauty, glittering like liquid\r\ncrystal in the morning sun. Beneath his feet, in furrowed prospect,\r\nwere terraces of living green, sportive with iridescent light and shade;\r\nwaving plains and feathered steeps white-lined with flowing waters, here\r\ndashing boisterously down the hill-side, yonder winding silent through\r\nthe sighing foliage to the all-receiving sea. In that first illimitable\r\nglance time stood back, the mists lifted, and eternity was there. What\r\nwonder if to this Spanish cavalier, in that moment of triumphant joy,\r\nvisions of the mighty future appeared pictured on the cerulean heights,\r\nvisions of populous cities, of fleets and armies, of lands teeming\r\nwith wealth and industry. And to Spain should all these blessings and\r\nadvantages accrue; to Spain through him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPEECH OF VASCO NUÑEZ.]\r\n\r\nDropping on his knees, he poured forth praise and thanksgiving to the\r\nauthor of that glorious creation for the honor of its discovery. The\r\nsoldiers then pressed forward, gazed enchanted likewise, and likewise\r\nassumed the attitude of prayer; for however ungodly were their lives,\r\nthese cavaliers were always fond of praying.\r\n\r\n\"There, my friends,\" exclaimed Balboa, rising and pointing to the\r\nprospect before him, \"there is the realization of your hopes, the reward\r\nof your labors. You are the first Christians to look upon that sea,\r\nor to tread its luxuriant shores. The words of the chivalrous Panciaco\r\nconcerning the Southern Sea are more than verified; please God so may\r\nwe find them regarding the riches of its shore. All are yours, I say,\r\nyours the glory of laying this celestial realm at your sovereign's\r\nfeet; yours the privilege of bringing to the only vile thing in it the\r\ncleansing properties of our holy faith. Continue, then, true to me,\r\nand I promise you honor and wealth to your fullest desire.\" A shout\r\nof approbation, such as the rabble are ever ready with before success,\r\nwas followed by pledges of fidelity and fair service, to be broken upon\r\nthe first occasion. And if we may believe old Peter Martyr, who enjoyed\r\nthis triumph of progress almost as much as the discoverers themselves,\r\nHannibal from the summit of the Alps, pointing to his soldiers the\r\ndelicious fields of Italy, displayed no grander conception of his\r\nhigh achievements, past and future, than did Balboa at this moment.\r\nA cross was erected, round which stones were heaped; the trees were\r\nblazoned with the sovereign's name; the Te Deum laudamus and Te Dominum\r\nconfitemur was solemnly chanted by the company; after which Balboa in a\r\nloud voice called on all present to witness that he then and thereby,\r\nfor and in the name of the sovereigns of Spain, took possession of\r\nthis Southern Sea, with all its islands and firm lands, and all shores\r\nwashed by its waters. The notary was ordered to draw up a certificate\r\nin accordance, to which each present affixed his name.[IX-8]\r\n\r\nBecause the strangers seemed to delight in it, the savages assisted in\r\nthe cross-raising and in carrying stones, though they saw nothing in\r\nthe surroundings to become so excited about. Meanwhile the Spaniards\r\nwondered how far the water extended, what nations inhabited its borders,\r\nwhat the commerce and religion of those nations, and what would be the\r\neffect of the discovery on Spain, on the world, on their own fortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHIAPES AND THE SPANIARDS.]\r\n\r\nDescending the mountains on its seaward side they were met by a\r\ncacique, called like his province, Chiapes, who ordered them back\r\nif they sought not death. The policy of Vasco Nuñez here was peace.\r\nHostile entanglements at this juncture he knew would sooner or later\r\nresult in the destruction of his party. It must be a peace, however,\r\nbased on fear and respect, seldom to be achieved among savages except\r\nby slaughter. Overtures of friendship were accordingly instituted\r\nby a sudden and vigorous onslaught with fire-arms, cross-bows, and\r\nbloodhounds, during which Chiapes took to his heels, midst thunder,\r\nsmoke, and consternation; in consequence of which he was all the more\r\nhappy when the men of Quarequá sought him out, and told him that these\r\nsupernatural visitors who held the elements at their command were easily\r\npropitiated with gold. Tremblingly he appeared and laid at the feet of\r\nVasco Nuñez five hundred pounds of the metal, glad that the favor of the\r\ngods might be bought so cheaply. The Quarequá guides were now dismissed\r\nwith presents, and by them orders were sent the Spaniards resting at\r\ntheir town to follow the advance party.\r\n\r\nThe object of Vasco Nuñez was to approach the verge of the ocean\r\nand touch the water he had seen. For this purpose he despatched, in\r\ndifferent directions, three parties of twelve men each, under Francisco\r\nPizarro, Alonso Martin de Don Benito, and Juan de Escaray to search\r\nan opening to the seaside through the dense foliage that concealed it.\r\nIt is not a little singular that two days should elapse, and that the\r\nexplorers suffered severely for want of water before any one could find\r\nthe beach, though they were all the time so near it. Alonso Martin's\r\nparty came first to an inlet, on the shore of which were two canoes,\r\nthe open bay being still hidden. Desirous of being first in something,\r\nhowever small, Martin sprang into one of the boats which was barely\r\nfloating on the incoming tide, and cried to his companions, who had\r\nthrown themselves down under the cooling leaves—\"I call on you all to\r\nwitness that I am the first Spaniard to sail upon these waters.\" \"And\r\nI the second,\" exclaimed another, rushing for the other boat.[IX-9]\r\nReturning to Chiapes, Martin reported to Vasco Nuñez, who immediately\r\nbegan preparations to take more formal possession of the Southern Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TAKING POSSESSION.]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of September, St Michael's day, Vasco Nuñez with twenty-six\r\nmen set out for the border of the sea, accompanied by Chiapes with\r\na numerous train. Arriving there they found the tide out, and seated\r\nthemselves upon a grassy slope beneath the overhanging foliage, waiting\r\nthe return of the waters. Presently, when the sand was covered to the\r\ndepth of one or two feet, all arose, and Vasco Nuñez, armed and armored\r\ncap-a-pie, drew his sword and, taking from the hand of an attendant\r\na banner, on one side of which were pictured the virgin and child and\r\non the other the arms of Castile and Leon, marched into the water, and\r\nwaving aloft his banner cried in a loud voice: \"Long live the high and\r\npowerful monarchs Don Fernando and Doña Juana, sovereigns of Castile,\r\nand of Leon, and of Aragon, in whose name, and for the royal crown\r\nof Castile, I take and seize real and corporeal actual possession of\r\nthese seas and lands, and coasts and ports and islands of the south,\r\nwith all thereto annexed; and kingdoms and provinces which belong to\r\nthem, or which may hereafter belong to them, in whatever manner and\r\nby whatever right and title acquired, now existing or which may exist,\r\nancient and modern, in times past and present and to come, without any\r\ncontradiction. And if any other prince or captain, christian or infidel,\r\nof whatever law or sect or condition he may be, pretends any right to\r\nthese lands and seas, I am ready and prepared to contradict him, and\r\nto defend them in the names of the present and future sovereigns of\r\nCastile, who are the lords paramount in these Indies, islands and firm\r\nland, northern and southern, with their seas, as well in the arctic\r\npole as in the antarctic, on either side of the equinoctial line, within\r\nor without the tropics of cancer and capricorn, according to what more\r\ncompletely to their majesties and their successors belongs and is due,\r\nfor the whole and any part thereof; as I protest in writing shall or may\r\nbe more fully specified and alleged on behalf of their royal patrimony;\r\nnow and in all time while the earth revolves, and until the universal\r\njudgment of all mankind.\"[IX-10] To which grandiloquent harangue there\r\ncame no reply; no armed Poseidon appeared to dispute possession; only\r\nthe mighty ocean dashed from its face the blinding glare of this new\r\ndoctrine, heaved its bosom in long glassy swells, and gently growled\r\nits perplexity to the sympathizing beach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NAME PACIFIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nThe followers of Vasco Nuñez, however, even if all did not comprehend\r\nbetter than the sea what their leader had said, swore with loud\r\nacclamations to defend the claim of the sovereign who would thereby\r\nhave so much more land to bestow, and to follow their gallant leader\r\nto the riches and honor he had so freely promised them. Andrés de\r\nValderrábano, the notary of the expedition, was then called upon to draw\r\nup a certificate of the act of taking possession, to which all present\r\nsubscribed their names. This being the day of St Michael,[IX-11] the\r\narchangel, the gulf before them was called El golfo de San Miguel, which\r\nname it bears to this day. Tasting the water they found it salt, which\r\nproved it a true ocean sea that they had found; then they cut crosses\r\non the trees in honor of the holy trinity, and with longings satisfied\r\nand hearts singing their high hopes, the party returned to Chiapes,\r\nricher, according to their pretensions, by one Pacific Ocean,[IX-12]\r\nten thousand islands, and twenty-five hundred leagues of continental\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nThe grand event being so happily consummated, the Spaniards thought\r\nthat, before returning to Antigua, they might indulge in a little\r\nexploration. Luckily the powerful Chiapes was not only their friend,\r\nbut he could furnish them a goodly list of enemies having an abundance\r\nof gold and pearls. Under his direction they crossed a large river,\r\nfell upon a chieftain called Cocura, and returned to Chiapes with six\r\nhundred and fifty pesos. Then they decided to explore an arm of the\r\ngulf, which involved a short but dangerous canoe voyage. In vain Chiapes\r\nprotested against the project. \"Our God will protect us,\" replied the\r\ndevout Vasco Nuñez, as with eighty Spaniards, and a dusky band under\r\nChiapes, he stepped into the canoes, the 17th of October. Soon they\r\nfound themselves in a sea so tempestuous that they were glad to escape\r\nupon an island whose uncertain soil threatened every moment to dissolve\r\nbeneath their feet. There they remained up to their waists in water all\r\nthat night. Fortunately before morning the waters of the gulf subsided,\r\nelse the discoverers of the Pacific Ocean never would have returned\r\nto tell their tale. Daybreak presented a dismal spectacle. Some of the\r\ncanoes were split, others embedded in the sand; and all the provisions\r\nand clothing had been swept away. But to such hardships these men were\r\ninured. Since leaving Spain they had lived chiefly on maize bread,\r\nwild herbs, fruit, roots, sometimes fish, seldom meat. This was their\r\nbest diet. In times of scarcity, which were frequent, they were glad\r\nto get reptiles, insects, or anything that would sustain life. They\r\nhad no salt; and their only drink was river water, frequently putrid\r\nand unwholesome. Yet while life lasted, the brain worked inexhaustible\r\nresources. In the present emergency, for example, when both sea and land\r\nproved treacherous, they by no means yielded to despair. Stripping the\r\nglutinous bark from certain young trees which they found, they bruised\r\nit with stones, added to it fibrous sea-plants reduced in like manner,\r\nand, after binding their broken boats firmly with cords, they calked the\r\nseams with the mixture. Again they committed themselves to the mercy of\r\nthe sea, and after two days of hazardous navigation, half naked and half\r\nstarved, they ran into a small creek which flowed through a province\r\ncalled Chitarraga, and landed about midnight near an Indian village\r\ngoverned by a cacique named Tumaco.[IX-13]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PEARL GATHERING.]\r\n\r\nCarrying the village, though not without resistance, Vasco Nuñez, as\r\nusual, sought the friendship of the fleeing Tumaco, who was induced to\r\nreturn, bringing gold valued at six hundred and fourteen pesos, and a\r\nbasin of pearls, two hundred and forty of which were of extraordinary\r\nsize. This was indeed something worthy of an oriental India, thought\r\nthe Spaniards, as their hearts danced enraptured over the beautiful\r\nbaubles. Tumaco could not understand what power his gift possessed that\r\nit should so charm these heavenly strangers. To him the oyster which he\r\ncould eat was seemingly worth more than the pearl which he could not\r\neat; for in roasting the bivalve he had spoilt pearls enough to make\r\nhim rich in the eyes of any potentate in Christendom. When once he knew\r\nthat pearls were wealth, Tumaco became eager to show the Spaniards how\r\nmuch he had at his command, and set his men to fish; and in four days\r\nthey returned with twelve marks' weight, or ninety-six ounces of pearls.\r\nSix Spaniards accompanied them to see whence came the gems, and they\r\nshowed the natives how to open oysters without heat, which discolored\r\nthe pearl. Likewise gold hereabout was plentiful and lightly esteemed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVasco Nuñez endeavored to gain all the information possible concerning\r\nthe nature and extent of the sea-coast. He was told by Tumaco that the\r\nocean and the mainland extended southward without end; that far distant\r\nin that direction dwelt a great nation whose riches were immense, who\r\nnavigated the ocean in ships, and employed beasts of burden. In order\r\nthe better to describe these animals, Tumaco moulded in clay a figure of\r\nthe llama, which seemed to the eyes of the Spaniards a species of camel.\r\n\"And this,\" says Herrera, \"was the second intimation Vasco Nuñez had of\r\nPeru, and of its wealth.\" Nor did Francisco Pizarro, who was present,\r\nfail to hold these things in remembrance.\r\n\r\nBalboa now felt his mission accomplished. Had the new sea and its border\r\nbeen made for him it could not have pleased him better. Columbus had\r\nfound a new continent; he had found a new sea; and wealth on this south\r\nside seemed illimitable. But before returning he deemed it prudent to\r\nsupplement his deed of possession by the enactment of that ceremonial on\r\nthe shore of the main ocean, for his exploits had hitherto been confined\r\nto the gulf of San Miguel. Applying to Tumaco for the requisite means,\r\nan immense canoe was produced, the barge of state, with oarsmen, and\r\noars inlaid with _aljófar_, an inferior kind of pearl; and Vasco Nuñez\r\ncalled on the notary to write it down, that boats on this Southern Sea\r\nwere propelled by oars inlaid with pearl, so that his sovereigns might\r\nthereby place a greater value on it and on his own great services.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, on the 29th of October, the Spaniards\r\nembarked in Tumaco's barge, and, proceeding to the shore of the main\r\nocean, landed near an island called by the natives Crucraga, but to\r\nwhich Vasco Nuñez gave the name of San Simon. Here with banner and\r\nbuckler, with drawn sword and high-sounding declamation, and amidst\r\nthe lordly waves which had rolled their unimpeded course from far\r\nbeyond the ever lifting horizon, the vaunting cavalier again affirmed\r\nownership, swearing to defend he knew not what against he knew not whom;\r\nbut \"herein,\" according to Herrera, \"he used all the formalities that\r\ncould be imagined, for he was brave, subtle, diligent, and of a generous\r\ntemper, a commander fit for mighty enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were about to depart, the men of Chitarraga directed the\r\nattention of Balboa to a group of small low islands rising from the sea\r\nfive leagues distant. A powerful chieftain governed there, who, crossing\r\nto the mainland, made fearful havoc among the seaboard villages; and\r\nwould the Spaniards please go and kill him, for at the largest island,\r\nToe, were the most beautiful pearls in all that region. The Spaniards\r\nwould go there or elsewhere for pearls and gold if they only had the\r\ntime, and a favorable sea, but Vasco Nuñez would not permit himself to\r\nbe led away into further fascinations on this visit. He nevertheless\r\ngave names to the islands, calling the largest Isla Rica, and the\r\ngroup Islas de las Perlas,[IX-14] or Pearl Islands, assuring Tumaco,\r\nmeanwhile, that he would return some day and avenge him his injuries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RETURN.]\r\n\r\nOnce more back at Chitarraga, Vasco Nuñez made ready his departure\r\nfor Antigua. He proposed to cross the mountains by a different route\r\nfrom that by which he came. The sick and disabled he would leave with\r\nChiapes, now the firm friend of the Spaniards, who were to kill his\r\nenemies and not him. This chieftain and a son of Tumaco asked permission\r\nto accompany the party as far as Teaochoan, an adjoining province.\r\nAccordingly, on the 3d of November, they embarked in canoes, and guided\r\nby the young cacique of Chitarraga, proceeded to the upper end of the\r\ngulf and entered a large river,[IX-15] so inconstant as to overflow its\r\nbanks in places, narrowing elsewhere between rocky confines, and rushing\r\nforward tumultuously under the overhanging foliage to the sea. By and\r\nby the youthful chieftain brought the boats to land. Disembarking, the\r\nSpaniards pacified the province in their usual way, the ruler, Teoca,\r\nchief of Teaochoan, being glad to save his life by paying one hundred\r\nand sixty ounces of gold and two hundred large pearls. Indeed, so\r\neffectually had Vasco Nuñez succeeded, by a judicious use of fire-arms\r\nand fair words, and some trifling presents, in winning the affections\r\nof the South Sea savages, that in taking leave of Chiapes and the\r\nChitarraga youth at Teoca's town, they wept. It was indeed affecting;\r\nand soon Teoca, although the last to be robbed, caught himself paying\r\nthe strangers the same briny tribute of his esteem.\r\n\r\nAfter three days of rest the party proceeded, and reaching the base\r\nof the mountains they began to scale them. A supply of dried fish\r\nand maize, with men of burden and guides, had been secured, and they\r\nwere accompanied by Teoca's son, who had instructions to attend to\r\nall requirements of the strangers, and not to leave them without the\r\npermission of their commander. It was well for the company that they\r\nhad a leader thoughtful and efficient; that instead of zealous guides,\r\nand willing men to bear the burdens, there were not lurking foes or\r\ntreacherous friends with whom to deal—not one of them otherwise would\r\nhave reached Antigua. For, toiling up the steep ascent under a burning\r\nsun, they soon found themselves without water, the springs upon which\r\nthey had depended having failed. One by one the men yielded their\r\nstrength and threw themselves upon the ground, victims of despair.\r\nTeoca's son assisted and encouraged them, and finally brought them\r\nall in safety to a cool, sequestered valley where were life-restoring\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFAMOUS ACT OF BALBOA.]\r\n\r\nWas it their way of giving thanks for the late escape from death, now\r\nto plan the death of others? While resting in the refreshing shade,\r\nBalboa asked his guide about a certain Poncra, a hideous despot,\r\nas rich as he was repulsive, of whom he had heard much. \"We are now\r\nwithin his lands,\" the young chief replied. \"Over the brow of yonder\r\nhill is situated his village.\" Then was detailed a story of this man's\r\nwickedness which sent a thrill of pleasing horror to the heart of every\r\nSpaniard present. Instantly all was excitement; and those so lately the\r\nreadiest to faint were now the readiest to fight. Marching forward they\r\nentered the village only to find the vulture flown. Finely wrought gold\r\nto the value of three thousand pesos was found there to reconcile them\r\nto his absence. Scouts soon discovered his retreat, however, and partly\r\nby threats and partly by promises of safety, this lump of deformity was\r\ninduced to give himself up with three of his principal men. No sooner\r\nwas it known that the hated Poncra was prisoner in the hands of the\r\nSpaniards, than the neighboring chieftains flocked in and begged his\r\nextermination. \"Whence came your gold?\" demanded Balboa of the unhappy\r\nman. \"I know not,\" replied Poncra. \"My forefathers left it me. We place\r\nno value on the unwrought metal.\" Although torture was applied, nothing\r\nfurther could be elicited. The bystanders clamored loudly for his death,\r\ncharging him with infamous crimes, revolting to humanity. In an evil\r\nmoment Vasco Nuñez yielded. The bloodhounds were let loose, and loud\r\nacclamations rent the air as the quivering flesh was torn from the limbs\r\nof the four unfortunate wretches, and they were made, as Ogilby says,\r\n\"a Breakfast to the Spanish Doggs.\" Vasco Nuñez de Balboa gained the\r\napproval of the crowd; but throughout all time, wherever the name of the\r\nillustrious discoverer of the Southern Sea is spoken, this infamous act\r\nof treachery shall stain it. The praises of the savages, however, were\r\nprofuse; \"and there he remained thirty days,\" says Gomara, \"receiving\r\nand ruling like a king.\" And very prettily Balboa commemorates his\r\noutrage by calling the place Todos Los Santos.\r\n\r\nWhile resting here, the Spaniards were joined by the comrades who had\r\nbeen left at Chiapes. Throughout all this region the strangers were\r\ntreated as invincible and superhuman. Passing through the domain of a\r\nchief named Bononiama, they were not only received as friends, coming as\r\nthey did from Chiapes, but were presented with gold to the value of two\r\nthousand pesos, and the chief accompanied them to Poncra's village, that\r\nhe might behold the wonderful leader of these wonderful men. Poncra's\r\nsuccessor came forward in answer to overtures of peace; and on the first\r\nof December the Spaniards continued their journey, weighted down with\r\nspoils. Five days brought them to a small depopulated town whose chief,\r\nBuquebuca, had fled because he had not the means, he said, fitly to\r\nentertain such illustrious visitors. He was permitted to purchase their\r\nfavor by delivering up the gold in his possession, including some finely\r\nwrought plates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALBOA AMONG THE CACIQUES.]\r\n\r\nFollowing a path northward from Buquebuca's they were hailed from a\r\ncliff near by. \"Our King Chioriso sends greeting, O mighty men! and\r\npresents this offering, begging your assistance in vanquishing an enemy\r\ntoo powerful for him.\" The gift was certainly persuasive, being no less\r\nthan thirty large gold medals or plates worth fourteen thousand pesos.\r\nBalboa scarcely knew what to do, nevertheless he graciously received\r\nit, and sent in return three axes, some gilt beads, and several pieces\r\nof leather and cloth, making the recipient to his own thinking the\r\nrichest potentate in savagedom. Balboa furthermore promised to assist\r\nhim at some future time in his wars. The country through which they were\r\nnow passing was exceptionally rugged, and the men of burden were quite\r\nexhausted when on the 13th of December they arrived at the village of\r\nPocorosa. Several of the soldiers had also fallen seriously ill from\r\nfatigue, and it was accordingly decided to tarry here for thirty days.\r\nThe chief, as usual, had fled at their approach, but was brought back\r\nto purchase friendship of the Spaniards with slaves and gold.\r\n\r\nPocorosa informed the Spaniards that not far from there[IX-16] lived\r\nthe famous Tubanamá, of whom Panciaco had spoken when first directing\r\nthe attention of the Spaniards to the South Sea. He was reputed the\r\nrichest as well as the strongest chieftain of these mountains, and was\r\nthe terror of the neighboring nations. Balboa felt it more than ever\r\nhis duty to overthrow Tubanamá, kill some of his men, steal a few of\r\nhis women, and relieve him of his gold. But to do this he must have\r\na thousand soldiers, so he had been told. Casting his eye over his\r\nlittle band of bruised and wayworn men, he thought how one mistake\r\nmight swallow all his past successes, and sighed; then he slept on it,\r\nand when after a few days' rest the question was adventured, enough\r\nwere eager for the raid. The result was that seventy Spaniards, and\r\na squad of Pocorosa's warriors, after a rapid march, fell on Tubanamá\r\nabout midnight and brought him away prisoner, Ogilby says with eighty\r\nconcubines. The men of Pocorosa, and chiefs of adjoining tribes, began\r\nto revile him, and begged of Vasco Nuñez his immediate death. He had\r\ndone worse things than Poncra, they said, and had beside spoken ill of\r\nthe Spaniards, threatening to drag them to death by the hair of their\r\nhead if ever they came within his reach. Vasco Nuñez pondered. For some\r\ntime past he had entertained a plan of establishing in this vicinity a\r\nmilitary post for the protection of commerce between the seas, and also\r\nof gold-mining. Was it better to kill this chief as an enemy, or let\r\nhim live as a friend, and assist to keep the others friendly? He chose\r\nthe latter course. But first he must temper the proposed friendship by\r\ntrial. \"Infamous tyrant,\" he thundered at the trembling prisoner, \"now\r\nshalt thou suffer for thine abominations. Thou shalt be made to feel the\r\npower of the Christians, and the same doom which thou before thy naked\r\nslaves didst promise them, shall now be meted thee.\" He then motioned\r\nthe attendants as if to remove him for execution. The unhappy cacique\r\ndenied the accusations and begged for his life. Balboa apparently\r\novercome by his entreaties slowly relented, and finally ordered the\r\ncaptive released. The overjoyed chieftain could not do enough for his\r\ndeliverer. He stripped his women of their ornaments, and, collecting\r\nall articles within his reach fabricated of the coveted metal, presented\r\nthe Spaniards with thirty marks of gold, and his subjects soon brought\r\nin sixty marks more. Enjoining Tubanamá to gather gold, and ever remain\r\ntrue to the Spaniards, Balboa returned in triumph to Pocorosa's town,\r\nwith a long train of enslaved captives. About this time Vasco Nuñez\r\nfell sick; and no wonder when we consider the strain on mind and body\r\nduring the past four months. First in every action, bearing exposure and\r\nprivation in common with the poorest soldier, with the responsibility\r\nof the adventure resting wholly on him, he was a fit subject for fever.\r\nBut his indomitable spirit never forsook him, and causing himself to be\r\ncarried on a litter he still directed movements, as they resumed their\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nWeary, ragged, but exultant, the party at length reached the village of\r\nComagre. Panciaco was overjoyed to see them. The old chief was dead,\r\nand the young man filled his father's place. He could not do enough\r\nfor Vasco Nuñez, for whom his affection seemed to grow in proportion\r\nas he was permitted to do him service. Panciaco had given the strangers\r\ngold and slaves; he had entertained them royally, had told them of the\r\nSouthern Sea and the way to reach it, all his words proving true. Now he\r\nwas permitted to entertain and nurse the emaciated Spaniards, and this\r\nhe did with lavish generosity, watching Vasco Nuñez through his sickness\r\nwith the affection of a brother. He was permitted to give them more\r\ngold, and did so. The Spaniards graciously received these benefits; and\r\nin return for obligations too vast for requital, the generous cavalier,\r\nthe chivalrous discoverer of the great South Sea, gave his friend and\r\nbenefactor a linen shirt and some worthless trinkets. His parting words\r\nwere \"Gather and send me more gold, Panciaco.\" The chief, however,\r\nbefore the party left, had embraced Christianity and received baptism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRIVAL AT ANTIGUA.]\r\n\r\nIt was the 14th of January that the party left Comagre. A short and easy\r\nmarch brought them to Poncra's village, where fortune wreathed in smiles\r\nstill attended the commander, now free from illness and loaded with\r\ngold. Vasco Nuñez here was met by four Spaniards from Antigua who had\r\ncome to report the arrival of two vessels from Española with provisions\r\nand reinforcements. Leaving the greater part of his company to follow\r\nat their leisure, Balboa with twenty men pressed forward, and after a\r\nhearty greeting from Careta at his village, embarked in the brigantine\r\nwhich there awaited him, and arrived the 19th of January, 1514.\r\n\r\nHis entry into the settlement was a triumph. All the people came to\r\nwelcome him, and he was conducted to the public square midst loud\r\nacclaims. And when he told them of his successes, of the wealth-bound\r\nsea, and the treasures he had obtained, they were wild with exultation.\r\nBeside gold, to the value of more than forty thousand pesos,[IX-17] the\r\nSpaniards had brought eight hundred Indian slaves, and a large quantity\r\nof pearls, cotton cloth, and Indian weapons. All the nations on the\r\nroute, both in going and in coming, had been subjugated without the loss\r\nof a battle and without the loss of a man. Thus terminated one of the\r\ngrandest and most successful achievements of the Spaniards in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the company soon arrived, and the spoils were thereupon\r\ndistributed in equitable allotments, wherein also those participated\r\nwho had remained at home. Beside the royal share, two hundred of the\r\nlargest and most beautiful pearls were set apart by Vasco Nuñez and his\r\ncompanions as a present for the king, and one of their number, Pedro\r\nde Arbolancha, an intelligent man and trusty friend of the governor,\r\nwas chosen as envoy to proceed immediately to Spain and proclaim\r\nthis important discovery. By him Vasco Nuñez sent the sovereign a\r\nletter detailing his brilliant achievement, and requesting the royal\r\nappointment as governor of the region by him discovered, with the means\r\nto prosecute further adventures on that coast. \"And in all his long\r\nletter,\" says Peter Martyr, \"there is not a single leaf written which\r\ndoes not contain thanks to Almighty God for delivery from perils, and\r\npreservation from many imminent dangers.\" This letter was dated at\r\nAntigua the 4th of March, and a few days after Arbolancha took his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROSPERITY OF THE COLONY.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Balboa was unremitting in his efforts to advance the\r\nprosperity of the growing colony. Having so long suffered the miseries\r\nand inconvenience of a meagre supply of food, particular attention was\r\nturned to agriculture. Indian corn was produced in great quantities,\r\nand seeds of various kinds from Spain were planted, yielding fruit in\r\nabundance. Society became more settled and factions were at rest; for\r\nwho could stand before Vasco Nuñez? Memories of home bloomed anew.\r\nOld-time amusements were again enjoyed; national holidays were regarded,\r\nand jousts and tournaments were held, if not with as rich display as\r\nformerly, yet with heartiness and merrymaking. Two of the pacified\r\ncaciques became discontented and rebelled, but were soon quieted by a\r\nfew men under Diego Hurtado. Another captain, Andrés Garabito, was sent\r\nto explore the country for the shortest and best route between the seas.\r\nPeace everywhere reigned; and with a profusion of food and gold already\r\nin store, with high anticipations regarding the future; with wealth, and\r\ndominion, and honor, and brilliant hopes, and multitudes of heathen for\r\nslaves, ought not these pirates to have been supremely happy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPEDRARIAS DÁVILA ASSUMES THE GOVERNMENT OF DARIEN.\r\n\r\n1514-1515.\r\n\r\n     HOW THE DISCOVERY OF A SOUTHERN SEA WAS REGARDED IN\r\n     SPAIN—THE ENEMIES OF VASCO NUÑEZ AT COURT—PEDRARIAS DÁVILA\r\n     APPOINTED GOVERNOR—DEPARTURE FROM SPAIN AND ARRIVAL AT\r\n     ANTIGUA—ARBOLANCHA IN SPAIN—PEDRARIAS PERSECUTES BALBOA—THE\r\n     KING'S REQUIREMENT OF THE INDIANS—JUAN DE AYORA SENT TO\r\n     PLANT A LINE OF FORTRESSES BETWEEN THE TWO SEAS—WHICH WORK HE\r\n     LEAVES FOR WHOLESALE ROBBERY—BARTOLOMÉ HURTADO SENT TO BRING\r\n     IN THE PLUNDER—DISASTROUS ATTEMPTS TO VIOLATE THE SEPULCHRES\r\n     OF CENÚ—EXPEDITION OF TELLO DE GUZMAN TO THE SOUTH SEA—THE\r\n     SITE OF PANAMÁ DISCOVERED—THE GOLDEN TEMPLE OF DABAIBA ONCE\r\n     MORE—GASPAR DE MORALES AND FRANCISCO PIZARRO VISIT THE SOUTH\r\n     SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Spain the tidings of Balboa's discovery created little less sensation\r\nthan had that of Columbus twenty-two years before. The hypothesis still\r\nobtaining that America was eastern Asia, to what new manifestations\r\nwas not this Southern Sea to lead? Coupled with the belief was the\r\nconcurrent testimony of all the native peoples, that along its shores\r\nwere wealth and industry, gold, pearls, and civilization, hope-inspiring\r\nof replenished coffers to Ferdinand, and to zealous churchmen of\r\nincrease of souls. At last, said the wise men, the opulent kingdoms of\r\nthe eastern Indies which have so long eluded our grasp are opened to us.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Vasco Nuñez, success came late; for prior to the\r\narrival of his messenger in Spain there had been laid a train of\r\nevents which threatened his ruin. Fanned to a yet redder reality by the\r\nargumentative winds of the Atlantic, Enciso's wrath glowed hot as he\r\npictured to the king in only too truthful colors the quality of justice\r\nadministered in his name to his subjects of Antigua. And the bachiller\r\nbecame really happy as he rolled the story of Nicuesa's wrongs, a\r\nsweet morsel, under his tongue, to the utter demolition of his enemies.\r\nZamudio and Vasco Nuñez were condemned, as we have seen, and the king\r\ndetermined to send out a new governor who should investigate and punish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW GOVERNOR.]\r\n\r\nOut of the many applying was chosen a gentleman of Arias in Segovia,\r\nPedro Arias de Ávila, called by Spanish contemporaries Pedrarias, and\r\nby English historians Dávila. He was large of frame, pronounced in mind\r\nand temper, and coarse-grained throughout, the grizzled hair surrounding\r\nhis dark features like the selfish and unholy nature that environed his\r\nswarthy soul. Whence it would appear that he was elderly for so rude a\r\nmission, which was true; but being an officer in good repute, well born\r\nand highly connected,[X-1] and with no lack of fire and stubbornness\r\nremaining, his age was not reckoned so much against him. The nicknames\r\nEl Galan and El Justador were significant of a gay and courtly youth, as\r\nthat of Furor Domini, given him by the monks of the New World, was of a\r\nvirulent old age. He was rich, at least his friends were, so that money\r\nwas at his command. Fonseca favored the appointment—a habit the bishop\r\nhad of looking kindly on those whose petitions were backed by gold. And\r\nso Ferdinand made him governor and captain-general of Castilla del Oro,\r\nwhich was now ordered to be called Castilla Aurífica.[X-2]\r\n\r\nSeveral causes united to favor Pedrarias at this juncture. The arrival\r\nat court of Caicedo and Colmenares, commissioned by the settlers\r\nof Antigua to report the rumors concerning a sea to the south, and\r\nsolicit aid for an expedition in that direction, renewed speculation\r\nand inspired enthusiasm.[X-3] The envoys were graciously received, and\r\npresented by Bishop Fonseca to the king, who listened with attention\r\nto their recitals. \"They often sojourned with me,\" says old Peter\r\nMartyr, \"and their countenances declare the intemperateness of the\r\nair of Darien; for they are yellow like those afflicted with the\r\njaundice,\" or as Oviedo expresses it, \"as yellow as the gold they went\r\nto seek,\" \"and also swollen,\" continues the former, \"the cause whereof\r\nthey ascribe to the hunger endured in times past.\" The air of mystery\r\nenfolding the region, no less than the gold displayed by persons coming\r\nthence, threw over the enterprise a charm which brought to the standard\r\nof Pedrarias hundreds of eager applicants. Then there was the sudden\r\nbreaking-up of the Italian expedition under Gonsalo de Córdoba. The\r\nFrench victory at Ravenna, which threatened King Ferdinand's Neapolitan\r\npossessions, had roused the chivalry of Spain, and when the standard\r\nof the Gran Capitan was raised at Seville, thither flocked youthful\r\ncavaliers and veteran soldiers burning to enlist under the banner of\r\nso great a leader in so glorious a cause. But the king, envious of\r\nthe popularity of his general, in a fit of jealousy countermanded the\r\nexpedition, thus filling the streets of Seville with purposeless men,\r\nmany of whom had sold or pawned their birthright for means to procure\r\nan outfit, and who now preferred any adventure, however desperate,\r\nrather than return in humiliation to their homes. Therefore they hailed\r\nwith rapture this New World enterprise where gold as well as glory\r\nmight be won. Moreover, the success of Portugal in India, with which\r\nSpain's in the west compared unfavorably, and which had engendered both\r\nfear and envy, oiled the wheels of government and unlocked the royal\r\nstrong-box, so that the ducats of Pedrarias were increased in number to\r\nfifty thousand, \"an enormous sum in those days,\" as Quintana observes,\r\n\"in the expenditure of which was manifest the interest and importance\r\nattached to the enterprise.\"[X-4] Arms and ammunition were drawn from\r\nthe royal arsenal; and in place of the heavy iron armor which had proved\r\noppressive in tropical latitudes, were substituted wooden bucklers and\r\ncoats of quilted cotton, proof sufficient against the weapons of the\r\nnatives. The fleet numbered about nineteen sail, with accommodations\r\nfor twelve hundred men. These were soon enrolled, while as many more\r\noffering themselves had of necessity to be refused. Subsequently, by\r\npermission of the Council of the Indies, the number was increased to\r\nfifteen hundred.[X-5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RETINUE OF PEDRARIAS.]\r\n\r\nPedrarias was accompanied by his wife, Isabel de Bobadilla, an estimable\r\nlady, niece to the Marchioness de Moya.[X-6] The other members of his\r\nfamily, consisting of four sons and four daughters, were left in Spain.\r\nAmong the officers were several nobles; and his followers consisted,\r\nas was usual in these mad migrations, of persons of every caste, not\r\nalone the young and naturally thoughtless, but, if we may credit Peter\r\nMartyr, \"no small number of covetous old men\" were of the company.\r\nThey were mostly officials, cavaliers and ecclesiastics, however, for\r\ngoverning, fighting, and preaching offered the chief attractions; and\r\nvery few artisans, agriculturists, or colonists of value in constructing\r\na permanent and prosperous commonwealth. Under the new government a\r\nyoung man from the schools of Salamanca, called the Licenciado Gaspar de\r\nEspinosa, was appointed alcalde mayor; Bachiller Enciso, alguacil mayor;\r\nAlonso de la Puente, treasurer; Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés,\r\nthe historian, veedor or inspector;[X-7] Diego Marquez, contador, and\r\nJuan de Tabira, factor. The fighting men were, first, the governor's\r\nlieutenant, Juan de Ayora, an hidalgo of Córdova, and brother of the\r\nchronicler, Gonzalo de Ayora. Next, captains of hundreds, Luis Carrillo,\r\nFrancisco Dávila, Antonio Tello de Guzman, Diego de Bustamante, Gonzalo\r\nde Badajoz, Diego Albites, Contreras, Gamarra, Villafañe, Atienza,\r\nMeneses, Gonzalo Fernandez de Llago, Francisco Compañon, Francisco\r\nVazquez Coronado de Valdés, Juan de Zorita, Francisco Hernandez, Gaspar\r\nde Morales, cousin of the governor, and a nephew of the governor,\r\nlikewise named Pedrarias, captain of artillery, and others. Several of\r\nthese names became notable, and we shall meet them hereafter. Chief\r\nof the spiritual army, under the title of Bishop of Darien,[X-8] was\r\nJuan de Quevedo, the first prelate to come to Tierra Firme; and with\r\nhim was a company of Franciscan friars. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, then\r\nbut little more than a youth, afterward the chronicler of the Mexican\r\nconquest, came with the expedition, and also Pascual de Andagoya,\r\nHernando de Soto, discoverer of the Mississippi, Benalcázar, who\r\nafterward conquered Quito, and Diego de Almagro, one of the pacificators\r\nof Peru. It was, in truth, a brilliant company. Juan Serrano was chief\r\npilot, he who was subsequently killed with Magellan, the discoverer of\r\nthe strait that now bears that name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REGULATIONS FOR THE COLONY.]\r\n\r\nCemaco's village, still bearing the name of Santa María de la Antigua\r\ndel Darien, was by royal ordinance raised to the title and dignity\r\nof a city, with metropolitan prerogatives, ecclesiastical as well as\r\ncivil. Lengthy instructions were provided the governor by the Council\r\nof the Indies. He was charged to see that his people were properly clad,\r\ncomfortably but not extravagantly; to prohibit the sale or use of cards\r\nand dice; to punish murder, theft, and blasphemy; to tolerate no lawyer\r\nor any ecclesiastical or professional or unprofessional practitioner of\r\nthe law in the colony;[X-9] to take no important step without consulting\r\nthe bishop and other royal officials—an injudicious measure which broke\r\nsociety into factions; to render justice quickly and in accordance with\r\nthe laws of Spain; to be a bright and shining light to the heathen in\r\nall truth and fair honesty; and, last of all, by no means to forget the\r\nking's share of the spoils taken in the exercise of said virtues.[X-10]\r\nThe new governor was furthermore charged to strip from Vasco Nuñez de\r\nBalboa all semblance of authority, and to bring him to a strict account\r\nfor his misdeeds. The survivors of poor Nicuesa's followers were to be\r\ntreated with special leniency, even to the remitting of the king's fifth\r\non their accumulations. All this, it will be remembered, was before the\r\ndiscovery of the South Sea became known in Spain; and that discovery\r\nremained still unrevealed when, on the 11th of April, 1514, after an\r\nostentatious review in the plaza of Seville, the fleet sailed away in\r\ngrand glee from San Lúcar.[X-11] After touching at some of the islands\r\nfor the purpose of capturing Caribs for slaves, and also at Santa Marta\r\nin order to ascertain the fate of eleven Spaniards said to have been\r\nleft there by Rodrigo de Colmenares, the armament reached Darien in\r\nsafety. Significant of the coming rule was an incident which occurred\r\nduring one of the landings. A servant of Pedrarias, named San Martin,\r\nhad failed in respect toward Ayora, the governor's lieutenant, while\r\nashore. Informed of it, Pedrarias ordered Ayora to return immediately\r\nand hang the offender to the first tree, which was done.[X-12]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScarcely had the vessels of Pedrarias disappeared from the shore of\r\nSpain, when the tardy envoy of Vasco Nuñez arrived at court, and craved\r\naudience of the king. Pedro de Arbolancha had unfortunately delayed his\r\ndeparture from Darien for two months after the return of the South Sea\r\ndiscoverers. On this point of time turned the destinies of Vasco Nuñez\r\nand of the New World. Pedrarias would scarcely have been made governor;\r\nPizarro would probably never have become the conqueror of Peru, and\r\nVasco Nuñez might possibly have reached Mexico before Cortés.\r\n\r\nArbolancha was conducted into the royal presence. He displayed his\r\ntreasures and told his tale. The sovereign's heart was touched at the\r\nsoldier's recital. Those pearls! They would make the darkest deeds\r\nresplendent in righteousness. And that new Southern Sea! Surely it\r\nwould wash away far deeper stains than any which sullied the hands of\r\nits gallant discoverer. Oh! that this man had sooner come; for then\r\nthe many thousand ducats spent on old Pedrarias might not have been out\r\nof their box. What this costly armament was sent out to do, a handful\r\nof roving Spaniards had done, under the leadership of a condemned man,\r\nagainst whom the royal wrath up to this moment had burned. And in this\r\nachieving there had been neither much bloodshed nor any cost to Spain;\r\nthe current formulas for securing possession had been observed, and even\r\nthe king's fifth and the king's present were not forgotten. In such\r\nperformance there was manifest no mean mind; any further thought for\r\nthe punishment of so meritorious a cavalier could not be entertained;\r\nand King Ferdinand resolved that Vasco Nuñez should not go unrewarded.\r\nSo rides success triumphant, even sagacious royalty bending its stiff\r\nneck before it.[X-13]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRIVAL OF PEDRARIAS.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pedrarias entered Urabá Gulf and anchored his fleet before\r\nAntigua. Not knowing in what temper the redoubtable chieftain of the\r\ntown might receive a successor, Pedrarias despatched an officer to\r\nacquaint the colonists with his presence, and with the nature of his\r\ncommission. Landing, the messenger asked of the first men he met for\r\ntheir leader. He was pointed where some native workmen were thatching\r\na small cottage under the direction of a man clad in cotton jacket and\r\ndrawers and pack-thread shoes. Now silk and brocade was the covering\r\nthis petty officer had provided himself withal to flaunt it in Italy,\r\nwhile this cotton-clad fellow looked more like a common laborer than the\r\ngovernor of a Spanish colony. Nevertheless the officer knew his duty and\r\napproached the man in cotton respectfully. \"I come from Don Pedrarias\r\nde Ávila,\" said he, \"lately appointed governor of Darien.\"\r\n\r\nIt was sudden; like death, which, even when expected, seems abrupt.\r\nHow swiftly in his brain revolved probabilities and possibilities. With\r\nself-possession and courteous dignity, however, he answered presently:\r\n\"Say to Don Pedrarias that he is welcome to Antigua.\"\r\n\r\nNext day, which was the 30th of June, Pedrarias disembarked. The\r\nlanding, where he formed his brilliant retinue, preparatory to the\r\nentry into the metropolis, was a league from the town. On one side\r\nthe governor held by the hand his wife, Doña Isabel, and on the\r\nother, arrayed in episcopal robes, walked the bishop of Darien, while\r\ndignitaries, officers, cavaliers, and adventurers followed in the line\r\nof march. Near Antigua they were met by the sallow-faced colonists, who,\r\nthough ragged, were rich both in experience and in gold.\r\n\r\nThe two leaders met with great courtesy; Vasco Nuñez was reverent,\r\nPedrarias gracious. Then all went forward to the town, the friars\r\nchanting their Te Deum laudamus for delivery from ocean perils. Vasco\r\nNuñez conducted Pedrarias and the officers to his own dwelling, while\r\nthe remainder of the company were distributed among the colonists. And\r\nsoon a New World repast was spread before the new-comers, consisting\r\nwholly of native products, maize bread, esculent roots, fish, and fruit,\r\nand to drink water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HYPOCRISY AND HATRED.]\r\n\r\nAnd now begins a game played by malevolent craft on one side, and\r\nhonorable frankness on the other, which is unapproached by any of the\r\nNew World trickeries and treacheries. For whatever his faults, whatever\r\nthe pitfalls his tumultuous destiny had spread for him, Vasco Nuñez was\r\nby nature single-hearted and chivalrous, whereas Pedrarias Dávila was\r\nalmost satanic in jealousy and cold hatred.\r\n\r\nSeeking an early interview, the latter assumes an air of friendship,\r\npraises Vasco Nuñez for his abilities, congratulates him on his\r\nsuccesses, and speaks of the high appreciation of the king. And as the\r\nobject of both is only the welfare of the colony, will he not kindly\r\nwrite down what he has done and what he is just now intending to do?\r\nThrown from his guard by this semblance of sincerity, Vasco Nuñez\r\nconsents, and writes not only what will enable Pedrarias to profit by\r\nhis experience, but, as the governor hopes, to occasion his overthrow.\r\nFor the old man is not slow to perceive, on arriving at Antigua and\r\nlearning of the wonderful discovery, that he is now and must be in\r\nreality second in these parts where so lately he was appointed first.\r\nDropping the mask, he institutes charges, and orders Vasco Nuñez to\r\nstand trial for his life.\r\n\r\nAs alcalde mayor, the investigation must be brought before the\r\nlicentiate Espinosa, and he, in conformity with royal instructions, had\r\nto be associated with the bishop Quevedo. Though inexperienced, Espinosa\r\nis honest. As for the prelate—does not the accused pray devoutly, and\r\npay liberally? and does he not send the good bishop gifts of slaves,\r\nand share with him several lucrative enterprises? Go to! He of the\r\ncask is not so great a simpleton after all. He forces even Doña Isabel\r\nto smile upon him. He is acquitted. The enraged Pedrarias then hurls\r\ncivil processes at him, until he is nearly ruined. Enciso meanwhile\r\nmanufactures fresh guilt relative to the affair of Nicuesa. It is of\r\nno use; for the bishop fattens. Pedrarias now swears he will send the\r\nfellow to Spain for trial. This does not suit Quevedo. \"What madness,\"\r\ndrawls the bishop, \"to send a successful man to court. Know you not that\r\nere this all Europe is ringing his praises? Better keep him within your\r\ngrasp; become reconciled, then crush him under your protecting wing.\"\r\nNever is more diabolical mercy solicited for a friend. The governor\r\nperceives more than the prelate intends, and immediately arrays his\r\nvillainy in friendship's smiling garb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmid such profitless pastime, too often the chief occupation of rulers,\r\nthe so lately hilarious fifteen hundred were becoming hungry. The\r\nprovisions they had brought were exhausted. Looking at the five hundred\r\nold settlers, the remnant of other fifteen hundred, the unseasoned\r\nopened speculation as to their own similar contraction. And straightway\r\nthey began to die; twenty a day, until seven hundred were buried in\r\ntheir brocades. Sending under a strong guard some provisions to a secret\r\nspot, at a distance from the town, Pedrarias repaired thither and fed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediate occupation alone could save the survivors. Taking advantage\r\nof Balboa's plans, Pedrarias determined to appropriate to himself the\r\nbenefits of his discovery. Luckily, on hearing of the late discovery,\r\nthe king had written to establish a line of posts from sea to sea,[X-14]\r\nto make settlements, selecting therefor healthy sites, where was good\r\nwater; also to build a town on the shore of San Miguel Gulf, and three\r\nor four caravels likewise, giving them in charge of skilful captains\r\nfor the prosecution of new discoveries in that direction. Accordingly,\r\nat once to plant the line of posts and circumvent any efforts of\r\nVasco Nuñez in that direction, Juan de Ayora with four hundred men was\r\ndespatched across the mountains from Careta.\r\n\r\nWe have found Balboa's policy in his treatment of the natives severe\r\nenough, but that which was now to be inaugurated makes his conduct seem\r\nhumane in comparison. Whatever harsh measures circumstances at times\r\nseemed to him to render necessary, the fact remains that on his return\r\nfrom the South Sea expedition he left the nations friendly.[X-15] In all\r\ntheir bloody pacifyings, probably not one of the New World commanders so\r\nnearly observed the wishes of their Catholic majesties as Vasco Nuñez.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REQUIREMENT OF THE INDIANS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the rules respecting the natives was one directing how war should\r\nbe made, and what the savages must do in order to save themselves and\r\ntheir lands. The formula drawn at an earlier date by a conclave of\r\nSpanish jurists and divines, by which Nicuesa, Ojeda, and others were\r\nto take possession of territories, was superseded by a Requirement of\r\nthe Indians furnished Pedrarias by his sovereign, a translation of which\r\nI give in full below.[X-16] This requirement, which heralded to the\r\nheathen the name of Christ and European civilization in terms ridiculous\r\nand distasteful enough, was mild and logical in its intention as\r\ncompared with the horrors attending its execution. In the instructions\r\naccompanying the _requerimiento_, Pedrarias had been charged never to\r\nwage war unless the Indians were the aggressors, nor until they had been\r\nsummoned to obedience once, twice, three times. This the governor told\r\nhis lieutenant, but Pedrarias likewise told Ayora to send him food and\r\ngold without delay. It was seldom difficult to excite savages to acts\r\nof aggression, and as for reading to the natives the requerimiento, as\r\nrequired by law, that might be done by the notary at his convenience,\r\nbut never so as to interfere with the advantages of a sudden surprise\r\nor preliminary butchery. In a word, the requirement was no less void in\r\npractice than absurd in theory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AYORA'S OUTRAGES.]\r\n\r\nThe first action of Ayora was evidence of this. Ever since the union\r\nof Vasco Nuñez and Careta's daughter, equivalent with the natives to a\r\nmarriage, the most friendly relations had existed between the Spaniards\r\nand Careta's people. Not only did the cacique present his respects\r\nin person to Pedrarias, but many times he sent food to the famishing\r\ncolonists. It seems incredible that creatures in human form, to say\r\nnothing of European or Christian men, should repay such kindness by\r\nsudden, unprovoked attack, such as surprising peaceful villages by\r\nnight, firing the houses, and murdering some of the slumberers while\r\ntaking captive others, all being attended by wanton cruelty and pillage.\r\nYet such was the fate of Careta, Panciaco, and other friends and allies\r\nof Vasco Nuñez. From the accident of conquest, captives for slaves had\r\nbecome one of the objects of conquest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter this brilliant achievement at Careta, Ayora passed on to a small\r\nport which he named Santa Cruz,[X-17] where he planted the initial\r\nsettlement of the line which was to extend from sea to sea. Leaving\r\nthere eighty men, he marched southward, robbing and murdering as he\r\nwent. \"The caciques were tortured to make them disclose their gold,\"\r\nwrites Oviedo. \"Some they roasted, others they threw to the dogs, others\r\nwere hanged.\"[X-18]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HURTADO SENT OUT.]\r\n\r\nIf not for the church, then for himself the good bishop of Darien\r\nwas interested in the spoils of God's enemies everywhere. In Ayora's\r\nmaraudings he had special interest; and no intelligence reaching Antigua\r\nfor some time concerning them, Quevedo suggested to Pedrarias that a\r\nmessenger be sent to ascertain his lieutenant's progress. Bartolomé\r\nHurtado, once the friend of Vasco Nuñez, but anxious now before the\r\nnew powers to wipe out that stain, was accordingly sent to bring in the\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nOn the way, to please Pedrarias, Hurtado sought to excel Ayora in\r\nrapine; but that was impossible. In returning with the plunder, however,\r\nhe stopped at Careta's village and asked for men to carry burdens to\r\nAntigua, and this was readily granted by the chief, anxious as he still\r\nwas for the friendship of the Spaniards. After honorably discharging\r\nhis trust with regard to Ayora and Pedrarias, in manner becoming a\r\nChristian and a cavalier, he selected from Careta's men six of the\r\nfinest specimens and presented them as slaves to the governor; to the\r\nworthy bishop he gave other six; and to Espinosa four. After thus going\r\nthe rounds among the high officials, the remainder were branded and\r\nsold into slavery at public sale.[X-19] Hurtado was forgiven his former\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nEntering the dominions of Tubanamá, Juan de Ayora planted there\r\nanother fortress which he left in charge of Meneses. But instead of\r\ncontinuing his labors across the Isthmus, as ordered, he determined\r\nto give himself wholly up to robbery, and escape the country before\r\nhis offences should be fully known. Following this plan he soon found\r\nhimself overloaded with booty; and, leaving his captains to overrun the\r\nland at pleasure, he returned with his captives, gold, and provisions\r\nto Antigua. The gold, he said, must remain untouched, for future\r\ndivision. The provisions were deposited with the governor, and the\r\ncaptives distributed among the royal officers, who had been sent hither\r\nat the king's cost, to see among other things that the natives were\r\nnot enslaved. Yet Ayora was ill at ease. His dreams and meditations\r\nwere not pleasant; he knew that there must be a day of reckoning when\r\nhis atrocities became known. The villain determined to escape before\r\nthe return of the captains. Making ready with his men, he watched\r\nhis opportunity, and seizing one of the ships lying at the anchorage,\r\nnot unknown to the governor however, as many think, he escaped with\r\nhis booty. Peter Martyr, while acknowledging a long acquaintance with\r\nAyora, says that \"in all the turmoyles and tragicall affayres of the\r\nOcean, nothing hath so muche displeased me, as the couetousnesse of\r\nthis man, who hath so disturbed the pacified minds of the Kinges.\"\r\nAnd \"if Juan de Ayora had been punished for his many injuries to the\r\npeaceable caciques,\" wrote Vasco Nuñez subsequently to the king, \"the\r\nother captains would not have dared to commit like excesses.\"[X-20]\r\n\r\nThe chronicles continue in about the same strain. Shortly after Ayora,\r\nFrancisco Becerra came in from the hunt with gold to the value of\r\nseven thousand pesos de oro, and with over one hundred captives, by the\r\njudicious distribution of which official inquiry was not only quieted,\r\nbut Becerra obtained a new commission. He was sent with one hundred and\r\neighty men and three pieces of artillery to Cenú, to avenge the death\r\nof forty-eight men lost by Francisco de Vallejo some time before. It\r\nwas here that Enciso once attempted to violate the native sepulchres\r\nin search of golden ornaments. Becerra went with the determination to\r\nspare neither age nor sex; but, on landing, the party was decoyed into\r\nambush and every man of them slain by the poisoned arrows of the enemy,\r\na native servant-boy of Becerra alone escaping to carry the news to\r\nAntigua.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESTRUCTION OF SANTA CRUZ.]\r\n\r\nSince the whole region was in arms the eighty men at Santa Cruz found\r\nit every day more difficult to sustain life by stealing. Wherever\r\nthe savages could catch them they repaid their cruelties in kind,\r\ncutting off the limbs with sharp stones, or pouring melted gold down\r\ntheir throats, crying \"Eat! Eat gold, Christians! take your fill of\r\ngold!\"[X-21]\r\n\r\nGrowing yet bolder, Pocorosa collected a large force and captured the\r\nfort, five Spaniards only escaping to Antigua.[X-22] Thus within six\r\nmonths after establishing Santa Cruz, not a vestige of the settlement\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TELLO DE GUZMAN AND ALBITES.]\r\n\r\nAntonio Tello de Guzman was sent with one hundred men to continue the\r\nwork abandoned by Ayora. Departing from Antigua early in November, 1515,\r\nhe proceeded to the province of Tubanamá[X-23] and found the fortress,\r\nin command of Captain Meneses, besieged by the savages, and the garrison\r\nreduced to the last extremity. The place was abandoned, and Meneses\r\nmarched southward with Guzman into the provinces of Chepo and Chepauri.\r\nThere they were met by several caciques combined to oppose them; but\r\nthe savages were persuaded to think better of it. Chepo presented his\r\nvisitors with a large amount of gold and feasted them. While seated at\r\ndinner a young cacique rushed in greatly excited and denounced the host\r\nas a usurper, who had defrauded him of his inheritance. \"Reinstate me,\"\r\nhe urged, \"and I will give you twice the gold Chepo has given.\" The\r\nargument was irresistible. Chepo was hanged; seven of his principal men\r\nwere given to the dogs, and the adjudicators received gold to the value\r\nof six thousand pesos. Then they went their way.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the seaboard they heard a place much spoken of which\r\nthe natives called Panamá. It must be that gold or pearls were there,\r\nthe Spaniards thought; for how otherwise could any place be famous? On\r\nreaching it, however, they were disappointed to find only a collection\r\nof fishermen's huts, the word _panamá_, in the aboriginal tongue,\r\nsignifying \"a place where many fish are taken.\"[X-24] Resting here with\r\npart of his company, Tello de Guzman despatched Diego de Albites with\r\neighty men to the rich province of Chagre, ten leagues distant; and\r\nthis captain plumes himself, and we permit him in God's name, that he\r\ndid not murder the sleepy savages when, roused at dead of night, they\r\ngazed with stolid astonishment on their strange visitors, and promptly\r\npaid twelve hundred pesos for the privilege to be left alive. Acquiring\r\nso much so easily, Albites deemed it only proper to demand more, and\r\nhanding another large sack to the cacique, he told him to fill it with\r\ngold. \"I can fill your sack with stones from the brook,\" was the reply,\r\n\"but I cannot make gold, neither have I any more.\" Even for this the\r\ngood Albites did not cast him to the dogs, but took his departure for\r\nPacora,[X-25] where joined by Guzman the entire company returned to\r\nTubanamá.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus far the expedition of Tello de Guzman had been prosperous, and\r\nmore important than he himself imagined, for his was the first visit\r\nof Spaniards to the site of the afterwards renowned city of Panamá.\r\nHence to Antigua, however, the march was distressing. Elated by his\r\nsuccess at Santa Cruz, Pocorosa appeared at Tubanamá; with an increased\r\nforce. Hoisting as banners the bloody raiment of slain Christians, the\r\nsavages brandished their gory pennons on every hillside, crying, \"Behold\r\nthe fate of the accursed, who leave their homes to mar the peace of\r\nunoffending nations.\" All along down the mountain and over the burning\r\nplain of Darien to the very threshold of Antigua, the Spaniards fought\r\na hidden foe, who never offered pitched battle, but so harassed them\r\nthat ofttimes they were on the point of throwing away their heavy plates\r\nof gold, and lying down to die from thirst, hunger, and exhaustion.\r\nNevertheless they arrived at Antigua with many slaves and much treasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this time Vasco Nuñez was left in the background; and while such\r\ndastardly doings were in order it was as well for every honorable man\r\nto remain unoccupied. It was hard, however, to remain idle; and in an\r\nevil moment, at the earnest solicitations of the old comrades who had\r\nno confidence in any other leader, he consented to take part in another\r\nexpedition to Dabaiba, in search of the gold and the golden temple\r\nthere. It was a desperate undertaking, as the former adventure had\r\nproved, but the colony was an Ixion's wheel that kept the government\r\never moving.\r\n\r\nWhen two hundred men were ready, and the question of leadership arose,\r\nPedrarias named Luis Carrillo; but there were those who would not go\r\nexcept under Vasco Nuñez. Then it occurred to the governor to divide the\r\nleadership in such a way that if the expedition proved successful his\r\nown captain should have the credit, and if a failure, the blame should\r\nfall upon his enemy. And so it was arranged, to the infinite disgust of\r\nBalboa, who plainly saw the governor's purpose, and would have declined\r\ncould he have done so without prejudice to his friends. Embarking in\r\nJune, 1515, and ascending the Atrato for some distance, the expedition\r\nwas suddenly surrounded by hostile canoes which darted simultaneously\r\nfrom beneath the foliage overhanging either bank. The Spaniards were\r\ntaken at a disadvantage; for beside attacking them with wooden lances\r\nthe savages, who were more expert upon the water than the Spaniards,\r\ndived under and overturned their canoes, to the destruction of one\r\nhalf the expedition. Among the lost was Luis Carrillo. The one hundred\r\nsurvivors found their way back to Antigua with no small difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPEDITION UP THE ATRATO.]\r\n\r\nOne might think that this would be enough of the golden temple for the\r\npresent. But not so. These men were not Castilians if danger and defeat\r\nacted otherwise than as stimulants to new adventure. Furthermore, like\r\nthe honors of the arena which are magnified by the difficulties of their\r\nattainment, the mysterious dominion so stubbornly defended must hold\r\ngreat treasure, and in the inflamed minds of the Spaniards the savage\r\npantheon of Dabaiba had risen into a lofty edifice glittering with gold\r\nand gems, and situated in a region rich and beautiful beyond comparison.\r\nAnd Juan de Tabira, the factor, was confident he could capture it, as\r\nlikewise was Juan de Birues the inspector. They would build three light\r\nbrigantines; and with these, and a small fleet of canoes, and, say one\r\nhundred and sixty men, bid defiance to the demon host of Dabaiba. This\r\nthey did, Tabira commanding. The cost fell heavy on the factor, but the\r\nking's chest helped him out, if Herrera speaks truly.\r\n\r\nAs hitherto, the invaders were attacked, but the savages were easily\r\nbeaten off. Not so the goddess of the golden temple, who sent such a\r\nflood as uprooted trees, overturned the factor's vessel, and drowned\r\namong others both Tabira and Birues. Francisco Pizarro being of the\r\nparty was asked to assume command and continue up the river, but he\r\ndeclined, and further efforts in that direction were abandoned.[X-26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A VISIT TO THE PEARL ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nRumors arriving from Spain of the recognition by the India Council of\r\nthe services and merits of Vasco Nuñez, Pedrarias hastened to move men\r\nto the southern seaboard, lest he should see his enemy placed in power\r\nthere. For this mission were chosen the governor's cousin, Gaspar de\r\nMorales, and Francisco Pizarro, to whom were given sixty men.[X-27] They\r\nwere told to cross the mountains by the shortest route, and, taking\r\npossession of the Pearl Islands found and named by Vasco Nuñez, to\r\ngather the fruit thereof. The object of the Europeans in attacking the\r\nislanders was, of course, to extend the boundaries of their enlightened,\r\njust, and humane civilization, and bring the benighted heathen to a\r\nknowledge of the Christian religion. True, they might gather a little\r\ngold, or pick up such pearls as fell in their way, for the laborer is\r\nworthy of his hire.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the seashore, Morales quartered half of his men, under\r\nPeñalosa, on a cacique named Tutibrá, and the remainder on the\r\nneighboring chieftain, Tunaca. Chiapes and Tumaco, still loyal to the\r\nSpaniards, joined them there. Every requisite, food, boats, and men,\r\nwas provided by the savages with alacrity, for they who should despoil\r\ntheir ancient enemy were welcome.\r\n\r\nOne day, just before dark, Morales and Pizarro with thirty Spaniards\r\nand a large company of natives embarked in a fleet of canoes, but\r\nso boisterous was the sea that they were unable to reach the islands\r\nbefore the next day. Landing on one of the smaller islands and meeting\r\nbut slight resistance, the invaders passed over to Isla Rica, as it\r\nwas called by Vasco Nuñez, the largest of the group, where dwelt the\r\nterrible king, who made the caciques of the mainland tremble, and who\r\nnow, nothing daunted, came forward at the head of his warriors and\r\nfought the strangers bravely. And notwithstanding Castilian gunpowder,\r\nsteel, and bloodhounds heaping in lifeless masses before his eyes his\r\nbest and bravest, the stubborn king fought on as if he knew not how\r\nto yield. Finally Chiapes and Tumaco spoke to him, and showed how vain\r\nresistance was, how valuable the friendship of the strangers. Believing\r\nthis, the island monarch submitted, and brought the Spaniards to the\r\nspacious palace, as the old chroniclers called his house, and set before\r\nthem a basket of large and lustrous pearls to satisfy their avaricious\r\nsouls. In return the king was made passing rich by a present of a\r\nfew cheap hand-mirrors, some hawk-bells and hatchets, and exhibited\r\nalmost as foolish a delight over his trinkets as did the Europeans over\r\ntheirs. \"Commend me to the friendship of these gods,\" cried the king,\r\nas he sought his swarthy other self behind the mirror, and jingled the\r\nhawk-bells, so much more beautiful than pearls, and tried the keen edge\r\nof his hatchet on the skull of a slave standing by. Embracing Morales he\r\nled him to a tower which crowned the dwelling, and commanded a view of\r\nthe isle-dotted ocean on every side. \"Behold,\" he said, \"the infinite\r\nsea extending beyond the sunbeams; behold these islands on the right\r\nhand and on the left. All are mine; all abound in pearls, whereof you\r\nshall have as many as desired if you continue my friend.\" He also spoke\r\nof the nations of the distant mainland whose mighty power was evidenced\r\nby the ships which he had sometimes seen.\r\n\r\nMorales readily promised eternal friendship, stipulating only that one\r\nhundred marks of pearls should be annually paid the king of Castile,\r\nand to this assented the king of Dites,[X-28] as the natives called\r\nIsla Rica. In order, so far as possible, to render insignificant\r\nthe achievement of Vasco Nuñez, Morales had been instructed to take\r\npossession of the South Sea for the king of Spain in the name of\r\nPedrarias. This was now done. The name of Isla de Flores was substituted\r\nfor that of Isla Rica, and the holy rite of baptism was administered to\r\nthe king, who received the name Pedro Arias.[X-29]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MISFORTUNES OF MORALES.]\r\n\r\nThe good fortune of Morales now forsook him. On returning to the\r\nmainland he found that the country was in arms, owing to the excesses of\r\nPeñalosa, who was a relative of Isabel, wife of Pedrarias. The villain\r\nhad repaid the hospitality of Tutibrá by outrages on his women, and the\r\nchieftains had in consequence confederated for the protection of their\r\nhomes. In revenge for this Morales spread fire and sword throughout that\r\nregion. On one occasion eighteen caciques, called to a friendly council,\r\nwere treacherously seized and given to the dogs; at another time seven\r\nhundred savages are said to have been slain within an hour. But in\r\nburning the village of a cacique named Birú,[X-30] on the eastern side\r\nof the gulf, the Spaniards were repulsed, and in attempting to cross\r\nthe mountains to Darien they lost their way, and after considerable\r\nwandering and suffering found themselves back at the starting-point.\r\nAgain they essayed the transit, a handful of men amidst infuriated\r\nhosts. In retaliation for night attacks, and darts showered by day from\r\ncliffs and thickets, the Europeans strewed their path with murdered and\r\nmutilated captives to the number of one hundred, hoping to intimidate\r\nthe enemy, who was only the more maddened thereby. Thus, midst this\r\nbloody disturbance, which in ferocity far exceeded anything of which\r\nwild beasts are capable, this band of Spanish marauders escaping their\r\njust deserts, managed with great tribulation to reach their settlement,\r\nstill clinging to the gold and pearls.[X-31]\r\n\r\nTo Gaspar de Morales Vasco Nuñez pays the same encomiums as to the other\r\ncaptains of Pedrarias. \"Be it known to your Majesty,\" he writes, \"that\r\nduring this excursion was perpetrated the greatest cruelty ever heard\r\nof in Arabian or Christian country, in any generation. And this it is.\r\nThis captain and the surviving Christians while on their journey took\r\nnearly one hundred Indians of both sexes, mostly women and children,\r\nfastened them with chains, and afterward ordered them to be decapitated\r\nand scalped.\" But \"being cousin and servant of the governor,\" adds\r\nOviedo, he suffers \"neither pain nor punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDARIEN EXPEDITIONS UNDER PEDRARIAS.\r\n\r\n1515-1517.\r\n\r\n     GONZALO DE BADAJOZ VISITS THE SOUTH SEA—WHAT HE SEES\r\n     AT NOMBRE DE DIOS—HIS DEALINGS WITH TOTONAGUA—AND WITH\r\n     TATARACHERUBI—ARRIVES AT NATÁ—THE SPANIARDS GATHER MUCH\r\n     GOLD—THEY ENCOUNTER THE REDOUBTABLE PARIS—A DESPERATE\r\n     FIGHT—BADAJOZ LOSES HIS GOLD AND RETURNS TO DARIEN—PEDRARIAS\r\n     ON THE WAR-PATH—HE STRIKES CENÚ A BLOW OF REVENGE—ACLA\r\n     FOUNDED—THE GOVERNOR RETURNS ILL TO ANTIGUA—EXPEDITION\r\n     OF GASPAR DE ESPINOSA TO THE SOUTH SEA—THE LICENTIATE'S\r\n     ASS—ROBBERY BY LAW—ESPINOSA'S RELATION—A BLOODY-HANDED\r\n     PRIEST—ESPINOSA AT NATÁ—HE COURTS THE ACQUAINTANCE OF\r\n     PARIS—WHO KILLS THE AMBASSADORS—HURTADO SURVEYS THE\r\n     SOUTHERN SEABOARD TO NICOYA—PANAMÁ FOUNDED—AN ABORIGINAL\r\n     TARTARUS—RETURN OF ESPINOSA'S EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these expeditions were directed to the east side of Panamá Bay,\r\nother captains were equally active on the west side.\r\n\r\nGonzalo de Badajoz embarked at Antigua for the South Sea in March, 1515,\r\nwith one hundred and thirty men.[XI-1] Landing at Nombre de Dios, where\r\nno white man had touched since Nicuesa's departure, a dismal spectacle\r\nwas there presented. The dismantled fort stood surrounded by tenantless\r\ndwellings, whose walls were once the silent witnesses of despair; while\r\ncrosses, heaps of stone, and dead men's scattered bones, seemed to tell\r\nhow restless were these adventurers even in their last resting. The\r\nmost impassive of all that callous company was struck by a momentary\r\nshudder as he gazed on these ghastly portents of his own probable fate;\r\nand they would have turned back on the spot had not their leader hurried\r\nthe ships away beyond their reach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVENTURES OF BADAJOZ.]\r\n\r\nThe versatile adventurer quickly recovers himself, however, and what is\r\nmore wonderful is the indifference with which sanguinary recitals often\r\nrepeated are soon received. The homely adage that familiarity breeds\r\ncontempt is nowhere more strikingly true than in our own intercourse\r\nwith danger, pain, and death. It is not altogether a Hibernicism to\r\nsay that men get used to these things, even to hanging. And when the\r\noft-repeated disasters are distant, and only the survivors with their\r\nprizes are present, the terrible tale makes still less impression. That\r\ncolony after colony in the New World occupation should be swept away or\r\ndivided by death, and divided yet again, ten times, or twenty times cut\r\nin twain; or that expedition after expedition should return to Antigua,\r\nleaving half or two thirds of its number rotting on the heated plain,\r\nor scattered in the mountains furnishing food for carrion-birds, and\r\nyet new colonists continue to come out, and new expeditions continue\r\nto be organized by those willing to take the same even chances of never\r\nreturning, shows an ignorance, or indifference, or both, to which fear\r\nof consequences is as inaccessible as ever was the feeling of love to\r\nNarcissus.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Badajoz was the usual one. He was to cross the Isthmus\r\nat its narrowest part, take possession of the country, and gather in\r\nits treasures. We all know what this implied. Were any but civilized\r\nChristians so to do it would be called murder, robbery, treachery,\r\nviolation, and the rest.\r\n\r\nTotonagua was the first victim on this occasion. His dominions were\r\nof great extent and thickly peopled, the village where he resided\r\nstanding on the mountains opposite Nombre de Dios. Surprised by night\r\nhe surrendered gold to the value of six thousand pesos. Tataracherubi,\r\na wealthy cacique on the southern side, was similarly relieved of gold\r\nto the value of eight thousand pesos. Seeing the Spaniards so deeply\r\nin love with gold, Tataracherubi told them of a chief named Natá, some\r\ndistance to the south-west, very rich and with few fighting men. Thirty\r\nmen under Alonso Perez de la Rua were deemed ample for the adventure,\r\nbut after a night's march the Spaniards found themselves, as morning\r\nbroke, in the midst of a cluster of villages belonging to a numerous\r\nand warlike people. Retreat was impossible, and not a moment was to\r\nbe lost. Rushing for the principal village they seized the leading\r\ncacique, Natá,[XI-2] and were masters of the situation. For when the\r\nsavages pressed them hard in the fight that followed, and would have\r\nslain them all, they threatened Natá with instant death if he did not\r\ncause his men to lay down their arms. Natá obeyed. Presently Badajoz\r\njoined Perez, and the chief was released to collect for his captors\r\ngold in value to fifteen thousand castellanos. After remaining at Natá\r\ntwo months the conquerors surprised the village of Escoria, ten leagues\r\nto the southward, and secured gold[XI-3] to the value of nine thousand\r\npesos. Westward from Escoria lived Biruquete[XI-4] and a blind neighbor,\r\nwho were relieved of six thousand pesos worth of gold. In the vicinity\r\nwere the villages of Taracuri, Pananome, Tabor, and Chirú, where the\r\nSpaniards obtained another considerable quantity of gold.\r\n\r\nGonzalo de Badajoz was gathering a rich harvest. Thus far his\r\naccumulations reached eighty thousand castellanos, equivalent to\r\nmore than half a million of dollars at the present day. It was not a\r\ndisagreeable way of making money. It was quite honorable stealing in the\r\neyes of the plunderers themselves, although the stupid savages never\r\ncould wholly make out the right of it. In addition to gold there were\r\nalways plenty of women for slavery, and so the adventurers who for these\r\nbenefits had staked their lives were happy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CACIQUE PARIS.]\r\n\r\nElated by their successes, the conquerors continued the good work. Not\r\nfar from Chirú were the dominions of a cacique called by the Spaniards\r\nParizao Pariba, subsequently abbreviated into Paris.[XI-5] Advised\r\nof their approach Paris fled to the mountains with all his people and\r\ntreasure. Badajoz sent a message threatening to put the dogs upon his\r\ntrack unless he returned. Paris returned word that he was exceedingly\r\noccupied and hoped the Spanish captain would excuse his coming. He\r\nbegged him, however, to accept an accompanying gift from his women,\r\nand wished him a prosperous journey out of the country. The gift so\r\ncarelessly presented was carried by four principal men in baskets made\r\nof the withes of palm-leaves and lined with deerskins. In dimensions\r\nthey were about one and a half by two feet, and three inches in depth.\r\nThe contents consisted of fabricated gold, breast-plates, bracelets and\r\near-rings, valued, as the Spaniards affirmed, at forty or fifty thousand\r\ncastellanos.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo much treasure so royally presented only excited their cupidity the\r\nmore. Thanking the savages, Badajoz retired with his men, but as soon\r\nas Paris returned to the village, he surprised it at night and obtained\r\nas much more gold as had already been sent. This greediness resulted\r\nin their ruin. Paris sent out upon the road one of his principal men\r\nwho was instructed, when captured, to pass himself off as belonging\r\nto an adjoining village, three leagues distant, and to say that it\r\nwas well stocked with gold. He was on his way to the river to fish,\r\nbut would show them his town. The strategy succeeded. Badajoz sent\r\na portion of the men under his guidance to bring in the treasure.\r\nMeanwhile Paris had raised an army of four thousand warriors, and the\r\ninvaders being now divided, as had been designed, he fiercely attacked\r\nand almost exterminated one part before the other could join it. The\r\nSpaniards fought until seventy of their number were slain, whereupon\r\nthey abandoned the treasure, cut their way through the savages, and\r\nfled to the territory of Chame.[XI-6] Thence they crossed to an island\r\noccupied by Tabor, and afterward to Taboga Island, where they remained\r\nfor thirty days recruiting their strength for the desperate attempt to\r\nreach Darien. This they finally accomplished, but Perez de la Rua lost\r\nhis life immediately on returning to the mainland. Since they failed to\r\nbring home the gold of which their stories were full, we may each of us\r\nbelieve them according to our faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ATTACK ON CENÚ.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1515 was now drawing toward its close. It had been clouded with\r\nmore than one disaster, and Pedrarias was anything but pleased. Himself\r\na fighting man as well as civil officer, he determined to show his young\r\ncaptains what an old man could do in the field; for whatever his general\r\ncharacter, and it was detestable enough, Pedrarias was not a coward.\r\nHis first blow was to be directed against the Cenú people, toward whom\r\nhe had not felt kindly since the slaughter of the two companies under\r\nVallejo and Becerra. What right had these savages to kill Spaniards? And\r\nyet were his purpose known of entering within range of those poisoned\r\narrows he would have few followers to the wars. An expedition of three\r\nhundred men was therefore organized ostensibly against Pocorosa, and\r\nwith this he coasted westward until after night-fall, when he ordered\r\nthe pilots to turn back and make for Cenú, whose tristful shore the next\r\nmorning saw them close approaching. Anchoring, Hurtado was sent with two\r\nhundred men to fire the village and do what killing was convenient. He\r\nmanaged to cut in pieces a few women and children as they escaped the\r\nflames, and secure some captives for slaves, but the poisoned arrows\r\nsoon terminated the sport, and the expedition turned again toward the\r\nprovince of Pocorosa.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the governor was to found at least two posts of the line\r\nordained by the king, but which his captains had failed to establish.\r\nPedrarias resolved that the termini of the intended line on either ocean\r\nshould be at once selected and town-building begun. Coasting westward\r\nin search of a site he came to a pleasant port, northward of Careta,\r\nbeyond which extended a dry and fertile plain with timber suitable\r\nfor ship-building, and from which led a now well-known route across\r\nthe Isthmus. The natives called the place Acla,[XI-7] that is to say,\r\n'Bones of Men.' There the governor began to build a wooden fort with\r\nsuch enthusiasm as not only to direct the laborers, but to assist them\r\nwith his hands, until excess of zeal brought on a fever which rendered\r\nit necessary for him to be carried bedridden to Antigua. Gabriel de\r\nRojas was left in command of the unfinished enterprise, and Gaspar de\r\nEspinosa with a stout force was permitted to try the fortunes of war on\r\nthat permanent object of the spoiler, Pocorosa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LICENTIATE'S ASS.]\r\n\r\nIt seems that the youthful magistrate on finding his official duties\r\nspiritless without the mellow growl and inane wit of pettifogger or\r\npundit, had laid aside the long-robe and buckled on the sword, this\r\nbeing in his opinion the more significant emblem in the arbitration of\r\nIndian affairs. And as the highest wisdom is that which adapts learning\r\nto the duties of the day, the licentiate would not be bound by the\r\nmechanical restrictions which governed the illiterate cavaliers in their\r\nencounters with the natives. There are some whom travel improves but\r\nlittle, though like Haddad Ben Ahab, they should climb to the top of the\r\nworld's wall and look down the other side. Our juvenile judge was not\r\none of these. _Bonum est fugienda adspicere in alieno malo_, was his\r\nmotto. It is good to note in the misfortunes of others what we should\r\navoid, for so Publius Syrus has said. He would go to the wars as a\r\nwarrior, not plodding his way wearily over mountain and through morass,\r\nlike a common foot-soldier, but he would enter the domain of the enemy\r\nmounted, and in a manner becoming a general and a judge. Athena went to\r\nwar mounted on a lion, Alexander on a horse, Espinosa on—an ass. History\r\ngives the licentiate this honor, and as an honest man I cannot deny it\r\nhim; he was the first to cross the Isthmus on an ass. Some horses had\r\nof late been brought to Antigua, which were employed to a very limited\r\nextent in the wars of Tierra Firme and also on the present occasion; but\r\nthe alcalde mayor preferred to bestride an ass; it was a more judicial\r\nbeast, not say surer-footed or more safe. Moreover, it was staid, and\r\nnot liable to rush recklessly into battle. There was another advance.\r\nSeveral pieces of artillery were dragged across the Isthmus in this\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nWhen the savages first beheld the conquering hero borne triumphantly\r\nthrough crowds of admiring spectators, they fell back dumbfounded. They\r\nknew the force of Spanish steel; bloodhounds they knew, and arquebuses\r\nvomiting fire and hurling thunderbolts. But what was this? Its eyes were\r\nnot fiery, nor its nostrils distended, nor its teeth flesh-tearing.\r\nIts countenance betokened mildness, and mind-absence, such as attend\r\nbenevolent contemplation; there was in it nothing of that refined lust\r\nor voracious piety which characterized the faces of the Spaniards. And\r\nsurely Apollo was in error when he gave Midas such ears because he could\r\nnot appreciate music. For listen to its notes. Ah, that voice! When Sir\r\nBalaam lifted up his voice the savages fled in terror. Tremblingly they\r\nreturned and enquired for what the creature was asking. The Spaniards\r\nreplied that he was asking for gold; and during the campaign his musical\r\nbeast brought the licentiate more gold than did ever Leoncico earn for\r\nVasco Nuñez. And throughout that region the learned licentiate became\r\nknown to the natives by the noble animal that he bestrode, so much so\r\nthat those who entered the Spaniard's camp to see the general used to\r\nannounce their object by braying like an ass, an appeal to which the\r\nchief officer ever obligingly responded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs alcalde mayor it was the duty of Espinosa at all times and in all\r\nplaces to administer the law. For so God and the king had commanded;\r\nso he had sworn to do. Now it was often somewhat inconvenient to rob\r\nand murder at pleasure, even under the liberal provisions of the king's\r\nRequirement, according to the governor's ideas of business. Therefore\r\nit was deemed wise and prudent to issue an edict from the imperial city\r\nof Antigua declaring all Americans in arms against the Europeans to be\r\noutlaws, doomed to slavery, mutilation, or death. Those who had taken\r\npart in the destruction of Santa Cruz should be burned; and it was quite\r\nremarkable in so young a jurist how quickly he determined, no matter\r\nhow distant the evidence, whenever the destruction of a people, while\r\npromoting the sovereignty of law, would at the same time yield profit\r\nto the lawgiver.\r\n\r\nThe judge had not proceeded far upon his new circuit before he met\r\nBadajoz, who was returning dejectedly to Antigua, suffering from the\r\neffects of excessive cupidity. Informed of the immense treasure Badajoz\r\nhad failed to bring back, Espinosa wrote Pedrarias for more men that\r\nhe might go and gather it. Badajoz claimed the command as a right; but\r\nPedrarias said, \"Not so; Espinosa is alcalde mayor; furthermore, Captain\r\nBadajoz brings back neither slaves nor gold wherewith to purchase\r\nfavor.\" With this the licentiate received one hundred and thirty\r\nadditional men under Gerónimo Valenzuela. So great was becoming the\r\nabhorrence of the colonists for these hazardous and unholy adventures\r\nthat this captain, in conformity to his instructions, scuttled his ship\r\non reaching Acla, in order to deprive the men of the means for returning\r\nto Antigua.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCæsar's Commentaries on the Gallic wars are not more minute in detail\r\nthan the narration[XI-8] of incidents during this expedition as given\r\nby Espinosa to the governor. The licentiate was exceedingly careful\r\nin every instance, first of all to propitiate the law by observing its\r\nsmallest letter, such as reading and expounding the king's Requirement,\r\nand never to rob or kill the natives except in the name of the king of\r\nSpain, and the rights of man. His judicial conscience thus quieted, he\r\nwent to work with a will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPOPULATION OF THE PROVINCES.]\r\n\r\nThe provinces of Pocorosa and Comagre were at this time almost\r\ndepopulated, and the licentiate could with difficulty obtain food for\r\nthe men or exercise for his arms. On the approach of the Spaniards,\r\nthe poor remnants of these once happy nations fled affrighted to\r\ntheir hiding-places. This the learned licentiate ruled _ipso jure_ a\r\ndeclaration of hostilities; in a word, if the law could not be twisted\r\nto fit the occasion, the chief guardian of the law, himself turned\r\nlaw-breaker and spoiler, was as ready to throw overboard the law as\r\nwas the most lawless cavalier. Whole nations, I say, were declared\r\noutlaws by the honorable chief judge, because they would not come\r\nforward and embrace slavery of their own free will. If any fugitives\r\nwere particularly hard to catch, that was proof of participation in the\r\nSanta Cruz affair, and they were burned according to law.\r\n\r\nThe caprice of the law, however, does not exhibit the pretensions\r\nof civilization and Christianity in these parts in their grossest\r\nabsurdity. In the outrageous raids under Pedrarias, the most revolting\r\ncrimes were committed in the name of religion. The itching palm of\r\nQuevedo, the bishop, has been more than once referred to; and now we see\r\nhis dean actually enter the field of inhumanity in person against the\r\nunhappy natives. The licentiate writes: \"We proceeded on our way about\r\none league and a half to Poquina's land, where the Indians set fire to\r\ntheir huts and ran away. I sent the dean with one squad, and Ojeda with\r\nanother, and they brought back some Indians, the number whereof will\r\nappear in the distribution. I gave Chiarna some of these Indians, and\r\nthat overpaid him for the provisions he had furnished us.\" Unfortunately\r\nthis is not the only instance we are doomed to encounter in this\r\nhistory, of a priest disgracing the faith by placing himself beside\r\nbloodhounds and bloody-minded men, and joining a hunt, in Christ's name,\r\nto bring innocent men and women and children to slavery and death.\r\n\r\nAfter sending to Santa Cruz in the hope of finding provisions from\r\nAntigua, \"we went to the province of Tamame,\" continues Espinosa,\r\n\"whence I sent all the captains to explore the Rio Grande,[XI-9] on both\r\nbanks, as I had been informed that Pocorosa's people were there hiding.\r\nSome Indians were caught, as will appear in the distribution, five\r\nof whom were burnt to ashes, on confessing their participation in the\r\nmurders of Santa Cruz.\" Indeed, \"I used to send men after the Indians,\r\nand justice was done upon all those who had participated in the Santa\r\nCruz outrage, either by hanging or burning, and two were shot off from\r\nthe cannon's mouth the more to frighten them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ESPINOSA ON THE PACIFIC.]\r\n\r\nCrossing the Cordillera by way of Tubanamá and Chepo to Panamá, where he\r\nhoped to obtain food, but found only some huts and one woman, Espinosa\r\npassed on to Chirú, sending out his captains in every direction for\r\nplunder. At Chame the Spaniards found only four Indians; and as the\r\nchief had furnished corn to Badajoz, they did not molest him. The\r\ncacique of Chirú was captured with his women and gold, by Hurtado, but\r\nappearing peaceable he was liberated, and made the custodian of some\r\nslaves, and ornaments for the mass, for a church was to be organized on\r\nthe shores of Pacific. Chirú sent Espinosa iguanas to eat, and _chicha_,\r\nfish, deer, and salt, and was given some hammocks in return.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Spaniards charged on Natá one night, securing one hundred\r\ncaptives, and gold to the value of fifteen hundred castellanos. The\r\ncacique escaped, and rallying his warriors prepared to attack the\r\nSpaniards; but when the natives saw the horses they fled in terror,\r\nfearing that they would be torn in pieces by them. As it was, the\r\nhorsemen pursued the fugitives and hewed them down in great numbers.\r\nEspinosa marvelled at the multitudes of people he here encountered, and\r\nat the number of their villages. He found also an abundance of maize,\r\nfish, and deer, and there were geese and turkeys. Four months' supply of\r\ncorn was at once secured for the army; and for better protection during\r\nthe sojourn palisades were erected.\r\n\r\nOne morning while the licentiate was reposing in his lodge, Natá with\r\none attendant rushed unceremoniously into his presence, desperation\r\ndepicted in their countenances, and with empty quivers in their hands.\r\n\"You are too strong for me,\" cried the chief. \"You have taken my\r\nwarriors, my wives, my children; do with me as you please.\" Espinosa\r\nreceived him kindly, returned him his wives and children, and told\r\nhim to bring his people from their hiding-places and fear nothing. The\r\ngold which had been taken from Badajoz was then demanded of him, but\r\nNatá denied having any of it, saying that Paris had kept it all. Being\r\nwell established here the Spaniards proceeded against the neighboring\r\nprovinces. The people fled, but were compelled by hunger to return.\r\nAmong the captives taken some were employed in planting, and if any\r\nbecame unruly they were hanged. Others assisted in building a little\r\nchapel, for the zealous dean had now sheathed his bloody sword to preach\r\nthrough an interpreter the glad tidings of good-will to man, and many\r\nwere baptized.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a deputation composed of the natives of Natá was sent to the\r\ncacique Paris, demanding his allegiance to the king of Spain, and the\r\nrestoration of the gold taken from Badajoz. Paris replied by hanging\r\nall the ambassadors, save two, by whom he sent back word that every\r\nChristian caught within his territories would be treated in like manner.\r\nThe licentiate prepared immediately to march against the redoubtable\r\nchieftain.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July, 1516, every member of the army was confessed by\r\nthe priest. Vows were made to Our Lady of Antigua, \"and in the name\r\nof God,\" says the licentiate, \"we began our journey.\" Hurtado had been\r\nsent with fifty men to Escoria, and the ruler of that province together\r\nwith Chirú and Natá was forced to accompany the expedition against\r\nParis.[XI-10] The inhabitants melted before the invaders, and it was\r\nwith difficulty that men could be captured for guides. The Spaniards\r\nhad not advanced far before they learned that a council had been held\r\nby the chiefs confederated for self-protection, to determine whether\r\nthe gold taken from Badajoz should be returned. Some were in favor of\r\nrestoring it; but others objected that, this being given up, as much\r\nmore would be demanded, and since fight they must in either case, it\r\nwas agreed to do so before surrendering the treasure. It so happened\r\nthat Diego Albites with eighty men was marching in advance, and coming\r\nto a rivulet he espied some Indians hidden under the bank and undertook\r\nto capture them. Instantly the country was alive with savages; Albites\r\nfound himself surrounded by four thousand of the enemy, wholly cut off\r\nfrom the main body. The Spaniards fought desperately for six hours,\r\nand would have been destroyed had not Espinosa appeared and let loose\r\nupon the assailants the bloodhounds and the horsemen. Twenty caciques\r\nand a host of warriors were slain, and many of the Spaniards were badly\r\nwounded. \"That night we slept upon the battle-field,\" says Espinosa,\r\n\"and next day I threw up a protection of palisades and sent out in\r\nsearch of the cacique Paris.\" The cunning chief had burned his village\r\nand fled, thus leaving the invaders neither gold nor provisions.\r\nAlbites went out to forage, with instructions to fire a cannon in case\r\nof danger. Nine times that night the licentiate heard the report of a\r\ngun, and was not a little alarmed for the safety of the captain. Great\r\nwas his joy, therefore, when early in the morning Valenzuela appeared\r\nwith reinforcement of one hundred men from Antigua and informed the\r\nlicentiate that it was he who had fired the guns while in search of the\r\ncommander's camp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VALENZUELA JOINS ESPINOSA.]\r\n\r\nEspinosa having now three hundred men felt himself strong enough to\r\nprosecute discovery according to the full tenor of his instructions,\r\nwhich were to explore the coast westward as far as practicable. As a\r\nfirst step he sent a detachment of eighty men under Valenzuela into the\r\nprovince of Guararí, near the seashore, in search of trees for canoes.\r\nMeanwhile the treasure lost by Badajoz must if possible be found before\r\nabandoning these parts. Companies were sent out in various directions\r\nunder Albites, Hurtado, and Pedro de Gamez, between whom arose no small\r\nrivalry for securing the honor of the capture. Their purpose was to\r\nseize the caciques and wring from them the secret by torture. At length\r\nGamez came upon the scent, and followed it into the province of Quema.\r\nHe was even so fortunate as to capture the chief, but for want of an\r\ninterpreter nothing definite could be learned. He nevertheless reported\r\nfavorably to Espinosa, who ordered Albites and Hurtado to go to his\r\nassistance. Under the gentle persuasion of the rack Quema disclosed\r\nthe place where part of the gold, some thirty thousand castellanos,\r\nwas hidden, but denied any knowledge of the remainder. With this gold\r\nand other plunder, the three captains rejoined their commander, who had\r\npassed on to Guararí.\r\n\r\nTwo canoes being completed, each capable of carrying seventy men, and\r\nthree smaller ones having been brought by Pablo Mejía from Chirú, they\r\nwere placed in charge of Bartolomé Hurtado, who with eighty or ninety\r\nmen coasted south and westward, while Espinosa with the remainder of\r\nthe company followed by land. The rain fell in torrents, and the worthy\r\nlicentiate was soon tired of wading through the thick mud; and so, after\r\nfour days' march to a small port called Huera,[XI-11] in the province\r\nof Vera, a council was held which arranged that Hurtado should continue\r\nthe survey with one hundred men, in boats, while the land party should\r\nreturn to Quema and search for the remainder of the Badajoz treasure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first province at which Hurtado landed was called Guanata, whence\r\nthe inhabitants had fled, and where by reason of continuous rains\r\nthe Spaniards rested seven days. Securing guides they then passed on\r\nto an island, called by the natives Caubaco, or Cebaco,[XI-12] three\r\ndays distant. Hurtado was acquiring experience, and found it better to\r\ntreat these wild people gently. This policy succeeded, and, although\r\nhis landing was at first opposed, he and the islanders soon became the\r\nbest of friends. Their ruler was absent on the mainland, fighting; and\r\nwhen he returned his subjects introduced the strangers with such warmth\r\nthat he at once extended his good-will, giving Hurtado a golden armor\r\nvalued at one thousand castellanos. Indeed, he proved most affable\r\nand accommodating, willing to acknowledge the king of Spain, accept\r\nChristianity, or anything they desired; so much so that the Spaniards\r\ncalled him Cacique Amigo. An expedition was organized against the\r\ninhabitants of a neighboring island, named by the Spaniards Isla de\r\nVarones, in which they were joined by Pequeari, brother of Cebaco,\r\nwith nine canoes. These islanders were found entrenched in a log\r\nfortress, surrounded by a ditch, and so difficult to carry that the\r\nassailants were repeatedly thrown back and must have failed but for\r\ntheir artillery. Seven leagues to the westward was an island called\r\nCabo,[XI-13] where the Spaniards found a little gold. Thence they kept\r\nalong the mainland, but the inhabitants were so fierce they dared not\r\nland. Some boatmen told them, however, that through the lands of the\r\nadjoining provinces, Torra and Tabraba, the distance to the North Sea\r\nwas but three days' journey. And here they met with rumors of a rich and\r\npowerful nation to the westward, with double faces and rounded feet—an\r\nallusion probably to the table-land civilization. There are people with\r\nthe former characteristic even to-day, and among our superior European\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUTH SEA EXPLORATIONS.]\r\n\r\nHurtado explored the coast as far as the gulf of Nicoya,[XI-14]\r\nabout one hundred and forty leagues from Natá. In the vicinity of\r\nthe Golfo Dulce,[XI-15] the people were called Chiuchires. The beauty\r\nand fruitfulness of the country proved a constant temptation to the\r\nSpaniards to land and dispute possession with the owners, who appeared\r\nalong the shore with drum and trumpet to frighten the visitation. But\r\nsuch was not Hurtado's purpose, nor his ability; from Nicoya he returned\r\nto join Espinosa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter due deliberation it was determined at Antigua that the fishing\r\nstation of Panamá[XI-16] should be the site of the chief city, the\r\nterminal post of the transcontinental line on the shore of the South\r\nSea. And after the return of Hurtado, which was early in 1517, Espinosa\r\nproceeded, under present instructions from Pedrarias, to place an\r\nestablishment there. Its first commander was Hernan Ponce, who had just\r\nreturned with Hurtado from the Nicoya expedition.[XI-17]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOLD HUNTING.]\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Hurtado, Espinosa had proceeded to Quema in his\r\nsearch for Paris, and the gold that Badajoz had lost, but he was soon\r\nobliged to leave that province on account of the scarcity of provisions.\r\nTwo days' journey inland brought the Spaniards to a village governed by\r\na cacique called Chiracona, who was accused of having been instrumental\r\nin the defeat of Badajoz, and who now held in his possession two of the\r\nbaskets of gold. Into this province, famous for the bravery of its men\r\nand the beauty of its women, and also as being haunted by _tuyraes_, or\r\ndevils, Diego de Albites was sent forward with sixty men, the remainder\r\nof the company following at a slower march while feeding on reed roots.\r\n\"By God's will,\" says the pious licentiate, \"the cacique was captured\r\nwith his women and children.\" Chiracona at first denied the impeachment,\r\nbut when tortured he promised to produce the gold.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow really knew nothing of the treasure, but he saw that it\r\nwas necessary for him to confess something if he would live. And under\r\nthe pressure his wits quickened. According to tradition the rendezvous\r\nof devils was a mountain fastness, ten leagues distant, into which\r\nTartarean retreat no man had ever ventured. \"If,\" thought the sadly\r\nbattered Chiracona, \"these infernal Christians can be enticed thither,\r\nthere will be a happy end of them.\" But when he told them of the beauty\r\nand fertility of the place, and of the vast stores of wealth the ages\r\nhad garnered there, a woman of Escoria, whom the chaste licentiate\r\nregarded with tender favor, besought her master not to enter that\r\ndangerous recess, for she had heard say that Chiracona sought only the\r\ndestruction of the Spaniards, confident that the earth would open to\r\nswallow them. But the licentiate replied, \"Have no misgivings, amiga\r\nmia; Christians fear not devils; devils fear Christians, and fly before\r\nthem.\" And so Pedro de Gamez was sent with seventy men to the abode of\r\nthe devils. The night following there was a terrible earthquake: both\r\nheathen and Christian believed his hour had come; and as Chiracona rode\r\nin his house the oscillating earth, as in a canoe he rode the billowy\r\nocean, he smiled to think how well his plan was working.\r\n\r\nNext day Gamez returned without the gold; whereat both white men and red\r\nwere disappointed, the former because the treasure was not forthcoming,\r\nthe latter because the Spanish had returned unharmed, since this would\r\nbeside require Chiracona to invent some new pastime for their greedy\r\navarice. The Spaniards remained at this place two months, living on\r\nsupplies forced from Chiracona, and urging upon him Christianity,\r\nallegiance to Spain, and the delivery of the gold. Finding him obdurate\r\non all these points, they gave him to the dogs and went their way. Paris\r\nbeing heard of at Quema, Diego de Albites was sent thither, but was\r\nunsuccessful in the primary object of his mission. The 2d of January,\r\n1517, all passed into Escoria, whence Albites was despatched on a three\r\ndays' journey to the northward to capture a cacique named Tabraba.\r\nHe was successful, and secured gold to the value of four thousand\r\ncastellanos.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RETURN OF ESPINOSA TO ANTIGUA.]\r\n\r\nEspinosa now made ready for returning to the North Sea. It filled him\r\nwith indignation to witness the ingratitude of the few caciques whose\r\nlives he had spared. Natá apostatized, burned the Spaniards' palisades,\r\ndestroyed their growing grain, and joined a hostile confederacy.\r\nThe people of Chirú and elsewhere retired, thus adding insult to the\r\nfailure to supply articles for plunder. While passing through Tubanamá,\r\nEspinosa overthrew a chief named Chamna, who had been hostile to Vasco\r\nNuñez. In Comagre he found Serrano, sent again to scourge that almost\r\ndesolate province. Half famished the Spaniards arrived at Acla, and were\r\noverjoyed to find Vasco Nuñez, who gave them food and provided them a\r\nvessel in which to return to Antigua.\r\n\r\nThe alcalde mayor's were the mightiest stealings of them all. Herrera\r\nestimates the returns of gold at eighty thousand pesos, and two thousand\r\ncaptives for slaves. After giving the king his fifth, and the governor\r\nand officials each a liberal share, there was enough distributed among\r\nthe soldiers to make each esteem himself rich. Then followed days and\r\nnights of glorious debauch, in which, beside women and wine, gambling\r\nwas conspicuous. A second distribution of capital was speedily effected\r\nunder the auspices of the goddess unfathomable. It was paltry to\r\nbet less than a peso on any game, while a slave was a common wager.\r\nThe governor, his council, and the soldiers took jovial parts in the\r\nexercise, and it is said that Pedrarias at one sitting played away a\r\nhundred slaves. It was of great avail, indeed, with such servants and\r\nsubjects, for the king to forbid playing-cards to be sent to the New\r\nWorld, and for the Council of the Indies to restrict a twenty-four\r\nhours' loss at play to ten castellanos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF VASCO NUÑEZ DE BALBOA.\r\n\r\n1516-1517.\r\n\r\n     AFFAIRS AT ANTIGUA—DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF\r\n     PACIFICATION—COMPLAINTS OF VASCO NUÑEZ TO THE KING—A\r\n     NEW EXPEDITION PLANNED—VASCO NUÑEZ MADE ADELANTADO AND\r\n     CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF THE SOUTH SEA—PEDRARIAS KEEPS SECRET THE\r\n     APPOINTMENT—RECONCILIATION OF BALBOA AND PEDRARIAS—BETROTHAL\r\n     OF DOÑA MARÍA—VASCO NUÑEZ GOES TO ACLA—MASSACRE OF OLANO—THE\r\n     MUNICIPALITY OF ACLA ESTABLISHED—MATERIALS FOR SHIPS\r\n     CARRIED ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS—DIFFICULTIES, PERILS, AND\r\n     MORTALITY—BALBOA AT THE PEARL ISLANDS—PREDICTION OF MICER\r\n     CODRO, THE ASTROLOGER—RUMORED ARRIVAL OF A NEW GOVERNOR AT\r\n     ANTIGUA—MEDITATED EVASION OF NEW AUTHORITY—THE INFAMY OF\r\n     GARABITO—VASCO NUÑEZ SUMMONED BY PEDRARIAS TO ACLA—HIS JOURNEY\r\n     THITHER—TRIAL AND EXECUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring Espinosa's absence in the south, affairs at Antigua were\r\nexceptionally dull. The illness of the governor, unfortunately, was\r\nnot fatal. Business had approached its end, for the fighting men\r\nwere away, and the thrifty arts offered few attractions to piratical\r\nadventurers. So low was the colony at one time reduced that the Casa\r\nde la Fundicion, or melting-house, was closed and public fasts were\r\nappointed—a homœopathic policy, in truth, for a starving community. But\r\nfor the feud between Pedrarias and Vasco Nuñez, which in that infamous\r\nenvironment was easily kept alive, little would have occurred worthy of\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUARRELS WITH THE GOVERNOR.]\r\n\r\nIt should be no fault of the governor if the cavalier was not ruined.\r\nHis choicest schemes were marred by incompetent and evil-minded men.\r\nHe was vilified at court, and in the colony every indignity possible\r\nwas laid upon him. The observant reader must already have drawn a\r\ncontrast in the respective quality of enterprise pursued by these men.\r\nWhatever may have been the immediate results, whatever the wrongs and\r\ncruelties inflicted by either, in the one case there was the lofty aim\r\nof discovery and peaceful occupation; in the other, no higher object\r\nthan plunder was apparent. Balboa had not time for much gold-gathering;\r\nthe captains of Pedrarias had time for nothing else.\r\n\r\nExcepting the raid of the alcalde mayor, the expeditions planned by\r\nPedrarias were not remarkable for their success. Nor did Balboa scruple\r\nto rail at the old governor in consequence. \"All the enterprises of\r\nPedrarias met with such ill success,\" says Benzoni, \"that Balboa laughed\r\nat him and mocked him, whereat the governor became irate, and serious\r\ncontentions resulted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBalboa was now in the prime of manhood, approaching forty, and had\r\nduring the past few years developed from a careless rambler into\r\na thoughtful ruler, with a New World fame second only to its first\r\ndiscoverer. \"Behold,\" says Peter Martyr, \"this rash royster turned\r\ninto a politic captain, a violent Goliah transformed to Heliseus,\r\nand from Anteus to Hercules the conqueror of monsters.\" And of all\r\nmonsters he might encounter by sea or land, old man Pedrarias was the\r\nmost monstrous. It was exasperating beyond endurance to an ardent and\r\nchivalrous nature like Balboa's, thus to have his glories reaped and his\r\nenergies placed in circumscription by a superlatively selfish person of\r\nfar inferior natural abilities, made by mistake his political superior.\r\nAnd he never ceased to strike back with all the force at his command.\r\nBy every departure he appealed to the royal authorities in Spain, laying\r\nbefore them vivid accounts of outrages on the natives, perversion of the\r\nlaws, and gross mismanagement of the colony. \"Most powerful sovereign,\"\r\nhe wrote the king, \"I, a true and law-abiding servant, sensible of\r\nthe many obligations I am under to do loyal service for benefits\r\nbestowed—and may your Majesty live long to grant me more—humbly desire\r\nto undeceive your Majesty regarding the governor, Pedrarias Dávila, that\r\nyour Majesty may order such provisions as may be deemed best.\" He urged\r\nOviedo, when about to depart for Spain, to place before the Council of\r\nthe Indies the true condition of things. And again he writes, \"I beseech\r\nyour Majesty not to regard me as a calumniator, or as stating aught\r\nin malice, but that you will order an investigation, that you may know\r\nall I have said is true.\" He still entertained hopes that the report of\r\nArbolancha, accompanied by the presents, would be graciously received,\r\nand that his successes would atone for past irregularities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile awaiting the results of these endeavors, he determined to make an\r\nexpedition to the South Sea, without permission or aid from Pedrarias,\r\nand to extend his discoveries there in either direction. In pursuance\r\nof this purpose, and with the coöperation of the small remnant of\r\nthose who had sworn fealty on the heights of Quarequá, he secretly\r\ndespatched to Cuba for men and arms, a small vessel in charge of Andrés\r\nGarabito. Having thus set in motion the wheels of his fate, he awaited\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADELANTADO AND CAPTAIN-GENERAL.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how King Ferdinand received Arbolancha, how the royal heart\r\nwas touched by the discoveries and pearls of the generous cavalier. And\r\nwe must confess the monarch's dilemma. The establishing of Pedrarias'\r\ngovernment had cost him much money, and the very qualities which\r\nachieved desperate adventure tended to loosen the bonds of allegiance.\r\nBut Vasco Nuñez had manifested no disposition to throw off royal\r\nauthority; furthermore, it had become a principle of colonial economics,\r\nthat the services of successful commanders should be paid for out of\r\ntheir future gains. How then could any sovereign expect the extension\r\nof his dominions, if successful adventure was defrauded of its right?\r\nIt was therefore determined that the reward of Vasco Nuñez should be\r\nthe title of adelantado of the Southern Sea, and captain-general of\r\nthe provinces of Coiba and Panamá, but subject to the supervision of\r\nPedrarias as superior officer.\r\n\r\nThe royal despatches conferring this appointment reached Antigua early\r\nin 1515, prior to the departure of Espinosa. Pedrarias, of course,\r\nwas at the same time informed of the fact. His mortification was only\r\nexceeded by his dastardly resolve. Take from Castilla del Oro its\r\nsouthern seaboard and the government was not worth the having, even\r\nthough the jurisdiction of Antigua did extend nominally over the whole.\r\nThe north coast was already stripped, and the climate was such as no\r\nEuropean could long endure; while in the south wealth and dominion\r\nawaited romantic adventure. All despatches arriving at Antigua had\r\nto pass through the governor's hands. Those for Vasco Nuñez on this\r\noccasion were withheld.\r\n\r\nPedrarias well knew that some excuse would be necessary for his conduct;\r\nand he began to look about for one. It was unlawful in the provinces\r\nfor any governor or captain-general to exercise the functions of office\r\nwhile undergoing his residencia. New charges against the former governor\r\nof the colony must therefore be invented, and litigious persecution\r\nrenewed. By collusion with the judge this investigation, as the law then\r\nrequired, could be continued indefinitely. Still better, the alcalde\r\nmayor, who was the person most proper in this instance to take the\r\nresidencia, might be allured from his friendship for the discoverer by\r\nthe offer of a military command after proceedings had been instituted,\r\nfor it was well known that the licentiate's vanity was not less than\r\nhis cupidity.\r\n\r\nBelieving himself prepared, the governor summoned his council, revealed\r\nthe secret, and urged that the commission should be withheld. All agreed\r\nsave Bishop Quevedo, who had real friendship for Vasco Nuñez, and who\r\nsaw more honor for Spain and for the Church in the elevation of the\r\nfree-handed cavalier, than in the military raid of the alcalde mayor.\r\nAnd so seeing, he grew zealously virtuous, and began to storm about it.\r\nOutnumbered in the council, he mounted his pulpit and hurled invectives\r\nat his opponents. \"Can it be,\" he cried, \"that the execrable passions\r\nof envious and designing men may thus subvert the royal design, and\r\nwithhold the just reward of eminent service?\" Furthermore, he threatened\r\nto spread the bare facts before the authorities in Spain.\r\n\r\nPedrarias quailed. He had not anticipated the violent opposition of\r\nthe prelate, and he feared the rising strength of his adversary, now\r\nthat the royal favor and a royal commission were known to have been\r\ngranted him. Vasco Nuñez might have his office, but the old man swore\r\nit should be the death of him. For he would lay around him such snares\r\nand pitfalls as would surely prove his destruction in the end. Pedrarias\r\nwould be the power; and play upon this braggart as he would upon a pipe\r\nfor devils to dance by.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUEVEDO AS MEDIATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe public acknowledgment of dignities, attended by the congratulations\r\nof friends and the discussion of southern projects in which alone\r\ninterest now centred, raised in popularity and importance the new\r\ngovernor, to the overshadowing of the old one. But once more the\r\ndestiny of Vasco Nuñez is to turn on the bad advice of a friend. Thrown\r\nupon himself, his own sound judgment had ever been sufficient, but\r\nthe counsels of piety or erudition were as quicksand under his feet.\r\nQuevedo induced him, for the sake of peace and in order to enter without\r\ndelay upon his South Sea schemes, to waive in favor of Pedrarias some\r\nportion of the rights the king had granted him. Espinosa and others were\r\naccordingly permitted to overrun the southern provinces at pleasure.\r\nThis was a mistake.\r\n\r\nThus reconciled, in appearance at least, Pedrarias himself would fain\r\nhave had rest, if it had been permitted by his evil nature, which still\r\ndemanded its daily bitter pabulum.\r\n\r\nScarcely were these pacific fictions consummated when the vessel\r\nof Andrés Garabito returned from Cuba with men and supplies for the\r\nprojected expedition of Vasco Nuñez. Arriving off the coast of Darien\r\nGarabito despatched a messenger to Balboa, informing him of his\r\nreturn, and asking orders. It soon reached the ears of Pedrarias that\r\na suspicious-looking craft, armed and equipped as if on some illicit\r\nmission, lay hidden in a small bay some six leagues distant. He was\r\nfurthermore informed that the captain of this vessel was in secret\r\ncommunication with Vasco Nuñez, and that preparations were being made\r\nfor some mysterious undertaking. Pedrarias became both frightened and\r\nfurious. He called to mind the fate of Nicuesa. Alarm for his own safety\r\nwas mingled with ire and envious regrets for ever having yielded even\r\nin appearance to any recognition of this upstart's titles and honors.\r\nHe ordered the instant arrest of Balboa, and even threatened to confine\r\nhim for safe keeping in the large wooden cage stationed in the middle\r\nof the plaza.\r\n\r\nThe fears of Pedrarias were calmed, however, by the cooler heads; the\r\nnature and purpose of the intended expedition were explained; no lurking\r\ntreason was discovered, no plot against the peace of Antigua or sinister\r\ndesigns upon the person of its governor were found; and having bound\r\nhimself to new and more stringent restrictions, Vasco Nuñez was set at\r\nliberty, and the precarious friendship ostensibly renewed.[XII-1]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout this time the bishop of Darien was seized with a luminous idea.\r\nThrough his pertinacious devotedness the worthy prelate had twice\r\nrescued his friend from a life of independence and honor, and had twice\r\nconsigned him to the mercies of an insidious enemy. He had prevented\r\nPedrarias from sending him in chains to Spain, which would have sounded\r\nhis renown and enlisted for him sympathy throughout Christendom; he had\r\npersuaded him to relinquish his rights to such an extent as to place his\r\nfortune at the disposal of an inveterate foe. I do not say Quevedo was\r\nan Ahithophel; yet the machinations of all his enemies could not bring\r\nupon Vasco Nuñez the evils consummated by this one friend. Nevertheless,\r\nthe present conception happily brought forth, and malice and suspicion\r\nwill forever give place to confiding affection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALBOA'S BETROTHAL.]\r\n\r\nFour blooming daughters Pedrarias had left in Spain. The health of the\r\ngovernor seemed to be yielding before the combined influence of temper\r\nand climate. Who could be a more fitting successor in the government,\r\nand who a more suitable son-in-law? Let Balboa take to wife Doña María,\r\neldest daughter of Pedrarias, and so bind the North Sea to the South by\r\ncords of love. Such was the plan of the prelate. Vasco Nuñez, nothing\r\nloath, assented, for the daughter was as amiable as the father was\r\nmalicious. Doña Isabel was not the mother to look coldly on so gallant\r\na proposal; as for the daughter, then dreaming her maiden days away in\r\na convent at Seville, her own consent to the betrothal was a question\r\nwhich gave parents little concern in those days; the chief difficulty\r\nwas the splenetic father. Approaching the governor, not without\r\nmisgivings, Quevedo said: \"Time passes, Señor Pedrarias, and with time,\r\nall flesh. Those who shall take our places follow close at our heels.\r\nA powerful rival converted into a firm ally is double compensation, and\r\nthe father of four daughters has not the opportunity every day to refuse\r\na governor for a son-in-law. Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, a man of no mean\r\nparts, well-born and famous, asks your daughter in marriage. Grant him\r\nhis desire, and so heal discord and fortify your declining years.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the obvious advantages, Pedrarias hesitated. It was no\r\neasy matter at once to purify the poisoned stream of thought. But the\r\noffer was too tempting to be declined, although Pedrarias would have\r\nmuch preferred for his adviser a Thrasybulus, who counselled Periander\r\nto cut off the tallest heads if he would maintain his power. The old\r\nman, still hugging his suspicions, signed the marriage contract, and\r\nordered fair Doña María to appear and accept marital honors. But even\r\nthe gift of the daughter was like the gifts of Medea—envenomed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow surely might Vasco Nuñez walk the firm earth, his fortune ascendant.\r\nAdelantado, captain-general of the Southern Sea, son-in-law of\r\nPedrarias, and in favor with the royal authorities, though Ferdinand,\r\npoor king, was dead. The clouds which had so long obscured Balboa's\r\nrising fame were by this masterly invocation of the bishop forever\r\ndissipated. There was no longer any fear from the unclean ghosts of\r\nentombed mistakes, while his good deeds would shine with steadier\r\nand ever-increasing lustre. He might now prosecute adventure to the\r\nuttermost of his ambition, while his friend and counsellor, the bishop,\r\ncarried the happy tidings of reconciliation to court.[XII-2]\r\n\r\nThe year 1516 was advancing toward its middle term. Vasco Nuñez craved\r\npermission from his father-in-law—for betrothal was equivalent to\r\nmarriage so far as the political aspect of the case was concerned—to\r\nproceed to Acla and continue the business there begun, which was\r\nindeed none other than part of his original scheme. Pedrarias assented,\r\nplacing every requisite at the command of his dear son. The South Sea\r\nexpeditions had drained the colony of most of its available men, yet so\r\nesteemed was Vasco Nuñez that all who were at Antigua eagerly flocked\r\nto his standard. Fernando de Argüello, a notary, formerly the opponent\r\nof Nicuesa, but always a partisan of Vasco Nuñez, having accumulated\r\nwealth placed it at the disposal of his friend, and soon after Balboa\r\nembarked with eighty men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUTH SEA EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nArrived at Acla he found the post destroyed and the comandante Olano,\r\nthe successor of Gabriel de Rojas, together with twelve soldiers,\r\nhad been massacred by the men of Careta, in retaliation for the act\r\nof Hurtado which consigned one hundred of their number to slavery.\r\nFor this outrage the people of the province were declared outlaws.\r\nBalboa immediately organized a municipality, appointed an alcalde\r\nand a regidor, laid out a new town, and began to build. Each citizen,\r\neither in person or by slaves, was required to plant sufficient for\r\nhis sustenance. Requiring more men, Balboa accompanied Espinosa to\r\nAntigua, early in 1517, and returned with two hundred recruits. The\r\nrestoration of Acla was intended only as preliminary to further South\r\nSea discoveries; but this accomplished, an obstacle interposed itself,\r\nat first glance insurmountable. In order to navigate the new ocean\r\nships were necessary. The short voyages hitherto undertaken in native\r\ncanoes had been perilous in the extreme. Herein lay the difficulty. The\r\ncordillera here rises abruptly from the northern side of the Isthmus,\r\nundulating gently on the opposite side toward the Southern Sea. On the\r\nnorthern slope grew trees suitable for ship-building; on the southern\r\nside vegetation was more diminutive. But of what avail were trees on\r\nthe border of one ocean, for the purposes of navigation on the other?\r\n\r\nThe true standard of greatness is in the application of means to ends.\r\nThe magnitude of the means has no more to do with it than the results,\r\nwhich may or may not prove successful. With a few hundred Spaniards,\r\nand such savages as could be whipped into the service, Vasco Nuñez\r\ndared conceive and execute the project of building ships on one side\r\nof a chain of mountains for use on the other side; to navigate his\r\nvessels in pieces or sections, on the backs of Indians, over hills and\r\nswamps, and that under a sun so hot, in an atmosphere so poisoned, and\r\nthrough vegetation so rank and tangled as successfully to have defied\r\nthe efforts of science for centuries thereafter. \"No living man in all\r\nthe Indies,\" testifies the moderate Herrera, \"dared attempt such an\r\nenterprise, or would have succeeded in it, save Vasco Nuñez de Balboa.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of Vasco Nuñez was to prepare his timber as near as possible\r\nto some navigable point on one of the many streams flowing into the\r\nSouth Sea, which are generally torrents on the mountain-side, but which\r\nbecome broad and calm before reaching the ocean. The stream chosen for\r\nthe purpose was called the Rio de las Balsas,[XII-3] or River of the\r\nRafts. Carpenters and builders are sent out in search of trees suitable\r\nfor the purpose, and the preparation of the timber is begun. With fifty\r\nmen Francisco Compañon passes over the cordillera and selects a place\r\nupon the river, twenty-two leagues from Acla, from which to launch the\r\nships. Likewise on the summit of the sierra, twelve leagues from Acla,\r\nhe builds a fort, to serve as a half-way house for rest and protection,\r\nbeside stations established at other points. All is bustle and activity\r\nat Acla and in the neighboring forests; some are felling trees, some\r\nmeasuring and hewing timber; some preparing anchors, rigging, and\r\nstores. \"In all labors,\" says Las Casas, \"Vasco Nuñez took the foremost\r\npart, working with his own hands and giving aid and encouragement\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CARRIES SHIPS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nMaterials for four brigantines being at length prepared, the herculean\r\ntask of transportation across the mountains is next to be performed.\r\nThirty negroes have been secured from Antigua, but these are not a tenth\r\npart of the force required. Squads of soldiers are therefore sent out\r\nin every direction, and natives are driven in to the number of several\r\nthousand. Upon their naked backs the heavy timbers are laid, and goaded\r\nforward by merciless overseers, among whom is the black African as\r\nwell as the white European, they are forced through the marshy thicket\r\nand up the rocky steep until they sink exhausted beneath their burden.\r\nUnused to labor, ill-fed, made desperate by their distress, some\r\nattempt escape, but the bloodhound is quickly on their track; some kill\r\nthemselves, but more sink lifeless under their heavy loads. All along\r\nthose terrible leagues the newly cut path is strewed with dead savages,\r\nand soon the air is rank from putrid carcasses. \"More than five hundred\r\nIndians perished in the transportation of these ships,\" affirmed Bishop\r\nQuevedo before the court of Spain, and Las Casas says the deaths were\r\nnearer two thousand in number.[XII-4] To take the places of the dead,\r\nrecruits are caught in the forest; the work goes bravely on, and the\r\nstupendous feat is finally accomplished. The wild bank of the Balsas\r\nwas strewed with materials for this new sea navigation. But on putting\r\nthe pieces together it is found that after all the toil there is timber\r\nenough for only two vessels instead of four; the rest has been lost by\r\nthe way. And this is not the worst of it. That which has been brought\r\nover at such cruel cost, cut near the coast and hewed green as it was,\r\nis so full of worms that it cannot be used. All must be thrown away and\r\nthe work begun anew.[XII-5]\r\n\r\nTimber is sought nearer at hand this time, and with fair success. Vasco\r\nNuñez now divides his force into three parties, and sends one to hew\r\ntimber, one to bring supplies from Acla, and a third to forage on the\r\nnatives. Again they are ready with new materials to begin construction,\r\nwhen the heavens suddenly darken and drop such a deluge on them that\r\nthey are obliged to take refuge in trees. Part of the timber is swept\r\naway, and part buried in mud. To add to their misfortunes, foraging\r\nfails; hunger pinches; and \"when Vasco Nuñez himself was forced to feed\r\non roots,\" says Las Casas, always with an eye to his protégés, \"it may\r\nwell be imagined to what extremity six hundred Indian captives were\r\nreduced.\"\r\n\r\nIt now looks very dark to Vasco Nuñez, and he begins to consider if it\r\nwere not better to move on, one way or the other, than to die there. But\r\nthese misgivings are only for a moment. No, it is not better. Throwing\r\na bridge of floating withe-tied logs across the river he sends over\r\nCompañon with a strong company, and tells him never to return except\r\nwith food. Hurtado he despatches to Antigua for more men, and goes\r\nhimself to Acla for necessary effects. In all which he is successful;\r\nand he is successful finally in floating two brigantines upon the\r\nBalsas. There is no such thing as failure this side of death.\r\n\r\nWhat a bright vision it is that greets him as he drops down into the\r\nsea, his own sea that he had found and well-nigh lost again! Heaven is\r\nindeed beautiful if it be anything fairer. Silver and gold and pearl are\r\nthe sunshine, land, and sky; while the sea, the murmuring, gladdening,\r\nmajestic sea; it would inspire a brute with nobility, one sight of it!\r\n\r\nDreams and realities! Wild as had been the dreams of these ignorant and\r\nvoracious men, dreams with their Indies and Araby isles, they fell far\r\nshort of reality. How could they dream of a Montezuma empire waiting\r\nexpectantly to welcome the destroyer, or of an Inca faction so evenly\r\nbalanced that so light a hell-flake as a Pizarro might turn it?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AT THE PEARL ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nSelecting Isla Rica, the largest of the Pearl Islands, as a rendezvous\r\nand place of settlement, Balboa discharged his vessels there and sent\r\nthem back to bring from the Balsas the remainder of the company,\r\ntogether with materials for two more ships, which were in due time\r\ncompleted, making four in all. More supplies were brought from Acla, and\r\njourneys between the two seas were from this time frequent. Meanwhile,\r\nafter pacifying the Pearl Islands, he embarked with one hundred men for\r\na cruise eastward. After sailing twenty leagues a shoal of whales so\r\nfrightened the sailors that they anchored for the night near the shore,\r\nand embraced the opportunity to kill a village of Indians for having put\r\nto death Bernardo Morales and his men in a former expedition. The wind\r\nbeing contrary the fleet next morning returned to the Pearl Islands.\r\n\r\nThus haply launched upon the tide of glorious adventure, with full\r\nfreedom in the south, and in harmony with superior powers, what could\r\nfortune offer more satisfactory or secure? But fickle the goddess,\r\nand malignant the while, keeping alive suspicion and envy where only\r\nhonor and good-will should be. It happened about this time that as\r\none of Balboa's captains was setting out on his return to the South\r\nSea, rumor reached Acla that Lope de Sosa, a native of Córdova, then\r\nacting governor of the Canary Islands, had been appointed to supersede\r\nPedrarias. At one time such a prospect would have been hailed with\r\ndelight by Vasco Nuñez, but now that his fortunes were so happily linked\r\nwith those of his ancient enemy he could desire no change.\r\n\r\nOne evening while in friendly conversation with the vicar, Rodrigo\r\nPerez, and the notary, Valderrábano—for on these Pearl Islands now were\r\nall the paraphernalia of spiritual and temporal rulership—upon the\r\nprobable effect of a change of governors on South Sea affairs Vasco\r\nNuñez remarked, \"It may be possible that Lope de Sosa has ere this\r\nreceived his commission, and that even now he is at Antigua, in which\r\ncase my lord Pedrarias is no longer governor, and all our toilsome\r\nundertakings will profit us nothing. In order therefore to know best\r\nhow to proceed in this emergency I am of opinion that it would be well\r\nto send some faithful messenger to Acla for our further necessities;\r\nand if the new governor has come, we will furnish our ships, and pursue\r\nour enterprise as best we can, trusting to his future approval. But if\r\nmy lord Pedrarias is still in power, he will allay our fears, and we\r\nwill then set out upon our voyage, which I trust in God will succeed\r\naccording to our wishes.\" I beg the reader to remember these words, and\r\nsay if in them is hidden the venom of treason to the father-governor\r\nwhen morbid acrimony decides them criminal. I do not say that at\r\nthis juncture Vasco Nuñez would not have disregarded any whimsical\r\nmalevolence on the part of his future father-in-law which might stand in\r\nthe way of his high purposes. I think he would have done so. But that\r\nhe saw no necessity for so doing, and never dreamed of disobedience or\r\ndisloyalty, I am very sure.\r\n\r\nAs his ill-fate would have it, just when Vasco Nuñez was concluding his\r\nremarks on this subject, a sentinel on guard in front of the general's\r\nquarters stepped up under the awning to shelter himself from a passing\r\nshower. This fellow, whose sense of smell was so acute that he could\r\ndetect disloyalty though hidden in a barrel of salt, found here at once\r\na mare's nest. Of course his general was talking treason; he had often\r\nbeen suspected, and now he openly admitted that if affairs planned in\r\nSpain or at Antigua did not suit him, he would sail away and leave all\r\nemperors and governors in the lurch. And if he alone might have the\r\ndisclosing of this villainy his fortune was made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICER CODRO, THE ASTROLOGER.]\r\n\r\nA story is told of one Micer Codro, a Venetian astrologer, who\r\nfollowed his stars to the Indies and there interpreted nature for\r\na consideration. For up and down the world the devil used to lead\r\nhim with the faintest thread of comet-light. While at the height of\r\nhis power in Darien, the horoscope of Vasco Nuñez was cast by this\r\nphilosopher, and his fate foretold with all the precision characterizing\r\nthe profession. Directing the attention of his auditor to a particular\r\nstar he said: \"When you behold that star at yonder point, know that\r\nyour fate approaches; your fortune then will be in jeopardy, and your\r\nlife in peril. But if you escape that danger, wealth and renown such\r\nas have fallen to the lot of no captain in all the Indies will be\r\nyours.\" Amidst the bustling activities of life Vasco Nuñez had well-nigh\r\nforgotten the words of the soothsayer. But while waiting the progress\r\nof his plans at the Pearl Islands, he chanced to take a stroll upon\r\nthe beach one night in company with his friends. The air was clear of\r\nmoisture, and the heavens ablaze with stars which seemed by their own\r\nlight multiplied. Nor was this gorgeous firmament more glorious than the\r\nhopes which then thrilled the breast of the cavalier. While in careless\r\nconversation his eye was suddenly arrested by the star of his destiny\r\nwhich hung portentous in the exact spot designated by Micer Codro. The\r\nprediction of the astrologer at once flashed upon him. \"But surely,\"\r\nhe thought, \"the worthy fellow read carelessly, or else possesses\r\nlittle knowledge of his art, for my time of peril has passed. I will,\r\nhowever, accept the saving clause of his prediction, and now achieve\r\nthe fame and wealth whereof he spake.\" Then with a smile he turned to\r\nhis companions. \"Have a care of soothsayers,\" he said gayly. \"You all\r\nknow Micer Codro. According to his prediction I stand this moment on\r\nthe verge of demolition. But I defy thee, fate! See there those ships,\r\nand this wealth-bordered sea; see here this good right arm, this stout\r\nheart, and you, my friends, three hundred faithful men. Does this look\r\nlike collapse?\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rumor of a new governor at Antigua, this South Sea\r\nenterprise ought to be prosecuted at all hazard. By authority both of\r\nthe king and of his representative in Darien the expedition had been\r\nundertaken. Money had been spent and infinite toil; life had been\r\nadventured—the lives of Spaniards, that is to say, for a thousand or\r\ntwo dead savages were scarcely to be regarded in the account. And now\r\nit behooved them to give no new king or new governor the opportunity of\r\nruining their hopes by countermanding the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was finally arranged that Andrés Garabito, Luis Botello, Andrés\r\nde Valderrábano, and Fernando Muñoz should proceed to Acla, and as\r\nthey drew near the town the party should halt; one of them should\r\nenter at night alone, and, proceeding to the house of Vasco Nuñez,\r\nshould ascertain from the servant to be found there if Pedrarias was\r\nsuperseded; and if the new governor had arrived the party would withdraw\r\nunobserved, return to the South Sea, and proclaim Vasco Nuñez governor\r\nof Tierra Firme, at the same time giving him a paper purporting to be\r\nhis commission. Thus would his command be deceived into the belief that\r\nhe was legal ruler, and so follow his bidding without question. This\r\nwas a glance toward treason; it was as bad as treason; but neither now\r\nnor ever was it treason. The projected stratagem was dangerous, and\r\nwholly useless, and most unfortunate, as the result proved; complicating\r\naffairs and aiding his enemies in casting over him that cloud of\r\nsuspicion which ultimately involved him in ruin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREACHEROUS MESSENGERS.]\r\n\r\nLikewise the agents for this errand were unhappily chosen. Garabito\r\nwas the deadly enemy of Balboa, though the latter did not know it.\r\nWorse than that, far more dastardly and damnable than enemy, he was\r\na treacherous friend. Balboa had often shown him favors, and placed\r\nimplicit confidence in him, as the prominence given him in this delicate\r\nmission plainly indicated. Within a friendly, even fawning exterior,\r\nlurked deadly hate. It originated thus: While Vasco Nuñez was yet\r\nunder the cloud of the governor's displeasure, Garabito had attempted\r\nimproper intimacy with Careta's daughter, Balboa's wife after the Indian\r\nfashion. One word from her protector, one glance from his eye—for the\r\nmiscreant saw perdition in it—was sufficient to check his presumption;\r\nbut Garabito never forgot it, and awaited only his revenge. While on\r\nthe Balsas he had even written Pedrarias that it was Balboa's purpose,\r\non reaching the ocean, to throw off allegiance to him, and to every one\r\nbut the king. He further affirmed that Vasco Nuñez cared nothing for\r\nhis daughter, loved only the Indian girl, and never intended to ratify\r\nhis betrothal obligation. Though Garabito knew well enough he deserved\r\nhanging for this, and might even achieve that infamy, yet he understood\r\nboth himself and Pedrarias, and he knew these lies would fatten on the\r\nold man's soul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GARABITO'S INFAMY.]\r\n\r\nWhen Garabito arrived at Acla, instead of doing as he had been told,\r\nhe set about to perform a little drama which should at once precipitate\r\nrevenge and free him from the odium of traitorous friendship. Mingling\r\nwith the gossips of the town, he talked mysteriously about South Sea\r\naffairs, threw out insinuations, and dropped dark hints concerning Vasco\r\nNuñez and the government. By such means he succeeded in causing himself\r\nto be arrested; and when brought before the magistrate for examination,\r\nno torture was required to draw from him all he knew, and more. An\r\nabstract of the evidence taken in this investigation, together with the\r\nletters and papers of Garabito, was forwarded to Pedrarias.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Vasco Nuñez embarked from Antigua on this enterprise, it was\r\nstipulated that he should return at the expiration of eighteen months.\r\nThe time having expired, he wrote Pedrarias requesting its extension,\r\ngiving as a reason for requiring it the extraordinary difficulties under\r\nwhich he had labored, and the attendant delays. He requested Fernando de\r\nArgüello, who had a large pecuniary interest at stake, to gain further\r\ntime, if possible, as otherwise their expenditure and toil would all be\r\nlost. In answer to the application of Argüello, Pedrarias said little;\r\nbut within the caldron the black stuff simmered.\r\n\r\nThis inopportune revival of the ancient feud between the governors\r\nexcited no small stir at Antigua. And when tidings of Garabito's arrest\r\nwere received, and the character of his testimony was made known, the\r\nfriends of Vasco Nuñez entertained fears for his safety. It made little\r\ndifference whether what this villain had said was true or false—though\r\nno one believed that Vasco Nuñez contemplated anything criminal—old\r\nman Pedrarias with his malignity aroused was a fiend incarnate.\r\nArgüello wrote Balboa that the governor would neither grant nor deny\r\nan extension of time, and the notary advised him to put to sea at once,\r\nand place himself beyond the rancorous caprice of Pedrarias. He further\r\ninformed him that in the event of a rupture he could appeal to the\r\nJeronimite Fathers, at Santo Domingo, who would see justice done him.\r\nUnfortunately, this letter was intercepted and sent to Pedrarias.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conflagration which sweeps a city is often kindled by a spark.\r\nThe South Sea discoverer entertained a harmless ruse, justifiable,\r\nin his opinion, as tending to settle the minds of his men and ensure\r\ntheir more perfect obedience in hazardous enterprise; he harbored\r\nat the most the intention of placing himself for no unlawful purpose\r\nbeyond the call of the new governor until he had consummated his long\r\ncherished schemes, and not of deceiving the old governor, to whom, if\r\nstill in power, his messengers were to disclose all his fears, in the\r\nbelief that his necessities would certainly be relieved. These trivial\r\nthoughts, flung distorted by Garabito into the inflammable breast of\r\nPedrarias, were more than sufficient to light a flame beyond the power\r\nof man to extinguish. On former occasions the enmity had been rather of\r\na political than a personal nature; now it enters the private chambers\r\nof the affections, and beside crimes plotted against the ruler, the\r\nfather is to be wounded and insulted. And his hate becomes unto death,\r\nmurderous.\r\n\r\nWith the several pretended disclosures of Garabito before him, his mind\r\nran quickly back over the career of Vasco Nuñez, his ill treatment of\r\nEnciso, his expulsion of Nicuesa, his irregularities while in office,\r\nthe king's order to call him to a reckoning, the brilliant discoveries\r\nintervening, the failure to convict him of crimes, the king's favor,\r\nand at last the nearer and to be hoped final reconciliation. Warmer yet\r\nwithin him glowed the thought of these things, as his mind dwelt upon\r\nthe letters disparaging to himself which Vasco Nuñez had sent the king,\r\nand recalled once more what Garabito had said concerning the repudiation\r\nof both himself and his daughter. He talked with Bachiller Corral, who\r\nhad been once arrested by Vasco Nuñez for improper conduct, and to the\r\nroyal treasurer, Alonso de la Puente, whom Vasco Nuñez had once offended\r\nby demanding the payment of a debt, he read the letter of Fernando de\r\nArgüello, and then ordered the arrest of the writer.\r\n\r\nHe communed with his heart in his rage and was glad. And he wrote his\r\nson-in-law a letter, his dear son-in-law, a friendly, fatherly letter,\r\nrequesting his presence at Acla for the purpose of consultation over\r\naffairs affecting their mutual interests. This letter was despatched by\r\nmessengers urged to the greatest haste, that the friends of Vasco Nuñez\r\nmight not have time to warn him of his danger. \"Once within my grasp,\"\r\nmuttered the old man, \"he never shall escape me.\" That he might not\r\nembark on some lengthy voyage or otherwise delay his coming, Pedrarias\r\nordered Francisco Pizarro to place himself at the head of as large a\r\nforce as he could muster, and immediately to find and arrest his former\r\ncomrade and commander, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, and bring him under safe\r\nguard to Acla.\r\n\r\nNow the dissembling letter of Pedrarias, so the chroniclers tell us,\r\nwas placed in the hands of Vasco Nuñez while yet the star of his destiny\r\nhovered, impatient of flight, about the spot whereon it was to determine\r\nhis fate; which proves to any reasonable mind, beyond peradventure,\r\nseveral things; _item_, that the heavenly lights are fingered by\r\nOmnipotence for individual import; _item_, that Micer Codro knows the\r\nstars; _item_, that the stars know Micer Codro; _item, parva momenta in\r\nspem metumque impellere animos_.\r\n\r\nConscious of no wrong, Vasco Nuñez suspected no treachery, and on\r\nreceipt of the letter he set out at once with the returning messengers\r\nto grant his father-in-law the desired interview, leaving his command\r\nat the Pearl Islands in charge of Francisco Compañon. As they journeyed\r\ntoward Acla he interrogated his companions concerning the affairs of\r\nthe colony. At first they were cautious in their replies, and made\r\nevasive answers; but the prompt and cordial manner in which Vasco\r\nNuñez responded to the summons of Pedrarias carried conviction of his\r\nintegrity. Further than this, they had long known Vasco Nuñez as a\r\ngallant cavalier and a genial friend, and they resolved, come what\r\nmight, he should not fall into the clutches of his enemy without a\r\nword of warning from them. Enjoining secrecy, they told him all; that\r\ncurrent opinion considered not only his liberty but that his life was\r\nin jeopardy.\r\n\r\nBalboa would not believe it. Pedrarias might be very angry, though he\r\nhad written in so friendly a strain; it was his nature to be suspicious\r\nand treacherous; he could not help it; he was martyr to a hate wherein\r\nhe was created, and not unlike that of Acrisius who quarrelled with\r\nhis twin brother Proetus before they were born. There might be some\r\ndifficulty in pacifying Pedrarias, but as for fearing him, the idea was\r\npreposterous. Even though he had meditated treason against the governor,\r\nwhich he had not, he was not guilty of any criminal act; and surely a\r\nman cannot be hanged for his meditations. Of course he would go forward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ARREST.]\r\n\r\nAs he descended the mountains and drew near Acla, Vasco Nuñez was met\r\nby the force sent out by the governor. As the leader advanced to make\r\nthe arrest, his old friend and patron cast on him a reproachful look and\r\nexclaimed, \"How is this, Francisco Pizarro? You were not wont to come\r\nout in this manner to receive me!\" He offered no opposition, however,\r\nand made no remonstrance when the irons were put upon him and he was\r\nled away to prison at Acla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHistory presents few sadder pictures than the closing scenes in the\r\ncareer of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa. And as we look at it, our sorrow waxes\r\nhot with indignation over the triumph of wrong. Occasionally, in the\r\nhostile encounters of men, justice seems to abandon the arena, leaving\r\niniquity master of the field; at which times the spectator burns for\r\nthe power which Omnipotence declines to exercise.\r\n\r\nThe game here played was for a valuable life. On one side was a\r\nsingularly morbid hate, envenomed and pitiless, united with unscrupulous\r\ntreachery and hypocrisy, which in an old man of ability, breeding,\r\nand position, was hideous beyond expression. On the other side were\r\nrecognized talents of so exceptional an order as to make the possessor\r\nthe most popular man in the colony. This is what kept his irascible\r\nadversary on nettles. Vasco Nuñez was the hero of this conquest. He was\r\nto Pedrarias as Loki to Baldur, or as Hyperion to a satyr; and in their\r\nstrangely assorted friendship they were more unequally yoked than in\r\ntheir enmity they were divided. He was the mirror in which by comparison\r\nthe governor most clearly saw his own infirmities. Like Othello he was\r\nof that free and open nature which thinks men honest that but seem so.\r\nHis faults were those of the times rather than of the man. He was as\r\nambitious as Achilles, but it was a laudable ambition as times went. He\r\nwas neither voracious nor avaricious; cruel he unquestionably was, but\r\nnot wantonly so; he gathered gold, but he scattered it open-handedly.\r\nHe coveted fame; and in those days neither equity nor humanity were\r\nessential to greatness. I do not regard him as greedy of office; he\r\nloved power, but he loved adventure more. Of course, in principle,\r\nthe robber life he led was wrong, though sanctioned by philosophers\r\nand divines, and Vasco Nuñez aspired to belong to neither class. He\r\nwas an illiterate cavalier, honest and religious, ready to accept\r\nthe theories of the day if they did not too greatly interfere with\r\nhis desires. Neither his loyalty nor his religion was sufficient to\r\nbe of great injury to him; although, if we may credit Peter Martyr,\r\nhe never attempted any adventure without the invocation of the deity\r\nand all the saints. Among his comrades he had ever at command a light\r\nartillery of wit; in logical argument he was not equal to his archenemy,\r\nbut in action he was the inferior of no man. A natural and perfect\r\nleader, he was out of place as second. Conception and execution were\r\none with him; he could not be bound by another's ideas. Latent in him\r\nwere inexhaustible resources, known to exist, even by himself, only as\r\noccasion required them. Only with emotions of pride might any Spaniard\r\nregard his frank intrepidity, chivalrous bearing, and affable, generous\r\ndisposition. In cruelty, subtlety, and base cunning Pedrarias was his\r\nsuperior, but not in war, or statesmanship, not to mention honorable\r\nenterprise. Throughout his entire career, whatever Vasco Nuñez touched\r\nby himself was a success; there was no chance about it, but simply\r\nenergy and ability, temperate courage and common sense. His final\r\noverthrow was accomplished not by fair and open opposition, but by\r\nmeans most foul and damnable. Some might say that in this contemplated\r\nassumption of authority he was, like Icarus, flying too near the sun;\r\nyet, in truth, it was no sun, but fires infernal that melted the wax\r\nof his wings. His trial, to which let us now pass, was a judicial\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HYPOCRISY AND CUNNING.]\r\n\r\nOld man Pedrarias could scarcely conceal his exultation in thus having,\r\nas he imagined, outwitted his prisoner. He could with difficulty refrain\r\nfrom feasting his eyes upon him; nay, he would not, and arraying his\r\nfeatures in fatherly concern, he repaired to the prison. Gently he\r\naccosted Balboa, assuring him that he had been forced to this step\r\nagainst his will, that the treasurer, Puente, was the accuser, and\r\nthat he, the governor, was in duty bound to investigate all charges,\r\nparticularly accusations made by a royal officer. \"But be not cast down,\r\nmy son,\" said the venerable hypocrite, \"neither give way to fear; for\r\nthe more clearly your actions are brought to light, the brighter will\r\nshine your eminent and loyal services.\"\r\n\r\nGoing his way, Pedrarias threw himself with all his strength into\r\nthe prosecution, or rather, I should say, persecution. The laws of\r\nSpain, transported to the colonies and administered by passionate and\r\nunprincipled men, were capable of almost any construction desired, and\r\nhence were as often used to cloak villainy as to punish crime. The law\r\nwas ever on the side of him who possessed the power to enforce it. All\r\nthe accusations of former trials were in this instance brought together,\r\nand old charges, long since obliterated by royal forgiveness, were\r\nrenewed. To the oft-told tales of Enciso's imprisonment and Nicuesa's\r\ndeath, were added misdeeds conjectured or invented by the listening\r\nsentinel, Garabito, and the rest. Arguello's letter was offered in\r\nevidence, and all his enemies had their fling at him. The licentiate,\r\nEspinosa, before whom the case was brought, was now a firm adherent\r\nof the governor. He had been paid his price in the South Sea command,\r\nand the downfall of Balboa would open for him further empire in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAll is going well; Pedrarias is content. The prisoner's chains are\r\ndoubled. A little torture now applied might be pleasing in effect.\r\nDropping the mask, Pedrarias enters the prison. \"So, villain! you\r\nthought to escape me,\" he cried. \"Your governor has become your tool,\r\nyour plaything; his daughter an idle jest, jilted for a savage strumpet.\r\nThank God! your days are numbered.\"\r\n\r\nBalboa at first made no reply, did not even manifest surprise. He had\r\nseen, soon after the trial began, that his judges thirsted for his\r\nblood, and that he was foredoomed. Finally he spake. \"I am here at your\r\nbidding. Since last we pledged friendship I have toiled faithfully in\r\nyour behalf, and mine. I have suffered many hardships, and have overcome\r\nobstacles deemed insurmountable by most men. Never for a moment have I\r\nentertained one thought disloyal to my betrothed or you. For the truth\r\nof this I refer you to my actions, and call God to witness. If I am\r\nguilty, as you say, why am I here? Think you, with four good ships and\r\nthree hundred devoted men at my command, with fortune beckoning me from\r\nevery direction, that had I harbored treason I would not have spread my\r\nsails and sought a land unknown, beyond all fear of capture? You know,\r\nmy lord Pedrarias, that I am innocent.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SENTENCE.]\r\n\r\nIt was patent to all that Vasco Nuñez was to be sacrificed to the\r\ninsatiable hate of the hoary-headed governor. Even Espinosa was becoming\r\ntired of it, and would have discharged the accused, had it not been\r\nfor Pedrarias and Puente, who insisted on what they called a verdict\r\nin accordance with the law and evidence. Under such pressure Espinosa\r\nwas forced to adjudge the prisoner guilty. The penalty was death.\r\nVasco Nuñez claimed the right of appeal to the Council of the Indies,\r\nwhich was denied him; to the Jeronimite Fathers, which was also denied.\r\nEspinosa became alarmed; he shrank from having on his soul the blood\r\nof this man, so gallant a cavalier, so eminent a discoverer; he never\r\nreally desired more than to drive him into obscurity, and he begged\r\nthe governor that the petition for appeal might be granted. \"No,\" said\r\nPedrarias, \"if he has sinned, let him suffer.\"\r\n\r\nWith horror the colonists heard that Vasco Nuñez was condemned to\r\nbe beheaded. Four of his friends were to suffer with him, Andrés de\r\nValderrábano, Luis Botello, Fernando Muñoz, and Fernando de Argüello.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a dismal day at Acla, the chroniclers tell us, that on which\r\nfive brave men were doomed to die, not for any crime, but as victims\r\nof a ferocious, savage-hearted old man. At an early hour the dull\r\nstrokes of the carpenter's hammer were heard in the plaza where the\r\nscaffold rose. Troops of men gathered on the streets and talked of the\r\ncoming execution, wondering if there would be an attempt at rescue. But\r\nPedrarias had taken care of that. Were the heavenly powers a-dreaming\r\nthat they should without interference permit this horrible crime? Alas!\r\nthese very men had just as iniquitously slain their innocent thousands.\r\nWhy should we pity them? And the same oft-invoked Omnipotence had\r\npermitted the ghastly work to be done in his name. Of what avail is it\r\nto wonder?\r\n\r\nHeavily chained, and surrounded by a strong guard, the men were brought\r\nforth. First came Vasco Nuñez. His step and bearing were not those of\r\na malefactor. Fire flashed from his eye and indignation flushed his\r\ncheek as he beheld the preparations for his ignominy. But this renowned\r\nand honored chieftain, even while marching to the scaffold, was less\r\nto be pitied than Pedrarias, who from behind a screened window was\r\nthis moment feasting his eyes upon the victim. Before the prisoner\r\nwalked the town-crier, who, as he approached the middle of the square,\r\nexclaimed in a loud voice, \"Behold the usurper, a man recreant to\r\nhis trust, and disloyal to his king. Let death be ever the doom of\r\ntraitors.\" \"'Tis false!\" cried Vasco Nuñez. \"Never have I been disloyal\r\nor untrue. To infamous treachery and wrong I yield my life, and not to\r\njustice.\"[XII-6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EXECUTION.]\r\n\r\nThe sacrament having been previously administered, and having made\r\nconfession, Vasco Nuñez, with his usual firm step and calm demeanor,\r\nmounted the scaffold. Raising his eyes to heaven he called on God to\r\nwitness his innocence. Then with a rapid farewell glance at heaven's\r\nlight and earth's beauty, at the eager upturned faces of his friends,\r\nhe placed his head upon the block, and in a moment more it was rolling\r\ntrunkless on the platform!\r\n\r\nValderrábano, Botello, and Muñoz each suffered in turn. Argüello\r\nremained. A last attempt was made to move Pedrarias. \"It cannot be,\"\r\nwas the reply. \"Rather than one of them should live, I myself will\r\ndie.\" It was dark before the last dull heavy stroke told the crowd that\r\nthe sickening work was done. With the death of the offender justice is\r\nsatisfied; not so vengeance. By order of Pedrarias the head of Vasco\r\nNuñez was placed upon a pole, and displayed in the market-place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime, which throws a misty cloud between the present and the past, and\r\nstrips the hideousness from many iniquitous deeds, drops no friendly\r\nmantle over the horrors of that day at Acla. One century after another\r\nrolls by, and the colors on the canvas deepen; the red gore dripping\r\nfrom the scaffold becomes redder, the black heart of Pedrarias blacker,\r\nand the generous qualities and brilliant achievements of Vasco Nuñez\r\nshine yet brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF SPANISH SETTLEMENT ON THE NORTH COAST.\r\n\r\n1517-1523.\r\n\r\n     DISHONESTY THE BEST POLICY—PEDRARIAS STIGMATIZED—HIS AUTHORITY\r\n     CURTAILED—QUEVEDO IN SPAIN—HE ENCOUNTERS LAS CASAS—THE\r\n     BATTLE OF THE PRIESTS—OVIEDO ENTERS THE ARENA—BUSINESS IN\r\n     DARIEN—THE INTEROCEANIC ROAD AGAIN—ITS TERMINI—PEDRARIAS\r\n     AND ESPINOSA AT PANAMÁ—THE LICENTIATE MAKES ANOTHER RAID—THE\r\n     FRIARS OF ST JEROME HAVE THEIR EYE ON PEDRARIAS—THE CABILDO\r\n     OF ANTIGUA SHAKES ITS FINGER AT HIM—CONTINUED ATTEMPTS TO\r\n     DEPOPULATE THE NORTH COAST—ALBITES BUILDS NOMBRE DE DIOS—LUCKY\r\n     LICENTIATE—ARRIVAL AND DEATH OF LOPE DE SOSA—OVIEDO RETURNS\r\n     AND DOES BATTLE WITH THE DRAGON—AND IS BEATEN FROM THE FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the villainous adjudging of Vasco Nuñez, Gaspar de Espinosa\r\nreceived his place on the South Sea. And when true tidings reached\r\nPedrarias of the appointment of Lope de Sosa as his successor, the\r\ngrizzly old governor did exactly that for which he pretended to\r\nhave beheaded Vasco Nuñez. Striking corollaries from the historical\r\npropositions of the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CONDUCT OF PEDRARIAS CONDEMNED.]\r\n\r\nThat Pedrarias was not at once deposed may seem strange to us. He was\r\ndeposed, however; but slipping south he sought new fields, as we shall\r\npresently see; and by the intercession of powerful friends at court\r\nhe managed to retain rulership for a term of years. Then, too, the\r\nchanges. It was troublesome and expensive for royalty to establish\r\nsubordinate governments in the Indies; and as nearly all of Spain's\r\nNew World governors, and, indeed, officials and subjects, were wrong in\r\nsome particular, there was not always encouragement to make a change.\r\nYet Spain and all Christendom were indignant over the infamous doings\r\nat Acla. The friars of St Jerome instantly clipped the wings of the\r\ncormorant, by ordering him in the kings name \"to resolve upon nothing by\r\nhimself, but to follow the advice of the _cabildo_[XIII-1] of Darien;\r\nand, moreover, to send to Española all the gold taken from Cacique\r\nParis.\" This was of little practical avail, however. Royalty might issue\r\nedicts; but those appointed to enforce them seemed to turn to corruption\r\non entering the atmosphere of the Indies.\r\n\r\nSome said, if the good bishop had been there, Vasco Nuñez had not died.\r\nBut according to Micer Codro it was scarcely among the possibilities\r\nfor the inauspicious friend of Balboa to have been present at the\r\nright moment. Associated with the alcalde mayor and the governor in\r\nmagisterial authority, the bishop could without doubt have diverted\r\nthe quarrel from such gory channels; for there was always enough of\r\nthe temporal in his spiritual polities to give his influence weight in\r\nbalancing power. It was a wolfish flock. The bishop complained of it\r\nto the king; and on the other hand the royal officers complained of the\r\nbishop. Both were right. It was impossible too severely to censure such\r\nacts as were constantly perpetrated by the officials of Castilla del\r\nOro, and although Quevedo had gone to Spain on the more pleasing errand\r\nof love and reconciliation, he found it convenient occasionally to say\r\na word to the king in his own defense, and not without influence on the\r\nimperial ear. Once the royal officials wrote the king that the bishop\r\nneglected the conversion of the Indians, favored Vasco Nuñez against\r\nthe government, and discouraged colonization by speaking ill of the\r\ncountry; and again that the bishop was a source of constant disturbance,\r\nand praying that a _provisor_, talented and upright, be appointed to\r\nsuperintend sacred affairs.[XIII-2]\r\n\r\nBefore the sovereign, Quevedo spoke disparagingly of both Pedrarias and\r\nVasco Nuñez; the prelate alone was perfect. But beside the genuine ring\r\nof Las Casas, the base metal of Quevedo's composition sounded flat. The\r\nprotector-general was at this time busy at once with his colonization\r\nscheme and his impeachment of the Jeronimite Fathers, who, although\r\nmeaning well, were slack in exacting the right as measured by apostolic\r\nzeal.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in the royal antechamber at Molin del Rey, while\r\nwaiting for the bishop of Badajoz, one of the king's preachers, with\r\nwhom he had an engagement to dine, Quevedo was bluntly accosted by Las\r\nCasas. \"I understand, my lord, that you are the bishop of Darien. I too\r\nam interested in the Indies, and it is my duty to offer you fellowship.\"\r\n\"Ah! Señor Casas,\" rudely replied Quevedo. \"And from what text will\r\nyou preach us a sermon to-day?\" \"I have ready two sermons,\" retorted\r\nthe always armed Protector, \"which, if you would listen to them, might\r\nprove to you of higher import than all the moneys which you bring from\r\nthe Indies.\" \"You are beside yourself! You are beside yourself!\" was all\r\nthe bishop could stammer as his host appeared and withdrew him from the\r\nmerciless shots of Las Casas. But Quevedo was not to escape so easily.\r\nPresenting himself after dinner at the house of the king's preacher, Las\r\nCasas tortured his enemy into yet hotter dispute. Young Charles hearing\r\nof it ordered the battle of the priests to be continued before him. This\r\nwas the first audience by the prince in matters relative to the Indies.\r\nBrought into the royal presence Quevedo thanked God for the honor,\r\npronounced the first governor of Darien a bad one, the second much\r\nworse, and the savages in a deplorable condition. Las Casas following\r\ncharged the fault as much to royal officers and clergy as to hidalgos\r\nand lesser subjects.\r\n\r\nSoon after this discussion Quevedo presented two memorials, one against\r\nPedrarias Dávila, and the other for restricting the power of governors\r\nin general, and of the military, and for the better protection of\r\nthe natives. He pledged himself to name a ruler for Castilla del Oro,\r\nmeaning Diego Velazquez, then governor of Cuba, who would expend from\r\nhis own private means fifteen thousand ducats in the service of the\r\ncolony. Within a few days thereafter Quevedo was seized with an illness\r\nwhich terminated in his death; Charles was summoned to accept the\r\nimperial crown, and for a time little attention was paid to the affairs\r\nof the Indies.[XIII-3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUEVEDO AND OVIEDO IN SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nAnother political agency appeared in Spain about this time. Gonzalo\r\nFernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, first chronicler of the New World, who,\r\nas we have seen, came with Pedrarias to Tierra Firme as superintendent\r\nof gold-melting and acting notary-general, becoming disgusted with both\r\nthe governor and the bishop departed from that shore in October, 1515.\r\nScarcely had Oviedo arrived at Madrid when he received word of King\r\nFerdinand's death, which was a severe blow, as he had hoped through the\r\ninfluence of his former patrons to reorganize the government of Castilla\r\ndel Oro and place it on a better basis. Proceeding to Flanders he laid\r\nthe matter before the ministers, and was referred to Cardinal Jimenez,\r\nwho listened and did nothing. There the matter rested until the death\r\nof the cardinal, when Oviedo again appeared at court and succeeded in\r\nobtaining the appointment of Lope de Sosa to succeed Pedrarias in the\r\ngovernment of Castilla del Oro. Satisfied thus far in his attempts\r\nto benefit the colonists at Antigua, he solicited for himself the\r\ngovernment of Santa Marta. The appointment was conferred; but being\r\nrefused one hundred knights of Santiago, who were deemed indispensable\r\nto the subjugation of the country, he declined the office. Like Quevedo,\r\nhe aroused the enmity of Las Casas, through his opposition to the\r\nschemes of the fiery philanthropist in the management of the natives.\r\nNevertheless Oviedo obtained many beneficial decrees for Darien. The\r\nduties of the governor were defined anew; royal officials were forbidden\r\nto trade; the royal assayer was required to give bonds; orders were\r\nissued regulating the gold-melting house; duties were abolished for four\r\nyears; the export duty on gold was reduced nearly one half for a term\r\nof five years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA business paralysis succeeded the dark days at Acla. Little was done in\r\n1518 in the way of new adventure, though Pedrarias had enough to occupy\r\nhimself withal, in keeping his own head on his shoulders. More than one\r\nlofty scheme was cut short by the stroke that laid lifeless Vasco Nuñez.\r\nThe young and hardy scarcely dared achieve prominence; the old and\r\nimbecile could not; even the ferocious genius of Francisco Pizarro lay\r\ndormant all through his fiery youth, and past early impatient manhood,\r\nunknown even to himself.\r\n\r\nMade captain-general of the South Sea, not long after the catastrophe at\r\nAcla, Espinosa was unable at once to take command in person of the force\r\nat Isla Rica. Though the licentiate was of a mild, obedient disposition,\r\nit was not without misgivings that Pedrarias permitted him to assume\r\nso important a trust, the most dangerous for purposes of revolt of any\r\nwithin the government of Castilla del Oro; for instruments employed in\r\nthe accomplishment of base purposes are not apt to inspire the greatest\r\nconfidence. But Espinosa was not a mere rover; he was an anchored\r\njudge already high in colonial office, whose robberies and murders,\r\nhowever unjust and lawless, were of a quasi judicial nature; moreover\r\nhe was popular with the soldiers, for his legal decisions by no means\r\ninterfered with popular rights in pillage and licentiousness. Indeed,\r\nwhen Pedrarias afterward contemplated absence, the people of Antigua\r\nbegged that Espinosa might be left there to govern them, but this\r\nexcited the jealousy of the governor, who refused the petition.[XIII-4]\r\n\r\nThe much talked of interoceanic chain of posts, with a commercial\r\ncity at either end, was not yet an accomplished fact. As the breadth,\r\ncoast-trends, and configuration of the country became better known, Acla\r\nwas found situated too far to the eastward. The narrowest part of the\r\nIsthmus had been ascertained, as also the most practicable route for a\r\nroad, requiring a north-coast seaport somewhere opposite Panamá, which\r\nhad long since been decided upon as the best site for a city on the\r\nsouthern seaboard. Hernan Ponce de Leon, temporarily stationed there,\r\nhad abandoned the place, so that both termini of the proposed road must\r\nbe founded anew. The point selected on the north coast was Nombre de\r\nDios.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUTH SEA ATTRACTIONS.]\r\n\r\nBefore Espinosa was ready for his South Sea command, positive\r\ninformation of the appointment of Lope de Sosa reached Antigua. It now\r\nbehooved both Pedrarias and the licentiate to look to their footing, for\r\nit was not unlikely to fare hard with them in their coming residencias.\r\nIt might be as well, after all, for these astute and subtle minds to\r\nfall back upon the idea of Vasco Nuñez—indeed, the cavalier's ideas\r\nseemed better than any of their own—of withdrawing beyond the possibly\r\ntoo restraining influences of superior authority, and establishing\r\nthemselves in freer latitudes. The north coast offered no further\r\nattractions in any event. Give them the South Sea, and Sosa might have\r\nthe north, and die there at his convenience. For it was assuredly the\r\nabode of death.\r\n\r\nPedrarias accordingly determined to make the southern seaboard his\r\nfuture base of operations, and to convey thither as much as possible\r\nof what he esteemed valuable. To this end he embarked from Acla, and\r\nlaid before the council at Antigua a proposal to abandon that site, and\r\nremove the capital to Panamá. The plan was not regarded with favor, as\r\nhe neither expected nor desired it to be; for, if Panamá was made the\r\ncapital, Sosa's government would be there, and might seriously interfere\r\nwith his projects. Two advantages were, however, gained by making the\r\nproposal. By opening the question it unsettled the minds of residents at\r\nAntigua, and enabled Pedrarias with less difficulty to enlist recruits,\r\nand it could not afterward be said that he had sought to abandon the\r\ngovernment, having offered to carry it with him. Nevertheless, he could\r\nnot part with the people and their council without a fling at them; so,\r\none night he summoned the cabildo to appear at his house, and took from\r\nthem their insignia of office, leaving the municipality to manage as\r\nbest it might during his absence. Returning to Acla, he ordered Espinosa\r\nto summon the forces stationed in the province of Pocorosa, and unite\r\nwith them all the available troops of the colony. With these, and such\r\nprovisions and articles of trade and use as they could lay their hands\r\nupon, the governor and the alcalde mayor set out across the cordillera\r\nfor the Southern Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOUNDING OF PANAMÁ.]\r\n\r\nPedrarias was not altogether satisfied with the site of his proposed\r\nPacific city. On either side of the old fish-drying station thick\r\ntangled woods rose from marshy bottoms; so that, while the spot\r\ncalled Panamá was obviously malarious, there seemed at hand no better\r\none.[XIII-5] At the Pearl Islands affairs were found as Vasco Nuñez\r\nhad left them. Compañon had proved faithful to his trust. More acts of\r\npossession were now inflicted on this thrice-gulped wilderness, one on\r\nthe mainland, January 27, 1519, and one two days after, on the Isla\r\nRica of Vasco Nuñez, called by Pedrarias as Morales had christened\r\nit, Isla de las Flores.[XIII-6] Taking the ships Balboa had built, the\r\ngovernor and Espinosa embarked the forces, and proceeded to the island\r\nof Taboga,[XIII-7] where Badajoz had been three years before, opposite\r\nand some five leagues distant from the proposed settlement.\r\n\r\nPedrarias and Espinosa had now at their command about four hundred\r\nmen, most of whom were opposed to city-building as detrimental to the\r\nnobler profession of plundering. But calming their fears in this regard,\r\nPedrarias sought to secure their interest in his scheme by partitioning\r\nthe lands adjacent to Panamá, and giving to each man a section. Foraging\r\nexpeditions were sent out at once, and the soldiers were encouraged to\r\nmake captures, and so secure laborers for their lands and means for the\r\nindulgence of their lusts. Thus every settler soon had from forty to\r\nninety slaves, who did not live long, however. Nor were the colonists at\r\nAntigua forgotten in this division, to the end that by offering superior\r\ninducements here, the northern coast might the sooner be depopulated.\r\n\r\nThe formal act of founding the city of Panamá was consummated August 15,\r\n1519; the public notary certifying that Pedrarias Dávila founded then\r\nand there a city, the name whereof was Panamá, and that in the name of\r\nGod, and of the queen, Doña Juana, and of Don Cárlos, her son, he would\r\ndefend the same against all opposers.[XIII-8]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot the least important or successful among the foraging expeditions\r\nat this time sent out from Panamá was one under Espinosa, who with a\r\nhundred and fifty men embarked in one of the brigantines in search of\r\nthe gold that Badajoz had lost. Ah! that gold; the Spaniards could\r\nscarcely sleep for thinking of it. But now the licentiate should\r\njudicially recover it; then might Panamá have rest.\r\n\r\nDropping westward a few leagues, Espinosa anchored at the mouth of a\r\nsmall river flowing through the province of Cutara, called after the son\r\nof the late Paris who now ruled that province. Ascending the river in\r\ncanoes the Spaniards surprised by night the village, and no opposition\r\nbeing offered, the robbers took such plate, provisions, cotton cloth,\r\nand Indian weapons as they could lay their hands on. It then occurred\r\nto the more ghoulish of the company to search the death-chamber of the\r\ncacique Paris, whose body was then lying in state. And there, to their\r\nunutterable joy and thankfulness, round the corpse were not only the\r\ngolden plates before captured, but piles of vessels and ornaments of\r\nthe same blessed metal. By this desecration, gold to the value of forty\r\nthousand castellanos was secured, which made glad the heart of the old\r\ngovernor at Panamá. And who shall say the learned licentiate was not an\r\nhumane and pious man, a just judge and good Christian withal, when after\r\ntaking the trouble to drive the inhabitants of that village captives to\r\nthe sea, he liberated them all at the entreaty of the youthful cacique,\r\nwho had followed them wildly wailing, and faithfully promising a ransom\r\nof as much more gold as had been already taken? On the way back the\r\nlicentiate stopped at the landing of the cacique Biruquete, of whom he\r\nbought a cargo of maize, without paying for it. Lest the treasure should\r\nfall into improper hands, half of it was buried at Panamá by Pedrarias\r\nand Espinosa; with the remainder the worthy couple set out immediately\r\nfor Antigua, where the latter paid over the king's share, and then\r\nmade preparations for a voyage of discovery along the coast, toward the\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE STUBBORN CABILDO.]\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Pedrarias that while Espinosa was absent from Darien\r\nwith the men and ships making discoveries, it would be well for him\r\nto visit Spain and place his declining power on a firmer basis. But in\r\norder to leave he must have permission from the chief authority, or else\r\nlay down his office and submit to a residencia. Since the Jeronimite\r\nFathers had made the cabildo of Antigua their agent to watch Pedrarias,\r\nand if possible keep him within the bounds of humanity and decency, he\r\napplied to it for permission to leave the country, and was refused. It\r\nwas very hard, he said, that the king's governor should be thus subject\r\nto check by a vulgar town council; but the friars at Santo Domingo must\r\nbe obeyed.\r\n\r\nSince he could not go to Spain Pedrarias wrote the royal authorities\r\nthere, setting forth what he had done at Panamá, soliciting a South\r\nSea government for himself, and the removal of the municipality and\r\ncathedral of Antigua to the new city. Again, midst much storming, he\r\napplied for leave, saying he had been chosen _procurador_ in Castile;\r\nand again he was refused permission. Then he dissembled, spoke softly,\r\nand said he loved the councilmen as his children, but nothing availed.\r\n\r\nAn act of this council, passed during his absence, greatly exasperated\r\nhim, as tending to show a disregard for his authority. This was the\r\ngranting of a request by Diego de Albites to plant a colony on the\r\ncoast of Veragua. Fearing that the friars might impose upon him further\r\nrestrictions he abruptly broke off all conference with the council of\r\nAntigua, and proceeded to Panamá.\r\n\r\nThere he found the soldiers and colonists more than ever dissatisfied.\r\nProvisions were scarce, and there was fever among them, and they said,\r\nEspinosa among the rest, if they were to become citizens, they would\r\nprefer the pure air of Spain to this pest-hole. \"Very well,\" replied\r\nthe governor, \"let the gold be unearthed, and that with all the rest\r\nreturned to the people of Paris, as the Jeronimite Fathers have ordered,\r\nand let us return to Castile. I assuredly can live there without\r\nhunger.\" A threat from Pedrarias to do a righteous act was uncommon and\r\nterrifying. The disaffected were silenced; and while Pedrarias yielded\r\nso far as to agree to the search for a more favorable country to the\r\nwestward, it was at the same time determined that the building of Panamá\r\nshould be proceeded with.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DOINGS OF ALBITES.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the cabildo of Antigua proceeded as best it could with the\r\nestablishing of a northern seaport. By several successful raids on the\r\nnorth coast, toward Veragua, Diego de Albites had accumulated wealth,\r\nand with wealth ambition more vaulting. During the war between Vasco\r\nNuñez and Pedrarias he pictured to himself political dissolution, and\r\nsent to Spain Andres Niño, a pilot, and two thousand castellanos to\r\npurchase for him a South Sea government. Better skilled in navigation\r\nthan in diplomacy Niño returned without the office and without the\r\nmoney. At another time, while left in command at Acla during Vasco\r\nNuñez' absence at the South Sea, Albites slipped cable and sailed for\r\nEspañola, where he applied for authority to build a town at Nombre de\r\nDios or establish a colony on the coast of Veragua. Referred by the\r\nfriars to Pedrarias, as an excuse for his absence he enlisted sixty\r\nmen, loaded his ships with much-needed provisions, and returned to\r\nreceive the thanks of the governor whom he had sought to circumvent.\r\nFor this faithful service he received permission from Pedrarias to\r\nmake an incursion into the province of Veragua, which greatly offended\r\nVasco Nuñez; and when Albites returned successful from this raid the\r\ncabildo at Antigua granted him permission to establish a settlement\r\nnot only in that province, but at Nombre de Dios, to Pedrarias' extreme\r\nannoyance.[XIII-9]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1517 that Albites returned to Antigua from Veragua, Chagre,\r\nand Nombre de Dios with much gold and many slaves. According to Herrera\r\nhe attempted an expedition to Veragua in 1518, but was driven back to\r\nNombre de Dios, where he founded a city. Andagoya is correct, however,\r\nwhen he places the settlement of Nombre de Dios in the latter part of\r\n1519, though it was not by order of Pedrarias as he affirms. Embarking\r\nfrom Antigua in a brigantine and caravel, Albites touched at the isle\r\nof Bastimentos, and coasted westward a few leagues, raiding upon the\r\nnatives for gold with meagre results. One of the ships becoming leaky he\r\nreturned to Bastimentos, where it foundered. Thence he was conveyed by\r\nthe cacique in canoes to Nombre de Dios, and at once set about building\r\na town.\r\n\r\nTwo opposite posts being thus established, a road was constructed from\r\nsea to sea, \"through the mountains overgrown with thick woods never\r\ntouched from all eternity,\" as Peter Martyr expresses it. At great labor\r\nand cost both to the crown and to the colonists, a way wide enough for\r\nvehicles was cut through the thickets; trees were felled and thrown\r\ninto the marshes, obstructing rocks torn from their beds, and bridges\r\nmade where necessary.[XIII-10] Thus was opened through primeval shades\r\na passage for the blessings and the curses of that Atlantic civilization\r\nwhich was to illuminate the Pacific.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis same year the lucky licentiate and alcalde mayor, Gaspar de\r\nEspinosa, was gaining further renown as discoverer and treasure-seeker.\r\nWith Juan de Castañeda as pilot, he coasted one hundred and eighty\r\nleagues toward the north-west, touching at Huistá, Natá, Chirú, Chame,\r\nand other posts, and returned to Panamá well laden with maize and other\r\nprovisions, and gold to the value of thirty-three thousand castellanos.\r\nDuring this exploration he entered a gulf to which he gave the name\r\nCulebras,[XIII-11] from the many snakes of various colors seen there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INOPPORTUNE DEATH OF SOSA.]\r\n\r\nA stroke of better fortune than he deserved likewise befell Pedrarias\r\nnot long after. In May, 1520, Lope de Sosa, with three hundred men,\r\narrived and anchored in the harbor of Antigua. Pedrarias, who was there\r\nat the time, immediately made preparations to receive him with becoming\r\nceremony. Having given orders concerning his disembarkation, the new\r\ngovernor entered his cabin to dress. While there he was seized with\r\na sudden illness, from which he shortly after expired. With mournful\r\npomp and outward demonstration of grief Pedrarias conveyed the body\r\nto the church and buried it before the altar. Juan Alonso de Sosa, the\r\nson, and all the followers of the late governor were treated with that\r\nshow of distinction which the old courtier could so well assume. Juan\r\nRodriguez de Alarconcillo, who came as alcalde mayor, and before whom\r\nthe residencia of the outgoing governor would have been taken, was\r\nfavored with marked consideration. By way of prudence, some time before\r\nthe anticipated arrival of his judge Pedrarias had sent his wife to\r\nSpain with all his gold and pearls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSosa's appointment to supersede Pedrarias was one of the reformatory\r\nmeasures which the chronicler Oviedo claims to have effected while in\r\nSpain.[XIII-12] For himself he had obtained, besides the offices of\r\nveedor and escribano-general, those of collector of chamber penalties\r\nand _regidor perpetuo_ of Antigua. Orders were issued, furthermore,\r\nto all New World governors to furnish him a truthful report of all\r\ntheir acts, so that he might complete the General History of the Indies\r\nalready begun. He was also appointed receiver of the property of Vasco\r\nNuñez and his accomplices which had been confiscated to the king. He\r\narrived at Antigua with his wife and two children soon after Sosa.\r\n\r\nBut the heart of the scholar was not in the coarse cunning of Darien\r\npolitics; he became discontented, irritable, and while commanding the\r\nrespect of the colonists he was not popular with them. They did not want\r\nreform so much as plunder. Pedrarias was his enemy, as he was the enemy\r\nof every well-meaning man of ability. The deaths first of a boy and then\r\nof his wife did not tend to sweeten his disposition. \"Many times would I\r\nhave returned to Spain,\" he exclaims, \"had not need and shame prevented\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThe powers of the governor having been enlarged by means of the veedor,\r\nOviedo's was the first head on which they were visited. The principal\r\nquarrel was over the depopulation of the northern coast. The veedor\r\nprotested in the king's name, but the governor, now lord of all, was\r\ndetermined to execute his cherished project while he possessed the\r\npower. There was no longer any need of a north-coast capital; Pedrarias\r\nwould make Panamá his metropolis. Before introducing further changes,\r\nhowever, it was necessary that his residencia should be taken. But this,\r\nwith his experience, need be nothing more than an arraignment and trial\r\nof himself. At his request the licentiate Alarconcillo published the\r\nresidencia for thirty days, during which time the governor continued\r\nto exercise the functions of office; no one appeared against him, and\r\na certificate of the proceeding was sent to Spain. Pedrarias then took\r\nup his permanent abode at Panamá.\r\n\r\nNot long afterward the veedor and contador were obliged to visit Panamá\r\nto weigh some gold and receive the royal share, since the governor would\r\nno longer send the metal to Antigua. The contador took up his residence\r\nthere, but Oviedo returned to Antigua, more than ever determined to\r\nstand by that city. Seeing which Pedrarias was satisfied he could no\r\nmore effectually ruin his adversary than by permitting him to have his\r\nown way. Besides, it were as well to stop the tongue and pen of one\r\nwho could make and unmake governors. So when next Oviedo complained\r\nPedrarias answered, \"Señor Veedor, since you know so well how to achieve\r\nsuch desirable results, accept from me what power I possess, and govern\r\nAntigua according to your pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OVIEDO AS RULER.]\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation Oviedo accepted the proposal, and presented his\r\ncredentials to the municipal council in November, 1521. Opening his\r\nadministration with the enthusiasm of a novice, he straightway set\r\nabout correcting abuses. He forbade blasphemy, keeping mistresses, and\r\nselling or eating meat on Saturday. He prohibited gambling, and burned\r\nall the cards in the public square. A dishonest notary was required to\r\nmake restitution fourfold and be suspended from office for one year.\r\nIndian women must no longer be employed as beasts of burden, and Indian\r\nchildren must not be sold and bought as slaves. Certain more practicable\r\nprovisions, however, saved Antigua, for a time, from the effects of\r\na morality which standing alone would have killed any colony in the\r\nIndies. The new ruler bought for small sums the houses of those leaving,\r\nand sold them to new-comers at cost. He erected a market, opened mines,\r\nbuilt ships, and sent out expeditions to smooth the ruffled plumage\r\nof the savage. He made of old iron five hundred hatchets, which were\r\nsold to the Indians; and when they became dulled, their owners not\r\nknowing how to sharpen them, he placed on board a vessel three large\r\ngrindstones, covered so that the uncivilized might not steal the\r\nsecret, and proceeded along the coast grinding such implements as the\r\nIndians brought, and charging therefor a sum equal to the original cost,\r\nwhich was cheerfully paid. It is claimed that more than seven thousand\r\ncastellanos were thus secured during one voyage.\r\n\r\nA greater prosperity followed these measures than pleased Pedrarias.\r\nBut by revoking the many decisions of his deputy that came up on appeal\r\nfrom dissatisfied colonists, the governor was enabled to render Oviedo's\r\nposition one of little power.\r\n\r\nThe staff of officials was increased by yet another alcalde mayor, the\r\nlicentiate Sancho de Salaya, for the South Sea government particularly,\r\nwho arrived at Antigua in a caravel from Spain, the 1st of July, 1522.\r\nWith him came Rodrigo Perez, the friend of Vasco Nuñez, vicar when sent\r\nin chains to Spain, but returned arch-deacon.[XIII-13]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a rebellion broke out on the Rio Grande San Juan, caused\r\nby outrages perpetrated by the bachiller Corral and Martin Estete during\r\na foraging expedition. Heedless of the warning of Oviedo, Martin de\r\nMurga, visitador of the Indians, in company with three Spaniards and ten\r\nfriendly Indians, paid a visit to Bea, the cacique of this province, who\r\nslew the entire party. Juan de Escaray with forty men was sent against\r\nthe revolted chieftain.\r\n\r\nSoon after some christianized Indians came down from the mountains,\r\neight leagues distant, and reported outrages on them by the cacique\r\nCorobari. Thirty-five men were sent to capture him, and when brought in,\r\nSalaya sentenced him to be burned; after which the licentiate proceeded\r\nto Panamá. Several spies caught near Antigua about the same time\r\nconfessed under torture to an insurrection contemplated by the cacique\r\nGuaturo, who had joined Bea. It was his plan to fire the town and slay\r\nthe inhabitants. Oviedo in person, with forty men, proceeded against\r\nthe new rebel, who, with several of the conspirators, was captured and\r\nhanged. This was the last of the wars of Antigua.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OVIEDO RETIRES.]\r\n\r\nAt length it pleased Pedrarias to depose Oviedo, and appoint in his\r\nplace the bachiller Corral, who had shortly before incurred the anger\r\nof the chronicler, and had by him been sent in chains to Spain, on\r\nthe charge of having there a wife while living himself in the Indies.\r\nThe ubiquitous bachiller re-appeared at Antigua, however, almost in a\r\ntwinkling. Of course, the chronicler was very indignant. The revocation\r\nwas read in council; whereupon Oviedo laid his staff of office on the\r\nchair which he had occupied as president, and took his seat among the\r\nmembers, saying, \"This is my place, given me by the emperor; here will\r\nI henceforth serve their Majesties, as in duty bound, and here only.\"\r\nAccompanying the revocation was a decree from Pedrarias, authorizing\r\nthe city of Antigua to elect a representative to a general assembly, to\r\nbe convened at Panamá for the purpose of providing measures important\r\nto the province, and to elect _procuradores de córtes_, or members of\r\nCongress to send to Spain. Pedrarias preferred Espinosa to represent\r\nAntigua, for obvious reasons; but instead of sending a delegate to the\r\njunta at Panamá, the people of Antigua chose their own representative in\r\nthe person of Oviedo. While waiting for a vessel Oviedo occupied himself\r\nby presenting charges against Pedrarias before the new alcalde mayor,\r\nAlarconcillo, who had ordered a second residencia of the governor, and\r\nalso one of Espinosa. For this pastime he not only narrowly escaped\r\npaying with his life, at the hand of an assassin, but Pedrarias ordered\r\nhis late lieutenant's own residencia to be taken, and even placed him in\r\nirons until bonds should be given. The trial was passed without further\r\ndamage than a fine of twenty castellanos for sending Corral to Spain.\r\nAnother attempt being made at murder, Oviedo on the 3d of July, 1523,\r\nstole away, embarking ostensibly for Nombre de Dios, but bearing off,\r\nhe directed his course toward Cuba and Jamaica, and thence sailed to\r\nSpain. Verily, these were the days of dissimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nGIL GONZALEZ IN COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA.\r\n\r\n1519-1523.\r\n\r\n     ANDRÉS NIÑO AND HIS SPICE ISLANDS—FAILS TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY\r\n     TO DISCOVER—APPLIES TO GIL GONZALEZ DÁVILA—AGREEMENT WITH\r\n     THE KING—ROYAL ORDER FOR THE SHIPS OF VASCO NUÑEZ—PEDRARIAS\r\n     REFUSES TO DELIVER THEM—GIL GONZALEZ TRANSPORTS SHIPS ACROSS\r\n     THE MOUNTAINS—EMBARKS FROM THE PEARL ISLANDS—GIL GONZALEZ\r\n     PROCEEDS BY LAND AND NIÑO BY SEA—VISIT TO NICOYA—AND TO\r\n     NICARAGUA—THE CAPTAIN-GENERAL CONVERTS MANY SOULS—AND GATHERS\r\n     MUCH GOLD—FIGHT WITH DIRIANGEN—NICARAGUA APOSTATIZES—THE\r\n     SPANIARDS TERMINATE THE DISCOVERY AND HASTEN TO THEIR\r\n     SHIPS—NIÑO'S VOYAGE TO FONSECA BAY—RETURN TO PANAMÁ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pilot Andrés Niño was an enterprising fellow, not to be put down\r\nby any slight frown of fortune. He had lately seen service with Vasco\r\nNuñez, and would, God willing, follow the fantasy thence engendered.\r\nIf two thousand castellanos could not buy a small slice of dominion\r\non the North Sea, he would try the South. And in the mind of Niño,\r\nas with other navigators of that day, the undiscovered South assumed\r\nfantastic shape. There was the originally created strait, actual though\r\ninvisible, leading to the Spice Islands hard by. Why should not one\r\npilot as well as another sail through that strait to those fragrant\r\nshores, even though the voyage must be begun by crossing a little strip\r\nof cordillera?\r\n\r\nSuch was New World geography in 1519, when the inspired pilot found\r\nhimself in Spain, soliciting the Council of the Indies for the ships of\r\nVasco Nuñez, in which to make his voyage to the Moluccas; for, if so\r\nbe he might get there for the asking, it would save him much trouble.\r\nNiño had come under the patronage of Alonso de la Puente, the royal\r\ntreasurer, and accompanied by Andrés de Cereceda; but the persuasive\r\neloquence of the worthy pilot was wanting in the soft, seductive\r\ntones that come from the ring of precious metals, and a second time\r\nBellerophon fell to earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF GIL GONZALEZ.]\r\n\r\nIt happened that the contador of Española, Gil Gonzalez Dávila,[XIV-1]\r\nwas then at the court of Spain; and it was suggested to Niño, who\r\nseemed to have exhausted all his resources, that if he could engage\r\nthat gentleman's interest in the enterprise, it would be equivalent to\r\nits accomplishment. For he was a man of no small influence, springing\r\nfrom a good family of Ávila, and having been formerly attached to\r\nthe household of the all-potential bishop of Búrgos. Possessed of\r\nexceptional ability and integrity, he had been sometimes sent by the\r\ngovernment on missions of importance and trust, and was engaged in\r\none of them when first we met him at Santo Domingo, investigating the\r\naffairs of the defaulting treasurer, Santa Clara. His energy was of\r\nthe substantial cast, authoritative, robust, and direct. He seldom\r\nmade mistakes, either in men or measures; and seemingly was strongest\r\nwhen standing at ease. Neither so bold as Vasco Nuñez, nor so cunning\r\nas Pedrarias, nor so cruel as Pizarro, nor so learned as Espinosa, he\r\nwas a man of deeper and broader experience than any one of them, with\r\na more evenly balanced mind, a cooler, sounder judgment, not always a\r\nwarrant for greater success than with a more senseless recklessness, but\r\non the whole much safer as a colleague, and more reliable as a friend.\r\nHe was not a man easily diverted by hollow schemes, however brilliant\r\nor high-soaring; but when Niño laid before him his plans, he saw at\r\nonce that they were eminently practical. There were the ships, and\r\nthere the undiscovered sea, of which was already known that its shores\r\nabounded in gold and pearls, guarded by naked and almost weaponless\r\nmen—this, and little more. What more was wanted? It did not require a\r\nPeriander to tell the accomplished contador that this was no ordinary\r\nopportunity. Fonseca, who had always retained a warm interest in his\r\nprotégé, heartily approved the plan, and the details were soon arranged\r\nwith Niño. Gil Gonzalez was to be captain-general of the expedition;\r\nto him was given the habit of Santiago, and he was recommended to the\r\nnewly appointed governor of Castilla del Oro, Lope de Sosa. Niño was\r\nto be a partner in the enterprise, with the position of pilot. Cereceda\r\nwas chosen contador of the discovery.[XIV-2]\r\n\r\nA royal order[XIV-3] was issued at Barcelona the 18th of June, 1519,\r\ndirecting the governor of Castilla del Oro to deliver to Gil Gonzalez\r\nthe vessels built by Vasco Nuñez, and authorizing an expedition for\r\nSouth Sea discovery, the expense of which was to be borne largely by\r\nthe crown. With this cédula Lope de Sosa promised faithfully to comply.\r\n\r\nDuring the year following the execution of these documents Andrés Niño\r\nso bestirred himself, that his captain-general was enabled to land at\r\nAcla with two hundred men, prior to the arrival at Antigua of Lope de\r\nSosa. Pedrarias was incensed that any one should presume to intermeddle\r\nin Tierra Firme affairs. Gil Gonzalez nevertheless despatched to\r\nhim with the royal order Juan de Sauce, who duly delivered it in the\r\npresence of the notary Martin Estete.[XIV-4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECEPTION OF A CÉDULA.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth witnessing the reception by this arch-hypocrite of a royal\r\ncommand. \"And forthwith the said lieutenant-general,\" writes the notary,\r\n\"took the said cédula of his Highness in his hands, and kissed it, and\r\nplaced it on his head, and said that he would obey it, and that he did\r\nobey it with the utmost reverence he could and ought, as a letter and\r\ncommandment of his king and natural lord, whom may it please God our\r\nLord to let live and reign during many and long years, with increase\r\nof kingdoms and seignories; and, as to the fulfilment thereof, that his\r\nlordship would see to it, and answer and provide thereupon as might be\r\nconducive to his Highness' service.\"\r\n\r\nIn which pathetic demonstration no one who knew Pedrarias could doubt\r\nthat he never for a moment intended to do as he had said. Rather than\r\ntamely admit a new and dangerous rival, high in reputation and royal\r\nfavor, some risk might be run. And so he at first agreed, then delayed,\r\ninterposing technicalities and pretexts, and finally refused to deliver\r\nthe ships, alleging as an excuse that they were private property, and\r\nclaimed as such by individuals. In vain the captain-general urged that\r\nthis was not a question of rights of property, but of royal command,\r\nwhich to disobey was dangerous. Pedrarias stood his ground; and fortune\r\nsustained him in the death of Sosa, who, had he lived, would have made\r\nall well for the expedition. But in Gil Gonzalez the old governor found\r\nhis match; for the captain-general was no less decided than he, and far\r\nquicker in resources.\r\n\r\nWhat Gil Gonzalez did was to copy the magnificent performance of Vasco\r\nNuñez, under the circumstances scarcely less creditable in the imitation\r\nthan in the original. After strengthening his command by recruits from\r\nthe officers and men of the Pedrarias government, among whom were the\r\ntreasurer Puente and the contador Diego Marquez, he dismantled his\r\nships, packed up the sails and cordage, and taking from the hulls the\r\niron, and such of the timbers as better suited the purpose than those\r\nfreshly cut, which were also necessary, he secured the services of some\r\nIndians, and transported his vessels across the sierra to the same Rio\r\nBalsas used by Balboa. There he constructed and launched four vessels,\r\nbut lost them all before reaching the mouth of the river.[XIV-5] The\r\nparty, reduced in number more than one half since leaving Acla,[XIV-6]\r\nnow crossed in canoes to the Pearl Islands.\r\n\r\nA letter directed to Pedrarias in this emergency was productive of no\r\nresults. Gil Gonzalez again requested possession of the vessels of\r\nVasco Nuñez; his messenger brought back a surly verbal refusal. The\r\ncaptain-general then presented himself in person before the governor\r\nand demanded at least men for the building of new ships. Pedrarias\r\ndared not offer further opposition; and in time four small and poorly\r\nequipped vessels lay at the Pearl Islands ready for sea.[XIV-7] \"In all\r\nmy experience while in the service of your Majesty,\" writes Gil Gonzalez\r\nto the king, \"I have nowhere been handled so roughly as in crossing\r\nTierra Firme with the men I had brought from Castile, having to support\r\nthem for two years, and spend my goods and jewels on them, and build\r\nthe ships twice over.\"[XIV-8]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE VOYAGE NORTH-WESTWARD.]\r\n\r\nEmbarking the 21st of January, 1522, having on board a few horses,\r\nwith arms and articles for traffic, Gil Gonzalez struck westward, and\r\nafter sailing one hundred leagues he was obliged to beach three of his\r\nvessels to save them from the worms, while the fourth returned to Panamá\r\nfor pitch and other articles for repairs. New water-casks had likewise\r\nto be made, as those on board were failing through the rotting of the\r\nhoops.[XIV-9] Leaving the ships in charge of Andrés Niño, with orders to\r\nfollow the coast for eighty or a hundred leagues, and there in some safe\r\nharbor to await him, Gil Gonzalez with one hundred men and four horses\r\ncontinued his way by land. Poor food, a hot sun, with heavy rains and\r\nsoftened ground, made the journey excessively irksome. The wading of\r\nrivers while the body was heated brought upon the commander a cramp, so\r\nthat he had to be carried. Thus they trudged for many days, gathering\r\ngold, and christianizing the country, meeting no resistance.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to what they called an island, ten leagues in length\r\nby six in breadth, \"formed by the branches of a river,\" which was no\r\nisland, however, but the peninsula which forms the western side of the\r\nGolfo Dulce.[XIV-10] Here in a huge wooden shed, as high as a tower,\r\nwhich the chroniclers please to call a palace, dwelt the ruler of that\r\nland, who was invited to retire while the strangers took possession in\r\nthe upper part, the lower being flooded. For a fortnight they sheltered\r\nthemselves from the falling waters. One night the palace posts began\r\nslowly to sink into the softened earth. The outlook was not encouraging.\r\nTheir only shelter was sinking, and with it they were being submerged.\r\nThey saved themselves, however, by cutting through the roof, and thus\r\nmade their way out, bearing the commander on their shoulders. They were\r\nthen obliged to take to trees, and to dwell in them for several days,\r\nthe commander's quarters being a blanket stretched between two branches.\r\nDuring the flood were lost many weapons and much plunder.\r\n\r\nAfter this they proceeded, sometimes going inland for food, but groping\r\nalong the shore as best they might. Once when obliged to seek the ocean\r\nten leagues away, they descended a river on rafts, one of which floated\r\nout to sea in the dark, but was brought to shore next morning by a lucky\r\nbreeze and some expert swimming. Finally, after visiting and robbing\r\na number of petty chieftains, and securing gold to the value of forty\r\nthousand pesos, they came to a gulf[XIV-11] which Gil Gonzalez called\r\nSan Vicente, and where to his great joy he found Andrés Niño with the\r\nships.\r\n\r\nOwing to his lameness Gil Gonzalez would have embarked by sea, sending\r\nNiño with the land party; but the men lost courage at the prospect\r\nof remaining on shore without their leader, because the caciques were\r\nbecoming more powerful. He accordingly bound Niño by oath to explore the\r\ncoast with two ships, slowly and by day only, and reckon the distance\r\nsailed, leaving the other two vessels with the gold in San Vicente Gulf,\r\nwhile he himself plunged boldly inland, determined to subjugate the\r\npeople, peaceably, if possible, otherwise by force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NICOYA.]\r\n\r\nAmong the caciques whom Gil Gonzalez met was one most powerful living\r\nnear the northern end of the gulf, named Nicoya, who gave a friendly\r\nreception as a friend, and presented him with gold to the value of\r\nfourteen thousand castellanos. When told of God, and of the bliss of\r\nheaven and the pains of hell, Nicoya very sensibly preferred the former\r\nplace, and permitted himself, his wives and subjects, to the number of\r\nover six thousand souls, to be baptized. Furthermore he gave up six\r\ngolden idols, each of a span in length, \"For being now a Christian,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I shall have nothing more to do with them.\" Which emblems of\r\nperdition the Spaniards did by no means scruple to take.\r\n\r\nNicoya was a great chief, but there was a mightier than he, fifty\r\nleagues to the northward, whose name was Nicaragua, of whom Nicoya said:\r\n\"He is wise as well as valiant, and your little army will quickly melt\r\nbefore his warrior host.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the peaceful policy adopted in this expedition\r\nhad thus far proved successful beyond that of any other similar attempt\r\nin the Indies. The sword remained sheathed, and it was found profitable\r\nas well as humane to keep it so. Hence these gentle robbers walked\r\nthe land triumphant. The truth is, for the times Gil Gonzalez was an\r\nhonest man. He tells large stories about baptizing, as we shall see;\r\nbut we are accustomed to some degree of exaggeration where proselyting\r\nis concerned, and Gil Gonzalez really believed that the Christianity\r\nhe gave Nicoya paid him well for his gold. Beside being honest, Gil\r\nGonzalez was humane; he did not delight in blood. Let us doublemark\r\nthese traits, for they are rare hereabouts.\r\n\r\nHow different was this from the usual form with which the captains of\r\nPedrarias introduced themselves to savagism, may be seen in the approach\r\nby Gil Gonzalez to a people of doubtful temper. When within one day's\r\nmarch of Nicaragua's town he despatched to that chieftain an embassy\r\nof six Indians and two interpreters to notify him of his proximity\r\nand character. \"Tell him,\" said Gonzalez, \"that a captain cometh,\r\ncommissioned to these parts by the great king of the Christians, to tell\r\nall the lords of these lands that there is in the heavens, higher than\r\nthe sun, one lord, maker of all things, and that those believing and\r\nobeying him shall at death ascend to that loftiness, while disbelievers\r\nshall be driven into the fire beneath the earth. Tell him to be ready\r\nto hear and accept these truths, or else to prepare for battle.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\nNicoya spoke the truth when he pronounced Nicaragua a wise man. There\r\nis great advantage in possessing an intellect unclouded by learning. He\r\nwas both wise and honest enough to manifest amazement when messengers\r\nbrought to him things amazing. \"Tell those who sent you,\" said\r\nNicaragua, \"that I know not their king and therefore cannot do him\r\nhomage; that I fear not their sharp swords, but love peace rather than\r\nwar; gold has little value, they are welcome to what I have. In regard\r\nto the religion they teach I will talk with them, and if I like it I\r\nwill adopt it.\" Of the two messages, that of the savage was far the more\r\nlogical and sensible.\r\n\r\nNext day when within one league of the town the Spaniards were met by\r\nfour of Nicaragua's principal men, who told them that the king awaited\r\ntheir coming in peace. On entering the town they were received by\r\nNicaragua, who assigned them lodgings in the public square, and placed\r\nall the surrounding houses at their disposal.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation of gifts, which, voluntary or forced, was always\r\nfirst in order, and which in this instance consisted on one side of\r\ngold to the value of fifteen thousand castellanos, and on the other of a\r\nshirt, a red cap, and a silken dress, attention was turned to spiritual\r\naffairs. To a lengthy harangue on what the savage must do and not do in\r\norder to attain Christian salvation, Nicaragua replied: \"I see no harm\r\nin it. We cannot, however, give up our war-paint and weapons, our gay\r\ndecorations and dances, and become women!\"\r\n\r\nBefore accepting baptism[XIV-12] Nicaragua desired to ask Gil Gonzalez\r\na few questions. \"You who know so much of the maker and of the making\r\nof this world, tell me,\" said he, \"of the great flood; and will there\r\nbe another? In the universal end, will the earth be overturned, or will\r\nthe sky fall and destroy us? Whence do the sun and moon obtain their\r\nlight, and how will they lose it? How large are the stars; how are they\r\nheld in the sky, and moved about? Why are the nights made dark, and\r\nthe winters cold; why did not the Christian's God make a better world;\r\nwhat honor is due him; and what rights and duties has man, under whose\r\ndominion are the beasts? Whither goes the soul which you hold to be\r\nimmortal when it leaves the body? Does the Pope never die; and is the\r\ngreat king of Spain a mortal; and why do the Christians so love gold?\"\r\nThese and other questions of like import the savage asked, and Gil\r\nGonzalez answered them. There was no question that brave and pious Gil\r\nGonzalez could not answer. And Peter Martyr says that \"Cereceda, the\r\nking's treasurer, witnessed the manner in which Gonzalez answered the\r\nquestions of Nicaragua.\" Strange to say, the savage was not satisfied.\r\nDoubtless Gil Gonzalez could have made himself better understood by\r\na Christian. \"Came these men hither from heaven?\" whispered Nicaragua\r\nto the interpreter. \"They came from heaven,\" was the reply. \"But how?\"\r\nasked Nicaragua, \"directly down, like the flight of an arrow, or riding\r\na cloud, or in a circuit like a bent bow?\" The interpreter could not\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nNicaragua finally consented to have the idols in his temple removed, and\r\nthe Christian's cross placed in their stead. A specimen of the worship\r\nthey had adopted was then given them with great solemnity. Upon a high\r\nmound, whose summit was reached by steps, Gil Gonzalez had planted the\r\ncross on first entering the town. A procession headed by the Spanish\r\nand the native leaders now marched solemnly about the town, and ascended\r\nthe steps of the mound[XIV-13] on their knees, chanting their hymns of\r\npraise the while. Proceeding to the temple, they erected there an altar,\r\nand jointly placed upon it the sacred emblem, in token the one of giving\r\nand the other of receiving the true faith. Such was the conquest and\r\nconversion of Nicaragua, unique and spiritual.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FRESHWATER SEA.]\r\n\r\nNicaragua's town stood on a large fresh-water sea,[XIV-14] into which\r\nGil Gonzalez rode his horse and took possession, drinking of the\r\nwater. It was barely three leagues from the South Sea; but there was\r\nno connection, and a canoe sent out upon it could discover no current.\r\n\"The pilots I had with me,\" writes the commander in his narrative of the\r\nexpedition, \"certify that it opens into the North Sea; and if so it is\r\na great discovery, as the distance from one sea to the other is but two\r\nor three leagues of very level road.\"[XIV-15] One other matter claimed\r\nthe attention of the discoverer at this juncture; which was to ascertain\r\nwhether the invaders of Mexico, whose conquest was known at Panamá prior\r\nto the sailing of this expedition, had carried their operations so far\r\nsouth as this point. After close inquiry among the natives Gil Gonzalez\r\nwas satisfied that they had not.[XIV-16]\r\n\r\nApril of this year, 1522, was now at hand, and Gil Gonzalez, well\r\nsatisfied thus far, must determine what next to do. Before he was aware\r\nof it, baptism had become the rage in all that region. His stay at\r\nNicaragua had been for eight days. Then he went forward north-westwardly\r\nsix leagues into the next province, and found there a cluster of six\r\ntowns, of two thousand inhabitants each, all the towns being less than\r\ntwo leagues apart. These people, jealous lest Nicaragua should secure\r\nto himself all the efficacies of the mysterious rite, came forward in\r\nmultitudes to receive it, freely giving the Spaniards gold and food and\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIRIANGEN.]\r\n\r\nYet farther before the visitors spread their fame, until a powerful\r\ncacique, called Diriangen, came in great state from some distance to\r\nmeet them. To make the most imposing appearance possible, when within\r\na short distance of the Spaniards Diriangen halted, and arranged his\r\ntrain. Five hundred unarmed men advanced, each carrying one or two\r\nturkeys, whose gay plumage made brilliant the spectacle. After them came\r\nten banner-men, their flags yet furled. Then followed seventeen women\r\nnearly covered with plates of gold; after which were five trumpeters;\r\nand lastly, the chief men of the nation, bearing on their shoulders a\r\npalanquin richly adorned with colored cloths and feathers, in which sat\r\nthe potentate. The cortége then moved forward and entered the village\r\nwhere the Spaniards were encamped, drawing up in perfect order before\r\nthe commander's quarters. The litter was placed on the ground, the ten\r\nwhite banners were unfurled, and the trumpeters blew a shrill melody.\r\nPresently Diriangen ordered the musicians to cease, and approaching\r\nGil Gonzalez he touched his hand. Then turning to the women, he ordered\r\nthe gold to be presented, including two hundred golden hatchets, which\r\namounted altogether in value to eighteen thousand castellanos. The\r\nfive hundred Indians now came forward, and after severally touching the\r\nhand of the commander, presented the fowls to him. \"For what purpose,\"\r\nasked Gil Gonzalez of the chieftain, \"have you come so far to meet me?\"\r\nDiriangen answered: \"Having learned that a wonderful people, bearded\r\nand riding upon beasts, had arrived in this land, I come that with\r\nmy own eyes I may behold them, and offer such hospitality as is in my\r\npower.\" Gil Gonzalez thanked the chieftain courteously, presented him\r\nsome European articles, and after further conversation asked him if he\r\ndid not wish to become a Christian, and a subject of the king of Spain.\r\nDiriangen intimated that it would give him great pleasure to accept both\r\nof these flattering proposals, but that he first desired to confer with\r\nhis women and priests; he would return answer within three days.\r\n\r\nNow Diriangen was a wily lord, who cared not a jot for the king of\r\nSpain, or for his religion. He wished to see this spectacle, and he\r\nwas willing to pay royally for admission to it. The faith his fathers\r\nhad held was sufficient for him, and he preferred ruling himself rather\r\nthan being subject to another. He believed he could vanquish that little\r\ncompany; at all events he would try. With these reflections he bid the\r\nSpaniards a warm adieu, mounted his litter, and was carried away. This\r\nwas on the 14th of April.\r\n\r\nThree days after, while the clergyman of the expedition was absent\r\nat a neighboring town whither he had gone mounted on the best horse\r\nand attended by two valiant men, to preach, and the Spaniards were\r\ntaking their mid-day siesta, Diriangen came down upon them with three\r\nthousand[XIV-17] men, armed with flint-toothed swords, lances, and\r\narrows, and mailed in coats of wadded cotton, and was within a cross-bow\r\nshot of them before the alarm was given. Gil Gonzalez sprang upon one\r\nof the three remaining horses, and shouted to his men to rally in front\r\nof his dwelling, which faced the square. He then placed one third of\r\nhis force in the rear of the house, fearful lest the enemy should fire\r\nit, for it contained all their gold. By this time the square was filled\r\nwith Diriangen's warriors, who gave immediate battle, hand to hand. The\r\nswift death-blows of the Spaniards seemed to carry no special terror\r\nwith them, and for a time it was extremely doubtful how the fight would\r\nturn. The Indians brought six Spaniards to the ground, and captured\r\none, whom, however, they manifested no disposition to kill. Finally,\r\nupon a charge of the commander and the two other horsemen with their\r\nlances, the enemy gave way and were driven out of the town. Gil Gonzalez\r\nrecklessly pursued, until wearied with killing, and alone, he turned,\r\nwhen there fell on him a shower of stones and darts which hurried him\r\nback to his people. Diriangen had kept in the background during the\r\nbattle, and disappeared immediately it was over. None of the Spaniards\r\nwere lost. The captive was recovered; the priest returned in safety, and\r\nthe Indians were finally permitted to carry off their dead. Luckily Gil\r\nGonzalez had taken the precaution to increase the number of bearded men\r\nby cutting hair from the heads of Spaniards and fixing it to the chins\r\nof twenty-five young natives of his company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nAfter due consultation it was decided to terminate the exploration at\r\nthis point and return to Panamá. They had obtained a large amount of\r\ngold, and had baptized many. The results from the conversions, however,\r\nwould have been far more pleasing to the Spaniards had not so many\r\nof the Indians apostatized before their back was fairly turned. As\r\nthe Spaniards entered the province of Nicaragua, on the way to their\r\nships, a plan of that sapient ruler was revealed to Gil Gonzalez, none\r\nother than to repeat the experiment of Diriangen. Immediately sixty\r\nSpaniards, all who were at present sound, formed into a hollow square,\r\nso as to act defensively and offensively while marching, having the\r\ninvalids and treasure in the centre, and at each corner a horseman and\r\nan arquebusier. As they passed by Nicaragua's town the natives cried\r\nout to the carriers, who had been lent the Spaniards by Nicaragua,\r\nto throw down their loads. To this the Spaniards made no reply; but\r\nwhen the natives attempted by force to accomplish their purpose, Gil\r\nGonzalez hurried forward the weakest of his force, and placed himself\r\nwith seventeen men in the rear. A desultory fight was kept up for\r\nsome distance, during which the cargo-bearers managed to throw down\r\ntheir loads and escape, to the unutterable disgust of the Spaniards,\r\nwho were thus obliged to carry them. Gaining nothing by this, but\r\nrather losing, the natives made peace. Nicaragua, by his messengers,\r\ndisclaimed any agency in the attack, but the Spaniards had recognized\r\nsome of his principal men among the assailants. At length they reached\r\nthe gulf of San Vicente in safety, eight days after the return of the\r\nparty discovering by sea. Niño had coasted three hundred and fifty\r\nleagues north-westerly, reaching, according to some estimates, the very\r\nsouthern limit of Cortés' conquests. Hardly any details, however, are\r\ngiven beyond the statement that he discovered a large bay which Gil\r\nGonzalez named Fonseca, in honor of his friend and patron the bishop\r\nof Búrgos. To an island within this bay he gave the name of his own\r\nniece, Petronila.[XIV-18] Returning, the expedition reached Panamá, June\r\n25, 1523, with gold in value to 112,000 pesos, half of which was of\r\ninferior quality. According to his reckoning Gil Gonzalez had coasted\r\nsix hundred and fifty leagues, travelling by land three hundred and\r\ntwenty-four leagues, and converting to Christianity thirty-two thousand\r\nsouls.[XIV-19]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSPANISH DEPREDATIONS ROUND PANAMÁ BAY.\r\n\r\n1521-1526.\r\n\r\n     EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT ON THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA—PROGRESS OF\r\n     PANAMÁ—LAWS RESPECTING SPANISH SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA—FINAL\r\n     ABANDONMENT OF ANTIGUA—ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOUTH SEA\r\n     GOVERNMENT—PIRACY UPON PRINCIPLE—PASCUAL DE ANDAGOYA EXPLORES\r\n     SOUTHWARD—CONQUERS BIRÚ—RETURN TO PANAMÁ—COLONIES OF VERAGUA\r\n     AND CHIRIQUÍ—THE CHIEFTAIN URRACÁ TAKES UP HIS ABODE IN\r\n     THE MOUNTAINS AND DEFIES THE SPANIARDS—PIZARRO, ESPINOSA,\r\n     PEDRARIAS, AND COMPAÑON IN VAIN ATTEMPT HIS OVERTHROW—BUILDING\r\n     OF NATÁ—COMPAÑON AS GOVERNOR—HURTADO COLONIZES\r\n     CHIRIQUÍ—CONSPIRACY—CAPTURE AND ESCAPE OF URRACÁ—SEVERAL YEARS\r\n     MORE OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length we find on the Pacific seaboard a European settlement, in\r\nthe aboriginal fishing-station of Panamá the germ of a Spanish city,\r\nthe first on the western side of the American continent from Patagonia\r\nto Alaska, the first on the Isthmus which remains to the present day.\r\nAnd there was much about it which the befogged but in many respects\r\nfar-seeing adventurers of the time could foretell. There was wealth\r\non this shore, but to what extent they knew not, as Peru stood yet\r\nunrevealed. Unless some strait should be found, or some narrower thread\r\nof Tierra Firme offering superior advantages, Panamá would become the\r\ngreat entrepôt of South Sea traffic; but wild as were their speculations\r\nin some respects, in others the imagination was as far behind the\r\nfacts. Even in their wildest dreams they had not seen resting on their\r\nbroad-stretching beach ships from the north and the south, and the far\r\nwestern east, laden with the wealth of half a world, and in the streets\r\nof their sun-beaten city gold and silver stacked in bricks; and spices,\r\nand precious merchandise waiting transportation over the cordillera to\r\nNombre de Dios, where cargoes of European goods in like manner waited\r\ncarriage southward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SOUTH SEA METROPOLIS.]\r\n\r\nTo the importance of this city, even at this early day, the Council of\r\nthe Indies was by no means blind; and beside the regulations[XV-1] of\r\na general nature regarding settlement and city-building which began now\r\nto be enacted, Panamá was the recipient of special royal favors.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Pedrarias, by fair means and foul, labored to\r\ndepopulate Antigua; and it was a good work, though at the time he\r\nwas not fully aware of it. Fortune had favored him in many ways of\r\nlate, and the rewards of his rascalities were truly gratifying. Not\r\nto mention the deaths of Vasco Nuñez and Lope de Sosa, the successes\r\nof Espinosa and other gold-hunting captains, or the discomfiture of\r\nGil Gonzalez, it was a fine stroke of policy making the licenciado\r\nAlarconcillo his lieutenant at Antigua; for the fraudulent residencias\r\ntaken by him, under the artful management of the governor's wife\r\nin Spain, did Pedrarias and Espinosa good service at court. Nor was\r\nthere any practical inconvenience to the governor in the royal orders\r\nprohibiting complex legal proceedings, that the truth might be simply\r\nand inexpensively arrived at in cases of dispute, and permitting appeals\r\nfrom Castilla del Oro to the audiencia of Santo Domingo; for the one\r\ngave his power a wider range, while the other could be easily regulated\r\nso as to work him no prejudice. Las Casas likewise had failed in his\r\neffort to displace Pedrarias, the privileges granted in Tierra Firme\r\nlimiting him to territory outside of the jurisdiction of this governor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABANDONMENT OF ANTIGUA.]\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of Antigua began in 1521, and was consummated in\r\nSeptember, 1524, Diego Ribero, the last survivor, being massacred\r\nwith his entire family by his own Indians, who afterward burned the\r\ntown. Thus the streets wherein had been acted so many stirring scenes\r\nwere vacant, and the country, after a struggle of fifteen years and\r\nthe loss of thousands of lives, lapsed into its original savagism.\r\nBy royal decree issued at Búrgos September 15, 1521, Panamá was\r\nmade a city, and received royal privileges and a coat of arms, in\r\nfurther ennoblement.[XV-2] The regidores should enjoy the title of\r\n_veinticuatros_, as in Seville and Córdova. For the first ten years the\r\ncity had to pay only a tithe on gold; the eleventh year, one ninth; the\r\ntwelfth, one eighth, and so on to the fifteenth when the usual fifth\r\nwould be due. Hitherto the currency consisted of pieces of gold cut into\r\nvarious weights; now silver and copper money were employed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe first regidores of Panamá were Gonzalo de Badajoz, Rodrigo Enriquez\r\nde Colmenares, Rogel de Loris, Pascual de Andagoya, Martin Estete,\r\nBenito Hurtado, Luis de la Rocha, and Francisco Gonzalez. The alcalde\r\nmayor, Hernando de Salaya, was made lieutenant of Pedrarias in Panamá,\r\nwith a salary of 150,000 maravedís, Espinosa having turned his attention\r\nalmost exclusively to military matters. The royal officers formerly\r\nat Antigua as a rule held their places in Panamá. These were Alonso\r\nde la Puente, the treasurer; Diego Marquez, the contador; Miguel\r\nJuan de Ribas, factor. To some of these Pedrarias was obliged to give\r\nrepartimientos as an inducement to move.\r\n\r\nMore difficulty was experienced in having the episcopal see transferred\r\nto Panamá, but it was finally accomplished; the royal order to move it,\r\nwith the clergy and paraphernalia of the church as well as the vecinos\r\nand the hospital, bearing date the same as the order making Panamá a\r\ncity, namely, September 15, 1521. On the death of the first bishop of\r\nDarien, Juan de Quevedo, a successor was appointed in the person of Fray\r\nVicente de Peraza. Salaya and the Archdeacon Perez came out together\r\nin 1522; Peraza came later, Salaya being commissioned to superintend\r\necclesiastical affairs until the bishop's arrival. And when he did\r\narrive he appeared in no haste to move, and was still at Antigua in\r\n1524. There, finally, Pedrarias went and exercised upon him his softest\r\nblandishments. The governor could make himself quite pleasing to one\r\nwho did not know him. The bishop had not been long in Panamá before his\r\neyes were opened, and then, indeed, forever closed; for one day, while\r\nthe bishop and the governor were at cards, they had a quarrel, during\r\nwhich the latter was treated badly with words, and soon after the bishop\r\ndied. Then with Salaya the governor employed sharp words, saying, if\r\nhe did not mind he would cut off his head. \"More than one head you have\r\nwrongfully cut off,\" Salaya retorted, \"but he who cuts off my head must\r\nhave a better head than mine, and that you have not.\" Then they were\r\nfriends again. Nevertheless Salaya died. Both these men were poisoned;\r\nsuspicion pointed to Pedrarias, though he was never formally charged\r\nwith the crime.\r\n\r\nFor the building of churches in Castilla del Oro, the king gave large\r\nalms; his annual donation to the hospital was three hundred pesos,[XV-3]\r\nwhile the royal treasury covered the cost of an organ and a clock for\r\nthe Panamá cathedral. About the time of the removal, Francisco de\r\nLizaur, procurador of the new settlement for providing the Indians\r\nas well as the Spaniards with food, procured an order requiring the\r\ngovernor to attend to planting; likewise barter must be opened with the\r\nnatives, and negro slaves were not allowed to accompany expeditions.\r\nThe boundaries of the municipality extended about forty-five leagues in\r\nevery direction from the three leagues of city lands in the centre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe natives of the New World, and they alone, were expected to support\r\nthe new city, and through Panamá to send great wealth to Spain. The\r\nobject of the Spaniards was not agriculture, except to save themselves\r\nfrom hunger; nor even mining, except as they could force the natives\r\nto dig; it was unadulterated robbery, with only the lame excuses of\r\ncivilization and Christianity, and Panamá was but a pirates' nest.\r\n\r\nBy no means the worst of the band was Pascual de Andagoya, who but for\r\nthe bad company he kept might have been pronounced an honest man. He\r\nassisted Pedrarias, and acted as the forerunner of Pizarro, but when it\r\ncame to wholesale infamies he had no zeal for them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPEDITION OF ANDAGOYA.]\r\n\r\nA faithful retainer of the governor, he was in 1522 sent by him to\r\nexplore the southern coast beyond the limits of the discovery of Vasco\r\nNuñez. Landing at the gulf of San Miguel, Andagoya visited a province\r\ncalled Chochama, where he was informed that during the periods of the\r\nfull moon, a fierce people infested its shore, driving the inhabitants\r\nfrom their fisheries, slaying them if they resisted, and spreading\r\nterror generally. This people came from a province called Birú, which\r\nname was corrupted by the Spaniards into Pirú, and finally into the\r\nPeru of Francisco Pizarro. Chochama begged Andagoya to protect his\r\nsubjects from this scourge, and having obtained reinforcements from\r\nPanamá, Andagoya set out in company with his host and his warriors for\r\nthe dreaded region. Ascending a large river for twenty leagues, the\r\nSpaniards found a number of villages and caciques, and on the outskirts\r\nof the province, near the junction of two rivers, they discovered a\r\nstrong native fortress, well garrisoned, which on being attacked was\r\ndefended with skill and bravery. But superior tactics soon prevailed,\r\nand after a struggle the stronghold was reduced and the inmates were\r\nbrought to terms.\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of Birú being thus effected, Andagoya continued\r\nhis voyage, the ships keeping well off shore, while the commander\r\nreconnoitred the coast in canoes navigated by friendly Indians. It\r\nhappened one day, while thus employed, that his boat was caught in\r\nthe surf and overturned. He was saved by the brave efforts of one of\r\nthe natives whose cause he had espoused; but a rheumatic fever which\r\nfollowed determined him to abandon the discovery, and on the following\r\nday he turned his face toward Panamá, where he arrived in safety with\r\na few captives.[XV-4]\r\n\r\nPermission was then given to Juan Basurto to continue the discovery of\r\nAndagoya; but his sudden death cut short the preparations, and there\r\nthe matter rested until taken up by Francisco Pizarro.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRAVERY OF URRACÁ.]\r\n\r\nLeaving for the moment affairs to the southward, let us return to the\r\nwestern side of Panamá Bay. There was a cacique named Urracá, whom the\r\nSpaniards sought to kill, whose domain was the sierra of Veragua, and\r\nwhose crime was the love of liberty. Indeed so villainously depraved was\r\nthis savage that he would not accept Spanish salvation and domination\r\nwhen offered him in return for his gold; he even thought to kill the\r\ngood men who invaded his territory to kill him. Urracá was fierce and\r\nstrong; his mountains were rugged, and his home almost inaccessible\r\nto the hostile invader. Therefore he must be approached with caution,\r\nand his capture intrusted only to picked men. As he was reported rich,\r\nand worth the trouble, two companies were fitted out against him, one\r\nby water under Espinosa, and one by land under Francisco Pizarro. The\r\nformer embarked at Panamá in two vessels, and, after touching at the\r\nisland of Cebaco, passed over to the mainland of Veragua and began his\r\nmarch on the redoubtable mountaineer. Urracá was not afraid of him,\r\nand after placing the women, the children, and the aged of his people\r\nin safety, with his warriors he marched boldly out against the enemy.\r\nHe first encountered the Indian vanguard of Espinosa, and falling on\r\nthem slew them to a man. Then he fiercely attacked the horsemen, of\r\nwhom there were two or three, and the foot-soldiers, fighting with such\r\ndetermination that but for Hernando de Soto, who with thirty men had\r\nbeen sent forward by Pizarro to seek a pass, the licentiate would have\r\nbeen cut to pieces. Pizarro, who was near at hand, had not reached the\r\nplace without hard fighting. And now Urracá defied them all. With every\r\nadvantage of a rugged and well-known country on his side, he rallied his\r\nmen and attacked the combined force with such desperate energy that when\r\nnight came the Spaniards endeavored to withdraw secretly to the open\r\nplain. To this Urracá objected. He permitted them to break up camp, it\r\nis true, and to begin their march; but, when within the darkest pass,\r\nhe was on them again like a trap, and from the black craggy defile they\r\ncould not move, except against the lances and war-clubs that hemmed\r\nthem in. With morning the question faced them, whether they should die\r\nthere or escape? And thus the captains placed the matter before the men.\r\nSummoning all their strength, they threw their united force against the\r\nliving obstructions at the opening toward the sea, and, treading down\r\nthe enemy, escaped to their ships, and spreading sail directed their\r\ncourse toward Panamá. But it would not do to return empty-handed. So\r\nlanding at Borrica they plundered the town, and took the inhabitants\r\ncaptive, though the licentiate finally released the women. While\r\nEspinosa with the main body of his troops proceeded to Natá, Francisco\r\nCompañon with fifty men surprised by night a peaceful village in the\r\nneighborhood. It was palisaded, and the Spaniards were repulsed. Hiding\r\nthemselves, they waited until the inhabitants had come forth in the\r\nmorning, and had scattered themselves about the fields. At a signal they\r\nsprang upon them. The poor natives ran for shelter from the merciless\r\nsteel, and arriving at the gateway in a body they so blocked it as to\r\nbe easily butchered. Those not killed were carried captives to Natá.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATÁ AND CHIRIQUÍ.]\r\n\r\nThe native village of Natá was situated on an open plain, most\r\nbeautiful, with a fertile soil and wholesome air. We have seen how\r\non former occasions it had attracted the attention of the Spaniards.\r\nThey had long desired to found there a settlement, and, the present\r\nexpedition having proved a failure, Espinosa sent messengers to\r\nPedrarias asking permission to remain and form a colony. The governor\r\nacquiesced, but ordered Espinosa with the ships to Panamá, leaving at\r\nNatá only fifty men under Compañon.\r\n\r\nThe new seaport lay nearer to Urracá than the island of Cebaco, although\r\nEspinosa began his march against this province at a point on Azuero\r\nPeninsula, opposite the island, more than thirty leagues from Natá, by\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIt was near enough, at all events, for the wary Urracá to follow the\r\nSpaniards with his vindictive eye. The chieftain, by his emissaries,\r\nknew when Espinosa landed there, what he and the others did, when they\r\nwent away, and how many remained. Peeping in on Compañon he thought\r\nhe could manage fifty men. He would try it. Collecting his forces he\r\nmade preparations to attack the Spaniards by night. On approaching\r\ntheir quarters he came to a house at some distance from the others, in\r\nwhich three men were sleeping. One of them the savages killed with a\r\nspear; one they captured; the third eluded them until he had secured\r\nhis arms, when he sprang up and shouted as if to some companions near.\r\nSingle-handed he then attacked them and put them to flight; after which\r\nhe released his captive comrade, and the two sought their commander.\r\nCompañon immediately sent messengers to Pedrarias, informing him of the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIt was not praiseworthy on the part of Urracá to allow his multitude of\r\nbrave warriors to be defeated by a single Spaniard; probably he never\r\nknew how easily he was beaten; and now confederating with his neighbors\r\nhe confined the Spaniards so closely in their quarters that they began\r\nto suffer for food. The opportune arrival of Hernando Ponce de Leon\r\nwith forty men, and shortly afterward of the governor himself with one\r\nhundred and fifty men, placed Compañon at ease again.\r\n\r\nIt is true; the old governor is in the field again! War, at home or\r\nabroad, is his natural element. This bold mountain chieftain must be\r\nput down; and who so fitting to do it, who so capable, as the governor?\r\nAppointing Francisco Pizarro as second in command, with his entire\r\navailable force, among which are some horses and small cannon, Pedrarias\r\nsallies forth.\r\n\r\nUrracá is ready to receive him. He has joined forces with a neighbor\r\nnamed Exquegua, and awaits the Spanish governor just beyond the\r\nstrongest pass. He hopes a second time to entangle the enemy amongst the\r\ncraggy steeps to him so familiar. The fox enters the trap. The governor\r\nmust choose either to fight at great disadvantage, or retire and leave\r\nthe country to its aboriginal lord. Urracá is powerful, sagacious, and\r\nbrave. Occupying in his retreat the most elevated part of the cordillera\r\nwhere it cuts Veragua, and being about midway between the two oceans, he\r\ncan draw supplies and reinforcements from either side. So pernicious is\r\nthe influence he exerts that he can prevent the pacification of western\r\nCastilla del Oro: hence the importance of his extermination.\r\n\r\nThe old governor harangues his army. After the stale fashion of Xerxes\r\nand the Scipios he sneers at the enemy, and praises his own men. It is\r\nnot common to hear Pedrarias praise any one. \"You see the necessity\r\nof this chieftain's death,\" he concludes; \"let it never be said of\r\nSpaniards that they left alive a rich heathen.\" A charge is then\r\nordered. The battle lasts till nightfall. It is renewed the next day\r\nand the day following. Before such unparalleled obstinacy the Spaniards\r\ngrow faint. Even the fire-belching cannon, with its reverberating\r\nroar and its balls sweeping down men, splitting rocks and trees, and\r\ntearing up the earth, confounds them but for a moment. For five days\r\nthe engagement continues, much of the time in a desultory manner, the\r\nSpaniards fighting from under cover like the Indians.\r\n\r\nUrracá at length resorts to stratagem. Withdrawing his forces as if\r\nin abandonment of the fight, he retires toward the river Atra, the\r\nrendezvous of the confederates from both sides of the cordillera.\r\nPedrarias follows, thinking in some open spot to scatter the foe and\r\nkill them. Seeing which, Urracá calls to him several wise warriors, and\r\ninstructs them to play the part of men of the country, and when captured\r\nby the Spaniards to direct them to their ruin. Through this ruse Diego\r\nde Albites falls into ambush, at one time with forty men, at another\r\nwith sixty, narrowly escaping destruction.\r\n\r\nDetermined never to abandon the country until his purpose is\r\naccomplished, Pedrarias sends out parties against the villages of the\r\nconfederates individually. Two caciques, Bulaba and Musa, are captured,\r\nbut on accepting terms of peace are set at liberty. Urracá avoids\r\nanother general engagement, and Pedrarias returns to Natá. The lands and\r\ncaptives are divided among such soldiers as are willing to remain as\r\ncolonists under Diego de Albites, who is left there as the governor's\r\nlieutenant. Sixty elect to remain, who begin to build and plant. Thus\r\nis established the town and settlement suggested by Espinosa, which\r\nis called Natá after the cacique, and which name it still retains, and\r\nnext after Panamá on the Pacific seaboard, Natá assumes importance as\r\na Spanish settlement.\r\n\r\nAll the same it is exceedingly hard on the poor aboriginal, drudgery or\r\ndeath. Those enslaved under the fatherly-protection system endeavor by\r\nevery means to escape; failing in which, if they do not kill themselves,\r\nthey soon die from hard treatment. Urracá never ceases narrowly to watch\r\nthe Spaniards, attacking them as opportunity offers. Albites retaliates\r\nwith frequent incursions; but unable to overthrow Urracá he finally\r\nmakes peace with him. This displeases Pedrarias, who thereupon recalls\r\nAlbites and appoints Francisco Compañon governor of Natá. Under the new\r\nregime hostilities are yet more vigorously pressed, but in almost every\r\ninstance to the discomfiture of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeyond the domain of Urracá, toward the west, in Veragua, was the\r\nprovince of Chiriquí. Thither Pedrarias sent Benito Hurtado to establish\r\na colony. The country being thinly populated was easily taken and\r\nheld. Indeed, the caciques of Chiriquí, Vareclas, and Burica, the\r\nchief rulers within an area of one hundred leagues, obeyed without\r\nresistance, and for two years the colony of Chiriquí was unmolested.\r\nBut the more submissive the people, the more exacting the conquering\r\nrace. The crushing weight of servitude becoming unbearable, the men of\r\nChiriquí at length rose to arms. They were joined in a general revolt\r\nby Urracá. Unable to vanquish this chieftain, Compañon determined to\r\ncapture him by fair means or foul. Overtures were begun by presents\r\nand fair promises, and at length, under the most solemn assurances of\r\nliberty and safety, Urracá was induced to visit the governor at Natá.\r\nNo sooner had he entered the town than he was seized and ironed. I am\r\ndisposed to praise the perfidious Compañon for not burning his captive,\r\nor giving him to the dogs; he only sent him, in violation of his sacred\r\npledge, a prisoner to Nombre de Dios, with the intention of shipping\r\nhim off to Spain. Before the sailing of a ship, however, the brave\r\ncacique managed to burst his fetters and escape. Breathing vengeance he\r\nroused the mountains, organized a yet more powerful confederation, and\r\nmarched against Natá. Long and bloody warfare ensued, with alternate\r\nsuccess. One of the most disastrous conflicts occurred early in 1527,\r\nin an expedition against a rebel chief named Trota, under Captain\r\nAlonso de Vargas, with forty soldiers, principally men newly arrived\r\nfrom Spain. The protestations of some of Trota's adherents, who entered\r\nthe camp with humble mien but active eyes, induced the captain, at the\r\nrecommendation of a veteran comrade, to send Pocoa, an allied chief\r\nand guide, with offers of peace. The fellow was no sooner out of sight\r\nthan he cast the olive branch to the winds, and joining cause with\r\nTrota, advised him to seize so advantageous an opportunity for glory\r\nand revenge, when the force before him was weak and inexperienced and\r\nthe commander ailing. Four days later five hundred warriors fell upon\r\nthe camp, led by Pocoa in a glittering breastplate of gold. Although\r\ntaken by surprise, the soldiers fought desperately, but the numbers were\r\noverwhelming, and Vargas succumbed with half his men. This blow was one\r\nmore incentive for the Spaniards to exert themselves in retaliation and\r\nconquest. The country adjacent to the settlement being open and level,\r\nhorses and cannon could be used with advantage; while on the other hand,\r\nto make up for lack of skill, were numbers, drawn from a great distance\r\naround, with the protecting mountains in which to nurse declining\r\nenergies. Thus for nine years the war continued, until the chieftain\r\nUrracá, yielded up his life, though not, after all, to arquebuse or\r\nbloodhound: he died in bed, among his own people, but lamenting, with\r\nthe last breath, his inability to drive out the detested Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WARS OF THE SPANIARDS.\r\n\r\n1523-1524.\r\n\r\n     OVIEDO IN SPAIN—HE SECURES THE APPOINTMENT OF PEDRO DE LOS\r\n     RIOS AS GOVERNOR OF CASTILLA DEL ORO—PEDRARIAS DETERMINES\r\n     TO POSSESS NICARAGUA—HE SENDS THITHER CÓRDOBA, WHO FOUNDS\r\n     BRUSÉLAS, GRANADA, AND LEON—AND CARRIES A SHIP ACROSS THE\r\n     LAND FROM THE PACIFIC TO LAKE NICARAGUA—HE MAKES A SURVEY OF\r\n     THE LAKE—INFORMED OF SPANIARDS LURKING THEREABOUT—DEVELOPMENT\r\n     OF THE SPANISH COLONIAL SYSTEM—GIL GONZALEZ ESCAPES WITH\r\n     HIS TREASURE TO ESPAÑOLA—DESPATCHES CERECEDA TO SPAIN WITH\r\n     INTELLIGENCE OF HIS DISCOVERY—SAILS FROM SANTO DOMINGO TO THE\r\n     COAST OF HONDURAS—ARRIVES AT PUERTO CABALLOS—FOUNDS SAN GIL\r\n     DE BUENAVISTA—ENCOUNTERS HERNANDO DE SOTO—BATTLE—CRISTÓBAL DE\r\n     OLID APPEARS—FOUNDS TRIUNFO DE LA CRUZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely were the fair provinces of the Southern Sea brought under\r\nthe yoke of the Spaniards, when the conquerors began contending among\r\nthemselves. For it must be confessed that neither their culture nor\r\ntheir religion prevented them from behaving very much like the wild\r\nbeasts and the wild men to whom they regarded themselves superior.\r\nIn following these disputes we will now accompany, in a second visit\r\nto Spain, the author and veedor, and withal the maker of governors,\r\nFernandez de Oviedo, whom we left in July, 1523, fleeing the wrath of\r\nPedrarias.\r\n\r\nAt Cuba the veedor was entertained by Diego Velazquez, the governor;\r\nat Española he was invited by Diego Colon to take passage with him for\r\nSeville, where he arrived in November. After presenting himself to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, at Búrgos, he went to Vitoria, where the court\r\nwas residing. Vested with full power to act for the city of Antigua,\r\nOviedo set forth the affairs of the colony, entered his complaints\r\nagainst Pedrarias, and urged the appointment of a new governor. In this\r\nmeasure he was opposed by the bachiller Corral, whom he had made an\r\neffort to send in chains to Spain, and by Isabel, wife of Pedrarias.\r\nThrough their influence he was involved in litigation which lasted\r\ntwo years; and for his treatment of the bachiller he was fined one\r\nhundred thousand maravedís, which he was obliged to pay. But in the\r\nend the veedor triumphed in displacing Pedrarias, and in securing the\r\nappointment of Pedro de los Rios, of Córdova, as governor of Castilla\r\ndel Oro, and of the licenciado Juan de Salmeron as alcalde mayor and\r\njudge of residencia.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of speedy displacement in office, no less than the success\r\nof Gil Gonzalez at the freshwater sea, determined Pedrarias to secure\r\na footing in Nicaragua before the arrival of the new governor of\r\nCastilla del Oro. No one knew better than himself that by the customs\r\nof discovery and occupation, which were now fast becoming laws, he\r\nhad not the slightest right there, having neither contributed to the\r\ndiscovery of Gil Gonzalez, nor even sanctioned it. As an act preliminary\r\nto taking possession of this discovery, Pedrarias despatched thither\r\nhis lieutenant, Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba—not he who discovered\r\nYucatan, though of the same name—and captains Gabriel de Rojas,\r\nFrancisco Compañon, and Hernando de Soto, who embarked from Panamá in\r\n1524.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CÓRDOBA IN NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\nLanding at the gulf of Nicoya Córdoba founded a settlement at Urutina,\r\non the east side, which he called Brusélas, but which existed only three\r\nyears, being dismantled by order of Diego Lopez Salcedo in 1527. Thence\r\nCórdoba proceeded northward thirty leagues, to Nequecheri, on the shore\r\nof Lake Nicaragua, where he founded a city to which he gave the name\r\nGranada, building there a fortress and a church. In the province of\r\nNagrando[XVI-1] he established another city which he called Leon. While\r\nat Granada Córdoba drew one of his brigantines ashore, and taking it\r\napart conveyed the pieces overland to Nicaragua Lake. After rebuilding\r\nhe made a circuit round the shore of the Freshwater Sea, and discovered\r\nits outlet in the Rio San Juan, though he did not descend the stream,\r\non account of the rocks and rapids. With this leader had come many\r\nfriars and religious men, some of whom were quite expert in performing\r\nmiracles, and by this means was excited among the natives a furor for\r\nbaptism scarcely inferior to the lively manifestation under the swift\r\ninstructions of Captain Gil Gonzalez. Córdoba sent Pedrarias a full\r\naccount of his proceedings thus far. He also informed him that a band of\r\nSpaniards was lurking thereabout, though as yet he had not encountered\r\nthem, but he had sent Hernando de Soto to learn who they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPANISH COLONIAL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nThe colonial system of Spain as it unfolded in the New World seemed at\r\nthis time to assume the form of a political tripod whose three props\r\nwere the subjugator, the sovereign, and the executive vicegerent, each\r\ncontributing to the support of the others, though in a manner oppugnant\r\nand contradictory. It was something wholly new in the polities of\r\nnations for royalty thus to delegate so much and so varied power at\r\nsuch a distance; and royalty was troubled for itself in consequence,\r\nand regarded with jealousy and mistrust such of its servants as it\r\nwas obliged to confide in. Ashamed of his suspicions, the sovereign\r\nattempted to cover them by the application of chicane to a system of\r\nbalancing, placing one agent to watch another, and counteracting the\r\npower of one deputy by the power of another deputy. The discoverer\r\non returning from his perilous voyage must wear away the remainder\r\nof his life importuning for the promised recompense; and often he was\r\ncompelled to lose beside his services the costs advanced by himself.\r\nThe conqueror must be frowned upon in the moment of his triumph, lest\r\nhe should forget himself, or rather forget his master. He, without\r\nwhose adventurings the monarch's realm could scarcely find enlargement,\r\nmust immediately on the attainment of new territory be diverted by the\r\nintrusion of some professional governor, who between law, selfishness,\r\nand despotism usually managed to defeat the aims of both king and\r\nconqueror, and attain his own end in ruin and disgrace. Thus it was on\r\nEspañola, and thus it is again on Tierra Firme. Had Columbus been less\r\nincompetent as the beginner in this colonization, and as governor; had\r\nhe with wise statesmanship founded one New World colony on firm and\r\nliberal principles, the whole Spanish-American colonial system during\r\nthe following three centuries might have been something quite different.\r\nHad the monarch found on trial that his deputies were trustworthy, he\r\nwould have trusted them. Had he not, they would have compelled him. As\r\nit was they compelled him to treat them as unreliable and unjust, as\r\nindeed they were, that is to say such of them as were competent. While\r\nthe monarch was far less blamable than his representatives, while as\r\na rule he sought with honest and pious purpose the best welfare of his\r\nsubjects, civilized and savage, it seemed his fate thus far to keep the\r\ncolonies always in a ferment, every man's hand against his neighbor, and\r\nunder such poisonous and perverting stimulus, that the vilest elements\r\nattained success, while the noblest were consumed to cinders. Witness\r\nChristopher Columbus and Bartolomé his brother as against Bobadilla\r\nand Ovando; Vasco Nuñez beside Pedrarias; and now Pedrarias and Gil\r\nGonzalez.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GIL GONZALEZ AGAIN.]\r\n\r\nUpon the return to Panamá in June, 1523, of Andrés Niño and Gil\r\nGonzalez, from their discovery of Nicaragua, Pedrarias undertook, as\r\nwe have seen, at once to secure for himself every benefit of their\r\nadventure. And this without a shadow of right or reason. The pilot\r\nand the contador had acted under authority direct from the king; they\r\nhad imperilled their lives and had exhausted their private fortunes;\r\nwhile the governor had not only contributed nothing, but actually\r\ndisobeyed the king in refusing to deliver the ships of Vasco Nuñez, and\r\nin withholding men and means for the expedition. A grand achievement\r\nhad been consummated by a handful of men, poorly equipped and in small\r\nunseaworthy vessels, whose consequent sufferings were in a measure\r\ncaused by the inherent wickedness of the governor, now the first of all\r\nto clutch at the gold. He would have the honor of paying the king's\r\nfifth into the royal treasury, for he could make it advantageous for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nGil Gonzalez would cheerfully have turned over the treasure to\r\nthe king's officers, for his blood was up, and he wished to return\r\nimmediately and chastise the impudent caciques, Diriangen and Nicaragua.\r\nBut, when under his letters patent he demanded aid for that purpose, the\r\ngovernor promised it only on condition that he went as his lieutenant,\r\nand that the war should be conducted in his name. This the contador\r\nrefused to do. Pedrarias then said that he would undertake the further\r\npacification of Nicaragua on his own account, and plant a colony,\r\nperhaps, at the gulf of Fonseca; that a southern expedition which he\r\nhad planned would be directed north, in view of the superior attractions\r\nappearing in the reports of the late discoveries. Upon this Gil Gonzalez\r\ndetermined to hasten from Panamá with the king's gold, which had been\r\nmelted down by the assayer, and lay the matter before the audiencia at\r\nSanto Domingo, thence going to Spain if necessary.\r\n\r\nThere was a caravel lying at Nombre de Dios, which Gil Gonzalez\r\npurchased for one thousand castellanos, and stealing from Panamá he\r\nescaped with the gold, and set sail for Española just as Pedrarias in\r\nhot pursuit appeared upon the shore with a requisition and order of\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nThe royal authorities at Santo Domingo listened with favor to their\r\nformer contador; on comparing his actions with his instructions\r\nthey found that he had acquitted himself creditably. They deemed it\r\nunnecessary for him to go to Spain, and thought he could better serve\r\nthe king by continuing his important discovery. He might proceed at\r\nonce to the eastern shore of Tierra Firme, and search for the strait\r\ncommunicating with the Freshwater Sea, or its outlet, which was sure\r\nto exist; or, failing in that, enter the territory, pass over to the\r\nFreshwater Sea by land, found there a colony and build a town. To this\r\nend the audiencia promised to aid him in raising three hundred men and\r\nfifty horses, which, with the ship he had brought from Nombre de Dios,\r\nwould give him a fair equipment. Distributing, therefore, the royal\r\nshare of the treasure[XVI-2] among five ships lying at Santo Domingo,\r\naccording to the royal regulations, Gil Gonzalez despatched by Antonio\r\nde Cereceda, treasurer of the Nicaraguan expedition, the famous letter\r\nwhich I have so frequently quoted, and a map of the coast from Panamá\r\nto the Gulf of Fonseca, made with great care by the pilots of the\r\nexpedition. In this letter, after giving an account of the discovery\r\nand presenting his plans, the writer begs the sovereign that his pay\r\nas captain be made over to his wife at Seville, for the support and\r\neducation of his children; that the limits of his discovery may speedily\r\nbe defined, and other conquerors and rulers forbidden to intrude; that\r\nletters patent may be granted him with the title of Admiral of the\r\nFreshwater Sea, together with a tenth of the king's revenue within the\r\nterritory. Were it not that his majesty might deem it a desire on the\r\npart of the discoverer to call attention to himself he could tell much\r\nmore; but this he would say of five things done by him, namely—no other\r\nSpaniard ever before discovered so many leagues on foot with so few men\r\nso poorly equipped; no man ever converted so many souls to Christ in so\r\nshort a time; no discoverer as yet had brought so much gold; none had\r\nfought so many Indians without the loss of a man; and, finally, no one\r\nbefore him had ever returned from a voyage of discovery without having\r\nlost to the adventurers the cost of the outfit. Cereceda and the letter\r\nwere graciously received by the emperor, who ordered Gil Gonzalez to\r\ncontinue his discoveries.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADMIRAL OF THE FRESHWATER SEA.]\r\n\r\nBut without waiting instructions from Spain Gil Gonzalez had hastened to\r\noccupy what he had discovered, before others should arrive to dispute\r\npossession with him. He sailed from Santo Domingo in the spring of\r\n1524[XVI-3] for the eastern coast of Nicaragua, intending to cross to\r\nthe Freshwater Sea, by way of its outlet, and thereby avoid collision\r\nwith the governor at Panamá; but he steered too far to the right, and\r\nstruck the continent on the north side of Honduras, about twenty leagues\r\neast of Golfo Dulce. Obliged by a storm to throw overboard some horses\r\nto save his ship, he gave the name of Caballos[XVI-4] to the port from\r\nwhich he had under the circumstances to turn away. From this point he\r\nwas driven by the wind westward to Golfo Dulce. Finding himself in a\r\nstrange mountainous country, and at a loss whither to proceed, he deemed\r\nit safe in any event to take possession and plant there a colony, and\r\nto this he gave the name San Gil de Buenavista. Leaving there a portion\r\nof his men he coasted eastward, to a point between capes Honduras and\r\nCamarones, and although still far from his destination he disembarked\r\nthe troops and marched southward in search of his Freshwater Sea.\r\n\r\nContinuing on this course Gil Gonzalez in due time approached the\r\nterritory of Nicaragua, but only to encounter Hernando de Soto, sent\r\nby Córdoba to ascertain who were the rival settlers. Gil Gonzalez first\r\nlearned of the presence of Córdoba in that quarter while passing through\r\nthe valley of Olancho. There was but one way to settle rival claims\r\nunder such circumstances, the old brutal way, practised by both savage\r\nand civilized from the beginning, and in vogue to-day among our most\r\nChristian and cultured nations—the weaker must give way to the stronger.\r\n\r\nThe two companies met at a place called Toreba. The savage method of\r\nwarfare was adopted. Just before dawn, as Soto lay wrapped in slumber,\r\nGil Gonzalez, with a portion only of his command, crept into the enemy's\r\ncamp, and raising the war-cry, \"San Gil! kill the traitors!\" began\r\na furious onslaught upon his countrymen. Soto commanded the superior\r\nforce, and although taken at a disadvantage he was soon disputing for\r\nthe victory with every prospect of success. The engagement lasted some\r\ntime, and several Spaniards on both sides were killed. At length Gil\r\nGonzalez, fearing defeat, cried out, \"Peace! peace, Señor capitan,\r\nin the emperor's name!\" And although Soto was urged by his associates\r\nto follow up the advantage, he ceased hostilities and prepared for an\r\namicable adjustment of differences.\r\n\r\nThus matters remained for several days. But Gil Gonzalez had no\r\nintention of abandoning the field, as his actions and words implied. He\r\nonly wished to gain time and bring up the remainder of his force. This\r\neffected, he again suddenly sprang upon the enemy, and after a short\r\nbut severe engagement drove him from the field, securing his treasure,\r\nto the value of one hundred and thirty thousand castellanos.[XVI-5]\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this success, and unprepared to meet a superior force\r\nunder Córdoba, Gil Gonzalez disarmed the enemy, and retired to Puerto\r\nCaballos, where he was informed that a fleet had arrived from Mexico in\r\ncommand of Cristóbal de Olid, one of the captains of Hernan Cortés.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Soto, Córdoba took measures to strengthen his\r\nposition at Leon, building there a strong fortress. Cristóbal de Olid,\r\nof whom I shall speak presently, founded a settlement on the north\r\ncoast of Honduras, fourteen leagues east of Puerto Caballos, to which\r\nhe gave the name of Triunfo de la Cruz.[XVI-6] Thus for the territory\r\nnow embraced within the boundaries of Nicaragua and Honduras, there\r\nappeared three claimants—Gil Gonzalez, who, under the auspices of the\r\ncrown, claimed for himself as the discoverer; Francisco Hernandez de\r\nCórdoba, who claimed for Pedrarias; and Cristóbal de Olid, who claimed\r\nfor Cortés and himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOLONIZATION IN HONDURAS.\r\n\r\n1524-1525.\r\n\r\n     CORTÉS IN MEXICO—EXTENSION OF HIS CONQUESTS—FEARS\r\n     OF ENCROACHMENTS ON THE PART OF SPANIARDS IN CENTRAL\r\n     AMERICA—CRISTÓBAL DE OLID SENT TO HONDURAS—TOUCHING AT\r\n     HABANA, HE IS WON FROM ALLEGIANCE TO CORTÉS—TRIUNFO DE LA\r\n     CRUZ FOUNDED—OLID AS TRAITOR—MEETING WITH GIL GONZALEZ—THE\r\n     WRATH OF CORTÉS—CASAS SENT AFTER OLID—NAVAL ENGAGEMENT IN\r\n     TRIUNFO HARBOR—CASAS FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF OLID, WHO IS\r\n     SOON CAPTURED BY THE CAPTIVE—DEATH OF OLID—RETURN OF CASAS\r\n     TO MEXICO—TRUJILLO FOUNDED—INTERFERENCE OF THE AUDIENCIA OF\r\n     SANTO DOMINGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile certain of the Spaniards were settling themselves in possession of\r\nthe Isthmus and parts of Central America, others were engaged in like\r\nmanner elsewhere. Among the latter was Hernan Cortés, who sailed from\r\nCuba, in 1519, for the conquest of Mexico, which was accomplished in\r\n1521. So great was the glory of this achievement, complete details of\r\nwhich will be given in a later volume of this work, that fresh hordes\r\nflocked to the banner of its hero, whose further efforts toward conquest\r\nin different directions were little more than triumphal marches.\r\nOn nearly every side his captains found rich provinces and populous\r\nsettlements which promised flattering rewards in tributes, plantations,\r\nand submissive slaves; or their ears were filled with reports of\r\nstill greater cities, still richer territories, further on. From such\r\nsubstance rumor blew its gaudy bubbles, which danced in iridescent hues\r\nand ever increasing size before the eyes of the conquerors, luring them\r\non into the depths of mysterious regions beyond. Insatiate, a world\r\napiece would scarcely satisfy them now.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OUTLOOK FROM MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nOf the several points toward which expeditions were sent out from the\r\nMexican capital by its conqueror, the southern regions seemed in some\r\nrespects the most alluring. Information came to Cortés of the high\r\nculture of the inhabitants in that quarter, of their manifold wealth,\r\ntheir palaces and great cities, all magnified by mystery and distance.\r\nFurther than this, the possibility, nay, the certainty that Spaniards\r\nmoving northward from the Panamá region would soon be in possession\r\nthere if not forestalled, made delay seem dangerous. Hence it was that\r\nOajaca and Chiapas were quickly made to open their portals; and now\r\nthe redoubtable Pedro de Alvarado, second only to Cortés himself, was\r\nentering Tehuantepec to rend the veil which enfolded the Quiché kingdom,\r\nand to disclose the splendor of Utatlan.\r\n\r\nLikewise the northern seaboard to the south of Yucatan claimed\r\nattention. This could scarcely now be called an undiscovered country,\r\nfor Spaniards as well as natives poured into the conqueror's ears the\r\nsure truth of what might be expected. There were pilots whose course\r\nhad led them along the coast of Hibueras, or Honduras,[XVII-1] and who\r\ncharmed their hearers with tales of gold so abundant that fishermen used\r\nnuggets for sinkers. In this there was nothing startling to Cortés,\r\nhowever, for since his first entry into Mexico he had received such\r\ninformation touching this Honduras country, particularly two provinces,\r\nthat were but one third true, \"they would far exceed Mexico in wealth,\r\nand equal her in the size of towns, in the number of inhabitants, and\r\nin culture.\"[XVII-2]\r\n\r\nThese reports could not be disregarded. An expedition to this region\r\nwould also be able to meet that of Alvarado, and crowned with success\r\nthe two could then carry conquest onward, till sullen ocean, east, and\r\nwest, and south, alone might bar the progress of their arms. Great would\r\nbe also the reward in wealth and souls. Another wish, the discovery of\r\na strait, ruled Cortés with equal strength. It was now known how short\r\na distance lay between the two oceans, and this long narrow strip of\r\nintervening land might in some one of its many inlets hide the passage,\r\nthough it was toward the north that the conquistador looked chiefly\r\nfor it. The subject had been specially commended to him by the emperor.\r\n\"Knowing the desire of your Majesty,\" writes Cortés, \"to discover the\r\nsecret of this strait, and the great benefit which your royal crown will\r\nderive therefrom, I shall leave all other interests and gains to follow\r\nthis course.\"[XVII-3] As an earnest of his intention Cortés had begun to\r\nbuild vessels at Zacatula, on the South Sea, as early as 1522, and with\r\nthese he would explore the coast northward till the passage was found,\r\nor proved not to exist. In the North Sea also fleets were prepared to\r\ncoast northward to Newfoundland, and southward to the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe expeditions were all delayed, the first by conflagration, the others\r\nby incidents at Pánuco which for a time diverted all available forces.\r\nThe latter difficulty over, Cortés reverted to his pet project, and\r\nthe Atlantic fleet, which had been for several months at considerable\r\nexpense waiting orders for sailing south, was now reinforced to muster\r\nsix vessels fully equipped, with nearly four hundred Spaniards and\r\nthirty horses.[XVII-4]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo important an expedition called for a lieutenant not only brave and\r\nable, but trustworthy. Amongst the three or four thus esteemed by the\r\ngreat conqueror was Cristóbal de Olid,[XVII-5] before mentioned, who,\r\nowing to his prominent position under Governor Velazquez of Cuba, had\r\nbeen appointed captain under Cortés when he set out for the subjugation\r\nof Montezuma's empire. His devotion, courage, and ability had made\r\nhim a favorite, and at the fall of Mexico he had been rewarded with an\r\nample share of the treasures and encomiendas. While lacking in sincerity\r\nand depth of thought, and being less fit for the council, he possessed\r\nqualities which made him an admirable executive officer. He was at this\r\ntime about thirty-seven, of powerful physique and stentorian voice,\r\nwhich contributed not a little to his success as a leader.[XVII-6]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the old campaigners, but lately ensconced in snug plantations\r\nwhere they were enjoying a post-bellum repose, were called to aid Olid.\r\nThis they did, though not always consenting with cheerful faces. Among\r\nthe number was Captain Briones, a turbulent fellow, who had brought some\r\nscars from the wars in Italy, and, after airing his profane vocabulary\r\nas commander of brigantines during the siege of Mexico, had nursed a\r\nhatred against Cortés for services that he fancied to have been ill\r\npaid.[XVII-7] Two priests were added to the expedition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPARTURE OF OLID.]\r\n\r\nOlid was instructed to direct his course to Cape Hibueras, and after\r\nfounding a fortified settlement to despatch the three largest vessels\r\nto Cuba for supplies, while the three smaller, under command of Hurtado\r\nde Mendoza, the cousin of Cortés, were to search for a strait as far as\r\nDarien, exploring first the gulf thereabout, that is the Bahía de la\r\nAscension, as the instructions read, from which \"many pilots believe\r\na strait to lead into the other sea.\" The fleet left San Juan de\r\nChalchiuhcuecan, the present Vera Cruz, January 11, 1524, for Habana,\r\nwhere an agent of Cortés was then purchasing additional arms, horses,\r\nand stores for Olid.[XVII-8]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet traitors beware of treachery. Cortés had been untrue to Governor\r\nVelazquez: by what law of compensation could he expect subordinates\r\nto be true to him? Scarcely was the fleet adrift before Briones was\r\nwhispering his commander treason. And when on landing at Habana the\r\nCuban governor, with all the hatred of foiled ambition, joined the foes\r\nof Cortés to work upon the fidelity of his captain, Olid was shaken.\r\n\"Mexico by right is mine,\" argued the governor. \"It is I who am your\r\nrightful chief, and I absolve you from the miscreant you follow. Strike\r\nout from him, as did he from me; I will furnish men and money, and the\r\nking shall know of your conduct and reward it.\"[XVII-9]\r\n\r\nEre the fleet left Cuba Olid had decided on his course. He had learned\r\nprudence, however, under his wily chief, and resolved to do nothing\r\ndecisive, until he found himself strong enough, and had learned whether\r\nthe country was worth the risk.[XVII-10] On landing, therefore, some\r\nfourteen leagues east of Caballos, the 3d of May, he not only took\r\npossession in the name of Cortés, but appointed the officials named by\r\nhim. The papers of possession, however, bore Olid's name.[XVII-11] To\r\nthe town here founded was given the name of Triunfo de la Cruz, from\r\nthe day of landing.[XVII-12]\r\n\r\nOlid was not long in openly declaring his intentions. Most of his\r\ncompany acquiesced; a few did not. These latter to the number of three\r\nscore, under an officer named Valenzuela, after robbing the town during\r\nthe absence of the men in the interior, seized one of the vessels\r\nand set sail for Mexico, but only to meet shipwreck and starvation at\r\nCozumel Island.[XVII-13] All thoughts of searching for a strait had\r\nbeen abandoned, and Olid determined to hasten forward, make himself\r\nacquainted with the country, and secure possession. It was not many\r\ndays before he came upon the bands of Spaniards whom we have seen there\r\nfighting each other, and Olid's presence among them tended in no wise\r\nto lessen complications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GIL GONZALEZ AND OLID.]\r\n\r\nGil Gonzalez was not in condition to meet so powerful an opponent as\r\nOlid, especially with a threatening avenger in the near west; and so he\r\nthought it prudent to retire until he might secure to his own interests\r\nat least one side by an alliance. Nor was Olid just then strong enough\r\nopenly to brave a well known Spanish leader. He therefore met the\r\nadvances made him by Gil Gonzalez in a friendly spirit, and sought by\r\nartful letters to lull suspicions regarding his true motives.\r\n\r\nSurely they were not in vain, the lessons he had learned under\r\nthe astute Cortés. Watching an opportunity, when Gil Gonzalez had\r\nconfidingly divided his forces, he sent Briones, his maestre de campo,\r\nto surprise them in detail, while he himself prepared with another\r\nbody to descend in two caravels on the coast settlements. Early next\r\nmorning, as Olid awoke pluming himself over his well laid plans, a\r\npage rushed in, announcing, \"Two sails in the offing, señor capitan!\"\r\nOlid hastened to the shore not without misgivings that this might be a\r\nMexican expedition, bearing perhaps his injured chief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASAS SENT AFTER OLID.]\r\n\r\nIt so happened that while the renegade Olid was at Habana, the royal\r\nfactor, Salazar, had arrived there en route for Mexico to assume office,\r\nand learned only too clearly what was brewing. Nor was he the only one\r\nto carry the news. Cortés heard it with distended nostrils, and the\r\ncharacteristic swelling of his veins[XVII-14] indicated the anger which\r\nthe next moment found utterance. \"Villain! whom I have reared, and\r\nhonored, and trusted; by God and St Peter he shall rue it!\"[XVII-15]\r\nUnable to enter in person upon the determined chastisement, the general\r\nsent Francisco de las Casas, a resolute man of no mean ability, married\r\nto a cousin-german[XVII-16] of his, and therefore regarded with greater\r\nconfidence. He relied also on the many warm adherents in the rebel camp\r\nwho could require no very strong appeal to return to their leader. For\r\nthis reason four vessels, two of them quite small,[XVII-17] and one\r\nhundred and fifty men were deemed a sufficient force to subjugate the\r\nusurper.\r\n\r\nAs the fleet approached Triunfo a boatman was captured who gave\r\ninformation of the state of affairs, and on entering the harbor Casas\r\nhoisted a flag of peace with the hope that friendly overtures might\r\nbring about a revolution of sentiment, among a portion of the rebels,\r\nin favor of his chief. Olid, however, who had at once suspected the\r\ncharacter of the arrival, knew the danger of a parley, particularly\r\nsince the greater part of his force was absent. Brave and resolute,\r\nhe ordered his two caravels to be manned, and opened fire to prevent\r\na landing. Finding his overtures disregarded Casas replied with equal\r\nspirit, covering at the same time the operations of the boats which\r\nhe sent off. It was an original spectacle in these parts, Spaniards\r\nfighting Spaniards, in regular naval engagement; and as the hissing\r\nprojectiles flew out from the smoke over the still waters, followed\r\nnow and then by a crash, the noise of battle reverberating over the\r\nforest-clad hills, the dusky spectators who lined the shore should have\r\nbeen exceedingly grateful for this free exhibition of the wisdom and\r\npower of European civilization that had come so far to instruct them\r\nin such a fashion.[XVII-18] Presently, amidst the boom of cannon and\r\ndimly belching flames, cries of distress were heard, followed not long\r\nafter by shouts of victory. Olid's gunners had found their match. One\r\nof his caravels was sinking, and the attacking boats were approaching\r\nthe second. Hurriedly sounding the recall he sought the shore, with the\r\nloss of a few men,[XVII-19] sending meanwhile a boat to the victor with\r\na proposal for truce, on condition that no landing should be effected\r\ntill the negotiations for surrender were completed. Casas consents;\r\nand Ares dons the mask of Pallas. The first act of Olid on sighting\r\nthe fleet had been to despatch a messenger to his lieutenant Briones,\r\nsummoning him in all haste to his assistance. Time might now be gained\r\nby parley. But to the same lieutenant went another messenger from Casas\r\nwith the most alluring promises for active or passive aid. And in this\r\nCasas was so far successful that Olid waited in vain for succor, while\r\nhis opponent, under further prospect of support in the camp itself, lay\r\nconfidently at anchor waiting the dawn.[XVII-20]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLID CAPTURES HIS ENEMIES.]\r\n\r\nIt was a golden chain of treachery thus lengthening itself from the\r\ncapital of the Indies through Mexico and into the wilderness of Central\r\nAmerica; Velazquez revolts from Diego Colon, Cortés from Velazquez,\r\nOlid from Cortés, and Briones from Olid. But what avails the cunning\r\nof man against the gods! That night a storm burst upon the harbor,\r\nand within an hour the late victor found himself, with the loss of his\r\nvessels and some forty men, upon the shore swearing allegiance to the\r\nenemy.[XVII-21] Buffeted to exhaustion by the waves, and without arms,\r\nCasas was thus fished in by the exultant Olid.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to secure the fleeing Gil Gonzalez, who was surprised\r\nat Choloma and brought to headquarters,[XVII-22] which had meanwhile\r\nbeen removed to Naco, a fertile and salubrious valley about twenty\r\nleagues from Caballos, occupying a central position and abundantly\r\nsupplied with means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nOlid was a generous jailer. He was haunted by none of the suspicious\r\nfear which resorted to manacles and shackles. Casas and Gil Gonzalez\r\nwere treated rather as guests than as prisoners; they were given seats\r\nat Olid's own table, and allowed to share in every conviviality. They\r\nenjoyed in fact every liberty, except that of crossing the limit fixed\r\nfor their movements. Finding the host so lenient Casas began to plead\r\nalso for release. He wished to present himself before Cortés and justify\r\nhis conduct. Olid of course would not consent. \"You are too pleasant\r\na companion for me to lose,\" he smilingly said to his captive. \"Ah,\r\nwell! your worship,\" Casas replied, \"pray God I prove not so pleasant\r\nas some day to kill you.\" The prisoners had not failed to improve the\r\nopportunities which their trusting host provided, and finding that\r\nBriones held out as a rebel, they gained sufficient confidence to form\r\na conspiracy. On a certain evening seats at table were secured for\r\ntwo accomplices, while near at hand were others awaiting the appointed\r\nsignal. Ever a most agreeable companion, on this occasion Casas outdid\r\nhimself; and had not Olid been of so unsuspecting a nature he would have\r\nseen through the veil of affectation that enveloped the conversation.\r\nWhen the table was cleared and the attendants had withdrawn, the\r\nconspirators exchanged glances; whereupon one of them, Juan Nuñez de\r\nMercado, passed behind Olid, and seizing his head pulled it back, while\r\nCasas, who was seated beside him, rose and grasping him by the beard,\r\nbegan to slash at his throat with a pocket knife,[XVII-23] crying,\r\n\"Tyrant! the earth shall no longer endure thee.\" Gil Gonzalez was\r\ninstantly on the other side of Olid stabbing him in the breast. Yet with\r\nall their advantage they made slovenly work of it, cutting up the old\r\nhero. He was a powerful man, and in a moment had recovered himself and\r\nwas hurling his assailants right and left. He called to his guard, but\r\nthese were quickly secured by the conspirators. Olid made his escape,\r\nhowever, and sought a thicket where he fell, fainting from loss of\r\nblood. The conspirators shouted lustily, affirming that he was dead,\r\nand called on all present, in the name of the emperor and of Cortés, to\r\nrally round Casas.[XVII-24] None cared to refuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DEATH OF OLID.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cristóbal de Olid, one of the proudest of Mexico's proud\r\nconquerors, felt that the knives of these assassins had been too much\r\nfor him. He who had so many times faced death for mighty cause must now\r\ndie of dastardly blows inflicted by countrymen. True, he was a rebel.\r\nBut so was his master. And who of those present would not cast off\r\nany allegiance the moment their interests demanded it? The cold grasp\r\nof death was on him. Of what avail at this moment were the hardships\r\nendured, and the infamies so lately inflicted in the crushing of\r\nMontezuma and his people? Crawling to an Indian hut he begged shelter\r\nand secrecy, offering all his wealth for these favors, and for yet\r\nanother, that a priest should be summoned. How many of this race had\r\nbegged of him, and begged in vain! The owner of the hut went out upon\r\nhis mission. It was almost impossible that the dying conquistador should\r\nnot thereby be discovered, but to die unshriven was death thrice over.\r\nClosely upon the priest's heels like thirsting bloodhounds followed the\r\nassassins, who, now that their noble quarry was stricken, plucked up\r\nthe courage to cut off his head by law. Dragging forth the dying man, a\r\ncourt was formed, which that night declared him traitor, and doomed him\r\nto death. As if to favor them, life lingered with the prisoner until\r\nmorning, when he was brought into the plaza, his eyes half closed in\r\ndeath, to receive his sentence. There and then the hideous mockery was\r\ncompleted; and as the head was severed not one voice was heard, not one\r\nhand moved in sympathy for the gallant soldier who had so often led his\r\nmen to victory, and whose hand had been as free to give as was his voice\r\nto cheer.[XVII-25]\r\n\r\nBeing now master of the situation, Casas made some necessary changes\r\namong the officials to insure the fruits of victory. Triunfo having\r\nproved unsafe, it was decided to form a settlement in a more secure\r\nharbor. Nearly four score enrolled themselves as settlers and a\r\nmunicipality was appointed, with the recommendation to select a site at\r\nPuerto de Caballos, if found suitable, and to name the town Trujillo,\r\nafter the native town of Casas.[XVII-26] Eager to relieve the anxiety of\r\nCortés and to consult with him, Casas did not stay to see this carried\r\nout, but selecting Juan Lopez de Aguirre, originally treasurer, as his\r\nlieutenant, aided by the new alcaldes, Mendoza and Medina, the latter\r\nalso contador, he set out on his return to Mexico. A large number\r\naccompanied him, leaving but a little more than a hundred adherents of\r\nCortés in the province.[XVII-27] Among those who went was Gil Gonzalez,\r\ntoo dangerous a man to leave behind, who must appear before Cortés\r\nand arrange with him as to what share in the province he might keep,\r\nif any. Meanwhile his men appear to have been left in possession of\r\nthe Nito district.[XVII-28] The route taken led through Guatemala, the\r\nlater highway to Mexico. On the road they came upon Briones, who fancied\r\nthat his desertion of Olid entitled him to consideration on the part of\r\nOlid's enemy. But nobody liked the man, and regarding him, furthermore,\r\nas dangerous to the peace of Honduras, they took the precaution of\r\nhanging him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLieutenant Aguirre conducted his party to Caballos, as instructed, but\r\nthe site did not meet with general approval, and a vessel arriving with\r\na glowing description of Puerto de Honduras, it was decided to go there.\r\nThe vessel was chartered and Aguirre went on board with nearly forty\r\nmen, a number of native servants, and the stores and other articles\r\nwhich the party proceeding by land could not conveniently carry. When\r\nthe land expedition reached the port no vessel was there. An anxious\r\nsearch being instituted for the possible evidence of a shipwreck,\r\nan inscription by Aguirre was found bidding the men not to grieve;\r\nhe had sailed on for supplies and would soon return. The mockery of\r\nthis message was only too apparent, and bitterly did they denounce\r\nthe deserters who had carried off not only treasure and effects, but\r\nabandoned them on a strange shore with but scanty armament. The horses\r\nwere now their main reliance. Although poorly provided they remained,\r\nand electing Alcalde Medina to the captaincy, proceeded on May 18, 1525,\r\nto found Trujillo and install officers.[XVII-29]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SANTO DOMINGO AUTHORITIES.]\r\n\r\nOne morning, not long after, a caravel was seen approaching, and eagerly\r\nthe officials set out to meet her. But it was not theirs. The audiencia\r\nof Santo Domingo had heard of the threatened collision of rival factions\r\nin Honduras, and of the fuel Casas was bringing to the flame. They\r\nwere desirous that their authority should be felt in these parts. They\r\nwould bend the spirit of these turbulent governors. On this occasion\r\nFiscal Pedro Moreno, a better trader than judge, had been sent by the\r\ngrand tribunal to Honduras to order away Casas, to enjoin Córdoba and\r\nAlvarado not to meddle, to impose on Olid and Gil Gonzalez the authority\r\nof the audiencia, with injunctions to peaceably occupy only that part\r\nof which they had been the first to take possession, and to surrender\r\nto the fiscal the royal fifth. To cover the expenses of the commission\r\nthe chartered caravel had been loaded, for account of the crown, with\r\narms and stores, which were to be distributed among the needy colonists\r\nat a profit. If the adventure proved successful the judges might make\r\na part of the profit their own; if unfortunate, who so well fitted to\r\nbear the loss as the sovereign!\r\n\r\nMedina related to Moreno the troubles of the colonists, including the\r\ndesertion of Aguirre, and appealed to him for redress. He also asked\r\nfor arms. Moreno offered to relieve the wants of the colony only\r\non condition that it should transfer allegiance from Cortés to the\r\naudiencia, as agents for the emperor, and accept for captain Juan Ruano,\r\none of Olid's officers, as had been done by Gil Gonzalez' men.[XVII-30]\r\nPressed by necessity the colonists acquiesced. One of the first acts\r\nin connection with the transfer was to change the name Trujillo to\r\nAscension. After a kidnapping raid on a neighboring pueblo, Moreno\r\ndeparted with about forty slaves, promising soon to return with a\r\nforce strong enough to hold the province.[XVII-31] Hardly had his sails\r\ndisappeared when the colonists restored the standard of Cortés, and sent\r\nRuano to follow his patron, with the reminder that his moderation and\r\nefforts in their behalf had alone saved his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMARCH OF CORTÉS TO HONDURAS.\r\n\r\n1524-1525.\r\n\r\n     DOUBTS CONCERNING CASAS—CORTÉS TIRED OF INACTION—DETERMINES TO\r\n     GO IN PERSON TO HONDURAS—SETS OUT WITH A LARGE PARTY—ARRIVES\r\n     AT GOAZACOALCO—THE GAY ARMY SOON COMES TO GRIEF—THE WAY\r\n     BARRED BY LARGE RIVERS AND DEEP MORASSES—SCARCITY OF\r\n     PROVISIONS—SUFFERINGS OF THE SOLDIERS—THE TRICK OF THE\r\n     MERCHANT-CACIQUE—KILLING OF THE CAPTIVE KINGS—APOTHEOSIS OF\r\n     A CHARGER—FEARS OF REBELLIOUS SPANIARDS DISSIPATED ON NEARING\r\n     NITO.\r\n\r\n\r\nInordinate covetings had never been characteristic of Cortés; but when\r\na man attains eminence in wealth, power, or fame, it seems natural, it\r\nis rather expected, that he should become sordid, grasping, callous to\r\nhuman sympathy, indifferent to noble sentiment, the slave of avarice\r\nand ambition. Greed constitutes no small part of grandeur.\r\n\r\nNorthward from the Mexican capital were limitless lands; Cortés could\r\nnot tell how much there might be to the west; hence one would think he\r\nmight well leave to his countrymen in the south something for their\r\npains; that he might even give his captains independent governments\r\nwithout diminution of his manliness.\r\n\r\nBut insignificant to Cortés as was this Honduras country, and petty\r\nas were the bickerings of its occupants, they were nevertheless\r\nobjects of solicitude to the great chief. No sooner had Casas left the\r\nChalchiuhcuecan shore, than Cortés began to doubt the wisdom of his\r\ncourse in sending one servant after another. The more he reflected on\r\nthe popularity of Olid and the number of his men, the comparatively\r\nuntried ability of his opponent, and the reputed wealth of the country,\r\nthe more he feared for the result, and wished to be present there in\r\nperson.[XVIII-1] Not to mention the itching palm for power, this desire\r\nwas increased by the petty espionage to which the imperial officers\r\nsubjected his every movement. He longed to roam with kindred spirits\r\nin the wilds of the south, wherein native tradition located stately\r\ncities and treasure-filled palaces. He longed to meet a worthy foe. As\r\nhe nursed the dream, the glow increased within him at the prospect of\r\npenetrating unknown regions, overcoming toil and danger, and discovering\r\nsomething new, something startling; perchance he might find the\r\nlong-sought strait.\r\n\r\nA hint in this direction was sufficient to rouse the anxiety of friends\r\nand enemies alike. He was the guiding spirit of all undertakings, and\r\nthe protecting shield. All would return to chaos were he to withdraw;\r\nand the still wavering natives who respected and feared Malinche, as\r\nCortés was called by the Mexicans, above any host of soldiers, might\r\nrise and overwhelm them.\r\n\r\nSo urgent and general were the representations to this effect that he\r\nyielded, or pretended to yield.[XVIII-2] But the spirit of the Castilian\r\nexplorer once aroused could not be repressed. He felt that he had been\r\ntoo long idle, so he wrote his sovereign, and must do something in the\r\nservice of his Majesty.[XVIII-3] Preparations were accordingly resumed\r\nunder pretence that a disaffection in the Goazacoalco region required\r\nhis personal attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSONNEL OF THE ARMY.]\r\n\r\nHe set out from Mexico in the latter part of October, 1524,[XVIII-4]\r\nleaving the government in charge of men whose flattery had blinded him\r\nto their insidious designs. The party consisted of about one hundred\r\nhorsemen, half of them with extra animals, some forty archers and\r\narquebusiers, and three thousand native warriors and servants,[XVIII-5]\r\nthe latter chiefly under the leadership of the three deposed sovereigns,\r\nQuauhtemotzin the last emperor of Mexico, Tetlepanquetzal king of\r\nTlacopan, and Cohuanococh king of Tezcuco, and five or six captive\r\ncaciques, whom it was regarded unsafe to leave behind.[XVIII-6]\r\n\r\nAmong the leading officers in the train were the alguacil mayor,\r\nSandoval, Ocampo, Ircio, Saavedra, Grado, and a number who acted as\r\nhousehold officials and gentlemen in waiting to the leader. There\r\nwere also a retinue of pages, youths of good family, among them\r\nyoung Montejo, later conqueror of Yucatan, and a number of musicians,\r\njugglers, tumblers, and clowns.[XVIII-7] Cortés had a natural bent for\r\npomp, the pomp that gracefully adorns the truly great. The church was\r\nrepresented by a clergyman and three friars; chief among interpreters\r\nwas Marina, the Mexican maiden, whose clear head and devoted heart had\r\nmore than once saved the Castilian invaders, and preserved their leader\r\nto her love.\r\n\r\nThe march was directed to Espíritu Santo, the place of review, not far\r\nabove the mouth of the Goazacoalco. On the way the party was made the\r\nobject of a series of demonstrations, and the settlers of Goazacoalco,\r\nincluding the 'true historian,' Bernal Diaz, came forth in procession,\r\nwith fireworks and masquerade, to conduct the mighty conqueror under\r\ntriumphal arches and amid salvos to his quarters. The joy was mingled\r\nwith misgivings, however, for the small force and still smaller\r\nequipment awakened a fear that a levy might be made. This proved only\r\ntoo true, and while some joined of their own will, dazzled by the lustre\r\nof the leader's name, others, happy with a repartimiento of Indians,\r\nwho existed only to attend their wants, were not so quick to fall into\r\nline.[XVIII-8] The chiefs of the neighborhood were summoned to give\r\ninformation, and showed a surprising acquaintance with the country as\r\nfar south even as the domain of Pedrarias. They also prepared a map on\r\ncloth, depicting minutely the different rivers, mountains, and pueblos\r\non the route to Nito,[XVIII-9] some of them ravaged by Spaniards, and\r\nnow deserted. The manuscript representation of this vast region, filled\r\nwith great cities and rich provinces, determined Cortés to advance\r\ntoward Honduras direct, and abandon the idea once entertained of going\r\nthrough Guatemala.[XVIII-10] Both the map and the imagination failed,\r\nhowever, adequately to picture the vast morasses and miry sloughs\r\nalternating with and bordering the countless rivers which served for\r\nhighways to the natives. The lithe, unencumbered Indian could not\r\nclearly grasp the difficulties herein presented to the heavy cavalry,\r\nfor in his light canoe he could speed along the mighty streams, pass up\r\nthe tributary branches, and penetrate far and wide by means of the more\r\nshallow creeks into the primeval forests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A GAY COMPANY.]\r\n\r\nAfter a week's stay the expedition advanced. Tumbler and fiddler led\r\nin the van a merry dance, perhaps to death; in the rear was a herd of\r\nswine, kept at a safe distance, however, lest its presence should too\r\ngreatly tempt the appetite of the hungry soldiers. The artillery of\r\nfour guns, a quantity of small arms, ammunition, and stores were sent\r\nby a vessel to Rio Tabasco, to be followed by two small caravels from\r\nMedellin laden with provisions. From this point it was intended to let\r\none of them follow the coast, west of Yucatan, still regarded as an\r\nisland, so as to be able to furnish supplies when called upon by the\r\nland force which also expected to follow the shore. The rainy season\r\nwas not yet over, and the very brooks had swollen into rushing rivers.\r\nTwo streams, nine and eighteen leagues respectively from Espíritu Santo,\r\nhad to be crossed in canoes, the horses swimming,[XVIII-11] and beyond\r\nflowed a still wider watercourse which required a bridge of nine hundred\r\nand thirty-four paces in length. The difficulties of the march may be\r\nunderstood from the statement that while traversing Copilco province,\r\nfully fifty bridges had to be constructed within a distance of twenty\r\nleagues.[XVIII-12] It was a rich department with half a score of head\r\npueblos, and having an abundance of provisions they were ordered to send\r\ntribute in kind to Espíritu Santo. After crossing a steep range a wide\r\ntributary of Rio Tabasco was reached,[XVIII-13] where the troops were\r\ncheered by the arrival of a score of canoes laden with provisions from\r\none of the vessels. Natives of the province also appeared in obedience\r\nto a summons, and assisted in crossing the river and in opening a path\r\nalong the thickly wooded bank to the capital of Cihuatlan[XVIII-14]\r\nprovince, twelve leagues up the river. As they approached it the guides\r\nand sappers suddenly disappeared in the close-knit jungle. A few steps\r\nfurther the path opened at the junction of a tributary river, and on\r\nthe several banks was disclosed a large pueblo, silent as the grave;\r\nbut the smoke yet curling from the ruins showed that it had only\r\nrecently been abandoned. In the nearest suburb, which contained some\r\ntwo hundred houses, they remained for nearly three weeks. Meanwhile a\r\nbridge of three hundred paces was built across a marsh, and expeditions\r\nwere sent out in vain search for reliable guides, and to explore the\r\nneighborhood.[XVIII-15]\r\n\r\nThe next objective point was Chilapan, capital of a province bearing the\r\nsame name; this they also found burned and deserted, but well provided\r\nwith food. The crossing of the river here, which detained the army\r\nfor over a week, was effected on rafts, but despite the care taken the\r\nrushing torrent played havoc with the baggage. Beyond this lay a marshy\r\ntract only six leagues in extent, but so troublesome as to detain them\r\ntwo days. The horses suffered severely, sinking many times up to the\r\nears, as Cortés expresses it, and endangering the safety of the men\r\nin their struggles, so much so that three Spaniards were lost, beside\r\na number of Indians.[XVIII-16] After a week's rest at the ruined yet\r\nwell-stocked Tamacaztepec, they made another marshy journey of three\r\ndays before reaching Iztapan, a fine large pueblo on the banks of the\r\nUsumacinta, burned and deserted like the preceding. The Cihuatlatecs\r\nhad, it seems, in their wild scamper spread the most blood-curdling\r\nstories of the fierceness and cruelty of the Spaniards. The timidity of\r\nthe natives was proving inconvenient, and guides were sent out to assure\r\nthe inhabitants of the peaceful intent of the invaders. The caciques\r\nwere encouraged to tender submission in person, and were rewarded with\r\npresents, accompanied by a grandiloquent discourse about \"the greatest\r\nprince on earth,\" and the mission he had given Cortés to remedy evils,\r\nbestow benefits, and point the way to salvation.[XVIII-17]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONQUERING AND TO CONQUER.]\r\n\r\nA week's rest was taken, during which half a dozen Spaniards were sent\r\nup the river in canoes to receive the submission of chiefs, not to\r\nmention the accompanying presents that were to indicate the wealth of\r\nthe district. Three soldiers were also sent down the stream, to Tabasco,\r\nwith orders for the fleet to sail to Ascension Bay,[XVIII-18] after\r\nsending boats with provisions and stores to Acalan. It was to follow\r\nthe shore so as to be near the army, if possible, for \"it is believed,\"\r\nwrites Cortés, \"though not for certain, that the natives pass through\r\nthe Bay of Términos to the other sea, leaving Yucatan an island.\" One\r\nof the three soldiers bearing the instructions was Francisco de Medina,\r\nan ill-tempered, violent, but able man, with some knowledge of the\r\ncountry and the language, who had managed to ingratiate himself with his\r\nchief so far as to be commissioned to share the command of the fleet\r\nwith the actual captain, Simon de Cuenca, one of Cortés' mayordomos.\r\nOn reaching the vessels at Xicalanco he assumed an overbearing manner,\r\nand quarrelled with Cuenca about the command till it came to blows.\r\nPerceiving the state of affairs the natives watched their opportunity,\r\nattacked and killed the crew, pillaged the vessels, and burned them\r\nto remove the evidence. The news spread until it reached the capital,\r\nalthough in a distorted form, which gave the impression that Cortés and\r\nall his force had perished. The anxiety became so great that Ordaz, one\r\nof the favorite officers of Cortés, set out among others to ascertain\r\nthe truth of the report. Following the coast by water, he reached the\r\nscene of the slaughter, and received such evidence as to lead him to\r\ndeclare that the great leader must indeed be dead. Obsequies in his\r\nhonor were accordingly held at Mexico, after which but a trusting few\r\nentertained hopes of ever seeing him again.[XVIII-19]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProceeding to Tatahuitlapan Cortés found the place partly burned, and\r\ndeserted by all save a score of native priests, who inspired by duty had\r\nresolved to stay and die with the idols as ordained by the oracle. To\r\nshow their impotence the images were destroyed, while the keepers were\r\nexhorted to devote themselves to the veneration of the cross, to whose\r\nmerciful inspiration they owed their safety. It was a sacred duty with\r\nCortés to erect the Christian emblem in all pueblos and camping-places,\r\nand where ceiba-trees grew they were fashioned into crosses which,\r\nblooming anew, stood as living symbols of the saving faith. On the\r\ncrosses were fastened notices of the expedition. In this region exists\r\nto-day a village called Las Tres Cruces, from three crosses said to have\r\nbeen left by Cortés. The place is barely thirty miles from the famous\r\nruins of Palenque, yet no allusion is made by the conquerors to the\r\nstupendous structures, the matchless palaces, and the curious sculptures\r\nthere existing. Once the object of admiration and worship to countless\r\npilgrims from far-off districts, the city now lay wrapped within the\r\nsecure folds of dense forests, and only tradition spoke of her past\r\nglories. Perhaps it was well for the fortune-hunters, at least, that\r\nvegetation had obliterated the highways which in times past must have\r\nled to the shrine of the 'tree of life' from the malarious lowlands of\r\nthe Usumacinta region, for a sight of such grandeur might have awakened\r\nhopes never to be realized, and prompted expeditions ending only in\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DARK FORESTS AND MORASSES.]\r\n\r\nThey now struck across to Huetecpan,[XVIII-20] higher up the river,\r\nand, after wading through a slough, plunged into a forest whose close\r\ngrowth shut out the very light of heaven.[XVIII-21] Here they groped\r\nfor two days along the sappers' path, till they found themselves back\r\non the route already traversed. Pressed by the troubled leaders the\r\nguides cried out that they were lost. This admission was not without\r\ndanger, for the provisions were exhausted, and the men filled with\r\ngloomy forebodings, which found vent with many in curses on their\r\nleader for having brought them to such a pass. They demanded that\r\nthe swine be slaughtered, but the mayordomo, who had prudently let\r\nthe drove fall behind, intimated that the alligators had eaten them.\r\nThey must be content with the scanty sustenance of roots and berries.\r\nMeanwhile Cortés had recourse to his maps and compass, and determined\r\non a north-east course as the most likely to lead to his destination.\r\nThis calculation proved correct, and although the place was in ruins,\r\nthere was enough of food to bury gloom in feasting. Soldiers being\r\nsent in search of guides, found a little beyond the river a lake where\r\nthe inhabitants had taken refuge in canoes and on islands. Finding\r\nthemselves discovered the natives came fearlessly forth, stating that\r\nthe Spanish boat expedition from Iztapan had reassured them, so much\r\nso that a brother of the cacique had joined the party with four armed\r\ncanoes for convoy. The boats being recalled, brought evidence of the\r\nsubmission tendered by four or five pueblos in a cargo of honey and\r\nother delicacies, with a little gold. Similar contributions flowed\r\nfrom different pueblos whose inhabitants came to gaze at the bearded\r\nmen.[XVIII-22]\r\n\r\nExplorers were sent forward as on previous occasions, to report on\r\nthe road, but finding it comparatively easy for some distance they\r\nneglected to examine the remainder,[XVIII-23] and misled the army as\r\nto the nature of the route. Beyond lay a large province bounded by the\r\nLaguna de Términos, the broad Usumacinta, and the ranges of Vera Paz, a\r\nlow-lying country abounding in morasses, miasmatic inlets, and winding\r\nrivers tributary to the Términos. The fertility of this naturally\r\nirrigated tract, not inaptly known as Acalan, 'land of boats,' was\r\nevident in the rank growth of the vegetation, and the great variety of\r\nproducts. No roads existed, but the numerous streams provided a series\r\nof highways which the enterprising natives had not failed to utilize\r\nin carrying their surplus products to arid and less rich provinces,\r\nespecially to the north-east and south, and in bringing back slaves and\r\ncompact treasures. It was quite natural for a people engaged in traffic\r\nto choose as ruler the richest trader, and such a one was the present,\r\nApochpalon[XVIII-24] by name. To him were sent a number of Spaniards and\r\nIndians[XVIII-25] with a reassuring message and an invitation to meet\r\nCortés.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRIDGE-BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nAfter a three days' march over a rough mountain track, the army suddenly\r\nfound the path obstructed by a deep channel five hundred paces wide,\r\nwith slimy borders. The passage was shown to be practicable only by\r\nmeans of a bridge which required patient labor, since the depth of\r\nwater and mud proved to be fully six fathoms. Great was the dismay, for\r\nthere were hardly any provisions left, and to recross the mountain was\r\na formidable task under the circumstances. The murmurs of the worn-out\r\nsoldiers were loud enough at the first sight of the obstruction, and\r\nwhen Cortés with his usual audacity gave orders to build a bridge,\r\nthey rose almost into mutiny. The leader had been in worse troubles\r\nhowever. He knew every trait of a Spanish soldier's character, and he\r\nwas versed in blandishments. He showed the futility of retreat, since\r\napart from the mountain road, so long and severe, freshets must by this\r\ntime have washed away the means of recrossing rivers, and no provisions\r\nwere left in the deserted pueblos. Before them, on the other hand, lay\r\na land of plenty, seamed with gold. He would guarantee the completion\r\nof the bridge within five days, or, this failing, he would follow their\r\nwishes. Wily Cortés! Could he induce them to begin the work, he would\r\ntrust his wits to secure its completion. But the men remained sullen.\r\nThey would die of hunger before the bridge was finished. Hibueras would\r\nnever be reached. \"Very well,\" said Cortés, \"be spectators, I will build\r\nthe bridge with the aid of Indians alone.\" Brief persuasion was needed\r\nwith the latter, for the chiefs were in the tyrant's hands, and their\r\nword was law to their followers. Timber was felled, and with the aid of\r\nrafts the piling began. Shamed by this measure the Spaniards joined in\r\nthe work, and to cheer them the solitary musician who had not fainted\r\nbeneath the hardships of the march was ordered to play some cheering\r\nairs. But the men cried, \"Peace! we want bread, not music.\" The gnawings\r\nof hunger could not be appeased with empty sound.\r\n\r\nWhile some thus worked diligently on the bridge, others went in search\r\nof roots and berries, but with poor success. Overcome by famine and\r\nfatigue numbers lay down to die, while, to add to the catalogue of\r\nhorrors, several of the Indian guides were seized by native auxiliaries\r\nand cooked. Among the victims to the adventure thus far, says\r\nTorquemada, was Fray Juan de Tecto, who, exhausted by hunger, leaned\r\nhis head against a tree and surrendered his spirit.[XVIII-26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORE AND DEEPER SLOUGHS.]\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of a week the bridge was completed, a painful\r\nwork indeed for fainting men, ill-furnished with the means, to perform\r\nwithin so short a time. It was composed, says Cortés, of a thousand\r\ntrees, nine to ten fathoms long, the smallest almost as thick as a\r\nman, besides a quantity of small timber, secured with wooden pegs\r\nand withes. For years this and several other 'bridges of Malinche'\r\nremained a source of utility and wonder to the natives, who declared\r\nthat nothing was impossible to the white man.[XVIII-27] Hunger and toil\r\nwere for the moment forgotten in congratulations over the completion\r\nof the structure, but their joy was of short duration. Hardly had the\r\nrear of the army crossed the bridge when the van came to a slough which\r\nsurpassed in difficulties any yet encountered. The horses sank almost\r\nout of sight, and it was only by the united efforts of the army that\r\nthe beasts, on which their success so greatly depended, were finally\r\nextricated. This trouble over they were cheered by the arrival of Bernal\r\nDiaz, who had been absent foraging. It was not always that he returned\r\nso well laden, for now he had one hundred and thirty loads of maize\r\nand a quantity of fowl and other provisions. Sometimes he could find\r\nnothing; sometimes what he found he hid, lest with the starving army he\r\nhimself should starve. He was sure it would be snatched from his hands\r\nthe moment he entered camp; and so it was on the present occasion; the\r\nsoldiers pounced upon and devoured it like famished wolves. During the\r\nscramble were seized also the stores intended for the officers, so that\r\nthe general himself could not obtain a crumb. Fortunately Bernal Diaz\r\nhad with his usual foresight placed in cache a portion of these very\r\nprovisions, and suspecting this Cortés so petted and praised the old\r\nsoldier[XVIII-28] that he had no longer the heart to withhold the food.\r\n\r\nWith Bernal Diaz came also messengers from the cacique bringing\r\npresents, including a little gold, and offering the hospitality of his\r\nrealm. The following day Tizapetlan was reached, where food had been\r\nprepared. There the expedition remained a week. The attentive natives\r\nwere awed no less by the number of the invaders than by their strange\r\nappearance. The horses were a perpetual source of wonder, and offerings\r\nof roses were made to allay the anger displayed by their fierce pawing.\r\nThe merchant-chief had thought it prudent to be obsequious to men so\r\nformidable; but, when he saw how food disappeared before them, and how\r\ngreedily every valuable was appropriated, he trembled with apprehension.\r\nIf they were content to stay and feast for a week in one of his\r\nmiserable border towns, how long might they not tarry in the central\r\ncities of the richer districts? To rid the province of the cormorants,\r\nthe cacique pretended to have died, directing his son to lead them\r\nquickly in upon the lands of a neighbor. After the funeral rites and\r\ninterchange of presents, the young man addressed the Spaniards. \"You\r\nwould reach the settlements of your countrymen in Honduras. They are\r\nquite near; hardly eight days distant is Nito, where are floating\r\nhouses, and bearded men on giant deer.\"\r\n\r\nThis he could affirm, for there was an Acalan factory, and at its\r\nhead Apochpalon's own brother, who had told him of these things. This\r\nnews was more to the cacique's purpose than any artifice, and eagerly\r\nthe expedition hurried to Teotilac,[XVIII-29] five or six leagues\r\noff, guided thither by the dutiful young chief over a circuitous\r\nroute.[XVIII-30]\r\n\r\nThe ruler of Teotilac was by no means pleased to find thrown upon him\r\nthis hungry host; and he revealed to Cortés the trickery of Apochpalon.\r\nThereupon Cortés ordered the dead man immediately to appear. Two\r\ndays later, accordingly, the sovereign-cacique arrived, looking most\r\nsheepish. He proffered innumerable excuses, and tendered as amends the\r\nhospitality of the capital. The offer was too tempting not to procure\r\nhis forgiveness.\r\n\r\nOne of the two temples serving for army headquarters at Teotilac was\r\noccupied by a goddess, whose fierce passions could be appeased only with\r\nthe blood of beautiful virgins. To insure the genuineness of the vestal\r\noffering, so that a mistake might not render it fruitless, girls were\r\nselected in infancy and brought up in strictest seclusion within the\r\ntemple walls, till came the time for yielding their fair forms to the\r\nsacrifice. Cortés sought to impress on the people the absurdity of so\r\natrocious a superstition, and destroyed the idol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONSPIRACY OF THE CAPTIVE KINGS.]\r\n\r\nThis place is remarkable for one incident which concerned the safety\r\nof the Spaniards, according to their account, and left an indelible\r\nimpression on the natives of New Spain. Among those who followed\r\nthe expedition as hostages, as we have seen, were three deposed\r\nkings, two of whom were now accused of treachery, Quauhtemotzin,\r\nand Tetlepanquetzal. These patriots were criminal in the eyes of the\r\nSpaniards; they had dared to regard the invaders as the enemies of their\r\ncountry, and bitterly to oppose them. It seemed now convenient to Cortés\r\nthat they should die, and excuse was not wanting for killing them.\r\nSuffering every hardship of the march, the royal captives had found some\r\nconsolation in observing how heavily it bore on their keepers, toiling,\r\nstarving, discontented, blundering along an unknown and dangerous route.\r\nBut this was not their only feeling. Quauhtemotzin, the sovereign,\r\nthe general, the tactician, could not fail to observe the disparity\r\nbetween his followers and the hated white men. The latter were reduced\r\nin strength by famine and hardships, in the midst of a strange country,\r\nfar from relief, while the Mexicans, if also weakened, and not so well\r\narmed, were tenfold more numerous, and more at home in these wilds.\r\nInspired by a deeply rooted devotion to their traditions, to their\r\nprinces, to their country, the merest whisper of revenge, of freedom,\r\ncould not fail to find response. Yes, sweet was the thought of revenge;\r\nequally sweet the prospect of a triumphal return to Mexico, there to\r\nbe greeted as a liberator ordained to restore the ancient grandeur of\r\nMontezuma's court; finally, perhaps, to be exalted by a grateful people\r\nto the pantheon of the gods, a dream so worthy the soldier and patriot,\r\nhow oft may it not have smiled upon his fancy! What more natural, what\r\nmore commendable indeed, than projects for the liberation not alone of\r\nthe auxiliary host, but of their country and kindred? Treachery had\r\nbeen used to reduce them, and treachery must be met with treachery.\r\nThis was justifiable, although the Indians probably weighed not the\r\nmoral aspect of the question. As for the risk, one blow, one death,\r\nwas preferable to the daily death which they were suffering on this\r\njourney. Yes, they must take advantage of the opportunity presented, and\r\nwhile the Spaniards were engrossed by the difficulties of some mountain\r\npass, or engulfed in some morass, fall upon them, especially upon the\r\nfeared Cortés, and then, with the prestige of victors, return to Mexico,\r\nwhere their compatriots would meanwhile, under advice, have risen\r\nsimultaneously against the now disorganized and squabbling colonists,\r\nreduced as they were in numbers.[XVIII-31]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KILLING OF THE KINGS.]\r\n\r\nHow long the plot had been brewing is not stated, but during\r\nthe stay at Teotilac Cortés was startled by a revelation from a\r\nprominent Mexican,[XVIII-32] who gave him a paper with the names of\r\nthe conspirators in hieroglyphics. Several were seized, and under\r\nseparate examination confessed to the existence of the plot, although\r\ndisclaiming for themselves of course any actual participation.[XVIII-33]\r\nQuauhtemotzin was also questioned, and admitted, says Bernal Diaz, that\r\nthe hardships and dangers had aroused rebellious sentiments among the\r\nIndians, but claimed that he was not the author, and judging from his\r\nown feelings he regarded the whole thing as mere talk. A quick secret\r\ntrial was held, and the sentence of death by hanging pronounced against\r\nQuauhtemotzin and Tetlepanquetzal,[XVIII-34] who were dragged forth\r\nduring the stillness of the night to a ceiba-tree, where they met their\r\nfate. Cortés was present at the execution, and to him Quauhtemotzin\r\naddressed himself, writes Bernal Diaz. \"Malinche, many a day have I\r\nsuspected the falsity of thy words, and that thou hadst destined this\r\nend to my life. Why dost thou kill me without justice? God will demand\r\nof thee thy answer!\" Tetlepanquetzal calmly expressed himself content\r\nto die with his royal companion, and together they listened to the\r\nexhortations of the friars, dying like true Christians.[XVIII-35] The\r\nexecution took place during the carnival days preceding shrove-tide,\r\nand appears to have created no excitement either among Indians or\r\nSpaniards.[XVIII-36]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCUSES FOR THE ATROCITY.]\r\n\r\nMost Spanish authorities are of course inclined to uphold the act\r\nas a necessary punishment for a proven crime. Yet certain men, like\r\nTorquemada, a champion of the natives, and modern Mexican writers, side\r\nwith the Indians in stamping it as a foul murder, carried out merely\r\nto be rid of the kings whose presence was becoming a burden to the\r\nconquerors. Others, like Bernal Diaz, soften the deed into a mistake,\r\nbased on insufficient evidence, and prompted by a desire to smother a\r\nconspiracy which some imaginary spirits had conjured.[XVIII-37] But\r\nCortés would hardly have removed so valuable a hostage without good\r\nreason. The reason being admitted, and this to some extent even by\r\nnative records, the precarious situation of the Spaniards demanded\r\nthat Cortés should take measures commensurate with the apparent\r\ndanger.[XVIII-38]\r\n\r\nMany of the natives, particularly those now encountering the Spaniards\r\nfor the first time, regarded the discovery of the conspiracy with\r\nsuperstitious awe. The idea of treachery by an accomplice did not\r\nseem to so occur to them, but with mysterious shaking of the head\r\nthey pointed to the compass and chart. Instruments which had so\r\nunaccountably, and better than any guide, pointed out the road and saved\r\nthe army from destruction, could of course reveal a simple conspiracy.\r\nNothing could be hidden from the owner of that needle. Conscious,\r\nperhaps, of some stray unfriendly thought, many hastened to Cortés to\r\nprotest their devotion. \"Look into the mirror, and you will find it\r\nso,\" they said, alluding to the compass, yet quaking the while lest a\r\nsuspicion should there stand depicted. Apochpalon was so affected that\r\nhe hastened to tender allegiance and to burn idols. So convenient a\r\nbelief was not to be disturbed, and the natives were allowed to nurse\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ARMY AT IZANCANAC.]\r\n\r\nThe army now proceeded to Izancanac,[XVIII-39] the populous capital of\r\nAcalan, conducted by Apochpalon in person. He was mounted on a horse,\r\nand the first apprehensions over, he strode his steed with childish\r\ndelight. The soldiers were treated with sumptuous hospitality, and\r\nCortés was gratified with presents of gold and women. Meanwhile, to\r\nfacilitate the further march, the road was improved, a bridge built, and\r\nguides were provided, besides an advance corps laden with provisions.\r\nIn return for all this Apochpalon asked merely for a letter to prove to\r\nother white comers that he had been faithful.\r\n\r\nThere was every inducement to prolong the stay at Izancanac, served\r\nand feasted as they were, but the nearness of the Spanish settlements,\r\nas alluringly depicted by the calculating Apochpalon, was an incentive\r\nfor all to proceed. Laden with rations for a week, they departed on the\r\nfirst Sunday in Lent from the fair province of Acalan, over which, the\r\nprotective letter notwithstanding, the withering influence of Spaniards\r\nwas soon to fall. On the third day they entered the prairie-studded\r\nprovince of the Mazatecs,[XVIII-40] so called from the abundance\r\nof deer. These animals were here regarded with veneration, and the\r\nconsequent immunity from pursuit had made them not only numerous,\r\nbut tame. The soldiers, being restrained by no scruples of native\r\nsuperstition, could not resist the temptation of a chase over the\r\nverdure-clad fields, and soon a score of deer were added to the larder.\r\nThe following day they came to a frontier fortress, built on a rock,\r\nand bounded on one side by a lake, on the other by a river, and with\r\nonly one means of access. Besides this natural strength it was protected\r\nby a double stockade with moats, surmounted by towers, and the houses\r\nwere also provided with shot-holes. The place was in fact impregnable,\r\nand every precaution was taken to meet the resistance for which the\r\nattack of some lately captured scouts had prepared them. Cautiously they\r\nadvanced toward the entrance. Not a sound, not a movement. An ambuscade\r\nmust have been formed, since no gate barred the entry. But within\r\nreigned silence, and it was only on reaching the plaza that some chiefs\r\nappeared with humble obeisance. This was one of the asylums erected by\r\nthe Mazatecs for refuge against the wild Lacandones. But what availed\r\nwalls and arms against the irresistible bearded men who controlled\r\nthe lightning. Them the inhabitants dared not resist. They had fled\r\nto mountain fastnesses, leaving their wealth of provisions and arms at\r\nthe disposal of the invaders, with the sole request that the place be\r\nnot destroyed. The chiefs were reassured, and after replenishing their\r\nstores the Spaniards proceeded for seven leagues to a larger and similar\r\npueblo called Tiac, situated on a plain, within a stockade, each of\r\nits three wards being provided with separate palisades. The caciques\r\nof this and several other pueblos of the province, each independent and\r\nquarrelsome, sent messengers with presents and offers of allegiance, but\r\ncould not be prevailed upon to come in person with their people. The\r\nguides here obtained gave the cheering information that the white men\r\nwere not far off, and conducted them to Ahuncahuitl, the last pueblo of\r\nthis province, also fortified, and amply provisioned, so much so that\r\nrations were taken for the five days' march which intervened before\r\nreaching the province of the Itzas.[XVIII-41]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRIVAL AT THE ITZA CAPITAL.]\r\n\r\nFour nights were spent in the mountains, in which was a bad pass, called\r\nAlabastro from the appearance of the rock. They now came to a small\r\nlake with an island pueblo, from which the inhabitants fled as the\r\nsoldiers waded over.[XVIII-42] The following day they were surprised to\r\nbehold the gleaming walls and lofty temples of a large pueblo, situated\r\non an isle several miles from shore, in a large sheet of water, which\r\nCortés assumed to be an arm of the sea.[XVIII-43] But his ordeal was\r\nnot yet over. It was the lake now known as Peten, and the pueblo was\r\nTayasal,[XVIII-44] the capital of the Itzas, which recalled in a measure\r\nto the old conquerors the first and never to be forgotten view of the\r\nfamous queen city enthroned in the lake of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe natives had taken to their canoes on the approach of the Spaniards,\r\nand heeded no signs or appeals, but with the aid of a dog a solitary\r\nboatman was captured. A friendly message was now despatched to the\r\ncanek inviting him to a conference, and offering hostages. It was not\r\nlong ere six large canoes approached the shore, and some thirty persons\r\nstepped fearlessly forth. At their head came one whose commanding figure\r\nand quiet dignity announced the ruler. A flowing white robe disclosed\r\nan elaborately tattooed skin, relieved by an embroidered maxtli.\r\nThe braided hair was surmounted by a head-dress of feathers, and the\r\nface, also tattooed with black lines, was further ornamented with gold\r\npendants in nose and ears. He bade Cortés welcome, and expressed himself\r\nsecure in his company without the proffered hostage.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour for mass, and with a view both to please him and to\r\nteach a pious lesson, the ceremony was held with chant and instrumental\r\naccompaniment. The faith was thereupon explained by a friar, with so\r\ngood an effect that the chief promised to destroy his idols and venerate\r\nthe cross till teachers should arrive to give him full instruction. As\r\nan earnest of his intention presents were produced, consisting chiefly\r\nof provisions, with a few strings of red shells highly valued by the\r\nnatives, and other trinkets; and though the gold was small in quantity,\r\nyet it encouraged Cortés to give in return a shirt, a velvet cap, and\r\nsome cutlery. News had reached the island city of the doings of the\r\nEuropeans, not only at Naco and Nito, but in Tabasco, where the natives\r\nsome years before had been conquered in three battles. Cortés hastened\r\nto assure the canek that he saw before him the hero of those famed\r\nencounters, and finding that an impression had been produced, he warmed\r\nwith a description of the power and grandeur of the greatest prince on\r\nearth. The canek was not merely impressed but awed, so much so that he\r\nat once tendered allegiance.\r\n\r\nWith new guides the main body proceeded round the lake southward, while\r\nCortés entered the canoes with a score of archers to visit the island\r\ncity. The officers sought to dissuade him from risking his person in the\r\nhands of a perhaps treacherous enemy, but the general did not wish to\r\nbe surpassed in fearlessness and confidence.[XVIII-45] He was greatly\r\nadmired by the islanders who thronged round his mailed followers with\r\nmingled curiosity and awe. On leaving he commended to their care a\r\nblack horse which had been disabled by a wound in the leg. Ignorant of\r\nthe treatment required by the animal, and eager to do reverence to the\r\nstrange charge, they are said to have offered it flowers and fowl, on\r\nwhich diet it died. The grief of the Itzas was equalled only by their\r\nfear. What would the white chief say when he returned? Nothing now\r\nremained but to do homage to the carcass. They had seen the flash of\r\nthe fire-arm as the mounted hunter chased the deer on the prairie, and\r\nfancied that this as well as the report issued from the horse. What\r\nmore appropriate apotheosis of a charger than into a god of thunder?\r\nAs Tziminchac it was accordingly adored. The bones were kept as\r\nsacred relics while an effigy sejant of the animal, formed of masonry,\r\nattracted direct worship.[XVIII-46]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOILSOME ADVANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe next resting-place of the army was at Tlecan, a deserted pueblo some\r\nseven leagues from Tayasal, where the Spaniards stayed for four days\r\nand provided themselves with a week's rations. Six leagues further a\r\nhalt was made at a hamlet, in honor of the virgin's festival.[XVIII-47]\r\nNine leagues beyond, a rugged pass was entered in which the rough sharp\r\nstones tore from the horses feet their very shoes. The next station bore\r\nthe name Ahuncapun where a two days' halt was made. Five leagues beyond\r\nlay Tachuytel, after which began an eight league ascent of the roughest\r\nmountains yet encountered, called de Pedernales, Mountain of Flints.\r\nThe horses could hardly move a step without slipping, and cutting their\r\nlegs and bodies most dangerously. On any other occasion the sight of\r\nsuffering among the prized animals, the chief reliance of the army,\r\nwould have touched the men deeply, but now they were too much absorbed\r\nby their own sufferings to think of them. Many of the soldiers were also\r\nbecoming disabled, and the provisions were giving out in the midst of\r\nthe mountains, which in many places offered not even a root. Days passed\r\nby in slow and toilsome advance; none could tell how much longer this\r\nlong journey would last. A heavy rain added to their torment, and past\r\nsufferings were forgotten in the present. Many fell from exhaustion and\r\nhunger, or slipped from the rocks into the abyss; and so extreme was\r\nthe need, says Herrera, that one confessed to having eaten of the brains\r\nand entrails of three men who had died of hunger.[XVIII-48]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A FORMIDABLE FORD.]\r\n\r\nCortés did his utmost to encourage the men. With pike in hand he would\r\nlead the march over the difficult parts of the road; he cheered and\r\nconsoled them, and divided what he had with the sick and famished.\r\nThis energy, this sympathy and generosity did wonders and animated the\r\nmen to repress their murmurs. Finally, after twelve days of toil, says\r\nCortés, the terrible flint road ended; but it had cost the lives of\r\nseveral men, and sixty-eight horses had fallen over the cliffs, or had\r\nbeen fatally disabled, while the rest did not recover from the strains\r\nand bruises for three months.[XVIII-49] Now the men began to breathe\r\neasier, but, as once before, the dawning joy was abruptly checked by\r\na formidable obstacle. They found themselves on the banks of a wide\r\nriver whose waters tore by with a rapidity that made even rafting\r\nimpracticable. While the soldiers stood gazing in mute despair at the\r\nbarriers behind and in front, praying for deliverance, Cortés sent out\r\nparties to search for an outlet, and soon reports were brought of a\r\nford. It was as a reprieve from death. Te Deum was solemnly chanted, and\r\ntough old soldiers shed tears of joy. When the nature of the passage was\r\nobserved, it seemed indeed as if heaven had decreed a miracle in their\r\nbehalf. The ford, two thirds of a league wide, consisted of a smooth\r\nledge stretching across the whole river, and intersected by over twenty\r\nchannels, through which the water rushed with deafening roar. But even\r\nthe channels could not be crossed without bridges, and fully two days\r\nwere spent in felling timber for the twenty passages.[XVIII-50]\r\n\r\nIt was Easter eve[XVIII-51] when the ford was crossed by the infantry,\r\nfollowed by the disabled horses. Again came a check to their joy.\r\nTenciz, the pueblo at which they now arrived, a league beyond the\r\nford, had been evacuated, and nearly all the supplies carried off. For\r\nover ten days the men had eaten hardly anything but palm-cabbage, and\r\nvery little of that, owing to the trouble in obtaining it.[XVIII-52]\r\nFortunately, some natives were found who guided a foraging party back\r\nacross the river a day's journey into the Tahuytal province, where an\r\nabundance of provisions was obtained, and which furnished the army with\r\ngood cheer during the five days' stay at Tenciz, and with some rations\r\nfor the journey into Acuculin province.\r\n\r\nThe guides here obtained ran away, and the Spaniards had to advance\r\nwith the aid of native maps alone. The route was level, and eleven\r\nleagues were easily covered in two days by crossing two rivers. This\r\nbrought them to a small settlement of Acalan traders, who had been\r\ndriven from Nito by the Spanish excesses, and found refuge here. Soon\r\nafter the capital of the province was reached, but it was deserted and\r\nalmost devoid of provisions. This was most discouraging, and to advance\r\nwithout guides appeared dangerous. Notwithstanding the scanty sustenance\r\nobtained from palm-cabbage, cooked with pork, and unsalted, a week was\r\nspent in searching for guides. Finally a boy was found who led them a\r\nday's journey to a river in Taniha province, evidently Rio Sarstoon.\r\nFollowing the stream downward for a couple of days they came to Otulizti\r\npueblo, where the natives reported that Nito lay only two suns away.\r\nIn proof of this assertion two women were brought who had served the\r\nSpaniards there. Hunger and fatigue were forgotten in the rejoicing over\r\nthis news, and the men impatiently begged to be led onward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPROACH TO NITO.]\r\n\r\nBut there was need for prudence, since nothing was known about the\r\ncondition of affairs in Honduras, and the troops were not at present\r\nin a position to meet a well-equipped foe, particularly if led by the\r\nredoubtable Olid. Sandoval was accordingly sent forward with a few\r\nchosen men to reconnoitre. It was not far to the shore of the Amatique\r\nBay, beyond which lay the object of their journey. The bay was skirted\r\ntill they reached the wide stream which forms the outlet of Golfo Dulce.\r\nHere they captured a trader's canoe, and then hid themselves to see what\r\nnext should happen. It was not long before a canoe approached with four\r\nwhite men, who were outflanked and secured. They proved to be soldiers\r\nof Gil Gonzalez stationed at Nito, to which site the old settlement\r\nat San Gil de Buenavista had been transferred.[XVIII-53] On the whole\r\nthe account of affairs was cheering to Sandoval, the main point being\r\nthat the province was quiet, and thoroughly devoted to Cortés, although\r\nwithout a regular governor since the departure of Casas. A messenger\r\nwas at once despatched to relieve the anxiety of the general, and the\r\nsoldier to whom the commission was intrusted reaped a rich harvest from\r\nhis overjoyed chief and comrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCORTÉS IN HONDURAS.\r\n\r\n1525-1526.\r\n\r\n     HE IS MASTER OF ALL THE MISERIES THERE—MIASMA AND DEEP\r\n     DISTRESS—EXERTIONS OF CORTÉS IN BEHALF OF THE COLONISTS—A\r\n     VESSEL APPEARS WITH PROVISIONS—CORTÉS SENDS OUT FORAGERS—HE\r\n     SEEKS A BETTER LOCALITY—SANDOVAL AT NACO—OTHERS SETTLE AT\r\n     CABALLOS—CORTÉS AT TRUJILLO—VESSELS SENT TO MEXICO, CUBA,\r\n     AND JAMAICA—TROUBLES IN MEXICO—CORTÉS IRRESOLUTE—STARTS FOR\r\n     MEXICO—IS DRIVEN BACK BY A STORM—PACIFICATION OF ADJACENT\r\n     PUEBLOS—CORTÉS SENDS PRESENTS TO CÓRDOBA—SHALL CORTÉS MAKE\r\n     HIMSELF MASTER OF NICARAGUA?—ARRIVAL OF ALTAMIRANO—RETURN OF\r\n     CORTÉS TO MEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nCicero says that a man's best adviser is himself. A wise man can find\r\nno better counsellor than his own cool, impartial judgment. Cortés was\r\na wise man, and he could calmly judge. Had he counselled with himself\r\nbefore setting out on this adventure? He had led into Honduras, amidst\r\ngreat sufferings, an army. The end of his perilous march brought to him\r\nno great achievement, no great reward. There was no Olid to punish;\r\nCasas was not a traitor. Might not the proud conqueror with more\r\nadvantage have remained at home? The assurance of a ready welcome,\r\ninstead of a campaign against a formidable rebel, was a relief to\r\nthe way-worn soldiers; but what thought the commander of it? It is\r\nnot satisfying to a sane man's pride to beat the air, or charge on a\r\nwindmill. A traitor to crush, or a fair city to conquer, would have been\r\nrefreshing pastime to Cortés at this juncture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESPERATE SITUATION OF THE COLONISTS.]\r\n\r\nIn advance of the army, and almost alone, he set out for Nito. If he\r\nentered not as a conqueror with sword in hand, he had at least the\r\nsatisfaction of being welcomed as a savior. Malaria was there, and had\r\nso reduced the settlement that the frown of the natives loomed over\r\nit like Erinnyan phantoms. There were but three score Spaniards with\r\na few women,[XIX-1] the greater number so reduced by fever and other\r\nailments as hardly to be able to move, and all suffering from poor and\r\ninsufficient food—zapotes, vegetables, and fish. Without sufficient arms\r\nand without horses, they did not venture abroad to forage, and seeing\r\nthat death would surely overtake all if they remained, the able-bodied\r\nmen under the leadership of Diego Nieto were repairing a vessel in\r\nwhich to depart.[XIX-2] The disappearance of the four men captured by\r\nSandoval created no small alarm. Were they after all to be overwhelmed\r\nby avenging natives? Amidst such troubles no wonder that the appearance\r\nof Cortés was greeted as a descent from heaven, and that even men wept\r\nas they thronged round to kiss his hand.\r\n\r\nThe army was not a little surprised at the destitution of the famed\r\nHonduras. While ministering consolation, Cortés sent out bands of\r\nforagers. One of the parties ascended the Rio Yasa,[XIX-3] and coming\r\nto a deserted hamlet, six leagues from the mouth, took refuge from the\r\nrain. But it was not long before a band of Indians set upon them, and\r\nbadly wounded they were driven to the boats, glad to escape with life.\r\nAnother party found a path leading to a well-provided pueblo called\r\nLequela, but it was eighteen leagues away, and too far for carriers. A\r\nthird division met with better success.[XIX-4]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a vessel appeared in the harbor, having on board thirty\r\nSpaniards, beside the crew, and laden with a dozen horses, over seventy\r\nhogs, and provisions. It seemed a miracle. And the whole equipment\r\nCortés bought for four thousand pesos.[XIX-5] Welcome as this was to\r\nthe starving settlement, the sudden change in diet cost the lives of\r\nseveral persons. The site of Nito being so unhealthy and ill-provided,\r\nit was resolved to abandon the place, and Sandoval was sent with the\r\ngreater number of soldiers, settlers, and Indians, to the fertile valley\r\nof Naco, Olid's abandoned headquarters, twenty leagues off, on the road\r\nto which several well-supplied pueblos offered good halting-places.\r\n\r\nWith the newly arrived vessel, a repaired caravel and a brigantine,\r\nbuilt from some wrecks, Cortés prepared to take the remainder of the\r\nparty by sea to a better locality. But first he would ascend the wide\r\noutlet lately crossed for food, for in this direction some captives\r\nassured him he would find rich settlements.[XIX-6] Exploration also\r\nimpelled him to this quarter, for it was reported that when Gil Gonzalez\r\nfirst arrived here he had detached a vessel for the examination of this\r\nentrance; which had traversed two fresh-water gulfs; but the ascent of\r\na tributary beyond had been prevented by strong currents and warlike\r\nnatives.[XIX-7]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAPTURE OF PUEBLOS.]\r\n\r\nManning the new brigantine with forty chosen Spaniards and a number\r\nof Indians, and attended by boats, Cortés ascended the Rio Dulce, and\r\nspeedily entered a sheet of water some twelve leagues in circumference,\r\nwithout settlements. Continuing south-west, he went through a long\r\npassage into another larger sheet of water lying amidst lofty ranges and\r\nmost bewitching scenery. Inspired by the wild grandeur around him, he\r\nalready fancied himself the laurel-crowned discoverer of the long-sought\r\nstrait. But the dream was brief, for the water proved to be a gulf, some\r\nthirty leagues in circumference, and called Apolochic in the vernacular.\r\nLeaving the vessel at its western end, near the mouth of a stream, he\r\nproceeded with most of the men, under a local guide, over a rough route\r\nintersected by innumerable creeks. After a march of twelve leagues,\r\nduring which only one village of any importance was seen, he came to a\r\npueblo in which loud singing with instrumental accompaniment indicated\r\na festival. Waiting till a late hour, when all was quiet, he fell upon\r\nthe sleeping natives, and but for the excited exclamation of a soldier\r\nthe place would have been taken without a blow. As it was, the cacique\r\nhad time to rally, and in the melée which followed he with several\r\nothers lost his life. Forty captives were here secured. Cortés was now\r\nguided to a larger pueblo, called Chacujal, eight leagues further, and\r\nagain resorted to a night attack, but did not gain the place without\r\nconsiderable resistance. By morning the Indians had fled. The buildings,\r\nparticularly the temples, resembled very much those of Mexico, but the\r\nlanguage differed as well from the Mexican as from that of the pueblos\r\nhitherto met with. Among the captives was an Indian from the Pacific\r\nslope, who reported that only three-score leagues intervened between\r\nNito and his country, where Alvarado was conquering.\r\n\r\nThe place was abundantly provided with cotton goods, maize, the\r\nmuch-needed salt, and other articles, and since it lay near the Polochic\r\nRiver, which entered the gulf twenty leagues from where the vessel lay,\r\nmessengers were sent to bring it as far up the stream as possible to\r\nreceive supplies. Meanwhile four rafts were made, and loaded each with\r\nforty fanegas of maize, besides beans, cocoa, and other provisions.\r\nThese operations occupied nearly three weeks, during which time none\r\nof the natives could be induced to return and aid in the work.[XIX-8]\r\nCortés now embarked with ten men on the rafts, sending the rest down\r\nby land. The current carried them rapidly past the winding banks,\r\nwith their alternate forest and prairie land, relieved here and\r\nthere by hamlets and plantations, half hidden amidst cocoa groves and\r\nfruit-trees. Nothing unusual occurred till night, when Cortés, who\r\noccupied the last raft, was startled by cries of alarm from the one\r\nbefore him, followed by Indian yells. It was too dark to distinguish\r\nanything, but the men prepared for what might come. The next moment\r\nthe raft struck violently against a projecting rock, and a shower of\r\narrows fell. Several warriors now attempted to board, but they either\r\nmiscalculated the distance, or were pushed overboard by the crew. The\r\nIndians had foreseen the opportunity which the rock would afford for\r\nan attack, but the rafts escaped them, although most of the Spaniards\r\nwere wounded, including the general, and half a cargo was damaged. So\r\nrapid was the current that the twenty leagues were made by morning. More\r\nsupplies were obtained from other settlements, and on returning to Nito\r\nafter an absence of five weeks, sufficient food was brought to fairly\r\nsupply the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe whole colony, including Gonzalez' men, now embarked in the three\r\nvessels and proceeded to San Andrés Bay, or Caballos, where a number\r\nof Sandoval's soldiers had just arrived. The site seemed to be all\r\nthat could be desired, \"with the best port on the entire coast from\r\nthe Pearl Islands to Florida,\" with fine indications of gold in the\r\ntributary rivers, and with a beautiful and well-settled neighborhood.\r\nA colony was accordingly founded there under the name of Natividad de\r\nNuestra Señora, from the day of founding, and fifty settlers were left,\r\nchiefly Gonzalez' men and late arrivals from Spain, Diego de Godoy\r\nbeing appointed commander, with the necessary officials. A church was\r\nalso built and placed in charge of a clergyman. Soon, however, the\r\nunhealthiness of the site became apparent, and half the settlers died.\r\nThe Indians grew insolent and refused supplies, and threatened the\r\ndestruction of the settlement. Cortés thereupon permitted the colonists\r\nto join the prosperous establishment at Naco. Here the Indians had been\r\ngradually reassured and conciliated by Sandoval, whose armed incursions\r\nhad already reduced a number of pueblos of considerable size and\r\nwealth.[XIX-9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AT TRUJILLO.]\r\n\r\nCortés had meanwhile sailed to Trujillo, where the delighted colonists\r\nrushed into the water to carry the renowned chief ashore. His first and\r\ncharacteristic act was to enter the church and give thanks for safe\r\narrival.[XIX-10] Then came the exercise of clemency for which he was\r\nhumbly besought by the late adherents of Olid. Matters had been going\r\nsmoothly since Ruano was exiled, and the general was too prudent to stir\r\nup animosity. With some slight reconstruction, therefore, the orders\r\nand arrangements of Casas were confirmed. An impulse was given to the\r\ntown, and with the enforced aid of native laborers lots were cleared\r\nand buildings erected.\r\n\r\nThe four vessels now in port were not allowed to lie idle. One was\r\ndespatched to Mexico with the invalids, and with letters for the\r\nofficials, wherein Cortés commended their zeal for the government,\r\nand promised soon to return. Juan de Ávalos, his cousin, was placed in\r\ncommand, and ordered to pick up at Cozumel Island the party of Spaniards\r\nleft there by Valenzuela. This was done, but on approaching Cuba the\r\nvessel was wrecked at Cape San Antonio, with the loss of the captain,\r\ntwo friars, and over thirty others. Of the rest only fifteen survived\r\nto reach Guaniguanico.[XIX-11] Of the other vessels, the new brigantine\r\nwas sent to Española to report to the oidores concerning the overland\r\nexpedition and the state of affairs in Honduras, and to represent that\r\nthe kidnapping raid by Moreno was creating trouble among the natives.\r\nThe authorities ordered the captives to be returned.[XIX-12] The two\r\nremaining vessels were despatched to Cuba and Jamaica with the plate\r\nand jewels of Cortés to purchase provisions, live stock, and plants\r\nwherewith to improve the colony.\r\n\r\nOne of these ships, in touching at Cuba, found there a vessel from Santo\r\nDomingo, destined by the oidores for Mexico to gain positive information\r\nabout the rumored death of Cortés, and to report on measures against\r\nthe disorders that might follow. Learning that the conqueror was alive\r\nand in Honduras, the messenger of the oidores resolved at once to change\r\nthe route to Honduras, where his cargo of horses and stores would also\r\nfind a readier market.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BAD NEWS FROM MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nLicenciado Zuazo, the most honorable and trusted of the administrators\r\nappointed by Cortés over Mexico, had been arrested by his colleagues\r\nfor opposing their nefarious plans, and sent out of the way to Cuba.\r\nThese men had not only seized on the administrative power for their own\r\nadvancement, to the neglect of public welfare, but, believing the mighty\r\nconqueror and his companions in arms to be dead, they had laid hands on\r\ntheir estates, and were persecuting their friends and whosoever ventured\r\nto protest. The country was in a most critical condition. Anarchy and\r\nspoliation were the order of the day. The colonists were arrayed in\r\nopposition to each other, and the Indians found every encouragement\r\nfor rising against their white oppressors and blotting them out of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAll this was reported by Zuazo in a letter to Cortés, with the most\r\nearnest pleading for his immediate return, ere it was too late.[XIX-13]\r\nCortés was at first furious; then he melted into tears at the thought\r\nof the desolation wrought by his enemies and at the inhuman persecution\r\nof his followers. \"It serves me right,\" he said, in a calmer moment,\r\n\"to be thus treated for placing trust in strangers and ignoring tried\r\ncomrades.\"[XIX-14] The news reached him at an unfavorable time. The\r\niron will and nerve which had carried the leader through the hardships\r\nof the march, had begun to yield to the insidious influence of the\r\nfever-infected bottom-lands of the Amatique Bay, assisted perhaps by\r\ndisappointment at finding the first aspect of Honduras so far below his\r\nhopes. The letter served to rouse his bodily as well as mental energies,\r\nthough not to that point of clear and prompt determination which had\r\nhitherto characterized his acts. He was irresolute. Honduras had been\r\nlittle explored, and the indication of gold near Caballos, though small,\r\nled him still to dwell on the stories of richer districts to the south.\r\nHe feared to abandon a yet promising field, after the efforts lavished\r\non it, and in view of the eager advance of his southern rival, him of\r\nPanamá.\r\n\r\nThe fortunate predictions of a soldier-astrologer in Mexico would not\r\nhave made him disinclined, in his present frame of mind, to encourage\r\nsimilar counsellors; but no Sabean was at hand to interpret the\r\nscintillating oracles. The friars were directed to appeal to the supreme\r\nthrone, and for three days services were held, with processions, and\r\nmasses, and prayers for divine direction. Already during the progress\r\nof these appeals, Cortés felt a dawning inspiration in a renewed\r\ncourage to face the treacherous sea, and stronger inclination to\r\ntrust the development of the province to another. He would return to\r\nMexico. Hernando Saavedra, his cousin, was appointed captain-general of\r\nHonduras,[XIX-15] and Sandoval was directed to proceed with his company\r\nfrom Naco to Mexico, by the Guatemala route already opened by Casas.\r\nHe himself embarked on the government vessel, but at the moment of\r\ndeparture the wind failed, and hearing of a tumult among the colonists\r\nhe landed to restore order. The unruly spirits appear to have been\r\ndisappointed office-seekers, to whom the obscurity of official existence\r\nin a border province seemed a most ungracious return for their long\r\ntoil. The general calmed the leading rioters by taking them on board\r\nto receive their reward in Mexico. Two days later he set sail, only to\r\nmeet another check in the breakage of the main lateen yard just outside\r\nthe harbor. After three days spent in repairs he again departed, with\r\na good wind, but this soon increased to a gale, and fifty leagues from\r\nport the mast went overboard and obliged him to return for a third time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TIRED OF THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nSurely, this was a warning from providence not to proceed. He must have\r\nmisunderstood the inspiration, and would seek more correct advice. Upon\r\none thing he was determined, not again to trust himself to the billows.\r\nThe last tossings had cured him of nautical aspirations, and threatened\r\nindeed to cure him of all others, for his already weakened body was left\r\nin so racked a condition as to bring him near to death. Bernal Diaz\r\ndescribes him as a mere shadow of his former self, and states that a\r\nFranciscan robe had been prepared to shroud his body, and by its saving\r\nvirtues to assist the soul through purgatory.[XIX-16] But, although the\r\nconqueror of Mexico had filled the measure of his great achievements,\r\nthe cup of honors and of disappointments was not yet full. Masses\r\nhad again been said to sanctify as inspiration his changing resolve.\r\nThe vessel proceeded, however, bearing a trusted servant[XIX-17] with\r\nletters for a number of friends in Mexico, and with orders revoking the\r\npower granted to the usurping governors in favor of more reliable men.\r\nA number of Mexican chiefs accompanied the messenger to testify that\r\nCortés still lived. They were to proceed to Pánuco after landing the\r\nservant in some obscure haven above Vera Cruz, whence he was to proceed\r\nalone and in disguise to Mexico, so as to elude any watching enemies.\r\nSandoval was recalled, greatly to the disappointment of his party, who\r\nrose almost in open mutiny at being kept away from their estates in\r\nMexico, which were by this time exposed to ruin in hands of strangers\r\nand usurpers.[XIX-18]\r\n\r\nAn additional excuse for the determination to remain may have been found\r\nin the hostile attitude of two provinces, Papayeca and Chapagua, some\r\nseven leagues from Trujillo.[XIX-19] Some time before this Saavedra had\r\nbeen sent to explore the valley above, and following it for some thirty\r\nleagues found a fertile district with a series of flourishing pueblos.\r\nA score of caciques appeared to offer their allegiance to Cortés, and\r\ninto Trujillo flowed provisions and presents. The above-named provinces\r\nalone held aloof, pleading not without reason former maltreatment and\r\nthe kidnapping of tribal members by Fiscal Moreno. No excuses could,\r\nhowever, be regarded as valid in refusing allegiance, and Saavedra\r\nmarched against them. The people retired to the hills; but three of the\r\nChapagua caciques being captured and peremptorily given a fixed term\r\nin which to repeople their towns, the submission of this province was\r\nspeedily effected. Papayeca was now entered, and Pizacura, one of the\r\ntwo principal caciques, was captured. He threw the blame of resistance\r\non his more powerful colleague, Mazatl, offering if released to secure\r\nand hang him, and thus bring the people over. Once free, the cacique\r\ncast the promise to the winds as readily as any Spaniard. Mazatl was\r\ncaptured, nevertheless, and given the alternative of repeopling the\r\ntowns or dying. The chief disdainfully rejected an offer to purchase\r\nlife with what he regarded as the enslavement of his people, and calmly\r\naccepted death.\r\n\r\nThis severity was thought to be prudent, and it certainly had the\r\neffect of bringing the inhabitants back to all the pueblos save the\r\ncapital. Here Pizacura held forth, supposing, no doubt, that since his\r\nescapade no pardon was to be expected. He was soon captured, however,\r\ntogether with over a hundred followers. The latter were enslaved for\r\ntheir obstinacy, while he, with two other caciques, and a youth who\r\nappears to have been the true chief of the province, were kept as\r\nprisoners.[XIX-20]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PACIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY.]\r\n\r\nThis success, as well as the comparatively kind treatment of the\r\nnatives, tended greatly to promote the pacification of the country, and\r\nthe name of Cortés became feared and respected far and wide.[XIX-21]\r\nOne instance of this was the arrival of a deputation from the Gulf\r\nIslands, appealing to his power and clemency for protection against a\r\nslaving party which was raiding Guanaja. Cortés at once despatched a\r\ncaravel which brought in the vessel with its slaves, destined for the\r\nmines of Cuba and Jamaica. The commander, Rodrigo de Merlo, exhibited\r\na license for his expedition, so that severe measures could not well\r\nbe taken, but means were found to persuade the captain to settle at\r\nTrujillo with his crew. The kidnapped islanders were restored to their\r\ngrateful friends. They sent in their allegiance and received letters\r\nof protection, together with a number of swine which soon multiplied on\r\nthe islands.[XIX-22]\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the influence of Cortés' name was afforded by the\r\nentry, from Nicaragua into Olancho[XIX-23] province, of an expedition\r\nunder Gabriel de Rojas, consisting of sixty men with twenty horses.\r\nThe natives resisted, no doubt, whereupon Rojas began to enslave and\r\npillage. A deputation arriving at Trujillo to implore protection,\r\nSandoval was instructed to interfere on behalf of the natives, as\r\nsubjects of Cortés.[XIX-24] His force was insufficient, it seems, to\r\ndrive out the intruders, but Rojas nevertheless retired by order of\r\nCórdoba.[XIX-25]\r\n\r\nOne reason for this withdrawal was that Córdoba could not afford to\r\nplace himself in hostile attitude to any neighbor. One of the acts of\r\nMoreno during his arbitrary proceeding in Honduras had been to urge\r\nupon him to transfer his allegiance and province to the audiencia.\r\nThis prompting found a willing ear. Blind to the accumulative evidence\r\nof failure, and untaught by disappointment, Córdoba allowed the few\r\ninstances of successful revolt to overshadow every failure. He looked\r\nupon the force around him, and measuring the distance between himself\r\nand the grim Pedrarias, his dread grew fainter as the leagues increased;\r\nmeanwhile hope kept whispering, might he not also become another Cortés,\r\nborne aloft by fame, or at least a Velazquez safe upon his usurped\r\nisland? He wavered, and yielded. In maturing his plans for a step so\r\nfull of risk, he resolved to learn further from Moreno what authority\r\nhe possessed, and perfect arrangements with him. Pedro de Garro[XIX-26]\r\nwas accordingly sent with a party of forty men to Honduras, bearing\r\nalso petitions to the emperor and audiencia, and with instructions\r\nto explore the best route to a port in that province through which\r\nsupplies and war material might be procured. Sandoval, on hearing of\r\ntheir approach, captured them, together with their retinue of beautiful\r\nwomen and numerous servants, but allowed a few under escort to proceed\r\nto Trujillo. Cortés received them with good-will, and as a proof thereof\r\nordered four pack animals to be sent laden with horseshoes, mining\r\ntools, and other articles, as a present to Córdoba. But he could not\r\ncountenance the overthrowal of a chief by a subordinate officer; for\r\nhad not his present expedition been made to punish a similar attempt? He\r\nwrote him accordingly, advising fidelity to Pedrarias, and promising his\r\naid in procuring supplies through Honduras, since Panamá, was regarded\r\nas too distant.[XIX-27]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEMPTATION.]\r\n\r\nThis intercourse had served to enlighten Cortés in regard to the\r\ncondition and resources of the country to the south and south-west. He\r\nhad learned that it was fertile and populous, filled with flourishing\r\ntowns, and giving great promise of mineral wealth; facts confirmed by\r\nthe splendid retinue of Garro and the demand for mining implements.\r\nPerhaps in this very country lay the rich provinces which had stirred\r\nhis imagination, even before the fall of Mexico, and for which he had\r\ncome in search this long way. Should he allow an interloper to deprive\r\nhim of what his fancy had claimed all these years, and what had enticed\r\nhim to superhuman efforts? But a valid excuse was needed for seizing\r\na province already held by another, a king's lieutenant like himself.\r\nCortés was too astute, however, not to find a way to prevent so rich a\r\nprize from eluding him. Was it out of friendship for a stranger that he\r\nhad sent valuable presents to Córdoba, and offered to forward supplies\r\nthrough Honduras? No, he knew where to sow in order to reap. He had\r\nalso written, as he admits, to some officers in Nicaragua whom he knew,\r\nand what subtle poison may not have been diffused by craftily worded\r\nadvice. Córdoba understood the hint for himself, and was confirmed in\r\nhis resolve. But his fellow-soldiers had also a word to say. The idea\r\nof risking life and fortune for the ambitious plans of a captain who was\r\nlittle, if anything, more than themselves, was by no means to the liking\r\nof all the officers. Several objected, and since it was now too late to\r\nretreat Córdoba must even persuade them by arms. Civil war threatened,\r\nand the news was not long in reaching Trujillo. Indeed, it seems that\r\nthe rebel leader, on finding what a tempest he had invoked, sent to\r\ntender allegiance to Cortés.[XIX-28] And then the latter reasoned\r\nwith himself. Could he, an imperial officer, stand calmly by and see\r\nhis Majesty's interests sacrificed and his subjects, his countrymen,\r\nslaughtered? No, certainly not; and he congratulated himself upon the\r\nsuccess of his plans. Here was the longed-for pretence, cast in his\r\nway by fortune. He must pounce upon the prize while the claimants were\r\nabsorbed in contention.[XIX-29] The first step was to direct a large\r\nforce of natives to open a road to Nicaragua, and Sandoval received\r\norders to prepare for the expedition.[XIX-30]\r\n\r\nAgain it seemed as if the great leader had misinterpreted the signs of\r\nprovidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASSUMES GREATER POMP.]\r\n\r\nHis messenger to Mexico had safely arrived, and with prudent management\r\na reaction had been started in favor of Cortés; the evidence that he\r\nwas alive was half the battle; but his enemies, though checked, were not\r\noverthrown, and believing that everything depended upon his presence it\r\nwas decided to recall him. The commission was intrusted to his cousin,\r\nFray Diego Altamirano, an ex-soldier who had doffed the helmet for a\r\nFranciscan cowl, and a man of honor and business talent.[XIX-31] He\r\nfell like a bomb-shell on the manifold projects of Cortés for conquest\r\nand aggrandizement, which, if encouraged by one success, might have\r\nborne the victor triumphantly southward, perhaps to the realms of the\r\nIncas. Altamirano was not a man to let the stern present be obscured\r\nby the glowing fancies of enthusiasm. His visions turned alone toward\r\nMexico, and his coloring was reserved for painting the sad condition\r\nof its affairs. This he did, boldly, yet with loving discreetness, and\r\nconvinced his kinsman that return to Mexico was absolutely necessary to\r\nsave himself, his friends, and the country from ruin. He also insisted\r\nthat in order to succeed in controlling followers he must assert his\r\ndignity, and impose on the vulgar by an intimidating and awe-inspiring\r\npomp. The familiarity grown out of the fellowship of the camp and the\r\ntoil of the march might answer in a border province, but not in the\r\nwell-settled districts of New Spain, or at the court of Mexico. More\r\ndignity should be assumed at once; here and now must he teach his\r\nfollowers the distance between the governor and the subject, and demand\r\nreverence as his due. There was not much need for exhortation in this\r\nrespect, for pomp came naturally to Cortés. Readily, therefore, did he\r\nmount the gubernatorial seat with its imposing dais, and receive with\r\na complacent smile the _señoría_[XIX-32] from the lips of the deeply\r\nbowing suite. In church, even, he occupied the higher level of the\r\nraised _sitial_,[XIX-33] while abroad the cannon belched forth in his\r\nhonor.[XIX-34]\r\n\r\nHis distrust of the sea remained, and he determined to return through\r\nGuatemala. The laborers, therefore, were taken from the Nicaragua road\r\nto prepare the way for him;[XIX-35] but finally the pilots convinced him\r\nthat at this season of the year the winds and currents were favorable,\r\nwhile the land route must be long and full of obstacles. He accordingly\r\nembarked in three vessels with twenty Spanish followers and their\r\nhorses, and some two hundred Indians under Prince Ixtlilxochitl, setting\r\nsail April 25, 1526.[XIX-36] Sandoval joined him, but his company went\r\noverland. Saavedra remained as his lieutenant, with instructions to\r\nmaintain native loyalty by good treatment, and to promote settlement.\r\nThe general's yet wavering confidence in the sea received another\r\nshock off the very coast of New Spain, whence a gale drove him back\r\nand compelled him to seek refuge in Cuba. On the 16th of May he again\r\nset sail, and landed a week later near the present Vera Cruz. The news\r\nof his arrival spread rapidly, and soldiers, colonists, and natives\r\nhastened forward in throngs to bear the beloved leader, the mighty\r\nMalinche, in triumph to the island city which he had won and refounded.\r\nDoubts were dissipated and past disappointments forgotten as he gazed\r\nonce more on the scenes of his brilliant achievements, and drank the\r\nplaudits of the multitude.[XIX-37]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPEDRARIAS REMOVES TO NICARAGUA.\r\n\r\n1525-1527.\r\n\r\n     CÓRDOBA MEDITATES REVOLT—SOTO AND COMPAÑON OBJECT—THEIR\r\n     FLIGHT—PEDRARIAS NURSES HIS WRATH—SECRET MOTIVES FOR HIS\r\n     DEPARTURE FOR NICARAGUA—CÓRDOBA LOSES HIS HEAD—THE GOVERNOR\r\n     COVETS HONDURAS, AND COMES TO BLOWS—THE INDIANS FOLLOW\r\n     THE EXAMPLE—BLOODY SCENES—PEDRARIAS INTERRUPTED IN HIS\r\n     REVERIE—PEDRO DE LOS RIOS SUCCEEDS AS GOVERNOR AT PANAMÁ—HIS\r\n     INSTRUCTIONS AND POLICY—RESIDENCIA OF PEDRARIAS—TRIUMPHANT\r\n     RESULT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CÓRDOBA MEDITATES.]\r\n\r\nWith the departure of Cortés in drooping plumes, his pretentious\r\nprojects for dominion in the south received a check, and the portentous\r\nclouds which had before loomed over Honduras again darkened the sky,\r\nextending over the adjoining lake province, there to threaten Córdoba's\r\nbright visions of independence. One can hardly blame the lieutenant for\r\nindulging his imagination with the alluring prospects of power, wealth,\r\nand fame, when kept in subjection on the one side by so unlovable a\r\nmaster as Pedrarias, and when prompted on the other by the powerful\r\naudiencia of Santo Domingo to cast off the unrighteous allegiance. With\r\nhis mind thus predisposed, Córdoba saw clearly that Nicaragua could not\r\npermanently pertain to the jurisdiction of Panamá. It was a distinct\r\nprovince, conquered and abandoned by Gil Gonzalez, and now brought into\r\nresubjection by his own efforts and talents. If any one disputed his\r\nposition he could point to the authorization of the audiencia. True, the\r\nfleet and men, the means and influence, used in effecting the reconquest\r\npertained to his late chief. What of that? The ships did not belong to\r\nPedrarias; the old governor had taken them in direct disobedience to the\r\norders of the king. As for the money and the men, all had been obtained\r\nby vile indirection, and might as well be made to serve one traitor as\r\nanother. But he was no traitor to the king who responded to the will of\r\nthe king's audiencia.\r\n\r\nThere was much in common between the revolts of Olid and Córdoba, but\r\nthe motives of the leaders differed. The former, bold, brave, and in\r\nthe main true, had felt aggrieved that so broad a portion of the earth\r\nshould fall to the lot of one man, whose pretensions thereto grew out of\r\nhis accidental position as commander, while he, a captain who had shared\r\nevery danger and hardship in the grand conquest, must be content forever\r\nto serve. The sole command of a small portion of disputed territory he\r\nhad deemed a recompense small enough beside the imperial reward of his\r\ncommander. Hernandez de Córdoba viewed matters from a somewhat different\r\nstand-point, though with an abundance of plausible excuses. He was an\r\ninstrument chosen by Pedrarias to wrest a fair domain from the rightful\r\nconqueror. In this selection Pedrarias had been governed by his usual\r\nnarrow policy. Throughout his whole career he could not abandon the vain\r\nattempt to accomplish great results by small means, and noble results\r\nby base means.\r\n\r\nWith such incentives and precepts Córdoba found little difficulty\r\nin disposing of the moral obstacles to his scheme, and on turning\r\ntoward the material he saw nothing insurmountable, since most of the\r\nmen were favorably disposed. In this there was nothing strange, for\r\nCórdoba was generous and confiding, and by the side of Pedrarias such\r\nqualities shone with double lustre. As a first step he called on the\r\nsettlers, particularly of Leon and Granada, to petition the king for\r\nhis appointment as independent governor.[XX-1] None objected save a\r\ndozen men headed by the captains Soto and Compañon. Loyalty had probably\r\nnothing to do with their opposition, but rather jealousy. They would\r\nnot risk their liberty and prospects to raise so much above themselves a\r\nfellow officer who could never be in their eyes more able and deserving\r\nthan themselves.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances of these few persons were not to be regarded, however,\r\nand retreat for Córdoba was in any case too late. Soto, the first to\r\nobject, was cast into the fortress of Granada, but Compañon, with a few\r\nfaithful comrades, broke open the prison and liberated him. The little\r\nband, well armed and mounted, then took the field against Córdoba and\r\nopenly bade him defiance. Córdoba recognized that prompt action was\r\nindispensable, and set forth in pursuit. Though Soto and Compañon failed\r\nto gain more adherents, as they had expected, they nevertheless took\r\na stand near Granada against the usurper's formidable force, warning\r\nhim that all their efforts, in case of attack, would be concentrated on\r\nkilling him.[XX-2] The lieutenant hesitated. He well knew the determined\r\ncharacter of his late officers, and pictured himself the target of\r\ntheir unerring missiles. The golden visions of his hopes became dimmer.\r\nHe would like to be a governor, but he did not wish to be killed; and\r\nnot possessing the spirit of greatness, he readily found an excuse\r\nfor returning whence he came, while Soto with his gallant ten thought\r\nit profitable to acquaint Pedrarias and receive from him the reward\r\nof loyal servants. The journey back to Panamá was not easy, with its\r\nrugged mountains, impetuous streams, and pathless forests, while hostile\r\nnatives, venomous animals, and gnawing hunger added to the hardships\r\nserious danger; nevertheless they would undertake it, and make a portion\r\nof their way by sea. Soon after starting they found their horses an\r\nencumbrance rather than an aid, and therefore they abandoned them.\r\nBarefooted and dilapidated they reached the town of Fonseca,[XX-3] in\r\nChiriquí, where Hurtado, the founder, relieved them, and provided a\r\ncanoe in which to pursue the journey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOTO AND HURTADO.]\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Soto southward, the good Hurtado pondered over\r\nthe situation. The rebel Córdoba, in common with Soto and the others,\r\nhe held in low esteem. If with his small force he could not conquer\r\nhim, he believed he could frighten the man greatly; at all events, here\r\nwas an opportunity to gain favor with Pedrarias. He accordingly armed\r\nall the able-bodied men at his command and marched against the rebels,\r\nleaving the sick and helpless to ward off famine and the natives as best\r\nthey might. After waiting some time in vain for the return of Hurtado,\r\nthe abandoned remnant deserted the post and set out in search of him,\r\ndirecting their steps toward the gulf of Nicoya.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Soto and his party reached Natá and sent their report\r\nto Panamá. Rage in the breasts of some men consumes both body and soul;\r\nbut such was the nature of Pedrarias that the essence of his life\r\nappeared to be drawn from inexhaustible wells of vindictive spleen.\r\nAlthough approaching the time when most men die, the castigation of a\r\ntraitorous lieutenant was too choice a morsel to intrust to another; and\r\nso, belting in his wrath, he prepared at once to march against him. To\r\nthis he was impelled also by a desire to forestall any attempt on the\r\npart of the conqueror of Mexico, whose projects were even then casting a\r\nportentous shadow over the smiling shores of the Freshwater Sea. A still\r\ndeeper impulse, however, was the looming spectre of a new governor,\r\nwith orders for a residencia, which once instituted might prevent his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nTo defray the expenses of the expedition Pedrarias was obliged not\r\nonly to employ his own fortune but to borrow large sums from the\r\nhouse-holders and merchants. This he did, agreeing to share with them\r\nthe profits of the adventure. He was shrewd enough to conceal how much\r\na prospective successor and residencia had to do with his departure;\r\nand believing that the object was solely to secure for the benefit of\r\nPanamá, from a strange invader and rebel, the gold-seamed Nicaragua with\r\nits budding colonies and trade, the people were quite eager to aid him\r\nin so promising and loyal a scheme. Panamá and Natá had already been\r\ndrained of able-bodied men by the expeditions under Pizarro and Almagro\r\nwhich were to yield such brilliant results, and Pedrarias was obliged\r\nto draw upon Acla and Nombre de Dios for soldiers. This additional\r\nlevy so nearly depopulated the province that its four cities together\r\ncould hardly muster occupants enough for 'a mediocre hamlet,' as Oviedo\r\nexpresses it. A large number of Indians were also taken. The departure\r\nof the fleet took place in January, 1526.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCórdoba had not been comfortable since Soto's escape. The more he\r\npondered the shorter to his mind grew the distance between himself and\r\nthe grim Pedrarias. In his fear he bethought himself of Cortés, and\r\nsent to offer him the province on condition that he should retain the\r\ncommand as his lieutenant; for it was far better to be subject to the\r\nmagnanimous conqueror of Anáhuac, whose name would prove a safeguard\r\nagainst his old master, while his distant residence in Mexico might\r\nleave a lieutenant almost wholly independent. This scheme received an\r\nencouraging acceptance, as we have seen, only to be abandoned before\r\nthe urgent appeals from Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXECUTION OF CÓRDOBA.]\r\n\r\nThe more than peculiar conduct of Córdoba on meeting Soto has prepared\r\nus for almost any pusillanimity on his part. Either a blind reliance in\r\nCortés made him careless, or the arrival at Leon of the hoary-headed\r\nPedrarias was unexpectedly sudden; it seems at any rate that he did\r\nnot even attempt to defend himself. Probably the settlers had become\r\ndisgusted with his want of courage and failed to support him. All we\r\nlearn is that he and his friends humbly met the governor and sought\r\nto deny their guilt, pleading, as in the case of Vasco Nuñez, that had\r\nmutinous intentions been entertained they would not thus have dared to\r\ncome forward unarmed, but would have fled or defended themselves. The\r\ncase was too clear, however, and Pedrarias never forgave: the head of\r\nCórdoba was required as a lesson to similar aspirants.[XX-4]\r\n\r\nHaving thus removed his rebellious subordinate, Pedrarias looked about\r\nto secure the permanent government of the province and extend his\r\njurisdiction as best he might. If Nicaragua belonged to Castilla del\r\nOro, as he of course maintained, so must the eastern and north-eastern\r\nextension of this region, as far at least as the gulf of Honduras,\r\nclearly the natural boundary. The efforts of Gil Gonzalez to secure\r\nHonduras showed that he had also regarded this province as pertaining\r\nto Nicaragua. But above all, was not the dreaded Cortés away, and was\r\nnot his lieutenant, Saavedra, in command of a mere handful of men? What\r\nmore convincing evidence of his right could there be? But even under\r\nthese circumstances caution was necessary, and he resolved to secure at\r\nfirst only the adjoining border territory. With this object captains\r\nHurtado and Rojas were sent to occupy Olancho Valley. The natives had\r\ntoo vivid a recollection of the former invasion under Rojas to feel\r\nsafe, and hastened to Trujillo with their complaints. Saavedra, who\r\nsaw the danger of countenancing encroachments from such a quarter, sent\r\ntwo envoys[XX-5] to demand the immediate withdrawal of the Nicaraguan\r\ntroops. Pedrarias was not unprepared for this, and smooth and evasive\r\nwas his answer. For the sake of peace he would come to an understanding\r\nwith Cortés regarding his pretensions in that quarter, and submit the\r\nwhole matter to the decision of the audiencia. Meanwhile there must be\r\nno fighting or attempted overreaching among countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe tone and manner of the old courtier would have convinced more\r\nexperienced men than the Honduras envoys, and with satisfied hearts they\r\nturned to bear the peaceful message to their chief. Pedrarias gained his\r\npoint. He never entertained the idea of writing to Cortés or submitting\r\nany question to the audiencia.\r\n\r\nFresh instructions were at once despatched to Hurtado and Rojas, and\r\nwhile the envoys were lulling Saavedra into fancied security they fell\r\nupon his adherents in Olancho, routed them, and secured their effects.\r\nThe victors then proceeded northward with a view to occupy Natividad\r\nand secure for their chief a much needed port on the North Sea, through\r\nwhich to receive supplies and maintain communication with Spain and the\r\nIslands, for the Panamá route was too long and costly. Informed of their\r\nmovements Saavedra sent a force to intercept them. The captains were not\r\njust then prepared to resist so strong a body, and like their master\r\nthey resorted to fair words, both sides promising to return peaceably\r\nhome. But neither believed in these assurances, and each resolved to\r\nwatch the other. Rojas, for that matter, proceeded on the march to\r\nNatividad, while Hurtado returned to Olancho to protect his interests\r\nthere. The Trujillo party pursued the latter, and a fight ensued wherein\r\nthey proved victorious, after losing two men. These broils the natives\r\nobserved, and saw therein their opportunity. They attacked Natividad,\r\nand the Spaniards, driven forth after a fight in which several fell,\r\ntook refuge in a natural stronghold, there to remain until aid could\r\narrive.[XX-6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HURTADO AND GRIJALVA SLAIN.]\r\n\r\nRojas appears to have learned of this uprising in time to retreat to\r\nOlancho; but here also the caciques had mustered in force[XX-7] to\r\navenge the injuries which Pedrarias' soldiers were inflicting. Ordered\r\nby them to bring in maize and material for houses, they seized the\r\nopportunity to introduce within the bundles a quantity of arms. These\r\nwere to serve the natives who remained in or near the camp waiting the\r\napproach of their regularly armed compatriots. All prepared, the word\r\nwas given, and stealthily the dusky foe crept upon the unsuspecting\r\nSpaniards. Living in the midst of treachery, it seems impossible that\r\nthey should have allowed themselves to be thus lulled. Suddenly forest,\r\nhill, and dale were alive with Indians, and the silence was broken by\r\na piercing yell as the first victim met his fate. The signal was taken\r\nup, and from thousands came the avenging shriek, reverberating along the\r\nwooded slopes and rolling back upon the doomed band. Resistance seemed\r\nto avail them little. Sixteen were slain; a few escaped to a friendly\r\ncacique, named Guatucanola; and twenty horses were lost. The settlement\r\nwas sacked and burned. Among the fallen were Captain Hurtado, who had\r\nrendered so many eminent services as explorer, leader, and founder,\r\nand Juan de Grijalva, a man who, as captain of a Cuban expedition,\r\nhad achieved the honor of discovering the Mexican mainland, and who\r\nmight even have gained the glory of that brilliant conquest but for\r\nhis fine sense of honor and other manly qualities. Often a too strict\r\nintegrity impedes the path to greatness. At all events, these qualities\r\nlost him the favor of his master and governor, Velazquez, and despite\r\nhis faithful services, his courage and talent, he was sent forth in\r\ndisgrace, to die ignobly in this wilderness.[XX-8]\r\n\r\nRojas arrived soon after and sought to restore peace, but the natives\r\nwere too strong for him, and for years they held their ground. Saavedra\r\ncharged Pedrarias with being the cause of the disaster, and not without\r\nreason, for the treacherous conduct of his captains had encouraged the\r\nuprising. Quarrels and recriminations followed, but without any attempt\r\non the part of Saavedra to take active steps against the Nicaraguan\r\ninvaders. Finding his adversary so tame, the old governor felt\r\nemboldened to take the step he had so long been meditating, to secure\r\npossession of the remainder of Honduras. To this effect he despatched\r\nCaptain Diego de Albites and Sebastian de Benalcázar, regidores of\r\nLeon, with Notary Espinosa, to demand the submission of Saavedra and\r\nthe cabildo of Trujillo to his jurisdiction. The envoys were hardly on\r\ntheir way, however, before tidings came from Panamá which sent Pedrarias\r\nin all haste back to the Isthmus, leaving the government in the joint\r\ncharge of several of his most trusted officers, among whom Martin Estete\r\nfigured as lieutenant-general.[XX-9]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PEDRO DE LOS RIOS.]\r\n\r\nThe new governor of Castilla del Oro, Pedro de los Rios, had arrived\r\nwith his fleet at Nombre de Dios July 30, 1526,[XX-10] attended, as was\r\ncommon in such cases, by many followers, among whom were Licenciado Juan\r\nde Salmeron, alcalde mayor; Bachiller Diego de Corral; Diego Gutierrez\r\nde los Rios, a nephew, and Egas, the half-brother of the governor.\r\nOviedo was also of the party, bearing as his reward for procuring the\r\nchange of rule the appointment of captain-general and governor of the\r\nprovince of Cartagena. The day following the arrival the new officials\r\nwere sworn in, and within four weeks they had taken up their residence\r\nat Panamá. The jurisdiction of Rios covered the same territory as had\r\nthat of Pedrarias, excepting Paria and Veragua. As usual, he had been\r\nparticularly enjoined to look to the good treatment of the Indians\r\nand promote the formation of towns on healthy sites. In all matters of\r\nimportance he was to consult with the alcalde mayor, as a man learned in\r\nthe law, and a faithful servant of the king. The governor was empowered\r\nto settle all disputes and punish all crimes according to his judgment\r\nand the laws of the country, and with regard to thieves and robbers he\r\nwas recommended to go even somewhat beyond the law. This was a power\r\nadmirably suited for a reformer as Rios came heralded, but the rising\r\nrejoicings of the people at the removal of the old governor began\r\nquickly to calm on finding, as Oviedo says, that in the place of one\r\nhydra head cut off two others had appeared.[XX-11]\r\n\r\nPedro de los Rios was quite a different man from Pedrarias; indeed we\r\nshall scarcely again in this history meet the equal of the old governor\r\nof Darien. Though possessing more bulk of body the new governor lacked\r\nthe strength of mind of the old one; he lacked the cunning, indomitable\r\nenergy, and the vindictive pertinacity of Pedrarias. He loved gold,\r\nhowever, in which predilection he was joined by his wife, who even\r\nsurpassed him in this respect. In accordance with royal orders, among\r\nhis first acts were to seize the effects and estates of Pedrarias,\r\nincluding his encomiendas, to secure control of the Pearl Islands and\r\ntheir revenues, and to hold all until the residencia of the outgoing\r\ngovernor was taken. Pedrarias knew that his authority at Panamá was\r\nlost, but he did not like to lose his property. It was a pecuniary\r\ndisaster alone that could have taken him from Nicaragua at this critical\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe news of his coming was brought by a vessel laden with kidnapped\r\nNicaraguans, to be sold by auction in the Panamá market. He himself\r\nreached Natá in December, and after writing to Rios made his appearance\r\nat the capital February 3, 1527. Three days later the residencia was\r\nproclaimed by Salmeron.\r\n\r\nNot knowing who the judges might be, Pedrarias had taken the precaution\r\nto petition the India Council for power of appeal in any decision which\r\nmight be rendered against him. And this had been granted, with the order\r\nto pay at once any judgment under ten thousand maravedís, and to make a\r\ndeposit which should cover all amounts of larger claims. Further than\r\nthis, he had taken with him to Nicaragua, and had left there, those\r\nwho might most trouble him in his residencia. The greater part of the\r\naggrieved were thus out of the way, and their opportunity lost.\r\n\r\nHe had also despatched Enciso to Spain, to represent his interests at\r\ncourt and neutralize the machinations of his enemies. The result was\r\nthe arrival of a cédula from the king just in time to provide that no\r\nquestions were to be raised in the present residencia touching matters\r\ndisposed of by the pretended investigations under Alarconcillo. This\r\nreduced still further the complaints against Pedrarias, and as he at\r\nonce made overtures to his judge, sparing neither money nor humility,\r\nand as he still had influence, his feebly presented crimes were\r\nlightly regarded. Oviedo deemed himself exceedingly ill used in these\r\nproceedings, and loudly chronicles his complaints. After presenting a\r\nlong list of claims, which were denied, the historian was glad to escape\r\nassassination at the hand of his ancient enemy.[XX-12] Charges of course\r\nwere sent to Spain,[XX-13] citing instances of abuse of power, and of\r\nprivate frauds. Among the more serious accusations was the embezzling of\r\nroyal moneys, which had helped to swell a remittance of seventy thousand\r\npesos de oro, sent secretly to a safe receptacle in Spain. So pressing\r\nand puzzling were these charges that the India Council held repeated\r\nconsultations on the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEFORE THE INDIA COUNCIL.]\r\n\r\nBut Pedrarias had not been idle. He had requested his powerful relatives\r\nto hold forth to the king himself, to the best advantage, the many\r\nvaluable services he had rendered in Africa as well as in the Indies.\r\nThe words of the agent Enciso were likewise powerful, and made these\r\nrecords stand out resplendent, backed as they were with the dazzling\r\ntreasures of the Pearl Islands.[XX-14] Not only was Pedrarias acquitted\r\nand reinstated in his rights and possessions, but new favors were\r\nshowered on him. Yet the government of Panamá could not be restored\r\nto him; indeed the crown itself had not been so blinded as some of its\r\nsatellites to the many evils that had characterized the government of\r\nPedrarias in Castilla del Oro. At all events it was considered timely\r\nto allow the oppressed province to recover from the selfish tyranny of\r\nhis rule under a more fatherly supervision. His shrewd foresight and\r\nusual good fortune were paving a new way, however. It so happened that\r\nGil Gonzalez, the rightful claimant to Nicaragua, died about the time\r\nthat Pedrarias sent in to the king a glowing report on the resources of\r\nthis province, together with promises of great revenues. Not only was\r\nhe now entitled to the first consideration for the post of governor,\r\nbut it was probably considered advantageous to the royal purse that a\r\nman of such natural proclivities for extortion should be given a field\r\nwhere watchful energy alone was needed to develop untold wealth. Again\r\nwas the star of Pedrarias emerging from behind the Hyperborei Montes,\r\nbut with lustre dimmed by clouds rising, this time in the direction of\r\nHonduras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRIVAL GOVERNORS IN HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA.\r\n\r\n1526-1530.\r\n\r\n     COLONIAL POLICY—SALCEDO DISPLACES SAAVEDRA IN THE\r\n     GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS—SAAVEDRA'S ESCAPE—PEDRARIAS'\r\n     ENVOYS TRAPPED—SALCEDO INVADES NICARAGUA—HIS CRUELTY\r\n     AND EXTORTION—DISTRESS AMONG THE COLONISTS—RIOS\r\n     ALSO PRESENTS CLAIMS, BUT IS DISCOMFITED—PEDRARIAS\r\n     FOLLOWS TRIUMPHANT—SALCEDO'S IGNOMINIOUS FATE—ESTETE'S\r\n     EXPEDITION—SLAVE-HUNTING PROFITS AND HORRORS—GLADIATORIAL\r\n     PUNISHMENT OF REVOLTED NATIVES—PEDRARIAS' SCHEMES FOR\r\n     AGGRANDIZEMENT—HE GRASPS AT SALVADOR AND LONGS FOR PERU—BOTH\r\n     ELUDE HIM—FURTHER MORTIFICATION AND DEATH—CHARACTER OF THE\r\n     CONQUERORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes which gave rise to the disputes of rival\r\nleaders for the occupancy of Nicaragua and Honduras was the policy which\r\ngoverned the Council of the Indies in regard to the colonial possessions\r\nof Spain. Gradually the discovery of Columbus had assumed gigantic\r\nproportions, and the indefinite and unknown limits to the territories\r\nwhich had been given to the first governors were becoming more fixed and\r\ndetermined. The immense extent of the discovery and the vast dominions\r\nwhich had been allotted to each colony was then first ascertained.\r\nIt was deemed wise and prudent by the court of Spain that such broad\r\npossessions should be divided into smaller states, and governed by\r\nmany, rather than that the whole should be under the jurisdiction of\r\na few arrogant viceroys. Thus checks could be more easily placed on\r\nindividuals, and the distant provinces of the New World could be more\r\nreadily held in subjection. With this in view it was that Hernandez\r\nde Córdoba had been urged by the audiencia to throw off allegiance to\r\nPedrarias, and that the enterprises not only of Gil Gonzalez but of Olid\r\nhad been encouraged by the Spanish government.[XXI-1]\r\n\r\nBut a resort to arms as a method for settling their differences was by\r\nno means desired; and when the emperor became aware that hostilities had\r\nbroken out among the colonists of Honduras and Nicaragua he peremptorily\r\nforbade any Spaniard to draw his sword against another, under penalty of\r\nhis severe displeasure. The better to curb the encroaching conquerors\r\non either side, and to further his policy, he resolved to appoint new\r\ngovernors for these provinces; and thus it was that Pedrarias, owing in\r\na great measure to his wife and to family influence, had obtained the\r\nlong desired lake region, even before the result of his residencia was\r\nknown; while Honduras was given as early as 1525[XXI-2] to Diego Lopez\r\nde Salcedo, regardless of the great efforts and means expended by Cortés\r\nin its colonization, wholly from his own resources.[XXI-3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAAVEDRA AND SALCEDO.]\r\n\r\nSalcedo was at this time residing in Española, and on receiving the\r\nappointment, together with instructions to inquire into the late\r\ntrouble and punish the guilty, he at once prepared to set out. The\r\naudiencia also took the instructions to heart, and, regarding Cortés\r\nas implicated, they seized one of his ships at Santo Domingo, with its\r\ncargo of merchandise.[XXI-4] Salcedo found the settlers at peace on\r\nreaching Trujillo. Saavedra and Alcalde Figueroa set the example to the\r\nother officials in doing reverence to the new ruler, who was solemnly\r\ninaugurated on the 27th of October, 1526.[XXI-5] The first act under\r\nthe new régime was to make an investigation into the late political\r\ndisturbances, and the result was the arrest of Saavedra, regidores\r\nGarnica and Vega, and two settlers named Martin Cortés and Morales, who\r\nwere placed on a vessel for transmission to the judges in Española.\r\nTheir safe-keeping was intrusted to Diego Morillo, who was installed\r\nwith a staff of justice, to give him greater authority. But the emblem\r\nof the law failed to impose upon the prisoners, who were in this respect\r\nhardly less imbued with the spirit of the times than Pedrarias and\r\nhis followers. They had too wholesome a fear of the quality of mercy\r\ndispensed by the pompous rulers at Santo Domingo, and determined to make\r\nan effort for liberty. The mainland had barely been lost to sight when\r\nthey appealed to the master's sympathy. Their argument was sufficiently\r\nweighted to be convincing, and the shackles were not only transferred\r\nto Morillo, but he was relieved of all his effects. The vessel's course\r\nwas thereupon changed to Cuba, where the mutineers dispersed in search\r\nof wider spheres of operations.[XXI-6]\r\n\r\nShortly after Salcedo's installation the three envoys of Pedrarias\r\narrived at Trujillo. Finding a royal governor instead of the intruder\r\nSaavedra, they did not venture to present their demands for the\r\nsubmission of the province, but sought instead to regain Nicaragua and\r\nwarn their master. Salcedo had them arrested, however, as concerned\r\nin the disorders in Nicaragua and Olancho, and turned the tables by\r\ndeclaring Pedrarias an arraigned culprit, answerable to the residencia\r\njudge at Panamá, and Nicaragua as falling within the jurisdiction of\r\nHonduras, instead of pertaining to Castilla del Oro. He intended, in\r\nfact, to take possession at once, and in this course he was encouraged\r\nby petitions from the anti-Pedrarias faction of that province. The\r\nlimits of Salcedo's government had not been fixed, and what more natural\r\nthan to base on the claims of Cortés and Gonzalez the pleasing illusion\r\nthat Nicaragua must belong to his jurisdiction? An additional excuse was\r\nto be found in the late political disturbances in that province, which\r\nit behooved him as a royal officer to stop. The captive envoys should\r\naccompany him as guides and hostages.\r\n\r\nPreparations were soon concluded, and Salcedo departed with nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty horsemen, leaving the small remnant at Trujillo under\r\ncommand of Francisco de Cisneros.[XXI-7] He sent forward Alonso de\r\nSolis, one of his captains, and a priest, with instructions to report\r\nto him the condition of the Indians throughout the district; whether\r\nthey were friendly or otherwise; and what were their feelings in regard\r\nto the Christian faith which they had previously professed to adopt.\r\nSolis speedily came back with the information that bands of Spaniards\r\nwere prowling about the Olancho Valley. Salcedo advanced upon them, and\r\na skirmish ensued in which two men were lost. Suspecting that Albites\r\nand his companions might be connected with this untoward check, he sent\r\nthem back to Trujillo with instructions for their immediate transmission\r\nto Santo Domingo, on the charge of inciting native revolts and other\r\ndisorders. These charges were not sustained, however, and the prisoners\r\nsoon returned fully exonerated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOES OF THE NATIVES.]\r\n\r\nStill another check came to dampen the ardor of the party, and Treasurer\r\nCastillo, among others, urged the abandonment of the expedition; but\r\nthe fair shores of the Freshwater Sea had taken too deep a hold upon\r\nSalcedo's fancy, strewn as they were by rumor with much gold. No;\r\nhe knew his duty as royal officer, and would extend his beneficent\r\nrule to this region. As for his losses and disappointments, he would\r\nlook to that universal source of redress, the natives. Caciques were\r\nsummoned to furnish Indians for carrying burdens and gathering food, and\r\nsoldiers went forth to enforce the order. A number of those suspected\r\nof complicity in the disturbances at Natividad were hanged and others\r\nenslaved, to be eventually sent out of the country and sold. Great were\r\ntheir woes. Those who lost their relatives or near friends fled to the\r\nmountains, preferring starvation and death to the cruel oppression of\r\nthe strangers. This feeling extended also to the district of Comayagua,\r\nand created a distrust which was at once magnified into revolt. The\r\nSpaniards immediately fell upon them, and a terrible havoc ensued. The\r\nnatives resorted to the passive retaliation of withdrawing supplies, and\r\neven of destroying the crops, so as to leave the Spaniards without food,\r\nand compel them to devour horses and dogs. This heightened the feeling\r\nagainst them, and even the carriers were made to suffer so severely that\r\nmany threw off their loads and sought to escape, only to be overtaken\r\nand slaughtered. The panic spread, and tribes distant from the scene\r\nburned their villages and fields to seek refuge in the mountains, lest\r\nthey should be exposed to similar outrages on Salcedo's return.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua the rumor of these doings had impelled the natives to\r\nassume a threatening attitude, so that when the Spanish party finally\r\narrived at the city of Leon they were hailed as saviors. This helped\r\nto pave the way for Salcedo, and when he submitted his commission to\r\nMartin Estete, the officer in charge, and to the municipal body, they\r\ngave one glance at the sturdy forces by his side and then recognized it\r\nas valid. The new governor was sworn in May 7, 1527. Once in undisputed\r\npossession the humanity of Salcedo underwent a change. He would no\r\nlonger carry panic into native villages by means of raiding parties;\r\nnay, he would even relieve the Indians from the oppression of their\r\npresent masters, the late subjects of Pedrarias, and place them under\r\nthe experienced control of his friends and followers. Without more ado\r\nthe choice repartimientos were transferred to the hands of himself and\r\nhis adherents, with not even an attempted excuse to the late holders.\r\nSuch high-handed proceedings created general dissatisfaction, not only\r\namong the despoiled settlers but also among the enslaved, who were\r\nregarded as cattle, and treated with a severity paralleled only by the\r\nHonduras atrocities. More spirited, however, than the former victims,\r\nthey retaliated with sullen stubbornness, and refused to gather gold\r\nor perform agricultural labor. The distress increased, and many could\r\nnot procure the common necessaries of life. The rupture between the\r\ntwo races developed into open warfare, in which rights, grievances, and\r\npassion often figured only as minor impulses by the side of the cravings\r\nof hunger.[XXI-8]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PEDRARIAS AND RIOS.]\r\n\r\nTo these distressing straits was the country reduced when a new claimant\r\nto the government presented himself, in the person of Pedro de los\r\nRios. Invested with the same power and authority over Castilla del Oro\r\nas his predecessor, he thought himself entitled to jurisdiction also\r\nover Nicaragua, since it had been occupied and settled under the same\r\nauspices. He had deferred his departure from Panamá till Pedrarias\r\nshould have been securely entangled in the meshes of his residencia,\r\nand therefore unable to object. But the latter was desirous to see him\r\nleave, in the hope that a change in his own favor might be effected,\r\nperhaps by some friendly ingulfing wave, some devoted assassin, or\r\nsome native treachery; for the road was new and Rios inexperienced. As\r\na proof of his friendly interest in the project Pedrarias counselled\r\nhim to invest heavily in merchandise, which must pay a large profit.\r\nSuch advice was not to be disregarded, and, as circumstances would\r\nhave it, the gubernatorial trader was received with open arms by the\r\nsorely pressed settlers of Nicaragua. But Rios had not the foresight\r\nwhich characterized Fiscal Moreno's proceedings in Honduras, two years\r\nbefore, and on presenting his claims to the supreme office the colonists\r\nreturned a cold stare. They saw nothing in his commission which\r\nexpressly included Nicaragua within Castilla del Oro, and although much\r\nafflicted by the avaricious and oppressive measures of Salcedo, they\r\ndetermined to support a governor whom they might call their own rather\r\nthan submit to one residing at such a distance, and evidently intent on\r\nenriching himself and Panamá at their expense.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the cause for the change lay partly with\r\nPedrarias, whose emissaries hoped by this means to embroil the new\r\naspirant with his proposed subjects. Salcedo was strong enough, however,\r\nwith his own troops to dictate terms to his rival, and he peremptorily\r\nordered him to leave the province within three days, under a penalty of\r\nten thousand pesos. Rios had too much respect for his portly person to\r\nexpose it to profane usage. Still he would have lingered had not the\r\nthreatened fine urged him away. As it was, in the flurry of departure\r\nhe even forgot his gout, with which he was just then severely stricken,\r\nand his groans were not resumed till the vessel had turned prow for\r\nPanamá. He carried one consolation, however, to soothe his ruffled\r\nspirit; he had made these boorish colonists pay tenfold for his cargo\r\nof merchandise. After all, the trip had not proved unprofitable, and\r\nhe laughed within himself at the thought. On his way back he stopped at\r\nBrusélas, in the gulf of Nicoya, where a friendly reception was accorded\r\nhim. Informed of this, Salcedo with vindictive jealousy sent a troop of\r\nsixty horse under Garabito to destroy the hospitable town.\r\n\r\nThe rankest despot could hardly deport himself with more capricious\r\nseverity than these petty upstart lieutenants in the Indies. Salcedo\r\nwas evidently a fitting successor to Pedrarias, as far as displaying\r\nhis jealousy, greed, and cruelty; but he lacked some of the commanding\r\ncharacteristics which had so often enabled the latter to weather the\r\nstorm raised by his tyrannous impulses. His rule was to be brief and\r\nignoble. One of his last acts, which bore the relieving stamp of a\r\npublic measure, was to order Gabriel de Rojas to explore Rio San Juan,\r\nthe outlet of the lake, and to found there a settlement.\r\n\r\nThis order was disregarded, for just then came the rumor that Pedrarias\r\nwas about to return as governor. This sufficed to bring the general\r\ndissatisfaction with Salcedo to an issue. At first he treated the news\r\nas absurd; but, when the report came that Pedrarias was actually on\r\nthe way with a royal commission, he resolved to collect his scattered\r\nfollowers and make his escape. The step was fatal, as it encouraged\r\nthe still wavering Estete with his friends to pronounce in favor of the\r\nexpected chief. The officials of Salcedo were arrested, which rendered\r\nthe executive powerless to act, and his horses were seized, so that\r\nhe might not escape a reckoning. So ominous became the demonstration\r\nagainst the deposed governor, that he abandoned the building which\r\nhad hitherto given him shelter, and sought the protecting walls of the\r\nchurch. There he remained, closely guarded by the rebels, till Pedrarias\r\narrived. Several persons had remonstrated with Estete with regard to\r\nthese arbitrary proceedings, based as they were on a mere report from\r\nPanamá; but this officer, who had everything to gain by the movement if\r\nthe report proved true, declared that Pedrarias should be supported even\r\nif he came without a royal Commission. In any case it would be suicidal\r\nnow to restore the relentless Salcedo to power.[XXI-9]\r\n\r\nAll doubts were solved by the arrival of the old governor at Leon in\r\nMarch, 1528, and the timely turncoats were liberally rewarded; Estete\r\nreceiving the command of Leon, and Diego de Tejorina that of Granada.\r\nImmediately on receipt of his appointment Pedrarias had hastened to\r\nNicaragua, leaving an agent at Panamá to finish his residencia, and to\r\ncollect the property and effects which had been attached. In connection\r\nwith the new government the king had appointed Licenciado Castañeda\r\nalcalde mayor, and Diego de la Tobilla treasurer, both of whom arrived\r\neight months later.[XXI-10]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPRISONMENT OF SALCEDO.]\r\n\r\nSalcedo's case claimed the first attention of the new ruler, and\r\nclaims and charges began to pour in, the chief accusation being that he\r\nhad stationed spies to watch for the arrival of Pedrarias and native\r\nassassins to despatch him. An investigation was ordered, to embrace\r\nalso the question whether Salcedo had royal authority for his entry into\r\nthe territory. The accused denied the charges, of course, and protested\r\nthat he had come merely to pacify the country, in accordance with his\r\ninstructions. He demanded liberty to depart for Honduras, where the\r\nking required his presence as governor. Any other person might have felt\r\nawed by a demand coupled so plausibly with the royal name, but Pedrarias\r\nhad too often mocked even the direct commands of his sovereign to care\r\nfor indirect requirements. He flaunted in the face of the accused the\r\nroyal order lately received forbidding him to meddle in Nicaraguan\r\naffairs, and declared that since he had done so there was every prospect\r\nfor a residencia. The order for it might arrive at any moment, and he\r\nmust give bonds to answer the claims against him. The bonds not being\r\nforthcoming he was placed under restraint, and on his attempting to\r\nescape, close confinement was imposed.\r\n\r\nTen weary months Salcedo lay in durance. Finally Treasurer Tobilla\r\nand Osorio, afterward bishop, intervened and brought about a peaceful\r\nsettlement. But the conditions extorted from him as the price of liberty\r\nwere so humiliating that shame and vexation preyed upon his mind, and\r\ndestroyed his health, already weakened by imprisonment. He was obliged\r\nto renounce his claims to the south, and promise to confine himself\r\nto a triangular section of territory bounded on the east and west by\r\nCape Gracias á Dios and Puerto de Caballos.[XXI-11] The three envoys\r\nof Pedrarias, whom he had sent to Española to answer false charges,\r\nand who had returned acquitted, were to be compensated, and he must\r\ngive security for twenty thousand pesos to appear in case a residencia\r\nshould be instituted against him. On Christmas eve, 1528, the prison\r\ndoors opened before him, and the once dashing Salcedo tottered forth,\r\npale and emaciated, weighed down with infirmities of body and mind, an\r\nobject of pity even to the down-trodden Indians. It had been a game of\r\nrogue against rogue, and Pedrarias as usual was the winner. Salcedo felt\r\nthat he deserved little sympathy, either from the oppressed colonists\r\nor from the cruelly treated natives, and within ten days he set out for\r\nthe shielding precincts of his own government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPLORATION OF THE RIVER SAN JUAN.]\r\n\r\nPedrarias had long before this taken steps to secure for himself the\r\nlarge tracts of country which he intended to extort from his prisoner,\r\nchiefly because they were reported to be rich in gold. For this there\r\nwere also additional motives. The report of mineral wealth in the\r\nprovince had induced the king to inquire regarding the desirability\r\nof erecting smelting works, and similar measures, and although the\r\navaricious old governor required no incentive to gold-hunting, yet the\r\ncommunication was welcomed as a good pretence for his preparations.\r\nThe already projected expedition by Rojas to the river outlet of the\r\nlake was therefore ordered to proceed, reinforced to more than one\r\nhundred and fifty men, but the chief command was intrusted to Estete,\r\nwith instructions to explore the country, particularly for minerals, to\r\ntake possession for Pedrarias, and to found settlements on the river\r\nand along the sea-shore, as desired by the king. On the river, where\r\nit receives the waters of the lake, was formed the settlement of Nueva\r\nJaen, flushed at first with brilliant anticipations of a vast entrepôt\r\ntrade and a flourishing colony, but doomed to speedy abandonment.\r\nFrom the mouth of the San Juan the party followed the coast northward,\r\nblazing their way with branding-iron and sword, and finding good mines\r\nat Cape Gracias á Dios, as rumored. There they established another\r\ncolony, of which Rojas was left in charge, while Estete returned to\r\nLeon.\r\n\r\nTheir pathway thither had been stained sanguine by the most abominable\r\ncruelty against the natives, in the form of wholesale enslavement and\r\nwanton bloodshed, and this in face of the repeated and stringent orders\r\nfrom the king for their good treatment.[XXI-12] Of what avail were\r\norders which suited not the taste of Master Pedrarias! On setting out\r\nfor Cape Gracias á Dios, Estete received from the chest, in which it\r\nwas kept under three locks by order of the crown, the branding-iron,\r\nwhich was intended to be used only on rebels and criminals, and pursuing\r\nhis circuitous route, he captured and branded indiscriminately all\r\nnatives who fell into his hands, and sent them as slaves to Pedrarias\r\nat Leon. Captives were secured by iron collars around the neck, chained\r\ntogether in gangs, and forced to carry heavy burdens. When one fell from\r\nexhaustion, in order to save time and trouble, his head was severed from\r\nthe body, and this released the collar so that the others might pass\r\non.[XXI-13]\r\n\r\nThis and other kidnapping expeditions, made chiefly in the interest of\r\nPedrarias, fairly glutted Leon and Granada with captives; but if they\r\ncould not be used here there was another means of utilizing them. The\r\nnative population of the Isthmus, as we have seen, had already been so\r\ngreatly reduced by the ever dripping sword, by the hardly less speedy\r\nmeasures of relentless taskmasters, and by the flight of panic-stricken\r\nborder tribes, that the settlers found it difficult to fill the\r\nconstantly occurring gaps in their labor gangs. A slave market had\r\naccordingly been opened at Panamá, where natives were sold by auction.\r\nIts origin was with Pedrarias, and with a fatherly regard for his former\r\ngovernment he felt it a duty to sustain an institution so useful to the\r\ncolonists and so comforting to his coffers. A regular trade thereupon\r\nsprang up in Indian slaves, and several ship-loads were taken down to\r\nPanamá about this time by different persons.[XXI-14]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPOPULATION.]\r\n\r\nThe supply of unfortunates was drawn not only from the outlying\r\ndistricts, but from the very centre of the lake settlements, and their\r\ncapture assisted the sword and lash to no small extent in decimating the\r\npopulation. When Gil Gonzalez first entered the country it was densely\r\npopulated, and the city of Managua alone contained forty thousand souls,\r\nit was said. A few years of Spanish rule sufficed to turn whole tracts\r\nof flourishing country into uninhabited wilds, leaving here and there\r\nonly small communities of terrorized natives groaning under extortionate\r\nand cruel masters. On appealing to their idols they were assured that a\r\nflood could be called forth, but in it would perish Indians as well as\r\nSpaniards. Such was the comfort derived from their religion. Although\r\nthey had not courage enough to adopt this remedy, women widely formed\r\nthe resolution not to perpetuate a race foredoomed to slavery and cruel\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt first, when numbers still gave self-reliance, they ventured to renew\r\nthe hostilities which under Salcedo had led to such bloody results.\r\nSoon after Estete's departure for Cape Gracias a general revolt broke\r\nout. In the districts of Leon and Granada bloodshed was averted, but in\r\nthe interior the slaughter of natives was great, and if the Spaniards\r\nlost comparatively few, the loss was increased by the horrors of\r\ncannibalism.[XXI-15] Among the victims were Alonso Peralta, the royal\r\ntreasurer, an hidalgo named Zurita, and two brothers of the name of\r\nBallas, who in 1528 set out from the city of Leon to visit the Indians\r\nthat had been allotted to them respectively. None ever returned; all\r\nwere slain by their vassals. Pedrarias despatched a band of soldiers,\r\nwho captured eighteen caciques supposed to be implicated in the murders.\r\n\r\nThe Indians becoming daily more bold and troublesome a new method of\r\nstriking them with terror was invented. As in the introduction of\r\nChristianity to the natives diplomacy was frequently made to take\r\nthe place of logic, so in war and punishment a refined cruelty, in\r\nthe exercise of which the aged Pedrarias Dávila stood unexcelled,\r\nwas deemed the most effectual means of pacification. The governor\r\nof Leon determined on a grand spectacle, modelled somewhat after the\r\ngladiatorial exhibitions of Rome. An inclosure was made in the public\r\nsquare of the town, and on a fixed day the Indian chieftains were\r\nbrought forth. One of them was led into the arena and given a stout\r\nstick or club with which to defend his life against the dogs to be\r\nlet loose. At first five or six young and inexperienced animals were\r\nset upon him, which he could easily keep at bay with his stick. After\r\nwitnessing this sport until it grew tame, and just as the unfortunate\r\ncaptive began to rejoice in the hope that through his skill and bravery\r\nhis life was saved, two fierce bloodhounds rushed in, seized him by\r\nthe throat, brought him to the ground, tore into shreds the flesh, and\r\ndevoured the entrails, assisted by the still yelping whelps. On the\r\nauthority of Oviedo, an eye-witness, this horrible scene was repeated\r\nseventeen times. Pedrarias ordered the dead bodies to be left on the\r\nground as a warning to others, but soon the stench became insupportable,\r\nand the Indians were allowed to remove them.[XXI-16]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus did the effort to open a transcontinental route by way of San Juan\r\nnot only fail, but it carried a host of evils with it, as we have seen.\r\nPedrarias was not content, however, to abandon to Panamá so fruitful a\r\nproject without another struggle, and since the strip of land between\r\nLeon and Caballos was well suited for a road, he prepared to open one.\r\nBut orders came from the king forbidding the work. The Isthmus was\r\nregarded as sufficient for present traffic, and it was also feared that\r\ntoo many lives would be lost in constructing the new road.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SALVADOR.]\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of Pedrarias in connection with the undertaking was\r\nto secure possession of the western territory wrested from Salcedo,\r\nand in this, at any rate, he resolved not to be defeated. Estete was\r\naccordingly despatched northward with a strong force, accompanied by\r\nRojas. He was first to explore the northern lakes to determine their\r\noutlet, and then to occupy the district between Golfo Dulce and the\r\nSouth Sea, north of Fonseca Bay. This province, known as Salvador,\r\nhad already been conquered by Alvarado, the lieutenant of Cortés; but\r\nPedrarias knew that the settlers left in possession were not numerous,\r\nand that the king would be more apt to favor the annexation of the\r\nprovince to the adjoining small government of Nicaragua than to the\r\ndistant and too extensive New Spain. Besides, Honduras had claimed it,\r\nand that claim was now his. Estete advanced into the heart of Salvador\r\nand occupied the town there founded by Alvarado. Few as they were the\r\nsettlers refused to recognize the authority of the Nicaraguan governor,\r\nand his lieutenant retired to the town of Perulapan, upon which he\r\nbestowed the high-sounding title of Ciudad de los Caballeros, together\r\nwith a batch of officials who were to aid him in the congenial task of\r\noppression and enslavement. His sway was not of long duration, however,\r\nfor Jorge de Alvarado, then in charge of the Guatemalan government,\r\nreceiving notice of the intrusion, came down upon his settlement and\r\ncompelled him to evacuate the province in hot haste, with the loss of\r\nhalf his force, which deserted to the enemy.[XXI-17]\r\n\r\nPedrarias' schemes for aggrandizement were evidently not succeeding\r\naccording to his desire, and he grieved at the thought of the many heavy\r\nducats lost on this last expedition. It was the more deplorable in view\r\nof the failure to direct through Nicaragua the transcontinental traffic,\r\nwhich would have yielded so rich a harvest for himself. But above all\r\nhovered a deeper grief than any of these. Peru, with its glittering\r\nwealth, was now dawning on the world, and none would have been more\r\ndazzled by the sight than Pedrarias, had not the agonizing fact intruded\r\nitself that he had been tricked out of these very treasures, or at least\r\na large share of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the first expedition was organized for this conquest by Pizarro,\r\nAlmagro, and Luque, Pedrarias, then governor at Panamá, had stipulated\r\nfor a fourth interest, in return for which he bestowed the weighty sum\r\nof his patronage. But the opening events proved to be less flattering\r\nthan he had expected, and when demands came for pecuniary aid toward\r\nthe enterprise, he shrank from the prospect, and allowed himself to be\r\nbought off for the paltry consideration of one thousand pesos de oro.\r\nSoon came glowing reports, however, and bitter were his denunciations of\r\nthe folly which had permitted so rich a prize to escape him; and deep\r\nhis feeling rankled against the late partners, whom he never ceased to\r\nsuspect of duplicity and of having beguiled him with misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus brooding, it happened that Nicolás de Ribera arrived\r\nin Nicaragua, commissioned by the Peruvian conquerors to procure\r\nreinforcements. He sought in particular to win for this purpose Hernando\r\nde Soto, Hernan Ponce, and Francisco Compañon, all men of means, who\r\nhad two vessels on the stocks, nearly finished and available for the\r\nvoyage. By revolving before their eyes, in kaleidoscopic harmony, a\r\nfew specimens of the Inca's treasures, illustrated by tales no less\r\nalluring, he secured the active sympathy not only of these men, but of\r\na crowd of beggared adherents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PERUVIAN ADVENTURE.]\r\n\r\nNot least dazzled was Pedrarias. Indeed, he could not sleep for the\r\nvisions that crowded upon his brain. Finally the idea struck him that\r\nhe might here retrieve his folly by securing an interest in the vessels\r\nand reinforcements, and obtain a fair proportion of that gold-enameled\r\nregion, perhaps the whole. Pizarro and Almagro had already prepared\r\nthe way, and it might even be his fortune to secure the results of\r\ntheir victories. In order to lull the Peruvian emissaries he promised\r\nto do everything to aid Pizarro and Luque; as for Almagro, he had been\r\ndeceived by him, and deceit his confiding nature could not endure.\r\nHe thereupon entered secretly into negotiation with the owners of\r\nthe vessels, but overreached himself by demanding the lion's share in\r\ncommand as well as returns. Feeling himself in duty bound to spare his\r\nown purse, he looked about for victims to furnish means, and bethought\r\nhimself of Ribera's vessel. An alguacil was sent to seize it, but Ribera\r\nreceived timely warning and escaped, after prevailing on Ponce, Soto,\r\nand their adherents, to sail away to Panamá and there arrange with\r\nPizarro for a liberal share in the conquest, leaving behind the foiled\r\nPedrarias.[XXI-18]\r\n\r\nThe governor's mortification was increased by local troubles, as might\r\nbe expected from his arbitrary rule and irascible temper, which had\r\nnow reached octogenarian crabbedness. A most distasteful feature had\r\nbeen the arrival of Alcalde Mayor Francisco de Castañeda, appointed\r\nby the king to take charge of the judicial affairs of the province.\r\nThis division of authority was intolerable, and, on the pretence that\r\ndisorders must result where different persons exercised judicial and\r\ngubernatorial powers, he urged his friends in Spain to obtain for\r\nhim the privilege to appoint and remove at pleasure alcaldes mayores\r\nand lieutenants. Meanwhile he made an effort to exercise this power,\r\nalleging the possession of a royal cédula authorizing him to do so;\r\nbut Castañeda, who was not so easily imposed upon, challenged him to\r\nproduce the document, and this not being done, he added to his chagrin\r\nby ignoring him.\r\n\r\nThere was little likelihood of any arbitrary powers being conferred on\r\nthe governor, for complaints of abuses were fast pouring in against\r\nhim, headed by the influential ayuntamiento of Leon. A grave charge\r\nwas peculation. When Rodrigo del Castillo surrendered his office to the\r\nformally appointed treasurer he took the opportunity to inform the king\r\nthat large sums in gold had been taken from the Indians by Córdoba. All\r\nthis the governor had laid hands upon without any accounting therefor to\r\nthe crown. He had also managed to appropriate the confiscated estate of\r\nCórdoba, and to defraud a host of others, besides perpetrating outrages\r\nand cruelties of every description.[XXI-19]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF PEDRARIAS.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the brewing troubles, in the year 1530,[XXI-20] this\r\nTimur of the Indies died at Leon, nearly ninety years of age. His body\r\nwas buried in the same church with his victim Hernandez de Córdoba, and\r\nhis spirit went to meet the spirit of Vasco Nuñez, and the spirits of\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of slaughtered savages whose benighted souls\r\nhe had sent on before.[XXI-21] Not that he quailed at the thought. By\r\nthis time his mind had become so fixed in some incomprehensible mould\r\nof logic that there was no disturbing it. Further than this he knew he\r\ncould not escape the inevitable.\r\n\r\nA disposition so ready to find solace is to be envied, the more so\r\nsince it forms a redeeming feature. No man is, for that matter, wholly\r\ndepraved, nor are any faultless. In the worst there is much that is\r\ngood; in the best much evil. And the difference between the best and the\r\nworst is, in the eye of the Creator, much less than in the eye of the\r\ncreature. For a period of sixteen years, during the most important epoch\r\nin the history of Darien, an irascible old man, cruel and vindictive,\r\nplays a prominent part. His name is infamous, and so it deserves to be.\r\nSome of his misdeeds may be attributed to inherent wickedness, others\r\nto infirmities of temper; but many to peculiar conditions incident to\r\nthe colonization of a new country, and to the teachings of the times.\r\nSpanish colonists of the sixteenth century, reared under the influences\r\nof excessive loyalty, and suddenly withdrawn from the presence of\r\ntheir august sovereign to distant parts, were like children for the\r\nfirst time freed from the arbitrary rule of injudicious parents. While\r\nthe safeguards of society were removed, and free scope thus given to\r\npassion, there yet remained their religious belief, the fruit of early\r\nteachings. That strange fanaticism which blended avarice and deeds\r\ndiabolical with pretended zeal for the glory of God, not only permitted\r\nbut demanded blood and vengeance. Under the circumstances, therefore,\r\nthe wonder is, not that we find so much that is wicked in these Spanish\r\nadventurers, but that men so taught and conditioned display so many\r\nqualities noble and magnanimous. Farewell Pedrarias! Few there are who\r\ncame to these parts of whom so much of evil, so little of good, may be\r\ntruthfully said. And thou Death, almighty leveller! who by thy speedy\r\ncompensation has brought this rusty, crusty old man, these several\r\ncenturies, and for all the centuries time shall tell, to be no better\r\nthan Vasco Nuñez, than Córdoba, than the meanest of the multitude of\r\nsavages he has vilely slain, we praise thee![XXI-22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMARCH OF ALVARADO TO GUATEMALA.\r\n\r\n1522-1524.\r\n\r\n     RUMORS IN MEXICO CONCERNING THE COUNTRY TO THE\r\n     SOUTH-EASTWARD—PACIFICATION IN THAT QUARTER—THE CHIEFS OF\r\n     TEHUANTEPEC AND TUTUTEPEC—AT THE GATE OF GUATEMALA—SUMMARY\r\n     OF ABORIGINAL HISTORY—ALLEGIANCE AND REVOLT—PREPARING OF AN\r\n     EXPEDITION—DELAYED BY THE TROUBLES AT PÁNUCO—A SECOND ARMY\r\n     ORGANIZED—THE MARCH—SUBJUGATION OF SOCONUSCO—THE TAKING OF\r\n     ZAPOTITLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time before Olid entered Honduras the attention of Alvarado was\r\ndirected toward Guatemala. Lying between Mexico and Nicaragua, this\r\ncountry was one of the first links in Cortés' chain of projected\r\nconquests; it was the foreground in the glowing picture which rumor had\r\npainted of the regions to the south. Here were the greatest of cities\r\nand the finest of palaces, maintained by a people as numerous and\r\ncultured as any in Anáhuac. A vast table-land, with an Italian climate,\r\nmade bright with meandering streams, studded with verdure-fringed lakes,\r\nproduced in abundance the choicest of products, while the mountains and\r\nriver-beds, in the ardent imagination of the conquerors, at least, were\r\nveined with gold. Soft sensuous pearls were distributed by an equally\r\nlavish fancy along the shore bathed by the southern sea.\r\n\r\nOn first touching the borders of New Spain vague stories had reached\r\nCortés to this effect, and while captive Montezuma still held sway at\r\nTenochtitlan he had sought further information. The reports poured into\r\nhis ears served only to magnify the mystery and render the allurement\r\nirresistible. As soon, therefore, as the contest with the empire was\r\nover he despatched two small parties southward, and once again the drama\r\nof Vasco Nuñez was performed, once more was discovered and claimed the\r\nboundless ocean, emblem of infinity, incentive to ever greater deeds,\r\nto ever grander discoveries, \"for within it,\" writes Cortés to the\r\nemperor, \"must be found islands rich in gold and pearls, and precious\r\nstones and spices, and many other secrets and wonderful things, as men\r\nof experience and learning affirm.\"[XXII-1]\r\n\r\nThere was more than speculation in this statement, for the explorers\r\nreturned with native envoys bearing gold and pearls and other specimens\r\nof riches. Nor had they failed, in accordance with the Catholic\r\ndoctrine of appropriation, as I have intimated, to take possession of\r\nthe new shores in the names of their Catholic majesties, the king and\r\nqueen of Spain, and to erect the cross, emblematic of their religion.\r\nWith doubled impulse the conquerors now advanced along the new route\r\nopened, and speedily the vast provinces of Michoacan and Oajaca were\r\noverrun. About the same time Pilot Andrés Niño had stretched the\r\nlimit of discovery by sea from the gulf of Nicoya to very near this\r\nparallel,[XXII-2] disclosing to the world the vastness of the sea\r\nbaptized with the blood of Magellan, and by him endowed with a new name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEHUANTEPEC AND TUTUTEPEC.]\r\n\r\nNative envoys were meanwhile entering into Mexico to lay homage and rich\r\ngifts at the feet of the bearded white chief. Made happy in return with\r\nCastilian trumpery and the gracious condescension of the demi-gods, they\r\nwent back to pour into the ears of their princes the tales impressed\r\nupon them by the strangers, of the power and grandeur of their king,\r\nand of the kindness and vast benefits to be derived from a submissive\r\nalliance with them. Among the first of the meek and friendly spirits\r\nto act upon these reports was the lord of Tehuantepec. Less credulous\r\nwas his neighbor of Tututepec, who had great wealth, and by no means\r\nrelished the idea of throwing open his gates to rapacious invaders. He\r\nexpostulated with his neighbor, saying that the course meditated would\r\nbe ruinous to them all. The two chieftains had quarrelled before on a\r\nless momentous issue than the present, and it was quite easy for them\r\nto quarrel now, and fight. If the silly lord of Tehuantepec wished to\r\nthrow away himself and all his belongings, it were better they should\r\nfall into a neighbor's hands than to strangers; so he of Tututepec\r\nattacked him and pressed him hard, until the ruler of Tehuantepec called\r\nto Cortés for help.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this request Pedro de Alvarado was sent to his aid.\r\nLeaving Mexico early in 1522, with a strong force, he swept southward\r\nlike a whirlwind, and within a few weeks entered the doomed capital of\r\nTututepec, captured the chieftain and his heir, and held them subject\r\nto heavy ransom. Nor was this all. There were rich mines thereabout,\r\nso he was told; and at the sea, into which he entered with brandished\r\nsword to take possession, his eyes feasted on lustrous pearls. This\r\nsealed the fate of the ocean-bordered realms, and permanent footholds\r\nwere established, to serve as _nuclei_ for radiating conquest, and as\r\nretreats for booty-laden raiders. It was on this occasion that Soconusco\r\nwas peaceably occupied by the Spaniards.[XXII-3] Still more dazzling\r\nwas the confirmation received of the wonderful kingdoms of the Quichés\r\nand the Cakchiquels, hitherto invested by distance with the charm of\r\nmystery, but now by proximity disclosing glimpses of no mean splendor.\r\nHe found himself, in fact, not far from the border, and guides being at\r\nhand, he resolved to send two soldiers to investigate, with instructions\r\nto spy out the land and speak of their king and their religion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus are opened the portals of Guatemala,[XXII-4] a region within\r\nwhose parallels centuries rocked the cradle of American civilization,\r\nnow disclosed by monuments the most imposing of any on the continent.\r\nThe history of their origin is hidden in the remote past, of which\r\nonly an occasional glimpse is permitted the investigator. A mighty Maya\r\nempire looms forth under the name of Xibalba, founded perhaps by Votan,\r\nthe culture-hero, and centring round the famous Palenque. A golden\r\nage was followed by long struggles with a growing power, which brought\r\nabout its downfall toward the beginning of our era. The Nahuas now rise\r\ninto prominence, but some five centuries later disaster falls also on\r\nthem, and a general breaking-up ensues, leading to mighty migrations\r\nand the formation of smaller independent nations, such as the Toltecs,\r\nChichimecs, and Quichés. After this even tradition ceases to speak,\r\nsave in alluding vaguely to a later foreign immigration. With this\r\ncome also certain Toltecs, who, after the downfall of their empire in\r\nthe more northerly Anáhuac, seek here an asylum where once again may\r\nbloom the culture that, cradled in this very region, now returns with\r\ninvigorating elements. Mingling with the natives, they stir anew the\r\nprogress paralyzed by civil wars, infuse fresh spirit into tottering\r\ninstitutions, and, combining with the aboriginal culture, develop the\r\nnew era apparent in the art relics of this western plateau.\r\n\r\nA series of struggles soon ensues, out of which rises in the twelfth\r\nor thirteenth century the Quiché empire. Subordinate tribes gradually\r\nacquire sufficient strength, however, to cast off a yoke which has grown\r\nburdensome, and foremost among the new nations figure the Cakchiquels,\r\nwho in the early part of the fifteenth century are dividing domination\r\nwith the Quichés. The Cakchiquels themselves divide soon after, the\r\nnorthern and weaker branch forming the Zutugils, their respective\r\ncapitals being Patinamit and Atitlan. These, with their former masters,\r\nare the three rival monarchies of Guatemala in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. The Quichés, who govern at Utatlan, nevertheless\r\nmaintain a certain preëminence, both in political standing and culture.\r\nThere are, besides, a number of minor independent peoples only too\r\neager to stimulate enmity between the leading powers, and to ally\r\nthemselves with that which is likely to favor their own interests. This\r\ncondition of things, so favorable to foreign intrigue, has not escaped\r\nthe attention of the ambitious Aztecs, who are already masters of the\r\nSoconusco border province. Their agents are in fact scattered throughout\r\nthe country, laying plans for further conquests, when the Spaniards step\r\nin to lay their iron hand upon the country, which here as in other parts\r\nthey find too well prepared for them by ambition and misrule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIGNS AND OMENS.]\r\n\r\nNor do we fail to find foreshadowed here, as elsewhere upon the pages\r\nof history, the momentous event. There were startling occurrences,\r\nsuch as conflagrations and locust ravages; there was a ball of fire,\r\nwhich for many evenings rose in the east and followed the path of the\r\nsun; and there were other like omens. When the troubled priests went\r\nto seek an explanation from the oracular black stone at Cahbaha, their\r\nawe was increased by finding it broken in twain. In 1520 cholera swept\r\nthe Cakchiquel country, followed in 1521 by the small-pox, which, after\r\ndesolating Mexico, fell upon these southern provinces and carried off\r\nhalf the population, including the two kings and the flower of the\r\nnobility, leaving gaunt famine in its trail by way of remembrance.\r\nAmid such presages it was that the news came of the achievements of\r\nthe white men in Montezuma's realms, of their wonderful war enginery\r\nand invincible prowess. Less awed by these reports, the Quichés, who\r\nhad probably suffered less from epidemics, prepared to resist the\r\nprospective invasion with the same determination that they had formerly\r\nshown against the Aztecs; but the Cakchiquels were more broken in power\r\nand spirit, and more inclined to welcome the new-comers, particularly\r\nsince the Quichés were again becoming dangerous.[XXII-5]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KING BELEHE QAT.]\r\n\r\nThus stood affairs when the two messengers of Alvarado appeared at\r\nPatinamit. On their arrival at the capital they were peaceably received.\r\nWhen admitted into the presence of King Belehe Qat[XXII-6] they were\r\nasked if they had been sent by Malinche,[XXII-7] and whether they had\r\ncome on great sea monsters similar to those that had been seen off\r\nthe coast the year before,[XXII-8] and whether they were accustomed to\r\ntell the truth; whereupon they made answer that they had come from the\r\nemperor of the world, and from his invincible captain, who, though no\r\ngod,[XXII-9] had found his way hither to show them the path to paradise.\r\nTheir journey had been by land, they said, and they would by no means\r\nlie, their truthfulness being as unvarying as the polar star. Then\r\none of them[XXII-10] drew an enormous carac with six masts, and, Peter\r\nMartyr adds, as many decks, which was indeed a fair specimen of Spanish\r\nveracity. The Indian nobles gazed in wonder at the enormous vessel, with\r\nits sails, and spars, and countless ropes, and thought it must indeed\r\nbe a true representation, since there were so many adjuncts.\r\n\r\nAt length the king spoke. \"How is it that the Spaniards are so\r\ninvincible, being no larger than other men?\" \"In the God of heaven our\r\nstrength lies!\" came the answer; \"He whose holy law we proclaim, he\r\ngives us victories, lending us courage sharp like iron, and intelligence\r\npowerful like caged thunder, and beasts withal, which are in themselves\r\na host.\" And the diplomatic Apelles drew a colossal horse, of fierce\r\naspect, mounted by a man. The spectators were awe-stricken. Right\r\nwillingly now would the king enter into an alliance with these wonderful\r\nbeings. He would supply them with fifty thousand warriors if they would\r\noverthrow the neighboring foes who were devastating his land. Alas!\r\nfor ready friendship, the humble offer of vassalage, and open hand;\r\npeaceful policy or bold defiance alike led to the oppressor's yoke.\r\nThe embassadors were dismissed, promising to report the ruler's wishes\r\nto their commander, and gayly they went their way, accompanied by five\r\nthousand slaves, laden with the products and manufactures of the land,\r\nwith cacao, maize, and poultry, besides raiment, and vases, and jewelry\r\nto the value of twenty thousand pesos de oro.[XXII-11]\r\n\r\nOn receiving this earnest of advantage Alvarado hastened back to impart\r\nthe news to his chief and to assist him in plans for conquest. It\r\nwas determined to advance at once by sea and land. A force of forty\r\nSpaniards, mostly carpenters and seamen, was despatched to Zacatula, on\r\nthe Pacific coast, to engage in ship-building, as an aid to proposed\r\nconquest and colonization. We find, moreover, that during this same\r\nyear, 1522, two Spanish envoys, with certain natives of Mexico and of\r\nthe province of Soconusco, were sent to Utatlan and Guatemala,[XXII-12]\r\nand on their return they met Cortés at Tuxpan,[XXII-13] on his way\r\nback from Pánuco, where he had been engaged in pacification. About\r\none hundred[XXII-14] embassadors accompanied these messengers, sent\r\nby the rulers of those cities to tender friendship and service to the\r\nking of Spain. Nothing could be more courteous and dignified than the\r\nbearing of Cortés while accepting this allegiance, as he terms it, and\r\nthe costly offerings of gold ware, rare plumes, and feathered tapestry\r\nbrought by the Indian envoys; and again were produced and presented with\r\nimposing mien the gewgaws of Spain. Especial favor and kind treatment,\r\nthe embassadors were assured, should be extended to these princes and\r\ntheir subjects, inasmuch as this tender of friendship was voluntary and\r\nin good faith. An appropriate display of warlike power was made before\r\nthe visitors, who were then dismissed.[XXII-15]\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of 1523, however, rumors reached Cortés that these\r\nallies were scarcely to be relied on, and that the settlers in Soconusco\r\nwere molested by inroads from the southern provinces.[XXII-16] Although\r\nthe truth of the reports was doubtful, Cortés deemed it not adverse\r\nto his interests to regard them as true, for there were advantages\r\nin the conquest of rich provinces which peaceful possession could not\r\ngive.[XXII-17].\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of the districts being thus resolved on, naturally the\r\nleadership fell to Alvarado, who had already taken some steps in that\r\ndirection, as we have seen. He had probably stronger claims upon Cortés\r\nthan any captain in the Mexican conquest, having shared with him, as\r\nsecond in command, many desperate battles and many brilliant triumphs.\r\nPerhaps more so than with any of the others, his character was apparent\r\non the surface: reckless, impetuous, merciless, lacking in veracity if\r\nnot in common honesty, he was still zealous and courageous; and with\r\nhis native dexterity, and past experiences under Grijalva and Cortés,\r\nhe may now be called an able commander. If less staid and regular than\r\nOlid, his loyalty was regarded as above suspicion. At all events, the\r\ngeneral could not himself undertake the work, and the best proxy was\r\nthis captain.[XXII-18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSONNEL OF THE EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nPreparations were begun early in 1523. A force was quickly organized,\r\nbut operations were diverted by the inopportune arrival at Pánuco of\r\nthe adelantado Francisco de Garay, who endeavored to supplant Cortés in\r\nthat quarter. Alvarado was therefore despatched against the interloper,\r\nand it was not until the 6th of December that the expedition set out\r\nfor Guatemala. It was a gallant array, as finally formed, the very\r\nflower of New Spain chivalry, one hundred and twenty horsemen, three\r\nhundred infantry, of whom one hundred and thirty were cross-bowmen and\r\narquebusiers, and over twenty thousand picked native warriors.[XXII-19]\r\nSpiritual guides were present in the persons of two friars and two\r\narmy chaplains.[XXII-20] And it was a proud moment for Alvarado as he\r\nmarched out of the Mexican capital the chief commander of that brilliant\r\ncompany, the panoplies of the cavalry glittering high above the flashing\r\nhelmets of the infantry, while the long sombre line of swarthy allies\r\nwas broken here and there by the colored insignia and gaudy plumes of\r\nsome great chieftain. For a little way Cortés himself rode beside his\r\nsubordinate and friend, reiterating his instructions, charging him\r\nspecially to render punctually his report, and such a one as would be\r\nacceptable to his majesty. Nor was the parting devoid of pleasure, for\r\none would be rid of sometimes unpleasant interference in affairs at the\r\ncapital, while the other would be independent of any superior.[XXII-21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AT TEHUANTEPEC.]\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the dry season; and the time of year, the\r\nweather, and the condition of the roads all were favorable, so that\r\nthe southward march promised to be an easy one. After turning aside to\r\nquell an insurrection in the mountains of Tehuantepec[XXII-22] Alvarado\r\ncontinued his course, and on the 12th of January, 1524, wrote to Cortés\r\nfrom Tehuantepec city, where he had been received in all friendship and\r\nwith reiterated expressions of allegiance. He then entered the province\r\nof Soconusco, upon whose people the Spanish yoke seemed to rest a little\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nThe shadows which flit behind substantial record in Soconusco's history\r\nrepresent the people as independent for ages and in the usual state\r\nof chronic warfare with their neighbors,[XXII-23] by reason whereof\r\nthey became so weakened as to fall under the sway of the Olmecs, who\r\noppressed them almost beyond endurance. Numbers indeed abandoned their\r\nhomes, leaving many tracts nearly depopulated. Under Aztec domination,\r\nhowever, they regained somewhat their strength, and when the Europeans\r\ncame the district was quite populous and advanced in civilization. And\r\nnow, when the purposes of the Spaniards were made known to them, they\r\nturned and joined the nations of Guatemala confederated for resistance.\r\n\r\nAt no great distance from the Tehuantepec border Alvarado first\r\nencountered serious opposition, and before the Guatemalan border was\r\nreached many patriots had been punished and many freemen made slaves.\r\nThe subjugation of the Soconuscans was decided by a pitched battle at\r\nTonalá a town of fifty thousand inhabitants,[XXII-24] where a large\r\narmy under a Quiché prince was defeated.[XXII-25] At the border of\r\nGuatemala proper the army entered, early in February, the dense forests\r\nof Zapotitlan,[XXII-26] now Costa Cuca and Costa Grande. For three days\r\nthey marched in the shadow of lofty evergreens, through uninhabited\r\nwilds, skirting pestiferous swamps or plunging into snake-infested\r\ncanebrakes; now hacking their way through thickets, now fording\r\nhigh-banked streams or scaling rugged hill-sides, while painted macaws\r\nscreamed at them, and poisonous insects left their sting. Amidst the\r\ncustomary prayings and cursings they struggled forward, and finally\r\nemerged from the forest and entered cultivated lands.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPROACH TO ZAPOTITLAN.]\r\n\r\nMessengers had been sent forward summoning the provinces in due form to\r\nallegiance. And now were captured three natives, believed to be spies\r\nfrom the city of Zapotitlan,[XXII-27] who were despatched with a second\r\nrequirement, to which there was no response. The Spaniards then advanced\r\nalong a broad open highway, and soon after entered a narrower road,\r\nwhich they found barricaded; whereupon they pitched camp in an open\r\nplain near by. On a height beyond a deep ravine, through which flowed a\r\nriver,[XXII-28] stood the city, bathed in the bright rays of the setting\r\nsun, like a beautiful maiden arrayed for the sacrifice. Between the\r\nplain and the city the ground was thickly covered with plantations of\r\ncacao, which would materially impede the action of cavalry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESULT OF BATTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had not long to wait attack. In the dusk of evening\r\na small band sprang from cover and slew a number of the allies. The\r\ncavalry were thereupon ordered to sweep the plain. They came upon a\r\nlarge force, and a skirmish ensued in which some of the horses were\r\ninjured. Alvarado's blood was now up, and he ordered an immediate\r\nmarch on the city. No serious opposition was encountered until the\r\narmy came to the ravine, spanned by a narrow, rudely built wooden\r\nbridge, the crossing of which was fiercely contested by a large body\r\nof warriors. The artillery was accordingly brought into action and did\r\nefficient service. The doomed natives fought well, rallying again and\r\nagain under the frightful havoc of the guns, until a great breastwork\r\nwas formed of their slain. At length the cavalry, under cover of a\r\nheavy fire, succeeded in forcing a way across the stream and began\r\nto climb the height to a bench overlooking the ravine. The infantry\r\nfollowed. The passage was made in the midst of the fiercest attacks;\r\nbut Alvarado protected his rear with consummate skill, and soon he had\r\nthe satisfaction of drawing up his troops on the open ground above,\r\nsafe from molestation. In the streets of the city, which the army now\r\nentered, the natives made another desperate effort to save themselves;\r\nbut without avail. Those terrible guns! those terrible horses! that\r\nlife-compelling steel, falling with a force and precision worthy the\r\ndeath-dealing enginery of the gods! For half a league beyond the town\r\nthe allies were permitted to pursue and slay, after which the victors\r\ntook up their quarters in the abandoned market-place, where for two days\r\nthey rested and reconnoitred.[XXII-29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF GUATEMALA BEGUN.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY-MARCH, 1524.\r\n\r\n     OVERTURES OF KICAB TANUB TO THE LORDS OF THE ZUTUGILS\r\n     AND CAKCHIQUELS—DEATH OF THE QUICHÉ KING—TECUM UMAM HIS\r\n     SUCCESSOR—GATHERS A GREAT ARMY—INTRENCHES HIMSELF AT\r\n     ZACAHA—PASSAGE OF PALAHUNOH BY THE SPANIARDS—A SKIRMISH—A\r\n     BLOODY ENGAGEMENT—QUEZALTENANGO ESTABLISHED—THE ARMY\r\n     ADVANCES ON XELAHUH—THE CITY—BATTLE OF XELAHUH—TECUM UMAM\r\n     SLAIN—FORCIBLE PROSELYTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF KICAB TANTUB.]\r\n\r\nAs we may well imagine, the presence of the conquering army created\r\na profound sensation throughout the whole Quiché dominion. They\r\nwere a warlike people, rulers and subjects, and proud withal. It is\r\nstated that while Alvarado was yet in Soconusco, Kicab Tanub, king\r\nof Utatlan, had endeavored to bring the lord of the Zutugils and the\r\nlord of the Cakchiquels into a combination which he was forming for\r\npurposes of defence against the approaching army. But they haughtily\r\ndeclined the overtures; one because the Quiché king had secretly aided\r\na rebellious vassal of his, and the other because he felt sufficiently\r\npowerful to defend his gates against all comers. The ruler of the\r\nCakchiquels,[XXIII-1] indeed, declared openly for the Spaniards, while\r\nthe king of the Zutugils was so insulting in his rejection of the\r\nproposed confederation that King Kicab Tanub was deeply humiliated.\r\nHis chagrin, added to the anxieties attending preparations for defence,\r\nbrought on a fever, from which he died in a few days. He was succeeded\r\nby his son, Tecum Umam.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all the forces of the kingdom were placed under arms, and a\r\ngeneral muster of allies and tributaries was appointed to be held at\r\nTotonicapan. Thither marched Tecum Umam at the head of sixty thousand\r\nwarriors, and he was soon joined by a still larger force. With this\r\narmy he occupied the table-land on which stood the strong city of\r\nXelahuh,[XXIII-2] and which overlooked the ravines of the Tziha and\r\nthe Olintepec. Ten lords governed this city, and with all their armies\r\nbrilliantly equipped they went to the assistance of the Quiché monarch.\r\nNever since the days of the great Kicab[XXIII-3] had there been seen on\r\nthe Central American plateau a military display so imposing. Redoubtable\r\nwarriors were there, made fierce of aspect by the skins of wild beasts,\r\nthe lion, the jaguar, and the bear, and a vast array of fighting men,\r\ntwo hundred thousand and more,[XXIII-4] while conspicuous above them\r\nall in military splendor was the Quiché king and the royal retinue.\r\nOn one side of the elevated plain was Zacaha, a line of fortifications\r\ncommanding the defile through the mountains by which the invading army\r\nhad to enter. The place was now strengthened by throwing up round\r\nmany of the hills stone walls, along the sides of which a ditch was\r\ncarried, set with poisonous stakes. A number of military machines\r\nwere constructed, such as towers on wheels, and catapults for hurling\r\nmissiles, which would have done honor to the man-killing profession\r\nof any European nation of that day. There King Tecum Umam intrenched\r\nhimself and awaited the incoming army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PALAHUNOH PASS.]\r\n\r\nAnd to this inland plateau, in the very heart of the Quiché country,\r\nAlvarado was now with difficulty making his way through a narrow gorge\r\nof the sierra, leaving the people of Zapotitlan quite subdued. After\r\ncrossing two rapid rivers a steep ascent six leagues in length was\r\nbegun, leading to Palahunoh, as the pass was called. It was indeed a\r\nrugged way, more in the nature of a height to be scaled than an opening\r\nin a chain of mountains. So severe were the struggles with nature and\r\nSatan, to whom these stubborn soldiers ascribed most ills, that their\r\nformer troubles seemed to them as pastime now. The place was so steep\r\nand rough that it was with the utmost difficulty the horses, plunging\r\nand struggling, could make their way up. It was impossible to accomplish\r\nthe whole distance in one day, and the panting and foot-sore army, too\r\nexhausted to proceed farther,[XXIII-5] was ordered to encamp when half\r\nthe ascent had been made. The next day through similar efforts they\r\nreached the summit, where a woman and a dog were found sacrificed, in\r\ntoken of defiance and challenge to war, as the interpreters explained.\r\n\r\nDuring the descent to the plain, at no great distance, in a narrow part\r\nof the pass, a strong breastwork of undefended palisades was discovered,\r\nquite incomprehensible to the Spaniards, as a few men properly disposed\r\ncould have held the place against any invading army.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the ground was still so unfavorable for cavalry that\r\nAlvarado sent forward the infantry, and presently the enemy was\r\nencountered. A body of three or four thousand fell upon the allies and\r\nthrew them into confusion. The cross-bowmen, however, came to their\r\nsupport, and soon the entire infantry were engaged in the contest,\r\nwhich was carried on along the hill-tops and down the slopes until\r\nthe ravine of Olintepec River was reached. There the Spaniards were\r\ndrawn into an ambuscade, formed by over six thousand warriors from\r\nUtatlan, from whom they received some wounds.[XXIII-6] The troops were\r\nsoon collected on the other side of the ravine, however; but none too\r\nsoon, for presently was seen advancing with bold front a detachment\r\nof the grand army, thirty thousand strong, as if to annihilate them at\r\none blow. Fortunately the ground here was level and favorable for the\r\ncavalry. The horses being greatly fatigued, Alvarado determined to wait\r\ntill the last moment before charging. After permitting the enemy to\r\namuse themselves with the allies during a brief breathing space, their\r\nconfidence momentarily increasing, the commander at length gave the\r\norder to the impatient horsemen, who swept forward instantly like an\r\navalanche, and as if the hills indeed had fallen on them the affrighted\r\nQuichés scattered. Mad Ajax among the defenceless sheep took not more\r\nlives than did each Spaniard on that day. Like sheep the poor natives\r\nscattered, and like sheep they were pursued and slaughtered.[XXIII-7]\r\n\r\nA league farther brought the thirsty troops to some springs, but the\r\nperiod of refreshment was short. At hand was a yet more formidable\r\nnative force, led by Prince Ahzumanche, one of the highest among the\r\nrelatives and officers of the king.\r\n\r\nThe engagement which followed was exceptionably bloody. The Quichés\r\napproached over the extensive plains, and when they had arrived at a\r\nposition favorable for the Spaniards to make the attack the horsemen\r\ncharged upon them. But the Quichés were better on their guard than\r\nbefore. Recovered from their panic, and animated by the example of their\r\nleader, they displayed greater bravery this time, standing the shock\r\nunflinchingly,[XXIII-8] fighting foot to foot, or banded two and three\r\ntogether, endeavoring by their own strength to overthrow the horses,\r\nseizing them by mane and tail, and trying to pull them down, and laying\r\nhold of the riders to unhorse them. The Spaniards were indeed closely\r\nbeset, and for a time it seemed by no means certain that victory would\r\nfinally declare for them. But what naked power could long withstand the\r\nsteady fire of arquebuse and cross-bow, the steady fall of sword-blow\r\nand lance-thrust!\r\n\r\nRelaxing their efforts for a moment, the natives were charged by the\r\ncavalry with deadly result, and were trampled under foot by hundreds,\r\nand speedily routed. For a league they were followed with great havoc,\r\ntill they took refuge in a stronghold of the sierra. By pretending\r\nflight, however, Alvarado drew them from their position to the open\r\nplain, and then wheeled and fell upon them. The carnage for a time was\r\ndreadful; the ground was covered with the mangled bodies of the dead\r\nand dying, and the waters of the Olintepec ran crimson with blood. And\r\nhenceforth the stream was called Xequiqel, that is to say, River of\r\nBlood.[XXIII-9]\r\n\r\nAmong the fallen was Prince Ahzumanche, and a number of the nobility\r\nand chiefs. The contest being over, the army encamped for the night at\r\nthe springs before mentioned. The loss to the Spaniards, as usual, was\r\ninsignificant.[XXIII-10]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A MAGNIFICENT PRIZE.]\r\n\r\nLet us pause for a moment to review the position of the invaders. They\r\nhad surmounted with irresistible progress the coast range, had crossed\r\nthe summit, fought their way down the corresponding slopes, and were\r\nwithin a league of Xelahuh, the great stronghold of the Quichés, on\r\ntheir western confines. All the defences to it had been won, the Zacaha\r\nfortifications had been carried, passive nature's majestic guardianship\r\nhad been overcome, and human opposition had proved futile. Far behind\r\nthem stood the deadly forest through which they had struggled; over the\r\ngolden-edged hills, the rugged steep by which they had made their way\r\nhither. Around them now were open pine woods,[XXIII-11] and at their\r\nfeet the wide cultivated plains of the table-lands on which the sun\r\nshed its uninterrupted rays. Dotted with towns and parti-colored with\r\nmaize-fields and orchards, silver-threaded by streams, the landscape\r\ndisplayed before the Spaniards the picture of a paradise. And this\r\nbeautiful realm now lay helpless in the conqueror's grasp, its very\r\nair[XXIII-12] becoming traitorous by refreshing and invigorating\r\nthe invaders, bracing their nerves and inspiring their hearts to new\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt dawn the Spanish camp was astir; and while the voices of Christian\r\npriests chanting praises to God for past victories floated over the\r\nhideous battle-field, Christian soldiers were buckling on their armor\r\nfor the further butchering of helpless human beings who had done them\r\nno harm. A hermitage and a town were established at Zacaha, the former\r\nunder the charge of Friar Francisco Martinez de Pontaza,[XXIII-13]\r\nwhose memory was ever after fragrant in those parts, the latter under\r\nthe direction of Juan de Leon Cardona.[XXIII-14] The natives of the\r\nsubjugated neighborhood finally came in and helped to swell the numbers\r\nof the town, which was called Quezaltenango.[XXIII-15]\r\n\r\nThese measures taken,[XXIII-16] the army advanced on Xelahuh,[XXIII-17]\r\nonly to find it abandoned. The inhabitants, terror-stricken at the\r\nsuccess of the invaders, had fled to the mountains. Alvarado took up his\r\nquarters in the deserted city, where for six days he remained, resting\r\nand reconnoitring.[XXIII-18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GRAND ARMY.]\r\n\r\nTecum Umam was an ambitious prince and a brave commander. With no small\r\nconcern he had seen defeated one after another the forces sent against\r\nthe foe, and he now resolved to take the field in person. About noon on\r\nthe seventh day of their sojourn at Xelahuh the Spaniards saw converging\r\nto that point from every quarter dense masses of warriors.[XXIII-19]\r\nWell aware that his great strength lay in the cavalry, Alvarado with\r\na large part of his force[XXIII-20] hastened to occupy an open plain,\r\nthree leagues in length, at no great distance from the city. Tecum\r\nUmam was shrewd enough to comprehend the manœuvre, and before the last\r\nSpaniard was a bow-shot from camp the Quiché army in two principal\r\ndivisions was upon them. Alvarado had divided his cavalry into two\r\nbodies, commanded respectively by Pedro Puertocarrero and Hernando\r\nde Chaves, who were directed to assail at different points one of the\r\nopposing bodies when well in position, while the infantry, commanded by\r\nhimself, were to engage with the other. The onset was terrible. Through\r\nand through the dense columns rush the horsemen, heedless alike of\r\nthe flint-tipped arrow, the javelin with fire-hardened point, and the\r\nslung pebble. Resistance was not possible. Plunged through and hurled\r\nto earth, crushed beneath the horses' hoofs, the broken ranks of this\r\ndivision sought the protection of the other. Thus half of Tecum's last\r\nhope was lost, while the other half was fast dwindling. Early in the\r\ncombat the Quiché king had recognized the conspicuous figure of the\r\nmounted Spanish commander, and as Tecum now saw his forces broken by the\r\ncavalry, he determined upon one last desperate effort. Gathering around\r\nhim a few chosen warriors, he threw himself in person upon Alvarado,\r\nand with his own hand so wounded his horse that the Spaniard was obliged\r\nto fall back and mount another. A second and a third time the undaunted\r\nwarrior assailed his superior foe, till pierced by Alvarado's lance he\r\nfell, staining with his life-blood the ground he had fought so bravely\r\nto defend.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that the heavenly powers deigned to help the poor\r\nnatives in their dire struggle with the steel-clad Europeans, as was\r\nso frequently the case with the Spaniards. The gods usually prefer\r\nfighting on the strongest side; but here we find an exception. It is my\r\nduty to relate, as a truthful historian, that during the mortal combat\r\nbetween these two leaders an eagle with great pinions was observed by\r\nthe Quiché army circling round and round the Spanish commander, ever and\r\nanon swooping down upon him, and with beak and claw attacking him about\r\nthe head. It was the _nagual_, the guardian spirit of Tecum Umam. But\r\nless strong than Alvarado's lance, it was discomfited at the moment of\r\nthe monarch's death, and disappeared from the sight of the vanquished\r\nQuichés.[XXIII-21]\r\n\r\nContrary to the usual course pursued by natives in warfare, the fall of\r\ntheir commander did not immediately disperse the Quiché warriors, but\r\nseemed rather to enrage them; for the moment after there fell upon the\r\nSpaniards such a blinding tempest of javelins as would have delighted\r\nthe Spartan Dieneces. It was but for a moment, however; it was their\r\nlast expiring effort, for soon the cavalry came thundering on their\r\nflanks, dispersing and slaying after the usual fashion. For two leagues\r\nalong the plain they were pursued by the horsemen, who then turned and\r\nrode back, repeating the carnage over the same field. The slaughter\r\nwas particularly bloody at a stream on one side of the plain, and the\r\ncommander proudly refers to it in his despatch.[XXIII-22] The infantry\r\ncaptured a vast multitude which had taken refuge from the insatiate\r\nhorsemen on a hill near by.\r\n\r\nThus ended another day in the annals of the grand extermination, a day\r\ndark indeed for the noble Quiché nation, but of which European progress\r\nand propagandizing might well be proud.[XXIII-23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSUASIVE PROSELYTING.]\r\n\r\nBy this crushing defeat the Quichés were humbled and their confidence\r\nin their deities, not to say themselves, was weakened. Though in great\r\ngrief at the loss of their chief and the triumph of the Spaniards, an\r\nopportunity was given them through the preaching of the priests Torres\r\nand Pontaza to embrace the religion of their conquerors. Four captive\r\nchieftains[XXIII-24] of Xelahuh were baptized and received their\r\nliberty. Christian raiment with swords was then given them and they\r\nwere entertained at the table of Alvarado.[XXIII-25] After this they\r\nwere sent out as missionaries to their affrighted brethren, bringing\r\nquite a number to a knowledge of the Savior. They also aided in erecting\r\na more suitable hermitage at Zacaha, and in building houses for the\r\nDonatís.[XXIII-26] Nay more; in their growing enthusiasm they suggested\r\nthat the place where Tonatiuh had gained his crowning victory, and over\r\nwhich still hung the odor of corruption and blood, the blood of their\r\nslain countrymen, should be called by the name of Espíritu Santo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nDOWNFALL OF THE QUICHÉ NATION.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1524.\r\n\r\n     UTATLAN, CAPITAL OF THE QUICHÉS—ITS MAGNIFICENCE—THE ROYAL\r\n     PALACE AND PYRAMIDAL FORTIFICATIONS—PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND\r\n     GARDENS—PLAN TO ENTRAP THE SPANIARDS—A FEAST PREPARED—THE\r\n     ENEMY INVITED—THE TREACHERY DISCOVERED—MASTERLY RETREAT OF\r\n     ALVARADO—THE QUICHÉ KING AND NOBLES ENTRAPPED—THEY ARE MADE\r\n     TO GATHER GOLD—AND ARE THEN DESTROYED—UTATLAN BURNED AND THE\r\n     COUNTRY DEVASTATED—SUBJUGATION OF THE QUICHÉS COMPLETE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the central plateau, near the present town of Santa Cruz del\r\nQuiché, stood Utatlan,[XXIV-1] the ancient capital of the Quiché\r\nnation. It was surrounded by a deep ravine, and could be entered only\r\nat two points. To one of these entrances over thirty stone steps led\r\nup an almost perpendicular cliff; to the other a narrow artificial\r\ncauseway, connected at one point by a bridge which could be easily\r\ndestroyed. The city was further strengthened by the grim fortress of\r\nAtalaya, four stories in height, and the pyramidal fortification of\r\nEl Resguardo,[XXIV-2] one hundred and twenty feet high. In wealth and\r\nsplendor Utatlan, in which twenty generations of the present dynasty had\r\nreigned, vied with the city of the Aztec kings and the gardened capital\r\nof the Incas. In its centre stood the royal palace, surrounded by the\r\nimposing residences of the nobles, and beyond, the humbler dwellings of\r\nthe common people. The palace was one of the most magnificent structures\r\nof Central America. It was built of hewn stone of various colors, mosaic\r\nin appearance, and its colossal dimensions, and elegant and stately\r\narchitectural form, excited mingled awe and admiration.[XXIV-3]\r\n\r\nWithin the lofty portals the quarters of the household guards,\r\nsurrounding a spacious barrack yard, were first presented to view.\r\nDusky warriors, lancers, and archers, clad in wildly picturesque garbs\r\nof dappled tiger-skins or sombre bear-hides, in brilliant plumes and\r\npolished arms, with silent tread measured the well paved court. In the\r\nprincipal apartments near at hand the various arms and paraphernalia of\r\nbattle lay ready for immediate use, while on the walls hung hard-won\r\ntrophies of war. Next lay the residence of the unmarried princes, and\r\nbeyond this the palace proper, containing besides the apartments of\r\nthe monarch the council-chamber, with the gorgeous throne canopied with\r\ncostly tapestry of feather work of rare designs and wrought with cunning\r\nskill; also the royal treasury, the hall of justice, and the armory.\r\nThree separate suites of rooms, for morning, afternoon, and night, were\r\neach day occupied by the monarch, and all these more private apartments\r\nlooked out upon delightful gardens, with trees, and flowers, and fruits,\r\nand in their midst menageries and aviaries, with rare and curious\r\ncollections. Beyond lay the separate palaces of the monarch's queens\r\nand concubines, with their baths, and gardens, and miniature lakes;\r\nand lastly the maidens' college, in which were reared and educated the\r\nfemale offspring of royal blood.\r\n\r\nAnd all this was but one pile of buildings, the largest, it is true; but\r\nthere were others of no mean pretensions, the residences of the nobles\r\nand of the wealthy trading class. Of a truth Utatlan was a fine city,\r\nand a strong and noble one. And must it now be yielded to the spoiler?\r\nIs there no hope? None. Then perish all, for who would live with king\r\nand country gone; and with its occupants, also this fair capital which\r\nso long has harbored kings. Ah! if this strong trap could but be baited,\r\nand the white foxes enticed thereto and strangled. Rare thought! It were\r\nworth dying a dozen times to see these braggarts but once die. And so\r\nthe Quiché cunning ones determined. In general council it was agreed\r\nthat the Spaniards should be invited to a feast, and while there the\r\ncity should be burned and brought down upon their heads!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OXIB QUIEH SUCCEEDS TECUM UMAM.]\r\n\r\nBy the death of Tecum Umam his son Oxib Quieh[XXIV-4] succeeded to the\r\nthrone. His situation was not an enviable one. The best troops, in fact\r\nthe very flower of the nation, had been destroyed or scattered. His\r\nfather, with numbers of the first men of the land, had fallen, without\r\nhaving in a single instance gained a battle or baffled the foe. Their\r\npuny efforts were as gnats stinging or destroying a band of wild boars.\r\n\r\nYet the grandson of the great Kicab Tanub would not abandon the field\r\nwithout a struggle. The council might burn the city if they chose. And\r\nthough their hopes and the prospects of success were great, the king and\r\nhis nobles relaxed none the less their efforts to raise fresh troops.\r\nShould the plan fail, they would again take the field. Not only did\r\nOxib Quieh draw all the forces possible from his own provinces, but\r\nhe adopted every means to smooth the differences that existed between\r\nhimself and the neighboring provinces. By these exertions at length a\r\nstrong league was formed, and again the natives in formidable numbers\r\nwere ready to do battle for their gods and their country at the proper\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThese preparations completed, an embassy with presents of gold was\r\ndespatched to greet the conqueror, to sue for peace, and to tender\r\ntheir king's submission as vassal to the king of Spain. Alvarado was\r\nalso invited to the court of Utatlan, where the king was waiting to\r\noffer in person his allegiance and entertain with all due honor the\r\nredoubtable Spaniard. Alvarado graciously accepted both the presents and\r\nthe invitation, and made presents in return, and on the following day\r\nset out with his army to pay the promised visit. It was quite natural\r\non both sides, the invitation and the acceptance. Here were war and a\r\nconquered country; here the conquered with overtures of peace; and so\r\nthe Spaniards marched into the trap without suspicion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PLOT DISCOVERED.]\r\n\r\nBut as they passed along the narrow causeway and came to the bridge,\r\ncertain soldiers[XXIV-5] fancied they saw where it had been recently\r\nweakened. When the attention of Alvarado was called to it he made no\r\nalarm, nor did he turn a moment from his course. He relished the flavor\r\nof such an adventure, and grasping his sword the tighter he commanded\r\nthe strictest caution and the closest observation. On entering the city\r\nthe suspicions of the Spaniards were confirmed. The men were armed; the\r\nwomen and children had been withdrawn; there were few provisions at hand\r\nand little valuable merchandise in the storehouses; in many buildings\r\nthroughout the city brush and firewood had been deposited, while the\r\nanxiety displayed in the uneasy deportment of the natives themselves\r\ncould not be disguised. It was observed, too, that the streets were so\r\nnarrow and the houses so compact that it would be impossible for the\r\ncavalry to move; and lastly, the Quezaltenango allies who accompanied\r\nthe Spaniards obtained and brought to Alvarado positive information of\r\nthe intentions of the Quiché chiefs.[XXIV-6]\r\n\r\nNot only are prompt measures now necessary, but they must be such as\r\nwill not arouse the suspicions of a most suspicious foe, whose keen\r\neyes are watching every movement. Without formally summoning a council\r\nAlvarado moves in holiday mien among his officers, dropping here a hint\r\nand laying there a stern command; meanwhile, outwardly undisturbed, he\r\nrides forward into the nest of nobles awaiting him and greets them with\r\na frank smile amid renewed protestations of friendship. This done he\r\nlooks about for the disposal of the horses. They are worshipful brutes,\r\nin some respects the equals and even the superiors of men; they are\r\nnot given to feasting like men, but they must not be forgotten at the\r\nfeast. Their greatest delight will be to feed upon the open plain; he\r\nwill conduct them there and return without delay. Greatly disconcerted\r\nthe nobles press the Tonatiuh to immediate entertainment, which even\r\nnow awaits him; under the direction of the soldiers they will provide\r\nthe best care for the noble animals. By no means, Alvarado intimates;\r\nthe horses will never forgive him if he neglects them on so important\r\nan occasion. Thus all the Spaniards return over the causeway, and the\r\nweakened bridge, and with a feeling of intense relief reach the plain\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nNow for a sweet morsel of revenge. While gathering grass for the\r\nhorses the soldiers are fired on from the ravines and thickets, and\r\none Spaniard, a servant of the commander, is killed. The king and his\r\nnobles, who remain near the city entrance, on witnessing the outrage\r\nfrom this distance are distressed, and take measures to prevent hostile\r\ndemonstrations on the part of their people. Alvarado pretends to regard\r\nit all as of no moment, and continues his attitude of confidence and\r\ncordiality with the chiefs. It is unfortunate, this accident of the\r\nservant; but after what has happened probably the feast had better be\r\npostponed. As a further mark of friendship and esteem, will Oxib Quieh\r\nand his companions look in upon the camp of the Spaniards? Poor boy!\r\nSo easily caught, and in a trap, a steel one, quite different from the\r\nbungling bridge-drop at Utatlan. Now may all men open their eyes and\r\njudge as gods, for these present must die!\r\n\r\nThe mask is thrown aside, and the avenger in his wrath stands\r\nrevealed. Oxib Quieh and his caciques are seized and charged with their\r\ntreacherous intentions. Their condemnation is a matter predetermined,\r\nbut execution is delayed a little that the tiger may sport with his\r\nprey. Little gold has been gathered on this expedition, and it may be\r\nwell to put upon the scene in Guatemala the grand drama of Montezuma not\r\nlong since performed at the Mexican capital. The prisoners shall have\r\ntheir lives if they gather much gold. This done, they shall have their\r\nlives if they gather more gold. And when the kingdom is stripped of its\r\ngold and the Spaniards become impatient, a great fire is built, into\r\nwhich those of the prisoners who are not hanged are thrown alive; and\r\nthe smoke ascends to heaven as grateful incense to their god.[XXIV-7]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COURAGE OF THE QUICHÉS.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these merciless lessons, during which three of the\r\nQuiché kings, of three several generations in direct line of succession,\r\nhad been sacrificed, hostilities were speedily renewed. A fierce attack\r\nwas made on all sides, the natives issuing in great numbers from the\r\nmany ravines which intersected the neighboring ground, and the assault\r\nwas obstinately maintained for some time; but the artillery[XXIV-8]\r\ncommitted such dreadful destruction, opening through their dense\r\nmasses lanes strewn with mutilated bodies and torn-off limbs, that they\r\nspeedily recognized the futility of their attempts, and fled back to\r\nthe gulches. Keeping ever to inaccessible ground, and avoiding open\r\nengagement,[XXIV-9] they harassed the army incessantly, by cutting off\r\nstragglers and inflicting harm in any way that they were able. At length\r\nAlvarado determined upon the plan of burning their city and devastating\r\nthe country; and he sent to the friendly king of the Cakchiquels,\r\nrequesting a contingent of troops to assist him in dislodging the\r\nQuichés from their fastnesses. Four thousand warriors were at once\r\nsent[XXIV-10] by the submissive lord, with which additional force, and\r\nthe energetic measures he pursued, Alvarado carried on the process of\r\nsubjection with effect. The warlike Quichés, their city burned,[XXIV-11]\r\ntheir crops destroyed, hunted from one retreat to another, driven from\r\ntheir lands, at length were forced to yield. Alvarado received their\r\novertures with generosity. He pardoned the repentant in his great mercy,\r\nand promised them their lives, at the same time ordering them to return\r\nand occupy their lands. He moreover released two captive sons of the\r\nroyal line and put them in possession of their father's realm, the\r\nleading monarch being named Sequechul.[XXIV-12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENSLAVEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThus was terminated for a time the struggle of the Quichés for\r\nindependence—a struggle that ceased only with the destruction of their\r\nprincipal nobility and all the bravest warriors of the nation. To their\r\nobstinate valor the conqueror himself bears testimony,[XXIV-13] and\r\nrecognizing the difficulties of his position, and how man of himself\r\ncan do so little, he begs Cortés to order in the Mexican capital\r\na procession of all the clergy, so that the virgin might help him.\r\nAnd further, would he \"please take care to inform his Majesty how we\r\nare serving him with our persons and means, and at our own cost, in\r\norder that his Majesty may reward us?\" Nor did the lieutenant fail\r\nto report that his majesty's interests had been carefully attended\r\nto, all captives taken in the war having been branded and reduced to\r\nslavery.[XXIV-14] The royal fifth of these captive Quichés had been\r\ndelivered to the treasurer, Baltasar de Mendoza, who sold them at\r\nauction for the better security of the revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAKCHIQUELS AND ZUTUGILS MADE SUBJECTS OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\nAPRIL-MAY, 1524.\r\n\r\n     MARCH TO THE CAKCHIQUEL CAPITAL—WITH A BRILLIANT RETINUE\r\n     KING SINACAM COMES FORTH TO MEET THE SPANIARDS—DESCRIPTION\r\n     OF PATINAMIT—OCCUPATION OF THE CAKCHIQUEL CAPITAL—EXPEDITION\r\n     AGAINST TEPEPUL, KING OF THE ZUTUGILS—THE CLIFF CITY OF\r\n     ATITLAN—A WARM BATTLE—ENTRY INTO THE STRONGHOLD—RECONCILIATION\r\n     AND RETURN TO PATINAMIT—LOVE EPISODE OF ALVARADO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SINACAM GREETS THE SPANIARDS.]\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-general was now ready to advance, and on the 11th\r\nof April, 1524, he left Utatlan for Patinamit, the capital of the\r\nCakchiquels.[XXV-1] The weak and yielding Sinacam,[XXV-2] king of the\r\nCakchiquels, had already sent with his troops a present of gold to\r\nAlvarado, and renewed his assurances of allegiance. He now prepared to\r\nmeet him with such stately pomp as would be sure to gratify his future\r\nmaster. By this means he hoped his tottering throne might be secured to\r\nhim. Servility and profuse hospitality would surely win their hearts,\r\nhe thought; and then, with the powerful strangers on his side, he might\r\nlaugh at his enemies. As the Spanish army approached his capital he\r\nissued forth with native pageantry to meet it. He was borne aloft by\r\nhis nobles on a litter, beneath a canopy which dazzled the eye with\r\nblazing ornaments of gold and changing hues of quetzal feathers, and\r\nround him were the members of the royal family in litters scarcely less\r\nconspicuous than his own, while a large body of warriors, with their\r\nplumed head-dresses and warlike apparel, marched in the rear and on\r\neither side. Alvarado's greeting was not of that unalloyed cordiality\r\nwhich Sinacam had hoped. The Spaniard was suspicious. He had but just\r\nescaped destruction, and the late danger had taught him discretion. What\r\nhe had observed on the march had not tended to inspire confidence or\r\npromote peace of mind. All along the route despoiled corpses of slain\r\nIndians had met his sight, and the ground was discolored with human\r\nblood. Large bands of armed warriors were everywhere seen, and it was\r\nevident that the whole country was in arms. But fear was no part of\r\nAlvarado's character; therefore, when the king came near, he calmly\r\ndismounted, approached him with courteous mien, and with expressions\r\nof esteem placed in his hands a rare and curious piece of silver\r\njewelry; then he asked with sombre brow, \"Why dost thou seek to do\r\nme harm, when I come to do thee good?\" Informed of the meaning of the\r\nwords so seriously addressed to him, and conscious of his own faithful\r\nintentions, Sinacam, with calm yet somewhat severe dignity thanked him\r\nfirst for the present, replying, \"Quiet thy heart, great captain, scion\r\nof the sun, and trust in my love.\" It was then explained to Alvarado\r\nthat the warlike demonstrations he had discovered were directed against\r\na rebellious vassal, who, with the aid of the kings of the Quichés and\r\nthe Zutugils, had revolted and attempted to make himself a ruler.[XXV-3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PATINAMIT.]\r\n\r\nAlvarado professed to be satisfied, and permitted himself to be escorted\r\nby the monarch to the capital.[XXV-4] Patinamit,[XXV-5] like Utatlan,\r\nwas situated in a naturally impregnable position. It occupied an\r\nelevated plain, surrounded by ravines, the side of which nearest the\r\ncity was perpendicular to a depth of five or six hundred feet. Across\r\nthis chasm, at one point only, could entrance into the capital be\r\ngained, by means of a narrow causeway, which was closed by two gateways\r\nof stone,[XXV-6] one on each side of the city wall. This isolated\r\nplateau was about three miles long and two broad. The chronicler Fuentes\r\ndescribes the remains of this city with much minuteness, leaving vivid\r\nimpressions of its former grandeur. On one edge of the natural platform,\r\naccording to that writer, were the ruins of a magnificent building\r\none hundred paces square, of extremely well hewn stone. In front of\r\nthis edifice extended a plaza, on one side of which were the remains\r\nof a splendid palace, and in close proximity the foundations of many\r\nresidences. The city was divided by a ditch running north and south,\r\nmore than eight feet deep, and surmounted by concrete breastworks three\r\nfeet high. This was the dividing line between the dwellings of the\r\nnobles and those of the commoners. The streets were straight and wide,\r\nand extended in the direction of the four cardinal points. To the west\r\nwas a mound dominating the city, on the summit of which stood a round\r\nbuilding five to six feet high, resembling the breastwork of a well.\r\nAround this the judges held courts; but before their sentences could be\r\nexecuted they had to be confirmed by the sacred oracular stone, which\r\nwas preserved in a shrine in a deep gulch. It is described as of a black\r\ndiaphanous material, more precious than the ordinary building material.\r\nIn its gloomy transparency the demon made visible the judgments that\r\nwere to be passed. If no manifestation occurred, the accused was\r\nreleased; otherwise the sentence was carried into effect on the same\r\nmound where the judges sat in deliberation. This oracle was consulted\r\nalso in matters of war.[XXV-7]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ATITLAN.]\r\n\r\nKing Sinacam's reception of the guests in this his capital and court\r\nfully equalled his promises. Sumptuously lodged, and bountifully\r\nsupplied with all the luxuries the land could produce, Alvarado himself\r\nadmits that they could not have met kinder treatment in their own\r\nland.[XXV-8] For eight days the Spaniards feasted,[XXV-9] and in return\r\nSinacam succeeded in obtaining the aid of his powerful friends against\r\nhis hostile neighbors. Frequent conversations were held relative to\r\nthe subjugation of the Zutugils, and to insure this happy consummation\r\nSinacam expatiated on the contemptuous pride of Tepepul, king of\r\nAtitlan,[XXV-10] and his further wickedness in not tendering allegiance\r\nto the Teules.[XXV-11] It seems that the Zutugil ruler had incurred\r\nthe hatred of Sinacam by giving assistance to his rebellious vassal,\r\nAcpocaquil,[XXV-12] and making nocturnal incursions into the Cakchiquel\r\nterritory by means of canoes. These outrages were prompted partly\r\nby his reliance on the impregnable position of his city, situated on\r\nthe hanging cliffs above Lake Atitlan, seven leagues from Patinamit.\r\nAlvarado required little persuasion to engage in his favorite pastime of\r\ngold-hunting and blood-letting. He was well aware of the supercilious\r\nnature of Tepepul, and had already determined to visit him in person.\r\nWhile at Utatlan he had sent four messengers to the court of Atitlan,\r\nbearing the usual requirement; but the haughty monarch, instead of\r\npaying the respect due to so important a demand, put the messengers\r\nto death. This ruffled Alvarado, though it did not dishearten him. \"I\r\nthink,\" he writes to Cortés respecting this city, \"that with the help of\r\nour Lord we shall soon bring it to the service of his Majesty.\"[XXV-13]\r\n\r\nAlvarado would help King Sinacam, but first he would like some money\r\nfor travelling expenses. This reasonable request could not be refused;\r\nnot only was the treasure house of Patinamit emptied, but the entire\r\ndistrict, so far as possible, was stripped of its gold, jewels, and\r\nwhatever the Spaniards regarded as desirable.[XXV-14] After this the\r\nSpaniards were ready to pass into the next district and levy like\r\ntribute, with or without bloodshed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CITY TAKEN.]\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed with regularity, Alvarado again sent envoys to\r\nAtitlan, demanding that Tepepul should cease hostilities against the\r\nCakchiquels, who were the allies of the Teules, and again the ruler\r\ndisplayed his contempt by putting to death the messengers.[XXV-15]\r\nThereupon Alvarado set out with sixty cavalry, one hundred and\r\nfifty infantry, and a large body of Cakchiquels, commanded by their\r\nchiefs.[XXV-16] Meeting no opposition he advanced with thirty horse\r\nto the height above the lake, and descended over difficult ground\r\nto a level plain that lay in front of a fortified rock in the water.\r\nThis was approachable only by means of a narrow causeway, intersected\r\nat different points by wooden bridges. Near by the enemy were now\r\ndiscovered drawn up in two bodies, each eight thousand strong. They\r\nadvanced at once to the attack, armed with lances, bows and arrows,\r\nand other weapons, protected, moreover, by cotton corselets.[XXV-17] As\r\nthe rest of his forces were not far behind, Alvarado did not hesitate\r\nto charge, and when the infantry soon came up the engagement became\r\ngeneral. For some time it was most obstinately maintained, and numbers\r\nof the Spanish soldiers were wounded. The cavalry, however, succeeded\r\nas ever in breaking the enemy's lines, relieving the hard-pressed\r\nfoot-soldiers, who thereupon rallied and renewed their efforts so\r\nvigorously as soon to send the enemy rushing for the stronghold. The\r\npursuing horsemen arrived at the causeway as soon as the fugitives;\r\nhere they were obliged to dismount, as the place was impassable for\r\nhorses; yet they followed the Indians so closely that no time was given\r\nto destroy the bridges, and the Spaniards entered the fort with them.\r\nThe infantry soon came up, and though the Zutugils struggled desperately\r\nto maintain their position, the volleys of the arquebusiers made such\r\nhavoc in their ranks that at last they plunged into the lake and swam\r\nto a neighboring island, whence many of them escaped before the tardy\r\narrival of three hundred Cakchiquel canoes.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after sacking all the houses on the rock, Alvarado\r\npitched his camp in a field of maize. On the following morning he\r\nimplored divine protection and marched against Atitlan. He found the\r\ncity abandoned, his capture of what they regarded as an impregnable\r\nstronghold in the lake having so discomfited the Zutugils that they\r\ndared not contend with him for their city. At mid-day he took up\r\nposition in the capital, and at once set about to overrun and devastate\r\nthe country; but it was so rugged that the men could with difficulty\r\nmove, and he was obliged to content himself with destroying some\r\nplantations of maize and cacao.[XXV-18] He succeeded in making a few\r\ncaptives, three of whom were despatched to King Tepepul with the usual\r\ndemand of submission, accompanied by threats in case of refusal.\r\nPerceiving the necessity, the Zutugil monarch gracefully yielded,\r\nwhereupon the conqueror became gracious. He complimented the Zutugils\r\nfor their bravery, pardoned their offences, and exhorted them to remain\r\nfaithful, and to make no more war on such of their neighbors as were\r\nthe recognized subjects of the king of Spain. To give efficacy to his\r\nwords he built a strong fort in a suitable position, and left in it\r\nfour hundred and eighteen men, Spaniards and Mexican allies, under the\r\ncommand of Héctor de Chaves and Alonso del Pulgar. Then he returned to\r\nPatinamit.[XXV-19]\r\n\r\nWithin three days the lords of the lake district presented themselves,\r\nwith presents of gold and raiment. They expressed joy at becoming\r\nvassals of his majesty of Spain, for wars and woes should thenceforth\r\nbe unknown among them. The Spanish commander was extremely affable as he\r\npresented his visitors with some glass trinkets, of great value in their\r\neyes, and dismissed them with every demonstration of affection.[XXV-20]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps one reason why the play of Helen of Troy was not oftener\r\nperformed by the Spanish conquerors in America was on account of the\r\ncheapness of women there. There might be lacking gold, or pearls, or\r\nprovender, but seldom was a people found so poor that they could not\r\nfurnish the army a liberal supply of pretty slave girls. Less is found\r\nin the chronicles of this kind of traffic than of the traffic in gold\r\nand the traffic in pearls. The merchandise of morality, or rather of\r\nimmorality, was less portable than the other kinds. Women were to use\r\nand throw away; gold would keep; while pearls were usually a staple\r\narticle in the Spanish nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALVARADO IN LOVE.]\r\n\r\nNow the pious Alvarado, next to his delectable master Cortés the most\r\npious pirate in all the Indies, had tasted every iniquity condemned in\r\nhis most holy scriptures except that invented and acted by the sweet\r\npsalmist of Israel. He had severally broken every commandment of the\r\ndecalogue, then he had put them together and had broken them in every\r\nconceivable combination. But while maidens were so plump and plenty he\r\nhad never felt the desire, like good King David, to go after the wife\r\nof any Uriah the Hittite. But while enjoying the luxurious hospitality\r\nof the Cakchiquel capital, with a world to give for a new sensation,\r\nAlvarado's eye fell on the beautiful Suchil,[XXV-21] wife of King\r\nSinacam. In some respects it was the Israelitish tale reversed, for\r\nSinacam was by no means a poor man in respect of women, nor was Suchil\r\nhis only ewe lamb. The susceptible heart of the dashing commander was\r\nsmitten by the graces of this queen, and he resolved to possess her.\r\nBeing a conqueror, with a king for a slave, he might have obtained\r\nhis desire by the simple demand; but in those days there was something\r\nsacred in royalty, even in heathen and captive royalty. Sinacam was now\r\nan acknowledged subject of Spain, and as such possessed rights; besides,\r\nthat was not the way set forth by the bright exemplar of his faith.\r\n\r\nUpon some pretext, therefore, Sinacam was arrested and put in irons.\r\nGold was then demanded, and yet more gold. It was the old method of\r\nmaking the penalty supply the place of guilt and condemnation. Then\r\nSuchil was seized, I do not say unwillingly, for the Spanish commander\r\nwas fair and fascinating, and the Cakchiquel queen was after all but a\r\nwoman. Above all things on earth, or beyond the earth, Sinacam regarded\r\nher—and for her restoration he offered more jewels, and pretty maidens,\r\nay, the daughters of chieftains, by the hundred. Alvarado refused the\r\nprayer but not the offering. When love had cooled he released the king\r\nand went his way.[XXV-22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION TO SALVADOR.\r\n\r\n1524.\r\n\r\n     CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITZCUINTLAN—A ROUGH MARCH—THE TOWN\r\n     SURPRISED—DESPERATE DEFENCE—ALVARADO DETERMINES TO EXPLORE\r\n     STILL FARTHER SOUTH—CROSSING THE RIVER MICHATOYAT—THE\r\n     SPANIARDS COME TO ATIQUIPAC, TACUYLULA, TAXISCO,\r\n     NANCINTLAN, AND PAZACO—THE TOWNS DESERTED—POISONED\r\n     STAKES AND CANINE SACRIFICE—ENTER SALVADOR—MOQUIZALCO AND\r\n     ACATEPEC—BATTLES OF ACAJUTLA AND TACUXCALCO—BLOOD-THIRSTINESS\r\n     OF THIS CONQUEROR—ENTRY INTO CUZCATLAN—FLIGHT OF THE\r\n     INHABITANTS—RETURN TO PATINAMIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONQUEST OF ITZCUINTLAN.]\r\n\r\nWhile receiving at Patinamit, after the Zutugil campaign, the fealty\r\nof numerous chieftains of the southern coast provinces, Alvarado was\r\ntold that the district of Itzcuintlan[XXVI-1] defied him. And with\r\ntheir refusal to accept the benefits of Christian civilization certain\r\nirritating expressions of contempt were reported to have been uttered\r\nby the ruler of the province. Chiefs of other tribes who wished to\r\npass through it, in order to tender allegiance to the Spaniards,\r\nwere deterred and insulted, and the conqueror was challenged to\r\nenter the land.[XXVI-2] Somewhat ruffled by these bold proceedings,\r\nthe impetuous commander marched against Itzcuintlan with all his\r\navailable force, Spanish horse and foot, and a large body of Quichés\r\nand Cakchiquels.[XXVI-3] It was a very rough country through which he\r\nhad to pass. Roads there were none, other than mere tracks through\r\nthe thick woods, for intercourse with Itzcuintlan had been almost\r\nentirely closed, owing to incessant war; but these circumstances\r\nfavored a secret entrance into the hostile territory. For three days\r\nthey forced their way through an uninhabitable tract almost closed to\r\nman by tropical undergrowth, which required constant application of\r\naxe and knife, so that one day they were unable to proceed more than\r\ntwo leagues. On reaching the province it was found covered with thick\r\nplantations alternating with swamps. Such ground being no place for\r\nhorses, the arquebusiers took the front, and advanced upon the town from\r\nthree different quarters. It was raining heavily at the time, a shower\r\npreliminary to the season of rain, and the sentinels had retired, so\r\nthat the surprise was complete.[XXVI-4] Unable to arm or unite, the\r\ninhabitants fled to the woods to escape the swords of the conquerors.\r\nIn the fort, however, which commanded the town, a considerable body of\r\nwarriors had gathered, who offered a determined resistance, wounding\r\nmany Spaniards and causing great loss to the Indian auxiliaries. After\r\nfive hours of unavailing attempts to gain possession of the stronghold,\r\nthe enraged Alvarado set fire to the place. The brave defenders appear\r\nto have escaped, thanks to the heavy rain and the proximity of the\r\nsurrounding woods. Indeed, according to Alvarado's own statement, he\r\ndid no harm beyond burning the town.[XXVI-5] The subjection of the\r\ndistrict was not yet accomplished, however, and messengers were sent\r\nto the ruler with the usual summons and threats. If they persisted in\r\nkeeping aloof and refusing to submit, their lands and cornfields would\r\nbe devastated, and they and their children made slaves. This menace\r\nhad the desired effect; the cacique and his chiefs submitted and swore\r\nobedience, and during the eight days Alvarado remained in this place\r\na number of the surrounding towns sent in their allegiance. But the\r\nrestless spirit of both leader and men was not to be satisfied with\r\nthe subjugation of one province only. The lieutenant-general had heard\r\nexciting accounts of immense cities and wonderful palaces, and discovery\r\nwas almost as attractive to him as pacification. He had already informed\r\nCortés that it was his intention to winter fifty or one hundred leagues\r\nbeyond Guatemala. As an additional incentive he had received positive\r\ninformation that a march of twenty-five days from Guatemala would\r\nbring him to the end of the land: if that should prove to be the case\r\nhe was confident of finding soon the famous strait, for which so many\r\nwere searching.[XXVI-6] Besides the strait he desired also to find a\r\nharbor where he could construct vessels for exploring the coast at a\r\nlater date. Already a great soldier, he desired to become also a great\r\ndiscoverer. Even the rainy season, which has just set in, should not\r\ndeter him, though his difficulties would be greatly increased thereby.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOWNS TAKEN.]\r\n\r\nStarting southward, then, from Itzcuintlan, the first difficulty\r\nencountered by the army was the River Michatoyat,[XXVI-7] which could be\r\ncrossed only by bridging. The first town reached was Atiquipac,[XXVI-8]\r\nwhere the Spaniards were amicably received, but at sunset the people\r\nabandoned their homes and fled to the mountains.[XXVI-9] There was\r\nno time to be wasted with them, for the roads might at any time be\r\nrendered impassable by the rains, and so the army pushed forward after\r\nbranding a few unfortunates as slaves,[XXVI-10] the commander taking\r\nevery precaution in the disposition of his forces for the security of\r\nbaggage and the protection of the auxiliaries. The next town reached was\r\nTacuylula, standing to-day under the same name. The reception here was\r\nsimilar to the former, except, perhaps, that the natives detected the\r\nquality of their visitors more quickly than did the people of Atiquipac.\r\nWithin an hour they had all fled.[XXVI-11]\r\n\r\nFrom Tacuylula they advanced to Taxisco, where, according to Alvarado's\r\nreport, the inhabitants appeared friendly.[XXVI-12] They passed the\r\nnight in the town, with every precaution against attack, for it was\r\nstrong and populous, and the Spaniards were under no little apprehension\r\nof an assault. They were unmolested, however, and left on the following\r\nmorning for the town of Nancintlan.[XXVI-13] For better security the\r\ncommander placed ten horsemen in the rear and an equal number in the\r\ncentre with his baggage, while with the remainder of the cavalry he led\r\nthe van. He had advanced between two and three leagues when a fierce\r\nassault was made upon his rear, wherein a number of his Indian allies\r\nwere killed, and, what he deplored still more, a great quantity of his\r\nbaggage, stores, and material was carried off.[XXVI-14]\r\n\r\nThis was a grave loss, and the commander immediately sent his brother,\r\nJorge Alvarado, with forty or fifty of the cavalry to attempt a\r\nrecapture. On arriving at the scene of the late disaster this officer\r\nfell in with a large body of warriors[XXVI-15] and put them to flight,\r\nbut recovered none of the lost effects. In the mean time the army\r\narrived at Nancintlan, and Jorge Alvarado having returned with little\r\nor nothing accomplished, Puertocarrero[XXVI-16] was sent back with a\r\ndetachment of foot-soldiers. The second attempt was as unsuccessful\r\nas the first. The fact is, the country was all in arms; the natives\r\nhad retired to mountain fastnesses, whence they issued forth to attack\r\nas occasion offered. Nancintlan had also been abandoned, save by the\r\nprincipal men who were detained as prisoners. During the eight days'\r\nstay[XXVI-17] here, Alvarado sought in vain to induce the people to\r\nreturn, and, as he could delay his march no longer, out of pure spite\r\nthe dastardly commander burned the town and his prisoners.[XXVI-18]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards now advanced to the neighboring town of Pazaco.[XXVI-19]\r\nThe lieutenant-general had already received an invitation from the\r\nchiefs, with protestations of friendship, which could hardly have\r\nbeen sincere, for as the Spaniards approached the town their advance\r\nwas interrupted by short poisoned stakes, ingeniously hidden in the\r\nground.[XXVI-20] The roads, also, were found to be closed near the\r\ntown, with all possible impediments to an advance. As they entered the\r\nplace, the spectacle of a canine sacrifice, a ceremonial significant\r\nof hatred and defiance, met their gaze.[XXVI-21] Nor were hostilities\r\nlong delayed. At a signal the natives suddenly appeared, shouting their\r\nshrill war-cries, and threw upon the Spaniards so heavy a discharge of\r\narrows, lances, and stones, that it was with difficulty they held their\r\nground. Slowly but surely, however, Spanish weapons and coats of mail\r\nprevailed, and the Indians, unable to stand before them, fled to the\r\nsurrounding heights, amidst the attendant horrors of pursuit.[XXVI-22]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACROSS LA PAZA INTO SALVADOR.]\r\n\r\nThe army thereupon passed across the La Paz River[XXVI-23] into what\r\nis now the state of Salvador, first entering Moquizalco,[XXVI-24] and\r\nthen they went to Acatepec. Both of these towns received the strangers\r\nhospitably, but the inhabitants soon fled, overcome by terror at the\r\ncruelties committed. Angered by this continual desertion, Alvarado\r\nordered the Indians to be pursued, and as many of them as could be\r\nseized were branded as slaves. He then hastened forward, directing his\r\nmarch to Acajutla.[XXVI-25] On arriving within half a league of the\r\ntown he encountered a mighty host drawn up in battle array to oppose\r\nhim, their ranks extending over a wide plain that lay before the city.\r\nIt was indeed an inspiriting sight for an Indian fighter. Times had\r\nbeen somewhat tame for the last few days, but here was the promise\r\nof rare sport, indeed. Alvarado, who was in advance with the cavalry,\r\napproached to within a cross-bow shot, and then halted for his infantry\r\nto come up. As he ran his experienced eye over the forests of spears,\r\nand marked the magnitude of the hostile array, he felt that all his\r\ncoolness and all his skill would be required to save his army that day.\r\nWar plumes waved from the heads of thousands, and battle devices were\r\nscattered as far as the eye could reach, while the feathered banners\r\nfloating above the parti-colored bands threw over all an air of peculiar\r\nbrilliance.[XXVI-26] The foe had chosen, too, an advantageous position.\r\nIn their rear thick woods offered easy refuge in case of need. Yet\r\nalready, before they were his own, Alvarado began to plan that none\r\nshould escape him. He stood there like a hunter overlooking a band\r\nof antelope, and thinking how he could best secure them all. Of what\r\nadvantage was it to Charles, or Cortés, or even to these panting wolves\r\nthemselves, that this ill fated multitude to the last man should die?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOBLE GAME.]\r\n\r\nAs the remainder of his forces[XXVI-27] came up, Alvarado advanced a\r\nlittle nearer to the enemy. The Indians manifested no inclination to\r\nleave their position; they appeared to be awaiting attack. Alvarado\r\nthen feigned retreat, which the army performed in perfect order, though\r\nin apparent haste,[XXVI-28] the commander himself having charge of\r\nthe rear. The result was as he anticipated. The duped natives eagerly\r\npursued; at last, they thought, these beings maledict are afraid. And\r\nthey flew at them with wild demonstrations of joy at the expected\r\nvictory, making in their onset such a roar as would have appalled\r\nany but veteran troops. In their blind enthusiasm they grappled and\r\nstruggled with the retiring cavalry, seizing the horses' tails and the\r\nriders' stirrups. Their arrows rattled thick like hailstones against\r\nthe metal armor of the soldiers, or with angry hiss passed them by,\r\nreaching to the farthest end of the Spanish army. For some time this\r\nmovement continued over the level plain, on which no obstacle interposed\r\nto prevent its successful achievement.[XXVI-29] After thus drawing the\r\nenemy away from the friendly wood, and to such ground as best suited\r\nthe purpose, the order was given; the Spanish army wheeled and fell on\r\nthe unprepared foe like a storm of Sodom. Sennacherib's hosts before\r\nJerusalem met no more complete destruction than the army of warriors\r\nbefore Acajutla that day. Incased in cumbersome cotton armor, they\r\ncould not flee, and when overthrown by the charging horsemen they\r\ncould not rise again.[XXVI-30] As they lay helpless on the ground the\r\ninfantry and auxiliaries would cut and pierce them as if they had been\r\nswine, following as zealously as possible the example of Alvarado, who,\r\nseverely wounded[XXVI-31] and out of humor, vented his malignant spleen\r\nupon these home-defenders. Ah! war is a glorious thing; and grand that\r\ncivilization which refines and ennobles war!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER GREAT BATTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe revenge of the chivalrous commander was ample; not one of all that\r\nmultitude of warriors was left alive upon the field.[XXVI-32] When\r\nthe extermination was finished the victorious army entered Acajutla,\r\nand remained there five days caring for their wounded, of whom there\r\nwas a great number; then they passed on to Tacuxcalco.[XXVI-33] Pedro\r\nPuertocarrero had been sent forward to reconnoitre, and succeeded in\r\ncapturing two spies, who reported that the warriors of this town and its\r\ndependencies were assembled in large numbers to oppose their advance,\r\nwhereupon the scouting party proceeded until they arrived within sight\r\nof the enemy. Gonzalo de Alvarado, who led the van, his brother being\r\nill of his wound, presently came up with forty of the cavalry, and\r\ndrew up in order, waiting for the main body to arrive. The commander,\r\nthough still suffering severely, mounted a horse as best he could and\r\nissued his orders. The Indians were drawn up in one solid phalanx;\r\nhe would assail them on three sides at once. Thirty of the cavalry,\r\nunder the command of Gonzalo de Alvarado, were to attack the right, his\r\nbrother Gomez was ordered to lead twenty more against the left, while\r\nJorge[XXVI-34] was to charge the front with the rest of the forces.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements made, he took his post on elevated ground above\r\nthe battle field. Even his stout heart sank somewhat within him as he\r\nviewed the scene. One portion of the plain was covered with a forest\r\nof tall spears,[XXVI-35] and the compact body of foemen told him that\r\nthey were even more numerous than the army he had defeated a few days\r\nbefore.[XXVI-36] His apprehensions were in no wise lessened as he\r\nwatched his forces draw near the enemy and observed how immovable they\r\nstood, and without sign of fear. But what seemed to him most strange\r\nwas that his own men hesitated to charge. He afterward ascertained that\r\nbetween the opposing lines lay a narrow meadow which the Spaniards\r\nmistook for a swamp, and delayed their onset until they had assured\r\nthemselves of the firmness of the ground. Presently the stirring cry\r\nof Santiago! was heard, and Alvarado's heart swelled within him: his\r\npassion for human blood appears to increase with the slaughter of his\r\ntens of thousands, and the lately gay and gallant cavalier is becoming\r\na monster delighting in carnage and butchery, killing men for the mere\r\npleasure of it. With a feeling of fierce delight the wounded man now\r\nwatched his army break into the Indian columns. He marked the rout\r\nand bloody pursuit, and noticed with satisfaction how the plain became\r\nstreaked with dead bodies in the track of the fugitives and pursuers,\r\nwhich ghastly line was soon over a league in length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARCH ON CUZCATLAN.]\r\n\r\nTaking possession of the town, the Spaniards remained in it for\r\ntwo days, and then moved on to Mihuatlan.[XXVI-37] All the towns\r\nand villages hereabout were found deserted; the natives seemed to\r\nhave discovered that there was no chance of success in the field,\r\nand no escape from oppression when once their liberty was lost. At\r\nAtecuan[XXVI-38] the commander was met by envoys from Atlacatl, the\r\nking of Cuzcatlan, bearing proffers of friendship, which were received\r\nwith satisfaction, for the delay and fatigue of battle with the reward\r\nof empty towns, however pleasurable, seemed profitless.[XXVI-39]\r\nSo far, indeed, Alvarado seems to have effected little with respect\r\nto the actual conquest of the country. His line of march was marked\r\nby heaps of slain, by burned cities and deserted villages,[XXVI-40]\r\nbut as for native subjects of his Majesty, or Christian converts, or\r\ncolonies, or any permanent advantages, they were few. If, now in the\r\nvery heart of the country, he could gain a faithful ally, a second\r\nSinacam, pacification might become more permanent and profitable. To\r\nthis end he directed his march toward Cuzcatlan,[XXVI-41] the capital of\r\nthat country, a large and beautiful city, inhabited by a considerable\r\npopulation, and, according to the report of the conquerors, hardly\r\nsecond to Patinamit.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Indians along the road manifested their friendliness by\r\nsupplying the Spaniards with fruits and fresh provisions in abundance,\r\nand although they were cordially welcomed into the city by the chiefs,\r\nyet on taking up their quarters the whole population rushed to arms,\r\nand a few hours after the city was deserted.[XXVI-42] All efforts at\r\nreconciliation on the part of Alvarado were unavailing. Summons to\r\nobedience and menaces were equally disregarded, and a formal requirement\r\nwas sent, coupled with the usual conditions; but no reply came. Then\r\nthe invaders tried force, but for once they were baffled. For fully\r\nseventeen days the most strenuous exertions were made to subdue them,\r\nduring which time several sanguinary encounters occurred, wherein\r\na number of Spaniards were wounded and eleven horses killed, the\r\nauxiliaries suffering severely. Thus even the occupation of the capital\r\nfailed to secure the primary object of the invasion.\r\n\r\nAlvarado now perceived that with the present force he never would be\r\nable to subjugate these Cuzcatecs, and he saw that his position was\r\nbecoming critical. The rainy season was now well upon him, the roads\r\nwere becoming bad, and every day would render retreat more difficult.\r\nThe return march extended over several hundred miles, and he could\r\nnot expect to meet with much hospitality or assistance. He decided,\r\ntherefore, to return to Guatemala. But before he set out he would make\r\nlegally secure his claim upon the vassalage of the Cuzcatecs. With this\r\nview he instituted a process against them in the form prescribed by\r\nlaw, and summoned them to surrender. As no attention was paid to his\r\nproclamation, proceedings were closed after the legal time had expired\r\nand sentence was passed. They were pronounced traitors and their chiefs\r\ncondemned to death.[XXVI-43]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHRISTIANIZING AND BRANDING.]\r\n\r\nThis solemn ceremony ended,[XXVI-44] Alvarado was ready to depart from\r\nthe country, though not till he had branded all he could lay hands\r\nupon. He was somewhat chagrined at his failure to draw the Cuzcatecs\r\ninto the fold; but he would return again. Indeed, this was imperative,\r\nfor the Cuzcatlan campaign had been quite unproductive[XXVI-45] in\r\nsecuring either wealth or dominion. From Itzcuintlan to Cuzcatlan\r\nthere was scarcely a town that would not require a second subjugation.\r\nAn additional cause of vexation lay in the statement of natives that\r\nno strait existed toward the south.[XXVI-46] On the other hand he\r\nwas gratified to learn of great cities beyond, built of stone and\r\nlime, and inhabited by dense populations, and he promised himself due\r\ncompensation from them for his present disappointment. Of his homeward\r\nmarch particulars are unnecessary. That the way was difficult and that\r\nthe soldiers suffered much we may be sure.[XXVI-47] Pinched by hunger,\r\ndrenched by rain, midst the lightning and the thunder, they beat their\r\nway back over the soft soaked ground, braving the heavens and the earth\r\nwhich seemed to have risen against them. At night, if no deserted town\r\nafforded shelter, the worn-out men, after partaking of scanty fare and\r\nshivering in wet clothes round feeble camp fires, threw themselves upon\r\nthe swampy ground to sleep. Yet with all their sufferings they did not\r\nscruple to destroy fields, burn such villages as fell in their way, and\r\nso reduce others to the same sad plight as themselves. Sweet to us are\r\nthe misfortunes of others!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF THE CAKCHIQUELS.\r\n\r\n1524-1525.\r\n\r\n     RETURN OF THE ALLIES TO MEXICO—FOUNDING OF THE CITY OF\r\n     SANTIAGO—THE CAKCHIQUELS OPPRESSED BEYOND ENDURANCE—THEY\r\n     FLEE FROM THE CITY—DIFFICULTY IN AGAIN REDUCING THEM\r\n     TO SUBJECTION—REINFORCEMENTS FROM MEXICO—CAMPAIGN\r\n     AGAINST MIXCO—CAPTURE OF THAT STRONGHOLD—FIGHT WITH THE\r\n     CHIGNAUTECS—SUPERHUMAN VALOR OF A CAVALRYMAN—CONQUEST OF THE\r\n     ZACATEPEC VALLEY—EXPEDITION AGAINST THE MAMES—DEFEAT OF CAN\r\n     ILOCAB—ENTRY INTO HUEHUETENANGO—SIEGE OF ZAKULÉU—SURRENDER OF\r\n     CAIBIL BALAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nPedro de Alvarado with his army arrived at Patinamit from his southern\r\ncampaign some days previous to the 28th of July, 1524.[XXVII-1] The\r\nMexican allies were soon dismissed and returned to their homes, bearing\r\ndespatches to Cortés. The general was greatly pleased with the tidings\r\nfrom his lieutenant, and sent him two hundred more Spanish soldiers, to\r\naid in the colonization of those parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOUNDING OF THE CITY OF SANTIAGO.]\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after their return to the capital of the Cakchiquels\r\nthe Spaniards proceeded to appropriate the territory and make\r\npreparations for its government. A Spanish city was founded at Patinamit\r\nunder the name of Ciudad del Señor de Santiago.[XXVII-2]\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies were conducted with great pomp. According to Remesal, on\r\nthe 25th of July, St James' day, the army was drawn up in battle-array\r\nto the sound of fife and drum. The morning was unusually fine, and the\r\nsun flashing its rays upon burnished armor added splendor to the scene.\r\nThe cavalry were specially conspicuous for the brilliancy of their\r\ndress and ornaments. After repeated volleys by the arquebusiers mass\r\nwas celebrated by Juan Godinez, the chaplain, and all joined devoutly\r\nin the service. With due ceremony the new town was dedicated to their\r\npatron Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe municipal officers were then appointed by Alvarado. The first\r\nalcaldes were Diego de Rojas and Baltasar de Mendoza. Four regidores\r\nwere nominated, whose names were Pedro Puertocarrero, Hernan Carrillo,\r\nJuan Perez Dardon, and Domingo de Zubiarreta,[XXVII-3] while Gonzalo de\r\nAlvarado was elected alguacil mayor.[XXVII-4]\r\n\r\nThe municipality having thus been formed,[XXVII-5] the Spaniards for the\r\nnext three days devoted themselves to festivities and rejoicing. On the\r\n12th of August[XXVII-6] there was an enrolment of colonists, of whom a\r\nlist of one hundred has been preserved.[XXVII-7] To the sacred patron\r\nwas also built and dedicated a church, of which Juan Godinez was left in\r\ncharge, and one Reynosa sacristan with a salary of sixty dollars a year.\r\nThe surrounding lands were then distributed in encomiendas. In making\r\nthese grants Alvarado must have entertained some misgivings as to their\r\nvalidity and as to his future position and authority in the conquered\r\nprovinces, for in a despatch to Cortés he complains that according\r\nto reports meeting him on his return from the southern campaign the\r\nking had appointed a governor other than himself of the new territory,\r\nand upbraids Cortés for not having duly reported his services to his\r\nMajesty, at the same time begging him to do so.[XXVII-8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OUTRAGE UPON OUTRAGE.]\r\n\r\nThat the Cakchiquel nobles should regard with indignation this arbitrary\r\ndisposal of their lands and vassals was but natural. They had already\r\nobserved that friend and foe were much the same in the hands of\r\nthe voracious Spaniards, whose aggressive and outrageous action now\r\nconvinced them that the friendly bearing of their king had gained for\r\ntheir nation no more, nay less, consideration than that vouchsafed\r\nthe conquered Quichés, who had fought manfully for independence. So\r\nit was, in truth, with regard to all the conquerors in America, though\r\nnot so expressed in words: those who fought for their rights must die\r\nor suffer enslavement because they offered opposition to the spoilers;\r\nthose who did not fight were contemptible things, unworthy a white\r\nman's consideration. Believing in their promises, the Cakchiquels\r\nhad received the Spaniards and had accepted their sovereign; but they\r\nwere not prepared to go so far as to surrender themselves, their wives\r\nand little ones, their lands and their religion. Death might be the\r\nresult of revolt; judging from what they had seen it probably would be;\r\nnevertheless they would revolt and die. How high the high hand of the\r\ntaskmasters had been raised we know not; but we know that within a few\r\nshort months after Alvarado's return and the founding of his unstable\r\ncity[XXVII-9] the Cakchiquels rose to a man against the tyrants. The\r\ncrowning grievance also is known. Exaction after exaction had been made.\r\nThe temples and palaces of Patinamit had been forced to contribute their\r\ngold and silver ornaments until there was nothing left. Then a large\r\namount of gold[XXVII-10] was demanded of the king and nobles within a\r\nstated time, which it was out of their power to supply. In their efforts\r\nto obtain the so much desired yellow substance from auriferous streams\r\nthey brought in glittering pyrites, mistaking them for gold.[XXVII-11]\r\nAlvarado, furious with rage, summoned the king and his courtiers before\r\nhim. \"Why,\" he passionately exclaimed, \"have you not brought the gold\r\nand silver that I demanded of you? If I receive not soon all the gold\r\nand all the silver of your towns, you shall have the choice of being\r\nhanged or burned alive!\" Then with a brutality that Caligula might have\r\ngloried in he tore with his own hand from the nostrils of Sinacam and\r\ntwo princes at his side the golden ornaments they wore as badges of\r\ntheir high rank.[XXVII-12] This indignity cut the unhappy natives to\r\nthe heart, and bending their disgraced heads, bitter tears mingled with\r\nthe blood which fell at the feet of the Christian. \"It is my will,\"\r\nadded Alvarado, \"that the gold and silver be here within five days. Woe\r\nbetide you if you bring it not!\" and with a coarseness that equalled\r\nhis heartlessness he dismissed them from his presence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABANDONMENT OF THE CITY.]\r\n\r\nNobles, priesthood, and people were already of one mind. The priests in\r\nparticular, seeing the desecration of their temples and the threatened\r\nsuppression of their religion, put forth all their efforts to rouse the\r\nCakchiquels from the vile thraldom. And while the nobles and people\r\nproceeded as best they were able to collect treasures to meet the\r\nlast demand from the neighboring towns, the priesthood succeeded in\r\ncompleting plans and preparations for revolt. They spread the report\r\nthat their deity, offended at the sacrilegious actions of the Spaniards,\r\nhad appeared to his ministers, announcing the speedy destruction of the\r\nstrangers. A priest of Chamalcan now presented himself before Sinacam\r\nand his court. \"I am the lightning!\" he cried, with subdued vehemence,\r\n\"and I will strike the Castilians. With fire will I destroy them! When\r\nI shall cause the sound of the sacred drum to be heard in the city,\r\nlet the king leave it and withdraw to the other side of the river, for\r\non the seventh day, Ahmak, will I strike the Spaniards!\" These bold\r\nand confident words had their effect. In their deep affliction the\r\nCakchiquels believed their god would help them, else of what value were\r\ngods? and they secretly made all ready for the time the signal should\r\nbe given. The Spaniards do not seem to have had any suspicion of the\r\nintentions of the Cakchiquels. On the very evening of the uprising\r\nAlvarado, pacified with the gold that had been brought him, entertained\r\nSinacam and a large number of princes and nobles at a banquet, a\r\nsplendid banquet, whereat the guests feasted on their own of which they\r\nhad been despoiled. That night, while the Spaniards were asleep, heavy\r\nafter their revelry, the signal drum was sounded. The whole population,\r\nmen, women, and children, arose and silently withdrew with their king\r\nand nobles from the city. It is not the only time in the world's history\r\nthat a people have abandoned home and fled from persecution, trusting\r\nin religious faith. Now may the god in whom they trust help them, for\r\nall other hope they have left behind! Crossing the ravine they turned\r\nand awaited the expected miracle; all through the remainder of the\r\nnight they watched for the lightning and the fire, straining their eyes\r\nafar, to the remotest corners of the heavens, to catch the first faint\r\ngleam of that sacred flame which should bring them deliverance. But\r\nalas! there was no light save that of the morning sun, which came to\r\ndispel all hope. God and priest alike had deceived them; or rather they\r\nthemselves were deceived, had not understood aright, or were not worthy\r\nof aid, or their desire would come in some other way—so their teacher\r\nmight have said. Now it remained only for them to perish, for they would\r\nreturn, never![XXVII-13]\r\n\r\nAlvarado well knew the meaning of this action when he heard of it. And\r\nas he walked through the city, the empty houses and deserted streets\r\ntold him plainly enough that his atrocious system of oppression had\r\ndriven to despair a nation that had welcomed him with all kindness and\r\nhospitality. The immediate cause and incentive to revolt, the action of\r\nthe priest, being explained to him, he hoped when the Cakchiquels had\r\ndiscovered how vain was the hope in their god that they would return\r\nto their homes again, and for ten days he remained inactive. But all\r\nattempts at reconciliation were repelled; they would rather die at war\r\nwith the Christians than live at peace with them. Ah well! then they\r\nmust be slain; and as a religious and patriotic duty Alvarado took the\r\nfield against them. It was a long and bloody war that followed. If the\r\nQuichés and Zutugils had confederated with the Cakchiquels, it is safe\r\nto surmise the Spaniards would have been repelled. With a scarcity of\r\nprovisions,[XXVII-14] and a reduced number of Mexican auxiliaries,\r\nhemmed in and harassed, it is hardly possible that they could have\r\nfought their way out of the country. But the rejection by Sinacam of the\r\nearlier proposals of the Quichés, and his alliance with the invaders,\r\nstill rankled in their breasts, and they now cared little which of\r\ntheir detested foes ate the other. As it was, the war proved not the\r\none-sided affair of late so common. The Cakchiquels displayed a skill\r\nand bravery in battle such as the Spaniards had not experienced in\r\nthese parts. In front of their lines they dug deep holes in which they\r\nplanted pointed stakes, and concealing them with coverings of grass and\r\nlight earth, received behind them the charging cavalry. Many a Spaniard\r\nand many a horse found death or frightful wounds, impaled in these\r\npitfalls.[XXVII-15]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HATRED OF THE CAKCHIQUELS.]\r\n\r\nOn the battle-field the natives displayed a desperate courage. With\r\ntheir deep hatred they would if possible envenom their arrows and darts,\r\nand as they hurled them on the foe they shouted, \"Take gold, Tonatiuh,\r\ntake gold!\" Thus the contest was carried on with great animosity on both\r\nsides, and the Cakchiquels, now more united among themselves, and joined\r\nby many neighboring tribes, long maintained the struggle. Though their\r\nown land suffered from the ravages of the Spaniards, they had their\r\nrevenge in devastating the territories of the Quichés and Zutugils; for\r\nthese nations had been so weakened in their contests with the Spaniards\r\nthat they could no longer meet the Cakchiquels in the field. And,\r\nindeed, under this widely extended process of devastation the Spaniards\r\nbegan to suffer hunger. Alvarado was obliged to abandon his new city at\r\nPatinamit during the latter part of this year, 1524, and to make his\r\nhead-quarters for a time at Xepau,[XXVII-16] round which the country\r\nwas less desolate.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were indeed sorely pressed, and many Christians were\r\nkilled and wounded. But about the beginning of 1525 he received\r\nreinforcements from Mexico which enabled him to proceed rapidly with\r\nthe reduction of the revolted provinces. Returning to Patinamit, he\r\nsubjected the several districts one after another to fire and sword,\r\ntill the land was one wide scene of desolation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAMPAIGN AGAINST MIXCO.]\r\n\r\nIt was during, or immediately after, the suppression of this revolt that\r\nthe Spaniards accomplished perhaps their greatest achievement during\r\nthe whole Guatemalan conquest. This was the storming of the city of\r\nMixco, deemed impregnable.[XXVII-17] Mixco was one of the most important\r\nstrongholds in the Cakchiquel kingdom, being so fortified by nature as\r\nto require little from art. Situated on an eminence surrounded on all\r\nsides by precipices, it was accessible only by a steep path, wide enough\r\nfor but a single person, and interrupted here and there by places which\r\ncould only with difficulty be climbed.[XXVII-18] On the top of this\r\neminence was a great plain, capable of supporting a population of eight\r\nor nine thousand.\r\n\r\nLearning that the Mixcans had determined to resist Spanish rule,\r\nand were encouraging other tribes to fortify themselves in similar\r\nimpregnable positions, Alvarado regarded the reduction of the place\r\nas an absolute necessity. He therefore sent an advance force of two\r\ncompanies of foot-soldiers and one of cavalry, under the command of\r\nhis brother Gonzalo, to invest Mixco until he should be able to assume\r\ncommand in person. The captains commanding under Gonzalo, Alonso de\r\nOjeda, Luis de Vivar, and Hernando de Chaves, were men of high courage\r\nand experience; yet they not only accomplished nothing, but suffered\r\nso much from the stones and arrows of the enemy,[XXVII-19] provisions\r\nlikewise beginning to fail, that Gonzalo was about to raise the siege\r\nwhen the lieutenant-general arrived with reinforcements.[XXVII-20]\r\nAlthough fully recognizing the difficulty and danger of the undertaking\r\nthere were two incentives which urged Alvarado forward to its\r\nachievement: he loved what was difficult and dangerous, and he well knew\r\nthat there could be no permanent subjugation of the country with this\r\nstronghold in the hands of the enemy. A council of war was held and\r\nthe capture of Mixco resolved on. The first attempt was unsuccessful,\r\nas were indeed the second and third, until days and weeks went by\r\nwithout any seeming progress. Then the Spaniards tried stratagem, and\r\nwhile feigning an assault by means of scaling-ladders at a place where\r\nthe precipice was lower than elsewhere, they suddenly made a rush up\r\nthe pathway, which they hoped to find undefended. The Mixcans were\r\nprepared, however, and received the Spaniards with such heavy discharges\r\nof missiles that they were forced to retire in confusion. While the\r\nofficers were in consultation shortly after, a strong body of native\r\nwarriors was reported near at hand, which proved to be Chignautecs,\r\nallies of the Mixcans.[XXVII-21] Their intentions were evident, and soon\r\nthe two armies were engaged in hot contest. Notwithstanding that great\r\nhavoc was made by the arquebuses and cross-bows, and still more by the\r\ncavalry, the Chignautecs maintained the fight with such stubbornness\r\nthat after the loss of a large number of Tlascaltecs and the wounding\r\nof many Spaniards a retrograde movement was decided on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIGHT WITH THE CHIGNAUTECS.]\r\n\r\nUpon an occasion like the present, where the object to be gained, the\r\ntaking of a stronghold, partook more of the nature of single combat than\r\nof general battle, here and elsewhere upon a campaign of this kind, it\r\nwas not uncommon to see feats of individual prowess cropping out on both\r\nsides. It was the field of glory to the soldier, limited usually to the\r\nfield, as the world was the general's field of glory. I will mention one\r\nsuch exhibition in connection with this fight against the Chignautecs.\r\nIn the hazardous retreat one of the cavalrymen, García de Aguilar, is\r\nin the extreme rear, subject to the fiercest assaults of the pursuing\r\nwarriors. In truth, his body is interposed between the two contending\r\narmies. Obviously, if the enemy cannot put him out of the way they are\r\nunable to harm the others; every effort is therefore made to maim his\r\nhorse, or otherwise to capture him; and he is at length cut off from\r\nhis comrades and quickly surrounded by over four hundred of the dusky\r\nfoe, each eager to inflict the _coup de grace_. But Aguilar is by no\r\nmeans vanquished yet. Though presently unseated, he maintains for some\r\ntime a desperate struggle, striking with deadly effect upon the enemy.\r\nThen he loses his sword, and nothing remains to him but a dagger. It is\r\nnot in this instance the bravery of the man that astonishes so much as\r\nhis extraordinary muscular power. The horse, by kicking and plunging,\r\nprevents capture, while Aguilar, circumscribed by threatening death,\r\nexhibits almost superhuman strength. No blow dealt to kill or stun, no\r\nattempt to seize him, can stop the quick stroke of that strong right\r\narm as it drives the keen steel straight into the assailants' vitals.\r\nWith wounds and ever increasing exertion, however, he grows weaker;\r\nbut capture signifies immolation. To be gazed at, helpless on a heathen\r\naltar, an offering to odious gods—the thought is horrible—and the fatal\r\ndagger is still, by swift movements, driven to the hilt. And now the\r\nbattle cry of Santiago to the rescue! rings in his ears and tells of\r\nsuccor; he hears a leaden sound, as of crushed bone and flesh, and\r\nthe whistle of descending blades, and knows that help is at hand. Six\r\nhorsemen have plunged into the unequal contest, and they scatter the\r\nswarthy foe like sheep. They gather round their countryman, support\r\nhis exhausted frame, and carry him wounded and faint to a place of\r\nsafety. The courage, strength, and skill of this single man, and the\r\nvalor displayed in his rescue, so impressed the Chignautecs that they\r\nretired disheartened, regarding their efforts of no avail against such\r\nbeings,[XXVII-22] and they returned to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe siege had now lasted a month. On the third day after the retrograde\r\nmovement, which resulted in victory, the Spaniards determined to make\r\nanother attempt upon the place, and were on the point of assault when\r\nan ambassador arrived from the Chignautecs tendering their submission,\r\nand bringing the customary presents of gold, green plumes, and costly\r\nmantles. It was, however, stipulated on their part that this act of\r\nallegiance should be kept secret until the fall of Mixco; at the same\r\ntime the envoy intimated that their caciques would communicate privately\r\nto Alvarado a secret that would be of service to him. Alvarado received\r\nthis message favorably, and sent back the emissary with every mark of\r\nconsideration, expressing his willingness to hear what the chiefs had\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Mixco to Chignauta was nine leagues; and in three\r\ndays, during which Alvarado had refrained from active operations, the\r\nprincipal caciques arrived at his camp. They were attended by a large\r\nretinue and a number of natives bearing presents of great aboriginal\r\nvalue and a large quantity of provisions. The disclosure made by the\r\ncaciques was to the effect that there existed a subterranean passage\r\nfrom the stronghold, having an outlet in the woods near the river bank.\r\nBy this the Mixcans could escape, they said, even if the Spaniards\r\nsucceeded in storming the height. The outlet they were willing to\r\ndisclose, as they owed no allegiance to the Mixcans, who had incited\r\nthem to take up arms against the Spaniards. They moreover suggested that\r\nan ambuscade should be placed near the mouth.[XXVII-23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FALL OF MIXCO.]\r\n\r\nA force of forty men, cross-bowmen and cavalry, commanded by Alonso\r\nLopez de Loarca, was accordingly despatched to the exit of the\r\npassage,[XXVII-24] and thereupon Alvarado determined once more to\r\nattempt to storm the place. The front man of the storming line bore a\r\nshield, and behind him followed a cross-bowman; then succeeded another\r\nshield-bearer, supported by an arquebusier. This alternate order\r\nafforded protection and at the same time admitted of assault.[XXVII-25]\r\nThe file thus formed was led by Bernardino de Arteaga, who had asked\r\nfor the dangerous post as a favor, and succeeded in covering his name\r\nwith honor. Calling on God and Santiago, they began the ascent of the\r\nnarrow ridge, which widened as it joined the cliff. While moving as\r\nrapidly as possible, so that the showering stones and arrows might\r\nhave less effect, they nevertheless plied cross-bow and arquebuse with\r\ndeadly effect. They had almost reached a wider place in the ridge, where\r\nfour men might walk abreast, when the gallant Arteaga was felled with a\r\nheavy stone, breaking his leg, but with indomitable will he struggled\r\non, supported by his comrade Diego Lopez de Villanueva.[XXVII-26]\r\nDespite the terrible resistance they reached the broader space near\r\nthe cliff, which was packed with defenders so eager for a blow at the\r\nassailants that many were crowded off the precipice by those behind. But\r\nthe stormers were by this time enabled to fall partially into line and\r\nply their blades. A hand-to-hand contest followed, and the ground soon\r\nbecame thickly strewn with the bodies of slain Mixcans, among which were\r\nheaps of lopped-off heads and limbs. More Spaniards and auxiliaries came\r\nrapidly forward to aid in the slaughter as ground could be cleared for\r\nthem to stand on. The natives fought with desperation, but height after\r\nheight was lost to them, until their victorious foe gained at last the\r\nplain above. There the Spaniards found fresh forces to oppose them. But\r\nthe Mixcans were by this time overawed by the extraordinary achievement\r\nof the Spaniards; and as they marked these merciless white foemen, the\r\nfirst who had ever planted foot within the precincts of their famed\r\nand formidable stronghold, as they saw them moving onward and upward,\r\ninvincible as fate, it is no wonder that their hearts sank with despair.\r\nTheir opposition was wholly spiritless; they broke and fled at the first\r\ncharge. What followed was frightful, surpassing even the terrible scenes\r\nto which these man-killers on both sides were accustomed. To escape the\r\nfierce onslaught of the Spaniards some of the Mixcans plunged headlong\r\ndown the cliffs, the dull thud of their bodies, as they struck upon\r\nthe rocks, sounding ghostly echoes in the ravine below. Some attempted\r\nescape by the now deserted path by which the assailants had come, but\r\nthese were captured by the camp guard. Some fled by the subterranean\r\ncaverns, but were pursued and many taken prisoners before they reached\r\nthe outlet, while those who had previously withdrawn thither with the\r\nwomen and children, under the care of several caciques, on emerging at\r\nthe outlet were assailed by Loarca, and most of them captured.[XXVII-27]\r\n\r\nThus terminated this remarkable exploit of the conquerors. The city\r\nwas burned, the stronghold destroyed, and the population removed to the\r\nsite of the present town of the same name, situated in the Valle de las\r\nVacas.[XXVII-28]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ZACATEPEC WAR.]\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the fall of Mixco that the conquest of the\r\nZacatepec Valley was accomplished. The towns of this district\r\nwere subject to the king of the Cakchiquels, but many of them,\r\nespecially Zacatepec, had thrown off their allegiance and declared\r\nthemselves independent, indignant at Sinacam's alliance with the\r\nSpaniards.[XXVII-29] They had, moreover, repeatedly shown their\r\nhostility to those towns which had submitted to Spanish rule, by making\r\nincursions into their lands, and carrying off their women and children\r\nto the sacrifice.[XXVII-30]\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the revolt and the re-establishment of Spanish\r\npower in the Patinamit district,[XXVII-31] the caciques of Xinaco and\r\nZumpango remonstrated with the Zacatepecs, saying that they were now\r\nunder the protection of the children of the sun, and should appeal to\r\nthem if the depredations on their lands did not cease. The unfortunate\r\nmen who carried this message were summarily sacrificed on the altar\r\nstone, all save one, whose life was spared that he might carry back\r\nthe reply of the Zacatepecs: \"Let the children of the sun bring to\r\nlife again the dead envoys. As for ourselves, we will not submit to an\r\nunknown people, but will destroy all the villages of the caciques before\r\ntheir allies can render assistance.\" Nor were they slow to carry out\r\ntheir threat.\r\n\r\nA large force invaded the territory of Xinaco and Zumpango, and\r\nbegan to slay and lay waste. The natives sent to Guatemala to implore\r\nassistance. Alvarado was at this time absent on his second campaign\r\nto Salvador,[XXVII-32] carrying out his former intention to return\r\nand bring the stubborn natives to a recognition of Spaniards' rights.\r\nNevertheless, one thousand Cakchiquels and ten arquebusiers, under\r\nthe command of Antonio de Salazar, a most competent captain, were at\r\nonce despatched to the scene of action, while Alvarado was advised of\r\nwhat had occurred. Hostilities had already begun before these troops\r\narrived. For three days the Zacatepecs maintained the conflict with\r\ngreat bravery, though with considerable loss. But now the Spaniards\r\nreceived a reinforcement of ten arquebusiers, twenty horsemen, and two\r\nhundred Tlascaltecs and Mexicans, commanded by Pedro Gonzalez Nájera.\r\nThe contest thereafter was not so evenly balanced, and the Zacatepecs\r\nsustained several defeats. On the fifth day, however, they adopted\r\nthe plan of attacking in columns one thousand strong, successively\r\nrelieving each other, so that fresh men continually kept up the battle,\r\neach column when relieved retiring to the rear.[XXVII-33] These tactics\r\nenabled them to maintain the fight during the whole of that day, and\r\nthey inflicted no little loss on the Spanish forces. Early in the\r\nmorning the Spaniards took the field, apparently in disorder and much\r\nreduced in numbers. Encouraged by the success of their new manœuvres,\r\nthe Zacatepecs attacked with contemptuous confidence. The Spaniards gave\r\nway and retreated toward a thickly wooded ravine. The Zacatepecs now\r\nfelt sure of victory, and in their impetuous pursuit allowed themselves\r\nto be drawn into the defile, where a large body of their enemies were\r\nlying in ambush. Suddenly assailed on both sides, their disorderly ranks\r\nwere routed with great slaughter. Numbers were also taken prisoners,\r\namong whom were many caciques. This battle terminated the war. The\r\nwhole Zacatepec valley submitted to the authority of the Spaniards;\r\nand in order to insure future obedience a garrison of ten Spaniards\r\nand one hundred and forty Tlascaltecs was stationed at Zacatepec,\r\nunder the command of Diego de Alvarado, the caciques being detained as\r\nhostages.[XXVII-34]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONQUEST OF THE MAMES.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the year 1525 Sequechul, king of Utatlan,\r\nrepresented to Alvarado that his father Oxib Quieh had not been so\r\nguilty as he had supposed of the treacherous plot to destroy the\r\nSpaniards the year previous, but that Caibil Balam,[XXVII-35] king\r\nof the Mames,[XXVII-36] was more to blame, as the instigator of the\r\nattempt. At the same time he offered to provide the invading forces\r\nwith guides if Alvarado would undertake the conquest of that kingdom\r\nand punish Caibil Balam. Whether Sequechul's object was revenge for his\r\nfather's cruel death or favor with Alvarado is of little consequence;\r\nthe mention he made of the broad lands and great wealth of the province\r\nfell pleasantly on the lieutenant-general's ear, and he willingly\r\nacceded to the king's proposal.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was placed under the command of Gonzalo de Alvarado, and\r\nconsisted of eighty Spanish infantry, the captains being Antonio de\r\nSalazar and Francisco de Arévalo, together with forty cavalrymen and\r\ntwo thousand native auxiliaries, drawn from various districts, whose\r\ncommanders were Jorge de Acuña, Pedro de Aragon, Bernardino de Oviedo,\r\nand Juan de Verastigui. These forces were, moreover, accompanied by\r\nthree hundred pioneers, with axes and picks, while a large number of\r\nIndian carriers bore with them an ample supply of provisions besides the\r\nbaggage. Early in July the army marched to Totonicapan, a town on the\r\nconfines of the Mame territory, which was made the base of operations.\r\nThe usual difficulties of such undertakings here began. It took the\r\ninvaders no less than eight days to cross the mountain range between\r\nthat place and the Rio Hondo. The season rendered their labors the\r\ngreater, for the rain, day after day, poured down in torrents. Up steep\r\nascents, down dangerous gullies, they toiled, now winding in single\r\nfile along the edge of a precipice, now plunging over soft treacherous\r\nground up to the knee in mud. On reaching the Hondo[XXVII-37] they\r\nbivouacked for two days in the dripping sunless woods on the bank of the\r\nriver, which, swollen by the ceaseless rains, for a time defied their\r\npassage. At length they succeeded in crossing, and presently emerged\r\nfrom the forests upon an open plain, and descried on an eminence the\r\nMame town of Mazatenango. It was a well fortified place, surrounded by\r\na barricade of heavy timber, behind which, on a terre-plein of mud and\r\nstraw, a great multitude of warriors were drawn up. A wide stretch of\r\nswampy ground, not differing in appearance from the rest of the plain,\r\ndebarred approach to this side of the town. As the invading army drew\r\nnear, the Mames with hisses and shouts of defiance challenged attack,\r\nin the hope of inducing them to charge into the swamp. Gonzalo de\r\nAlvarado was, however, timely advised of the danger by his guides, and\r\nmaking a detour he assaulted the barricade on the other side, where\r\nthe ground was firm. The assailants were received with a blinding storm\r\nof missiles, which for a long time kept them in check. Their repeated\r\nefforts to burst through the defences were baffled, and the auxiliaries\r\nwere becoming discouraged, when Gomez de Loarca with the cavalry plunged\r\nthrough the palisade. The besiegers, pouring in through the breach,\r\ncould now fight after their own fashion; and though the Mames offered a\r\nbrave resistance, they were routed with great slaughter, and their town\r\ntaken possession of by the conquerors, who placed in it a sufficient\r\ngarrison as a protection in their rear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRINCE CAN ILOCAB.]\r\n\r\nContinuing their march, they encounter at no great distance from\r\nMazatenango an army of five thousand warriors from Malacatan, whereupon\r\nGonzalo takes up a favorable position on the plain.[XXVII-38] The\r\nvanguard of the enemy is composed of slingers and archers, and the\r\nmain body of spearmen, commanded by the renowned prince Can Ilocab.\r\nIn perfect order, and with deafening sound of drums and conchs, they\r\napproach the Spanish army. As soon as the vanguard has reached a\r\nsuitable point Gonzalo charges upon them with the cavalry. The arrows\r\nstrike thick as hail on the mailed breasts of the horsemen, drawing fire\r\ntherefrom; but the chargers dash through the ranks of the archers, who\r\nwith stubborn courage disdain to fly, while to avoid the fatal lance\r\nthrusts they throw themselves under the horses, only to be crushed\r\nand mangled by the iron-shod hoofs. And now the main body of the Mames\r\ncome up, and the Spanish cavalry have more difficult work. The charge\r\nagainst those solid columns bristling with long spears is only partially\r\nsuccessful. The shock is sustained by the Mames with a firmness the\r\nSpaniards are little accustomed to. The discomfited vanguard has time\r\nto rally, and again the swift stone bruises, and arrows hiss and shiver\r\non helmet and coat of mail. All the forces on both sides are now in\r\naction, and the slaughter of the Mames is dreadful, yet not one inch\r\nwill they yield. Rushing to close quarters, within their opponents'\r\nbreastwork of sword-points, and gliding along their lances, they so\r\nhamper the Spaniards that they can hardly wield their arms. Bruised and\r\nstunned, embarrassed in their movements, the blows of the Spaniards\r\nfall more feebly, and they already begin to relax their efforts when\r\nSalazar, one of the captains of infantry, seeing the imminent danger,\r\nstrives to rouse his men with spirit-stirring words. \"Where is your\r\nvalor, Castilians?\" he cries. \"Does that courage sink which won the\r\nblood-stained fields of Mexico and Utatlan? There you achieved renown;\r\nlose it not here, nor suffer yourselves to be carried off to die on\r\nthe altars of these idolaters!\" The appeal has its effect. With renewed\r\nefforts the infantry mow their way through and through the Mame columns,\r\ncausing frightful carnage, but the warriors recede not one foot in\r\nflight. For still waves in air their prince's banner; his plume nods\r\nhigh above them all, and his voice still cheers them on. As long as he\r\nremains they will fight, knowing no defeat. The Spanish captain is not\r\nblind to this, for under the great Cortés he has learned that in their\r\nleader lies the strength of the warriors, and he recognizes only too\r\nclearly that Can Ilocab's death is their one chance of victory. For some\r\ntime the execution of Gonzalo's purpose has been delayed, but at length\r\nby the surging ranks he is thrown near to the magic banner, and then\r\nwith desperate charge he urges his steed through the resisting guard\r\nup to the Mame chieftain, and plunges the lance through his body. This\r\nends the battle, and the Mames, unconquered by sword and lance, on the\r\nfall of their prince flee from the field and are pursued as far as their\r\ntown. The chiefs of the place at once send an embassy to sue for peace,\r\nbringing with them a present of gold ornaments, and offering allegiance,\r\nwhich is accepted. Leaving a garrison in the town, the Spaniards\r\ncontinue their march in the direction of Huehuetenango.[XXVII-39]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ZAKULÉU INVESTED.]\r\n\r\nThis was an important city of the Mames, where Gonzalo de Alvarado\r\nexpected warm work, judging from the late formidable resistance. On\r\narrival, however, he found the place abandoned, and such of the houses\r\nas had not been destroyed stripped of furniture and utensils, without\r\na handful of provisions. Cavalry troops were sent out in different\r\ndirections, and one under the command of Gaspar Aleman fell in with\r\nthree hundred Indian archers, who without hesitation attacked the\r\nhorsemen, among others wounding Aleman in the face. But they were\r\nsoon routed, and in the pursuit three prisoners were taken, one of\r\nwhom was a chief named Sahquiab, a captain in Caibil Balam's army.\r\nWhen brought into the presence of Gonzalo de Alvarado, he informed\r\nhim that his sovereign had retired to the almost impregnable city\r\nof Zakuléu,[XXVII-40] where, provided with provisions and stores, he\r\ndeemed himself secure. The captive was thereupon sent by Gonzalo to\r\nCaibil Balam with offers of peace and a charitable proposal to teach him\r\nthe doctrines of the Christian religion. But Sahquiab did not return,\r\nnor came any answer to Gonzalo. A second embassy, composed of Indians\r\nfrom Utatlan, was rudely refused audience with a shower of arrows.\r\nThis exhausted the patience of Gonzalo and he marched on Zakuléu. As\r\nsoon as his approach was observed by the Mames an army six thousand\r\nstrong sallied forth to give him battle. The engagement which followed\r\nwas maintained by the Mames with the same stubborn valor exhibited\r\nin previous fights, and marked by similar carnage. A reserve of two\r\nthousand, which sallied during the battle from Zakuléu to the support\r\nof their countrymen, made an ineffectual attempt to turn the tide of\r\nvictory, only adding to the victims; and routed in all directions the\r\nMames fled to their stronghold in the mountains.[XXVII-41]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PREPARING TO STORM ZAKULÉU.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the impossibility of storming so impregnable a place as\r\nZakuléu, Gonzalo closely invested it by stationing troops at the\r\nfew points where egress seemed possible. On the third day of the\r\nsiege Diego Lopez de Villanueva, while reconnoitring with a body of\r\ncavalry, observed smoke issuing from the woods on the other side of\r\nthe river.[XXVII-42] Having crossed with much difficulty, he fell in\r\nwith three hundred Indians in charge of a large supply of provisions,\r\nwhich they intended to introduce into the beleaguered city, and which\r\nVillanueva promptly appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe inactive warfare soon wore out the patience of the Spaniards, and\r\nGonzalo began to cut a road suitable for cavalry up the most practicable\r\npart of the steep. Day by day, from morning to night, the sound of the\r\npick was heard, and the work continued uninterrupted with but little\r\nloss to the besiegers, though the heights were thronged with Mames, who\r\nused every effort to impede its progress. The cross-bow and arquebuse\r\nwere far more deadly than the sling and arm-drawn bow, and the Mames\r\nsuffered heavily.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these operations an army of eight thousand mountaineers\r\nappeared on the plain, presenting a most unusual spectacle—naked, and\r\nhideous with war-paint, unrelieved by plume or ornament of any kind,\r\nonly by the glitter of their weapons. The Spanish captain immediately\r\nmade preparation for battle. Leaving a sufficient number to protect the\r\nwork and guard the camp,[XXVII-43] he advanced against them with the\r\nremainder of his forces, and was soon engaged in a desperate struggle.\r\nThree several times the ranks of the mountaineers were broken, and\r\nas often did they rally and attack with ever increasing fury. Only\r\nthe steel and cotton armor of the Spanish forces saved them from\r\ndestruction. As it was, lance and sword, bullet and bolt, reaped the\r\nusual harvest, and on the plain, saturated with blood and bespotted with\r\nmangled bodies, the Spaniards at last stood triumphant.[XXVII-44]\r\n\r\nThenceforth the siege continued uninterrupted. The work of cutting the\r\nroad dragged slowly on, and by the middle of October both besiegers and\r\nbesieged were undergoing intense suffering. Within the city famine was\r\ndaily gathering its victims; every eatable substance, to the leather of\r\ntheir shields, had been consumed, and the survivors were feeding on the\r\nbodies of the dead. Scarcity of provisions, too, was felt in the Spanish\r\ncamp. But this was not the worst. The weather was unusually severe;\r\nicy hailstorms and keen frosts caused much suffering to the invaders,\r\nunaccustomed to the cold of that altitude. Fever and ague also attacked\r\nthem. From the rain and hail that fell the plain had become a swamp, and\r\nday by day Gonzalo saw the number of his haggard troops' grow smaller.\r\nA more speedy method of reducing the place must be adopted or the\r\nattempt abandoned. Accordingly he sent off his sick to Huehuetenango,\r\nand stopping work on the road, prepared to make the desperate attempt\r\nto storm the place with scaling ladders.[XXVII-45] He had already\r\nconstructed a number of these ladders, huge in size and wide enough to\r\nallow three men to ascend abreast, and was on the point of making the\r\nattack when there appeared an envoy from Caibil Balam suing for peace.\r\nThis unfortunate ruler had previously attempted to escape by night with\r\nhis family and an escort of the principal chiefs; but having fallen in\r\nwith a patrolling party, he was wounded in the arm with a cross-bow bolt\r\nand compelled to return. And now he had taken counsel with his chiefs\r\non the subject of surrender. He had represented to them that all hope\r\nof relief was gone, while his famished subjects were dying around him.\r\nSubmission alone could save the few survivors. The chiefs had eagerly\r\napproved his words, and the tender of submission was made. Gonzalo's\r\nsatisfaction at this unexpected termination of the siege was indeed\r\ngreat. A spot midway between the gate of Zakuléu and the quarters of\r\nthe cavalry was appointed as the place of meeting for the settlement of\r\nterms, and Gonzalo, accompanied by Loarca, Salazar, Arévalo, and twelve\r\nothers, there met the humbled Caibil Balam. The Spaniard's reception\r\nof the native ruler was friendly in the extreme, and with an embrace,\r\nGonzalo assured him of his love and friendship. Under such kindly\r\ntreatment, so little expected, the stoical self-command of the weakened\r\nwarrior gave way, and he wept as he returned the victor's greeting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COUNTRY PACIFIED.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards then took formal possession of the city in the name\r\nof the king of Spain.[XXVII-46] They destroyed the fortification at\r\nthe entrance,[XXVII-47] and made more practicable the road across\r\nthe ravine. The surrounding country was afterward explored and the\r\ntowns subjected to Spanish rule. In Huehuetenango Gonzalo de Alvarado\r\nstationed a strong garrison, with Gonzalo de Solis as captain, and\r\nhaving taken all the necessary measures for the permanent tranquillity\r\nof his newly conquered territory, he returned to Guatemala City toward\r\nthe end of the year.\r\n\r\nHenceforth conquest, oppression, and destruction marched hand-in-hand\r\nover the country, and the result was a national and social eclipse of\r\nthe fallen races. Their arts and sciences were soon forgotten; their\r\narchitectural skill was lost; and from a state of happy development\r\ntheir life as a nation was blotted out. To what extent the progress\r\nof the world would have been benefited or retarded, had the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the American table-lands survived as integral nations, it\r\nis impossible to say; but we may question how much the occupation of the\r\ncountry by the Spaniards contributed toward general advancement. It is\r\nthought by some that the great Indian nations had reached the limit of\r\ntheir present line of progress when the Spaniards arrived. In Guatemala\r\nthe individual kings had by long lines of succession arrived at that\r\nstage of monarchy when power begets luxury and decay. Without European\r\ninterference there might have been a relapse and a dark age; and a later\r\nview, had discovery been delayed to our own time for instance, might\r\nhave found Mexico and Central America overrun by savage hordes from the\r\nnorth and ruined cities scattered over the land. To this fancy I am not\r\nprepared wholly to subscribe.[XXVII-48]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [III-1] The island known to-day as Hayti was named by Columbus\r\n     _Insula Hispaniæ_, Island of Spain. On one of his maps it is\r\n     called _Insula Hyspaniæ_, and on another _Hyspana_. By the\r\n     early navigators and chroniclers the name was turned into\r\n     Spanish and spoken and written _La Isla Española_, the Spanish\r\n     Isle, or _La Española_. _Hispaniola_, as it is called at a\r\n     later period by English authors, is neither Latin nor Spanish;\r\n     it may be a syncope of the words _Insula Hyspaniæ_, or more\r\n     likely it is a corruption of _La Española_ by foreigners to\r\n     whom the Spanish _ñ_ was not familiar. The choice lies between\r\n     the mutilation, _Hispaniola_, of English authors, and the\r\n     correct but unfamiliar _Española_, and I adopt the latter.\r\n\r\n     [III-2] Usually two royal officers went out by each departure;\r\n     a treasurer to take charge of the gold, and a notary to\r\n     watch the treasurer and write down what was seen and done.\r\n     The government was exceedingly strict in its regulations of\r\n     discoveries by sea, as well as in all matters relative to\r\n     commerce and colonization. Notice was given by Ferdinand and\r\n     Isabella September 3, 1501, by Charles V. November 17, 1526,\r\n     and by Philip II. in 1563, that no one should go to the Indies\r\n     except under express license from the king. In 1526 Charles\r\n     V. ordered that the captain of any discovering or trading\r\n     vessel should not go ashore within the limits mentioned in\r\n     his patent without the permission of the royal officers and\r\n     priests on board, under penalty of confiscation of half the\r\n     goods. The law of 1556 stipulates that ships must be properly\r\n     equipped, provisioned for one year, always sail in pairs, and\r\n     carry in each two pilots and two priests. In his _ordenanzas\r\n     de poblaciones_ of 1563 Philip II. directs that vessels\r\n     making discoveries shall carry scissors, combs, knives,\r\n     looking-glasses, rifles, axes, fishhooks, colored caps, glass\r\n     beads, and the like, as means of introduction and traffic.\r\n     _Recopilacion de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias_, ii.\r\n     6-7. In regard to the share of the crown in the gold gathered\r\n     our popular writers seem to have found original authorities\r\n     somewhat vague. It is clearly enough stated that settlers\r\n     are to pay two thirds; the question is whether in relation to\r\n     discoverers gold is included in products of which one tenth\r\n     was to go to the crown, or whether the exception to a rule\r\n     was unintentionally omitted. Mr Irving glides gracefully over\r\n     the difficulty with the same degree of indefiniteness that\r\n     he finds in the authorities. Mr Prescott states positively,\r\n     _History of Ferdinand and Isabella_, ii. 488, that 'the ships\r\n     fitted out under the general license were required to reserve\r\n     ... two thirds of all the gold' for the crown, quoting Muñoz\r\n     and Navarrete as vouchers, the words of neither justifying\r\n     the statement. Muñoz, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, i. 240, says, 'se\r\n     concedió á todos generalmente, sin mas gravamen que pagar\r\n     la décima de lo que se rescatase,' while Navarrete, _Col.\r\n     de Viages_, ii. 167, printing the _real provision_ itself,\r\n     states simply 'es nuestra merced que de lo que las dichas\r\n     personas hallaren en las dichas islas é tierra-firme hayan\r\n     para sí las nueve partes, é la otra diezma parte sea para\r\n     Nos.' The misstatement of the talented author of _Ferdinand\r\n     and Isabella_ is rendered all the more conspicuous when on the\r\n     very next page quoted by him Muñoz settles the whole matter\r\n     exactly contrary to Prescott's account. 'todos se permitió\r\n     llevar víveres y mercancías, rescatar oro de los naturales\r\n     contribuyendo al rey con la décima.' And after thus stating\r\n     distinctly that all might trade with the natives for gold\r\n     on paying one tenth to the crown, he gives the reason why\r\n     miners must pay two thirds to the crown; or if the recipient\r\n     of pecuniary aid from the crown, then four fifths; it was\r\n     because of the supposed exceeding richness of the mines, the\r\n     ease with which gold could be obtained; and, further, the\r\n     dependence of the crown on its mines, more than on anything\r\n     else for a colonial revenue. Prior to 1504 the regulation of\r\n     the royal share was not fixed, some of the traders paying one\r\n     tenth gross, some one fifth gross, and some one fourth net.\r\n     Bobadilla, in 1500, granted twenty years' licenses to settlers\r\n     in Española to work gold mines by paying only one eleventh to\r\n     the crown. Summarizing the subsequent laws upon the subject,\r\n     we find ordered by Ferdinand and Isabella, February 5, 1504,\r\n     reiterated by Philip, 1572, that all dwellers in the Indies\r\n     must pay to the crown one fifth of all gold, silver, lead,\r\n     tin, quicksilver, iron, or other metal obtained by them;\r\n     likewise traders were to pay one fifth of all gold, silver,\r\n     or other metals, pearls, precious stones, or amber obtained by\r\n     them. September 14, 1519, Charles V. declared that of all gold\r\n     received in trade from the natives one fifth must be paid to\r\n     him; and March 8, 1530, he said that where a reward has been\r\n     promised to a prospector of mines the royal treasury would pay\r\n     two thirds of that reward, and the private persons interested\r\n     one third. It was ordered September 4, 1536, and reiterated\r\n     June 19, 1540, that all persons must pay the king's fifth on\r\n     the before-mentioned articles, whether obtained in battle or\r\n     by plundering-expeditions, or by trade. Of all gold, silver,\r\n     pearls, and precious stones received as ransom of a cacique\r\n     or other principal personage the king was to have one third;\r\n     the remainder, after deducting the king's fifth, was to be\r\n     divided among the members of the expedition. Of the spoils\r\n     secured from a cacique slain in battle, or executed, one half\r\n     was the crown's, and one half, except the king's fifth, the\r\n     property of the conquerors. June 5, 1551, it was ordered,\r\n     and reiterated August 24, 1619, that beside the king's share,\r\n     there be levied a duty of 1½ per cent. to pay for smelting,\r\n     assaying, and stamping. By the _ordenanzas de poblaciones_ of\r\n     Philip II., 1563, the adelantado of a discovery by land, and\r\n     his successor, and the settlers were to pay the crown but one\r\n     tenth on metals and precious stones for the term of ten years.\r\n     _Recop. de Indias_, ii. 10, 68, 75-7, 79, and 480-1.\r\n\r\n     [III-3] The document may be seen to-day in the archives of\r\n     the Indies. Beginning: 'EL REY É LA REINA. El asiento que se\r\n     tomó por nuestro mandado con vos Rodrigo de Bastidas, vecino\r\n     de la cibdad de Sevilla, para ir á descobrir por el mar\r\n     Océano, con dos navios, es lo siguiente:'—it goes on to state,\r\n     'First, that we give license to you, the said Rodrigo de\r\n     Bastidas, that with two vessels of your own, and at your own\r\n     cost and risk, you may go by the said Ocean Sea to discover,\r\n     and you may discover islands and firm land; in the parts of\r\n     the Indies and in any other parts, provided it be not the\r\n     islands and firm land already discovered by the Admiral Don\r\n     Cristóbal Colon, our admiral of the Ocean Sea, or by Cristóbal\r\n     Guerra; nor those which have been or may be discovered by\r\n     other person or persons by our order and with our license\r\n     before you; nor the islands and firm land which belong to the\r\n     most serene prince, the king of Portugal, our very dear and\r\n     beloved son; for from them nor from any of them you shall not\r\n     take anything, save only such things as for your maintenance,\r\n     and for the provision of your ships and crew you may need.\r\n     Furthermore, that all the gold, and silver, and copper, and\r\n     lead, and tin, and quicksilver, and any other metal whatever;\r\n     and _aljofar_, and pearls, and precious stones and jewels,\r\n     and slaves and negroes, and mixed breeds, which in these our\r\n     kingdoms may be held and reputed as slaves; and monsters and\r\n     serpents, and whatever other animals and fishes and birds,\r\n     and spices and drugs, and every other thing of whatsoever\r\n     name or quality or value it may be; deducting therefrom the\r\n     freight expenses, and cost of vessels, which in said voyage\r\n     and fleet may be made; of the remainder to us will belong the\r\n     fourth part of the whole, and the other three fourths may be\r\n     freely for you the said Rodrigo de Bastidas, that you may do\r\n     therewith as you choose and may be pleased to do, as a thing\r\n     of your own, free and unincumbered. _Item_, that we will\r\n     place in each one of the said ships one or two persons, who in\r\n     our name or by our order shall be witnesses to all which may\r\n     be obtained and trafficked in said vessels of the aforesaid\r\n     things; and that they may put the same in writing and keep a\r\n     book and account thereof, so that no fraud or mistake happen.'\r\n     After stating further under whose direction the ships should\r\n     be fitted out, and what should be done on the return of the\r\n     expedition, the document is dated at Seville, June 5, 1500,\r\n     and the signatures follow: 'YO EL REY. YO LA REINA. Por\r\n     mandado del Rey é de la Reina, GASPAR DE GRIZIO.' All this\r\n     under penalty of the forfeiture of the property and life of\r\n     the captain of the expedition, Rodrigo de Bastidas. _Archivo\r\n     de Indias_, printed in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     ii. 362-6.\r\n\r\n     [III-4]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: CARAVEL.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: GALLEY.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: GALEAZA.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: GALLEON.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: NAVIO.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: BRIGANTINE.]\r\n\r\n     It is often remarked with wonder in what small and\r\n     apparently insecure vessels the early navigators traversed\r\n     perilous seas and explored unknown coasts. That shipwreck\r\n     so often attended their ventures is less surprising than\r\n     that so many escaped destruction. Two of the three vessels\r\n     employed by Columbus were open boats, according to _March y\r\n     Labores_, _Historia de la Marina Real Española_, i. 98, of\r\n     forty tons each, and the decked _Santa María_, only sixty\r\n     tons. The term caravel was originally given to ships navigated\r\n     wholly by sails as distinguished from the galley propelled\r\n     by oars. It has been applied to a great variety of vessels\r\n     of different size and construction. The caravels of the New\r\n     World discoverers may be generally described as long, narrow\r\n     boats of from twenty to one hundred tons burden, with three\r\n     or four masts of about equal height carrying sometimes square\r\n     and sometimes lateen sails, the fourth mast set at the heel\r\n     of the bowsprit carrying square sails. They were usually\r\n     half-decked, and adorned with the lofty forecastle and loftier\r\n     poop of the day. The latter constituted over that part of\r\n     the vessel a double or treble deck, which was pierced for\r\n     cannon. A class of vessels like the _Santa María_, beside a\r\n     double stern deck, had a forward deck armed with small pieces\r\n     for throwing stones and grape. In the archives of Mallorca\r\n     is a picture of a caravel drawn in 1397, and a very fair\r\n     representation of those in use a century later may be found\r\n     on Juan de la Cosa's map. The large decked ships of from 100\r\n     to 1200 tons had two, three, or four masts, and square sails,\r\n     with high poop and sometimes high prow. In naval engagements\r\n     and in discovery the smaller vessels seemed to be preferred,\r\n     being more easily handled. Columbus, at Paria, complained of\r\n     his vessel of 100 tons as being too large. In his _ordenanzas\r\n     de poblaciones_ of 1563 Philip II. required every discoverer\r\n     to take at least two vessels of not over sixty tons each, in\r\n     order to enter inlets, cross the bars of rivers, and pass over\r\n     shoals. The larger ships, if any were of the expedition, must\r\n     remain in a safe port until another safe port was found by\r\n     the small craft. Thirty men and no more were to go in every\r\n     ship, and the pilots must write down what they encountered\r\n     for the benefit of other pilots. _Recop. de Indias_, ii. 5-6.\r\n     The _galera_ was a vessel of low bulwarks, navigated by sails\r\n     and oars, usually twenty or thirty oars on either side, four\r\n     or five oarsmen to a bench. It frequently carried a large\r\n     cannon, called _cruxia_, two of medium size, and two small\r\n     guns. The _galeaza_ was the largest class of galera, or craft\r\n     propelled wholly or in part by oars. It had three masts; it\r\n     commonly carried twenty cannon, and the poop accommodated a\r\n     small army of fusileers and sharpshooters. A _galeota_ was\r\n     a small galera, having only sixteen or twenty oarsmen on a\r\n     side, and two masts. The _galeon_ was a large armed merchant\r\n     vessel with high bulwarks, three or four decks, with two or\r\n     three masts, square-rigged spreading courses and top-sails,\r\n     and sometimes top-gallant sails. One fleet of twelve galleons,\r\n     from 1000 to 1200 tons burden, was named after the twelve\r\n     apostles. Those which plied between Acapulco and Manila were\r\n     from 1200 to 2000 tons burden. A _galeoncillo_ was a small\r\n     galeon. The _carac_ was a large carrying vessel, the one\r\n     intended for Columbus' second voyage being 1250 _toneles_,\r\n     or 1500 tons. A _nao_, or _navío_, was a large ship with high\r\n     bulwarks and three masts. A _nave_ was a vessel with deck and\r\n     sails; the former distinguishing it from the _barca_, and the\r\n     absence of oars from a galera. The _bergantin_, or brig, had\r\n     low bulwarks; the _bergantin-goleta_ was a hermaphrodite brig,\r\n     or brigantine, built for fast sailing. The name brigantine was\r\n     applied in America also to an open flat-bottomed boat which\r\n     usually carried one sail and from eight to sixteen men, with\r\n     a capacity for about 100 persons.\r\n\r\n     [III-5] The Spanish league varies with time and place. It was\r\n     not until 1801 that the diverse measurements of the several\r\n     original kingdoms were by royal order made uniform, the legal\r\n     league then becoming throughout all Spain 20,000 Spanish feet.\r\n     Of these leagues there are twenty to the degree, making each\r\n     three geographical miles, being, as specified by the law, the\r\n     distance travelled on foot at a steady gait in one hour. The\r\n     land league was, by law of Alfonso the Wise, 3000 paces, as\r\n     specified by the _Siete Partidas_. The discoverers roughly\r\n     estimated a league at from two and a half to three and a\r\n     half English miles. A marine or geographical league at that\r\n     time was about 7500 varas, or little less than four English\r\n     miles, there being nearly 17½ to a degree of latitude. In\r\n     different parts of Spanish America the league is different,\r\n     being sometimes quite short. In Cuba a league consists of 5078\r\n     varas, and in Mexico of 5000 varas. The vara is the Spanish\r\n     yard, comprising three Spanish feet of eleven English inches\r\n     each. Since the decline of Roman influence, the Spaniards have\r\n     had no equivalent for the English mile.\r\n\r\n     [III-6] See next chapter, note 18.\r\n\r\n     [III-7] Called by the Venetians _bissas_, and by the Spaniards\r\n     _broma_; a terrible pest to tropical navigators before the\r\n     days of copper-bottoming. This, and another tropical marine\r\n     worm, the _Simnoria terebrans_, brought hither by ships,\r\n     play havoc with the wharf-piling of San Francisco and other\r\n     west-coast harbors.\r\n\r\n     [III-8] The early chroniclers make their reckonings of\r\n     values under different names at different times. Thus during\r\n     the discoveries of Columbus we hear of little else but\r\n     _maravedís_; then the _peso de oro_ takes the lead, together\r\n     with the _castellano_; all along _marco_ and _ducado_ being\r\n     occasionally used. At the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\n     and before and after, Spanish values were reckoned from a\r\n     mark of silver, which was the standard. A mark was half a\r\n     pound either of gold or silver. The gold mark was divided into\r\n     fifty castellanos; the silver mark into eight ounces. In the\r\n     reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the mark was divided by law\r\n     into 65 _reales de vellon_ of 34 maravedís each, making 2210\r\n     maravedís in a mark. To show how changeable were the values\r\n     of subsidiary Spanish coins, and how utterly impossible it\r\n     is accurately and at all times to determine by their names\r\n     the amount of metal they represent, it is only necessary to\r\n     state that in the reign of Alfonso XI., 1312-1350, there were\r\n     125 maravedís to the mark, while in the reign of Ferdinand\r\n     VII., 1808-1833, a mark was divided into 5440 maravedís.\r\n     In Spanish America a _real_ is one eighth of a _peso_, and\r\n     equal to 2½ reales de vellon. The peso contains one ounce\r\n     of silver; it was formerly called _peso de ocho reales de\r\n     plata_, whence came the term _pieces of eight_, a vulgarism\r\n     at one time in vogue among the merchants and buccaneers in\r\n     the West Indies. This coin is designated more particularly\r\n     as _peso fuerte_, or _peso duro_, to distinguish it from\r\n     _peso sencillo_, equivalent in value to four fifths of the\r\n     former. The mutilator of Herrera translates _pesos de oro_\r\n     as pieces of eight, in which as in other things he is about\r\n     as far as possible wrong. The castellano, the one fiftieth\r\n     of the golden mark, in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\n     was equivalent to 490 maravedís of that day. The _peso de\r\n     oro_, according to Oviedo, was exactly equivalent to the\r\n     castellano, and either was one third greater than the ducado,\r\n     or ducat. The _doblon_, the popular name for the _excelente_,\r\n     was first struck by Ferdinand and Isabella as a gold coin\r\n     of the weight of two castellanos. The modern doubloon is an\r\n     ounce of coined gold, and is worth 16 pesos fuertes. Reduced\r\n     to United States currency the peso fuerte, as slightly alloyed\r\n     bullion, is in weight nearly enough equivalent to one dollar.\r\n     Therefore a mark of silver is equal to eight dollars; a\r\n     piece of eight, equal to one peso, which equals one dollar;\r\n     a real de vellon, five cents; a Spanish-American real, 12½\r\n     cents; a maravedí, 100/276 of a cent; a castellano, or peso\r\n     de oro, $2.56; a doubloon, $5.14; a ducat, $1.92; a mark of\r\n     gold, $128, assuming the United States alloy. The fact that\r\n     a castellano was equivalent to only 490 maravedís shows the\r\n     exceedingly high value of silver as compared with gold at\r\n     the period in question. The modern ounce, or doubloon, is\r\n     valued at about $16. As to the relative purchasing power\r\n     of the precious metals at different times during the past\r\n     four centuries economists differ. The returns brought by the\r\n     first discoverers began the depreciation, which was rapidly\r\n     accelerated by the successive conquests, notably of Mexico\r\n     and Peru. Any one may estimate; no one can determine with\r\n     exactness. Robertson, Prescott, and other writers make but\r\n     guess-work of it (see _Hist. America_, and _Conq. Mexico_,\r\n     passim) when they attempt to measure the uncertain and widely\r\n     diversified denominations of centuries ago by the current coin\r\n     of to-day.\r\n\r\n     [III-9] Las Casas, who was at Santo Domingo when the\r\n     shipwrecked mariners arrived, saw Bastidas, and part of his\r\n     gold, and the natives of Darien whom he had brought, and who\r\n     in place of the Adamic fig-leaf wore a funnel-shaped covering\r\n     of gold. There were great riches, it was said; three chests\r\n     full of gold and pearls, which on reaching Spain were ordered\r\n     to be publicly displayed in all the towns through which the\r\n     notary passed on his way to court. This, as an advertisement\r\n     of the Indies, was done to kindle the fires of avarice and\r\n     discontent in sluggish breasts, that therefrom others might\r\n     be induced to go and gather gold and pay the king his fifth.\r\n     Afterward Bastidas returned with his wife and children to\r\n     Santo Domingo, and became rich in horned cattle, having at one\r\n     time 8000 head; and that when a cow in Española was worth 50\r\n     pesos de oro. In 1504 he again visited Urabá, in two ships,\r\n     and brought thence 600 natives, whom he enslaved in Española.\r\n     In 1520 the emperor gave him the pacification of Trinidad\r\n     with the title of adelantado; which grant being opposed by\r\n     Diego Colon, on the ground that the island was of his father's\r\n     discovering, Bastidas waived his claim, and accepted the\r\n     governorship of Santa Marta, where he went with 450 men, and\r\n     was assassinated by his lieutenant, Villafuerte, who thought\r\n     to succeed him, and to silence the governor's interposed\r\n     objections to the maltreatment of the natives. Thus if the\r\n     humane Bastidas, in accordance with the custom of the day, did\r\n     inhumanly enslave his fellow-creatures, he gave his life at\r\n     last to save them from other cruelties; which act, standing\r\n     as it does luminous and alone in a century of continuous\r\n     outrage, entitles him to the honorable distinction of Spain's\r\n     best and noblest _conquistador_. As the eloquent Quintana\r\n     says: 'Bastidas no se hizo célebre ni como descubridor ni\r\n     como conquistador; pero su memoria debe ser grata á todos\r\n     los amantes de la justicia y de la humanidad, por haber sido\r\n     uno de los pocos que trataron á los indios con equidad y\r\n     mansedumbre, considerando aquel pais mas bien como un objeto\r\n     de especulaciones mercantiles con iguales, que como campo de\r\n     gloria y de conquistas.'\r\n\r\n     Among the standard authorities mention is made of Bastidas\r\n     and his voyage by Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iii. 10-12,\r\n     who refutes certain of Oviedo's unimportant statements in\r\n     _Historia General y Natural de las Indias_, i. 76-7; ii.\r\n     334-5; by Herrera, i. 148-9; Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, fol. 67;\r\n     and in _Galvano's Discov._, 99-100, and 102-3. But before\r\n     these I should place original documents found in _Navarrete_,\r\n     _Col. de Viages_, iii. 25-28, 545-6, and 591-3, and in the\r\n     _Coleccion_ of Pacheco and Cárdenas, of both of which works\r\n     I shall presently speak more fully. In tom. ii. pp. 362-6 of\r\n     this latter collection is given the _Asiento que hizo con sus\r\n     Majestades Católicas Rodrigo de Bastidas_, before mentioned;\r\n     and on pp. 366-467, same volume, is _Informacion de los\r\n     servicios del adelantado Rodrigo de Bastidas, conquistador\r\n     y pacificador de Santa Marta_. Next in importance to the\r\n     chroniclers are, _Historia de la Marina Real Española_, i.\r\n     284; _Morelli_, _Fasti Novi Orbis_, 11; _Robertson's Hist.\r\n     Am._, i. 159; _Help's Spanish Conquest_, i. 294; _Acosta_,\r\n     _Compend. Hist. Nueva Granada_, 21; _Irving's Columbus_, iii.\r\n     53-6, and _Quintana_, _Vidas de Españoles Célebres_, 'Vasco\r\n     Nuñez de Balboa,' 1. _Robinson's Acct. Discov. in West_,\r\n     105; _Lardner's Maritime Discovery_, ii. 32; _Holmes' Annals\r\n     of America_, i. 20; _Lerdo de Tejada_, _Apuntes Hist._, 89;\r\n     _Harris' Voy._, i. 270; _Major's Prince Henry_, 369, and like\r\n     allusions are worthless. In _Kerr's Col. Voy._, ii. 58-63,\r\n     is given a translation of Galvano. In Aa's collection the\r\n     narrative is substantially the same as in Gottfried's.\r\n\r\n     [IV-1] His nephew, Fernando, in his _Hist. Almirante_, in\r\n     _Barcia_, passim, and those who follow this author closely,\r\n     as Napione and De Conti, call him El Prefecto; Herrera, Diego\r\n     Mendez, Diego de Porras, Robertson, Navarrete, and others,\r\n     employ the title adelantado. Herrera says he was captain of\r\n     one of the ships.\r\n\r\n     [IV-2] Ferdinand Columbus, or as he is more commonly called\r\n     Fernando Colon, was an illegitimate son of Christopher\r\n     Columbus, by a lady of respectable family. He was born at\r\n     Córdova, and in 1494, after his father became famous, was\r\n     brought with his elder brother to court, where he was placed\r\n     as page to Prince Juan. Upon the death of the heir apparent\r\n     young Fernando served Queen Isabella in the same capacity,\r\n     thereby securing an excellent education. During this perilous\r\n     voyage he was an object no less of comfort than of anxiety\r\n     to his father, now infirm and troubled in spirit, and his\r\n     conduct throughout merited and received paternal commendation.\r\n     'El ha salido y sale de muy buen saber,' writes the fond\r\n     father, 'bien que él sea niño en dias, no es assi en el\r\n     entendimiento.' _Cartas de Colon_, in _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\n     de Viages_, i. 341 and 344. See also _Zúñiga_, _Anales de\r\n     Sevilla_. His manhood fulfilled the promise of his youth.\r\n     He cultivated literature with considerable success, and\r\n     became, as Muñoz, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, i. viii., expresses\r\n     it, 'doctísimo para su siglo, y de grandes pensamientos\r\n     en materias literarias, segun demostraré á su tiempo.' He\r\n     travelled extensively in Europe, in the train of Charles V.,\r\n     probably visited Africa and Asia, and is said to have made\r\n     two voyages to America after his father's death. He formed\r\n     a collection of over 20,000 printed books and manuscripts,\r\n     which went to the cathedral of Seville. He neither married,\r\n     nor left any recognized progeny. He was the author of several\r\n     works which have not been preserved, the inscription on\r\n     his tomb mentioning one in four divisions relating partly\r\n     to the New World and his father's voyages. Antonio de Leon\r\n     Pinelo, _Epitome_, 565, 633 and 711, speaks of a work,\r\n     _Apuntamientos sobre la Demarcacion del Maluco_, preserved\r\n     in manuscript at Simancas. The only printed book of Fernando\r\n     Colon is a history of the admiral, his father. The original\r\n     title is not known, the manuscript disappearing before its\r\n     publication in Spanish. Luis Colon, duke of Veraguas, and\r\n     grandson of the admiral, brought the manuscript to Genoa\r\n     about 1568, and delivered it to one Fornari, an old man who,\r\n     according to Barcia, began to print it in Spanish, Italian,\r\n     and Latin. Others assert that it passed into the hands of\r\n     Marini, who caused it to be translated into Italian by Alfonso\r\n     de Ulloa. _Spotorno_, _Codice Diplomatico_, 1823, lxiii.\r\n     Ulloa's translation, badly made from a bad copy—'sans doute\r\n     d'après un texte assez fautif,' _Humboldt_, _Exam. Crit._,\r\n     i. 13,—was printed in Venice, in 1571, under the title,\r\n     _Historie del Fernando Colombo; Nelle quali s'ha particolare,\r\n     & vera relatione della vita, & de' fatti dell' Ammiraglio\r\n     D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre_, etc. It was reprinted\r\n     in Italian some six or eight times. A French translation was\r\n     published in 1680-1, and an English translation has gone the\r\n     rounds, appearing in _Churchill's Col. Voy._, ii. 480-604;\r\n     _Kerr's Col. Voy._, iii. 1-242; and _Pinkerton's Col. Voy._,\r\n     xii. 1-155. It was carelessly retranslated from the Italian\r\n     into Spanish by Andrés Gonzalez de Barcia, and printed in\r\n     his _Historiadores Primitivos de las Indias Occidentales_, 3\r\n     vols., Madrid, 1749, comprising pp. 1-128, tom. i., of that\r\n     series, and entitled, _La Historia de D. Fernando Colon, en\r\n     la qual se da Particular, y verdadera relacion de la vida, y\r\n     hechos de el Almirante D. Christoval Colon, su Padre_, etc.\r\n     This is the edition most commonly used, and to this I refer,\r\n     although I have before me an Italian copy of the edition of\r\n     1709. Fernando Colon had peculiar advantages for writing his\r\n     father's history. Himself an actor in the events described,\r\n     he was moreover personally acquainted with his father's\r\n     friends, and held possession of his father's papers. All\r\n     agree that he made good use of his opportunity, and that he\r\n     has given a clear statement of events which even in his own\r\n     time began to be distorted. If he was silent touching his\r\n     father's family, country, and birth, we must remember that\r\n     poverty and obscurity were a disgrace in those days, and that\r\n     the son Fernando was a Spaniard. Those who should best know\r\n     the merits of this author pay him the highest tribute. Of\r\n     his work says Muñoz, _Hist. Nuevo Mundo_, i. viii., 'Confieso\r\n     deberle mucho;' and the author Navarrete, _Col. de Viages_, i.\r\n     lxx., remarks, 'habló siempre con verdad y exactitud, salvo\r\n     alguna equivocacion fácil de discernir en buena crítica ...\r\n     y por tanto pueden aun estas leves faltas ser efecto de la\r\n     incuria ó poca inteligencia de ambos traductores.' Attempts\r\n     have been made to deny to Fernando the authorship, but this,\r\n     if correct, does not materially affect its value, since it\r\n     is allowed to have been written from his documents and under\r\n     his supervision. The vicissitudes to which the work has been\r\n     subjected and the mutilation it has suffered afford grounds\r\n     for caution not to be disregarded by the historian. Still, the\r\n     general tenor and details of the narrative, and the literary\r\n     bent of the reputed author, present in themselves sufficient\r\n     evidence of its authenticity.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the use of certain proper names encountered\r\n     thus far in this history I would say a word. The question\r\n     presents difficulties in whatsoever aspect viewed. There\r\n     are Spanish names of places and persons which custom has\r\n     so anglicized as to give to their use in the original the\r\n     appearance of affectation—instance Castilla, for Castile;\r\n     Sevilla, Seville; Fernando and Isabel, Ferdinand and Isabella;\r\n     Cárlos V., Charles V.; Felipe II., Philip II. On the other\r\n     hand, in writing in English of Spanish affairs, the attempt to\r\n     continue indefinitely the anglicizing of Spanish names would\r\n     be as impossible as absurd. The two chief objects with me have\r\n     been to adopt the best forms, and to preserve consistency; I\r\n     do not claim eminent success in either attempt. The result,\r\n     however, has been the adoption of the following method, if it\r\n     may be called a method: The prominent places and persons of\r\n     Spain, whose names are invariably given in their anglicized\r\n     form in current English literature, I write in the same way;\r\n     but those same names, as well as all others, appearing in\r\n     the New World, where no prominent English writers have made\r\n     them familiar in an English form, I present in the original\r\n     as written by the best Spanish scholars. Thus the name of the\r\n     great Genoese I give in its common latinized form, Christopher\r\n     Columbus, while in the use of those of his less eminent\r\n     brothers and sons, who soon became almost or altogether\r\n     Spaniards, I adopt the forms employed by Spaniards.\r\n\r\n     [IV-3] Instance the title-page of the first work published\r\n     on the New World, in 1493:—_Epistola Christofori Colom: cui\r\n     etas nostra multũ a debet: de Insulis Indie supra Gangem nuper\r\n     inuentis.

In search of which he was sent\r\n     eight months since, under the auspices and at the expense of\r\n     the most invincible Ferdinand, king of the Spains. Sent to the\r\n     magnificent lord Raphael Sanxis, treasurer of the same most\r\n     serene king, and which the noble and learned man, Aliander de\r\n     Cosco, translated from the Spanish idiom into Latin. The third\r\n     day of the Calends of May, 1493. Pontificate of Alexander VI.,\r\n     Year One.\r\n\r\n     [IV-4] Guanaja is the most easterly of a group called the Bay\r\n     Islands. To the west of Guanaja, in the order here named, lie\r\n     Barbaretta, Helena, Morat, Ruatan, the largest, and Utila. On\r\n     Peter Martyr's map, _India beyond the Ganges_, 1510, Guanaja\r\n     is written _guanasa_. On map iv., _Munich Atlas_, supposed\r\n     to have been drawn by Salvat Pilestrina in 1515, Guanaja is\r\n     called _sam fir.co_, San Francisco; Ruatan, _todo samto_;\r\n     and Utila, _I:lhana_. Fernando Colon locates on his map,\r\n     1527, _y:llana_, _s:francisco_, and _todos sanctos_, and\r\n     between the last two, _sancta ffe._ On the map of Diego de\r\n     Ribera, 1529, are _s:franco_, _to stõs_, _la llana_, and\r\n     _s∴ fe._ Vaz Dourado, 1571, map x., _Munich Atlas_, calls\r\n     Guanaja, _lla ganaxa_; Ruatan, _aguba_; and Utila, _dotila_.\r\n     _Mercator's Atlas_, 1574, gives _Guanaxos_; _Ogilby's Map_,\r\n     1671, _Guanaja_, _Guajama_, _Roatan_, and _Vtila_; _Laet_,\r\n     _Novvs Orbis_, 1633, the same; _Jefferys' Voyages_, 1776,\r\n     _Guanaja_ or _Bonaka_, _Guajama_ or _Rattan_, and _Utila_.\r\n     Of Guanaja, Diego de Porras in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_,\r\n     i. 283, remarks:—'es pequeña, bojará veinte leguas, no tiene\r\n     cosa de provecho.' Utila is low and level; hence the name,\r\n     La Llana. In his remarks on the two oldest maps of America,\r\n     Kohl says of Guanaja:—'Das Columbus sie schon gesehen hat,\r\n     ist zu bezweifeln, da er wohl nicht so weit westwärts segelte\r\n     oder blickte. Vielleicht sahen sie jedoch Pinzon und Solis\r\n     1508. Gewiss ist es, dass sie schon 1516 von einer spanischen\r\n     Expedition, die zum Menschenraub von Cuba nach Süden\r\n     ausgelaufen war, besucht wurde.' Fernando Colon complains that\r\n     Solis and Pinzon, visiting these regions in 1508, re-named\r\n     many localities, claiming to be the first discoverers, and\r\n     thus causing much confusion in the charts of the times.\r\n\r\n     And here as well as elsewhere I may speak of a work from\r\n     which I have derived no inconsiderable advantage in tracing\r\n     the metamorphoses of names from those originally given\r\n     to those finally established. Believing that much curious\r\n     and valuable historical information might be obtained by\r\n     instituting a close comparison of the nomenclature employed\r\n     by the earlier makers of charts at their respective dates,\r\n     in 1873 I directed Mr Goldschmidt to bring out and arrange\r\n     for convenient reference all such relevant maps as my library\r\n     contained. Beginning then with the earliest, we entered on\r\n     paper prepared for the purpose the names of all the principal\r\n     places contained within our territory. And so with the next,\r\n     and the next, through the successive periods of discovery,\r\n     following the coast on one side from Darien to Texas, and\r\n     on the other from Panamá to Alaska, and along the Arctic\r\n     seaboard to the Mackenzie River. Inland names were included,\r\n     but their number was small as compared with those along the\r\n     ocean. Some 200 maps, each original authority for its time\r\n     and place, were thus examined, and the names which had been\r\n     applied at various times and by various persons to the several\r\n     important geographical points along this vast shore line,\r\n     and throughout the inland area, were brought together so that\r\n     comparisons might be made, and the nomenclatural history of\r\n     the several places be quickly and correctly traced. All of the\r\n     authorities I cannot mention here, but they will severally be\r\n     referred to in their proper places during the course of this\r\n     history. The result of this labor at the end of six months, Mr\r\n     Goldschmidt working alone after the first fortnight, was three\r\n     folio manuscript volumes, entitled _Cartography of the Pacific\r\n     Coast of North America, and of the Eastern Coasts of Mexico\r\n     and Central America_. The maps more particularly examined in\r\n     writing this volume are as follows. Passing the sea charts\r\n     of Nicolo and Antonio Zeno, made about 1390, and used by\r\n     Frobisher; the ocean and islands between western Europe and\r\n     eastern Asia from the globe of Martin Behaim, 1492; the chart\r\n     of Juan de la Cosa, 1500, showing the West India Islands, but\r\n     omitting the coast of Central America; and the map of Johann\r\n     Ruysch, 1508,—we have, in part most important, the following:\r\n     Map of _India beyond the Ganges_, drawn by Peter Martyr in\r\n     1511, and showing a coast line from Brazil to the middle of\r\n     Yucatan. Along this line, in the order here given, from east\r\n     to west, are _vraba_, _tariene_, _el mamol_, _beragua_, _c\r\n     gra de dios_, _guanasa_, _b de lagartos_. North of Cuba is\r\n     a section of the continental shore line lettered _isla de\r\n     beimini, parte_. In Ptolemy's Cosmography, 1513, the coast\r\n     between Brazil and Florida is given, but without names. The\r\n     Atlantic is called _Oceanus Occidentalis_; and South America,\r\n     _Terra Incognita_. By Reisch, in _Margaritha Philosophica_,\r\n     1515, the map is called _Typvs Vniversalis Terre Ivxta_. Two\r\n     only of the islands are given and both called _Isabella_.\r\n     South of _Oceanus Occidentalis_ is a large continent called\r\n     _Paria sev Prisilia_, Paria or Brazil. There are no names on\r\n     the line of Central America, and the only lettering on the\r\n     small portion of the northern continent are the mysterious\r\n     words _Zoana Mela_, which have given rise to much discussion.\r\n     In 1859 was published at Munich, by the Royal Bavarian Academy\r\n     of Sciences, from manuscripts in the university library and\r\n     army archives, under the auspices of Friedrich Kunstmann, Karl\r\n     von Spruner, and Georg M. Thomas, and as supplementary to the\r\n     text of Kunstmann's _Die Entdeckung Amerikas_, a collection of\r\n     fac-similes of thirteen early maps of America, entitled _Atlas\r\n     zur Entdeckungsgeschichte Amerikas_. This work I shall cite\r\n     briefly as the _Munich Atlas_. Parts of the Pacific States\r\n     are shown on maps numbers iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. x. xii.\r\n     and xiii., which will be further mentioned in their several\r\n     places. Map iv. was drawn by Salvat de Pilestrina probably in\r\n     1515. It shows none of the main-land above Yucatan, which is\r\n     a peninsula. The northern coast of Central America is given,\r\n     and the southern seaboard only of the Isthmus. No names are\r\n     written on the southern coast. The South Sea is called _Mar\r\n     Visto pelos castelhanos_, Sea seen by the Spaniards. Map\r\n     v. is supposed to be by Visconte de Maiollo, 1519. It shows\r\n     the northern coast of the continent only from Cape Camaron\r\n     to about 30° south latitude. In a book entitled _Apiano,\r\n     Cosmographia_, 1575, a copy of a map supposed to have been\r\n     drawn by Peter Apianus in 1520, and the first upon which I\r\n     have seen the name 'America.' The northern part is long and\r\n     narrow, of a horseshoe shape, and lettered _Baccalearum_.\r\n     A large continent is placed north of a strait running round\r\n     the northern end of North America. Evidently Master Apianus\r\n     was determined no one during his time should out-north him\r\n     in map-delineation of a region of which absolutely nothing\r\n     was known, either then or for a long time after. On a map\r\n     of North America from the globe of Johann Schöner, 1520, the\r\n     name 'America' likewise appears, the lettering on the globe\r\n     being placed in Brazil, and being in these words:—_America\r\n     Vel Brasilia Sive Papagalli Terra_. The northern and southern\r\n     continents are separated by a strait at the Isthmus. It is\r\n     to be regretted that Master Schöner had not the making of\r\n     the world, so that it should agree with his map, and save\r\n     canal-cutting. The western line of the northern continent runs\r\n     north and south; the western line of the southern continent\r\n     north-west and south-east. The extreme northern end of the\r\n     northern continent is called _Terra de Cuba_. Along the\r\n     western shore are the words _Ultra mondv lustratum_. West of\r\n     the northern continent lie the large island of _Zipangri_ and\r\n     a multitude of islets. The north Pacific is called _Orientalis\r\n     Oceanus_. Cortés' chart of the Gulf of Mexico, 1520, is a\r\n     rough draft of oval shape with several names along the coast,\r\n     many of which are obsolete. Yucatan is represented as an\r\n     island. In 1860 J. G. Kohl published at Weimar a dissertation\r\n     on two of the oldest general maps of America, with the origin\r\n     of the names on each. The maps were those of Fernando Colon,\r\n     1527, and Diego Ribero, 1529, then in the grand-ducal library\r\n     at Weimar. The text accompanying these fac-similes is entitled\r\n     _Die Beiden Ältesten General-Karten von Amerika_. _Ausgeführt\r\n     in den Jahren 1527 und 1529, auf Befehl Kaiser Karl's V._ The\r\n     maps being full of names, concerning many of which there has\r\n     been much discussion, 185 royal folio pages are devoted to\r\n     their explanation. Beside a critical review of nomenclature\r\n     is given much information, both geographical and historical.\r\n     Colon's map shows the eastern coasts of North and South\r\n     America, and the southern shores of the Isthmus and Central\r\n     America to about Nicaragua. Ribero's map contains more names\r\n     than Colon's, and a section of the Peruvian coast; otherwise\r\n     they are not unlike. Continuing the present list we have all\r\n     of South America, and part of North America, given in 1527\r\n     by Robert Thorne; and the western side of the New World in\r\n     1528 by Bordone. Ptolemy, in _Munster_, _Cosmography_, 1530,\r\n     gives the two Americas entirely surrounded by water, with\r\n     Yucatan an island; in the interior of Mexico _Chamaho_, and\r\n     _Temistitan_; and near Zipangu _Archipelagus 7448 insularum_,\r\n     counted in all probability specially for this map. Orontius\r\n     Fine's globe, 1531, unites the southern continent, which it\r\n     calls America, by the isthmus _dariena_ to the northern,\r\n     which extends toward the north-west across the ocean and\r\n     forms part of Asia, with a continuous coast line to Japan.\r\n     The Atlantic is _Alanticum_, and the Pacific _Mar del Sur_.\r\n     Yucatan is an island. It is difficult to tell where Mexico\r\n     ends and Asia begins. _Temistitan_ is just south of _Catay_,\r\n     and Mexican and Asiatic names promiscuously occur. Grynæus,\r\n     in 1532, gives America in two parts, divided by a strait at\r\n     the Isthmus; the western end of the northern continent is\r\n     called _Terra de Cuba_. Map vi., _Munich Atlas_, 1532-40,\r\n     shows the Pacific coast from Peru to California, which is\r\n     represented as a peninsula. The gulf of California is called\r\n     the Red Sea. Yucatan is an island. Baptista Agnese, 1536,\r\n     gives North America in the shape of a horseshoe, with Yucatan\r\n     an island. Map vii., _Munich Atlas_, is supposed to be by\r\n     Baptista Agnese, 1540-50. It shows the whole of the Atlantic\r\n     coast, and the Pacific coast from Peru to Mexico. Ramusio,\r\n     _Viaggi_, iii. fol. 455-56, 1565, lays down about half the\r\n     Pacific coast. Maps ix. x. and xii., _Munich Atlas_, are\r\n     supposed to have been drawn by Vaz Dourado in 1571. The first\r\n     delineates South America, and a small part of the Isthmus;\r\n     the second both shores of Central America, and the Gulf\r\n     of Mexico; the third the Pacific coast only from Mexico to\r\n     Anian Strait. On map x. is a large lake north of Mexico, in\r\n     latitude 40° to 43°, and under it in large letters, _Bimenii\r\n     Regio_. Gerard Mercator, _Atlas sive cosmographicæ_, 1569, and\r\n     another edition 1574, represents the world on two globes, and\r\n     surrounds the two Americas with water, beside capping either\r\n     pole with a huge continent. In the north-eastern corner of\r\n     Asia, map iv., is _Americæ pars_. There are also _Anian reg_,\r\n     _Quiuira reg_, _Tuchano_, a city, and _El freto de Anian_.\r\n     On map v. the strait of Magellan separates the southern\r\n     continent from another large continent to the south of it,\r\n     on which is placed _Terra del fuego_. Luckily this antarctic\r\n     polar continent is labeled _Terra Avstralis nondvm cognita_,\r\n     lest the author be embarrassed by questions about it. After\r\n     well passing the strait of Magellan, _El Mar Pacifico_ is\r\n     entered, though as the tropics are reached it becomes _Mar\r\n     del Zur_. The northern part of this map v., the two Americas,\r\n     is quite interesting, and will be explained elsewhere. This\r\n     cartographical monstrosity Michael Lock, _Hakluyt's Divers\r\n     Voy._, 1582, endeavored, and with very fair success, to\r\n     exceed. Map xiii., _Munich Atlas_, by Thomas Hood, 1592, gives\r\n     the Gulf of Mexico, the Islands, and the eastern coast of\r\n     North America. In _Drake's World Encompassed_, 1595, another\r\n     source of information not remarkable for reliability, Hondius\r\n     traces the western coast to Bering Strait. Hondius' map, 1625,\r\n     in _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, iv. 857, gives North America to\r\n     the mythical strait of Anian. Ioanne de Laet, _Novvs Orbis_,\r\n     1633, has at p. 220 a map of _Nveva España_, _Nveva Galicia_,\r\n     and _Gvatimala_, and at p. 346 a map of _Tierra Firma_. A\r\n     map of the world in the atlas of Jacob Colom, 1663, will\r\n     require mention hereafter. _Ogilby's America_, 1671, gives\r\n     the northern continent to Anian Strait with _Nova Albion_ in\r\n     the northern part, and California as an island; and a map at\r\n     p. 222 shows parts of Mexico and Central America. There is\r\n     a map of the middle part of America in _Dampier's Voyages_,\r\n     i. 44, 1699. Beside these, I shall have occasion to mention\r\n     others, such as the maps in the _Buccaniers of America_, 1704;\r\n     _Funnell's Voyage_, 1707; the Dutch collection of voyages\r\n     by Pieter Van der Aa; the German collection of Gottfried;\r\n     _Voyages de François Coreal_, 1722; _Anson's Voyage_, 1756;\r\n     _Morden's Geography Rectified_, 1693; Harris, Harleian,\r\n     Oxford, Rogers, Shelvocke, Jefferys, and other collections\r\n     of voyages. I may also mention incidentally in this volume\r\n     maps and charts relating more especially to another part of\r\n     the Pacific States and described more fully in a succeeding\r\n     volume.\r\n\r\n     [IV-5] Cacique, lord of vassals, was the name by which the\r\n     natives of Cuba designated their chiefs. Learning this, the\r\n     conquerors applied the name generally to the rulers of wild\r\n     tribes, although in none of the dialects of the continent is\r\n     the word found. Peter Martyr says that 'in some places they\r\n     call a king Cacicus, in other places they call him Quebi, and\r\n     somewhere Tiba.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-6] 'Porque,' says Herrera, 'auia muchos arboles, cuya\r\n     fruta es vnas mançanillas buenas de comer.' Navarrete calls\r\n     the place _Punta Castilla y Puerto de Trujillo_, and the coast\r\n     _La Costa de Trujillo_. The name Honduras was applied first to\r\n     the cape and afterward to a long stretch of shore. Fernando\r\n     Colon, _Hist. Almirante_, 103, _Barcia_, i., gives 'Cabo de\r\n     Onduras.' In _Oviedo_, lib. iii. cap. ix., is written 'el cabo\r\n     de Higueras;' this chronicler also employs the word Honduras;\r\n     _Galvano's Discov._, 100, 'the Cape of Higueras, and vnto the\r\n     Islands Gamares, and to the Cape of Honduras, that is to say,\r\n     the Cape of the Depthes;' _Benzoni_, _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_, 28,\r\n     'Prouincia grande, che da' paesani è nominata Iguera, è da'\r\n     Spagnuoli Capo di Fonduri;' _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._, 31, 'cabo\r\n     de Higueras.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-7] Named by Columbus Rio de la Posesion, now known as Rio\r\n     Tinto.\r\n\r\n     [IV-8] For full descriptions of the several peoples inhabiting\r\n     this region at the coming of the Europeans, their physique,\r\n     character, customs, myths, and languages, I must refer the\r\n     reader to my _Native Races of the Pacific States_, 5 vols.,\r\n     passim.\r\n\r\n     [IV-9] This name has never changed. On Peter Martyr's _India\r\n     beyond the Ganges_, 1510, it is put down as _c. gr̃a de dios_;\r\n     Maiollo, 1519, writes _C de gratia dios_; Fernando Colon,\r\n     1527, _C. de gracias, á dios_; Ribero, 1529, _C∴ de grãc a\r\n     dios_; Maps vi. and vii., _Munich Atlas_, 1532-50, _C. de\r\n     gracia dios_; Vaz Dourado, _C∴ de grasias adios_; Mercator,\r\n     _C. de Gracias á Dios_; Dampier, _C. Gratia Dios_, etc.\r\n\r\n     [IV-10] Rio Escondido, or Bluefields, sometimes spelt\r\n     Blewfields, but erroneously. The name originated from the\r\n     Dutch pirate Bleeveldt. On map iv., _Munich Atlas_, in this\r\n     vicinity are found the words _R∴ del su._\r\n\r\n     [IV-11] Mercator places half-way between Cape Gracias á Dios\r\n     and Laguna de Chiriqui, _Quicuri_, designating a town. Peter\r\n     Martyr, dec. iii. cap. iv., says: 'He came to a region which\r\n     the inhabitants call Quicuris, in which is the hauen called\r\n     Cariari, named Mirobalanus by the Admirall, because the\r\n     Mirobalane trees are natiue in the regions thereabout.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-12] The name of the province also. Diego de Porras calls\r\n     it _Cariay_; Herrera and those who follow him write _Cariari_.\r\n     On the maps of Colon and Ribero, and also in Mercator's\r\n     atlas, the word is _Cariay_. On the map of Vaz Dourado in\r\n     this locality is written _masnoro_. 'Einige Geographen haben\r\n     geglaubt, dass unsere heutige \"Blewfields-Lagune\" dieser\r\n     Ankerplatz des Columbus sei. Andere haben dafür die Mündung\r\n     des grossen Flusses von Nicaragua den Rio San Juan genommen.'\r\n     _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten Karten_, 114-15.\r\n\r\n     [IV-13] 'En _Cariay_, y en esas tierras de su comarca,\r\n     son grandes fechiceros y muy medrosos.' _Carta de\r\n     Colon_, _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, i. 307. 'Nos parecian\r\n     à nosotros grandes hechiceros, i no sin alguna raçon, pues\r\n     quando se acercaban à los Christianos, esparcian, por el\r\n     aire cierto polvo à su buelta, i con perfumes, que hechaban\r\n     del polvo, hacian, que el humo fuese acía los Christianos.'\r\n     _Colon_, _Hist. Almirante_, 107, in _Barcia_, i.\r\n\r\n     [IV-14] Says Fernando Colon, _Hist. Almirante_, 108, in\r\n     _Barcia_, i., of this place:—'arribò al Canal de Zerabora, que\r\n     son 6 leguas de largo, i mas de tres de ancho, en el qual, ai\r\n     muchas Isletas, i tres, ò quatro Bocas mui à proposito para\r\n     entrar.' And Mr Kohl remarks, _Beiden ältesten Karten_, 115,\r\n     'Diese Schilderung passt auf kein anderes Gewässer südlich vom\r\n     San Juan 'Cariay,' als auf unsere 'Laguna de Chiriqui,' die\r\n     auch wohl noch heutiges Tages besonders in ihrer westlichen\r\n     Abtheilung 'Baia del Almirante' ... genannt wird.' Ribero\r\n     places _ysa de cerebaro_ in the laguna. Vaz Dourado writes\r\n     _Carabare_; Maiollo puts here somewhere _la casera bruxada_,\r\n     and near by _oro boro_. Mercator makes _Cerebaro_ a town.\r\n     Hondius, in _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, places in this\r\n     vicinity the town, _Quicari_. _West-Indische Spieghel_, 1624,\r\n     gives _Carabaro_, and a little to the north a town, _Quicura_.\r\n\r\n     [IV-15] Aboriginally the name of a town, province, and\r\n     river famous for gold. Later the name became historically\r\n     celebrated, being applied by the Spaniards to that whole\r\n     region, and given as a title to the descendants of Columbus,\r\n     who were called dukes of Veraguas. Peter Martyr, Colon, and\r\n     Ribero, all write _beragua_; Vaz Dourado, _baraga_; Ptolemy,\r\n     _Beragua_, as a province; Laet and Jefferys, _Veragua_. Porras\r\n     calls the province Cobraba.\r\n\r\n     [IV-16] Off Nombre de Dios on Vaz Dourado's map, is a group\r\n     called _I∴ de bastimẽtos_; in the _Novvs Orbis_ of Laet\r\n     they are _Yas de Bastimentos_; Jefferys calls them _los\r\n     Bastimentos_; Navarrete, _Col. de Viages_, i. 285, gives\r\n     _Puerto del Retrete_ in the text, and _Puerto Escribanos_ in\r\n     a note.\r\n\r\n     [IV-17] The locality of this little harbor was soon lost.\r\n     Herrera affirms that in his time its situation was uncertain,\r\n     some believing Nombre de Dios to be the place mentioned.\r\n     Peschel locates it near the town of Colon; Humboldt at Puerto\r\n     de Escribanos. Ribero places fifteen leagues west of Nombre de\r\n     Dios, _po retre_. Kohl says, _Beiden ältesten Karten_, 116:\r\n     'Er findet sich nicht auf N. Vallard (1547), nicht auf Dourado\r\n     (1580) und nicht auf den Karten vom Isthmus von Darien in\r\n     Herrera.' But it would seem from the description of Fernando\r\n     Colon, _Hist. Almirante_, 110, in _Barcia_, i., that the\r\n     place should be easily enough found. He says:—'entramos en vn\r\n     Puertecillo, que se llamò el _Retrete_, porque no cabian en èl\r\n     mas de 5 ò 6 Navios; su entrada era por vna boca de quince, ò\r\n     veinte pasos de ancho, i ambos lados eran Rocas, que salian del\r\n     Agua, como punta de Diamante, i era tan profundo de Canal,\r\n     por enmedio, que acercandose à la orilla, vn poco, se podia\r\n     saltar desde el Navio en Tierra.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-18] Although the authorities are somewhat vague and\r\n     conflicting as to the terminal point of the main-land\r\n     coastings of Bastidas, there is no doubt that the two\r\n     discoveries here united. Oviedo, ii. 334-36, and those copying\r\n     his errors, take Bastidas direct from Urabá to Jamaica; but\r\n     Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iii. 11, states:—'Salieron del golfo\r\n     de Urabá, y fueron la costa del Poniente abajo, y llegaron\r\n     al puerto que llamaron del Retrete, donde agora está la\r\n     ciudad y puerto que nombramos del Nombre de Dios.' Later,\r\n     in chapter xxiii. 123, he corrects himself in regard to El\r\n     Retrete and Nombre de Dios being the same place:—'Por esto\r\n     parece que el puerto del Retrete no es el que agora llamamos\r\n     del Nombre de Dios, como arriba dijimos por relacion de\r\n     otros, sino más adelante, hácia el Oriente.' Speaking of El\r\n     Retrete, Diego de Porras, _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, i.\r\n     285, remarks:—'En algunas cartas de navegar de algunos de los\r\n     marineros juntaba esta tierra con la que habian descubierto\r\n     Hojeda y Bastidas.' Navarrete himself, _Col. de Viages_, iii.\r\n     26, says of Bastidas, 'terminó su descubrimiento por los diez\r\n     grados de altura en el puerto del Retrete ó de Escribanos y\r\n     del nombre de Dios;' and again in a note concerning Nombre\r\n     de Dios:—'En este puerto entró posteriormente el Almirante\r\n     Colon el dia 26 de Noviembre de 1502 con noticia que ya tenia\r\n     de los descubrimientos de Bastidas.' Gomara, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     67, accredits Bastidas with the new discovery of 170 leagues\r\n     of coast, 'que ay del cabo de la Vela al golfo de Vraua, y\r\n     Farallones del Darien,' resting with Oviedo at that point.\r\n     From the evidence Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, i. 360, infers\r\n     that Bastidas continued 'vers l'ouest jusqu'au Puerto de\r\n     Retrete.' Loose statements are quite the habit now as of old;\r\n     instance that of Lerdo de Tejada, who says, _Apuntes Hist._,\r\n     89, referring to Bastidas, 'Y siguió hasta el puerto llamado\r\n     despues el _Retiro_, donde se fundó posteriormente el del\r\n     _Nombre de Dios_.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-19] That is to say, Bethlehem. Porras enters it _Y. n.\r\n     ebra_; Herrera, _Yebra_; and Fernando Colon, _Kiebra_. On\r\n     Ribero's map the name _bele_ is given to a lagoon; Vaz Dourado\r\n     writes _belen_; and Jacob Colom, _Belem_.\r\n\r\n     [IV-20] Although used by most Spanish and English writers\r\n     as a proper name, the word _quibian_ is an appellative, and\r\n     signifies the chief of a nation, or the ruler of a dynasty, as\r\n     the _cacique_ of the Cubans, the _inca_ of the Peruvians, the\r\n     _ahau_ of the Quichés, etc. Columbus, writing from Jamaica,\r\n     employs the term _el Quibian de Veragua_; and again, _Carta\r\n     de Colon_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, i. 302, 'Asenté\r\n     pueblo, y dí muchas dádivas al _Quibian_, que así llaman al\r\n     Señor de la tierra.' Napione and De Conti write _il Quibio o\r\n     cacico di Beragua_. See their _Biog. di Colombo_, 388:—\"Il\r\n     Prefetto andò colle barche al mare per entrare nel fiume e\r\n     portarsi alla popolazione del Quibio, cosi chiamato da quei\r\n     popoli il loro Re.'\r\n\r\n     [IV-21] Rio de la Concepcion.\r\n\r\n     [IV-22] Irving, _Columbus_, ii. 402, carelessly calls him 'the\r\n     chief notary,' confounding him with Diego de Porras, who was\r\n     notary of the expedition. The notary was not a fighting man,\r\n     but rather must withhold himself from action that he might\r\n     write down what was done by others.\r\n\r\n     [IV-23] 'Y como luego mandó prender al Cacique do se le fizo\r\n     mucho daño que le quemaron su poblacion, que era la mejor que\r\n     habia en la costa é de mejores casas, de muy buena madera,\r\n     todas cubiertas de fojas de palmas, é prendieron á sus fijos,\r\n     é aquí traen algunos dellos de que quedó toda aquella tierra\r\n     escandalizada, desto no sé dar cuenta sino que lo mandó\r\n     facer é aun apregonar escala franca.' _Diego de Porras_, in\r\n     _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, i. 286-7.\r\n\r\n     [IV-24] There are two accounts of this affair; one by Fernando\r\n     Colon, and one by Diego Mendez. Both are biased; the former\r\n     in favor of Bartolomé, the latter in favor of the writer.\r\n     Fernando tells how, when the settlement was taken by surprise,\r\n     his uncle seized a lance, and supported by seven men fought\r\n     with desperate valor until the main body of the Spaniards came\r\n     to his relief, when the enemy was routed. The other states,\r\n     _Relacion hecha por Diego Mendez_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, i. 317, that the admiral had just left the harbor,\r\n     accompanied by the larger part of the Spaniards, who had gone\r\n     to say farewell. Mendez, newly appointed contador, held the\r\n     town of Belen with twenty men. Suddenly four hundred Indians\r\n     appeared on the hill above, and sent upon the Spaniards a\r\n     shower of darts and arrows. Fortunately the yells were in\r\n     advance of the weapons, and thus time was given Mendez to\r\n     arm. The fight was desperate, and lasted three hours. Ten\r\n     natives who ventured to close with their war clubs were slain\r\n     by the sword. Seven of the twenty Christians were killed;\r\n     but a miracle at last gave victory to the remainder. During\r\n     the next four days, by the ingenuity of Mendez, and under his\r\n     direction, the effects of the colony were placed on shipboard,\r\n     and in return for his invaluable services he was made captain\r\n     of Tristan's ship.\r\n\r\n     [IV-25] The final burial-place, not only of Columbus, but of\r\n     his son Diego, and of his grandson Luis, was the cathedral\r\n     of Santo Domingo. For seven years after his death the\r\n     remains of Columbus lay in the convent of San Francisco at\r\n     Valladolid. Then they were removed to Seville and placed in\r\n     the monastery of Las Cuevas; and in 1536 were transferred to\r\n     Santo Domingo. When Española was ceded to France in 1795,\r\n     the Spanish naval commander asked permission to remove the\r\n     remains to Cuba, which was granted; and what were supposed\r\n     to be the remains were so removed midst pomp and ceremony in\r\n     December-January following. But later investigations, the\r\n     result of long-standing suspicions, satisfied many that a\r\n     blunder had been committed; and that the bones of Columbus\r\n     still rest at Santo Domingo. This has been proved beyond a\r\n     doubt by the recent researches of the distinguished French\r\n     savant and Americaniste A. Pinart.\r\n\r\n     [IV-26] I have remarked at some length on Fernando Colon's\r\n     life of his father, and on the letters of the admiral, and\r\n     other documents in Navarrete, Salvá and Baranda, Pacheco and\r\n     Cárdenas, and Mendoza, and elsewhere. The standard historians,\r\n     Las Casas, Oviedo, Peter Martyr, Gomara, and Herrera, I\r\n     will pass for the present, only remarking that each in his\r\n     own way tells the story of the admiral, and all must be\r\n     carefully considered in a study of his life and achievements.\r\n     Other early or important authorities are _Zorzi_, _Paesi\r\n     Nouamente retrouati_, Vicentia, 1507; _Ruchamer_, _Newe\r\n     unbekanthe landte_, Nuremberg, 1508; _Stamler_, _Dyalogvs_,\r\n     Augsburg, 1508; _Marineo_, _Obra Compuesta de las Cosas\r\n     Memorables e Claros Varones de España_, Alcala, 1530;\r\n     _Geraldini_, _Itinerarivm ad Regiones svb Æqvinoctiali_,\r\n     Rome, 1631; _Grynævs_, _Novvs Orbis Regionvm ac Insularvm\r\n     veteribvs incognitarvm_, Basle, 1532; _Maffei_, _Historiarum\r\n     indicarum_, Florence, 1588; _Gambaræ_, _De navigatione\r\n     Christophori Columbi_, Rome, 1585; _Charlevoix_, _Histoire de\r\n     l'Isle-Espagnole_, Paris, 1730; _Cladera_, _Investigaciones\r\n     historicas_, Madrid, 1794; _Bossi_, _Vita di Colombo_, Milan,\r\n     1818. _Die vierdte Reise so vollenbracht hat Christoffel\r\n     Columb_, at page 6 of _Löw_, _Meer oder Seehanen Buch_,\r\n     Cologne, 1598, should be read in reference with the maps,\r\n     to be appreciated.

The first work to throw a clear\r\n     light on the question of birthplace was the _Della patria di\r\n     Cristoforo Colombo_, by Conte Napione di Coconato, Florence,\r\n     1808, a dissertation published by the Academy of Sciences,\r\n     of Turin. In this and supplementary works the ability and\r\n     zeal of the author are manifest. In 1853, at Rome, was issued\r\n     a new edition of Napione and de Conti, entitled _Patria e\r\n     Biografia Del Grande Ammíraglio D. Cristóforo Colombo ...\r\n     rischiarita e comprovata dai celebri scrittori Gio. Francesco\r\n     Conte Napione di Coconato e Vincenzo de Conti_, the latter\r\n     author of _Storia del Monferrato_, in which appears a wealth\r\n     of new information second only to the original narratives\r\n     and documents themselves. The _Dissertazioni epistolari\r\n     bibliografiche_, Rome, 1809, of Francesco Cancellieri,\r\n     which Leclerc calls 'savante et fort curieuse,' should not\r\n     be overlooked. John S. C. Abbott throws together a _Life of\r\n     Christopher Columbus_, New York, 1875, in popular form, in\r\n     which extracts are conspicuous, the author having made quite\r\n     free with the writings of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n     [V-1] Chief judge, or highest judicial officer in the colony,\r\n     to take the place of Roldan, who was to be returned to Spain.\r\n     Irving, _Columbus_, ii. 331, writes erroneously _alguazil\r\n     mayor_, evidently confounding the two offices. For Las Casas,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iii. 18, says plainly enough:—'Trujo consigo por\r\n     Alcalde mayor un caballero de Salamanca y licenciado, llamado\r\n     Alonso Maldonado.' An alguacil mayor was a chief constable,\r\n     or high sheriff, a very different person from a chief judge.\r\n     These terms, and the offices represented by them, will be\r\n     fully explained in another place.\r\n\r\n     [V-2] As this word will often occur in these pages, and as\r\n     neither the term nor the institution it symbolizes has any\r\n     equivalent in English, I will enter here a full explanation.\r\n     _Residencia_ was the examination or account taken of the\r\n     official acts of an executive or judicial officer during\r\n     the term of his _residence_ within the province of his\r\n     jurisdiction, and while in the exercise of the functions of\r\n     his office. This was done at the expiration of the term of\r\n     office, or at stated periods, or in case of malefeasance at\r\n     any time. The person making the examination was appointed by\r\n     the king, or in New World affairs by the _Consejo de Indias_,\r\n     or by a viceroy, and was called a _juez de residencia_.\r\n     Before this judge, within a given time, any one might appear\r\n     and make complaint, and offer evidence against the retiring\r\n     or suspended official, who might refute and rebut as in an\r\n     ordinary tribunal. The residencia of any officer appointed by\r\n     the crown must be taken by a judge appointed by the crown; the\r\n     residencia of officers appointed in the Indies by viceroys,\r\n     audiencias, or president-governors, was taken by a judge\r\n     appointed by the same authority. Following are some of the\r\n     changes rung upon the subject by royal decrees, the better\r\n     to make it fit the government of the Indies. The 10th of\r\n     June, 1523, and again the 17th of November, 1526, Charles V.\r\n     decreed that appeal might be made from the judge of residencia\r\n     to the Council of the Indies, except in private demands not\r\n     exceeding 600 pesos de oro, when appeal was to the audiencia.\r\n     In 1530 viceroys and president-governors were directed to take\r\n     the residencia of _visitadores de Indios_ that wrong-doing\r\n     to the natives might not escape punishment; and by a later\r\n     law proclamations of residencias must be made in such manner\r\n     that the Indians might know thereof. The _Ordenanzas de\r\n     Audiencias_ of Philip II. of 1563 and 1567, state that in\r\n     some cities of the Indies it was customary to appoint at\r\n     certain seasons two regidores, who, with an alcalde, acted\r\n     as _fieles ejecutores_. At the beginning of every year the\r\n     viceroy, or the president, in a city which was the residence\r\n     of an audiencia, had to appoint an _oidor_ to take the\r\n     residencia of the fieles ejecutores of the previous year.\r\n     The same was to be done if those offices had been sold to\r\n     the city, _villa_, or _lugar_; but in such cases it was left\r\n     to the discretion of the viceroy or president to cause them\r\n     to be taken when necessary, not allowing them to become too\r\n     commonplace. Philip II. in 1573, and his successors as late\r\n     as 1680, directed that in residencias of governors and their\r\n     subordinates, when the fine did not exceed 20,000 maravedís,\r\n     execution should issue immediately; in damages granted from\r\n     private demands to the amount of 200 ducats, the condemned\r\n     was to give bonds to respond. While an official was undergoing\r\n     his residencia it was equivalent to his being under arrest, as\r\n     he could neither exercise office nor, except in certain cases\r\n     specified, leave the place. Thus the law of 1530, reiterated\r\n     in 1581, stated that from the time of the proclamation of a\r\n     residencia till its conclusion _alguaciles mayores_ and their\r\n     _tenientes_ should be suspended from carrying the _varas_,\r\n     or from exercising any of the functions of office. In 1583,\r\n     in 1620, and in 1680, it was ordered that such judges of\r\n     residencia as were appointed in the Indies should be selected\r\n     by a viceroy and audiencia, or by a president and audiencia,\r\n     acting in accord. Salaries of jueces de residencia were\r\n     ordered by Felipe III. in 1618 to be paid by the official\r\n     tried if found guilty, if not by the audiencia appointing.\r\n     Before this, in 1610, the same sovereign had ordered notaries\r\n     employed in residencias taken by _corregidores_ to be paid in\r\n     like manner. The next monarch directed that ships' officers\r\n     should be subject to residencia in the form of a _visita_;\r\n     and in visitas to _galeones_ and _flotas_ none but common\r\n     sailors, artillerymen, and soldiers should be exempt. Cárlos\r\n     II. in 1667 decreed that the residencia of a viceroy must\r\n     be terminated within six months from the publication of the\r\n     notice of the judge taking it. Felipe III. in 1619, and Cárlos\r\n     II. in 1680, ordered that viceroys and presidents should send\r\n     annually to the crown lists of persons suitable for conducting\r\n     residencias, so that no one might be chosen to act upon the\r\n     official under whose jurisdiction he resided. See _Recop.\r\n     de Indias_, ii. 176-89. Of the report of the residencia the\r\n     original was sent to the Council of the Indies, and a copy\r\n     deposited in the archives of the audiencia. So burdensome\r\n     were these trials, so corrupt became the judges, that later,\r\n     in America, the residencia seemed rather to defeat than to\r\n     promote justice, and in 1799 it was abolished so far as the\r\n     subordinate officers were concerned.\r\n\r\n     [V-3] Originally written _fijodalgo_, son of something.\r\n     Later applied to gentlemen, country gentlemen perhaps more\r\n     particularly. Oviedo, ii. 466, calls Diego de Nicuesa 'hombre\r\n     de limpia sangre de hijosdalgo,' a man of pure gentle blood.\r\n     Concerning the origin of the word _hidalgo_, Juan de la Puente\r\n     states that during the Moorish wars, whenever a large town was\r\n     captured the king kept it; the villages he gave to captains\r\n     who had distinguished themselves, and who were called at first\r\n     _ricos homes_, and afterward _grandes_. To minor meritorious\r\n     persons something less was given, a portion of the spoils or\r\n     a grant of land, but always something; hence their descendants\r\n     were called _fijosdalgos_, _hijosdalgos_, or _hidalgos_, sons\r\n     of something. In the _Dic. Univ._ authorities are quoted\r\n     showing that the word _hidalgo_ originated with the Roman\r\n     colonists of Spain, called _Itálicos_, who were exempt from\r\n     imposts. Hence those enjoying similar benefits were called\r\n     _Itálicos_, which word in lapse of time became _hidalgo_.\r\n\r\n     [V-4] 'Por justas causas, y consideraciones conviene, que\r\n     en todas las capitulaciones que se hicieron para nuevos\r\n     descubrimientos, se excuse esta palabra conquista, y en\r\n     su lugar se use de las de pacificacion y poblacion, pues\r\n     habiéndose de hacer con toda paz y caridad, es nuestra\r\n     voluntad, que aun este nombre interpretado contra nuestra\r\n     intencion, no ocasione, ni dé color á lo capitulado, para que\r\n     se pueda hacer fuerza ni agravio á los Indios.' _Recop. de\r\n     Indias_, ii. 2.\r\n\r\n     [V-5] The best proof of the policy of Spain in regard to\r\n     the natives of the New World is found in her laws upon the\r\n     subject. Writers may possibly color their assertions, but\r\n     by following the royal decrees through successive reigns\r\n     we have what cannot be controverted. The subject of the\r\n     treatment of the Indians occupies no inconsiderable space in\r\n     the _Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias_. At the beginning\r\n     of tit. x. lib. vi. is placed a clause of Isabella's will,\r\n     solemnly enjoining her successors to see that the Indians were\r\n     always equitably and kindly treated; and this was the text\r\n     for future legislation. And now let us glance at the laws; I\r\n     cannot give them all; but I can assure the reader they are of\r\n     one tenor. First of all the natives were to be protected by\r\n     the ecclesiastical and civil authorities. They might marry\r\n     freely, but always in accordance with Christian usage; must\r\n     not be taken to Spain; must be civilized, Christianized,\r\n     taught to speak Spanish, and to love labor, if possible; they\r\n     might sow seed, breed stock, keep their ancient market-days,\r\n     buy and sell at pleasure, and even dispose of their lands,\r\n     only the Spaniards were not allowed to sell them arms or\r\n     alcoholic liquors. The Inquisition could not touch them,\r\n     for in religious matters they were subject to the bishop's\r\n     jurisdiction, and in cases of witchcraft to the civil power.\r\n     They might have their municipal organizations in imitation of\r\n     the Spanish town government, with their alcaldes, fiscales,\r\n     and regidores, elected from among themselves to serve for one\r\n     year, elections to be held in the presence of the priest. It\r\n     was made the duty of priests, prelates, all officers of the\r\n     government, and in fact every Spanish subject, to watch over\r\n     and protect the Indians. Governors and judges were charged\r\n     under the severest penalties to see justice done them. Two\r\n     officers were created at an early day for this purpose, those\r\n     of _protector_ and _defensor_, the former having general\r\n     oversight of the natives and their interests, and the latter\r\n     appearing in their behalf in court. After a time, when it was\r\n     thought the aborigines could stand alone, the offices were\r\n     abolished. But the action was premature, and in 1589 Philip\r\n     II. ordered them revived. These officers were appointed by\r\n     the viceroys and president-governors. Indians might appear\r\n     in courts of law and have counsel assigned them free of any\r\n     cost; and even in suits between the natives themselves there\r\n     was to be no expense, the fiscal appearing on one side, and\r\n     the protector on the other. Philip also gave notice in 1593\r\n     that Spaniards who maltreated Indians were to be punished\r\n     with greater rigor than for badly treating a Spaniard. This\r\n     was a remarkable law; it is a pity the Puritans and their\r\n     descendants lacked such a one. Indians might be hired, but\r\n     they must be paid promptly. They might work in the mines, or\r\n     carry burdens if they chose, but it must be done voluntarily.\r\n     Enforced personal service, or any approach to it, was\r\n     jealously and repeatedly prohibited. Indians under eighteen\r\n     must not be employed to carry burdens. Let those who sneer\r\n     at Philip and Spain remember that two centuries after this\r\n     England could calmly look on and see her own little children,\r\n     six years of age, working with their mothers in coal-pits.\r\n     There were many ways the Spaniards had of evading the just and\r\n     humane laws of their monarchs—instance the trick of employers\r\n     of getting miners or other laborers in debt to them, and\r\n     keeping them so, and if they attempted to run away interpose\r\n     the law for their restraint. It was equivalent to slavery.\r\n     A native might even sell his labor for an indefinite time,\r\n     until Felipe III. in 1618 decreed that no Indian could bind\r\n     himself to work for more than one year. The law endeavored\r\n     to throw all severe labor upon the negro, who was supposed\r\n     to be better able to endure it. The black man was likewise\r\n     placed far below the red in the social scale. It was criminal\r\n     for a negro or mixed-breed to have an Indian work for him,\r\n     although voluntarily and for pay; nor might an African even\r\n     go to the house of an American. The law endeavored to guard\r\n     the Indian in his privacy, as well as in his rights. It\r\n     studied to make the lot of the aboriginal as peaceful and\r\n     comfortable under Christian civilization as under heathen\r\n     barbarism. More it could not do; it could not do this much;\r\n     after the pacifying raid through the primeval garden, all\r\n     Europe could not restore it. But Spain's monarchs did their\r\n     best to mitigate the sufferings caused by Spain's unruly\r\n     sons. The cacique might hold his place among his people,\r\n     and follow ancient usage in regard to his succession, but he\r\n     must not enslave them, or inflict upon them the ancient cruel\r\n     customs, such as giving Indian girls in lieu of tribute, or\r\n     burying servants with their dead masters. And these petty\r\n     rulers must stay at home and attend to their affairs; Indians\r\n     could not leave one pueblo to take up their residence in\r\n     another, and caciques could not go to Spain without special\r\n     license from the king. The natives were ordered to live in\r\n     communities, and have a fixed residence, and their lands were\r\n     not in consequence to be taken from them. They must not ride\r\n     on horseback, for that would make them too nearly equal to\r\n     the cavalier in battle; they must not hold dances without\r\n     permission, for then they might plot conspiracies, or give\r\n     themselves up to serve heathen gods as of old; they must not\r\n     work in gold or silver, an illiberal restriction which lost to\r\n     the world the finest of America's arts. Spaniards could not\r\n     place a cattle rancho within 1½ leagues of a native pueblo;\r\n     or swine, sheep, or goats within half a league; the Indians\r\n     might lawfully kill cattle trespassing on their lands. In a\r\n     pueblo of Indians neither Spaniard, nor mulatto, nor negro\r\n     should live. No traveller might spend the night at the house\r\n     of a native if an inn was at hand. No Spanish or mestizo\r\n     merchant might remain in an Indian pueblo more than three\r\n     days, nor another white man more than two days. Beside the\r\n     property of individuals each Indian pueblo had some common\r\n     property, and a strong-box in which the community money and\r\n     title-deeds were kept. Caciques must not call themselves lords\r\n     of pueblos, as that detracted from royal preëminence; they\r\n     must be called caciques simply. The cacique must not attempt\r\n     feudal fashions; he must not oppress his people, or take\r\n     more than the stipulated tribute; and he who worked for the\r\n     cacique must be paid by the cacique. In criminal matters the\r\n     jurisdiction of caciques over their people could not extend to\r\n     death or mutilation. On the other hand a cacique could not be\r\n     tried by the ordinary Spanish justice of the peace, but only\r\n     by the judge of a district. The last four laws were made by\r\n     Charles V. in 1538. And beside these were many other edicts\r\n     promulgated by the Spanish monarchs during two and a half\r\n     centuries, notable for their wisdom, energy, and humanity. By\r\n     the continued outrages and excesses of their subjects in the\r\n     New World the temper of the crown was often severely tried.\r\n     Thus was found written by Felipe IV. with his own hand, on a\r\n     decree of the council ordering the immediate suppression of\r\n     all those infamous evils practised in spite of laws against\r\n     them, a sentiment which was fully reiterated by his son Cárlos\r\n     II. in 1680:—'I will that you give satisfaction to me and to\r\n     the world concerning the manner of treating those my vassals,'\r\n     so reads the writing; 'and if this be not done, so that as in\r\n     response to this letter I may see exemplary punishment meted\r\n     offenders, I shall hold myself disobeyed; and be assured that\r\n     if you do not remedy it, I will. The least omissions I shall\r\n     consider grave crimes against God and against me; the evil\r\n     conduct tending as it does to the total ruin and destruction\r\n     of those realms whose natives I hold in estimation; and I will\r\n     that they be treated as is merited by vassals who serve the\r\n     monarchy so well, and have so contributed to its grandeur and\r\n     enlightenment.'

The Spanish pound is a little more\r\n     than the English pound. There are four arrobas in a quintal.\r\n\r\n     [V-7] _Repartimiento_, a distribution; _repartir_, to divide;\r\n     _encomienda_, a charge, a commandery; _encomendar_, to give in\r\n     charge; _encomendero_, he who holds an encomienda. In Spain\r\n     an encomienda, as here understood, was a dignity in the four\r\n     military orders, endowed with a rental, and held by certain\r\n     members of the order. It was acquired through the liberality\r\n     of the crown as a reward for services in the wars against\r\n     the Moors. The lands taken from the Infidels were divided\r\n     among Christian commanders; the inhabitants of those lands\r\n     were crown tenants, and life-rights to their services were\r\n     given these commanders. In the legislation of the Indies,\r\n     encomienda was the patronage conferred by royal favor over\r\n     a portion of the natives, coupled with the obligation to\r\n     teach them the doctrines of the Church, and to defend their\r\n     persons and property. It was originally intended that the\r\n     recipients of these favors were to be the discoverers,\r\n     conquerors, meritorious settlers, and their descendants; but\r\n     in this as in many other respects the wishes of the monarchs\r\n     and their advisers did not always reach the mark. The system\r\n     begun in the New World by Columbus, Bobadilla, and Ovando was\r\n     continued by Vasco Nuñez, Pedrarias, Cortés, and Pizarro, and\r\n     finally became general. Royal decrees upon the subject, which\r\n     seemed to grow more and more intricate as new possessions\r\n     were pacified, began with a law by Ferdinand the Catholic in\r\n     1509, reiterated by Philip II. in 1580, to the effect that\r\n     immediately upon the pacification of a province the governor\r\n     should divide the natives among the settlers. The natives thus\r\n     distributed were held for a term of years, or during the life\r\n     of the holder, or for two or more lives—that is, during the\r\n     life of the first holder, and that of his heir, and perhaps\r\n     that of his heir's heir, or until the king should otherwise\r\n     decree. _Solorzano_, _De Indiarum Jure_, ii. lib. ii. cap. i.;\r\n     _Acosta_, _De Procur. Ind._, iii. cap. x. When by this course\r\n     three fourths of certain populations had been 'recommended' to\r\n     their death, at the representation of Las Casas, the king in\r\n     1523 decreed that 'as God our lord had made the Indians free,'\r\n     they must not be enslaved on this or any other pretext; 'and\r\n     therefore we command that it be done no more, and that those\r\n     already distributed be set at liberty.' _Remesal_, _Hist.\r\n     Chyapa_, 10. But by this abolition the destruction of the\r\n     colonies was threatened. Petition followed petition for the\r\n     restoration of the system, until the king finally yielded.\r\n     _Solorzano_, _Política Indiana_, i. 225. In 1542 encomiendas\r\n     were again abolished, and again the king was obliged to\r\n     restore them. Meanwhile every effort possible was made by the\r\n     crown to prevent abuses. The encomendero must fulfil in person\r\n     the intention of the law. He must not leave without permission\r\n     from the governor, and then his duties must be delegated to a\r\n     responsible agent. If away for four months without permission,\r\n     his encomienda was to be declared vacant. The encomendero must\r\n     not hire out any natives, or pledge them to creditors, under\r\n     penalty of loss of Indians and a fine of 50,000 maravedís.\r\n     No one could appropriate any natives except those legally\r\n     assigned. When it was seen how those in office misused their\r\n     power, in 1530, in 1532, in 1542, in 1551, and in 1563 all\r\n     civil and ecclesiastical functionaries were forbidden to\r\n     hold encomiendas; but in 1544 Philip II. excepted from this\r\n     prohibition _tenientes de gobernadores_, _corregidores_, and\r\n     _alcaldes mayores de pueblos_. Indians should not be given in\r\n     encomienda to the daughters of royal officials, or to sons\r\n     unless married. It was just and reasonable that the savages\r\n     should pay the Spaniards tribute, for so God had appointed, so\r\n     the pope had ordained, and the king had commanded; but it was\r\n     the collection of this tribute only, and not the deprivation\r\n     of liberty, or of any personal rights, that the encomienda\r\n     was intended to cover. And for this tax, which whosoever\r\n     enjoys the boon of civilization must surely pay, the vassal\r\n     was to receive protection, and the still more blessed boon of\r\n     Christianity. Nor must this impost under any consideration be\r\n     made burdensome.\r\n\r\n     The manner of making assessments was minutely defined by\r\n     edicts of Charles V. at divers dates from 1528 to 1555, and\r\n     of Philip II. from the beginning to the end of his reign.\r\n     In substance they were as follows. The king made responsible\r\n     to him the viceroys, and the presidents and audiencias, who,\r\n     by the aid of a commissioner and assessors, fixed the rates\r\n     in their respective districts. The assessors having first\r\n     heard a solemn mass of the Holy Ghost, in order to enlighten\r\n     their understanding that they might justly regard the value\r\n     of the rental and equitably determine the rate, they were to\r\n     swear with all solemnity before the priest this to do without\r\n     bias. They were personally to inspect all the pueblos of the\r\n     province, noting the number of settlers and natives in each\r\n     pueblo, and the quality of the land. They were to ascertain\r\n     what the natives had originally paid to their caciques as\r\n     tribute, and never make the new rate higher, but always lower,\r\n     than the old one. For surely they should not be worse off in\r\n     serving Spain than in serving their heathen lords. After thus\r\n     carefully examining the resources and capabilities of the\r\n     tributaries, and never infringing on the comfort of the women\r\n     and children, the assessors should fix the rate according to\r\n     God and their conscience. The natives might pay in money if\r\n     they preferred, but payment should be required only in kind,\r\n     in whatever produce grew on their lands. They must not be\r\n     required to raise anything specially for this purpose; and\r\n     from not over two or three kinds of produce should tribute be\r\n     taken; a few chickens, or a pig or two, need not be counted\r\n     at all. It was the intention of the monarchs that from a tenth\r\n     to a fifth might in this way be taken, though the encomendero\r\n     too often managed to get twice or thrice as much, or all\r\n     the natives had. The Indians must be made to understand how\r\n     the appraisement was made, and that it was not done in the\r\n     interests of the Spaniards alone. Then the assessor must put\r\n     in writing what each had to pay, and leave the original with\r\n     the cacique, giving one copy to the encomendero, and sending\r\n     one to the Council of the Indies, or to the viceroy, or to\r\n     the audiencia. For the encomendero to practise extortion,\r\n     or demand more than the schedule called for, there were\r\n     pronounced the severest penalties, even to the loss of the\r\n     encomienda and half his goods. Natives voluntarily coming\r\n     forward and entering in encomienda were excused from paying\r\n     tribute for ten years; and, in any event, for the first two\r\n     years after congregating in pueblos but one half the usual\r\n     tribute could be legally exacted. Males were taxed after the\r\n     eighteenth year; caciques, elder sons, women, and alcaldes\r\n     in office were exempt. After the gift, the encomienda was the\r\n     property of the encomendero, not to be taken from him before\r\n     the expiration of his term without cause. In every encomienda\r\n     there must be a church, and where there was none, the natives\r\n     must be stimulated to build one, the priest to be paid out\r\n     of the rental. In every pueblo of 100 or more natives, two\r\n     or three must be taught to sing, so that they might act as\r\n     choristers; also a native sacristan—these to be exempt from\r\n     tribute. In 1568 Philip II. ordered that no encomendero\r\n     should receive a rental of over 2000 pesos; any excess was to\r\n     be returned to the crown and employed as pensions. The same\r\n     monarch directed in 1573 that when an encomienda fell vacant,\r\n     a viceroy or governor might, if he deemed best, appropriate\r\n     the rental to benevolent objects, and defer granting it again\r\n     till the king's pleasure should be known. And again, in 1583,\r\n     that the encomendero must have a house of his own, built of\r\n     stone for purposes of defence, in the city of his residence;\r\n     and he must keep his family there. He should maintain no house\r\n     in the town of the Indians, nor should he have any building\r\n     there except a granary. In 1592 it was decreed that Indians in\r\n     encomienda could be given to none but residents in the Indies.\r\n     When an encomienda became vacant, so it was decreed in 1594\r\n     and subsequently, the fact was advertised for from twenty to\r\n     thirty days, during which time applicants might prefer their\r\n     respective claims, and recite services rendered the crown by\r\n     themselves or their ancestors. Preference was always to be\r\n     given to the descendants of discoverers and settlers. Two or\r\n     three small encomiendas might sometimes be joined in one. And\r\n     never might religious training be forgotten; when the rental\r\n     was not sufficient for the support of the encomendero and\r\n     the instructor, the latter must have the revenue. Felipe III.\r\n     in 1602, 1611, 1616, 1618, and 1620, decreed that as a rule\r\n     but one encomienda could be held by one person; still more\r\n     seldom could one be given up and another taken. There was to\r\n     be no such thing as commerce in them. They were a trust. Much\r\n     evil had arisen from dividing encomiendas, and it should be\r\n     done no more. Felipe IV. in 1655 ordered that governors under\r\n     royal commission and those named by the viceroy _ad interim_\r\n     might give Indians in encomienda, but _alcaldes ordinarios_\r\n     holding temporarily the office of governor were not allowed\r\n     this privilege. _Recop. de Indias_, ii. 249-284 and passim.\r\n     Finally, toward the close of the seventeenth century, the\r\n     monarchs, becoming more and more straitened in their need of\r\n     money, ordered that encomenderos should pay a portion of their\r\n     revenue to the crown; then a larger portion was demanded; and\r\n     then the whole of it. In 1721 the system came to an end. But\r\n     after endeavoring for two hundred years to get back what they\r\n     had given away, the monarchs found there was nothing left\r\n     of it, the natives having by this time merged with sometimes\r\n     slightly whitened skins into the civilized pueblos.\r\n\r\n     [V-8] It was decreed by the emperor in 1555 that the _Casa de\r\n     Contratacion_ should have an _arca de tres llaves_, a chest\r\n     of three keys; after which the government strong-box became\r\n     common in Spanish America. It was usually in the form of a\r\n     sailor's chest, of heavy wood bound with brass or iron, and\r\n     having three locks fastening the lid by hasps. The strong-box\r\n     of the India House, the law goes on to say, must remain in\r\n     the custody of the treasurer, who was responsible for its\r\n     safe keeping. One of the keys was held by the _tesorero_,\r\n     one by the _contador_, and one by the _factor_. Out of the\r\n     hand of any one of these three royal officers his key could\r\n     not lawfully go; and no one but they might put into the chest\r\n     or take out of it any thing, under penalty, on the official\r\n     permitting it, of four times the value of the things so\r\n     handled. In this box were kept, temporarily, all gold, silver,\r\n     pearls, and precious stones that came from the Indies on the\r\n     king's account, or were recovered for him by suits at law\r\n     brought before the India House in Spain. _Recop. de Indias_,\r\n     iii. 17.\r\n\r\n     [V-9] Oviedo, i. 103, says that when the Jeronimite friars\r\n     arrived a few days before Christmas, 1516, the _jueces de\r\n     apelacion_ 'ya se llamaban oydores, é su auditorio ya se\r\n     deçia audiençia Real.' Herrera, ii. ii. iv., treating of\r\n     the instructions given the Jeronimites remarks, that it was\r\n     ordered also that the jueces de apelacion should be submitted\r\n     to residencia. After that he writes jueces de apelacion,\r\n     and audiencia indifferently. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, v. 45,\r\n     treating of events in 1518-20, says 'jueces de apelacion;'\r\n     relating the occurrences of 1521, 165, 177, he writes\r\n     'audiencia,' and 'cuatro oidores.' Writing the king August\r\n     30, 1520, _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 332-48,\r\n     the court styles itself _Real Audiencia_, the members signing\r\n     the communication. In _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     xiv. 568, the presidents of this audiencia are given as Luis\r\n     de Figueroa, 1523; Sebastian Ramirez in 1527; Fuente Mayor in\r\n     1533; Maldonado in 1552; Alonso Arias de Herrera in 1560; and\r\n     in 1566 Diego de Vera, who was sent to Panamá as president\r\n     when he was succeeded by Doctor Mejía.\r\n\r\n     [V-10] The word _audiencia_, from _audire_, to hear, has a\r\n     variety of significations in Spanish; meaning, namely, the\r\n     act of hearing, the tribunal, the courtroom and building,\r\n     and finally, jurisdiction. _Oidor_, he who hears, comes from\r\n     the same root, but is now applied only to the magistrate\r\n     of an audiencia. The more important general laws governing\r\n     audiencias in the New World were the following. In 1528 the\r\n     emperor ordered, and the decree was reiterated in 1548, 1569,\r\n     1575, and 1589, that each audiencia should make a tariff of\r\n     fees of notaries and other officers, which must not exceed\r\n     five times those in Spain. In 1530 the mandates of this\r\n     tribunal were made of equal force with those of the king\r\n     himself. Should any one demand it, decisions in civil suits\r\n     were to be rendered in one case before another was begun;\r\n     suits of poor persons always to have preference in time of\r\n     hearing. Even dissenting judges must sign the decision, making\r\n     it unanimous. On the first business day of each year, all\r\n     the members and officers being present, the laws governing\r\n     audiencias should be read. In 1541 the emperor ordered that\r\n     in 'first instance' alcaldes, regidores, alguaciles mayores,\r\n     and escribanos should not be brought before the audiencia;\r\n     in each pueblo one alcalde should have cognizance of what\r\n     affected the other, and both of matters concerning its other\r\n     officers. In 1540, and many times thereafter, the audiencia\r\n     was charged to look to the welfare of the natives, to watch\r\n     narrowly the conduct of governors and other officials, and\r\n     to punish excesses. While in October, 1545, the emperor was\r\n     at Malines, hence known as the law of Malinas, directions\r\n     were given for procedure in cases of claims of Indians.\r\n     _Menor cuantía_ in suits was fixed at 300,000 maravedís; not\r\n     exceeding this amount two oidores might decide; also in suits\r\n     of _mayor cuantía_, except at Lima and Mexico where three\r\n     votes were necessary as in Spanish law. It was ordered in\r\n     1548 that audiencias must not meddle with questions of rank\r\n     and precedence. In 1551, Saturdays and two other days in the\r\n     week were set aside, there being no suits of poor persons,\r\n     for hearing disputes between Indians, and between Indians\r\n     and Spaniards. More _casos de corte_, that is important\r\n     suits taken from lower courts, were not to be admitted by an\r\n     audiencia of the Indies than was customary in Spain. This\r\n     was in 1552, and repeated in 1572. In 1553 it was ordered\r\n     that any person having a grievance against a president or\r\n     viceroy might appeal to the audiencia, the accused officer\r\n     being forbidden to preside at such times. If the president\r\n     was a bishop he was not permitted to adjudicate in matters\r\n     ecclesiastic. Six years later all petitions presented were\r\n     to be admitted. Philip II. in 1561 ordered that suits of the\r\n     royal treasury should have precedence over all others. The\r\n     year 1563 was prolific in regulations for the audiencia.\r\n     Where the president of an audiencia was governor and\r\n     captain-general, the tribunal should not meddle in matters\r\n     of war, unless the president was absent, or unless specially\r\n     directed by the crown. In the city where the audiencia is\r\n     held there must be an Audiencia House, and the president must\r\n     live there, and keep there the royal seal, the registry, the\r\n     jail, and the mint; in this house must be a striking clock;\r\n     and if there be no such building provided, the residence of\r\n     the president shall in the mean time be so used. On every day\r\n     not a feast-day the audiencia must sit at least three hours,\r\n     beginning at 7 A. M. in summer, and 8 A. M. in winter, and\r\n     at least three oidores must be present. Audiencias must not\r\n     annul sentences of exile; or, unless bonds for payment are\r\n     given, grant letters of delay to condemned treasury debtors.\r\n     The majority decide. The governor, alcalde mayor, or other\r\n     person refusing obedience to any mandate of the tribunal must\r\n     be visited by a judge and punished. In exceptional cases only\r\n     the audiencia might touch the royal treasury. Each audiencia\r\n     must keep a book in which was to be recorded—where the\r\n     amount in question was over 100,000 maravedís, or, in other\r\n     important cases—the verdict of each oidor; and the president\r\n     must swear to keep secret the contents of this book unless\r\n     ordered by the king to divulge the same. A book should also\r\n     be kept in which was to be entered anything affecting the\r\n     treasury; and another the fines imposed. Audiencias could\r\n     appoint only to certain offices. Philip II. further ordered\r\n     during the subsequent years of his reign, that audiencias must\r\n     keep secret the instructions from the crown; that they must\r\n     not interfere with the lower courts, or with the courts of\r\n     ecclesiastics, except in cases provided by law, but rather aid\r\n     them; that they should register the names of persons coming\r\n     from Spain, with their New World address; that with such\r\n     matters as residencias, compelling married men to live with\r\n     their wives, and the estates of deceased persons, presidents\r\n     and viceroys should not intermeddle, but leave them to the\r\n     other members; that they should use no funds resulting from\r\n     their judgments, but draw on the treasury for expenses; that\r\n     when an audiencia was to be closed, a governor should be\r\n     appointed with power to continue and determine pending suits,\r\n     but he should institute no new suits, and appeals lie to\r\n     the nearest audiencia; that they should not make public the\r\n     frailties of ecclesiastics, but examine charges against them\r\n     in secret; that royal despatches for the audiencia must not\r\n     be opened by the president alone, but at an _acuerdo_, and in\r\n     presence of the oidores and fiscal, and if thought necessary\r\n     the _escribano de cámara_ must be present; and that they\r\n     must not remit to the Council of the Indies trivial matters\r\n     for decision. In subsequent reigns during the seventeenth\r\n     century it was at various times decreed that a president might\r\n     impeach an oidor before the Council of the Indies, though he\r\n     could not send him to Spain, but no oidor might impeach his\r\n     president except by royal command; that audiencias should\r\n     exercise their functions in love and temperance, especially\r\n     during a vacancy in the office of president or viceroy; that\r\n     in their visits to the jail the oidores should not entertain\r\n     petitions of those condemned to death by the ordinary justices\r\n     in consultation with the criminal section of the audiencia,\r\n     nor should they on such visits take cognizance of anything not\r\n     specially confided to them; that they should not legitimize\r\n     natural children, but refer such cases to the Council of\r\n     the Indies; that each year the president should designate an\r\n     oidor to oversee the officers and attachés and punish their\r\n     faults; that no favoritism should be shown appointees of\r\n     viceroys or presidents; one oidor might transact business,\r\n     if the audiencia were reduced to that extremity; in arriving\r\n     at a decision the junior member should vote first, then the\r\n     next youngest, and so on up to the senior member. This from\r\n     the _Recopilacion de las Indias_, i. 323-70. In the _Politica\r\n     Indiana_ of Solorzano, ii. 271-82, may be found how the\r\n     audiencias of America differed from those of Spain. Larger\r\n     powers were given the former by reason of their distance from\r\n     the throne. They were given jurisdiction in the residencias of\r\n     the inferior judiciary; they could commission _pesquisidores_,\r\n     or special judges, and order execution to issue where an\r\n     inferior judge had neglected to do so. They had cognizance\r\n     in matters of tithes, of royal patronage, patrimony, treasury\r\n     matters, and jurisdiction; they could even fix the fee-bill of\r\n     the ecclesiastical tribunals, settle the estates of bishops,\r\n     retain apostolic bulls which they deemed prejudicial to the\r\n     royal patronage, and they could watch and regulate the conduct\r\n     of all ecclesiastical officials. In making appointments the\r\n     viceroy was obliged to take the opinion of the audiencia.\r\n     Persons aggrieved might appeal from the viceroy to the\r\n     audiencia. On the death, absence, or inability of the viceroy\r\n     the senior oidor stood in his place. None of these powers\r\n     were given audiencias in Spain. This and kindred subjects\r\n     are treated at great length by Solórzano y Pereira, who was\r\n     a noted Spanish jurist, born at Madrid in 1575. He studied at\r\n     Salamanca, and in 1609 was appointed by Felipe III. oidor of\r\n     the audiencia of Lima. Later he became fiscal and councillor\r\n     in the _Consejo de Hacienda_, the _Consejo de Indias_, and\r\n     the _Consejo de Castilla_. He published several works on\r\n     jurisprudence, the most conspicuous being _Disquisitiones\r\n     de Indiarum jure_, 2 vols, folio, Madrid, 1629-39. It was\r\n     reprinted in 1777, an edition meanwhile appearing in Lyons in\r\n     1672. A Spanish translation by Valenzuela was published at\r\n     Madrid in 1648, and reprinted in 1776. I have used both the\r\n     Latin edition and the Spanish, but the latter is preferable.\r\n\r\n     The work is a commentary on the laws of the Indies,\r\n     wonderfully concise for a Spanish lawyer of that period, and\r\n     was of great utility at a time when those laws were in chaotic\r\n     condition.\r\n\r\n     To conclude my remarks on audiencias in America I will only\r\n     say that ultimately their number was eleven; and one at\r\n     Manila, which, like that of Santo Domingo, had a president,\r\n     oidores, and a fiscal, and exercised executive as well as\r\n     judicial functions. The eleven, including that of Santo\r\n     Domingo, were those of Mexico and Lima, each being presided\r\n     over by a viceroy, and having 8 oidores, 4 alcaldes del\r\n     crímen, and 2 fiscales; and those of Guatemala, Guadalajara,\r\n     Panamá, Chile, La Plata, Quito, Santa Fé, and Buenos Ayres.\r\n     These several audiencias were formed at different times\r\n     soon after the establishing of government in the respective\r\n     places. See further, _Montemayor_, _Svmarios_, 110-11; _Revue\r\n     Américaine_, i. 3-32; _Zamora y Coronado_, _Biblioteca de\r\n     Legislacion Ultramarina_, passim.\r\n\r\n     [V-11] Irving says 1510. I cannot undertake to correct all the\r\n     minor errors of popular writers, having neither the space nor\r\n     the inclination. It would seem that in the present, and like\r\n     instances, of which there are many, the mistake springs from\r\n     an easy carelessness which regards the difference of a year\r\n     or two in the date of the settlement of an island as of no\r\n     consequence; for Las Casas, and other authorities who agree\r\n     better than usual in this case, were before Mr Irving at the\r\n     time he entered in his manuscript the wrong date. Important\r\n     and sometimes even unimportant discrepancies of original or\r\n     standard authorities will always be carefully noted in these\r\n     pages. What I shall endeavor to avoid is captious criticism,\r\n     and the pointing out of insignificant errors merely for the\r\n     satisfaction of proving others in the wrong.\r\n\r\n     [V-12] Maria, widow of Diego, demanded of the audiencia of\r\n     Santo Domingo for her son Luis, then six years of age, the\r\n     viceroyalty of Veragua, which was refused. She then carried\r\n     her claim to Spain, where the title of admiral was conferred\r\n     on Luis, and many other benefits were extended by the\r\n     emperor to the family, but the title of viceroy was withheld.\r\n     Subsequently Luis, having instituted court proceedings which\r\n     were referred to an arbitration, succeeded in having himself\r\n     declared captain-general of Española. Shortly before his\r\n     death he relinquished the claim to the viceroyalty of the\r\n     New World for the titles of duke of Veraguas and marquis\r\n     of Jamaica, and gave his right to a tenth of the produce of\r\n     the Indies for a pension of a thousand doubloons. Luis was\r\n     succeeded by a nephew, Diego, by whose death the legitimate\r\n     male line was extinguished. Then followed more litigation,\r\n     female claimants now being conspicuous, until in the beginning\r\n     of the seventeenth century we find in the Portuguese house\r\n     of Braganza the titles the discoverer once so coveted, they\r\n     being then conferred on Nuño Gelves, grandson of the third\r\n     daughter of Diego, son of Christopher Columbus, and who then\r\n     might write his name De Portugallo Colon, duque de Veraguas,\r\n     marqués de la Jamaica, y almirante de las Indias.\r\n\r\n     [V-13] The _Consejo Supremo de Indias_, Supreme Council of\r\n     the Indies, sometimes termed the _Consejo de Indias_, or India\r\n     Council, was a body possessing executive as well as judicial\r\n     powers, in permanent session at Madrid, and having the same\r\n     jurisdiction over Spanish colonies in America that was held in\r\n     Spain by the other supreme councils, especially the _Consejo\r\n     de Castilla_. Immediately after its discovery the American\r\n     portion of the Spanish realm was superintended by the Council\r\n     of Castile, or by councillors selected therefrom. But with\r\n     the constantly increasing burden of business the creation of a\r\n     separate supreme tribunal became necessary. Thus the machinery\r\n     set in motion by Ferdinand was augmented by Charles, and\r\n     further improved by Philip, until these vast western interests\r\n     were watched over with undeviating care. Thence all measures\r\n     for the government and commerce of Spanish America issued;\r\n     it was the tribunal likewise of ultimate resort where all\r\n     questions relating thereto were adjudicated. For many years,\r\n     however, the India Council had no formal existence. Fonseca;\r\n     Hernando de Vega, _comendador mayor_ of Leon; Mercurino\r\n     Gatinara, afterward superintendent of all the councils;\r\n     a gentleman of the emperor's bedchamber called De Lassao;\r\n     Francisco de Vargas, treasurer-general of Castile, and others,\r\n     acted specially at the request of their sovereign. This fact\r\n     gave rise to errors of date into which several historians\r\n     fell. Thus Prescott, _Ferd. and Isabella_, iii. 452, says,\r\n     copying Robertson, _Hist. Am._, ii. 358, that the Council of\r\n     the Indies was first established by Ferdinand in 1511. Helps,\r\n     _Span. Conq._, ii. 28—drawing a false inference from a false\r\n     inference drawn by Herrera, ii. ii. xx., who makes the date\r\n     1517—goes on to describe a council for Indian affairs, dating\r\n     its organization 1518, and of which Fonseca was president,\r\n     and Vega, Zapata, Peter Martyr, and Padilla were members.\r\n\r\n     It was the first of August, 1524, that the office proper\r\n     of the Council of the Indies was created. See _Solorzano_,\r\n     _Politica Indiana_, ii. 394. The decree of final organization\r\n     may be found in the _Recop. de Indias_, i. 228. It sets forth\r\n     that in view of the great benefits, under divine favor, the\r\n     crown daily receives by the enlargement of the realm, the\r\n     monarch by the grace of God feeling his obligation to govern\r\n     these kingdoms well, for the better service of God and the\r\n     well-being of those lands, it was ordered that there should\r\n     always reside at court this tribunal. It should have a\r\n     president; the grand chancellor of the Indies should also be\r\n     a councillor; its members, whose number must be eight, should\r\n     be _letrados_, men learned in the law. There were to be a\r\n     fiscal, two secretaries, and a deputy grand chancellor, all\r\n     of noble birth, upright in morals, prudent, and God-fearing\r\n     men. There must be, also, three _relatores_, or readers, and\r\n     a notary, all of experience, diligence, and fidelity; four\r\n     expert _contadores de cuentas_, accountants and auditors;\r\n     a treasurer-general; two _solicitadores fiscales_, crown\r\n     attorneys; a chief chronicler and cosmographer; a professor\r\n     of mathematics; a _tasador_ to tax costs of suits; a lawyer\r\n     and a _procurador_ for poor suitors; a chaplain to say\r\n     mass on council days; four door-keepers, and a bailiff, all\r\n     taking oath on assuming duty to keep secret the acts of the\r\n     council. The first president appointed was Fray García de\r\n     Loaysa, at the time general of the Dominicans, confessor\r\n     of the emperor, and bishop of Osma, and later cardinal and\r\n     archbishop of Seville. The first councillors were Luis Vaca,\r\n     bishop of the Canary Islands; Gonzalo Maldonado, later bishop\r\n     of Ciudad Rodrigo; Diego Beltran; the prothonotary, Pedro\r\n     Martyr de Anglería, abbot of Jamaica, and Lorenzo Galindez de\r\n     Carbajal. Prado was the first fiscal. A list of the earlier\r\n     presidents, councillors, and officials may be found at the\r\n     end of _Descripcion de las Indias Occidentales_, in vol. i.\r\n     Barcia's edition of Herrera.\r\n\r\n     The jurisdiction of the council extended to every department,\r\n     civil, military, ecclesiastical, and commercial, and no\r\n     other council in Spain might have cognizance of any affairs\r\n     appertaining to the New World. Two thirds of the members\r\n     must approve of any law or ordinance before it was presented\r\n     to the king for his signature. In the _Recopilacion de las\r\n     Indias_, i. 228-323, is given the legislation on the council\r\n     to 1680. Philip II. ordered the council to be obeyed equally\r\n     in Spain and in the Indies. Three members were to constitute\r\n     a quorum, and sit from three to five hours every day except\r\n     holidays. For purposes of temporal government the New World\r\n     was to be divided into viceroyalties, provinces of audiencias,\r\n     and _chancillerías reales_, or sovereign tribunals of lesser\r\n     weight than audiencias, and provinces of the officials of the\r\n     royal exchequer, _adelantamientos_, or the government of an\r\n     adelantado, _gobernaciones_, or governmentships, _alcaldías\r\n     mayores_, _corregimientos_, _alcaldías ordinarias_, and of\r\n     the _hermandad_, _concejos de Españoles y de Indios_; and\r\n     for spiritual government into archbishoprics and suffragan\r\n     bishoprics, abbeys, parishes, and _diezmerías_, or tithing\r\n     districts, and provinces of the religious orders. The division\r\n     for temporal matters was to conform as nearly as possible\r\n     to that for spiritual affairs. The council was commanded to\r\n     have for its chief care the conversion and good treatment\r\n     of the Indians. The laws made by the Council for the Indies\r\n     should conform as nearly as possible to the existing laws\r\n     of Spain. In selecting ecclesiastics and civil officers for\r\n     the Indies, the greatest care should be exercised that none\r\n     but good men were sent, and their final nomination must rest\r\n     with the king. Nepotism was strictly prohibited, and offices\r\n     were not to be sold. In 1600 Felipe III. ordered that twice\r\n     a week should be held a council of war, composed of eight\r\n     members, four of whom were councillors of the Indies, and\r\n     four specially selected by the king. It was decreed in 1584\r\n     that the offices of governors, corregidores, and alcaldes\r\n     mayores of the Indies, when bestowed on persons residing\r\n     in Spain, should be for five years; when residents in the\r\n     Indies were appointed, it should be for three years. Felipe\r\n     IV. in 1636 ordered that in the archives of the council,\r\n     beside records, should be kept manuscripts and printed books\r\n     treating on matters moral, religious, historical, political,\r\n     and scientific, touching the Indies, all that had been or\r\n     should be issued; and publishers of books of this class were\r\n     required by law to deposit one copy each in these archives.\r\n     Two keys were ordered kept, one by the councillor appointed by\r\n     the president, and the other by the senior secretary. And when\r\n     the archives of the council became too full, a portion might\r\n     be sent to Simancas. It was early ordered that the chronicler\r\n     of the council should write a history, natural and political,\r\n     of the Indies, every facility being afforded him; and before\r\n     drawing his last quarter's salary each year, he must present\r\n     what he had written. So it was with the cosmographer, who was\r\n     to calculate eclipses, compile guide-books, prepare tables\r\n     and descriptions, and give an annual lecture. The regulations\r\n     governing this august body were most wise, and it was the\r\n     constant aim of the Spanish monarchs to increase its power and\r\n     sustain its authority. Its jurisdiction extended over half\r\n     the world, being absolute on sea and land. By it viceroys\r\n     were made and unmade, also presidents and governors; and, in\r\n     ecclesiastical rule, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and\r\n     lesser spiritual dignitaries. His Holiness himself was second\r\n     here. All bulls or briefs of indulgences issued by the pope\r\n     must be laid before the _Consejo de Cruzada_, and pass through\r\n     the Council of the Indies. The Consejo de Indias continued\r\n     in Spain till by a law of the Cortes, March 24, 1834, it\r\n     was abolished, as indeed was the _Consejo de Castilla_. The\r\n     judicial functions of the two were vested in the _Tribunal\r\n     Supremo de España é Indias_; their executive powers in the\r\n     _Consejo Real de España é Indias_, both being created by the\r\n     same law.\r\n\r\n     The next most important agency in the management of New\r\n     World affairs was the _Casa de Contratacion_, house or board\r\n     of trade, supreme in commercial matters, save only in its\r\n     subordination to the Consejo de Indias, in common with every\r\n     other power below absolute royalty. As before stated, on the\r\n     return of Columbus from his first voyage, Fonseca, with two or\r\n     three assistants, was appointed to take charge of the business\r\n     appertaining to the discovery, the nature or importance of\r\n     which was then but faintly conceived. This Indian office or\r\n     agency was established at Seville, with a branch office in\r\n     the form of a custom-house at Cádiz. But before the expiration\r\n     of the first decade the New World business had so increased,\r\n     and the New World dimensions were so rapidly expanding, that\r\n     it was found necessary to enlarge the capabilities and powers\r\n     of the India Office; hence by decrees of January 20, and June\r\n     5, 1503, was ordered established at Seville the _Casa de\r\n     Contratacion de las Indias_, or India house of trade, that\r\n     commerce between the mother country and the Indian colonies\r\n     might be promoted. The first cédula ordered the office\r\n     placed in the arsenal, the second in a building known as the\r\n     _alcazar viejo_, and in that part of it called the _cuarto de\r\n     los almirantes_, or admirals' quarters. The board consisted\r\n     of a president, three royal officers, or judges, to wit,\r\n     treasurer, auditor, and factor; also three judges bred to the\r\n     law; one fiscal, and other lesser officers and attendants.\r\n     Among the first to serve, beside Fonseca, were Sancho de\r\n     Matienzo, a canon of Seville, treasurer; Francisco Pinelo,\r\n     factor, or general agent; and Jimeno de Berviesca, contador,\r\n     or auditor. By law those three officers were to reside in the\r\n     building; and were to despatch all ships going to the Indies,\r\n     and receive all merchandise coming thence. In all which\r\n     they were scrupulously to respect the agreement made with\r\n     Columbus by the sovereigns. They were, moreover, to proclaim\r\n     that licenses for discovery and trade would be given, under\r\n     just conditions, to all seeking them and filing commensurate\r\n     bonds. See _Nueva España_, _Brev. Res._ MS.; _Veitia Linage_,\r\n     _Norte de la Contratacion_; _Recop. de Indias_; _Solorzano_,\r\n     _Pol. Ind._; _Zamora y Coronado_, _Bib. Leg. Ult._; _Young's\r\n     Hist. Mex._, 40-6; _Democratic Review_, i. 264-9; _Walton's\r\n     Exposé_, 24; _Niles' S. Am. and Mex._, 65-8; _Revolution in\r\n     Sp.

An\r\n     officer appointed by the king resided at Cádiz to despatch\r\n     vessels under the supervision of the Casa de Contratacion.\r\n     The India House was a court of judicature no less than a\r\n     board of trade; it had cognizance in all civil, criminal,\r\n     and commercial questions arising from the traffic of Spain\r\n     with the Indies, appeal being to the Council of the Indies.\r\n     I will mention a few only of the more important of the many\r\n     minor orders regulating this board. The volume and variety\r\n     of its business rapidly increased from year to year. In 1510\r\n     Diego Colon was instructed to inform its officers concerning\r\n     all that he should write to the king. The board was obliged\r\n     to possess itself of the minutest knowledge concerning\r\n     New World affairs, and of persons asking permission to go\r\n     thither, and in the execution of its duties it was not to\r\n     be interfered with even by royal officers of high rank. The\r\n     actual powers conferred on the three officials first named\r\n     by Queen Juana are not given by any of the chronicles, or\r\n     collections of laws, which I have examined. Indeed, the powers\r\n     and jurisdiction of the board were never clearly defined\r\n     until the issuing of the ordinances of the 23d of August,\r\n     1543, known as the _ordenanzas de la casa_, and which should\r\n     not be confounded with the _ordenanzas_ of other years. Every\r\n     day but feast-days the board should meet for business, and\r\n     remain in session for three hours in the forenoon, and on\r\n     the afternoons of Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for the\r\n     despatch of ships. Absence involved primarily loss of pay,\r\n     and finally loss of office. If this be not time sufficient\r\n     for the business, they must take more time. The president and\r\n     judges together should transact the business; a judge might\r\n     not act singly except upon a matter referred to him by all.\r\n     The notary should keep in his book an account of the hours of\r\n     absence among the officers. Before the platform on which sat\r\n     the judges, benches were ordered placed for the convenience\r\n     of the _visitadores_, or inspectors of ships, and such other\r\n     honorable persons having business there as should be invited\r\n     by the tribunal to sit. The authorities of Seville should not\r\n     interfere in the trial and punishment of crimes committed on\r\n     board ships sailing to and from the Indies. If the penalty\r\n     was death or mutilation, the offender was to be tried by the\r\n     three judges, members of the board, learned in the law. In the\r\n     civil suits of private persons, appertaining to the Indies,\r\n     litigants were given the option of bringing their disputes\r\n     before the judges of the India House, or before the ordinary\r\n     justice of Seville. Disputes arising from shipwreck, loss of\r\n     cargo, and frauds connected therewith, were all brought before\r\n     the India House. Traders to the Indies residing in Seville\r\n     were authorized to meet and elect a prior and consul, or\r\n     consuls, which consulate should be called the _Universidad de\r\n     los Cargadores á las Indias_, and hold their meetings in the\r\n     Casa de Contratacion. No foreigner, his son or grandson could\r\n     so hold office. This consulate had cognizance in disputes\r\n     between these merchants and factors in matters relative to\r\n     purchases, sales, freights, insurance, and bankruptcy, all\r\n     being subordinate to the regular tribunal of the India House.\r\n     Appeals were from the consulate to one of the regular judges\r\n     selected annually to that duty. The consulate could address\r\n     the king only through the Casa de Contratacion, and government\r\n     despatches from the Indies must be forwarded by the board.\r\n     As justice alone was the object of these merchants, and not\r\n     chicanery, or the distortion of evidence, parties to suits\r\n     before the consulate were not allowed lawyers. That harmony\r\n     might be maintained, the Casa de Contratacion should carry\r\n     out the orders of the _audiencia de grados_ of Seville, if\r\n     deemed conformable to law, and to existing regulations of\r\n     the board. Communications from the board to the king must be\r\n     signed by the president and judges conjointly, and no letter\r\n     must treat of more than a single subject. All gold, silver,\r\n     pearls, and precious stones coming from the Indies were first\r\n     to be deposited in the India House, and thence distributed to\r\n     the owners. The king's share was to be placed in a safe with\r\n     three keys, or if this was too small, then in a room having\r\n     three keys. Other safes were to be kept, one for each kind\r\n     of property. Accounts of receipts at the India House were\r\n     to be rendered the king every year. The board must render an\r\n     annual statement of its expenditures on _religiosos_ sent to\r\n     the Indies. Felipe IV. ordered that the board should collect\r\n     from all ships and merchandise, including a _pro rata_ on the\r\n     king's share, the cost for convoying them forth and back.\r\n     Such was the famous India House at Seville, modest in its\r\n     beginning, mighty in its accomplishments, through which passed\r\n     into Spain the almost fabulous wealth of Spanish America.\r\n\r\n     [V-14] _Recopilacion de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias_,\r\n     of which I make general use in referring to the laws passed\r\n     in Spain for the regulation of the affairs of the New World,\r\n     is the result of several previous efforts in the direction of\r\n     compilation. It was published at Madrid, the first edition in\r\n     four volumes, by order of Cárlos II. in 1681, and the fourth\r\n     edition in three volumes, under the direction of the Royal\r\n     and Supreme Council of the Indies, in 1791. The work aimed\r\n     to embody all laws in force at the date of the respective\r\n     editions relative to the Spanish American colonies. The three\r\n     volumes are divided into nine books, and each book into from\r\n     eight to forty-six titles. The first title of the first book\r\n     is _De la Santa Fe Católica_, a subject then second to none\r\n     in grave importance. In fact the whole of the first book is\r\n     devoted to ecclesiastical and kindred matters. The second book\r\n     refers in the main to tribunals and officials; the third in\r\n     a great measure to the army; the fourth to discoveries and\r\n     settlements; the fifth to executive and judicial offices;\r\n     the sixth to Indians, including treatment, repartimientos and\r\n     encomiendas; the seventh to crimes and punishments; the eighth\r\n     to the management of the royal treasury; and the ninth to the\r\n     India House and the commerce of the Indies. By a decree of\r\n     the emperor in 1550, which was embodied in the ordinances of\r\n     audiencias in 1563, by Philip II., it was ordered that all\r\n     _cédulas_ and _provisiones_ should be copied _in extenso_\r\n     in a book set apart for that service, and of which great\r\n     care should be taken, and that the said documents were to be\r\n     filed chronologically in the archives of each audiencia. In\r\n     1571, by Philip II., it was decreed, and the decree embodied\r\n     in the _Recopilacion_ of 1680, that cédulas and provisiones\r\n     concerning the royal treasury should be kept in a separate\r\n     book.\r\n\r\n     The earliest printed collection of laws relating solely to\r\n     the Indies is that of the _ordenanzas_ for the government of\r\n     the audiencia of Mexico. This was issued in 1548. In 1552 a\r\n     similar collection was made by order of the viceroy of Peru,\r\n     Antonio de Mendoza, for the government of the audiencia of\r\n     Lima, but was not printed at that time. Later the fiscal\r\n     of Mexico, Antonio Maldonado, began a compilation to which\r\n     he gave the name _Repertorio de las Cedulas, Provisiones,\r\n     i Ordenanzas Reales_, but it does not appear that he ever\r\n     completed his task, although a royal cédula in 1556 authorized\r\n     him to do so. Upon the representation in 1552 by Francisco\r\n     Hernandez de Liébana, fiscal of the Council of the Indies,\r\n     of the urgent necessity of such a work, a royal cédula was\r\n     issued in 1560, directing the viceroy of New Spain, Luis de\r\n     Velasco, to have prepared and printed such regulations as were\r\n     in force within the jurisdiction of the audiencia of Mexico,\r\n     which was done in 1563 under the direction of Vasco de Puga,\r\n     oidor of the audiencia. Francisco de Toledo, sent from Spain\r\n     in 1569 as viceroy of Peru, was ordered to make a similar\r\n     compilation covering the limits of his viceroyalty, but it was\r\n     afterward thought better the work should be done in Spain.\r\n     Hence in 1570 Philip II. ordered made a general compilation\r\n     of laws and provisions for the government of the Indies, which\r\n     was intended as a code, obsolete laws being omitted, new ones\r\n     provided where necessary, and those in conflict reconciled.\r\n     Of this work, from some cause not satisfactorily explained,\r\n     probably from the death of the author, only the title relating\r\n     to the Consejo de Indias and its ordenanzas was printed,\r\n     although the whole of the first book had been prepared.\r\n\r\n     In 1581 some ordinances relative to the Casa de Contratacion\r\n     and its judges were printed at Madrid; and more of a\r\n     similar nature in 1585, beside the _Leyes y Ordenanzas_ for\r\n     the government of the Indies, and the ordinances of 1582\r\n     concerning the despatch of fleets for New Spain and Tierra\r\n     Firme, printed at Madrid; and in Guatemala the _ordenanzas_ of\r\n     July 14, 1556, relating to the _Universidad de los Mercaderes\r\n     de Sevilla_. In 1594 the marqués de Cañete, viceroy of Peru,\r\n     published at Lima a small volume of ordinances relative to\r\n     the good treatment of the Indians. But the want of a general\r\n     compilation becoming more and more apparent, Diego de Encinas,\r\n     a clerk in the office of the king's secretary, was ordered\r\n     to prepare a copy of all _provisiones_, _cédulas_, _cartas_,\r\n     _ordenanzas_, and _instrucciones_ despatched prior to 1596,\r\n     which work was printed at Madrid, in four folio volumes, the\r\n     same year. Harrisse is mistaken when he says these volumes\r\n     were suppressed, not having been authorized; for not only\r\n     is their authorization distinctly stated over the king's\r\n     own hand in the enacting clause of the _Recopilacion de las\r\n     Indias_, May 18, 1680, where it says that Philip II. ordered\r\n     Encinas to do this work, but that owing to their faulty\r\n     arrangement the volumes 'aun no han satisfecho el intento de\r\n     recopilar en forma conveniente,' which clearly shows them to\r\n     have been in use up to that time. Shortly after this, Alvar\r\n     Gomez de Abaunza, oidor of the audiencia of Guatemala, and\r\n     subsequently _alcalde del crímen_ of the audiencia of Mexico,\r\n     compiled two large volumes under the title of _Repertorio\r\n     de Cedulas Reales_, which were not printed. And in Spain,\r\n     Diego de Zorrilla made an attempt to revive the project\r\n     of the _recopilacion de leyes_, by making extracts from\r\n     Encinas and adding laws of later date; but having received\r\n     an appointment as oidor of the audiencia of Quito, he left\r\n     the work incomplete and in manuscript. Others made similar\r\n     attempts; I shall not be able to enumerate them all, or give\r\n     a full list even of the printed collections. For example, in\r\n     1603 was published at Valladolid a folio entitled _Ordenanças\r\n     Reales del Consejo de Indias_, and another thin folio called\r\n     _Leyes y Ordenanças Nuevamente hechas por su Magestad, para\r\n     la gouernaciõ de las Indias_; later appeared a folio entitled\r\n     _Ordenanças de la Casa de la Contratacion de Sevilla_, and\r\n     another, _Ordenanças Reales para el gobierno de los Tribunales\r\n     de Contaduría Mayor en los Reynos de las Indias_. In 1606\r\n     Hernando de Villagomez began to arrange cédulas and other laws\r\n     relating to the Indies; and two years after, the celebrated\r\n     conde de Lémos being president of the Council, Villagomez,\r\n     and Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acuña, member of the Council of\r\n     the Indies, were appointed a committee to compile the laws;\r\n     but nothing came of it, even Fernando Carrillo failing to\r\n     complete their unfinished task. Juan de Solórzano y Pereira,\r\n     oidor of the audiencia of Lima, also began a collection of\r\n     cédulas, and sent to the Council of the Indies the first book\r\n     of his contemplated work, with the titles of the other five\r\n     books which he intended to compile. In a _carta real_ he was\r\n     thanked for what he had done, and charged to continue his\r\n     labors, sending each book as prepared to the Council. I have\r\n     no evidence that he did so.\r\n\r\n     All this time our book was a-building, and indeed for 170\r\n     years more. A complete history of this one work would fill\r\n     a volume; obviously in a bibliographical note, even of undue\r\n     length, only the more prominent agencies and incidents of its\r\n     being can be touched upon.\r\n\r\n     We come now to the time when Antonio de Leon Pinelo, judge\r\n     in the India House, presented to the Council of the Indies\r\n     the first and second books, nearly complete, of his _Discurso\r\n     sobre la importancia, forma, y disposicion de la Recopilacion\r\n     de Leies de Indias_, which was printed in one volume, folio,\r\n     in 1623. This was in reality Encinas' work with some cédulas\r\n     added. Meanwhile it appears that some direct official work\r\n     was done on a compilation, for in 1624 we find the Council\r\n     instructing Pinelo to enter into relations with the custodian\r\n     of the material for the compilation. Pinelo was likewise\r\n     authorized to examine the archives of the Council; and for two\r\n     years he employed himself continuously in examining some 500\r\n     MS. volumes of cédulas, containing over 300,000 documents.\r\n     In the law authorizing the _Recopilacion de las Indias_ of\r\n     1680, it is said that in 1622 the task had been entrusted to\r\n     Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acuña, probably the custodian referred\r\n     to. In 1628 it was thought best to print for the use of the\r\n     Council an epitome of the part completed; hence appeared\r\n     the _Sumarios de la Recopilacion General de las Leies de las\r\n     Indias_. Aguiar y Acuña dying, Pinelo worked on alone until\r\n     1634, when the Council approved of what had been done; and in\r\n     the year following this indefatigable and learned man had the\r\n     satisfaction of presenting the completed _Recopilacion de las\r\n     Indias_. To one of the members, Juan de Solórzano y Pereira,\r\n     the work was referred, and received his approbation in 1636.\r\n     More than half a million of cédulas had been examined and\r\n     classified during the progress of this compilation. And yet\r\n     it was not published; and during the delay it was becoming\r\n     obsolete, and new material and partial compilations were being\r\n     made both in Spain and in America, some of which were printed\r\n     in separate pieces. In 1634 the _Ordenanzas de la Junta de\r\n     Guerra de Indias_ were published; in 1646 Juan Diez de la\r\n     Calle compiled and published for the Council of the Indies\r\n     in small quarto a memorial containing some of the cédulas of\r\n     the _Recopilacion_. A useful aid for the study of statistic\r\n     geography in America is to be found in the exceedingly rare\r\n     _Memorial y Noticias Sacras y Reales del Imperio de las Indias\r\n     Occidentales_. By Iuan Diez de la Calle, 1646, sm. 4to, 183\r\n     folios. A register for the Spanish colonies, chiefly of state\r\n     and church officials, of towns, their wealth and notable\r\n     objects. Folios 41-132 refer to the jurisdictions of the\r\n     audiencias of Mexico, Guadalajara, and Guatemala. Calle had in\r\n     the previous year, as assistant chief clerk to the secretary\r\n     of the Royal Council of the Indies, presented the work to the\r\n     king as _Memorial Informatorio al Rey_, and in accordance with\r\n     his approval it had been reprinted with additions as above.\r\n     Encouraged hereby he wrote at greater length the _Noticias\r\n     Sacras i Reales_ in twelve libros, the publication of which\r\n     was begun, but never finished. Puga's work was continued in\r\n     the form of an _Inventario_ of the cédulas relating to New\r\n     Spain issued from 1567-1620, the manuscript being presented\r\n     to the secretary of the New Spain department of the Council\r\n     of the Indies by Francisco de Párraga, afterward forming part\r\n     of the Barcia collection. In 1647 appeared at Seville the\r\n     _Ordenanças Reales, para la Casa de Contratacion de Sevilla, y\r\n     para otras cosas de las Indias_; in 1658 Pinelo published at\r\n     Madrid the _Autos, acuerdos y decretos de gobierno del real\r\n     y supremo consejo de las Indias_. In 1661 there was printed\r\n     at Madrid a folio entitled _Ordenanzas para remedio de los\r\n     daños, é inconvenientes que se siguen de los descaminos i\r\n     arribadas maliciosas de los Navios que navegan de las Indias\r\n     Occidentales_; and in 1672 the _Norte de la Contratacion\r\n     de las Indias Occidentales_ of Ioseph de Veitia Linage was\r\n     published at Seville. J. Stevens translated this last work\r\n     into English and published it in London in 1702.\r\n\r\n     The many and long periods of suspended animation of the\r\n     _Recopilacion de Indias_, between its inception and its birth,\r\n     is no less remarkable a feature in the history of the work\r\n     than its multiplicity of origins and collateral affluents. In\r\n     1660 the case was brought before the king, and then referred\r\n     to successive committees, in each of which were several\r\n     members of the Council, the whole being under the supervision\r\n     of their successive presidents, until finally, on the 18th of\r\n     May, 1680, a royal decree made the _Recopilacion de Indias_\r\n     law, and all ordinances conflicting therewith null. Even\r\n     now printing did not seem to be at first thought of. Two\r\n     authenticated copies were ordered made, one to be kept in the\r\n     archives of the Council, and the other at Simancas. It was\r\n     soon seen, however, that this was not sufficient, and in 1681\r\n     the king ordered the book printed under the superintendence\r\n     of the Council of the Indies, which was done. Although the\r\n     _Recopilacion de Indias_ was several times revised, and well\r\n     fulfilled its mission for over a hundred years, in fact to\r\n     the end of Spain's dominion in America, several partial\r\n     collections appeared from time to time in Spain and in\r\n     America. Among these were _Sumarios de las Cédulas ... que\r\n     se han despachado ... desde el año 1628 ... hasta ... 1677_,\r\n     printed in Mexico in 1678; _Ordenanzas del Perù_, Lima,\r\n     1685; also the _Ordenanhas de Cruçada, para los Subdelegados\r\n     del Perù_; _Reglamento y Aranceles Reales para el Comercio\r\n     Libre de España à Indias_, 1778; _Teatro de la legislacion\r\n     universal de España e Indias_, by Antonio Javier Perez y\r\n     Lopez, 28 vols. 4to, Madrid, 1791-8. In the various public and\r\n     private archives of Spain and Spanish America are manuscript\r\n     collections of cédulas and compilations on special subjects.\r\n\r\n     [VI-1] The world was at a loss at first what to call the\r\n     newly found region to the westward. It was easy enough to\r\n     name the islands, one after another, as they were discovered,\r\n     but when the Spaniards reached the continent they were\r\n     backward about giving it a general name. Everything was so\r\n     dark and uncertain; islands were mistaken for continent, and\r\n     continent for islands. The simple expression New World that\r\n     fell with the first exclamations of wonder from the lips of\r\n     Europeans on learning of the success of Columbus sufficed\r\n     for a time as a general appellation. More general and more\r\n     permanent was the name India, arising from the mistake that\r\n     this was the farther side or eastern shore of India, applied\r\n     at first to the continent as well as to the islands, and\r\n     which fastened itself permanently on the people as well as\r\n     on the country. 'Segun la opinion mas probable, que penetró\r\n     hasta aquellos parages, y tambien mas comunmente se da à este\r\n     nuevo mundo descubierto, el nombre de Indias Occidentales,\r\n     para distinguirlas de las verdaderas que están situadas en la\r\n     Asia à nuestro Oriente entre el Indo, y el Ganges.' _Nueva\r\n     España, Brev. Res._, MS. i. 3. As the coast line of the\r\n     continent extended itself and became known as such it was very\r\n     naturally called by navigators _tierra firme_, firm land, in\r\n     contradistinction to the islands which were supposed to be\r\n     less firm. And, indeed, not the islands only, but the people\r\n     of the islands are inconstant, the moon being mistress of\r\n     the waters. As Las Casas, _Hist. Indias_, iii. 395, puts it,\r\n     'La naturaleza dellos no les consiente tener perseverancia en\r\n     la virtud, quier por ser insulares, que naturalmente tienen\r\n     ménos constancia, por ser la luna señora de las aguas.' The\r\n     name Tierra Firme, thus general at first, in time became\r\n     particular. As a designation for an unknown shore it at first\r\n     implied only the Continent. As discovery unfolded, and the\r\n     magnitude of this Firm Land became better known, new parts\r\n     of it were designated by new names, and Tierra Firme became\r\n     a local appellation in place of a general term. Paria being\r\n     first discovered, it fastened itself there; also along the\r\n     shore to Darien, Veragua, and on to Costa Rica, where at no\r\n     well defined point it stopped, so far as the northern seaboard\r\n     was concerned, and in due time struck across to the South\r\n     Sea, where the name marked off an equivalent coast line. Lopez\r\n     Vaz, in _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, iv. 1433, says, 'From this\r\n     Land of Veragua vnto the Iland of Margereta, the Coast along\r\n     is called the _firme Land_, not for that the other places\r\n     are not of the firme Land, but because it was the first firme\r\n     Land that the Spaniards did conquer after they had past the\r\n     Ilands.' In the _Recop. de Indias_, i. 324, is a law dated\r\n     1535, and repeated 1537, 1538, 1563, 1570, 1571, and 1588,\r\n     which places within the limits of the kingdom of Tierra Firme\r\n     the province of Castilla del Oro. As a political division\r\n     Tierra Firme had existence for a long time. It comprised the\r\n     provinces of Darien, Veragua, and Panamá, which last bore\r\n     also the name of Tierra Firme as a province. The extent of\r\n     the kingdom was 65 leagues in length by 18 at its greatest\r\n     breadth, and nine leagues at its smallest width. It was\r\n     bounded on the east by Cartagena, and the gulf of Urabá and\r\n     its river; on the west by Costa Rica, including a portion\r\n     of what is now Costa Rica; and on the north and south by the\r\n     two seas. On the maps of _Novvs Orbis seu descriptionis Indiæ\r\n     Occidentalis_ by De Laet, 1633, and of _Ogilby's America_,\r\n     1671, the Isthmus is called Tierra Firme. Villagutierre\r\n     writes in 1701, _Hist. Conq. Itza_, 12, 'Tierra-Firme de la\r\n     Costa de Paria, ò Provincia, que llamò de Veragua; principio\r\n     de los dilatados Reynos de aquel Nuevo, y Grande Emisferio.'\r\n     Neither Guatemala, Mexico, nor any of the lands to the north\r\n     were ever included in Tierra Firme. English authors often\r\n     apply the Latin form, Terra Firma, to this division, which is\r\n     misleading.\r\n\r\n     The early Spanish writers were filled with disgust by the\r\n     misnomer America. Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones Ilvstres_,\r\n     in his preface speaks of the 'Nueva, y riquissima Parte\r\n     del Mundo, que se llama vulgarmẽte _America_, y nosotros\r\n     llamamos _Fer-Isabelica_;' and throughout his book the\r\n     author persists, where 'Nuovo Mundo' is not employed, in\r\n     calling America Fer-Isabelica, that is to say Ferdinand and\r\n     Isabella, an attempt at name-changing no less futile than\r\n     bungling. This was in 1639. If with these seventeenth-century\r\n     writers the name Columbia, the only appropriate one for the\r\n     New World, smacked too strongly of Genoa, they might have\r\n     called it Pinzonia, which would have been in better taste, at\r\n     least, than in bestowing the honor on the cold and haggling\r\n     sovereigns. Jules Marcou, like thousands of his class who\r\n     seek fame through foolishness, writes in the _Atlantic\r\n     Monthly_, March, 1875, to prove that the name America came\r\n     from a mountain range in Nicaragua, called by the natives\r\n     Americ, which became a synonym for the golden mainland, first\r\n     at the islands and then in Europe, until it finally reached\r\n     the foot of the Vosges, where Waldsee-Müller, or Hylacomylus\r\n     of Saint Dié, confuses it with the name of Vespucci, and is\r\n     led to print in the preface of Vespucci's Voyages:—'And the\r\n     fourth part of the world having been discovered by Americus\r\n     may well be called Amerige, which is as much as to say, the\r\n     land of Americus, or America.' Had the name been so early\r\n     and so commonly applied to Tierra Firme, it is strange that\r\n     some one of the many Spanish writers in the Indies or in\r\n     Spain had not employed it or mentioned it. Villagutierre in\r\n     1701 endorses the effort made by Pizarro y Orellana in 1639,\r\n     saying, _Hist. Conq. Itza_, 13, that the New World should have\r\n     been called after the Catholic sovereigns, 'de cuya orden,\r\n     y à cuyas expensas se descubrian.' He states further, on the\r\n     authority of Simon, that the Council of the Indies as late as\r\n     1620 talked of changing the name, but were deterred by the\r\n     inconvenience involved. Likewise Vetancurt, _Teatro Mex._,\r\n     13-15, in 1698 says that the name America should be erased\r\n     from history, calling attention to the bull of partition\r\n     issued by Pope Adrian VI., which alludes to the new lands\r\n     as the Western Part—only it was not Adrian but Alexander\r\n     VI. who perpetrated the bull, in which moreover there is no\r\n     such term as Western Part used—arguing therefrom that Indias\r\n     Occidentales was the most proper term. On the application\r\n     and origin of the name America see cap. i. p. 123-5 of this\r\n     volume.\r\n\r\n     [VI-2] Now gulf of Darién. The name Urabá was first applied to\r\n     the gulf by Bastidas, or by navigators immediately following\r\n     him. Subsequently the territory on the eastern side of the\r\n     gulf was called Urabá, and that on the western side Darien. On\r\n     Peter Martyr's map, _India beyond the Ganges_, 1510, is the\r\n     word _vraba_; on the globe of Orontius, 1531, _Sinus vraba_\r\n     is applied to the gulf, and _vrabe_ to the river Atrato.\r\n     Pilestrina, _Munich Atlas_, no. iv., 1515, places _G: d\r\n     epimeg_ at the southern end of the gulf, which is represented\r\n     as very wide. Maiollo, _Munich Atlas_, no. v., 1519, writes\r\n     _Vraba_ in small letters at the southern end; also the words\r\n     _aldea_, _tera plana_, and _Rio basso_.\r\n\r\n     [VI-3] Castilla del Oro was for the time but another name\r\n     for this part of Tierra Firme. Then Castilla del Oro became\r\n     a province of Tierra Firme; for in the _Recop. de Indias_,\r\n     ii. 110, we find ordered by the emperor in 1550, 'que la\r\n     Provincia de Tierrafirme, llamada Castilla del Oro, sea de\r\n     las Provincial del Perú, y no de las de Nueva España.' The\r\n     province of Veragua, and the territory 'back of the gulf of\r\n     Urabá, where dwelt the cacique Cimaco,' were declared within\r\n     the limits of the government of Tierra Firme. Helps, _Span.\r\n     Conq._, i. 400, calls a map of that portion of South America\r\n     extending from the gulf of Maracaibo to the gulf of Urabá\r\n     by the name Castilla del Oro. I have noticed in several\r\n     of the early maps the same mistake. Colon and Ribero call\r\n     only the Pearl Coast Castilla del Oro. In _West-Indische\r\n     Spieghel_, 1624, 64, the country between the Atrato and a\r\n     river flowing into the gulf of Venezuela is called Castilla\r\n     del Oro. Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, i. 320, erroneously narrows\r\n     the limits of Nicuesa's government to that 'partie de la\r\n     Terre-Ferme placée entre le Veragua et le golfe d'Uraba,\r\n     où commençait la governacion de Hojeda;' for Navarrete says\r\n     distinctly in his _Noticias biográficas del capitan Alonso\r\n     Hojeda_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 170, 'Los límites de la\r\n     gobernacion de Hojeda eran desde el cabo de la Vela hasta la\r\n     mitad del golfo de Urabá, que llamaron _nueva Andalucía_; y\r\n     los de la gobernacion de Diego de Nicuesa, que se le concedió\r\n     al mismo tiempo, desde la otra mitad del golfo hasta el cabo\r\n     de _Gracias á Dios_, que se denominó _Castilla del Oro_.' He\r\n     who some time after drew the commission of Pedrarias Dávila as\r\n     'Gobernador de la provincia de Castilla del Oro en el Darien,'\r\n     is sadly confused in his New World geography when he writes,\r\n     _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 337, 'Una muy grand\r\n     parte de tierra que fasta aquí se ha llamado Tierra-firme,\r\n     é agora mandamos que se llame Castilla del Oro, y en ella\r\n     ha hecho nuestra gente un asiento en el golfo de Urabá, que\r\n     es en la provincia del Darien, que al presente se llama la\r\n     provincia de Andalucía la Nueva, é el pueblo se dice Santa\r\n     Maria del Antigua del Darien;' and again on the following\r\n     page:—'Castilla del Oro, con tanto que no se entienda ni\r\n     comprenda en ella la provincia de Verágua, cuya gobernacion\r\n     pertenece al Almirante D. Diego Colon por le haber descubierto\r\n     el Almirante su padre por su persona, ni la tierra que\r\n     descubrieron Vicente Yañez Pinzon é Juan Diaz de Solis, ni la\r\n     provincia de Pária.' Oviedo marks the limits plainly enough,\r\n     iv. 116, 'Por la costa del Norte tiene hasta Veragua, que lo\r\n     que con aquel corresponde en la costa del Sur puede ser la\r\n     punta de Chame, que está quince leguas al Poniente de Panamá,\r\n     é desde allí para arriba seria Castilla del Oro hasta lo que\r\n     respondiesse ó responde de Norte á Sur.' The _Descripcion\r\n     Panamá_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ix. 82,\r\n     says the official name was _Provincia de Castilla del Oro y\r\n     reino de Tierra Firme_, and so remained till the beginning of\r\n     the 17th century, and afterward _Bética áurea_, or _Castilla\r\n     del oro_, is written in _Décadas_, _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, viii. 14.\r\n\r\n     [VI-4] And no wonder misunderstandings should arise over a\r\n     cédula dividing territory in such words as, 'á vos el dicho\r\n     Diego de Nicuesa en el parte de Veragua y el dicho Alonso de\r\n     Hojeda en el parte de Urabá.' _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_,\r\n     iii. 116.\r\n\r\n     [VI-5] Peter Martyr, dec. ii. cap. i., gives Nicuesa 795, and\r\n     Ojeda 300 men. Herrera, dec. i. lib. vii. cap. xi., says that\r\n     700 sailed from Española with Nicuesa and 300 with Ojeda. 'No\r\n     pudiendo Hojeda por su pobreza aprestar la expedicion, la Cosa\r\n     y otros amigos le fletaron una nao, y uno ó dos bergantines,\r\n     que con doscientos hombres.' _Noticias biográficas del capitan\r\n     Alonso Hojeda_, _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 170.\r\n     Benzoni, who pays little heed to numbers or dates, says,\r\n     _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_, 37, 'Hoieda comprò quattro naui e fece\r\n     più di quattrocento soldati alle fue spese, e cosi partì san\r\n     Domenico.'\r\n\r\n     [VI-6] 'Bachiller,' says the English translator of Benzoni,\r\n     'has a wider meaning than our word bachelor, signifying also\r\n     an inferior order of knighthood.' This is a mistake. The word\r\n     has the same corresponding significance in both languages.\r\n     It is true that the degree exempts the possessor from certain\r\n     obligations, such as personal service, military and municipal,\r\n     imprisonment for debt, etc., and grants him certain privileges\r\n     enjoyed by noblemen. But this does not make him noble. The\r\n     next degree, which is that of licentiate, carries with it\r\n     still further privileges, but even this does not constitute\r\n     knighthood. The degree of doctor, which follows that of\r\n     licentiate and is the highest conferred by the university,\r\n     gives the possessor the right to prefix Don to his name, and\r\n     places him in nearly every respect on a par with noblemen.\r\n\r\n     [VI-7] The word _alcalde_ is from the Arabic _al cadi_,\r\n     the judge or governor. _Alcalde ordinario_ used formerly to\r\n     designate the officer having the immediate superintendency\r\n     of a town or city, with cognizance of judicial matters except\r\n     those of persons enjoying some privilege (_fuero_). _Alcalde\r\n     mayor_ signifies a judge, learned in the law, who exercises\r\n     ordinary jurisdiction, civil and criminal, in a town or\r\n     district. The office is equivalent to that of district judge\r\n     in the United States, the audiencia standing for the supreme\r\n     court. There were, however, in the early years, alcaldes\r\n     mayores who were not law judges, or men learned in the law;\r\n     they governed for the king a town or city not the capital of\r\n     a province.\r\n\r\n     _Corregidor_, a magistrate having civil and criminal\r\n     jurisdiction in the first instance (_nisi prius_) and\r\n     gubernatorial inspection in the political and economical\r\n     government in all the towns of the district assigned to him.\r\n     There were _corregidores letrados_ (learned in the law),\r\n     _políticos_ (political), _de capa y espada_ (cloak and sword),\r\n     and _políticos y militares_ (holding civil and military\r\n     authority). All had equal jurisdiction. When the corregidor\r\n     or mayor was not by profession a lawyer, unless he had an\r\n     _asesor_ of his own, the alcalde mayor, if possessed of legal\r\n     knowledge, became his adviser, which greatly increased the\r\n     importance of the latter. The alcalde mayor was appointed by\r\n     the king. He must be by profession a lawyer, twenty-six years\r\n     of age, and of good character. He could neither be a native\r\n     of the district in which he was to exercise his functions,\r\n     nor could he marry a wife in his district. _Recop. de Indias_,\r\n     ii. 113-27 and note. So much for the law. Practically in cases\r\n     of this kind, where the governor was not learned in the law,\r\n     civil, criminal, and some phases even of military authority\r\n     devolved on the alcalde mayor, the two first _ex officio_, and\r\n     the last as the legal adviser of the military chief. In new\r\n     colonies this officer was invested with powers almost equal\r\n     to those of the governor, though of a different kind.\r\n\r\n     [VI-8] A document prepared by the united wisdom of church\r\n     and state, for general use in the Indies, setting forth the\r\n     obligations of all good savages to their dual head of Spain\r\n     and Rome, with a list of punishments which were to follow\r\n     disobedience. Of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n     [VI-9] To this day there are tribes in the vicinity of the\r\n     Atrato River which have never been subjugated.\r\n\r\n     [VI-10] I am unable to find this place on any map. Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, 68, says: 'Començo luego vna fortaleza, y\r\n     pueblo, donde se recoger, y assegurar en el mismo lugar que\r\n     quatro años antes lo auia comẽçado Iuan dela Cosa. Este fue el\r\n     primer pueblo de Españoles en la tierra firme de Indias.' If\r\n     the author refers his first town to the former visit of Juan\r\n     de la Cosa four years before, I should say that could scarcely\r\n     be called an attempted settlement, still less an established\r\n     town. If he intimates that this fort of Ojeda's was the first\r\n     settlement, then is he wrong, for Belen, in Veragua, was\r\n     before this. Whatever he means, and that often is impossible\r\n     to determine, in this instance it is safe to say that he is\r\n     in error, as San Sebastian can by no possibility have been\r\n     the first settlement in Tierra Firme. Herrera writes, i.\r\n     vii. xvi.: 'Entrò en el golfo de Vrabà, y buscò el rio del\r\n     Darien, que entre los Indios era muy celebrado de oro, y de\r\n     gente belicosa, y no le hallando, sobre vnos cerros assentó\r\n     vn pueblo, al qual llamò la villa de san Sebastian, tomandole\r\n     por abogado contra las flechas de la yerua mortifera: y esta\r\n     fue la segunda villa de Castellanos que se poblò, en todo la\r\n     tierra firme, auiendo sido la primera la que començò a poblar\r\n     el Almirante viejo, en Veragua.' Words to the same effect are\r\n     in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 172. It seems rather\r\n     premature to call these futile attempts establishing towns.\r\n\r\n     [VI-11] The first in Tierra Firme, Oviedo says, but he forgets\r\n     the landing, for the same purpose, of Bartolomé Colon at Cape\r\n     Honduras, Sunday, August 14, 1502.\r\n\r\n     [VI-12] When Oviedo gravely asserts that Ribero intended\r\n     desertion, and was stealing by Belen when he was captured by\r\n     Olano, he goes out of his way to make palpable nonsense appear\r\n     as truth. Admit them inhuman monsters, which they were not,\r\n     whither would four starved helpless wretches desert on this\r\n     deadly shore?\r\n\r\n     [VI-13] Chagre, not Chagres, was the name of the native\r\n     province through which this river flows. Near its mouth empty\r\n     several small streams, and it was only below the confluence of\r\n     these that the term Lagartos for any length of time applied.\r\n     Says Alcedo, _Dic._, i., of the River Chagre:—'Lo descubrió\r\n     el de 1527 Hernando de la Serna llamándole rio de Lagartos,\r\n     y antes su boca Lope de Olano el de 1510.' Oviedo remarks\r\n     upon it:—'Algunos han querido deçir que los de aquesta armada\r\n     le dieron este nombre, porque ninguna cosa viva saltaba de\r\n     los navíos que en pressençia de la gente no se la comiessen\r\n     luego muy grandes lagartos, lo qual se experimentó en algunos\r\n     perros. Este rio es la boca del rio Chagre.' _Hist. Gen._,\r\n     ii. 467. Acosta is somewhat loose in the statement, _Compend.\r\n     Hist. Nueva Granada_, 34, 'En la boca del rio Chagres, que\r\n     entonces llamaban de los Lagartos por la multitud de caimanes\r\n     que Colon habia visto en él.' Vaz Dourado places, on _Munich\r\n     Atlas_, no. x., 1571, in this vicinity a river with the word\r\n     _chi_. _Munich Atlas_ no. ix. has it _Chiche_. De Laet writes\r\n     _R. de Chagre_; Dampier, _R. Chagre_; Jefferys, _R. Chagre_\r\n     and _Ft. Chagre_.\r\n\r\n     [VI-14] The name familiar to cartographers often assumed in\r\n     those days peculiar orthography on the maps. Thus Fernando\r\n     Colon writes this name _nõbre_; Ribero, _nõb_; Agnese, _nõmbre\r\n     de dio_; Vaz Dourado, _nöbre de dios_; Ramusio, _Nome de\r\n     dio_; Hondius, in Purchas, _Nom de Dios_; Mercator, Dampier,\r\n     Ogilby, the author of _West-Indische Spieghel_, Jefferys, and\r\n     their successors, contrary to their frequent custom, all write\r\n     the words correctly. This place, as we shall hereafter see,\r\n     was for a long time famous as the chief post on the northern\r\n     coast of Tierra Firme through which passed the merchandise\r\n     from Spain and the gold from Peru. Says Benzoni, _Hist. Mondo\r\n     Nvovo_, 79: 'Questa Città stà situata nel mare di Tramontana.\r\n     Sogliono adunque communemente ogn'anno andare di Spagna al\r\n     Nome di Dio, da quattordici, ò quindici naui, fra piccole,\r\n     e grande, e la maggior porterà mille, e ottocento salme;\r\n     cariche di robbe diuerse.' Dampier about a century later found\r\n     the spot where the city had stood overgrown with trees. Its\r\n     abandonment was owing to poisoned air, the same unwholesome\r\n     climate that broke up all the early settlements on this coast,\r\n     the last being always regarded as the worst.\r\n\r\n     [VI-15] The original authorities for this chapter are: _Real\r\n     Cédula_, etc., in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 116;\r\n     _Memorial presentado al Rey por Rodrigo de Colmenares_, in\r\n     _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 387; _Las Casas_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, ii. 61; _Oviedo_, ii. 465-78; _Noticias biográficas\r\n     del capitan Alonso Hojeda_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_,\r\n     iii. 163; _Gomara_, _Hist.

It is now known as Punta Arenas.\r\n     Some maps make two points, and give one of the names to each.\r\n\r\n     [VII-2] Oviedo, ii. 426, says that, with the assistance of\r\n     one Hurtado, Vasco Nuñez was hidden in a ship's sail.\r\n\r\n     [VII-3] 'Der Name _Darien_ (_Dariena_, oder _Tarena_) scheint\r\n     zunächst mit dem indianischen Namen des grossen Flusses\r\n     Atrato, welcher sich in den Golf von Uraba ausgiesst, seinen\r\n     Anfang genommen zu haben. Der erste Eroberer, der in diesen\r\n     Golf einsegelte, war Bastidas 1501. Ob er schon den Fluss\r\n     Darien gesehen und den Namen nach Europa gebracht hat, ist\r\n     ungewiss. Gewiss ist es, das der Name des Flusses Darien\r\n     bereits in den Dokumenten und Theilungspakten zwischen Nicuesa\r\n     und Ojeda in Jahre 1509 genannt wird.' _Kohl_, _Die Beiden\r\n     ältesten General-karten von Amerika_, 116. On Peter Martyr's\r\n     map, _India beyond the Ganges_, 1510, is _tariene_; on the\r\n     globe of Orontius, 1531, the gulf is called _Sinus vraba_,\r\n     the river _vrabe_, and the Isthmus _furna dariena_. Salvat de\r\n     Pilestrina, _Munich Atlas_, no. iv., 1515, places on the west\r\n     side of the gulf of Urabá the word _dariem_. Maiollo, _Munich\r\n     Atlas_, no. v., 1519, calls the place _daryen_; Fernando\r\n     Colon, 1527, writes _darien_; Diego de Ribero, 1529, _dariẽ_;\r\n     _Munich Atlas_, no. vi., 1532-40, _dariem_; Vaz Dourado,\r\n     1571, _dariem_; Robert Thorne, in _Hakluyt's Voy._, _Darion_;\r\n     _Mercator's Atlas_, 1569; _West-Indische Spieghel_, 1624;\r\n     _Ogilby's Map of America_, 1671; Dampier, 1699, and subsequent\r\n     cartographers give the present form.\r\n\r\n     [VII-4] Ogilby, _Am._, 66, entertains a dim conception of the\r\n     fact when he says, 'Ancisus pursuing, found in a Thicket of\r\n     Canes, or Reeds a great Treasure of Gold.'\r\n\r\n     [VII-5] 'De que hoy no quedan ni vestigios,' says Acosta.\r\n     Nor do I find laid down on any map in my possession the town\r\n     of Santa María, or Antigua, or Darien, by which names this\r\n     place has been severally designated. Puerto Hermoso, placed\r\n     by Colon at the south-western extremity of the gulf of Urabá,\r\n     _p: hermosso_, and also by Ribero, _po hmoso_, is supposed to\r\n     have been the anchorage of Enciso and the harbor of Antigua.\r\n     Oviedo, i. 4, in endeavoring to fasten upon the place the\r\n     name _La Guardia_, confuses himself beyond extrication. 'En\r\n     la cibdad del Darien (que tambien se llamó antes la Guardia)\r\n     é despues santa Maria del Antigua.'\r\n\r\n     [VII-6] _Carta dirigida al Rey por Vasco Nuñez de Balboa desde\r\n     Santa María del Darien, 20 de Enero de 1513_, in _Navarrete_,\r\n     _Col. de Viages_, iii. 358. That Enciso has been properly\r\n     represented as a vain and shallow man is proved by a reference\r\n     to his book, _Suma de Geographia_, 2, wherein he does not\r\n     hesitate to patronize the boy-emperor 'whose youth had not\r\n     permitted him to read much of geography.' 'Por tanto yo Martin\r\n     Fernandez de Enciso alguazil mayor dela tierra firme delas\r\n     Indias ocidentales llamada castilla dl oro. Desseando hazer\r\n     algun seruicio a vuestra. s. c. c. m. que le fuesse agradable\r\n     y no menos prouechoso, cõsiderando que la poca edad de vuestra\r\n     real alteza no ha dado lugar a que pudiesse leer los libros\r\n     que dela geographia hablan.' And that he was as beastly in\r\n     his bigotry and cruelty as his less learned companions we\r\n     may know from what he himself wrote the king, _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 449, about the caciques who kept\r\n     men dressed as women, and used as such, 'and when I took\r\n     Darien, we seized and burned them, and when the women saw\r\n     them burning they manifested joy.'

In\r\n     new discoveries, when the chief of the expedition had not\r\n     contracted with the king for the appointing of authorities,\r\n     the settlers met and elected one or more alcaldes and\r\n     regidores. The alcalde, in the absence of the governor or\r\n     military chief, presided over the municipal council, composed\r\n     of regidores who governed the municipality, or _regimiento_,\r\n     as it was then called. The alcalde was also the executive\r\n     power, exercising the functions of judge, with original\r\n     jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal, those relating\r\n     to the natives excepted. In the absence of the adelantado he\r\n     was therefore chief in authority, and when the governor was\r\n     present, the alcalde was second. Alcaldes in new settlements,\r\n     and in early times, were different from those created later.\r\n     Their duties covered the emergency. In the present instance,\r\n     had Enciso continued to exercise the office of alcalde mayor,\r\n     regidores might still have been elected to attend to the\r\n     affairs of the municipality, in which case no alcaldes would\r\n     have been elected, for Enciso himself would have presided.\r\n\r\n     [VII-8] Regidores, or members of the municipal council,\r\n     were elected by the residents of a ward or district. Cities\r\n     were entitled to twelve, towns to six, and villages or small\r\n     settlements were limited to three or even less.\r\n\r\n     [VII-9] The name of a Spanish settlement midway between\r\n     Cape de la Vela and Cartagena, and sometimes applied to the\r\n     territory in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n     [VII-10] The _procurador de la ciudad_, called afterward\r\n     _síndico procurador_, and later still _síndico_, was an\r\n     officer of the municipal council, whose duty it was to see\r\n     the city ordinances enforced, bring suit for and defend the\r\n     city in any suit, performing the functions of city attorney,\r\n     beside having a seat in the common council of the city.\r\n\r\n     [VII-11] Benzoni asserts that after leaving Antigua, Nicuesa\r\n     followed the coast for some distance, but landing one day for\r\n     water, he was seized by cannibals, who captured the vessel\r\n     and devoured the men. 'E cosi Niquesa molto dolente se ne\r\n     parti, e per quella costa andando salto in terra per piglior\r\n     acqua, e su da paesani ucciso, e poi mangiato con tutti i\r\n     suoi compagni, e questo su la fine della vita di Diego di\r\n     Niquesa, con la sua armata di Veragua.' _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_,\r\n     i. 47. A story was current for a time that they had been\r\n     thrown on Cuba, where all perished, leaving inscribed upon\r\n     a tree, 'Here ended the unfortunate Nicuesa.' Las Casas and\r\n     Herrera, however, are of opinion that his vessel foundered\r\n     at sea. 'Algunos imaginaron que aportò a Cuba, y que los\r\n     Indios le mataron, porque andando ciertos Castellanos por la\r\n     isla hallarõ escrito en un arbol: Aqui feneciò el desdichado\r\n     Nicuesa: pero esto se tuvo por los hombres mas verdaderos, por\r\n     falso, porque los primeros que entraron en Cuba, afermaron\r\n     nunca aver oydo tal nueva. Lo que se tuvo por mas cierto,\r\n     es, que como llenava tan mal navio, y las mares de aquellas\r\n     partes son ton bravas, y vehementes, la mesma mar lo tragara\r\n     facilmente, o que pereceria de hãbre, y de sed.' _Herrera_, i.\r\n     viii. viii. But his fate must forever remain a mystery; and\r\n     he one among the many whose visionary hopes have been buried\r\n     beneath these waters; one among the many who, having left home\r\n     with sanguine expectations, sailed over these seas in quest\r\n     of gold or adventure, never again to be heard from! It is\r\n     easy, after a failure, to find the mistake. Many of Nicuesa's\r\n     misfortunes sprang not from any fault, and yet faults, in\r\n     place of nobler qualities, were developed by his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-1] Oviedo, ii. 477, is obviously wrong in saying over\r\n     six hundred.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-2] 'Il Baccelliero non poteva mostrare le Reali sue\r\n     prouisioni per bauerle per dute nella naue, che si ruppe nel\r\n     Golfo d'Vraua.' _Benzoni_, _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_, i. 47. There\r\n     were those who told Peter Martyr that Enciso was thus punished\r\n     by providence for having advised the expulsion of Nicuesa.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-3] Martin Fernandez de Enciso first came to the Indies\r\n     with Bastidas. After practising law for a time successfully\r\n     at Santo Domingo, he was tempted to this expedition, as\r\n     we have seen, by Ojeda, upon the promise of the office of\r\n     alcalde mayor. Though a pettifogger in his profession, he\r\n     was nevertheless possessed of worth and ability in other\r\n     directions. In Darien, while in the main well meaning, he\r\n     was unable to cope successfully with shrewder intellects\r\n     sharpened by New World experiences. After his return to Spain\r\n     he published a work, entitled _Suma de geografiã q̃ trata de\r\n     todas las partidas & prouincias del mundo: en especial de las\r\n     indias, y trata largamẽte del arte del marear: Juntamete con\r\n     la esphera en romãce: con el regimiento del Sol & del norte:\r\n     nueuamente hecha_. As the title indicates, the book purports\r\n     to be a compendium of universal geography, treating of all\r\n     parts of the world, but including the little that was then\r\n     known of the Indies. That part relating to the New World was\r\n     made up in a great measure from his own observations. And\r\n     yet it resembles too nearly the usual summaries of the period\r\n     to be of much value. The first third of the work is devoted\r\n     to the science of geography, with astronomical tables and a\r\n     résumé of early Spanish history. Then the physical features of\r\n     Spain, and Europe generally, are given, and finally a rambling\r\n     account of Asia, Africa, and America. It was printed at\r\n     Seville by a German, Jakob Cromberger, in 1519. Other editions\r\n     appeared in 1530 and 1546. My edition is dated 1530, the part\r\n     relating to America occupying the last eight folios of the\r\n     book. Bibliographers believe this the first book relative to\r\n     the New World printed in the Spanish language. 'Livre curieux,\r\n     parce qu'il est le premièr traité de géographie impr. en\r\n     Espagne, où l'on trouve des détails sur l'Amérique.' _Brunet_,\r\n     _Manuel du Libraire_. 'Apparently the first book printed in\r\n     Spanish relating to America.' _Rich_, _Bibliotheca Americana\r\n     Vetus_. 'L'ouvrage rare et très remarquable.' _Humboldt_,\r\n     _Examen Critique_, iv. 306. 'A great hydrographer and\r\n     explorer, his work is invaluable for the early geographical\r\n     history of the continent.' _Harrisse_, _Bibliotheca Americana\r\n     Vetustissima_. Navarrete says: 'Escribió Enciso un papel muy\r\n     curioso sobre si los conquistadores españoles podian tener y\r\n     poseer indios encomendados, contra los frailes dominicos que\r\n     decian que no, y se opusieron al despacho de la expedicion de\r\n     Pedrarias Dávila, so pretexto de que el Rey no podia enviar\r\n     á hacer tales conquistas.' And in his _Epitome_, Pinelo\r\n     remarks: 'Trata en su _Suma Geografia_ del Arte de Navegar,\r\n     de la Esfera, y de las quatro partes del Mundo, especialmente\r\n     de las Indias, i es el primero que imprimió _Obra Geografica_\r\n     de ellas.' Indeed, this last was said in 1738, and subsequent\r\n     bibliographers have repeated it.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-4] For definition see chapter xv. note 1, this volume.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-5] It was the _cárcel_, whether jail or pen. In newly\r\n     settled towns, and in some country villages where jails were\r\n     not built, it was customary to construct a small enclosure on\r\n     the plaza near the _casa consistorial_, or municipal hall, in\r\n     which to confine prisoners till sent to the capital of the\r\n     province, or elsewhere, for trial. Those convicted of petty\r\n     municipal offences were likewise incarcerated in this pen.\r\n     Inside were stocks, the better to secure great offenders.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-6] In popular parlance, _acogerse á santuario_, or\r\n     _acogerse á sagrado_, or _tomar iglesia_, the protection\r\n     afforded criminals who sought refuge in a church or other\r\n     sacred asylum. As we shall often meet with the custom in this\r\n     history I will state briefly what it was. It is well known\r\n     that from the earliest times, in both heathen and Jewish\r\n     societies, the right of asylum, or right of sanctuary, has\r\n     existed, in degrees more or less modified by time, down to\r\n     the present day. In Spanish-America it was in vogue as late\r\n     as a quarter of a century ago. Originally the idea implied\r\n     the right of appeal from the judgment of men to the justice\r\n     of God. The Creator himself, it is said, set the example\r\n     by placing a mark on Cain, the first murderer, that none\r\n     might kill him; and Moses and Joshua, under divine sanction,\r\n     established cities of refuge, whither certain involuntary\r\n     offenders might flee and find safety. Later, the founders of\r\n     cities offered asylum to outlaws for the purpose of increasing\r\n     the population. To this custom is attributed in a measure the\r\n     existence, or at least the importance, of Athens, Thebes, and\r\n     other cities. Instead of making the whole city an asylum, a\r\n     certain locality was sometimes assigned for that purpose;\r\n     thus tradition says that one of the first acts of Romulus\r\n     preparatory to building his city was to set apart Palatine\r\n     Hill as a place of refuge. Sacred groves were asylums; also\r\n     temples to the gods, and religious houses. Notably the groves\r\n     of the Grecians, and the Erechtheium of Athens, the temple\r\n     of Artemis at Ephesus, and that of Apollon at Miletus. With\r\n     the advent of Christianity, to increase their influence, the\r\n     clergy secured this privilege for their churches. In the time\r\n     of Constantine all Christian churches afforded refuge, and\r\n     Theodosius II. included in this right all houses belonging to\r\n     the church, with their courts and gardens. In France and Spain\r\n     not only the church and its surroundings afforded protection,\r\n     but all chapels, cloisters, abbeys, monasteries, cemeteries,\r\n     tombs, crosses, and in short all religious monuments.\r\n     Frequently a stone bench, called the stone of peace, was\r\n     placed for refugees within the church near the altar. The\r\n     priests assured the people that they would be visited by\r\n     dire calamities if they violated this right. Gradually,\r\n     however, the practice diminished. Though the culprit must\r\n     not be forcibly dragged from the church, he might be enticed\r\n     thence, or starved out, or smoked out. Then the more abhorred\r\n     criminals, as heretics and murderers, were denied protection;\r\n     and the number of places was reduced. Clement XIV., in 1772,\r\n     limited the number to one or two in each town, though no one\r\n     sheltered by the roof of a church might be torn thence without\r\n     an order from the ecclesiastical judge. The right of churches\r\n     to extend protection over minor offenders was recognized long\r\n     after it became the custom for the clergy to deliver rank\r\n     offenders for punishment. The superstition was respected, as\r\n     we have seen, in the wilds of the New World by the distempered\r\n     colonists of Darien. Nor was England free from it; to this day\r\n     there are places in France, and in Scotland, Holyrood abbey\r\n     and palace, where a debtor may not be arrested. For a good\r\n     treatise on right of sanctuary, and on immunity of religious\r\n     persons and places, see _Vazquez_, _Chronica de Gvat._, 288\r\n     et seq.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-7] Peter Martyr, dec. ii. cap. iv., thinks Valdivia\r\n     carried away 300 pounds of gold. In the words of his\r\n     quaint English translator:—'This pound of eight ounces, the\r\n     Spanyardes call Marcha, whiche in weight amounteth to fiftie\r\n     pieces of golde called Castellani, but the Castilians call\r\n     a pound Pesum. We conclude therefore, that the summe hereof,\r\n     was xv. thousande of those peeces of gold called Castellani.\r\n     And thus is it apparent by this accompt, that they receiued of\r\n     the barbarous kings a thousande and fyue hundred poundes, of\r\n     eight ounces to the pounde: all the whiche they founde readie\r\n     wrought in sundry kindes of ouches, as cheynes, braselets,\r\n     tabletes, and plates, both to hang before their brestes, and\r\n     also at their eares, and nosethrils.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-8] Quintana thinks the amount was too small, or that it\r\n     never reached him; for as events unfolded Pasamonte proved\r\n     himself no less friendly to Enciso than hostile to Vasco\r\n     Nuñez. It seems never to occur to a Spaniard that a public\r\n     officer could refuse a bribe. As it was, Pasamonte did favor\r\n     Vasco Nuñez.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-9] We shall see everywhere, from Darien to Alaska,\r\n     Indian towns and provinces frequently called by the name of\r\n     the ruling chief. For instance, adventurers and geographers\r\n     who knew only the chief's name, called his village Careta's\r\n     village, or Careta; his country, Careta's country, or Careta.\r\n     Maiollo, 1519, writes on his map, where the province of Careta\r\n     should be, _aldea de machin_; and adjacent north-west, _P.\r\n     scatozes_. Vaz Dourado, _Munich Atlas_, nos. x. and xi., 1571,\r\n     labels the province _careta_; De Laet, 1633, gives _Careta_;\r\n     Jefferys, 1776, _Pta Carata_; and Kiepert, 1858, _Pto\r\n     Carreto_. Alcedo mentions the river _Careti_. 'De la Provincia\r\n     y Gobierno del Darien y Reyno de Tierra-Firme: nace en las\r\n     montañas del N. y sale al mar en la Ensenada de Mandinga.'\r\n\r\n     [VIII-10] Map-makers give—Vaz Dourado, _comogra_, De Laet,\r\n     _Comagre_, and _Pta de Comagre_, 'which according to\r\n     Keipert,' says Goldschmidt, _Cartography Pac. Coast_, MS. i.\r\n     67; 'as near as I can determine, is now _P. Mosquitos_.'\r\n\r\n     [VIII-11] Peter Martyr, dec. ii. cap. iii., says this building\r\n     measured 150 by 80 paces. See _Bancroft's Native Races_, i.\r\n     758.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-12] 'Estas palabras célebres,' says Quintana,\r\n     'conservadas en todas las memorias del tiempo, y repetidas\r\n     por todos los historiadores, fueron el primer anuncio que los\r\n     españoles tuvieron del Perú.' _Vasco Nuñez de Balboa_, 13. To\r\n     which I would remark, first, that it is not certain Panciaco\r\n     referred to Peru; and secondly, that vague allusions of a\r\n     similar kind were made to Columbus, which historians apply to\r\n     Peru.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-13] This on the authority of Herrera. Gomara places the\r\n     king's fifth at 20,000 ducats, and Bernal Diaz at 10,000 pesos\r\n     de oro.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-14] The strange story of Aguilar is given by _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 21-22; _Torquemada_, i. 371; _Cogolludo_, _Hist.\r\n     Yucathan_, 24-9; and by _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. v.\r\n     He was kept seven years in this captivity.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-15] The name is variously rendered _Dabaybe_, _Dabaibe_,\r\n     _Davaive_, _Daibaba_, _Abibe_, _Abibeja_, and _d'abaibe_.\r\n     'Auch der Rio Atrato wurde nicht selten _Rio Dabeyba_ genannt.\r\n     Das 'D' im Anfang dieses Namens ist nur eine Abbreviatur\r\n     von 'de,' und das Wort sollte wohl eigentlich: _d'Abaibe_\r\n     geschrieben werden.' _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten karten_,\r\n     125. Maps mark the region, Colon and Ribero, _dabaybe_, at\r\n     the southern extremity of the gulf, and De Laet gives the\r\n     _Montanas de Abibe_.\r\n\r\n     [VIII-16] The Atrato discharges through several channels, one\r\n     of which was called the Rio del Darien; one the Rio Grande de\r\n     San Juan; one the Rio de las Redes, from the snares or nets\r\n     found there for taking wild beasts; one the Rio Negro, from\r\n     the color of its water. Often the Spaniards had scoured these\r\n     parts in search of food and gold.\r\n\r\n     [IX-1] Galvano says 290, which for him is quite near the mark.\r\n     Oviedo places the number at 800, which probably was intended\r\n     to include the natives afterward added.\r\n\r\n     [IX-2] The Spaniards must have had quite accurate information\r\n     from the natives as to the trend of the southern coast, though\r\n     there was then little communication between the northern\r\n     and southern seaboards. But, without such knowledge, Balboa\r\n     naturally would have undertaken the ascent of the river\r\n     Atrato, which flows directly from the south, rather than have\r\n     sailed some distance to the north-west before attempting to\r\n     cross. The direct march to the gulf of San Miguel, from which\r\n     course a deviation would have almost doubled the distance,\r\n     is another evidence of his having obtained the most reliable\r\n     information before or during the march.\r\n\r\n     [IX-3] Enciso, _Suma de Geographia_, 57, calls the country\r\n     'tierra rasa y buena de muchos mãtenimientos y caças.'\r\n     'Experience had proved that moving a body of men sufficient\r\n     to act as a protecting force and to carry the necessary\r\n     provisions was attended with great risk and great delay.'\r\n     _Gisborne's Survey of Darien_, in _London Geog. Soc., Jour._,\r\n     xxvii. 193. 'Mr Hopkins was lately prevented by the Indians\r\n     from ascending the Chepo river towards Mandinga, or San Blas\r\n     Bay; and Dr Cullen was stopped likewise by the aborigines\r\n     while endeavoring to ascend the Paya river.... _Climate_ and\r\n     _natives_ are at present the only serious impediments to a\r\n     regular survey.' _Fitz-Roy's Isth. Cent. Am._, in _London\r\n     Geog. Soc., Jour._, xx. 161. 'The Panama railroad, a most\r\n     stupendous work, considering the excessively swampy nature\r\n     of the country over which it has been carried.' _Cullen's\r\n     Darien_, 95. For obstacles overcome in surveying and\r\n     constructing the Panamá railway, see _Otis' Isthmus Panama_,\r\n     15-36. The climate inclines 'to the wet extreme, for two\r\n     thirds of the year, the Rains beginning in _April_.' _Defence\r\n     of the Scots Settlement at Darien_, 64. On the Atrato 'the\r\n     trees approach to the very edge of the stream, which their\r\n     branches overhang. The trees are frequently concealed by\r\n     dense masses of vines which entirely envelope them, and in\r\n     certain lights present plays of color comparable only to\r\n     those of the richest velvet.... But like the plumes and velvet\r\n     of the funeral pageant, they serve but to conceal and adorn\r\n     corruption. Behind them stretches, far away, the pestiferous\r\n     swamp, through the dreary wilds of which even the birds refuse\r\n     to sport; and whose silence is broken only by the sighing of\r\n     the breeze, or the sullen growl of the roving tiger. Venomous\r\n     reptiles often fall into the boats from the branches overhead;\r\n     wasps' nests are frequent and troublesome; natural levees\r\n     of soft mud stretch along the banks. Floods are common, and\r\n     the houses are built on stilts.' _Trautwine_, in _Franklin\r\n     Inst., Jour._, xxvii. 220-4. In 1853, Carl Scherzer, a German\r\n     naturalist, travelling in Costa Rica with a civil engineer and\r\n     a force of thirty-two men, attempted to make a survey for a\r\n     road from Angostura to Limon Bay; but on account of scarcity\r\n     of provisions, illness, and the difficulties of the route,\r\n     they failed in their purpose; and after having penetrated to\r\n     within eight leagues of their destination, they were obliged\r\n     to return, having travelled only ten leagues in two weeks.\r\n     See _Wagner and Scherzer_, _Costa Rica_, 358-407. In December\r\n     of the same year, a party under J. C. Prevost, of H. M. S.\r\n     _Virago_, set out with fourteen days' provisions from the gulf\r\n     of San Miguel for Caledonia Bay, on the opposite side of the\r\n     Isthmus. Their route was essentially that of Vasco Nuñez on\r\n     his return. As he ascended the Sabana River, the attention of\r\n     Captain Prevost was attracted by the débris on the overhanging\r\n     branches, which marked the height of water attained during\r\n     certain seasons. The dense foliage was enlivened by birds\r\n     of gay plumage; brilliant flowers carpeted the ground; and\r\n     the chattering monkeys, which they shot in great numbers,\r\n     furnished the guides food. The country even then was as wild\r\n     as when traversed by Vasco Nuñez; the natives, however, had\r\n     exchanged their wooden weapons for fire-arms. Swamps and\r\n     hills alternate, and 'dense was the forest we had cut our way\r\n     through.' The flora then changed, and 'instead of the small\r\n     underwood, we came on almost impenetrable thickets of the\r\n     prickly palm or aloe, rather more than six feet in height,\r\n     through which we with great difficulty cut our way.' They\r\n     crossed 'deep ravines, whose steep and slippery sides caused\r\n     many a tumble.' The attempt was finally abandoned. Returning,\r\n     on arriving at one of their ranchos or encampments, where had\r\n     been left three sailors to guard the provisions, they found\r\n     the men murdered and the camp sacked. 'So toilsome was our\r\n     journey,' says Captain Prevost, 'that we spent fifteen days in\r\n     performing a distance of little more than twenty-six miles,\r\n     having to force our slow and laborious path through forests\r\n     that seemed to stretch from the Pacific to the Atlantic\r\n     shores. The trees, of stupendous size, were matted with\r\n     creepers and parasitical vines, which hung in festoons from\r\n     tree to tree, forming an almost impenetrable net-work, and\r\n     obliging us to hew open a passage with our axes every step\r\n     we advanced.' _London Geog. Soc., Jour._, xxiv. 249. Nothing\r\n     could more aptly illustrate the difficulties surmounted by the\r\n     Spaniards than this narrative of failure, by a British officer\r\n     of the nineteenth century, who operated under conditions\r\n     far more favorable than those so successfully overcome by a\r\n     company of ill-accoutred and poorly fed adventurers more than\r\n     three hundred years before. With the material before me, these\r\n     illustrations could be greatly multiplied; but I have given\r\n     enough to show that the transit of the Isthmus, by a small\r\n     party of Europeans, over an unknown or unexplored route, is\r\n     even to-day esteemed a desperate undertaking.\r\n\r\n     [IX-4] _Carta dirigida al Rey por Vasco Nuñez de Balboa desde\r\n     Santa María del Darien_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_,\r\n     iii. 368.\r\n\r\n     [IX-5] A strategy which continues through the centuries. 'The\r\n     Indians, although offering no direct hostility, abandoned\r\n     their villages at our approach.' _Gisborne's Survey of\r\n     Darien_, _London Geog. Soc., Jour._, xxvii. 193.\r\n\r\n     [IX-6] Among the dogs which accompanied the expedition\r\n     was one, the property of the commander, whose pedigree and\r\n     physical and metaphysical traits and mighty deeds are minutely\r\n     recorded by contemporary historians. His name was Leoncico,\r\n     little lion, descendant of Becerrico, of the Island of San\r\n     Juan. He was in color red with black snout, of medium size and\r\n     extraordinary strength. In their foragings Leoncico counted\r\n     as one man, and drew captain's pay and share of spoils.\r\n     Upon these conditions his master frequently loaned him; and\r\n     during the wars of Darien he gained for Vasco Nuñez more than\r\n     one thousand pesos de oro. He was considered more efficient\r\n     than the best soldier, and the savages stood in the greatest\r\n     terror of him. He readily discriminated between wild and\r\n     tame Indians. When a captive was missing from the fields, and\r\n     Leoncico was told, 'He is gone; seek him!' the dog tracked the\r\n     poor fugitive, and did not harm him if he returned quietly,\r\n     but if the Indian resisted, the dog would destroy him. The\r\n     hero of many a conflict, he was covered with wounds; but like\r\n     Cæsar he escaped the wars to meet his death by treacherous\r\n     hands. He was poisoned. See _Oviedo_, iii. 9-10.\r\n\r\n     [IX-7] Again a general difference occurs in an important date,\r\n     and, according to my custom, I am governed by the authorities\r\n     I deem most reliable. Oviedo follows the expedition from day\r\n     to day, noting places and dates; and he says, iii. 10: 'Y un\r\n     mártes, veynte é cinco de septiembre de aquel año de mill é\r\n     quinientos y trece, á las diez horas del dia,' at 10 o'clock\r\n     in the morning. So Gomara also writes, _Hist. Ind._, 77: 'Vio\r\n     Valboa ala mar del Sur a los veynte y cinco del Setiembre\r\n     del año de treze;' and Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 109:\r\n     'Llegaron á la cumbre de las más altas sierras á 25 dias de\r\n     Setiembre de dicho año de 1513;' and Herrera, i. x. i.: 'A\r\n     veynte y cinco de Setiembre, deste año, de donde la mar se\r\n     parecia.' Careful writers following these first authorities\r\n     also name the day correctly, as Humboldt, _Exam. Crit._, i.\r\n     319, who says: 'Vasco Nuñez de Balboa vit la Mer du Sud, le 25\r\n     septembre 1513, du haut de la Sierra de Quarequa;' and Acosta,\r\n     _Compend. Hist. Nueva Granada_, 50: 'Esto pasó el dia 25 de\r\n     setiembre del año de 1513 poco antes de medio dia y forma una\r\n     de las épocas notables en el descubrimiento de la América;'\r\n     and Quintana, _Vidas de Españoles Célebres_, 'Balboa,' 20: '25\r\n     de setiembre;' and Chevalier, _L'Isthme de Panama_, 15: 'Le\r\n     vingt-cinquième jour, le 25 septembre;' and Campbell, _Hist.\r\n     Span. Am._, 23: 'the 25th of _Septembre_;' and Helps, _Span.\r\n     Conq._, i. 361: '25th of September;' etc. In the face of\r\n     which, Irving, _Columbus_, iii. 198, shows gross carelessness\r\n     when he writes 'the 26th of September.' To support him he has\r\n     Ramusio, who, _Viaggi_, iii. 29, falls into a mistake of Peter\r\n     Martyr's, 'alli ventisei adunque di Settembre,' and Du Perier,\r\n     _Cen. Hist. Voy._, 139, and, to copy his error, Dalton,\r\n     _Conq. Mex. and Peru_, 43, and a host of others. Not quite\r\n     so often mentioned as Columbus' voyages is this discovery\r\n     of Vasco Nuñez, though nearly so. After Oviedo and Las Casas\r\n     probably Peter Martyr gives the best original account. Herrera\r\n     copied from all before him. The following popular accounts\r\n     are most of them meagre and unreliable:—_Nouvelles An. des\r\n     Voy._, cxlviii. 11-12; _Goodrich's Man upon the Sea_, 201-8;\r\n     _Voyages, New Col._, i. 180-6; _World Displayed_, i. 153-9;\r\n     _Monson's Tracts_, in _Churchill's Voy._, iii. 372; _March y\r\n     Labores_, _Marina Española_, i. 413-50; _Dufey_, _Résumé Hist.\r\n     Am._, i. 75-86; _Gottfriedt_, _Newe Welt_, 239-41; _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._, 122; _Montanus_, _Nieuwe Weereld_, 66-72; _Ogilby's\r\n     Am._, 69-72; _Norman's Hist.

Irving refers to Herrera, but fails\r\n     to reproduce him correctly in his text. Compare _Oviedo_, iii.\r\n     11-12; _Herrera_, i. x. ii.\r\n\r\n     [IX-10] The form of taking possession, or the declaration of\r\n     proprietary rights to the lands seized by Europeans, as we\r\n     have seen, differs with different discoverers, and with the\r\n     same discoverer at different times. Sometimes mass was said;\r\n     sometimes a cross was erected; sometimes prayer was offered,\r\n     of which the following is said to have been the prescribed\r\n     form used by Columbus, Vasco Nuñez, Cortés, and Pizarro:\r\n     Domine Deus æterne et omnipotens, sacro tuo verbo cœlum, et\r\n     terram, et mare creâsti; benedicatur et glorificetur nomen\r\n     tuum, laudetur tua majestas, quæ dignita est per humilem\r\n     servum tuum, ut ejus sacrum nomen agnoscatur, et prædicetur\r\n     in hac altera mundi parte. But always this seizure, whether\r\n     by Spanish, English, French, or Dutch, and by whatsoever other\r\n     formalities attended, was accompanied by a loud proclamation,\r\n     before God and man, of the deed then and there consummated.\r\n     This proclamation was made with drawn sword, by the commander\r\n     of the party taking possession, and sometimes attended by\r\n     the throwing of earth toward the four cardinal points, as\r\n     was common, and is now in Spanish America, in giving judicial\r\n     possession in granting lands, and planting the royal standard.\r\n     All present were called upon to witness the act, which was\r\n     done for and in the name of the sovereign authority recognized\r\n     by the party. Then the notary, or, if none were present, a\r\n     clerk, or a person or persons appointed to act as such, took\r\n     down in writing what had been done, and each member of the\r\n     party signed it. Examples might be multiplied indefinitely.\r\n     We have seen what Columbus did in one or two instances, and\r\n     how Vasco Nuñez conducted himself on the mountain overlooking\r\n     Panamá Bay. That which I have just given in the text is a\r\n     literal translation of Balboa's address to the four corners\r\n     of the Pacific Ocean as reported by _Oviedo_, iii. 11-12. At\r\n     the beginning the meaning of the orator is clear enough, but\r\n     toward the latter part he lapses into verbiage. It is likely\r\n     that he had in view, while taking possession of that sea or so\r\n     much of it as his sovereigns should at any future time please\r\n     to claim, the papal bull which divided the heathen world\r\n     between Spain and Portugal, and a desire to avoid all words\r\n     and acts which might prejudice the Spanish claim. A lengthy\r\n     account is given of the taking possession of the province of\r\n     Paque, on the Pacific shore of the Isthmus, west of Panamá,\r\n     in 1519, by Pedrarias Dávila. The party was standing at the\r\n     head of an inlet, two notaries, a clergyman, several captains,\r\n     soldiers, and seamen, beside the commander, being present.\r\n     First, Pedrarias called on the notaries and all present to\r\n     witness the acts he was about to perform. Then he took in\r\n     his right hand a white silk flag, on which was represented\r\n     the image of the Virgin Mary, and holding it aloft all knelt;\r\n     the trumpet sounded, and in loud tones the commander offered\r\n     the following prayer: 'Oh! mother of God, quiet the sea, and\r\n     render us worthy of being and of moving under thy protection.\r\n     May it please thee that under it we may discover these seas,\r\n     and lands of the southern sea, and convert the people thereof\r\n     to our holy Catholic faith.' Following the prayer was a long\r\n     speech by Pedrarias, declaring possession after the usual\r\n     form, similar to that employed by Vasco Nuñez, interspersed\r\n     with divers acts in consummation of what he said. He declared\r\n     the possession previously taken renewed, especially the\r\n     'possession _vel casi_ of all the coast of the new land and\r\n     of the southern sea, and of all the ports and inlets and\r\n     coves and roadsteads ... being as I am, in the name of their\r\n     highnesses and as their lieutenant-general in the said coast\r\n     of the said southern sea, from the stones of the rivers to\r\n     the leaves of the forests, eating the grass and drinking the\r\n     waters, and razing, devastating, and cutting the woods of the\r\n     said coast, upon the said site and province of Paque.' As a\r\n     token of possession and seizure thereof, civilly, naturally,\r\n     and bodily, he continued: 'I raise this royal standard of the\r\n     said Queen Doña Juana and King Don Cárlos, her son, our lords,\r\n     which is of red damask having thereon painted and stamped the\r\n     royal arms of their highnesses the said kings, our lords;' the\r\n     trumpeters were then ordered to sound; after which, in concert\r\n     with Pedrarias, all said, 'Castilla del Oro and Tierra Firme,\r\n     and new land, and southern sea, and coasts thereof, and island\r\n     and islands, and all land and provinces that may be therein,\r\n     for the most high and most illustrious Queen Doña Juana, our\r\n     lady, and the King Don Cárlos, her son, our lord; and after\r\n     them for their successors to Castile.' 'All of which new lands\r\n     and southern sea and coast thereof and the whole Tierra Firme\r\n     and kingdoms of Castilla del Oro, and all thereunto annexed\r\n     and appertaining, and all that has been or may be hereafter\r\n     discovered therein, is and must be of the royal crown of\r\n     Castile, and you must testify how I, Pedrarias Dávila, in the\r\n     name of the said kings, our lords, and of their successors\r\n     to the royal crown of Castile, cut trees, and mow the grass\r\n     in said land, and enter the water of the said southern sea,\r\n     corporeally and standing on my feet therein, and stamp the new\r\n     land and waters of the said southern sea.' Again the trumpets\r\n     were sounded, and again Pedrarias reiterated in a loud voice\r\n     his claims; and he called upon the notaries to witness as\r\n     further proof of their possession that four ships had been\r\n     built and navigated on the southern sea. Another flourish of\r\n     trumpets, and by way of doxology three times repeated, 'Viva\r\n     la muy alta é muy poderosa reyna doña Juana,' etc., concluded\r\n     the ceremony. _Testimonio de un acto de posesion que tomó el\r\n     Gobernador Pedrárias Dávila_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 549-56. Although the custom was universal\r\n     from the beginning, Philip II. deemed best to decree, in\r\n     1568, that all captains or others discovering any island or\r\n     mainland should, on landing, take possession in the king's\r\n     name. _Recop. de Indias_, ii. 7.\r\n\r\n     [IX-11] Colon gives _g. de san migel_; Agnese, _G. de S.\r\n     miguell_; Vaz Dourado, _Saö migell_; Mercator, _S. Miguel_;\r\n     Hondius, in _Drake's World Encompassed_, _Michael_; _Ogilby's\r\n     Am._, _G. S. Miguel_; Jacob Colom, _G. del S. Miguel_;\r\n     Jefferys, _G. de St. Miguel_, and emptying into it _R. Canty_,\r\n     _R. Savanas_, _R. Congo_.\r\n\r\n     [IX-12] It was not for some years after this discovery that\r\n     the name Pacific was applied to any part of the ocean; and\r\n     for a long time after parts only of it were so termed, this\r\n     part of it retained the original name of South Sea, so called\r\n     because it lay to the south of its discoverer. The lettering\r\n     of the early maps is here significant. All along from this\r\n     time to the middle of the seventeenth century, the larger\r\n     part of the Pacific was labeled _Oceanus Indicus Orientalis_,\r\n     or _Mar del Sur_, the Atlantic, opposite the Isthmus, being\r\n     called _Mar del Norte_. Sometimes the reporters called the\r\n     South Sea _La Otra Mar_, in contradistinction to the _Mare\r\n     Oceanus_ of Juan de la Cosa, or the _Oceanus Occidentalis_\r\n     of Ptolemy, as the Atlantic was then called. Indeed, the\r\n     Atlantic was not generally known by that name for some time\r\n     yet. Schöner, in 1520, terms it, as does Ptolemy in 1513,\r\n     _Oceanus Occidentalis_; Grynæus, in 1532, _Oceanus Magnus_;\r\n     Apianus, appearing in the Cosmography of 1575, although\r\n     thought to have been drawn in 1520, _Mar Atlicum_. Robert\r\n     Thorne, 1527, in _Hakluyt's Voy._, writes _Oceanus Occiden._;\r\n     Bordone, 1528, _Mare Occidentale_; Ptolemy, 1530, _Occean\r\n     Occidentalis_; Ramusio, 1565, _Viaggi_, iii. 455, off Central\r\n     America, _Mar del Nort_, and in the great ocean, both north\r\n     and south, _Mar Ociano_; Mercator, 1569, north of the tropic\r\n     of cancer, _Oceanius Atlanticvs_; Hondius, 1595, _Mar del\r\n     Nort_; _West-Indische Spieghel_, 1624, _Mar del Nort_; De\r\n     Laet, 1633, _Mar del Norte_; Jacob Colon, 1663, _Mar del\r\n     Nort_; Ogilby, 1671, _Oceanus Atlanticum_, _Mar del Norte_,\r\n     and _Oceanus Æthiopicus_; Dampier, 1699, _the North or\r\n     Atlantick Sea_. The Portuguese map of 1518, _Munich Atlas_,\r\n     iv., is the first upon which I have seen a name applied\r\n     to the Pacific; and there it is given, as I have elsewhere\r\n     remarked, as _Mar visto pelos Castelhanos_, Sea seen by the\r\n     Spaniards. On the maps of Baptiste Agnese, Vallard de Dieppe,\r\n     Diego Homem, and others, is the name _Mar del Sur_, but the\r\n     lettering is small, and seems applied only to the waters\r\n     between Peru and Guatemala. We have noticed on the globe of\r\n     Martin Behaim, 1492, a multitude of islands, scattered and in\r\n     groups, situated between the coast lines of western Europe\r\n     and eastern Asia. In that part of the globe where the north\r\n     Pacific Ocean should be represented, are the words _Oceanus\r\n     orientalis Indie_. On the globe of Johann Schöner, 1520,\r\n     the two continents of America are represented with a strait\r\n     dividing them at the Isthmus. The great island of _Zipangri_,\r\n     or Japan, lies about midway between North America and Asia.\r\n     North of this island, and in about the same locality as on\r\n     the globe of Behaim, are the words _Orientalis Oceanus_, and\r\n     to the same ocean south of the equator the words _Oceanus\r\n     Orientalis Indicus_ are applied. Diego Homem, in 1558, marks\r\n     out upon his map a large body of water to the north-west of\r\n     _Terra de Florida_, and west of Canada, and labels it _Mare\r\n     leparamantium_. Neither Maiollo nor Vaz Dourado gives a name\r\n     to either ocean. Colon and Ribero call the South Sea _Mar\r\n     del Svr_. In _Hakluyt's Voy._ we find that Robert Thorne, in\r\n     1527, wrote _Mare Australe_. Ptolemy, in 1530, places near the\r\n     Straits of Magellan _Mare pacificum_. Ramusio, 1565, _Viaggi_,\r\n     iii. 455, off Central America, places _Mar del Sur_, and off\r\n     the Straits of Magellan, _Mar Oceano_. Mercator places in his\r\n     atlas of 1569 plainly, near the Straits of Magellan, _El Mar\r\n     Pacifico_, and in the great sea off Central America _Mar del\r\n     Zur_. On the map of Hondius, about 1595, in _Drake's World\r\n     Encompassed_, the general term _Mare Pacificvm_ is applied to\r\n     the Pacific Ocean, the words being in large letters extending\r\n     across the ocean opposite Central America, while under it in\r\n     smaller letters is _Mar del Sur_. This clearly restricts the\r\n     name South Sea to a narrow locality, even at this date. In\r\n     Hondius' Map, _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, iv. 857, the south\r\n     Pacific is called _Mare Pacificum_, and the central Pacific\r\n     _Mar del Sur_.\r\n\r\n     [IX-13] In his _Novus Orbis_, i., De Laet inserts a map on\r\n     which he places _Tumaco_ to the north of Chiapes. North of\r\n     Tumaco is Quareca. The northern cape of _G. de S. Miguel_ he\r\n     calls _Pta de Garachine_. Debouching here is the _R. de\r\n     Congos_. See _Goldschmidt's Cartography Pac. Coast_, MS. ii.\r\n     5.\r\n\r\n     [IX-14] Colon and Ribero mark the group _y: de perlas_ and\r\n     _y∴a de plas_; Vaz Dourado, _I∴ de perollas_; _West-Indische\r\n     Spieghel_, _I Perles_; De Laet, _Ias de Perlas_; Jacob\r\n     Colom, _I de Perlas_; Jefferys, _I del Rey or Perlas_,\r\n     _Toboga, I_. Keipert in 1858 calls the group _Archipielago\r\n     de las Perlas_, and the largest, that which Balboa called\r\n     Isla Rica, _I. S. Miguel_; others of the group he calls\r\n     _I. St. Elmo_, _I. Galera_, _I. Pajaros_, _I. Chapera_, _I.\r\n     Contradora_, _I. Pacheca_, _I. Saboga_, _I. Bayoneta_, _I.\r\n     Pedro Gonzales_, and _I. S. José_. 'Da die Haupt-Insel mehrere\r\n     guten Schutz gewährende Ankerplätze hatte, so wurde sie bald\r\n     das Rendezvous und der Ausgangs-Punkt der Flotten, die vom\r\n     Golfe von Panama zur Entdeckung des Westens (Nicaragua) und\r\n     des Südens (Peru) ausliefen. Auch war ihre Anhöhe stets für\r\n     alle von Panama auslaufenden Flotten ein Merkzeichen zur\r\n     Orientirung.' _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten karten_, 104.\r\n\r\n     [IX-15] Sabana. See note 3, this chapter.\r\n\r\n     [IX-16] It is impossible from the rambling narratives which\r\n     constitute the groundwork of Central American history to\r\n     locate with certainty these two villages. Thus of Pocorosa\r\n     Vasco Nuñez, in a letter to the king, says, 'Está un cacique\r\n     que se dice Comogre y otro que se dice Pocorosa, estan tan\r\n     cerca de la mar el uno como el otra;' and of Tubanamá, 'Hase\r\n     de hacer otra fuerza en las minas de Tubanamá, en la provincia\r\n     de Comagre.' _Carta por Vasco Nuñez_ in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 366, 369.\r\n\r\n     [IX-17] A hundred thousand castellanos, Gomara says. 'Passo\r\n     muchos trabajos y hambre, traxo sin las perlas, mas de cien\r\n     mil castellanos de buen oro, y esperança, tornando alla, de\r\n     auer la mayor riqueza, que nũca los nacidos vieron, y con esto\r\n     estaua tan vfano, como animoso.' _Hist. Ind._, 82.\r\n\r\n     [X-1] According to Oviedo, iii. 4, 'hermano de Johan Arias\r\n     Dávila, que despues fué el primero conde de Puñoenrostro.'\r\n\r\n     [X-2] Though it was never popularly so designated. 'Gobernar á\r\n     Castilla del Oro en la Tierre Firme,' write the chroniclers;\r\n     but in his instructions the king says, _Navarrete_, _Col.\r\n     de Viages_, iii. 343, 'é agora la mandamos llamar _Castilla\r\n     Aurifia_.' Oviedo, iii. 4, gives Pedrarias a broad domain,\r\n     from Cape de la Vela to Veragua, and from ocean to ocean;\r\n     'señalándole por gobernaçion desde el Cabo de la Vela hasta\r\n     Veragua, y desde estos limites, que son en la costa del Norte,\r\n     corriendo la tierra adentro háçia la parte austral, todo\r\n     aquello que oviesse de mar á mar, con las islas que en ello\r\n     concurriessen.'\r\n\r\n     [X-3] 'Caicedo and Colmenares reached Spain in May, 1513; the\r\n     date of Pedrarias' appointment is July 27, 1513, so that it\r\n     is very probable, especially since Enciso and his complaints\r\n     reached the court of Spain before these deputies, that the\r\n     appointment of a governor was settled before they arrived.'\r\n     _Helps' Span. Conq._, i. 373. See _Título de Capitan general\r\n     y Gobernador de la provincia del Castilla del Oro en el\r\n     Darien, expedido por el Rey-Católico á Pedrarias Dávila_, in\r\n     _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 337.\r\n\r\n     [X-4] The Licenciado Zuazo, in a letter to M. De Xevres,\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 304-32, places the\r\n     cost of the outfit at 40,000 ducats; Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     iv. 138, at 54,000 ducats; 'y lo que en aquel tiempo se hizo\r\n     y suplió con 54,000 ducados es cierto que hoy no se supliera\r\n     con 158,000 castellanos.' Balboa in his letter to the king,\r\n     16th October, 1515, implies that the cost was 40,000 pesos de\r\n     oro. _Navarrete_, iii. 377.\r\n\r\n     [X-5] Herrera, i. x. vii., and Pascual de Andagoya, _Relacion\r\n     de los sucesos de Pedrarias Dávila_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 393, say 1,500 men and nineteen ships; Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, 84, seventeen ships; Galvano, _Discov._, 125,\r\n     seven ships. Peter Martyr, iii. v., places the number of\r\n     ships at seventeen, with 1,200 men assigned; but affirms that\r\n     surreptitiously or otherwise 1,500 sailed, and 2,000 remained\r\n     behind pensive and sighing who gladly would have gone at their\r\n     own cost. Oviedo, who, one would think, should know, as he was\r\n     of the number, testifies in one place, iii. 22, to twenty-two,\r\n     'naos é carabelas,' and 2,000 men, and in another place, iv.\r\n     473, to seventeen or eighteen.\r\n\r\n     [X-6] Icazbalceta, in _Dic. Univ._, i. 429, says that she was\r\n     cousin-german to the marchioness, who was a great favorite\r\n     with Queen Isabella.\r\n\r\n     [X-7] Appointed to succeed Juan de Caicedo 'que iba proveido\r\n     en el oficio de Veedor de las fundiciones del oro de la\r\n     Tierra Firme.' _José Amador de los Rios_, _Vida de Oviedo_,\r\n     in _Oviedo_, i. xxii. Caicedo died in Seville before sailing.\r\n     The duties of the office were to assay and stamp the gold and\r\n     take charge of the king's fifth. Oviedo was also _escribano\r\n     general_ or chief notary of Tierra Firme.\r\n\r\n     [X-8] Or as Oviedo, iii. 22, has it, 'con título de obispo de\r\n     Sancta Maria de la Antigua é de Castilla del Oro.'\r\n\r\n     [X-9] Gonzalo Fernandez writing from Santo Domingo the 25th\r\n     of October, 1537, to the Council of the Indies, _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 522-9, says that this order\r\n     proved inoperative, 'pues que los que lo habian de ejecutar\r\n     lo disimulaban,' since those who should have executed it\r\n     dissembled. For a time, however, no lawyer was allowed to\r\n     plead in the Indies, the alcalde mayor speaking on both sides,\r\n     and finally deciding according to the evidence; 'sentenciaba\r\n     por aquel por quien en el pleito habia mejor hablado.'\r\n\r\n     [X-10] _Instruccion dada por el Rey á Pedrarias Dávila para su\r\n     viage á la provincia de Castilla del Oro, que iba á poblar y\r\n     pacificar con la gente que llevaba_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 342-55; _Las Casas_, _Hist. Gen._, iv. 139-42;\r\n     _Herrera_, ii. i. xiii.\r\n\r\n     [X-11] Helps, _Span. Conq._, i. 385, and Irving, iii. 230,\r\n     say 12th April. Robertson, _Hist. Am._, i. 207, stigmatizes\r\n     Ferdinand for elevating Pedrarias, and abasing Vasco Nuñez;\r\n     in which the learned historian is wholly wrong. We who know\r\n     the merits of Vasco Nuñez may be disposed to excuse his\r\n     faults, but the king could not do otherwise, from a ruler's\r\n     standpoint, than depose the unknown adventurer guilty of\r\n     unlawful excesses.\r\n\r\n     [X-12] Five or six months later Pedrarias instituted formal\r\n     proceedings to prove his insubordination. The people murmured\r\n     against that hasty justice, and attributed it to some former\r\n     displeasure of the governor against the man. _Oviedo_, iii.\r\n     25. Part of the vessels returned to Spain; several of the old\r\n     and worm-eaten were sunk in Urabá Gulf; one foundered at sea,\r\n     on the voyage back, the crew escaping to Española. _Oviedo_,\r\n     iv. 471-3; _Herrera_, ii. i. vii.; _Andagoya's Nar._, 1-3;\r\n     _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, iii. 208.\r\n\r\n     [X-13] It was a desperate game Vasco Nuñez had been playing;\r\n     and although success up to this time had been varied, it was\r\n     sure in the end to be against him. According to the Licenciado\r\n     Zuazo, _al muy ilustre señor Monsieur de Xevres_, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 312-13, Pasamonte was guilty\r\n     of double-dealing, now receiving Balboa's presents and writing\r\n     the king in his favor, and at another time seconding the\r\n     persistent efforts of Enciso against him.\r\n\r\n     [X-14] _Capitulo de casta escrita por el Rey-Católico\r\n     á Pedrarias Dávila, sobre los medios de facilitar la\r\n     comunicacion entre la costa del Darien y la mar del sur, y que\r\n     para continuar en él los descubrimientos se hagan alli tres\r\n     ó cuatro carabelas_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii.\r\n     355-7.\r\n\r\n     [X-15] _Carta de Vasco Nuñez_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 375. Oviedo enumerates the following chiefs with\r\n     whom Balboa had made peace: Careta, Ponca, Careca, Chiapes,\r\n     Cuquera, Juanaga, Bonanimana, Tecra, Comagre, Pocorosa,\r\n     Buquebuca, Chuyrica, Otoque, Chorita, Pacra, Thenoca,\r\n     Tubanamá, Teaoca, Tamaca, Tamao and others. The Licenciado\r\n     Zuazo says, _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 315,\r\n     that Vasco Nuñez with his judicious policy had won over about\r\n     thirty caciques.\r\n\r\n     [X-16] From the most high and mighty Catholic defender of the\r\n     Church, always triumphant and never vanquished, the great King\r\n     Don Fernando, the fifth of that name, King of the Spains, of\r\n     the two Sicilies, and of Jerusalem, and of the Indies, isles\r\n     and firm land of the ocean sea, tamer of barbarous peoples;\r\n     and from the very high and puissant lady, the Queen Doña\r\n     Juana, his dearest and most beloved daughter, our sovereigns;\r\n     I, Pedrarias Dávila, their servant, messenger, and captain,\r\n     notify and make known to you as best I can, that God, our\r\n     Lord, one and triune, created the heavens and the earth, and\r\n     one man and one woman, from whom you and we and all mankind\r\n     were and are descended and procreated, and all those who\r\n     shall come after us. But from the multitudes issuing out of\r\n     that generation during the five thousand and more years since\r\n     the world was made, it became necessary that some should go\r\n     one way and some another, dispersing over many kingdoms and\r\n     provinces, as in one alone they could not sustain nor preserve\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     All these peoples God, our Lord, gave in charge to one\r\n     person, called Saint Peter, that he should be prince, lord,\r\n     and superior over all men in the world, whom all should obey,\r\n     and that he should be the head of all the human lineage,\r\n     wheresoever man might live or be, and of whatever law, sect,\r\n     or belief; and to him is given the whole world for his kingdom\r\n     and lordship and jurisdiction. And although he was ordered to\r\n     place his chair in Rome, as the most suitable spot whence to\r\n     rule the world, yet was he also permitted to be and place his\r\n     chair in any other part of the world, and judge and govern\r\n     all peoples, Christians, and Moors, and Jews, and Gentiles,\r\n     of whatever sect or belief they might be. And him they called\r\n     Pope, that is to say, Admirable, Supreme, Father, and Keeper,\r\n     because he is father and keeper of all men. And this Saint\r\n     Peter was obeyed and held in reverence as lord, and king,\r\n     supreme in the universe, by those who lived in that time,\r\n     likewise others who after him were elected to the pontificate\r\n     were so esteemed, and so it has continued until now and will\r\n     continue to the end of the world.\r\n\r\n     One of the pontiffs who succeeded as prince and lord of the\r\n     world, to the chair and dignity aforesaid, made a donation of\r\n     these isles and firm land of the ocean sea to the said King\r\n     and Queen, our sovereigns, and to their successors, with all\r\n     therein contained, as it appears in certain writings made\r\n     therefor, which you can see if desirable. So that by virtue\r\n     of said donation their highnesses are kings and lords of\r\n     these isles and firm land, and as such have been recognized,\r\n     and obeyed, and served by the inhabitants of almost all the\r\n     islands to whom notification has been made, who still obey\r\n     and serve them as subjects should; and of their free will,\r\n     without resistance, immediately, without delay, as soon as\r\n     informed of the aforesaid, they obeyed and recognized the\r\n     learned men and friars who were sent by their highnesses to\r\n     preach and teach our holy Catholic faith; doing this of their\r\n     free and spontaneous will, without pressure or condition of\r\n     any kind; and they became Christians and are now, and their\r\n     highnesses received them gladly and benignantly, and ordered\r\n     that they should be treated in every respect as their own\r\n     subjects and vassals; and you are held and obliged to do\r\n     likewise. Therefore, as best I may, I pray and require you\r\n     well to understand what I have told you; to take the time\r\n     which may be necessary to comprehend it and to deliberate\r\n     upon it; and to recognize the Church as Supreme Mistress of\r\n     the Universe, and the Supreme Pontiff, called Pope, and the\r\n     King and Queen in his place as monarchs and supreme sovereigns\r\n     of these isles and firm land, by virtue of the donation\r\n     aforesaid, and to consent and allow these religious fathers\r\n     to explain and preach to you as aforesaid. If thus you do,\r\n     you will do well, and do that which you are held and bound to\r\n     do, and their highnesses, and I in their name, will receive\r\n     you with all love and charity; and your wives, and children,\r\n     and property will be freely left to you without lien, that\r\n     you may do with them and with yourselves, whatever you may\r\n     please. You will not be compelled to turn Christians, except\r\n     when informed of the truth you desire to be converted to our\r\n     holy Catholic faith, like almost all the inhabitants of the\r\n     other isles. And besides this their highnesses will grant you\r\n     many privileges and exemptions, and do you many favors. But if\r\n     you do not thus, or maliciously delay to do it, I certify to\r\n     you that with the help of God I will invade your lands with\r\n     a powerful force, and will make war upon you in all parts,\r\n     and in every manner in my power, and will subject you to the\r\n     yoke and obedience of the Church and their highnesses; and I\r\n     will take your persons, and those of your wives and children,\r\n     and will make them slaves, and as such will sell them and\r\n     dispose of them as their highnesses shall order; and I will\r\n     take your property, and I will do you all possible harm and\r\n     evil, as to vassals who do not obey or recognize their lord,\r\n     but who resist and oppose him. And I protest that the deaths\r\n     and damage which from such conduct may result will be at your\r\n     charge and not at that of their highnesses, nor at mine, nor\r\n     at that of the gentlemen who come with me. And now to that\r\n     which I have said I require the notary here present to give\r\n     me a certificate. Episcopus Palentinus, comes; F. Bernardus,\r\n     Trinopolitanus episcopus; F.

To the astute Enciso\r\n     belongs the honor of first reading this _requerimiento_ to the\r\n     savages in America. The place was the port of Cenú; and when\r\n     the lawyer had finished, the chief, whose name was Catarapa,\r\n     and his people laughed at him; these benighted barbarians\r\n     laughed at the learned bachiller, and said that the Pope must\r\n     have been drunk when he did it, for he was giving what was not\r\n     his; and that the King who asked and took such a grant must be\r\n     a crazy one, since he asked for what was another's. 'Dixeron\r\n     q̃ el papa deuiera estar borracho quãdo lo hizo; pues daualo\r\n     q̃ no era suyo, y q̃ el rey q̃ pedia & tomaua tal merced\r\n     deuia ser algun loco pues pedia lo que era & de otros.' _Enciso_,\r\n     _Suma de Geografia_, 56. A copy of this precious document was\r\n     filed in the _Casa de Contratacion_, at Seville. _Memorial\r\n     que dió el bachiller Enciso_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 442-7. Herrera, i. vii. xiv., gives the text\r\n     of the _requerimiento_ made for Ojeda and others in 1508.\r\n     See also _Real Cédula_, in _Doc.

X. (Santa Cruz) north and west of Comagre;\r\n     although Oviedo, iii. 37, says, 'el puerto de Sancta Cruz que\r\n     es en tierra del caçique Comogre.' It is often impossible to\r\n     reconcile the self-contradictions of a writer, to say nothing\r\n     of the conflicting statements of the several chroniclers.\r\n     Oviedo usually places the native towns and provinces where\r\n     most convenient for his narrative.\r\n\r\n     [X-18] I do not know that it is necessary here to catalogue\r\n     Ayora's crimes. One which the Licenciado Zuazo mentions,\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 315-16, if\r\n     sufficiently pluralized, will answer for all. Met one day, on\r\n     approaching a village, by natives bearing presents of venison,\r\n     fowl and fish, wine and maize, who thought the white tiba to\r\n     be their friend, Vasco Nuñez, Ayora seized the cacique and his\r\n     chief men, tortured them with fire and dogs until all their\r\n     gold was given up, and then burned them alive. 'This infernal\r\n     hunt lasted several months,' says Oviedo.\r\n\r\n     [X-19] 'Los quales luego fueron vendidos en almoneda é\r\n     herrados, é los mas dellos se sacaron de la tierra por mar,\r\n     é los llevaron á otras partes.' _Oviedo_, iii. 39. 'Poi mandò\r\n     ancora lui altri Capitani per quella Costa, come fu Bartolomeo\r\n     Vrtado in Achla, e saltato in terra, sotto colore di pace,\r\n     pigliò tutti gl'Indiani, che potè, e gli vendè per ischiaui.'\r\n     _Benzoni_, _Hist. Nvovo Mondo_, 49.\r\n\r\n     [X-20] _Carta al Rey_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii.\r\n     376. Oviedo states that Pedrarias sent a ship after Ayora\r\n     to Santo Domingo, but before it reached that port Ayora had\r\n     sailed for Spain, where, soon afterward, he died, leaving the\r\n     bishop, the alcalde mayor, and the governor responsible for\r\n     his crimes. Even if this were true, these functionaries may\r\n     have winked at Ayora's escape.\r\n\r\n     [X-21] Theodore de Bry and Benzoni give graphic engravings\r\n     of the cutting and roasting and eating of Spaniards. Says\r\n     the latter, 'Quegli, che pigliauano vini, spetialmente il\r\n     Capitani, legategli le mani e i piedi, gettatigli in terra,\r\n     colauano loro dell'oro in bocca, dicendo, mangia, mangia\r\n     oro Cristiano.' _Hist. Nvovo Mondo_, 49. Nor has Las Casas\r\n     failed to improve the subject, as may be seen in the curious\r\n     illustrations and extreme denunciations of his _Regionvm\r\n     Indicarum devastatorum_, 18-22 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [X-22] _Herrera_, ii. i. ii.; _Peter Martyr_, iii. 6. Oviedo,\r\n     iii. 46, asserts that Panciaco joined Pocorosa in the attack\r\n     on Santa Cruz, and that not a single Spaniard escaped.\r\n     Andagoya, in _Nar._, 12, says that all were killed save one\r\n     woman, whom Pocorosa kept several years as his wife. She\r\n     was finally killed through jealousy by an Indian woman who\r\n     reported her to have been eaten by a crocodile while bathing.\r\n\r\n     [X-23] Oviedo calls this place Tamao.\r\n\r\n     [X-24] This was the site of old Panamá. Aboriginally fish in\r\n     large quantities were dried there. 'Que es provincia adonde\r\n     los ayres son buenos quando vienen dela mar,' says Herrera,\r\n     ii. ii. x., 'y malos quando procedẽ de tierra.' In _Purchas_,\r\n     _His Pilgrimes_, iv. 883, is written, 'It might haue had\r\n     a better seate, and more wholesome, and to the purpose for\r\n     the trafficke of the South Sea, not going very farre from\r\n     whence the Citie now stands.' See _Juan_ and _Ulloa_, _Voy._,\r\n     i. 99; _Heylyn's Cosmog._, 1085; _Lloyd_, in _London Geog.\r\n     Soc., Jour._, i. 85; _Findlay's Direct._, i. 213; _Griswold's\r\n     Panama_, 11; _Viagero Univ._, xii. 303-30; _Andagoya's Nar._,\r\n     23. Ambiguously Gomara writes, _Hist. Ind._, 254, 'Deste golfo\r\n     a Panama ay mas de cinquenta, que descubrio Gaspar de Morales\r\n     Capitan de Pedrarias de Auila.' Still more indefinite is\r\n     Benzoni, _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_, 81, 'Questa prouincia di Panama\r\n     soleua essere habitata da molti popoli Indiani, e per tutti\r\n     quei siu mi v'era abbondanza d'oro; ma gli Spagnuoli hanno\r\n     consumato ogni cosa.'\r\n\r\n     [X-25] It may be the same as Poncra; from the authorities it\r\n     is impossible with certainty to determine.\r\n\r\n     [X-26] Peter Martyr speaks of four attempts to gain the golden\r\n     temple. The first attained a distance up the river of forty\r\n     leagues, the second of fifty leagues, and the third of eighty\r\n     leagues. Again they crossed the river and proceeded by land,\r\n     'but oh! wonderful mischance, the unarmed and naked people\r\n     always overcame the armed and armored.' Jacobo Álvarez Osorio,\r\n     a friar of the priory of Darien, spent many years in search\r\n     of the province of Dabaiba.\r\n\r\n     [X-27] Balboa says eighty. _Carta_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 530.\r\n\r\n     [X-28] Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, 84, gives the island or the\r\n     chieftain yet another name, 'y diose buena maña en la ysla\r\n     de Terarequi a rescatar perlas.' Oviedo, iii. 16, calls the\r\n     island Toe.\r\n\r\n     [X-29] Writing the king, Vasco Nuñez tells the tale somewhat\r\n     differently. 'No sooner had they arrived at Isla Rica,' he\r\n     says, 'than entering a village they captured all the Indians\r\n     they could. The cacique prepared for war, but retired for\r\n     several days, during which time the Christians burned half\r\n     the houses with all the provisions. Afterward the cacique\r\n     peaceably returned with fifteen or sixteen marks of pearls\r\n     and four thousand pesos in gold. Then he took the Spaniards\r\n     to the place where they obtained the pearls, and made his\r\n     people gather them, and remain at peace. Notwithstanding all\r\n     this the captain without conscience gave away as slaves all\r\n     the men and all the women whom he brought away from the Rich\r\n     Island.' The statement may be taken with allowance as from\r\n     a man smarting under wrong; and it is not a little amusing\r\n     to see how suddenly tender becomes the conscience of the\r\n     ingenuous Vasco, who never stole anything from the natives,\r\n     or burned their houses, or made them slaves!\r\n\r\n     [X-30] Erroneously supposed by some to be the origin of the\r\n     word Peru.\r\n\r\n     [X-31] Some of the pearls were of extraordinary size and\r\n     beauty. One, in particular, attained no small celebrity.\r\n     It was pear-shaped, one inch in length, and nine lines in\r\n     its largest diameter. Vasco Nuñez describes it as weighing\r\n     'ten tomines'—a _tomin_ is about one third of a drachm—'very\r\n     perfect, without a scratch or stain and of a very pretty color\r\n     and lustre and make; which, in truth,' artlessly intimating\r\n     what would be his course under the circumstances, 'is a jewel\r\n     well worthy of presentation to your Majesty, more particularly\r\n     as coming from these parts. It was put up at auction and\r\n     sold for 1,200 pesos de oro to a merchant, and finally fell\r\n     into the hands of the governor.' Oviedo, iii. 49, says it\r\n     weighed 31 carats. Subsequently it was presented through\r\n     Doña Isabel to the queen, and was valued in Spain at 4,000\r\n     ducats. Pedrarias is further charged with divers misdemeanors.\r\n     _Carta del Adelantado Vasco Nuñez de Balboa_, October 16,\r\n     1515, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 526, and\r\n     _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 375; _Ovalle_, _Hist. Rel.\r\n     Chile_, in _Pinkerton's Voy._, xiv. 146-7.\r\n\r\n     [XI-1] Peter Martyr, dec. iii. cap. x., says he set out in May\r\n     with 80 men, and was afterward joined by Mercado with 50 men.\r\n\r\n     [XI-2] On Mercator's atlas there is a town and river\r\n     south-west from Panamá named _Nata_. Hondius, Dampier,\r\n     Jefferys, and De Laet give _Nata_; _West-Indische Spieghel_,\r\n     _Nato_; _Kiepert_, _Nata de los Caballeros_, and thence\r\n     eastward, _R. Aguablanca_, and opposite this river, _I Chiru_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-3] Nearly all the gold found here was wrought into plates\r\n     and various kinds of utensils.\r\n\r\n     [XI-4] It is groundless speculation on the part of Herrera\r\n     to find in this word, as many do in others, the origin of\r\n     the term Peru. 'Y prosiguiendo su descubrimiento hàzia el\r\n     Ocidente, llegaron a la tierra del Cazique dicho Birùquete,\r\n     de quien se dize que ha deriuado el nombre de Piru.' _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, ii. i. xiv.\r\n\r\n     [XI-5] Paris was an Indian province and gulf twelve leagues\r\n     from Natá. Oviedo authorizes us to write, _Pariza_ or\r\n     _Parita_. The large square peninsula which forms the western\r\n     bound to the gulf of Panamá, is sometimes called by modern\r\n     writers _Parita_, and the gulf which cuts into the peninsula\r\n     _Gulfo de Parita_. See Humboldt's _Atlas of New Spain_.\r\n     Ribero gives _G. de Paris_, Vaz Dourado, _G∴ de Paris naca_\r\n     and _b∴ de Paris naqua_; De Laet, _Golfo de Parita_, as well\r\n     as the city Parita, south of which is _Iubraua_, and north,\r\n     _Escoria_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-6] Town and province, beside being the name of the first\r\n     prominent point west of Panamá. Colon and Ribero have it, _p\r\n     de Chame_; Vaz Dourado writes it the same once, and again,\r\n     _p∴ de Cane_; Colom gives _P de Chane_; De Laet, and others\r\n     after him, _Chame_, with _Otoque_ east of it.\r\n\r\n     [XI-7] 'Donde despues Pedrarias pobló un pueblo de cristianos\r\n     que se dice Acla, y antes que hobiese esta batalla tenia otro\r\n     nombre, porque Acla en la lengua de aquella tierra quiere\r\n     decir huesos de hombres ó canillas de hombres.' _Andagoya_,\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de Viages_, iii. 397.\r\n     See also _Carta de Alonso de la Puente y Diego Marquez_, in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 538-49; Robert\r\n     FitzRoy, in _London Geog. Soc., Jour._, xxiii. 179, gives\r\n     us a fair specimen of historical writing by an intelligent\r\n     gentleman, who knows nothing of what he is saying when he\r\n     describes 'Acla, or Agla,' as settled 'in 1514, a few miles\r\n     inland from that port or bay now famed in history and romance,\r\n     called by Patterson Caledonian Harbour.' Acla was on the\r\n     coast, three or four leagues north of Caledonian Bay, as we\r\n     find in _Purchas_, _His Pilgrimes_, iv. 883, 'right against\r\n     the Iland of _Pinos_, whereof at this present there is no more\r\n     memory than that there was the death of that famous Captaine,\r\n     whose name will last eternally, the President _Basco Nunnez_\r\n     of _Balnoa_, and of his company.' Fernando Colon, 1527, calls\r\n     the town _ocara_; Diego de Ribero, _acra_; Vaz Dourado, 1571,\r\n     _Munich Atlas_, No. x., _axca_, and on No. xi., _azca_; De\r\n     Laet, Colom, and others, _Acla_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-8] _Relacion hecha por Gaspar de Espinosa, alcalde mayor\r\n     de Castilla del Oro, dada á Pedrarias de Avila, lugar teniente\r\n     general de aquellas provincias, de todo lo que le sucedió\r\n     en la entrada que hizo en ellas, de órden de Pedrarias_,\r\n     in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 467-522. The\r\n     licentiate begins his verbose narrative with a flourish of\r\n     trumpets before the king and queen, in a lengthy saying of\r\n     Quintilian, and an apology, saying that had he sufficient\r\n     time he would give the particulars of his raid. The document\r\n     is signed, El Licenciado Espinosa; Gerónimo Valenzuela; Pablo\r\n     Mexia; Pedro de Gamez; Bartolomé Hurtado, capitan; Gabriel\r\n     de Roxas; Por su mandado, Martin Salcedo. The editors of the\r\n     collection in which the paper appears complain of its errors\r\n     in regard to places, which they have endeavored to rectify\r\n     whenever possible. The truth of its incidents they of course\r\n     could not dispute.\r\n\r\n     [XI-9] Probably the Rio Chepo, or Bayano.\r\n\r\n     [XI-10] The licentiate's narrative here becomes as confused\r\n     as his sense of justice. The names of towns, provinces, and\r\n     chiefs are now brought together and then scattered as if flung\r\n     at random from the hand, making it in no wise difficult to\r\n     imagine either that the licentiate never made the journey,\r\n     or that he did not write the relation. There is no doubt,\r\n     however, on either of these points. There is this to say;\r\n     language was not then what it is now, and there were men who\r\n     knew how best to use it even in those days.\r\n\r\n     [XI-11] Named by Espinosa, Puerto de las Agujas.\r\n\r\n     [XI-12] Colon and Ribero both write _ya de Cebaco_; Mercator\r\n     places a town on the mainland opposite, _Sebaco_; Ogilby, _I. de\r\n     S. Maria_; De Laet, _Isles del Zebaco_; Colom and Jefferys,\r\n     _Zebaco_; Kiepert, _I. Cebaco_, and near it _I. del Gobernador_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-13] If Coiba was meant we find connected the ancient\r\n     name of _Gatos_, _ya gatos_, _y de gatos_, etc. Then the\r\n     name changes, and we have by Vaz Dourado _I∴ de quofõque_;\r\n     Mercator, _Quicare_; Dampier, _Keys of Quicara_ or _Quibo_;\r\n     I. de Laet gives, _Cobaya_, _Quicaro_, and _La Montuosa_;\r\n     Colom, _Coyba_, _Quicaro_, and _Lamatuosa_; Jefferys, _Coyba_,\r\n     _Quicaro_, and opposite Coiba, _Pt. Bianco_, and west _Coco_,\r\n     and _Honda_. Herrera calls the island _Cobayos_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-14] Not so called at the time, however. According to\r\n     Herrera the native name was Chira. The gulf was first known\r\n     to civilization as San Lúcar, and San Lázaro; before this,\r\n     even, we have by Colon, _G. de S. Vicenite_. Vaz Dourado\r\n     gives _Sao llucar_; Mercator, in 1574, places in the interior\r\n     the town _Nicoia_, and on the eastern shore of the gulf the\r\n     town _Pari_. Ogilby gives on the _Golfo de Salinas_, as well\r\n     as on the land, perhaps town and province, _Nicoya_, and a\r\n     little to the west, _Paro_. Dampier gives _G. of Nicoya_, and\r\n     the town of _nicoya_. De Laet locates the town of _Nicoya_,\r\n     east of which is _Paro_. _West-Indische Spieghel_, _G. Goca_;\r\n     and Jefferys, _Nicova_, and near it emptying into the gulf,\r\n     _R. Dispensa_, _R. Taminsco_, _R. de Costarica_, _R. de las\r\n     Canas_, and _R. Solano_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-15] Called the bay of _Osa_ by Herrera; _baia de oqua_ by\r\n     Vaz Dourado; _Munich Atlas_, no. xi., b∴ _deoqua_; De Laet,\r\n     _Golfo de Salinas_; and by Dampier, and Jefferys, _G. Dulce_,\r\n     and _Gulfe Dulce_.\r\n\r\n     [XI-16] With singular fidelity to its original, this name has\r\n     retained its proper orthography without regard to time or\r\n     place. The chart-makers of every name and nation give only\r\n     _Panamá_. Fernando Colon applies the word as to a province,\r\n     but usually it is given as to a town. Dampier gives the _Bay\r\n     of Panama_ as well as the city. De Laet sends flowing into\r\n     this bay _R. Chiepo_, _R. Pacora_, _R.

Although the chronicles and relations\r\n     are all exceedingly confused, yet I am satisfied that the\r\n     establishment of a post at Panamá was not effected before\r\n     January, 1517, since Espinosa was hunting for Paris in\r\n     January, during the absence of Hurtado and Ponce upon the\r\n     coast toward the north-west.\r\n\r\n     [XII-1] Authorities thus far for this chapter are for the\r\n     most part the same as those last quoted. _Las Casas_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 169-248, who, I think, gives the best account of\r\n     any by contemporary writers; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. i. cap.\r\n     iii.; _Oviedo_, iii. 6-8; _Peter Martyr_, dec. iii. cap. iii.\r\n     and dec. iv. cap. ix.; _Benzoni_, _Hist.

En su disputa con Casas\r\n     delante del emperador aseguró que el primer gobernador del\r\n     Darien habia sido malo, y el segundo muy peor.' _Quintana_,\r\n     _Vidas_, 'Balboa,' 35. In the matter of definite dates for the\r\n     events of this chapter, authorities differ. All are more or\r\n     less vague. Most of them end the career of Vasco Nuñez with\r\n     the end of 1517; which, if correct, would fix the time of his\r\n     departure from Antigua about May, 1516, for in his agreement\r\n     with Pedrarias it was arranged that the time of absence on the\r\n     South Sea expedition should be limited to eighteen months, and\r\n     one of the principal charges of the governor was that Balboa\r\n     had failed in this. Among the collection of documents in the\r\n     royal archives of the Indies appears a petition presented by\r\n     Fernando de Argüello to Pedrarias and his council, in behalf\r\n     of Vasco Nuñez, requesting an extension of the time. At the\r\n     foot of the petition is a decree, dated January 13, 1518,\r\n     granting an extension of four months. Either the document is\r\n     fictitious, or its date erroneous, or contemporary writers\r\n     are in error. I am quite sure that Pedrarias never gave any\r\n     extension, since the authorities are clear and positive on\r\n     that point, and the incidents of the narrative hinge upon it.\r\n     Compare copy of this document in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 556-8; _Carta de Alonso de la Puente y\r\n     Diego de Marquez_, in _id._, 538-49; Moreri and Miravel y\r\n     Casadevante in _El Gran. Dic._; _Burney's Discov. South Sea_,\r\n     i. 12; _Naharro_, _Relacion_, in _Doc. Inéd. para Hist. Esp._,\r\n     xxvi. 232. As to the date of Quevedo's leaving Darien and his\r\n     arrival in Spain there are grave differences. Herrera sends\r\n     the bishop to Spain in 1518, to report the misgovernment of\r\n     Pedrarias. Oviedo states that Quevedo left Darien soon after\r\n     the reconciliation of Vasco Nuñez and Pedrarias, and yet does\r\n     not speak of his being in Spain until 1519, 'era llegado.' It\r\n     is known that Quevedo spent some time in Cuba, urging Diego\r\n     Velazquez to apply for the governorship of Castilla del Oro.\r\n     The petition of Argüello for the extension of the time of\r\n     absence of Vasco Nuñez, before mentioned, contains the name of\r\n     Quevedo as one of those who acted upon it, which only the more\r\n     conclusively proves that document fictitious. Stranger than\r\n     all this, however, is the statement in the royal cédula, dated\r\n     June 18, 1519, ordering the ships of Balboa to be delivered\r\n     to Gil Gonzalez, that Vasco Nuñez was then a prisoner. So\r\n     singular is this culpable ignorance, or carelessness, or\r\n     deception, regarding the death of Vasco Nuñez, on the part\r\n     of the royal officials, as at first to raise grave doubts\r\n     regarding the date of his death, were it not proved by many\r\n     collateral incidents.\r\n\r\n     [XII-3] There are several streams of this name between the\r\n     Atrato and the Colorado, but none of them suit the occasion.\r\n     Modern maps give a Rio Balsas flowing into the gulf of San\r\n     Miguel from the south, its source turned the farthest possible\r\n     away from Acla. On a map of Joannis de Laet, 1633, _Nov.\r\n     Orb._, 347, midway between the gulf of San Miguel and Panamá,\r\n     are the words _R de la balsa_. They are placed opposite Acla;\r\n     the mouth of a river only is given, the stream not being\r\n     laid down. The same may be said of the _R. de la balse_ of\r\n     Montanus, _Nieuwe Weereld_, 1671, which is in about the same\r\n     locality. The Rio Chepo is the only stream approaching the\r\n     description in that vicinity. In my opinion both of these\r\n     map-makers were wrong; neither the Rio Chepo nor any other\r\n     stream in that neighborhood was the Rio Balsas of Vasco Nuñez.\r\n     The head-waters of the Rio Chucunaque are nearer the old site\r\n     of Acla than those of the Rio Chepo, or of any other southward\r\n     flowing stream; and yet I do not think the Chucunaque the\r\n     Balsas of Vasco Nuñez. Says Pascual de Andagoya, _Navarrete_,\r\n     _Col. de Viages_, iii. 404, 'Le envió á la provincia de Acla á\r\n     poblar un pueblo, que es el que agora está que se dice Acla, y\r\n     de allí le dió gente que fuese al rio de la Balsa, y hiciese\r\n     dos navíos para bajar por él á la mar del sur ... y bajados\r\n     al golfo de S. Miguel se anegaban,' etc.; from which, and\r\n     from the objects and incidents of the enterprise, as given\r\n     by various authors, I am inclined to believe the Rio de las\r\n     Balsas of Vasco Nuñez to be the stream now known as the Rio\r\n     Sabana. The fact of distance alone, commonly estimated at 22\r\n     leagues, but which Las Casas makes '24 y 25 leguas de sierras\r\n     altísimas,' inclines me to this opinion, not to mention\r\n     several others pointing in the same direction, which will\r\n     clearly appear in the text.\r\n\r\n     [XII-4] 'Yo ví firmado de su nombre del mismo Obispo, en una\r\n     relacion que hizo al Emperador en Barcelona el año de 1519,\r\n     cuando él de la tierra firme vino, como más largo adelante,\r\n     placiendo á Dios, será referido, que habia muerto el Vasco\r\n     Nuñez, por hacer los bergantines, 500 indios, y el secretario\r\n     del mismo Obispo me dijo que no quiso poner más número\r\n     porque no pareciese cosa increible, pero que la verdad era\r\n     que llegaban ó pasaban de 2,000.' _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     iv. 233-4. 'No se hallo que Castellano ninguno muriesse, ni\r\n     negro, aunque de los Indios fueron muchos los que perecieron.'\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xi.\r\n\r\n     [XII-5] Pascual de Andagoya asserts that the worm-eaten timber\r\n     was put together on the Balsas and navigated, though with\r\n     great difficulty, to the gulf of San Miguel, and thence to the\r\n     Pearl Islands; and that there they soon foundered. _Relacion\r\n     de los sucesos de Pedrarias Dávila_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 404. This statement, though entitled to great\r\n     weight, is not sustained by the other authorities.\r\n\r\n     [XII-6] If I have applied strong terms of denunciation to\r\n     Pedrarias Dávila, it is because he unquestionably deserves\r\n     it. He is by far the worst man who came officially to the New\r\n     World during its early government. In this all authorities\r\n     agree. And all agree that Vasco Nuñez was not deserving\r\n     of death. Andagoya, _Relacion_, in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_, iii. 403-5, is an excellent authority. Says Las\r\n     Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 240, 'Dijeron que esta falsedad\r\n     ó testimonio falso, ó quizá verdad, escribió Garabito á\r\n     Pedrarias porque Vasco Nuñez, por una india que tenia por\r\n     amiga, le habia de palabra maltratado.' Some of the more\r\n     knowing among the chroniclers say that God punished Vasco\r\n     Nuñez with this death for his treatment of Nicuesa. Will they\r\n     at the same time tell us for what God permitted Pedrarias to\r\n     live? 'Desta manera acabó el adelantamiento de Vasco Nuñez,\r\n     descubridor de la mar del Sur, é pagó la muerte del capitan\r\n     Diego de Nicuesa; por la qual é por otras culpas permitió\r\n     Dios que oviesse tal muerte, é no por lo quel pregon deçia,\r\n     porque la que llamaban traycion, ninguno la tuvo por tal.'\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 60. Herrera everywhere speaks in the highest\r\n     terms of Vasco Nuñez, and pronounces the character and conduct\r\n     of Pedrarias detestable. Says Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, 85,\r\n     'Ni pareciera delante del gouernador, aunque mas su suegro\r\n     fuera. Juntosele con esto, la muerte de Diego de Nicuesa,\r\n     y sus sesenta compañeros. La prision del bachiller Enciso,\r\n     y que era vãdolero reboltoso, cruel, y malo para Indios.'\r\n     Of Balboa's denial of guilt, in _Hist. Mondo Nvovo_, i. 51,\r\n     Benzoni writes, 'Valboa con giuramento negò, dicendo, che in\r\n     quanto toccaua alla informatione che contra lui s'era fatta\r\n     di solleuargli la gente che l'era à torto, e falsamente\r\n     accusato, e che considerasse bene quello che faceua, e se\r\n     lui hauesse tal cosa tentata, non saria venuto alla presentia\r\n     sua, e similmente del resto, si difese il meglio che puote ma\r\n     dove regnano le forze, poco gioua defendersi con la ragione.'\r\n     And Peter Martyr, dec. iv. cap. ix., testifies, 'Vaschum ab\r\n     Austro accersit Petrus Arias: paret dicto Vaschus, in catenas\r\n     conjicitur. Negat Vaschus tale consilium cogitasse. Testes\r\n     quæruntur malefactorum, quæ patraverat: ab initio dicta\r\n     colliguntur, morte dignus censetur, perimitur.' And 'what\r\n     stomach' he further adds, 'Pedrarias Dávila may have, should\r\n     he ever return to Spain, let good men judge.'\r\n\r\n     [XIII-1] The city or town council, composed of the alcalde,\r\n     regidores, and other officers having the administration or\r\n     economical and political management of municipal affairs.\r\n     The word _cabildo_ has essentially the same signification as\r\n     _ayuntamiento_, _regimiento_, _consejo_, _municipalidad_, and\r\n     _consejo municipal_. A _cabildo eclesiástico_ is a bishop's\r\n     council or chapter. The authority invested in this body at\r\n     Antigua at this time, to check Pedrarias, was wholly unusual\r\n     and extraordinary.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-2] First by the hand of Pedrarias de Ávila, the\r\n     governor's nephew, February 16, 1515, and again January 28,\r\n     1516. See _Puente_, _Carta_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, 541-8; _Gonzalez Dávila_, _Teatro Ecles._, ii.\r\n     57.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-3] Juan de Quevedo was a friar of the order of St\r\n     Francis, a native of Bejori in Old Castile; was consecrated\r\n     bishop by Leo X., and died December 24, 1519. He was a\r\n     double-faced divine, mercenary, but with good-natured\r\n     proclivities. Gonzalez Dávila who gives his biography, _Teatro\r\n     Ecles._, ii. 58, says that he was defeated in the discussions\r\n     with Las Casas. See also _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 73-6.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-4] Herrera, _Hist. Gen._, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     iii., gives the erroneous impression that, when Pedrarias\r\n     retired to Panamá, Espinosa was left to govern at Antigua as\r\n     captain-general. Acosta, _Compend. Hist. Nueva Granada_, 75-6,\r\n     copies the error.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-5] In fact, neither Nombre de Dios nor Panamá, as\r\n     at this time located, remained; the former, by order of\r\n     Philip II., being removed five leagues to the westward,\r\n     to Portobello, and the city of Panamá being refounded two\r\n     leagues west of the original site, each port, at the time of\r\n     its depopulation, claiming over 40,000 Spaniards as victims\r\n     to the unwholesomeness of the climate, during a period of\r\n     twenty-eight years. It was not until after these places had\r\n     become the entrepôts for a large traffic with Peru and the\r\n     north-western coast that the changes were made.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-6] It was in the former instance that Pedrarias sought\r\n     to pluralize his ownership by taking possession, quasi\r\n     possession, and repossession, as fully related in that\r\n     curious document by Mozolay, _Testimonio_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 549-56, of which I have made an\r\n     abstract in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-7] A better anchorage, owing to the wide stretch of\r\n     shelving beach at Panamá, which was uncovered at low tide.\r\n     Herrera says that in his day vessels in summer rode in the\r\n     strand, and in the winter in the haven of Perico, two leagues\r\n     from the port of Panamá.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-8] As Pascual de Andagoya, _Relacion_, in _Navarrete_,\r\n     _Col. de Viages_, iii. 406, says, 'Panamá se fundó el año de\r\n     19, dia de Ntra. Sra. de Agosto, y en fin de aquel año pobló\r\n     al Nombre de Dios un capitan Diego Alvites por mandado de\r\n     Pedrarias.' And Herrera writes, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. iii.,\r\n     'Concordandose todos en esto, llamò Pedrarias a un escrivano,\r\n     y le pidio por testimonio como alli de positiva una villa q̃\r\n     se llamasse Panamá en nõbre de Dios y de la Reyna doña Iuana,\r\n     y don Carlos su hijo, y protestava dela defender en el dicho\r\n     nombres a qualesquier cõtrarios.'

'Didacus Albitez itidem\r\n     Hispanus Chagre fluvium subiit.' In 1516 were put forward\r\n     his pretensions to conquest in the direction of Veragua.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xi.; _Andagoya's Nar._, 23;\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 61-71; _Galvano's Discov._, 31.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-10] Peter Martyr says the road was wide enough to give\r\n     passage for two carts side by side, 'to the intent that they\r\n     might passe ouer with ease to search ye secrets of either\r\n     spacious Sea;' but at the writing of his sixth decade the road\r\n     was not completed.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-11] Lying north of Nicoya, and so called to-day, that is\r\n     to say Puerto de Culebra. South of Lake Nicaragua, on Colon's\r\n     and Ribero's maps we find _G. de S. tiago_; Vaz Dourado, _b∴\r\n     de Samtiago_. By some chart-makers the results and names of\r\n     one discovery were known, by others, those of another; the\r\n     final appellation depended on circumstances.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-12] Oviedo's statements concerning himself during this\r\n     period of angry excitement must be taken with due allowance.\r\n     The chronicler gives himself and his affairs at great length;\r\n     but I will endeavor, in my curtailment of his account, not\r\n     to forget that there were at this time, and before and after,\r\n     twenty equally important issues of which there are less full\r\n     records. See _Oviedo_, iii. 41-56 and 72-88; _José Amador\r\n     de los Rios_, _Vida y Escritos de Oviedo_, in _id._, i. pp.\r\n     ix.-cvii.; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XIII-13] 'From which it may be seen,' says Oviedo, 'with what\r\n     justice Vasco Nuñez was condemned, when his chief accomplice\r\n     comes back not only acquitted but with honors.'\r\n\r\n     [XIV-1] There were three of this name whom we shall encounter,\r\n     the contador of Española; the licenciado, who was alcalde\r\n     mayor of the Spanish main under Diego de Ordaz, in 1530;\r\n     _Simon_, _Conq. Tierra Firme_, 106-27; and the clergyman\r\n     and chief chronicler, in 1655, of the Indies, and of both\r\n     Castiles.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-2] The royal agreement was made specially with Niño,\r\n     'piloto de su magestad para el descubrimiento,' Gil Gonzalez\r\n     being named captain-general. Niño was to explore 1,000 leagues\r\n     to the westward for spices, gold, silver, pearls, and precious\r\n     stones, in three ships, furnished half by the crown and half\r\n     by the explorers, who were to receive for the purpose 4,000\r\n     castellanos de oro, from the sums to the credit of the crown\r\n     in the hands of the factor of Castilla del Oro. One twentieth\r\n     of what God might thus give them, after the king should have\r\n     received his fifth, was to be devoted to pious purposes. The\r\n     net proceeds to be divided equally between the crown and the\r\n     discoverers, according to the amount contributed by each.\r\n     Wages paid the crew to be counted in the costs; or if they\r\n     went on shares, two thirds should go to the king and Niño, and\r\n     one third to the captain, officers, and men. Supplies were to\r\n     be exempt from duty, and the explorers should have an interest\r\n     in the lands discovered by them. The crown agreed to furnish\r\n     at Jamaica 2,000 loads of cassava-root, and 500 hogs; also ten\r\n     negro slaves, the explorer to pay the owners for ten Indian\r\n     slaves to serve as interpreters. For the faithful performance\r\n     of these and other obligations, the explorer was required to\r\n     give bonds in the sum of 2,000 ducats. Herrera, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     iv. cap. i., gives only a part of the contract; in _Squier's\r\n     MSS._, i. 12-14, is the document in full.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-3] A copy of this cédula may be found in _Squier's MSS._,\r\n     i.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-4] In the Expediente sobre el Cumplimiento de la\r\n     Cédula—see _Los Navíos de Vasco Nuñez_, in _Squier's MSS._—is\r\n     given at wearisome length the ceremony and sayings at this\r\n     delivery and the results. Briefly, on the 4th of February,\r\n     1520, Pedrarias humbled himself to the dust before the sacred\r\n     cédula; February 5th, he talked much, saying that he had\r\n     finished the ships begun by Vasco Nuñez; that they had cost\r\n     more than 50,000 ducados, beside sweat and blood; that with\r\n     them the great city of Panamá—'la cibdad de Panamá'—with its\r\n     gold mines on one side and pearl fisheries on the other, had\r\n     been founded and the country thereabout pacified, and that\r\n     if the king knew all this he would not take the ships from\r\n     those who had built them and give them to another; February\r\n     7th, Juan del Sauce declared that, unless the ships were\r\n     surrendered, all the gold, pearls, or other property taken in\r\n     them would belong, under the king's order, to the fleet of\r\n     Gil Gonzalez; February 8th, Pedrarias replied that without\r\n     the ships the city could neither be sustained nor labor\r\n     be continued, and he called on the royal officers present,\r\n     Puente, the treasurer, Marquez, the contador, and Juan de\r\n     Rivas, factor, to say that these things were so; but the\r\n     royal officers answered that Pedrarias must obey the king's\r\n     command and give Gil Gonzalez the ships, keeping one, perhaps,\r\n     with which to protect the city, and selling the others to Gil\r\n     Gonzalez on such terms as he and the owners might arrange. In\r\n     regard to withholding the ships Pedrarias was certainly in the\r\n     right, though it was dangerous, and he claimed that he would\r\n     obey and was obeying the king; but when, on February 9th, he\r\n     demanded that Gil Gonzalez should appear in person and lay\r\n     before him the instructions and plans of the expedition, he\r\n     became most coolly impudent.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-5] Squier, _Dis. Nic._, MSS., 13, says the worms\r\n     destroyed them, but Gil Gonzalez himself only remarks, _Carta\r\n     al Rey_, MSS., 1, 'Despues de hechos otros navios en la Ysla\r\n     de las perlas porque los 4 primeros que se hizieron en la\r\n     tierra firme se perdieron.'\r\n\r\n     [XIV-6] Some say from 200 to 80. Both numbers, however,\r\n     should be larger; for the expedition gained men at Acla, and\r\n     100 are mentioned as constituting one land party during the\r\n     expedition. _Gil Gonzalez_, _Carta al Rey_, MSS., 3.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-7] Tararequi Island, Galvano, _Discov._, 148, calls it;\r\n     others, Terequeri Islands. Gil Gonzalez writes plainly enough,\r\n     _Carta al Rey_, MS., 2, 'Me bolbí á la dicha Ysla de las\r\n     Perlas ... i de aí me partí a hazer el descubrimiento que V\r\n     M me mando hazer.' The same authority states that the second\r\n     four vessels were built at the Pearl Islands, the others\r\n     having been 'lost in the river 40 leagues distant.'\r\n\r\n     [XIV-8] For conflicting statements concerning this, compare\r\n     _Gil Gonzalez_, _Carta al Rey_, MS., 16, 36; _Andagoya's\r\n     Nar._, 31-2; _Niño_, _Asiento_, MS., in _Squier's MSS._, i.\r\n     14, and in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiv. 5-19;\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 65-71; _Las Casas_, _Hist.

Mex._, ii. 204-8; _Squier's Dis. Nic._,\r\n     MSS., 7-10.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-9] I follow the commander's own statement, made to the\r\n     royal authorities from Santo Domingo, March 6, 1524. Of this,\r\n     which I quote as _Carta de Gil Gonzalez Dávila al Rey_, I\r\n     have several copies in manuscript, the best being a part of\r\n     the first volume of the Squier Collection. This collection,\r\n     consisting of twenty-three volumes of manuscripts, beside\r\n     separate pieces on various early affairs in Central America\r\n     and Mexico, fell into my hands at the sale of the library\r\n     of the late E. G. Squier, so widely known as an antiquarian\r\n     and historical writer, a review of whose works will appear\r\n     in a subsequent volume. The opportunities afforded Mr Squier\r\n     by his official position as _chargé d'affaires_ to Central\r\n     America, in 1849, and by his researches, combined with a\r\n     natural bent as student and author, prompted the collection\r\n     of books and manuscripts relative to Central America, a large\r\n     proportion of which I found useful in filling gaps in my own\r\n     sixteenth-century material. It seems that Mr Squier intended\r\n     the publication of a series of documents for history, of\r\n     which the _Carta de Palacio_ was printed at Albany, 1859,\r\n     and numbered I. The first volume of the Squier Collection of\r\n     Manuscripts contains, beside the _Carta de Gil Gonzalez_,\r\n     several documents on Nicaraguan discovery certified by\r\n     Navarrete, Buckingham Smith, and Squier, as true copies of the\r\n     originals in the archives at Seville and in the Hydrographic\r\n     Collection, notable among which are _Real Cedula de S. M.\r\n     expedida en 18 de Junio de 1519, á Pedrarias Dávila, para que\r\n     entregase los Navios de Basco Nuñez a Gil Gonzales de Avila y\r\n     los requerimientos que pasaron sobre ello_; and _Relacion Del\r\n     Asiento y Capitulacion que se tomó con Andres Niño, Piloto\r\n     de su Magestad para el descubrimiento que prometió hazer en\r\n     el Mar del Sur con 3 Navios, y por Capitan de ellos á Gil\r\n     Gonzales Dávila_.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-10] Peter Martyr states that they passed over a body of\r\n     water to get to it; Herrera and Oviedo both testify to a large\r\n     island, which we might believe were any such island there.\r\n     The truth is, parts of the land were inundated at this time\r\n     by the heavy rains, so that the peninsula being cut off from\r\n     the mainland by the water made it appear an island.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-11] Later called Nicoya, from the cacique of that\r\n     country, which name it bears to-day. This was the San Lúcar\r\n     of Hurtado. See chap. xi., note 11, this volume. Kohl thinks\r\n     it may have been the 5th of April, the day of San Vicente\r\n     Ferrer, that the Spaniards arrived here. Gomara states that\r\n     in early times it was also called Golfo de Ortiña, and Golfo\r\n     de Guetares; _Goldschmidt's Cartography of the Pacific Coast_,\r\n     MS., ii. 111-13.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-12] Which was received by 9,017 natives, large and small,\r\n     in one day, and with such enthusiasm that the Spaniards even\r\n     wept. This is as much as one having only ordinary faith can be\r\n     expected to believe at once, yet the strain on one's credulity\r\n     becomes more severe when the right honorable Gil Gonzalez\r\n     calls heaven to witness that he told each man and woman, apart\r\n     from the others, that God did not want unwilling service, and\r\n     that each for himself expressed a desire for it. If we allow\r\n     him 15 hours for his day's work, it makes 61 persons an hour,\r\n     or one a minute, who were examined and baptized.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-13] The Spaniards were at this time ignorant of the use\r\n     to which these mounds were put. Had they known them to be\r\n     great altars upon which were sacrificed human beings, the mild\r\n     and philosophic Nicaragua might have had occasion to prove\r\n     the valor of his warriors.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-14] 'I digo mar,' says Gil Gonzalez, _Carta al Rey_, MS.,\r\n     'porque creze i mengua.'\r\n\r\n     [XIV-15] 'Los pilotos qve conmigo llebaba certifican qve\r\n     sale a la mar del norte; i si asi es, es mui grand nueba,\r\n     porqve abra de vna mar a otra 2 o 3 legvas de camino mui\r\n     llano.' Thus it will be seen that the question of interoceanic\r\n     communication attracted the attention of the first Europeans\r\n     who saw Lake Nicaragua, and this very naturally; for it must\r\n     be remembered that Gil Gonzalez was in search of a strait or\r\n     passage through the continent, and if perchance he should find\r\n     the Moluccas thereabout, his whole object would be attained.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-16] The word Nicaragua was first heard spoken by\r\n     Europeans at Nicoya, where Gil Gonzalez had been notified\r\n     of the country and its ruler. In the earliest reports it is\r\n     found written _Nicaragua_, _Micaragua_, _Nicorragua_, and\r\n     _Nicarao_. Upon the return of Gil Gonzalez the name Nicaragua\r\n     became famous, and beside being applied to the cacique and his\r\n     town, was gradually given to the surrounding country, and to\r\n     the lake. It was by some vaguely used to designate the whole\r\n     region behind and between Hibueras and Veragua. Later there\r\n     was the Provincia de Nicaragua, beside El Nuevo Reyno de Leon.\r\n     Herrera and many others mention the Indian pueblo by the lake.\r\n     For a time the lake was known as the _Mar Dulce_. Thus Colon\r\n     lays it down on his map, in 1527, as the _mar duce_, and the\r\n     town or province _micaragua_. Ribero, 1529, calls the lake\r\n     _mar dulce_ and the town _nicaragua_. Munich Atlas, No. vi.,\r\n     gives only _micaragua_, which No. vii. makes _nicaragua_.\r\n     Ramusio, _Viaggi_, iii. 455, gives _Nicaragva_ as a province.\r\n     Mercator, in his Atlas of 1574, gives the town of _Nicaragua_.\r\n     Iudocus Hondius, in _Drake's World Encomp._, applies the term\r\n     _Nicaragva_ to a province or large extent of country. Ogilby,\r\n     Dampier, De Laet, and other contemporary and later authorities\r\n     extend the name to the lake.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-17] The narrative says 3,000 or 4,000; I name the lowest\r\n     number, giving the reader the right of reducing at pleasure.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-18] The name of the bay remains; that of the island is\r\n     lost. The early names of the islands in this bay were _S.\r\n     Miguel la Possession_, _La Possession_, and _Esposescion_;\r\n     _Amapalla_, _Amapala_, or _I del Tigre_; _y. de flecheros_,\r\n     _Mangera_, or _Manguera_. Jefferys calls the bay _Fonseca_\r\n     or _Amapalla_. East of _b: de fomsequa_ Vaz Dourado places\r\n     the wood _monic_. Mercator locates the town _Canicol_ on\r\n     the southern shore. Ogilby places the town _Xeres_, De Laet\r\n     _Xerez_, near _B. de Fonseca_. On one map there is _Xeres_ or\r\n     _Chuluteca_, on the eastern shore, and _El viejo las Salinas_\r\n     river flowing into the bay.\r\n\r\n     [XIV-19] Further references to this voyage, unimportant,\r\n     however, are made in _Galvano's Discov._, 148-9, where it\r\n     is stated that 'Nigno' reached 'Tecoantepec'; _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, i. 440; _Ogilby's Am._, 238; _Crowe's\r\n     Cent. Am._, 58; _Gordon's Anc.

At p. 19, vol. ii. et seq., _Recop. de\r\n     Indias_, we find the ordenanzas de la poblacion de ciudades y\r\n     villas begun by Charles V., in 1523, and continued by Philip\r\n     II., Felipe III., and Felipe IV., down to 1656. Therein it was\r\n     ordered that in choosing a site for settlement, which always\r\n     implied the building of a town or city, care must be taken\r\n     that the place be suitable in every respect. It should be\r\n     ascertained if it was a healthy locality, if the young natives\r\n     were well and strong, if many of the people attained old age,\r\n     if the country was favorable to agriculture or mining, and\r\n     of easy access by land and sea; if by the sea, there should\r\n     be a good harbor, and, if possible, the town must be placed\r\n     by a river. Open pueblos must not be built on the seashore\r\n     because of corsairs. The site being chosen, a plan of the\r\n     place must be made, the squares formed, and the streets and\r\n     lots laid out, and measured by cord and rule. The location\r\n     of the plaza, or public and official square, was of primary\r\n     import, since from it to the principal entrances ran the most\r\n     important streets. After the land had been set apart for town\r\n     lots and ejidos, or commons, the country adjacent was to be\r\n     divided into four parts, one of them for the person making\r\n     the settlement, and the remainder to be assigned by lot to the\r\n     settlers. In inland settlements, the church should be located\r\n     at a distance from the plaza, and on the street running\r\n     from the plaza to the church were to be placed the _casas\r\n     reales_, or offices and dwelling of the crown officials,\r\n     the _cabildo_, _consejo_, or the city-hall, the _aduana_,\r\n     or custom-house, and the _atarazana_, or arsenal. Or the\r\n     church was placed on one side of the plaza; the royal houses\r\n     and the municipal house on another; the custom-house on the\r\n     third; while the remaining side might be devoted to business\r\n     houses or dwellings. Thus a stranger entering any Spanish\r\n     town could find without direction all the principal places.\r\n     Marketing-stalls, usually with an awning, were admitted in the\r\n     plaza. If a seaboard town, the church must be so placed that\r\n     it could be seen on entering the harbor, and so constructed\r\n     as to serve for purposes of defence. In this case the plaza\r\n     must be at the landing; if inland, in the centre of the town.\r\n     In form it must be a parallelogram, the length to be at least\r\n     one and a half times the width, as the best shape for feats\r\n     of horsemanship; its size should be, according to population,\r\n     not less than 200 by 300 feet, nor more than 800 by 532 feet,\r\n     a good size being 600 by 400 feet. From the plaza, whose\r\n     corners stood toward the four cardinal points, issued four\r\n     principal streets, one from the middle of each side, and\r\n     two smaller streets from each corner. In cold countries the\r\n     streets had to be wide; in hot countries, narrow. Houses not\r\n     to be built within 300 _pasos_ or 750 feet, of the walls or\r\n     stockade. Town lots and lands not distributed to settlers\r\n     belonged to the king, and were reserved for future settlers.\r\n     Then the law states how first settlers must hasten with their\r\n     house-building, after having planted and assured themselves\r\n     of food for the season, building with economy and strength,\r\n     and throwing round the town palisades and intrenchments.\r\n     The houses must be uniform, and with good accommodations for\r\n     horses.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     Any ten or more married men might unite to form a new\r\n     settlement, and might elect annually from among themselves\r\n     _alcaldes ordinarios_ and other municipal officers. When\r\n     it was possible to establish a _villa de Españoles_ with\r\n     a council of alcaldes ordinarios and regidores, and there\r\n     was a responsible person with whom to make an agreement for\r\n     settlement, the agreement was to be as follows: Within a time\r\n     specified there must be from ten to thirty settlers, each\r\n     with one horse, ten milch cows, four oxen, one brood mare,\r\n     one sow, twenty ewes of Castile, six hens, and a cock. A\r\n     clergyman must be provided, the first incumbent to be named\r\n     by the chief of the colony, and his successors in accordance\r\n     with the royal right of patronage. A church must be built,\r\n     which the founder of the settlement supplied with ornaments,\r\n     and to which were granted lands. Any one agreeing to form a\r\n     settlement, and conforming to the regulations, had given him\r\n     land equivalent to four square leagues, distant at least five\r\n     leagues from any other Spanish settlement; and he was himself\r\n     to enter into agreement with each enrolled settler to give\r\n     a town lot, lands for pasturage and cultivation, and as many\r\n     _peonías_, or shares of foot-soldiers, and _caballerías_, or\r\n     shares of cavalrymen, as each would obligate himself to work,\r\n     provided that to no one was to be given more than five peonías\r\n     or three caballerías. The principal with whom an agreement for\r\n     settling was made, to hold civil and criminal jurisdiction\r\n     in first instance, during life, and for that of one son or\r\n     heir, and from him appeal might lie to the alcalde mayor\r\n     or the audiencia of the district. He might appoint alcaldes\r\n     ordinarios, regidores, and other municipal officers. Those\r\n     going from Spain as first settlers were exempted from the\r\n     payment of _almojarifazgo_, or export duty, or other crown\r\n     dues, on what they took for their household and maintenance\r\n     during the first voyage to the Indies. Bachelors should be\r\n     persuaded to marry.\r\n\r\n     When a colony was about to leave a city to make a settlement,\r\n     the _justicia_ and _regimiento_ should file with the\r\n     _escribano del consejo_ a list of the persons migrating;\r\n     and lest the mother city should be depopulated, those only\r\n     were eligible who had no town lots or agricultural lands.\r\n     The number of colonists being complete, they were to elect\r\n     officers, and each colonist to register the sum he intended\r\n     to employ in the enterprise. And even after the settlement\r\n     had been begun, whether as _colonia_, that is, colonists\r\n     in voluntary association, or _adelantamiento_, _alcaldía\r\n     mayor_, _corregimiento_, enterprises headed respectively by\r\n     an adelantado, alcalde mayor, or corregidor, or _villa_, or\r\n     _lugar_, the fathers of it were forbidden to wholly leave the\r\n     people to themselves.\r\n\r\n     Discoverers, pacificators, first settlers and their immediate\r\n     descendants, possessed advantages over others. They were made\r\n     _hijosdalgo de solar conocido_, with all the honors, according\r\n     to law and custom, of hijosdalgo and gentlemen of Spain. They\r\n     might bear arms, by giving bonds, before any justice, that\r\n     they would use them solely in self-defence. And that it might\r\n     be known who were entitled to reward, viceroys and presidents\r\n     of audiencias were directed to examine into the merits of\r\n     cases, and see that a book was kept by the _escribano de\r\n     gobernacion_, in which were recorded the services and merits\r\n     of every person seeking preferment.\r\n\r\n     For the government of the settlement, the governor in whose\r\n     district it might be, had to declare whether it was to\r\n     be _ciudad_, _villa_, or _lugar_, that is to say, a town\r\n     less than a _villa_, and greater than _aldea_. A _ciudad\r\n     metropolitana_, or capital of the province, to have a _juez_\r\n     with the title of _adelantado_, that is to say, a military\r\n     and political governor of a province; or _alcalde mayor_,\r\n     governor of a pueblo not the capital of the province; or\r\n     _corregidor_, a magistrate with criminal jurisdiction only;\r\n     or _alcalde ordinario_, mayor with criminal jurisdiction. This\r\n     _juez_ was to have jurisdiction _in solidum_, and jointly with\r\n     the _regimiento_. The administration of public affairs was\r\n     vested in two or three treasury officials, twelve _regidores_,\r\n     or members of the town council, appointed, not elected; two\r\n     _fieles ejecutores_, or regidores having charge of weights;\r\n     in each parish two _jurados_, who saw that people were well\r\n     provided, especially with provisions; a _procurador general_,\r\n     attorney with general powers; a _mayordomo_, having charge\r\n     of public property; an _escribano de consejo_, notary of the\r\n     council; two _escribanos públicos_; one _escribano de minas\r\n     y registros_; a _pregonero mayor_, official vendue-master; a\r\n     _corredor de lonja_, merchants' broker, and two _porteros_,\r\n     or janitors of the town council. If the city was _diocesana_,\r\n     or _sufragánea_, it must have eight regidores, and the other\r\n     officers in perpetuity; villas and lugares only to have\r\n     an alcalde ordinario, say, four regidores, an alguacil, or\r\n     bailiff, an _escribano de consejo y público_, and a mayordomo.\r\n\r\n     [XV-2] [Illustration: ARMS OF THE CITY OF PANAMÁ.]\r\n\r\n     The title was 'Nueva Ciudad de Panamá.' _Décadas_, in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.

On the left three caravels, significant of\r\n     Spice Island or other commerce, over which shines the north\r\n     star. Above the golden field a crown, and round the field a\r\n     border of castles and lions.

Born in Alava province, he came to the\r\n     Isthmus in 1514, and took an active part in the various\r\n     expeditions for its subjugation and settlement. Through\r\n     the favor of Pedrarias, whose wife's maid he married, he\r\n     rose to encomendero, to regidor of Panamá, and, in 1522,\r\n     to inspector-general of the Isthmus Indians. The present\r\n     expedition, which brought back wonderful reports of the Inca\r\n     empire, might have gained him the glories of that conquest,\r\n     or at least he might have shared them with Pizarro, had his\r\n     health not broken down. As it was, he merely acquired wealth\r\n     as agent for the Peruvian hero, and although he rose afterward\r\n     to adelantado and governor of New Castile, his integrity\r\n     and comparative want of audacity prevented him from reaping\r\n     the benefits within reach of less scrupulous rivals. The\r\n     original of his well-written narrative, relating the history\r\n     of the Isthmus and adjoining region in connection with his\r\n     career, was found by Navarrete in the Seville Archives, and\r\n     published in his _Col. de Viages_, iii. 393-459, from which\r\n     source Markham made the translation issued in 1865 by the\r\n     Hakluyt Society. Oviedo's account of Andagoya's career, from a\r\n     different source, iv. 126-32, confirms the general exactness\r\n     of his narrative, although Acosta, _Comp. Hist. Nueva\r\n     Granada_, 383, declares it colored with a view to advocate\r\n     his claim to the governorship of New Castile. _Helps' Span.\r\n     Conq._, iii. 426, and _March y Labores_, _Marina Española_,\r\n     ii. 121, give Andagoya's voyage.\r\n\r\n     [XVI-1] [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     Called by Herrera, Ymabite, and by Juarros, _Guat._, following\r\n     him, Imabite.

Fray\r\n     Gil Gonzalez Dávila, in _Teatro Ecles._, i. 233, gives a\r\n     representation of what he calls the 'armas de la civdad de\r\n     Nicaragva,' consisting of a shield bearing in its field a\r\n     rampant lion with the left paw resting on a globe. The shield\r\n     is surmounted by a crown. In view of the usual remoteness\r\n     of this writer from the truth, we may apply the term city of\r\n     Nicaragua to any city in Nicaragua, notwithstanding he affirms\r\n     it to be the place discovered by Gil Gonzalez in 1522, and\r\n     peopled by Hernandez and Pedrarias.\r\n\r\n     [XVI-2] Consisting of gold from 12 to 18 carats by actual\r\n     assay, amounting to 17,000 pesos de oro; of an inferior\r\n     quality, known as _hachas_, 15,363 pesos; in rattle-shaped\r\n     pieces, said to be of no standard value, 6,182 pesos. _Gil\r\n     Gonzalez Dávila_, _Carta al Rey_, MS.

Despite the peculiarity of a groove in the lower\r\n     lip, which gave it the appearance of being split, the face\r\n     was most attractive. 'Era un Hector en el esfuerço, para\r\n     combatir.' He was married to a Portuguese, Felipa de Araujo,\r\n     by whom he had a daughter. _Hist. Verdad._, 176, 177, 240.\r\n     Further references in chap. vi. vol. i., _Hist. Mexico_, this\r\n     series.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-7] The lobes of his ears were shorn by captors, he\r\n     said, of a fortress which he had aided too obstinately in\r\n     defending. Bernal Diaz appears to doubt this explanation.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 176, 177.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-8] The agent, Alonso de Contreras, had received 8,000\r\n     pesos de oro for the purpose, in order that the expedition\r\n     should not be hampered for want of means, nor be obliged to\r\n     prey at once upon the natives. _Oviedo_, iii. 459. Cortés\r\n     estimates the total cost of the expedition at over 50,000\r\n     ducats. _Mem._, in _Doc. Inéd._, iv. 227; _Instruc._, in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 5; _Gastos_,\r\n     in _id._, xii. 386, with details of expenses. The purchases\r\n     were made ere the presence of the fleet should raise prices\r\n     at Habana, and yet a fanega of maize cost two pesos de oro,\r\n     a sword eight pesos, a crossbow twenty, and a firelock one\r\n     hundred; while a shipmaster received eight hundred pesos a\r\n     month. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 243.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-9] 'Se habia confederado el tal Cristóbal Dolit con\r\n     Diego Velazquez, y que iba con voluntad de no me obedecer,\r\n     antes de le entregar la tierra al dicho Diego Velazquez\r\n     y juntarse con él contra mi.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 337.\r\n     'Cõcertarõ ... q̃ entre él, y Christoval de Oli, tuviesen\r\n     aquella tierra de Higueras ... y q̃ el Diego Velazquez le\r\n     proveeria de lo q̃ huviesse menester.' _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 177; _Oviedo_, iii. 113; _Gomara_, _Hist.

Verdad._, 177.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-11] 'Con que començò a entender que se yua apartando de\r\n     la obediencia de Cortés.' _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap.\r\n     xii.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-12] _Juarros_, _Guat._, 42-3. It was soon abandoned.\r\n     See chap. xvi., note 5, this volume.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-13] This according to _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 269, and\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 467, who do not, however, clearly indicate\r\n     that Valenzuela was one of Olid's officers. Informed of the\r\n     wreck, by Casas probably, Cortés sent a vessel for them, which\r\n     was also wrecked, on the Cuban coast. Bernal Diaz, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 208, alludes to this party as twenty-five men sent\r\n     to kidnap Indians.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-14] 'Cum narium et venarum gutturis summo tumore præ\r\n     ira, sæpe dedit de tanta animi perturbatione signa, neque a\r\n     verbis id significantibus abstinuit.' _Peter Martyr_, dec.\r\n     viii. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-15] Cortés did not overlook the application of the\r\n     act to his own escapade with Velazquez. In complaining\r\n     to the emperor, he assumes that many will regard it as a\r\n     _pena peccati_, but explains that Olid had no share in this\r\n     expedition, as he himself had had in the one from Cuba.\r\n     With respect to the present fleet, he regretted not so much\r\n     the loss of 40,000 pesos de oro as the injury the rebellion\r\n     must cause the imperial interest, in delay of exploration\r\n     and settlement and in excesses against Indians. Further,\r\n     he remarks pointedly, such revolts will deter loyal and\r\n     enterprising men from embarking their fortune in the service\r\n     of the crown. _Cartas_, 337.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-16] _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. xiii. Cortés,\r\n     _Cartas_, 336, calls him 'primo,' which may bear the same\r\n     interpretation. Oviedo, iii. 517, calls him brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-17] Fitted out with sails and rigging of vessels\r\n     seized from traders, and with pressed crews; the fleet was\r\n     ordered to intercept any communication and aid for Honduras.\r\n     _Testimonio_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii.\r\n     274-7. They were all the vessels that could be obtained, it\r\n     seems. One or both of the small craft deserted and took refuge\r\n     in Cuba, there to leave testimony. See also _Relacion de los\r\n     Oidores_, in _id._, xiv. 43; _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 336. Bernal\r\n     Diaz places the number of vessels at five and the soldiers at\r\n     100, naming 3 conquistadores. _Hist. Verdad._, 194. Out of\r\n     the 150 the soldiers probably did number 100, and there may\r\n     have been five vessels, for Herrera states that Cortés sent\r\n     a ship with stores under Pedro Gonzalez to follow Casas. Off\r\n     the very coast of Honduras he was overtaken by a storm which\r\n     drove him back to Pánuco with the belief that the fleet must\r\n     have perished, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. xiii. Gomara, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 243, mentions only two vessels.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-18] 'Assi estuuieron todo aquel dia,' says Herrera,\r\n     _loc. cit._, who leaves the reader to suppose that at one time\r\n     the advantage leant to Olid's side and caused Casas to hoist\r\n     a flag of truce which was disregarded; but other authorities\r\n     do not take this view.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-19] Four soldiers. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 194;\r\n     without loss, says Herrera.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-20] 'O esperando con intenciõ de se ir a otra baia a\r\n     desembarcar,' is one of the suppositions of _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 194. 'Briones ... en teniendo auiso de\r\n     Francisco de las Casas, se apartò de Christoual de Olid,\r\n     y tomò la voz de Cortes.' _Herrera_, _ubi sup._ It appears\r\n     that Briones had by this time gained an advantage over Gil\r\n     Gonzalez, capturing over 50 of his men; but he now released\r\n     them under certain conditions. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 459. Bernal\r\n     Diaz assumes that Briones' revolt occurred later and that he\r\n     set out for Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-21] After convincing him by means of two or three days\r\n     of exposure and starvation, as Bernal Diaz and Gomara seem to\r\n     intimate. Herrera assumes that he won him by kind treatment.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-22] After the defeat by Briones, Gil Gonzalez seems to\r\n     have become bewildered. Leaving a few followers at Nito under\r\n     Diego de Armenta, he embarked in three vessels, touched at San\r\n     Gil to hang Francisco Riquelme and a clergyman for having led\r\n     a revolt, and thence proceeded to Choloma. Owing to Briones'\r\n     defection his capture was intrusted to Juan Ruano. _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. iii. lib. v. cap. xiii. The seizure was effected with the\r\n     loss of his nephew Gil de Ávila and eight soldiers. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 194; _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 459. Oviedo\r\n     assumes that Gonzalez was entrapped by false promises, iii.\r\n     188.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-23] 'Con un cuchillo de escribanías, que otra arma\r\n     no tenia ... diciendo: \"Ya no es tiempo de sufrir mas este\r\n     tirano.\"' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 460.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-24] 'Aqui del Rey, e de Cortés contra este tirano, que\r\n     ya no es tiempo de mas sufrir sus tiranias.' _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 195.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-25] According to Herrera, the confessor, awed by the\r\n     proclamation, revealed the hiding-place, after exacting a\r\n     promise that no harm should befall his protégé. The promise\r\n     was disregarded on the principle that 'dead man wages no war,'\r\n     and although Olid _was dead_ when the hour came for execution,\r\n     yet the _corpse_ was publicly beheaded, dec. iii. lib. v. cap.\r\n     xii. Other authorities do not state how he was discovered or\r\n     arrested. 'Otro dia por la mañana, hecho su proceso contra\r\n     él, ambos los capitanes (Casas and Gonzalez) juntamente le\r\n     sentenciaron á muerte.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 460. 'Assi fenecio\r\n     su vida, por tener en poco su contrario.' _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 244. His brother, Antonio de Olid, sought justice\r\n     before the Consejo de Indias against Casas and Gonzalez for\r\n     the murder. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. x. cap. xi.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-26] In Estremadura.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-27] 'Halláronse ciento y diez hombres que dijeron que\r\n     querian poblar, y los demás todos dijeron que se querian ir\r\n     con Francisco de las Casas.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 460. See\r\n     also _Informe_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     131, 141. These did not comprise Gonzalez' followers, but may\r\n     have been all of Olid's and Casas' men who cared to remain in\r\n     Honduras; yet it seems strange that the latter should have\r\n     allowed so large a number to abandon a province which they\r\n     had been sent to occupy.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-28] Oviedo assumes that Casas would brook no rival\r\n     after his triumph, and made Gonzalez a prisoner, 'é llevólo\r\n     en grillos á la Nueva España.' iii. 188-9, 518. The last\r\n     assertion is even less likely. Affairs had meanwhile changed\r\n     in Mexico, and like Casas he fell into the hands of Cortés'\r\n     enemies, who were at first intent on their execution, but\r\n     ultimately sent both to Spain for trial. One of the charges\r\n     was the murder of Olid. Gonzalez was wrecked on Fayal Island,\r\n     but reached Seville in April, 1526, only to be confined in\r\n     the atarazana, or arsenal. Released on parole, as a knight\r\n     commander of Santiago, he returned to his home at Ávila, and\r\n     there died not long after, says Oviedo, deeply repentant of\r\n     his sins. _Dávila_, _Testimonio_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xii. 362-7.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-29] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 245. A minority soon\r\n     after attempted to replace Medina by the alguacil Orbaneja.\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 133-5. Testimony\r\n     on the foundation of Trujillo, in _id._, xiv. 44-7.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-30] Herrera states that Ruano, who captured Gonzalez,\r\n     had gone to Cuba after Casas' triumph, but the testimony in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 127, etc., shows\r\n     that he had been picked up by Moreno at San Gil.\r\n\r\n     [XVII-31] He himself being the probable captain. Some sixteen\r\n     slaves were kidnapped here, and the rest at San Gil. The\r\n     account of Moreno's proceedings, by different witnesses, is\r\n     to be found in _Informacion hecha por órden de Hernan Cortés\r\n     sobre excesos por Moreno_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, ii. 127-79; and in _Relacion de los Oidores_, in _id._,\r\n     xiv. 39, etc. When the emperor learned of the kidnapping,\r\n     he angrily ordered the release of the slaves, and their good\r\n     treatment pending an investigation. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     x. cap. xi. Cortés intimates that Ruano had used persuasion\r\n     with Moreno to obtain the command. _Cartas_, 462-3.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-1] Herrera assumes stronger reasons, the arrival of\r\n     the supply vessel sent after Casas with the report that the\r\n     latter could not have escaped the storm which drove her back\r\n     to Mexico, and the rumored victory of Olid over both his\r\n     opponents. But it is pretty certain that Cortés heard nothing\r\n     of the latter affair, at least while he was in Mexico, dec.\r\n     iii. lib. v. cap. xiii.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-2] The safety of Mexico was above other considerations;\r\n     the road to Honduras was unknown and full of danger; the\r\n     emperor would punish Olid. Such were the arguments used.\r\n     Cortés replied that unless prompt chastisement was inflicted\r\n     others would follow the example, and disorder must follow,\r\n     with loss to himself of respect and territory. The crown\r\n     officials demanded in the emperor's name that he should\r\n     remain. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 245. Cortés yielded, and\r\n     wrote to the emperor that he had intended to march through\r\n     Guatemala but would remain, especially since he expected news\r\n     from Honduras within two months. _Carta_, Oct. 15, 1524. A\r\n     few days later he began his march.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-3] _Cartas_, Sept. 3, 1526, 395-6.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-4] In the letter from Honduras he says October 12, but\r\n     this very generally accepted date must be a misprint, since\r\n     in one of the two letters dated at Mexico within the following\r\n     three days, he writes to the emperor that he would not leave.\r\n     He could hardly dare to reveal that he had gone, while writing\r\n     that he was still at Mexico; but he was on the way before\r\n     November.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-5] 'Sacó de aquí ciento y veinte de caballo y veinte\r\n     escopeteros y otros tantos ballesteros y gente de pié,'\r\n     besides 4,000 to 5,000 Indians. _Carta de Albornoz_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 485. A number of Spaniards\r\n     at least were added on the way to Goazacoalco, where review\r\n     was held, showing, according to Bernal Diaz, upward of 250\r\n     soldiers, beside arrivals from Spain, 130 being horsemen, and\r\n     3,000 warriors from different parts of the country, beside\r\n     servants of caciques. _Hist. Verdad._, 195-7. This agrees\r\n     with Gomara's 150 cavalry, 150 infantry, 3,000 warriors, and\r\n     a number of servant-women. _Hist. Mex._, 251. Cortés, at this\r\n     same review, mentions only 93 horsemen with 150 horses, and\r\n     30 and odd foot-soldiers. _Cartas_, 398.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-6] Prescott, whose account of this famous expedition\r\n     and its connecting incidents, indicates both a want of\r\n     authorities and an imperfect study, mentions only the\r\n     sovereigns of Mexico and Tlacopan. Helps follows him. But\r\n     Gomara names also the king of Tezcuco, besides a number of\r\n     caciques, and gives their tragic fate, as does Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     with greater detail. _Horribles Crueldades_, 79.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-7] Bernal Diaz names a number of the officers and staff\r\n     servants, as Carranza, mayordomo; Iasso, maestresala, or chief\r\n     butler; Salazar, chamberlain; Licenciado Pero Lopeza, doctor,\r\n     a vintner, a pantler, a butler, etc.; 2 pages with lances, 8\r\n     grooms, and 2 falconers; 5 musicians, etc.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-8] Bernal Diaz relieves his feelings in a loud grumble,\r\n     which softens as he recalls the consolation to his pride in\r\n     being given for a time a petty command. _Hist. Verdad._, 197.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-9] 'Y aun hasta Nicaragua ... y hasta dõde residia\r\n     Pedrarias.' _Gomara_, _Hist.

It was 20 leagues in length, and its extreme eastern\r\n     pueblo was Anaxuxuca.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-13] Guezalapa, or Quetzatlapan.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-14] Zagoatan, Zagutan, etc.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-15] Ocumba was one of the pueblos discovered up the\r\n     river.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-16] 'Estuvieron muy cerca de se ahogar dos ó tres\r\n     españoles,' is the prudent form in which Cortés disguises this\r\n     and other unpleasant facts to the emperor. _Cartas_, 404.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-17] An anthropophagous Mexican was here burned alive,\r\n     as a warning against such indulgences; and a letter was given\r\n     to the leading cacique to inform other Spaniards that he\r\n     was a friend to the white man. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 252;\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. vii. cap. viii.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-18] Ascension is the name applied by Cortés to the\r\n     Gulf of Honduras.

Verdad._, 196, 210. Albornoz,\r\n     one of the rulers appointed by Cortés over Mexico, relates\r\n     in a letter to the emperor, dated 15 December, 1525, that\r\n     according to reports from Xicalanco traders to Ordaz, the\r\n     party of Cortés had been killed seven to eight moons before,\r\n     in an island city, seven suns distant from Xicalanco, called\r\n     Cuzamelco. They had been surprised by night and slaughtered\r\n     with sword and fire. A number of captives had been reserved\r\n     for the table, but the flesh being found bitter of taste it\r\n     had been cast into the lake. _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

Bernal Diaz states\r\n     that four foragers were killed on this river. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     198.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-23] The natives reported two rivers, one very large,\r\n     and bad marshes, on the three days' road to Acalan. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist.

Sandoval dared not trust his own attendants with a secret\r\n     whereon depended his supper, but went in person with Diaz to\r\n     convoy it. The friars received liberal contributions from the\r\n     men, but the Indians were neglected, says Ixtlilxochitl, the\r\n     kings and caciques alone being given as a favor a little of\r\n     the maize set aside for the horses. _Horribles Crueldades_,\r\n     87.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-29] Cortés writes Teutiercas, Tentacras; Gomara,\r\n     Teuticaccac; Herrera, Titacat.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-30] Bernal Diaz's rather confused account states that\r\n     Cortés demanded bridges to be built, but was told that the\r\n     caciques of the different pueblos had first to be consulted.\r\n     Supplies being needed, Mazariegos was sent with 80 men in\r\n     canoes to different settlements to obtain supplies, and\r\n     found ready response. The next pueblo reached by the army was\r\n     deserted and without food. _Hist. Verdad._, 200. The above\r\n     seems doubtful.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-31] The plan is said to have been imparted to\r\n     sympathizers in Mexico, with the recommendation to rise on\r\n     a certain day against the colonists. 'Y de aqui creyeron\r\n     muchos que naciò la fama de la muerte de Cortes.' _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. iii. lib. vii. cap. ix. For this uprising there was\r\n     opportunity enough, says Gomara, during the anarchy prevalent\r\n     during Cortés' absence; but the Indians were waiting further\r\n     orders from Quauhtemotzin. Finally their preparations aroused\r\n     the suspicions of the colonists, and they took precautions.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 250, 258. According to Cortés the Indians,\r\n     after killing the Spaniards, were to rouse Honduras and the\r\n     intermediate country ere they passed on to Mexico. All vessels\r\n     were to be seized, so as to prevent alarm from being given.\r\n     _Cartas_, 420.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-32] Mexicaltzin, afterward baptized as Cristóbal, to\r\n     whom the conspirators, says Cortés, had promised a province\r\n     for his share of the spoil. _Cartas_, 420-1. Bernal Diaz\r\n     states that the revelation was made by two prominent caciques,\r\n     Tapia and Juan Velazquez, the latter captain-general under\r\n     Quauhtemotzin when he was ruler. _Hist. Verdad._, 200.\r\n     According to Ixtlilxochitl, the Indians were imitating the\r\n     Spaniards in the festivities which precede Lent, but in such\r\n     a manner as to arouse the suspicion of Cortés. One cause for\r\n     the enjoyment was a statement by Cortés that here they would\r\n     turn back to Mexico. The general called his spy Costemexi,\r\n     of Ixtapalapan or Mexicaltzinco, and bade him ascertain what\r\n     was going on. He soon returned to report that the three kings\r\n     and six courtiers had been engaged in a humorous dispute\r\n     as to which of the trio the now conquered provinces should\r\n     belong to. Tlacatecatl, one of the chief lords, thereupon\r\n     observed that if discord had brought about the fall of the\r\n     native empire, they had gained instead the supreme happiness\r\n     of instruction in the true faith. After this came tales and\r\n     songs. When tortured some years after by Prince Ixtlilxochitl,\r\n     the spy insisted that he had represented the case only as\r\n     above stated, but that Cortés chose to interpret it as a\r\n     malicious plot. _Horribles Crueldades_, 90-3. This version is\r\n     doubtful in its details, and for the reason that the author's\r\n     chief effort is to vindicate the natives. The cause for the\r\n     rejoicing at a return to Mexico from Acalan savors rather of\r\n     a promise from the conspirators than from Cortés.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-33] The kings had formed it, and although they had not\r\n     been parties to it, yet as subjects they naturally desired\r\n     the liberty and weal of their lords. _Gomara_, _Herrera_,\r\n     _Cortés_, _Bernal Diaz_. The two former implicate the three\r\n     allied kings, the latter only the two of Mexico and Tlacopan.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-34] The rest being spared, since they had been guilty\r\n     chiefly of listening to the plot, says Cortés; 'pero quedaron\r\n     procesos abiertos para que ... puedan ser castigados,' if\r\n     required. The execution took place within a few days of the\r\n     disclosure. _Cartas_, 421. Bernal Diaz, Herrera, and Gomara\r\n     agree. The latter adds that king Cohuanacoch, of Tezcuco, who\r\n     had also plotted, died some time before of bad food and water.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 274. Torquemada adds five caciques to the three\r\n     royal victims, according to the native version. i. 576.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-35] _Hist. Verdad._, 200.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-36] 'Por carnestollendas ... en Izancanac.' _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 258-9. On February 26, 1525, specifies\r\n     Vetancurt; on a Tuesday, three hours before dawn, adds\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, who also declares that the native songs and\r\n     versions place it at Teotilac, and it certainly appears to\r\n     have been carried out before the capital was reached. The\r\n     Mexicans were so oppressed by hardships, says Bernal Diaz,\r\n     that they seemed to be quite indifferent; still, the Spaniards\r\n     hastened the departure for fear of an uprising. He places\r\n     the occurrence at a pueblo beyond Acalan. Ixtlilxochitl tells\r\n     another story. The kings were brought out three hours before\r\n     dawn for fear of a tumult. The two of Mexico and Tlacopan had\r\n     already been hanged, and Cohuanacoch was about to be, when his\r\n     brother, Ixtlilxochitl, being advised, rushed forth and called\r\n     upon the Indians. Perceiving the danger, Cortés cut the rope\r\n     and saved the half-strangled king of Tezcuco. He thereupon\r\n     proceeded to explain to Ixtlilxochitl the just reasons\r\n     which had brought about the execution. The prince appeared\r\n     convinced, and dismissed the auxiliaries, who stood ready\r\n     to fall upon the Spaniards. The chief motive, however, for\r\n     sparing them, was not the justice of the deed, for he regarded\r\n     it ever as a treacherous one, but the fear of wars that might\r\n     result from a revolt and carry desolation over his country,\r\n     checking the progress of the saving faith. Cohuanacoch, whom\r\n     Cortés accused as the chief conspirator, was carried with the\r\n     army in a hammock, suffering severely from the wrenching of\r\n     the noose. His grief brought about an intestinal hemorrhage,\r\n     from which he died within a few days. _Horribles Crueldades_,\r\n     98-4.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-37] 'Y sin auer mas prouãças, Cortes mandò ahorcar\r\n     al Guatemuz, y al señor de Tacuba.... Y fue esta muerte que\r\n     les dieron muy injustamente dada, y pareciò mal a todos los\r\n     que ibamos aquella jornada.' _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     200. But his account of all this expedition is questionable,\r\n     and his testimony loses force through the evident fact that\r\n     he is carried away by sympathy for the kings, who had often\r\n     favored him, and for the natives to whom his later condition\r\n     in life bound him rather closely. He certainly admits the\r\n     strong accusation and the confirmatory admission of the\r\n     victims, the king of Tlacopan stating, for instance, that\r\n     he and Quauhtemotzin had declared one death preferable to\r\n     the daily deaths suffered. Torquemada adopts the version\r\n     of a Tezcucan manuscript, which relates that Cohuanacoch on\r\n     one occasion remarked to his royal confrères that, if they\r\n     chose to be disloyal, the Spaniards might have to regret\r\n     past injuries. Quauhtemotzin hastened to silence him by\r\n     observing that walls had ears, which might misunderstand\r\n     such expressions. A plebeian native reported them, and that\r\n     very night those who had been present at the conversation,\r\n     three kings and five caciques, were found hanging from a\r\n     ceiba-tree. Torquemada will not believe that the Indians\r\n     intended to revolt, especially since their country was now\r\n     divided, but that Cortés regarded the kings as a burden, i.\r\n     575-6. Cavo, _Tres Siglos_, i. 46-8, agrees, and Gomara even\r\n     intimates something to this effect in saying that Cortés\r\n     ought to have preserved so prominent and brave a captive to\r\n     point the triumph of his victories, but that the dangerous\r\n     circumstances must have prevented him. _Hist. Mex._, 259.\r\n     'Es notorio, que Quauhtemoc y los demás señores murieron\r\n     sin culpa, y que les levantaron falso testimonio.' Indeed,\r\n     continues Ixtlilxochitl, when the Indians complained to the\r\n     kings of maltreatment, they counselled submission. But his\r\n     story is so full of glaring misstatements and absurdities,\r\n     and so evident is the desire to relieve his kinsmen from\r\n     the traitor's brand, that he cannot be relied on. _Horribles\r\n     Crueldades_, 82, etc.; _Id._, _Relaciones_, _Kingsborough's\r\n     Mex. Antiq._, ix. 440, etc. Brasseur de Bourbourg follows him\r\n     implicitly of course, as he does almost any record from native\r\n     source. There was no witness except the spy, and the princes\r\n     were not allowed to defend themselves. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv.\r\n     608. He evidently pays no attention whatever to the Spanish\r\n     versions. Bustamante accepts even more implicitly the records\r\n     of those whom he prefers to regard as his ancestors. See his\r\n     edition of Gomara, _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, ii. 135-6.\r\n     Cano, who married the cousin and widow of Quauhtemotzin, calls\r\n     the execution of the three kings a murder, as may be expected\r\n     from his dislike of Cortés. _Oviedo_, iii. 549. Carried away\r\n     by hyperbolic flights of fancy, wherein he surpasses even\r\n     Solis himself, Salazar condemns the deed as based on false\r\n     testimony, and blames Cortés for irritating the natives by\r\n     resorting to so rash a measure. _Conq. Mex._, 240-3. Father\r\n     Duran emphasizes this with well-known sympathy for the native\r\n     cause. 'Y levantándose contra él algunos testigos falsos le\r\n     mandó á horcar.' _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 522. On imperfect\r\n     evidence and without a trial, says _Robertson_, _Hist. Am._,\r\n     ii. 138. Prescott sympathizes with Quauhtemotzin and regards\r\n     the testimony as insufficient, while Helps, _Cortés_, 208-9,\r\n     doubts the statements of Bernal Diaz, and refers to the act\r\n     as cruel practical wisdom. The chief ground for this view is\r\n     that Cortés, as an hidalgo, would not lie, and can therefore\r\n     be relied upon. It has not been my fortune to acquire such\r\n     faith, and I fancy that a closer study of his hero might\r\n     have changed Sir Arthur Helps' views. Alaman, a Mexican with\r\n     Spanish sympathies, believes in the conspiracy, but regards\r\n     the execution as a blot on Cortés. Quauhtemotzin, at least,\r\n     should have been sent to Spain after the fall of Mexico.\r\n     _Disert._, i. 214. This certainly would have been the best way\r\n     to secure and make use of him. Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones\r\n     Ilvstres_, 114-16, regards the evidence as clear and the\r\n     execution as just; so does Revilla, although his reasons are\r\n     not the best. _Solis_, _Conq. Mex._ (ed. 1843), 508.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-38] It is not improbable that suspicions as to\r\n     the thoughts and acts of the kings may have created a\r\n     prejudice against them, but the suspicions existed already\r\n     before they left Mexico, as proved by their being taken\r\n     not only as hostages for the loyalty of their subjects,\r\n     but as a precaution against their own possible disloyalty.\r\n     Quauhtemotzin was evidently not the most submissive of men,\r\n     for he had always been regarded as requiring a close watch,\r\n     and Cortés brought him chiefly because of his 'bullicioso'\r\n     character, as he expresses it. It may not be considered\r\n     unpardonable for the Indian auxiliaries to relieve their\r\n     feelings in mutinous expressions against the taskmasters and\r\n     despoilers who were taking them away from home to meet an\r\n     unknown fate, to endure toil, hunger, and danger. But such\r\n     sentiments could not be overlooked in the kings. They, as\r\n     captured leaders, existed only by sufferance, the condition\r\n     being good behavior. For them even to listen was to encourage,\r\n     and they were consequently guilty. Not that I blame them.\r\n     Nay, I would rather blame them for not being more prompt\r\n     and determined in the patriotic effort. But in resolving to\r\n     listen, and to act, no doubt, they accepted a risk with a\r\n     penalty well defined among all peoples. Cortés was not the\r\n     man to hesitate at almost any deed when private or public\r\n     interests demanded it; and it needed but little to rouse to\r\n     blind fury the slumbering suspicions of the soldiers regarding\r\n     Mexican loyalty. But here we have evidence—not groundless\r\n     even from a native point of view—to justify the Spaniards\r\n     in assuming that a conspiracy, or, at least, mutinous talk,\r\n     was wide-spread, and this among a horde tenfold superior\r\n     in number; a horde known ever to have cherished unfriendly\r\n     feelings, and now doubly embittered by suffering. Under\r\n     the circumstances even saints would not have disregarded\r\n     testimony however doubtful; and the Castilians were but human.\r\n     Self-preservation, ay, duty to king, and country, and God,\r\n     whose several interests they were defending, demanded the\r\n     prompt suppression of so ominous a danger. What were the best\r\n     measures? A long campaign in Mexico had impressed Cortés with\r\n     the belief that a people so trained to abject subservience\r\n     as the Aztecs, and so bloody in their worship, could be\r\n     controlled by severity alone, and that the lesson must fall\r\n     on the leaders. Situated as they were the soldiers could\r\n     not be expected to guard a large number of captives. Hence\r\n     no course remained, except capital punishment. According to\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 201, Cortés' distress of mind\r\n     at the sufferings of the expedition was so increased by this\r\n     deed that he became sleepless, and, in wandering around one\r\n     night in a temple forming the camp, he fell from a platform\r\n     a distance of ten feet, hurting his head severely.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-39] On a watercourse falling into Términos. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 419.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-40] 'Pueblos, ò Tierras de Venados.' _Villagutierre_,\r\n     _Hist.

Pinelo,\r\n     _Relacion_, 1, 2, has it Taiza or Atitza. Two leagues from\r\n     shore, says Cortés, on an island known as Peten Itza, Peten\r\n     signifying island. Its present name is Remedios, and on\r\n     the ruins of the old pueblo has risen the town of Flores.\r\n     The name of Peten lives in that of the province. A romantic\r\n     account is given of the rise of this lake people. The Itzas\r\n     were a branch of one of the most ancient nations of Yucatan,\r\n     whose name had descended on them as followers of the hero-god\r\n     Itzamná. Chichen Itza, their capital, was once a centre of\r\n     power and wealth in the peninsula, but with the changing\r\n     fortunes of war came disunion, and in the beginning of the\r\n     15th century the feared Itzas had dwindled into a number of\r\n     petty principalities ruled by caneks. 'El Cazique à quien\r\n     comunmente llaman Canek.' _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 54.\r\n     It so happened that one of these fell in love, but found an\r\n     obstacle in a father, who awarded the object of his affections\r\n     to a more powerful chief. The canek was not to be thus easily\r\n     balked. He watched his opportunity, and on the wedding-day\r\n     broke in upon the festive assembly and carried off the bride.\r\n     Gathering his warriors, the disappointed rival prepared to\r\n     wreak vengeance and recover the prize. The Ilium of our hero\r\n     was not fitted to withstand such hosts, and he had no other\r\n     alternative than flight. Nor could his subjects hope to\r\n     escape desolation, and taking up the cause of their leader,\r\n     they followed him southward in search of a new home, safe\r\n     from the avenger. Guided by craggy ranges, the refugees came\r\n     to the smiling valley of Tayasal, with its island-studded\r\n     lake, bordered by verdure-clad slopes, beyond which rose\r\n     the shielding forest. Here indeed was a land of promise,\r\n     where, guarded by Itzamná, they might rear new generations to\r\n     perpetuate the name and traditions of their race. So runs the\r\n     story as related by chroniclers, although with their devout\r\n     frame of mind they give preference to another account, which\r\n     attributes the migration to the prophecies of their priests,\r\n     foretelling the coming of a bearded race, with a new faith,\r\n     to rule over the land. _Villagutierre_, _Hist. Conq. Itza_,\r\n     29-31; _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 507. See also _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. v., etc. The Itzas will be again spoken of in a\r\n     later volume.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-45] 'Y que veria quemar los ídolos.' _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 30. Which was done, adds Gomara; but this\r\n     Villagutierre will not allow. Idolatry rather increased, he\r\n     goes on to show. _Hist. Conq. Itza_, 50. Here three Spaniards,\r\n     two Indians, and one negro deserted, tired of the constant\r\n     hardship. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 202.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-46] When the conquerors entered a century later to\r\n     occupy the district, they found more than a score of stone\r\n     temples on the island alone, and in one of the principal\r\n     ones this idol. _Villagutierre_, _Hist. Conq. Itza_, 100-2;\r\n     _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 55; _Native Races_, iii. 483.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-47] Nuestra Señora de Marco. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     viii. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-48] This was Medrano; 'Chirimia de la yglesia de\r\n     Toledo.' The victims are named. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     viii. cap. i. Cortés also admits that great hunger was\r\n     suffered, yet the swine were only sparingly used.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-49] 'Murieron sesenta y ocho caballos despeñados y\r\n     dejarretados,' etc. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 433. Bernal Diaz is\r\n     less clear on this incident. Gomara follows Cortés, although\r\n     he says that the passage took only eight days, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     263, and Herrera is the only one who enters into the losses\r\n     sustained in men, a number dying also of diarrhœa from\r\n     palm-cabbage. _Ubi sup._\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-50] Cortés describes even these crossings as quite\r\n     dangerous. The horses swam below the fall in the still water.\r\n     Three days were passed ere all the horses could crawl into\r\n     the camp, a league further. _Cartas_, 434.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-51] 'Á 15 días del año de 1525.' _Id._; that is, April\r\n     15.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-52] 'Habia diez dias que no comiamos sino cuescos\r\n     de palmas y palmitos.' 'Aun de aquellos palmitos sin sal no\r\n     teniamos abasto, porque se cortaban con mucha dificultad de\r\n     unas palmas muy gordas y altas, que en todo un dia dos hombres\r\n     tenian que hacer cortar uno, y cortado, le comian en media\r\n     hora.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 434, 439.\r\n\r\n     [XVIII-53] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 202, 204;\r\n     _Juarros_, _Guat._, 326. Most authors confound Nito and San\r\n     Gil, and Prescott actually does so with Naco.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-1] Sixty men and twenty women left by Gonzalez. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 440. Forty Spaniards and four women, says Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 204.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-2] 'De todos ellos no habia ocho para poder quedar en\r\n     la tierra.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, _loc. cit._ Their captain,\r\n     Armenta, having refused to return with them to Cuba, they had\r\n     hanged him a few days before, and had elected Nieto, who was\r\n     ready to execute their wishes. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     204.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-3] Montagua probably.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-4] Captain Marin found eight leagues off, on the\r\n     Naco road, a number of well-supplied villages, from which\r\n     provisions were forwarded. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     204.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-5] Bought on credit from the owner, Anton de Carmona\r\n     or Camargo, says Bernal Diaz, who reduces the stock to seven\r\n     horses and forty hogs.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-6] A party had already been sent in this direction, but\r\n     they returned within ten days disheartened, throwing discredit\r\n     on the informants, who on their side accused the men of being\r\n     faint-hearted. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 441-2.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-7] Eighty Spaniards had attacked a pueblo, but the\r\n     Indians returned in greater force and drove them off with some\r\n     wounded. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 444.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-8] It was sought to allure the natives back to aid in\r\n     carrying supplies, but none came. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 450.\r\n     Bernal Diaz relates that the warriors returned to the attack\r\n     after the flight, only to lose eight men. They now came to\r\n     sue, and Cortés offered to release the captives if they sent\r\n     down provisions to the vessel. This they did, but Cortés\r\n     nevertheless insisted on retaining three families, whereupon\r\n     the Indians attacked and wounded twelve Spaniards, including\r\n     the general. _Hist. Verdad._, 205. This writer was not with\r\n     the expedition, however, but at Naco, so that his account is\r\n     doubly doubtful.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-9] 'Quimistlan y Zula y Cholome, que el que menos destos\r\n     tiene por mas de dos mil casas.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 456.\r\n     Bernal Diaz also names some places. _Hist. Verdad._, 207.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-10] He had been buffeted off the coast for nine days,\r\n     while the land party arrived long before him, over a good\r\n     road.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-11] 'Murieron ochenta Españoles sin algunos Indios en\r\n     este viaje.' _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 269. Licenciado Lopez\r\n     escaped to spread the news of Cortés' being alive. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 208.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-12] Together with Moreno 'in chains.' 'Although I fear\r\n     that he acted by order of the oidores, and that no justice\r\n     will be given.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 465-6. He praised the\r\n     wealth of Honduras, and asked for soldiers. 'Y para dar\r\n     credito que auia oro, embiò muchas joyas, y pieças ... de lo\r\n     que truxo de Mexico,' says _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     208. But he is by no means to be relied on.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-13] Bernal Diaz assumes, contrary to Cortés' clear\r\n     statement, that Zuazo sent a vessel from Habana with the\r\n     letter, and that two days before her arrival at Trujillo\r\n     came two vessels laden with merchandise from the oidores\r\n     and merchants of Santo Domingo, who had learned of Cortés'\r\n     whereabouts through a letter from one of the survivors of\r\n     Ávalos' wrecked ship. _Hist. Verdad._, 208. Gomara states that\r\n     the vessel from the oidores, laden with thirty-two horses,\r\n     saddlery, and other useful material, was turned back from Cuba\r\n     by the survivors of Ávalos' expedition. She touched at Santo\r\n     Domingo on her way to Honduras. _Hist. Mex._, 270. Cortés\r\n     shows that the news of Ávalos' shipwreck did not reach him\r\n     till some time later. _Cartas_, 468-471.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-14] The staff did all they could to cheer him, and among\r\n     other efforts to dispel his gloom, Mañueco, the maestresala,\r\n     made a wager that he would ascend in full armor the steep hill\r\n     to the new gubernatorial building. Before he could reach the\r\n     top he fell dead. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 211.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-15] 'Dejé en aquella villa hasta treinta y cinco de\r\n     caballo y cincuenta peones.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 470.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-16] He places this just before the arrival of Zuazo's\r\n     letter, _Hist. Verdad._, 209, but Cortés now for the first\r\n     time complains of feeling very ill, from the tossing at sea.\r\n     _Cartas_, 471.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-17] 'Martin Dorantes su lacayo.' _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     271. On October 23, 1525, it seems from a letter of Cortés.\r\n     _Cartas_, 395. Bernal Diaz intimates that a fear of being\r\n     seized by his enemies had to do with Cortés' disinclination\r\n     to go in person. _Hist. Verdad._, 212.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-18] In concluding the reply to their expostulations,\r\n     Cortés had observed that he could find plenty of soldiers in\r\n     Spain and elsewhere to do his bidding. The men commissioned\r\n     Sandoval to plead their cause in person; to urge the leader to\r\n     depart, and to hint that they could find governors in Mexico\r\n     to right them. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 212.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-19] 'É dos leguas el uno del otro ... el de Papayeca\r\n     tiene diez y ocho pueblos subjectos, y el de Champagua\r\n     diez.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 465. The names are also given as\r\n     Chapaxina, Papaica, etc.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-20] The two colleagues had been usurping guardians. They\r\n     were to be taken to Mexico to be impressed with the extent\r\n     of Spanish power, and to learn submission from its natives.\r\n     Pizacura died before leaving Honduras. _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     473; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 272.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-21] 'Era temido, y acatado, y llamauanle en todas\r\n     aquellas Provincias: El Capitan Hue, Hue de Marina, q̃ quiere\r\n     dezir el Capitan viejo que trae a doña Marina.' _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 207.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-22] They asked for a Spaniard to settle on each island,\r\n     as a guardian, but this could not be granted. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 273. Bernal Diaz says that the vessel escaped, and that\r\n     she was commanded by Moreno.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-23] Huilancho, Huilacho, Huyetlato, etc.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-24] Cortés claims that the province had submitted to\r\n     him some time before, but he probably received the proffer\r\n     only now, though pleading a previous allegiance to excuse the\r\n     interference.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-25] To assist him against two officers who opposed\r\n     his attempt to become independent of Pedrarias. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 476. According to Herrera, Sandoval returned without\r\n     achieving anything, pleading that he had not enough men,\r\n     dec. iii. lib. viii. cap. vii. Bernal Diaz, who was present,\r\n     states, on the other hand, that Sandoval appeared against\r\n     Rojas with sixty men, but made friends with him. Just then\r\n     came letters from Cortés ordering him to join in returning\r\n     to Mexico, and he hastened back, Rojas departing at the same\r\n     time. _Hist. Verdad._, 208. Gomara, following Cortés, assumes\r\n     that Rojas obeyed a mere message from Trujillo to leave\r\n     Olancho. _Hist. Mex._, 272.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-26] Cereceda writes Gaona. _Carta_, in _Squier's MSS._,\r\n     xx. 61.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-27] 'Escribí al dicho Francisco Hernandez y á toda la\r\n     gente que con él estaba en general, y particularmente á\r\n     algunos de los capitanes de su compañía que yo conoscia,\r\n     reprendiéndolos la fealdad que en aquello hacian,' etc.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 474. Bernal Diaz states, on the other\r\n     hand, that he promised to do his best for him, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 211, and in this was probably a little truth, as\r\n     will be seen.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-28] 'Hernandez ... sent to invite the Marquis to come\r\n     and receive the province from him.' _Andagoya's Narrative_,\r\n     37; _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. viii. cap. vii. Cortés became\r\n     a marquis a few years later.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-29] 'Quise luego ir á Nicaragua, creyendo poner en ello\r\n     algun remedio.' _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 476.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-30] Bernal Diaz assumes that when Sandoval was setting\r\n     out for Mexico, shortly before this, as stated, he received\r\n     orders to pass through Nicaragua, 'para demandalla a su\r\n     Magestad en Gouernacion.' _Hist. Verdad._, 212.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-31] _Id._, 215. 'Para este efeto fletó un navio en la\r\n     Villa de Medellin.' _Oviedo_, iii. 523. He came in the vessel\r\n     which had carried the messenger. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 476.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-32] Lordship, a title which pertained only to the higher\r\n     nobility and to the highest offices, and which Cortés, even\r\n     as governor and captain-general, had not the slightest right\r\n     to assume.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-33] Seat of honor for princes and prelates and for the\r\n     ruling men in a province.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-34] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 273; _Herrera_, dec. iii.\r\n     lib. viii. cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-35] Messengers were sent to the pueblos en route ordering\r\n     them to put the road in order and prepare for his reception.\r\n     Some of the Mexican auxiliaries were also appointed for the\r\n     work, says Ixtlilxochitl, but their remaining prince stayed\r\n     with Cortés. _Horribles Crueldades_, 110.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-36] 'Recibió el cuerpo de Christo vna mañana porque\r\n     como estaua tan malo, temia morirse.' _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 215. Prescott ignores the friar, and assumes that\r\n     Sandoval persuaded him to leave. But this is only one of\r\n     the many errors into which he has fallen concerning this\r\n     expedition, _Mex._, iii. 302.\r\n\r\n     [XIX-37] The natives were to be punished for persevering in\r\n     idolatry; although Indians must not be enslaved, yet slaves\r\n     held lawfully by them might be purchased as such by the\r\n     colonists. The instructions contain a number of minor rules\r\n     for the good government of province and towns. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Escritos Sueltos_, 75-95. Saavedra did not perhaps relish\r\n     the idea of being left with a comparatively small force,\r\n     for Bernal Diaz complains that he purposely withheld for\r\n     some time the order permitting the Naco company to leave for\r\n     Mexico. _Hist. Verdad._, 215, 219.

The chroniclers sympathize\r\n     with any victim of the abhorred governor. 'Estaba muy bien\r\n     quisto comunmente,' says Oviedo, 'de todos los españoles ...\r\n     culpaban ... á Pedrarias de inconstante é acelerado é mal\r\n     juez.' iii. 165-6.

Salcedo, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col.

Carlos V._, i. 218.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-1] The bitter complaints of Cortés against his rebellious\r\n     lieutenant evoked from the king merely instructions for Olid\r\n     to maintain friendly relations with Cortés, and to report to\r\n     the crown regarding the progress of his conquest. 'El Rey ...\r\n     no hizo mas demostracion que escriuir á Christoual de Olid,\r\n     que con Cortes tuuiese toda buena correspondencia, y fuesse\r\n     dando cuenta a su Magestad, de lo que passaua en aquella\r\n     tierra, pareciendo que no era mal consejo, la diuision de tan\r\n     gran gouierno como tenia.' _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap.\r\n     xiii.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-2] His commission is dated November 20th. _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiv. 52.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-3] Cortés' complaints were numerous and bitter, as may\r\n     be imagined. In a letter of 1532, for instance, he represents\r\n     to the king the many valuable services rendered, and the\r\n     hardship and danger suffered. He had discovered the province\r\n     of Honduras at his own expense, amounting to over 30,000\r\n     castellanos, and the expedition to suppress the revolt of Olid\r\n     had cost him over 50,000 castellanos, a like amount being also\r\n     expended by his followers. He had conquered, pacified, and\r\n     settled over 200 leagues of territory, founding three towns\r\n     on the best parts of the coast; he had expended over 25,000\r\n     castellanos for horses, arms, and provisions, imported from\r\n     Española and Cuba, and before leaving the country had left\r\n     a competent captain in charge of the new colonies. _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 6-7.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-4] For this they were afterward censured. _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     iii. lib. x. cap. xi.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-5] The royal commission, with the ceremonies attending\r\n     its reception, is given in _Traslado de una Cédula_, in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiv. 47 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-6] Orders came for investigation and punishment,\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iv. lib. ii. cap. vi., but the distant Indies\r\n     possessed as yet too many loop-holes and corners for blind\r\n     justice.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-7] Oviedo, iii. 189, states that Diego Mendez de\r\n     Hinestrosa was left in charge at Trujillo, that Salcedo had\r\n     already marched out of Trujillo for Nicaragua when the envoys\r\n     of Pedrarias came up, and that he sent them at once to the\r\n     audiencia. But he is not well informed.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-8] Herrera would have us believe that starvation was over\r\n     the whole country, in all its ghastly horrors, making it a\r\n     question of life and death between Spaniard and Indian, who\r\n     devoured each other. dec. iv. lib. i. cap. vii. But this is\r\n     clearly exaggeration.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-9] According to Herrera, dec. iv. lib. iii. cap. ii.,\r\n     Gabriel de Rojas was offered the government, but declined to\r\n     hold the province except for the king direct; whereupon he was\r\n     arrested and Garabito given the command. He seems confused,\r\n     however, while Cereceda's account is most clear on all these\r\n     points. _Carta_, MS., 3-6. Oviedo is quite brief. iii. 190.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-10] The present treasurer, Rodrigo del Castillo, was\r\n     under indictment by the inquisition at Panamá. With Pedrarias\r\n     came a friar empowered to try his case, by whom he was\r\n     acquitted, and he thereupon resumed office till Tobilla\r\n     arrived. _Cerezeda_, _Carta_, MS., 10-11.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-11] Herrera's lucid definition of the limits reads:\r\n     'Desde Leon al puerto de Natiuidad, cien leguas Nortesur,\r\n     y desde Chorotega, por otro nombre Fõseca, hasta puerto de\r\n     Cauallos, Nortesur, que auia setenta leguas, y cien leguas\r\n     de costa por el mar del Norte, y otras tantas por el Sur con\r\n     mas lo q̃ se le renunciaua, y lo que para adelante pudisse\r\n     ensancharse descubriendo,' including Nequepia province, or\r\n     Salvador, dec. iv. lib. iii. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-12] Besides the usual humane injunctions it was ordered\r\n     that towns should be founded near the Indians, so that they\r\n     might be brought by example and gentle means to a knowledge of\r\n     the true faith, and be led to adopt the manners and customs of\r\n     Christians. To promote this desirable end the royal officers\r\n     were enjoined to watch strictly over the moral and economic\r\n     features of the Spanish settlements. The revolted Chorotegas\r\n     were to be pacified by kindness, and the native slaves brought\r\n     from Panamá were to be returned. _Herrera_, dec. iv. lib. i.\r\n     cap. viii. See chap, v., note 5, this volume.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-13] 'Lleuando los Indios cargados, y encadenados, cõ\r\n     argollas, porq̃ no se boluiessen: y porq̃ vno se canso, por\r\n     no quitarle el argolla le quitaron la cabeça, y lo dissimulo.'\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iv. lib. iii. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-14] Ponce de Leon and Hernando de Soto, for instance,\r\n     took two cargoes at one time, according to Pizarro,\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, v. 209.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-15] 'Ellos matarõ a los Castellanos q̃ acertaron a hallar\r\n     fuera del lugar, y los comieron.' _Herrera_, dec. iv. lib.\r\n     iii. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-16] 'Los quales eran del valle de Olocoton é de su\r\n     comarca.' _Oviedo_, iv. 100.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-17] Despite his want of success, says Oviedo, iv. 61,\r\n     Estete received from Pedrarias another important command,\r\n     to the prejudice of another officer. The details of the\r\n     expedition will be given in connection with Salvador.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-18] Soto alone brought about 100 men to Peru. _Pizarro_,\r\n     _Rel._, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, v. 211-15; _Herrera_, dec. iv.\r\n     lib. vi. cap. iii.; _Oviedo_, iii. 119-20. This conquest will\r\n     be spoken of in a later volume of this history.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-19] In 1527, as has been intimated, there was an outcry\r\n     for his removal, but with the aid of influential friends\r\n     he managed to retain his seat. Castillo states that one\r\n     expedition alone, under Córdoba, had brought over 100,000\r\n     pesos de oro into Leon, none of which reached the crown. After\r\n     beheading Córdoba he had conjured up a partner for him, named\r\n     Tellez, into whose hands was placed the confiscated estate, so\r\n     that it might with better pretence be appropriated. _Carta_,\r\n     in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 84-6.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-20] 'En fin de Iulio.' _Herrera_, dec. iv. lib. ix. cap.\r\n     xv.\r\n\r\n     [XXI-21] Oviedo, iii. 172, attributes to Pedrarias the release\r\n     of two millions of souls from dusky bodies during a period of\r\n     sixteen years. 'Ni han tenido más largas jornadas que caminar\r\n     dos millones de indios que desde el año de mill é quinientos\r\n     y catorçe que llegó Pedrarias á la Tierra-Firme hasta quél\r\n     murió.' Two million murders!\r\n\r\n     [XXI-22] Additional authorities for the preceding two\r\n     chapters are: Various documents in _Col. Doc.

But this state of things\r\n     did not last long. Ixtlilxochitl includes Soconusco in a\r\n     list of provinces which were in revolt in 1523. _Horribles\r\n     Crueldades_, 65.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-4] According to Fuentes y Guzman, derived from\r\n     _Coctecmalan_—that is to say, _Palo de leche_, milk-tree,\r\n     commonly called _Yerba mala_, found in the neighborhood of\r\n     Antigua Guatemala. See also _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 257-8.\r\n     In the Mexican tongue, if we may believe Vazquez, it was\r\n     called _Quauhtimali_, 'rotten tree.' _Chronica de Guat._,\r\n     68. Others derive it from _Uhatezmalha_, signifying 'the\r\n     hill which discharges water;' and Juarros suggests that it\r\n     may be from _Juitemal_, the first king of Guatemala, by a\r\n     corruption, as _Almolonga_ from _Atmulunga_, and _Zonzonate_\r\n     from _Zezontlatl_. The meaning of the word would then be 'the\r\n     kingdom of Guatemala.' _Guat._, i. 4; ii. 259-60.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-5] See _Native Races_, v., passim.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-6] There were two royal families among the Cakchiquels.\r\n     The succession alternated between them. The king's title\r\n     was Ahpozotzil, while that of the heir of the other branch\r\n     was Ahpoxahil. The eldest sons of these had respectively the\r\n     titles of Ahpop Qamahay and Galel Xahil. _Native Races_, ii.\r\n     640.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-7] This Mexican name of Cortés was already known to the\r\n     natives from sea to sea, and from the far north to the far\r\n     south; in fact, to them it was almost his only name.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-8] Gomara surmises that the ships of Andrés Niño were\r\n     referred to, _Hist. Ind._, 266, while Peter Martyr believes\r\n     them to have been those of Gil Gonzalez, seen off the coast\r\n     of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-9] 'El qual pregunto, si eran de Malinxe, ... Dios caydo\r\n     del cielo.' _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._, 266.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-10] A carver in wood, and no ordinary pilot, Peter\r\n     Martyr says, dec. viii. cap. v., while Gomara's words are,\r\n     'Treuiño, y era carpintero de naos.' _Hist. Ind._, 266.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-11] One of the messengers sought to appropriate\r\n     to himself a quantity of the gold, while his comrade,\r\n     disapproving, first admonished him, then held his peace,\r\n     dissembling, and accused him to Cortés of theft. The culprit\r\n     was convicted, publicly flogged, and banished from New Spain.\r\n     _Peter Martyr_, dec. viii. cap. v. 'Esta fue la primera\r\n     entrada, y noticia de Quauhtemallan.' _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     267.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-12] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 289; _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     267; _Vazquez_, _Chronica de Gvat._, 4; _Remesal_, _Hist.\r\n     Chyapa_, 2-3. Gomara erroneously gives 1523 as the year of\r\n     this embassy, as well as Alvarado's expedition to Tututepec.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-13] Or Tuzapan, on the coast of Vera Cruz, some leagues\r\n     south of Tampico.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-14] Gomara says 200 men, to ratify the treaty of peace\r\n     with a reasonable present. _Hist. Ind._, 266-67. Remesal\r\n     states that the embassadors from Guatemala found Cortés\r\n     at the port of Villa Rica [Vera Cruz] in high good humor,\r\n     having received the news of his appointment as governor and\r\n     captain-general of New Spain. _Hist. Chyapa_, 3.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-15] Vazquez makes no mention of embassadors from the\r\n     lord of Utatlan; on the contrary, he states that the king\r\n     of the Cakchiquel nation had invested with independent\r\n     sovereignty over a portion of his kingdom his brother\r\n     Ahpoxahil, who held his court at Tecpanatitan [Tzolola]; and\r\n     that these two rulers, without informing the neighboring lords\r\n     of their intention, conjointly sent embassadors to Cortés\r\n     with offers of peace and submission. _Chronica de Gvat._, 68.\r\n     Brasseur de Bourbourg takes this view, and states that when\r\n     the secret alliance became known the indignation was general.\r\n     A confederation for the destruction of the Cakchiquels was\r\n     formed, and a struggle of fearful bloodiness had been carried\r\n     on for some months when the confederates received the news\r\n     that the Tonatiuh was advancing through Soconusco against\r\n     them. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 630.\r\n     But Cortés distinctly states that he both sent messengers to\r\n     Utatlan and received envoys from that city. _Cartas_, 289. See\r\n     also _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. viii.; _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 174.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-16] Gomara states that at the time of their overtures\r\n     to Cortés the Guatemalans were at war with Soconusco, and\r\n     now, encouraged by their alliance, pressed hostilities with\r\n     increased vigor. _Hist. Ind._, 267. Ixtlilxochitl claims that\r\n     in 1523 the Mexican princes Ixtlilxochitl and Quauhtemoctzin\r\n     learned that the provinces of the south coast, among which he\r\n     includes Soconusco, had risen against those who were friendly\r\n     to the Christians, and they straightway informed Cortés.\r\n     _Horribles Crueldades_, 65-6.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-17] 'Y porque ya yo tenia mucha costa hecha ... y porque\r\n     dello tengo creido que Dios nuestro Señor y V. S. M. han de ser\r\n     muy servidos.' _Cartas_, 304.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-18] For more concerning his character see _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     i. 73-5, this series.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-19] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 304. With regard to both date\r\n     and number authorities differ. Bernal Diaz assigns December\r\n     13th as the day of departure; Ixtlilxochitl, December 8th.\r\n     _Horribles Crueldades_, 71; Fuentes, November 19th, and\r\n     Vazquez, November 13th. Vazquez states that this last is\r\n     the date given in the original manuscript of Bernal Diaz,\r\n     though the printed copy gives December 13th. _Chronica de\r\n     Gvat._, 523. The number of forces at the second mustering\r\n     is stated by Cortés to have been 120 horsemen, with 40\r\n     spare animals, and 300 foot-soldiers, of whom 130 were\r\n     cross-bowmen and arquebusiers. There were also several\r\n     persons of high rank from Mexico and the neighboring cities\r\n     with the native troops; but the latter were not numerous,\r\n     on account of the distance of the proposed scene of action.\r\n     A park of four pieces of artillery completed the equipment.\r\n     Oviedo follows Cortés. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 174,\r\n     gives the number of arquebusiers and cross-bowmen as 120,\r\n     and that of the horsemen 135, with above 200 Tlascaltecs\r\n     and Cholultecs, besides 100 picked Mexicans. Herrera, dec.\r\n     iii. lib. v. cap. viii., assigns 300 Spaniards, 100 of whom\r\n     were arquebusiers, with 160 horses. Vazquez, _Chronica de\r\n     Gvat._, 4, says the force consisted of 300 Spaniards with\r\n     Tlascaltec, Mexican, and Cholultec allies. Without making\r\n     any mention of the guns, which the above authorities do not\r\n     omit, Fuentes says the force was composed of 750 hombres\r\n     de calidad, as follows: 300 foot-soldiers, arquebusiers,\r\n     and cross-bowmen, 135 horsemen, and four guns under the\r\n     artilleryman Usagre, written in Bernal Diaz as Viagre; but\r\n     750 must be an error, since the artillerymen would thus\r\n     number 315; 450 is probably the intended number. To these\r\n     were added 200 Tlascaltec and Cholultec bowmen, and 100\r\n     picked Mexicans. This author, moreover, gives a list of the\r\n     names of nearly 200 conquistadores. _Recordacion Florida_,\r\n     MS., 25-7. Gomara has 420 Spaniards, with 170 horses, four\r\n     pieces of artillery, a great quantity of stores, and a large\r\n     number of Mexican troops. 'Mucha gente Mexicana.' _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 267. Brasseur de Bourbourg gives the forces as 300\r\n     foot-soldiers, 120 of whom were arquebusiers or cross-bowmen,\r\n     135 horsemen, with four pieces of artillery, 200 warriors of\r\n     Tlascala and Cholula, 10,000 each of Mexico and Acolhuacan,\r\n     besides a large number of porters and carriers. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, 632. This last author is supported by Ixtlilxochitl,\r\n     who states that Ixtlilxochitl and Quauhtemoctzin supplied\r\n     Cortés each with 10,000 warriors, under the command of able\r\n     captains. _Horribles Crueldades_, 65-6. And with regard to the\r\n     native contingent troops, we have additional evidence that\r\n     they were far more numerous than Cortés chose to represent\r\n     them to the Spanish monarch. The Xochimilco Indians, whose\r\n     city lay five leagues from Mexico, sent in a petition for\r\n     redress of grievances, dated 2d May, 1563, in which they\r\n     claim to have furnished Alvarado, their encomendero, with\r\n     2500 warriors for the conquest of Honduras and Guatemala.\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, viii. 293-4. By royal\r\n     edict the employment of natives beyond their own borders\r\n     had been forbidden; hence, to diminish the magnitude of the\r\n     disobedience, the number was diminished.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-20] The former were Franciscans, named Juan de Torres\r\n     and Francisco Martinez de Pontaza, according to Vazquez,\r\n     _Chronica de Gvat._, 524. This writer enters into a long\r\n     argument to prove that Bartolomé de Olmedo, of the order\r\n     of Nuestra Señora de la Merced, could not have accompanied\r\n     the expedition, as stated by Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     174. Vazquez, with the aid of two other friars, compared\r\n     the original manuscript of Bernal Diaz with the printed work\r\n     published in 1632, and found the last mention of Olmedo in the\r\n     manuscript to be in chapter clvii. He had a suspicion that the\r\n     passages in later chapters where Olmedo's connection with the\r\n     expedition is mentioned may be interpolations by the Friar\r\n     Alonso Remon, who was of the same order as Olmedo, and who\r\n     first published the _Historia Verdadera_. The two clergymen\r\n     were Juan Godinez, _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 4, and Juan\r\n     Diaz, _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 128.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-21] _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 3. This authority\r\n     also states that Cortés conferred on Alvarado the title of\r\n     lieutenant-governor and captain-general. Cortés, in his letter\r\n     to the king, expresses great confidence in the expedition,\r\n     and regrets that inopportune circumstances in connection with\r\n     the fleets had retarded the discovery of many secrets, and\r\n     the collection of gold and pearls for the royal treasury.\r\n     _Cartas_, 305.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-22] In some rocky fastnesses, _peñoles_, called the\r\n     Peñoles de Guelamo, being in the encomienda of a soldier of\r\n     that name. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 174; _Fuentes_,\r\n     _Conq. Guat._, MS., 1.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-23] Larrainzar finds no difficulty in looking beyond the\r\n     myths to a time when this people was included in the Chiapanec\r\n     nation. _Hist. Soconusco_, 7.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-24] Bernal Diaz assumes that the province contained\r\n     only 15,000 families, estimated by Fuentes to represent a\r\n     population of 60,000 inhabitants. _Hist. Verdad._, 174.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-25] _Pelaez_, _Mem. Guat._, i. 45; _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 229; _Vazquez_, _Chronica de Gvat._, 4; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     iii. lib. v. cap. viii. Bernal Diaz, followed by Fuentes,\r\n     states that in Soconusco Alvarado was peaceably received,\r\n     and that the natives presented offerings of gold. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 174. This idea may have arisen from the fact that\r\n     some towns did submit without active opposition, as recorded\r\n     or implied by Gomara and Herrera. Remesal says that Alvarado\r\n     passed on like a thunderbolt, conquering by force of arms and\r\n     exciting great terror by reason of the carnage at Soconusco.\r\n     That the destruction was great is evident from the ruins to be\r\n     seen at the entrance into Guatemala, in the locality called\r\n     the Sacrificadero. _Hist. Chyapa_, 3. Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n     affirms that Alvarado, as he passed through this district,\r\n     founded a Spanish colony at Huehuetan, which was long the\r\n     capital of the territory after the destruction of the city\r\n     of Soconusco. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 633-4. This could have\r\n     been only a concentration of the already resident Spaniards,\r\n     for Alvarado would scarcely have left behind him, at this\r\n     juncture, many of his own men.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-26] Fuentes and Guzman, MS., 2, give the later name of\r\n     Zapotitlan as Suchitepeque, which signifies Hill of Flowers.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-27] Place of zapotes, a plum-like fruit abounding in\r\n     the neighborhood. _Niebla_, _Mem. Zapotitlan_, MS., 7-8.\r\n     Its ancient name was Xetulul. It is now abandoned, and the\r\n     inhabitants are dispersed among the neighboring villages.\r\n     _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 635.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-28] The Zamalá, bearing at its source the name Seguilá,\r\n     and lower that of Olintepec. Near the village of this latter\r\n     name it is joined by the Tziha, from which junction down to\r\n     the sea it is called the Zamalá. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_,\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 635.\r\n\r\n     [XXII-29] The loss to the natives was of course severe. Of\r\n     the Spaniards two only were killed, but many were wounded.\r\n     The allies were greater sufferers, and a number of the horses\r\n     were badly injured.

Fuentes estimated that this\r\n     city contained 300,000 inhabitants. So strongly was it\r\n     fortified that it had never been taken, though attempts had\r\n     often been made. _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 240.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-3] The most powerful of the Quiché monarchs, said\r\n     to have reigned about the time of Julius Cæsar. For list of\r\n     Quiché kings see _Native Races_, v. 566.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-4] Juarros states that Tecum Umam set out with 72,000\r\n     fighting men. At Chemequena, now Totonicapan, the number\r\n     was increased to 90,000 by the forces of eight fortified\r\n     places and eighteen towns; on the plains of Xelahuh ten\r\n     lords joined him with 24,000 men, and 46,000 arrived from\r\n     other quarters, so that in all his army amounted to 232,000\r\n     warriors. _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 248. Vazquez affirms that\r\n     these forces came from more than 100 populous towns, which\r\n     owed allegiance to the Quiché monarch, and that no aid was\r\n     given by the Cakchiquels or Zutugils. _Chronica de Gvat._, 5.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-5] Vazquez describes both the natural difficulties and\r\n     the artificial defences of this pass as offering the greatest\r\n     obstacles to the invaders. The gorge had been protected by\r\n     palisades and ditches, and only by the most indefatigable\r\n     exertions, now destroying trenches and stone barricades,\r\n     now climbing rugged steeps by help of feet and hands, were\r\n     the Spaniards able to reach the plain above. Moreover, the\r\n     devil was at hand to help his own, and he wrought against\r\n     the good Spaniards by means of diabolical transformations in\r\n     lightning and whirlwinds, and otherwise convulsed elements;\r\n     and by fearful apparitions and transformations into wild\r\n     beasts. _Chronica de Gvat._, 5. This, from Fray Francisco's\r\n     description, will enable the reader to form some opinion\r\n     of the religio-historical narration representing this\r\n     achievement.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-6] Bernal Diaz states that the Spaniards had three men\r\n     and two horses wounded in this struggle. Fuentes says six men\r\n     and two horses were wounded. _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion\r\n     Florida_, MS., 3.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-7] _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, in _Barcia_, i. 158;\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 476; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.

This last author states\r\n     that from the river Zamalá to the Olintepec six battles were\r\n     fought, but that this was the most strongly contested and\r\n     the most bloody. Compare _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, in _Barcia_,\r\n     158; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 174; _Fuentes y Guzman_,\r\n     _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 3-4; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 229.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-10] 'Murió vn señor de quatro que son en Vtatlan.'\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 229. Besides Prince Ahzumanche, two\r\n     principal lords of Utatlan were slain in the battles of the\r\n     pass—the one Ahzol, a great captain, and a relative of the\r\n     king, and the other Ahpocoh, his shield-bearer, whose office\r\n     in the army was of the highest. _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 250;\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 174. The words Ahzol and\r\n     Ahpocoh are not, however, patronymics, but titles.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-11] The district is called El Pinar by Juarros,\r\n     _Guat._, ii. 248; and El Pinal by Vazquez, _Chronica de\r\n     Gvat._, 524.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-12] 'Corriendo la Tierra, que es tan gran Poblacion\r\n     como Tascalteque, i en las Labranças, ni mas, ni menos, i\r\n     friisima en demasia.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, in _Barcia_, i.\r\n     158.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-13] Vazquez visited this hermitage at Zacaha in 1690,\r\n     and there saw a picture of the virgin, which had been brought\r\n     by the conquerors, and was known as La Conquistadora, for\r\n     a description of which the reader can consult _Chronica de\r\n     Gvat._, 9. In his time the shrine was a place greatly revered.\r\n     It was a current belief that some member of the priestly\r\n     order, the object of devotion, was interred there, a strong\r\n     supposition prevailing that the remains were those of the\r\n     first bishop of Guatemala; but this is wrong, for Bishop\r\n     Marroquin died in the Episcopal palace at Guatemala. The\r\n     remains were probably those of the priest Pontaza. _Chronica\r\n     de Gvat._, 8-10, 526.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-14] The descendants of this conquistador were still\r\n     living in the same locality in the time of Vazquez, who\r\n     describes them as raisers of small stock, as poverty-stricken\r\n     as the descendants of the conquered natives. _Id._, 8-9.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-15] Four years later the town was removed to the\r\n     present site. _Id._, 7-8; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 241.\r\n     The meaning of the term Quezaltenango is the 'place of the\r\n     quetzal,' the American bird of paradise, called 'trogon'\r\n     by the naturalists. The name was of Mexican origin, and was\r\n     probably applied not only to the district but to the city of\r\n     Xelahuh.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-16] During a stay of two to three days. _Fuentes y\r\n     Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-17] Four years later the inhabitants were removed to\r\n     the new town of Quezaltenango, which the Indian population\r\n     still call Xelahuh.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-18] On the authority of a manuscript of sixteen leaves\r\n     found at San Andrés Xecul, a town not far from Quezaltenango,\r\n     Juarros states that on the second day four caciques humbly\r\n     surrendered themselves, and owing to their influence the\r\n     inhabitants peaceably returned and tendered allegiance.\r\n     _Guat._, ii. 240-1. No mention of such an event is made by\r\n     Alvarado, Bernal Diaz, or Herrera; and Vazquez distinctly\r\n     states that these four chiefs were won over, with some\r\n     difficulty, after the final battle and the death of Tecum.\r\n     Though Brasseur de Bourbourg follows Juarros, I incline to\r\n     the opinion that the pacification of Xelahuh was subsequent\r\n     to the battle which is yet to follow.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-19] Twelve thousand of whom were from the city of\r\n     Utatlan. _Relacion_, i. 158. Juarros says the first contingent\r\n     contained 16,000 men. _Guat._, ii. 251. Bernal Diaz gives\r\n     the whole number as more than 16,000. _Hist. Verdad._, 174.\r\n     Herrera uses the indefinite but safe expression 'vn gran\r\n     exercito de Quazaltenalco.' dec. iii. lib. v. cap. ix.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-20] The numbers are differently given. Alvarado says\r\n     there were 90 horsemen; Juarros, 135 horse; Herrera, that the\r\n     whole force consisted of 80 horse, 200 infantry, and a strong\r\n     body of Mexicans. Bernal Diaz uses the general expression,\r\n     'with his army.'\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-21] Such is the legend long retained among the Quichés.\r\n     _Guatemala_, _Chronica de la Prov._, i. 13; _Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 641.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-22] 'I nuestros Amigos, i los Peones hacian vna\r\n     destruccion, la maior del Mundo, en vn Arroio.' _Alvarado_,\r\n     _Relacion_, i. 158.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-23] Vazquez asserts that this engagement took place\r\n     on the 14th of May, 1524, while the despatch by Alvarado\r\n     reporting the event to Cortés is dated more than a month\r\n     earlier, April 11th.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-24] It is difficult to arrive at any approximation\r\n     to the number of slain during the series of engagements on\r\n     the Pinar. Vazquez is the only authority who ventures to put\r\n     down figures. 'Viniendo sobre el Exercito Christiano ... de\r\n     trece mil, en trece mil, cada dia, aquellos.... Barbaros tan\r\n     imperterritos â la muerte, y al estrago que las Catholicas\r\n     armas hacian en su numeroso Exercito, quedando muertos mas\r\n     de diez, y doze mil infieles, encendiendo en los que quedauan\r\n     viuos ... que acoradas con la vertida sangre de sus compañeros\r\n     avivaban mas su rabia, para embestir con irracional despecho\r\n     â las Españoles.' _Chronica de Gvat._, 5. See also _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 159.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-25] The names of these caciques, given by Juarros,\r\n     were Calel Ralak, Ahpopqueham, Calelahau, and Calelaboy, as\r\n     supplied by the manuscript previously mentioned in note 17,\r\n     this chapter.\r\n\r\n     [XXIII-26] So they called the Spaniards, as the soldiers\r\n     of Alvarado, generally known by the name of Tonatiuh, the\r\n     initial 'T' being changed by the Quichés into 'D.' _Vazquez_,\r\n     _Chronica de Gvat._, 524.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-1] Also called Gumarcaah. It is represented to-day by\r\n     the town of Santa Cruz del Quiché, which is situated so near\r\n     the ruins of the ancient city that it might be considered an\r\n     outlying suburb. About the middle of the sixteenth century\r\n     Utatlan was entirely abandoned and the inhabitants removed\r\n     to Santa Cruz. _Juarros_, _Guat._, i. 66; _Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 647.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-2] _Juarros_, _Guat._, i. 66-7; _Alvarado_, _Relacion_,\r\n     i. 159; _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 32. See also\r\n     _Native Races_, ii. 744, 788-9. Atalaya and Resguardo are\r\n     Spanish terms, the first signifying 'Watch-tower' and the\r\n     other 'Guard.'\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-3] _Torquemada_, i. 311. The frontage of the palace was\r\n     376 paces, while its depth reached 728 paces. The chronicler\r\n     Fuentes visited Santa Cruz del Quiché for the purpose\r\n     of investigating the ruins, from which, as well as from\r\n     manuscripts, he gathered much information.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-4] Juarros calls him Chignauivcelut.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-5] Francisco Flores claims that he and Juan de Oriza\r\n     made the discovery. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 32,\r\n     34.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-6] Bernal Diaz states that some Indians of Quezaltenango\r\n     warned Alvarado that they intended to kill them all that\r\n     night if they remained there, and that they had posted in the\r\n     ravines many bands of warriors, who, when they saw the houses\r\n     in flames, were to unite with those of Utatlan and fall on\r\n     the invaders at different points.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-7] It is possible that Oxib Quieh was hanged, and not\r\n     burned, though Alvarado makes no mention of such weakness on\r\n     his part, but states distinctly 'Yo los quemé.' _Relacion_,\r\n     i. 159. Bernal Diaz, however, asserts that through the\r\n     intercession of Fray Bartolomé Olmedo a respite of two days\r\n     was granted the unfortunate king, during which time he was\r\n     converted and baptized, and that his sentence was commuted to\r\n     hanging. _Hist. Verdad._, 175. This view is taken by Salazar\r\n     y Olarte, _Conq. Mex._, 125-6, and Juarros, _Guat._, ii. 253,\r\n     but not by Ixtlilxochitl, _Horribles Crueldades_, 67. At the\r\n     trial of Alvarado this act of barbarity constitutes one of the\r\n     charges, and the testimony tends to prove that no exception\r\n     was made in favor of any one of the victims. The witness\r\n     Francisco Flores, mentioned in note 5, this chapter, states\r\n     that one of the nobles was spared, because he had disclosed\r\n     the plot. His testimony may, however, be founded on a respite\r\n     granted to Oxib Quieh, incorrectly understood by Flores.\r\n     _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 32. Alvarado informed\r\n     Cortés that the victims made full confession of the plot\r\n     before they were put to death, and his use of the expression\r\n     'Como parecera por sus confesiones' would seem to indicate\r\n     that the confessions were taken down in writing and forwarded\r\n     to Cortés. _Relacion_, i. 159. In conclusion, Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg says that only the monarch and the heir presumptive\r\n     were burned, which is at variance with Juarros' expression,\r\n     'Ni las muertes de sus primeros capitanes, ni las de sus dos\r\n     Reyes, executadas por los Castellanos,' _Guat._, ii. 253, and\r\n     also with the testimony of Flores, who says, 'E los prendio a\r\n     todos ... e despues los quemo.' _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra\r\n     Alvarado_, 32. Las Casas affirms they were burned alive\r\n     without any form of trial. _Regio. Ind. Devastat._, 35.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-8] _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 253. Alvarado never alludes\r\n     to his artillery in this or any future campaign of the year,\r\n     though he repeatedly speaks of the arquebusiers. Juarros, so\r\n     far as I can discover, is the only author except Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg who mentions artillery.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-9] 'I es la Tierra tan fuerte de quebradas, que ai\r\n     quebradas que entran docientos estados de hondo, i por\r\n     estas quebradas no pudimos hacerles la Guerra.' _Alvarado_,\r\n     _Relacion_, i. 159.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-10] His object in making this demand was twofold: he\r\n     wished to test the Cakchiquel king's feelings toward him, and\r\n     at the same time to increase his native forces, who would be\r\n     useful in this work. _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 159. According\r\n     to Brasseur de Bourbourg the princes of the Cakchiquel nation\r\n     met with much opposition from their subjects in supporting\r\n     the Spaniards, and the nobles refused to supply the troops\r\n     demanded by Alvarado. In this embarrassment the Ahpozotzil\r\n     raised 4000 warriors in his capital. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, 648.\r\n     Bernal Diaz, followed by Juarros, gives a different account\r\n     from that of Alvarado, which is followed in the text. It is to\r\n     the effect that the people of Guatemala, hearing of Alvarado's\r\n     repeated victories, and learning that he was stationed at\r\n     Utatlan, sent an embassy with presents of gold, offering\r\n     their services against the Quichés, with whom they were at\r\n     enmity. These were accepted by Alvarado, who, to test their\r\n     sincerity, and also because he was ignorant of the road, asked\r\n     and received assistance across the many gullies and through\r\n     the difficult passes. _Hist. Verdad._, 175.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-11] 'Mandè quemar la Ciudad, i poner por los cimientos.'\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 159.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-12] Derived from _cé_, 'one,' and '_quechutl_,' a\r\n     bird similar to the flamingo, for a description of which\r\n     see _Native Races_, iii. 374. His native name was Tepepul,\r\n     _Id._, v. 566, but I have preferred to use his Mexican name\r\n     in order to avoid confusion, as another Tepepul, king of the\r\n     Zutugils, will appear later in the narrative. The date of\r\n     this submission of the Quichés must have been a day or two\r\n     before the 11th of April, on which day Alvarado wrote his\r\n     despatch to Cortés, stating that he would leave for the city\r\n     of Guatemala on the same day, which was a Monday. Juarros\r\n     states that Alvarado remained eight days, Bernal Diaz seven\r\n     or eight, in Utatlan, occupied in the pacification of the\r\n     surrounding tribes. _Guat._, ii. 254. Herrera states that\r\n     the war terminated on the 25th of April, which can only be\r\n     explained by supposing that Alvarado did not leave Utatlan on\r\n     the 11th, as he intended. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-13] 'Estamos metidos en la mas recia Tierra de Gente\r\n     que se ha visto.' _Relacion_, i. 160.\r\n\r\n     [XXIV-14] _Relacion_, i. 159; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     175.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-1] Alvarado's line of march on this occasion seems to\r\n     have been confounded by different authors with routes followed\r\n     by him at later dates. Juarros says that he did not pass\r\n     through the towns of the coast, but along the Itzapa road; for\r\n     in a land title possessed by the Indians of Parramos, extended\r\n     in the year 1577, on the 10th of November, in a reference to\r\n     a plain on said road, this expression occurs: 'Where they say\r\n     the camp of the Spaniards was pitched when the Adelantado\r\n     D. Pedro de Alvarado came to conquer this land.' _Guat._,\r\n     ii. 255. By these remarks Juarros supports Fuentes' opinion\r\n     that the capital of the Cakchiquel nation was situated on the\r\n     slopes of the Volcan de Agua. I am, however, persuaded that\r\n     the encampment mentioned in the land title took place later,\r\n     on the occasion of Alvarado's campaign southward.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-2] Vazquez calls this ruler King Ahpotzotzil, _Chronica\r\n     de Gvat._, 68, which was only his title. His proper name was\r\n     Sinacam, by which he was called in the books of the cabildos\r\n     of Guatemala. _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 256. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg gives his name as Belehé Qat.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-3] _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 254-5. The account given\r\n     by the Cakchiquel manuscript of this conversation differs\r\n     somewhat from the above, stating that it took place in the\r\n     palace; that the martial aspect of the population, and the\r\n     number of warriors, excited the suspicions of Alvarado;\r\n     and that on the night after his arrival, agitated by his\r\n     apprehensions, he suddenly entered the royal apartments,\r\n     followed by his officers. His unexpected presence caused\r\n     great confusion, and the nobles in waiting rallied round their\r\n     sovereign. The conversation then followed, when Sinacam spoke\r\n     thus: 'Would I have sent my warriors and braves to die for\r\n     you and find a tomb at Gumarcaah if I had such treacherous\r\n     intentions?' In his explanation, also, the king states that\r\n     the armed troops were intended to be directed against the\r\n     provinces of Itzcuintlan and Atitlan, with which nations the\r\n     Cakchiquels were at war. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, 650-1.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-4] Bernal Diaz, or his editor, here introduces Friar\r\n     Bartolomé de Olmedo. His story is this: When the Spaniards\r\n     arrived at Guatemala, Alvarado told the friar that he had\r\n     never been so hard pressed as when fighting with the Indians\r\n     of Utatlan, describing them as most brave and excellent\r\n     warriors, and at the same time claimed to himself the merit\r\n     of having done a good work. The friar chided him, and said it\r\n     was God who had wrought the deed; and in order that he might\r\n     regard it as good, and aid them in future, it would be well\r\n     to give thanks to him, appoint a holiday, celebrate mass, and\r\n     preach to the Indians. This injunction was carried out, and\r\n     resulted in the baptism of more than 30 natives in two days.\r\n     Others also were anxious to be baptized when they perceived\r\n     that the Spaniards held intercourse more freely with the\r\n     converts than with others. _Hist. Verdad._, 175.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-5] Patinamit, or Iximché, called by Alvarado the city\r\n     of Guatemala. Juarros is in doubt as to the site of the\r\n     ancient Cakchiquel capital. Remesal makes no mention of it,\r\n     though he speaks of the founding of the Villa de Guatemala.\r\n     Fuentes argues that it was not Patinamit, but a city on the\r\n     slope of the Volcan de Agua, occupying the same position that\r\n     San Miguel Tzacualpa occupied when he wrote. His reasons\r\n     are, first, the preservation of the Indian name Guatemala,\r\n     indicating that the Spaniards did not found a new town, but\r\n     occupied the existing city; the custom of the Spaniards being\r\n     to give Spanish names to cities founded by them, as Trujillo,\r\n     Granada, Cartago, and others, while those cities which were\r\n     already founded retained their native names, as Mexico, Cuzco,\r\n     Tlascala, and the like. Again, as observed elsewhere, the word\r\n     Guatemala is derived from _Coctecmalan_, which means _Palo\r\n     de leche_, milk-tree, commonly called _Yerba mala_. This is\r\n     found only at Antigua Guatemala, and within a league around,\r\n     in which space, therefore, the capital must have stood. But\r\n     it was not situated where Antigua Guatemala stands, because\r\n     that place was always called _Panchoy_, or Great Lagoon;\r\n     nor where the Pueblo of Ciudad Vieja stands, which locality\r\n     was called _Atmulunca_, meaning Gushing Water. Therefore\r\n     it must have been on the spot where stood the city of the\r\n     Spaniards, which was destroyed in 1541, and where now exists\r\n     the little village of Tzacualpa, which name in itself is an\r\n     additional argument in favor of this supposition, inasmuch\r\n     as its meaning is Old Town. The third argument of Fuentes is\r\n     based on the improbability that the Spaniards would found a\r\n     city in an unpopulated district when the court and capital\r\n     of the Cakchiquels were at their command. Consequently the\r\n     court of King Sinacam was situated where the Spaniards first\r\n     established themselves, that is where Tzacualpa stands. See\r\n     also _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 255-9. Vazquez maintains that\r\n     this capital was the city Patinamit, antonomastically so\r\n     called, meaning the 'metropolis' or 'the city' par excellence.\r\n     The locality on which it was built was called 'Iximché,'\r\n     and in his own time Ohertinamit, which means Old Town. The\r\n     Mexicans who came with the Spaniards called it Quauhtemali,\r\n     meaning rotten tree, from an old worm-eaten Iximché tree.\r\n     To distinguish it from the Ciudad de Santiago founded by\r\n     the Spaniards, it was afterward named Tecpan Guatemala, that\r\n     is, Palace or Royal House of Guatemala, a meaning different\r\n     from that given by Fuentes, who says that Tecpan means\r\n     'above,' _encima_, as Tecpan Atitlan, a town situated on a\r\n     more elevated site than Atitlan. The city Tecpan Guatemala\r\n     still exists about half a league distant from the old site.\r\n     Vazquez, moreover, supports his opinion on the extent and\r\n     magnificence of the palace and public buildings indicated\r\n     by the ruins, which he visited in person; and also on the\r\n     fortified position of the place. _Chronica de Gvat._, 7,\r\n     10, 68, 73; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 243, 256-7. That the\r\n     arguments of Fuentes are fallacious, and that Vazquez is\r\n     right, Alvarado's own despatches prove almost to a certainty.\r\n     In his report to Cortés, dated 11th April, at Utatlan, he\r\n     says, 'Embiè à la Ciudad de Guatemala, que està diez Leguas\r\n     de esta,' and afterward informs Cortés that on that day he\r\n     will leave for the city of Guatemala, 'Yo me parto para la\r\n     Ciudad de Guatemala Lunes once de Abril.' At the commencement\r\n     of the next despatch he writes, 'Yo, Señor, partì de la Ciudad\r\n     de Uclatan, í vine en dos Dias à esta Ciudad de Guatemala.'\r\n     Now this 'city of Guatemala' was the capital of the king of\r\n     the Cakchiquels, and where Alvarado was entertained by him,\r\n     as will be told in the text, and it was ten leagues from\r\n     Utatlan, a distance which would occupy the army two days, as\r\n     stated by Alvarado; for it was difficult ground to march over,\r\n     being intersected by numerous ravines. _Vazquez_, _Chronica\r\n     de Gvat._, 7. The site proposed by Fuentes is nearly twice\r\n     the distance from Utatlan, and could not have been reached by\r\n     the Spaniards in the short period of two days, except by very\r\n     exhausting and forced marches, to which it is most improbable\r\n     that Alvarado subjected his men when on a visit to a friendly\r\n     power. Again, Alvarado reports that when on his expedition\r\n     against Atitlan he left the city of Guatemala and by a forced\r\n     march entered that territory the same day—'I anduve tanto,\r\n     que aquel Dia lleguè a su Tierra'—a distance that could\r\n     be accomplished from the existing ruins of Patinamit, but\r\n     apparently not from the Volcan de Agua.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-6] Juarros calls it 'chay.'\r\n\r\n     [XXV-7] _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 243-4. This author adds that\r\n     Bishop Marroquin, having heard of this stone, caused it to be\r\n     cut into a square and consecrated as part of the high altar\r\n     in the church of Tecpan Guatemala. Stephens saw it and says\r\n     that it is a piece of common slate. _Incid. of Travel in Cent.\r\n     Am._, ii. 150.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-8] 'Donde fui mui bien recibido de los Señores de ella,\r\n     que no pudiera ser mas en Casa de nuestros Padres; i fuimos\r\n     tan proveidos de todo lo necesario, que ninguna cosa hovo\r\n     falta.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 161.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-9] On this occasion Friar Juan de Torres converted and\r\n     baptized many. _Vazquez_, _Chronica de Gvat._, 7.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-10] Atitlan, in the Pipil language 'Correo de Agua,' or\r\n     'Water Courier.' This is according to Juarros, who states that\r\n     the place was also called Atziquinixal, which in the Quiché\r\n     language signifies 'House of the Eagle,' from the device of\r\n     the kings, who wore as their royal emblem an eagle fashioned\r\n     from the plumes of the quetzal. _Guat._, 245. Ternaux-Compans\r\n     wrongly interprets it 'watercourse,' 'cours d'eau.' _Voy._,\r\n     série i. tom. x. 416.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-11] Its real meaning, however, is 'heroes' or 'demigods.'\r\n\r\n     [XXV-12] An insurrection of the principal cities of the\r\n     monarchy had been promoted by this cacique. These cities,\r\n     according to Vazquez, were Tecpan Atitlan and others of that\r\n     province, while Fuentes believes them to have been Tecpan\r\n     Guatemala and its dependencies. _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 277.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-13] _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 160.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-14] 'Le dieron muchos presentes de oro y plata y joyas\r\n     en gran cantidad.' _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 7,\r\n     25, 28 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-15] 'À los quales mataron sin temor ninguno.' _Alvarado_,\r\n     _Relacion_, i. 161. Bernal Diaz states that Alvarado sent\r\n     messengers on three several occasions. _Hist. Verdad._, 175.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-16] Bernal Diaz affirms that Alvarado took with him\r\n     more than 140 soldiers, of whom twenty were cross-bowmen\r\n     and arquebusiers, and 40 horsemen, with 2000 Guatemalans. It\r\n     must, however, be concluded that the statements of the 'true\r\n     historian' with regard to the conquest of Guatemala cannot be\r\n     relied on as exact, since he admits that he was not present:\r\n     'Y esto digo, porque no me halle en estas Conquistas.' _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 175-6. Brasseur de Bourbourg also states that 2000\r\n     Cakchiquels, commanded by the Ahpotzotzil and the Ahpoxahil,\r\n     accompanied the Spaniards. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 652.\r\n     Juarros gives the forces as consisting of 40 horse, 100 foot,\r\n     and 2000 Guatemalans. It is quite evident that this author\r\n     never consulted Alvarado's despatches, judging from the many\r\n     instances of chronological, numerical, and other differences.\r\n     Alvarado says he marched so rapidly that he reached the\r\n     territory of the Zutugils the same day on which he left the\r\n     city of Guatemala. Juarros writes, 'Caminaba á convenientes\r\n     jornadas.' _Guat._, 278. Salazar follows Bernal Diaz. _Conq.\r\n     Mex._, 131.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-17] Juarros states that these forces were stationed\r\n     upon the peñol, or insular rock, but were so harassed by the\r\n     cross-bowmen that they sallied and gave fight to the Spaniards\r\n     on the plain. _Guat._, ii. 278.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-18] 'I por la mucha agrura de la Tierra, como digo, no\r\n     se mato mas Gente.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 162.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-19] About the middle of May, according to the Cakchiquel\r\n     manuscript. Bernal Diaz states that Olmedo preached the gospel\r\n     to the Indians, and celebrated mass on an altar which they\r\n     erected. The friar also put up an image of the virgin, which\r\n     Garay had brought and given him when he died. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     176.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-20] _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, in _Barcia_, i. 161-2;\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 175; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     230-1; _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.; _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 480-1; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 277-80; _Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 652-5. In a memorial\r\n     addressed by the chiefs of Atitlan to Philip II., and dated\r\n     February 1, 1571, it is stated that when Alvarado came into\r\n     the country he was received in a friendly spirit at Atitlan;\r\n     that no one took up arms against him, but that valuable\r\n     presents were made, while each town and village paid tribute\r\n     according to its means. Numbers of their principal men\r\n     accompanied him on his future campaigns, and lost their lives\r\n     in his service. _Ternaux-Compans_, _Voy._, série i., tom. x.,\r\n     419-20. Though the Atitlan campaign was less sanguinary than\r\n     the previous ones, this contradiction of all accounts, in\r\n     stating that the Spaniards were peaceably received, must have\r\n     proceeded from anxiety on the part of the natives to gain some\r\n     favor or obtain some redress.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-21] One witness at the trial of Alvarado in 1528-9 states\r\n     that he heard this person was a sister of the king, but from\r\n     the statement contained in the charge, and supported by many\r\n     witnesses, it can only be inferred that she was one of the\r\n     wives of the monarch. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     7, 22, passim. Brasseur de Bourbourg's version is that Suchil\r\n     was the wife of one of the highest dignitaries of the crown.\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 656.\r\n\r\n     [XXV-22] The defence set up by Alvarado when charged with\r\n     this outrage is exceedingly weak. He had been deceived by\r\n     the Cakchiquel nobles, he said, who, not wishing him to\r\n     march farther south, made false representations regarding\r\n     the difficulties he would meet with. A Spanish soldier named\r\n     Falcon reported that a slave girl described the country as\r\n     fair and rich; upon which Alvarado commanded her to be brought\r\n     forward. This was persistently refused by the chiefs, until he\r\n     seized one; then an Indian girl of noble birth was produced,\r\n     but not the right one. 'He, however, importuned them much,'\r\n     and finally Suchil was delivered up to him. The reader will\r\n     appreciate the probability of this story when he considers\r\n     how likely it was that the Cakchiquel nobles would seek to\r\n     deter Alvarado from proceeding against their national enemies.\r\n     _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_. See question and charge,\r\n     xvii. and xix., pp. 7 and 57, Alvarado's reply, p. 77-8, and\r\n     testimony.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-1] The native name of the chief town, Panatacat,\r\n     was known in the time of Vazquez as _Isquintepeque_.\r\n     Alvarado calls it _Iscuyntepeque_, _Relacion_, i. 162;\r\n     Herrera, _Yzquintepec_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.; Gomara,\r\n     _Izcuintepec_, _Hist. Mex._, 231. Its modern appellation is\r\n     Escuintla. See also _Native Races_, v. 607.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-2] 'Diciendoles, què adonde iban, i que eran locos, sino\r\n     que me dejasen à mi ir allà, i que todos me darian Guerra.'\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 162; _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v.\r\n     cap. x.; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 231.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-3] Juarros, followed by Brasseur de Bourbourg, states\r\n     that the army, when in Itzcuintlan, consisted of 250 Spanish\r\n     infantry, 100 cavalry, and 6000 Guatemalan and other Indians.\r\n     _Guat._ (ed. London, 1823), 229. Now, Alvarado a little\r\n     later in this campaign states that he had 150 infantry, 100\r\n     horse, and 5000 or 6000 Indian auxiliaries. This number of\r\n     infantry is more probably correct than that given by Juarros.\r\n     Alvarado had only 300 infantry when he left Mexico, and,\r\n     though few had been killed, numbers were wounded, and he had\r\n     left garrisons at various places. _Relacion_, i. 163. That he\r\n     should leave Itzcuintlan with 250 Spanish foot-soldiers and\r\n     lose 100 of them in a few weeks is a supposition that cannot\r\n     be entertained. Juarros appears to have followed Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 232, who gives the above figures.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-4] No summons of surrender was sent, which omission was\r\n     brought forward as a charge against the commander at a later\r\n     date. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 7, 57 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-5] Juarros states that this was a night attack, and that\r\n     the inhabitants were asleep when the Spaniards entered; Bernal\r\n     Diaz says that it occurred in the morning.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-6] 'Tambien me han dicho, que cinco Jornadas adelante\r\n     de vna Ciudad mui grande, que està veinte Jornadas de aqui,\r\n     se acaba esta Tierra ... si asi es, certisimo tengo que\r\n     es el Estrecho.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 160. Pelaez\r\n     erroneously makes this campaign follow the reduction of Mixco,\r\n     Sacatepeque, Mazatenango, etc. _Mem. Guat._, i. 45-46. Vazquez\r\n     thus describes it: 'Sin dejar las armas de las manos, ni dia\r\n     alguno de batallar en los Pueblos de la Costa, corrió como un\r\n     rayo, el y su Exercito.' _Chronica de Gvat._, 7.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-7] Laet, Ogilby, and Kiepert write _R. Michatoya_.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-8] Called _Atiepar_ by Alvarado; _Caetipar_ by Gomara;\r\n     _Atiquipaque_ by Juarros; _Aticpac_ by Brasseur de Bourbourg;\r\n     and by Ixtlilxochitl, in _Horribles Crueldades_, 69, _Cala_.\r\n     Alvarado states that both the language and race of people were\r\n     here different.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-9] _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 7-8 et seq. The\r\n     account given by Juarros differs so much from Alvarado's that\r\n     I can give the former but little consideration in the text.\r\n     It is to this effect: After crossing the river the Spaniards\r\n     were attacked by a large body of Indians, and an obstinate\r\n     battle ensued, in which Alvarado was dismounted by a chief,\r\n     who wounded his horse with a lance. Alvarado then attacked\r\n     the Indian on foot and killed him. The victory was for some\r\n     time doubtful, but passed finally to the Spaniards. On the\r\n     following day they entered the deserted town, where before\r\n     long they were again attacked by a fresh body of the enemy.\r\n     Cooped in the narrow streets, the Spaniards could not act, and\r\n     retreated to open ground, where they soon threw the Indians\r\n     into disorder.\r\n\r\n     Alvarado's despatches to Cortés, _Relacion de Alvarado_, form\r\n     the base of that portion of the conquest of Guatemala which\r\n     begins with the departure of the Spaniards from Soconusco\r\n     and terminates with the founding of the Ciudad de Santiago at\r\n     Patinamit. Two only of these reports are extant; that there\r\n     was at least one more is certain from the opening line of\r\n     the first, wherein Alvarado states that he had written from\r\n     Soconusco; 'de Soncomisco escrivì à Vuestra Magestad.' It\r\n     might be supposed, from the expression 'Vuestra Magestad,'\r\n     that the letter was addressed to the king of Spain; the\r\n     conclusion, however, proves that such was not the case,\r\n     as Alvarado requests Cortés to report his services to his\r\n     Majesty. 'Magestad' is probably a misprint for 'Merced,' or\r\n     an incorrect reading of the manuscript. These despatches were\r\n     first published at Toledo, October 20, 1525, with the fourth\r\n     report of Cortés to the king of Spain. They were afterward\r\n     translated into Italian by Ramusio and published at Venice\r\n     in 1565. In 1749 Barcia, a member of the royal council,\r\n     reproduced them, in Madrid, in his collection of the works\r\n     of the chroniclers, and it may be remarked that Ramusio's\r\n     translation does not always agree with this Spanish edition.\r\n     Ternaux-Compans translated Ramusio's version into French and\r\n     published the letters at Paris, in 1838, in his Collection\r\n     of Voyages. Alvarado's style is clear and simple, terse and\r\n     vigorous, and his descriptions are vivid. That he did not\r\n     report all his proceedings to Cortés is evident from the\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, already frequently quoted, in\r\n     which numerous acts of cruelty, outrage, and embezzlement\r\n     are charged against him. Yet there is no just reason to doubt\r\n     the truthfulness of his narrations so far as they go, since\r\n     they are supported by good authorities. It is suppression and\r\n     not misrepresentation of facts that can be charged against\r\n     him. In these two despatches the writer has portrayed his\r\n     own character most clearly. His energy, recklessness, and\r\n     indomitable will, his bravery, religious superstition, and\r\n     ambition, are all distinctly displayed; but in bold relief,\r\n     prominent above all other traits, is recognized his cruelty:\r\n     whenever the carnage on the battle-field has been unusually\r\n     dreadful he delights to report it to Cortés, sometimes even\r\n     mentioning the matter twice; and when the natives have\r\n     managed to escape him with comparatively small loss, he\r\n     regretfully enters into explanations and gives the reasons why\r\n     so few lives were taken. These despatches are particularly\r\n     interesting for their evidence relative to the site of\r\n     the first city founded by the Spaniards in Guatemala. They\r\n     moreover correct many errors committed by Remesal, Fuentes,\r\n     and Juarros, who, strange to say, could never have seen\r\n     these reports, or even Oviedo's almost verbatim copy of them.\r\n     Another narrative of the conquest was written by Gonzalo de\r\n     Alvarado, which work Pelaez, _Mem. Guat._, i. 47, considers\r\n     that Herrera must have seen. It was never published; Juarros\r\n     thus describes it: 'MS. de Gonzalo de Alvarado, que paraba en\r\n     poder de D. Nicolas de Vides y Alvarado, su descendiente.'\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-10] _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 7-8 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-11] 'Me recibieron de paz, i se alçaron dende à vna\r\n     hora.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 163.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-12] Juarros states that the army halted near the city,\r\n     and was almost immediately attacked by three strong bands\r\n     of natives, one descending from the heights of Nextiquipac,\r\n     another from Taxisco, and the third from Guazacapan. It\r\n     required all the skill and strength of the Spaniards to resist\r\n     the combined onset. But the division from Guazacapan abandoned\r\n     the field, while that which came down from the mountains\r\n     was broken and put to flight; whereupon the Taxisco party\r\n     submitted, and the town remained in the possession of the\r\n     Spaniards. _Juarros_, _Guat._ (ed. London, 1823), 231.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-13] Called by Alvarado _Nacendelan_, and _Necendelan_\r\n     by Gomara; in Mercator's Atlas, 1574, _Nacendelen_, and in the\r\n     _West-Indische Spieghel_, 64, _Nacedelan_. Its modern name is\r\n     Nancintla.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-14] These consisted of cloth, cross-bow strings,\r\n     horseshoes, nails, and other iron articles. Alvarado states\r\n     at a later date that the nails and horseshoes were cast with\r\n     copper by the Indians, who believed that the iron would melt\r\n     with it. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 79-80. The\r\n     clothing, he says, could not be recovered, as it had been torn\r\n     up for breech-clouts. _Relacion_, i. 163; _Oviedo_, iii. 483.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-15] Herrera affirms that they were from Nancintlan,\r\n     and had the custom of fighting with little bells, 'sendas\r\n     campanillas,' in their hands. Juarros states that all\r\n     inquiries to discover the reason of this practice have been\r\n     useless. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.; _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._ (ed. London, 1823), 232; also _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     232.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-16] Referred to as Don Pedro, one of Cortés' most\r\n     trusted officers. See _Hist. Mex._, chap. vi., this series.\r\n     He is mentioned more than once by Alvarado, and important\r\n     commands were intrusted to him. _Relacion_, i. 163-4.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-17] Juarros says this stay was made at Guazacapan, a\r\n     town passed on the way to Nancintlan. The army would have\r\n     been, thus far, about 25 days on the campaign of discovery:\r\n     Four days from Patinamit to Itzcuintlan, eight days at this\r\n     latter place, four days in passing through the towns of\r\n     Atiquipac, Tacuylula, and Taxisco, to Nancintlan, and eight\r\n     at this latter place.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-18] _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 8, 58, 79 et\r\n     seq. Brasseur de Bourbourg is of opinion that only certain\r\n     of the chiefs were captured after having fled, and that they\r\n     were hanged. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 660. I give the narrative\r\n     as derived from the evidence in Alvarado's trial.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-19] The present town of Pasaco, called _Pacoco_ by\r\n     Oviedo, iii. 483, and _Pazùco_ by Herrera, dec. iii. lib. v.\r\n     cap. x., and Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 232.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-20] These were placed slantwise, and projected two or\r\n     three fingers' width above the surface. They were smeared with\r\n     so noxious a poison that if but a drop of blood were drawn\r\n     the wounded man died insane, on the second, third, or seventh\r\n     day, suffering intense thirst. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v.\r\n     cap. x.; _Native Races_, ii. 744.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-21] _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x. On a previous\r\n     occasion they had met with this indication of hostility,\r\n     but in this instance they seem to have had an opportunity of\r\n     witnessing the ceremony. _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 163.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-22] 'I seguimos el alcance todo lo que se pudo seguir.'\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 163. Juarros states that this\r\n     victory did not decide the conquest of the district; some\r\n     towns submitted, but others retained their liberty. Among\r\n     those which sought for peace was the large town of Tejutla,\r\n     four leagues from Guazacapan, which was taken possession\r\n     of as an arsenal. After the conquest it gradually lost its\r\n     ancient importance, and was abandoned about the middle of the\r\n     seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-23] Near Bay of Sonsonate. See maps of Colon, 1527, and\r\n     Ribero, 1529, having at or near this point _r. Ciego_; also\r\n     Kiepert's _Map of Central America_, 1858. _R. Paza_ forms the\r\n     boundary between Salvador and Guatemala. Paza is evidently\r\n     an abbreviation of the native name Pazaco, and Paz a Spanish\r\n     corruption of Paza.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-24] Alvarado calls it _Mopicalco_; Herrera and Gomara,\r\n     _Mopicalãco_. Brasseur de Bourbourg remarks that it seems to\r\n     correspond with the present village of Nahuizalco, not far\r\n     from Sonsonate, in Salvador. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 661.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-25] Mentioned by the conqueror as Acaxual, 'donde\r\n     bate la Mar del Sur en èl.' _Relacion_, i. 163. Gomara calls\r\n     it _Acaiucatl_; Herrera, _Cayacatl_; and Oviedo _Acarval_,\r\n     while Ixtlilxochitl gives it the name of _Acayncatl_. Its\r\n     modern appellation is Acajutla. Juarros incorrectly states\r\n     that Alvarado did not discover it before 1534. _Guat._,\r\n     i. 254. Fernando Colon, 1527, and Diego de Ribero, 1529,\r\n     write _las matas_.

Dacaxutla_,\r\n     on the coast near the latter point _Guacapa_, and in the\r\n     interior _Chiquimula_. A little north river and city _las\r\n     Esclavos_; Kiepert, 1858, _B. de Sonsonate_, also a like named\r\n     city on the _R. St. Jago_. On the coast, _Acajutla_ city,\r\n     and eastward, _P. de los Remedios_, _Puerto Libertad_, and\r\n     _Pt. de la Concordia_. The coast is called _Cuesta del\r\n     Balsamo_.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-26] 'Parecian bien con los sacos como eran blancos, y de\r\n     colores, con muy buenos penachos q̃ lleuauan en las cabeças.'\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 232.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-27] It is on this occasion that Alvarado gives the\r\n     number of his forces. Ixtlilxochitl says there were not more\r\n     than 7000 Mexicans and Tezcucans ... and Alvarado had not more\r\n     than 250 Spanish foot and 100 horse, and some few thousand\r\n     Quauhtemaltecs. _Horribles Crueldades_, 69.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-28] Gomara states that Alvarado dared not attack them,\r\n     because they were so strong and well drawn up, but that the\r\n     Indians charged the Spanish army as it was moving by. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 232. Ixtlilxochitl's account is similar to that of\r\n     Gomara: 'Pasaron por un lado del ejército de los enemigos;\r\n     y como los vieron á la otra parte, envistieron con ellos.'\r\n     _Horribles Crueldades_, 69-70.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-29] Brasseur de Bourbourg, misled by Ternaux's\r\n     translation from Ramusio of Alvarado's letter, says: 'Sans que\r\n     l'inégalité du terrain permît aux Espagnols de leur opposer\r\n     beaucoup de résistance.' _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 662. See also\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 164, and _Alvarado_, _Lettres_, in\r\n     _Ternaux-Compans_, série i. tom. x.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-30] For armor they wore a sack, with sleeves reaching\r\n     down to the feet, of hard twisted cotton, three fingers\r\n     in thickness. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 232; _Alvarado_,\r\n     _Relacion_, i. 164; _Native Races_, ii. 742.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-31] He had been pierced through the thigh with an arrow,\r\n     which was shot with such force as to penetrate the saddle.\r\n     His leg was shortened in consequence to the extent of four\r\n     fingers' width, and he remained lame for life. _Alvarado_,\r\n     _Relacion_, i. 164. Remesal erroneously states that Alvarado\r\n     received this wound in Soconusco. _Hist. Chyapa_, 7.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-32] This is Alvarado's own statement: 'I fue tan grande\r\n     el destroço, que en ellos hicimos, que en poco tiempo no havia\r\n     ninguno de todos los que salieron vivos;' and lower, 'I en\r\n     caiendo la Gente de pie, los mataba todos.' _Relacion_, i.\r\n     164. Gomara says, 'Y casi no dexaron ninguno dellos viuo.'\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 232.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-33] Tacusocalco. _Oviedo_, iii. 484.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-34] The three brothers who accompanied Alvarado from\r\n     Mexico are now brought more into notice. There are three other\r\n     Alvarados mentioned by Fuentes in his list of conquerors, but\r\n     their names do not correspond to those of the other brothers\r\n     of the lieutenant-general. _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion\r\n     Florida_, MS., 25-7; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 14.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-35] 'Que verla de lejos era para espantar, porque tenian\r\n     todos los mas lanças de treinta palmos, todas en Arboledas.'\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 164. Herrera adds that the spears\r\n     were poisoned: 'Las lanças eran mayores, con yerua.' dec. iii.\r\n     lib. v. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-36] 'Peleò despues con otro exercito mayor, y mas\r\n     peligroso.' _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-37] Called by Alvarado, _Miaguaclan_; by Herrera,\r\n     _Mautlan_; by Ixtlilxochitl and Gomara, _Mahuatlan_.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-38] Atehuan, _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 164; Lechuan,\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.; Atlechuan, _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist.

In _Ogilby's America_, 1671, is written town _S.\r\n     Salvador_, and south of it a town _La Trinidad_; Laet, 1633,\r\n     _S.

Brasseur de Bourbourg states that the prince and\r\n     all his suite were seized and kept prisoners. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 664. The testimony of Alvarado's letter tends on\r\n     the contrary to prove that they escaped from the town with\r\n     the rest of the population: 'I mientras nos aposentamos, no\r\n     quedò Hombre de ellos en el Pueblo, que todos se fueron à las\r\n     Sierras. E como vi esto, Yo embiè mis Mensageros à los Señores\r\n     de alli à decirles, que no fuesen malos.' _Relacion_, i. 164.\r\n     Compare, however, _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 9 et\r\n     seq.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-43] _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 164-5; _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 58-9 et seq. Brasseur de Bourbourg,\r\n     regardless of all Spanish evidence, boldly assumes that the\r\n     king 'ainsi que tous les seigneurs de sa cour' were in fact\r\n     put to death, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 666-7, when in reality\r\n     they were fugitives in the mountains and merely condemned. It\r\n     is absurd to suppose that in the Cuzcatlan charge, No. xxvi.,\r\n     referred to above, Alvarado's accusers would have failed to\r\n     bring against him the deaths of the king and chiefs.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-44] The branding of slaves at Cuzcatlan was one of the\r\n     charges brought against Alvarado at his trial. The Spaniards\r\n     appear to have seized upon a number of the natives when they\r\n     first entered the town. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     9-59, passim. Las Casas uses these words: 'Stigma enim Regium,\r\n     iis, qui non evaserunt, inustum est. Ego etiam præcipuo totius\r\n     civitatis viri filio vidi imprimi.' _Regio. Ind. Devastat._,\r\n     38.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-45] 'Huuo poco despojo.' _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     v. cap. x. 'Poco oro y riquezas hallaron en este viage.'\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Horribles Crueldades_, 70.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-46] 'I supe de los Naturales como esta Tierra no tiene\r\n     cabo.' _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 165.\r\n\r\n     [XXVI-47] 'Padecieron hartos trabajos, hambre y calamidades\r\n     los nuestros, y los españoles.' _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Horribles Crueldades_, 70; also _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 232.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-1] Alvarado's report of the campaign bears this date,\r\n     and as he mentions in it that on his return he founded\r\n     the 'Ciudad del Señor Santiago,' he must have arrived at\r\n     least several days previous to the above date. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg, after pointing out a misconception of Fuentes,\r\n     exhibits some confusion in his own mind as to dates and time.\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, 667.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-2] Vazquez observes, 'Llegó â _Vulvusya_ que oy llaman\r\n     Almolonga; y auiendo en la falda de su bolcan assentado el\r\n     Real a los 25 de Jullio de 1524, diò su primer ser a la Ciudad\r\n     de Guatemala, con Nõbre de Villa que le duró muy pocos dias.'\r\n     _Chronica de Gvat._, 7. Remesal also states that the city\r\n     was founded on the slopes of the Volcan de Agua, at a place\r\n     called Panchoy, which signifies Great Lagoon, the valley there\r\n     being surrounded by mountains. The material of which the first\r\n     houses were built consisted, he says, of forked posts for\r\n     the corner pillars, of canes and mud for the walls, while the\r\n     roofs were thatched with dry grass. By the aid of the Mexicans\r\n     they were rapidly thrown up. A sufficient number for the\r\n     accommodation of all the army being completed, they waited for\r\n     the day of the Apostle Santiago, in order to found the city\r\n     on that day and dedicate it to their patron saint. It fell on\r\n     Monday, the 25th of July, when the founding was consummated.\r\n     _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 4. I have elsewhere shown that\r\n     Patinamit was the city which Alvarado called Guatemala. Now\r\n     there is positive evidence from his own despatch that he\r\n     founded the city of Santiago at or upon that same city of\r\n     Guatemala. 'Antes acorde me bolver à esta Ciudad de Guatemala,\r\n     ... asi que Yo soi venido à esta Ciudad ... hice, i edifiquè,\r\n     en nombre de su Magestad, vna Ciudad de Españoles, que se\r\n     dice la Ciudad del Señor Santiago,' he writes. The use of\r\n     the expression 'esta Ciudad de Guatemala' in other portions\r\n     of the despatch proves that it was written at the capital\r\n     of the Cakchiquel king, while at the conclusion it is dated\r\n     thus: 'De esta ciudad de Santiago, à veinte i ocho de Julio\r\n     de mil i quinientos i veinte i quatro Años.' Thus it is clear\r\n     that the city of Guatemala and the city of Santiago were one,\r\n     and that Alvarado appropriated to himself Sinacam's capital.\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 161-2, 165-6. It may be here stated\r\n     that in direct opposition to Alvarado's application of the\r\n     term ciudad to the new settlement, both Vazquez and Remesal\r\n     assert that it was a villa, the latter adding that it retained\r\n     this title eighteen days, and was erected into a city on the\r\n     12th of August. _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 4, 6. Pelaez says\r\n     the city was called 'Ciudad de Santiago de los caballeros,'\r\n     but not till November 22, 1527. Vazquez affirms, _Chronica de\r\n     Gvat._, 11, that it was so called on the 29th of July, 1524,\r\n     while Remesal gives August 12th of the same year. Pelaez, in\r\n     his introduction to vol. i., states that Guatemala took its\r\n     name from the expression of Guhatezmalhá, that is to say 'the\r\n     hill which throws out water.' From the acts of the cabildo\r\n     we know that it was called a city on the 29th of July, 1524.\r\n     _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 8.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-3] _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 25;\r\n     _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 7; Zabarrieta, according to\r\n     Remesal.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-4] This right to appoint alcaldes and regidores was\r\n     maintained and exercised by Alvarado whenever he was present,\r\n     as is proved by the cabildos of 1525 and 1526. _Remesal_,\r\n     _Hist. Chyapa_, 4. _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 11-18.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-5] The cabildo, as an assumption of its official\r\n     prerogatives, entered into session the same day, and arranged\r\n     legal prices for provisions. _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_,\r\n     4. On July 27th we find that an act was passed regulating\r\n     the blacksmith's rates. Two dollars was to be his charge\r\n     for making 100 nails, the iron being furnished to him. The\r\n     charge for shoeing a horse one gold dollar, and the same\r\n     for bleeding. It is curious to observe that the price of\r\n     horseshoes in Alvarado's army in April, 1524, was $190 a\r\n     dozen, at which rate they were bought and sold in his camp.\r\n     _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, i. 160. Remesal says that operatives,\r\n     knowing the necessity of their services, charged what they\r\n     liked. The tailor charged a real a stitch, and shoemakers\r\n     worked only at such high wages that while soling other\r\n     people's shoes with leather they might have used silver for\r\n     their own; and the blacksmith could have made his tools of\r\n     gold had he wished. On the 12th of December, 1524, the cabildo\r\n     deemed it necessary to establish fixed rates for labor of\r\n     all kinds. The measures adopted were punctually carried out\r\n     by those in power. The regulations were modified as time\r\n     required, and every two years, at most, new rates were adapted\r\n     to the condition of affairs, with which even the lords of\r\n     estates were compelled to comply. The artisans, however, still\r\n     contrived to cause the other colonists much inconvenience\r\n     by refusing all payment for work except in gold coin, the\r\n     tailor otherwise retaining his customer's clothes, even on a\r\n     feast-day, and the shoemaker his shoes. This state of things\r\n     lasted till 1529, when the corporation on the 19th of February\r\n     made the aboriginal currency of the country, cacao, feathers,\r\n     and clothing, legal tender. _Hist. Chyapa_, 6; _Arévalo_,\r\n     _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 8-67, passim. Another of the first acts\r\n     of this new corporation was the appointment of a town-crier,\r\n     his salary being fixed at $100 a year. _Id._, 7-8. With\r\n     regard to this office of crier, Remesal states that it had to\r\n     be accepted by the person selected to fill it under pain of\r\n     death. _Hist. Chyapa_, 4. On the present occasion the person\r\n     chosen was Diego Diaz, who strongly objected to the calling,\r\n     but was compelled to accept. Remesal, with his death penalty,\r\n     goes beyond the act of the corporation, which says 'so pena\r\n     de cient azotes.' _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 8. As an\r\n     instance of the dearness of provisions, we find an act passed\r\n     on the 6th of May, 1525, limiting the price of eggs to one\r\n     gold real apiece. _Id._, 12, 14.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-6] _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 8. But Remesal, who\r\n     is continually at variance with the best authorities, says on\r\n     the 29th of July.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-7] Vazquez says there were enrolled as settlers at the\r\n     founding less than 200 Spaniards, for, though very few had\r\n     fallen in battle, detachments had been left at Quezaltenango\r\n     and Patinamit. With regard to this latter place it must be\r\n     borne in mind that Vazquez believed the city to have been\r\n     founded on the Volcan de Agua. _Chronica de Gvat._, 10-11;\r\n     see also _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 8-19.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-8] 'Cortes ... confirmo los repartimientos, y ayudo a\r\n     pedir aquella gouernacion.' _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 233; see\r\n     also _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-9] It will be seen in the narrative that the Spaniards\r\n     were soon obliged to abandon Patinamit and locate elsewhere,\r\n     and that the city of Santiago had no permanent site until its\r\n     establishment in Panchoy in 1527.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-10] 'Pedro de Alvarado les mando que dentro de cierto\r\n     termino le diesen mill hojas de oro de a quinze pesos cada\r\n     hoja.' _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 59. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg states that the king and royal family were commanded\r\n     to bring vases filled with the precious metals, and to deliver\r\n     up even their crowns and personal ornaments. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 673.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-11] The Indians appear to have brought in pyrites not\r\n     unfrequently. Las Casas, speaking of the Cuzcatecs, says:\r\n     'Indiani igitur magnum hastarum ex orichalcho inaurato,\r\n     numerum, quæ aureæ esse videbantur ... congregarunt.\r\n     Capitaneus eas Lydio lapide probari jussit, cumque orichalcum\r\n     esse cerneret,' etc. _Regio.

'Alvarado no\r\n     tomava syno oro fino e lo rescebia por el toque.' _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 59.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-12] See _Bancroft's Native Races_, ii. 732.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-13] Brasseur de Bourbourg gives August 27, 1524, as\r\n     the date of this abandonment of Patinamit by the Cakchiquels.\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 676. This date would be about two\r\n     months earlier than that assigned to the event in Alvarado's\r\n     evidence for defence, where it is shown to have occurred six\r\n     or seven months after his seizure of Queen Suchil. _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 100, 146-7, passim.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-14] The high price of food during this war is evident\r\n     from an act of the cabildo, passed May 6, 1525, limiting the\r\n     charge for a hog weighing 120 pounds to twenty pesos de oro,\r\n     equivalent to nearly $300 of our day; while eggs were one\r\n     real de oro each, that is over $1.50. _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt.\r\n     Guat._, 13-14.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-15] Las Casas tells a frightful story of reprisal,\r\n     wherein the Spaniards drove all their captives, man, woman,\r\n     or child, into these staked pits. _Regio. Ind. Devastat._, 36.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-16] Brasseur de Bourbourg imagines this place to have\r\n     been situated in the Zutugil territory. _Hist. Nat. Civ._,\r\n     iv. 678.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-17] Brasseur de Bourbourg takes the view that both the\r\n     later Zacatepec war and the capture of Mixco occurred during\r\n     the suppression of the Cakchiquel revolt. But he seems to\r\n     me somewhat inconsistent. He makes the subjugation of the\r\n     Cakchiquels last 'pendant plusieurs mois' after Alvarado's\r\n     return to Patinamit, and yet a little later he points out\r\n     that during the first months of the year 1525 Salvador was\r\n     reconquered and a Spanish town founded there. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 680-1. It is scarcely to be supposed that a second\r\n     campaign into Salvador could have been undertaken while the\r\n     Cakchiquel war was going on. Moreover, according to his\r\n     interpretation of the Cakchiquel manuscript, the town of\r\n     Zumpango was one of many which submitted to the Spaniards\r\n     after the destruction of Mixco; and, as will be seen later,\r\n     the reduction of Zacatepec was owing to the hostile incursions\r\n     from that district against Zumpango while Alvarado was absent\r\n     on a campaign. The Cakchiquel manuscript is the production of\r\n     Francisco Ernandez Arana Xahila, and contains a brief history\r\n     of the Cakchiquel nation from the earliest times. The author\r\n     was the grandson of King Hunyg of the Ahpotzotzil line, and it\r\n     is written in his hand down to the year 1562, from which time\r\n     it is continued somewhat further by Francisco Gebuta Queh, of\r\n     the same family. Brasseur de Bourbourg, _Bib. Mex. Guat._, 13,\r\n     says that it was translated into French in 1856 at Rabinal in\r\n     Guatemala.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-18] This city had been founded by the Pocoman Indians,\r\n     during their early wars with the Quichés and the Cakchiquels,\r\n     the site selected being on account of its natural strength.\r\n     _Native Races_, i. 787; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 245. It was\r\n     situated in the valley of Xilotepec, on a ridge between the\r\n     Pixcayatl and the Rio Grande de Motagua, the former river\r\n     being a tributary of the latter, and meaning 'guardian\r\n     stream.' _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 350; _Brasseur de Bourbourg_,\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 680.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-19] Juarros states that two defenders, by rolling\r\n     stones down the steep path from the heights above, could\r\n     prevent an army from entering. _Guat._, ii. 284.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-20] Fuentes says 30 cavalry, serving on foot, and 200\r\n     Tlascaltecs. _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 14-5.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-21] _Macario_, _Xecul MS._, 7; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii.\r\n     285.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-22] In this engagement, for the Indians were pursued\r\n     after Aguilar's rescue, more than 200 Chignautecs fell,\r\n     says Juarros. On the side of the Spaniards many Tlascaltecs\r\n     were slain, among whom were two illustrious chiefs, Juan\r\n     Xuchiatl and Gerónimo Carrillo—the Spanish name of this\r\n     Indian chief—while of the Spaniards themselves a considerable\r\n     proportion received severe wounds. _Guat._, ii. 285. Besides\r\n     Aguilar and the three captains, whose names are given in the\r\n     text, Fuentes mentions also Gutierre de Robles and Pedro de\r\n     Olmos as having greatly signalized themselves in this action.\r\n     _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 16.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-23] Fuentes, who wrote between 1690 and 1700, gives\r\n     a partial description of a cavern, the entrance to which\r\n     was on a small ridge by the side of the ruins of Mixco.\r\n     The door-way was of clay, three feet wide and three high.\r\n     Thirty-six stone steps led down to a spacious chamber,\r\n     having at its end another flight of stairs, down which no\r\n     one had passed far, for the reason that the ground began\r\n     to tremble as the explorer proceeded. Eighteen steps had,\r\n     however, been descended, and an arched opening on the right\r\n     side discovered, leading by six steps into a long cavern.\r\n     No further explorations had been made. Ubi sup., cap. ii.;\r\n     _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 350-1 _Native Races_, iv. 119-20.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-24] The distance of the outlet from the camp must have\r\n     been considerable, as Fuentes states that a day was allowed\r\n     for the arrival of Loarca's force at the cave. _Fuentes y\r\n     Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 17.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-25] The account given by Fuentes is somewhat confused.\r\n     From his version on page 17 the reader is led to suppose that\r\n     Loarca's party were to ascend by the cavernous passage, and\r\n     in the order given in the text, while on page 19 he states\r\n     that those who fled by the cave were attacked by the party\r\n     'stationed in ambush.'\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-26] Fuentes says that Lopez de Villanueva and two\r\n     others quickly took his place.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-27] _Tezump_, _Quiché MS._, 7; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii.\r\n     284-8; _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 14-9.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-28] The Mixco of to-day is distant from the present\r\n     city of Guatemala about two leagues, and nine or ten leagues\r\n     from the ruins of the Mixco destroyed by Alvarado. Its\r\n     destruction was followed by the submission of various towns,\r\n     among which, according to the Cakchiquel MS., were Xilotepec,\r\n     Yampuk, Papuluka, and Zumpango.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-29] _Cakchiquel MS._, 5; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 281;\r\n     _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 12. Jimenez\r\n     makes a marginal note in the manuscript of Fuentes, stating\r\n     that 'this is false, because they had rebelled previous to the\r\n     arrival of the Spaniards and made their capital at Yampuk.'\r\n     _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 12-3.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-30] Fuentes asserts that they were wont to celebrate\r\n     their feasts, during which these victims were immolated, on\r\n     hills in full view of the Indians who were friendly to the\r\n     Spaniards, in order to provoke them.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-31] Juarros assigns too early a date, January 1525,\r\n     for the events which follow, but he appears to be quite\r\n     unconscious of this first Cakchiquel revolt. _Guat._, ii. 281.\r\n     Jimenez has made a marginal note in the manuscript of Fuentes\r\n     as follows: 'This town,' meaning Xinaco, 'was founded some\r\n     time afterward—therefore this is false.'\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-32] Fuentes states that the Spaniards at this time were\r\n     engaged in the Atitlan war. _Recordacion Florida_, MS., 13.\r\n     This is a mistake. Atitlan was subdued in 1524, and Alvarado,\r\n     who gives a detailed account of the affair, would have\r\n     mentioned this war with the Zacatepecs had it occurred at that\r\n     time. Juarros says Alvarado was engaged in the Atitlan war or\r\n     that of the Pipiles. _Guat._, ii. 282. This latter conjecture\r\n     is doubtless right. There is evidence that Alvarado undertook\r\n     his second campaign along the coast against Salvador during\r\n     the early part of 1525, conquered the country, and founded\r\n     the city of San Salvador. No records of the events remain, but\r\n     from an act of the cabildo of Guatemala, dated the 6th of May,\r\n     1525, we learn that one Diego Holguin had previously left the\r\n     city to 'reside in the villa de San Salvador, of which he was\r\n     alcalde.' _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 13.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-33] Fuentes, followed by Juarros, states that this\r\n     was done by the advice of an aged Indian named Choboloc. He\r\n     had observed that the Spaniards did not engage with all their\r\n     forces at once, but always kept a body of men in reserve, and\r\n     suggested to the chiefs of his nation the adoption of similar\r\n     tactics.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-34] _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion Florida_, MS.,\r\n     12-14; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 281-3.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-35] This ruler, says Gonzalo de Alvarado, displayed in\r\n     his person the nobility of his blood and was about 40 years\r\n     of age. _Alvarado, Gonzalo de_, _Memoria_, MS.; _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._, ii. 319.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-36] The Cakchiquels are said to have applied the\r\n     word Mem to the Maya-speaking tribes. This word, meaning\r\n     'stutterers,' was corrupted by the Spaniards into Mames. They\r\n     occupied that portion of the country which lay between the\r\n     Quiché territory and Chiapas, now the province of Totonicapan.\r\n     See _Native Races_, ii. 128, v., passim.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-37] The Hondo, during the dry season, is but a small\r\n     shallow stream. In the wet season, however, it becomes a deep\r\n     and dangerous river, hence its name, El Rio Hondo, 'the deep\r\n     river.'\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-38] _Macario_, _Xecul MS._, 16; _Juarros_, _Guat._,\r\n     ii. 311. The town still exists.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-39] _Quiché MS._, 10; _Juarros_, _Guat._, ii. 311-13.\r\n     A city which remains to the present day under the same name.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-40] Like Utatlan and Mixco, this city was situated on\r\n     a plateau surrounded by ravines. The plateau was twelve miles\r\n     in circumference, and on it are still to be seen the ruins of\r\n     Zakuléu, known by the name of Las Cuevas, the caves, about\r\n     half a league from Huehuetenango. They are only a confused\r\n     heap of rubbish, overgrown with brushwood. Two pyramidal\r\n     structures of stone and mortar can, however, be made out.\r\n     Juarros calls the place Socoleo, which is the present name\r\n     of a village and stream in the locality. _Guat._, ii. 313-14;\r\n     _Native Races_, iv. 128-30.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-41] The Spaniards lost in this engagement 40 Indians\r\n     and three horses, while eight soldiers were severely wounded,\r\n     among them Gonzalo de Alvarado. They collected from the bodies\r\n     of the slain a great quantity of gold medals. _Alvarado,\r\n     Gonzalo de_, _Memoria_, MS.; _Juarros_, _Guat._ ii. 315-16.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-42] The present Socoleo, a tributary of the river\r\n     Selegua.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-43] This guard consisted of 400 Indians and ten picked\r\n     Spaniards, under command of Antonio de Salazar. _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._, ii. 317.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-44] During the battle, which was fought in full view\r\n     of Zakuléu, the Mames attempted a sally in support of the\r\n     mountaineers but were repelled by Salazar. _Juarros_, _Guat._,\r\n     ii. 317.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-45] Juarros adds that Gonzalo did not adopt this plan\r\n     at first for the reason that he wanted to avail himself of\r\n     his cavalry in the assault. _Guat._, ii. 318.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-46] _Alvarado, Gonzalo de_, _Memoria_, MS.; _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._, ii. 319. Gonzalo de Alvarado affirms that 1800 Mames\r\n     perished in the defence of Zakuléu. _Id._\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-47] Juarros states that a stone slab formed the door\r\n     of the fort, and that this was broken up.\r\n\r\n     [XXVII-48] The authorities that have been consulted for the\r\n     history of the conquest of Guatemala are the following:\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_ [ed. Paris, 1866], 289-90, 304-5,\r\n     containing information down to the departure of Alvarado for\r\n     Guatemala; _Alvarado_, _Relacion_, in _Barcia_, _Hist. Prim._,\r\n     157-66, and in _Ternaux-Compans_, _Voy._, série i., tom. x.,\r\n     107-50, taken as bases of that portion of the history which\r\n     includes the entrance into Guatemala territory and succeeding\r\n     events down to the founding of the city of Santiago; _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 448, 459-60, 475-87, wherein Cortés and Alvarado are\r\n     closely followed; _Peter Martyr_, dec. viii. cap. v., relating\r\n     mainly to the narrative of the messengers sent to Guatemala,\r\n     merely mentioning Alvarado's departure; _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 229-33; _Id._, _Hist. Ind._, 266-8, which affords but\r\n     little additional information to that supplied by Oviedo;\r\n     _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, ii. 100-5, 181-2; _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 77, 174-6; _Las Casas_, _Regio.\r\n     Ind. Devastat._, 35-40, and _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Horribles\r\n     Crueldades_, 66-71. The former of these two last authorities\r\n     is exceptionally severe against Alvarado, and enumerates\r\n     numbers of atrocities committed by him and his followers,\r\n     while the latter prominently brings forward the services of\r\n     the Mexican auxiliaries, and mentions the excessive hardships\r\n     and cruelties they suffered. _Id._, _Relaciones_, 431-3.\r\n     Herrera, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. viii.-xi., occasionally\r\n     differs from Alvarado's statements, but is generally reliable.\r\n     See also _Lorenzana_, _Viage_, in _Cortés_, _Hist. N. España_,\r\n     335-6, 369-70; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, viii.\r\n     17; _Arévalo_, _Actas Ayunt. Guat._, 7-15; _Ramirez_, _Proceso\r\n     contra Alvarado_, passim—which work throws much light upon\r\n     the doings of the conqueror, though contradictory evidence\r\n     renders it ofttimes difficult to decide on the merits of a\r\n     charge; _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, iii. 296-8; _Atitlan_, _Requête\r\n     de plusieurs chefs_, in _Ternaux-Compans_, série i., tom. x.,\r\n     415-25; _Suchimilco_, _Carta de sus caciques_, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii., 293-4; _Remesal_, _Hist.\r\n     Chyapa_, 2-7, an author unreliable so far as the conquest\r\n     of Guatemala goes when not supported by other authorities;\r\n     _Galvano's Discov._, 156-7; _Voyages, Selection of Curious,\r\n     Rare, and Early_, 31; _Fuentes y Guzman_, _Recordacion\r\n     Florida_, MS., 1-4, 12-19, 25-7, has many errors and is far\r\n     from reliable; _Vazquez_, _Chronica de Gvat._, 1-17, 68,\r\n     522-6; _Gonzalez Dávila_, _Teatro Ecles._, i. 139; _Juarros_,\r\n     _Guat._, i. 60, 64, 66-7, 79, 253; ii. 240-60, 277-88, 309-20;\r\n     _Id._ [ed.
