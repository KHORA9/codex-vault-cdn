But Magellan really had no\r\nchoice; for if the western passage which he expected to discover was\r\nto be sought for, it could only be under the auspices of Spain, within\r\nwhose demarcation those waters lay.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that D. Manuel had only himself to blame for the loss\r\nof Magellan’s services; and, as M. Amoretti well observes, D. Manuel\r\nought to have been well aware of the value of those services, since\r\nCharles V knew it, and showed his appreciation of them. It is difficult\r\nto believe that the injury of which Magellan complained, and which led\r\nhim to seek other service, was merely, as Osorio says, the refusal of\r\npromotion in palace rank, and which he had well deserved, especially\r\nsince the motive ascribed by Osorio to the king’s refusal, namely the\r\nnecessity of avoiding a bad precedent, was not alone a sufficient\r\naffront to account for Magellan’s sacrificing all his hopes and\r\nproperty in his own country, had he not also felt that the king was\r\ncondemning him to inaction, obscurity, and uselessness. Barros, indeed,\r\nsays that:\r\n\r\n  “The favours of princes given for services are a retributive\r\n  justice, which must be observed equally with all, with regard to\r\n  the quality of each man: and that if a man’s portion be denied\r\n  him, though he endures it ill, yet he will have patience; but if\r\n  he see the advancement of those who have profited more by artifice\r\n  and friends than by their own merits, he loses all patience;\r\n  indignation, hatred, and despair arise, and he will commit faults\r\n  injurious to himself and others. And what outraged Magellan more\r\n  than the refusal of the half ducat a month, was that some men who\r\n  were with him at Azamor, said that his lameness was feigned to\r\n  support his petition.”\r\n\r\nThe king, moreover, refused to receive Magellan, and showed his\r\nill-will against him. It is therefore highly probable that before\r\nMagellan took the step of leaving Portugal, D. Manuel, prompted by\r\nhis niggardly disposition, had refused to entertain Magellan’s desire\r\nfor employment at sea, or his projects of discovery, from which\r\nno immediate profit was to be expected. This is apparent from the\r\nstatement of Barros, _Decad._ III, lib. v, cap. viii, that letters of\r\nMagellan to Francisco Serrano were found after the death of the latter\r\nin Maluco, in which Magellan said that he should soon see him; and, if\r\nit were not by way of Portugal, it would be by way of Castile, and that\r\nSerrano should therefore wait for him there. Further on, Barros says\r\nthat recourse to Castile appears from these letters to have been in\r\nMagellan’s mind some time before the occurrence of the king’s dismissal\r\nof his business: and that this was shown by his always associating with\r\npilots, and occupying himself with sea-charts.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese exaggerated very much the injury they expected to\r\nresult, and, later, which they thought had resulted from Magellan’s\r\nvoyage, which could not change the position of the Moluccas, nor\r\nconsequently the Portuguese title to them; but the apprehensions\r\nwhich they felt, arose from their fear of others sharing in the spice\r\ntrade, and from the limited geographical knowledge of the period,\r\nwhich left both parties very much in doubt as to the true position of\r\nthose islands, or as to the extent of the circumference of the globe.\r\nThe question of the exact position of the Moluccas was not definitely\r\nascertained till much later, though a compromise was arrived at in 1529\r\nby the treaty between Spain and Portugal, by which Charles V gave up\r\nwhatever rights to the Moluccas he imagined he possessed, to Portugal,\r\nfor a sum of three hundred and fifty thousand ducats.[1] As late as\r\n1535, Gaspar Correa mentions, tom. iii, p. 661, a Dominican friar in\r\nPortuguese India, who was learned in cosmography, and who asserted that\r\nthe Moluccas fell within the demarcation of Castile.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of complaint of the Portuguese against Magellan are,\r\nperhaps, best expressed, and in the strongest terms, by Bishop Osorio,\r\nso it may be well to quote from him the following passage. Lib. XI, §\r\n23.\r\n\r\n  “About this time a slight offence on the part of the king (D.\r\n  Manuel) so grievously exasperated the mind of a certain Portuguese,\r\n  that, forgetful of all faith, piety, and religion, he hastened to\r\n  betray the king who had educated him, and the country which had\r\n  brought him forth; and he risked his life amongst the greatest\r\n  perils. Ferdinand Magellan, of whom we have before spoken, was a\r\n  man of noble birth, and endued with a high spirit. He had given\r\n  proofs in India, in warlike affairs, of courage and perseverance\r\n  in no small degree. Likewise in Africa he had performed his duties\r\n  with great ardour. Formerly it was the custom among the Portuguese\r\n  that the king’s servants should be fed in the palace at the king’s\r\n  expense; but when the number of these servants had become so great\r\n  (because the sons of the king’s officers retained the same station,\r\n  and besides, many were admitted for their services into the king’s\r\n  household), it was seen to be very difficult to prepare the food\r\n  of such a multitude. On this account it was determined by the\r\n  Kings of Portugal that the food which each man was to receive in\r\n  the palace should be provided by himself out of the king’s money.\r\n  Thus it was settled that a certain sum of money was assigned per\r\n  month to each man. That money, indeed, when provisions were so\r\n  cheap, provided abundantly for the men; but now that the number of\r\n  men, and the prices of commodities had increased, it happened that\r\n  the sum, which formerly was more than sufficient for their daily\r\n  expenses, was now much too small. Moreover, as all the dignity of\r\n  the Portuguese depends upon the king, this small sum of money is\r\n  as eagerly sought after as though it were much more ample. And\r\n  as the Portuguese think that the thing most to be desired is to\r\n  be enrolled amongst the king’s household, so also, they consider\r\n  the greatest honour to consist in an increase of this stipend.\r\n  For, as there are various ranks of king’s servants, so the sum of\r\n  money is assigned to each servant according to the dignity of his\r\n  rank. The highest class is that of nobleman; but, as there are\r\n  distinctions of nobility, so an equal salary is not given to all.\r\n  Thus it happens that the nobility of each is estimated according\r\n  to the importance of this stipend, and each one is held to be more\r\n  noble in proportion to the more ample stipend which he receives.\r\n  This judgment, indeed, as human affairs go, is often most false;\r\n  for many obtain through ambition and pertinacity what ought to be\r\n  assigned to deserts and innate nobleness. The Portuguese, however,\r\n  since they are over anxious in seeking this nobility, and imagine\r\n  that their nobility is increased by a small accession of salary,\r\n  very often think that they must strive for this little sum of\r\n  money, as though all their well-being and dignity depended upon it.\r\n  Now, Magellan contended that for his services, his stipend should\r\n  be increased monthly by half a ducat. The king refused it him,\r\n  lest an entrance should be opened to ambitious persons. Magellan,\r\n  excited by the injury of the refusal of this advantage to him at\r\n  that time, abandoned the king, broke his faith, and brought the\r\n  State into extreme danger. And whilst we ought to tolerate the\r\n  injuries inflicted by the State, and to endure also the outrages of\r\n  kings, who are the fathers of the republick, and whilst we ought\r\n  to lay down our lives for the well-being of our country, which\r\n  lives we owe to our country; this most audacious man conceived such\r\n  despite on account of half a ducat, amounting to five denarii,\r\n  which was refused to him, that he opposed the State; he offended\r\n  the king, who had brought him up; and brought his country, for\r\n  which he should have died, into peril. For the affair reached\r\n  such a pitch that the danger of a perilous war impended over the\r\n  commonwealth. I do not know, indeed, whence so barbarous a custom\r\n  has crept into the State: for, whilst the name of a traitor is not\r\n  only hateful and hated, but also burns in the stain of everlasting\r\n  dishonour upon a whole posterity; yet men who determine upon\r\n  breaking their faith, and opposing their kings or states, may\r\n  reject the favours they have received by formal letters, may abjure\r\n  their fealty, and despoil themselves of the rights and duties of\r\n  the State; they bid the king keep for himself that which belongs\r\n  to him, and they attest that thenceforward they will have nothing\r\n  in common with their country: then, at length, they contend that\r\n  it is allowable for them to commence war against their country. Be\r\n  it so: reject favours if it please you; contemn the liberality of\r\n  your country; grumble as much as you please, that a reward equal\r\n  to your dignity has not been granted. But by what means can you\r\n  betray the faith which you have plighted? My country has inflicted\r\n  on me a severe outrage; it has inflicted, indeed, the worst. But\r\n  an outrage is not to be avenged, either upon parents or upon one’s\r\n  country. I have abandoned, he says, all that I had received from my\r\n  country. Have you then rejected life, disposition, and education?\r\n  By no means. But all these things; you received them, in the first\r\n  place, from God, and then from the laws, customs, and institutions\r\n  of your country. It will never be allowable to combat nature, to\r\n  injure your country, or to break faith, even should you be laden\r\n  with every injury. Nay, your life should be given up, and the most\r\n  extreme punishments should be undergone, sooner than break your\r\n  faith, or betray your duty. Abjure fealty as much as you please,\r\n  attest your perfidy by public letters, leave to posterity a notable\r\n  memory of unspeakable wickedness; yet you will not be able by any\r\n  such document to avoid offending the Deity, nor the stain of an\r\n  everlasting opprobrium.”\r\n\r\nAgainst this view of Osorio may be set the following passage from\r\nVattel, which has all the more weight, in that it is simply an\r\nenunciation of law and right, and is not written to support or to\r\ndenounce any particular person.\r\n\r\n  “Many distinctions will be necessary, in order to give a complete\r\n  solution to the celebrated question, whether a man may _quit his\r\n  country_, or _the society of which he is a member_. The children\r\n  are bound by natural ties to the society in which they were born;\r\n  they are under an obligation to shew themselves grateful for the\r\n  protection it has afforded to their fathers, and are in a great\r\n  measure indebted to it for their birth and education. They ought,\r\n  therefore, to love it, as we have already shewn, to express a just\r\n  gratitude to it, and requite its services as far as possible by\r\n  serving it in turn. We have observed above, that they have a right\r\n  to enter into the society of which their fathers were members. But\r\n  every man is born free; and the son of a citizen, when come to the\r\n  years of discretion, may examine whether it be convenient for him\r\n  to join the society for which he was destined by his birth. If he\r\n  does not find it advantageous to remain in it, he is at liberty to\r\n  quit it, on making it a compensation for what it has done in his\r\n  favour, and preserving, as far as his new engagements will allow\r\n  him, the sentiments of love and gratitude he owes it.”—_Chitty’s\r\n  translation of Vattel_, book I, cap. xix, § 220.\r\n\r\nThere are also some remarkable passages in a pamphlet by Condorcet,\r\ndated October 25th, 1791, named _Opinion sur les Emigrants_. This\r\nopinion deserves attention, both on account of its author and the time\r\nin which it was written, when popular passions and prejudices were much\r\nexcited against those who were expatriating themselves from France.\r\n\r\nCondorcet begins with the statement, that:\r\n\r\n  “It is a great error to imagine that the public utility is not\r\n  constantly to be found united with the rights of individuals, or\r\n  that the public well-being may demand acts of real injustice.\r\n  This error has everywhere been the eternal excuse for the inroads\r\n  of tyranny, and the pretext for the artful manœuvres employed to\r\n  establish it.[2]”\r\n\r\n  “On the contrary, in the case of every measure that is proposed\r\n  as useful, it must first be examined whether it is just. Should\r\n  it not be so, it must be concluded that it had only an empty and\r\n  fallacious appearance of utility.”\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Nature concedes to every man the right of going out of his\r\n  country; the constitution guarantees it to every French citizen,\r\n  and we cannot strike a blow at it. The Frenchman who wishes to\r\n  leave his country, for his business, for his health, even for\r\n  the sake of his peace and well-being, ought to have the fullest\r\n  liberty to do so: he ought to be able to use this liberty, without\r\n  his absence depriving him of the least of his rights. In a great\r\n  empire, the variety of professions, and inequality of fortunes,\r\n  do not admit of residence and personal service being regarded as\r\n  a common obligation which the law may impose upon all citizens.\r\n  This rigorous obligation can only exist in the case of absolute\r\n  necessity; to extend it to the habitual state of society, and even\r\n  to all periods when the public safety or tranquillity may seem to\r\n  be menaced, would be to disturb the order of useful labours, and to\r\n  attack the sources of general prosperity.”\r\n\r\n   “Every man, moreover, has the right to change his country; he may\r\n  renounce that in which he was born, to choose another. From that\r\n  moment, as a citizen of his new country, he is only a foreigner in\r\n  the first; but if some day he returns to it, if he has left any\r\n  property in it, he ought to enjoy there to the full the rights of\r\n  man; he has only deserved to lose those of a citizen.”\r\n\r\n  “But here a first question presents itself. Is this citizen by his\r\n  sole renunciation released from every obligation towards the body\r\n  politic which he abandons? Does the society from which he separates\r\n  himself lose immediately all its rights over him? Doubtless, not;\r\n  and I do not speak only of those sentiments which a noble and\r\n  grateful soul preserves for its country, even though it be unjust;\r\n  I speak of rigorous obligations, of those which a man cannot fail\r\n  to fulfil without becoming guilty of an offence: and I say that\r\n  there exists a time during which a man placed between his ancient\r\n  and his new country can only permit himself to express hopes as to\r\n  the differences which arise between them: a time when that one of\r\n  the two nations against which he might bear arms would have the\r\n  right to punish him as an assassin; and when the man who might\r\n  employ his riches or talents against his former countrymen, would\r\n  really be a traitor.”\r\n\r\n  “I will add that each nation has also the right to fix the time\r\n  after which the citizen who abandons it is to be considered as free\r\n  from all obligation, and to determine what are his duties until\r\n  the expiration of that period, and what actions it still preserves\r\n  the power to forbid him. To deny this principle, would be to break\r\n  all the social bonds which can bind men together. This period,\r\n  doubtless, is not an arbitrary one; it is that during which the\r\n  citizen who abdicates can employ against his country the means\r\n  which he has received from it, and during which he can do it more\r\n  injury than could a foreigner.”\r\n\r\nFurther on, Condorcet proposes two years as the period during which\r\na citizen who renounces his nationality shall engage not to enter\r\nthe service of any foreign power, unless he has been authorised so\r\nto do by a decree of the national assembly. He also proposes various\r\nmeasures for different classes of emigrants, and the full enjoyment of\r\ntheir property on the same footing as foreigners, by those who sign an\r\nengagement not to take foreign service for two years, nor during that\r\ntime to solicit the aid of any foreign power against the nation or its\r\nconstituted authorities.\r\n\r\nMagellan fully satisfied the conditions specified by Vattel, as\r\nmay be seen by his conversations with Sebastian Alvarez, the King\r\nof Portugal’s agent: at this date, also, it is sufficiently clear\r\nthat Magellan not only did no harm to his native country, but that\r\nhe increased its renown by his own services, and by those of the\r\nother Portuguese officers whom he associated with his labours. If his\r\ncountrymen have preferred Gama to him, it is because he only served\r\nthe interests of science, whilst Gama served the passions of his\r\ncountrymen, and aided them to enrich themselves.

Manuel had\r\nrefused employment and advancement to Magellan, and seemed inclined\r\nto leave him in the obscurity of a small garrison in Africa, the\r\nPortuguese would seem to have no more right to complain of Magellan’s\r\nprofiting by the opportunities offered by Spain, than the Genoese would\r\nhave had, if they had reproached Columbus for availing himself in a\r\nsimilar way of the resources of that country. D. Manuel, it is true,\r\nmade offers to Magellan if he would leave Spain and return to Portugal,\r\nbut it was then too late, for the great navigator had already pledged\r\nhis word to Charles V.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which justifies Magellan still more\r\nthan if he had been an Englishman or a Frenchman, a circumstance\r\npeculiar to Spain and Portugal. In the Peninsula, the kingly power was\r\nof recent origin, and had been divided amongst several crowns: the\r\nwearers of these crowns had been at first only the equals of other\r\ngreat lords, and, after they had acquired these crowns, they were only\r\nthe first amongst their equals; and such they recognised themselves to\r\nbe by their coronation oaths, even long after the time of Magellan.\r\nIn these coronation oaths they also bound themselves more than did\r\nother European sovereigns to respect all the privileges of the great\r\nnobles; any infraction of which was held to justify these in revolt\r\nfrom the sovereign. At the same time there existed the custom and\r\ntradition of disnaturalisation, in accordance with which any noble\r\nwho felt aggrieved, formally renounced his fealty to the sovereign,\r\nand betook himself to some neighbouring state. Osorio and Mariana,\r\nwho wrote when the kingly power had become consolidated, ridicule\r\nthis custom; but it must have had the advantage of giving time and\r\nopportunity for a peaceable settlement instead of an immediate recourse\r\nto arms. But whether the custom was good or bad, there is no doubt\r\nthat it was generally and constantly acted upon; and Magellan was\r\nfollowing precedents that were generally received in the Peninsula.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the document mentioned by historians, by which\r\nMagellan formally renounced fealty to D. Manuel, is not forthcoming in\r\nthe archives either of Spain or Portugal; but it may be supposed to be\r\nsimilar in substance to those renunciations which Osorio mentions and\r\nreproves.\r\n\r\nAmong those who disnaturalised themselves may be cited various Condes\r\nde Haro of Biscay, and Guzman, who gave his services to Marocco,\r\nand who bears the title of El Bueno. With regard to Count Diego de\r\nHaro, who in 1216 withdrew from Castile to Navarre, Mariana makes the\r\nfollowing observations.\r\n\r\n  “Several great lords of Castile, irritated against their king,\r\n  whose avarice they could not endure, had passed into the kingdoms\r\n  of Navarre and Aragon, after having renounced their right of\r\n  naturalisation by a public deed, a means formerly in use amongst\r\n  those nations, in order not to be regarded as traitors and rebels\r\n  when they quitted the states of their sovereign.... Among the\r\n  grandees who came to take refuge in Navarre, the most illustrious\r\n  beyond dispute was Don Diego de Haro. This lord had excellent\r\n  qualities: never were seen greater constancy, probity, or zeal for\r\n  the public service than his; the slightest injustice irritated him.\r\n  It was in order not to see his country and freedom oppressed, that\r\n  he abandoned Castile.”—_Mariana, History of Spain_, book XIII.\r\n\r\n   “In the year 1276, Alfonso the Wise had defeated Yussuf, the\r\n  Emperor of Marocco, and made peace with him with the assistance of\r\n  Guzman: a tournament was held in Seville in celebration of it, and\r\n  King Alfonso having asked who had most distinguished himself, was\r\n  told D. Alonzo Perez. He asked which of them, and D. Juan Ramirez\r\n  de Guzman replied: ‘Alonzo Perez de Guzman, my brother of profit.’\r\n  This answer seemed ill to all, and especially to Guzman, who saw\r\n  that a slur was cast upon the illegitimacy of his birth, for at\r\n  that time they named children of profit (_gananciu_), those who\r\n  were born of unmarried women, and his mother had not been married.\r\n  Guzman, irritated at being thus spoken of before the king and the\r\n  court, then said: ‘You speak truth, I am a brother of profit, but\r\n  you are and will be one of loss; and were it not for the respect\r\n  due to the presence in which we stand, I would teach you the manner\r\n  in which you should treat me; but you are not to blame for it,\r\n  but rather he who has brought you up and taught you so ill.’ The\r\n  king, against whom this complaint appeared to be directed, then\r\n  said: ‘Your brother does not speak ill, for so it is the custom\r\n  in Castile to name those who are not children of women married\r\n  to their husbands.’ ‘So also,’ he replied, ‘is it the custom of\r\n  the nobles of Castile, when they are not well treated by their\r\n  sovereigns, to go abroad to seek those who will treat them well; I\r\n  will do likewise; and I swear not to return until with truth they\r\n  may call me a man of profit. Grant me, therefore, the term which\r\n  the privilege of the nobles of Castile gives, that I may go out of\r\n  the kingdom, for from this day I disnaturalise myself, and take\r\n  leave of being your vassal.’ The king attempted to dissuade him,\r\n  but his efforts being in vain, he had to grant him the term which\r\n  he asked for; during which Guzman sold all that he had inherited\r\n  from his father or acquired in the war, and went out from Castile,\r\n  accompanied by thirty of his friends and servants.”—Quintana,\r\n  _Vidas de Españoles Celebres_.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some inconsistency on the part of those who refuse\r\nto admit of disnaturalisation, yet at the same time maintain that\r\nrebellion can be justified. If there is a justification of rebellion,\r\nthe right of expatriation, or of withdrawal from amongst those\r\nwho provoke rebellion, must exist; and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe peaceable withdrawal of those who are oppressed or injured is\r\npreferable in the interests of all to armed insurrection. Even Bishop\r\nOsorio and Mariana would probably admit that the disnaturalisation of\r\nPrim and Serrano would have been better than their treason, which has\r\nplunged Spain in anarchy and bloodshed for so many years.[3] Rebellions\r\nhave almost always been conducted by minorities; and as their\r\njustification does not depend upon the numerical importance of those\r\nengaged in them, it would follow that in the case of disnaturalisation,\r\nwhere numbers are not requisite, as in the case of armed insurrection,\r\nthe right would exist equally even if the minority consisted only of\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere are some writers on the Law of Nations, with whom I am agreed\r\nin general, who disapprove of the Naturalisation and Disnaturalisation\r\nAct of the Session of 1869. I am compelled to differ from them with\r\nrespect to that measure, for the foregoing reasons, and also because\r\nit seems to me that they have lost sight of another circumstance\r\nwhich affects the question. So long as kingly power was a reality,\r\npersonal allegiance and duty to the sovereign was a reality also.\r\nBut now that modern innovation and corruption have substituted the\r\nrule of majorities for the kingly power, the feeling of the personal\r\nduty of the subject is almost lost; and the subject, or citizen, has\r\nbecome only one of an aggregation of individuals, or of an association\r\nof persons with equal rights; and each member of such an association\r\nhas clearly the right to choose whether he will form part of it or\r\nnot: so that whatever rights of expatriation may have existed in the\r\ntimes of Magellan, Grotius, and Vattel, have become much stronger at\r\nthe present time, when the conscience of the subject is no longer\r\nconsidered by some as held bound by duty to the sovereign, who has\r\nbecome almost impersonal: instead of loyalty and fealty, we have the\r\nduty of fair dealing as between partners and associates on equal terms,\r\nas is exemplified by the argumentation of Condorcet in the passage\r\nquoted above. That this view is in accordance with the common sense\r\nand consent of mankind is shown by the general repudiation of the\r\npretension of the northern portion of the United States to term the\r\nsecession of the southern states a rebellion; and this pretension was\r\nseen to be especially illogical on the part of those who had repudiated\r\nthe name of rebels when they departed from the duty of obedience to\r\ntheir lawful sovereign.\r\n\r\nMagellan has not had the good fortune of Vasco da Gama, whose exploits\r\nhave been narrated by Camoens and Gaspar Correa; he did not survive\r\nto give his own account of his great voyage, and the only accounts\r\npreserved were written by two Italians of very small literary capacity.\r\nThere are, however, more documents concerning Magellan in existence\r\nthan are to be found with respect to Gama.\r\n\r\nThe birth-place of Magellan is doubtful; according to his will\r\nexecuted in Lisbon, December 29th, 1504, in favour of his sister,\r\nTheresa de Magalhāes, wife of Joan da Sylva Telles, he was born at\r\nVilla de Sabroza, in the district of Villa Real, Traz os Montes; in\r\nhis will of August 24th, 1519, he calls himself “Vezino de Porto,” or\r\ndomiciled at Porto; documents quoted by M. Ferdinand Denis make him to\r\nbe born at Villa de Figueiro in Portuguese Estremadura. His family was\r\n“hidalgo,” with a known coat of arms, of which a plate is given in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThe book of noble genealogies of Portugal, by Bernardo Pimenta do\r\nAvelar Portocarrero, states, in the vol. M, done and copied in the year\r\n1721, fo. 641, that Ruy de Magalhaēs, whose parents are unknown, was\r\nAlcaide-mōr of Aveiro. He married Alda de Mesquita, daughter of Martin\r\nGonzalves Pimentel and Ignez de Mesquita. Antonio de Lima (another\r\ngenealogist) represents her as the wife of Gil de Magalhaēs, fifth son\r\nof Gil de Magalhaēs; and he gives her the same children as others give\r\nto Ruy de Magalhaēs: who had\r\n\r\nGenebra de Magalhaēs, wife of Pero Cāo.\r\n\r\nFernāo de Magalhaēs, who married Da. Brites Barbosa, daughter of his\r\nrelation Diogo Barbosa, alcaidemōr of Seville, in the absence of D.\r\nAlvaro of Portugal; he had\r\n\r\nDa. Anna de Magalhaēs, his heiress, the wife of D. Hernando de Henao e\r\nAvila, from whom his lineage continues. She was his only child.\r\n\r\nThis does not agree with the archives of Seville, from which it appears\r\nthat Beatriz Barbosa was daughter of Diego Barbosa and Maria Caldera,\r\nand that Fernan Magalhaēs and Beatriz Barbosa had a son named Rodrigo;\r\nand that after the death of these three, Diego Barbosa became their\r\nheir; and he having died in 1525, his son Jayme inherited.\r\n\r\nFernan Magellan executed a will in Seville on the 24th day of August,\r\n1519. He instituted by it a mayorazgo for his son, grandson, or\r\nrelation, who should bear the name of Magallanes, and who should be\r\nbound to live in the kingdoms of Castille. He also bequeathed a sum of\r\n12,500 maravedis to the Convent of N. S. de la Victoria in Triana.\r\n\r\nTwo facsimiles of the signature of Magellan are given, one taken from\r\nhis signature to the protocol of the Council of War, held at Cochim in\r\n1510; there is also a facsimile of the signature of another Magellan,\r\ntaken from the book of Moradias or Palace stipends, attached to a\r\nreceipt printed by Navarrete, who appears to have supposed it to\r\nhave been that of the navigator: and a facsimile of the signature of\r\nMagellan’s brother-in-law Duarte Barbosa.\r\n\r\nGaspar Correa states, in his _Lendas da India_, tom. II, p. 28, that,\r\nin January of 1510, Alfonso d’Alboquerque despatched the ships from\r\nCochim to the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  “Two ships of Bastian de Sousa and Francisco de Sá convoyed this\r\n  fleet, and at night they both struck on the shoals of Padua, which\r\n  are opposite the Maldive Islands, and remained aground, upright,\r\n  and without breaking up. Upon this they prepared the boats as\r\n  well as they could, and raised their sides, and put inside water\r\n  and biscuit, and victuals which did not require cooking. The\r\n  captains and pilots, and as many men as could, got into these\r\n  boats and returned to Cochym. The people who remained in the ships\r\n  set shores[4] on each side of the ships, with the yards, which\r\n  they cut. All this was arranged and commanded by an honourable\r\n  gentleman, who remained as overseer, named Fernan de Magalhaēs,\r\n  who had been much wounded in Calecut. He took much care that the\r\n  chests should not be broken, and that there should be no robbery,\r\n  because the captains were going to request ships of the governor,\r\n  with which to return to the ships to save what goods had not been\r\n  wetted. These captains reached Cananor in eight days, from whence\r\n  they sent a message to the governor, who at once sent Gonzalo de\r\n  Crasto in a caravel, with two pilots; and they went to the ships\r\n  and put the best things on board the caravel, until they could not\r\n  load it any more, and having recovered all the men, they set fire\r\n  to the ships, as they were already full of water. So they returned\r\n  to Cochim. In this Fernan de Magalhāes worked hard, and did much\r\n  service, and attended well to everything.”\r\n\r\n  “This Fernan de Magalhāes was of the king’s household, and came to\r\n  India with the Viceroy Dom Francisco [d’Almeida], and he was in\r\n  the action with the Turks; and he was always much wounded in the\r\n  fleets and in Calecut; and in these ships he lost his small portion\r\n  of property,[5] and he went away poor to Portugal, and went about\r\n  with claims for his services, and begged of the king a hundred reis\r\n  increase of his palace stipend,[6] which the king did not choose to\r\n  grant, at which he was aggrieved, and went to Castile to live at\r\n  Seville, where he married. As he had much knowledge of the art of\r\n  navigation, and enterprise, and devoted himself to that, he came\r\n  to an understanding with the directors of the House of Trade of\r\n  Seville, so that the emperor gave him a fleet of five ships, with\r\n  which he navigated, discovering a new way to Maluco, which was in\r\n  the year 1519, as I will relate further on in its place; with which\r\n  he caused great difficulties to Portugal.”\r\n\r\nCorrea again refers to the incident of Magellan remaining with the\r\nwreck, in his tome II, p. 625, where he says:\r\n\r\n  “Fernan de Magalhāes, an honourable gentleman, who served in\r\n  these parts in the time of the Viceroy Afonso d’Alboquerque, of\r\n  whom I made mention in the first book, with respect to two ships\r\n  which were going to the kingdom, which were lost on the shoals\r\n  of Padua, and their captains went back to Cochym in their boats,\r\n  and this Fernan de Magalhāes remained in the ships with the men\r\n  taking care of the ships until caravels came from Cochim in which\r\n  much property, belonging to the king and to private individuals,\r\n  was saved. This Fernan de Magalhāes, on going to the kingdom and\r\n  bringing before the king his services, asked in satisfaction for\r\n  them that he should have an increase in his palace stipend of a\r\n  hundred reis a month, which the king refused him, because he did\r\n  not find favour with him, or because it was so permitted to be.\r\n  Fernan de Magalhāes, offended at this, because he much entreated\r\n  the king to do it, and he would not, asked his leave to go and live\r\n  with whoever would show him favour, where he might obtain more good\r\n  fortune than with him. The king told him to do as he pleased; for\r\n  which he wished to kiss his hand, which the king did not choose to\r\n  give him.”\r\n\r\nCastanheda, in relating the wreck on the Padua banks, says (lib. III,\r\ncap. v):\r\n\r\n  “There were disputes as to who should go away with the captains\r\n  from the grounded vessels, and Magellan said that it was clear\r\n  that all could not go away, and that to avoid strife, which was\r\n  commencing, let the gentlemen and chief men go away with the\r\n  captains, and he would remain with the sailors and other common\r\n  people, provided they would promise to return for him, or get\r\n  the governor to send for him. This they swore to, and Fernan de\r\n  Magalhāes stayed behind, the common people consented to remain,\r\n  for otherwise there must have been strife. As Magalhāes was in\r\n  the boat, when it was nearly ready to go away, a sailor, thinking\r\n  that he repented himself of remaining, said to him: ‘Sir, did you\r\n  not promise to remain with us?’ He replied: ‘Yes; and see, I am\r\n  coming;’ and went to them and remained with them. In this he shewed\r\n  great courage, and confidence in the men.”\r\nBarros relates the incident of the two vessels wrecked on the banks of\r\nPadua, and says that Antonio Pacheco was sent with a caravel to their\r\nassistance; and that:\r\n\r\n  “As much honour as Antonio Pacheco gained in the method with which\r\n  he recovered these crews, with the differences which he had with\r\n  them on account of some goods which the men took with them, so much\r\n  honour also did Magellan gain by the good management of these men,\r\n  which he shewed whilst waiting with them till they came to fetch\r\n  them. And if he had had as much loyalty to his king and country,\r\n  as he observed with a friend of his, on whose account he would\r\n  not go away in company with Bastian de Sousa [the captain]; for\r\n  they did not take away the other man, as he was not a man of much\r\n  importance, perchance he would not have lost himself with a name of\r\n  infamy, as will be seen further on.”—_Decad._ II, lib. IV, chap.\r\n  i.\r\n\r\nThus Castanheda and Barros, who are both of them very hostile to\r\nMagellan, have preserved one of the finest traits of his life. Whether\r\nthe motive of Magellan in remaining by the wreck was fidelity to the\r\ninterests of his friend, or devotion to the common seamen, or the\r\nrepugnance of an officer and a gentleman to abandon a ship which had\r\nnot broken up, this trait is alone sufficient to show that he was\r\nincapable of disloyalty, or of being influenced by pique, as the\r\nPortuguese historians have represented.\r\n\r\nThe next mention we find of Magellan is in the following document,\r\npreserved in the archives of Lisbon, which contains an account of a\r\nCouncil of War held by Albuquerque respecting his attack on Goa. This\r\ndocument confirms what Correa says of Albuquerque’s departure from\r\nCochym for Goa.\r\n\r\n_Council held by Alfonso d’Albuquerque with the Captains with respect\r\nto going to Goa._\r\n\r\nTorre do Tombo. Corpo Chron. Part 2_a_, Maç 23, Doc. 190.\r\n\r\n  Thursday, which was the tenth day of the month of October, of five\r\n  hundred and ten, the captain-major ordered all the captains of the\r\n  king our sovereign to be summoned in Cochim, in order to hold a\r\n  council with them, to which council there came those named below,\r\n  and no others. This council was as to whether, whilst the ships of\r\n  burden remained in Cochim taking in their cargo, it seemed good to\r\n  them to carry all their crews with them to the action of Goa, or\r\n  not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFernan de Magalhāes said that it seemed to him that the captain-major\r\nought not to take the ships of burden to Goa, inasmuch as if they went\r\nthither they could not pass this year to Portugal, since we are at the\r\ntwelfth of October; and that, making their shortest course without\r\ntouching at Cananor, nor at any other port, it was not possible to lay\r\nthe fleet before the port of Goa before the eighth of November,* as\r\nthe winds were now contrary for that place: and with respect to the\r\ncrews, let his worship say whether it was well that they should go,\r\nthat it seemed to him that he ought not to take them, since there did\r\nnot remain time for them to lay out their money, nor to do anything of\r\nwhat was necessary for the voyage; and this said Fernan de Magalhāes.\r\n\r\nThe following gave an opinion:\r\n\r\n   Nuno Vaz, captain of the Rumesa.\r\n   Antonio da Costa ... Rei Pequeno.\r\n   Duarte da Silva ... Galé Grande.\r\n  *Simāo Martins.\r\n  *D. Joāo de Lima ... Sta. Maria d’Ajuda.\r\n  *Sebastian de Miranda ... Galé Pequeno.\r\n   Fernan de Magalhāes.[8]\r\n   Jeronimo Teixeira ... Sta. Maria do Campo.\r\n  *Jorge da Silveira.\r\n   Francisco de Sousa ... Boa Ventura.\r\n  *Manuel da Cunha.\r\n  *Garcia de Sousa ... Sta. Clara.\r\n   Francisco Corvinel ... Sant-Iago.\r\n   Lourenço de Paiva.\r\n   Antonio Real, alcaìde-mór and captain of Cochim.\r\n   Gonzalo de Sequeira, captain-major of the fleet which had just come\r\n       from Portugal.\r\n   Affonso d’Albuquerque said at the end what he determined to do.\r\n\r\n(N.B. Albuquerque said at the end of these opinions that he was\r\ndetermined to sail on the following day, the eleventh of October, with\r\nthe captains who wished to accompany him. Therefore, _we are at the\r\ntwelfth of October_, means that that day was close at hand, and not\r\nthat the council was held on that day.)\r\n\r\nGaspar Correa says, tome II, p. 138:\r\n\r\n  “When this was thus ended, the governor told all the captains that\r\n  he was going immediately, and that he would sail from Cananor with\r\n  all the ships and men that he could take, and go and take Goa, as\r\n  he trusted in the Lord’s Passion that He would assist him; and he\r\n  gave them notice that so he would act, and not occupy himself with\r\n  anything else: and he gave them all this notice, because he trusted\r\n  in the Lord, that he should be able to send news to the king in\r\n  these ships, that he was taking his rest inside the city of Goa:\r\n  and, as it was already October, whoever had the will to serve the\r\n  king, and win such great honour, as it would be to find oneself\r\n  in such a noble action, would still have time enough to witness\r\n  the action and return to embark in his ship, carrying away so much\r\n  honour from having been present in the action: and each one was to\r\n  act according to his own will, for he would give an account of all\r\n  to the king in his letters. But the captains, occupied with their\r\n  profits of selling and taking in cargo, set little store by this,\r\n  and the governor departed, saying that he was not going to take\r\n  anyone away with him against his will.”\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque then went to Cananor, which G. Correa says he again left\r\non the 3rd October for Goa (tom. II, p. 140); _tres_ is probably an\r\nerror for _treze_, the 13th, which would be in accordance with the\r\nstatement of the document that Albuquerque sailed from Cochim on the\r\n11th of October. Gaspar Correa gives the following names of captains\r\nwho accompanied Albuquerque against Goa.\r\n\r\n  *Joan de Lima.\r\n   Jeronymo de Lima, his brother.\r\n   Manuel de Lacerda.\r\n   Fernan Peres d’Andrade.\r\n   Simāo d’Andrade, his brother.\r\n   Diogo Fernandes de Beja.\r\n  *Manuel da Cunha.\r\n   Duarte de Mello.\r\n   Francisco de Tavora.\r\n   Vasco Fernandes Coutinho.\r\n  *Gracia de Sousa.\r\n   Gaspar Cāo.\r\n   Lopo Vaz de Sampayo.\r\n   Ayres da Silva.\r\n   Diniz Fernandes de Mello.\r\n   Joan Serrano.\r\n   Diogo Mendes de Vascogoncellos.\r\n   Pero Coresma.\r\n   Baltesar da Silva.\r\n   Mice Vinete Cerniche.\r\n   Antonio Raposo.\r\n  *Simāo Martins.\r\n   Gaspar de Paiva.\r\n   Francisco Pantoja.\r\n  *Bastian de Miranda, d’Azevedo.\r\n   Afonso Pessoa.\r\n   Jorge Martins de Liāo.\r\n   Francisco Pereira.\r\n            Twenty-eight ships, and 1,700 Portuguese.\r\n\r\n  * The names marked with an asterisk are among those who gave an\r\n    opinion at the Council of War above mentioned.\r\n\r\nHe also mentions, p. 145, the following gentlemen as being with\r\nAlbuquerque in the attack on Goa:\r\n\r\n   Fernan Gomez de Lemos.\r\n   Nuno Vaz de Castello Branco.\r\n  *Jorge da Silveira.\r\n   Ruy de Brito.\r\n   Luis Coutinho, brother of Vasco Fernandes.\r\n   Simāo d’Andrade, brother of Fernan Peres.\r\n   Gonzalo d’Almeida.\r\n   Simāo Martins Henriques.\r\n   Payo Rodrigues de Sousa.\r\n   Diogo Pires de Miranda.\r\n   Duarte de Mello.\r\n   Alvaro Paçanha.\r\n   Luis Preto.\r\n   Pero d’Afonsequa.\r\n   Antonio de Matos.\r\n   Antonio Diniz.\r\n       And other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe supposition may be hazarded that it was this opinion which Magellan\r\ngave at the Council of War in opposition to Alfonso d’Albuquerque,\r\nwhich set D. Manuel against him. Such opposition was enough to have\r\nmade Albuquerque write unfavourably of Magellan to D. Manuel; and the\r\nill-will of D. Manuel to Magellan, and his refusal to grant him a due\r\nrecognition of his services is not otherwise sufficiently accounted\r\nfor. On the other hand, Gaspar Correa, who was Albuquerque’s secretary\r\nat one time, does not indicate this; but Correa is the most friendly to\r\nMagellan of all the Portuguese historians, and does not appear, like\r\nthe others, to have taxed Magellan with treason.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Magellan appears to have left India, and to have been\r\nstationed at Azamor in Morocco, where, in a skirmish with the Arabs,\r\nhe was wounded in the leg by a javelin, which left him somewhat lame.\r\nAfter that, some disputes arose as to the distribution amongst the\r\ntownsmen of some cattle that had been captured from the Arabs. When\r\nJoão Soarez, Captain of Azamor, left that place, and was succeeded by\r\nD. Pedro de Sousa, Magellan left Azamor without leave from D. Pedro de\r\nSousa, and came to Portugal; his petition with regard to the increase\r\nof his palace stipend had already been sent to D. Manuel; but D. Pedro\r\nde Sousa having written to the king of Magellan having left Azamor\r\nwithout leave of absence, and of the complaints made about the cattle,\r\nthe king refused to receive Magellan, and commanded him to return at\r\nonce to Azamor, and there give himself up as he was accused. When he\r\narrived there, as Barros says, either because he was free from blame,\r\nor, as was mostly asserted, because the frontier officers of Azamor,\r\nin order not to vex him, would not accuse him, he received a sentence\r\nof acquittal, and returned with it to Portugal; but the king always\r\nbore ill-will to him, and, Magellan’s requests not being granted, he\r\nset about that business of which he had written to his friend Francisco\r\nSerrano, who was in Maluco.\r\n\r\nAfter Magellan had disnaturalised himself, he took refuge in Spain,\r\naccompanied by the astrologer Ruy Faleiro, and having arrived at\r\nSeville on the 20th of October, 1517, he entered upon negotiations with\r\nthe ministers of Charles V; and the King of Portugal did his utmost,\r\nthrough his agents, to thwart him; Osorio says that the king would\r\nhave succeeded in dissuading Charles V from employing Magellan, had\r\nnot the Spanish nobles persuaded him not to lose such an opportunity\r\nof increasing the Spanish empire. Charles V then ordered ships to be\r\nprovided for Magellan, by which he might discover a new way to the east.\r\n\r\nHere follows an abstract of documents, copies of which are contained\r\nin the Torre do Tombo, relating to the appointment of Magellan, and the\r\nprivileges and powers conferred upon him: these documents are dated in\r\nthe spring of 1518, more than a year before Magellan sailed; and it\r\nappears that delay was caused partly through the procrastination of\r\nthe Spanish authorities in Seville, who were charged with equipping\r\nthe fleet, and partly by the intrigues of the agents of the King of\r\nPortugal. These intrigues appear to have been partially successful, and\r\nto have caused delay. A final order for the departure of Magellan was\r\ngiven in Barcelona, April 19th, 1519. The original of this document\r\nis preserved in the Lisbon archives, and it was probably carried out\r\nwith the fleet, and fell into the possession of the Portuguese in the\r\nMoluccas after Magellan’s death; a translation of this order is given\r\nbelow, and the text is in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nAfter this document, translations are given of two letters (the text\r\nof which is given in the Appendix) from Alvaro da Costa, the Portuguese\r\nambassador in Spain, and from Sebastian Alvarez, the Portuguese factor,\r\nabout the efforts made by them to prevent Magellan’s expedition. M.\r\nFerdinand Denis, in the _Biographie Universelle_, mentions that Alvaro\r\nda Costa is said to have pushed his zeal to the extremity of wishing to\r\nassassinate Magellan, and even his poor associate, Ruy Faleiro; this,\r\nwith regard to the latter, seems hardly probable, judging from Costa’s\r\nown letter. Navarrete states that the Portuguese agents succeeding in\r\nexciting the mob of Seville against Magellan on the 22nd of October,\r\n1518, under the empty pretext that he was substituting the arms of\r\nPortugal for those of Castile in his ships. Faria y Sousa, in his\r\n_Europa Portuguese_, tom. II, pt. IV, cap. I, p. 543, says:\r\n\r\n  “D. Fernando de Vasconcellos, Bishop of Lamego, alone expressed\r\n  the desire that the King of Portugal should either grant favours\r\n  to him (Magellan) or else have him killed, because his intentions\r\n  were most dangerous to the kingdom. The result of this (counsel)\r\n  was that the kingdom received a great disappointment, and Magellan\r\n  glorious and everlasting fame; since, whilst the world endures it\r\n  will endure in the monument of his name, which has remained applied\r\n  to all the South Sea and to his Straits.”\r\n\r\n  Que nunca se vera tāo forte peito,\r\n  Do Gangetico mar ao Gaditano;\r\n  Nem das Boreaes ondas ao Estreito,\r\n  Que mostrou o aggravado Lusitano.\r\n\r\n                             _Camoens_, Canto II, 55.\r\n\r\n  And never will their prowess find its mate,\r\n  No, not from Ganges to the Gadite shore,\r\n  Not from Arcturus to the Southern Strait\r\n  Which first an injured Lusian will explore.\r\n\r\n                                           _Quillinan._\r\n\r\n    Eis aqui as nóvas portas do Oriente,\r\n  Que vosoutros agora ao mundo dais,\r\n  Abrindo a porta ao vasto mar patente,\r\n  Que com tam forte peito navegais:\r\n  Mas he tambem razaō, que no ponente\r\n  De hum Lusitano hum feito inda vejais,\r\n  Que de seu Rey monstrandose agravado,\r\n  Caminho ha de fazer nunqua cuidado.\r\n\r\n                             _Camoens_, Canto X, 138.\r\n\r\n  Thus hast thou all the regions of the East,\r\n  Which by thee giv’n unto the world is now:\r\n  Opening a way with an undaunted breast,\r\n  Through that vast sea which none before did plough.\r\n  But it is likewise reason, in the West\r\n  That of a Lusian too one action thou\r\n      Shouldst understand, who (angry with his king)\r\n      Achieves a great and memorable thing.\r\n\r\n                                             _Fanshaw._\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Contract and Agreement made by the King of Castile with\r\n        Fernan Magellan for the discovery which he was to make,\r\n      a copy of which he carried with him, signed by the Officers\r\n           of the King of Castile, and made by his Secretary\r\n          Fernan de los Cobos, and copied word for word._[9]\r\n\r\n                       Gav. 18, Maço 10, No. 4.\r\n\r\n  Certificate given in Seville that the commendador Fernan de\r\n  Magallanes, and the bachelor Ruy Faleiro, Portuguese, presented\r\n  themselves at the Audiencia on the fourth of May, of 1518, before\r\n  Dr. Sancho de Matienzo, the contador Juan Lopez de Ricalde, and\r\n  the factor Juan de Aranda, judges and fiscals of their Highnesses,\r\n  of the India House, residing in this city, in the presence of Juan\r\n  Gutierrez Calderon, clerk of their H.H., and his Notary public, on\r\n  behalf of Diego de Porras, chief clerk in civil and criminal causes\r\n  of the said India House; and they presented to the judges two\r\n  capitulations written on paper and signed by his Highness, and one\r\n  sealed with a seal of coloured wax at the back and other necessary\r\n  signatures, and two royal orders (_cedulas_) of H.H. signed with\r\n  his royal name, all written by the secretary Fernan de los Cobos,\r\n  the tenour of all which, one after another, is as follows.\r\n\r\n  The King:\r\n\r\n  “Since you, Fernando de Magallanes, a knight, native of the Kingdom\r\n  of Portugal, and the bachelor Ruy Faleiro, also a native of that\r\n  kingdom, wish to render us a great service in the limits which\r\n  belong to us in the ocean within the bounds of our demarcation, we\r\n  order the following capitulation to be established with you for\r\n  that purpose.”\r\n\r\n   “Firstly: That you are to go with good luck to discover the\r\n  part of the ocean within our limits and demarcation, and because\r\n  it would not be in reason that, while you go to do the above\r\n  mentioned, that other persons should cross you to do the same, and\r\n  taking into consideration that you undertake the labour of this\r\n  enterprise, it is my favour and will, and I promise that for the\r\n  first ten following years we will not give leave to any person to\r\n  go and discover by the same road and course by which you shall go;\r\n  and if anyone desire to undertake it and should ask our leave for\r\n  it, before giving it, we will let you know of it in order that if\r\n  you should be ready to make it in that time in which they offer,\r\n  you should do so, providing an equal sufficiency and equipment,\r\n  and as many ships as the other persons who may wish to make the\r\n  said discovery: but, be it understood that, if we please to send\r\n  to discover, or to give leave for it to such other persons as we\r\n  please by way of the south-west in the parts of the islands and\r\n  mainland, and all other parts which are discovered towards the\r\n  part where they are to seek the strait of those seas (para buscar\r\n  el estrecho de aquellas mares),[10] we may order it to be done, or\r\n  give leave to other persons to do it, both of the mainland by the\r\n  South Sea, which is discovered, or from the island of S. Miguel, if\r\n  they wish to go and discover, they may do so. Also, if the governor\r\n  and people who are now, by our orders, or may in future be in the\r\n  said mainland, or other of our subjects may wish to discover in\r\n  the South Sea, they may do so, notwithstanding the above, or any\r\n  section or clause of this capitulation. Also, you may discover in\r\n  any of those parts what has not yet been discovered, so that you do\r\n  not discover nor do anything in the demarcation and limits of the\r\n  most serene King of Portugal, my very dear and well-beloved uncle\r\n  and brother, nor to his prejudice, but only within the limits of\r\n  our demarcation.”\r\n\r\n   In consideration of their good-will and services, the next\r\n  paragraph grants the right to levy upon any isles or countries\r\n  settled by them after the expenses have been paid, a twentieth\r\n  part, with the title of our Adelantados and Governors of the\r\n  said countries and isles, “you, and your sons and rightful heirs\r\n  for ever, so that they remain for us and the kings that may come\r\n  after us, and your sons and heirs being natives of our realms and\r\n  married in them; and of this we will send you your formal letter of\r\n  privileges.”\r\n\r\n  The next paragraph grants the right to invest in goods each year\r\n  the value of a thousand ducats, cost price, to sell in the islands\r\n  and countries, and bring back the returns, paying only a twentieth\r\n  in duty to the king without other payment. This only after the\r\n  return from the voyage, not during it.\r\n\r\n  Also to grant them greater favour, if more than six islands should\r\n  be discovered; after six have been set apart for the king, they\r\n  might mark out two from which they might take the fifteenth part of\r\n  all the net profits and duties of the king after the expenses had\r\n  been deducted.\r\n\r\n  Also of all the net profit that there may be for the king on\r\n  the return of the fleet, after this first voyage, deducting its\r\n  expense, they may take a fifth part.\r\n\r\n  “In order that you may better carry this out, I will order the\r\n  equipment of five ships, two of one hundred and thirty tons each,\r\n  and two others of ninety, and another of sixty tons, provided\r\n  with men, victuals, and artillery; that is to say, that the said\r\n  ships shall be supplied for two years, and there shall go in them\r\n  two hundred and thirty-four persons for their management: amongst\r\n  masters, mariners, ship-boys, and all other people that are of\r\n  necessity, according to the memorial, and this we will order to be\r\n  carried out by our officers in Seville.”\r\n\r\n  Also if either of them died, this agreement was to be kept with,\r\n  and by the other, as it would have been kept with both if they were\r\n  alive.\r\n\r\n   The next paragraph says that a factor, a treasurer, an\r\n  accountant, and clerks of the said ships, shall keep the accounts\r\n  of all the expenses of the fleet.\r\n\r\n  “All which I promise and plight my faith and royal word that I will\r\n  order it to be observed to you, in all and for all, according as\r\n  is contained above, and upon it I have ordered this present to be\r\n  given, signed with my name. Dated in Valladolid, the twenty-second\r\n  day of March, of five hundred and eighteen years.”\r\n\r\n                                “Yo el Rey.\r\n                                        By order of the King,\r\n                                           +Francisco de los Cobos+.”\r\n\r\nAnother copy of the same document has the heading:—\r\n\r\n  Doña Juana and Don Carlos, her son, by the grace of God, Queen and\r\n  King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, the two Sicilies, and Jerusalem,\r\n  of Navarra, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, the Mallorcas,\r\n  Seville, Sardinia, Cordova, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, the Algarves,\r\n  of Aljazira, Gibraltar, of the Canary Isles, of the Indies, isles\r\n  and mainland of the Ocean-sea, Counts of Barcelona, Lords of Biscay\r\n  and Molina, Dukes of Athens and Neopatria, Counts of Roussillon and\r\n  Cerdaña, Marquises of Euristan and Gociano, Archdukes of Austria,\r\n  Dukes of Bergoña and Brabant, Counts of Flanders and Tirol, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother letter, also dated Valladolid, March 22nd, 1518, and signed\r\nby the king, and the secretary Francisco de los Cobos, and signed at\r\nthe back by Joanes Beijamanse, Fonseca Archiepiscopus, Episcopus,\r\nregistered, Johan de Samana, Guillermo Chancellor, confers upon\r\nMagellan the power of deciding and executing short and summary justice\r\nby sea or land in case of suits or disputes arising in the fleet.\r\n\r\nAnother royal letter of the same date as the above orders the officers\r\nof the India House to provide Magellan with five ships, crews,\r\nprovisions, etc., according to the memorial which is signed by our\r\nchancellor of Bargonha and by the Archbishop of Rosano and Bishop of\r\nBurgos; and bids them use all dispatch.\r\n\r\nAnother royal letter, dated Aranda, 17th of April, 1518, to Magellan\r\nand Ruy Faleiro, says that if, after they shall have sailed, either\r\nor both of them should die, and that they should have given to the\r\npeople in the fleet instructions and orders which should be necessary\r\nfor the discovery; and if they, profiting by them, should discover the\r\nisles and parts which they were going to discover, then their heirs and\r\nsuccessors should enjoy the favours and privileges contained in the\r\nsaid capitulations.\r\n\r\nThe document then states that Magellan and Ruy Faleiro having presented\r\nthe capitulations and letters and royal orders of his highness to the\r\nsaid judges, they summoned and required them to fulfil them according\r\nto their contents, and they requested this in the presence of the\r\nwitnesses, Francisco de Santa Cruz, alguazil Lorenzo Pinelo, and\r\nFrancisco de Collantes, porter of the Audiencia of the said House.\r\nThen the judges took the letters in their hands, and kissed them, and\r\nput them on their heads, as the orders of their king, and natural\r\nsovereign, whom may God suffer to live and reign many years; and they\r\nwould answer more at length in complying with the orders. Witnesses the\r\nabove-named.\r\n\r\nAfter that, on Monday, at the Audiencia de la Nona, on the\r\nthirty-first day of May of 1518, the said judges, Dr. Sancho de\r\nMatienzo and the contador Juan Lopez de Ricalde, appeared before me,\r\nthe said Juan Gutierrez Calderon, the above-mentioned clerk and notary,\r\nand presented an answer signed with their names to the presentation\r\nmade by the Portuguese captains of the royal orders and letters. And\r\nthis reply is as follows.\r\n\r\nThe said judges state, in reply, that the king’s letters order them\r\nto provide five ships, and men and provisions as may be necessary, in\r\nconformity with a memorial which the captains bring, signed by the\r\ngreat Chancellor of Burgundy and by the very Reverend Archbishop of\r\nRosano and Bishop of Burgos, which said memorial up to this time has\r\nnot been shown to us, and without it we cannot undertake anything; so\r\nlet his Highness send us orders according to that the said despatch\r\nsigned, as has been said, by the chancellor and bishop; and we are\r\nready to fulfil the orders which his Highness sends, having at the time\r\nmoneys of his Highness in our power. This they said, and gave as their\r\nanswers, and signed it with their names, Doctor Matienzo, Juan Lopez de\r\nRicalde.\r\n\r\nMagellan and Ruy Faleiro asked from Juan Gutierres Calderon, Clerk and\r\nNotary Public, a certificate and legalised copy of what had passed for\r\nthe conservation of their rights, which he accordingly gave him, dated\r\non the said day and month (31st May) of 1518.\r\n\r\nThe letter, the text of which is given in the Appendix No. III,\r\nthe original of which appears to have fallen into the hands of the\r\nPortuguese at the Moluccas, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  The King:\r\n\r\n  Fernando de Magallam̄s and Ruy Faleiro, Knights of the Order of\r\n  St. James, our captains-general of the fleet, which we command to\r\n  be equipped to go to discover, and the other separate captains of\r\n  the said fleet, and pilots, masters, quarter-masters, and seamen of\r\n  the said fleet: Inasmuch as I know for certain, according to the\r\n  much information which I have obtained from persons who have seen\r\n  it by experience, that there are spices in the islands of Maluco;\r\n  and, chiefly, you are going to seek them with this said fleet, and\r\n  my will is that you should straightway follow the voyage to the\r\n  said islands in the form and guise which I have said and commanded\r\n  to you, the said Ferdinand de Magallam̄s; moreover, I command you\r\n  all and each one of you that in the navigation of the said voyage\r\n  you follow the opinion and determination of the said Ferdinand de\r\n  Magallam̄s, in order that first and foremost, before any other\r\n  part, you should go to the said islands of Maluco, without there\r\n  being any shortcoming in this, because thus it is fitting for our\r\n  service, and after this done, the rest that may be convenient may\r\n  be sought for according to what you have been commanded, and one\r\n  and all neither do nor let them do anything else in anywise, under\r\n  pain of losing their goods and their persons, at our discretion.\r\n  Done in Barcelona, nineteenth day of April, year of one thousand\r\n  five hundred and nineteen.\r\n\r\n                                 I, the King.\r\n                                        By order of the King,\r\n                                                 +Frᶜᵒ de los Covos+.\r\n\r\n  (_Docket_).—In order that those of the fleet may follow the opinion\r\n  and determination of Magallan̄s, in order that first and before\r\n  anything else they go to the spices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            +Translation.+\r\n\r\n       _Letter of Alvaro da Costa, giving an Account to the King\r\n          Dom Manuel of what passed with the King of Castile,\r\n        to dissuade him from the discovery which he determined\r\n          to order the execution of, by Fernan de Magalhaes._\r\n\r\n               Torre do Tombo. Gav. 18, Maço 8, No. 38.\r\n\r\n  Sire,\r\n\r\n   With respect to the business of Fernam de Magalhaes, I have done\r\n  and laboured very much, as God knows, as I have written to you at\r\n  length; and now, Xebres being ill, I have spoken on this matter\r\n  very firmly to the king, laying before him all the objections that\r\n  there were in it, and besides other matters, setting forth how\r\n  ill-seeming and unusual a matter it was for a king to receive the\r\n  vassals of another king his friend, against his will; which was a\r\n  thing which was not usual amongst knights, and was held to be a\r\n  great fault, and a very ill-looking thing: also that I had just\r\n  before offered to him in Valladolid the services of your royal\r\n  self, and kingdom and lordships, while he was already receiving\r\n  these men against your pleasure; and I begged him to look well\r\n  that this was not a time for causing discontent to your Highness,\r\n  especially in a matter of such little importance to him, and of\r\n  such little certainty, and that he had many vassals and men for\r\n  making discoveries when the time came, without making use of those\r\n  who came away from your Highness discontented, and that your\r\n  Highness could not fail to suspect that these men would labour\r\n  more to do you a dis-service than for anything else; and that his\r\n  Highness had now so much to do with discovering his own kingdoms\r\n  and lordships, and settling them, that such novelties ought hardly\r\n  to come into his recollection, from which scandals might follow,\r\n  and other things which might well be dispensed with. I also laid\r\n  before him how ill this appeared in the year and period of the\r\n  marriage, and increase of family duty and affection, and that it\r\n  seemed to me that your Highness would feel deeply the knowledge\r\n  that these men asked his leave to return, and that he did not give\r\n  it; which would be two evils, the receiving them against your will,\r\n  and the retaining them against their own wills: and I begged him\r\n  on account of what was fitting for his service, and for that of\r\n  your Highness that of two things he should do one, either give them\r\n  leave to go, or lay aside this business for this year, by which\r\n  much would not be lost, and such means might be taken that he might\r\n  be served without your Highness receiving displeasure from the\r\n  manner in which this should be done.\r\n\r\n  He, Sire, remained so surprised at what I said to him, that I was\r\n  amazed; and he replied to me with the best words in the world, and\r\n  that on no account did he desire that anything should be done,\r\n  by which your Highness should be displeased, and many other good\r\n  words; and he told me to speak to the Cardinal, and to relate\r\n  everything to him. I, Sire, had already talked it all well over\r\n  with the Cardinal, who is the best thing here, and this business\r\n  does not seem good to him, and he promised me to labour as much as\r\n  he could to avoid speaking to the king; and for this purpose they\r\n  summoned the Bishop of Burgos, who is the person who upholds this\r\n  business, and so two of the Council again made the king believe\r\n  that in this he was not in fault towards your Highness, because\r\n  he was not sending to make discoveries except within his limit,\r\n  and very far off from the affairs of your Highness; and that your\r\n  Highness ought not to take it ill that he made use of two of your\r\n  vassals, men of little substance, while your Highness was making\r\n  use of the services of many natives of Castile; and they alleged\r\n  many other arguments: lastly, the Cardinal told me that the Bishop\r\n  and those men used so much urgency in this, that at present the\r\n  king could not take any other determination.\r\n\r\n   As long as Xebres was well I continued to set this business\r\n  before him, as I have said, and much more. He puts the blame upon\r\n  these Castilians who lead the king into this matter, and withal\r\n  that, he will speak to the king. Some days past I entreated him\r\n  much about this business, and he never took a determination, and I\r\n  think that he will do likewise now. It appears to me, Sire, that\r\n  your Highness might get back Fernam de Magalhāes, which would be\r\n  a great buffet to these people. I do not reckon the bachelor [Ruy\r\n  Faleiro] for much, for he is almost out of his mind. I took steps\r\n  with Dom Jorge[11] with respect to the going there of his alcaide,\r\n  and he says that he will go at any rate; so, Sire, as this is in\r\n  this manner, for all that, I will never desist from striving in\r\n  this to the extent of my power.\r\n\r\n  Let not your Highness consider that I said much to the king in what\r\n  I did say to him, because, besides what I said being all true,\r\n  these people, as I say, do not feel anything, neither has the king\r\n  liberty up to this time to do anything of himself, and on this\r\n  account what he does (_his affairs_) need to be felt less. The Lord\r\n  increase the life and State of your Highness for His holy service.\r\n  From Saragoça, Tuesday at night, the twenty-eighth of September\r\n  [1518].[12]\r\n\r\n  I kiss the hands of your Highness.\r\n\r\n                                                   +Alvaro da Costa.+\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Letter from Sebastian Alvarez, Factor of Dom Manuel, to\r\n               the King, dated Seville, July 18, 1519._\r\n\r\n      (Torre do Tombo. Corp. Chronol., Part I. Maço 13, Doc. 20.)\r\n\r\n  Sire,\r\n\r\n  On the 15th of this July I received through Chavascas, the\r\n  equerry, two letters from your Highness, one of the 18th and the\r\n  other of the 29th of last month, which I understood, and without\r\n  recapitulating the second one, I answer your Highness.\r\n\r\n  There have now arrived together in this city, Christopher de Haro\r\n  and Juan de Cartagena, the chief factor of the fleet and captain\r\n  of a ship, and the treasurer and clerk of this fleet; and in the\r\n  regulations which they bring there are clauses contrary to the\r\n  instructions of Fernan de Magalhāes; these having been seen by the\r\n  accountant and factors of the House of Trade, they seek how they\r\n  can embroil the affairs of Magellan, and they were at once of the\r\n  opinion of those who have recently arrived.\r\n\r\n  Together, they sent to summon Fernan de Magalhāes, and requested\r\n  to know from him the order of this fleet, and the cause why there\r\n  was no captain going in the fourth ship, but only Carvalho, who was\r\n  a pilot and not a captain. He replied, that he wished to take the\r\n  ship thus for it to carry the lantern, and for him to pass over to\r\n  it from time to time.\r\n\r\n  And they said to him that he carried many Portuguese, and that\r\n  it was not well that he should take so many. He answered, that\r\n  he would do what he chose in the fleet without giving them any\r\n  account, and that they could not do it without rendering account to\r\n  him. There passed between them so many and such evil words, that\r\n  the factors ordered pay to be issued to the seamen and men-at-arms,\r\n  but not to any of the Portuguese whom Magellan and Ruy Faleiro have\r\n  got to take with them, and at the same time a courier was sent to\r\n  the Court of Castile.\r\n\r\n   As I saw the matter was begun and the season convenient for\r\n  saying that which your Highness bade me say, I went to the lodgings\r\n  of Magellan, where I found him arranging baskets and boxes with\r\n  victuals of conserves and other things. I pressed him, feigning,\r\n  that as I found him thus occupied, it seemed to me that the\r\n  undertaking of his evil design was settled, and that, as this would\r\n  be the last conversation I should have with him, I wished to recall\r\n  to his memory how many times, as a good Portuguese and his friend,\r\n  I had spoken to him, and opposed the great error which he was\r\n  committing.\r\n\r\n   After begging his pardon, if he should receive from me any\r\n  offence in the conversation, I called to his recollection how often\r\n  I had spoken to him, and how well he had always answered me, and\r\n  that, according to his replies, I had always hoped that at the\r\n  end he would not go to the so great dis-service of your Highness;\r\n  and that what I always told him was that he should see that this\r\n  road had as many dangers as Saint Catharine’s wheel, and that\r\n  he ought to leave it and take the straight road,[13] and return\r\n  to his native country and the favour of your Highness, where he\r\n  would always receive benefits. In this conversation I introduced\r\n  all the dangers which appeared to me, and the faults which he was\r\n  committing. He said to me, that now he could do nothing else,\r\n  for his honour’s sake, except follow his path. I said to him,\r\n  that to acquire honour unduly, and when acquired by such infamy,\r\n  was neither wisdom nor honour, but rather deprivation of wisdom\r\n  and honour, for he might be certain that the chief Castilians of\r\n  this city, when speaking of him, held him to be a vile man, of\r\n  low blood, since to the dis-service of his true king and lord\r\n  he accepted such an enterprise; and so much the more since it\r\n  was prepared, concerted, and requested by him, that he might be\r\n  sure that he was held to be a traitor in going against the State\r\n  of your Highness. Here he answered me that he saw the fault he\r\n  was committing, but that he hoped to observe the service of your\r\n  Highness, and to do you great service by his going. I told him that\r\n  whoever should praise such a speech, did not understand the matter,\r\n  because, supposing that he did not touch any of the conquest of\r\n  your Highness, how was he going to discover what he talked of;\r\n  moreover, it was to the great detriment of the revenues of your\r\n  Highness, and this would be sustained by the whole realm and by\r\n  all sorts of persons: and that thought of his had been a more\r\n  virtuous one which he had when he said to me that, if your Highness\r\n  ordered him to return to Portugal, he would do so without any other\r\n  assurance of favours, and that should your Highness not confer\r\n  them, there was always Serradossa and seven ells of serge, and some\r\n  beads of acorns.[14] It seemed to me then that his heart was true\r\n  as to what befitted his honour and conscience; that which was said\r\n  was so much that it is not possible to write it.\r\n\r\n   Here, Sire, he began to give a sign, telling me to tell him more,\r\n  that this did not come from myself, and that if your Highness had\r\n  bidden me say it, that I should tell him, and the favour which\r\n  you would confer upon him. I told him that I was not of so much\r\n  tonnage as that your Highness should put me into such a business;\r\n  but I said it to him as I had done on many other occasions. Here he\r\n  wished to do me honour, saying that if what I had begun with him,\r\n  went forward, without other persons intervening, that your Highness\r\n  would be served; but that Nuño Ribeiro had told him one thing, and\r\n  that it was of no importance; and Joam Mendez, another, and that\r\n  these did not agree; and he told me the favour which they promised\r\n  on behalf of your Highness. Here he made a great lamentation, and\r\n  said that he felt it all, but that he did not know of anything by\r\n  means of which he could reasonably leave a king who had shown him\r\n  so much favour. I told him that to do that which he ought and not\r\n  to lose his honour, and the favour which your Highness would confer\r\n  upon him, would be more certain and accompanied by truer honour:\r\n  and that he should weigh his coming from Portugal, which had been\r\n  for a hundred reals, more or less, of allowances,[15] which your\r\n  Highness had not granted him, so as not to break your ordinance,\r\n  and that two regulations had arrived contrary to his, and that\r\n  which he had contracted with the King Don Carlos, and he would see\r\n  whether that neglect weighed more, for him to go and do what he\r\n  ought to do, or come here for that which he had come for.\r\n\r\n   He wondered much at my knowing so much, and here he told me the\r\n  truth, and that the courier had left: all which I knew. And he told\r\n  me that certainly there would be no reason for his throwing over\r\n  the undertaking, unless they deprived him of anything which had\r\n  been assigned him by the contract. But first he had to see what\r\n  your Highness would do. I said to him, what more did he want to\r\n  see than the instructions, and Ruy Faleiro, who said openly that\r\n  he was not going to follow his lantern, and that he would navigate\r\n  to the south, or would not go in the fleet? also, that he thought\r\n  he was going as captain-major, whilst I knew that others were sent\r\n  in opposition, whom he would not know of except at a time when he\r\n  could not remedy his honour; and that he should not pay attention\r\n  to the honey, which the Bishop of Burgos put to his lips, and that\r\n  now was the fit time for him to see whether he would do it, and\r\n  that he should give me a letter for your Highness, and that I from\r\n  affection for him would go to your Highness to act on his behalf,\r\n  because I had no message[16] from your Highness to occupy myself\r\n  with the like, but that I only spoke what I thought as at other\r\n  times I had done. He said to me that he would not say anything to\r\n  me until he saw the message which the courier brought: and with\r\n  this we concluded. I will watch the service of your Highness to the\r\n  full extent of my power.\r\n\r\n  At this juncture, it seems to me well that your Highness should\r\n  know that it is certain that the navigation which these men hope\r\n  to perform is known to the King Don Carlos, and Fernan Magellan\r\n  has told me as much, and there might be some one to undertake the\r\n  enterprise who would do more harm. I spoke to Ruy Faleiro on two\r\n  occasions. He never answered me anything else than, how could he\r\n  do anything against the king his lord, who did him such favour. To\r\n  all that I said to him, he did not reply anything else. It seems\r\n  to me that he is like a man deranged in his senses, and that this\r\n  familiar of his has deprived him of whatever knowledge there was in\r\n  him. It seems to me that, if Fernan Magellan were removed, that Ruy\r\n  Faleiro would follow whatever Magellan did.\r\n\r\n  The ships of Magellan’s fleet, Sire, are five; that is to say, one\r\n  of a hundred and ten tons, two of eighty tons each, and the other\r\n  two of sixty tons each, a little more or less. They are very old\r\n  and patched up; for I saw them when they were beached for repairs.\r\n  It is eleven months since they were repaired, and they are now\r\n  afloat, and they are caulking them in the water. I went on board of\r\n  them a few times, and I assure your Highness that I should be ill\r\n  inclined to sail in them to the Canaries, because their knees are\r\n  of touchwood.\r\n\r\n  The artillery which they all carry are eighty guns, of a very small\r\n  size; only in the largest ship, in which Magellan is going, there\r\n  are four very good iron cannon. All the crews whom they take in all\r\n  the five vessels are two hundred and thirty men. The greater number\r\n  have already received their pay; only the Portuguese, who will\r\n  not accept a thousand reis, and who are waiting for the courier\r\n  to arrive, because Magellan told them that he would get their pay\r\n  increased, and they carry provisions for two years.\r\n\r\n   The captain of the first ship is Fernan Magellan, and of the\r\n  second, Ruy Faleiro; of the third, Juan de Cartagena, who is the\r\n  chief factor of the fleet; of the fourth, Quesada, a dependant\r\n  of the Archbishop of Seville; the fifth goes without any known\r\n  captain, —— Carvalho, a Portuguese, goes in her as pilot. Here it\r\n  is said that, as soon as they are out of the mouth of the river, he\r\n  will put into her, as captain, Alvaro da Mesquita of Estremoz, who\r\n  is here.\r\n\r\n  The Portuguese who have come here to sail are,\r\n\r\n    —— Carvalho, pilot.\r\n\r\n    Estevan Gomez, pilot.\r\n\r\n    —— Serrāo, pilot.\r\n\r\n    Vasco Galego, pilot; he has been living here for some time.\r\n\r\n    Alvaro de Mesquita of Estremoz.\r\n\r\n    Martin da Mesquita of Estremoz.\r\n\r\n    Francisco d’Afonseca, son of the Corregidor of Rosmaninhal.\r\n\r\n    Christopher Ferreira, son of the Corregidor of Castelejo.\r\n\r\n    Martin Gil, son of the Judge for the Orphans of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n    Pero d’Abreu, a dependent of the Bishop of Zafy.\r\n\r\n    Duarte Barbosa, nephew of Diogo Barbosa, a dependent of the\r\n      Bishop of Siguenza.\r\n\r\n    Antonio Fernandez, who lived in the Moorish quarter of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n    Luis Affonso of Beja, who was a dependent of the Lady Infanta,\r\n      whom may God have in His keeping.\r\n\r\n    Juan da Silva, son of Nuno da Silva, of the island of Madeira.\r\n      This man has always told me that he would not go unless, if\r\n      your Highness held it to be for your service, and he behaves as\r\n      a concealed friend.\r\n\r\n    Faleiro has got here his father and mother, and brothers, one\r\n      of whom he takes with him.\r\n\r\n  Other small people of the servants of these also say that they\r\n  are going, of which I will make a report to your Highness, if you\r\n  command it, when they go.\r\n\r\n   The fifth part of this armament is from Cristoval de Haro, who\r\n  has spent on it four thousand ducats. They say here that your\r\n  Highness had ordered to take from him there [in Portugal] twenty\r\n  thousand cruzados of property. He gives here information about the\r\n  fleets of your Highness, both of what is done, and of what is to be\r\n  done. I learned that by a servant of his whom he has got there; by\r\n  obtaining from him the letters, your Highness might be able to know\r\n  by what means he learns these secrets.\r\n\r\n  The goods which they take are copper, quicksilver, common cloths of\r\n  colours, common coloured silks, and jackets made of these silks.\r\n\r\n  It is assured that this fleet will start down the river at the end\r\n  of this July; but it does not seem so to me, nor before the middle\r\n  of August, even though the courier should come more quickly.\r\n\r\n  The course which it is said they are to take is straight to Cape\r\n  Frio, Brasil remaining on their right hand, until they reach the\r\n  line of the demarcation; from thence they are to navigate to the\r\n  west and west-north-west, straight to Maluco, which land of Maluco\r\n  I have seen laid down on the sphere and map, which the son of\r\n  Reynell made here, which was not completed when his father came\r\n  here for him; and his father finished it all, and placed these\r\n  lands of Maluco; and after this pattern all the maps are made,\r\n  which Diogo Ribeiro makes, and he makes the compasses, quadrants,\r\n  and globes, but he does not go in the fleet, nor does he wish to do\r\n  more than gain his living by his skill.[17]\r\n\r\n   From this Cape Frio, until the islands of Maluco throughout this\r\n  navigation, there are no lands laid down in the maps which they\r\n  carry with them. Please God the Almighty that they may make such a\r\n  voyage as did the Cortereals,[18] and that your Highness may be at\r\n  rest, and for ever be envied, as you are, by all princes.\r\n\r\n  Sire, another fleet is being prepared of three small rotten ships,\r\n  in which Andres Niño goes as captain; he takes out, inside these\r\n  old ships, two other small vessels built in pieces; he goes to the\r\n  mainland which Pedre Ayres discovered, to the port of Larym, and\r\n  from thence he is to go by land twenty leagues to the South Sea,\r\n  whither he is to carry by land the newly-built ships, with the\r\n  rigging of the old ones, and to fit them out on that South Sea, and\r\n  with these vessels he is to discover for a thousand leagues, and\r\n  not more, towards the west of the coasts of the land which is named\r\n  Gataio; and in these Gil Gonzalez, the accountant of the Island of\r\n  Hispaniola, is to go as captain-major, and they are going for two\r\n  years. When these fleets have sailed, another of four ships will\r\n  then be made to go, as it is said, on the track of Magellan; but,\r\n  as this is not yet put into gear for performance, nothing certain\r\n  is known: and this is arranged by Christoval do Haro. Whatever more\r\n  may occur, I will make known to your Highness.\r\n\r\n   As to the news of the fleet which the King Don Carlos orders\r\n  to be built to defend himself from, or to attack France, or to\r\n  go to the Empire, as it is said, I excuse myself from writing of\r\n  it to your Highness, since your Highness will obtain them with\r\n  more certainty from Nuno Ribeiro, who is in Cartagena. But there\r\n  is certain news in this city by letters, that the King of France\r\n  announces that the King Don Carlos is not going to be emperor,\r\n  and that he will be it. The Pope assists the King of France in\r\n  an honest way. He grants to him four cardinal’s hats for him to\r\n  give to whomsoever he pleases. It is said that the King of France\r\n  keeps them to give to those whom the electors of the empire might\r\n  wish. There it is assured that either the King of France will be\r\n  emperor or else the person he may choose. I will take especial care\r\n  to inform your Highness of what more happens with these fleets,\r\n  although I had become cool in this matter, because it seemed to\r\n  me that your Highness wished to learn it from some one else; for\r\n  I saw here Nuno Ribeiro and other persons who spoke to me in a\r\n  dissembling manner, and seeking to learn about me. I kiss the hands\r\n  of your Highness. From Seville, the 18th of July, of 1519.\r\n\r\n                                                 +Sebastian Alvarez.+\r\n\r\nThe long interval which elapsed before the example set by Magellan was\r\nfollowed by Drake and Van Noort (for the expedition of the Comendador\r\nLoaysa in 1527, and two others having failed, this voyage was not again\r\nattempted in those times by the Spaniards) is a proof that greater\r\nhardihood was displayed in Magellan’s voyage than in those of Columbus\r\nand Gama; and the fortitude and constancy of Magellan appear strongly\r\nfrom the foregoing despatches, since in addition to the physical\r\ndifficulties of his enterprise, he had to struggle against intrigues,\r\njealousy, and the alternate upbraiding and cajolery of the King of\r\nPortugal’s agents. The despatch of Sebastian Alvarez to Dom Manuel,\r\nthough biassed as it naturally is, shows that whatever he and the\r\nPortuguese of that day thought of Magellan’s design, he himself did not\r\nconsider that he was doing anything injurious to his king or country,\r\nand Camoens, though he repeats the hackneyed accusation of disloyalty\r\nagainst Magellan, yet boasts of his achievements as a lasting honour to\r\nPortugal, in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    “Fired by thy fame,[19] and with his king in ire,\r\n     To match thy deeds shall Magalhaens aspire:\r\n     In all but loyalty, of Lusian soul,\r\n     No fear, no danger shall his toils controul.\r\n     Along these regions from the burning zone\r\n     To deepest south he dares the course unknown.\r\n     While to the kingdoms of the rising day,\r\n     To rival thee he holds the western way,\r\n     A land of giants shall his eyes behold,\r\n     Of camel strength, surpassing human mould:\r\n     And onward still, thy fame, his proud heart’s guide,\r\n     Haunting him unappeased, the dreary tide\r\n     Beneath the southern star’s cold gleam he braves,\r\n     And stems the whirls of land-surrounded waves.\r\n     +For ever sacred to the hero’s fame\r\n     These foaming straits shall bear his deathless name.+\r\n     Through these dread jaws of rock he presses on;\r\n     Another ocean’s breast, immense, unknown,\r\n     Beneath the south’s cold wings, unmeasured, wide,\r\n     Receives his vessels; through the dreary tide\r\n     In darkling shades where never man before\r\n     Heard the waves howl, he dares the nameless shore.\r\n     Thus far, O favoured Lusians, bounteous heaven\r\n     Your nation’s glories to your view has given.\r\n     What ensigns, blazing to the morn, pursue\r\n     The path of heroes, opened first by you!\r\n     Still be it your’s the first in fame to shine:\r\n     Thus shall your brides[20] new chaplets still entwine,\r\n     With laurels ever new your brows enfold,\r\n     And braid your wavy locks with radiant gold.”[21]\r\n\r\nThe poet of the Lusiad, who had said that the Muses sang of Gama\r\nunwillingly, here concludes his praises of Magellan with a promise to\r\nthe Portuguese of ever renewed praise—a promise which will be fulfilled\r\nby posterity whenever the character and enterprise of Magellan are\r\ncompared with those of his contemporaries; for whilst the cruelty and\r\nviolence of Gama, and the difficulty his companions had in restraining\r\nhim, were very serious defects in his character, Magellan gave many\r\nnoble examples of the opposite virtues and of other qualities of a\r\nvery high order. His conduct on the occasion of the shipwreck near the\r\nMaldive Islands has been already described; the clemency with which\r\nhe tempered justice when he put down the mutiny in Port St. Julian—a\r\nmutiny which Sebastian Alvarez, the King of Portugal’s agent, would\r\nappear to have been privy to, if indeed he did not prepare it, shows\r\ngreat self-restraint, and the whole of his conduct in the islands of\r\nSebu and Matan, where he fell, defending the retreat of his companions,\r\nis more like that of the knights errant of an earlier date, than that\r\nof his contemporaries. Pigafetta, who was with him at his death, was\r\ndeeply affected by it, and recounts his many virtues and qualities in\r\nan appeal to the Grand Master of Rhodes not to allow Magellan’s memory\r\nto be lost.\r\n\r\nMost of the captains of ships at this time, and long afterwards,\r\nwere soldiers put into naval commands; but Magellan, besides being\r\na military officer, was also an experienced and learned navigator,\r\nand Pigafetta’s Treatise of Navigation may be taken as the result of\r\nMagellan’s instruction in that art.[22] The voyage of Columbus, which\r\nemployed only thirty-three days out and twenty-eight homeward-bound,\r\ncannot be compared with that of Magellan, and if Columbus was as good\r\na seaman and navigator as Magellan, yet a certain superiority must be\r\nallowed to the latter on account of his numerous military exploits in\r\nIndia and Africa.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to ascertain who was Juan Serrano, who remained in\r\nthe hands of the Sebu islanders after the massacre of Duarte Barbosa\r\nand his companions, and in Navarrete he is sometimes spoken of as\r\nan inhabitant of Seville and sometimes as a Portuguese. Pigafetta\r\nspeaks of him as a Spaniard, but the despatch of Sebastian Alvarez\r\nleaves no doubt as to his being Portuguese, which otherwise might\r\nhave been inferred from his being a _compadre_ of Joan Carvalho. It\r\nis probable that he was a relation of Francisco Serrano, the friend\r\nand correspondent of Magellan, who died in Ternate about eight months\r\nbefore the arrival at Tidore of Magellan’s ships: it is also probable\r\nthat he was the same Juan Serrano whose voyage with Francisco Serrano\r\nin 1512 from Malacca to the Java Seas is related in the book of Duarte\r\nBarbosa on the coasts of East Africa and Malabar (Hakluyt Society).\r\n\r\nSebastian de Elcano, a native of Guetaria in Biscay, had the good\r\nfortune to be in command of the _Victoria_ on her return to Seville,\r\nand though his name is not mentioned during the voyage in any of the\r\nnarratives, he reaped the principal rewards of the expedition, and on\r\nhis arrival at Court, received from Charles V a pension of five hundred\r\ngold crowns, and was authorised to take for arms a globe, with the\r\nmotto “Primus me circumdedisti”. Amongst other sonnets to his memory,\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n  Por tierra y por mar profundo\r\n  Con iman y derrotero,\r\n  Un Vascongado, el primero\r\n  Dió la vuelta á todo el mundo.\r\n\r\n                              _Conchita._\r\n\r\n  Entraba en el breado y hueco pino,\r\n  Tomando el dulce y suspirado puerto,\r\n  Juan Sebastian del Cano, Vizcaino,\r\n  Piloto de este mundo el mas esperto,\r\n  Despuces de haber andado en su camino\r\n  Cuanto del mar se halla descubierto,\r\n  En una nave dicha la Victoria:\r\n  Hazaña digna de inmortal memoria.\r\n\r\n                              _Mosquera._\r\n\r\nThis volume contains six contemporary accounts of Magellan’s voyage for\r\nthe circumnavigation of the globe: one was written by a Genoese pilot\r\nof the fleet; the second by a Portuguese companion of Duarte Barbosa,\r\nwhich has been preserved by Ramusio; the third by Antonio Pigafetta\r\nof Vicenza; and the fourth is a letter of Maximilian Transylvanus, a\r\nSecretary of the Emperor Charles V; the fifth a log book of a pilot\r\nnamed Francisco Albo or Alvaro; the sixth is taken from Gaspar Correa’s\r\n_Lendas da India_.\r\n\r\nOf Pigafetta’s account, four manuscripts are known, three of them\r\nare in French, and one in Italian. Two of the French manuscripts are\r\nin the Bibliothèque Impériale of Paris; one of these, numbered 5,650,\r\nis on paper; the other, numbered 68, of the Lavallière collection,\r\nis on vellum, and is richly illuminated; it does not contain the\r\nBrazilian and Patagonian vocabularies given in No. 5,650, and some\r\nrather indecent details are omitted or softened down, which leads to\r\nthe conclusion that this copy was the one presented by Pigafetta to\r\nthe Regent, Louise of Savoy. The third French manuscript, and the most\r\ncomplete, was in the possession of M. Beaupré of Nancy till 1855, it\r\nthen passed into the Solar collection, and in 1861 was sold for 1,650\r\nfrancs to a London book-seller, and, later, was bought by Sir Thomas\r\nPhillipps at Libri’s sale.\r\n\r\nM. Rd. Thomassy published a memoir in the _Bulletin de la Société de\r\nGéographie_ of Paris, September 1843, in which he examines the question\r\nwhether Pigafetta composed his account of his voyage in French. He\r\nhas come to a conclusion (which M. Ferdinand Denis has also adopted)\r\nin favour of the French manuscript having been originally composed by\r\nPigafetta, and not translated from the Italian, on the grounds of its\r\nbeing addressed to the grand master of Rhodes, Villiers de l’Ile-Adam,\r\nwho was himself a Frenchman, and that Pigafetta had recently been made\r\na Knight of Rhodes; and that Pigafetta used the French language for the\r\ndevice which he set up over his paternal house in the street of la Luna\r\nin Vicenza, “Il n’y a pas de roses sans épines”; that other Italians of\r\nthe time had written in French; that the Italian MS. of the Ambrosian\r\nLibrary of Milan, published in 1800 by Amoretti, is in bad Italian,\r\nmixed with Venetian and Spanish, so that M. Amoretti saw in it rather\r\na copy than the original of the relation presented to the Pope or to\r\nthe Grand Master; these defects M. Amoretti removed by translating them\r\ninto good Italian: also that the French edition of Fabre, though stated\r\nto be a translation from the Italian, was used in 1536 to publish an\r\nItalian edition; whereas if an Italian edition had existed before, that\r\nof Fabre would not have been required. Fabre’s edition, moreover, is\r\nvery imperfect; and he puts what Pigafetta says in the third person. M.\r\nThomassy concludes, therefore, that the version of Fabre was made from\r\nsome Italian _resumé_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the motives urged by M. Thomassy for believing that\r\nPigafetta himself composed the French manuscripts, there is evidence of\r\nit in the phraseology of the MSS.; had these been translations from the\r\nItalian, every word would have been translated into French, whereas,\r\ninstead of that, we find a great many Italian words used, especially\r\nin the vocabularies, also some Italian idioms. It was natural that\r\nPigafetta, if he had not the French word at command, should write down\r\nan Italian one, such as “calcagno” for “talon”.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, I should be inclined to believe that the Ambrosian\r\nMS., with its mixture of Spanish words, was composed by Pigafetta\r\nhimself, in whom such a mixture of words would be more natural after so\r\nlong a voyage in a Spanish ship, than in an Italian scribe.\r\n\r\nThat Pigafetta did compose a work in Italian appears from a document\r\nin the archives of Venice, containing a petition of Pigafetta to the\r\nDoge and Council of Venice, dated August 5th, 1524, applying for leave\r\nto print his account of his circumnavigation of the globe, and to have\r\na privilege for twenty years. This is followed by a statement that the\r\nprayer of the petition was granted by the Doge and 152 of the Council,\r\nsix members of which voted against Pigafetta. The text of this document\r\nis given in the Appendix; it was communicated to me by the Geographical\r\nSociety of Paris, which has published a translation of it in its\r\nbulletin of February 1869.\r\n\r\nUntil M. Amoretti published his edition of Pigafetta from the\r\nAmbrosian MS. in 1800, there never was a complete or an original\r\nItalian edition of Pigafetta; for the quarto edition of 1536\r\n(Grenville, 6,977), without name of author or printer, is, as is\r\nmentioned in the address to the reader, a translation from the edition\r\nof Jacques Fabre. This edition of 1536 had a privilege for fourteen\r\nyears; it must be by Ramusio, for the address to the reader is almost\r\nthe same as his more abridged “discourse” in his collection of\r\ntravels of Venice, 1550, and Venice, 1613, folio, 346 v. In Ramusio’s\r\ncollection, and in the edition of 1536, Pigafetta’s voyage is preceded\r\nby the letter of Maximilian Transylvanus, Secretary of the Emperor\r\nCharles V, to the Cardinal of Salzburg. This letter of Maximilian’s is\r\nnot quite the same in the two books in the division of the paragraphs;\r\nin Pigafetta’s voyage there is greater similarity, and the paragraphs\r\nare numbered identically in the edition of 1536 and in Fabre’s French\r\nedition. Ramusio says:\r\n\r\n  “Magellan’s voyage was written, with details, by Don Pietro\r\n  Martire, of the Council of the Indies of the Emperor, and that he\r\n  had examined all those who had survived the voyage, and returned\r\n  to Seville in the year 1522; but, having sent it to be printed at\r\n  Rome, in the miserable sack of that town it was lost, and it is not\r\n  yet known where it is. One who saw it and read it gives testimony\r\n  of it, and amongst the other things worthy of recollection which\r\n  the above-named Don Pietro noted in this voyage, was that the\r\n  Spaniards having navigated about three years and a month, and the\r\n  greater part of them (as is the custom of those who navigate on\r\n  the ocean) having noted down each day of each month, when they\r\n  rejoined Spain they found they had lost one day; that is, when they\r\n  reached the port of Seville, which was on the 7th of September, by\r\n  the account which they had kept it was the 6th. Don Pietro having\r\n  related this particularity to an excellent and rare man, Sig.\r\n  Gasparo Contarino,[23] a Venetian senator, who was then in Spain\r\n  as ambassador to his Majesty from his Republic, and having asked\r\n  him how it could be, he, as a very great philosopher, shewed him\r\n  that it could not be otherwise, as they had navigated three years,\r\n  always accompanying the sun, which was going westwards; and he said\r\n  that the ancients had observed that those who navigated to the west\r\n  greatly lengthened their day.”\r\n\r\nThis book of Don Pietro’s having been lost, says Ramusio, he thought\r\nof translating the Latin letter of Maximilian, and of adding to it the\r\nsummary of a book which was written by the valiant knight of Rhodes,\r\nMesser Antonio Pigafetta, a Vicentine; and this said book was abridged\r\nand translated into French by a very learned philosopher, named Messer\r\nJacopo Fabri, of Paris, at the instance of the most serene mother of\r\nthe most Christian King Francis, Madame Louisa the Regent, to whom the\r\naforesaid knight had made a present of one [of his books].\r\n\r\nThis French epitome by Fabre is a small octavo of seventy-six leaves,\r\nin Gothic type (Grenville, 7,065); it is without date; the title is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “Le Voyage et Navigation, faict par les Espaignolz es Isles de\r\n  Mollucques, des isles quilz out trouue audict voyage, des Roys\r\n  dicelles, de leur gouuernment & maniere de viure, auec plusieurs\r\n  aultres choses.”\r\n\r\n  “Cum Priuilegio, ¶ on les vend a Paris en la maison de Simon de\r\n  Colines, libraire iure de luniuersite de Paris, demeurāt en la rue\r\n  sainct Jehan de Beauluais, a lenseigne du Soleil Dor.”\r\n\r\nSimon de Colines, the printer, issued his last work in 1546, and his\r\nheirs are mentioned on a work of 1550.[24]\r\n\r\nIn 1801, a French translation of Amoretti’s edition of Pigafetta was\r\npublished by H. J. Jansen, who added a translation from the German of\r\nM. de Murr’s Notice on the Chevalier M. Behaim. In this translation,\r\nsome liberties have been taken with the text; and it is to be regretted\r\nthat this translation was published instead of the French text\r\ncontained in the two MSS. of the Bibliothèque Impériale; these, even\r\nwere they not Pigafetta’s own composition, possess a philological\r\ninterest of their own.\r\n\r\nAn English translation of Pigafetta by Richard Wren, London, 1625, is\r\nmentioned in _l’Art de Vérifier les Dates, depuis 1770_, folio, vol.\r\niii, p. 333. There is no copy of this in the British Museum Library.\r\n\r\nThe other contemporaneous account of Magellan’s voyage, a translation\r\nof which precedes that of Pigafetta’s account, is by a Genoese pilot.\r\nThis pilot probably was named Mestre Bautista, since Barros mentions\r\nhim as a Genoese who, on the death of the pilot Joan Carvalho, was\r\ncharged with piloting the _Trinidad_, which got as far as Ternate.\r\nCorrea (tom. ii, p. 632) also mentions that Mestre Joan Bautista was\r\nmade captain instead of Carvalho, after he had allowed the son of the\r\nKing of Luzon to escape at Borneo. Of this account, three manuscripts\r\nexist; all three are in Portuguese. From two of these MSS. a printed\r\nedition was published in the _Noticias Ultramarinas_, No. II, by\r\nthe Academy of History of Lisbon. The text which served for this\r\npublication was a MS. which belonged to the library of the monks of S.\r\nBento da Saude; and it has been supplemented and annotated from another\r\nmanuscript, which is in the Bibliothèque Impériale at Paris, numbered\r\n⁷¹⁵⁸⁄₃₃, a copy of which was made by Dr. Antonio Nunes de Carvalho\r\nin 1831. A third manuscript of this pilot’s narrative exists in the\r\nlibrary of the Academy of History of Madrid, No. 30, Est. 11a, grada 2a.\r\n\r\nAfter the Genoese pilot’s narrative follows that of an anonymous\r\nPortuguese taken from Ramusio.\r\n\r\nThe letter of Maximilian, the Transylvanian, follows Pigafetta’s\r\naccount; this has been translated from the Latin by Mr. James Baynes,\r\nof the Printed Book Department of the British Museum. After that comes\r\nthe log-book of Francisco Albo or Alvaro, translated from a MS. in\r\nthe British Museum, which is a copy from a document in Simancas. This\r\nlog-book has been printed, in Navarrete’s collection, apparently from\r\nthe British Museum MS., and it appears to have escaped the notice of\r\nCaptain Burney. It is especially valuable because it helps to fix the\r\nposition of the “Unfortunate Islands”, and because it establishes that\r\nthe Island of Amsterdam in the Southern Indian Ocean to the North of\r\nSt. Paul’s Island, the discovery of which is usually attributed to the\r\nDutch navigator Vlaming, in 1696, was discovered March 18th, 1522, by\r\nthe _Victoria_, the first ship which went round the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a confusion as to the names of these two islands, which are\r\nrightly named in the Admiralty and other sea charts, but which are\r\nwrongly named in common English maps, which place St. Paul to the north\r\nof Amsterdam. The southern island is bare and arid, and the northern\r\nisland has bushes and a high peak visible eighteen or twenty leagues\r\noff. Francisco Albo says this Island had no trees; but the _Victoria_\r\nmay not have approached near enough to see the bushes, which, from the\r\nviews of the island, appear to be near its base; it is clear that the\r\n_Victoria_ approached the northern island, or Amsterdam, because not\r\nonly does the latitude given by F. Albo differ from that of modern\r\nobservation by only eight miles, but also because from the course\r\nsteered by the _Victoria_ on leaving this island, she must have sighted\r\nthe northern island had the one discovered by her been the southern\r\none. Plates are given of these two islands, taken from Valentyn’s Dutch\r\nwork on the East Indies. A French Geographical Dictionary sets up a\r\nclaim to these islands as belonging to the government of the Isle of\r\nFrance or Mauritius; it does not say on what grounds; but if ever they\r\nwere dependencies of Mauritius, they will have passed with that island\r\ninto the possession of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCorrea’s narrative contains two details not given in any of the other\r\naccounts, viz., the warning given to Magellan at Tenerife by Diogo\r\nBarbosa of the intended mutiny; and the incident of the Portuguese ship\r\nspeaking the _Victoria_ off the Cape of Good Hope. Correa’s having been\r\nin India at the time, and relating what he heard from the Portuguese,\r\nwould account for his misplacing the death of Magellan as having\r\nhappened at the same time as that of Duarte Barbosa. His narrative also\r\ncontains additional evidence of the violent animosity of the Portuguese\r\nagainst Magellan, though he himself is more favourable than other\r\nPortuguese historians to him who is one of the most renowned of their\r\ncountrymen, as he undoubtedly is the greatest of ancient and modern\r\nnavigators.\r\n\r\n  _September 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHRONOLOGY\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                     FIRST VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Magellan arrives at Seville                       October 20,  1518\r\n\r\n  Magellan’s fleet sails from Seville   Monday,[25] August 10,   1519\r\n\r\n  Magellan sails from San Lucar de Barrameda,\r\n                                           Tuesday, September 20,  „\r\n\r\n      „    arrives at Tenerife                      September 26,  „\r\n\r\n      „    sails from Tenerife             Monday,  October 3,     „\r\n\r\n      „    arrives at Rio de Janeiro                December 13,   „\r\n\r\n      „    sails from Rio                           December 26,   „\r\n\r\n      „    sails from Rio de la Plata               February 2,  1520\r\n\r\n      „    arrives at Port St. Julian               March 31,      „\r\n\r\n  Eclipse of Sun                                    April 17,      „\r\n\r\n  Loss of _Santiago_\r\n\r\n  Magellan sails from Port St. Julian               August 24,     „\r\n\r\n      „    sails from river of Santa Cruz           October 18,    „\r\n\r\n      „    makes Cape of the Virgins, entrance\r\n             of Straits                             October 21,    „\r\n\r\n  Desertion of _San Antonio_                        November       „\r\n\r\n  Magellan issues from Straits into the Pacific,\r\n                                         Wednesday, November 28,   „\r\n\r\n  Magellan fetches San Pablo Island                 January 24, 1521\r\n\r\n     „     fetches Tiburones Island                 February 4,   „\r\n\r\n     „     reaches the Ladrone Islands,  Wednesday, March 6,      „\r\n\r\n     „     reaches Samar Island of the Philippines\r\n                                          Saturday, March 16,     „\r\n\r\n     „     reaches Mazzava Island,        Thursday, March 28,     „\r\n\r\n     „     arrives at Sebu Island                   April 7,      „\r\n\r\n  Death of Magellan at Matan              Saturday, April 27,     „\r\n\r\n  Burning of _Conception_                           May,          „\r\n\r\n  Arrival of _San Antonio_ at Seville               May 6,        „\r\n\r\n  Arrival of _Victoria_ and _Trinity_ at Tidore,\r\n                                            Friday, November 8,   „\r\n\r\n  _Victoria_ sails from Tidore                      December 21,  „\r\n\r\n     „     discovers Amsterdam Island,     Tuesday, March 18,    1522\r\n\r\n     „     doubles the Cape of Good Hope            May 18,[26]    „\r\n\r\n     „     arrives at Cape Verde Islands,\r\n                                      Wednesday,[27] July 9,       „\r\n\r\n     „     arrives at San Lucar        Saturday,[27] September 6,  „\r\n\r\n     „     casts anchor at Seville       Monday,[27] September 8,  „\r\n\r\n  Thanksgiving at Church of Our Lady of Victory\r\n                                       Tuesday,[27] September 9,   „\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEFE Magelliāes]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile of the signature of Fernam de Magalhães,\r\n  son of Pero de Magalhães, to a receipt in the Book of Moradias\r\n  signed apparently in 1525, and by some erroneously supposed to be\r\n  that of the navigator._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile of the signature of Duarte Barbosa,\r\n  taken from his letter to D.

Having got as far\r\nas this neighbourhood, he shaped his course so as to make for Brazil,\r\nand as soon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to\r\nthe south-east[29] along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which is in\r\ntwenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he steered to\r\nthe west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de Janeiro, which\r\nis in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered the said Rio\r\non the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in which place\r\nthey took in wood, and they remained there until the first octave of\r\nChristmas, which was the 26th of December of the same year.\r\n\r\nThey sailed from this Rio de Janeiro on the 26th December, and\r\nnavigated along the coast to make the Cape of St. Mary, which is in\r\nthirty-four degrees and two-thirds; as soon as they sighted it, they\r\nmade their course west-north-west, thinking they would find a passage\r\nfor their voyage, and they found that they had got into a great\r\nriver of fresh water, to which they gave the name of river of St.\r\nChristopher, and it is in thirty-four degrees, and they remained in it\r\ntill the 2nd of February, 1520.[30]\r\n\r\nHe sailed from this river of St. Christopher on the 2nd of the said\r\nmonth of February; they navigated along the said coast, and further on\r\nto the south they discovered a point which is in the same river more\r\nto the south, to which they gave the name of Point St. Antony; it is\r\nin thirty-six degrees, hence they ran to the south-west, a matter of\r\ntwenty-five leagues, and made another cape which they named Cape St.\r\nApelonia, which is in thirty-six degrees; thence they navigated to the\r\nwest-south-west to some shoals,[31] which they named Shoals of the\r\nCurrents, which are in thirty-nine degrees; and thence they navigated\r\nout to sea, and lost sight of land for a matter of two or three days,\r\nwhen they again made for the land, and they came to a bay, which they\r\nentered, and ran within it the whole day, thinking that there was an\r\noutlet for Maluco, and when night came they found that it was quite\r\nclosed up, and in the same night they again stood out by the way which\r\nthey had come in. This bay is in thirty-four degrees;[32] they name\r\nit the island[33] of St. Matthew. They navigated from this island of\r\nSt. Matthew along the coast until they reached another bay, where they\r\ncaught many sea-wolves and birds; to this they gave the name of “Bay of\r\nLabours;”[34] it is in thirty-seven degrees; here they were near losing\r\nthe flag-ship in a storm. Thence they navigated along the said coast,\r\nand arrived on the last day of March of the year 1520 at the Port of\r\nSt. Julian, which is in forty-nine and one-third degrees,[35] and here\r\nthey wintered, and found the day a little more or less than seven\r\nhours.[36]\r\n\r\nIn this port three of the ships rose up against the Captain-major,\r\ntheir captains saying that they intended to take him to Castile in\r\narrest, as he was taking them all to destruction. Here, through the\r\nexertions of the said Captain-major, and the assistance and favour of\r\nthe foreigners whom he carried with him, the Captain-major went to the\r\nsaid three ships which were already mentioned, and there the captain\r\nof one of them was killed, who was treasurer of the whole fleet, and\r\nnamed Luis de Mendoça; he was killed in his own ship[37] by stabs with\r\na dagger by the chief constable of the fleet, who was sent to do this\r\nby Fernando de Magalhāes in a boat with certain men. The said three\r\nships having thus been recovered, five days later Fernando de Magalhāes\r\nordered Gaspar de Queixada to be decapitated and quartered; he was\r\ncaptain of one of the ships,[38] and was one of those who had mutinied.\r\n\r\nIn this port they refitted the ship. Here the captain-major made\r\nAlvaro de Mesquita, a Portuguese,[39] captain of one of the ships\r\nthe captain of which had been killed. There sailed from this port\r\non the 24th of August four ships, for the smallest of the ships had\r\nbeen already lost;[40] he had sent it to reconnoitre, and the weather\r\nhad been heavy, and had cast it ashore, where all the crew had been\r\nrecovered along with the merchandise, artillery and fittings of the\r\nship. They remained in this port, in which they wintered, five months\r\nand twenty-four days,[41] and they were seventy degrees less ten\r\nminutes to the southward.[42]\r\n\r\nThey sailed on the 24th day of the month of August of the said year\r\nfrom this port of St. Julian and navigated a matter of twenty leagues\r\nalong the coast, and so they entered a river which was called Santa\r\nCruz, which is in fifty degrees,[43] where they took in goods and as\r\nmuch as they could obtain: the crew of the lost ship were already\r\ndistributed among the other ships, for they had returned by land\r\nto where Fernando de Magalhāes was, and they continued collecting\r\nthe goods which had remained there during August and up to the 18th\r\nSeptember, and there they took in water and much fish which they caught\r\nin this river; and in the other, where they wintered, there were people\r\nlike savages, and the men are from nine to ten spans in height, very\r\nwell made; they have not got houses, they only go about from one place\r\nto another with their flocks, and eat meat nearly raw: they are all\r\nof them archers and kill many animals with arrows, and with the skins\r\nthey make clothes, that is to say, they make the skins very supple, and\r\nfashion them after the shape of the body, as well as they can, then\r\nthey cover themselves with them, and fasten them by a belt round the\r\nwaist. When they do not wish to be clothed from the waist upwards, they\r\nlet that half fall which is above the waist, and the garment remains\r\nhanging down from the belt which they have girt round them.[44] They\r\nwear shoes which cover them four inches above the ankle, full of straw\r\ninside to keep their feet warm. They do not possess any iron, nor any\r\nother ingenuity of weapons, only they make the points of their arrows\r\nwith flints, and so also the knives with which they cut, and the adze\r\nand awls with which they cut and stitch their shoes and clothes. They\r\nare very agile people, and do no harm, and thus they follow their\r\nflocks: wherever night finds them there they sleep; they carry their\r\nwives along with them with all the chattels which they possess. The\r\nwomen are very small and carry heavy burdens on their backs; they wear\r\nshoes and clothes just like the men. Of these men they obtained three\r\nor four and brought them in the ships, and they all died except one,\r\nwho went to Castile in a ship which went thither.[45]\r\n\r\nThey sailed from this river of Santa Cruz on the 18th of\r\nOctober:[46] they continued navigating along the coast until the 21st\r\nday of the same month, October, when they discovered a cape, to which\r\nthey gave the name of Cape of the Virgins, because they sighted it on\r\nthe day of the eleven thousand virgins; it is in fifty-two degrees,\r\na little more or less, and from this cape a matter of two or three\r\nleagues distance, we found ourselves at the mouth of a strait.[47] We\r\nsailed along the said coast within that strait which they had reached\r\nthe mouth of: they entered in it a little and anchored. Fernando de\r\nMagalhāes sent to discover what there was further in, and they found\r\nthree channels, that is to say, two more in a southerly direction, and\r\none traversing the country in the direction of Maluco, but at that time\r\nthis was not yet known, only the three mouths were seen. The boats\r\nwent thither, and brought back word, and they set sail and anchored at\r\nthese mouths of the channels, and Fernando de Magalhāes sent two ships\r\nto learn what there was within, and these ships went: one returned\r\nto the Captain-major, and the other, of which Alvaro de Mesquita was\r\ncaptain, entered into one of the bays which was to the south, and did\r\nnot return any more. Fernan de Magalhāes seeing that it did not come\r\nback, set sail,[48] and the next day he did not choose to make for the\r\nbays, and went to the south, and took another which runs north-west and\r\nsouth-east, and a quarter west and east. He left letters in the place\r\nfrom which he sailed, so that if the other ship returned, it might\r\nmake the course which he left prescribed. After this they entered into\r\nthe channel, which at some places has a width of three leagues, and\r\ntwo, and one, and in some places half a league, and he went through\r\nit as long as it was daylight, and anchored when it was night: and he\r\nsent the boats, and the ships went after the boats, and they brought\r\nnews that there was an outlet, for they already saw the great sea on\r\nthe other side; on which account Fernando de Magalhāes ordered much\r\nartillery to be fired for rejoicing;[49] and before they went forth\r\nfrom this strait they found two islands, the first one larger, and the\r\nother nearer towards the outlet is the smaller one: and they went out\r\nbetween these islands and the coast on the southern side, as it was\r\ndeeper than on the other side. This strait is a hundred leagues in\r\nlength to the outlet; that outlet and the entrance are in fifty-two\r\ndegrees latitude.[50] They made a stay in this strait from the 21st\r\nOctober to the 26th of November,[51] which makes thirty-six days of\r\nthe said year of 1520, and as soon as they went out from the strait to\r\nsea, they made their course, for the most part, to west-north-west,\r\nwhen they found that their needles varied to the north-west almost\r\ntwo-fourths, and after they had navigated thus for many days, they\r\nfound an island in a little more or less than eighteen degrees, or\r\nnineteen degrees, and also another, which was in from thirteen to\r\nfourteen degrees, and this in south latitude;[52] they are uninhabited.\r\nThey ran on until they reached the line, when Fernan de Magalhāes\r\nsaid that now they were in the neighbourhood of Maluco, as he had\r\ninformation that there were no provisions at Maluco, he said that he\r\nwould go in a northerly direction as far as ten or twelve degrees, and\r\nthey reached to as far as thirteen degrees north, and in this latitude\r\nthey navigated to the west, and a quarter south-west, a matter of a\r\nhundred leagues, where on the 6th of March, 1521, they fetched two\r\nislands inhabited by many people, and they anchored at one of them,\r\nwhich is in twelve degrees north; and the inhabitants are people of\r\nlittle truth, and they did not take precautions against them until they\r\nsaw that they were taking away the skiff of the flagship, and they cut\r\nthe rope with which it was made fast, and took it ashore without their\r\nbeing able to prevent it. They gave this island the name of Thieves’\r\nIsland (_dos ladrōes_).[53]\r\n\r\nFernando de Magalhāes seeing that the skiff was lost, set sail, as\r\nit was already night, tacking about until the next day; as soon as it\r\nwas morning they anchored at the place where they had seen the skiff\r\ncarried off to, and he ordered two boats to be got ready with a matter\r\nof fifty or sixty men, and he went ashore in person, and burned the\r\nwhole village, and they killed seven or eight persons, between men and\r\nwomen, and recovered the skiff, and returned to the ships; and while\r\nthey were there they saw forty or fifty paros[54] come, which came from\r\nthe same land, and brought much refreshments.[55]\r\n\r\nFernan de Magalhāes would not make any further stay, and at once\r\nset sail, and ordered the course to be steered west, and a quarter\r\nsouth-west; and so they made land, which is in barely eleven degrees.\r\nThis land is an island, but he would not touch at this one, and they\r\nwent to touch at another further on which appeared first.[56] Fernando\r\nde Magalhāes sent a boat ashore to observe the nature of the island;\r\nwhen the boat reached land, they saw from the ships two _paráos_ come\r\nout from behind the point; then they called back their boat. The people\r\nof the paraos seeing that the boat was returning to the ships, turned\r\nback the paraos, and the boat reached the ships, which at once set sail\r\nfor another island very near to this island, which is in ten degrees,\r\nand they gave it the name of the island of Good Signs, because they\r\nfound some gold in it.[57] Whilst they were thus anchored at this\r\nisland, there came to them two paráos, and brought them fowls and\r\ncocoa nuts, and told them that they had already seen there other men\r\nlike them, from which they presumed that these might be _Lequios_ or\r\n_Mogores_;[58] a nation of people who have this name, or _Chiis_;[59]\r\nand thence they set sail, and navigated further on amongst many\r\nislands, to which they gave the name of the _Valley Without Peril_, and\r\nalso St. Lazarus,[60] and they ran on to another island twenty leagues\r\nfrom that[61] from which they sailed, which is in ten degrees,[62] and\r\ncame to anchor at another island, which is named Macangor,[63] which\r\nis in nine degrees; and in this island they were very well received,\r\nand they placed a cross in it.[64] This king conducted them thence a\r\nmatter of thirty leagues to another island named Cabo,[65] which is\r\nin ten degrees, and in this island Fernando de Magalhāes did what he\r\npleased with the consent of the country, and in one day eight hundred\r\npeople became Christian, on which account Fernan de Magalhāes desired\r\nthat the other kings, neighbours to this one, should become subject to\r\nthis who had become Christian: and these did not choose to yield such\r\nobedience. Fernan de Magalhāes seeing that, got ready one night with\r\nhis boats, and burned the villages of those who would not yield the\r\nsaid obedience;[66] and a matter of ten or twelve days after this was\r\ndone he sent to a village about half a league from that which he had\r\nburned, which is named Matam, and which is also an island, and ordered\r\nthem to send him at once three goats, three pigs, three loads of rice,\r\nand three loads of millet for provisions for the ships; they replied\r\nthat of each article which he sent to ask them three of, they would\r\nsend to him by twos, and if he was satisfied with this they would at\r\nonce comply, if not, it might be as he pleased, but that they would not\r\ngive it. Because they did not choose to grant what he demanded of them,\r\nFernan de Magalhāes ordered three boats to be equipped with a matter\r\nof fifty or sixty men,[67] and went against the said place, which was\r\non the 28th day of April, in the morning;[68] there they found many\r\npeople, who might well be as many as three thousand or four thousand\r\nmen, who fought with such a good will that the said Fernan de Magalhāes\r\nwas killed there, with six of his men,[69] in the year 1521.\r\n\r\nWhen Fernan de Magalhāes was dead the Christians got back to the\r\nships, where they thought fit to make two captains and governors whom\r\nthey should obey;[70] and having done this, they took counsel [and\r\ndecided] that the two captains should go ashore where the people had\r\nturned Christians to ask for pilots to take them to Borneo, and this\r\nwas on the first day of May of the said year; when the two captains\r\nwent, being agreed upon what had been said, the same people of the\r\ncountry who had become Christians, armed themselves against them, and\r\nwhilst they reached the shore let them land in security as they had\r\ndone before. Then they attacked them, and killed the two captains and\r\ntwenty-six gentlemen,[71] and the other people who remained got back\r\nto the boats, and returned to the ships, and finding themselves again\r\nwithout captains they agreed, inasmuch as the principal persons were\r\nkilled, that one Joam Lopez,[72] who was the chief treasurer, should be\r\ncaptain-major of the fleet, and the chief constable of the fleet should\r\nbe captain of one of the ships; he was named Gonzalo Vaz Despinosa.[73]\r\n\r\nHaving done this they set sail, and ran about twenty-five leagues with\r\nthree ships, which they still possessed; they then mustered, and found\r\nthat they were altogether one hundred and eight men[74] in all these\r\nthree ships, and many of them were wounded and sick, on which account\r\nthey did not venture to navigate the three ships, and thought it would\r\nbe well to burn one of them—the one that should be most suitable for\r\nthat purpose[75]—and to take into the two ships those that remained:\r\nthis they did out at sea, out of sight of any land. While they did\r\nthis many paraos came to speak to them; and navigating amongst the\r\nislands, for in that neighbourhood there are a great many, they did not\r\nunderstand one another, for they had no interpreter, for he had been\r\nkilled with Fernan de Magalhāes. Sailing further on amongst islets they\r\ncame to anchor at an island which is named Carpyam,[4] where there is\r\ngold enough, and this island is in fully eight degrees.\r\n\r\nWhilst at anchor in this port of Capyam,[76] they had speech with the\r\ninhabitants of the island, and made peace with them, and Carvalho,\r\nwho was captain-major, gave them the boat of the ship which had been\r\nburnt: this island has three[77] islets in the offing; here they took\r\nin some refreshments, and sailed further on to west south-west, and\r\nfell in with another island, which is named Caram, and is in eleven\r\ndegrees; from this they went on further to west south-west,[78] and\r\nfell in with a large island, and ran along the coast of this island to\r\nthe north-east,[79] and reached as far as nine degrees and a half,[80]\r\nwhere they went ashore one day, with the boats equipped to seek for\r\nprovisions, for in the ships there was now not more than for eight\r\ndays. On reaching shore the inhabitants would not suffer them to land,\r\nand shot at them with arrows of cane hardened in the fire, so that they\r\nreturned to the ships.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, they agreed to go to another island, where they had had\r\nsome dealings, to see if they could get some provisions. Then they met\r\nwith a contrary wind, and going about a league in the direction in\r\nwhich they wished to go, they anchored, and whilst at anchor they saw\r\nthat people on shore were hailing them to go thither; they went there\r\nwith the boats, and as they were speaking to those people by signs,\r\nfor they did not understand each other otherwise, a man at arms, named\r\nJoam de Campos, told them to let him go on shore, since there were\r\nno provisions in the ships, and it might be that they would obtain\r\nsome means of getting provisions; and that if the people killed him,\r\nthey would not lose much with him, for God would take thought of his\r\nsoul; and also if he found provisions, and if they did not kill him,\r\nhe would find means for bringing them to the ships: and they thought\r\nwell of this. So he went on shore, and as soon as he reached it, the\r\ninhabitants received him, and took him into the interior the distance\r\nof a league, and when he was in the village all the people came to\r\nsee him, and they gave him food, and entertained him well, especially\r\nwhen they saw that he ate pig’s flesh; because in this island they had\r\ndealings with the Moors of Borneo, and because the country and people\r\nwere greedy, they made them neither eat pigs nor bring them up in the\r\ncountry. This country is called Dyguasam,[81] and is in nine degrees.\r\n\r\nThe said Christian seeing that he was favoured and well treated by\r\nthe inhabitants, gave them to understand by his signs that they should\r\ncarry provisions to the ships, which would be well paid for. In the\r\ncountry there was nothing except rice not pounded. Then the people set\r\nto pounding rice all the night, and when it was morning they took the\r\nrice and the said Christian, and came to the ships, where they did them\r\ngreat honour, and took in the rice and paid them, and they returned\r\non shore. This man being already set on shore, inhabitants of another\r\nvillage, a little further on, came to the ships and told them to go to\r\ntheir village, and that they would give them much provisions for their\r\nmoney; and as soon as the said man whom they had sent arrived, they set\r\nsail and went to anchor at the village of those who had come to call\r\nthem, which was named Vay Palay Cucara Canbam,[82] where Carvalho made\r\npeace with the king of the country, and they settled the price of the\r\nrice, and they gave them two measures of rice which weighed one hundred\r\nand fourteen pounds[83] for three fathoms of linen stuff of Britanny;\r\nthey took there as much rice as they wanted, and goats and pigs, and\r\nwhilst they were at this place there came a Moor, who had been in the\r\nvillage of Dyguaçam,[84] which belongs to the Moors of Borneo, as has\r\nbeen said above, and after that he went to his country.\r\n\r\nWhile they were at anchor near this village of Diguaçam,[84] there came\r\nto them a parao in which there was a negro named Bastiam, who asked for\r\na flag and a passport for the governor of Diguaçam, and they gave him\r\nall this and other things as a present. They asked the said Bastiam,\r\nwho spoke Portuguese sufficiently well, since he had been in Maluco,\r\nwhere he became a Christian, if he would go with them and shew them\r\nBorneo; he said he would very willingly, and when the departure arrived\r\nhe hid himself, and seeing that he did not come, they set sail from\r\nthis port of Diguaçam on the 21st day of July[85] to seek for Borneo.\r\nAs they set sail there came to them a parao, which was coming to the\r\nport of Diguaçam, and they took it, and in it they took three Moors,\r\nwho said they were pilots, and that they would take them to Borneo.\r\n\r\nHaving got these Moors, they steered along this island to the\r\nsouth-west, and fell in with two islands at its extremity, and passed\r\nbetween them; that on the north side is named Bolyna, and that on the\r\nsouth Bamdym.[86] Sailing to the west south-west a matter of fourteen\r\nleagues, they fell in with a white bottom, which was a shoal below\r\nthe water, and the black men they carried with them told them to draw\r\nnear to the coast of the island, as it was deeper there, and that\r\nwas more in the direction of Borneo, for from that neighbourhood the\r\nisland of Borneo could already be sighted. This same day they reached\r\nand anchored at some islands, to which they gave the name of islets of\r\nSt. Paul, which was a matter of two and a half or three leagues from\r\nthe great island of Borneo, and they were in about seven degrees at\r\nthe south side of these islands. In the island of Borneo there is an\r\nexceedingly great mountain, to which they gave the name of Mount St.\r\nPaul; and from thence they navigated along the coast of Borneo to the\r\nsouth-west, between an island and the island of Borneo itself; and\r\nthey went forward on the same course and reached the neighbourhood of\r\nBorneo,[87] and the Moors whom they had with them told them that there\r\nwas Borneo, and the wind did not suffer them to arrive thither, as it\r\nwas contrary. They anchored at an island which is there, and which may\r\nbe eight leagues from Borneo.\r\n\r\nClose to this island is another which has many myrobolans, and the\r\nnext day they set sail for the other island, which is nearer to the\r\nport of Borneo; and going along thus they saw so many shoals that\r\nthey anchored, and sent the boats ashore in Borneo, and they took the\r\naforesaid Moorish pilots on shore, and there went a Christian with\r\nthem; and the boats went to set them on land, from whence they had to\r\ngo to the city of Borneo, which was three leagues off, and there they\r\nwere taken before the Shahbender of Borneo, and he asked what people\r\nthey were, and for what they came in the ships; and they were presented\r\nto the King of Borneo with the Christian. As soon as the boats had set\r\nthe said men on shore, they sounded in order to see if the ships could\r\ncome in closer: and during this they saw three junks which were coming\r\nfrom the port of Borneo from the said city out to sea, and as soon as\r\nthey saw the ships they returned inshore: continuing to sound, they\r\nfound the channel by which the port is entered; they then set sail, and\r\nentered this channel, and being within the channel they anchored, and\r\nwould not go further in until they received a message from the shore,\r\nwhich arrived next day with two paraos: these carried certain swivel\r\nguns of metal, and a hundred men in each parao, and they brought goats\r\nand fowls, and two cows, and figs, and other fruit, and told them to\r\nenter further in opposite the islands which were near there, which\r\nwas the true berth; and from this position to the city there might be\r\nthree or four leagues. Whilst thus at anchor they established peace,\r\nand settled that they should trade in what there was in the country,\r\nespecially wax, to which they answered that they would willingly sell\r\nall that there was in the country for their money. This port of Borneo\r\nis in eight degrees.\r\n\r\nFor the answer thus received from the King they sent him a present by\r\nGonzalo Mendes Despinosa,[88] captain of the ship Victoria, and the\r\nKing accepted the present, and gave to all of them China stuffs: and\r\nwhen there had passed twenty or twenty-three days that they were there\r\ntrading with the people of the island, and had got five men on shore in\r\nthe city itself, there came to anchor at the bar, close to them, five\r\njunks, at the hour of vespers, and they remained there that evening\r\nand the night until next day in the morning, when they saw coming from\r\nthe city two hundred paraos, some under sail, others rowing. Seeing in\r\nthis manner the five junks and the paraos, it seemed to them that there\r\nmight be treachery, and they set sail for the junks, and as soon as the\r\ncrews of the junks saw them under sail, they also set sail and made off\r\nwhere the wind best served them; and they overhauled one of the junks\r\nwith the boats, and took it with twenty-seven men;[89] and the ships\r\nwent and anchored abreast of the island of the Myrololans, with the\r\njunk made fast to the poop of the flagship, and the paraos returned\r\nto shore, and when night came there came on a squall from the west in\r\nwhich the said junk went to the bottom alongside the flagship, without\r\nbeing able to receive any assistance from it.[90]\r\n\r\nNext day in the morning they saw a sail, and went to it and took it;\r\nthis was a great junk in which the son of the King of Lucam came as\r\ncaptain, and had with him ninety men, and as soon as they took them\r\nthey sent some of them to the King of Borneo; and they sent him word\r\nby these men to send the Christians whom they had got there, who were\r\nseven men, and they would give him all the people whom they had taken\r\nin the junk; on which account the King sent two men of the seven whom\r\nhe had got there in a parao, and they again sent him word to send the\r\nfive men who still remained, and they would send all the people whom\r\nthey had got from the junk. They waited two days for the answer, and\r\nthere came no message; then they took thirty men from the junk, and\r\nput them into a parao belonging to the junk, and sent them to the King\r\nof Borneo, and set sail with fourteen men of those they had taken and\r\nthree women; and they steered along the coast of the said island to\r\nthe north-east, returning backwards; and they again passed between the\r\nislands and the great island of Borneo, where the flagship grounded on\r\na point of the island, and so remained more than four hours, and the\r\ntide turned and it got off, by which it was seen clearly that the tide\r\nwas of twenty-four hours.[91]\r\n\r\nWhilst making the aforesaid course the wind shifted to north-east,\r\nand they stood out to sea, and they saw a sail coming, and the ships\r\nanchored, and the boats went to it and took it; it was a small junk and\r\ncarried nothing but cocoa-nuts; and they took in water and wood, and\r\nset sail along the coast of the island to the north-east, until they\r\nreached the extremity of the said island, and met with another small\r\nisland, where they overhauled the ships. They arrived at this island on\r\nthe day of our Lady of August, and in it they found a very good point\r\nfor beaching the ships, and they gave it the name of Port St. Mary of\r\nAugust, and it is in fully seven degrees.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had taken these precautions they set sail and steered\r\nto the south-west until they sighted the island which is named\r\nFagajam,[92] and this is a course of thirty-eight to forty leagues: and\r\nas soon as they sighted this island they steered to the south-west,\r\nand again made an island which is called Seloque,[93] and they had\r\ninformation that there were many pearls there: and when they had\r\nalready sighted that island the wind shifted to a head-wind, and they\r\ncould not fetch it by the course they were sailing, and it seemed to\r\nthem that it might be in six degrees. This same night they arrived at\r\nthe island of Quipe, and ran along it to the south-east, and passed\r\nbetween it and another island called Tamgym,[94] and always running\r\nalong the coast of the said island, and going thus, they fell in with\r\na parao laden with sago in loaves, which is bread made of a tree which\r\nis named cajare,[95] which the people of that country eat as bread.\r\nThis parao carried twenty-one men, and the chief of them had been in\r\nMaluco in the house of Francisco Serram, and having gone further along\r\nthis island they arrived in sight of some islands which are named\r\nSemrryn;[96] they are in five degrees, a little more or less. The\r\ninhabitants of this land came to see the ships, and so they had speech\r\nof one another, and an old man of these people told them that he would\r\nconduct them to Maluco.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, having fixed a time with the old man, an agreement was\r\nmade with him, and they gave him a certain price for this; and when the\r\nnext day came, and they were to depart, the old man intended to escape,\r\nand they understood it, and took him and others who were with him, and\r\nwho also said that they knew pilot’s work, and they set sail; and as\r\nsoon as the inhabitants saw them go they fitted out to go after them:\r\nand of these paraos there did not reach the ships more than two, and\r\nthese reached so near that they shot arrows into the ships, and the\r\nwind was fresh[97] and they could not come up with them. At midnight of\r\nthat day they sighted some islands, and they steered more towards them;\r\nand next day they saw land, which was an island; and at night following\r\nthat day they found themselves very close to it, and when night fell\r\nthe wind calmed and the currents drew them very much inshore; there the\r\nold pilot cast himself into the sea, and betook himself to land.\r\n\r\nSailing thus forward, after one of the pilots had fled, they sighted\r\nanother island and arrived close to it, and another Moorish pilot\r\nsaid that Maluco was still further on, and navigating thus, the next\r\nday in the morning they sighted three high mountains, which belonged\r\nto a nation of people whom they called the Salabos;[98] and then\r\nthey saw a small island where they anchored to take in some water,\r\nand because they feared that in Maluco they would not be allowed to\r\ntake it in; and they omitted doing so, because the Moorish pilot told\r\nthem that there were some four hundred[99] men in that island, and\r\nthat they were all very bad, and might do them some injury, as they\r\nwere men of little faith; and that he would give them no such advice\r\nas to go to that island; and also because Maluco, which they were\r\nseeking, was now near, and that its kings were good men, who gave a\r\ngood reception to all sorts of men in their country; and while still\r\nin this neighbourhood[100] they saw the islands themselves of Maluco,\r\nand for rejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the\r\nisland[101] on the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from\r\nSeville to Maluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they\r\nsailed on the 10th of August of 1519.[102]\r\n\r\nAs soon as they arrived at the island of Tydor,[103] which is in half\r\na degree, the King thereof did them great honour, which could not be\r\nexceeded: there they treated with the King for their cargo, and the\r\nKing engaged to give them a cargo and whatever there was in the country\r\nfor their money, and they settled to give for the bahar of cloves\r\nfourteen ells of yellow cloth of twenty-seven tem,[104] which are worth\r\nin Castile a ducat the ell; of red cloth of the same kind ten ells;\r\nthey also gave thirty ells of Brittany linen cloth, and for each of\r\nthese quantities they received a bahar of cloves, likewise for thirty\r\nknives eight bahars:[105] having thus settled all the above mentioned\r\nprices, the inhabitants of the country gave them information that\r\nfurther on, in another island near, there was a Portuguese man. This\r\nisland might be two leagues distant, and it was named Targatell;[106]\r\nthis man was the chief person of Maluco; _there we now have got a\r\nfortress_.[107] They then wrote letters to the said Portuguese, to come\r\nand speak with them, to which he answered that he did not dare, because\r\nthe King of the country forbade it; that if they obtained permission\r\nfrom the King he would come at once; this permission they soon got, and\r\nthe Portuguese came to speak with them.[108] They gave him an account\r\nof the prices which they had settled, at which he was amazed, and said\r\nthat on that account the King had ordered him not to come, as they did\r\nnot know the truth about the prices of the country; and whilst they\r\nwere thus taking in cargo there arrived the King of Baraham,[109] which\r\nis near there, and said that he wished to be a vassal of the King of\r\nCastile, and also that he had got four hundred bahars of cloves, and\r\nthat he had sold it to the King of Portugal, and that they had bought\r\nit, but that he had not yet delivered it, and if they wished for it, he\r\nwould give it all to them; to which the captains answered that if he\r\nbrought it to them, and came with it, they would buy it, but otherwise\r\nnot. The King, seeing that they did not wish to take the cloves, asked\r\nthem for a flag and a letter of safe conduct, which they gave him,\r\nsigned by the captains of the ships.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus waiting for the cargo, it seemed to them, from\r\nthe delay in the delivery, that the King was preparing some treachery\r\nagainst them, and the greater part of the ships’ crews made an uproar\r\nand told the captains to go, as the delays which the King made were\r\nfor nothing else than treachery: as it seemed to them all that it\r\nmight be so, they were abandoning everything, and were intending to\r\ndepart; and being about to unfurl the sails, the King, who had made\r\nthe agreement with them, came to the flagship and asked the captain\r\nwhy he wanted to go, because that which he had agreed upon with him he\r\nintended to fulfil it as had been settled. The captain replied that the\r\nships’ crews said they should go and not remain any longer, as it was\r\nonly treachery that was being prepared against them. To this the King\r\nanswered that it was not so, and on that account he at once sent for\r\nhis Koran, upon which he wished to make oath that nothing such should\r\nbe done to them. They at once brought him this Koran, and upon it he\r\nmade oath, and told them to rest at ease with that. At this the crews\r\nwere set at rest, and he promised them that he would give them their\r\ncargo by the 15th December 1521, which he fulfilled within the said\r\ntime without being wanting in anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the two ships were already laden and about to unfurl their sails,\r\nthe flagship[110] sprung a large leak, and the King of the country\r\nlearning this, he sent them twenty-five divers[111] to stop the leak,\r\nwhich they were unable to do. They settled that the other ship should\r\ndepart, and that this one should again discharge all its cargo, and\r\nunload it; and as they could not stop the leak, that they [the people\r\nof the country] should give them all that they might be in need of.\r\nThis was done, and they discharged the cargo of the flagship; and when\r\nthe said ship was repaired, they took in her cargo, and decided on\r\nmaking for the country of the Antilles, and the course from Maluco to\r\nit was 2,000 leagues a little more or less. The other ship, which set\r\nsail first, left on the 21st of December of the said year, and went out\r\nto sea for Timor, and made its course behind Java, 2,055 leagues to the\r\nCape of Good Hope.[112]\r\n\r\nThey refitted the ship, and took in the cargo in four months and\r\nsixteen days: they sailed on the 6th of April of the year 1522, and\r\ntook their course for the mainland of the Antilles by the strait\r\nthrough which they had come; and at first they navigated to the North,\r\nuntil they came out from the islands of Ternate and Tymor;[113]\r\nafterwards they navigated along the island of Betachina, ten or eleven\r\nleagues to the North-east;[114] after that they steered about twenty\r\nleagues to the North-east, and so arrived at an island, which is\r\nnamed Doyz,[115] and is in three and a half degrees South latitude\r\nat its South-eastern side: from this place they navigated three or\r\nfour leagues eastwards, and sighted two islands, one large and the\r\nother small; the large one was named Porquenampello,[116] and passed\r\nbetween it and Batechina, which lay on their starboard side. They\r\nreached a cape, to which they gave the name Cape of Palms, because\r\nthey sighted it on the vigil of Palms. This cape is in two and a half\r\ndegrees: thence they steered to the South to make Quimar,[117] which\r\nis land belonging to the King of Tydor, and the said King had ordered\r\nthat they should receive whatever there was in the country for their\r\nmoney, and there they took pigs and goats, and fowls and cocoa-nuts and\r\n_hava_:[118] they remained in this port eight or nine days. This port\r\nof Camarfya[119] is in one and a quarter degree.\r\n\r\nThey sailed from this port on the 20th[120] of April, and steered\r\nfor about seventeen leagues,[121] and came out of the channel of\r\nthe island of Batechina and the island Charam;[122] and as soon as\r\nthey were outside, they saw that the said island of Charam[123] ran\r\nto the South-east a good eighteen or twenty leagues, and it was not\r\ntheir course, for their direction was to the East[124] and a quarter\r\nNorth-east; and they navigated in the said course some days, and always\r\nfound the winds very contrary for their course. On the 3rd of May they\r\nmade two small islands, which might be in five degrees more or less,\r\nto which they gave the name of islands of St. Antony.[125] Thence they\r\nnavigated further on to the North-east, and arrived at an island which\r\nis named Cyco,[126] which is in fully nineteen degrees, and they made\r\nthis island on the 11th of July.[127] From this island they took a\r\nman, whom they carried away with them, and they navigated further on,\r\ntacking about with contrary winds, until they reached forty-two degrees\r\nNorth latitude.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in this neighbourhood, they were short of bread,\r\nwine, meat, and oil; they had nothing to eat only water and rice,\r\nwithout other provisions; and the cold was great, and they had not\r\nsufficient covering, the crews began to die, and seeing themselves in\r\nthis state, they decided on putting back in the direction of Maluco,\r\nwhich they at once carried into effect. When at a distance of five\r\nhundred leagues from it, they desired to make the island which is named\r\nQuamgragam,[128] and as they sighted it at night, they did not choose\r\nto make it; they waited thus till it dawned next day, and they were\r\nunable to fetch the said island; and the man whom they carried with\r\nthem, and whom before they had taken from that island, told them to go\r\nfurther on, and they would make three islands, where there was a good\r\nport, and this which the black man said, was in order to run away at\r\nthem, as indeed he did run away. On arriving at these three islands,\r\nthey fetched them with some danger, and anchored in the middle of them\r\nin fifteen fathoms. Of these islands, the largest was inhabited by\r\ntwenty persons between men and women: this island is named Pamo;[129]\r\nit is in twenty degrees more or less: here they took in rain-water, as\r\nthere was no other in the country. In this island the black man[130]\r\nran away. Thence they sailed to make the land of Camafo, and as soon\r\nas they sighted it they had calms, and the currents carried them\r\naway from the land; and afterwards they had a little wind, and they\r\nmade for the land, but could not fetch it; they then went to anchor\r\nbetween the islands of Domi and Batechina, and while at anchor, a\r\nparao passed by them with some men who belonged to the King of an\r\nisland named Geilôlo,[131] and they gave them news that the Portuguese\r\nwere in Maluco making a fortress. Learning this, they at once sent\r\nthe clerk of the ship with certain men[132] to the captain-major of\r\nthose Portuguese, who was named Antonio de Bryto, to ask him to come\r\nand bring the ship to the place where they were; because the crew\r\nof the ship had mostly died, and the rest were sick, and could not\r\nnavigate the ship. As soon as Antonio de Bryto saw the letter and\r\nmessage, he sent down Dom Gonzalo[133] Amriquiz, captain of the ship\r\nSam Jorge,[134] and also a fusta with some country parāos, and they\r\nwent thus in search of the ship, and having found it, they brought it\r\nto the fortress, and whilst they were discharging its cargo, there came\r\na squall from the north,[135] which cast it on shore. Where this ship\r\nturned to put back to Maluco was a little more or less than 1050 or\r\n1100 leagues from the island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was transcribed from the paper-book of a Genoese pilot, who came\r\nin the said ship, who wrote all the voyage as it is here. He went to\r\nPortugal in the year 1524 with Dom Amriqui de Menezes.[136] Thanks be\r\nto God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                NARRATIVE OF A PORTUGUESE, COMPANION OF\r\n               ODOARDO BARBOSA, IN THE SHIP _VICTORIA_,\r\n                 IN THE YEAR 1519. (+From “Ramusio”.+)\r\n\r\nIn the name of God and of good salvation. We departed from Seville\r\nwith five ships on the tenth of August, in the year 1519, to go and\r\ndiscover the Molucca Islands. We commenced our voyage from San Lucar\r\nfor the Canary Islands, and sailed south-west 960 miles, where we found\r\nourselves at the island of Tenerife, in which is the harbour of Santa\r\nCruz in twenty-eight degrees of north latitude. And from the island\r\nof Tenerife we sailed southwards 1680 miles, when we found ourselves\r\nin four degrees of north latitude. From these four degrees of north\r\nlatitude we sailed south-west, until we found ourselves at the Cape of\r\nSaint Augustin, which is in eight degrees of south latitude, having\r\naccomplished 1200 miles. And from Cape Saint Augustin we sailed south\r\nand by south-west 864 miles, where we found ourselves in twenty degrees\r\nof south latitude. From twenty degrees of south latitude, being at\r\nsea, we sailed 1500 miles south-west, when we found ourselves near\r\nthe river, whose mouth is 108 miles wide, and lies in thirty-five\r\ndegrees of the said south latitude. We named it the river of Saint\r\nChristopher. From this river we sailed 1638 miles south-west by west,\r\nwhere we found ourselves at the point of the Lupi Marini, which is in\r\nforty-eight degrees of south latitude. And from the point of the Lupi\r\nMarini we sailed south-west 350 miles, where we found ourselves in the\r\nharbour of Saint Julian, and stayed there five months waiting for the\r\nsun to return towards us, because in June and July it appeared for\r\nonly four hours each day. From this harbour of Saint Julian, which is\r\nin fifty degrees, we departed on the 24th of August, 1520, and sailed\r\nwestward a hundred miles, where we found a river to which we gave the\r\nname of River of Santa Cruz, and there we remained until the 18th of\r\nOctober. This river is in fifty degrees. We departed thence on the\r\n18th of October, and sailed along the coast 378 miles south-west by\r\nwest, where we found ourselves in a strait, to which we gave the name\r\nStrait of Victoria, because the ship _Victoria_ was the first that had\r\nseen it: some called it the Strait of Magalhaens, because our captain\r\nwas named Fernando de Magalhaens. The mouth of this strait is in\r\nfifty-three degrees and a half, and we sailed through it 400 miles to\r\nthe other mouth, which is in the same latitude of fifty-three degrees\r\nand a half. We emerged from this strait on the 27th of November, 1520,\r\nand sailed between west and north-west 9858 miles, until we found\r\nourselves upon the equinoctial line. In this course we found two\r\nuninhabited islands, the one of which was distant from the other 800\r\nmiles. To the first we gave the name of Saint Peter, and to the other\r\nthe island of the Tiburones. Saint Peter is in eighteen degrees, the\r\nisland of the Tiburones in fourteen degrees of south latitude. From\r\nthe equinoctial line we sailed between west and north-west 2046 miles,\r\nand discovered several islands between ten and twelve degrees of north\r\nlatitude. In these islands there were many naked people as well men\r\nas women, we gave the islands the name of the Ladrones, because the\r\npeople had robbed our ship: but it cost them very dear. I shall not\r\nrelate further the course that we made, because we lengthened it not\r\na little. But I will tell you that to go direct from these islands of\r\nthe Ladrones to the Moluccas it is necessary to sail south-west a 1000\r\nmiles, and there occur many islands, to which we gave the name of the\r\nArchipelago of Saint Lazarus. A little further there are the islands\r\nof the Moluccas, of which there are five, namely, Ternate, Tidor,\r\nMolir, Machiam, Bachian. In Ternate the Portuguese had built a very\r\nstrong castle before I left. From the Molucca Islands to the islands of\r\nBanda there are three hundred miles, and one goes thither by different\r\ncourses, because there are many islands in between, and one must sail\r\nby sight. In these islands until you reach the islands of Banda, which\r\nare in four degrees and a half of south latitude, there are collected\r\nfrom thirty to forty thousand cantaros of nutmegs annually, and there\r\nis likewise collected much mastic; and if you wish to go to Calicut\r\nyou must always sail amidst the islands as far as Malacca, which is\r\ndistant from the Moluccas 2000 miles, and from Malacca to Calicut are\r\n2000 miles more. From Calicut to Portugal there are 14,000 miles. If\r\nfrom the islands of Banda you wish to round the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nyou must sail between west and south-west until you find yourself in\r\nthirty-four degrees and a half of south latitude, and from there you\r\nsail westward, always keeping a good look-out at the prow not to run\r\naground on the said Cape of Good Hope or its neighbourhood. From this\r\nCape of Good Hope one sails north-west by west 2400 miles, and there\r\nfinds the island of Saint Helena, where Portuguese ships go to take in\r\nwater and wood, and other things. This island is in sixteen degrees\r\nsouth latitude, and there is no habitation except that of a Portuguese\r\nman, who has but one hand and one foot, no nose, and no ears, and is\r\ncalled Fornam-lopem.\r\n\r\nSailing 1600 miles north-west from this island of Saint Helena you\r\nwill find yourself upon the equinoctial line: from which line you\r\nwill sail 3534 miles north-west by north, until you find yourself in\r\nthirty-nine degrees north latitude. And if you wish to go from these\r\nthirty-nine degrees to Lisbon you will sail 950 miles eastward, where\r\nyou will find the islands of the Azores, of which there are seven,\r\nnamely, Terceira, San Jorge, Pico, Fayal, Graciosa, on the east, the\r\nisland of Saint Michael, and the island of Saint Mary, all are between\r\nthirty-seven and forty degrees of north latitude. From the island of\r\nTerceira you will then sail eastward 1100 miles, where you will find\r\nyourself on the land of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   NAVIGATION ET DESCOUUREMENT DE LA\r\n                    INDIE SUPÉRIEURE FAICTE PAR MOY\r\n                    ANTHOYNE PIGAPHETA, VINCENTIN,\r\n                         CHEVALLIER DE RHODES.\r\n\r\n\r\n       +Anthony Pigapheta+, _Patrician of Vicenza, and Knight of\r\n          Rhodes, to the very illustrious and very excellent_\r\n            +Lord Philip de Villers Lisleaden+, _the famous\r\n                   Grand Master of Rhodes, his most\r\n                         respected Lord_.[137]\r\n\r\nSince there are several curious persons (very illustrious and very\r\nreverend lord) who not only are pleased to listen to and learn the\r\ngreat and wonderful things which God has permitted me to see and suffer\r\nin the long and perilous navigation, which I have performed (and which\r\nis written hereafter), but also they desire to learn the methods and\r\nfashions of the road which I have taken in order to go thither, [and\r\nwho do] not grant firm belief to the end unless they are first well\r\nadvised and assured of the commencement. Therefore, my lord, it will\r\nplease you to hear that finding myself in Spain in the year of the\r\nNativity of our Lord, one thousand five hundred and nineteen, at the\r\ncourt of the most serene king[138] of the Romans, with the reverend\r\nlord, Mons. Francis Cheregato,[139] then apostolic proto-notary,\r\nand ambassador of the Pope Leon the Tenth, who, through his virtue,\r\nafterwards arrived at the bishoprick of Aprutino and the principality\r\nof Theramo, and knowing both by the reading of many books and by the\r\nreport of many lettered and well-informed persons who conversed with\r\nthe said proto-notary, the very great and awful things of the ocean, I\r\ndeliberated, with the favour of the Emperor and the above-named lord,\r\nto experiment and go and see with my eyes a part of those things. By\r\nwhich means I could satisfy the desire of the said lords, and mine own\r\nalso. So that it might be said that I had performed the said voyage,\r\nand seen well with my eyes the things hereafter written.\r\n\r\nNow in order to decypher the commencement of my voyage (very\r\nillustrious lord); having heard that there was in the city of Seville,\r\na small armade to the number of five ships, ready to perform this long\r\nvoyage, that is to say, to find the islands of Maluco, from whence\r\nthe spices come: of which armade the captain-general was Fernand de\r\nMagaglianes, a Portuguese gentleman, commander of _St. James of the\r\nSword_, who had performed several voyages in the ocean sea (in which he\r\nhad behaved very honourably as a good man), I set out with many others\r\nin my favour from Barcelona, where at the time the Emperor was, and\r\ncame by sea as far as Malaga, and thence I went away by land until I\r\narrived at the said city of Seville. There I remained for the space of\r\nthree months, waiting till the said armade was in order and readiness\r\nto perform its voyage. And because (very illustrious lord) that on the\r\nreturn from the said voyage, on going to Rome towards the holiness of\r\nour Holy Father,[140] I found your lordship at Monterosa,[141] where\r\nof your favour you gave me a good reception, and afterwards gave me to\r\nunderstand that you desired to have in writing the things which God\r\nof His grace had permitted me to see in my said voyage; therefore to\r\nsatisfy and accede to your desire,[142] I have reduced into this small\r\nbook the principal things, in the best manner that I have been able.\r\n\r\nFinally (very illustrious lord), after all provisions had been made,\r\nand the vessels were in order, the captain-general, a discreet and\r\nvirtuous man, careful of his honour, would not commence his voyage\r\nwithout first making some good and wholesome ordinances, such as it is\r\nthe good custom to make for those who go to sea. Nevertheless he did\r\nnot entirely declare the voyage which he was going to make, so that\r\nhis men should not from amazement and fear be unwilling to accompany\r\nhim on so long a voyage, as he had undertaken in his intention.\r\nConsidering the great and impetuous storms[143] which are on the ocean\r\nsea, where I wished to go; and for another reason also, that is to say\r\nthat the masters and captains of the other ships of his company did\r\nnot love him: of this I do not know the reason, except by cause of\r\nhis, the captain-general, being Portuguese, and they were Spaniards or\r\nCastilians, who for a long time have been in rivalry and ill will with\r\none another. Notwithstanding this all were obedient to him. He made his\r\nordinances such as those which follow, so that during the storms at\r\nsea, which often come on by night and day, his ships should not go away\r\nand separate from one another. These ordinances he published and made\r\nover in writing to each master of the ships, and commanded them to be\r\nobserved and inviolably kept, unless there were great and legitimate\r\nexcuses, and appearance of not having been able to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the said captain-general willed that the vessel in which he\r\nhimself was should go before the other vessels, and that the others\r\nshould follow it; therefore he carried by night on the poop of his\r\nship a torch or faggot of burning wood, which they called farol, which\r\nburned all the night, so that his ships should not lose sight of him.\r\nSometimes he set a lantern, sometimes a thick cord of reeds[144] was\r\nlighted, which was called trenche.[145] This is made of reeds well\r\nsoaked in the water, and much beaten, then they are dried in the sun or\r\nin the smoke, and it is a thing very suitable for such a matter. When\r\nthe captain had made one of his signals to his people, they answered\r\nin the same way. In that manner they knew whether the ships were\r\nfollowing and keeping together or not. And when he wished to take a\r\ntack on account of the change of weather, or if the wind was contrary,\r\nor if he wished to make less way, he had two lights shown; and if he\r\nwished the others to lower their small sail,[146] which was a part of\r\nthe sail attached to the great sail, he showed three lights. Also by\r\nthe three lights, notwithstanding that the wind was fair for going\r\nfaster, he signalled that the studding sail should be lowered; so that\r\nthe great sail might be quicker and more easily struck and furled when\r\nbad weather should suddenly set in, on account of some squall[147] or\r\notherwise. Likewise when the captain wished the other ships to lower\r\nthe sail he had four lights shown, which shortly after he had put out\r\nand then showed a single one, which was a signal that he wished to stop\r\nthere and turn, so that the other ships might do as he did. Withal,\r\nwhen he discovered any land, or shoal, that is to say, a rock at sea,\r\nhe made several lights be shown or had a bombard fired off. If he\r\nwished to make sail, he signalled to the other ships with four lights,\r\nso that they should do as he did, and follow him. He always carried\r\nthis said lantern suspended to the poop of his vessel. Also when he\r\nwished the studding sail to be replaced with the great sail, he showed\r\nthree lights. And to know whether all the ships followed him and were\r\ncoming together, he showed one light only besides the fanol, and then\r\neach of the ships showed another light, which was an answering signal.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned ordinances for carrying on seamanship as\r\nis fitting, and to avoid the dangers which may come upon those who do\r\nnot keep watch, the said captain, who was expert in the things required\r\nfor navigation, ordered that three watches should be kept at night. The\r\nfirst was at the beginning of the night, the second at midnight, and\r\nthe third towards break of day, which is commonly called _La diane_,\r\notherwise the star of the break of day. Every night these watches\r\nwere changed; that is to say, he who had kept the first watch, on the\r\nfollowing day kept the second, and he who had kept the second kept\r\nthe third; and so on they changed continually every night. The said\r\ncaptain commanded that his regulations both for the signals and the\r\nwatches should be well observed, so that their voyage should be made\r\nwith greater security. The crews of this fleet were divided into three\r\ncompanies; the first belonged to the captain, the second to the pilot\r\nor _nochier_, and the third to the master. These regulations having\r\nbeen made, the captain-general deliberated on sailing, as follows.\r\n\r\nMonday, the day of St. Laurence, the 10th of August, in the year\r\nabove mentioned, the fleet, provided with what was necessary for it,\r\nand carrying crews of different nations, to the number of two hundred\r\nand thirty-seven men in all the five ships, was ready to set sail from\r\nthe mole of Seville; and firing all the artillery, we made sail only\r\non the foremast, and came to the end of a river named Betis, which\r\nis now called Guadalcavir. In going along this river we passed by a\r\nplace named Gioan de Farax, where there was[148] a large population of\r\nMoors, and there there was a bridge over the river by which one went to\r\nSeville. This bridge was ruined, however there had remained two columns\r\nwhich are at the bottom of the water, on which account it is necessary\r\nto have people of the country of experience and knowledge to point out\r\nthe convenient spot for safely passing between these two columns, from\r\nfear of striking against them. Besides that, it is necessary in order\r\nto pass safely by this bridge and by other places on this river, that\r\nthe water should be rather high. After having passed the two columns we\r\ncame to another place named Coria, and passing by many little villages\r\nlying along the said river, at last we arrived at a castle, which\r\nbelongs to the Duke of Medina Sidonia, named St. Lucar, where there is\r\na port from which to enter the ocean sea. It is entered by the east\r\nwind and you go out by the west wind. Near there is the cape of St.\r\nVincent, which, according to cosmography, is in thirty-seven degrees\r\nof latitude, at twenty miles distance from the said port; and from\r\nthe aforesaid town to this port by the river there are thirty-five or\r\nforty miles. A few days afterwards the captain-general came along the\r\nsaid river with his boat, and the masters of the other ships with him,\r\nand we remained some days in this port to supply the fleet with some\r\nnecessary things. We went every day to hear mass on shore, at a church\r\nnamed Our Lady of Barrameda, towards St. Lucar. There the captain\r\ncommanded that all the men of the fleet should confess before going on\r\nany further, in which he himself showed the way to the others. Besides\r\nhe did not choose that anyone should bring any married woman, or others\r\nto the ships, for several good considerations.\r\n\r\nTuesday, the 20th September of the said year,[149] we set sail\r\nfrom St. Lucar, making the course of the south-west otherwise named\r\nLabeiche;[150] and on the twenty-sixth of the said month we arrived at\r\nan island of great Canaria, named Teneriphe, which is in twenty-eight\r\ndegrees latitude; there we remained three days and a half to take in\r\nprovisions and other things which were wanted. After that we set sail\r\nthence and came to a port named Monterose, where we sojourned two days\r\nto supply ourselves with pitch, which is a thing necessary for ships.\r\nIt is to be known that among the other isles which are at the said\r\ngreat Canaria, there is one, where not a drop of water is to be found\r\nproceeding from a fountain or a river, only once a day at the hour of\r\nmidday, there descends a cloud from the sky which envelops a large tree\r\nwhich is in this island, and it falls upon the leaves of the tree, and\r\na great abundance of water distils from these leaves, so that at the\r\nfoot of the tree there is so large a quantity of water that it seems as\r\nif there was an ever-running fountain. The men who inhabit this place\r\nare satisfied with this water; also the animals, both domestic and\r\nwild, drink of it.\r\n\r\nMonday, the third of October of the said year, at the hour of\r\nmidnight, we set sail, making the course auster, which the levantine\r\nmariners call Siroc,[151] entering into the ocean sea. We passed\r\nthe Cape Verd and the neighbouring islands in fourteen-and-a-half\r\ndegrees, and we navigated for several days by the coast of Guinea or\r\nEthiopia; where there is a mountain called Sierra Leona, which is in\r\neight degrees latitude according to the art and science of cosmography\r\nand astrology. Sometimes we had the wind contrary and at other times\r\nsufficiently good, and rains without wind. In this manner we navigated\r\nwith rain for the space of sixty days until the equinoctial line, which\r\nwas a thing very strange and unaccustomed to be seen, according to the\r\nsaying of some old men and those who had navigated here several times.\r\nNevertheless, before reaching this equinoctial line we had in fourteen\r\ndegrees a variety of weather and bad winds, as much on account of\r\nsqualls as for the head winds and currents which came in such a manner\r\nthat we could no longer advance. In order that our ships might not\r\nperish nor broach to[152] (as it often happens when the squalls come\r\ntogether), we struck our sails, and in that manner we went about the\r\nsea hither and thither until the fair weather came. During the calm\r\nthere came large fishes near the ships which they called _Tiburoni_\r\n(sharks), which have teeth of a terrible kind, and eat people when\r\nthey find them in the sea either alive or dead. These fishes are\r\ncaught with a device which the mariners call hamc, which is a hook of\r\niron. Of these, some were caught by our men. However, they are worth\r\nnothing to eat when they are large; and even the small ones are worth\r\nbut little. During these storms the body of St. Anselme appeared to\r\nus several times; amongst others, one night that it was very dark on\r\naccount of the bad weather, the said saint appeared in the form of a\r\nfire lighted at the summit of the mainmast,[153] and remained there\r\nnear two hours and a half, which comforted us greatly, for we were in\r\ntears, only expecting the hour of perishing; and when that holy light\r\nwas going away from us it gave out so great a brilliancy in the eyes\r\nof each, that we were near a quarter-of-an-hour like people blinded,\r\nand calling out for mercy. For without any doubt nobody hoped to escape\r\nfrom that storm. It is to be noted that all and as many times as that\r\nlight which represents the said St. Anselme shows itself and descends\r\nupon a vessel which is in a storm at sea, that vessel never is lost.\r\nImmediately that this light had departed the sea grew calmer, and then\r\nwe saw divers sorts of birds, amongst others there were some which had\r\nno fundament.[154] There is also another kind of bird of such a nature\r\nthat when the female wishes to lay her eggs she goes and lays them on\r\nthe back of the male, and there it is that the eggs are hatched. This\r\nlast kind have no feet and are always in the sea. There is another kind\r\nof bird which only lives on the droppings of the other birds, this is\r\na true thing, and they are named Cagaselo, for I have seen them follow\r\nthe other birds until they had done what nature ordered them to do;\r\nand after it has eat this dirty diet it does not follow any other bird\r\nuntil hunger returns to it; it always does the same thing.[155] There\r\nare also fish which fly, and we saw a great quantity of them together,\r\nso many that it seemed that it was an island in the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter that we had passed the equinoctial line, towards the south, we\r\nlost the star of the tramontana, and we navigated between the south\r\nand Garbin, which is the collateral wind [or point] between south and\r\nwest; and we crossed as far as a country named Verzin, which is in\r\ntwenty-four degrees and a half of the antarctic sky. This country is\r\nfrom the cape St. Augustine, which is in eight degrees in the antarctic\r\nsky. At this place we had refreshments of victuals, like fowls and\r\nmeat of calves,[156] also a variety of fruits, called battate, pigne\r\n(pine-apples), sweet, of singular goodness, and many other things,\r\nwhich I have omitted mentioning, not to be too long. The people of the\r\nsaid place gave, in order to have a knife, or a hook[157] for catching\r\nfish, five or six fowls, and for a comb they gave two geese, and for a\r\nsmall mirror, or a pair of scissors, they gave so much fish that ten\r\nmen could have eaten of it. And for a bell (or hawk’s-bell)[158] they\r\ngave a full basket[159] of the fruit named battate; this has the taste\r\nof a chestnut, and is of the length of a shuttle.[160] For a king of\r\ncards, of that kind which they used to play with in Italy, they gave me\r\nfive fowls, and thought they had cheated me. We entered into this port\r\nthe day of Saint Lucy[161] [13th December], before Christmas, on which\r\nday we had the sun on the zenith,[162] which is a term of astrology.\r\nThis zenith is a point in the sky, according to astrologers, and only\r\nin imagination, and it answers to over our head in a straight line,\r\nas may be seen by the treatise of the sphere,[163] and by Aristotle,\r\nin the first book, _De Cælo et Mondo_. On the day that we had the sun\r\nin the zenith we felt greater heat, as much as when we were on the\r\nequinoctial line.\r\n\r\nThe said country of Verzin is very abundant in all good things, and\r\nis larger than France, Spain, and Italy together. It is one of the\r\ncountries which the King of Portugal has conquered [acquired]. Its\r\ninhabitants are not Christians, and adore nothing, but live according\r\nto the usage of nature, rather bestially than otherwise. Some of these\r\npeople live a hundred, or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and forty\r\nyears, and more; they go naked, both men and women. Their dwellings\r\nare houses that are rather long, and which they call “boy”; they sleep\r\nupon cotton nets, which they call, in their language, “amache.” These\r\nnets are fastened to large timbers from one end of their house to the\r\nother. They make the fire to warm themselves right under their bed. It\r\nis to be known that in each of these houses, which they call “boy,”\r\nthere dwells a family of a hundred persons, who make a great noise. In\r\nthis place they have boats, which are made of a tree, all in one piece,\r\nwhich they call “canoo.” These are not made with iron instruments, for\r\nthey have not got any, but with stones, like pebbles, and with these\r\nthey plane[164] and dig out these boats. Into these thirty or forty\r\nmen enter, and their oars are made like iron shovels: and those who\r\nrow these oars are black people, quite naked and shaven, and look like\r\nenemies of hell. The men and women of this said place are well made in\r\ntheir bodies. They eat the flesh of their enemies, not as good meat,\r\nbut because they have adopted this custom. Now this custom arose as\r\nfollows: an old woman of this place of Verzin had an only son, who was\r\nkilled by his enemies, and, some days afterwards, the friends of this\r\nwoman captured one of the said enemies who had put her son to death,\r\nand brought him to where she was. Immediately the said old woman,\r\nseeing the man who was captured, and recollecting the death of her\r\nchild, rushed upon him like a mad dog, and bit him on the shoulder.\r\nHowever, this man who had been taken prisoner found means to run away,\r\nand told how they had wished to eat him, showing the bite which the\r\nsaid old woman had made in his shoulder. After that those who were\r\ncaught on one side or other were eaten. Through that arose this custom\r\nin this place of eating the enemies of each other. But they do not eat\r\nup the whole body of the man whom they take prisoner; they eat him bit\r\nby bit, and for fear that he should be spoiled, they cut him up into\r\npieces, which they set to dry in the chimney, and every day they cut a\r\nsmall piece, and eat it with their ordinary victuals in memory of their\r\nenemies. I was assured that this custom was true by a pilot, named John\r\nCarvagio, who was in our company, and had remained four years in this\r\nplace; it is also to be observed that the inhabitants of this place,\r\nboth men and women, are accustomed to paint themselves with fire, all\r\nover the body, and also the face. The men are shaven, and wear no\r\nbeard, because they pluck it out themselves, and for all clothing they\r\nwear a circle surrounded with the largest feathers of parrots,[165] and\r\nthey only cover their posterior parts, which is a cause of laughter and\r\nmockery. The people of this place, almost all, excepting[166] women\r\nand children, have three holes in the lower lip, and carry, hanging\r\nin them, small round stones, about a finger in length. These kind of\r\npeople, both men and women, are not very black, but rather brown,[167]\r\nand they openly show their shame, and have no hair on the whole of\r\ntheir bodies. The king of this country is called Cacich, and there are\r\nhere an infinite number of parrots, of which they give eight or ten for\r\na looking-glass; there are also some little cat-monkeys[168] having\r\nalmost the appearance of a lion; they are yellow, and handsome, and\r\nagreeable to look at. The people of this place make bread, which is\r\nof a round shape, and they take the marrow of certain trees which are\r\nthere, between the bark and the tree, but it is not at all good, and\r\nresembles fresh cheese. There are also some pigs which have their navel\r\non the back,[169] and large birds which have their beak like a spoon,\r\nand they have no tongue. For a hatchet or for a knife they used to give\r\nus one or two of their daughters as slaves, but their wives they would\r\nnot give up for anything in the world. According to what they say the\r\nwomen of this place never render duty to their husbands by day, but\r\nonly at night; they attend to business out of doors, and carry all that\r\nthey require for their husband’s victuals inside small baskets on their\r\nheads, or fastened to their heads. Their husbands go with them, and\r\ncarry a bow of vergin,[170] or of black palm, with a handful of arrows\r\nof cane. They do this because they are very jealous of their wives.\r\nThese carry their children fastened to their neck, and they are inside\r\na thing made of cotton in the manner of a net. I omit relating many\r\nother strange things, not to be too prolix; however, I will not forget\r\nto say that mass was said twice on shore, where there were many people\r\nof the said country, who remained on their knees, and their hands\r\njoined in great reverence, during the mass, so that it was a pleasure\r\nand a subject of compassion to see them. In a short time they built a\r\nhouse for us, as they imagined that we should remain a long time with\r\nthem, and, at our departure thence, they gave us a large quantity of\r\nverzin. It is a colour which proceeds from the trees which are in this\r\ncountry, and they are in such quantity that the country is called from\r\nit Verzin.\r\n\r\nIt is to be known that it happened that it had not rained for two\r\nmonths before we came there, and the day that we arrived it began\r\nto rain, on which account the people of the said place said that we\r\ncame from heaven, and had brought the rain with us, which was great\r\nsimplicity, and these people were easily converted to the Christian\r\nfaith. Besides the above-mentioned things which were rather simple,\r\nthe people of this country showed us another, very simple; for they\r\nimagined that the small ships’ boats were the children of the ships,\r\nand that the said ships brought them forth when the boats were hoisted\r\nout to send the men hither and thither; and when the boats were\r\nalongside the ship they thought that the ships were giving them suck.\r\n\r\nA beautiful young girl came one day inside the ship of our captain,\r\nwhere I was, and did not come except to seek for her luck: however,\r\nshe directed her looks to the cabin of the master, and saw a nail of a\r\nfinger’s length, *and went and took it as something valuable and new,\r\nand hid it in her hair, for otherwise she would not have been able to\r\nconceal[171] it, because she was naked,* and, bending forwards, she\r\nwent away; and the captain and I saw this mystery.[172]\r\n\r\n                +Some Words of this People of Verzin.+\r\n\r\n                                                _Milan Edition._\r\n  Millet                Au mil        Maize.\r\n  Flour                 Farine        Huy.\r\n  A hook                Ung haim      Pinda.\r\n  A knife               Ung coutteau  Taesse      Tarse.\r\n  A comb                Ung peigne    Chignap     Chipag.\r\n  A fork                Une forcette  Pirame.\r\n  A bell                Une sonnette  Itemnaraca  Hanmaraca.\r\n  Good, more than good  Bon, plus que bon tum maraghatom.\r\n\r\nWe remained thirteen days in this country of Verzin, and, departing\r\nfrom it and following our course, we went as far as thirty-four degrees\r\nand a third towards the antarctic pole; there we found, near a river,\r\nmen whom they call “cannibals,”[173] who eat human flesh, and one of\r\nthese men, great as a giant, came to the captain’s ship to ascertain\r\nand ask if the others might come. This man had a voice like a bull, and\r\nwhilst this man was at the ship his companions carried off all their\r\ngoods which they had to a castle further off, from fear of us. Seeing\r\nthat, we landed a hundred men from the ships, and went after them to\r\ntry and catch some others; however they gained in running away. This\r\nkind of people did more with one step than we could do at a bound. In\r\nthis same river there were seven little islands, and in the largest\r\nof them precious stones are found. This place was formerly called the\r\nCape of St. Mary, and it was thought there that from thence there was a\r\npassage to the Sea of Sur; that is to say, the South Sea. And it is not\r\nfound that any ship has ever discovered anything more, having passed\r\nbeyond the said cape. And now it is no longer a cape, but it is a river\r\nwhich has a mouth seventeen leagues in width, by which it enters into\r\nthe sea. In past time, in this river, these great men named Canibali\r\nate a Spanish captain, named John de Sola,[174] and sixty men who had\r\ngone to discover land, as we were doing, and trusted too much to them.\r\n\r\nAfterwards following the same course towards the Antarctic pole, going\r\nalong the land, we found two islands full of geese and goslings, and\r\nsea wolves, of which geese the large number could not be reckoned;\r\nfor we loaded all the five ships with them in an hour. These geese\r\nare black, and have their feathers all over the body of the same size\r\nand shape, and they do not fly, and live upon fish; and they were so\r\nfat that they did not pluck them, but skinned them. They have beaks\r\nlike that of a crow. The sea wolves of these two islands are of many\r\ncolours, and of the size and thickness of a calf, and have a head like\r\nthat of a calf, and the ears small and round. They have large teeth,\r\nand have no legs, but feet joining close on to the body, which resemble\r\na human hand; they have small nails to their feet, and skin between the\r\nfingers like geese. If these animals could run they would be very bad\r\nand cruel, but they do not stir from the water, and swim and live upon\r\nfish. In this place we endured a great storm, and thought we should\r\nhave been lost, but the three holy bodies, that is to say, St. Anselmo,\r\nSt. Nicolas, and Sta. Clara, appeared to us, and immediately the storm\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nDeparting thence as far as forty nine degrees and a half in the\r\nAntarctic heavens (as we were in the winter), we entered into a port\r\nto pass the winter, and remained there two whole months without ever\r\nseeing anybody. However, one day, without anyone expecting it, we\r\nsaw a giant, who was on the shore of the sea, quite naked, and was\r\ndancing and leaping, and singing, and whilst singing he put the sand\r\nand dust on his head. Our captain sent one of his men towards him,\r\nwhom he charged to sing and leap like the other to reassure him, and\r\nshow him friendship. This he did, and immediately the sailor led this\r\ngiant to a little island where the captain was waiting for him; and\r\nwhen he was before us he began to be astonished, and to be afraid, and\r\nhe raised one finger on high,[175] thinking that we came from heaven.\r\nHe was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his waist;[176]\r\nhowever[177] he was well built. He had a large face, painted red all\r\nround, and his eyes also were painted yellow around them, and he had\r\ntwo hearts painted on his cheeks; he had but little hair on his head,\r\nand it was painted white. When he was brought before the captain he\r\nwas clothed with the skin of a certain beast, which skin was very\r\nskilfully sewed. This beast[178] has its head and ears of the size of\r\na mule, and the neck and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a\r\ndeer, and the tail like that of a horse, and it neighs like a horse.\r\nThere is a great quantity of these animals in this same place. This\r\ngiant had his feet covered with the skin of this animal in the form of\r\nshoes, and he carried in his hand a short and thick bow, with a thick\r\ncord made of the gut of the said beast, with a bundle of cane arrows,\r\nwhich were not very long, and were feathered like ours,[179] but they\r\nhad no iron at the end, though they had at the end some small white and\r\nblack cut stones, and these arrows were like those which the Turks use.\r\nThe captain caused food and drink to be given to this giant, then they\r\nshowed him some things, amongst others, a steel mirror. When the giant\r\nsaw his likeness in it, he was greatly terrified, leaping backwards,\r\nand made three or four of our men fall down.\r\n\r\nAfter that the captain gave him two bells, a mirror, a comb, and a\r\nchaplet of beads, and sent him back on shore, having him accompanied by\r\nfour armed men. One of the companions of this giant, who would never\r\ncome to the ship, on seeing the other coming back with our people, came\r\nforward and ran to where the other giants dwelled. These came one after\r\nthe other all naked, and began to leap and sing, raising one finger to\r\nheaven, and showing to our people a certain white powder made of the\r\nroots of herbs, which they kept in earthen pots, and they made signs\r\nthat they lived on that, and that they had nothing else to eat than\r\nthis powder. Therefore our people made them signs to come to the ship\r\nand that they would help them to carry their bundles.[180] Then these\r\nmen came, who carried only their bows in their hands; but their wives\r\ncame after them laden like donkeys, and carried their goods. These\r\nwomen are not as tall as the men, but they are very sufficiently large.\r\nWhen we saw them we were all amazed and astonished, for they had the\r\nbreasts half an ell[181] long, and had their faces painted, and were\r\ndressed like the men. But they wore a small skin before them to cover\r\nthemselves. They brought with them four of those little beasts of which\r\nthey make their clothing, and they led them with a cord in the manner\r\nof dogs coupled together. When these people wish to catch these animals\r\nwith which they clothe themselves, they fasten one of the young ones\r\nto a bush, and afterwards the large ones come to play with the little\r\none, and the giants are hid behind some hedge, and by shooting their\r\narrows they kill the large ones. Our men brought eighteen of these\r\ngiants, both men and women, whom they placed in two divisions, half on\r\none side of the port, and the other half at the other, to hunt the said\r\nanimals. Six days after, our people on going to cut wood, saw another\r\ngiant, with his face painted and clothed like the above-mentioned, he\r\nhad in his hand a bow and arrows, and approaching our people he made\r\nsome touches on his head and then on his body, and afterwards did the\r\nsame to our people. And this being done he raised both his hands to\r\nheaven. When the captain-general knew all this, he sent to fetch him\r\nwith his ship’s boat, and brought him to one of the little islands\r\nwhich are in the port, where the ships were. In this island the captain\r\nhad caused a house to be made for putting some of the ships’ things in\r\nwhilst he remained there. This giant was of a still better disposition\r\nthan the others, and was a gracious and amiable person, who liked to\r\ndance and leap. When he leapt he caused the earth to sink in a palm\r\ndepth at the place where his feet touched. He was a long time with us,\r\nand at the end we baptised him, and gave him the name of John. This\r\ngiant pronounced the name of Jesus, the Pater noster, Ave Maria, and\r\nhis name as clearly as we did: but he had a terribly strong and loud\r\nvoice. The captain gave him a shirt and a tunic[182] of cloth, and\r\nseaman’s breeches,[183] a cap, a comb, some bells, and other things,\r\nand sent him back to where he had come from. He went away very joyous\r\nand satisfied. The next day this giant returned, and brought one of\r\nthose large animals before mentioned, for which the captain gave him\r\nsome other things, so that he should bring more. But afterwards he did\r\nnot return, and it is to be presumed that the other giants killed him\r\nbecause he had come to us.\r\n\r\nFifteen days later we saw four other giants, who carried no arrows,\r\nfor they had hid them in the bushes, as two of them showed us, for we\r\ntook them all four, and each of them was painted in a different way.\r\nThe captain retained the two younger ones to take them to Spain on his\r\nreturn; but it was done by gentle and cunning means, for otherwise\r\nthey would have done a hurt to some of our men. The manner in which\r\nhe retained them was that he gave them many knives, forks, mirrors,\r\nbells, and glass, and they held all these things in their hands. Then\r\nthe captain had some irons brought, such as are put on the feet of\r\nmalefactors: these giants took pleasure in seeing the irons, but they\r\ndid not know where to put them, and it grieved them that they could not\r\ntake them with their hands, because they were hindered by the other\r\nthings which they held in them. The other two giants were there, and\r\nwere desirous of helping the other two, but the captain would not let\r\nthem, and made a sign to the two whom he wished to detain that they\r\nwould put those irons on their feet, and then they would go away:\r\nat this they made a sign with their heads that they were content.\r\nImmediately the captain had the irons put on the feet of both of them,\r\nand when they saw that they were striking with a hammer on the bolt\r\nwhich crosses the said irons to rivet them, and prevent them from\r\nbeing opened, these giants were afraid, but the captain made them a\r\nsign not to doubt of anything. Nevertheless when they saw the trick\r\nwhich had been played them, they began to be enraged,[184] and to\r\nfoam like bulls, crying out very loud Setebos,[185] that is to say,\r\nthe great devil, that he should help them. The hands of the other two\r\ngiants were bound, but it was with great difficulty; then the captain\r\nsent them back on shore, with nine of his men to conduct them, and to\r\nbring the wife of one of those who had remained in irons, because he\r\nregretted her greatly, as we saw by signs. But in going away one of\r\nthose two who were sent away, untied his hands and escaped, running\r\nwith such lightness that our men lost sight of him, and he went away\r\nwhere his companions were staying; but he found nobody of those that\r\nhe had left with the women because they had gone to hunt. However he\r\nwent to look for them, and found them, and related to them all that\r\nhad been done to them. The other giant whose hands were tied struggled\r\nas much as he could to unfasten himself, and to prevent his doing so,\r\none of our men struck him, and hurt him on the head, at which he got\r\nvery angry; however he led our people there where their wives were.\r\nThen John Cavagio,[186] the pilot who was the chief conductor of these\r\ntwo giants, would not bring away the wife of one of the giants who had\r\nremained in irons on that evening, but was of opinion that they should\r\nsleep there, because it was almost night. During this time the one of\r\nthe giants who had untied his hands came back from where he had been,\r\nwith another giant, and they seeing their companion wounded on the\r\nhead, said nothing at that moment, but next morning they spoke in their\r\nlanguage to the women, and immediately all ran away together, and the\r\nsmallest ran faster than the biggest, and they left all their chattels.\r\nTwo of these giants being rather a long way off shot arrows at our men,\r\nand fighting thus, one of the giants pierced with an arrow the thigh\r\nof one of our men, of which he died immediately. Then seeing that he\r\nwas dead, all ran away. Our men had cross-bows and guns,[187] but they\r\nnever could hit one of these giants, because they did not stand still\r\nin one place, but leaped hither and thither. After that, our men buried\r\nthe man who had been killed, and set fire to the place where those\r\ngiants had left their chattels. Certainly these giants run faster than\r\na horse, and they are very jealous of their wives.\r\n\r\nWhen these giants have a stomach-ache, instead of taking medicine they\r\nput down their throats an arrow about two feet long; then they vomit a\r\ngreen bile[188] mixed with blood: and the reason why they throw up this\r\ngreen matter is because they sometimes eat thistles. When they have\r\nheadaches they make a cut across the forehead, and also on the arms\r\nand legs, to draw blood from several parts of their bodies. One of the\r\ntwo we had taken, and who was in our ship, said that the blood did not\r\nchoose to remain in the place and spot of the body where pain was felt.\r\nThese people have their hair cut short and clipped in the manner of\r\nmonks with a tonsure: they wear a cord of cotton round their head, to\r\nthis they hang their arrows when they go a-hunting....[189]\r\n\r\nWhen one of them dies, ten or twelve devils appear and dance all round\r\nthe dead man. It seems that these are painted, and one of these enemies\r\nis taller than the others, and makes a greater noise, and more mirth\r\nthan the others: that is whence these people have taken the custom\r\nof painting their faces and bodies, as has been said. The greatest\r\nof these devils is called in their language Setebos, and the others\r\nCheleule. Besides the above-mentioned things, this one who was in\r\nthe ship with us, told us by signs that he had seen devils with two\r\nhorns on their heads, and long hair down to their feet, and who threw\r\nout fire from their mouths and rumps. The captain named this kind of\r\npeople Pataghom,[190] who have no houses, but have huts made of the\r\nskins of the animals with which they clothe themselves, and go hither\r\nand thither with these huts of theirs, as the gypsies[191] do; they\r\nlive on raw meat, and eat a certain sweet root, which they call Capac.\r\nThese two giants that we had in the ship ate a large basketful[192] of\r\nbiscuit, and rats without skinning them, and they drank half a bucket\r\nof water at each time.\r\n\r\nWe remained in this port, which was called the port of St. Julian,\r\nabout five months, during which there happened to us many strange\r\nthings, of which I will tell a part. One was, that immediately that we\r\nentered into this port, the masters of the other four ships plotted\r\ntreason against the captain-general, in order to put him to death.\r\nThese were thus named: John of Carthagine, conductor[193] of the fleet;\r\nthe treasurer, Loys de Mendoza; the conductor,[194] Anthony Cocha; and\r\nGaspar de Casada.[195] However, the treason was discovered, for which\r\nthe treasurer was killed with stabs of a dagger, and then quartered.\r\nThis Gaspar de Casada had his head cut off, and afterwards was cut into\r\nquarters; and the conductor having a few days later attempted another\r\ntreason, was banished with a priest, and was put in that country called\r\nPattagonia.[196] The captain-general would not put this conductor to\r\ndeath, because the Emperor Charles had made him captain of one of the\r\nships. One of our ships, named St. James, was lost in going to discover\r\nthe coast; all the men, however, were saved by a miracle, for they\r\nwere hardly wet at all. Two men of these, who were saved, came to us\r\nand told us all that had passed and happened, on which the captain at\r\nonce sent some men with sacks full of biscuit for two months. So, each\r\nday we found something of the ship of the other men who had escaped\r\nfrom the ship which was lost; and the place where these men were was\r\ntwenty-five leagues from us, and the road bad and full of thorns,\r\nand it required four days to go there, and no water to drink was to\r\nbe found on the road, but only ice, and of that little. In this port\r\nof St Julian there were a great quantity of long capres,[197] called\r\nMissiglione; these had pearls in the midst. In this place they found\r\nincense, and ostriches, foxes, sparrows, and rabbits[198] a good deal\r\nsmaller than ours.[199] We set up at the top of the highest mountain\r\nwhich was there a very large cross, as a sign that this country\r\nbelonged to the King of Spain; and we gave to this mountain the name of\r\nMount of Christ.\r\n\r\nDeparting thence, we found in fifty-one degrees less one-third (50°\r\n40′ S.), in the Antarctic, a river of fresh water, which was near\r\ncausing us to be lost, from the great winds which it sent out; but\r\nGod, of his favour, aided us. We were about two months in this river,\r\nas it supplied fresh water and a kind of fish an ell long, and very\r\nscaly,[200] which is good to eat. Before going away, the captain chose\r\nthat all should confess and receive the body of our Lord like good\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER.[201]\r\n\r\nAfter going and taking the course to the fifty-second degree of the\r\nsaid Antarctic sky, on the day of the Eleven Thousand Virgins [October\r\n21], we found, by a miracle, a strait which we called the Cape of the\r\nEleven Thousand Virgins, this strait is a hundred and ten leagues long,\r\nwhich are four hundred and forty miles, and almost as wide as less than\r\nhalf a league,[202] and it issues in another sea, which is called the\r\npeaceful sea;[203] it is surrounded by very great and high mountains\r\ncovered with snow. In this place it was not possible to anchor[204]\r\nwith the anchors, because no bottom was found, on which account they\r\nwere forced to put the moorings[205] of twenty-five or thirty fathoms\r\nlength on shore. This strait was a round place surrounded by mountains,\r\nas I have said, and the greater number of the sailors thought that\r\nthere was no place by which to go out thence to enter into the peaceful\r\nsea. But the captain-general said that there was another strait for\r\ngoing out, and said that he knew it well, because he had seen it by\r\na marine chart of the King of Portugal, which map had been made by a\r\ngreat pilot and mariner named Martin of Bohemia.[206] The captain sent\r\non before two of his ships, one named _St. Anthony_ and the other the\r\n_Conception_, to seek for and discover the outlet of this strait, which\r\nwas called the Cape de la Baya. And we, with the other two ships, that\r\nis to say, the flagship named _Trinitate_, and the other the _Victory_,\r\nremained waiting for them within the Bay, where in the night we had\r\na great storm, which lasted till the next day at midday, and during\r\nwhich we were forced to weigh the anchors and let the ships go hither\r\nand thither about the bay. The other two ships met with such a head\r\nwind[207] that they could not weather[208] a cape which the bay made\r\nalmost at its extremity; wishing to come to us, they were near being\r\ndriven to beach the ships.[209] But, on approaching the extremity of\r\nthe bay, and whilst expecting to be lost, they saw a small mouth, which\r\ndid not resemble a mouth but a corner,[210] and (like people giving\r\nup hope[211]) they threw themselves into it, so that by force they\r\ndiscovered the strait. Seeing that it was not a corner, but a strait of\r\nland, they went further on and found a bay, then going still further\r\nthey found another strait and another bay larger than the first two, at\r\nwhich, being very joyous, they suddenly returned backwards to tell it\r\nto the captain-general. Amongst us we thought that they had perished:\r\nfirst, because of the great storm; next, because two days had passed\r\nthat we had not seen them. And being thus in doubt[212] we saw the two\r\nships under all sail, with ensigns spread, come towards us: these, when\r\nnear us, suddenly discharged much artillery, at which we, very joyous,\r\nsaluted them with artillery and shouts. Afterwards, all together,\r\nthanking God and the Virgin Mary, we went to seek further on.\r\n\r\nAfter having entered inside this strait we found that there were\r\ntwo mouths, of which one trended to the Sirocco (S.E.), and the\r\nother to the Garbin (S.W.). On that account the captain again sent\r\nthe two ships, _St. Anthony_ and _Conception_, to see if the mouth\r\nwhich was towards Sirocco had an outlet beyond into the said peaceful\r\nsea. One of these two ships, named _St. Anthony_, would not wait for\r\nthe other ship, because those who were inside wished to return to\r\nSpain: this they did, and the principal reason was on account of the\r\npilot[213] of the said ship being previously discontented with the said\r\ncaptain-general, because that before this armament was made, this pilot\r\nhad gone to the Emperor to talk about having some ships to discover\r\ncountries. But, on account of the arrival of the captain-general, the\r\nEmperor did not give them to this pilot, on account of which he agreed\r\nwith some Spaniards, and the following night they took prisoner the\r\ncaptain of their ship, who was a brother[214] of the captain-general,\r\nand who was named Alvar de Meschite; they wounded him, and put him in\r\nirons. So they carried him off to Spain. And in this ship, which went\r\naway and returned, was one of the two above-mentioned giants whom we\r\nhad taken, and when he felt the heat he died. The other ship, named the\r\n_Conception_, not being able to follow that one, was always waiting\r\nfor it, and fluttered hither and thither. But it lost its time, for\r\nthe other took the road by night for returning. When this happened,\r\nat night the ship of the captain and the other ship went together to\r\ndiscover the other mouth to Garbin (S.W.), where, on always holding on\r\nour course, we found the same strait. But at the end[215] we arrived at\r\na river which we named the River of Sardines, because we found a great\r\nquantity of them. So we remained there four days to wait for the other\r\ntwo ships. A short time after we sent a boat well supplied with men\r\nand provisions to discover the cape of the other sea: these remained\r\nthree days in going and coming. They told us that they had found the\r\ncape, and the sea great and wide. At the joy which the captain-general\r\nhad at this he began to cry, and he gave the name of Cape of Desire\r\nto this cape, as a thing which had been much desired for a long time.\r\nHaving done that we turned back to find the two ships which were at the\r\nother side, but we only found the _Conception_, of which ship we asked\r\nwhat had become of her companion. To this the captain of the said ship,\r\nnamed John Serrano (who was pilot of the first ship which was lost,\r\nas has been related), replied that he knew nothing of her, and that\r\nhe had never seen her since she entered the mouth. However, we sought\r\nfor her through all the strait, as far as the said mouth, by which\r\nshe had taken her course to return. Besides that, the Captain-General\r\nsent back the ship named the _Victory_ as far as the entrance of the\r\nstrait to see if the ship was there, and he told the people of this\r\nship that if they did not find the ship they were looking for, they\r\nwere to place an ensign on the summit of a small hill, with a letter\r\ninside a pot placed in the ground near the ensign, so that if the ship\r\nshould by chance return, it might see that ensign, and also find the\r\nletter which would give information of the course which the captain was\r\nholding. This manner of acting had been ordained by the captain from\r\nthe commencement, in order to effect the junction of any ship which\r\nmight be separated from the others. So the people of the said ship did\r\nwhat the captain had commanded them, and more, for they set two ensigns\r\nwith letters; one of the ensigns was placed on a small hill at the\r\nfirst bay, the other on an islet in the third bay, where there were\r\nmany sea wolves and large birds. The captain-general waited for them\r\nwith the other ship near the river named Isles: and he caused a cross\r\nto be set upon a small island in front of that river, which was between\r\nhigh mountains covered with snow. This river comes and falls into the\r\nsea near the other river of the Sardines.\r\n\r\nIf we had not found this strait the captain-general had made up his\r\nmind to go as far as seventy-five degrees towards the antarctic pole;\r\nwhere at that height in the summer time there is no night, or very\r\nlittle: in a similar manner in the winter there is no day-light, or\r\nvery little, and so that every one may believe this, when we were in\r\nthis strait the night lasted only three hours, and this was in the\r\nmonth of October.\r\n\r\nThe land of this strait on the left hand side looked towards the\r\nSirocco wind, which is the wind collateral to the Levant and South; we\r\ncalled this strait Pathagonico. In it we found at every half league\r\na good port and place for anchoring, good waters, wood all of cedar,\r\nand fish like sardines, missiglioni, and a very sweet herb named appio\r\n(celery).[216] There is also some of the same kind which is bitter.\r\nThis herb grows near the springs, and from not finding anything else we\r\nate of it for several days. I think that there is not in the world a\r\nmore beautiful country, or better strait than this one. In this ocean\r\nsea one sees a very amusing chase of fish, which are of three sorts, of\r\nan ell or more in length, and they call these fish Dorades, Albacores,\r\nand Bonitos; these follow and pursue another sort of fish which flies,\r\nwhich they call Colondriny,[217] which are a foot long or more, and are\r\nvery good to eat. When these three sorts of fish find in the water any\r\nof these flying fish, immediately they make them come out of the water,\r\nand they fly more than a cross bow-shot, as long as their wings are\r\nwet; and whilst these fishes fly the other three run after them under\r\nthe water, seeing the shadow of those that fly: and the moment they\r\nfall into the water they are seized upon and eaten by the others which\r\npursue them, which is a thing marvellous and agreeable to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  +Vocables des Geants Pathagoniens.+\r\n\r\n                        _Milan Edition._\r\n  Le chef               Her...idem.\r\n  Yeulx                 Ather...oter.\r\n  Le nez                Or...id.\r\n  Les silz              Occhechl...id.\r\n  Paupieres des yeulx   Sechechiel...id.\r\n  Aux deux narines      Orescho...id.\r\n  La bouche             Xiam...chian.\r\n  Les leures            Schiane...schiaine.\r\n  Les dentz             Phor...for.\r\n  La langue             Schial...id.\r\n  Le menton             Sechen...secheri.\r\n  Les cheueulx[218]     Ajchir...archiz.\r\n  Le visaige            Cogechel.\r\n  La gorge              Ohumer...ohumez.\r\n  La copa[A] (le cou)   Schialeschin.\r\n  Les epaulles          Peles.\r\n  Le coude              Cotel.\r\n  La main               Chene.\r\n  La paulme de la main  Canneghin.\r\n  Les oreilles          Sane...id.\r\n  Les esselles          Salischin...id.\r\n  La mamelle            Othen...oton.\r\n  La poitrine           Ochy...ochii.\r\n  Le corps              Gechel.\r\n  Le vit                Scachet...sachet.\r\n  Le couillons          Scancos...sachancos.\r\n  Le con                Isse...id.\r\n  Le foutre             Johoi.\r\n  Les cuisses           Chiaue...id.\r\n  Le genouil            Tepin...id.\r\n  Le cul                Schiachen...schiaguen.\r\n  Les fesses            Hoy...hoii.\r\n  Le braz               Mar...riaz.\r\n  Le poulse             Ohoy...holion.\r\n  Les jambes            Choss...id.\r\n  Les piedz             Teche...ti.\r\n  Alcalcagno[218]       There...tire.\r\n  La cheuille du pied   Perchi...id.\r\n  Le doit               Cori...id.\r\n  Les ongles            Colim...colmi.\r\n  Le cueur              Chol...tol.\r\n  Le grater             Ghecare...id.\r\n  Homo sguerzo[218]     Calischen...id.\r\n  Au jeune              Calemi...id.\r\n  L’eau                 Oli...holi.\r\n  Le feu                Ghialeme...gialeme.\r\n  La fumée              Jaiche...giache.\r\n  La fortune (storm)    Ohone...id.\r\n  Le poisson            Hoi...id.\r\n  Le manger             Mecchiere...id.\r\n  Une escuelle          Elo...etlo.\r\n  A combatre            Oamaghei...ohomagse.\r\n  Alle frezze[218]      Sethe...seche.\r\n  Ung chien             Holl...id.\r\n  Ung loup              Ani...id.\r\n  A aller loing         Schien.\r\n  A la guide            Anti.\r\n  Aladorer[219]         Os...id.\r\n  Ung papegault[220]    Cheche.\r\n  La caige doyseau      Cleo...id.\r\n  Al missiglion[218]    Siameni...id.\r\n    (oyster)\r\n  Drap rouge            Terechai...id.\r\n  Al cocinare[218]      Ixecoles...irocoles.\r\n  La ceincture          Cathechin...id.\r\n  Une oye               Chache...cache.\r\n  La plante ou          Cartschem...caotchoni.\r\n    sole du pied\r\n  Nous                  Chen.\r\n  Si ou ouy             Rei.\r\n  L’or                  Pelpeli...id.\r\n  Petre lazure[221]     Secheghi...sechey.\r\n  Le soleil             Calexchem...id.\r\n  Les estoilles         Settere...id.\r\n  La mer                Aro...id.\r\n  Le vent               Om...oni.\r\n  A la pignate[218]     Aschame...id.\r\n  A demander            Ghelhe...gheglie.\r\n  Vien icy              Haisi...hai.\r\n  Au regarder           Conne...id.\r\n  A aller               Rhei...id.\r\n  A la nef[222]         Theu...id.\r\n  A courir[223]         Hiam...tiam.\r\n  Al struzzo            Hoihoi.\r\n    vcelo[218][224]\r\n  A ses œufs[225]       Jan.\r\n  La pouldre            Qui.\r\n    d’herbe[225]\r\n  Mangent[226]          Capac...id.\r\n  Le bonnet             Aichel...id.\r\n  Coulernoire           Amet...oinel.\r\n  Rouge                 Theiche...faiche.\r\n  Jaulne                Peperi...id.\r\n  Le diable grand       Setebos...id.\r\n  Les petitz diables    Cheleule...id.\r\n  [†]\r\n\r\n  [*: The Italian words mixed up in the French MS. show that this MS.\r\n  was written by Pigafetta, and not translated from his Italian.]\r\n\r\n  [†: None of these words resemble those given by the Jesuit, Falkner,\r\n  from the language of the Moluche tribe.]\r\n\r\nAll these words are pronounced in the throat, because they pronounce\r\nthem thus.\r\n\r\nThese words were given me by that giant whom we had in the ship,\r\nbecause he asked me for _capac_, that is to say bread, since they thus\r\nname that root which they use for bread, and _oli_ that is to say\r\nwater. When he saw me write these names after him, and ask for others\r\nhe understood (what I was doing) with my pen in my hand.[227] Another\r\ntime I made a cross and kissed it in showing it to him; but suddenly he\r\nexclaimed Setebos! and made signs to me that if I again made the cross\r\nit would enter into my stomach and make me die. When this giant was\r\nunwell[228] he asked for the cross, and embraced and kissed it much,\r\nand he wished to become a Christian before his death, and we named him\r\nPaul. When these people wish to light a fire they take a pointed stick\r\nand rub it with another until they make a fire in the pith of a tree\r\nwhich is placed between these sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (_In the Milan Edition here begins Book II._)\r\n\r\nWednesday, the twenty-eighth of November, 1520, we came forth out\r\nof the said strait, and entered into the Pacific sea, where we remained\r\nthree months and twenty days without taking in provisions or other\r\nrefreshments, and we only ate old biscuit reduced to powder, and full\r\nof grubs, and stinking from the dirt which the rats had made on it\r\nwhen eating the good biscuit, and we drank water that was yellow and\r\nstinking. We also ate the ox hides which were under the main-yard,[229]\r\nso that the yard should not break the rigging:[230] they were very\r\nhard on account of the sun, rain, and wind, and we left them for four\r\nor five days in the sea, and then we put them a little on the embers,\r\nand so ate them; also the sawdust of wood,[231] and rats which cost\r\nhalf-a-crown[232] each, moreover enough of them were not to be got.\r\nBesides the above-named evils, this misfortune which I will mention\r\nwas the worst, it was that the upper and lower gums of most of our\r\nmen grew so much[233] that they could not eat, and in this way so\r\nmany suffered, that nineteen died, and the other giant, and an Indian\r\nfrom the county of Verzin. Besides those who died, twenty-five or\r\nthirty fell ill of divers sicknesses, both in the arms and legs, and\r\nother places, in such manner that very few remained healthy. However,\r\nthanks be to the Lord, I had no sickness. During those three months\r\nand twenty days we went in an open sea,[234] while we ran fully four\r\nthousand leagues in the Pacific sea. This was well named Pacific, for\r\nduring this same time we met with no storm, and saw no land except two\r\nsmall uninhabited islands, in which we found only birds and trees. We\r\nnamed them the Unfortunate Islands; they are two hundred leagues apart\r\nfrom one another, and there is no place to anchor, as there is no\r\nbottom. There we saw many sharks, which are a kind of large fish which\r\nthey call Tiburoni. The first isle is in fifteen degrees of austral\r\nlatitude,[235] and the other island is in nine degrees. With the said\r\nwind we ran each day fifty or sixty leagues,[236] or more; now with the\r\nwind astern, sometimes on a wind[237] or otherwise. And if our Lord\r\nand his Mother had not aided us in giving us good weather to refresh\r\nourselves with provisions and other things, we should all have died of\r\nhunger in this very vast sea, and I think that never man will undertake\r\nto perform such a voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Pigafetta’s Map of Magellan’s Straits.+]\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone out of this strait, if we had always navigated to the\r\nwest we should have gone[238] without finding any land except the Cape\r\nof the Eleven Thousand Virgins, which is the eastern head of the strait\r\nin the ocean sea, with the Cape of Desire at the west in the Pacific\r\nsea. These two capes are exactly in fifty-two degrees of latitude of\r\nthe antarctic pole.\r\n\r\nThe antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic, for\r\nthere are to be seen there many small stars congregated together,\r\nwhich are like to two clouds a little separated from one another, and\r\na little dimmed,[239] in the midst of which are two stars, not very\r\nlarge, nor very brilliant, and they move but little:[240] these two\r\nstars are the antarctic pole. Our compass needle still pointed a little\r\nto its arctic pole; nevertheless it had not as much power as on its\r\nown side and region.[241] Yet when we were in the open sea,[242] the\r\ncaptain-general[243] asked of all the pilots, whilst still going under\r\nsail, in what direction they were navigating and pointing the charts.\r\nThey all replied, by the course he had given, punctually [pricked in];\r\nthen he answered, that they were pointing falsely (which was so), and\r\nthat it was fitting to arrange the needle of navigation, because it\r\ndid not receive so much force as in its own quarter. When we were in\r\nthe middle of this open sea we saw a cross of five stars, very bright,\r\nstraight, in the west, and they are straight one with another.[244]\r\n\r\nDuring this time of two months and twelve days we navigated between\r\nwest and north-west (maestral), and a quarter west of north-west, and\r\nalso north-west, until we came to the equinoctial line, which was at\r\n[a point] one hundred and twenty-two degrees distant from the line\r\nof repartition. This line of delimitation is thirty degrees distant\r\nfrom the meridian,[245] and the meridian[246] is three degrees distant\r\nfrom the Cape Verd towards the east.[247] In going by this course we\r\npassed near two very rich islands; one is in twenty degrees latitude\r\nin the antarctic pole, and is called Cipanghu; the other, in fifteen\r\ndegrees of the same pole, is named Sumbdit Pradit. After we had passed\r\nthe equinoctial line we navigated between west, and north-west and a\r\nquarter west, by north-west. Afterwards we made two hundred leagues to\r\nwestwards, then changed the course to a quarter of south-west, until\r\nin thirteen degrees north latitude, in order to approach the land of\r\nCape Gaticara,[248] which cape (under correction of those who have made\r\ncosmography), (for they have never seen it), is not placed where they\r\nthink, but is towards the north, in twelve degrees or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nAfter having navigated sixty leagues[249] by the said course, in\r\ntwelve degrees latitude, and a hundred and forty-six of longitude,\r\non Wednesday, the 6th of March, we discovered a small island in the\r\nnorth-west direction,[250] and two others lying to the south-west.\r\nOne of these islands was larger and higher than the other two. The\r\ncaptain-general wished to touch at the largest of these three islands\r\nto get refreshments of provisions; but it was not possible because the\r\npeople of these islands entered into the ships and robbed us, in such\r\na way that it was impossible to preserve oneself from them. Whilst we\r\nwere striking and lowering the sails to go ashore, they stole away\r\nwith much address and diligence the small boat called the skiff, which\r\nwas made fast to the poop of the captain’s ship, at which he was much\r\nirritated, and went on shore with forty armed men, burned forty or\r\nfifty houses, with several small boats, and killed seven men of the\r\nisland; they recovered their skiff. After this we set sail suddenly,\r\nfollowing the same course. Before we went ashore some of our sick men\r\nbegged us that if we killed man or woman, that we should bring them\r\ntheir entrails, as they would see themselves suddenly cured.\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nIt must be known that when we wounded any of this kind of people with\r\nour arrows, which entered inside their bodies, they looked at the\r\narrow, and then drew it forth with much astonishment, and immediately\r\nafterwards they died.[251] Immediately after we sailed from that\r\nisland, following our course, and those people seeing that we were\r\ngoing away followed us for a league, with a hundred small boats, or\r\nmore, and they approached our ships, showing to us fish, and feigning\r\nto give it to us. But they threw stones at us, and then ran away, and\r\nin their flight they passed with their little boats between the boat\r\nwhich is towed at the poop and the ship going under full sail; but they\r\ndid this so quickly, and with such skill that it was a wonder. And\r\nwe saw some of these women, who cried out and tore their hair, and I\r\nbelieve[252] that it was for the love of those whom we had killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nThese people live in liberty and according to their will, for they\r\nhave no lord or superior; they go quite naked, and some of them wear\r\nbeards, and have their hair down to the waist. They wear small hats,\r\nafter the fashion of the Albanians; these hats are made of palm leaves.\r\nThe people are as tall as us, and well made: they adore nothing,\r\nand when they are born they are white, later they become brown, and\r\nhave their teeth black and red. The women also go naked, except that\r\nthey cover their nature with a thin bark, pliable like paper, which\r\ngrows between the tree and the bark of the palm. They are beautiful\r\nand delicate, and whiter than the men, and have their hair loose and\r\nflowing, very black and long, down to the earth. They do not go to work\r\nin the fields, nor stir from their houses, making cloth and baskets of\r\npalm leaves. Their provisions are certain fruits named Cochi, Battate;\r\nthere are birds, figs a palm long,[253] sweet canes, and flying fish.\r\nThe women anoint their bodies and their hair with oil of cocho and\r\ngiongioli (sesame). Their houses are constructed of wood, covered with\r\nplanks, with fig leaves, which are two ells in length: they have only\r\none floor: their rooms and beds are furnished with mats,[254] which\r\nwe call matting,[255] which are made of palm leaves, and are very\r\nbeautiful, and they lie down on palm straw, which is soft and fine.\r\nThese people have no arms, but use sticks,[256] which have a fish bone\r\nat the end. They are poor, but ingenious, and great thieves, and for\r\nthe sake of that we called these three islands the Ladrone Islands. The\r\npastime of the men and the women of this place, and their diversion,\r\nis to go with their little boats to catch those fish which fly, with\r\nhooks made of fish bones. The pattern of their small boats is painted\r\nhere-after, they are like the fuseleres,[257] but narrower. Some of\r\nthem black and white, and others red. On the opposite side to the sail,\r\nthey have a large piece of wood, pointed above, with poles across,\r\nwhich are in the water, in order to go more securely under sail: their\r\nsails are of palm leaves, sewed together, and of the shape of a lateen\r\nsail, fore and aft. They have certain shovels like hearth shovels,[258]\r\nand there is no difference between the poop and the prow in these\r\nboats, and they are like dolphins bounding from wave to wave. These\r\nthieves thought, according to the signs they made, that there were no\r\nother men in the world besides them.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 16th of March, 1521, we arrived at daybreak in sight of\r\na high island, three hundred leagues distant from the before-mentioned\r\nThieves’ island. This isle is named Zamal.[259] The next day the\r\ncaptain-general wished to land at another uninhabited island near the\r\nfirst,[260] to be in greater security and to take water, also to repose\r\nthere a few days. He set up there two tents on shore for the sick, and\r\nhad a sow[261] killed for them.\r\n\r\nMonday, the 18th of March, after dinner, we saw a boat come towards\r\nus with nine men in it: upon which the captain-general ordered\r\nthat no one should move or speak without his permission.[262] When\r\nthese people had come into this island towards us, immediately the\r\nprincipal[263] one amongst them went towards the captain-general with\r\ndemonstrations of being very joyous at our arrival. Five of the most\r\nshowy[264] of them remained with us, the others who remained with the\r\nboat went to call some men who were fishing, and afterwards all of\r\nthem came together.[265] The captain seeing that these people were\r\nreasonable,[266] ordered food and drink to be given them, and he gave\r\nthem some red caps, looking glasses, combs, bells, ivory, and other\r\nthings. When these people saw the politeness of the captain, they\r\npresented some fish, and a vessel of palm wine, which they call in\r\ntheir language Uraca;[267] figs more than a foot[268] long, and others\r\nsmaller and of a better savour, and two cochos.[269] At that time they\r\nhad nothing to give him, and they made signs to us with their hands\r\nthat in four days they would bring us Umai, which is rice, cocos, and\r\nmany other victuals.\r\n\r\nTo explain the kind of fruits above-named it must be known that the\r\none which they call cochi, is the fruit which the palm trees bear. And\r\nas we have bread, wine, oil, and vinegar, proceeding from different\r\nkinds, so these people have those things proceeding from these palm\r\ntrees only. It must be said that wine proceeds from the said palm\r\ntrees in the following manner. They make a hole at the summit of the\r\ntree as far as its heart, which is named palmito, from which a liquor\r\ncomes out in drops down the tree, like white must, which is sweet, but\r\nwith somewhat of bitter.[270] They have canes as thick as the leg, in\r\nwhich they draw off this liquor, and they fasten them to the tree from\r\nthe evening till next morning, and from the morning to the evening,\r\nbecause this liquor comes little by little. This palm produces a fruit\r\nnamed cocho, which is as large as the head, or thereabouts: its first\r\nhusk is green, and two fingers in thickness, in it they find certain\r\nthreads, with which they make the cords for fastening their boats.\r\nUnder this husk there is another very hard, and thicker than that\r\nof a walnut. They burn this second rind, and make with it a powder\r\nwhich is useful to them. Under this rind there is a white marrow of a\r\nfinger’s thickness, which they eat fresh with meat and fish, as we do\r\nbread, and it has the taste of an almond, and if anyone dried it[271]\r\nhe might make bread of it. From the middle of this marrow there comes\r\nout a clear sweet water, and very cordial, which, when it has rested\r\na little, and settled, congeals and becomes like an apple.[272] When\r\nthey wish to make oil they take this fruit, the coco, and let it get\r\nrotten, and they corrupt this marrow in the water, then they boil it,\r\nand it becomes oil in the manner[273] of butter. When they want to make\r\nvinegar, they let the water in the cocoa-nut get bad, and they put it\r\nin the sun, when it turns to vinegar like white wine. From this fruit\r\nmilk also can be made, as we experienced, for we scraped this marrow\r\nand then put it with its water, and passed it through a cloth, and\r\nthus it was milk like that of goats. This kind of palm tree is like\r\nthe date-palm,[274] but not so rugged. Two of these trees can maintain\r\na family of ten persons: but they do not draw wine as above-mentioned\r\nalways from one tree, but draw from one for eight days, and from the\r\nother as long. For if they did not, otherwise the trees would dry up.\r\nIn this manner they last a hundred years.[275]\r\n\r\nThese people became very familiar and friendly with us, and explained\r\nmany things to us in their language, and told us the names of some\r\nislands which we saw with our eyes before us. *The island where they\r\ndwelt is called Zuluam, and it is not large.*[276] As they were\r\nsufficiently agreeable and conversible we had great pleasure with\r\nthem. The captain seeing that they were of this good condition, to do\r\nthem greater honour conducted them to the ship, and showed them all\r\nhis goods, that is to say, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg,\r\nmace,[277] gold, and all that was in the ship. He also had some shots\r\nfired with his artillery, at which they were so much afraid that they\r\nwished to jump from the ship into the sea. They made signs that the\r\nthings which the captain had shown them grew there where we were going.\r\nWhen they wished to leave us they took leave of the captain and of us\r\nwith very good manners and gracefulness, promising us to come back to\r\nsee us. The island we were at was named Humunu; nevertheless because we\r\nfound there two springs of very fresh water we named it the Watering\r\nPlace of good signs,[278] and because we found here the first signs of\r\ngold. There is much white coral to be found here, and large trees which\r\nbear fruit smaller than an almond, and which are like pines. There were\r\nalso many palm trees both good and bad. In this place there were many\r\ncircumjacent islands, on which account we named them the archipelago\r\nof St. Lazarus, because we stayed there on the day and feast of St.\r\nLazarus. This region and archipelago is in ten degrees north latitude,\r\nand a hundred and sixty-one degrees longitude from the line of\r\ndemarcation.\r\n\r\nFriday, the 22nd of March, the above-mentioned people, who had\r\npromised us to return, came about midday, with two boats laden with the\r\nsaid fruit cochi, sweet oranges, a vessel of palm wine, and a cock, to\r\ngive us to understand that they had poultry in their country, so that\r\nwe bought all that they brought. The lord of these people was old,\r\nand had his face painted, and had gold rings suspended to his ears,\r\nwhich they name Schione,[279] and the others had many bracelets and\r\nrings of gold on their arms, with a wrapper of linen round their head.\r\nWe remained at this place eight days: the captain went there every\r\nday to see his sick men, whom he had placed on this island to refresh\r\nthem: and he gave them himself every day the water of this said fruit\r\nthe cocho, which comforted them much. Near this isle is another where\r\nthere are a kind of people who wear holes[280] in their ears so large\r\nthat they can pass their arms through them; these people are Caphre,\r\nthat is to say, Gentiles, and they go naked, except that round their\r\nmiddles they wear cloth made of the bark of trees. But there are some\r\nof the more remarkable of them who wear cotton stuff, and at the end\r\nof it there is some work of silk done with a needle. These people are\r\ntawny,[281] fat, and painted, and they anoint themselves with the\r\noil of coco nuts and sesame,[282] to preserve them from the sun and\r\nthe wind. Their hair is very black and long, reaching to the waist,\r\nand they carry small daggers and knives, ornamented with gold, and\r\nmany other things, such as darts,[283] harpoons, and nets to fish,\r\nlike...,[284] and their boats are like ours.\r\n\r\nThe Monday of Passion week, the 25th of March, and feast of our Lady,\r\nin the afternoon, and being ready to depart from this place, I went to\r\nthe side of our ship to fish, and putting my feet on a spar to go down\r\nto the store room,[285] my feet slipped, because it had rained, and I\r\nfell into the sea without any one seeing me, and being near drowning\r\nby luck I found at my left hand the sheet of the large sail which was\r\nin the sea, I caught hold of it and began to cry out till they came to\r\nhelp and pick me up with the boat. I was assisted not by my merits,\r\nbut by the mercy and grace of the fountain of pity. That same day we\r\ntook the course between west and southwest,[286] and passed amidst four\r\nsmall islands, that is to say, Cenalo, Huinanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien.\r\n\r\nThursday, the 28th of March, having seen the night before fire upon\r\nan island, at the morning we came to anchor at this island; where\r\nwe saw a small boat which they call Boloto, with eight men inside,\r\nwhich approached the ship of the captain-general. Then a slave of the\r\ncaptain’s, who was from Sumatra, otherwise named Traprobana, spoke\r\nfrom afar to these people, who understood his talk,[287] and came near\r\nto the side of the ship, but they withdrew immediately, and would not\r\nenter the ship from fear of us. So the captain seeing that they would\r\nnot trust to us showed them a red cap, and other things, which he had\r\ntied and placed on a little plank,[288] and the people in the boat took\r\nthem immediately and joyously, and then returned to advise their king.\r\nTwo hours afterwards, or thereabouts, we saw come two long boats, which\r\nthey call Ballanghai, full of men. In the largest of them was their\r\nking sitting under an awning of mats; when they were near the ship of\r\nthe captain-general, the said slave spoke to the king, who understood\r\nhim well, because in these countries the kings know more languages than\r\nthe common people. Then the king ordered some of his people to go to\r\nthe captain’s ship, whilst he would not move from his boat, which was\r\nnear enough to us. This was done, and when his people returned to the\r\nboat, he went away at once. The captain gave good entertainment to the\r\nmen who came to his ship, and gave them all sorts of things, on which\r\naccount the king wished to give the captain a rather large bar of solid\r\ngold, and a chest[289] full of ginger. However, the captain thanked him\r\nvery much but would not accept the present. After that, when it was\r\nlate, we went with the ships near to the houses and abode of the king.\r\n\r\nThe next day which was Good Friday, the captain sent on shore the\r\nbefore-mentioned slave, who was our interpreter, to the king to beg\r\nhim to give him for money some provisions for his ships, sending him\r\nword that he had not come to his country as an enemy, but as a friend.\r\nThe king on hearing this came with seven or eight men in a boat, and\r\nentered the ship, and embraced the captain, and gave him three china\r\ndishes covered with leaves full of rice, and two _dorades_, which\r\nare rather large fish, and of the sort above-mentioned, and he gave\r\nhim several other things. The captain gave this king a robe of red\r\nand yellow cloth, made in the Turkish fashion, and a very fine red\r\ncap, and to his people he gave to some of them knives, and to others\r\nmirrors. After that refreshments were served up to them. The captain\r\ntold the king, through the said interpreter, that he wished to be with\r\nhim, _cassi[290] cassi_, that is to say, brothers. To which the king\r\nanswered that he desired to be the same towards him. After that the\r\ncaptain showed him cloths of different colours, linen, coral, and much\r\nother merchandise, and all the artillery, of which he had some pieces\r\nfired before him, at which the king was much astonished; after that the\r\ncaptain had one of his soldiers armed with white armour, and placed him\r\nin the midst of three comrades, who struck him with swords and daggers.\r\nThe king thought this very strange, and the captain told him, through\r\nthe interpreter, that a man thus in white armour was worth a hundred\r\nof his men; he answered that it was true; he was further informed that\r\nthere were in each ship two hundred like that man. After that the\r\ncaptain showed him a great number of swords, cuirasses, and helmets,\r\nand made two of the men play with their swords before the king; he then\r\nshowed him the sea chart and the ship compass, and informed him how he\r\nhad found the strait to come there, and of the time which he had spent\r\nin coming; also of the time he had been without seeing any land, at\r\nwhich the king was astonished. At the end the captain asked[291] if\r\nhe would be pleased that two of his people should go with him to the\r\nplaces where they lived, to see some of the things of his country. This\r\nthe king granted, and I went with another.\r\n\r\nWhen I had landed, the king raised his hands to the sky, and turned to\r\nus two, and we did the same as he did; after that he took me by the\r\nhand, and one of his principal people took my companion, and led us\r\nunder a place covered with canes, where there was a ballanghai, that is\r\nto say, a boat, eighty feet long or thereabouts, resembling a fusta. We\r\nsat with the king upon its poop, always conversing with him by signs,\r\nand his people stood up around us, with their swords, spears, and\r\nbucklers. Then the king ordered to be brought a dish of pig’s flesh and\r\nwine.[292] Their fashion of drinking is in this wise, they first raise\r\ntheir hands to heaven, then take the drinking vessel in their right\r\nhand, and extend the left hand closed towards the people. This the king\r\ndid, and presented to me his fist, so that I thought that he wanted to\r\nstrike me; I did the same thing towards him; so with this ceremony, and\r\nother signs of friendship, we banqueted, and afterwards supped with him.\r\n\r\nI ate flesh on Good Friday, not being able to do otherwise, and before\r\nthe hour of supper, I gave several things to the king, which I had\r\nbrought. There I wrote down several things as they name them in their\r\nlanguage, and when the king and the others saw me write, and I told\r\nthem their manner of speech, they were all astonished. When the hour\r\nfor supper had come, they brought two large china dishes, of which one\r\nwas full of rice, and the other of pig’s flesh, with its broth[293] and\r\nsauce. We supped with the same signs and ceremonies, and then went to\r\nthe king’s palace, which was made and built like a hay grange, covered\r\nwith fig and palm leaves. It was built on great timbers high above\r\nthe ground, and it was necessary to go up steps and ladders to it.\r\nThen the king made us sit on a cane mat, with our legs doubled as was\r\nthe custom; after half an hour there was brought a dish of fish roast\r\nin pieces, and ginger fresh gathered that moment, and some wine. The\r\neldest son of the king, who was the prince, came where we were, and the\r\nking told him to sit down near us, which he did; then two dishes were\r\nbrought, one of fish, with its sauce, and the other of rice, and this\r\nwas done for us to eat with the prince. My companion enjoyed the food\r\nand drink so much that he got drunk. They use for candles or torches\r\nthe gum of a tree which is named Animé, wrapped up in leaves of palms\r\nor fig trees. The king made a sign that he wished to go to rest, and\r\nleft with us the prince, with whom we slept on a cane mat, with some\r\ncushions and pillows of leaves. Next morning the king came and look\r\nme by the hand, and so we went to the place where we had supped, to\r\nbreakfast, but the boat came to fetch us. The king, before we went\r\naway, was very gay, and kissed our hands, and we kissed his. There came\r\nwith us a brother of his, the king of another island,[294] accompanied\r\nby three men. The captain-general detained him to dine with us, and we\r\ngave him several things.\r\n\r\nIn the island belonging to the king who came to the ship there are\r\nmines of gold, which they find in pieces as big as a walnut or an egg,\r\nby seeking in the ground. All the vessels which he makes use of are\r\nmade of it, and also some parts of his house, which was well fitted up\r\naccording to the custom of the country, and he was the handsomest man\r\nthat we saw among these nations. He had very black hair coming down to\r\nhis shoulders, with a silk cloth on his head, and two large gold rings\r\nhanging from his ears, he had a cloth of cotton worked with silk, which\r\ncovered him from the waist to the knees, at his side he wore a dagger,\r\nwith a long handle which was all of gold, its sheath was of carved\r\nwood.[295] Besides he carried upon him scents of storax and benzoin.\r\nHe was tawny and painted all over. The island of this king is named\r\nZuluan and Calagan, and when these two kings wish to visit one another\r\nthey come to hunt in this island where we were.[296] Of these kings the\r\npainted king is called Raia Calambu, and the other Raia Siani.[297]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the last day of March, and feast of Easter, the captain\r\nsent the chaplain ashore early to say mass, and the interpreter went\r\nwith him to tell the king that they were not coming on shore to dine\r\nwith him, but only to hear the mass. The king hearing that sent two\r\ndead pigs. When it was time for saying mass the captain went ashore\r\nwith fifty men, not with their arms, but only with their swords, and\r\ndressed as well as each one was able to dress, and before the boats\r\nreached the shore our ships fired six cannon shots as a sign of peace.\r\nAt our landing the two kings were there, and received our captain in\r\na friendly manner, and placed him between them, and then we went to\r\nthe place prepared for saying mass, which was not far from the shore.\r\nBefore the mass began the captain threw a quantity of musk rose water\r\non those two kings, and when the offertory of the mass came, the two\r\nkings went to kiss the cross like us, but they offered nothing, and at\r\nthe elevation of the body of our Lord they were kneeling like us, and\r\nadored our Lord with joined hands. The ships fired all their artillery\r\nat the elevation of the body of our Lord. After mass had been said each\r\none did the duty of a Christian, receiving our Lord. After that the\r\ncaptain had some sword-play by his people, which gave great pleasure\r\nto the kings. Then he had a cross brought, with the nails and crown,\r\nto which the kings made reverence, and the captain had them told that\r\nthese things which he showed them were the sign of the emperor his lord\r\nand master, from whom he had charge and commandment to place it in\r\nall places where he might go or pass by. He told them that he wished\r\nto place it in their country for their profit, because if there came\r\nafterwards any ships from Spain to those islands, on seeing this cross,\r\nthey would know that we had been there, and therefore they would not\r\ncause them any displeasure to their persons nor their goods; and if\r\nthey took any of their people, on showing them this sign, they would\r\nat once let them go. Besides this, the captain told them that it was\r\nnecessary that this cross should be placed on the summit of the highest\r\nmountain in their country, so that seeing it every day they might adore\r\nit, and that if they did thus, neither thunder, lightning, nor the\r\ntempest could do them hurt. The kings thanked the captain, and said\r\nthey would do it willingly. Then he asked whether they were Moors or\r\nGentiles, and in what they believed. They answered that they did not\r\nperform any other adoration, but only joined their hands, looking up to\r\nheaven, and that they called their God, Aba. Hearing this, the captain\r\nwas very joyful, on seeing that, the first king raised his hands to\r\nthe sky and said that he wished it were possible for him to be able to\r\nshow the affection which he felt towards him. The interpreter asked him\r\nfor what reason there was so little to eat in that place, to which the\r\nking replied that he did not reside in that place except when he came\r\nto hunt and to see his brother, but that he lived in another island\r\nwhere he had all his family. Then the captain asked him if he had any\r\nenemies who made war upon him, and that if he had any he would go and\r\ndefeat them with his men and ships, to put them under his obedience.\r\nThe king thanked him, and answered that there were two islands the\r\ninhabitants of which were his enemies; however, that for the present it\r\nwas not the time to attack them. The captain therefore said to him that\r\nif God permitted him to return another time to this country, he would\r\nbring so many men that he would put them by force under his obedience.\r\nThen he bade the interpreter tell them that he was going away to dine,\r\nand after that he would return to place the cross on the summit of\r\nthe mountain. The two kings said they were content, and on that they\r\nembraced the captain, and he separated from them.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we all returned in our dress coats[298], and we went\r\ntogether with the two kings to the middle of the highest mountain we\r\ncould find, and there the cross was planted. After that the two kings\r\nand the captain rested themselves; and, while conversing, I asked where\r\nwas the best port for obtaining victuals. They replied that there were\r\nthree, that is to say, Ceylon, Zzubu,[299] and Calaghan, but that Zzubu\r\nwas the largest and of the most traffic. Then the kings offered to\r\ngive him pilots to go to those ports, for which he thanked them, and\r\ndeliberated to go there, for his ill-fortune[300] would have it so.\r\nAfter the cross had been planted on that mountain, each one said the\r\nPaternoster and Ave Maria, and adored it, and the kings did the like.\r\nThen we went down below to where their boats were. There the kings\r\nhad brought some of the fruit called cocos and other things to make a\r\ncollation and to refresh us. The captain, being desirous to depart the\r\nnext day in the morning, asked the king for the pilots to conduct us to\r\nthe above-mentioned ports, promising him to treat them like themselves,\r\nand that he would leave one of his own men as a hostage. The first\r\nking said that he would go himself and conduct him to this port, and\r\nbe his pilot, but that he should wait two days, until he had had his\r\nrice gathered in and done other things which he had to do, begging him\r\nto lend him some of his men so as to get done sooner. This the captain\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nThis kind of people are gentle, and go naked, and are painted. They\r\nwear a piece of cloth made from a tree, like a linen cloth, round their\r\nbody to cover their natural parts: they are great drinkers. The women\r\nare dressed in tree cloth from their waists downwards; their hair is\r\nblack, and reaches down to the ground: they wear certain gold rings in\r\ntheir ears. These people chew most of their time a fruit which they\r\ncall areca, which is something of the shape of a pear; they cut it\r\nin four quarters, and after they have chewed it for a long time they\r\nspit it out, from which afterwards they have their mouths very red.\r\nThey find themselves the better from the use of this fruit because it\r\nrefreshes them much, for this country is very hot, so that they could\r\nnot live without it. In this island there is a great quantity of dogs,\r\ncats, pigs, fowls, and goats, rice, ginger, cocos, figs, oranges,\r\nlemons, millet, wax, and gold mines. This island is in nine degrees and\r\ntwo-thirds north latitude, and one hundred and sixty-two longitude[301]\r\nfrom the line of demarcation: it is twenty-five leagues distant from\r\nthe other island where we found the two fountains of fresh water. This\r\nisland is named Mazzava.\r\n\r\nWe remained seven days in this place; then we took the tack of\r\nMaestral, passing through the midst of five isles, that is to say,\r\nCeylon, Bohol, Canighan, Baibai, and Satighan.[302] In this island of\r\nSatighan is a kind of bird[303] called Barbastigly, which are as large\r\nas eagles. Of these we killed only one, because it was late. We ate it,\r\nand it had the taste of a fowl. There are also in this island doves,\r\ntortoises, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl, with\r\na long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose. These they\r\nput a good arm’s length[304] under the sand in the sun, where they are\r\nhatched by the great heat which the heated sand gives out; and when\r\nthese birds are hatched they push up[305] the sand and come out. These\r\neggs are good to eat. From this island of Mazzabua[306] to that of\r\nSatighan there are twenty leagues, and on leaving Satighan we went by\r\nthe west; but the King of Mazzabua could not follow us; therefore we\r\nwaited for him near three islands, that is to say, Polo, Ticobon, and\r\nPozzon. When the king arrived he was much astonished at our navigation,\r\nthe captain-general bade him come on board his ship with some of his\r\nprincipal people, at which they were much pleased. Thus we went to\r\nZzubu, which is fifteen leagues off from Satighan.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 7th of April, about midday, we entered the port of\r\nZzubu, having passed by many villages. There[307] we saw many houses\r\nwhich were built on trees. On approaching the principal town the\r\ncaptain-general commanded all his ships to hang out their flags. Then\r\nwe lowered the sails in the fashion in which they are struck when going\r\nto fight, and he had all the artillery fired, at which the people of\r\nthis place were greatly frightened. The captain sent a young man whom\r\nhe had brought up,[308] with the interpreter to the king of this island\r\nZzubu. These having come to the town, found a great number of people\r\nand their king with them, all alarmed by the artillery which had been\r\nfired. But the interpreter reassured them, saying that it was the\r\nfashion and custom to fire artillery when they arrived at ports, to\r\nshow signs of peace and friendship; and also, to do more honour to the\r\nking of the country, they had fired all the artillery. The king and\r\nall his people were reassured. He then bade one of his principal men\r\nask what we were seeking. The interpreter answered him that his master\r\nwas captain of the greatest king in the world, and that he was going\r\nby the command of the said sovereign to discover the Molucca islands.\r\nHowever, on account of what he had heard where he had passed, and\r\nespecially from the King of Mazzava, of his courtesy and good fame, he\r\nhad wished to pass by his country to visit him, and also to obtain some\r\nrefreshment of victuals for his merchandise. The king answered him that\r\nhe was welcome, but that the custom was that all ships which arrived\r\nat his country or port paid tribute, and it was only four days since\r\nthat a ship called the Junk of Ciama,[309] laden with gold and slaves,\r\nhad paid him his tribute, and, to verify what he said, he showed them\r\na merchant of the said Ciama, who had remained there to trade with the\r\ngold and slaves. The interpreter said to him that this captain, on\r\naccount of being captain of so great a king as his was, would not pay\r\ntribute to any sovereign in the world; and that if he wished for peace\r\nhe would have peace, and if he wished for war he would have war. Then\r\nthe merchant above-mentioned replied to the king in his own language,\r\n“Look well, oh king,[310] what you will do, for these people are of\r\nthose who have conquered Calicut, Malacca, and all greater India; if\r\nyou entertain them well and treat them well you will find yourself the\r\nbetter for it, and if ill, it will be so much the worse for you, as\r\nthey have done at Calicut and Malacca.” The interpreter, who understood\r\nall this discourse, said to them that the king, his master, was a good\r\ndeal more powerful in ships and by land than the King of Portugal,\r\nand declared to him that he was the King of Spain and Emperor of all\r\nChristendom, wherefore, if he would not be his friend and treat his\r\nsubjects well, he would another time send against him so many men as\r\nto destroy him. Then the king answered that he would speak to his\r\ncouncil, and give an answer the next day. Afterwards the king ordered\r\na collation to be brought of several viands, all of meat, in porcelain\r\ndishes, with a great many vessels of wine. When the repast was over,\r\nour people returned, and related all to the captain; and the King of\r\nMazzabua, who was on board the captain’s ship, and who was the first\r\nking after him of Zzubu, and the lord of several isles, wished to go on\r\nshore to relate to the king the politeness and courtesy of our captain.\r\n\r\nMonday morning our clerk went with the interpreter to the town of\r\nZzubu, and the king, accompanied by the principal men of his kingdom,\r\ncame to the open space, where we made our people sit down near him, and\r\nhe asked whether there was more than one captain in all those ships,\r\nand whether he wished that the king should pay tribute to the emperor,\r\nhis master, to which our people answered, no, but that the captain only\r\nwished to trade with the things which he had brought with the people\r\nof his country, and not with others. Then the king said that he was\r\ncontent, and as a greater sign of affection he sent him a little of\r\nhis blood from his right arm, and wished he should do the like. Our\r\npeople answered that he would do it. Besides that, he said that all the\r\ncaptains who came to his country had been accustomed to make a present\r\nto him, and he to them, and therefore they should ask their captain if\r\nhe would observe the custom. Our people answered that he would; but\r\nas the king wished to keep up the custom, let him begin and make a\r\npresent, and then the captain would do his duty.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning following the King of Mazzava, with the Moor, came to\r\nthe ship, and saluted the captain on behalf of the King of Zzubu, and\r\nsaid that the king was preparing a quantity of provisions, as much as\r\nhe could, to make a present of to him, and that after dinner he would\r\nsend two of his nephews, with others of his principal people, to make\r\npeace with him. Then the captain had one of his men armed with his own\r\narmour, and told him that all of us would fight armed in that manner,\r\nat which the Moorish merchant was rather astonished; but the captain\r\ntold him not to be afraid, and that our arms were soft to our friends\r\nand rough to our enemies; and that as a cloth wipes away the sweat from\r\na man, so our arms destroy the enemies of our faith. The captain said\r\nthis to the Moor, because he was more intelligent than the others, and\r\nfor him to relate it all to the King of Zzubu.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the nephew of this king, who was a prince,[311]\r\nwith the King of Mazzava, the Moor, the governor, and the chief of\r\npolice,[312] and eight of the principal men, came to the ship to make\r\npeace with us. The captain-general was sitting in a chair of red\r\nvelvet, and near him were the principal men of the ships sitting in\r\nleather chairs, and the others on the ground on mats. Then the captain\r\nbade the interpreter ask the above-mentioned persons if it was their\r\ncustom to speak in secret or in public, and whether the prince who was\r\ncome with them had power to conclude peace. They answered yes, that\r\nthey would speak in public, and that they had the power to conclude\r\npeace. The captain spoke at length on the subject of peace, and prayed\r\nGod to confirm it in heaven. These people replied that they had never\r\nheard such words as these which the captain had spoken to them, and\r\nthey took great pleasure in hearing them. The captain, seeing then\r\nthat those people listened willingly to what was said to them, and\r\nthat they gave good answers, began to say a great many more good\r\nthings to induce them to become Christians. After many other subjects,\r\nthe captain asked them who would succeed the king in their country\r\nafter his death. They answered that the king had no son, but several\r\ndaughters, and that this prince was his nephew, and had for a wife\r\nthe king’s eldest daughter, and for the sake of that they called him\r\nprince. They also said that when the father and mother were old they\r\ntook no further account of them, but their children commanded them.\r\nUpon which the captain told them how God had made heaven and earth and\r\nall other things in the world, and that He had commanded that everyone\r\nshould render honour and obedience to his father and mother, and that\r\nwhoever did otherwise was condemned to eternal fire. He then pointed\r\nout to them many other things concerning our faith. The people heard\r\nthese things willingly, and besought the captain to leave them two men\r\nto teach and show them the Christian faith, and they would entertain\r\nthem well with great honour. To this the captain answered that for the\r\nmoment he could not leave them any of his people, but that if they\r\nwished to be Christians that his priest would baptise them, and that\r\nanother time he would bring priests and preachers to teach them the\r\nfaith. They then answered that they wished first to speak to their\r\nking, and then would become Christians. Each of us wept for the joy\r\nwhich we felt at the goodwill of these people, and the captain told\r\nthem not to become Christians from fear of us, or to please us, but\r\nthat if they wished to become Christian they must do it willingly, and\r\nfor the love of God, for even though they should not become Christian,\r\nno displeasure would be done them, but those who became Christian\r\nwould be more loved and better treated than the others. Then they all\r\ncried out with one voice, that they did not wish to become Christians\r\nfrom fear, nor from complaisance, but of their free will. The captain\r\nthen said that if they became Christians he would leave them the arms\r\nwhich the Christians use, and that his king had commanded him so to\r\ndo. At last they said they did not know what more to answer to so many\r\ngood and beautiful words which he spoke to them, but that they placed\r\nthemselves in his hands, and that he should do with them as with his\r\nown servants. Then the captain, with tears in his eyes, embraced them,\r\nand, taking the hand of the prince and that of the king, said to him\r\nthat by the faith he had in God, and to his master the emperor, and by\r\nthe habit of St. James which he wore, he promised them to cause them to\r\nhave perpetual peace with the King of Spain, at which the prince and\r\nthe others promised him the same. After peace had been concluded, the\r\ncaptain had refreshments served to them. The prince and the King of\r\nMazzava, who was with him, presented to the captain on behalf of his\r\nking large baskets full of rice, pigs, goats, and fowls, and desired\r\nthe captain to be told he should pardon them that their present was\r\nnot as fine as was fitting for him. The captain gave to the prince\r\nsome very fine cloth and a red cap, and a quantity of glass and a cup\r\nof gilt glass. Glasses are much prized in this country. To the other\r\npeople belonging to the Prince he gave various things. Then he sent by\r\nme and another person to the King of Zzubu a robe of yellow and violet\r\nsilk in the fashion of a Turkish jubbeh, a red cap, very fine, and\r\ncertain pieces of glass, and had all of them put in a silver dish, and\r\ntwo gilt glasses.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the town we found the King of Zzubu at his palace,\r\nsitting on the ground on a mat made of palm, with many people about\r\nhim. He was quite naked, except that he had a cloth round his middle,\r\nand a loose wrapper round his head, worked with silk by the needle. He\r\nhad a very heavy chain round his neck, and two gold rings hung in his\r\nears with precious stones. He was a small and fat man, and his face\r\nwas painted with fire in different ways. He was eating on the ground\r\non another palm mat, and was then eating tortoise eggs in two china\r\ndishes, and he had four vessels full of palm wine, which he drank with\r\na cane pipe.[313] We made our obeisance, and presented to him what the\r\ncaptain had sent him, and told him through the interpreter that it was\r\nnot as a return for his present which he had sent to the captain, but\r\nfor the affection which he bore him. That done, his people told him\r\nall the good words and explanations of peace and religion which he had\r\nspoken to them. The king wished to detain us to supper, but we made\r\nour excuses and took leave of him. The prince, nephew of the king,\r\nconducted us to his house, and showed us four girls who played on four\r\ninstruments, which were strange and very soft, and their manner of\r\nplaying is rather musical. Afterwards he made us dance with them. These\r\ngirls were naked except from the waist to the knees, where they wore\r\na wrap made of the palm tree cloth, which covered their middles, and\r\nsome were quite naked. There we made a repast, and then returned to the\r\nships.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, because the night before one of our men had died,\r\nthe interpreter and I, by order of the captain, went to ask the king\r\nfor a place where we might bury the deceased. We found the king\r\naccompanied by a good many people, and, after paying him due honour,\r\nwe told him of the death of our man, and that the captain prayed him\r\nthat he might be put into the ground. He replied that if he and his\r\npeople were ready to obey our master, still more reason was there\r\nfor his land and country being subject to him. After that we said we\r\nwished to consecrate the grave in our fashion and place a cross on\r\nit. The sovereign said that he was content, and that he would worship\r\nthat cross as we did. The deceased was buried in the middle of the\r\nopen space of the town, as decently as possible, and performing the\r\nabove-mentioned ceremonies to set them a good example, and in the\r\nevening we buried another. This done, we brought a good quantity of\r\nmerchandise into the town of this king, and placed it in a house, and\r\nhe took it under his charge and promised that no one would do harm or\r\ninjury to the king. Four of our men were chosen to despatch and sell\r\nthis merchandise. These people live with justice, and good weight and\r\nmeasure, loving peace, and are people who love ease and pleasure.[314]\r\nThey have wooden scales, after the fashion of those of north of the\r\nLoire,[315] for weighing their merchandise. Their houses are made of\r\nwood and beams and canes, founded on piles, and are very high, and\r\nmust be entered by means of ladders; their rooms are like ours, and\r\nunderneath they keep their cattle, such as pigs, goats, and fowls.\r\nThe young people sound bag-pipes,[316] made like ours, and call them\r\nSubin.[317]\r\n\r\nIn this island of the king’s there is a kind of animal carrying a shell\r\ncalled carniolle, fine to look at, which cause the whale to die. For\r\nthe whale swallows them alive; then, when they are inside its body,\r\nthey come out of their shell and go and eat the whale’s heart: and the\r\npeople of this country find this animal alive inside the whale. These\r\nanimals, the carniolles, have the teeth and skin black, and their shell\r\nis white. Their flesh is good to eat, and they call them Laghan.[318]\r\n\r\nThe following Friday we showed them a shop full of our merchandise,\r\nwhich was of various strange sorts, at which they were surprised.\r\nFor metal, iron, and other big goods they gave us gold, and for the\r\nother small and sundry goods they gave us rice, pigs, goats, and other\r\nprovisions. They gave us ten weights of gold for fourteen pounds of\r\niron: each weight is a ducat and a half. The captain-general would\r\nnot allow a large quantity of gold to be taken, so that the sailors\r\nshould not sell what belonged to them too cheap from thirst for gold,\r\nand lest by that means he might be constrained to do likewise with his\r\nmerchandise, for he wished to sell it better.\r\n\r\nSaturday following a scaffolding was made in the open space, fitted\r\nwith tapestry and palm branches, because the king had promised our\r\ncaptain to become Christian on Sunday. He told him not to be afraid\r\nwhen our artillery fired on that day, for it was the custom to load it\r\non those feasts without firing stones or other balls.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, the fourteenth day of April, we went on shore, forty\r\nmen, of whom two were armed, who marched before us, following the\r\nstandard of our king emperor. When we landed the ships discharged\r\nall their artillery, and from fear of it the people ran away in all\r\ndirections. The captain and the king embraced one another, and then\r\njoyously we went near the scaffolding, where the captain and the king\r\nsat on two chairs, one covered with red, the other with violet velvet.\r\nThe principal men sat on cushions, and the others on mats, after the\r\nfashion of the country. Then the captain began to speak to the king\r\nthrough the interpreter to incite him to the faith of Jesus Christ,\r\nand told him that if he wished to be a good Christian, as he had said\r\nthe day before, that he must burn all the idols of his country, and,\r\ninstead of them, place a cross, and that everyone should worship it\r\nevery day on their knees, and their hands joined to heaven: and he\r\nshowed him how he ought every day to make the sign of the cross. To\r\nthat the king and all his people answered that they would obey the\r\ncommands of the captain and do all that he told them. The captain took\r\nthe king by the hand, and they walked about on the scaffolding, and\r\nwhen he was baptised he said that he would name him[319] Don Charles,\r\nas the emperor his sovereign was named; and he named the prince Don\r\nFernand, after the brother of the emperor, and the King of Mazzava\r\nJehan: to the Moor he gave the name of Christopher, and to the others\r\neach a name of his fancy. Thus, before mass, there were fifty men\r\nbaptised. After mass had been heard the captain invited the king\r\nand his other principal men to dine with him, but he would not. He\r\naccompanied the captain, however, to the beach, and on his arrival\r\nthere the ships fired all their artillery. Then, embracing one another,\r\nthey took leave.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner our chaplain and some of us went on shore to baptise\r\nthe queen. She came with forty ladies, and we conducted them on to\r\nthe scaffolding; then made her sit down on a cushion, and her women\r\naround her, until the priest was ready. During that time they showed\r\nher an image of our Lady, of wood, holding her little child, which\r\nwas very well made, and a cross. When she saw it, she had a greater\r\ndesire to be a Christian, and, asking for baptism, she was baptised and\r\nnamed Jehanne, like the mother of the emperor. The wife of the prince,\r\ndaughter of this queen, had the name of Catherine, the Queen of Mazzava\r\nIsabella, and the others each their name. That day we baptised eight\r\nhundred persons of men, women, and children. The Queen was young and\r\nhandsome, covered with a black and white sheet; she had the mouth and\r\nnails very red, and wore on her head a large hat made of leaves of\r\npalm, with a crown over it made of the same leaves, like that of the\r\nPope. After that she begged us to give her the little wooden boy to put\r\nin the place of the idols.[320] This we did, and she went away. In the\r\nevening the king and queen, with several of their people, came to the\r\nsea beach, where the captain had some of the large artillery fired, in\r\nwhich they took great pleasure.[321] The captain and the king called\r\none another brother.\r\n\r\nAt last, in eight days, all the inhabitants of this island were\r\nbaptised, and some belonging to the neighbouring islands. In one of\r\nthese we burned a village because the inhabitants would not obey either\r\nthe king or us. There we planted a cross because the people were\r\nGentiles: if they had been Moors, we should have erected a column, as a\r\nsign of their hardness of heart, because the Moors are more difficult\r\nto convert than the Gentiles. The captain-general went ashore every\r\nday to hear mass, to which there came many of the new Christians, to\r\nwhom he explained various points of our religion. One day the queen\r\ncame with all her state. She was preceded by three damsels, who carried\r\nin their hands three of her hats: she was dressed in black and white,\r\nwith a large silk veil with gold stripes, which covered her head and\r\nshoulders. Very many women followed her, with their heads covered with\r\na small veil, and a hat above that: the rest of their bodies and feet\r\nwere naked, except a small wrapper of palm cloth which covered their\r\nnatural parts. Their hair fell flowing over their shoulders. The queen,\r\nafter making a bow to the altar, sat upon a cushion of embroidered\r\nsilk, and the captain sprinkled over her and over some of her ladies\r\nrose water and musk, a perfume which pleases the ladies of this country\r\nvery much. The captain on that occasion approved of the gift which I\r\nhad made to the queen of the image of the Infant Jesus, and recommended\r\nher to put it in the place of her idols, because it was a remembrancer\r\nof the Son of God. She promised to do all this, and to keep it with\r\nmuch care.\r\n\r\nIn order that the king might be more respected and obeyed, the\r\ncaptain-general got him to come one day at the hour of mass with his\r\nsilk robe, and summoned his two brothers, one named Bondara, who was\r\nthe father of the prince, and the other named Cadaro, and some of his\r\nchief men, whose names were Simiut, Sibuaia, Sisacai,[322] Magalibe,\r\nand others whom it is unnecessary to name separately; and he made\r\nthem all swear to be obedient to their king, whose hand they all of\r\nthem kissed. He then asked the king to swear that he would always be\r\nobedient and faithful to the King of Spain, and he took the oath. Then\r\nthe captain drew a sword before the image of the Virgin Mary, and said\r\nto the king that when such an oath had been taken by anyone, he should\r\nrather die than be wanting to his oath. After that he himself promised\r\nto be always faithful to him, swearing by the image of our Lady, by the\r\nlife of the emperor his sovereign, and by the habit which he wore. He\r\nthen made a present to the king of a velvet chair, and told him that\r\nwherever he went he should always have it carried before him by some of\r\nhis attendants, and showed him the way in which it should be carried.\r\nThe king told the captain that he would do all this on account of the\r\naffection which he bore him, of which he wished to give him a token,\r\npreparing for that purpose some jewels to present to him; these were\r\ntwo rather large gold rings for the ears, two others for the arms,\r\nand two for the ancles, all of them adorned with precious stones. The\r\nfinest ornaments of the kings of these countries consist in these\r\nrings, for otherwise they go naked and barefooted, with only a piece of\r\ncloth from the waist to the knees.\r\n\r\nThe captain-general, who had informed the king and all those who\r\nhad been baptised of the obligation they were under of burning their\r\nidols, which they had promised to do, seeing that they retained them\r\nand made them offerings of meat, reproved them severely for it. They\r\nthought to excuse themselves sufficiently by saying that they did not\r\ndo that now on their own account, but for a sick person, for the idols\r\nto restore him his health. This sick man was a brother of the prince,\r\nand was reputed to be the most valiant and wise man in the island, and\r\nhis illness was so severe that for four days he had not spoken. Having\r\nheard this, the captain, seized with zeal for religion, said that if\r\nthey had a true faith in Jesus Christ, they should burn all the idols,\r\nand the sick man should be baptised, and he would be immediately cured,\r\nof which he was so certain that he consented to lose his head if the\r\nmiracle did not take place. The king promised that all this should be\r\ndone, because he truly believed in Jesus Christ. Then we arranged, with\r\nall the pomp that was possible, a procession from the place to the\r\nhouse of the sick man. We went there, and indeed found him unable to\r\nspeak or to move. We baptised him, with two of his wives and ten girls.\r\nThe captain then asked him how he felt, and he at once spoke, and said\r\nthat by the grace of Our Lord he was well enough. This great miracle\r\nwas done under our eyes. The captain, on hearing him speak, gave great\r\nthanks to God. He gave him a refreshing drink to take, and afterwards\r\nsent to his house a mattress, two sheets, a covering of yellow wool,\r\nand a cushion, and he continued to send him, until he was quite well,\r\nrefreshing drinks of almonds, rosewater, rosoglio, and some sweet\r\npreserves.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day the convalescent rose from his bed, and as soon as\r\nhe could walk, he had burned, in the presence of the king and of all\r\nthe people, an idol which some old women had concealed in his house.\r\nHe also caused to be destroyed several temples constructed on the sea\r\nshore, in which people were accustomed to eat the meat offered to\r\nthe idols. The inhabitants applauded this, and, shouting “Castile,\r\nCastile,” helped to throw them down, and declared that if God gave them\r\nlife they would burn all the idols they could find, even if they were\r\nin the king’s own house.\r\n\r\nThese idols are made of wood, they are concave or hollowed out behind,\r\nthey have the arms and legs spread out, and the feet turned upwards;\r\nthey have a large face, with four very large teeth like those of a wild\r\nboar, and they are all painted.\r\n\r\nSince I have spoken of the idols, it may please your illustrious\r\nHighness to have an account of the ceremony with which, in this island,\r\nthey bless the pig. They begin by sounding some great drums (tamburi),\r\nthey then bring three large dishes, two are filled with cakes of rice\r\nand cooked millet rolled up in leaves, and roast fish, in the third\r\nare Cambay clothes, and two strips of palm cloth. A cloth of Cambay\r\nis spread out on the ground: then two old women come, each of whom\r\nhas in her hand a reed trumpet. They step upon the cloth and make\r\nan obeisance to the Sun: they then clothe themselves with the above\r\nmentioned cloths. The first of these puts on her head a handkerchief\r\nwhich she ties on her forehead so as to make two horns, and taking\r\nanother handkerchief in her hand, dances and sounds her trumpet, and\r\ninvokes the Sun. The second old woman takes one of the strips of palm\r\ncloth, and dances, and also sounds her trumpet; thus they dance and\r\nsound their trumpets for a short space of time, saying several things\r\nto the sun. The first old woman then drops the handkerchief she has\r\nin her hand, and takes the other strip of cloth, and both together\r\nsounding their trumpets, dance for a long time round the pig which is\r\nbound on the ground. The first one always speaks in a low tone to the\r\nsun, and the second answers her. The second old woman then presents\r\na cup of wine to the first, who, whilst they both continue their\r\naddress to the sun, brings the cup four or five times near her mouth as\r\nthough going to drink, and meanwhile sprinkles the wine on the heart\r\nof the pig. She then gives up the cup, and receives a lance which she\r\nbrandishes, whilst still dancing and reciting, and four or five times\r\ndirects the lance at the pig’s heart, at last with a sudden and well\r\naimed blow she pierces it through and through. She withdraws the lance\r\nfrom the wound, which is then closed and dressed with herbs. During the\r\nceremony a torch is always burning, and the old woman who pierced the\r\npig takes and puts it out with her mouth, the other old woman dips the\r\nend of her trumpet in the pig’s blood, and with it marks with blood the\r\nforehead of her husband, and of her companion, and then of the rest\r\nof the people. But they did not come and do this to us. That done the\r\nold women took off their robes, and ate what was in the two dishes,\r\ninviting only women to join them. After that they get the hair off the\r\npig with fire. Only old women are able to consecrate the boar in this\r\nmanner, and this animal is never eaten unless it is killed in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (_Here follows an account of a custom, for a description of\r\n          which see De Morga’s Philippine Islands, p. 304._)\r\n\r\nWhen our people went on shore by day or by night, they always met with\r\nsome one who invited them to eat and drink. They only half cook their\r\nvictuals, and salt them very much, which makes them drink a great deal;\r\nand they drink much with reeds, sucking the wine from the vessels.\r\nTheir repasts always last from five to six hours.\r\n\r\nWhen one of their chiefs dies they always use the following funeral\r\nceremonies, of which I was witness. The most respected women of the\r\ncountry came to the house of the deceased, in the midst of which lay\r\nthe corpse in a chest; round which were stretched cords after the\r\nmanner of an enclosure, and many branches of trees were tied to these\r\ncords: a strip of cotton was fastened to each of these branches like a\r\npennant. Under these the women I have mentioned sat down covered with\r\nwhite cotton cloth. Each of them had a damsel who fanned her with a\r\npalm fan. The other women sat sadly round the room. Meanwhile a woman\r\ncut off by degrees the hair of the dead man with a knife: another who\r\nhad been his principal wife, lay extended on him, with her mouth hands\r\nand feet on the mouth hands and feet of the dead man. When the first\r\nwoman cut off the hair, she wept, and when she stopped cutting, she\r\nsung. Round the room there were many vases of porcelain, with embers\r\nin them, on which, from time to time, they threw myrrh, storax, and\r\nbenzoin, which gave out a good and strong smell in the room. These\r\nceremonies last for five or six days, during which the corpse is kept\r\nin the house, and I believe that they anoint it with oil of camphor\r\nto preserve it. They afterwards put it in a chest, closed with wooden\r\nbolts, and place it in an enclosed place covered with logs of wood.\r\n\r\nThe islanders told us that every evening towards midnight, there used\r\nto come to the city, a black bird of the size of a crow, which perching\r\non the houses whistled, and caused all the dogs to howl, and these\r\ndouble cries lasted four or five hours. They would never tell us the\r\ncause of that phenomenon, of which we also were witnesses.\r\n\r\nFriday, the 26th of April, Zula, who was one of the principal men or\r\nchiefs of the island of Matan, sent to the captain a son of his with\r\ntwo goats to make a present of them, and to say that if he did not do\r\nall that he had promised, the cause of that was another chief named\r\nSilapulapu, who would not in any way obey the King of Spain, and had\r\nprevented him from doing so: but that if the captain would send him the\r\nfollowing night one boat full of men to give him assistance, he would\r\nfight and subdue his rival. On the receipt of this message, the captain\r\ndecided to go himself with three boats. We entreated him much not to\r\ngo to this enterprise in person, but he as a good shepherd would not\r\nabandon his flock.\r\n\r\nWe set out from Zubu at midnight, we were sixty men armed with\r\ncorslets and helmets; there were with us the Christian king, the\r\nprince, and some of the chief men, and many others divided among twenty\r\nor thirty balangai. We arrived at Matan three hours before daylight.\r\nThe captain before attacking wished to attempt gentle means, and sent\r\non shore the Moorish merchant to tell those islanders who were of\r\nthe party of Cilapulapu, that if they would recognise the Christian\r\nking as their sovereign, and obey the King of Spain, and pay us the\r\ntribute which had been asked, the captain would become their friend,\r\notherwise we should prove how our lances wounded. The islanders were\r\nnot terrified, they replied that if we had lances, so also had they,\r\nalthough only of reeds, and wood hardened with fire. They asked however\r\nthat we should not attack them by night, but wait for daylight, because\r\nthey were expecting reinforcements, and would be in greater number.\r\nThis they said with cunning, to excite us to attack them by night,\r\nsupposing that we were ready; but they wished this because they had\r\ndug ditches between their houses and the beach, and they hoped that we\r\nshould fall into them.\r\n\r\nWe however waited for daylight; we then leaped into the water up to\r\nour thighs, for on account of the shallow water and the rocks the\r\nboats could not come close to the beach, and we had to cross two good\r\ncrossbow shots through the water before reaching it. We were forty-nine\r\nin number, the other eleven remained in charge of the boats. When we\r\nreached land we found the islanders fifteen hundred in number, drawn\r\nup in three squadrons; they came down upon us with terrible shouts,\r\ntwo squadrons attacking us on the flanks, and the third in front.\r\nThe captain then divided his men in two bands. Our musketeers and\r\ncrossbow-men fired for half an hour from a distance, but did nothing,\r\nsince the bullets and arrows, though they passed through their shields\r\nmade of thin wood, and perhaps wounded their arms, yet did not stop\r\nthem. The captain shouted not to fire, but he was not listened to. The\r\nislanders seeing that the shots of our guns did them little or no harm\r\nwould not retire, but shouted more loudly, and springing from one side\r\nto the other to avoid our shots, they at the same time drew nearer to\r\nus, throwing arrows, javelins, spears hardened in fire, stones, and\r\neven mud, so that we could hardly defend ourselves. Some of them cast\r\nlances pointed with iron at the captain-general.\r\n\r\nHe then, in order to disperse this multitude and to terrify them, sent\r\nsome of our men to set fire to their houses, but this rendered them\r\nmore ferocious. Some of them ran to the fire, which consumed twenty or\r\nthirty houses, and there killed two of our men. The rest came down upon\r\nus with greater fury; they perceived that our bodies were defended,\r\nbut that the legs were exposed, and they aimed at them principally.\r\nThe captain had his right leg pierced by a poisoned arrow, on which\r\naccount he gave orders to retreat by degrees; but almost all our men\r\ntook to precipitate flight, so that there remained hardly six or eight\r\nof us with him. We were oppressed by the lances and stones which the\r\nenemy hurled at us, and we could make no more resistance. The bombards\r\nwhich we had in the boats were of no assistance to us, for the shoal\r\nwater kept them too far from the beach. We went thither, retreating\r\nlittle by little, and still fighting, and we had already got to the\r\ndistance of a crossbow shot from the shore, having the water up to our\r\nknees, the islanders following and picking up again the spears which\r\nthey had already cast, and they threw the same spear five or six times;\r\nas they knew the captain they aimed specially at him, and twice they\r\nknocked the helmet off his head. He, with a few of us, like a good\r\nknight, remained at his post without choosing to retreat further. Thus\r\nwe fought for more than an hour, until an Indian succeeded in thrusting\r\na cane lance into the captain’s face. He then, being irritated,\r\npierced the Indian’s breast with his lance, and left it in his body,\r\nand trying to draw his sword he was unable to draw it more than half\r\nway, on account of a javelin wound which he had received in the right\r\narm. The enemies seeing this all rushed against him, and one of them\r\nwith a great sword, like a great scimetar[323] gave him a great blow\r\non the left leg, which brought the captain down on his face, then the\r\nIndians threw themselves upon him, and ran him through with lances and\r\nscimetars, and all the other arms which they had, so that they deprived\r\nof life our mirror, light, comfort, and true guide. Whilst the Indians\r\nwere thus overpowering him, several times he turned round towards us\r\nto see if we were all in safety, as though his obstinate fight had no\r\nother object than to give an opportunity for the retreat of his men. We\r\nwho fought to extremity, and who were covered with wounds, seeing that\r\nhe was dead, proceeded to the boats which were on the point of going\r\naway. This fatal battle was fought on the 27th of April of 1521, on a\r\nSaturday; a day which the captain had chosen himself, because he had\r\na special devotion to it. There perished with him eight of our men,\r\nand four of the Indians, who had become Christians; we had also many\r\nwounded, amongst whom I must reckon myself. The enemy lost only fifteen\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHe died; but I hope that your illustrious highness will not allow his\r\nmemory to be lost, so much the more since I see revived in you the\r\nvirtue of so great a captain, since one of his principal virtues was\r\nconstance in the most adverse fortune. In the midst of the sea he was\r\nable to endure hunger better than we. Most versed in nautical charts,\r\nhe knew better than any other the true art of navigation, of which it\r\nis a certain proof that he knew by his genius, and his intrepidity,\r\nwithout any one having given him the example, how to attempt the\r\ncircuit of the globe, which he had almost completed.[324]\r\n\r\nThe Christian king could indeed have given us aid, and would have done\r\nso; but our captain far from forseeing that which happened, when he\r\nlanded with his men, had charged him not to come out of his balangai,\r\nwishing that he should stay there to see how we fought. When he knew\r\nhow the captain had died he wept bitterly for him.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the king himself, with our consent, sent to tell the\r\ninhabitants of Matan, that if they would give up to us the body of our\r\ncaptain, and of our other companions who were killed in this battle, we\r\nwould give them as much merchandise as they might wish for; but they\r\nanswered that on no account would they ever give up that man, but they\r\nwished to preserve him as a monument of their triumph. When the death\r\nof the captain was known, those who were in the city to trade, had all\r\nthe merchandise at once transported to the ships. We then elected in\r\nthe place of the captain, Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese, and a relation\r\nof the captain’s, and Juan Serrano a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nOur interpreter, who was a slave of the captain-general, and was named\r\nHenry, having been slightly wounded in the battle, would not go ashore\r\nany more for the things which we required, but remained all day idle,\r\nand wrapped up in his mat (Schiavina). Duarte Barbosa, the commander\r\nof the flag ship, found fault with him, and told him that though his\r\nmaster was dead, he had not become free on that account, but that when\r\nwe returned to Spain he would return him to Doña Beatrice, the widow\r\nof the captain-general; at the same time he threatened to have him\r\nflogged, if he did not go on shore quickly, and do what was wanted for\r\nthe service of the ships. The slave rose up, and did as though he did\r\nnot care much for these affronts and threats; and having gone on shore,\r\nhe informed the Christian king that we were thinking of going away\r\nsoon, but that if he would follow his advice, he might become master of\r\nall our goods and of the ships themselves. The King of Zubu listened\r\nfavourably to him, and they arranged to betray us. After that the slave\r\nreturned on board, and showed more intelligence and attention than he\r\nhad done before.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, the 1st of May, the Christian king sent to tell\r\nthe two commanders that the jewels prepared as presents for the King\r\nof Spain were ready, and he invited them to come that same day to dine\r\nwith him, with some of his most honoured companions, and he would\r\ngive them over to them. The commanders went with twenty-four others,\r\nand amongst them was our astrologer named San Martin of Seville.\r\nI could not go because I was swelled with a wound from a poisoned\r\narrow in the forehead. Juan Carvalho, with the chief of police, who\r\nalso were invited, turned back, and said that they had suspected\r\nsome bad business, because they had seen the man who had recovered\r\nfrom illness by a miracle, leading away the priest to his own house.\r\nThey had hardly spoken these words when we heard great lamentations\r\nand cries. We quickly got up the anchors and, coming closer to the\r\nbeach, we fired several shots with the cannon at the houses. There\r\nthen appeared on the beach Juan Serrano, in his shirt, wounded and\r\nbound, who entreated us, as loudly as he could, not to fire any more,\r\nor else he would be massacred. We asked him what had become of his\r\ncompanions and the interpreter, and he said that all had been slain\r\nexcept the interpreter. He then entreated us to ransom him with some\r\nmerchandise; but Juan Carvalho, although he was his gossip, joined\r\nwith some others, refused to do it, and they would not allow any boat\r\nto go ashore, so that they might remain masters of the ships. Serrano\r\ncontinued his entreaties and lamentations, saying, that if we departed\r\nand abandoned him there, he would soon be killed; and after that he saw\r\nhis lamentations were useless, he added that he prayed God to ask for\r\nan account of his life at the day of Judgment from Juan Carvalho, his\r\ngossip.[325] Notwithstanding, we sailed immediately; and I never heard\r\nany more news of him.\r\n\r\nIn this island of Zubu there are dogs and cats, and other animals,\r\nwhose flesh is eaten; there is also rice, millet, panicum, and maize;\r\nthere are also figs, oranges, lemons, sugar-canes, cocos, gourds,\r\nginger, honey, and other such things; they also make palm-wine of\r\nmany qualities. Gold is abundant. The island is large, and has a\r\ngood port with two entrances: one to the west, and the other to the\r\neast-north-east. It is in ten degrees north latitude and 154 east\r\nlongitude from the line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nIn this island there are several towns, each of which has its principal\r\nmen or chiefs. Here are the names of the towns and their chiefs:—\r\n\r\nCingapola: its chiefs are Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaninga, Cimaticat,\r\nCicanbul.[326]\r\n\r\nMandani: its chief is Aponoaan.\r\n\r\nLalan: its chief is Teten.\r\n\r\nLalutan: its chief is Japau.\r\n\r\nLubucin: its chief is Cilumai.\r\n\r\nAll these countries were in obedience to us, and paid a kind of tribute.\r\n\r\nNear to Zubu there is, as we said, the island of Matan, the most\r\nconsiderable town of which is called Matan, and its chiefs are Zula and\r\nCilapulapu. The village, which we burned on the occasion of the fatal\r\nbattle, is named Bulaia.\r\n\r\nIn this island, before we lost our captain-general, we had news of\r\nMaluco.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (_Book III of the Milan Edition._)\r\n\r\n                        +Departure from Zubu.+\r\n\r\nWhen we were at a distance of eighteen leagues from the island of\r\nZubu, near the head of another island called Bohol,[327] in the midst\r\nof that archipelago, seeing that our crews were too much reduced in\r\nnumber, so that they were not sufficient for managing all the three\r\nships, we burned the _Conception_ after transporting into the other two\r\nall that it contained that was serviceable. We then took the S.S.W.\r\ncourse, coasting along an island called Panilongon,[328] where the\r\npeople were black as in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nWe then arrived at a large island,[329] the king of which having come\r\non board our ship, in order to show that he made alliance with us and\r\nwould be friendly, drew blood from his left hand, and stained with it\r\nhis breast, his face, and the tip of his tongue. We then did likewise,\r\nand when the king went away, I alone accompanied him on shore to see\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nWe entered a river[330] where we met many fishermen, who presented some\r\nof their fish to the king. He then took off the cloth which covered his\r\nmiddle, and some of his chief men who were with him did the same, they\r\nthen all began to row and to sing. Passing near many houses, which were\r\non the brink of the river, we arrived at two hours of the night[331]\r\nat the house of the king, which was two leagues from the mouth of the\r\nriver where the ships were.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the house, people came to meet us with many torches,\r\nmade of canes and palm leaves, full of the before-mentioned gum, called\r\n_anime_. Whilst supper was being got ready, the king, with two of his\r\nchiefs, and two rather handsome ladies, drank a large vase full of\r\npalm wine, without eating anything. I, excusing myself saying that I\r\nhad already supped, only drank once. In drinking they use the ceremony\r\nwhich I have already described in speaking of the King of Massava.[332]\r\nThen the supper was brought, which consisted of rice and fish, very\r\nmuch salted, in porcelain dishes. Rice with them takes the place of\r\nbread. They cook it in the following manner, which is common to all\r\nthese countries. They place inside an earthen pot like ours, a large\r\nleaf which lines it all round internally, then they put in the water\r\nand the rice, and cover up the pot. They let it boil until the rice has\r\ntaken the consistency of bread, and then they take it out in pieces.\r\n\r\nWhen the supper was over the king had brought a cane mat, and a mat of\r\npalm leaf, with a cushion of leaves, and this was to be my bed. I slept\r\nthere with one of his chiefs. The king with the two ladies went to\r\nsleep in another place.\r\n\r\nWhen it was day, whilst breakfast was being prepared, I went to take\r\na turn in the island, and entered several houses, constructed like\r\nthose of the neighbouring islands; I saw there a good many utensils\r\nof gold, but very little victuals. I returned to the king’s house,\r\nand we breakfasted with rice and fish. I succeeded in making the king\r\nunderstand by signs, that I should like to see the queen; and he made\r\na sign to me that he was content, and we set out together to the top\r\nof a hill, under which her house was placed. I entered the house and\r\nmade her an obeisance, she did likewise to me. I sat down by the side\r\nof her; she was weaving a palm mat to sleep upon. Throughout her house\r\nwere seen porcelain vases suspended to the walls, and four metal\r\ntimbals, of which one was very large, another of middle size, and two\r\nsmall ones, and she amused herself by playing on them. There were many\r\nmale and female slaves for her service. We asked leave and returned to\r\nthe king’s house, who immediately ordered a refreshment of sugar canes.\r\n\r\nAfter midday, as I wished to return to the ships, the king, with\r\nthe other chief men of the island, desired to accompany me in the\r\nsame _balangai_, going by the same river; on its right bank I saw on\r\nan eminence three men hanging to a tree, the branches of which had\r\nbeen cut off. I asked of the king what those unhappy people were, he\r\nanswered me that they were malefactors and thieves. These people go\r\nnaked like their neighbours. In this island are found pigs, goats,\r\nfowls, rice, ginger, find other things which were common to the islands\r\nnamed before. That which is most abundant is gold. They showed me\r\ncertain valleys, making signs that there was more gold there than hairs\r\non the head, but that as they had not iron to dig it out, it required\r\ngreat labour to acquire it, and which they did not choose to undergo.\r\nThe king is named Raja Calanao.\r\n\r\nThis part of the island called Chipit is the same land as Butuan and\r\nCalagan, it passes above Bohol, and borders on Massava. Its port is\r\ngood enough; it is in 8° N. latitude, and 167° of longitude from the\r\nline of demarcation; it is fifty leagues distance from Zubu. Towards\r\nthe North-west is the island of Lozon,[333] which is at two days’\r\ndistance; a large island, to which come to trade every year six or\r\neight junks of the people called Lequii.[334]\r\n\r\nOn leaving this place, and taking our course between west and\r\nsouth-west, we touched at an almost uninhabited island, which\r\nafterwards we learned was named Cagayan. The few people there are\r\nMoors, who have been banished from an island called Burné.[335] They\r\ngo naked like the others, and carry blow-pipes with small quivers at\r\ntheir sides full of arrows, and a herb with which they poison them.\r\nThey have daggers, with hilts adorned with gold and precious stones,\r\nlances, bucklers, and small cuirasses of buffaloes’ hide. These people\r\ntook us for something Divine or holy. There are some very large trees\r\nin this island, but little victuals. It is in 7° 30′ North latitude,\r\nand forty-three leagues from Chipit.\r\n\r\nContinuing our voyage we changed our course to between West and\r\nNorth-west, and after running twenty-five leagues, we arrived at a\r\nlarge island, which we found well provided with victuals, and it was\r\ngreat good fortune for us since we were so reduced by hunger and so\r\nbadly supplied, that we were several times on the point of abandoning\r\nthe ships, and establishing ourselves on some land, in order to live.\r\nIn this island, which we learned was named Palaoan, we found pigs,\r\ngoats, fowls, yams, bananas of various kinds, some of which are half a\r\ncubit long, and as thick as the arm, others are only a span long, and\r\nothers are still smaller, and these are the best; they have cocoa nuts,\r\nsugar canes, and certain roots like turnips. They cook rice under the\r\nfire in bamboo canes, or wooden vessels, and it keeps longer than that\r\ncooked in earthen pots. They draw from the rice with a kind of alembic\r\na wine that is better and stronger than the palm wine. In short we\r\nfound this island to be a promised land.\r\n\r\nWe presented ourselves to the king, who contracted alliance and\r\nfriendship with us, and to assure us of it, he asked for one of our\r\nknives, with which he drew blood from his breast, with which he touched\r\nhis forehead and tongue. We repeated the same ceremony.[336]\r\n\r\nThe people of Palaoan go naked like the other islanders, they almost\r\nall till their own fields. They have blow-pipes, with thick arrows more\r\nthan a span in length, with a point like that of a harpoon; some have\r\na point made with a fish bone, and others are of reed, poisoned with a\r\ncertain herb; the arrows are not trimmed with feathers, but with a soft\r\nlight wood. At the foot of the blow-pipe they bind a piece of iron, by\r\nmeans of which, when they have no more arrows, they wield the blow-pipe\r\nlike a lance. They like to adorn themselves with rings and chains of\r\ngimp and with little bells, but above all they are fond of brass wire,\r\nwith which they bind their fish hooks. They have some rather large\r\ndomestic cocks, which, from some superstition, they do not eat, but\r\nthey keep them for fighting; on such occasions they make bets and offer\r\nprizes, which are acquired by the owner of the conquering cock.\r\n\r\nGoing from Palaoan towards the South-west, after a run of ten leagues,\r\nwe reached another island.[337] Whilst coasting it, it seemed in a\r\ncertain manner to go forward;[338] we coasted it for a distance of\r\nfully fifty[339] leagues, until we found a port. We had hardly reached\r\nthe port when the heavens were darkened, and the lights of St. Elmo\r\nappeared on our masts.\r\n\r\nThe next day the king of that island sent a prahu to the ships; it was\r\nvery handsome, with its prow and stern ornamented with gold; on the\r\nbow fluttered a white and blue flag, with a tuft of peacock’s feathers\r\nat the top of the staff; there were in the prahu some people playing\r\non pipes and drums, and many other persons. Two almadias followed the\r\nprahu; these are fishermen’s boats, and a prahu is a kind of fusta.\r\nEight old men of the chiefs of the island came into the ships, and\r\nsat down upon a carpet on the poop, and presented a painted wooden\r\nvase full of betel and areca (fruits which they constantly chew), with\r\norange and jessamine flowers, and covered over with a cloth of yellow\r\nsilk. They also gave two cages full of fowls, two goats, three vessels\r\nfull of wine, distilled from rice, and some bundles of sugar cane. They\r\ndid the same to the other ship; and embracing us they departed. Their\r\nrice wine is clear like water, but so strong that many of our men were\r\nintoxicated. They call it arak.\r\n\r\nSix days later the king again sent three very ornamented prahus, which\r\ncame playing pipes and drums and cymbals, and going round the ships,\r\ntheir crews saluted us with their cloth caps, which hardly cover the\r\ntops of their heads. We saluted them, firing the bombards without\r\nstones. Then they made us a present of various victuals, but all made\r\nwith rice, either wrapped in leaves in the form of a long cylinder, or\r\nin the shape of a sugar loaf, or in the shape of a cake, with eggs and\r\nhoney. They then said that their king was well pleased that we should\r\nmake provisions here of wood and water, and that we might traffic at\r\nour pleasure with the islanders. Having heard this, seven of us entered\r\none of the prahus, taking with us presents for the king, and for some\r\nof his court. The present intended for the king consisted in a Turkish\r\ncoat of green velvet, a chair of violet coloured velvet, five ells of\r\nred cloth, a cap, a gilt goblet, and a vase of glass, with its cover,\r\nthree packets of paper, and a gilt pen and ink case. We took for the\r\nqueen three ells of yellow cloth, a pair of slippers, ornamented with\r\nsilver, and a silver case full of pins. For the king’s governor or\r\nminister three ells of red cloth, a cap, and a gilt goblet; and for the\r\nherald who had come in the prahu, a coat of the Turkish fashion, of red\r\nand green colours, a cap and a packet of paper. For the other seven\r\nchief men who had come with him, we prepared presents; for one cloth,\r\nfor another a cap, and for each a packet of paper. Having made these\r\npreparations, we entered the prahu, and departed.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the city, we were obliged to wait about two hours\r\nin the prahu, until there came thither two elephants covered with\r\nsilk, and twelve men, each of whom carried a porcelain vase covered\r\nwith silk, for conveying and wrapping up our presents. We mounted\r\nthe elephants, and those twelve men preceded us, carrying the vases\r\nwith our presents. We went as far as the house of the governor, who\r\ngave us supper with many sorts of viands. There we slept through the\r\nnight, on mattresses filled with cotton, and covered with silk, with\r\nsheets of Cambay stuff.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we remained doing nothing in the house till\r\nmidday, and after that we set out for the king’s palace. We were again\r\nmounted upon the elephants, and the men with the presents preceded\r\nus as before. From the governor’s house to that of the king, all the\r\nstreets were full of men armed with swords, spears, and bucklers, the\r\nking having so commanded. We entered the palace still mounted upon the\r\nelephants; we then dismounted, and ascended a staircase, accompanied by\r\nthe governor and some of the chief men, and entered a large room full\r\nof courtiers, whom we should call the barons of the kingdom; there we\r\nsat upon a carpet, and the vases with the presents were placed near us.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this hall there was another a little higher, but not so\r\nlarge, all hung with silk stuffs, among which were two curtains of\r\nbrocade hung up, and leaving open two windows which gave light to the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThere were placed three hundred men of the king’s guard with naked\r\ndaggers in their hands, which they held on their thighs. At the end\r\nof this second hall was a great opening, covered with a curtain of\r\nbrocade, and on this being raised we saw the king sitting at a table,\r\nwith a little child of his, chewing betel. Behind him there were only\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThen one of the chief men informed us that we could not speak to the\r\nking, but that if we wished to convey anything to him, we were to say\r\nit to him, and he would say it to a chief or courtier of higher rank,\r\nwho would lay it before a brother of the governor, who was in the\r\nsmaller room, and they by means of a blow pipe placed in a fissure in\r\nthe wall would communicate our thoughts to a man who was near the king,\r\nand from him the king would understand them. He taught us meanwhile\r\nto make three obeisances to the king, with the hands joined above the\r\nhead, raising first one then the other foot, and then to kiss the hands\r\nto him. This is the royal obeisance.\r\n\r\nThen by the mode which had been indicated to us, we gave him to\r\nunderstand that we belonged to the King of Spain, who wished to be in\r\npeace with him, and wished for nothing else than to be able to trade\r\nwith his island. The king caused an answer to be given that he was most\r\npleased that the king of Spain was his friend, and that we could take\r\nwood and water in his states, and traffic according to our pleasure.\r\nThat done we offered the presents, and at each thing which they gave\r\nto him, he made a slight inclination with his head. To each of us was\r\nthen given some brocade, with cloth of gold, and some silk, which they\r\nplaced upon one of our shoulders, and then took away to take care of\r\nthem. A collation of cloves and cinnamon was then served to us, and\r\nafter that the curtains were drawn and the windows closed. All the men\r\nwho were in the palace had their middles covered with cloth of gold and\r\nsilk, they carried in their hands daggers with gold hilts, adorned with\r\npearls and precious stones, and they had many rings on their fingers.\r\n\r\nWe again mounted the elephants, and returned to the house of the\r\ngovernor. Seven men preceded us there, carrying the presents made to\r\nus, and when we reached the house they gave to each one of us what\r\nwas for him, putting it on our left shoulder, as had been done in the\r\nking’s palace. To each of these seven men we gave a pair of knives in\r\nrecompense for their trouble.\r\n\r\nAfterwards there came nine men to the governor’s house, sent by the\r\nking, with as many large wooden trays, in each of which were ten or\r\ntwelve china dishes, with the flesh of various animals, such as veal,\r\ncapons, fowls, peacocks, and others, with various sorts of fish, so\r\nthat only of flesh there were thirty or thirty-two different viands.\r\nWe supped on the ground on a palm mat; at each mouthful we drank a\r\nlittle china cup of the size of an egg full of the distilled liquor of\r\nrice: we then ate some rice and some things made of sugar, using gold\r\nspoons made like ours. In the place in which we passed the two nights\r\nthere were two candles of white wax always burning, placed on high\r\nchandeliers of silver, and two oil lamps with four wicks each. Two men\r\nkept watch there to take care of them. The next morning we came upon\r\nthe same elephants to the sea shore, where there were two prahus ready,\r\nin which we were taken back to the ships.\r\n\r\nThis city is entirely built on foundations in the salt water, except\r\nthe houses of the king and some of the princes: it contains twenty-five\r\nthousand fires or families.[340] The houses are all of wood, placed on\r\ngreat piles to raise them high up. When the tide rises the women go\r\nin boats through the city selling provisions and necessaries.[341] In\r\nfront of the king’s house there is a wall made of great bricks, with\r\nbarbicans like forts, upon which were fifty-six bombards of metal, and\r\nsix of iron. They fired many shots from them during the two days that\r\nwe passed in the city.\r\n\r\nThe king to whom we presented ourselves is a Moor, and is named Raja\r\nSiripada: he is about forty years of age, and is rather corpulent.\r\nNo one serves him except ladies who are the daughters of the chiefs.\r\nNo one speaks to him except by means of the blow-pipe as has been\r\ndescribed above. He has ten scribes, who write down his affairs on thin\r\nbark of trees, and are called _chiritoles_.[342] He never goes out of\r\nhis house except to go hunting.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 29th of July, we saw coming towards us more than a\r\nhundred prahus, divided into three squadrons, and as many _tungulis_,\r\nwhich are their smaller kind of boats. At this sight, and fearing\r\ntreachery, we hurriedly set sail, and left behind an anchor in the\r\nsea. Our suspicions increased when we observed that behind us were\r\ncertain junks which had come the day before. Our first operation was\r\nto free ourselves from the junks, against which we fired, capturing\r\nfour and killing many people: three or four other junks went aground in\r\nescaping. In one of those which we captured was a son of the king of\r\nthe isle of Luzon, who was captain-general of the King of Burné, and\r\nwho was coming with the junks from the conquest of a great city named\r\nLaoe, situated on a headland of this island opposite Java Major. He\r\nhad made this expedition and sacked that city because its inhabitants\r\nwished rather to obey the King of Java than the Moorish King of Burné.\r\nThe Moorish king having heard of the ill-treatment by us of his junks,\r\nhastened to send to say, by means of one of our men who was on shore to\r\ntraffic, that those vessels had not come to do any harm to us, but were\r\ngoing to make war against the Gentiles, in proof of which they showed\r\nus some of the heads of those they had slain.\r\n\r\nHearing this, we sent to tell the king that if it was so, that he\r\nshould allow two of our men who were still on shore, with a son of our\r\npilot, Juan Carvalho, to come to the ships: this son of Carvalho’s had\r\nbeen born during his first residence in the country of Brazil: but the\r\nking would not consent. Juan Carvalho was thus specially punished, for\r\nwithout communicating the matter to us, in order to obtain a large sum\r\nof gold, as we learned later, he had given his liberty to the captain\r\nof the junks. If he had detained him, the King Siripada would have\r\ngiven anything to get him back, that captain being exceedingly dreaded\r\nby the Gentiles who are most hostile to the Moorish king.\r\n\r\nAnd, with respect to that, it is well to know and understand that in\r\nthat same port where we were, beyond the city of the Moors of which I\r\nhave spoken, there is another inhabited by Gentiles, larger than this\r\none, and also built in the salt water. So great is the enmity between\r\nthe two nations that every day there occurs strife. The king of the\r\nGentiles is as powerful as the king of the Moors, but he is not so\r\nproud; and it seems that it would not be so difficult to introduce the\r\nChristian religion into his country.[343]\r\n\r\nAs we could not get back our men, we retained on board sixteen of the\r\nchiefs, and three ladies whom we had taken on board the junks, to take\r\nthem to Spain. We had destined the ladies for the Queen; but Juan\r\nCarvalho kept them for himself.\r\n\r\nThe Moors of Burné go naked like the other islanders. They esteem\r\nquicksilver very much, and swallow it. They pretend that it preserves\r\nthe health of those who are well, and that it cures the sick.\r\nThey venerate Mahomed and follow his law. They do not eat pig’s\r\nflesh....[344] With their right hand they wash their face, but do not\r\nwash their teeth with their fingers. They are circumcised like the\r\nJews. They never kill goats or fowls without first speaking to the\r\nsun.[345] They cut off the ends of the wings of fowls and the skin\r\nunder their feet, and then split them in two. They do not eat any\r\nanimal which has not been killed by themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this island is produced camphor, a kind of balsam which exudes from\r\nbetween the bark and the wood of the tree. These drops are small as\r\ngrains of bran. If it is left exposed by degrees it is consumed: here\r\nit is called capor. Here is found also cinnamon, ginger, mirabolans,\r\noranges, lemons, sugarcanes, melons, gourds, cucumbers, cabbage,\r\nonions. There are also many animals, such as elephants, horses,\r\nbuffaloes, pigs, goats, fowls, geese, crows, and others.\r\n\r\nThey say that the King of Burné has two pearls as large as a hen’s\r\neggs, and so perfectly round that if placed on a smooth table they\r\ncannot be made to stand still. When we took him the presents I made\r\nsigns to him that I desired to see them, and he said that he would show\r\nthem to me, but he did not do so. On the following day some of the\r\nchief men told me that they had indeed seen them.\r\n\r\nThe money which the Moors use in this country is of metal,[346] and\r\npierced for stringing together. On one side only it has four signs,\r\nwhich are four letters of the great King of China: they call it\r\n_Picis_.[347] For one cathil (a weight equal to two of our pounds)\r\nof quicksilver they gave us six porcelain dishes, for a cathil of\r\nmetal they gave one small porcelain vase, and a large vase for three\r\nknives. For a hand of paper they gave one hundred picis. A _bahar_\r\nof wax (which is two hundred and three cathils) for one hundred and\r\nsixty cathils of bronze: for eighty cathils a bahar of salt: for forty\r\ncathils a bahar of _anime_, a gum which they use to caulk ships, for\r\nin these countries they have no pitch. Twenty tabil make a cathil.\r\nThe merchandise which is most esteemed here is bronze, quicksilver,\r\ncinnabar, glass, woollen stuffs, linens; but above all they esteem iron\r\nand spectacles.\r\n\r\nSince I saw such use made of porcelain, I got some information\r\nrespecting it, and I learned that it is made with a kind of very white\r\nearth, which is left underground for fully fifty years to refine it, so\r\nthat they are in the habit of saying that the father buries it for his\r\nson. It is said that if poison is put into a vessel of fine porcelain\r\nit breaks immediately.\r\n\r\nThe junks mentioned several times above are their largest vessels,\r\nand they are constructed in this manner. The lower part of the ships\r\nand the sides to a height of two spans above water-line are built of\r\nplanks joined together with wooden bolts, and they are well enough\r\nput together. The upper works are made of very large canes for a\r\ncounterpoise.[348] One of these junks carries as much cargo as our\r\nships. The masts are of bamboo, and the sails of bark of trees. This\r\nisland is so large that to sail round it with a prahu would require\r\nthree months. It is in 5° 15′ north latitude and 176° 40′ of longitude\r\nfrom the line of demarcation.[349]\r\n\r\nOn leaving this island we returned backwards to look for a convenient\r\nplace for caulking our ships, which were leaking, and one of them,\r\nthrough the negligence of the pilot, struck on a shoal near an island\r\nnamed Bibalon;[350] but, by the help of God, we got her off. We also\r\nran another great danger, for a sailor, in snuffing a candle, threw the\r\nlighted wick into a chest of gunpowder; but he was so quick in picking\r\nit out that the powder did not catch fire.\r\n\r\nOn our way we saw four prahus. We took one laden with cocoanuts on its\r\nway to Burné; but the crew escaped to a small island, and the other\r\nthree prahus escaped behind some other small islands.\r\n\r\nBetween the northern cape of Burné and the island named Cimbonbon,\r\nsituated in 8° 7′ N. latitude there is a very convenient port for\r\nrefitting ships, and we entered it; but as we were wanting many things\r\nnecessary for our work, we had to spend there forty-two days. Each one\r\nworked at one thing or another according to the best of his knowledge\r\nor ability; but our greatest labour was going to get wood in the\r\nthickets, as the ground was covered with briars and thorny shrubs, and\r\nwe had no shoes.\r\n\r\nIn this island there are some very large wild boars. Whilst we were in\r\na boat we killed one which was crossing from one island to another.\r\nIts head was two and a half spans long, and its tusks were exceedingly\r\nlong.[351] Here also are crocodiles; those of the land are larger than\r\nthose of the sea-coast. There are oysters and very large turtles; of\r\nthese we caught two. The flesh alone of one of them weighed twenty\r\npounds, and of the other forty-four pounds. We caught a kind of fish\r\nwith a head like that of a pig, and which had two horns; its body was\r\nall covered with bone, and on its back it had a kind of saddle: this\r\nwas a small one. In this island are also found certain trees, the\r\nleaves of which, when they fall, are animated, and walk. They are like\r\nthe leaves of the mulberry tree, but not so long; they have the leaf\r\nstalk[352] short and pointed, and near the leaf stalk they have on each\r\nside two feet. If they are touched they escape, but if crushed they\r\ndo not give out blood.[353] I kept one for nine days in a box. When I\r\nopened it the leaf went round the box. I believe they live upon air.\r\nThe island in which we were is called Pulaoan.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this island—that is to say, the port which is at the\r\nextremity of it—we met a junk which was coming from Borneo. We made\r\nsignals to it to strike its sails; but as it would not obey we overtook\r\nit, captured and pillaged it. It had on board the Governor of Pulaoan,\r\nwith a son and a brother of his. We made them all prisoners, and put\r\nthem to ransom to give within seven days four hundred measures of\r\nrice, twenty pigs, as many goats, and four hundred and fifty fowls.\r\nThey caused all this to be given us, and besides added spontaneously\r\ncocoanuts, figs, sugar-canes, and vessels full of palm wine. We, in\r\nconsequence of his generosity, restored to him some of his daggers and\r\narquebuses; we also gave him a flag, a garment of yellow damask, and\r\nfifteen ells of linen. We gave to his son a cloak of blue cloth, and to\r\nhis brother a garment of green cloth, and to the others other things,\r\nand we parted good friends.\r\n\r\nWe turned backwards, passing between the island of Cagayan and the port\r\nof Cipit,[354] taking a course east and a quarter south-east, to seek\r\nthe islands of Maluco. We passed between certain little mountains,[355]\r\naround which we found many weeds, although there was there a great\r\ndepth. Passing between these islets it seemed that we were in another\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHaving left Cipit to the east, we saw to the west two islands called\r\nZolo[356] and Taghima,[357] near which islands pearls are found. The\r\ntwo pearls of the King of Burné, of which I have spoken, were found\r\nthere, and this is the manner in which he obtained them, according\r\nto the account which was given me of it. The King of Burné married a\r\ndaughter of the King of Zolo, who told him that her father had these\r\ntwo big pearls. He desired to have them, and decided on getting them by\r\nany means, and one night he set out with five hundred prahus full of\r\narmed men, and went to Zolo, and took the king with his two sons, and\r\nbrought them to Burné, and did not restore them to liberty until they\r\ngave him the two pearls.\r\n\r\nContinuing our course east and a quarter north-east we passed near two\r\ninhabited places called Cavit and Subanin, and passed near an island\r\ncalled Monoripa, ten leagues distant from the before-mentioned islets.\r\nThe inhabitants of this island always live in their vessels, and have\r\nno houses on shore. In these two districts of Cavit and Subanin, which\r\nare situated in the same island[358] as that in which are Butuan and\r\nCalagan, the best cinnamon of any grows. If we could have remained\r\nhere only two days, we could have laden the ships with it; but we did\r\nnot wish to lose time, but to profit by the favourable wind, for we\r\nhad to double a cape and some islets which were around it. Wherefore,\r\nremaining under sail, we made a little barter, and obtained seventeen\r\npounds of cinnamon for two big knives, which we had taken from the\r\nGovernor of Pulaoan.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the cinnamon tree, I can give some description of it. It\r\nis a small tree, not more than three or four cubits high, and of the\r\nthickness of a man’s finger, and it has not got more than three or four\r\nlittle branches. Its leaf is like that of the laurel. The cinnamon for\r\nuse which comes to us, is its bark, which is gathered twice in the\r\nyear. Its wood and leaves when they are green have the taste and force\r\nof the bark itself. Here it is called Cain-mana, since _cain_ means\r\nwood and _mana_ sweet.[359]\r\n\r\nHaving set the head of the ship to north-east, we made for a large\r\ncity called Maingdanao, situated in the same island in which are Butuan\r\nand Calagan, in order to get precise information of the position of\r\nMaluco. Following this course we took possession of a _bignaday_, a\r\nvessel similar to a prahu, and being obliged to have recourse to force\r\nand violence, we killed seven out of eighteen men who formed the crew.\r\nThese men were better made and more robust than all those we had seen\r\nhitherto, and they were all chief men of Mindanao. There was among them\r\na brother of the king who said that he well knew where Maluco was.\r\nAfterwards, following his indications, we left the north-east course\r\nwhich we held, and took a south-east course. We were then in 6° 7´ N.\r\nlatitude and thirty leagues distant from Cavit.\r\n\r\nWe were told that at a cape of this island near to a river there are\r\nmen who are rather hairy, great warriors, and good archers, armed\r\nwith swords a span broad. When they make an enemy prisoner they eat\r\nhis heart only, and they eat it raw with the juice of oranges or\r\nlemons.[360] This cape is called Benaian.[361]\r\n\r\nMaking for the south-east we found four islands, named Ciboco, Birabam\r\nBatolac, Sarangani, and Candigar. Saturday, the 26th of October, about\r\nnightfall, whilst coasting the island of Birabam Batolac, we met with\r\na very great storm, before which we lowered all our sails, and betook\r\nourselves to prayer. Then our three saints appeared upon the masts and\r\ndispersed the darkness. St. Elmo stood for more than two hours at the\r\nmainmast head like a flame. St. Nicholas at the head of the foremast,\r\nand St. Clara on the mizenmast. In gratitude for their assistance we\r\npromised a slave to each of the saints, and we gave to each an offering.\r\n\r\nContinuing our voyage we entered a port between the two islands\r\nSarangani and Candigar, and cast anchor to the east, near a village of\r\nSarangani, where pearls and gold are found. This port is in 5° 9´ N.\r\nlatitude, and fifty leagues from Cavit. The inhabitants are Gentiles\r\nand go naked like the others.\r\n\r\nHaving remained here a day we compelled by force two pilots to\r\ncome with us to show us the way to Maluco. We were directed to take\r\na south-south-west course, and passed between eight islands partly\r\ninhabited, partly uninhabited, which formed a kind of street. These\r\nwere named Cheava, Caviao, Cabiao Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan,\r\nand Nuza. At the end of these we reached an island which was very\r\nbeautiful, named Sanghir.[362] But having a contrary wind, which did\r\nnot allow us to double the cape, we tacked about backwards and forwards\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, profiting by the darkness of the night, one of the\r\npilots whom we had caught at Sarangani, and with him the brother of the\r\nking of Mindanao with his little son, escaped by swimming and reached\r\nthat island; but we learned later that the son not being able to hold\r\non well to his father’s shoulders, was drowned.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it was impossible to double the head of this island we\r\npassed below it, where we saw many small islands. This large island\r\nhas four kings whose names are Raja Matandatu, Raja Laga, Raja Bapti,\r\nand Raja Parabu. These are Gentiles. It is in 3° 30´ N. latitude and\r\ntwenty-seven leagues from Sarangani.\r\n\r\nContinuing our course in the same direction we passed near five\r\nislands named Cheoma, Carachita, Para, Zangalura, and Cian.[363] This\r\nlast is ten leagues distant from Sanghir. In this island there is a\r\nrather high mountain, but not one of great extent. Its king is named\r\nRaja Ponto. We came next to the island Paghinzara,[364] which has three\r\nhigh mountains, and in it the king is Raja Babintan. We saw at twelve\r\nleagues to the east of Paghinzara another island, Talant, and also two\r\nislands, not large but inhabited, called Zoar and Mean.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 6th of November, having passed beyond these two islands,\r\nwe discovered four other rather high islands at a distance of fourteen\r\nleagues towards the east. The pilot who had remained with us told us\r\nthose were the Maluco islands, for which we gave thanks to God, and to\r\ncomfort ourselves we discharged all our artillery. It need not cause\r\nwonder that we were so much rejoiced, since we had passed twenty-seven\r\nmonths less two days always in search of Maluco, wandering for that\r\nobject among the immense number of islands. But I must say that near\r\nall these islands the least depth that we found was one hundred\r\nfathoms, for which reason attention is not to be given to all that the\r\nPortuguese have spread, according to whom the islands of Maluco are\r\nsituated in seas which cannot be navigated on account of the shoals,\r\nand the dark and foggy atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFriday, the 8th November of 1521, three hours before sunset, we\r\nentered a port of the island called Tadore,[365] and having gone near\r\nthe shore, we cast anchor in twenty fathoms, and discharged all our\r\nartillery. Next day the king came to the ships in a prahu, and went\r\nround them. We went to meet him with a boat to show him honour, and\r\nhe made us enter his prahu, and sit near him. He was sitting under a\r\nsilk umbrella, which sheltered him. In front of him was his son with\r\nthe royal sceptre, there were also two men with gold vases to give him\r\nwater for his hands, and two others with gilt caskets full of betel.\r\n\r\nThe king gave us a welcome, and said that a long time back he had\r\ndreamed that some ships were coming to Maluco from distant countries,\r\nand that to assure himself with respect to this, he had examined the\r\nmoon, and he had seen that they were really coming, and that indeed\r\nthey were our ships. After that he came on board our ships, and we all\r\nkissed his hand: we then conducted him to the poop, but he, in order to\r\navoid stooping, would not enter the cabin except by the upper opening.\r\nWe made him sit down on a chair of red velvet, and placed on him a\r\nTurkish robe of yellow velvet. In order to do him more honour we sat\r\ndown before him on the ground. When he had heard who we were, and what\r\nwas the object of our voyage, he said that he and all his people were\r\nwell content to be the most faithful friends and vassals of the King\r\nof Spain; that he received us in this island as his own sons; that we\r\nmight go on shore and remain there as in our own houses; and that his\r\nisland for the future should not be named Tadore, but Castile, in proof\r\nof the great love he bore to the king our master. Then we presented to\r\nhim the chair on which he sat, and the robe which we had put on him, a\r\npiece of fine linen, four ells of scarlet cloth, a robe of brocade, a\r\ncloth of yellow damask, a piece of the whitest Cambay linen, two caps,\r\nsix strings of glass beads, twelve knives, three large mirrors, six\r\nscissors, six combs, some gilt goblets, and other things. We gave to\r\nhis son an Indian cloth of gold and silk, a large mirror, a cap and two\r\nknives. To each of the nine chief men of his suite we made a present of\r\na piece of silk, a cap and two knives; and to many others of his suite\r\nwe made a present, to one of a cap, to another of a knife, until the\r\nking told us not to give any more presents. He then said that he had\r\ngot nothing worthy to be sent as a present to our king, unless he sent\r\nhimself, now that he considered him as his lord. He invited us to come\r\ncloser to the city, and if any one attempted to come on board the ships\r\nat night, he told us to fire upon him with our guns. He came out of the\r\nstern cabin by the same way by which he had entered it, without ever\r\nbending his head. At his departure we fired all the cannon.\r\n\r\nThis king is a Moor, of about forty-five years of age, rather well\r\nmade, and of a handsome presence. He is a very great astrologer. His\r\ndress consisted of a shirt of very fine white stuff, with the ends of\r\nthe sleeves embroidered with gold, and a wrapper which came down from\r\nhis waist almost to the ground. He was barefooted; round his head he\r\nhad a silk veil, and over that a garland of flowers. He is named Raja\r\nSultan Manzor.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November—a Sunday—we had another conversation with\r\nthe king, who wished to know how long a time we had been absent from\r\nSpain, and what pay and what rations the king gave to each of us; and\r\nwe told him all this. He asked us for a signature of the king and a\r\nroyal standard, since he desired that both his island of Tadore, and\r\nalso that of Tarenate (where he intended to have his nephew named\r\nCalanogapi, crowned king) should become subject to the King of Spain,\r\nfor whose honour he would fight to the death; and if it should happen\r\nthat he should be compelled to give way, he would take refuge in Spain\r\nwith all his family, in a new junk which he was having constructed, and\r\nwould take with him the royal signature, and standard.\r\n\r\nHe begged us to leave with him some of our men, who would always keep\r\nalive his recollection of us and of our king, as he would more esteem\r\nhaving some of us with him than our merchandise, which would not last\r\nhim a long time. Seeing our eagerness to take cloves on board, he said\r\nthat for that purpose he would go to an island called Bachian, where he\r\nhoped to find as much of them as were wanted, since in his island there\r\nwas not a quantity sufficient of dry cloves to load the two ships. On\r\nthat day there was no traffic because it was Sunday. The holiday of\r\nthese people is on Friday.\r\n\r\nIt may please your illustrious lordship to have some description of\r\nthe islands where the cloves grow. They are five—Tarenate, Tador,\r\nMutir, Machian, and Bachian. Tarenate is the principal island. Its\r\nking, whilst he lived, had almost entire dominion over the other\r\nfour. Tadore, the island in which we were, has its own king. Mutir\r\nand Machian have no king, but are governed by the people; and when\r\nthe kings of Tarenate and Tidore are at war, they furnish them with\r\ncombatants. The last is Bachian, and it has a king. All this province\r\nin which the cloves grow is called Maluco.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived here, eight months had not elapsed since a certain\r\nPortuguese, Francisco Serrano, had died in Tarenate. He was\r\ncaptain-general of the King of Tarenate when he was making war on\r\nthe King of Tadore; and he acted so strenuously that this king was\r\ncompelled to give his daughter in marriage to the King of Tarenate,\r\nwho also received as hostages almost all the sons of the chief men of\r\nTadore. Peace was then made, and from that daughter was born the nephew\r\nCalanopagi, of whom I have spoken. But the King of Tadore never forgave\r\nSerrano in his heart; and he having come several years later to Tadore\r\nto traffic in cloves, the king had him poisoned with some betel leaves,\r\nso that he survived hardly four days. The King of Tarenate wished to\r\nhave him buried according to their own usage, but three Christian\r\nservants that Serrano had with him did not consent to it. In dying he\r\nleft a little son and a little girl that he had of a lady he had taken\r\nin Java major, and two hundred bahars of cloves.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Serrano was a great friend and a relation of our unfortunate\r\ncaptain-general, and he it was who induced him to undertake that\r\nvoyage, for when Magellan was at Malacca, he had several times\r\nlearned by letters from Serrano that he was here. Therefore, when D.\r\nManuel, King of Portugal, refused to increase his pension by a single\r\ntestoon[366] per month, an increase which he thought he had well\r\ndeserved, he came to Spain and made the proposal to his Sacred Majesty\r\nto come here by way of the west, and he obtained all that he asked for.\r\n\r\nTen days after the death of Serrano, the King of Tarenate, named\r\nRaja Abuleis,[367] drove out from his kingdom his son-in-law the\r\nKing of Bachian, whose wife, the daughter of the King of Tarenate,\r\ncame to Tarenate under the pretext of concluding peace, and gave\r\nhim (her father) such a poison that he only survived two days,\r\nand dying left nine sons, whose names were told to me as follows:\r\nChechili[368]-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi, Chechilideroix, Cilimanzur,\r\nCilipagi, Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu, Serich, and Calanopagi.\r\n\r\nMonday, the 11th of November, Chechilideroix, one of the\r\nabove-mentioned sons of the King of Tarenate, came with two prahus to\r\nthe ships sounding drums: he was dressed in red velvet. We learned that\r\nhe had near him the widow and sons of Francisco Serrano. When we knew\r\nhim, being aware that he was an enemy of the King of Tadore, we sent to\r\nask him whether we might receive him in the ships, which, as we were in\r\nhis port, we would not do without his consent. The king sent us word\r\nto do whatever we pleased. But meantime Chechilideroix, seeing our\r\nhesitation, had some suspicion, and moved further off from the ships.\r\nWe then went to him in a boat, and made him a present of an Indian\r\ncloth of gold and silk, with some looking-glasses, knives, scissors,\r\netc.: these things he accepted but disdainfully, and soon after\r\ndeparted. He had with him an Indian who had become a Christian, named\r\nManuel, the servant of a certain Pedro Alfonzo de Lorosa, a Portuguese,\r\nwho, after the death of Serrano, had come from Bandan to Tarenate.\r\nManuel being able to speak Portuguese, came on board the ships, and\r\ntold us that although the sons of the King of Tarenate were enemies\r\nto the King of Tadore, yet they were disposed towards the service of\r\nSpain. Then, by means of him, we wrote to De Lorosa to come to our\r\nships without any suspicion or fear.\r\n\r\nThese kings have as many ladies as they please, but one only is the\r\nprincipal wife, and all the others are subject to her. The King of\r\nTadore had a large house outside the city, where there were two hundred\r\nof the ladies he was most fond of, and as many more to serve them. The\r\nking eats alone, or with his principal wife, on a kind of raised dais,\r\nfrom which he can see all the others sitting round, and he decides upon\r\nthe one who most pleases him to come to him. When the king’s dinner is\r\nfinished, the ladies all eat together if he permits it, or else each\r\none goes to eat in her own room. No one without special permission from\r\nthe king can see those ladies, and if anybody by day or by night were\r\nfound near their house he would be killed immediately. Each family is\r\nbound to give one or two daughters to the king. Rajah Sultan Manzour\r\nhad twenty-six children, of whom eight were boys and eighteen girls. In\r\nthe island of Tadore there is a kind of bishop, and the one that was\r\nthere in our time had forty ladies and very many children.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 12th of November, the king had a house built in the\r\ncity for our merchandise, and it was built in one day. Thither we\r\ncarried all that we had to barter, and placed it in the custody of\r\nthree of our men, and the trade began at once. It was carried out in\r\nthis manner. For ten ells of red cloth of pretty good quality they\r\ngave a bahar of cloves. A bahar is four quintals[369] and six pounds.\r\nFor fifteen ells of middling quality a bahar, for fifteen hatchets a\r\nbahar, for thirty-five glass cups a bahar; and the king in this manner\r\nhad from us almost all our goblets: for seventeen cathils of cinnabar a\r\nbahar; the same for as much quicksilver. For twenty-six ells of common\r\nlinen a bahar, and the same for twenty-five ells of finer linen; for\r\na hundred and fifty knives a bahar; for fifty scissors a bahar; for\r\nforty caps a bahar; for ten Guzerat cloths a bahar; for three of their\r\ncymbals two bahars: for a quintal of bronze a bahar. Almost all our\r\nmirrors were broken, and the few that remained entire the king wished\r\nto have. Many of the above-mentioned goods had been obtained by us by\r\nthe capture of the junks, which I have related; and the haste we were\r\nin to return to Spain caused us to sell our goods at a lower price than\r\nwe should have done had we not been in a hurry.\r\n\r\nEvery day there came to the ships many boats laden with goats, fowls,\r\nplantains, cocoanuts, and other victuals, that it was a wonder to see.\r\nWe supplied the ships with good water taken from a spring whence it\r\nissued hot, but if it remains only one hour in the open air it becomes\r\nvery cold. They say that it comes out like that because it issues from\r\nthe mountain of the cloves. It may be seen from this how those lied\r\nwho said that fresh water had to be brought to Maluco from distant\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe next day the king sent his son named Mossahap to the island of the\r\nMutir for cloves with which to freight our ships. We had spoken to the\r\nking that day of some Indians whom we had captured, and he entreated us\r\nto make a present of them to him, as he had the intention of sending\r\nthem back to their native country, accompanied by five men of Tadore,\r\nwho, on restoring them to their country, would praise and commend the\r\nKing of Spain and make a good name for the Spaniards. We gave him the\r\nthree ladies whom we had destined for the queen, as has been said\r\nabove, and all the men except those of Burné: he very much appreciated\r\nthis gift.\r\n\r\nThe king then asked another favour—that was, that we should kill all\r\nthe pigs we had on board, for which he would give an ample compensation\r\nin fowls and goats. We gave him satisfaction in this, cutting their\r\nthroats and hanging them up under the deck, so that the Moors should\r\nnot have occasion to see them, since if by accident they see any pig\r\nthey covered their faces not to see it or perceive its smell.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day Pedro Alfonso,[370] the Portuguese,\r\ncame in a prahu, but before he came on board the ships the king sent\r\nto call him, and said to him, that although he belonged to Tarenate he\r\nshould take good care not to answer falsely to the questions we were\r\ngoing to ask him. He indeed, after coming on board, told us that he\r\nhad come to India sixteen years ago, and of these years he had passed\r\nten in Maluco; and it was just ten years since those islands had been\r\ndiscovered by the Portuguese, who kept the discovery secret from us. He\r\nthen related to us that a year, less fifteen days, had elapsed since\r\na large ship had come hither proceeding from Malacca, and had gone\r\naway laden with cloves; but that, on account of the bad weather, she\r\nhad been obliged to remain some months at Bandam. He added that her\r\ncaptain was Tristan de Meneses, a Portuguese, from whom, on asking what\r\nnews there was in Europe, he had heard that a squadron of five ships\r\nhad sailed from Seville to discover Maluco in the name of the King of\r\nSpain, and that the captain of this squadron was Ferdinand Magellan,\r\na Portuguese, for which reason the King of Portugal, being angry that\r\na subject of his should attempt to do a thing so opposed to him, had\r\nsent some ships to the cape of Good Hope, and others to the Cape Sta.\r\nMaria,[371] where the cannibals are, to impede their passage, but they\r\nhad not fallen in with them. Having learned later that Magellan had\r\npassed by another sea, and was making for Maluco by way of the west,\r\nhe had written to his Captain-Major of the Indies, named Diogo Lopez\r\nde Sequeira, to send six ships to Maluco against the Spanish squadron.\r\nBut the captain-major, having at that time received information that\r\nthe Grand Turk was planning an expedition against Malacca, was obliged\r\nto send against him sixty sail to the Straits of Mekkah, in the country\r\nof Jiddah, where, however, they only found a few galleys which had\r\ngrounded near the beautiful and strong city of Aden, and they set fire\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThis enterprise, added De Lorosa, had prevented the captain-major\r\nfrom immediately sending an expedition against Magellan; but a little\r\nlater he had sent to Maluco a great galloon with two rows of cannon,\r\ncommanded by Francisco Faria, a Portuguese: but neither did this one\r\ncome, for on account of the shoals and currents which are near Malacca,\r\nand the contrary winds, it was unable to pass that promontory, and was\r\ncompelled to turn back.\r\n\r\nHe also related that a few days before a caravel with two junks had\r\ncome to these parts to get news of us. The junks had sailed to Bachian\r\nto load cloves, with seven Portuguese on board. These men, who did\r\nnot respect the wives of the inhabitants, nor even those of the king,\r\nnotwithstanding the warning they had received from the king himself,\r\nwere all killed. The men of the caravel, on hearing of this, returned\r\nin haste to Malacca, abandoning the junks with four hundred bahars of\r\ncloves and as much merchandise as would have purchased another hundred\r\nbahars. He also related that every year many junks go from Malacca to\r\nBandan to buy mace and nutmeg, and go thence to Maluco to purchase\r\ncloves. They make the voyage from Bandan to Maluco in three days, and\r\nemploy fifteen in the voyage from Bandan to Malacca. He said, lastly,\r\nthat since ten years back the King of Portugal had derived great profit\r\nfrom these islands, and he took especial care to keep these countries\r\nconcealed from and unknown to the Spaniards. He related many other\r\nsimilar things, passing several hours in conversation with us: and we\r\nsaid and did so much, offering him a large salary, that we made him\r\ndetermine on coming with us to Spain.\r\n\r\nFriday, the 15th of November, the king told us that he thought of\r\ngoing himself to Bachian to get the cloves which the Portuguese had\r\nleft there, and asked us for presents to give to the two governors of\r\nMutir in the name of the King of Spain. Meanwhile, having come close to\r\nour ships, he wished to see how we shot with the cross-bow, with guns,\r\nand with a swivel gun, which is a weapon larger than an arquebuse. He\r\nhimself fired three times with a cross-bow, but he did not care to fire\r\nwith a gun.\r\n\r\nOpposite Tadore there is another very large island, called\r\nGiailolo[372], and it is so large that a prahu can with difficulty go\r\nround it in four months. It is inhabited by Moors and Gentiles. The\r\nMoors have two kings, one of whom, according to what the King of Tadore\r\nrelated to us, has had six hundred children, and the other has had\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five. The Gentiles have not got so many women\r\nas the Moors, and are less superstitious. The first thing they meet\r\nin the morning when they go out of their houses is the object which\r\nthey worship throughout that day. The king of these Gentiles is named\r\nRajah Papua. He is very rich in gold, and inhabits the interior of the\r\nisland. There grow here among the rocks bamboos as thick as a man’s\r\nleg, full of water, which is very good to drink. We purchased many of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the Moorish King of Giailolo came to the ships with many\r\nprahus, and we made him a present of a green damask robe, two ells of\r\nred cloth, some looking-glasses, scissors, knives, combs, and two gilt\r\ngoblets, which things pleased him very much, and he said to us that, as\r\nwe were friends of the King of Tadore, we were also his friends, since\r\nhe loved that king like one of his own sons. He invited us to come to\r\nhis country, promising to do us great honour. This king is powerful,\r\nand held in sufficient respect throughout all these islands. He is very\r\nold, and his name is Raja Jussu.\r\n\r\nSunday morning this same king came on board the ships and wished to\r\nsee how we fought, and how we discharged the bombards, at which he was\r\ngreatly pleased, for in his youth he had been a great warrior.\r\n\r\nThe same day I went on shore to see how the cloves grow, and this is\r\nwhat I observed. The tree from which they are gathered is high, and its\r\ntrunk is as thick as a man’s body, more or less, according to the age\r\nof the plant. Its branches spread out somewhat in the middle of the\r\ntree, but near the top they form a pyramid. The bark is of an olive\r\ncolour, and the leaves very like those of the laurel. The cloves grow\r\nat the end of little branches in bunches of ten or twenty. These trees\r\nalways bear more fruit on one side than on the other, according to the\r\nseasons. The cloves are white when they first sprout, they get red as\r\nthey ripen, and blacken when dry. They are gathered twice in the year,\r\nonce about Christmas and the other time about St. John’s day, when the\r\nair in these countries is milder, and it is still more so in December.\r\nWhen the year is rather hot, and there is little rain, they gather in\r\neach of these islands from three to four hundred bahars of cloves.\r\nThe clove tree does not live except in the mountains, and if it is\r\ntransferred to the plain it dies there.[373] The leaf, the bark, and\r\nthe wood, as long as they are green, have the strength and fragrance of\r\nthe fruit itself. If these are not gathered when just ripe they get so\r\nlarge and hard that nothing of them remains good except the rind. It is\r\nsaid that the mist renders them perfect, and indeed we saw almost every\r\nday a mist descend and surround one or other of the above-mentioned\r\nmountains. Among these people everyone possesses some of these trees,\r\nand each man watches over his own trees and gathers their fruit, but\r\ndoes not do any work round them to cultivate them. This tree does not\r\ngrow except in the five mountains of the five Maluco islands. There\r\nare, however, a few trees in Giailolo and in a small island between\r\nTadore and Mutir named Mare, but they are not good.\r\n\r\nThere are in this island of Giailolo some trees of nutmegs. These are\r\nlike our walnuts, and the leaves also are similar. The nutmeg, when\r\ngathered, is like the quince in form and colour, and the down which\r\ncovers it, but it is smaller. The outside rind is as thick as the green\r\nrind of our walnuts, beneath which is a thin web, or rather cartilage,\r\nunder which is the mace, of a very bright red, which covers and\r\nsurrounds the rind of the nuts, inside which is the nutmeg properly so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThere also grows in Tadore the ginger, which we used to eat green;\r\ninstead of bread. Ginger is not a tree, but a shrub, which sends out\r\nof the earth shoots a span long like the shoots of canes, which they\r\nalso resemble in the shape of the leaves, only those of the ginger are\r\nnarrower. The shoots are good for nothing; that which makes ginger is\r\nthe root. When green, it is not so strong as when it is dry, and to dry\r\nit they use lime, or else it would not keep.\r\n\r\nThe houses of these people are built like those already described,\r\nbut are not so high above the ground, and are surrounded with canes\r\nafter the fashion of a hedge. The women here are ugly, and go naked\r\nlike the others, having only their middles covered with cloth made of\r\nbark. The men also are naked, and notwithstanding that their women are\r\nugly, they are exceedingly jealous; and amongst other things which\r\ndispleased them, was that we came ashore without cloaks,[374] because\r\nthey imagined that might cause temptation to their wives. Both men and\r\nwomen always go barefoot.\r\n\r\nSince I have spoken of cloth, I will relate how they make it. They\r\ntake a piece of bark and leave it in water until it has grown soft;\r\nthey then beat it with wooden clubs to extend it in length and breadth,\r\nas much as they please; thus it becomes like a veil of raw silk with\r\nfilaments enlaced within it, so that it appears as if it was woven.\r\n\r\nTheir bread is made with the wood of a tree like a palm tree, and\r\nthey make it in this way. They take a piece of this wood, and extract\r\nfrom it certain long black thorns[375] which are situated there; then\r\nthey pound it, and make bread of it which they call sagu. They make\r\nprovisions of this bread for their sea voyages.\r\n\r\nEvery day there came from Tarenate many boats laden with cloves, but\r\nwe, because we were waiting for the king, would not traffic for those\r\ngoods, but only for victuals: and the men of Tarenate complained much\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday night, the 24th of November, the king arrived, and on\r\nentering the port had his drums sounded, and passed between our ships.\r\nWe fired many bombards to do him honour. He told us that for four days\r\nwe should be continually supplied with cloves.\r\n\r\nIn effect, on Monday he sent seven hundred and ninety one catils,\r\nwithout taking tare. To take tare means to take spice for less than\r\nwhat it weighs, and the reason of this is because when they are fresh,\r\nevery day they diminish in weight. As these were the first cloves which\r\nwe took on board, and the principal object of our voyage, we fired\r\nour bombards for joy. Cloves are called _Gomode_ in this place; in\r\nSarangani where we took the two pilots they are called _Bonglavan_, and\r\nin Malacca _Chianche_.[376]\r\n\r\nTuesday the 26th November the King came to tell us that for us he had\r\ndone what a King never does here, that was to leave his own island; but\r\nhe had gone to show the affection he had for the King of Castile, and\r\nbecause when we had got our cargo, we could sooner return to Spain,\r\nand afterwards return with greater forces to avenge the death of his\r\nfather, who had been killed in an island called Buru, and his body had\r\nbeen thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards added that it was the custom in Tadore, when the first\r\ncloves were embarked in a vessel, or in junks, that the king gave a\r\nfeast to their crews and merchants, and they made prayers to God to\r\nbring them in safety to their port. He wished to do the same for us,\r\nand at the same time the feast would serve for the King of Bachian,\r\nwho was coming with a brother of his to pay him a visit, and on that\r\naccount he had the streets cleaned. Hearing this, some of us began\r\nto suspect some treachery; all the more because we learned that, not\r\nlong before, three Portuguese of the companions of Francisco Serrano\r\nhad been assassinated at the place where we got water, by some of the\r\nislanders concealed in the thickets; also we often saw them whispering\r\nwith the Indians whom we had made prisoners. Therefore, although some\r\nof us were inclined to accept the invitation, we concluded not to\r\nbetake ourselves thither, recollecting the unfortunate feast given to\r\nour men in the island of Zubu, and we decided on a speedy departure.\r\n\r\nMeantime a message was sent to the king to thank him, and to ask\r\nhim to come soon to the ships, where we would deliver to him the\r\nfour men we had promised him, with the goods which we had destined\r\nfor him. The King came soon, and on entering the ship, as though he\r\nhad observed that we had doubts, said that he entered with as much\r\nconfidence and security as into his own house. He made us feel how\r\nmuch he was displeased by our unexpected haste to depart, since ships\r\nused to employ thirty days in taking in their cargo; and that if he\r\nhad made a journey out of the island, he certainly had not done it to\r\ninjure us but to assist us, so that we might more speedily obtain the\r\ncloves which we required, and a part of which we were still expecting.\r\nHe added that it was not then a fit season for navigating in those\r\nseas, on account of the many shoals near Bandan, and besides it would\r\nbe a likely thing that we should fall in with some Portuguese ships.\r\nWhen, in spite of what he had said, he saw we were still determined on\r\ngoing away, he said that we must take back all that we had given him,\r\nsince the Kings, his neighbours, would consider him as a man without\r\nreputation for receiving so many presents in the name of so great a\r\nking as the King of Spain, and he had given nothing in return, and\r\nperhaps they would suspect that the Spaniards had gone away in such\r\nhaste for fear of some treachery, so that they would fix upon him the\r\nname of traitor. Then, in order that no suspicion might remain in\r\nour minds of his honesty and good faith, he ordered his Koran to be\r\nbrought, and kissing it devoutly he placed it four or five times on\r\nhis head whilst whispering certain words to himself, with a rite which\r\nthey call Zambehan,[377] and he said in the presence of us all, that\r\nhe swore by Allah and by the Koran, which he held in his hand, that\r\nhe would ever be faithful and a friend to the King of Spain. He said\r\nall this almost weeping and with so great an appearance of sincerity\r\nand cordiality, that we promised to prolong our sojourn at Tadore for\r\nanother fortnight. We then gave him the Royal signature and standard.\r\nWe learned later, by a sure and certain channel, that some of the\r\nchiefs of those islands had indeed counselled him to kill all of us,\r\nby which thing he would have acquired for himself great merit with the\r\nPortuguese, who would have given him good assistance to avenge himself\r\non the King of Bachian, but he, loyal and constant to the King of\r\nSpain, with whom he had sworn a peace, had answered that he would never\r\ndo such an act on any account whatever.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 27th November, the king issued a proclamation that\r\nwhoever had cloves might freely sell them to us. For which reason all\r\nthat and the following day, we bought cloves like mad.[378]\r\n\r\nFriday, in the afternoon, the governor of Machian came with many\r\nprahus, but he would not come on shore, because his father and his\r\nbrother, who had been banished from Machian, had taken refuge here.\r\n\r\nThe following day the King of Tadore, with his nephew, the governor,\r\nnamed Humai, a man of twenty-five years of age, came on board the\r\nships, and the king, on hearing that we had no more cloth, sent to\r\nfetch from his house six ells of red cloth, and gave them to us in\r\norder that we might, by adding other objects, make a fitting present to\r\nthe governor. We made him the present, and he thanked us much, and said\r\nthat soon he would send us plenty of cloves. At his departure from the\r\nship we fired several bombards.\r\n\r\nSunday the 1st day of December, the above-mentioned governor departed\r\nfrom Tadore; and we were told that the king had made him a present of\r\nsome silk cloths and drums, for him to send us the cloves sooner. On\r\nMonday, the king himself went again out of the island for the same\r\nobject. Wednesday morning, as it was the day of St. Barbara,[379] and\r\non account of the King’s arrival all the artillery was discharged. The\r\nking came to the beach to see how we fired rockets and fire balls, and\r\ntook great pleasure in them.\r\n\r\nThursday and Friday we purchased a good many cloves both in the city\r\nand at the ships at a much lower price, as the time of our departure\r\ngrew nearer. For four ells of riband[380] they gave a bahar of cloves,\r\nfor two little chains of brass which were worth a marcello,[381] they\r\ngave us a hundred pounds; and at last each man being desirous of having\r\nhis portion of the cargo, and as there were no more goods to give in\r\nexchange for cloves, one gave his cloak, another his coat, and another\r\na shirt or other clothes to obtain them.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday three sons of the King of Tarenate, with their wives, who\r\nwere daughters of our King of Tadore, and afterwards Pedro Alfonso,\r\nthe Portuguese, came to the ships. We gave a gilt glass goblet to each\r\nof the brothers, and to the three wives scissors and other things;\r\nand when they went away we fired several bombards in their honour. We\r\nafterwards sent on shore a present of several things to the widow of\r\nthe King of Tarenate, daughter of the King Tadore, who had not ventured\r\nto come on board the ships.\r\n\r\nSunday the 8th December, we fired many bombards, rockets, and fireballs\r\nto celebrate the Conception of our Lady. Monday in the afternoon, the\r\nKing came to the ships with three women who carried his betel. It is to\r\nbe observed that no one can take women about with him except the king.\r\nAfterwards the King of Giailolo came to see again our gun exercise.\r\n\r\nSome days later, as the day of our departure grew near, the king\r\nshowed us a sincere affection, and among other obliging things, said to\r\nus that it seemed to him that he was a sucking child whom its mother\r\nwas about to leave, and that he remained disconsolate all the more\r\nnow that he had become acquainted with us and liked several things of\r\nSpain, for which reason he entreated us not to delay our return thence\r\nto Tadore. Meantime, he begged us to leave him some of our swivel\r\nguns[382] for his own defence. He warned us at the same time not to\r\nnavigate except by daylight, on account of the shoals and reefs which\r\nexist in these seas; but we answered him that because of our need to\r\narrive in Spain as soon as possible, we were obliged to navigate night\r\nand day: he then added that, being unable to do anything else, he would\r\npray God every day to bring us home in safety.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Pedro Alfonso de Lorosa had come to the ships with his\r\nwife and property to return with us. Two days after, Kechilideroix,\r\nson of the King of Tarenate, came with a prahu well filled with men,\r\nand approaching the ships requested Lorosa to come into his prahu;\r\nbut Lorosa, who suspected him, refused to do so, and told him he had\r\ndetermined on going away with those ships to Spain. For the same\r\nsuspicion he advised us not to receive him in the ships; and we did\r\nnot choose that he should come on board when he asked to do so. It was\r\nknown later that Kechili was a great friend of the Portuguese captain\r\nof Malacca, and had the intention of seizing Lorosa and of conducting\r\nhim thither; and on that account he severely reprimanded those persons\r\nwith whom this Portuguese lived, for having let him depart without his\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nThe king had informed us that the King of Bachian would soon arrive,\r\nwith a brother of his who was going to marry one of his daughters, and\r\nhad asked us to do him honour by firing bombards on his arrival. He\r\narrived on Sunday the 15th of December, in the afternoon, and we did\r\nhim honour as the king had desired; we did not, however, discharge the\r\nheavier cannon, as we were heavily laden. The king and his brother\r\ncame in a prahu with three banks of rowers on each side, a hundred\r\nand twenty in number. The prahu was adorned with many streamers made\r\nof white, yellow and red parrot’s feathers. They were sounding many\r\ncymbals, and that sound served to give the measure to the rowers\r\nto keep time. In two other prahus were the damsels who were to be\r\npresented to the bride. They returned us the salute by going round the\r\nships and round the port.\r\n\r\nAs it is the custom that no king disembarks on the land of another\r\nking, the King of Tadore came to visit him of Bachian in his own prahu:\r\nthis one, seeing the other coming, rose from the carpet on which he was\r\nsitting, and placed himself on one side to make way for the king of the\r\ncountry: but he, out of ceremony, would not sit on the carpet, but sat\r\non the other side of it, leaving the carpet between them. Then the King\r\nof Bachian gave to him of Tadore five hundred _patol_, as if in payment\r\nof the daughter he was giving as a wife to his brother. _Patols_ are\r\ncloths of gold and silk worked in China, and are very much prized in\r\nthese islands. Each of these cloths is paid for with three bahars of\r\ncloves more or less, according as they are more or less rich in gold\r\nand embroidery. Whenever one of the chief men die, his relations put on\r\nthese cloths to do him honour.\r\n\r\nMonday, the King of Tadore sent a dinner to the king of Bachian,\r\ncarried by fifty women clothed with silk from their waists to their\r\nknees. They went two and two with a man between in the midst of them.\r\nEach one carried a large dish upon which were small dishes with various\r\nviands; ten of the oldest of these women were the mace-bearers. They\r\nproceeded in this way to the prahu, and presented everything to the\r\nking who was sitting on a carpet under a red and yellow canopy. As\r\nthey were returning, they caught some of our men who had come out of\r\ncuriosity and who were obliged to make them presents of some trifle\r\nto get free. After that the king sent also to us a present of goats,\r\ncocoanuts, wine, and other things.\r\n\r\nThis day we bent on the ships new sails, upon which was the cross of\r\nSt. James, of Gallicia, with letters which said: “This is the figure of\r\nour good fortune.”\r\n\r\nTuesday, we presented to the king some pieces of artillery; that is\r\nsome arquebuses which we had taken as prizes in the Indies, and some of\r\nour swivel-guns with four barrels of powder. We took on board each ship\r\neighty barrels of water. Wood we were to find at the island of Mare,\r\nwhere the king had already five days ago sent a hundred men to prepare\r\nit, and near which we were to pass.\r\n\r\nThis day, the King of Bachian, with the consent of the King of Tadore,\r\ncame on shore, preceded by four men holding up daggers in their hands,\r\nto make alliance with us: he said, in the presence of the King of\r\nTadore and of all his suite, that he would always be ready for the\r\nservice of the King of Spain, that he would keep in his name the cloves\r\nleft in his island by the Portuguese, until another Spanish squadron\r\narrived there, and he would not give them up without his consent. He\r\nsent through us to the King of Spain a present of a slave and two\r\nbahars of cloves. He would have wished to have sent ten bahars, but our\r\nships were so heavily laden, that we could not receive any more.\r\n\r\nHe also gave us for the King of Spain two most beautiful dead birds.\r\nThese birds are as large as thrushes; they have small heads, long\r\nbeaks, legs slender like a writing pen, and a span in length; they have\r\nno wings, but instead of them long feathers of different colours, like\r\nplumes: their tail is like that of the thrush. All the feathers, except\r\nthose of the wings, are of a dark colour; they never fly, except when\r\nthe wind blows. They told us that these birds come from the terrestrial\r\nParadise, and they call them “bolon dinata” that is divine birds.\r\n\r\nThe King of Bachian was a man of about seventy years of age. Not only\r\ndid the King of Bachian recognise the King of Spain as his Sovereign;\r\nbut every king of Maluco wrote to him that he desired always to be his\r\nfaithful subject.\r\n\r\nOne day the King of Tadore sent to tell our men, who dwelt in the\r\nmagazine for the merchandise, that they should take care not to go out\r\nof the house by night, since there were certain men, natives of the\r\ncountry, who by anointing themselves, walk by night in the shape of\r\nmen without heads: and if they meet anyone to whom they wish ill, they\r\ntouch his hand and anoint his palm, and that ointment causes him soon\r\nto grow ill, and die at the end of three or four days. But if they meet\r\nthree or four persons together they do not touch them, but make them\r\ngiddy. He added that he had a watch kept to discover them, and he had\r\nalready had several executed.\r\n\r\nWhen they build a new house, before going to inhabit it, they make a\r\nfire round it, and give many feasts there. Then they fasten to the roof\r\nof the house a pattern or sample of everything that is to be found in\r\nthe island, persuaded that by that means none of those things will be\r\never wanting to whoever inhabits the house.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning everything was prepared for our departure from\r\nMaluco. The Kings of Tadore, of Giailolo, and of Bachian, and a son of\r\nthe King of Tarenate had come to accompany us as far as the island of\r\nMare. The ship “Victoria” made sail and stood out a little, waiting\r\nfor the ship “Trinity”; but she had much difficulty in getting up the\r\nanchor, and meanwhile the sailors perceived that she was leaking very\r\nmuch in the hold. Then the “Victoria” returned to anchor in her former\r\nposition. They began to discharge the cargo of the “Trinity” to see if\r\nthe leak could be stopped, for it was perceived that the water came in\r\nwith force as through a pipe, but we were never able to find out at\r\nwhat part it came in. All that day and the next we did nothing else but\r\nwork at the pumps, but without any advantage.\r\n\r\nHearing this, the King of Tadore came at once to the ships, and\r\noccupied himself with us in searching for the leak. For this purpose\r\nhe sent into the sea five of his men, who were accustomed to remain\r\na long time under the water, and although they remained more than\r\nhalf-an-hour they could not find the fissure. As the water inside the\r\nship continually increased, the king, who was as much affected by it as\r\nwe were, and lamenting this misfortune, sent to the end of the island\r\nfor three other men, more skilful than the first at remaining under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHe came with them early the next morning. These men dived under water\r\nwith their hair loose, thinking that their hair, attracted by the\r\nwater which penetrated into the ship, would indicate to them the leak,\r\nbut though they remained more than an hour in the water, they did not\r\nfind it. The king, seeing that there was no remedy for it, said with\r\nlamentation, “Who will go to Spain to take news of me to the king our\r\nlord?” We answered him that the “Victoria” would go there, and would\r\nsail at once to take advantage of the east winds, which had already\r\ncommenced. The “Trinity,” meanwhile, would be refitted and would wait\r\nfor the west winds and go to Darien, which is on the other side of the\r\nsea, in the country of Diucatan.[383] The king approved our thoughts,\r\nand said that he had in his service two hundred and twenty-five\r\ncarpenters who would do all the work under the direction of our men,\r\nand that those who should remain there would be treated as his own\r\nchildren, and he said this with so much emotion that he moved us all to\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nWe, who were on board the “Victoria,” fearing that she might open,\r\non account of the heavy cargo and the long voyage, lightened her by\r\ndischarging sixty hundred weight of cloves, which we had carried to\r\nthe house where the crew of the “Trinity” were lodged. Some of our own\r\ncrew preferred to remain at Maluco rather than go with us to Spain,\r\nbecause they feared that the ship could not endure so long a voyage,\r\nand because, mindful of how much they had suffered, they feared to die\r\nof hunger in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 21st December, day of St. Thomas the Apostle, the King\r\nof Tadore came to the ships and brought us the two pilots, whom we had\r\nalready paid, to conduct us out of these islands. They said that the\r\nweather was then good for sailing at once, but, having to wait for the\r\nletters of our companions who remained behind, and who wished to write\r\nto Spain, we could not sail till midday. Then the ships took leave of\r\none another by a mutual discharge of bombards. Our men accompanied us\r\nfor some distance with their boat, and then with tears and embraces we\r\nseparated. Juan Carvalho remained at Tadore with fifty-three of our\r\nmen: we were forty-seven Europeans and thirteen Indians.\r\n\r\nThe king’s governor[384] came with us as far as the island of Mare:\r\nwe had hardly arrived there when four prahus laden with wood came up,\r\nwhich in less than an hour we got on board. We then took the south-west\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIn all the above-mentioned islands of Maluco are to be found cloves,\r\nginger, sagu, which is their bread made of wood, rice, cocoa-nuts,\r\nplantains, almonds larger than ours, sweet and bitter pomegranates,\r\nsugar-canes, oil of cocoa and of sesame, melons, cucumbers, pumpkins,\r\ncomilicai,[385] which is a refreshing fruit the size of a water-melon,\r\nanother fruit like a peach called guave, and other eatable vegetables.\r\nThey also have goats and fowls, honey produced by bees not larger than\r\nants, which make their hives in trunks of trees. There are also parrots\r\nof many kinds, and amongst them there are white ones called Catara, and\r\nred ones called Nori, which are the most sought after, not so much for\r\nthe beauty of their plumage, as because they talk more clearly. One of\r\nthese is sold for a bahar of cloves.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly fifty years since the Moors conquered Maluco and dwelt\r\nthere. Before that, these islands were inhabited only by Gentiles, who\r\ndid not care for the cloves. There are still some families of them who\r\nhave taken refuge in the mountains, where the cloves grow.\r\n\r\nThe island of Tadore is in 0 deg. 27 min. North latitude, and 161 deg.\r\nwest of the line of demarcation;[386] it is 9 deg. 30 min. distant from\r\nthe first island of this archipelago, named Zamal, to the south-east\r\nand a quarter south. The island of Tarenate is in 0 deg. 40 min. of N.\r\nlatitude. Mutir is exactly under the equinoctial line. Machian is in 0\r\ndeg. 15 min. S. latitude, and Bachian in 1 deg. of the same latitude.\r\nTarenate, Tadore, Mutir, and Machian, are like four high and pointed\r\nmountains,[387] upon which the clove trees grow. Bachian is not visible\r\nfrom these four islands, but it is a larger island than any of those.\r\nIts clove mountain is not so high nor so pointed as those of the other\r\nislands, but it has a larger base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_Book IV of the Milan Edition._)\r\n\r\n                 +Return from the Moluccas to Spain.+\r\n\r\nPursuing our voyage, after having taken in wood at the islet of Mare,\r\nwe passed between the following islands:—Caioan, Laigoma, Sico, Giogi,\r\nCafi, Laboan,[388] Toliman, Titameti, Bachian, Latalata, Jabobi, Mata,\r\nand Batutiga. They told us that in the island of Cafi the people were\r\nsmall and dwarfed like the Pigmies; they have been subjected by force\r\nby the King of Tadore. We passed outside of Batutiga to the west, and\r\nwe steered between west and south-west, and we discovered some islets\r\nto the south, on which account the pilots of Maluco said it would be\r\nbetter to cast anchor so as not to drift at night among many islets and\r\nshoals. We, therefore, altered our course to south-east, and went to\r\nan island situated in 2 deg. S. latitude, and fifty-three leagues from\r\nMaluco.\r\n\r\nThis island is named Sulach;[389] its inhabitants are Gentiles, and\r\nhave not got a king. They eat human flesh; both men and women go naked,\r\nexcept a piece of the bark of a tree of two fingers’ breadth before\r\ntheir natural parts. There are many other islands around here inhabited\r\nby anthropophagi. These are the names of some of them:—Silan, Noselao,\r\nBiga, Atulabaon, Leitimor, Tenetum, Gonda, Kailaruru, Mandan and\r\nBenaia.[390] We left to the east the islands named Lamatola and Tenetum.\r\n\r\nHaving run ten leagues from Sulach in the same direction, we went to a\r\nrather large island named Buru, in which we found plenty of victuals,\r\nsuch as pigs, goats, fowls, sugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, sagu, a certain\r\nfood of theirs made of bananas called kanali, and chiacare, which\r\nhere they call Nanga.[391] The chiacare are fruit like water-melons,\r\nbut knotty on the outside; inside they have some small red fruit like\r\nplums, they have not got a stone in the middle, but instead of that\r\nhave a certain pith like a white bean, but larger, they are tender to\r\neat like chestnuts. We found here another fruit which externally is\r\nlike a pine cone, and it is yellow, but white inside; on cutting, it is\r\nsomething like a pear, but much softer and better tasted. Here it is\r\ncalled comilicai. The inhabitants of this island are Gentiles, and have\r\nno king: they go naked like those of Sulach. The island of Buru is in 3\r\ndeg. 30 min. S. latitude, and seventy-five leagues from Maluco.\r\n\r\nTo the east of this island, at a distance of ten leagues, there is\r\nanother one larger, and which borders on Giailolo, and it is named\r\nAmbon.[392] It is inhabited by Moors and Gentiles, but the former\r\nare on the sea shore, and the others in the interior; these are also\r\nanthropophagi. The products of this island are the same as those of\r\nBuru. Between Buru and Ambon, there are three islands surrounded by\r\nreefs named Vudia, Kailaruru and Benaia. To the south of Buru, at a\r\ndistance of four leagues, is another small island named Ambalao.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-five leagues from Buru, south and a quarter south-west, is\r\nBandon, with thirteen other islands. In six of them grow mace and\r\nnutmeg. Zoroboa is the largest of them, Chelicel, Saniananpi, Pulai,\r\nPuluru, and Rasoghin, the other six are Unuveru, Pulanbaracan, Lailaca,\r\nMamica, Man, and Meut. In these islands nutmegs are not found, but only\r\nsagu, rice, cocoanuts, bananas, and other fruits, and they are near one\r\nanother. The inhabitants of these are Moors, and have no king. Bandan\r\nis in 6 deg. of S. latitude, and 163 deg. 30 min. longitude from the\r\nline of demarcation. As this island was a little out of our course, we\r\ndid not go to it.\r\n\r\nLeaving the island of Buru in the direction south-west and a quarter\r\nwest, about eight degrees of latitude,[393] we arrived at three other\r\nislands near each other named Zolot,[394] Nocemamor, and Galian. Whilst\r\nwe sailed amidst these islands, a great storm fell upon us, for which\r\nwe made a vow of a pilgrimage to our Lady della Guida. We put the ship\r\nbefore the storm and made for a rather high island, which afterwards\r\nwe learned was named Mallua, but before we could reach it, we had\r\nto struggle much with the squalls of wind which descended from the\r\nmountains and with the currents. The inhabitants of this island are\r\nsavages, and more beasts than men; they eat human flesh; they go naked,\r\nexcept the usual piece of bark to cover their natural parts. But when\r\nthey go to fight they wear on the back, the breast, and the flanks,\r\npieces of buffalo hide, ornamented with shells,[395] and boars’ tusks,\r\nand tails of goat skins, hanging before and behind. They wear the hair\r\nraised high up by means of cane combs with long teeth, which go through\r\nit. They wrap up their beards with leaves, and enclose them in cases or\r\ntubes of reed, a thing which seemed to us very ridiculous. In one word\r\nthese were the ugliest men we had seen in these Indies. Both their bows\r\nand arrows are made of reeds, and they carry their food in bags made of\r\nleaves. When their women saw us they came towards us with their bows\r\ndrawn, but when we had given them some presents we soon became friends.\r\n\r\nWe passed fifteen days in this island in caulking the ship whose sides\r\nhad suffered. We found here goats, fowls, wax, cocoanuts, and pepper.\r\nFor a pound of old iron they gave fifteen pounds of wax or of pepper.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of pepper here, the long and the round. The long\r\npepper is like the flower of the hazel tree in winter; its plant is\r\nlike ivy, and like it clings to trees; its leaves are like those of\r\nthe mulberry tree; it is called luli. The round pepper grows like the\r\nother, but its fruit is in ears like Indian corn, and the grains are\r\npulled off in the same manner; it is called lada. The fields here are\r\nfull of pepper plants.\r\n\r\nHere we took a man to conduct us to some island where we could find\r\nplenty of victuals.\r\n\r\nThe island of Mallua is in 8 deg. 30 min. S. latitude, and 169 deg. 40\r\nmin. longitude from the line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nThe old pilot from Maluco related to us, whilst sailing, that in this\r\nneighbourhood there was an island named Aruchete, the inhabitants\r\nof which, men and women, are not more than one cubit high, and they\r\nhave ears as large and as long as themselves, so that when they lie\r\ndown one serves them for a mattress, and with the other they cover\r\nthemselves.[396] They are shorn and naked, their voices are shrill,\r\nand they run very swiftly. They dwell under ground, live on fish and\r\na certain substance which grows between the bark and the wood of a\r\ntree, which is white and round like coriander comfits, and which is\r\nnamed ambulon. We would have gone there willingly, but the shoals and\r\ncurrents did not allow of it.\r\n\r\nSaturday the 25th of January, (1522), at 22 o’clock,[397] we left\r\nthe island of Mallua; and the following day, having run five leagues\r\nto the south-south-east, we arrived at a large island called Timor. I\r\nwent ashore alone to speak to the head man of a village named Amaban,\r\nabout his providing us with victuals. He offered me buffaloes, pigs,\r\nand goats, but when it was a question of the goods which he wanted in\r\nexchange, we could not come to an agreement, because he asked a great\r\ndeal, and we had got very little to give. Then as we were constrained\r\nby hunger, we took the measure of detaining on board the ship the chief\r\nof another village named Balibo, who had come there in good faith with\r\na son of his; and we imposed upon him as a ransom for recovering his\r\nliberty, to give six buffaloes, ten pigs, and ten goats. He, being much\r\nafraid that we should kill him, quickly gave orders to have all this\r\nbrought to us; and as there were only five goats and two pigs, they\r\ngave us instead an additional buffalo. We then sent him ashore with\r\nhis son, and he was well pleased when we not only left him free, but\r\nalso gave him some linen, some Indian cloths of silk and cotton, some\r\nhatchets, some Indian knives, scissors, looking-glasses, and some of\r\nour knives.\r\n\r\nThe chief man, whom I went to speak to first, has only women in his\r\nservice; all were naked like those of the neighbouring islands, and\r\nwear in their ears small gold rings with tufts of silk hanging from\r\nthem; on their arms they wear many rings of gold and copper, which\r\noften cover them up to the elbow. The men are naked like the women, and\r\nwear attached to their necks round plates of gold, and on their heads\r\nreed combs ornamented with gold rings. Some of them, instead of gold\r\nrings, wore in their ears dried necks of gourds.\r\n\r\nIn this island there are buffaloes, pigs, and goats, as has been said;\r\nthere are also fowls and parrots of various colours. There is also\r\nrice, bananas, ginger, sugar canes, oranges, lemons, beans and almonds.\r\n\r\nWe had approached that part of the island where there were some\r\nvillages with their chiefs or head men. On the other side of the island\r\nare the dwellings of four kings, and their districts are named Oibich,\r\nLichsana, Suai, and Cabanaza. Oibich is the largest place. We were told\r\nthat in a mountain near Cabanaza, very much gold is found, and its\r\ninhabitants buy whatever they want with small pieces of gold. All the\r\ntrade in sandal wood and wax, carried on by the people of Malacca and\r\nJava, is done here; and indeed, we found here a junk which had come\r\nfrom Lozon[398] to trade in sandal wood; for white sandal wood only\r\ngrows in this country.\r\n\r\nThese people are Gentiles; we were told that when they go to cut sandal\r\nwood, the devil appears to them in various forms, and tells them that\r\nif they want anything they should ask him for it; but this apparition\r\nfrightens them so much, that they are ill of it for some days.[399] The\r\nsandal wood is cut at a certain phase of the moon, and it is asserted\r\nthat if cut at another time it would not be good. The merchandise\r\nmost fitting for bartering here for sandal wood is red cloth, linen,\r\nhatchets, iron, and nails.\r\n\r\nThis island is entirely inhabited. It extends a long way from east to\r\nwest, and little from north to south. Its south latitude is in 10 deg.,\r\nand the longitude 174 deg. 30 min. from the line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nIn all these islands that we visited in this archipelago, the evil of\r\nSaint Job prevailed, and more here than in any other place, where they\r\ncall it “for franki”, that is to say, Portuguese illness.[400]\r\n\r\nWe were told that at a day’s voyage, west-north-west from Timor, there\r\nwas an island in which much cinnamon grows, called Ende;[401] its\r\ninhabitants are Gentiles, and have no king. Near this are many others\r\nforming a series of islands as far as Java Major, and the Cape of\r\nMalacca. The names of these islands are Ende, Tanabuton, Crenochile,\r\nBimacore, Azanaran, Main, Zubava, Lombok, Chorum, and Java Major, which\r\nby the inhabitants is not called Java but Jaoa.\r\n\r\nIn this island of Java are the largest towns; the principal of them\r\nis Magepaher,[402] the king of which, when he lived, was the greatest\r\nof all the kings of the neighbouring islands, and he was named Raja\r\nPatiunus Sunda. Much pepper grows there. The other towns are—Dahadama,\r\nGagiamada, Minutarangam, Ciparafidain, Tuban, Cressi,[403] and\r\nCirubaya.[404] At half a league from Java Major are the islands of\r\nBali, called Java Minor, and Madura, these are of equal size.\r\n\r\nThey told us that in Java Major, it was the custom when one of the\r\nchief men died, to burn his body; and then his principal wife, adorned\r\nwith garlands of flowers, has herself carried in a chair by four men\r\nthroughout the town, with a tranquil and smiling countenance, whilst\r\ncomforting her relations, who are afflicted because she is going to\r\nburn herself with the corpse of her husband, and encouraging them not\r\nto lament, saying to them, “I am going this evening to sup with my dear\r\nhusband, and to sleep with him this night.” Afterwards, when close to\r\nthe place of the pyre, she again turns towards the relations, and after\r\nagain consoling them, casts herself into the fire and is burned. If she\r\ndid not do this she would not be looked upon as an honourable woman,\r\nnor as a faithful wife.\r\n\r\nOur old pilot related to us other extravagant things. He told us that\r\nthe young men of Java ... and that in an island called Ocoloro, below\r\nJava Major, there are only women who become pregnant with the wind,\r\nand when they bring it forth, if the child is a male, they kill it,\r\nand if a female, they bring it up; and if any man visits their island,\r\nwhenever they are able to kill him, they do so.\r\n\r\nThey also related to us that beyond Java Major, towards the north\r\nin the Gulf of China, which the ancients named Sinus Magnus, there\r\nis an enormous tree named Campanganghi,[405] in which dwell certain\r\nbirds named Garuda,[406] so large that they take with their claws,\r\nand carry away flying, a buffalo, and even an elephant, to the place\r\nof the tree, which place is named Puzathaer. The fruit of this tree\r\nis called Buapanganghi, and is larger than a water melon. The Moors\r\nof Burné, whom we had with us in the ships, told us they had seen two\r\nof these birds, which had been sent to their king from the kingdom of\r\nSiam. No junk, or other vessel, can approach this tree within three or\r\nfour leagues, on account of the great whirlpools which the water makes\r\nthere. They related to us, moreover, how in a wonderful manner what\r\nis related of this tree became known, for a junk, having been carried\r\nthere by the whirlpools, was broken up, and all the seamen perished,\r\nexcept a child who attached himself to a plank and was miraculously\r\nborne near the tree, upon which he mounted. There he placed himself\r\nunder the wing of one of these birds, which was asleep, without its\r\nperceiving him, and next day the bird having taken flight carried him\r\nwith it, and having seen a buffalo on the land, descended to take it;\r\nthe child took advantage of the opportunity to come out from under its\r\nwing, and remained on the ground. In this manner the story of these\r\nbirds and of the tree became known, and it was understood that those\r\nfruits which are frequently found in the sea came from that place.\r\n\r\nWe were told that there were in that kingdom, on the banks of the\r\nrivers, certain birds which feed on carrion, but which will not touch\r\nit unless another bird has first eaten its heart.\r\n\r\nThe Cape of Malacca is in 1 deg. 30 min. of S. latitude. To the east\r\nof that Cape are many cities and towns, of a few of which I will\r\nnote the names—Singapola, which is at the Cape, Pahan, Kalantan,\r\nPatani, Bradlini, Benan, Lagon, Cheregigharan, Trombon, Joran, Ciu,\r\nBrabri, Banga, India, Jandibum, Laun, Langonpifa. All these cities are\r\nconstructed like ours, and are subject to the King of Siam who is named\r\nSiri Zacabedera, and who inhabits Iudia.\r\n\r\nBeyond Siam is situated Camogia; its king is named Saret Zacabedera;\r\nnext Chiempa, the king of which is named Raja Brahami Martu. There\r\ngrows the rhubarb, and it is found in this manner: men go together in\r\ncompanies of twenty or twenty-five, to the woods, and at night ascend\r\nthe trees, both to get out of the way of the lions, the elephants, and\r\nother wild beasts, and also to be able better to smell the odour of\r\nthe rhubarb borne to them by the wind. In the morning they go to that\r\nquarter whence they have perceived that the odour comes, and seek for\r\nthe rhubarb till they find it. This is the rotten wood of a large tree,\r\nwhich acquires its odour by putrefaction.[407] The best part of the\r\ntree is the root, but the trunk is also good, which is called Calama.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Cocchi[408] lies next, its sovereign is named Raja\r\nSeri Bummipala. After that follows Great China, the king of which is\r\nthe greatest sovereign of the world, and is called Santoa raja. He\r\nhas seventy crowned kings under his dependence; and some of these\r\nkings have ten or fifteen lesser kings dependent on them. The port of\r\nthis kingdom is named Guantan,[409] and among the many cities of this\r\nempire, two are the most important, namely Nankin and Comlaha, where\r\nthe king usually resides.\r\n\r\nHe has four of his principal ministers close to his palace, at the\r\nfour sides looking to the four cardinal winds, that is, one to the\r\nwest, one to the east, to the south, and to the north. Each of these\r\ngives audience to those that come from his quarter. All the kings and\r\nlords of India major and superior obey this king, and in token of their\r\nvassalage, each is obliged to have in the middle of the principal place\r\nof his city the marble figure of a certain animal named Chinga, an\r\nanimal more valiant than the lion; the figure of this animal is also\r\nengraved on the king’s seal, and all who wish to enter his port must\r\ncarry the same emblem in wax or ivory.\r\n\r\nIf any lord is disobedient to him, he is flayed, and his skin, dried\r\nin the sun, salted, and stuffed, is placed in an eminent part of the\r\npublic place, with the head inclined and the hands on the head in the\r\nattitude of doing zongu, that is obeisance to the king.\r\n\r\nHe is never visible to anybody; and if he wishes to see his people, he\r\nis carried about the palace on a peacock most skilfully manufactured,\r\nand very richly adorned, with six ladies dressed exactly like himself,\r\nso that he cannot be distinguished from them. He afterwards passes into\r\na richly-adorned figure of a serpent called Naga, which has a large\r\nglass in the breast, through which he and the ladies are seen, but\r\nit is not possible to distinguish which is the king. He marries his\r\nsisters in order that his blood should not mix with that of others.\r\n\r\nHis palace has seven walls round it, and in each circle there are\r\ndaily ten thousand men on guard, who are changed every twelve hours\r\nat the sound of a bell. Each wall has its gate, with a guard at each\r\ngate. At the first stands a man with a great scourge in his hand,\r\nnamed Satuhoran[410] with Satubagan; at the second a dog called\r\nSatuhain;[411] at the third, a man with an iron mace, called Satuhoran\r\nwith pocumbecin;[412] at the fourth, a man with a bow in his hand,\r\ncalled Satuhoran with anatpanan;[413] at the fifth, a man with a\r\nlance, called Satuhoran, with tumach;[414] at the sixth, a lion called\r\nSatuhorimau;[415] at the seventh, two white elephants called Gagiapute.\r\n\r\nThe palace contains seventy-nine halls, in which dwell only the ladies\r\ndestined to serve the king; there are always torches burning there. It\r\nis not possible to go round the palace in less than a day. In the upper\r\npart of it are four halls where the ministers go to speak to the king:\r\none is ornamented with metal, both the pavement and the walls; another\r\nis all of silver, another all of gold, and the other is set with pearls\r\nand precious stones. The gold and other valuable things which are\r\nbrought as tribute to the king are placed in these rooms; and when they\r\nare there deposited, they say, Let this be for the honour and glory\r\nof our Santoa Raja. All these things and many others relating to this\r\nking, were narrated to us by a Moor, who said that he had seen them.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are white, and are clothed; they eat on tables like us.\r\nThey have crosses, but it is not known why they have them.\r\n\r\nIt is from China that musk comes; the animal which produces it is a\r\nkind of cat, like the civet cat; it eats nothing but a certain soft\r\nwood, slender as a finger, named chamaru. To extract the musk from\r\nthis animal they attach a leech to it, and leave it till it is full\r\nof blood, and when they see that it is well filled, they crush it,\r\nand collect the blood in a plate, and put it in the sun for four or\r\nfive days, moistening it every day with urine. In this way it becomes\r\nperfect musk. Whoever keeps one of these cats pays a tribute to the\r\nking. The grains of musk which come to Europe as musk, are only small\r\npieces of kid’s flesh soaked in real musk, and not the blood, since\r\nthough it can be made into grains, it easily evaporates. The cat which\r\nproduces musk is called castor, and the leech is called Linta.\r\n\r\nContinuing along the coast of China, many nations are met with, and\r\nthey are these: the Chienchi, who inhabit the islands in which they\r\nfish for pearls, and where the cinnamon grows. The Lecchii inhabit the\r\nmainland: the entrance to their port is traversed by a large rock, for\r\nwhich reason all the junks and vessels which wish to enter must take\r\ndown their masts. The king of this country is called Moni. He has on\r\nthe mainland twenty kings under him, and he is subject to the King of\r\nChina: his capital is Baranaci, and here is situated Oriental Cathay.\r\nHan is a high and cold island, where there is copper, silver, pearls,\r\nand silk; its king is named Raja Zotra. There is also Miliaula, the\r\nking of which is named Raja Quetischeniga, and Guio, the king of which\r\nis Raja Sudacali. These places are cold and on the mainland. Friagonba\r\nand Trianga are two islands which also produce copper, silver, pearls,\r\nand silk; their king is Raja Ruzon. Bassi is a low land on the\r\ncontinent. There come afterwards Sumbdit and Pradit, two islands very\r\nrich in gold, where the men wear a large ring of gold round the ankle.\r\nIn the neighbouring mountains dwell people who kill their parents when\r\nthey are old, so that they may cease from travail. All the people of\r\nthese countries are Gentiles.\r\n\r\nTuesday night (between it and Wednesday,) on the 11th of February of\r\n1522, we left the island of Timor, and entered upon the great sea named\r\nLaut Chidol,[416] and taking a west-south-west course, we left to the\r\nright and to the North, from fear of the Portuguese, the island of\r\nZumatra, anciently named Taprobana; also Pegu, Bengala, Urizza, Chelim,\r\nwhere are the Malabars, subjects of the King of Narsinga: Calicut which\r\nis under the same king; Cambaya in which are the Guzeratis; Cananor,\r\nGoa, Armus, and all the other coast of India major.\r\n\r\nIn this kingdom dwell six classes of persons, that is to say: Nairs,\r\nPanicals, Franas, Pangelins, Macuas, and Poleas. The Nairs are the\r\nchiefs; the Panicals are the townspeople; these two classes live and\r\nconverse together. The Franas collect the wine from the palm trees and\r\nthe bananas. The Macuas are fishermen; and the Poleas sow and harvest\r\nthe rice; these last always dwell in the fields, and never enter the\r\ncity, and when it is desired to give them anything, it is placed on the\r\nground and they take it. When they go along the roads they always cry\r\nout, po, po, po, that is take care of yourself; and we were told that a\r\nNair who had been accidentally touched by a Polea, not to survive such\r\na disgrace, had himself killed.\r\n\r\nIn order to double the Cape of Good Hope, we went as far as 42° South\r\nlatitude, and we remained off that cape for nine weeks, with the sails\r\nstruck on account of the Western and North-western gales which beat\r\nagainst our bows with fierce squalls. The Cape of Good Hope is in 34°\r\n30′ South latitude, 1600 leagues distant from the Cape of Malacca, and\r\nit is the largest and most dangerous cape in the world.\r\n\r\nSome of our men, and among them the sick, would have liked to land at\r\na place belonging to the Portuguese called Mozambique, both because\r\nthe ship made much water, and because of the great cold which we\r\nsuffered; and much more because we had nothing but rice and water for\r\nfood and drink, all the meat of which we had made provision having\r\nputrified, for the want of salt had not permitted us to salt it. But\r\nthe greater number of us, prizing honour more than life itself, decided\r\non attempting at any risk to return to Spain.\r\n\r\nAt length, by the aid of God, on the 6th of May, we passed that\r\nterrible cape, but we were obliged to approach it within only five\r\nleagues distance, or else we should never have passed it. We then\r\nsailed towards the north-west for two whole months without ever taking\r\nrest; and in this short time we lost twenty-one men between Christians\r\nand Indians. We made then a curious observation on throwing them into\r\nthe sea, that was that the Christians remained with the face turned\r\nto the sky, and the Indians with the face turned to the sea. If God\r\nhad not granted us favourable weather, we should all have perished of\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nConstrained by extreme necessity, we decided on touching at the Cape\r\nVerde Islands, and on Wednesday the 9th of July, we touched at one of\r\nthose islands named St. James’s. Knowing that we were in an enemy’s\r\ncountry, and amongst suspicious persons, on sending the boat ashore\r\nto get provision of victuals, we charged the seamen to say to the\r\nPortuguese that we had sprung our foremast under the equinoctial line\r\n(although this misfortune had happened at the Cape of Good Hope), and\r\nthat our ship was alone, because whilst we tried to repair it, our\r\ncaptain-general had gone with the other two ships to Spain. With these\r\ngood words, and giving some of our merchandise in exchange, we obtained\r\ntwo boat-loads of rice.\r\n\r\nIn order to see whether we had kept an exact account of the days, we\r\ncharged those who went ashore to ask what day of the week it was, and\r\nthey were told by the Portuguese inhabitants of the island that it was\r\nThursday, which was a great cause of wondering to us, since with us\r\nit was only Wednesday. We could not persuade ourselves that we were\r\nmistaken; and I was more surprised than the others, since having always\r\nbeen in good health, I had every day, without intermission, written\r\ndown the day that was current. But we were afterwards advised that\r\nthere was no error on our part, since as we had always sailed towards\r\nthe west, following the course of the sun, and had returned to the same\r\nplace, we must have gained twenty-four hours, as is clear to any one\r\nwho reflects upon it.\r\n\r\nThe boat, having returned for rice a second time to the shore, was\r\ndetained, with thirteen men[417] who were in it. As we saw that, and,\r\nfrom the movement in certain caravels, suspected that they might wish\r\nto capture us and our ship, we at once set sail. We afterwards learned,\r\nsome time after our return, that our boat and men had been arrested,\r\nbecause one of our men had discovered the deception, and said that the\r\ncaptain-general was dead, and that our ship was the only one remaining\r\nof Magellan’s fleet.\r\n\r\nAt last, when it pleased Heaven, on Saturday the 6th of September\r\nof the year 1522, we entered the bay of San Lucar; and of sixty men\r\nwho composed our crew when we left Maluco, we were reduced to only\r\neighteen,[417] and these for the most part sick. Of the others, some\r\ndied of hunger, some had run away at the island of Timor, and some had\r\nbeen condemned to death for their crimes.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when we left this bay of San Lucar until our return\r\nthither, we reckoned that we had run more than fourteen thousand four\r\nhundred and sixty leagues, and we had completed going round the earth\r\nfrom East to West.\r\n\r\nMonday the 8th of September, we cast anchor near the mole of Seville,\r\nand discharged all the artillery.\r\n\r\nTuesday, we all went in shirts and barefoot, with a taper in our hands\r\nto visit the shrine of St. Maria of Victory, and of St. Maria de\r\nAntigua.\r\n\r\nThen, leaving Seville, I went to Valladolid, where I presented to his\r\nSacred Majesty Don Carlos, neither gold nor silver, but things much\r\nmore precious in the eyes of so great a Sovereign. I presented to him\r\namong other things, a book written by my hand of all the things that\r\nhad occurred day by day in our voyage. I departed thence as I was best\r\nable, and went to Portugal, and related to King John the things which I\r\nhad seen. Returning through Spain, I came to France, where I presented\r\na few things from the other hemisphere to Madam the Regent, mother of\r\nthe most Christian King Don Francis.[418] Afterwards, I turned towards\r\nItaly, where I established for ever my abode, and devoted my leisure\r\nand vigils to the very illustrious and noble lord, Philip de Villiers\r\nLisleadam, the very worthy grand master of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n                                             The Chevalier,\r\n\r\n                                                +Anthoyne Pigaphete+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TREATISE OF NAVIGATION\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                      CHEVALIER ANTONY PIGAFETTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe armillary sphere, of which the author gives a drawing, serves\r\nto explain the system of the world according to Ptolemy, and could\r\nalso serve as an astrolabe, for one sees at the top of it a kind of\r\nhandle or ring, by which to hold it suspended, as is seen in the\r\nabove-mentioned drawing. He begins his treatise by giving us an idea of\r\nthat system, as have done all those after him, who have written of the\r\nelements of the nautical art and of pilotage.\r\n\r\n“The earth is round,” he says, “and remains suspended and immovable in\r\nthe midst of all the celestial bodies. The first index fixed on two\r\npoles, the arctic and antarctic, which are supposed to correspond with\r\nthe poles of the earth. It runs from East to West, and transports with\r\nitself all the planets and stars. Besides this there is the eighth\r\nsphere, the poles of which are at 23 deg. 33 min.,[419] it runs from\r\nWest to East.”\r\n\r\n“It is supposed that all the circumference of the earth is divided\r\ninto 360 degrees; and each degree is of 17 leagues and a half,\r\nconsequently the circumference of the earth is 6,300 leagues. Land\r\nleagues are of three miles and sea leagues of four miles.[420]”\r\n\r\n“The ten circles of the armillary sphere, of which the six major pass\r\nthrough the center of the earth, serve to determine the situation\r\nof countries and climates. The Ecliptic determines the movement of\r\nthe sun and the planets: the two Tropics indicate the point to which\r\nthe sun declines from the equator towards the North in summer, and\r\ntowards the South in winter. The Meridian, always variable, because it\r\npasses through all points of the equator, cutting it perpendicularly,\r\ndesignates the longitude, and it is on it that the latitudes are\r\nmarked.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            +Of Latitude.+\r\n\r\nAfter having well explained the armillary sphere with all its parts,\r\nand their use according to the system of Ptolemy, the author goes on\r\nto teach the method of taking the altitude of the pole, on which the\r\nlatitude is calculated; fixing the pole at 0° and the equator at 90°.\r\n\r\n“The Polar star,” he says, “is not precisely on the point\r\ncorresponding to the axis of the earth; but it turns round it, as do\r\nall the other stars. In order to know its true position with regard\r\nto the pole, it must be observed where the Guard stars[421] stand. If\r\nthese are on the western arm,[422] the polar star stands one degree\r\nabove the pole: if they are on the line[423] the pole star stands 3\r\ndeg. 30 min.[424] below the pole: if they are on the eastern arm the\r\npole star is one degree below the pole. When one wishes to take the\r\naltitude of the pole star, in whichever of the above-mentioned four\r\nplaces the Guard stars may be, the degrees which the pole star has\r\nabove the pole will be subtracted from its altitude, or those which it\r\nhas below the pole will be added to it. I have spoken in the account of\r\nthe voyage of the stars of the Antarctic Pole.”\r\n\r\n“The latitude of the place may also be ascertained by the sun’s\r\naltitude. 1. If you find yourself between the equinoctial and the\r\narctic pole and the shadow falls towards that pole, look how many\r\ndegrees and minutes meridianal declination the sun has that day; and\r\nthis you will subtract from the altitude of the sun which you have\r\ntaken: afterwards, deducting the remaining degrees from 90 deg., you\r\nwill have in the residue the number of degrees of North latitude,\r\nthat is your distance from the equator. 2. If the sun has a boreal\r\ndeclination, in such a manner that the shadow falls towards the south,\r\ntake the sun’s declination on that day, and add it to the sun’s\r\naltitude which you have taken, from that sum subtract 90 degs., and\r\nthe remaining degrees will indicate your boreal latitude. 3. If the\r\nsun is between the equinoctial and the antarctic, and the shadow falls\r\ntowards the antarctic, observe the sun’s declination for that day,\r\nsubtract it from the altitude taken, according to the first rule, and\r\nyou will have the degrees of south latitude. 4. If, when you and the\r\nsun are between the equinoctial and the antarctic pole, the shadow\r\nfalls towards the north, you will add the altitude you have taken to\r\nthe sun’s declination that day, and act according to the second rule.\r\n5. When you have an altitude of 90 deg., you will be so many degrees\r\ndistant from the equator as there are degrees of the sun’s declination,\r\nand if the sun has no declination you will be under the equator. 6. If\r\nyou are to the north of the equator, and the sun is in the southern\r\nsigns you will look what is its declination, you will add these degrees\r\nof declination to those of the altitude observed, and as many degrees\r\nas are wanting from 90 deg., so many will you be distant from the\r\nequinoctial. 7. You will do the same when you find yourself to the\r\nsouth of the equinoctial, whilst the sun is in the northern signs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            +Of Longitude.+\r\n\r\n“Longitude indicates the degrees from east to west: I have considered\r\nmany methods or means for ascertaining it, and I have found three\r\nmethods[425] fitting for that object. The last is the most convenient\r\nfor those who do not know astrology. At the present time the pilots\r\ncontent themselves with knowing the latitude; and are so proud that\r\nthey will not hear speak of longitude.”\r\n\r\n“I. From the latitude of the moon the longitude is calculated of the\r\nplace in which the observation is made. The distance of the moon from\r\nthe ecliptic is called its latitude: the ecliptic is the path of the\r\nsun. The moon, in its movement, always increases its distance until\r\nit reaches the furthest point of its distance: and thence it returns\r\nback, to diminish, so to say, its latitude, until it is with the head\r\nor tail of the dragon:[426] there it cuts the ecliptic. And since the\r\nmoon, whilst it lengthens its distance from the ecliptic, has more\r\ndegrees towards the west than towards the east, it must necessarily\r\nhave more latitude on one side (_of the globe_) than on the other:\r\nand when the latitude is known, by measuring the degrees and minutes\r\nwith the astrolabe, it will be known whether it is found, and how far\r\nit is found towards the east or the west. But in order to ascertain\r\nthe longitude, you must know in what latitude the moon ought to be at\r\nthat same moment in the place from which you sailed, for instance, in\r\nSeville. By knowing the latitude and longitude of the moon at Seville\r\nin degrees and minutes, and seeing also the latitude and longitude\r\nwhich it has in the place where you are, you will know how many hours\r\nand minutes you are distant from Seville; and afterwards you will\r\ncalculate the distance in east or west longitude.”\r\n\r\n“II. The moon furnishes another method for ascertaining the\r\nlongitude, but that is when I knew the precise hour in which the moon\r\nobserved at Seville ought to be in conjunction with a given star or\r\nplanet, or ought to be in a certain opposition to the sun, of which the\r\ndegrees are determined: and this I can know by means of an almanack.\r\nAnd since that happens in the east before it happens in the west, as\r\nmany as may be the hours and minutes that may elapse from the time\r\nwhen the conjunction took place at Seville, till the time in which I\r\nobserve it to take place, so much will be my longitude west of Seville.\r\nBut if I should see the conjunction take place before the hour in\r\nwhich it ought to happen with respect to Seville, then my distance in\r\nlongitude will be east. For each hour, fifteen degrees of longitude are\r\ncalculated.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“To understand this does not require any great genius. It should be\r\nborne in mind that the moon has a motion opposed to the general motion\r\nof the heavens; that is, it goes from west to east, and in every two\r\nhours it progresses a degree and a few minutes; and since it is in\r\nthe first heaven, and the stars are in the eighth, it certainly never\r\nenters in conjunction with them; but sometimes it interposes itself\r\nbefore the rays which come from them to our eye: but this does not\r\nhappen at the same time to those who are at Seville, and to those who\r\nare at Valencia. The annexed figure will give an idea of this, from\r\nwhich it is seen that the ray of the star +d+ is intercepted by the\r\nmoon +c+ for those who are at +a+, and not for those who are at +B+,\r\nfor whom it was intercepted when the moon was at +e+.”\r\n\r\n“III. The compass can also supply a method, still easier, for finding\r\nthe longitude of the place in which you are. It is known that the\r\ncompass, or the magnetised needle which is in it, directs itself to a\r\ngiven point, because of the tendency which the loadstone has towards\r\nthe pole. The reason of this tendency is because the loadstone does not\r\nfind in the heavens any other spot in repose except the pole, and on\r\nthat account directs itself towards it. This is an explanation of the\r\nphenomenon which I propose; and I believe it to be true, so long as\r\nexperience does not inform us of some better explanation.”\r\n\r\n“In order to know, by means of the needle, the degrees of longitude,\r\nform a large circle, in which place the compass, and divide it into 360\r\ndeg.: and having placed the needle at 360 deg., where it indicates the\r\narctic pole; when the needle is in repose, draw a thread, which should\r\npass from the arctic pole, pointed out by the needle to the antarctic\r\npole, and let this thread be longer than the diameter. After that take\r\nthe south, which you will know by the greatest altitude of the sun.\r\nTurn the compass, until the thread which traverses it coincides with\r\nthe direction of the meridian shade; then, from the antarctic pole of\r\nthe needle, with the thread which remained over, draw another thread\r\nto the arctic pole, that is, to the flower;[427] and you will thus\r\nfind how many degrees the needle of the compass is distant from the\r\nmeridian line, that is, from the true pole. So many will be the degrees\r\nof longitude, which you will have from the place where the compass\r\nbegins to set itself in motion.[428] Therefore, with the more accuracy\r\nyou take the true meridian so much the more exactly will you be able\r\nto ascertain the degrees of longitude. And from this it may be seen\r\nthat the meridian should never be taken with the compass, because it\r\nnorth-easts or north-wests,[429] as soon as it goes out of the true\r\nmeridian; but take an observation of the south[430] with the astrolabe,\r\nand judge that it is midday when the sun is at its greatest height.”\r\n\r\n“If it is not possible to take the sun’s altitude at midday, that\r\ncan be determined with an hour-glass of sand, taking the hours of\r\nthe night from sunset till the moment of its rising. Having learned\r\nthe hours of the night, you will know how many are wanting of the\r\ntwenty-four, and these you will divide into two equal parts. When half\r\nof this has elapsed, be sure that it is midday, and that the shadow\r\nindicates to you the true meridian. But since the sand clock may often\r\nbe inexact, it will be better to take the sun’s altitude with the\r\nastrolabe by means of its mediclino.[431]”\r\n\r\n“The true meridian may also be ascertained, or rather the equinoctial\r\nline, which cuts the meridian at right angles, by observing the points\r\nwhere the sun rises and sets, and by observing how much they are\r\ndistant from the equinoctial either to the north or to the south. For\r\nthis purpose an astrolabe is formed with the globe; that is, a circle\r\nis made representing the earth’s circumference, divided into 360 deg.\r\nAt sunrise fix two pins in the circumference, in such a manner that a\r\nline drawn from one to the other should pass through the centre, and\r\nplace the pins so that both should be in a line opposite the sun’s\r\ncenter. Place two other pins in the same way in the circumference when\r\nthe sun sets. You will thus see how much the sun declines from the\r\nequinoctial line, either to the north or to the south. And as many\r\ndegrees as the pins are distant from the equinoctial, so many degrees\r\nare the sun’s declination. Having found the sun’s rising and setting,\r\nyou will also find the medium distance; that is, the meridian line,\r\nand afterwards you will see how much the compass or magnetic needle\r\nnorth-easts or north-wests. You will infer from this how far you are\r\nfrom the Fortunate islands; that is, from Tenerife towards the east or\r\nthe west. This method has been tried by experience.[432]”\r\n\r\n                       +Direction of the Ship.+\r\n\r\n“If you wish to navigate to any place, you must first know its\r\nposition; that is, its latitude and longitude. Then, by means of the\r\ncompass you will point directly to that place. And since the compass\r\nvaries to east and west, you must, by the methods above described,\r\nascertain its variation, and subtract or add that which is necessary,\r\nso that the ship’s head, regulated by the compass, may have the\r\nrequired direction.”\r\n\r\n“Should the compass be lost, or if its variation east or west is not\r\nknown, you may regulate yourself by the sun at midday. When you have\r\nfixed the meridian in such a manner that it cuts the ship in its width,\r\nit will be easy to direct the prow wherever you wish. Here is an\r\nexample: suppose you wish to go from north-east to south-west, place\r\nthe chart in such manner that the ship should have her head to west and\r\nthe poop to the east; then on the circle of the winds, divided into\r\n360, or in four times 90, fix two pins, one at 45 degrees between east\r\nand north, the other at 45 degrees between west and south; bring the\r\ntwo pins on the line of the meridian by turning the ship’s head for\r\nthat purpose, and the prow will be directed to the place to which you\r\nare going. If the pins do not come in a line with the meridian, it is a\r\nsign that you are navigating in a false direction, and you must rectify\r\nthe course. When you reach land, you will see that what I have said is\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\n“With an astrolabe made with plates,[433] observations may be taken\r\nof the meridian line, the poles, and the equinoctial line, at any hour\r\nof the day or night, looking at the moon or any star; and for these,\r\nplace in the middle of the astrolabe instead of the _verghezita_ or\r\nsight,[434] two straight bars between which you will observe the star.”\r\n\r\nThus the method being known by which the required direction is given\r\nto the ship, the author teaches the method for determining the point\r\nor degree on the chart of the winds,[435] to which the ship on leaving\r\na place to go to a given country should be directed. For clearness, he\r\ngives some examples of this. “Do you wish,” he says, “to go from south\r\nto north, or _vice versâ_, on the same longitude? always proceed on the\r\nsame meridian. Do you wish to go from east to west, or _vice versâ_, in\r\nthe same latitude? always proceed on the same parallel. Do you wish to\r\ngo from one place to another as many degrees distant in longitude as\r\nit is different in latitude? Then take the course of 45 degrees either\r\nto the south-west or south-east, or north-west or north-east. If the\r\nlatitude is greater than the longitude, then add to the 45 degrees\r\nas many degrees towards the nearest pole, as the number of degrees\r\nby which the latitude exceeds the longitude. For instance, if I wish\r\nto go from Cape St. Vincent to Cape Bojador, I reckon the degrees of\r\nlongitude and those of latitude to know the difference between these\r\ntwo capes. I find that the degrees of longitude are five and a half,\r\nand those of latitude are eleven, from which I subtract the degrees of\r\nlongitude and there remain 5 deg. 30 min. Then, instead of going in\r\nthe direction of from north-east to south-west (as I should do if the\r\nlongitude were equal to the latitude), I go from 5 deg. 30 min. above\r\nnorth-east towards north, to 5 deg. 30 min. below south-west towards\r\nsouth. If the longitude is greater than the latitude, the lesser number\r\nis still subtracted from the greater; and the direction will be 45 deg.\r\nafter deducting the residue. For instance, do you want to go from the\r\nisland of Ferro to Guadeloupe; you know that the first is in 27 deg.\r\nlatitude and the second in 15 deg.; then take their difference, which\r\nis 12 deg.: look at the map for their longitude, and you see that Ferro\r\nis in 1 deg. and Guadeloupe in 45 deg., whence their difference is 44\r\ndeg.: subtract from these the 12 deg. residue of latitude, and there\r\nremain 32 deg. Then you must subtract these 32 deg. from 45 deg., and\r\nthere will remain 13 deg. Therefore your course will be from north-east\r\n13 deg. north to south-west 13 deg. south.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       +Direction of the Winds.+\r\n\r\n“The rose of the winds, divided into 360 deg., will give a clearer idea\r\nof what has been here said; it being well understood that the pilot\r\nmust place the center of the winds on the point from which he starts,\r\nor from which he takes the course, and he must fix the pole to the true\r\npole observed from the sun, and not trusting to the compass, which\r\nnorth-easts or north-wests.”\r\n\r\n“Then, to ascertain whence comes the wind, place a little stick with a\r\nlittle sail[436] in the centre of your rose or circle of winds, divided\r\ninto 360 deg., and placed in such a manner that north and south stand\r\non the true Solar meridian. The direction of the vane moved by the wind\r\nwill indicate exactly which wind blows: on the equinoctial is east\r\nand west; at 45 deg. there is north-east, south-west, north-west, and\r\nsouth-east; at 22½ deg. towards north you have north-north-east, and so\r\non with the others.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NAMES OF THE FIRST CIRCUMNAVIGATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Herrera+ (Decade III, lib. iv, cap. 4) mentions the arrival of\r\nthe _Victoria_, and says that an accountant and thirteen Castilians\r\nhad remained behind, arrested at Cape Verde, and that the King of\r\nPortugal’s factor sent them on to Lisbon in a ship which came at that\r\ntime from Calicut.\r\n\r\nHerrera then gives the names of those who came in the _Victoria_, and\r\nwho went to Court.

Juan Sebastian del Cano.\r\n\r\nThis number, 31, will agree with Pigafetta’s 13, who remained at Cape\r\nVerde, and 18 who landed from the _Victoria_.\r\n\r\nSebastian del Cano was very well received by the emperor, and\r\nHerrera mentions the safe arrival of some of the Molucca Indians:\r\n“One of whom,” he says, “was so sharp, that the first thing he did\r\nwas to inquire how many reals a ducat was worth, and a real how many\r\nmaravedises, and how much pepper was given for a maravedi; and he went\r\nfrom shop to shop to get information of the value of spices, and with\r\nthis he gave cause that he did not return to his country, although\r\nthe others returned.” This probably means that he was not allowed to\r\nreturn, lest he should raise the price of spices in the Molucca Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHART OF THE\r\n  +Pacific Ocean+\r\n  Showing the track of\r\n  +Magellan’s Ships+\r\n  in the Years 1519–22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ORDER OF THE DAY OF MAGELLAN,\r\n\r\n  _Given in the Straits, which fell into the hands of the Portuguese,\r\n               along with the Papers of the Astrologer_\r\n               +Andres de San Martin+, _at the Moluccas:\r\n                  taken from_ +Barros+, _Decade_ III,\r\n                         _Liv._ v, _Cap._ 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I Fernan de Magalhaes, Knight of the Order of St. James, and\r\ncaptain-general of this fleet, which his majesty sent for the discovery\r\nof the spices, etc. I make known to you, Duarte Barbosa, captain of\r\nthe ship _Victoria_, and to the pilots, masters, and quarter-masters\r\nof that ship, as I have understood that it seems to you all a serious\r\nmatter, that I am determined to go forward, because it seems to you\r\nthat the weather is little fitted for this voyage on which we are\r\ngoing; and inasmuch as I am a man who never rejected the opinion\r\nor counsel of any one, but rather all my affairs are discussed and\r\ncommunicated generally to all, without any person being affronted by\r\nme; and since, because of that which happened in the port of S.

GIOVANNI BATTISTA RAMUSIO\r\n                               UPON THE\r\n             VOYAGE MADE BY THE SPANIARDS ROUND THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage made by the Spaniards round the world in the space of\r\nthree years is one of the greatest and most marvellous things which\r\nhave been heard of in our times; and, although in many things we\r\nsurpass the ancients, yet this expedition far excels every other that\r\nhas been made up till now. The voyage was described very minutely\r\nby Peter Martyr, who belonged to the Council of the Indies of His\r\nMajesty the Emperor, and to whom was entrusted the duty of writing\r\nthis history; and by him were examined all those who remained alive of\r\nthat expedition, and who reached Seville in the year 1522. But, as it\r\nwas sent to be printed in Rome, it was lost in the miserable sacking\r\nof that city; and nothing is known even now as to where it is. And he\r\nwho saw it, and read it, bears testimony to the same; and, amongst\r\nother things worthy of recollection that the aforesaid Peter noted\r\nconcerning the voyage, was this, that the Spaniards, having sailed\r\nabout three years and one month, and the greater part of them, as is\r\nusual amongst seafaring men, having noted down the days of the months\r\none by one, found, when they arrived in Spain, that they had lost a\r\nday, for the day on which they arrived at Seville, which was the 7th\r\nof September, was, by their reckoning, the 6th. And the aforesaid\r\nPeter having mentioned this peculiarity to a certain excellent and\r\nextraordinary man, who was at that time ambassador for his Republic to\r\nHis Majesty; and, having asked him how it could be, he, who was a great\r\nphilosopher and learned in Greek and Latin literature, so that for his\r\nsingular learning and rare excellence, he was afterwards promoted to\r\nmuch higher rank, gave this explanation: That it could not have fallen\r\nout otherwise, as they had travelled for three years continuously and\r\nalways accompanied the sun, which was going westward. And he told him\r\nbesides, that those who sailed due westwards towards the sun, lengthen\r\ntheir day very much, as the ancients also had noticed. Now, the book\r\nof the aforesaid Peter having disappeared, Fortune has not allowed the\r\nmemory of so marvellous an enterprise to be entirely lost, inasmuch as\r\na certain noble gentleman of Vicenza called Messer Antonio Pigafetta\r\n(who, having gone on the voyage and returned in the ship _Victoria_,\r\nwas made a Knight of Rhodes), wrote a very exact and full account\r\nof it in a book, one copy of which he presented to His Majesty the\r\nEmperor, and another he sent to the most Serene Mother of the most\r\nChristian King, the Lady Regent. She entrusted to an excellent Parisian\r\nphilosopher called Jacomo Fabre, who had studied in Italy, the work\r\nof translating it into French.[437] This worthy person, I suppose to\r\nsave himself trouble, made only a summary of it, leaving out what\r\nseemed fit to him; and this was printed, very incorrectly, in France,\r\nand has now come into our hands; and along with it a letter from one\r\ncalled Maximilianus of Transylvania, a secretary of His Majesty the\r\nEmperor, to the most Reverend Cardinal of Salzburg. And this we have\r\nwished to add to this volume of travels, as one of the greatest and\r\nmost remarkable that there has ever been, and one at which those\r\ngreat philosophers of old, hearing of it, would have been stupified\r\nand beside themselves. And the city of Vicenza may well boast, among\r\nthe other cities of Italy, that in addition to its nobility and high\r\nqualities; in addition to its many rare and excellent geniuses, both\r\nin letters and arms, there has been a gentleman of such courage as\r\nthe aforesaid Messer Antonio Pigafetta, who has circumnavigated the\r\nwhole globe, and has described it so exactly. There is no doubt that\r\nthe ancients would have erected a statue of marble to him, and would\r\nhave placed it in an honourable position, as a memorial and example to\r\nposterity of his great worth, and in acknowledgment of so stupendous an\r\nenterprise. But if, in this letter or in the summary, there be seen any\r\ndiscrepancy of names or things, let no one be astonished; for the bent\r\nof men’s minds is various, and one notices one thing and one another,\r\njust as the things appear most deserving of attention. Let it suffice\r\nif, in the principal things they agree, and many parts which are left\r\nout in one can be read at length in the other. Fabulous stories, too,\r\nare noted for what they are. This may be safely affirmed by anyone,\r\nthat the ancients never had such a knowledge of the world, which the\r\nsun goes round and examines every twenty-four hours, as we have at\r\npresent, through the industry of the men of these our times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost Reverend and Illustrious Lord, my only Lord, to you I most humbly\r\ncommend myself.\r\n\r\nOne of those five ships has lately returned which Cæsar sent in former\r\nyears, when he was living at Saragossa, to a strange, and for so many\r\nages, an unknown world, in order to search for the islands where spices\r\ngrow. For though the Portuguese bring a great quantity of them from\r\nthe Golden Chersonesus, which we now suppose to be Malacca, yet their\r\nown Indies produce nothing but pepper. Other spices, such as cinnamon,\r\ncloves, and the nutmeg, which we call muscat, and its covering (mace),\r\nwhich we call muscat flower, are brought to their own Indies from\r\ndistant islands till now only known by name, and in ships which are\r\nfastened together not by iron but by palm leaves. The sails of these\r\nships are round and woven, too, of the palm-fibre. This sort of ships\r\nthey call junks, and they only use them with a wind directly fore and\r\naft.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that these islands should be unknown to any human\r\nbeings almost up to our time. For whatever we read concerning the\r\nnative soil of the spices has been told us by ancient authors, and is\r\npartly, certainly, fabulous; and, partly, so far from the truth, that\r\neven the very countries in which they said that they grew naturally,\r\nare but little less distant from those where it is now known that they\r\ngrow, than we are. For to omit others, Herodotus, in other respects a\r\nmost famed author, has said that cinnamon is found in birds’ nests,\r\nto which the birds have brought it from most distant regions, and\r\nspecially the Phœnix, and I know not who has seen his nest. But Pliny,\r\nwho thought himself able to give more certain information, because,\r\nbefore his time, many things had been made clear by the voyages of the\r\nfleets of Alexander the Great and of others, relates that cinnamon\r\ngrows in Æthiopia on the borders of the land of the Troglodytæ, whilst\r\nnow it is known that cinnamon is produced very far from any part of\r\nÆthiopia, and specially from the Troglodytæ (that is, the dwellers in\r\nsubterranean caverns). But our men, who have now returned, and who\r\nwere perfectly acquainted with Æthiopia, have been obliged to make a\r\ncomplete circuit of the world, and that a very wide one, before they\r\ncould find the islands and return. As this voyage may be considered\r\nmarvellous, and not only unaccomplished, but even unattempted either\r\nin our age or in any previous one, I have resolved to write as truly\r\nas possible to your Reverence the course (of the expedition) and the\r\nsequence of the whole matter. I have taken care to have everything\r\nrelated to me most exactly by the captain and by the individual sailors\r\nwho have returned with him. They have also related each separate\r\nevent to Cæsar and to others with such good faith and sincerity,\r\nthat they seemed not only to tell nothing fabulous themselves, but\r\nby their relation to disprove and refute all the fabulous stories\r\nwhich had been told by old authors. For who can believe that these\r\nwere Monosceli, Scyopodæ, Syritæ, Spitamei, Pygmies, and many others,\r\nrather monsters than men. And as so many places beyond the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn have been sought, found, and carefully examined, both by the\r\nSpaniards in the south-west and by the Portuguese sailing eastwards,\r\nand as the remainder of the whole world has now been sailed over by\r\nour countrymen, and yet nothing trustworthy has been heard concerning\r\nthese man-monsters, it must be believed that the accounts of them are\r\nfabulous, lying, and old women’s tales, handed down to us in some way\r\nby no credible author. But lest I, who have to travel over the whole\r\nworld, should seem too diffuse in my introduction, I return to my\r\nstory. When, nearly thirty years ago, the Spaniards in the west, and\r\nthe Portuguese in the east, began to search for new and unknown lands,\r\ntheir two kings, lest one should be a hindrance to the other, divided\r\nthe whole globe between them by the authority, most likely, of Pope\r\nAlexander the Sixth, in this manner: that a straight line should be\r\ndrawn 360 miles, which they call leucæ, west of the islands of the\r\nHesperides, which are now called the islands of Cape Verd; towards\r\nthe north, and another towards the south Pole, till they should meet\r\nagain, and so divide the world into two equal parts. And whatever\r\nstrange land should be discovered eastwards (of this line) should be\r\nceded to the Portuguese, and whatever west of it to the Spaniards. In\r\nthis manner it happened that the Spaniards always sailed south-west,\r\nand there they discovered a very large continent and very great and\r\ninnumerable islands, rich in gold and pearls and in other wealth, and\r\nnow, quite lately, have they discovered the vast Mediterranean city,\r\nTenostica,[438] situated in a lake, like Venice. About this city Peter\r\nMartyr, an author more careful about his facts than the elegance of\r\nhis style, has written many wonderful, and yet true, things. But the\r\nPortuguese, passing southwards by the shores of the Hesperides, and\r\nof the ichthyophagous Æthiopians, and crossing the equinoctial line\r\nand the Tropic of Capricorn, sailed eastward, and discovered many\r\ngreat and unknown islands, and afterwards the sources of the Nile and\r\nthe land of the Troglodytæ. Thence they sailed past the Arabian and\r\nPersian Gulfs to the shores of India, within the Ganges, where there is\r\nnow the mighty emporium and kingdom of Calicut. Thence they sailed to\r\nTaprobanes, which they now call Zamatara. For there is now no island\r\nwhich either can be, or can be supposed to be, Taprobanes, in the\r\nposition in which Ptolemy, Pliny, and the other cosmographers placed\r\nit. Going thence, they arrived at the Golden Chersonesus, where now is\r\nsituated that most famous city of Malacca, the greatest emporium of\r\nthe East. After this they entered the Great Gulf,[439] which reaches\r\nas far as the country of the Sinæ, which they now call Schinæ, where\r\nthey found a white and tolerably civilised people, like our Germans.\r\nThey believe that the Seres and the Asiatic Scythians extend as far as\r\nthere. And though there was a certain rumour afloat that the Portuguese\r\nhad progressed so far to the east as to cross their own limits and\r\nenter the territory of the Spaniards, and that Malacca and the Great\r\nBay were within our limits, still all these things were said rather\r\nthan believed, until four years ago Ferdinand Magellan, a distinguished\r\nPortuguese, who, for many years had explored the coasts of the whole\r\nof the East as Admiral, took a great hatred to his king, whom he\r\ncomplained of as being most ungrateful to him, and came to Cæsar.\r\nChristopher Haro, too, my own father-in-law’s brother, who had traded\r\nfor many years in the East by means of his agents, he himself staying\r\nin Ulyssipone, commonly called Lisbon, and who had lastly traded with\r\nthe Chinese, so that he has great practice in such things, having\r\nalso been unjustly treated by the King of Portugal, came also home to\r\nSpain. And they both showed Cæsar that though it was not yet quite\r\nsure whether Malacca was within the confines of the Spaniards or the\r\nPortuguese, because, as yet, nothing of the longitude had been clearly\r\nproved, yet that it was quite plain that the Great Gulf and the people\r\nof Sinæ lay within the Spanish boundary. This, too, was held to be most\r\ncertain, that the islands which they call the Moluccas, in which all\r\nthe spices are produced, and are thence exported to Malacca, lay within\r\nthe Spanish western division, and that it was possible to sail there;\r\nand that spices could be brought thence to Spain more easily, and at\r\nless expense and cheaper, as they came direct from their native place.\r\n\r\nTheir course would be this, to sail westward, coasting the southern\r\nhemisphere (till they came) to the East. The thing seemed almost\r\nimpossible and useless, not because it was thought a difficult thing to\r\ngo from the west right to the east under the hemisphere, but because\r\nit was uncertain whether ingenious nature, which has done nothing\r\nwithout the greatest foresight, had not so dissevered the east from\r\nthe west, partly by sea and partly by land, as to make it impossible\r\nto arrive there by either land or sea travelling. For it had not then\r\nbeen discovered whether that great region which is called Terra Firma\r\ndid separate the western sea from the eastern; it was clear enough\r\nthat that continent, in its southern part, trended southwards and\r\nafterwards westwards. It was clear, also, that two regions had been\r\ndiscovered in the North, one of which they called Regio Bacalearum\r\n(Cod-fish Land), from a new kind of fish; and the other Terra Florida.\r\nAnd if these two were united to that Terra Firma, it was impossible\r\nto get to the east by going from the west, as nothing had ever been\r\ndiscovered of any channel through this land, though it had been sought\r\nfor most diligently and with great labour. And they considered it a\r\nvery doubtful and most dangerous enterprise to go through the limits\r\nof the Portuguese, and so to the east. For which reason it seemed to\r\nCæsar and to his counsellors that these men were promising a thing from\r\nwhich much was to be hoped, but still of great difficulty. When they\r\nwere both brought to an audience on a certain day, Magellan offered\r\nto go himself, but Christopher offered to fit out a fleet at his own\r\nexpense and that of his friends, but only if it were allowed to sail\r\nunder the authority and protection of Cæsar. Whilst they both persisted\r\nrather obstinately in their offers, Cæsar himself equipped a fleet of\r\nfive ships, and appointed Magellan its admiral. Their orders were, to\r\nsail southwards along the coast of Terra Firma till they found either\r\nits termination or some channel through which they might reach the\r\nspice-bearing Moluccas. So Magellan set sail on the 10th of August,\r\n1519, with five ships from Seville. A few days after he reached the\r\nFortunate Islands, which are now sometimes called the Canaries. Thence\r\nthey arrived at the Islands of the Hesperides,[440] from which they\r\ntook a south-western course towards that continent which we mentioned\r\nbefore; and after some days’ fair sailing they sighted a promontory, to\r\nwhich the name of Santa Maria has been given. Here Juan Ruy Diaz Solis\r\nhad been eaten, with some of his companions, by the anthropophagi, whom\r\nthe Indians call cannibals, whilst, by order of Ferdinand the Catholic,\r\nhe was exploring the coast of this continent with a fleet. Sailing\r\nthence, our men coasted in an unbroken course along the coasts of this\r\ncontinent, which extend a very long way south, and tend a little west,\r\nso that they crossed the Tropic of Capricorn by many degrees. I think\r\nthat this continent should be called that of the Southern Pole. But it\r\nwas not so easy as I have said; for not till the last day of March of\r\nthe following year did they reach a bay, to which they gave the name\r\nof Saint Julian. Here they found the Antarctic Pole star 49⅕ degrees\r\nabove their horizon, both by the altitude and declination of the sun\r\nfrom the Equinoctial, and also by the altitude of the Antarctic (Pole\r\nstar) itself. This star our sailors generally make use of more than\r\nof any other. They state also that the longitude was 56 deg. west of\r\nthe Fortunate Isles. For, as the ancient cosmographers, and specially\r\nPtolemy, reckoned the longitude from the Fortunate Islands eastward\r\nto Catigara at 180 deg., so our men, sailing as far as they could\r\nwestward also, began to reckon another 180 deg. westward to Catigara,\r\nas was right. Yet our sailors seem to me rather to be mistaken in the\r\ncalculation of the longitudes (of distances?) than to have fixed them\r\nwith any certainty, because in so long a voyage, and being so distant\r\nfrom the land, they cannot fix and determine any marks or signs for the\r\nlongitude. Still I think that these accounts, whatever they be, should\r\nnot be cast aside, but rather accepted till more certain information be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThis Gulf of Saint Julian seemed very great, and had the appearance\r\nof a channel. Wherefore Admiral Magellan ordered two ships to explore\r\nthe Gulf and anchored the rest outside. After two days, information was\r\nbrought to him that the Gulf was full of shoals, and did not extend\r\nfar inland. Our men, on their way back, saw some Indians picking up\r\nshell-fish on the shore; for they call the natives of all unknown lands\r\nIndians. They were of extraordinary height, that is to say, about ten\r\nspans, were clothed in the skins of wild beasts, and seemed darker than\r\nwould be expected from the situation of the country. When some of our\r\nmen went on shore to them and showed them bells and pictures painted on\r\npaper, they began a hoarse chant and an unintelligible song, dancing\r\nround our men, and, in order to astonish them, they passed arrows\r\na cubit and a half long down their throats to the bottom of their\r\nstomachs, and without being sick. And forthwith drawing them out again,\r\nthey seemed to rejoice greatly, as having shown their bravery by this\r\nexploit.\r\n\r\nAt last three came as ambassadors, and prayed our men, by certain\r\nsigns, to go further inland with them, as if they would receive them\r\nwith all hospitality. Magellan sent seven men, well armed, with them,\r\nto investigate as carefully as possible both country and people. When\r\nthey had gone with them about seven miles inland, they came to a thick\r\nand pathless wood.\r\n\r\nHere was a rather low hut, covered with skins of wild beasts. There\r\nwere two apartments in it; in one lived the women with their children,\r\nin the other the men. There were thirteen women and children, and\r\nfive men. These received their guests with a (ferali apparatu[441])\r\nbarbarous pomp, which seemed to them a royal one. An animal was\r\nslaughtered, which seemed to differ little from the onager, and they\r\nserved it up half roasted to our men, without any other food or drink.\r\nOur men were obliged, contrary to their custom, to sleep under skins,\r\non account of the severity of the snow and wind. Wherefore, before they\r\nslept, they set watch. The Indians did the same, and lay down near our\r\nmen, snoring horribly.\r\n\r\nWhen the day had broken, our men asked them to return with them to\r\nthe ships, with the whole family. When the Indians had refused for a\r\nconsiderable time, and our men had insisted upon it rather imperiously,\r\nthe men entered the den-like[442] women’s apartment. The Spaniards\r\nthought that they were consulting with their wives concerning this\r\nexpedition; but they returned covered, from the sole of their feet to\r\nthe crown of their heads, with different horrible skins, and with their\r\nfaces painted in different colours, and equipped in this terrible and\r\nhorrible garb with bows and arrows for battle, and (seemingly?) of\r\nmuch greater stature than before. The Spaniards, who thought that it\r\nwould come to a fight, ordered (a shot) to be fired. Though this shot\r\nwas harmless, still the giants, who looked just before fit to contend\r\nwith Jove, were so frightened by this sound, that they began forthwith\r\nto speak of peace. The upshot was, that three men returned with our\r\nfellows to the ships, having sent away the rest of the family. So they\r\nstarted for the ships. But, as our men could not only not keep up with\r\nthese almost giants when the latter were running, but could not, even\r\nby running, keep up with them walking, two of them escaped upon the\r\nmarch, on the pretext of pursuing an onager, which they saw feeding\r\nat a distance upon a mountain. The third was brought to the ship,\r\nbut died, within a few days, of fasting, which he had imposed upon\r\nhimself, according to the habit of the Indians, through homesickness.\r\nAnd though the admiral sent again to that hut, in order to catch some\r\none of these giants to take to Cæsar on account of their novelty,\r\nyet no one was found there, but all had gone elsewhere with the hut.\r\nWhence it seems clear that that race is a wandering one, nor did our\r\nmen ever see another Indian on that coast, though they remained in\r\nthat bay for many days, as we shall mention farther on. They did not\r\nthink that there was anything in that region of sufficient importance\r\nto justify their exploring it and the interior any farther. Though\r\nMagellan perceived that any longer stay there was useless, yet, as the\r\nsea for several days was stormy and the sky threatening, and the land\r\nstretched continuously southwards, so that the farther they went the\r\ncolder they would find that region, his departure was necessarily put\r\noff from day to day, till the month of May was close upon them, from\r\nwhich time the winter there begins to be most severe, so that it became\r\nnecessary to winter at the very time when we have our summer. Magellan\r\nforeseeing that the voyage would be a long one, ordered provisions\r\nto be served out more sparingly among his crews, so that the stock\r\nmight last longer. When the Spaniards had borne this patiently for\r\nsome days, fearing the severity of the winter and the barrenness of\r\nthe country, they at last petitioned their admiral, Magellan, that, as\r\nhe saw that the land stretched uninterruptedly to the south, and that\r\nno hope remained of its terminating or of the discovery of a strait\r\nthrough it, and that a severe winter was imminent, and that many of\r\nthem were dead of starvation and hardships; and declared that they\r\ncould no longer bear the rule which he had made about the allowance\r\nof provisions (lex sumptuaria), and begged that he would increase\r\nthe allowance of provisions, and think about going home; that Cæsar\r\nnever intended that they should too obstinately attempt what nature\r\nitself and other obstacles opposed; that their exertions were already\r\nsufficiently known and approved of,—for they had gone farther than\r\neither the boldness or rashness of mortals had ever dared to go as yet;\r\nand that they could easily reach some milder shore, if they were to\r\nsail south (north?) for a few days, a south wind being then blowing.\r\nBut in reply, Magellan, who had already made up his mind either to die\r\nor to complete his enterprise, said that his course had been laid down\r\nfor him by Cæsar himself, and that he neither could nor would depart\r\nfrom it in any degree, and that he would in consequence sail till he\r\nfound either the end of the land or some strait (through it).\r\n\r\nThat though they could not at present succeed whilst winter was against\r\nthem, yet that it would be easy in the summer of that region. But that,\r\nif they would continue towards the Antarctic portion of this country,\r\nthe whole of its summer would be one perpetual day. That there were\r\nmeans if they would only try them, by which they might avoid famine and\r\nthe rigour of the winter, inasmuch as there was abundance of wood, and\r\nthe sea provided shell-fish and many sorts of the very best fish. The\r\nsprings there were wholesome, and birdfowling and hunting would supply\r\nmany wants; and neither bread nor wine had as yet been lacking, nor\r\nwould they lack in future if they would only bear that they should be\r\nserved out when needed, or for health’s sake, and not for pleasure or\r\nfor luxury. They had done nothing as yet worthy of admiration, or which\r\ncould serve as an excuse for their return, inasmuch as the Portuguese\r\ncrossed the tropic of Capricorn by as much as 12 deg. not only every\r\nyear, but almost every day, when they were sailing eastwards. They\r\nwould be thought worthy of very little praise who had gone only 4 deg.\r\nsouthwards. He had certainly made up his mind to endure the worst\r\nrather than return ignominiously to Spain, and he trusted that all his\r\ncomrades, or at least those in whom the noble Spanish spirit was not\r\nyet dead, would be of the same mind.\r\n\r\nHe advised them to bear at least the remainder of the winter\r\npatiently, and said that their rewards would be the more abundant the\r\nmore difficulties and dangers they had endured in opening to Cæsar\r\na new unknown world, rich in spices and gold. Magellan thought that\r\nthe minds of his crews were soothed and cheered by this harangue, but\r\nwithin a few days was harassed by a shameful and foul conspiracy.\r\nFor talking began amongst the crews about the old eternal hatred\r\nbetween the Portuguese and the Spaniards, and about Magellan’s being\r\na Portuguese. He, they said, could do nothing more glorious for his\r\nown country than to cast away this fleet, with so many men. Nor was it\r\ncredible that he should wish to discover the Moluccas, even if he were\r\nable; but he would think it sufficient if he could hire Cæsar on for\r\nsome years with a vain hope, and meanwhile something new would turn up,\r\nby which the Spaniards would for the future be diverted from the search\r\nfor spices. Nor even had their course begun to turn towards those happy\r\nMoluccas, but rather to distant snows and ice, and to perpetual storms.\r\n\r\nMagellan, very much enraged by these sayings, punished the men, but\r\nrather more harshly than was proper for a foreigner, especially when\r\ncommanding in a distant country. So, having planned a conspiracy, they\r\nseize upon a ship, and make ready to return to Spain. But he, with the\r\nrest whom he had still obedient to his commands, attacked that ship,\r\nand put to death the head man and the other ringleaders, those even\r\nwho could not lawfully be so treated sharing the same fate. For these\r\nwere certain servants of the king, upon whom no one but Cæsar and his\r\nCouncil could lawfully pronounce a sentence of death. Nevertheless,\r\nno one from that time dared to disparage the power of the commander.\r\nStill, there were not wanting some who whispered that Magellan would,\r\nin the same manner, murder all the Spaniards to the last man, until he,\r\nhaving got rid of them all, might return with the few Portuguese with\r\nthe fleet to his own country. And so this hatred settled more deeply in\r\nthe hearts of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever Magellan saw the storminess of the sea and the rigour\r\nof the winter mitigated, he set sail from the gulf of St. Julian on the\r\n24th of August. And, as before, he followed the course of the coast\r\nsouthwards for many days. A promontory was at last sighted, which\r\nthey called Santa Cruz, when a severe storm, springing from the east,\r\nsuddenly caught them, and one of the five ships was cast on shore, the\r\nmen being all saved, with the merchandise and equipment, except one\r\nEthiopian slave, who was caught and drowned by the waves. After this\r\nthe land seemed to bear a little east and south, and this they began\r\nto coast along as usual, and on the 26th of November certain inlets\r\nof the sea were discovered, which had the appearance of a strait.\r\nMagellan entered them forthwith with the whole fleet, and when he saw\r\nother and again other bays, he gave orders that they should be all\r\ncarefully examined from the ships, to see if anywhere a passage might\r\nbe discovered; and said that he would himself wait at the mouth of the\r\nstrait till the fifth day, to hear what might happen.\r\n\r\nOne of the ships, which Alvarus Meschito, his nephew, commanded, was\r\ncarried back by the tide to the sea, to the very place where they\r\nentered the gulf. But when the Spaniards perceived that they were\r\nfar away from the other ships, they made a plot to return home, put\r\nAlvarus, their captain, in irons, bent their course northwards, and\r\nwere at last carried to the coast of Æthiopia (Guinea), and, having\r\nvictualled there, they reached Spain eight months after they had\r\ndeserted the rest. There they compel Alvarus to stand his trial in\r\nchains (causam ex vinculis dicere faciunt quasi), for having, by\r\nhis counsel and advice, induced his uncle Magellan to practise such\r\nharshness on the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nBut when Magellan had waited for this ship some days longer than the\r\ntime fixed, another returned, which had discovered nothing but a bay\r\nfull of shoals and shingle, and very lofty cliffs. The third ship,\r\nhowever, reported that the largest bay had the appearance of a strait,\r\nas in three days’ sail they had found no way out; but the farther they\r\nhad gone the narrower the sea was, and they had not been able to sound\r\nthe depth of it in many places by any length of line, and that they had\r\nalso noticed that the tide was rather stronger than the ebb, and that\r\nso they were persuaded that a passage was open in that direction to\r\nsome other sea. He made up his mind to sail through it. This channel,\r\nwhich they did not then know to be a channel, was at one place three\r\nItalian miles wide, at another two, sometimes ten, and sometimes five,\r\nand pointed a little westward. The altitude of the southern pole was\r\nfound to be 52 deg., and the longitude to be the same, as at St.\r\nJulian’s Bay. The month of November was upon them (Aderat jam mensis\r\nNovembris), the night was rather more than five hours long, and they\r\nhad never seen any human beings on the shore.\r\n\r\nBut one night a great number of fires were seen, mostly on their left\r\nhand, from which they guessed that they had been seen by the natives\r\nof the region. But Magellan, seeing that the country was rocky, and\r\nalso stark with eternal cold, thought it useless to waste many days in\r\nexamining it; and so, with only three ships, he continued on his course\r\nalong the channel, until, on the twenty-second day after he had entered\r\nit, he sailed out upon another wide and vast sea. The length of the\r\nchannel they attest to be nearly a hundred Spanish miles.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the land which they had upon their right was the\r\ncontinent of which we have spoken, but they think that the land on the\r\nleft was not a mainland, but islands, because sometimes on that side\r\nthey heard on a still farther coast the beating and roaring of the sea.\r\n\r\nMagellan saw that the continent stretched northwards again in a\r\nstraight line; wherefore, leaving that huge continent on the right\r\nhand, he ordered them to sail through that vast and mighty sea (which\r\nI do not think had ever seen either our or any one else’s ships) in\r\nthe direction whence the wind called Corus[443] generally blows—that\r\nis, ’twixt north and west—so that he might, by going through west to\r\neast, again arrive at the torrid zone; for he thought that it was\r\nproved sufficiently clearly that the Moluccas were in the most remote\r\neast, and could not be far from the equator. They kept this course\r\nuninterruptedly, nor did they ever depart from it, except when rough\r\nweather or violent winds compelled them to diverge; and when they had\r\nin this manner been carried for forty days by a strong and generally\r\nfavourable wind, and had seen nothing but sea, and everywhere sea—when\r\nthey had almost reached the tropic of Capricorn once more, two islands\r\nwere sighted, but small and barren. These they found uninhabited when\r\nthey tried to land; still, they stopped there two days for their\r\nhealth’s sake, and general recruiting of their bodies, for there was\r\nvery fair fishing there. They named these the Unfortunate Islands\r\nby common consent. Then they again set sail thence, following their\r\noriginal course and direction of sailing. And when, for three months\r\nand twenty days, they had been sailing over this ocean with great good\r\nfortune, and had traversed an immense part of the sea—more vast than\r\nmind of man can conceive, for they had been driven almost continuously\r\nby a very strong wind—they were now at last arrived on this side of\r\nthe equinoctial line, and at last they saw an island, called, as they\r\nlearnt afterwards, Inuagana by the natives. When they had approached\r\nnearer, they discovered the altitude of the Arctic pole to be 11 deg.\r\nThe longitude they thought to be 158 deg. west of Gades. Then they\r\nsaw other and still more islands, so that they knew they had arrived\r\nat some vast archipelago. When they reached Inuagana, the island was\r\ndiscovered to be uninhabited. They then approached a rather small\r\nisland, where they saw two Indian canoes—for that is the name by which\r\nthis strange kind of boat is called by the Indians. The canoes are cut\r\nand hollowed out of a single trunk of a tree, and hold one, or, at\r\nmost, two men; and they usually speak by gestures and signs, as if the\r\ndumb were talking with the dumb.\r\n\r\nThey asked the Indians the names of the islands, and where they could\r\nget provisions, of which they were in great want. They understood that\r\nthe island in which they had been was called Inuagana, and that the\r\none where they now were was Acaca, but both of them uninhabited. They\r\nsaid that there was an island not far off, which was called Selani, and\r\nwhich they almost showed with their finger, and that it was inhabited,\r\nand that an abundance of everything necessary for life was to be found\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOur men, having taken in water in Acaca, sailed towards Selani; here\r\na storm took them, so that they could not bring the ships to that\r\nisland, but were driven to another island called Massaua, where lives a\r\nking of (the?) three islands, after that they arrived at Subuth. This\r\nis an excellent and large island, and, having made a treaty with its\r\nchieftain, they landed immediately to perform divine service, according\r\nto the manner of Christians, for it was the feast of the resurrection\r\nof Him who was our salvation. Wherefore they built a small chapel of\r\nthe sails of the ships, and of boughs, and in that they built an altar\r\naccording to the Christian rites, and performed service after their\r\nhome fashion. The chieftain came up with a great number of Indians, who\r\nseemed in every way delighted by this worship of the gods. They led the\r\nadmiral and some of the officers to the chief’s hut, and put before\r\nthem whatever food they had. Their bread, which they call sago, was\r\nmade of the trunk or wood of a tree, rather like a palm. This, when cut\r\nin pieces, and fried in oil in a pan, supplies them with bread, a small\r\npiece of which I send to your reverence. Their drink was a liquor which\r\nflows and trickles from the boughs of the palm-trees when cut. Fowling,\r\ntoo, supplied the feast, and the rest was the fruit of that region.\r\n\r\nMagellan beheld, in the chief’s hut, one sick, and almost at the last\r\ngasp. He asked who he was, and what illness he was suffering from. He\r\nlearnt that he was the chief’s grandson, and had now suffered for two\r\nyears from a raging fever. But he told him to be of good cheer, and\r\nthat he would immediately recover his health and former strength, if he\r\nwould only become a Christian. The Indian accepted the condition, and,\r\nhaving adored the Cross, he received baptism, and the next day declared\r\nthat he was well, rose from his bed, walked, and took food like the\r\nrest. He told I know not what visions to the Indians. What need I say\r\nmore? The chief himself, with two thousand two hundred Indians, was\r\nbaptized, and professed the name and religion of Christ. But Magellan,\r\njudging this island to abound in gold and ginger, and, besides, to be\r\nconvenient from its position with respect to the neighbouring islands,\r\nfor exploring with ease their wealth and produce of the earth, goes to\r\nthe Chief of Subuth, and persuades him that as he had abandoned that\r\nvain and impious worship of the gods, and had turned to the religion\r\nof Christ, it was only fair that the kings of the neighbouring isles\r\nshould be subject to his rule and command; and he said that he had\r\nresolved to send ambassadors concerning this, and compel by arms those\r\nwho did not listen to his command.\r\n\r\nThis proposition pleased the savage, and the ambassadors were sent.\r\nThe chiefs came in one by one, and did homage. The nearest island was\r\ncalled Mauthan, the king of which excelled the others in number of\r\nsoldiers and in arms, and he refused to do homage to one whom he had\r\nbeen accustomed for so long to command.\r\n\r\nMagellan, who desired to finish what he had once begun, gave orders\r\nthat forty of his men, whose bravery and prowess he had proved, should\r\narm, and he crossed over to Mauthan in boats, for the island was very\r\nnear. The Chief of Subuth added some of his own men to show him the\r\nsituation of the island, and to fight, if matters came to that. The\r\nKing of Mauthan, seeing our men coming, draws up about three thousand\r\nof his subjects in the field, and Magellan draws up his on the shore,\r\nwith their guns and warlike engines, though only a few; and though he\r\nsaw that he was far inferior to the enemy in number, yet he thought it\r\nbetter to fight this warlike race, which made use of lances and other\r\nlong weapons, than either to return or to use the soldiers from Subuth.\r\nSo he orders his men to be of good cheer and brave hearts, and not to\r\nbe alarmed at the number of the enemy, for they had often seen, as\r\nformerly, so in quite recent times, two hundred Spaniards in the island\r\nof Yucatan put sometimes two or three hundred thousand men to flight.\r\nBut he pointed out to the Subuth islanders that he had brought them,\r\nnot to fight, but to watch their bravery and fighting power (robur in\r\nacie). So, having charged the enemy, both sides fought valiantly: but,\r\nas the enemy were more numerous, and used longer weapons, with which\r\nthey did our men much damage, Magellan himself was at last thrust\r\nthrough and slain. But the rest of our men, though they did not seem\r\nquite conquered, yet retreated, having lost their leader. And the enemy\r\ndared not follow them, as they were retreating in good order.\r\n\r\nSo the Spaniards, having lost their admiral, Magellan, and seven of\r\ntheir comrades, returned to Subuth, where they chose another commander,\r\nJohn Serrano, a man not to be despised. He immediately renewed with\r\nfresh gifts the alliance that had been made with the King of Subuth,\r\nand promised to subdue the King of Mauthan.\r\n\r\nMagellan had a slave, born in the Moluccas, whom he had bought in\r\nMalacca some time back; this man was a perfect master of the Spanish\r\nlanguage, and, with the assistance of one of the islanders of Subuth\r\nas interpreter, who knew the language of the Moluccas, our men managed\r\nall their communications. This slave had been present at the battle of\r\nMauthan, and had received some slight wounds in it. For which reason\r\nhe lay all day long nursing himself. Serrano, who could manage nothing\r\nwithout him, spoke to him very harshly, and told him that he had not\r\nceased to be a slave and bondsman because Magellan was dead, but that\r\nthe yoke of slavery would be heavier, and that he would be severely\r\nflogged unless he did the services required of him more zealously.\r\n\r\nThis slave conceived an intense hatred of us from these words; but,\r\nconcealing his anger, he went a few days after to the Chief of Subuth,\r\nand told him that the greed of the Spaniards was insatiable, that they\r\nhad resolved and determined, after they had conquered the King of\r\nMauthan, to make a quarrel with him and take him away prisoner, and\r\nthere was no other remedy possible than to anticipate their treachery\r\nby treachery. The savage believed it all. He made peace secretly with\r\nthe King of Mauthan and the others, and they plotted our destruction.\r\nSerrano, the commander, with all the rest of his officers, who were\r\nabout twenty-seven in number, were invited to a solemn banquet. They,\r\nsuspecting no evil—for the savages had cunningly dissimulated in\r\neverything—land, careless and unsuspecting, as men who were going to\r\ndine with the chief would do. Whilst they were feasting they were set\r\nupon by those who had been placed in ambush. Shouts were raised on all\r\nsides, and news flew to the ships that our men were murdered, and that\r\neverything on the island was hostile to us. Our men see from the ships\r\nthat the beautiful cross which they had hoisted on a tree was hurled to\r\nthe ground, and kicked to pieces by the savages with great fury. But\r\nthe remaining Spaniards, who had stopped on board, when they knew of\r\ntheir comrades’ murder, feared some still greater treachery. Wherefore,\r\nwhen they had weighed anchor, they begin to set sail quickly. Shortly\r\nafter, Serrano was brought down to the shore bound most cruelly, and\r\nhe begged them to redeem him from so harsh a captivity. He said he had\r\nprevailed upon them to permit his being ransomed, if our men would only\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nThough our men thought it shameful to leave their commander in\r\nthis way, yet, fearing fraud and treachery, they put out to sea,\r\nleaving Serrano on the shore, weeping bitterly, and imploring the\r\nhelp and assistance of his fellow-countrymen with great and grievous\r\nlamentation. The Spaniards sailed along, sad and anxious, having lost\r\ntheir commander and their shipmates, not only alarmed by their loss and\r\nby the slaughter of their mates, but because their number was reduced\r\nso low that it was quite insufficient for the management of three\r\nships. Wherefore they hold a council, and, having taken the votes, they\r\nagree that there was nothing better to do than to burn some one of the\r\nthree ships, and keep only two.\r\n\r\nSo they go to an island near, Cohol[444] by name, and transfer the\r\nequipment to the other two ships, and burn the third. Then they sailed\r\nto the island called Gibeth. Though they found that it was rich in\r\ngold and ginger and many other things, yet they thought it better not\r\nto stay there long, because they could not, by any kindness, attract\r\nthe Indians to them. And their scantiness of number prevented their\r\nfighting. Thence they went to the island Porne (Borneo). There are two\r\ngreat and rich islands in this archipelago, one of which was called\r\nSiloli, the king of which had six hundred children; and the other Porne.\r\n\r\nSiloli was greater than the one called Porne. For it takes nearly\r\nsix months to sail round it, but Porne only three. But just so much\r\nas the former is larger, so much is the latter better situated as\r\nregards fertility of soil, and more famed also for the size of a city\r\nof the same name as itself. And, as Porne must be considered of more\r\nimportance than any of the other islands which they had examined, and\r\nseemed to be the source whence the others received their good customs\r\nand civilization (cultum vitæ), I have resolved to touch, in a few\r\nwords, upon the customs and laws of these peoples. All these islanders\r\nare Caphræ, that is, heathen, and worship the sun and moon. They\r\nascribe the rule of the day to the sun, but that of the night to the\r\nmoon; the former they call male, and the latter female; and them, too,\r\nthey call the parents of the stars, which they deem to be all gods,\r\nthough small ones. They salute the rising sun with certain hymns before\r\nthey worship it. This they do also to the moon, when it shines at\r\nnight, to whom they pray for children, and fruitful increase of cattle,\r\nand abundant fruits of the earth, and other things of that sort.\r\n\r\nBut they practise justice and piety, and specially do they love peace\r\nand quiet, but war they greatly detest, and they honour their king as\r\na god whilst he is bent upon peace. But if he be too desirous of war,\r\nthey rest not till he has fallen by the hand of the enemy in battle.\r\nWhenever he has determined to wage war, which is rarely done, he is\r\nplaced by his subjects in the vanguard, where he is compelled to bear\r\nthe whole onslaught of the enemy. Nor do they fight against the enemy\r\nwith any spirit until they know that their king is dead; then, first do\r\nthey begin to fight for their liberty and for their future king, nor\r\nhas there ever been seen among them a king who began a war who has not\r\ndied in battle. Wherefore they rarely wage war, and think it unjust to\r\nextend their territories; but the special care of all is not wantonly\r\nto attack either the neighbouring or the distant peoples. But if at any\r\ntime they are attacked, they meet force by force (par pari referunt).\r\nBut lest the mischief should spread farther they look immediately to\r\nmaking peace. There can be nothing more honourable among them than\r\nto be the first to ask for peace, nor more disgraceful than to be\r\nanticipated in asking for it, and they think it shameful and hateful to\r\nrefuse it to anyone, even if he had attacked them without provocation.\r\nAnd all the neighbouring people unite against the one (who refuses\r\npeace) for his destruction, as against a cruel and impious man. Whence\r\nit happens that they almost always enjoy quiet and repose. There is no\r\nrobbery among them, and no murder. No one but his wives and children\r\nmay speak to the king, except by means of canes, which they place to\r\nhis ear from a distance, and whisper what they wish through them. They\r\nsay that man, after his death, has no feeling, as he had none before\r\nhis birth. They have small houses, built of logs and of earth, partly\r\nroofed with rubble, and partly with palm leaves. [Ædes habent exiles ex\r\nlignis & terra constructas, partim rudere, partim palmatis frondibus\r\ncoopertas.] It is, though, quite certain that in Porne there are twenty\r\nthousand houses. They marry as many wives as they can afford, and live\r\non food, which bird-fowling or fishing supplies them with. They make\r\nbread of rice, and a drink which drops from the severed branches of the\r\npalm, as we said before.\r\n\r\nSome carry on traffic in the neighbouring islands, to which they go\r\nin junks; some devote themselves to hunting; some to fishing; and\r\nothers to agriculture. They have dresses of cotton, and almost all the\r\nanimals that we have, except the sheep, the ox, and the ass; but their\r\nhorses are very small and feeble. The produce of camphor, of ginger,\r\nand of cinnamon, is great among them. Thence our men, having saluted\r\nthis king, and heaped him with presents, directed their course to the\r\nMoluccas, which had been pointed out to them by the same king. They\r\ncame to the shores of the island of Solo, where they heard that there\r\nwere pearls as big as dove’s eggs, and sometimes as hen’s eggs, but\r\nwhich can only be fished up from the very deepest sea. Our men brought\r\nno large pearl, because the season of the year did not allow of the\r\nfishery. But they testify that they had taken an oyster in that region,\r\nthe flesh of which weighed forty-seven pounds. For which reason I could\r\neasily believe that pearls of that great size are found there; for it\r\nis clearly proved that pearls are the product of shell-fish. And to\r\nomit nothing, our men constantly affirm that the islanders of Porne\r\ntold them that the king wore in his crown two pearls of the size of a\r\ngoose’s egg. Hence they went to the island of Gilo, where they saw men\r\nwith ears so long and pendulous, that they reached to their shoulders.\r\nWhen our men were mightily astonished at this, they learnt from the\r\nnatives that there was another island not far off where the men had\r\nears not only pendulous, but so long and broad, that one of them would\r\ncover the whole head, if they wanted it (cum ex usu esset). But our\r\nmen, who sought not monsters but spices, neglecting this nonsense, went\r\nstraight to the Moluccas, and they discovered them eight months after\r\ntheir admiral, Magellan, had fallen in Mauthan. The islands are five in\r\nnumber, and are called Tarante, Muthil, Thidore, Mare, and Matthien:\r\nsome on this side, some on the other, and some upon the equinoctial\r\nline.\r\n\r\nOne produces cloves, another nutmegs, and another cinnamon. All are\r\nnear to each other, but small and rather narrow.\r\n\r\nThe kings (of?) Marmin began to believe that souls were immortal a\r\nfew years ago, induced by no other argument than that they saw that\r\na certain most beautiful small bird never rested upon the ground nor\r\nupon anything that grew upon it; but they sometimes saw it fall dead\r\nupon the ground from the sky. And as the Mahometans, who travelled to\r\nthose parts for commercial purposes, told them that this bird was born\r\nin Paradise, and that Paradise was the abode of the souls of those who\r\nhad died, these kings (reguli) embraced the sect of Mahomet, because\r\nit promised wonderful things concerning this abode of souls. But they\r\ncall the bird Mamuco Diata, and they hold it in such reverence and\r\nreligious esteem, that they believe that by it their kings are safe\r\nin war, even though they, according to custom, are placed in the fore\r\nfront of battle. The common folk are Caphræ, and of almost the same\r\nmanners and laws as the islanders of Porne; they are rather poor, as\r\nwould be likely with people in whose land nothing grows except spices.\r\nThese they willingly barter for poisons, namely, arsenic and what is\r\ncommonly called sublimate of mercury, and for linens, in which they\r\ngenerally are dressed; but for what purpose they use these poisons,\r\nwe have not yet found out. They live on sago bread and fish, and\r\nsometimes on parrots, and they shelter in low huts. What need of many\r\nwords. Everything there is humble, and of no value, but peace, quiet,\r\nand spices. The best and noblest of which, and the greatest good\r\npossible, namely, peace, seems to have been driven by men’s wickedness\r\nfrom our world to theirs. But avarice and the insatiable greed of the\r\nbelly, have driven us to seek for spices in their unknown world. (Adeo\r\nhominum protervia salubria quaeque haud longius satis nequet protudere\r\nneque quæ luxus et libidinis appetere.) But, our men having carefully\r\ninspected the position of the Moluccas and of each separate island, and\r\nalso having inquired about the habits of the kings, went to Thedori,\r\nbecause they learnt that in that island the supply of cloves was far\r\nabove that of the others, and that its king also surpassed the other\r\nkings in wisdom and humanity. So, having prepared their gifts, they\r\nland, and salute the king, and they offer the presents as if they had\r\nbeen sent by Cæsar. He, having received the presents kindly, looks up\r\nto heaven, and says: “I have known now for two years from the course of\r\nthe stars, that you were coming to seek these lands, sent by the most\r\nmighty King of Kings. Wherefore your coming is the more pleasant and\r\ngrateful to me, as I had been forewarned of it by the signification of\r\nthe stars.”\r\n\r\nAnd, as I know that nothing ever happens to any man which has not been\r\nfixed long before by the decree of fate and the stars, I will not be\r\nthe one to attempt to withstand either the fates or the signification\r\nof the stars, but willingly and of good cheer, will henceforth\r\nlay aside the royal pomp and will consider myself as managing the\r\nadministration of this island only in the name of your king. Wherefore\r\ndraw your ships into port, and order the rest of your comrades to land;\r\nso that now at last, after such a long tossing upon the seas, and so\r\nmany dangers, you may enjoy the pleasures of the land and refresh your\r\nbodies. And think not but that you have arrived at your king’s kingdom.\r\nHaving said this, the king, laying aside his crown, embraced them one\r\nby one, and ordered whatever food that land afforded to be brought.\r\nOur men being overjoyed at this, returned to their comrades, and told\r\nthem what had happened. They, pleased above measure with the friendly\r\nbehaviour and kindness of the king, take possession of the island.\r\nAnd when their health was completely restored, in a few days, by the\r\nking’s munificence, they send envoys to the other kings, to examine\r\nthe wealth of the islands, and to conciliate the other kings. Tarante\r\nwas the nearest, and also the smallest, of the islands; for it has a\r\ncircumference of a little more than six Italian miles. Mathien is next\r\nto it, and it, too, is small. These three produce a great quantity of\r\ncloves, but more every fourth year than the other three. These trees\r\nonly grow on steep rocks, and that so thickly as frequently to form a\r\ngrove. This tree is very like a laurel (or bay tree) in leaf, closeness\r\nof growth, and height; and the gariophile which they call clove from\r\nits likeness (to a nail, clavus) grows on the tip of each separate\r\ntwig. First a bud, and then a flower, just like the orange flower is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe pointed part of the clove is fixed at the extreme end of the\r\nbranch, and then growing slightly longer, it forms a spike. It is at\r\nfirst red, but soon gets black by the heat of the sun. The natives keep\r\nthe plantations of these trees separate, as we do our vines. They bury\r\nthe cloves in pits till they are taken away by the traders.\r\n\r\nMuthil, the fourth island, is not larger than the rest, and it\r\nproduces cinnamon. The tree is full of shoots, and in other respects\r\nbarren; it delights in dryness, and is very like the tree which bears\r\npomegranates. The bark of this splits under the influence of the sun’s\r\nheat, and is stripped off the wood; and, after drying a little in the\r\nsun, it is cinnamon. Near to this is another island, called Bada,[445]\r\nlarger and more ample than the Moluccas. In this grows the nutmeg, the\r\ntree of which is tall and spreading, and is rather like the walnut\r\ntree, and its nut, too, grows like the walnut; for it is protected\r\nby a double husk, at first like a furry calix, and under this a thin\r\nmembrane, which embraces the nut like network. This is called the\r\nMuscat flower with us, but by the Spaniards mace, and is a noble and\r\nwholesome spice. The other covering is a woody shell, like that of\r\nhazel-nut, and in that, as we have already said, is the nutmeg. Ginger\r\ngrows here and there in each of the islands of the archipelago. It\r\nsometimes grows by sowing, and sometimes spontaneously; but that which\r\nis sown is the more valuable. Its grass is like that of the saffron,\r\nand its root is almost the same too, and that is ginger. Our men were\r\nkindly treated by the chiefs in turn, and they, too, submitted freely\r\nto the rule of Cæsar, like the King of Thidori. But the Spaniards, who\r\nhad but two ships, resolved to bring some of each (spice) home, but to\r\nload the ships with cloves, because the crop of that was most abundant\r\nthat year, and our ships could contain a greater quantity of this kind\r\nof spice. Having, therefore, loaded the ships with cloves, and having\r\nreceived letters and presents for Cæsar from the kings, they make ready\r\nfor their departure. The letters were full of submission and respect.\r\nThe gifts were Indian swords, and things of that sort. But, best of\r\nall, the Mamuco Diata; that is, the Bird of God, by which they believe\r\nthemselves to be safe and invincible in battle. Of which five were\r\nsent, and one I obtained from the captain (con gran prieghi), which\r\nI send to your reverence, not that your reverence may think yourself\r\nsafe from treachery and the sword by means of it, as they profess to\r\ndo, but that you may be pleased by its rareness and beauty. I send also\r\nsome cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves, to show that our spices are not\r\nonly not worse, but more valuable than those which the Venetians and\r\nPortuguese bring, because they are fresher. When our men had set sail\r\nfrom Thedori, one of the ships, and that the larger one, having sprung\r\na leak, began to make water, so that it became necessary to put back\r\nto Thedori. When the Spaniards saw that this mischief could not be\r\nremedied without great labour and much time, they agreed that the other\r\nship should sail to the Cape of Cattigara, and afterwards through the\r\ndeep as far as possible from the coast of India, lest it should be seen\r\nby the Portuguese, and until they saw the Promontory of Africa, which\r\nprojects beyond the Tropic of Capricorn, and to which the Portuguese\r\nhave given the name of Good Hope; and from that point the passage to\r\nSpain would be easy. But as soon as the other ship was refitted, it\r\nshould direct its course through the archipelago, and that vast ocean\r\ntowards the shores of the continent which we mentioned before, till it\r\nfound that coast which was in the neighbourhood of Darien, and where\r\nthe southern sea was separated from the western, in which are the\r\nSpanish Islands, by a very narrow space of land. So the ship sailed\r\nagain from Thedori, and, having gone twelve degrees on the other side\r\nof the equinoctial line, they did not find the Cape of Cattigara, which\r\nPtolemy supposed to extend even beyond the equinoctial line; but when\r\nthey had traversed an immense space of sea, they came to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and afterwards to the Islands of the Hesperides. And, as\r\nthis ship let in water, being much knocked about by this long voyage,\r\nthe sailors, many of whom had died by hardships by land and by sea,\r\ncould not clear the ship of the water. Wherefore they landed upon one\r\nof the islands, which is named after Saint James, to buy slaves. But\r\nas our men had no money, they offered, sailor fashion, cloves for the\r\nslaves. This matter having come to the ears of the Portuguese who were\r\nin command of the island, thirteen of our men were thrown into prison.\r\nThe rest were eighteen in number. Frightened by the strangeness of this\r\nbehaviour, they started straight for Spain, leaving their shipmates\r\nbehind them. And so, in the sixteenth month after leaving Thedori, they\r\narrived safe and sound on the sixth of September, at the port near\r\nHispalis (Seville). Worthier, indeed, are our sailors of eternal fame\r\nthan the Argonauts who sailed with Jason to Colchis. And much more\r\nworthy was their ship of being placed among the stars than that old\r\nArgo; for that only sailed from Greece through Pontus, but ours from\r\nHispalis to the south; and after that, through the whole west and the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, penetrating into the east, and again returned to\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nI commend myself most humbly to your Reverence.

Wednesday, 30th of\r\nsaid month, I took the sun in 76°, and its declination was 22° 59′, and\r\nits polar altitude was 8° 59′, and the course was S.S.W.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st December, Thursday, the sun had 78° meridian altitude, and\r\n23° 4′ declination, and our distance (from the equator) 11° 4′, and the\r\ncourse was S.S.W.\r\n\r\nFriday, the 2nd of the said month, I took the sun in barely 80°, and\r\nits declination was 23° 3′, the altitude was just 13°, and the course\r\nS.S.W.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 3rd of the said month, I took the sun in 82° 15′, which\r\nhad 23° 13′ declination, and our distance was 14° 58′, and the course\r\nwas S.S.W.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 4th of the said month, the sun had 83° altitude, and 23°\r\n17′ declination; and our distance came to be 16° 17′, and the course\r\nwas S.S.W.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th of the said month, I took the sun in barely 84°, and it had\r\n23° 21′ declination; and our distance to the South came to be 17° 13′,\r\nand the course was S.S.W. ¼ W.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th of the said month, the sun had 85° meridian altitude, and\r\n23° 25′ declination; and the height to the S. Pole came to be 18° 25′;\r\nthe course was S.W. ¼ S.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th of the said month, I took the sun in 86° 30′, and it had\r\n23° 29′ declination; our distance from the line came 18° 57′, and the\r\ncourse was to W.S.W.\r\n\r\nThursday, 8th of the said month, I took the sun in 86° 30′, and it had\r\n23° 29′ declination; and so our altitude came to be 19° 59′, and the\r\ncourse was S.W., and we sounded here, and found bottom at 10 fathoms;\r\nand this day we saw land, flat beaches, and it was the day of the\r\nConception of our Lady.\r\n\r\nFriday, 9th of the said month (December), I took the sun in 88°, and\r\nits declination was 23° 31′; and our distance from the equinoctial line\r\ntowards the South part came to be 21° 31′, and the course was S.S.W.,\r\nand we arose in the morning to the right of St. Thomas, on a great\r\nmountain, and south slopes along the coast in the S.S.W. direction;\r\nand on this coast, at 4 leagues to sea, we found bottom at 25 fathoms,\r\nfree from shoals; and the mountains are separated one from another,\r\nand have many reefs round them; and in Brazil and St. Thomas there are\r\nmany rivers and ports; and going along the coast 6 leagues there are\r\nmany shoals 2 leagues out to sea, and there is a depth of 12 fathoms on\r\nthem, and 10, and 8; but the coast runs N.E. and S.W. to Cape Frio, and\r\nthere are many islands and rivers.\r\n\r\nAt Cape Frio there is a very large river, and to the N.E., at three\r\nleagues distance, there is the peak of a high mountain and three\r\nislands; and the cape is in 23°, and at the said cape there are three\r\nislands, and you leave them outside. Passing the said cape there is\r\na large bay, and at its entrance there is a low island, and the bay\r\nwithin is very large, with many ports; it extends two leagues from the\r\nmouth, and it is called Bay of St. Lucy; and if you wish to pass the\r\nisland, you leave it on the left hand, and (the entrance) is narrow;\r\nbut there is a depth of 7 fathoms, and a foul bottom; but outside\r\nthere is a depth of 20 to 25 fathoms, and within, where there is\r\nanchorage, there are 18 fathoms. In this bay there are good people,\r\nand plenty of them, and they go naked, and barter with fish-hooks,\r\nand looking-glasses, and little bells, for victuals. There is a good\r\ndeal of brazil wood, and this bay is in 23°, and we entered here the\r\nday of St. Lucy, and remained till the day of St. John, which is the\r\n27th of the month of December; and we set sail the same day, and went\r\nto W.S.W., and found seven islets, and to the right of them there is\r\na bay, and it is called the Bay of Kings; it has a good entrance, and\r\nin this neighbourhood, on the 31st of the month, I took the sun in 86°\r\n45′, and its declination was 22° 8′, and our latitude came to be 25°\r\n23′.\r\n\r\nSunday, 1st of January of the year 1520, I took the sun in 84°, and it\r\nhad 21° 23′ declination; and the altitude from the pole came to be 27°\r\n29´; and on the days after the first day we went to S.W., and the other\r\nto W. and the fourth day to S.W. ¼ S. Thursday, the 5th, the sun was in\r\n85° 30′ of altitude, and 23° 19′ of declination; so that our distance\r\nfrom the line came to be 29° 49′, and the course was S.W. ¼ S.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, the day of the Kings, the sun was in barely 80°, and had\r\n21° 8′ of declination; and the altitude from the pole came to be 31°,\r\nand the course was S.W.¼ W.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 7th, I took the sun in 78°; it had 20° 56′ of\r\ndeclination, and our parallel was 32° 56′; the course was to S.W. ¼ S.,\r\nand we went along the coast.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th I did not take the sun, but we went to S.W. ¼ S., and at\r\nnight we sounded and found 50 fathoms; and we altered the course, and\r\nwent on the 9th of the said month to W.S.W.; and in the morning we\r\nsounded, and found 15 fathoms, and we went till midday, and saw land,\r\nand there I took the sun in 76°, and it had 20° 31′ of declination; and\r\nat night we anchored in a bottom of 12 fathoms—34° 31′.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 10th January (1520), I took the sun in 75°; it had a\r\ndeclination of 20°, and our latitude came to 35°. We were to the right\r\nof the Cape of Sta. Maria. Thence forward the coast runs East and West,\r\nand the land is sandy; we gave it the name of Montevidi (now they call\r\nit correctly Santovidio), and between it and the Cape Sᵗᵃ Maria there\r\nis a river which is called (de los Patos) Duck River. From thence we\r\nwent on forward through fresh water, and the coast runs E.S.E. and\r\nW.N.W. for ten leagues distance; after that it trends N.E. and S.W. as\r\nfar as 34½°, with a depth of 5, 4 and 3 fathoms; there we anchored,\r\nand sent the ship _Santiago_ along the coast to see if there was a\r\nroadstead, and the river is in 33½°. To the N.E. we found some islets,\r\nand the mouth of a very large river (it was the river of Solis), and\r\nit went to the N. Here they turned back to the ships, and the said\r\nship was away from us a matter of 25 leagues, and they were 15 days in\r\ncoming; and during this time two other of our ships went in a southerly\r\ndirection to see if there was a roadstead for staying at; and those\r\nwent in the space of two days, and the Captain-General went thither,\r\nand they found land to the S.S.W., 20 leagues distance from us, and\r\nthey were four days in coming; and on returning we took in water and\r\nwood, and we went away from there, tacking from one tack to the other\r\nwith contrary winds, until we came in sight of Montevidi; and this was\r\non the 2nd day of the month of February, the day of our Lady of the\r\nCandlemas; and at night we anchored at 5 leagues from the mountain, and\r\nit lay to the S.E. and a quarter S. of us. Afterwards, on the morning\r\nof the 3rd, we set sail for the South, and we sounded, and found 4, 5,\r\n6, and 7 fathoms, always increasing in depth; and this day we took the\r\nsun in 68° 30′; it had 13° 35′ declination, and our latitude came to\r\n35°.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4th February, we anchored in a depth of seven fathoms, the\r\nship San Antonio having got leaky, and we were there till the 5th, and\r\nafterwards we weighed on the 6th, and stood on the south course, and at\r\nnight we anchored in eight fathoms, and remained there till next day.\r\n\r\nThe 7th we set sail to reconnoitre better the coast, and we saw that\r\nit trended S.E. ¼ S.; after that we took another tack and anchored in\r\n8 fathoms, and there we took the sun in 66° 30′, and it had 12° 15′\r\ndeclination, with which our distance from the equinoctial line to the\r\nsouth came to be 35¾°; after that we sailed the same day, and at night\r\nwe anchored in 9 fathoms, and stood for Cape Santanton [Cabo Blanco] it\r\nwas to the south in 36°, and this was Tuesday, the 7th.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th we set sail from the said point, and it is north and south\r\nwith Montevidi, and 27 leagues distant from it; this coast runs N. and\r\nS. [the width of the Rio de la Plata is 27 leagues]; from that place\r\nforward we went along the coast round the cape of St. Polonia; after\r\nthat the coast trends from N.E. to S.W. The said cape is in 37°, and\r\nthe land sandy and very low, it has sea of shallow depth for a distance\r\nof two leagues from land, of 8, 9, and 10 fathoms; so we ran all this\r\nday to the S.W., and the night and day.\r\n\r\nThursday, 9th of February, I took the sun in 63¼°; it had 11½°\r\ndeclination, and the altitude came to be 38° 30′; the coast can be\r\nsounded, and not very high nor mountainous, and we made out many smokes\r\nalong the coast; this coast runs E.W. ¼ N.W. S.E., and the point is\r\ncalled Punta de las Arenas.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I took the sun in 62° ⅓, and it had 11° 8′ declination,\r\nour distance from the equinoctial came to be 38° 48′, and the coast\r\nruns E. W., and it is a very pretty coast for running in one or other\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of the said month, I took the sun in 62°, it had 10° 47′\r\ndeclination, and the altitude came to be 38° 47′, and the course was W.\r\n¼ N.W., and the coast ran east and west from the Point do las Arenas;\r\nto this place there is a very good coast, with soundings, with many\r\nlittle green hills and low land.\r\n\r\nSunday the 12th, we did not take the sun, but from the day before\r\ntill midday we began to run to S.W. and to S.W. and a quarter W., and\r\nto W.S.W., and W. and a quarter S.W., but I calculate that the whole\r\ncourse was W.S.W., and this run was from midday of the 11th, till\r\nnightfall of the 12th, and at that hour we anchored in 9 fathoms, and\r\nfurther on in 13 fathoms, and after that we had anchored we saw land,\r\nand we set sail to the N., and this was on the 13th, and in the morning\r\nwe were alongside of some shoals, where the Victoria bumped several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nItem, the same day we were at anchor, and we did not take the sun’s\r\naltitude, and we were in soundings of 7 fathoms, and we remained there\r\ntill the 14th, and the said day I took the sun in 60½°, and it had 9°\r\n41′ declination, and our altitude came to 39° 11′.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of the said month I took the sun in 60°, and it had 9° 13′\r\ndeclination, and our distance came to be 39° 19′, and we sailed a south\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThursday the 16th, we could not take the sun until the 18th, and on\r\nthat day we were in 39¼°; and the next day, the 19th, we were in 39⅓°,\r\nand this day we went to S.W., and we went by this course, and could not\r\ntake the sun until the 20th of the month.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th I took the sun in 57°, it had 7° 27′ declination, and our\r\ndistance to the south came to 40° 17′.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, I took the sun in 55°, it had 7° 4′ declination, our\r\naltitude came to 42° 4′, the course was S.W. ¼ W., and we sounded and\r\nfound bottom at 55 fathoms.\r\n\r\nWednesday the 22nd, I took the sun in 53°, it had 6° 41′ declination,\r\nand our distance came to 43° 26′, the course was S.W. ¼ W.; at night we\r\nsounded and found bottom at 55 fathoms.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd I took the sun in 53¼°, it had 6° 18′ declination, our\r\ndistance from the line came to be 43° 3′, the course was W.N.W.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th I took the sun in 53°, it had 5° 54′ declination, our\r\naltitude from the pole came to 42° 54′, and our course was W.N.W., and\r\nwe were to the right of a very large bay, to which, we gave the name of\r\nBay of St. Matthew, because we found it on his day; we entered well in,\r\nand could not find bottom until we were entirely inside, and we found\r\n80 fathoms, and it has a circuit of 50 leagues, and the mouth is to the\r\nN.W., and it is in the altitude of 42½°.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th I did not take the sun, but I took it on the 26th, in 51⅔°,\r\nand it had 5° 7′ declination, by which we found ourselves in 43° 27′ to\r\nthe south, of the line, and the coast runs N.W. S.E. ¼ N.S.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th I took the sun in 50½°, and it had 4¾° declination, and\r\nso our altitude came to be 44°; and here to the right hand we found a\r\nbay, and three leagues before it there are two rocks, and they lie East\r\nand West with the said bay, and further on we found another (bay), and\r\nthere were in it many sea wolves, of which we caught eight, and on this\r\nland there are no people, but it is very good land, with pretty plains\r\nwithout trees, and very flat country.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 28th, I took the sun in 48½°, and it had 4° 21′ declination,\r\nand so we found ourselves in 44° 21′, and the course was to the south,\r\nand at night we saw land to W.N.W.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th I took the sun in 48½°, and this day it had 4°\r\ndeclination, by which we found ourselves in 45½°, and the course was to\r\nS.S.W. and to W.S.W. and to W.N.W., and I give the whole of the run as\r\nto W.S.W. until I took the sun, and afterwards we were two days that we\r\ncould not take it.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 2nd of March, I took the sun in 43° 50′, it had 3° 10′\r\ndeclination, with which our distance came to be 47°; and after that we\r\ndid not take the sun again until we entered a port called St. Julian,\r\nand we entered there on the last day of March, and remained there till\r\nthe day of St. Bartholomew, which is the 24th of August, and the said\r\nport is in 49⅔°, and there we caulked the ships, and many Indians\r\ncame there, who go covered with skins of antas, which are like camels\r\nwithout humps, and they carry some bows of canes very small like the\r\nTurkish, and the arrows are like theirs, and at the point they have a\r\nflint tip for iron, and they are very swift runners, and well made men,\r\nand well fashioned. We sailed thence on the 24th of the said month of\r\nAugust, and went along the coast to S.W. ¼ W., a matter of 30 leagues,\r\nand found a river called Santa Cruz, and we entered there on the 26th\r\nof August, and remained till the day of S. Lucas, which is the 18th of\r\nthe month of October, and there we caught much fish, and we took in\r\nwater and wood, and this coast is well defined and with good marks.\r\n\r\nThursday, the 18th of October, we sailed from the said river of Santa\r\nCruz, with contrary winds, we went for two days tacking about, and then\r\nwe had a fair wind, and went to the S.S.W. for two days, and in that\r\ntime we took the sun in 50⅔°, and it was on the 20th.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of the said month, I took the sun in exactly 52°, at\r\nfive leagues from the land, and there we saw an opening like a bay,\r\nand it has at the entrance, on the right hand a very long spit of\r\nsand, and the cape which we discovered before this spit, is called the\r\nCape of the Virgins, and the spit of sand is in 52° latitude, and 52½°\r\nlongitude, and from the spit of sand to the other part, there may be a\r\nmatter of 5 leagues, and within this bay we found a strait which may\r\nbe a league in width, and from this mouth to the spit you look East\r\nand West, and on the left hand side of the bay there is a great elbow,\r\nwithin which are many shoals, but when you enter the strait, keep to\r\nthe North side, and when you are in the strait go to the S.W., in the\r\nmiddle of the channel, and when you are in the strait, take care of\r\nsome shallows less than three leagues from the entrance of the straits,\r\nand after them you will find two islets of sand, and then you will find\r\nthe channel open, proceed in it at your pleasure without hesitation;\r\nand passing this strait we found another small bay, and then we found\r\nanother strait of the same kind as the first, and from one mouth to the\r\nother runs East and West, and the narrow part runs N.E. and S.W., and\r\nafter we had come out of the two straits or narrows, we found a very\r\nlarge bay, and we found some islands, and we anchored at one of them;\r\nand took the sun, and found ourselves in 52⅓°, and thence we came in\r\nS.S.E. direction, and found a spit on the left hand, and from thence\r\nto the first mouth there will be a matter of 30 leagues; after that\r\nwe went to S.W. a matter of 20 leagues, and there we took the sun,\r\nand we were in 53⅔°, and from there we returned to N.W., a matter of\r\n15 leagues, and there anchored in 53° latitude. In this strait there\r\nare a great many elbows, and the chains of mountains are very high and\r\ncovered with snow, with much forest. After that we went to N.W. and\r\na quarter W., and in this course there are many islets; and issuing\r\nfrom this strait the coast turns to the north, and on the left hand we\r\nsaw a cape with an island, and we gave them the name of Cape Fermoso\r\nand Cape Deseado, and it is in the same latitude as the Cape of the\r\nVirgins, which is at the beginning of the straits, and from the said\r\nCape Fermoso we afterwards went to N.W. and to N., and to N.N.E., and\r\nwe went in this course two days and three nights, and in the morning we\r\nsaw land of pointed hills, and it runs North and South (thus runs the\r\ncoast of the South sea) and from this land to Cape Fermoso there is a\r\nmatter of 20 leagues, and we saw this land the 1st December.\r\n\r\nNow I will commence the course and latitude of this voyage after this\r\nland, and the 1st day of December, when we were opposite to it; it is\r\nin latitude 48°.\r\n\r\nDecember—\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of December we did not take the sun, but we went to the\r\nN.N.E., and were in 47¼°, and this day we found ourselves that much\r\nahead,[446] as all this country is in the same altitude.\r\n\r\n  On the 3rd, we went N.W., and found ourselves in 46° 30′.\r\n     „   4th, to N.W.,               „             45½\r\n     „   5th, to N. ¼ N.W.           „             44¼\r\n     „   6th, to N.E. ¼ E.           „             44\r\n     „   7th, to N.E. ¼ E.           „             43⅔\r\n     „   8th, to N.E. ¼ N.           „             43¼\r\n     „   9th, to N.N.E.              „             42⅔\r\n     „  10th, to N.E. ¼ E.           „             42 12′.\r\n     „  11th, to N.E. ¼ E.           „             41⅔\r\n     „  12th, to N.E. ½ E.           „             41¼\r\n     „  13th, to N.E. ¼ N.           „             40\r\n     „  14th, to N.                  „             38¾\r\n     „  15th, to N. ¼ N.E.           „             38\r\n     „  16th, to N. ¼ N.W.           „             36½\r\n     „  17th, to N.W. ¼ N.           „             34½\r\n     „  18th, to N. ¼ N.W.           „             33½\r\n     „  19th, to N.W.                „             32⅔\r\n     „  20th, to N.W.                „             31¾\r\n     „  21st, to N.W.                „             30⅔\r\n     „  22nd, to W. ¼ S.W.,          „             30⅔°\r\n     „  23rd, to W.N.W.              „             30\r\n     „  24th, to W.N.W.              „             29¾\r\n     „  25th, to W.N.W.              „             29½\r\n     „  26th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             28¾\r\n     „  27th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             27⅔\r\n     „  28th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             26⅔\r\n     „  29th, to W.N.W.              „             26⅓\r\n     „  30th, to W., 12 leagues.\r\n     „  31st, to N.W.                „             25½\r\n  Year 1521—January—\r\n  On the 1st, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             25\r\n     „   2nd, to W.N.W.              „             24\r\n     „   3rd, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             23⅓\r\n     „   4th, to W.N.W.              „             22\r\n     „   5th, to W. ¼ S.W.           „             23\r\n     „   6th, to W. ¼ NW.            „             22\r\n     „   7th, to W., 25 leagues.\r\n     „   8th, to W., 23 leagues.\r\n     „   9th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             22¼\r\n     „  10th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             22\r\n     „  11th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             21¾\r\n     „  12th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             21⅓\r\n     „  13th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             21\r\n     „  14th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             20½\r\n     „  15th, to W.N.W.              „             19½\r\n     „  16th, to W.N.W.              „             19\r\n     „  17th, to W.N.W.              „             18¼\r\n     „  18th, to W.N.W.              „             17½\r\n     „  19th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             16¼\r\n     „  20th, to N.W. ¼ W.           „             15\r\n     „  21st, to S.W.                „             15⅔\r\n     „  22nd, to S.W.                „             16¾\r\n     „  23rd, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             16½\r\n     „  24th, to W. ¼ N.W.           „             16¼\r\n\r\nAnd in this neighbourhood we found an islet with trees on it.

To these first islands, from the archipelago of St.\r\nLazarus....\r\n\r\nYtem. From the Strait of All Saints and Cape Fermoso to these two\r\nislands, there will be 106° 30′ longitude, which strait is with these\r\nislands in a straight course W.N.W. and E.S.E., which brings you\r\nstraight to them. From here we went on our course.\r\n\r\nLeaving these islands, we sailed W., and fell in with the island of\r\nGada, which is uninhabited, and there we provided ourselves with water\r\nand wood. This island is very free from shoals.\r\n\r\nFrom here we departed and sailed W., and fell in with a large island\r\ncalled Seilani, which is inhabited, and contains gold; we coasted it,\r\nand went to W.S.W., to a small inhabited island called Mazaba. The\r\npeople are very good, and there we placed a cross upon a mountain; and\r\nfrom thence they showed us three islands in the W.S.W. direction, and\r\nthey say there is much gold there, and they showed us how they gather\r\nit, and they found small pieces like beans and like lentils; and this\r\nisland is in 9⅓° N. latitude.\r\n\r\nWe departed from Mazaba and went N., making for the island of Seilani,\r\nand afterwards coasted the said island to the N.W. as far as 10°,\r\nand there we saw three islets; and we went to the W., a matter of 10\r\nleagues, and then we fell in with two islets, and at night we stopped;\r\nand on the morrow we went S.W. and ¼ S., a matter of 12 leagues, as\r\nfar as 10⅓°, and there we entered a channel between two islands, one\r\ncalled Matan, and the other Subo; and Subo, with the isle of Mazaba and\r\nSuluan, are E.W. ¼ N.W.S.E.; and between Subo and Seilani we saw a very\r\nhigh land to the north, which is called Baibai, and they say that there\r\nis in it much gold and provisions, and much extent of land, that the\r\nend of it is not known.\r\n\r\nFrom Mazaba and Seilani and Subo, by the course which we came, towards\r\nthe south part, take care; for there are many shoals, and they are very\r\nbad; for this a canoe would not stop which met us in this course.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the channel of Subo and Matan we went west in\r\nmid-channel, and met with the town of Subu, at which we anchored, and\r\nmade peace, and there they gave us rice and millet and flesh; and we\r\nremained there many days; and the king and the queen, with many people,\r\nbecame Christians of their free will.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Subu, and went S.W. till 9¾° between the head of Subu\r\nand an island called Bohol; and on the W. side of the head of Subu\r\nthere is another, which is named Panilongo, and it belongs to black\r\nmen; and this island and Subu contain much gold and much ginger, and\r\nit is in 9⅓°, and Subu in 10⅓°; and so we came out of the channel, and\r\ncame ten leagues to the S., and anchored off the island of Bohol, and\r\nthere of the three ships we made two, and burned the other, not having\r\ncrews enough; and this island is in 9½°.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Bohol to Quipit to the S.W., and came to anchor at the\r\nsame anchorage to the right of a river; and in the offing to the N.W.\r\npart there are two islets, which are in 8½°, and there we could not get\r\nprovisions, for there were none, but we made peace with them; and this\r\nisland of Quipit has much gold, ginger, and cinnamon, and so we decided\r\non going to seek provisions; and from this head of Quipit to the first\r\nislands there will be a course of 112 leagues; it lies with them E.W. ¼\r\nN.E. S.W., and this island lies due East and West.\r\n\r\nFrom thence we sailed and went to W.S.W., and to S.W. and W., until we\r\nfell in with an island in which there were very few people, and it was\r\nnamed Cuagayan; and here we anchored on the N. side of it, and we asked\r\nwhere the island of Poluan was, to get provisions of rice, for there is\r\nmuch of it in that island, and they load many ships for other parts;\r\nand so they showed us where it was, and so we went to the W.N.W., and\r\nfell in with the head of the island of Poluan. Then we went to N. ¼\r\nN.E., coasting along it until the town Saocao, and there we made peace,\r\nand they were Moors; and we went to another town, which is of Cafres;\r\nand there we bought much rice, and so we provisioned ourselves very\r\nwell; and this coast runs N.E. S.W., and the cape of the N.E. part is\r\nin 9⅓°, and the part of S.W. is in 8⅓°; and so we returned to S.W. as\r\nfar as the head of this island, and there we found an island, and near\r\nit there is a shoal, and in this course, and along Poluan, there are\r\nmany shoals, and this head lies E.W. with Quipit, and N.W. S.E. ¼ E.W.\r\nwith Cuagayan.\r\n\r\nFrom Poluan we sailed for Borney, and we coasted the above-named\r\nisland, and went to its S.W. head, and near there found an island which\r\nhas a shoal on the E.; and in 7½° we had to change the course to W.,\r\nuntil running 15 leagues; after that we ran S.W., coasting the island\r\nof Bornei until the city itself; and you must know that it is necessary\r\nto go close to land, because outside there are many shoals, and it is\r\nnecessary to go with the sounding lead in your hand, because it is a\r\nvery vile coast, and Bornei is a large city, and has a very large bay,\r\nand inside it and without it there are many shoals; it is, therefore,\r\nnecessary to have a pilot of the country. So we remained here several\r\ndays, and began to trade, and we made good agreements of peace; and\r\nafter that they armed many canoes to take us, which were 260 in number,\r\nand they were coming to us, and as we saw them we sailed in great\r\nhaste, and we went outside and we saw some junks coming, and we went\r\nto them, and we captured one, in which was a son of the King of Luzon,\r\nwhich is a very large island, and also the captain let him go without\r\nthe counsel of anyone.\r\n\r\nBorney is a large island, and there is also in it cinnamon, mirabolams,\r\nand camphor, which is worth much in these countries; and they say\r\nthat when they die they embalm themselves with it. Borney is in 5°\r\n25′ latitude—that is, the port itself—and 201° 5′ of longitude from\r\nthe line of demarcation, and from here we sailed and returned by the\r\nsame road; and this port of Borney lies E.N.E. W.S.W. with the isle of\r\nMazaba, and in this course there are many islands; and from the cape at\r\nthe N.E. of Bornei to Quipit is E.W. ¼ N.E. S.W.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Borney, and returned by the same course which we\r\nhad come, and so we passed between the head of the isle of Bornei\r\nand Poluan; and we went to the W.,[448] to fall in with the isle of\r\nCuagayan; and so we went by the same course to make for the island of\r\nQuipit on the S. side, and in this course, between Quipit and Cuagayan,\r\nwe saw to the S. an island which they call Solo, in which there are\r\nmany pearls, very large—they say that the king of this island has a\r\npearl like an egg. This island is in 6° latitude; and so, going on this\r\ncourse, we fell in with three small islands; and further on we met with\r\nan island named Tagima, and they say there are many pearls there; and\r\nthis island lies with Solo N.E. S.W. ¼ E.W., and Tagima is in 6⅚°. It\r\nis opposite the Cape of Quipit, and the said cape is in 7¼°, and lies\r\nwith Paluan E.S.E. W.N.W.\r\n\r\nFrom here we coasted the island of Quipit on the south side, and we\r\nwent to E. ¼ S.E. as far as some islets; and along the coast there are\r\nmany villages, and there is much good cinnamon in this island, and we\r\nbought some of it; and there is much ginger on this coast; and so we\r\nwent to E.N.E., until we saw a gulf; then we went to S.E. until we saw\r\na large island, and thence to the cape at the east of the island of\r\nQuipit, and at the cape of this island there is a very large village,\r\nwhich collects much gold from a very large river, and this cape is\r\n191½° of the meridian.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Quipit to go to Maluco, and went to S.E., sighting an\r\nisland called Sibuco; after that we went to S.S.E., and saw another\r\nisland, called Virano Batolague; and we went by the same course as\r\nfar as the cape of this island, and after that we saw another, which\r\nthey call Candicar; and we went to the E. between the two, until we\r\nwent ahead of it; and there we entered a channel between Candicar and\r\nanother, which they call Sarangani; and at this island we anchored and\r\ntook a pilot for Maluco; and these two islands are in 4⅔°, and the cape\r\nof Quipit in 7¼°, and the Cape of Sibuco, on the south side, is in 6°,\r\nand the Cape of Virano Batologue in 5°, and from the Cape of Quipit and\r\nCandicar the run is from N.N.W. to S.S.E., without touching any cape.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Sarangani, and went S. ¼ S.E., until we came opposite\r\nan island called Sanguin, and between the two are many islets, and they\r\nare on the West side, and this island is in 3⅔°. From Sanguin we went\r\nS. ¼ S.E. to an island called Sian; between them there are many islets,\r\nand this island is in just 3°. From Sian we went to S ¼ S.W., as far\r\nas an island called Paginsara, it is in 1⅙°; and from this island to\r\nSarangani the run is N.S ¼ N.E. S.W. in sight of all these islands.\r\n\r\nFrom Paginsara we went to S. ¼ S.E., until we came between two islets,\r\nwhich lie together, N.E. and S.W., and that one to the N.E. is named\r\nSuar, and the other is named Atean, and one is in 1° 45′, and the other\r\nin 1½°.\r\n\r\nFrom Atean we went S.S.E. until we sighted the Molucos, and then\r\nwe went to East, and entered between Mare and Tidori, at which we\r\nanchored, and there we were very well received, and made very good\r\narrangements for peace, and made a house on shore for trading with the\r\npeople, and so we remained many days, until we had taken in cargo.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the Malucos are these: Terrenate, Tidori, Mare, Motil,\r\nMaquian, Bachian, and Gilolo, these are all those which contain cloves\r\nand nutmeg; and there are also several others among them, the names of\r\nwhich I will mention, and in what altitude they are, and the first is\r\nTerrenate, which is on the side of the equinoctial line.\r\n\r\n  Terrenate is in altitude of    1° 0′\r\n  Tidori       „      „          0 30\r\n  Mare         „      „          0 15\r\n  Motil is on the line           0\r\n  Maquian is to the south        0 15\r\n  Cayoan       „      „          0 20\r\n  Bachian      „      „          1\r\n  La Talata    „      „          1  ¼\r\n\r\nLa Talata (Lata-lata) lies north of Terrenate N.N.E. and S.S.W., and\r\nthat which is on the equinoctial line is 190° 30′ of longitude from\r\nthe line itself, and the island of Motil itself with Cagayan lies N.W.\r\nand S.E., and with Tagima, which is opposite the island of Quipit, it\r\nlies N.E. and S.W. ¼ N.S., but in these courses one cannot venture to\r\npass, for they say there are many shoals, and so we came by another\r\ncourse, coasting the said islands. From the islands of Maluco we sailed\r\nSaturday, 21st December, of the said year 1521, and we went to the\r\nisland of Mare, and there took in wood to burn, and the same day we\r\nsailed and went to S.S.W., making for Motil, and thence we went by the\r\nsame course, making for Maquian, and thence we went to S.W., running\r\nby all these islands, and others, which are these:—Cuayoan, Laboan,\r\nAgchian, Latalata, and other small islands, which remain in the N.W.\r\nquarter, and now I will say in what latitude and longitude are each one\r\nseparately, and which are those which contain cloves and other spices.\r\nThe first to the North is Terrenate, which is in 1° North, and Tidore\r\n40′ and Mare 15′ and Motil on the equinoctial line, and these lie North\r\nand South. The others to the South are these: Maqui is in 20′ Cuayoan\r\nin 40′ and Laboan in 1°, and Latalata in 1° 15′ and Bachian lies with\r\nTerrenate E.N.E. and W.S.W.; and to the S.E. of all these islands there\r\nis a very large island called Gilolo, and there are cloves in it, but\r\nvery few; therefore there are seven islands which contain cloves, and\r\nthose which have a large quantity are these: Terrenate, Tidore, Motil,\r\nMaqui, and Bachian, which are the five principal ones, and some of them\r\ncontain nutmeg and mace. Motil is on the line, and is in longitude of\r\nthe meridian of 191° 45′\r\n\r\nFrom Latalata we went to S.W. ¼ W., and fell in with an island which\r\nis called Lumutola, it is in 1¾°, and on the W. side there is another\r\nisland called Sulan, and at these islands there are many shoals, and\r\nfrom hence we took the course to the South, towards an island named\r\nBuro, and between these three, there is another island which is named\r\nFenado, it is in 2½°, and Buro is in 3½°, and it lies with Bachian\r\nN.E. and S.W. ¼ N.S. in longitude 194°; and to the East of Buro there\r\nis a very large island called Ambon, in which they make much cotton\r\ncloths, and between it and Buro there are some islets; take care of\r\nthem, for this it is necessary to coast the island of Buro to the East,\r\nand to the South of it. I took the sun in 70° 24′, it had 22° 36′\r\ndeclination, and so the latitude came to be 3°. I was in the Southern\r\npart of the island, and this was on the 27th of December, on Friday. On\r\nthe 28th of the said month, I did not take the sun, but we were in the\r\nneighbourhood of the said isle of Buro, and Bidia, which, lies to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nSunday, 29th, I took the sun in 71½°, it had 22° 21′ declination, and\r\nour distance came to be 3° 51′, and we were opposite the isle of Ambon.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th I took the sun in the altitude of the day before, in calm,\r\nit was Monday.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st I did not take the sun, we were a matter of 12 leagues from\r\nthe Isle of Ambon E.N.E. and W.S.W., the day was Tuesday.\r\n\r\n1522—\r\n\r\nThe 1st day of January, 1522, I took the sun in barely 73°, it had 21°\r\n54′ declination, the altitude came to be 4° 45′.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of the month, I took the sun in 73¾°, it had 21¾°\r\ndeclination, our distance came to be 5½°, the course was to S.W., and\r\nit was Thursday.\r\n\r\nFriday, 3rd, I did not take the sun, but the ship made the course of\r\nS.S.W., in latitude of 6⅓°, after that we took the course to N.W.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of the month I did not take the sun, but we were in 5¾°, the\r\ncourse was to N.W., and the day Saturday.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 5th, I took the sun in 75°, it had 21° 14′ declination, the\r\nlatitude came to 6° 14′.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, Monday, I took the sun in 76°, it had 21° 2′ declination,\r\nthe latitude came to be 7° 2′.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, I took the sun in 76⅔°, it had 20° 50′ declination, the\r\nlatitude came to be 7½°, and the course was to S.W. Tuesday.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of the month, I took the sun in 77½°, it had 20° 37′\r\ndeclination, and the latitude came to be 8° 7′, the course was to S.W.,\r\nand the day Wednesday, and this day we saw some islands, which lie\r\nEast and West, and this day we entered between two of them, which are\r\nthese, Lamaluco and Aliguom; between them are two little ones which\r\nyou will leave on the right hand after entering the channel, they are\r\ninhabited; this channel lies N.E. S.W. ¼ E.W., with Buro, and all these\r\nislands are ten in number, and they lie E.W. ¼ N.E. S.W., and they\r\nhave of longitude a matter of 50 leagues; we ran along them, with very\r\nbad weather from the South; we coasted them and anchored off the last,\r\nwhich is called Malua, which is in 8⅓°, the others are named Liaman,\r\nMaumana, Cui, Aliguim, Bona, Lamaluco, Ponon, Vera. We sailed from\r\nMalua and went to the South, and found the island of Timor, and we\r\ncoasted the coast from east to west, on the north side of this island,\r\nwhich is in the latitude of 9°, and the nearest land on the north side,\r\nand this land will have 10 leagues journey, and this coast lies with\r\nBuro N.E. S.W. ¼ N.S., in longitude of 197° 45´, and of this island of\r\nTimor we coasted all the coast from east to west, as far as the village\r\nof Manvai; and first we came near the village of Queru, and from Queru\r\nto Manvai, the coast runs N.E. S.W ¼ N.S., and here I took the sun on\r\nthe 5th day of February, in 86⅔°, and it had 12° 44′ declination, so\r\nthat the latitude came to be 9° 24′, and this island is very large and\r\npopulous, and all the island has much sandal wood, and there are many\r\ntowns in it.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of February I took the sun in 87½°, and it had 11° 42′ of\r\ndeclination, with which our distance came to be 9⅙°, and we were at\r\nthe head of the island of Timor, at the West end, and from here to the\r\nEastern cape the coast runs E.N.E. to W.S.W., and it was Saturday.\r\n\r\nSunday, 9th of the said month, I took the sun in 88⅙°, and it had 11⅓°\r\ndeclination. Our latitude came to be 9° 35′, and we were at the most\r\nsalient cape of all the island, and from there it goes falling off to\r\nthe S.W. and S.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of the same month I took the sun in 88¼°, it had 10° 58′\r\ndeclination; our latitude came to be 9° 28′, and the head of the island\r\nlay to the south, and the day was Monday.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, Tuesday, I took the sun in 88¼°, it had 9⅓° declination;\r\nthe latitude came to 9° 35′, and we were in calm.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 12th, I did not take the sun, but we were becalmed in\r\nthe neighbourhood of where we were the the day before, or a little more.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th I took the sun in 89⅔°; it had 9° 52′ declination; the\r\nlatitude came to 10° 32′, and we were in the neighbourhood of islands\r\nof which we do not know the names, nor whether they are inhabited. They\r\nlie E.S.E. and W.N.W. with the west cape of Timor, and from here we\r\ntook our course to the Cape of Good Hope, and went to W.S.W.\r\n\r\n[After this the course was W.S.W. for several days, and there is\r\nnothing worthy of note till Tuesday, the 18th of March, when the\r\nVictoria discovered Amsterdam Island.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of the said month (March), I took the sun in 49½°, it had\r\n2° 55′ declination, the latitude came to be 37° 35′, and whilst taking\r\nthe sun we saw a very high island, and we went towards it to anchor,\r\nand we could not fetch it; and we struck the sails and lay to until\r\nnext day, and the wind was W.; and we made another tack to the north\r\nunder storm sails;[449] and this was on the 19th, and we could not take\r\nthe sun; we were east and west with the island, and it is in 38°[450]\r\nto the south, and it appears that it is uninhabited, and it has no\r\ntrees at all, and it has a circumference of a matter of six leagues.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of the said month, Thursday, I did not take the sun, but we\r\nwere east and west with the island, and we went to N.W. and to N.N.W.\r\nand ¼ N.W., and for the whole course I put down a matter of 15 leagues\r\nto the N.N.W., and in the latitude of 35½°.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of the said month I took the sun in 50¼°: it had 4° 27′\r\ndeclination; the latitude came to 36° 18′. The day before we had struck\r\nthe sails until the morning of the said Saturday, and this day we set\r\nsail and went to the N.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of the said month (May) I did not take the sun; but,\r\naccording to the run we had made, we thought we were ahead of the Cape,\r\nand on this day we saw land, and the coast runs N.E. and S.W. and a\r\nquarter east and west; and so we saw that we were behind the Cape a\r\nmatter of 160 leagues, and opposite the river Del Infante,[451] eight\r\nleagues distant from it in the offing; and this day we were lying to\r\nwith winds from the west and west-north-west, and it was Thursday.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th I did not take the sun, but we made land and anchored,\r\nand the coast was very wild, and we remained thus till next day; and\r\nthe wind shifted to W.S.W., and upon that we set sail, and we went\r\nalong the coast to find some port for anchoring and taking refreshments\r\nfor the people who were most suffering, which we did not find. And we\r\nstood out to sea, to be at our ease; and we saw many smokes along the\r\ncoast, and the coast was very bare, without any trees, and this coast\r\nruns N.E. and S.W.: it is in 33° latitude, and it was Saturday, 10th of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Het Eyland Amsterdam.+]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Het Eyland Sᵗ. Paulo.+]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFriday, the 16th (May), I took the sun in 33¼°; it had 21° 6′\r\ndeclination; the latitude came to 35° 39′, and we were E.S.E. and\r\nW.N.W., with the Cape of Good Hope twenty leagues off from it; and this\r\nday we sprung our fore-mast and fore-yard, and we were all day hove to,\r\nand the wind was W.\r\n\r\n[The _Victoria_ doubled the Cape of Good Hope between the 18th and the\r\n19th of May, and arrived] on the 9th of the month of July, and anchored\r\nin the port of Rio Grande in Santiago [of the Cape Verde Islands], and\r\nthey received us very well, and gave us what provisions we wanted; and\r\nthis day was Wednesday, and they reckoned this day as Thursday, and so\r\nI believe that we had made a mistake of a day; and we remained there\r\ntill Sunday in the night, and we set sail for fear of bad weather and\r\nthe difficulty of the port; and on the morrow we sent our boat on shore\r\nto get more rice, which we wanted, and we were standing off and on till\r\nit came.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, Monday, we sent our boat on shore for more rice,\r\nand it came at midday, and returned for more, and we were waiting for\r\nit till night, and it did not come; and we waited till next day, and\r\nit never came; then we went near the port to see what the matter was,\r\nand a boat came and told us to give ourselves up, and that they would\r\nsend us with a ship which was coming from the Indies, and that they\r\nwould put some of their people in our ship, and that the gentlemen had\r\nso ordered. We required them to send us our boat and men, and they\r\nsaid that they would bring an answer from the gentlemen; and we said\r\nwe would take another tack, and would wait: and so we took another\r\ntack, and we made all sail, and went away with twenty-two men, sick and\r\nsound, and this was Tuesday, the 15th of the month of July. On the 14th\r\nI took the sun. This town is in 15° 10′.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1522.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of the said month, in the morning, we saw land, and it was\r\nCape St. Vincent, and it was to the north-east of us, and so we changed\r\nour course to the S.E., to get away from that Cape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    The manuscript has at the end:\r\n                Vᵗᵒ Simancas, 8 Setiembre, 1783, Muñoz.\r\n\r\n  D. Juan Bautista Muñoz, who died in 1822 or 1823, made a large\r\n  collection of transcripts from the Simancas and Seville archives,\r\n  which Navarrete made use of. In 1793 Muñoz published the first\r\n  volume of his _Historia del Nuevo Mundo_, which he never finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED\r\n                                  TO\r\n                    THE SHIP “TRINITY” AND HER CREW\r\n\r\n            _After she parted company with the “Victoria”._\r\n                           _From Navarrete._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the _Victoria_ left Tidore, the crew of the _Trinity_ commenced\r\ncareening their ship, and took out of her and placed in the store-house\r\nin Tidore their goods and the guns of the _Conception_, which they\r\nhad burned, and of the _Santiago_, which was lost. Gonzalo Gomez de\r\nEspinosa determined to leave in charge of these goods and factory the\r\naccountant, Juan de Campos, as clerk; the officer, Luis del Molino; the\r\nservants, Alonso de Cota, Genoese, and Diego Arias; and Master Pedro, a\r\nbombardier.\r\n\r\nTaking leave of the King of Tidore, the _Trinity_ sailed thence on the\r\n6th of April 1522, with fifty men on the muster-roll, and a cargo of\r\nnine hundred quintals of cloves. The _Trinity_ sailed for forty leagues\r\nto an island named Zanufo, in 2 deg. 30 min. N. latitude, belonging\r\nto the King of Tidore, thence to the open sea, where they calculated\r\nthey had two thousand leagues to run to Panama. In 20 deg. they fell\r\nin with an island, where they took in a native, and continuing a\r\nnortherly course to 42 deg., they met with a storm which lasted five\r\ndays, and they had to cut away the castle at the prow; their poop was\r\nbroken; their mainmast was broken in two. The crews fell sick, and they\r\nreturned to seek the island from which they had taken the native; but,\r\nnot being able to fetch it, they arrived at another twenty leagues\r\ndistant from it. This island was named Mao, and is to the north of the\r\nisland Botaha; they are in 12 deg. and 13 deg. This island was three\r\nhundred leagues from the Moluccas, and they were a month and a half in\r\ngetting there; many of the crew died. When they arrived and anchored\r\nat the first land, which was Zanufo, a vessel passed by which informed\r\nthem that a fortnight after the _Trinity_ sailed, five or seven\r\nPortuguese sail had arrived at Terrenate, whose captain was Antonio\r\nde Brito, and that they were building a fortress there. Barros states\r\nthat the first stone of this was placed by Antonio de Brito June 24th,\r\n1522. The captain of the _Trinity_ begged the people of this vessel to\r\ntake a man to Terrenate, who was Bartolome Sanchez, the clerk of the\r\nship, by whom he sent a letter to the Portuguese captain, begging him,\r\non the part of His Majesty, to send him succour to prevent the ship\r\nbeing lost, for his crew was sick and reduced in number. Gonzalo Gomez,\r\nseeing that this was delayed, weighed, and came to anchor in the port\r\nof Benaconora. Simon Abreu, and Duarte Roger, clerk of the King of\r\nPortugal’s factory, came there, with other people, in a caracora, and\r\nafter that came a fusta and caravel, with other armed Portuguese, who\r\nentered the _Trinity_, and gave to the captain a letter from Antonio\r\nde Brito in answer to his, dated October 21st, 1522, which only said\r\nthat people were going to bring in his ship. By an order which they\r\nbrought from Antonio Brito, they at once took from Gonzalo Gomez all\r\nthe letters, astrolabes, quadrants, and log-books which he had made;\r\nthey took the vessel and anchored her in the port of Talangomi. There\r\nwere seventeen Castilians of sound and sick in the vessel, and they\r\ntook those that were well with Gonzalo Gomez to the fortress, and next\r\nday took the sick to the hospital.\r\n\r\nGonzalo Gomez complained of the violence done in taking that which\r\nbelonged to the emperor, and in his country. They replied that he had\r\ndone what the emperor, his lord, had commanded him; and they, what they\r\nought to do by the instructions from the king, their lord. They asked\r\nhim to give up the royal standard of Castile, and he answered that he\r\ncould not do so, neither could he defend it, since he was in their\r\npower. Upon which they drew up some documents before a notary; and\r\nwhen they discharged the cargo of the ship, he asked the Portuguese to\r\ngive him a certificate of what was in it, for him to render an account\r\nto His Majesty; and they replied that, if he asked for this often,\r\nthey would give it him on a yard arm. In the fortress we found Juan\r\nde Campos, Diego Arias, and Alonzo, the Genoese, sick, who were three\r\nof those who had remained in Tidore with the goods of His Majesty.\r\nThey said that the Portuguese had knocked down the factory-house and\r\ntaken the cloves and receipts for cloves which were paid for, and all\r\nthe rigging and fittings of the ships; Luis del Molino had fled, and\r\nGonzalo Gomez called him to come to the fortress under safe conduct,\r\nbut when in it they put him in irons; Master Pedro had died.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship was in Tidore, the pilot, Juan Lopez Carvalho, died on\r\nthe 14th February, 1522; and, between sailing thence and anchoring at\r\nBenaconora, there died in August, September, and October, thirty-one\r\nindividuals, without counting three who ran away in the isle of Mao of\r\nthe Ladrones.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-one Castilians of the ship and factory remained about four\r\nmonths as prisoners in Terrenate, until, at the end of February 1523,\r\nCaptain Antonio de Brito gave them a passage to India, sending them to\r\nthe island of Banda, which was a hundred leagues off, excepting the\r\ncarpenter Antonio, and the caulker Antonio Basazaval, whom he said\r\nthat he required. The clerk of the factory, Juan de Campos, and three\r\nother Castilians, went in a junk, of which nothing was known nor what\r\nbecame of those persons. The Castilians remained in Banda about four\r\nmonths; from thence they were conducted to Java, and coasting it they\r\narrived at a city named Agrazue. Agrazue was a town of thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, Mussulmans, of great trade, to which porcelain, silks, and\r\nother Chinese goods were brought from Borneo and other parts.\r\n\r\nFrom Agrazue they went to Malacca, two hundred leagues distant, where\r\nJorge de Albuquerque was captain.\r\n\r\nThey were about five months at Malacca. Four Castilians died there at\r\nthe end of November 1524. The ship-boy, Anton Moreno, remained there,\r\nwho was, they said, the slave of a sister of Jorge de Albuquerque,\r\nand the rest went on to India. They were twenty-five days in reaching\r\nCeylon, which was three hundred leagues, and they went a hundred\r\nleagues more to Cochin. The clerk, Bartolomé Sanchez, and two others,\r\nwent in a junk, of which nothing more was heard. In Cochin they found\r\nthat the ships for Portugal had sailed a short time before their\r\narrival, and they had to wait a year for the passage of the spice ships.\r\n\r\nAfter they had been ten months in Cochin, without obtaining leave to\r\nembark, the seaman, Leon Pancaldo, and Bautista Poncero, master of the\r\nship _Trinity_, fled secretly in the ship _Sta. Catalina_, which left\r\nthem in Mozambique. There they were arrested and put on board the ship\r\nof Diego de Melo to be taken to the Governor of India, but contrary\r\nwinds did not permit her departure; and, having been allowed to go\r\nashore, Bautista Poncero died, and Leon Pancaldo hid himself in the\r\nship of Francisco Pereira, which was going to Portugal. He remained hid\r\ntill they got a hundred leagues from Mozambique. When they arrived at\r\nLisbon they put him in prison, from which the king commanded him to be\r\nset free.\r\n\r\nAt this time, D. Vasco da Gama arrived in India as Viceroy, and the\r\nCastilians begged for leave to embark in the ships which were going to\r\nPortugal, but he would not give it. The Viceroy died in twenty days,\r\nand they elected in his stead D. Enrique de Meneses governor of Goa,\r\nwho came to Cochin. Two Castilians died there, and those that remained\r\nhad to wait for another year.\r\n\r\nGonzalo Gomez had done homage and could not get away until after\r\nconstant recourse and petitions to the governor, D. Enrique de Meneses,\r\nwho gave him leave, as also to the seaman, Gines de Mafra, and to\r\nMaster Hans, a bombardier, when it was known there that the King\r\nof Portugal was married to Da. Catalina, sister of His Majesty the\r\nEmperor. These three individuals left Cochin in the Portuguese ships,\r\nand when they arrived at Lisbon they put them in the Limoneiro or\r\npublic prison, where Master Hans died. Gonzalo Gomez and Gines de Mafra\r\nremained there about seven months, until they were set free by letters\r\nfrom His Majesty; but Gonzalo Gomez[452] was set free twenty-seven\r\ndays before Gines, whom they supposed to be a pilot, having found some\r\nlog-books in his box and two other (books), which Andres de San Martin,\r\npilot of His Majesty, had made, which books and other writings they\r\ntook, and would not return to him.\r\n\r\nFrom their departure from Terrenate, in the Moluccas, to Lisbon,\r\ninclusively, there died eight individuals. What became of seven was\r\nunknown; two remained in the Moluccas; one in Malacca; and three\r\nreached Spain, besides the licentiate and priest, Morales.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGaspar Correa says (tome iii, p. 109):—\r\n\r\n“In this year 1527, one Sebastian Gabato, a Basque, and a great pilot,\r\nsailed from Seville as captain-major of two ships and a caravel, who\r\nwas ordered by the Viceroy of the Antilles to go and take in cargo at\r\nMaluco, and recover the property of the Castilians, which he might find\r\nbelonging to the ship of the fleet of Fernan de Magalhāes which put\r\nin in distress; and if he found any things in the possession of the\r\nPortuguese, he was to ask for them and require them from the captains\r\non behalf of the emperor, with all urbanity: and if they did not choose\r\nto give them up, he was to ask for documents, with protests, which he\r\nwas to bring to the emperor for him to do in the matter what might be\r\nfor his service. This fleet sailed from Seville, and never more was\r\nany news heard of what became of it, nor what end it had. This only\r\nwas known, that this fleet had thus sailed this year, through other\r\nCastilians, who later arrived at Maluco in another fleet, as I will\r\nrelate further on in its place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [Correa relates, in his Tom. III, cap. xiv, that Charles V sent\r\n  a fleet of five ships in 1527 to Maluco under Fray Garcia de\r\n  Loaysa, and that only one ship under Captain Martim Inhigo reached\r\n  Maluco: he then describes the disputes and skirmishes between the\r\n  Castilians and Portuguese.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ACCOUNT OF\r\n                    THE MUTINY IN PORT ST. JULIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNavarrete gives, No. XX of his documents relating to Magellan, a\r\ncopy of a document presented on Wednesday, the 22nd of May, 1521,\r\nby a servant of Diego Barbosa, on behalf of Alvaro de Mezquita,\r\nto the Alcalde of Seville, dated April 26th, 1520, which were the\r\ninformations taken in Port St. Julian by Martin Mendes, clerk of the\r\n_Victoria_; Sancho de Heredia, king’s notary; Gonzalo Gomes de Spinosa,\r\nAlguazil-mayor or chief constable of the fleet: he could not write, and\r\nDomingo de Barruty signed for him.\r\n\r\nThese informations were taken in consequence of a petition from Alvaro\r\nde Mezquita, captain of the _S. Antonio_, to Magellan, complaining of\r\nGaspar de Quesada, captain of the _Conception_, and Juan de Cartagena,\r\nwith about thirty armed men, having seized him the night of Palm\r\nSunday, April 1st, 1520, and having locked him up in the cabin of\r\nGeronimo Guerra, the clerk of the _S. Antonio_. This petition was\r\npresented to Magellan when he was on shore, after hearing Mass on\r\nSunday, the 15th of April, and he gave orders to the two clerks and\r\nAlguazil to make an inquiry on board the _S. Antonio_. His order was\r\ndated April 17th, and signed by himself and Leon de Speleta, clerk of\r\nthe flag-ship. The informations taken on board the _S. Antonio_ were\r\ndated Thursday, the twenty-sixth April, 1520.\r\n\r\nNo. XXI of Navarrete is a letter from Juan Lopez do Recalde to the\r\nBishop of Burgos, of May 12th, 1521, giving him an account of the\r\narrival of the _S. Antonio_ at Seville, 6th May, 1521, commanded by\r\nGeronimo Guerra, a relation and servant of Christoval de Haro, and of\r\nthe execution of Gaspar de Quesada and others. This letter relates the\r\nstory of the mutineers and those who turned back from difficulty and\r\ndanger, and is naturally unfavourable to Magellan.\r\n\r\nAccording to Navarrete, the desertion of Magellan’s fleet by the ship\r\n_S. Antonio_, was caused by Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese pilot, who,\r\nfrom rivalry with Magellan, and envy at seeing others promoted instead\r\nof himself, after the executions, got up a conspiracy on board the _S.\r\nAntonio_, and proposed to return to Spain. The mutineers put Alvaro de\r\nMezquita in irons; they then went to the coast of Guinea, and thence\r\nto Spain. When the _S. Antonio_ arrived at Seville, Alvaro de Mezquita\r\nwas handed over to the authorities and kept in prison until the ship\r\n_Victoria_ arrived. Esteban Gomez, Juan do Chinchilla, Geronimo Guerra,\r\nand Francisco Angulo, were also arrested; and Magellan’s wife and\r\nfamily were put under surveillance to prevent their going away to\r\nPortugal. According to Herrera, Juan de Cartagena and the priest, who\r\nwere left behind, did not come away with the _S. Antonio_, and orders\r\nwere given to send and look for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMore ample details of the suppression of the mutiny are given by Gaspar\r\nCorrea in the following account of Magellan’s voyage, in his _Lendas da\r\nIndia_ (tome II, cap. xiv):—\r\n\r\n“Ferdinand Magellan went to Castile to the port of Seville, where\r\nhe married the daughter of a man of importance, with the design of\r\nnavigating on the sea, because he was very learned in the art of\r\npilots, which is that of the sphere. The emperor kept the House of\r\nCommerce in Seville, with the overseers of the treasury, with great\r\npowers, and much seafaring traffic, and fleets for abroad. Magellan,\r\nbold with his knowledge, and with the readiness which he had to annoy\r\nthe King of Portugal, spoke to the overseers of this House of Commerce,\r\nand told them that Malacca, and Maluco, the islands in which cloves\r\ngrew, belonged to the emperor on account of the demarcation drawn\r\nbetween them both [the Kings of Spain and Portugal]: for which reason\r\nthe King of Portugal wrongfully possessed these lands: and that he\r\nwould make this certain before all the doctors who might contradict\r\nhim, and would pledge his head for it. The overseers replied to him,\r\nthat they well knew that he was speaking truth, and that the emperor\r\nalso knew it, but that the emperor had no navigation to that part,\r\nbecause he could not navigate through the sea within the demarcation\r\nof the King of Portugal. Magellan said to them: ‘If you would give me\r\nships and men, I would show you navigation to those parts, without\r\ntouching any sea or land of the King of Portugal; and if not, they\r\nmight cut off his head.’ The overseers, much pleased at this, wrote\r\nit to the emperor, who answered them that he had pleasure in the\r\nspeech, and would have much more with the deed; and that they were\r\nto do everything to carry out his service, and the affairs of the\r\nKing of Portugal, which were not to be meddled with; rather than that\r\neverything should be lost. With this answer from the emperor, they\r\nspoke with Magellan, and became much more convinced by what he said,\r\nthat he would navigate and show a course outside of the seas of the\r\nKing of Portugal; and that if they gave him the ships he asked for, and\r\nmen and artillery, he would fulfil what he had said, and would discover\r\nnew lands which were in the demarcation of the emperor, from which he\r\nwould bring gold, cloves, cinnamon, and other riches. The overseers\r\nhearing this, with a great desire to render so great a service to the\r\nemperor as the discovery of this navigation, and to make this matter\r\nmore certain, brought together pilots and men learned in the sphere,\r\nto dispute upon the matter with Magellan, who gave such reasons to\r\nall, that they agreed with what he said, and affirmed that he was a\r\nvery learned man. So the overseers at once made agreements with him,\r\nand arrangements, and powers, and regulations, which they sent to the\r\nemperor, who confirmed everything, reserving specially the navigation\r\nof the King of Portugal; thus he commanded and prohibited, and ordered\r\nthat everything which Magellan asked for should be given him. On this\r\naccount, Magellan went to Burgos, where the emperor was, and kissed\r\nhis hand, and the emperor gave him a thousand cruzados alimony for\r\nthe expenses of his wife whilst he was on his voyage, set down in the\r\nrolls of Seville, and he gave him power of life and death[453] over all\r\npersons who went in the fleet, of which he should be captain-major,\r\nwith regard to which he assigned him large powers. So, on his return to\r\nSeville, they equipped for him five small ships, such as he asked for,\r\nequipped and armed as he chose, with four hundred men-at-arms, and they\r\nwere laden with the merchandise which he asked for. The overseers told\r\nhim to give the captaincies, with regard to which he excused himself,\r\nsaying that he was new in the country and did not know the men; and\r\nthat they should seek out men who would be good and faithful in the\r\nemperor’s service, and who would rejoice to endure hardships in his\r\nservice, and the bad life which they would have to go through in the\r\nvoyage. The overseers were obliged to him for this, and held it to be\r\ngood advice, and decided to inform the captains they might make, and\r\nthe crews they might take, of the powers which he had received from\r\nthe emperor. This they did, and they sought in Seville for trustworthy\r\nmen for captains, who were Juan de Cartagena, Luis de Mendoça, Juan\r\nSerrano, Pero de Quesada. This fleet having been fitted out, and the\r\ncrews paid for six months, he sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda in\r\nAugust of the year 1519. So he navigated to the Canary Islands, and\r\ntook in water; whilst he was there a vessel arrived with letters from\r\nhis father-in-law,[454] in which he warned him to keep a good watch\r\nfor his personal safety, because he had learned that the captains whom\r\nhe took with him had said to their friends and relations, that if he\r\nannoyed them they would kill him, and would rise up against him. To\r\nthis he replied, that he would do them no injuries so that they should\r\nhave reason to act thus; and on that account he had not appointed them,\r\nbut the overseers, who knew them, had given them; and whether they were\r\ngood or bad, he would labour to do the service of the emperor, and for\r\nthat they had offered their lives. The father-in-law showed this answer\r\nto the overseers, who greatly praised the good heart of Magellan.”\r\n\r\n“He sailed from the Canaries of Tanarife, and made the Cape Verde,\r\nwhence he crossed over to the coast of Brazil, and there entered a\r\nriver which is named Janeiro. There went, as chief pilot, a Portuguese\r\nnamed Joan Lopes Carvalhinho, who had already been in this river, and\r\ntook with him a son whom he had gotten there of a woman of the country.\r\nFrom this place they went on sailing until they reached the Cape of\r\nSanta Maria, which Joan of Lisbon had discovered in the year 1514;\r\nthence they went to the river San Julian. While they were there taking\r\nin water and wood, Juan de Cartagena, who was sub-captain-major, agreed\r\nwith the other captains to rise up, saying that Magellan had got them\r\nbetrayed and entrapped. As they understood that Gaspar de Quesada was\r\na friend of Magellan’s, Juan de Cartagena got into his boat at night,\r\nwith twenty men, and went to the ship of Gaspar Quesada, and went in to\r\nspeak to him, and took him prisoner,[455] and made a relation of his\r\ncaptain of the ship, in order that all three might go at once to board\r\nMagellan and kill him, and after that they would reduce the other ship\r\nof Joan Serrano, and would take the money and goods, which they would\r\nhide, and would return to the emperor, and would tell him that Magellan\r\nhad got them entrapped and deceived, having broken faith with his\r\ninstructions, since he was navigating in seas and countries of the King\r\nof Portugal: for which deed they would get first a safe conduct from\r\nthe emperor. So they arranged matters for their treason, which turned\r\nout ill for them.”\r\n\r\n“Magellan had some suspicion of this matter, and before this should\r\nhappen, he sent his skiff to the ships to tell the captains that the\r\nmasters were to arrange their ships for beaching them to careen them;\r\nand with this pretext he warned a servant of his to notice what the\r\ncaptains answered. When this skiff came to the revolted ships they\r\ndid not let it come alongside, saying that they would not execute any\r\norders except those of Juan de Cartagena, who was their captain-major.\r\nThe skiff having returned with this answer, Magellan spoke to Ambrosio\r\nFernandes,[456] his chief constable, a valiant man, and gave him orders\r\nwhat he was to do, and to go secretly armed; and he sent a letter to\r\nLuis de Mendoça by him, with six men in the skiff, whom the chief\r\nconstable selected. And the current set towards the ships, and Magellan\r\nordered his master to bend a long hawser,[457] with which he might drop\r\ndown to the ships if it suited him. All being thus arranged, the skiff\r\nwent, and coming alongside of Luiz de Mendoça, they would not let him\r\ncome on board. So the chief constable said to the captain that it was\r\nweakness not to bid him enter, as he was one man alone who was bringing\r\na letter. Upon which the captain bade him enter. He came on board, and\r\ngiving him the letter, took him in his arms, shouting: ‘On behalf of\r\nthe emperor, you are arrested!’ At this the men of the skiff came on\r\nboard with their swords drawn; then the chief constable cut the throat\r\nof Luis de Mendoça with a dagger, for he held him thrown down under\r\nhim, for so Magellan had given him orders. Upon this a tumult arose,\r\nand Magellan hearing it, ordered the hawser to be paid out, and with\r\nhis ship dropped down upon the other ships, with his men under arms,\r\nand the artillery in readiness. On reaching the ship of Mendoça, he\r\nordered six men to be hung at the yard-arms, who had risen up against\r\nthe chief constable, and these were seized upon by the sailors of the\r\nship, of which he at once made captain, Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese,\r\nand a friend of his: and he ordered the corpse of Mendoça to be hung\r\nup by the feet, that they might see him from the other ships. He then\r\nordered Barbosa to prepare the men for going and boarding one of the\r\nother ships; and to avoid doing the harm which it was in its power to\r\nhave done, and since he was a Portuguese, and the crews belonged to the\r\nemperor, he used a stratagem, and spoke secretly to a sailor, whom he\r\ntrusted, who fled to the ship of Cartagena, where, at night when the\r\ncurrent set for Magellan’s ship, which was astern, the sailor seeing\r\nhis opportunity, cut the cable or loosed the ship of Cartagena, so that\r\nit drifted upon that of Magellan, who came up, shouting: ‘Treason!\r\ntreason!’ Upon which he entered the ship of Cartagena, and took him and\r\nhis men prisoners, and made captain of the ship one Alvaro de Mesquita,\r\nwhom Cartagena had arrested and put in irons, because he found fault\r\nwith him for the mutiny which he was making. Seeing this, the other\r\nship at once surrendered. He ordered Cartagena to be quartered, having\r\nhim publicly cried as a traitor; and the body of Luis de Mendoça also\r\nwas quartered; and he ordered the quarters and the executed men to\r\nbe set on shore, spitted on poles. So the Castilians had great fear\r\nof him, for he kept the mutineers prisoners in irons, and set to the\r\npumps, during three months that he remained in this river, in which he\r\ncareened and refitted his ships very well.”\r\n\r\n“When he was about to set sail, he ordered the prisoners to be set at\r\nliberty, and pardoned them, and he sent them to go along the shore,\r\nfollowing the bank of the river until they found the headland from\r\nwhich they could see the sea on the other side; and whoever returned\r\nto him with this news he would give him a hundred ducats as a reward\r\nfor good news. These men went for more than forty leagues, and returned\r\nwithout news; and they brought back two men, fifteen spans high, from a\r\nvillage which they found. He then sent Serrano, because his vessel was\r\nthe smallest, to go along the river to discover its extremity; and he\r\nwent with a strong current, which carried him without wind. And, going\r\nalong thus, his ship grounded on some rocks, on which it was lost, and\r\nthe boat returned laden with the crew. Magellan sent the boats thither,\r\nand they saved everything, so that only the hull was lost. Then he\r\nordered two priests, who had taken part in the mutiny, to be set on\r\nshore, and a brother of Cartagena, whom he pardoned at the petition of\r\nMesquita, and he left them thus banished.”\r\n\r\n“Then he sailed from the river and ran along the coast until he reached\r\na river, to which they gave the name of Victoria, and which had high\r\nland on either side. From this river Mesquita’s ship ran away, and it\r\nwas not known whether they had killed him, or if he had gone of his own\r\naccord; but an astrologer and diviner told him that the captain was a\r\nprisoner, and that they were returning to Castile, but that the emperor\r\nwould do them an injury.”\r\n\r\n“Then Magellan, with the three ships which he had, entered the river,\r\nthrough which he ran for more than a hundred leagues, and came out on\r\nthe other side into the open sea, where he had a stern wind from the\r\neast, with which they ran for more than five months without lowering\r\ntheir sails, and they fetched some uninhabited islands, in one of which\r\nthey found some savages, who lived in huts underground. They went to\r\nanother island where they gave them gold for its weight of iron, by\r\nwhich means they collected much gold: the people also were of a good\r\ndisposition, and had a king. They were well governed people, who were\r\nat war with other neighbours who were more powerful than themselves;\r\nfor which reason the king became Christian, with all his people, in\r\norder that Magellan might assist him against his enemies. This Magellan\r\noffered to do, and with his armed men, and the people of the country,\r\nhe went against the enemy, of whom he killed many, and burned a\r\nvillage. The enemy got assistance from others, and many came to fight\r\nwith Magellan, who defeated them, and the struggle was a severe one.\r\nThey acted with cunning, for they had placed ambuscades of men hidden\r\nin the bush, who, seeing the Castilians wearied, came out against them\r\nand killed many, and another ambuscade came out of the bush to seize\r\nthe boats, which were on the beach without men: then the king came out,\r\nand fought with them, and defended the boats, and brought off the men.”\r\n\r\n“The king who had fled, seeing himself defeated, plotted treachery\r\nwith the Christian king, and made an agreement with him to give him\r\nhis daughter in marriage, and plighted his troth to him, that when he\r\ndied, for he was already old, all would remain to him, and they would\r\nalways live as friends; because the Castilians would depart, and if he\r\ndid not act thus he would always make war on him: and this was with the\r\ncondition that he was to find him means for killing the Castilians. And\r\nthe Christian king, like a brutal man, consented to the treachery, and\r\nprepared a great feast and banquet for carrying it out, to which he\r\ninvited Magellan, who went to the banquet with thirty men, of the most\r\nhonourable and well dressed: while they were enjoying themselves at the\r\nbanquet, the armed enemies entered, and killed Magellan, and all the\r\nCastilians, and none of them escaped, and they stripped Serrano, and\r\ndragging him along, brought him to the beach, where they executed him,\r\nand killed him thrown down on the ground.[458]”\r\n\r\n“Those who were in the ships, seeing the misfortune on shore, which\r\nthe sailors who had gone in the boats related to them, raised up from\r\namong them as captain, Carvalhinho, the pilot of the flag-ship, whom\r\nall obeyed. He ordered one of the ships, which was very leaky, to be\r\nstripped, and set fire to it in the midst of the sea, so that the\r\npeople on shore should not profit by the iron, and he made captain of\r\nthe ship of Serrano one Gonzalo Gomez d’Espinosa, who was a relation of\r\nthe astrologer,[459] who also died with Magellan, and did not divine\r\nthe evil which befel him.”\r\n\r\n“The two ships departed thence, running between many islands, and they\r\nwent to one which had much very fine cinnamon. From this place they\r\nwent running through many islands to the island of Borneo, where they\r\nfound in the port many merchant junks from all the parts of Malacca,\r\nwhich made frequent visits to Borneo. Here Carvalhinho sent a present\r\nto the king of scarlet cloth, and coloured silks, and other things,\r\nwith which the king was much pleased, and he did him great honour, and\r\ngave him leave and safe conduct to remain on shore for twenty days, for\r\nsuch was their custom to give to new people, the first time that they\r\ncame to their port, in which they could buy and sell freely as much as\r\nthey pleased. But the king, knowing how much goods the ships contained,\r\ngot up a plot to kill them, and take the ships. This treachery was\r\nconcerted by the king with the Javanese who were in the port in large\r\njunks; and for this object the king showed great honour to those who\r\nwent on shore, and sent refreshments to the ships, and leave to remain\r\nin the port as long as they pleased. Carvalhinho became suspicious\r\nat this, and ordered good watch to be kept day and night, and did\r\nnot allow more than one or two men to go ashore. The king perceiving\r\nthis sent to beg Carvalhinho to send him his son who had brought the\r\npresent, because his little children who had seen him, were crying\r\nto see him. He sent him, very well dressed, with four men, who, on\r\narriving where the king was, were ordered by him to be arrested. When\r\nCarvalhinho knew this he raised his moorings, and with armed men went\r\nto board a junk which was filled with many people and ready to sail.\r\nThey entered this junk and plundered much gold and rich stuffs, and\r\ncaptured a son of the King of Luzon, who was captain of the junk and of\r\nthree others which were in the port, and who had come in them to marry\r\na daughter of this King of Borneo. They found in this junk valuable\r\nthings of gold and jewellery which he had brought for his wedding; and\r\nthey found there three girls of extreme beauty, whom Carvalhinho took\r\ncare of, saying that he would take them to the emperor: at which all\r\nrejoiced. But he did not act thus, but slept with them, so that the\r\nCastilians were near killing him; but he divided with the Castilians so\r\nliberally that they became friends; for he agreed with the bridegroom,\r\nthat he and his people should escape by night, and for that should\r\ngive him much wealth of precious stones, and by night they got away by\r\nswimming; and Carvalhinho pretended to have been asleep, and woke up\r\ncomplaining of the watch. But the Castilians understood the deceit, and\r\ntook Carvalhinho and put him in irons, and took from him all he had,\r\nand raised up as captain one Juan Bautista, master of the ship, because\r\nhe understood pilot’s work.[460]”\r\n\r\n“Thence they sailed and went to Maluco, Ternate, and Tidore, where\r\nthey took to the kings the presents which Magellan had set apart for\r\nthem. They paid them great honour, and received them hospitably,\r\nfor they also gave to their ministers; and to the kings they gave\r\nan embassage on the part of the emperor, relating to them his\r\nmagnificence, so that both soon obeyed him, and did homage as vassals\r\nfor ever; and they established trade and prices for buying and selling,\r\nand established factories on shore, and began to collect cloves, and\r\nvery much was brought to them, because the Castilians gave what they\r\nasked, for they had a superfluity of merchandise; thus they became\r\nlords of the land. As the ships were much injured, they patched them\r\nup a little, the best they could, and hastened to fill both ships with\r\ncargo, which they did in one month. When they were about to sail there\r\ncame to the Castilians a Portuguese, named Juan de la Rosa, who had\r\ncome to Ternate, saying he was a pilot, and would take them to Castile,\r\nupon which they agreed with him to give him fifty quintals of cloves in\r\neach ship, because he said he would take them to the island of Banda,\r\nwhich had more riches than Maluco. So the Castilians rejoiced greatly\r\nat taking this man back to the emperor, for the greater certainty as\r\nto their discovery. This Juan de la Rosa warned the Castilians that\r\nthey would come from India and seek for them, and kill them all, for\r\nthis was spoken of in India. To this the Castilians gave much credit,\r\nand on that account did him great honour. They settled with the King\r\nof Tidore to leave with him a factor with the merchandise, which they\r\nhad, because many ships would soon come, sent by the emperor; for which\r\nreason they should have much cloves collected together. They then set\r\nsail, making de la Rosa captain of the ship of Carvalhinho.”\r\n\r\n“When they were at sea they freed him from his irons, from the need\r\nthey felt for his navigation, and they went to the island of Banda,\r\nwhere they restored to Carvalhinho his captaincy, and they went to\r\nBanda, where they took samples of nutmeg and mace, as they had nowhere\r\nto take in cargo of it. All having been consulted, they set sail to\r\nmake for the Cape of Good Hope, and navigate thence to Castile, for\r\nthey did not dare take any other course. Setting sail with this design,\r\nthey met with hard weather, with which the ship of Carvalhinho put into\r\nport, and that of la Rosa continued her course. Carvalhinho put into\r\nMaluco, where he discharged half the ship’s cargo, and heeled her over,\r\nand repaired her as well as possible; this he did in twenty days, and\r\nagain set to taking in cargo and departing; but he fell ill with the\r\nlabour, and died on setting sail. They made Gonzalo Gomez d’Espinosa\r\ncaptain of the ship again, and he, by the instructions of Carvalhinho,\r\ntook a course to search for the river (strait) through which they had\r\ncome; but when at sea, the ship again took in so much water, that they\r\nran before the wind to beach her on the first land they made, which\r\nwas in Batochina, where they beached the ship, and saved from her no\r\ngreat quantity of goods. Whilst they were at this juncture D. Gracia\r\nAnriques arrived at Maluco, with a ship to take in cloves, which came\r\nfrom Malaca, and learning how these Castilians were there he sent to\r\ncall them under his safe conduct, that they should all come, because if\r\nthey did not he would hold them as enemies, and would go at once and\r\nfetch them. The Castilians therefore, constrained by fortune, went to\r\nwhere D. Gracia was, like as men who were lost, so that D. Gracia had\r\ncompassion upon them, and gave them a good reception, and supplied them\r\nwith necessaries, and having laden his ship, he embarked them all with\r\nhim, and they were more than thirty, and he took them to Malaca, where\r\nJorge d’Albuquerque was captain, who ordered the factor to give them\r\nprovisions for their maintenance, and in the monsoon to send them to\r\nIndia, where D. Duarte [de Meneses] was governor. He commanded those\r\nwho chose to be written down in the rolls for pay, and he forbade\r\nthe ships of the kingdom to take them, that they might not return to\r\nCastile; and in fact all died, only Gonzalo Gomes d’Espinosa passed to\r\nPortugal in the year 1525, and he was made a prisoner in Lisbon, and\r\nset at liberty by a letter which the empress sent to the king.”\r\n\r\n“The other ship followed its course, so that la Rosa made the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, and while she was going near the land Pero Coresma, who was\r\ngoing to India in a small ship, met her, and spoke her; and he was told\r\nshe belonged to the emperor, and came from Maluco, and it did not come\r\ninto his understanding to send her to the bottom, that she might not\r\nreturn to Castile, and the ship entered the watering place of Saldanha,\r\nand thence fetched Cape Verde, where they went ashore to get wood and\r\nwater; there some Portuguese, learning that the ship came from Maluco,\r\ntook the boat when it came ashore, with twenty Castilians; and as\r\nthere was no ship in the port they got into a boat to go and capture\r\nthe ship; but the ship seeing the boat come with armed men, for the\r\narms glittered, weighed and set sail for Cape St. Vincent, and thence\r\nentered San Lucar with thirteen men, for now there were no more, and it\r\narrived in the year 1521. From Cape Verde they wrote to the king about\r\nthe Castilians, who remained there; the king ordered that they should\r\nlet them go till they died, but never to allow them to embark for any\r\nport; and so it was done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COST OF MAGELLAN’S FLEET.\r\n\r\n                 _From Navarrete_, Document No. XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Conception_ was of ninety tons.\r\n     „  _Victoria_      „   eighty-five tons.\r\n     „  _S.

See Palfrey’s _Hist. of New England_, vol. i, pp. 502,\r\n      503.\r\n\r\n[4] “Escoras.”\r\n\r\n[5] “Perdeo sua pobreza.”\r\n\r\n[6] “Moradia.”\r\n\r\n[7] Albuquerque did not arrive before Goa till the 24th November.\r\n      Correa, tom. II, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[8] A facsimile of this signature is given in the plate.\r\n\r\n[9] This document has been abridged here; it is taken from a copy\r\n      in the Torre do Tombo, made from another copy, which is very\r\n      illegible. The Spanish is rather antiquated, and much debased,\r\n      apparently by Portuguese copyists, who have mixed up their own\r\n      orthography. The Secretary’s name was Francisco, not Fernan.\r\n\r\n[10] From this it appears that Magellan anticipated that America would\r\n      end like Africa.\r\n\r\n[11] D. Jorge of Portugal, Bishop of Siguenza.\r\n\r\n[12] The date of the year is not given; however, as the despatch\r\n      mentions this year as the year of the marriage, it must be\r\n      assumed to have been written in 1518. D. Manuel married the\r\n      daughter of Philip I, Da. Leonor, in Villa do Crato, 24th\r\n      November, 1518. The treaty of the marriage was made at Saragossa\r\n      22nd May, 1518, and ratified in Saragossa 16th July, 1518.\r\n\r\n[13] Literally, the road to Coimbra.\r\n\r\n[14] Meaning, he could become a hermit.\r\n\r\n[15] This contemporary document confirms Osorio as to the cause of\r\n      Magellan’s being disgusted with the King of Portugal; some\r\n      historians have represented the quarrel as arising from a\r\n      distribution of plundered cattle. Gaspar Correa uses a similar\r\n      phrase to that in this despatch, “a hundred reis, more or less”.\r\n\r\n[16] Compare this statement with that in the second line of the fifth\r\n      paragraph of this despatch.\r\n\r\n[17] Diego Ribeiro was, later, the cosmographer of Charles V, and,\r\n      with Martin Centurion in 1524, he translated into Spanish the\r\n      Book of Duarte Barbosa and Magellan on the coasts of the Indian\r\n      Ocean.\r\n\r\n[18] _Id est_, never be heard of again.

Sevilla, por\r\n      Juan Cronberger, 1535. 4to.” This book is very rare; there is a\r\n      copy in the Hydrographer’s office at Madrid.\r\n\r\n[23] This name is omitted in the prologue of the edition of 1536.\r\n\r\n[24] Greswell, _A View of the Early Parisian Greek Press_, vol. i, p.\r\n      94.\r\n\r\n[25] The 10th of August was a Wednesday, and Monday was the 8th of\r\n      August: all the other dates of the week and month agree and are\r\n      consistent with each other.\r\n\r\n[26] According to Albo’s Log-Book; according to Pigafetta, May 6.\r\n\r\n[27] These dates are according to the ship’s time, which differed by a\r\n      day from the time at the Cape Verde Islands and Seville.\r\n\r\n[28] Pigafetta says the fleet went out of Seville on the 10th of\r\n      August, 1519; that it sailed from S. Lucar on the 20th of\r\n      September, and reached Tenerife on the 26th, and continued its\r\n      voyage thence on the 3rd of October, navigating to the South.\r\n      _Lisbon Academy note._\r\n\r\n[29] The Paris MS. has “south-west.” This must be the true reading.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._ The Madrid MS. also has south-west.\r\n\r\n[30] Pigafetta mentions this river, which is the Plata, in 34 deg. 20\r\n      min. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[31] Paris MS. “And they found themselves amongst some shoals.”\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._ The Madrid MS. is the same.\r\n\r\n[32] Paris MS. “is in 24 degrees,” which seems clearly an error of\r\n      the copyists. _Lisbon Ac. note._ The Madrid MS. is in this case\r\n      similar to the Paris MS.\r\n\r\n[33] Paris MS. “the bay.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ Madrid MS. “the bay.”\r\n\r\n[34] We have not found mention of this name of “Bahia dos trabalhos”\r\n      in any other writer. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[35] Pigafetta puts this port in 49 deg. 30 min. The Transylvan in 49\r\n      and ⅓; Barros in 50 deg., and says they arrived there on the 2nd\r\n      of April. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[36] Paris MS. “eight hours.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ The Madrid MS. has\r\n      “seven hours.”\r\n\r\n[37] The ship _Victoria_.\r\n\r\n[38] The ship _Conception_.\r\n\r\n[39] Alvaro de Mesquita was a cousin of Magellan.\r\n\r\n[40] The ship which was here lost was the _Santiago_, the captain of\r\n      which was Joāo Serrāo. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[41] There seems to be some mistake here or transcriber’s error. It\r\n      is seen by the narrative that the navigators, having arrived at\r\n      Port St. Julian at the end of March, or beginning of April, and\r\n      going out of it on the 24th of August, they wintered there for\r\n      the space of four months and twenty-four days, and this is what\r\n      Pigafetta says: “they passed there nearly five months.” _Lisbon\r\n      Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[42] “E havia delles ao sull 73 gr. menos 10 minutos.” It has been\r\n      impossible for us to understand the calculations of the writer\r\n      in this place. _Lisbon Ac. note._ A possible explanation of this\r\n      passage may be found in a passage of Castanheda, lib. 6, cap. 13,\r\n      which describes St. Julian as distant from Seville 71 deg. from\r\n      North to South, and this calculation would refer to the distance\r\n      from Seville.\r\n\r\n[43] The anonymous Portuguese, the companion of Duarte Barbosa, says\r\n      they gave it the name of “Santa Cruz,” because they arrived there\r\n      the 14th of September, the day of the Exaltation of the Holy\r\n      Cross. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[44] In the _Illustrated News_ of March 27th, 1869, there is a drawing\r\n      of some Patagonians: these are represented almost exactly as they\r\n      are described in the text, for some of them have their shoulders\r\n      bare, and the skins let down below the waist as here described.\r\n\r\n[45] Probably in the ship which fled away, as will be mentioned later.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[46] Amoretti, the editor of Pigafetta, observes, that whilst the\r\n      fleet was in the river of Santa Cruz, between 50 deg. and 40 deg.\r\n      South latitude, there was, on the 11th of October, an eclipse of\r\n      the Sun, “_which_ (he says) _the Portuguese and Spanish writers\r\n      mention, and which is registered in the astronomical tables_:”\r\n      and he judges it to be an error of Castanheda putting this\r\n      phenomenon on the 17th of April, and his attributing to Magellan\r\n      the calculation of longitude of which he speaks. Barros also\r\n      mentions an eclipse of the sun in April. It is noteworthy that\r\n      neither our pilot’s narrative nor Pigafetta mentions a phenomenon\r\n      which still in those times did not happen without causing some\r\n      impression on men’s minds, or at least without exciting public\r\n      curiosity. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n      I am indebted to the courtesy of the Astronomer Royal, Mr. G. B.\r\n      Airy, for the following information, which confirms Castanheda\r\n      and Barros: “1520, April 17. There was certainly (from our own\r\n      calculations) a total solar eclipse about 1.20 +P.M.+ Greenwich\r\n      time. But in the Art de verifier les dates, in which the extreme\r\n      Southern eclipses are not included, none is mentioned for April\r\n      17: consequently the eclipse was a Southern eclipse, crossing the\r\n      South Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n[47] This is the famous strait which till this day is named the Strait\r\n      of Magellan, for the eternal and glorious memory of the famous\r\n      Portuguese who discovered it. Castanheda says that Magellan, on\r\n      account of arriving there on the 1st of November, gave it the\r\n      name of All Saints’ bay, and in the answer which André de S.\r\n      Martin gave to the inquiries made to him about that navigation,\r\n      he also names the channel that of All Saints’ (Barros, Dec. 3,\r\n      liv. 5, cap. 9). The anonymous Portuguese, the companion of\r\n      Duarte Barbosa, whom we have quoted above, and who sailed in\r\n      the “Victoria,” says that at first the navigators called it the\r\n      Strait of the Victoria, because that ship was the first which\r\n      sighted it. (Ramusio, 3rd edition, tom. i. page 370). _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[48] Alvaro de Mesquita, a Portuguese, and cousin of Magellan, was\r\n      captain of this ship which went to explore the passages of the\r\n      Straits, and did not return, and its pilot was Estevan Gomes,\r\n      also a Portuguese. This Estevan Gomes had been requesting the\r\n      Emperor Charles V. to confide to him a few caravels to go and\r\n      discover new lands; but as the proposal and enterprise of\r\n      Mazellan then interposed itself, and was preferred and accepted,\r\n      Estevan Gomes continued after that to be a great enemy of the\r\n      illustrious captain, and now profited by the opportunity to\r\n      revenge himself on him, and to give vent to his rabid envy. He\r\n      conspired, therefore, with others against the captain of his\r\n      ship, Alvaro de Mesquita; they put him in irons, and brought him\r\n      thus to Spain with the ship, telling the Emperor _that Magellan\r\n      was crazy, and had lied to His Majesty, because he did not\r\n      know where Banda was, nor Maluco_. Besides this, they brought\r\n      accusations against Mesquita of having counselled and persuaded\r\n      Magellan to use the severity and cruelty with which he punished\r\n      the first conspirators, etc. (V. the Letter of Transylvanus and\r\n      Castanheda, liv. 6, cap. 8). _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[49] The ships _S. Antonio_ and _Conception_ were sent on this\r\n      exploration of the Straits; they were with difficulty able to\r\n      double the Cape Possession, named thus in Bougainville’s map,\r\n      and in others. They at length entered a narrow opening, which in\r\n      the maps is named the first gut, and they proceeded thence to\r\n      another bay, which is named Boucant bay, or Boucam. At the end of\r\n      this they entered into another strait, named the second gut, and\r\n      having passed that, they came out into another bay larger than\r\n      the former ones. Then, seeing that the strait was prolonged and\r\n      offered an outlet to the ships, they returned with the good news\r\n      to Magellan, who was waiting for them, and on seeing him, they\r\n      fired off all their artillery and shouted for joy. The fleet then\r\n      sailed together as far as the third bay, and as they found two\r\n      channels, Magellan despatched the two vessels, _S. Antonio_ and\r\n      _Conception_, to examine whether the channel, which took the S.W.\r\n      direction, would issue into the Pacific sea. Here it was that the\r\n      ship _S. Antonio_ deserted, going ahead of its companion for that\r\n      purpose. The other two ships, _Victoria_ and _Trinity_, meanwhile\r\n      entered the third channel, where they waited four days for the\r\n      explorers. During this interval, Magellan despatched a well\r\n      equipped boat to discover the cape with which the strait ought to\r\n      terminate: this having been sighted, and the boat returning with\r\n      the news, all shed tears of consolation, and they gave to this\r\n      cape the name of Cape Desire; it is that which is at the outlet\r\n      of the strait on the South side. They then turned back to seek\r\n      for the ships _Conception_ and _S. Antonio_, and leaving marks\r\n      by which this one might steer, in case of its having lost the\r\n      way (for they were still ignorant of its desertion), they sailed\r\n      forward until they came out into the Pacific Ocean. _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[50] The Paris Manuscript has “fully in 52 degrees.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[51] Pigafetta remarks: In the strait in which they were, in the month\r\n      of October, the night was only of three hours; and Transylvan\r\n      says that, in November the navigators found the night of little\r\n      more than five hours; and that on one night they saw to the left\r\n      hand many fires. It is from this that that country came to be\r\n      called _Terra do fogo_. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[52] The Paris MS. has, and also others which were, &c. Pigafetta\r\n      places these two islands in 15 deg. and 9 deg. South latitude.\r\n      See Amoretti’s note, p. 45, upon their situation, in which he\r\n      supposes them to be in the archipelago of the Society Islands.\r\n      In some maps they are designated by the name of _Infortunadas_.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[53] Some writers remark that Magellan gave to these islands the name\r\n      of _Ilhas das velas_, on account of the many vessels with sails\r\n      which he observed in that neighbourhood. But they continued\r\n      to be commonly called _Ladrones_; later they took the name of\r\n      _Mariannas_, in honour of the Queen D. Marianna of Austria, widow\r\n      of Philip IV, and Regent during the minority of D. Carlos II. of\r\n      Castile. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[54] _Parós_: so our manuscripts always write it. In the edition of\r\n      Pigafetta it is constantly written _praós_. It is the same kind\r\n      of vessel that our writers of the affairs of Asia name _paraó_,\r\n      which is of various sizes, and is much used in the South Sea\r\n      Islands. Pigafetta says it is a kind of fusta or galliot. _Lisbon\r\n      Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[55] The Paris manuscript has “much refreshments of fruit.” _Lisbon\r\n      Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[56] “A primeira;” the Paris manuscript has “da primeira;” this means,\r\n      which was first sighted. See the _Relation of Pigafetta_,\r\n      _Amoretti_, p. 54, March 16, 1521. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[57] Pigafetta says: “We named the watering place of _Good Signs_,\r\n      because here we found two springs of excellent water, and the\r\n      first signs of there being gold in the country.” _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[58] Paris MS. _Guoroos._ _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[59] Paris, “Chinas.”\r\n\r\n[60] Paris MS.: “To which they gave the name of Archipelago of St.\r\n      Lazarus.” We suspect there is some error of the copyist here\r\n      in our text, not only on account of the novelty of the name\r\n      _Vall Sem Periguo_, but also on account of its impropriety. The\r\n      Paris MS. says simply Archipelago of St. Lazarus. Pigafetta\r\n      also says, “They gave the name of Archipelago of St. Lazarus,”\r\n      as they arrived there on the 5th Sunday of Lent, which is named\r\n      of Lazarus. Now, these islands are named Philippines, which was\r\n      given them in the year 1542, in honour of D. Philip of Austria,\r\n      son of Charles V, and afterwards King of Castile. They are\r\n      between 225 deg. and 235 deg. W. long. of Ferro, consequently\r\n      between 195 deg. and 205 deg. from the line of demarcation.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[61] Paris MS.; “They ran a matter of 25 leagues from that.”\r\n\r\n[62] Madrid MS., 9 degrees.\r\n\r\n[63] Paris MS., Maçaguoa. Madrid MS., Maquamguoa.\r\n\r\n[64] It appears this cross was set up in the island of Massaua, where\r\n      Mass was celebrated on the last day of March, which in this year\r\n      was Easter Sunday. The island is set down by Pigafetta in 9 deg.\r\n      40 min., and the editor puts it in 192 deg. W. long. from the\r\n      line of demarcation.\r\n\r\n[65] This island, which is named and written Cabo in both MSS., is the\r\n      island Zebu, one of the Philippines, which others write Çabu,\r\n      Zabu, Subsuth, Zubut, Cubo, Subo, and Zubo, for it is found in\r\n      all these forms in different writings. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[66] Paris MS.: “And burned a village of those who would not yield the\r\n      said obedience.” The narrative of Pigafetta states: “He burned\r\n      twenty or thirty houses of the village.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[67] Pigafetta says: “We were 60 armed men, 48 went on shore with\r\n      Magellan; the 11 remained to guard the boats.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[68] Paris MS.: “And went against the said place, and it was on the\r\n      27th day of April.” Pigafetta also places this event on the 27th\r\n      of April, and observes that it was on _Saturday_, which in truth\r\n      took place that year on the 27th, and not on the 28th of April.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[69] Pigafetta says: “With eight of our men there perished four\r\n      Indians of those who had become Christians, and we had many\r\n      wounded, I being one of them; of the enemy there fell only\r\n      fifteen men.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[70] Pigafetta says: “We then chose instead of the captain, Duarte\r\n      Barbosa, a Portuguese, his relation, and John Serrano, a\r\n      Spaniard. The first commanded the flagship.”\r\n\r\n[71] Paris MS.: “They killed the two captains, and also 26 men with\r\n      them.” It was on this occasion that Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese,\r\n      and brother-in-law of Magellan, was killed. He was one of the\r\n      captains here mentioned. Some of our writers have said, or\r\n      conjectured, that Duarte Barbosa was killed by poison; but this\r\n      is a mistake. The barbarians, indeed, drew the Castilians ashore\r\n      under the pretext of giving them a banquet, but it does not\r\n      follow from that that they poisoned them. The Transylvan says:\r\n      _inter epulandum, ab iis, qui in insidiis collocati fuerant,\r\n      opprimuntur. Fit clamor undique: nuntiatur protinus in navibus\r\n      nostros occisos._ See Barros, 3, 5, 10. The other captain, who\r\n      was John Serrano, was not killed, but remained alive in the\r\n      hands of the barbarians at the time the boats made off, because,\r\n      notwithstanding the most mournful supplications which he made\r\n      from the shore for rescue, Joan Lopes de Carvalho feared further\r\n      treachery, and ordered the anchor to be weighed. _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[72] Paris MS.: “One Yoam Lopez de Carvalho.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[73] Paris MS.: “Gonzalo Gomez Despinosa.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[74] Barros says 180 men, and this seems more probable, considering\r\n      the number of the men who sailed in the fleet and of those who\r\n      might then have been lost, and those who were lost later, and\r\n      also of those who at last reached Ternate and Europe. _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._ The Madrid MS. has 180 men, written in full, “Semte he\r\n      oytēta homēs.”\r\n\r\n[75] Pigafetta says they burned the ship _Conception_.\r\n\r\n[76] Paris MS., “Quype.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[77] Paris MS. has “two islets.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[78] Paris MS.: “which is named Cagujam, and is in seven degrees; from\r\n      this they went on further to the West North-west.” _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._ Madrid MS. seven degrees.\r\n\r\n[79] Paris MS., “to the North-east.” Madrid MS., “North-east.” The\r\n      Lisbon Academy copyist has North-west, and has mistaken the Paris\r\n      MS. on this point.\r\n\r\n[80] This position seems to indicate the island of Palavan, which\r\n      Pigafetta places in 9 deg. 20 min. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[81] Paris MS., “Degameāo.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ Madrid MS., “Dygamçam.”\r\n\r\n[82] Paris MS., “ypalajra cara canāo.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ I read this,\r\n      “y palay cu cara canāo:” the Madrid MS. has “fulay cucara cabam.”\r\n      The word _palay_, Tagal for rice, and the next sentence in the\r\n      text seem to indicate that an offer to trade was mistaken for the\r\n      name of this island.\r\n\r\n[83] Paris MS., “one hundredweight and fourteen pounds.” _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[84] Paris MS., “Digaçāo;” it is also written Digamcā and Digāçā.\r\n      _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[85] Paris MS., “21st day of June.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ Madrid MS.,\r\n      “21st day of June.”\r\n\r\n[86] Paris MS. “The island to the North is named Bolava, and that to\r\n      the South Bamdill.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ Madrid MS., “Bolina and\r\n      Bamdill.”\r\n\r\n[87] Paris MS., “the neighbourhood of the port of Borneo.” _Lisbon Ac.\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[88] Paris MS., “Gonzalo Gomez Despinosa.”\r\n\r\n[89] Paris MS., “with seventeen men.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ I read\r\n      twenty-seven in the Paris MS.\r\n\r\n[90] _Sem se aproveitar nada delle_, or, without their having made any\r\n      use of it.\r\n\r\n[91] Paris MS. “And so remained a matter of fourteen hours, for it was\r\n      low water, by which it was clearly seen that the tide was of\r\n      fourteen hours.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[92] Paris MS., “Cagamja.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[93] Paris MS., “Solloque.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[94] Paris MS., “Tamgyma.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[95] Paris MS., “Sagu.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[96] Paris MS., “Samyns.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[97] Paris MS., “light.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ The Paris MS. seems to me\r\n      to have “fresquo,” and not “ffraquo.”\r\n\r\n[98] Paris MS., “Calibes.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[99] Paris MS., “five hundred.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[100] Paris MS., “in these discussions.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[101] Paris MS. “of Tidore.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[102] Pigafetta says: “On Friday, 8th of November, 1521, three hours\r\n      before sunset, we entered the port of an island called Tadore\r\n      ... 27 months less two days had passed that we had been seeking\r\n      Maluco.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[103] Pigafetta puts this island in 0 deg. 27 min. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[104] In the Paris MS. this word _tem_ is wanting. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[105] Paris MS., “another bahar.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[106] Paris MS., “Tarnate.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[107] This clause seems to have been added to the text by the copyist;\r\n      because the fortress of Ternate was only begun in the year\r\n      1522, on St. John’s day, when Antonio de Brito was captain.\r\n      (Castanheda, 1. 6, cap. 12). _Lisbon Ac. note._ This clause may\r\n      belong to the writer, the pilot, since he mentions the fortress\r\n      and Antonio de Brito later, subsequent to July of 1522.\r\n\r\n[108] The Portuguese here mentioned seems to be Pedro Affonso de\r\n      Lourosa, who betrayed the Portuguese and passed over to the\r\n      Castilians, according to Pigafetta’s account. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[109] Paris MS., “Bargāo.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ I read this Bachāo; this\r\n      is the correct spelling.\r\n\r\n[110] The flagship was the _Trinidade_. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[111] Pigafetta says the King sent five divers, and afterwards three\r\n      more, who could not stop the water. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[112] Pigafetta sailed in this ship the _Victoria_. The _Trinidade_,\r\n      after refitting, took the opposite course and sailed for Yucatan\r\n      and the isthmus of Darien, which is here called _land of the\r\n      Antilles_; but it found itself obliged to put back to the\r\n      Moluccas, and whilst about to discharge its cargo at Ternate, was\r\n      cast on shore. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[113] Paris MS., “Tydore.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ The correct reading.\r\n\r\n[114] Paris MS., “North-north-east.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[115] Paris MS., “Domy.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[116] Paris MS. “The large one is named Chāol, and the small one\r\n      Pyliom.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[117] Paris MS., “Quemarre.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[118] Paris MS., “_agoa_,” water, but _hava_ or _ava_ is a drink used\r\n      in those countries. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[119] Paris MS., “Camarro.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[120] Paris MS., “25th.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[121] Paris MS., “steered seventeen leagues eastwards.” _Lisbon Academy\r\n      note._\r\n\r\n[122] Paris MS., “Chao.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[123] Paris MS., “Batechina.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[124] Paris MS., “West.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[125] Paris MS., “islands of St. John:” it also says they made them on\r\n      the 6th. _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[126] Paris MS., “Chyquom.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[127] Paris MS., “11th of June.” _Lisbon Ac. note._ July will be the\r\n      correct reading.\r\n\r\n[128] Paris MS., “Magregua.” _Lisbon Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[129] Paris MS., “Māo.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[130] Paris MS., “the black man and three Christians.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[131] Paris MS., “Gelolo.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[132] Paris MS., “certain men with letters.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[133] Paris MS., “Dom Garcia.” Garcia, and not Gonzalo, was the name of\r\n      this gentleman.

It seems that the person who wrote\r\n      it made some mistake, owing to there having been many gentlemen\r\n      of the name of Menezes at that time in India.... D. Henrique de\r\n      Menezes succeeded Vasco da Gama, in 1524, as Governor of India,\r\n      and therefore could not be the D. Amrique de Menezes who came to\r\n      the kingdom in 1524, as the note says. This deserving Governor\r\n      died at Cananor on the day of the Purification of 1526. _Lisbon\r\n      Ac. note._\r\n\r\n[137] Son Seigneur osservatissime.\r\n\r\n[138] Charles V was elected Emperor the 28th June, 1519.\r\n\r\n[139] Chiericato.

Pigafetta has taken care\r\n      to mark in his map of the island of Borneo, his voyage of fifty\r\n      leagues from the point to the port, and has placed Laöe at the\r\n      southern point of the island.

Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[362] The islands here mentioned belong to that group in which modern\r\n      geographers reckon Kararotan, Linop, and Cabrocana; after which\r\n      is found Sanghir, the beautiful island of the author: others\r\n      name it Sanguil. This island has many islets to the S.W., which\r\n      Pigafetta mentions later. Cabiu, Cabalussu, Limpang, and Nussa,\r\n      are mentioned in the list of islands which in 1682 belonged to\r\n      the King of Ternate. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[363] In the list of islands belonging to the King of Ternate, are\r\n      found Karkitang, Para, Sangaluhan, Siau.\r\n\r\n[364] Pangazara, Talaut, and Mahono, are in the above quoted list.\r\n\r\n[365] Tidore.\r\n\r\n[366] A testoon was worth half a ducat. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[367] When the Portuguese, Brito, was sent to govern the Moluccas in\r\n      1511, this Raja Abuleis lived, and he names him Raja Beglif.\r\n      Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[368] “Chechil” or “Cachil”, a title.\r\n\r\n[369] A hundredweight.\r\n\r\n[370] Pedro Alfonso de Lorosa.\r\n\r\n[371] The northern cape at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata.\r\n\r\n[372] Gilolo.\r\n\r\n[373] The Dutch observed later that this does not happen. Note, Milan\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n[374] This refers to the dress of men at arms of the period, which was\r\n      not decent.\r\n\r\n[375] Perhaps these are what the Malays use for pens.\r\n\r\n[376] Chingké, Chinese for “odorous nails”.\r\n\r\n[377] “Subhan”, or giving praise.\r\n\r\n[378] “A furia.”\r\n\r\n[379] S. Barbara is the patroness of powder magazines, which on board\r\n      French ships are called Sainte Barbe.\r\n\r\n[380] “Frixeto,” “_nastro_” or “_settuccia_,” “_ribbon_,” is so called\r\n      now in Genoese. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[381] Marcello, a coin struck at Venice by the Doge Nicolò Marcello in\r\n      1473, of silver, weighing as much as a sequin, and worth about\r\n      sixpence.

Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[387] The volcanoes of Ternate and Machian, which caused such havoc in\r\n      the last century by their explosions, did not then emit flames or\r\n      smoke, since Pigafetta would not have omitted to mention them.\r\n\r\n[388] Laboan, an islet considered now as part of Bachian. Note, Milan\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n[389] “Xulla” of Robert’s Atlas, and “Xoula” of the Dutch. Note, Milan\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n[390] Comparing this with what the author writes a little further\r\n      on, there is another proof that he took down the names of\r\n      the islands, and laid down their positions, as he thought he\r\n      understood the pilots who spoke a language which he little\r\n      understood. He here notes ten islands, and he has drawn six\r\n      without names to the North of Sulach, where other geographers\r\n      also lay down a few islets; but of these ten, Tenetum, Kalairuru,\r\n      Mandan, and Benaia, are again named and drawn further on; and\r\n      Leytimor is a peninsula attached to Amboina. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[391] The jack fruit, called Nangka throughout the Malay seas.\r\n\r\n[392] Amboina. Pigafetta appears to refer to the large island of Ceram.\r\n      Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[393] The Milan MS. says “longitude”, which must be an error of the\r\n      scribe.

Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[400] A note to the Milan edition suggests that it was too early in the\r\n      century for this to be the Frank disease, and that it must have\r\n      been leprosy. This is more probable.\r\n\r\n[401] Ende, or Flores.\r\n\r\n[402] Majapahit.\r\n\r\n[403] Gresik.\r\n\r\n[404] Surabaya.\r\n\r\n[405] “Campong anghin,” the place of wind.\r\n\r\n[406] Sanscrit and Malay, a griffin.\r\n\r\n[407] Pigafetta has confounded rhubarb with the decayed wood of a tree\r\n      found in Siam, which, when burnt, gives a very sweet perfume, and\r\n      which sells at a high price.\r\n\r\n[408] Cochin.\r\n\r\n[409] Kwantung or Canton.\r\n\r\n[410] “Satu orang,” one man.\r\n\r\n[411] “Anjing,” a dog.\r\n\r\n[412] “Pokoh bisi,” club of iron.\r\n\r\n[413] “Panah,” a bow.\r\n\r\n[414] “Tombak,” a lance.\r\n\r\n[415] “Harimau,” a tiger; not a lion. All these words are Malay, the\r\n      language in which the whole of this information must have been\r\n      conveyed to Pigafetta.\r\n\r\n[416] “Laut Kidol,” Javanese, the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n[417] See statement of Herrera, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[418] Francis I.\r\n\r\n[419] Now the declination of the ecliptic, which answers to the poles\r\n      of the eighth sphere of Pigafetta, is 23 deg. 28 min. 30 sec.\r\n      Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[420] Supposing that the surface of the globe under the equator were\r\n      half land and half sea, and then giving to each league three and\r\n      a half miles, we should have 22,050 miles for the circumference\r\n      of the earth: a measure very little differing from that which\r\n      results from giving to each degree at the equator sixty Italian\r\n      miles, by which the circumference is 21,600 miles. Note, Milan\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n[421] The guard stars are β and γ of Ursa Minor, which form a triangle\r\n      with the pole and pole star; now γ of the belt of Cassiopeia is\r\n      used. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[422] This means the arm of the instrument used; it might be the\r\n      meteoroscope of Regiomontano, which had a cross in the middle: or\r\n      an astrolabe like it; or the common astrolabe with a dioptron, or\r\n      mediclino, as Pigafetta calls it, placed on the equator. Note,\r\n      Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[423] That is the meridian line from the pole to the equator. Note,\r\n      Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[424] Though the radius of the circle which the pole star goes round\r\n      is now little more than a degree and a half, in the time of\r\n      Pigafetta it was 3 deg. 17 min. 37 sec., so that if he reckoned\r\n      it at 3 deg. 30 min. it is wonderful that he should have made\r\n      so small an error, notwithstanding the imperfection of his\r\n      instruments. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[425] These three methods are probably those which, according to\r\n      Castañeda, Faleiro taught to Magellan. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[426] That is to say, the knot where the orbit of the moon cuts the\r\n      ecliptic. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[427] The fleur-de-lys placed at the north.\r\n\r\n[428] That is, where it coincides with the meridian and begins to\r\n      deviate or vary. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[429] That is, varies east or west.\r\n\r\n[430] Or of midday.\r\n\r\n[431] I do not find any mention of the _mediclino_ in any writer of the\r\n      times near that of Pigafetta who have treated of the astrolabe,\r\n      such as Regiomontanus, Appianus, Gimma Frisius, Danti, Clavius,\r\n      etc.; but from what our author says here and elsewhere, it\r\n      appears that the mediclino is that movable rule, fixed on the\r\n      centre of the astrolabe, which turns round it, and is named\r\n      sometimes albidade, or dioptron, or traguardo, or linea di\r\n      fiducia. Note, Milan edition.\r\n\r\n[432] Amoretti, in his introduction to this Treatise of Navigation,\r\n      in the Milan edition, observes that Pigafetta was misled by a\r\n      false theory when he supposes that there is in the heavens a\r\n      point in repose to which the magnetic needle tends, but that the\r\n      exact direction of the magnetic needle coincided, or at least\r\n      approximated, to the meridian of the isle of Ferro, which is\r\n      not now the case; and that in some other places the variations\r\n      of the compass had been observed to correspond with that of the\r\n      longitude. By the table of variations of the compass published by\r\n      Lambert in the Ephemerides of Berlin (_Astronomische Jahrbuch_)\r\n      for the year 1779, it is seen by an easy calculation that at\r\n      the beginning of the sixteenth century the magnetic equator or\r\n      zero of deviation was very near the isle of Tenerife. Now it\r\n      is further off, and the distance increases. M. de Bougainville\r\n      found there the deviation to the west to be 14 deg. 41 min.; and\r\n      Staunton, the companion of Lord Macartney, found it to be 17 deg.\r\n      35 min.\r\n\r\n[433] We have two astrolabes in our museum constructed with several\r\n      plates: one is of brass, and another of card, for more easy\r\n      manipulation.

Ramusion translates: “Dando loro a mangiar carne di\r\n      fiere;” and the Spanish version in Navarrete has: “Con su aparato\r\n      y cerimonias bestiales.” Ducange has an adverb, _feraliter_, with\r\n      the sense of beastly.\r\n\r\n[442] “Feralis,” again.\r\n\r\n[443] Or, Caurus.\r\n\r\n[444] Bohol.\r\n\r\n[445] Bandan.\r\n\r\n[446] “Tanto abante.” These words are doubtful.\r\n\r\n[447] The MS. of the British Museum has “9”, which must be an error.\r\n\r\n[448] Query, east.\r\n\r\n[449] “Papahigos.”\r\n\r\n[450] It is 37° 52′. This is the northernmost of the two islands, St.\r\n      Paul’s and Amsterdam. The Dutch call the N.

Quesada helped to make\r\n      Alvaro de Mezquita, Magellan’s relation, and captain of the _S.\r\n      Antonio_, a prisoner; but what Correa relates may have been part\r\n      of the plot and a stratagem of Juan de Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[456] His name was Gonzalo Gomes de Spinosa; he returned to Spain.\r\n\r\n[457] “Que fizesse grande toa.”\r\n\r\n[458] The reader will observe that this account of Magellan’s death is\r\n      incorrect.\r\n\r\n[459] Andres de San Martin.\r\n\r\n[460] Probably the Genoese pilot, whose narrative commences this volume.\r\n\r\n[461] Road to Coimbra—straight road.\r\n\r\n[462] Pessoas.\r\n\r\n[463] Varas.\r\n\r\n[464] Nuno.\r\n\r\n[465] 4,000.\r\n\r\n[466] 20,000.\r\n\r\n[467] Globe.\r\n\r\n[468] Sic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n  ● Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_).\r\n  ● Text enclosed by pluses is in small caps (+small caps+).\r\n  ● Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.\r\n  ● Errata have been applied.",
