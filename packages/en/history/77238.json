The writer realizes the inadequacy\r\nof the book and possible conflicting statements because of diverse\r\nauthorities that have been consulted. After careful “siftings,” it is\r\noffered as an incentive to further study, as a roadmap to many paths\r\nof literary research. Biographical data and brief criticism of the\r\nauthors’ works are followed by a bibliography which is suggestive\r\nrather than exhaustive.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these chapters has been, in large measure, the recorder\r\nof research by many individuals and educational institutions, with\r\npersonal deductions from wide reading. Among many books that have been\r\nstimulating are _Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Century_ by Georg\r\nBrandes, _Studies from Ten Literatures_ by Ernest Boyd, books upon the\r\ndrama and translations by John Garrett Underhill, Ludwig Lewisohn and\r\nBarrett H. Clark, and studies of Knut Hamsun by Josef Wiehr and Hanna\r\nArstrup Larsen. Other specific books of interpretation are emphasized\r\nin text and footnotes, as well as in bibliography.\r\n\r\nGratitude that defies fitting words would be here expressed to Miss\r\nAnna C. Reque of the Bureau of Information of the American-Scandinavian\r\nFoundation, to the Svenska Akademien Nobelinstitut of Stockholm, to\r\nMrs. Velma Swanston Howard, Miss Svea Boson and Thekla E.

The grandfather,\r\nImanuel, an army surgeon, is accredited with changing the family\r\nname to _Nobel_. His son, Emanuel, father of Alfred, taught science\r\nin Stockholm, as a young man. With inventive ability he experimented\r\nwith explosives, submarine mines, and other destructive forces and,\r\nby paradox, became designer of surgical appliances and India-rubber\r\ncushions to relieve suffering. He was interested in ship construction\r\nand spent some time in Egypt. To his sons he transmitted his spirit of\r\nscientific research, with all the dangers as well as the inspiration of\r\nsuch ambition. Two explosions, during experiments with nitroglycerine\r\nand other chemicals, caused severe loss. The first, occurring about\r\n1837 in Stockholm, shattered the nerves of the people as well as their\r\nwindows, so that Emanuel went to Russia, on the advice of friends\r\nprominent in affairs of industry and government. Here he was employed\r\nby the Russians to continue his experiments with submarine mines; with\r\nhis family, he remained here until after the Crimean War, contributing\r\nto naval warfare by his inventions. An older son, Ludwig, remained in\r\nRussia when his family returned to Sweden. This son gained repute as\r\nan engineer and discovered the petroleum springs at Baku.[1] A second\r\nexplosion in one of the factories of Sweden, in 1864, caused the death\r\nof a younger son of Emanuel Nobel and shocked the father so severely\r\nthat he was an invalid physically for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nAlfred Bernhard Nobel was born at Stockholm in 1833. He was less\r\nrobust than his brothers; he was sensitive and nervous, suffering from\r\nheadaches all his life. His mother, Karoline Henriette Ahlssell, was\r\nhis devoted comrade from the early days when he would lie on the couch\r\nwhile she read to him or told him sagas and hero-stories. She was wise\r\nand happy by nature, confident that Alfred would become “a great man,”\r\nin spite of poor physique and moods of depression. He never married,\r\nalthough he loved a young girl who died in her youth, but he was\r\ndevoted to his mother to the end of her life. Letters and frequent\r\nvisits to her in Sweden, in his later life, kept alive his affectionate\r\nnature and his idealism.\r\n\r\nLike his father he showed studious interest in chemistry, physics,\r\nand mechanical engineering. Shipbuilding attracted his attention for\r\na time and, when he was about seventeen, he was sent to the United\r\nStates to increase his knowledge of mechanics, as applied to ships, by\r\nassociation with John Ericsson. At the home of the latter on Franklin\r\nStreet, New York, where a tablet has been placed to commemorate the\r\nservices of this inventor in the Civil War, young Nobel lived for a\r\ntime. His father sent him to John Ericsson in order to investigate an\r\ninvention of his, an engine which was supposed to work by heat from\r\nthe sun. He stayed several months, probably not more than a year.\r\nEricsson was passing through a period of fluctuating fortunes. At\r\nthe end of 1849 his balance was only $132.32--his total receipts for\r\nthe year had been but $2,000. Two years later he recorded a balance\r\nof $8,690.10. In the interval he had sold several patents and had\r\nreceived congratulations from the King of Sweden upon the great future\r\nfor his “test caloric engine.” This was the goal of his experiments\r\nduring these years; its success was to be tested in the trial trip of\r\n_The Ericsson_, February 11, 1853. A squall came up as the boat was\r\nlaunched and making headway, and it sank, carrying with it hopes of\r\nthe inventor after years of experiment, and half a million dollars of\r\ninvested capital. Ericsson was crushed for a few weeks. How pluckily he\r\nrecovered his courage, made his plans for _The Monitor_, offered that\r\nto the United States government and won success for the cause of the\r\nNorth, is familiar history.[2]\r\n\r\nUpon Alfred Nobel, with his quick, impressionable temperament, this\r\ndirect contact with Ericsson must have left strong influences. Perhaps\r\nhe decided then that, should fortune favor him, he would leave a fund\r\nto aid scientists in their experiments and to protect them against\r\nfinancial duress during periods of discouragement. When he returned\r\nto Sweden and Russia, he coöperated with his father and brothers in\r\nmanufacturing nitroglycerine and other explosives; he was constantly\r\nseeking for a compound which would be more powerful and less dangerous.\r\nIn 1857, at St. Petersburg, he had taken out a patent for a gasometer.\r\nIt has been said that the discovery of what was later known as dynamite\r\ncame by accident to Alfred Nobel, during an experiment about 1865-66.\r\nSome nitroglycerine had escaped into the siliceous sand of the packing\r\nand this brought about a partial solution of his problem. Dynamite,\r\nwhich was composed of 75 per cent nitroglycerine and 25 per cent\r\nkieselguhr, or infusorial earth, was produced. He applied for patents\r\nin several countries, and sought for funds to start factories which he\r\nbelieved would make a fortune by manufacture of this new explosive. It\r\nwas sometimes called “Nobel’s blasting-oil.” He told French bankers\r\nthat he had invented “an oil that would blow up the world”; a facetious\r\ncommentator declared, “French bankers thought it for their interest to\r\nleave the globe undisturbed” and refused him credit.[3]\r\n\r\nNapoleon III became interested and arranged for funds for Nobel’s\r\nfactories in France. With some samples of dynamite in his hand bag,\r\nAlfred Nobel came to the United States on the same commercial mission.\r\nNew York hotels received him with suspicion because of rumors about\r\nthe “deadly explosive”; he went to California where, through the aid\r\nof Dr. Bandman, a friend of Nobel’s brother, a factory was started\r\nnear Los Angeles. In a few years manufactories were in operation in\r\nItaly, Spain, France and Scotland, as well as England and Sweden.\r\nWhen Alfred Nobel was forty years old he was making his fortune out\r\nof this “giant powder.” For several years he lived in Paris where he\r\nhad laboratories for further experiments with gelatin, balastite, and\r\nforms of smokeless powder. In his later home, in San Remo, he carried\r\non developments and took out more patents in petroleum and artificial\r\ngutta-percha. He received the tribute of scientists and educators but\r\nthe ignorant people regarded him with a mixture of awe and fear--“he\r\nhad put the long hammer of Thor to work again among the giants.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his inspiring life-work and many successes, in spite of\r\nhis wealth and honors, Alfred Nobel was a lonely man. His health\r\nwas unstable; he often worked with bandaged head and in intense\r\npain, accentuated by the gaseous fumes of his laboratory. He was\r\nself-distrustful and fearful that people were attracted to him _only_\r\nby his wealth. One of the few individuals who gained and kept his\r\nconfidence was Baroness Bertha von Suttner. In her _Memoirs_ the\r\npersonality of Alfred Nobel is revealed in comments and letters. She\r\ncame to him in response to an advertisement in a Paris newspaper,\r\nasking for a secretary for “a very wealthy, cultured gentleman.”\r\nShe remained only a few days in her joint capacity of secretary and\r\nhousekeeper, for a happy solution of her interrupted romance with the\r\nBaron von Suttner eventuated in her speedy marriage. She exchanged\r\nletters and visits with Alfred Nobel for many years and was devoted\r\nto him in life and in memory. She describes him as somewhat below\r\naverage height, without physical attractiveness but in no sense\r\n“repulsive,” as he imagined himself to be. He was a fine linguist,\r\nsomewhat of a philosopher, a good conversationalist and entertaining\r\nas a story-teller. He allowed her to read a long philosophical poem\r\nwhich he had written in English and she found it “simply splendid.”\r\nHe was critical of the shallow, false-hearted people, especially\r\nthose who importuned him with low motives; but he had faith in a\r\nbetter development of humanity as education progressed. One of his few\r\nintellectual companions in Paris was Madame Juliette Adams, author and\r\neditor of the _Nouvelle Revue_; at her salon in Rue Juliet, Nobel would\r\nmeet, occasionally, men of science and letters.\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs_ of Baroness von Suttner may be located the first\r\nintimations of Nobel’s motives which led to the Nobel prizes,\r\nespecially the specific form which was known as “the Peace Prize.” It\r\nwill be recalled that the Baroness von Suttner was one of the early\r\nwinners of this prize by her widely-read romance, _Die Waffen nieder_\r\n(_Lay Down Your Arms!_). In 1890, after the publication of this story,\r\nadvocating world peace, Nobel wrote letters of high commendation. On\r\nanother occasion he said to her, “I wish I could produce a substance or\r\na machine of such frightful efficacy for wholesale devastation that\r\nwars should thereby become altogether impossible.”[4] He contended,\r\nwith the mind of a prophet, that a day might come when “two army corps\r\nmay mutually annihilate each other in a second”; then he believed\r\nthat “all civilized nations will recoil and disband their troops.” On\r\nJanuary 7, 1893, three years before his death, he wrote to the Baroness\r\nfrom Paris.[5] “I should like to dispose of a part of my fortune by\r\nfounding a prize to be granted every five years--say six times, for\r\nif in thirty years they have not succeeded in reforming the present\r\nsystem they will infallibly relapse into barbarism.... If the Triple\r\nAlliance, instead of comprising only three states, should enlist all\r\nstates, the peace of the centuries would be assured.” Affirming his\r\nbelief in “reasonable Socialism,” he deplored the custom of leaving\r\nlarge fortunes to heirs; too often the results were lapses in mental\r\nambitions and industry.\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 1896, Alfred Nobel died suddenly in his workshop at\r\nSan Remo. For a long time he had realized his condition of reduced\r\nvitality. He consulted doctors unwillingly and heeded their counsel\r\nwith reluctance. He kept a record of his own pulse and heart action\r\nbut he never desisted from a full day’s work in his laboratory. His\r\nlast letters have a sad note that is sometimes sarcastic yet he\r\nkept faith in and with humanity to the last. He had been carefully\r\nconsidering the disposal of his fortune, determined that it should\r\ncontribute to progress in science and literature, for the welfare of\r\nmankind and the education towards world peace. His will startled the\r\ncivilized world by its originality and idealism. The man who had been\r\nmost successful in inventing elements of destruction, by a paradox, had\r\nleft most of his large fortune to constructive, creative purposes.\r\n\r\nBecause he distrusted many lawyers he had been his own legal adviser\r\nin large measure; sometimes he had acted as his own secretary, lest an\r\noutsider might abuse his confidence. In appointing M. Ragnar Sohlmann\r\nas executor, he explained that here “was a man who had never asked\r\nanything of me.” (Later the manager of the factory at Bergen became\r\nassociate executor.) He left legacies of five thousand pounds each\r\nto his nephews but some efforts to “break the will” were threatened.\r\nEmanuel, then head of the family, refused to sanction such interference\r\nand, after many complications and delays, the will was allowed, and\r\nvaried equivocal, or impractical, conditions were interpreted by “Code\r\nof Statutes,” issued by the King of Sweden, June 29, 1900.\r\n\r\nFrom this pamphlet is quoted here the extract from the will:[6]\r\n“Extract from the Will and Testament of Dr. Alfred Bernhard Nobel,\r\nEngineer, which was drawn on the 27th day of November, 1895: ‘With\r\nthe residue of my convertible estate I hereby direct my executors to\r\nproceed as follows: They shall convert my said residue of property into\r\nmoney, which they shall then invest in safe securities; the capital\r\nthus secured shall constitute a fund, the interest accruing from\r\nwhich shall be annually awarded in prizes to those persons who shall\r\nhave contributed most materially to benefit mankind during the year\r\nimmediately preceding. The said interest shall be divided into five\r\nequal amounts, to be apportioned as follows: one share to the person\r\nwho shall have made the most important discovery or invention in the\r\ndomain of Physics; one share to the person who shall have made the most\r\nimportant chemical discovery or improvement; one share to the person\r\nwho shall have made the most important discovery in the domain of\r\nPhysiology or Medicine; one share to the person who shall have produced\r\nin the field of Literature the most distinguished work of an idealistic\r\ntendency; and finally, one share to the person who shall have most\r\nor best promoted the Fraternity of Nations and the Abolishment or\r\nDiminution of Standing Armies and the Formation and Increase of Peace\r\nCongresses.’”\r\n\r\nIn further details the will provides: “The prizes for Physics and\r\nChemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Science in\r\nStockholm; the one for Physiology or Medicine by the Caroline Medical\r\nInstitute in Stockholm; the one for Literature by the Academy in\r\nStockholm (_i.e._ Svenska Akademien) and that for Peace by a Committee\r\nof five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storthing. I declare\r\nit to be my express desire that in the awarding of prizes, no\r\nconsideration whatever be paid to the nationality of the candidates,\r\nthat is to say, that the most deserving be awarded the prize, whether\r\nof Scandinavian origin or not.”\r\n\r\nBecause of difficulties in interpreting certain sections and\r\nelucidating other phrases, this Code of Statutes was drawn up “in\r\nconsultation with a representative, nominated by Robert Nobel’s family,\r\nand submitted to consideration of the King.” After adjustments of\r\ninterests had been “amicably entered into” by the testator’s heirs,\r\nJune 5, 1898, it was decreed that “The instructions of the will above\r\nas set forth shall serve as a criterion for the administration of the\r\nFoundation (Nobel) in conjunction with the elucidations and further\r\nstipulations contained in this Code.” One “stipulation” was that “each\r\nof the annual prizes founded by the said will shall be awarded at least\r\nonce during each ensuing five-year period after the year in which the\r\nNobel Foundation comes into force.” The phrase used by Nobel in the\r\nwords relating to the prize in Literature, “the Academy at Stockholm,”\r\nwas interpreted “as understood to be the Swedish Academy--Svenska\r\nAkademien.” Another significant explanation was--the “term,\r\n‘Literature,’ used in the will shall be understood to embrace not only\r\nworks falling under the category of Polite Literature, but also other\r\nwritings which may claim to possess literary value by reason of their\r\nform or their mode of exposition.” This last provision, which seems\r\nelastic and somewhat vague, has not led thus far to undue difficulties\r\nand criticisms.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “during the preceding year,” as applied to scientific and\r\nliterary achievements alike, was a strange, impractical provision which\r\nwas well interpreted broadly in the Code thus: “only such works or\r\ninventions shall be eligible as have appeared ‘during the preceding\r\nyear’ is to be understood, that a work or invention for which a reward\r\nunder the terms of the will is contemplated, shall set forth the _most\r\nmodern results_ of work being done in that of the departments as\r\ndefined in the will to which it belongs; works or inventions of older\r\nstanding to be taken into consideration only in case their importance\r\nhas not previously been demonstrated.”\r\n\r\nTwo other stipulations were made that have been applied to the awards\r\nin literature, as elsewhere, “The amount allotted to one prize may be\r\ndivided equally between two works submitted, should each of such works\r\nbe deemed to merit a prize.” Thus, in 1904, the prize was divided\r\nbetween José Echegaray, the Spanish dramatist, and Frédéric Mistral,\r\nthe poet of Provence; again, in 1917, it was divided between two Danish\r\nwriters, Gjellerup and Pontoppidan. On the other hand, if all of the\r\n“works under examination fail to attain to the standard of excellence”\r\nrequired, no award need be given that year, the “amount added to the\r\nmain fund or may be set aside to form a special fund for that of one of\r\nthe sections to promote the object of the testator.” In 1914 and 1918\r\nthere were no awards in literature.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate impartial judgment it was directed that each of the\r\nfour sections of the Swedish corporation of award “shall appoint a\r\ncommittee--their Nobel Committee--of three or five members to make\r\nsuggestions with reference to the award.” To be a member of this\r\nNobel Committee one need not be “a Swedish subject or member of the\r\nCorporation.” “How are these candidates for prizes nominated?” is a\r\nfrequent question. It is stated explicitly in this Code of Statutes,\r\nsection 7: “It is essential that every candidate for a prize under\r\nthe terms of the will, be proposed as such in writing by some duly\r\nqualified person. A direct application for a prize will not be taken\r\ninto consideration.” Further explanations are given of “qualifications\r\nentitling a person to propose another for the receipt of a prize”--he\r\nmust be “a representative, whether Swedish or otherwise, of the domain\r\nof Science, Literature, etc. in question and the grounds for the award\r\nmust be stated in writing.” In this same Code of Statutes, in a later\r\nsection (p. 23) there is expanded information regarding “The right to\r\nnominate a candidate for the prize-competition”--this shall “belong to\r\nMembers of the Swedish Academy and the Academies in France and Spain\r\nwhich are similar to it in constitution and purpose; members also of\r\nthe humanistic classes of other Academies and of those humanistic\r\ninstitutions and societies that are on the same footing as academies,\r\nand teachers of æsthetics, literature and history at universities and\r\ncolleges.” For publicity it was provided that these “regulations shall\r\nbe publicly announced at least every five years in some official or\r\nwidely circulated journals in each of the three Scandinavian countries\r\nand in the chief countries of the civilized world.” The names of\r\ncandidates must be presented by February first of each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough the successful candidates for the various prizes are\r\nusually “broadcasted,” in these days of shrewd journalism, sometime\r\nin November, the official announcements of the awards are made on\r\n“Founder’s Day,” the tenth of December, the anniversary of the death\r\nof the testator. “At this time the adjudicators shall make known the\r\nresult of their award and shall hand over to the winners of the prizes\r\na cheque for the amount of the same, together with a diploma and a\r\nmedal in gold, bearing the testator’s effigy and a suitable legend.”\r\nThe last word may be more freely translated, _inscription_. In further\r\nexplanation the Code of Statutes decrees: “It shall be incumbent on\r\na prize winner, whenever feasible, to give a lecture on the subject\r\ntreated of in the work to which the prize has been awarded, such\r\nlecture to take place within six months of the Founder’s Day at which\r\nthe prize was won, and to be given at Stockholm or, in the case of the\r\nPeace prize, at Christiania.” This feature of the award has not often\r\nbeen “feasible” in literature, although a few of the winners have\r\nreceived the prizes in person at Stockholm and made fitting responses,\r\nas we shall note in later chapters. The decree is final:[7] “Against\r\nthe decision of the adjudicators in making their award no protest can\r\nbe lodged. If differences of opinion have occurred they shall not\r\nappear in the minutes of the proceedings, nor in any other way be made\r\npublic.” To assist in their investigations and to further the “aims\r\nof the Foundation, the adjudicators shall possess powers to establish\r\nscientific institutes and other organizations. The institutes so\r\nestablished and belonging to the Foundation, shall be known under the\r\nname of Nobel Institutes.”\r\n\r\nWhile the general administration of the funds and awards rests with\r\nthe Nobel Foundation, consisting of five persons (“one of whom, the\r\nPresident, shall be appointed by the King and the others by the\r\ndelegates of the adjudicating corporations”) the specific work of\r\ninvestigation and judgment rests with the organization cited in the\r\nwill. In literature, the “prizes are assigned” by the Swedish Academy,\r\nafter careful investigation by its members, and the assistance of the\r\nNobel Institute and Librarian. A large collection of books, mostly of\r\nmodern writings, forms the Library. In all languages, translations,\r\nwhen necessary, are found here, also reports concerning works of\r\nrecent publication. The Swedish Academy was founded by King Gustavus\r\nIII in 1786. It has devoted itself to “the arts of elocution and\r\npoetry, to the preservation of purity, force and elevation of diction\r\nin the Swedish language both in scientific works and products of pure\r\nliterature.” Annual prizes have been offered, for scores of years, in\r\nelocution and poetry. Eighteen members, all Swedes, comprise this\r\nAcademy, of which the King is patron. He appoints the Inspector of the\r\nNobel Institute of the Swedish Academy but its “immediate management is\r\nby a member of the Academy, chosen by that body.”\r\n\r\nTwo conditions of the will of Alfred Nobel have been faithfully\r\nfollowed--the recipients in all branches have done something (if not\r\n“most”) “to benefit humanity”; in the second place, “no consideration\r\nwhatever has been paid to the nationality of the candidates,” in\r\nthe way of favoritism. The most reasonable criticism of the awards,\r\nespecially in literature, has been a failure to carry out what seems\r\nto have been the assumed, but not expressed, desire of the donor,\r\nnamely, to _stimulate_ work as well as to _reward_ past achievements.\r\nOtherwise, why that puzzling phrase about “the year preceding”? Not\r\nwholly without foundation is the comment that too many of the awards\r\nin literature have been “tombstones rather than stepping-stones.” Many\r\nof the earlier recipients were past seventy, with productive faculties\r\nlow, before the honor. It is a satisfaction to the public to know that\r\na worthy writer has had world recognition before he dies, and that\r\nhis last days may have many comforts possible through the financial\r\naward of about $40,000--but such conditions do not seem in accord with\r\nthe spirit of the Nobel will and the attitude of the donor toward\r\ncreative work. The awards have been too often retroactive rather than\r\nstimulating to further writing. Other winners, as will be noted later,\r\nhave accomplished vigorous literature, _after_ the award as well as\r\n_before_ the honor.\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1901, when the first prizes were given, to 1925,\r\ntwelve nationalities have been represented in literature. Germany\r\nand France have had the largest percentages in awards: Spain, Italy,\r\nPoland, Norway, Sweden have had two winners each. Great Britain\r\n(including the awards to Rabindranath Tagore and to Yeats as well as\r\nKipling) has been thrice honored. Denmark divided the prize one year;\r\nSwitzerland came into the lists with her poet, Carl Spitteler. In\r\nscience and “promotion of peace,” America has such names on the roster\r\nof honor as A. A. Michelson in physics, T. W. Richards in chemistry,\r\nDr. Alexis Carrel in medicine, and Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root and\r\nWoodrow Wilson in the “peace prize.”\r\n\r\nWhat have been the influences of the will of Alfred Nobel and the\r\nawards upon international literature? An unquestioned result has been\r\nto arouse both curiosity and aspiration among writers and readers. No\r\nother prizes, among any peoples, have caused such widespread interest.\r\nThe announcement of the Nobel prizes each year has become an event\r\nof outstanding significance. Journals enter into competition, in\r\nrecent years, to get the first word over the wires and to publish the\r\nmost informing articles upon the winners. Tense interest precedes and\r\nfollows the awards. Whatever may be one’s individual opinion about the\r\njustice in every instance, the fact remains that the chosen writer\r\nbecomes the center of study and discussion for the current season and\r\nlater years. To some critics this method of appreciation is offensive;\r\nsometimes it may seem to be a sensational “thrust into the limelight”\r\nof an insignificant or mediocre writer. In the majority of cases, the\r\nresult is like that of a strong telescope which can distinguish the\r\n“fixed stars from the meteors” in the literary horizon.\r\n\r\nThe second influence is upon writers of every nationality--an incentive\r\nto produce “a distinguished work of an idealistic tendency,” some book\r\nwhich will prove of “benefit to humanity.” This term, idealistic,\r\nis difficult to render in all languages. In the French explanation\r\nof the will, it is explicit, “le plus remarquable dans le sens de\r\nl’idéalisme.” It is not easy to justify the prizes in literature, in\r\nseveral cases, if one emphasizes the usual meaning of “idealistic.”\r\nOccasionally, the award was given for some less recent work, some\r\nhitherto unappreciated note of idealism in an earlier writing. Two\r\nexamples, among many, are Björnson’s tales of peasant life, with\r\ninterwoven sagas and poetry, _Arne_ and _A Happy Boy_, or Mistral’s\r\n_Mireio_, the pastoral poem of Provence which was written more than\r\nforty years before the prize was given. In these two cases, as will\r\nbe noted later, there was appreciation of efforts to rescue a dialect\r\nor language from literary desuetude. Upon both writers and readers,\r\nthe influence of the Nobel awards in literature has been to promote\r\nbroader interests and sympathies, more earnest study of standards and\r\naspirations in widely separated races.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Westminster Review_, 156, 642.\r\n\r\n[2] _The Life of John Ericsson_ by William Conant Church, 2 Vols., New\r\nYork, 1901.\r\n\r\n[3] Vance Thompson, in _Cosmopolitan_, September, 1906.\r\n\r\n[4] _Memoirs of Bertha von Suttner; Records of an Eventful Life_, Vol.\r\nI, p. 210, New York, 1910.

Proof is found by comparing journals\r\nof 1901 and 1925, with reference to data and discussion of prize\r\nwinners of the respective years. That the will of Alfred Nobel was\r\nan epochal document, in the history of science and literature, was a\r\nslowly recognized truth. What is idealism in literature? What writers\r\nwill be candidates with books “of idealistic tendency”? How important\r\nwill be the influence of such awards? Such were queries in many minds.\r\nThe meaning of idealism is elastic in interpretation, as examples among\r\nthe winners will testify. A general principle holds, however, in past\r\nand present standards--the idealistic writer sees _beyond_ nature and\r\nexternals; he sees “with the eye of the spirit.” The difference has\r\nbeen expressed in fitting analogy, by contrast between a photograph\r\nand a portrait of the same individual--if the latter is painted by an\r\nintuitive artist, with vision and insight, as well as artistic technic.\r\n\r\nRené François Armand Sully-Prudhomme, the first author to win the\r\nprize in literature, in 1901, received adulatory comments from French\r\njournals and several pages of _personalia_ and criticism in literary\r\nmagazines of England, Germany, Scandinavia, and America. For more than\r\nforty years he had been recognized as one of the greatest living poets,\r\nthe philosophical poet of the nineteenth century in France, about whose\r\nlife and work there was inadequate information in English translations;\r\nthe inadequacy is still apparent. The French Academy was happy that\r\none of its members should have been chosen for this honor, the first\r\non the list of international candidates. Born in Paris, May 16, 1839,\r\nthis French poet evidently belonged to the nineteenth century, in its\r\nmiddle and later decades, rather than to the twentieth century and its\r\nproductive or prophetic writers.\r\n\r\nIn the poetry of Sully-Prudhomme are found, almost always, two elements\r\nsometimes in conflict, wistful tenderness and serious, challenging\r\nreflection. This combination of traits may be explained, in part, by\r\nthe circumstances of his inheritance and childhood. For ten years his\r\nmother had waited to marry her lover, the father of the poet; four\r\nyears after their marriage, he died. Devoted to her son and believing\r\nthat he had marked skill in science, she gave him every possible chance\r\nfor education; but his home life was lacking in gayety or lighter\r\ninterests. At the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, René Sully-Prudhomme\r\nexcelled in mathematical sciences and his future seemed assured as a\r\nscholar and teacher. Then an illness affected his eyes so seriously\r\nthat he had to abandon concentrated study and he began to write poems\r\nof philosophic trend, questioning the meaning of life yet vibrating\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\nThe first collection of his poems, _Stances et poèmes_, appeared when\r\nhe was twenty-six years old. It was received with encomiums from\r\ncritics and sold so well that he determined to relinquish the hope\r\nof ever becoming either a scientist or a lawyer and decided that he\r\nwould devote his time to poetry. In this collection is found “Le vase\r\nbrisé,” one of the most familiar of his poems, with the extended\r\nanalogy between the broken vase, the verbena, and the heart; here is\r\nthe echoing refrain,\r\n\r\n    Il est brisé, n’y touchez pas.\r\n\r\nThe next year _Les Epreuves_, translated as _The Test_, was\r\npublished, followed by _Les Solitudes_ three years later, and _Les\r\nvrais tendresses_, in 1875. In these poetic meditations he showed the\r\nconflict, ever present in his own nature, between the reason and the\r\nemotions,\r\n\r\n                le combat sans vainqueur\r\n    Entre la foi sans preuve et la raison sans charme.\r\n\r\nEven more pronounced was this motif of disharmony in the two later\r\npoems, _La Justice_ and _Le Bonheur_. By his countrymen he was hailed\r\nas successor to Victor Hugo and was elected to membership in the French\r\nAcademy in 1881. In the long and best known poem by Sully-Prudhomme,\r\n_La Justice_, there are strong traces of the influence of Lucretius,\r\nthe classic poet whom he admired and translated with felicitous skill.\r\nA Prologue and an Epilogue and eleven “Vigils” comprise the structure\r\nof this poetic search for the element of _Justice_. There are two\r\ndivisions; Part I is entitled “Silence au cœur,” rendered into English\r\nas “Heart, Be Silent!” and Part II, “Appel au cœur.” The chosen medium\r\nof expression is dialogue between two symbolic characters, “The\r\nSeeker,” who analyzes all things with metaphysical exactness, and “A\r\nVoice” which proclaims the “divine aspect in all things.” Justice\r\ncannot be located in the Universe; it may be found in the heart of man,\r\n“which is its inviolable and sacred temple.”\r\n\r\nAs _La Justice_ exemplified the search for Justice in Universal Nature,\r\nso _Le Bonheur_, the second long poem published in 1888, was a symbolic\r\nepic, a progress towards supreme Happiness by three routes--curiosity,\r\nsensuousness and science, virtue and sacrifice. The three Parts have\r\nbeen called, in one translation, “Intoxication,” “Thought,” “The\r\nSupreme Flight” (“Le suprème essor”). There are lines that are strained\r\nin effect, far less convincing and harmonious than the arguments in _La\r\nJustice_; by contrast there are passages of poetic beauty. Faustus and\r\nStella are the two seekers after Happiness. In a climax--which might\r\nbe more dramatic--they “take flight” spiritually from the temptations\r\nand disillusionments of earth to seek, in sacrifice, their fruition of\r\npossible happiness.\r\n\r\nOne of the colleagues of Sully-Prudhomme, who has written frankly of\r\nhis personality and poetry, is Anatole France. In the biography of the\r\nlatter, _Anatole France: the Man and His Work_ by James Lewis May,[9]\r\namong the vignettes written of the group of poet-friends who discussed\r\nlife and literature, is a typical sketch of Sully-Prudhomme, at the age\r\nof thirty-six, “mathematical and even geometrical in his sonnets.” He\r\nstressed his intellectuality, as well as his handsome face and wealth.\r\nMore illumining, and far more sympathetic, is the analytic study of\r\nSully-Prudhomme, in the chapter entitled “Three Poets” in Anatole\r\nFrance’s critiques _On Life and Letters_, first series, translated\r\nby A. W. Evans.[10] Comparing Sully-Prudhomme, François Coppée and\r\nFrédéric Plessis, the critic finds in the first poet, “in his favour,\r\nnot only the mysterious gifts of the poet but, in addition, an absolute\r\nsincerity, an inflexible gentleness, a pity without weakness, and a\r\ncandour, a simplicity that lift his philosophical scepticism, as it\r\nwere on wings, into the lofty regions whither formerly the mystics\r\nwere exalted by faith.” As a friend and confidant, he extols this\r\nman of gentle melancholy, sentimental yet reflective, romantic yet\r\nphilosophical.\r\n\r\nEdward Dowden, in his essay on “Some French Writers of Verse,”[11]\r\nattributes the seeming unhappiness, or melancholy of Sully-Prudhomme,\r\nreflected in some of his poetry, to the lack of a creed or a loyalty\r\nto which he can give absolute devotion. He calls him “an eclectic”\r\nand finds an analogy in the tale of _Merlin_, the poetical romance\r\nby Edgar Quinet. He stresses the almost feminine sensitiveness of\r\nthis poet, a woman’s tenderness which in no way diminishes his manly\r\nvigor. An individual of “harder or narrower personality” would not\r\nhave been so disturbed by the conflicts between reason and emotion, by\r\nthe deterrents to perfect happiness. Ill health for many years was a\r\ncontributory factor, doubtless, to many moods of introspective sadness.\r\nHe suffered from partial paralysis in later years. Francis Grierson\r\nin _Parisian Portraits_[12] gives a graphic, intimate picture of this\r\n“typical Academician” with grace of manners and intuitive insight into\r\npeople, waging war against his illusions with the part of his mind that\r\nwas scientific, and maintaining his poetic vision by his sensitive\r\nemotions. At his home in the rue de Faubourg he always welcomed younger\r\npoets. He seldom went into society, although he was often found at\r\nthe salons of Countess Diane de Beausacq, the author of _Maximes de\r\nla vie_. This woman of independent spirit and beautiful hair, who was\r\ndressed in tones of lavender, was an inspiration to the poet. Together\r\nthey discussed philosophy and art; Sully-Prudhomme emphasized “the\r\naristocracy of the mind,” the eternal quality of poetry, music, taste,\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, which was a great strain upon the\r\nphysical and spiritual endurance of the poet, Sully-Prudhomme wrote\r\n_Impressions_ that awakened political discussion and revealed his\r\npervasive idealism. _Essays upon the Fine Arts_, _The Art of\r\nVersification_ and _Le testament poétique_ were expressions of his\r\npoetic studies and theories. On the other hand, _Que sais-je?_ which\r\nappeared in 1895 was another index to his scientific inquiries into\r\nnatural science, philosophy, and metaphysics. A commentator upon these\r\nqueries, well entitled _What Do I Know?_, has said that his last words\r\nmight be summarized as “peut-être.” Doubts, yet never bitterness of\r\ndespair, characterize his speculative poetry. Four years after he\r\nreceived the Nobel prize and two years before his death, at the age of\r\nsixty-six, he wrote _La vraie religion selon Pascal_, a last record of\r\nhis profound search for spiritual values in life and literature.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the shorter poems by Sully-Prudhomme, chosen from the five\r\nvolumes of his verse, have been translated into English by such poets\r\nas Arthur O’Shaughnessy, E. and R. Prothero, and Dorothy Frances\r\nGuiney. These metrical interpretations are found in anthologies of\r\nFrench poetry by H. Carrington and Albert Boni. The latter has included\r\na few of the most representative and musical of Sully-Prudhomme’s poems\r\nin _The Modern Book of French Verse_. A wistful love poem is here\r\nentitled “A Supplication,” translated by I. O. L.:[13]\r\n\r\n    Oh! did you know how the tears apace\r\n      Fall by a lonely heart, alas!\r\n    I think that before my dwelling place\r\n      Sometimes you did pass.\r\n\r\n    And did you know of the hopes that arise\r\n      In wearied soul from a pure young glance,\r\n    Maybe to my window you’d lift your eyes\r\n      As if by chance....\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But if you knew of the love that enwraps\r\n      My soul for you, and holds it fast,\r\n    Quite simple over my threshold, perhaps,\r\n      You’d step at last.\r\n\r\nMore typical of this scientist-poet is the verse-picture entitled “The\r\nAppointment,” translated by Arthur O’Shaughnessy.[14]\r\n\r\n    ’Tis late; the astronomer in his lonely height,\r\n    Exploring all the dark, descries afar\r\n    Orbs that like distant isles of splendor are,\r\n    And mornings whitening in the infinite.\r\n\r\n    Like winnowed grain the worlds go by in flight,\r\n    Or swarm in glistening spaces nebular;\r\n    He summons one disheveled wandering star,--\r\n    Return ten centuries hence on such a night.\r\n\r\n    The star will come. It dare not by one hour\r\n    Cheat Science, or falsify her calculation;\r\n    Men will have passed, but watchful in the tower\r\n    Man shall remain in sleepless contemplation;\r\n    And should all men have perished there in turn,\r\n    Truth in their place would watch that star’s return.\r\n\r\nNot all of the verses by Sully-Prudhomme are as pictorial as these\r\nselections. There is an unevenness more than usual in his meditative\r\nstanzas. While his popularity waned with the years and new rivals, he\r\nwas long the honored bard of France, with name linked with that of\r\nVictor Hugo in his meditative poetry. The Nobel prize stimulated new\r\ninterest among world readers; more translations and critical estimates\r\nappeared--and are still being issued. Maurice Baring in a recent book\r\nof criticism, _Punch and Judy and Other Essays_, has written words of\r\nsuccinct analysis of this French poet: he distinguishes him as “a poet\r\nwho thinks and not a thinker who merely uses poetry for recreation.” He\r\nadds, of his simple yet fastidious form, “Other poets have had a more\r\nglowing imagination; his verse is neither exuberant in colour nor rich\r\nin sonorous combinations of sound. The grace of his verse is one of\r\noutline and not of colour; his compositions are distinguished by his\r\nsubtle rhythm; his verse is as if carved in ivory, his music is like\r\nthat of a unison of stringed instruments.”[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRÉDÉRIC MISTRAL\r\n\r\nPoet of Provence\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1904 has been awarded, one half to:\r\n\r\n  Mistral, Frédéric, born 1830, died March 25, 1914: “for reason of\r\n  the fresh originality, rich genius, and true artistry in his poetry\r\n  that faithfully mirrors the nature and life of the people of his\r\n  native country; and also with respect to his significant activity as\r\n  Provençal philologist.”[16]\r\n\r\nThree years after the first Nobel prize in literature had been awarded\r\nto Sully-Prudhomme, it came again to a writer who is ranked among\r\nFrench authors, although he is distinctively of Provence, Frédéric\r\nMistral. This poet of _Mireio_, a pastoral epic, if one may use the\r\nterm, and the preserver of the Provençal language from literary\r\noblivion, shared the financial award and the honor for 1904 with\r\nEchegaray, the Spanish dramatist, who is discussed in another chapter\r\nof this book. Mistral was seventy-four years old when this recognition\r\ncame to him; he lived for ten years longer, wielding influence upon\r\nworld literature and receiving reverential homage in his own Provence.\r\nHis home in later years was in the same quiet town of Maillane, in the\r\nBouches-du-Rhône where he was born in 1830.\r\n\r\nHis father was a wealthy farmer who had aspirations to make his son\r\na lawyer. The boy was sent to school at Avignon and, later, took his\r\ndegree at Nîmes University and studied at Aix. One of the teachers\r\nat Avignon was Joseph Roumanille who had a large share in restoring\r\ninterest in the language. He compiled a fixed orthography of the\r\nProvençal forms and revived racial sentiment in the schools. Like his\r\npupil, Mistral, he was a firm advocate of classic poetry. Twenty years\r\nbefore, a famous barber, Jacques Jasmin of Agen, had recited troubadour\r\nsongs throughout the villages and had preserved, by voice, many native\r\nlegends and folk ballads. It is said that he gave his receipts in money\r\nto charity and that, within a few years, he had gathered $300,000. The\r\nschool-teacher formed a society of young men at Avignon, including\r\n“seven poets and dreamers,” among whom were numbered Roumanille,\r\nMistral, Aubaniel, Mathieu, and Brunet. They pledged allegiance to\r\nPoetry, Love, and Provence. There has been general acceptance of\r\nthe statement that Mistral gave to this group of poets the name of\r\nFélibres, originally called “The Seven Félibres” or Scribes of the Law.\r\nThey agreed to write in their native language of Provence, to extend\r\nits knowledge and use, so that it might be more than a dialect. They\r\nmaintained that it was similar to that of the medieval troubadours,\r\nthat it came from the language of Rome and thus was the parent\r\ntongue of Italy, France, and Spain. Although some of these statements\r\nhave been seriously questioned by orthographers, the enthusiasm of\r\nthese Félibres was acclaimed and literary masterpieces followed; the\r\ncelebrations of the Félibres are still noteworthy festivals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of The New York Public Library_\r\n\r\nFRÉDÉRIC MISTRAL]\r\n\r\nAnother story is that Mistral, who was very fond of his mother, began\r\nto write his verses in French and brought them to her, assured of her\r\nencouragement and praise. Alas! his mother could not read French,\r\nalthough she was confident that her son was a poet of rare genius. “Let\r\nus sing in the language of our mother!” was the determination of the\r\nyouth. He collected legends, folk-tales, and romantic episodes from\r\nevery possible source near his home in Provence. In 1858 was published\r\nthe first edition of _Mireio_, the pastoral epic which has held its\r\nliterary rank, with increasing appreciation, for more than sixty\r\nyears. Roumanille was sponsor for this work; the next year a French\r\ntranslation was made by Mistral and the book amazed Parisians by its\r\npoetic charm. It was dedicated to Lamartine. Mistral was compared, by\r\nenthusiastic critics, to Vergil, Theocritus, and Ariosto.\r\n\r\nInto the twelve Cantos of his poem Mistral wove many local customs and\r\npersonal memories. The _mas_, or farmstead, was modeled from his own\r\nhome and Ramoun, the wealthy _mas_-dweller, had many traits of his\r\nown father. Familiar to him from boyhood had been the festivals and\r\ndaily tasks here portrayed--the wheat-threshing, the snail-gathering,\r\nthe fireside meals, the dance of the farandole on the eve of harvest\r\nday. In outline it is a simple, somewhat conventional theme. Mireio,\r\ndaughter of a “farmer-prince,” loved the son of a poor basket-weaver;\r\ntheir romance had days of joy and nights of deep sorrow; the epical\r\nclimax of the death of Mireio at the Church of the Holy Maries is\r\nrelieved of its grim tragedy by the words of hope on the lips of the\r\ndying heroine.\r\n\r\nThere is a gayety of spirit, a zest of life in the opening lines of\r\nInvocation, the poet’s promise to tell the life story of this lovely\r\ngirl of fifteen and her innocent, ardent passion:\r\n\r\n    I sing the love of a Provençal maid;\r\n    How through the wheat-fields of La Crau she strayed\r\n    Following the fate that drew her to the sea.\r\n    Unknown beyond remote La Crau was she;\r\n    And I, who tell the rustic tale of her,\r\n    Would fain be Homer’s humble follower.\r\n\r\n    What though youth’s aureole was her only crown?\r\n    And never gold she wore, nor damask gown?\r\n    I’ll build her up a throne out of my song,\r\n    And hail her queen in our despis’d tongue.\r\n    Mine be the simple speech that ye all know,\r\n    Shepherds and farmer-folk of lone La Crau.\r\n\r\nThe romantic episodes are told in the cantos, “The Suitors,” “The\r\nBattle,” “The Witch,” “The Saints,” “Death.” Graphic pictures of local\r\ncustoms and setting are suggested by the subtitles “Lotus Farm,”\r\n“Leaf-Picking,” “The Cocooning,” and “the Camargue” (or salty marshes\r\nof the Rhône). Exquisite songs are interspersed like this in Canto III,\r\n“The Cocooning”:\r\n\r\n    If thou the moon wilt be,\r\n    Sailing in glory,\r\n    I’ll be the halo white\r\n    Hovering every night\r\n    Around and o’er thee.\r\n\r\n    If thou become a flower,\r\n    Before thou thinkest,\r\n    I’ll be a streamlet clear,\r\n    And all the waters bear\r\n    That thou, love, drinkest.\r\n\r\n_Mireio_ was made familiar to American readers of the last generation\r\nby the translation of Harriet Waters Preston (Boston, 1872). Several\r\nexcerpts from her verse-interpretations of this and Mistral’s later\r\npoems are to be found in _Library of the World’s Best Literature_,\r\nedited by Charles Dudley Warner; an excellent sketch of the poet is\r\nfound here. With unique, virile words George Meredith has rendered\r\ninto verse some stanzas from Canto X, “The Mares of Camargue”:[17]\r\n\r\n    A hundred mares, all white! their manes\r\n    Like mace-reed of the marshy plains\r\n    Thick-tufted, wavy, free o’ the shears:\r\n    And when the fiery squadron rears\r\n    Bursting at speed, each mane appears\r\n    Even as the white scarf of a fay\r\n    Floating upon their necks along the heavens away.\r\n\r\nWhen the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of _Mireio_ was\r\ncelebrated at Arles, Calvé sang the “Song of Magali” and noted French\r\nactors and opera artists rendered Gounod’s _Mireille_, which is based\r\nupon Mistral’s pastoral. The most dramatic canto is the eighth, the\r\nflight of the heroine across the rocky plains of La Crau, finding\r\nshelter at the shrine of the Holy Maries. The maiden’s prayer for help\r\nin her hour of need, for understanding of her love for her “handsome\r\nVincen,” is wistful and appealing. Two cantos have been devoted to\r\nrevival of these old legends of the Holy Maries. Disciples of Jesus,\r\ndriven from Palestine after his crucifixion, according to tradition,\r\nwere set afloat in a barque by their persecutors. They had neither\r\nsail nor oars. They were washed ashore on the sacred soil where now\r\nstands the village of Les Saintes Maries. Among these disciples were\r\nLazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, their servant Sarah (who was\r\nthe patron saint of gypsies), Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and\r\nTrophine, one of the oldest and wisest of the disciples who converted\r\nto Christianity the town of Arles.\r\n\r\nTwo long narrative poems followed _Mireio_--_Calendau_ and _Nerto_.\r\nThe former, published in 1867, is more potent in dramatic skill than\r\nthe earlier pastoral. It has lines of emotional intensity, when the\r\nheroine, a Princess who lost her rank because of love for a humble\r\nsuitor, inspires him by her fine spirit and tales of prowess and\r\nchivalry. “The Scaling of Ventour” is a dramatic episode in this poem.\r\nTwo stanzas, translated by Harriet Waters Preston, indicate the action\r\nand colorful quality; this is a description of “the catch”:[18]\r\n\r\n    Yet had we brave and splendid sport, I ween,\r\n    For some with tridents, some with lances keen,\r\n    Fell on the prey. And some were skilled to fling\r\n    A winged dart held by a slender string.\r\n    The wounded wretches, ’neath the wave withdrew,\r\n    Trailing red lines along the mirror blue.\r\n\r\n    Slowly the net brimful of treasures mounted;\r\n    Silver was there, turquoise and gold uncounted,\r\n    Rubies and emeralds million-rayed. The men\r\n    Flung them thereon like eager children when\r\n    They stay their mother’s footsteps to explore\r\n    Her apron bursting with its summer store\r\n    Of apricots and cherries.\r\n\r\nThere is less atmosphere in _Nerto_, an epic tale of the last days of\r\nthe Popes at Avignon and “the miraculous burial-place,”\r\n\r\n    The Aliscamp of history\r\n      Far below Arles.\r\n\r\nThe legend of this spot is one of the best portions of _Nerto_:\r\n\r\n                  out of the heaven came,\r\n    Our Lord himself to bless the spot,\r\n    And left, if the tale erreth not\r\n    The impress of his bended knee,\r\n    Rock-graven. Howso this may be,\r\n    Full oft a swarm of angels white\r\n    Bends hither, on a tranquil night,\r\n    Singing celestial harmonies.[19]\r\n\r\nAmong the collections of lyrics of love and patriotism by Mistral the\r\nearlier volume in 1875, entitled _Les Isles d’Or_, contained songs in\r\nmany moods. Lamartine listened to recital of these and other verses\r\n“in the sweet nervous idiom of Provence, which combines the Latin\r\npronunciation with the grace of Attica and the serenity of Tuscany.”\r\nHe adds, “The verses of Mistral were liquid and melodious, they pleased\r\nwithout intoxicating me.”[20] The later collection, issued in 1912,\r\nwas entitled _Les Olivades_. Mistral thus explained the title: “The\r\ndays that grow chill and the swelling seas--all things tell me that\r\nthe winter of my life has come, and that I must without delay gather\r\n_my_ olives and offer the virgin-oil on the altar of God.” At this time\r\nthe poet was eighty-two years old. He had written an autobiography,\r\n_Mes origines_, with reminiscences of his youth, which was translated\r\nas _Memoirs of Mistral_ by Constance Elisabeth Maud; the lyrics of\r\nProvence were rendered into English here by Alma Strettell (Mrs.\r\nLawrence Harrison).\r\n\r\nFew writers have had more intensive love of country than Mistral. He\r\nrefused the offer of a chair in the French Academy because it would\r\nnecessitate leaving Provence; he was given prizes by the Academy and\r\nbadges of the Legion. Late in mature years he married a beautiful young\r\nwoman of Arlesian family; she has been crowned Queen of the Félibres,\r\nin a yearly festival of contests and songs. Towards the close of the\r\nnineteenth century Mistral began collecting specimens of Provençal\r\nflowers, rocks, and archeological relics for a museum at Arles; he\r\ncalled this his “last poem.” In a typical _mas_, or farmstead, he\r\nplaced these collections and equipment of varied kinds, showing\r\nthe customs of the land. He represented, also, certain feasts and\r\ntraditions by wax figures. Among others, here is the Arlesian legend\r\nof the feast of Noël and the visit of three women to a mother and her\r\nfirst-born; one brings a match that the child’s body may be straight,\r\nanother brings an egg, that his life may be full, and a third brings\r\nsalt, symbol of wisdom.[21] A large part of the Nobel prize money was\r\nused by Mistral for the housing and equipment of this Museum.\r\n\r\nAlphonse Daudet, like Mistral, is a native of Provence. The natives\r\nadmire the literary grace and wit of the former, “even if he may laugh\r\nat us occasionally,” they say, but they _love_ Mistral. For ten years\r\nthe latter worked upon his _Comprehensive Lexicon of Ancient and Modern\r\nProvençal_, which was published in two large volumes in 1886. He was\r\nhonored by the educated classes and loved by the peasantry, landowners,\r\nand boatmen of the Rhône. In 1897 he incorporated into his narrative\r\nin verse, _Le poème du Rhône_, many customs and songs of the days\r\nbefore steamships had increased the speed of travel and reduced its\r\npicturesqueness. In twelve cantos he celebrated this famous river and\r\nits border towns. A dramatic scene recalled the flight of Napoleon\r\nacross the border from Russia. As poetic art this poem is inferior\r\nto _Mireio_ or _Calendau_; it lacks spontaneity yet it has musical\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nPoet of the soil was Mistral, akin in his simplicity and loyalty to\r\nBurns and Whittier, although more of a scholar and technician than\r\neither of these writers of verse. Like them, however, he created anew\r\nthe life of his rural people; he touched daily incidents with poetic\r\nbeauty. He received many distinguished visitors from every country in\r\nhis later years and treasured letters from scholars of every land.\r\nAmong the latter was a letter from Theodore Roosevelt written when he\r\nwas President and had received a copy of a new edition of _Mireio_;\r\nto the poet he acknowledged his indebtedness of many years for the\r\ndelights that he had found in this wistful love poem of Provence, which\r\nmirrored so perfectly the traditions and life of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1901.\r\n\r\n[9] London and New York, 1924.\r\n\r\n[10] London and New York, 1922, pp. 133-144.

In 1902, Theodor Mommsen, whose\r\nrecords of scholarship included history, law and archeology, was\r\nthe chosen candidate. He was eighty-four years old and lived for\r\nonly a year after the award. While there was gratification among his\r\ncountrymen and friends in other lands, at his recognition and this high\r\nhonor, yet there were adverse comments in several journals about the\r\nperversion of the intent of Nobel’s will. The recipient had finished\r\nhis work; the award could never quicken him to further research or\r\nexpression of idealism. This choice showed the intention of the\r\nSwedish Academy to consider “literature” in a broad sense, including\r\ncontributions of scientific value as well as those of artistic merit.\r\n\r\nGarding, in Schleswig, was the birthplace of Mommsen; his school days\r\nwere spent at Kiel. Before he was thirty years old he had been employed\r\nby the Berlin Academy to decipher and examine Roman inscriptions in\r\nItaly and France, because of marked accuracy and zest in research. He\r\ncombined the reading of law with that of history and, in 1848, was\r\ncalled to the department of law at Leipzig University. Always fearless\r\nin political convictions and ardent in Liberalism, he was obliged\r\nto retire from this University because of active participation in\r\nthe political issues of 1848-1849. Two years later he was called to\r\nprofessorship of Roman law at Zürich; after service here for two years\r\nhe accepted a similar position at Breslau. In all these places he\r\nwas recognized as magnetic in the classroom and inspirational in his\r\ncontact with University students from all parts of the civilized world.\r\nIn 1858, he went to the University of Berlin as Professor of Ancient\r\nHistory and there extended his influence among scholars and lay readers.\r\n\r\nAlthough specific in his interests and a student of deep earnestness,\r\nhe had read and traveled widely; as conversationalist he excelled,\r\ninformed upon topics in almost every branch of learning and activity.\r\nTo him has been attributed the oft quoted sentence, “Each student must\r\nchoose his special field of labour but he must not imprison himself\r\nwithin its confines.”[23] He was called “the modern Erasmus” because\r\nof his versatile knowledge. He wrote with facility and grace, as well\r\nas vigor, whether his theme was a monumental _History of Rome_, or\r\na journalistic discussion of current affairs. In political creed he\r\nbelonged to the National Liberal Party. He was, however, never partisan\r\nin his ultimate purposes and hopes for future union of factions. He\r\nopposed Bismarck in his tenets and sometimes won over him in courts of\r\nlaw and in the Prussian House of Delegates, by his keen, logical mind.\r\nAt the same time, he admired the Chancellor very much and said, “What a\r\ncalamity it is for us all that political animosity should deprive us of\r\nthe privilege of mixing socially with such a man!” On principle, he was\r\nopposed to British attitude towards the Boers, and gave his allegiance\r\nto the revolutionists. Again, he deplored the strained relations at\r\ntimes between his country and England and asserted, “What a pity that\r\ntwo great nations of kindred race should remain at loggerheads!”[24] He\r\ndetested slavery and considered the Civil War in the United States “a\r\nholy crusade.”[25]\r\n\r\nMore than one hundred volumes of original writing and translations\r\nfrom the Latin and Germanic languages are listed under Mommsen’s name\r\nin large German libraries. Edward A. Freeman, a critic and historian\r\nof international repute, has called Mommsen “the greatest scholar\r\nof our times, well-nigh the greatest scholar of all times.” His\r\nwritings show mastery of law, languages, customs, archeology, coins,\r\ninscriptions and monuments, that are of inestimable value to students.\r\nHe was editor of _Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum_ which was issued\r\nby the Berlin Academy of which he was secretary for many years. To\r\nthe average reader, however, the name of Theodor Mommsen will always\r\nbe associated with his _History of Rome_, written 1854-1856, which\r\nstill maintains its authenticity and popularity. As a writer, Mommsen\r\nwas always illumining, with a vivid style; he was often dramatic. He\r\ntouched descriptive scenes with grace and color but he was convincingly\r\nrealistic in his portrayal of events and characters. He unfolded a\r\nlarge canvas but he kept a true focus and threw a strong light upon\r\nboth individuals and group-pictures, from the early days of Rome to the\r\ndeath of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nAlthough his masterwork was entitled _History of Rome_, he explained,\r\nin the Introductory Chapter, that he intended “to relate the history\r\nof Italy, not simply the record of the city of Rome.” While the Romans\r\nrepresented the most powerful branch of the Italian stock, yet they\r\nwere only a branch--but this civic community of Rome gained sovereignty\r\nover Italy and the world of its day. Like the historian Freeman,\r\nMommsen insisted upon “the unity of history,” the similarity of human\r\nnature from 1800 B. C. to modern times. Few writers have surpassed him\r\nin revivifying historical characters. He had strong likes and dislikes,\r\nprejudices which he could impress upon the reader, although he was\r\ngenerally justified in his statements and balanced in his estimates.\r\nThe portrait of Cicero, which “was bitten with vitriolic energy,” as\r\nMr. Buchan has said, in _Some Eighteenth Century Byways and Other\r\nEssays_, has been most widely quoted; it is less impartial than his\r\ncharacterizations of Hannibal, Sully, and Cæsar. By temperament and\r\npolitical bias, Mommsen was an admirer of Julius Cæsar; he has given to\r\nhim a living portraiture.\r\n\r\nThe pictorial Chapter IV in Book III, descriptive of Hannibal’s Passage\r\nof the Alps, is a world-famous extract from this _History of Rome_.\r\nIn the same chapter is the analysis of Hannibal’s character, so often\r\nquoted: “He was primarily marked by that inventive craftiness, which\r\nforms one of the leading traits of the Phœnician character; he was\r\nfond of taking singular and unexpected routes: ambushes and stratagems\r\nof all sorts were familiar to him; he studied the character of his\r\nantagonists with unprecedented care.... The power which he wielded\r\nover men is shown by his incomparable control over an army of various\r\nnatives and many tongues.... He was a great man; wherever he went, he\r\nriveted the eyes of all.”[26]\r\n\r\nThere is history of dramatic incident, written with pictorial skill,\r\nin such passages as the Battle of Cannæ, the story of the Gracchi, and\r\nthe Crossing of the Rubicon. The breadth of Mommsen’s interests are\r\nsuggested by such later chapters as those on Roman Religion, Manners,\r\nand Literature and Art. While he was deeply interested in the past,\r\nand informed about its aspects and personalities, he was alert in all\r\nmovements of the present and their trends. He looked to the future\r\nwith prevision and optimism. In the Introductory Chapter to his famous\r\n_History of Rome_ he contrasts modern history with past cycles of\r\nculture which will be repeated and adds: “And yet this goal will only\r\nbe temporary: the grandest system of civilization has its orbit, and\r\nmay complete its course; but not so the human race, to which, just\r\nwhen it seems to have reached its goal, the old task is ever set anew,\r\nwith a wider range and with a deeper meaning.”[27] In spirit, Mommsen\r\nwas entitled to rank as an idealist, a worker “to benefit mankind.”\r\nIn literary achievements he richly deserved the Nobel prize; his\r\nresearches had enriched human knowledge beyond those of other scholars;\r\nhis writings appealed to the reader of ordinary mentality as well as\r\nto the more intellectual; his vision and faith in human progress were\r\nundimmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDOLF EUCKEN\r\n\r\nGerman Philosopher\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1908 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  Eucken, Rudolf, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Jena,\r\n  born 1846: “because of the sincerity of his search for truth, the\r\n  penetrating power of thought, the clarity of vision, the warmth and\r\n  force of interpretation with which he has, in his numerous works,\r\n  cultivated and developed an ideal world philosophy.”[28]\r\n\r\nIn 1908, six years after the Nobel prize came to Mommsen, it was again\r\nawarded to a German scholar, Rudolf Eucken. By translation and lectures\r\nin countries other than his own, this recipient was no stranger to\r\nreaders of current literature. Born in 1846, in Aurich, East Friesland,\r\nEucken was younger than the majority of the earlier winners; he\r\naccomplished much writing and lecturing after the honor had been given.\r\nHis mature life was devoted to a struggle against the materialistic\r\nphilosophy of his day. He was a worthy winner of a prize for “the most\r\ndistinguished work of an idealistic tendency” in his country. His\r\nincessant purpose was expressed in his autobiography: “My reminiscences\r\ntell about all of the struggle to prevent the externalization of life.\r\nThis externalization is not, it is true, the defect or fault of one\r\nparticular nation; it is found in every nation and a radical change is\r\nneeded in each.... Every man who shares the conviction that a spiritual\r\nreformation is needed will follow with a kindly sympathy the modest\r\nefforts which are recorded in my reminiscences.”[29]\r\n\r\nHis native province, East Friesland, is an agricultural and trading\r\nregion in Germany, near Holland, with occasional fisheries as industry.\r\nHis birth town, Aurich, is the commercial and social center. The boy’s\r\nchildhood was somewhat sad; he was the first child born to his parents\r\nafter ten years of marriage, and his father died when the lad was five\r\nyears old. He had a series of misfortunes in his infancy and youth: his\r\nthroat was badly torn in the effort to extricate a curtain-fastener\r\nwhich he nearly swallowed as a baby; he had scarlet fever and wrong\r\ntreatment, so that he was threatened with blindness for a time but\r\nrecovered; a younger brother’s death added to the family gloom.\r\n\r\nRudolf Eucken inherited studious inclinations. His father, spending\r\nhis days in the postal service, was a fine mathematician. His mother\r\n(daughter of a clergyman who was a leader of Radicalism) was well-read\r\nin science and ambitious for her son; the latter records that she\r\nwas, also, a practical housewife. After the father’s death their\r\nfinances were low and the mother took lodgers to add to her income.\r\nShe was determined that Rudolf should be well educated, that he should\r\nbecome a philosopher or scientist. He recalls his debt to her in\r\nhis reminiscences. At the gymnasium at Aurich he showed interest in\r\nmathematics and in music. A strong influence of those plastic days\r\nwas his teacher, Reuter, who was forced to retire by the bureaucracy\r\nbecause of his liberalism. Other professors who left traces upon his\r\ndevelopment were Letze and Teichmüller. For a time he was at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin. After experimental teaching he was called to\r\nBasel as professor of philosophy. His mother went with him but their\r\nplans for happy years together were shattered by her death.\r\n\r\nBasel was at this time a small University with about one hundred\r\nand fifty students; Eucken came into close contact with these in\r\nthe classroom and outside activities. Already he had begun to write\r\nstudies upon philosophers of classic days, Aristotle and others. In\r\n1873 he accepted a call to Jena University where he was brought into\r\ncomradeship with such brilliant associates as Kuno Fischer, Haeckel and\r\nHildebrand. The issue, in 1878, of Eucken’s book, _Fundamental Ideas of\r\nthe Present Day_ (or _The Fundamental Concepts of Modern Philosophic\r\nThought_) aroused sudden interest among scholars of every country in\r\nthis daring, idealistic philosopher of Jena University. The basic idea\r\nwas to emphasize the harmonious relations of history and criticism. At\r\nthe request of President Noah Porter of Yale University, a translation\r\nof this book into English was made by Professor M. Stuart Phelps; thus\r\nAmerican readers became acquainted with this German scholar who was to\r\nenter later into friendly contact with academic organizations here.\r\n\r\nBy his marriage, in 1882, to Irene Passow, Eucken increased his\r\nprestige among intellectual and social leaders. He says that his wife\r\n“was not one of the learned women,” but that she had intellectual\r\ninterests, gifts in art, and fine administrative ability. Her\r\nmother was the daughter of the noted archeologist, Ulrich, born in\r\nAthens; thus Eucken’s circle of friends widened among scientists and\r\nhistorians. He continued to write books with cumulative power, like\r\n_The Life of the Spirit_, _Contributions to the History of Modern\r\nPhilosophy_, _The Problem of Human Life as Viewed by the Great\r\nThinkers_, _Life’s Basis and Life’s Ideals_, _Christianity and the\r\nNew Idealism_.[30] Many of his own countrymen, who were materialistic\r\nphilosophers or monistic evolutionists, criticized Eucken severely;\r\nhe declared the German press “ignored him.” He popularized religious\r\nphilosophy, especially under such titles as _The Truth of Religion_,\r\nand _Can We Still Be Christians?_ He was invited to deliver lectures in\r\nHolland, France, England, and America.\r\n\r\nSome of these later books followed the award of the Nobel prize\r\nin 1908. He was called “the winning dark horse of that year”; he\r\nsaid that the honor came as “a great surprise” to him. As further\r\nrecognition he was made a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences.\r\nThe comments in the German press were noticeably restrained beside\r\nthe enthusiastic tributes in France, Holland, and England. In 1911 he\r\nwent to England and, later, to America as academic lecturer; he was\r\n“exchange professor” and gave lectures at Harvard University, Columbia\r\nUniversity, the Lowell Institute at Boston, and Smith College. His wife\r\nand daughter came with him to America and were guests in the homes\r\nof Professors Moore and Münsterburg at Cambridge. The reader of his\r\nReminiscences will smile at some of the comments upon Americans and his\r\nreception here. In Germany, with the arrival of “an exchange professor”\r\nand his first lecture, there is a demonstration of welcome, with formal\r\nprogram and the presence of notables in statescraft as well as letters.\r\nHe found no such condition at Harvard University. He presented himself\r\nto President Lowell and was told, “You may begin at once.”[31] By\r\ncontrast he says, with naïveté, President Butler of Columbia University\r\ngave a banquet in honor of Eucken and Bergson, who were lecturing in\r\nNew York at the same time.\r\n\r\nAmong Americans whom the German scholar met with friendly contact were\r\nAndrew Carnegie and Roosevelt. He says of the latter, “With Roosevelt I\r\nhad a very spirited conversation on American idealism and its future,\r\nin which he gave proof of considerable historical knowledge.”[32] He\r\nfound Americans, as a class, alert but not well informed on European\r\naffairs, especially German history. After he returned from America,\r\nhe planned a trip to Japan and China, hoping to carry into the Orient\r\nhis principles of idealistic philosophy; he sought coöperation of\r\nall nations in “solving problems of life.” The war interfered with\r\nthis project and caused him deep depression. He tried in every way to\r\nappeal to the less materialistic traits of his people. In 1915, he\r\nwrote _The Bearers of German Idealism_, a book which sold copies by the\r\ntens of thousands and supplemented, in a way, his earlier volume, _The\r\nHistorical Significance of the German People_. He found the war “the\r\nsaddest moment in German history”; he felt the nations were disloyal to\r\nthemselves and sentiments of honor. His daughter, a musician of rare\r\ngifts, lost her lover during the war. In his sons, one a physician\r\nand another a political economist, Eucken saw examples of many of his\r\nidealistic influences.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Eucken, especially those of religious trend, have been\r\npopular in America, as well as England. Several of his essays have been\r\ncollected and translated by Meyrick Booth. _In the Harper’s Library\r\nof Living Thought_ is the translation by Lucy Judge Gibson and W. R.\r\nBoyce Gibson of his _Christianity and the New Idealism_ (1909 and\r\n1912). _The Meaning and Value of Life_ had one of the same translators;\r\nJoseph McCabe, who translated the autobiography, has rendered, also,\r\n_Socialism: an Analysis_ (1922). Among other books in constant demand\r\nat libraries are _Religion and Life_, the lectures which he gave in\r\nLondon, Oxford, and elsewhere, 1911, and _Ethics and Modern Thought: a\r\nTheory of their Relations_, which were the Deems lectures, delivered\r\nin 1913 at New York University. These are translated by Margaret von\r\nSeydewitz from the German manuscript. _Can We Still Be Christians?_\r\nwith its challenging title (1914) is a careful, tolerant study of\r\nhistoric Christianity, an advocacy of a religion which will adapt\r\nitself to the demands of daily life. Spirituality and morality must\r\ncombine to form a high level of progress and the Church must become “a\r\nrepository of the facts and tasks of life itself.”\r\n\r\nComparisons have often been made between Eucken and two other modern\r\nthinkers and writers on philosophy of kindred motive--Adolf Harnack\r\nand Henri Bergson. The former, who has been professor at Leipzig and\r\nBerlin, author of such stirring books as _What Is Christianity?_ and\r\n_History of Dogma_, has the German background while Bergson, in his\r\n_Creative Philosophy_ has written an epoch-making book with dissimilar\r\nbut potent deductions. The two men, Eucken and Bergson, have been\r\ndiscussed in a discriminating essay by E. Hermann who thus summarizes\r\nthe message of the Nobel prize winner in philosophy: “Eucken stands\r\nbefore us today as perhaps the greatest thinker of our age and the\r\nprotagonist of a new idealism which satisfies our demands for moral\r\nreality as no idealistic philosophy has ever done, and as the teacher\r\nwho has most fully and boldly developed the religious implications\r\nof ethical idealism. His philosophy of life is an insistence upon\r\nthe supremacy of the spiritual. His defence of freedom is a doctrine\r\nof spiritual liberty rooted in the saving initiative of God and\r\nour dependence on Him. His vindication of our personality is the\r\nrescue of the free, God-centered personality from the thralldom of a\r\nself-centered individuality.”[33]\r\n\r\nEspecially interesting is the Nobel Lecture, delivered at Stockholm,\r\nMarch 27, 1909, by Eucken, translated by Alban G. Widgery, Cambridge,\r\n1912 (W. Heffer and Sons). As an introductory thought, Eucken\r\nemphasizes that we are living in an age when tradition has become a\r\nsubject of doubt and new ideas are struggling to guide our lives.\r\nThe two terms, “_Naturalism or Idealism_,” which form the title of\r\nthis Nobel address, have become confused in meaning and have caused\r\nmisunderstandings. To Eucken, Naturalism means “faith in man’s\r\nrelation to Nature”; Idealism accepts this faith but asks if this is\r\nthe whole of life or if there is not another kind of life, also. He\r\npleads for domination of “The True, the Good and the Beautiful” in\r\nlife, not merely utilitarian aspects. Life is not just a reflection of\r\na given reality but a striving upward; it does not _find_ another world\r\nbut “it may _produce_ one.” Idealism which deals with such expansion\r\nof daily life has no new aims to-day beyond that of classic times but\r\nit is emphasized, because “we have been driven beyond the standards\r\nof Naturalism.” The task before literature is coöperation in this\r\neffort to reach a higher level, “to purify and confirm, to make the\r\nfundamental problems of our spiritual existence _impressive_ to us,\r\nto raise life above the mere transient culture, by the realization of\r\nsomething eternal.” This, as he interprets it, was the idea of Alfred\r\nNobel in his will and awards; this has been the life purpose of Eucken\r\nas teacher and writer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1902.\r\n\r\n[23] _Bookman_, 18: 346.\r\n\r\n[24] _Ibid._ 346-348, December, 1903, article on Mommsen.

It was a fitting choice for\r\nhe was a vigorous advocate of world peace, an ardent worker in all\r\ncauses for “the benefit of mankind.” When the award in literature for\r\n1903 was given to him, he was already known as “Norway’s Father.” As\r\nwriter of novels and plays, he had been read more widely than almost\r\nany other Scandinavian of his day, at that time surpassing Ibsen in\r\ntranslated works. As publicist and orator, as manager of theatres and\r\ncivic legislator, he exerted national influence. In giving him the\r\nNobel prize the adjudicators had in memory, especially, his earlier\r\ntales of peasant life which intermingled poetic idealism with sagas\r\nand realistic pictures of Norwegian life. His plays of later years,\r\n_Beyond Human Power_, _The Editor_, and _Sigurd Slembe_, were problem\r\nplays that awakened discussion in many countries; they were more\r\nuniversal and realistic in tone than the earlier fiction. Björnson had\r\na remarkable combination of virility and gentleness. He was a Viking\r\nclansman, as he often averred, but he was also a poet, loving the\r\nfolk songs and pictorial delights of rugged Norway with deep, ardent\r\naffection. The symbol of his strength, represented twice in the lingual\r\nroot of his name--Björn, a bear--was fitting for his large, fearless\r\nmind and spiritual energy. He was a warrior when occasion demanded\r\nresistance to evil; he was a skald when he wrote tales of peasantry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of The American-Scandinavian Foundation_\r\n\r\nBJÖRNSTJERNE BJÖRNSON]\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1832 at Kvikne, in the valley of the Dovre Mountains.\r\nHe lived seven years after the Nobel prize was given to him, keeping\r\nhis mentality alert until almost the end of his seventy-eight years.\r\nHis father was pastor in this small place, without beauty of scenery\r\nor fertility of soil. When the boy was six years old the family moved\r\nto a region of marked contrasts, in Romsdale. His memories of this\r\npicturesque scenery and his delights in the valleys, hills, and fjord,\r\nwere commemorated in his poem, “Over the Lofty Mountains.” His school\r\ndays at Molde were busy and happy; he read with insatiable appetite for\r\nsagas and history, and became devoted to the Swedish poet, Wergeland.\r\nAt seventeen he went to Christiania to prepare for the University.\r\nHere he was a schoolmate of Ibsen; with typical humor he wrote--and\r\ntreasured--this doggerel of these early days:\r\n\r\n    Overstrained and lean, of the colour of gypsum,\r\n    Behind a beard, huge and black, was seen Henrik Ibsen.\r\n\r\nThe two families cemented their friendship of many years by the\r\nmarriage of Björnson’s daughter, Bergliot, a singer of much talent, to\r\nthe son of Ibsen.\r\n\r\nAt Christiania, Björnson became much interested in Danish literature,\r\nespecially drama, and he began his play, _The Newly-married Couple_,\r\nwhich was not finished until a decade later. He completed, however, a\r\none-act play, _Between the Battles_, which was staged in Christiania\r\nwith only moderate success. For a time he abandoned drama and devoted\r\nhimself to the peasant tales, to characters of types familiar to him,\r\nagainst a background of Norwegian folklore. He was proud to recall\r\nthat his forefathers were peasants; he knew the common people and\r\nsympathized with their customs and ambitions. He sought to blend sagas\r\nand scenes from modern life, with mutual interpretation. Those early\r\nstories of simple life, _Arne_, _The Fisher Maiden_, _A Happy Boy_,\r\nand _Synnöve Solbakken_, were well received in Denmark and Germany, as\r\nwell as his own country. Soon they were translated into English and\r\ncommended for their simplicity, poetry, and national spirit. Sir Edmund\r\nGosse, writing in the late 1880’s, said of Björnson: “His spirit was as\r\nmasculine as a Viking’s and as pure and tender as a maiden’s. Through\r\nthese little romances there blows a wind as fragrant and refreshing as\r\nthe odour of the Trondhjem balsam willows, blown out to sea to welcome\r\nthe newcomer; and just as this rare scent is the first thing that tells\r\nthe traveller of Norway, so the purity of Björnson’s _novelettes_\r\nis usually the first thing to attract a foreigner to Norwegian\r\nliterature.”[35]\r\n\r\nMr. Georg Brandes, in his excellent study of Björnson in _Creative\r\nSpirits of the Nineteenth Century_, affirms that the popularity of\r\nthese peasant tales was not so great throughout Norway as one is\r\ninclined to believe from later reports. “People loved the peasant\r\nin the abstract” but they did not know him, nor were they deeply\r\ninterested in his welfare or his aspirations. Moreover, the critics\r\nfound them sentimental and failed to appreciate the legends and\r\nparables which were often interspersed, like the beautiful symbolism\r\nin the opening paragraphs of _Arne_ with the several trees--juniper,\r\noak, birch, and heather--seeking to clothe the mountain. In the two\r\ntales, _Synnöve Solbakken_ and _Arne_, Björnson represented two heroes\r\nof Norwegian life; Thorbjörn of the first story was the youth of\r\nphysical virility, developed by contact with gentler influences; Arne,\r\nby contrast, was dreamy and poetic, in need of more robust experiences.\r\nThere are wistful strains of melody in this story of _Arne_--this\r\nyearning for the ideal. Sir Edmund Gosse has translated one of these\r\nlyrics in rhymed couplets:\r\n\r\n    Through the forest the boy wends all day long,\r\n    For there he has heard such a wonderful song.\r\n\r\n    He carved him a flute of the willow tree,\r\n    And tried what the tune within it might be.\r\n\r\n    The tune came out of it sad and gay,\r\n    But while he listened it passed away.\r\n\r\n    He fell asleep, and once more it sung,\r\n    And over his forehead it lovingly hung.\r\n\r\n    He thought he would catch it and wildly woke,\r\n    And the tune in the frail night faded and broke.\r\n\r\n    “Oh God, my God, take me up to Thee,\r\n    For the tune Thou hast made is consuming me.”\r\n\r\n    And the Lord God said, “’Tis a friend divine,\r\n    Though never one hour shalt thou hold it thine.\r\n\r\n    Yet all other music is poor and thin\r\n    By the side of this which thou never shalt win.”[36]\r\n\r\nThe character of Arne, the poetic, restless boy who tries to break\r\naway from the rock-ribbed confines of Norway, is an individual and a\r\nnational type; his mother, Marit, is one of the most real, appealing\r\nwomen of Norwegian fiction. In these two peasant tales, and the\r\nlighter, more joyful romance of _A Happy Boy_, is found some of the\r\nbest poetry by Björnson. Many of these verses are found in _Poems\r\nand Songs_, translated by Arthur Hubbell Palmer from the Norwegian\r\nin the original meters.[37] “Synnöve’s Song,” “The Day of Sunshine,”\r\nand “Ballad of Tailor Nils,” from _Arne_, are typical examples of his\r\nlyrics. Included in this anthology are patriotic poems. One of these,\r\nentitled “Song of Norway,” from _Synnöve Solbakken_ (1859) is one of\r\nthe most familiar of National Songs, beginning,\r\n\r\n    Yes, we love this land that towers\r\n        Where the ocean foams;\r\n    Rugged, stormswept, it embowers\r\n        Many thousand homes.\r\n\r\n    Love it, love it, of you thinking,\r\n        Father, mother dear,\r\n    And that night of saga sinking\r\n        Dreamful to us here.[38]\r\n\r\nThirty years later, for the silver wedding anniversary of Herman Anker\r\nand his wife, Björnson wrote another poem of patriotic and idealistic\r\nstrains, beginning,\r\n\r\n        Land That Shall Be!\r\n    Thither, when thwarted our longings, we sail,--\r\n    Sighs to the clouds, that we breathe when we fail,\r\n    Form a mirage of rich valley and mead\r\n        Over our need,--\r\n    Visions revealing the future until\r\n        Faith shall fulfill,--\r\n        The land that shall be![39]\r\n\r\nEver after a visit to Upsala University and a longer residence in\r\nCopenhagen, Björnson had cravings to write and to direct plays. In the\r\nlatter position he served for a time, 1857-1859, at Bergen. His first\r\nplays were of saga heroes and chieftains, like Halvard of _Between\r\nthe Battles_ and _Sigurd Slembe_ or _Sigurd the Bad_. They possess\r\nmilitant virtues and moral integrity but they are driven to misdeeds\r\nand despair by opposition to their good intentions. Thus Sigurd seeks\r\nto make peace with his half-brother, Harold Gille, but is betrayed\r\ninto revenge and murder. Mr. Brandes suggests that in these plays the\r\nspiritual sufferings of Björnson--who would elevate and harmonize the\r\nNorwegian people but finds himself misunderstood and rejected in his\r\nidealism--are revealed by analogy. He stresses the difference between\r\nBjörnson and Ibsen in this respect and others; the former seeks\r\ncomradeship and unity; the latter is “solitary by nature.” Björnson\r\nportrays all aspects of nature; Ibsen seldom uses such descriptions.\r\nWith fine distinctions between the two men, in nature and literature,\r\nMr. Brandes writes: “Henrik Ibsen is a judge, stern as one of the\r\njudges of Israel of old; Björnson is a prophet, the delightful herald\r\nof a better age. In the depths of his nature, Ibsen is a great\r\nrevolutionist.... Björnson’s is a conciliatory mind; he wages warfare\r\nwithout bitterness. His poetry sparkles with the sunshine of April,\r\nwhile that of Ibsen, with its deep earnestness, seems to lurk in dark\r\nshadows.” Ibsen loved the idea; Björnson loved humanity.[40]\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Quiller-Couch, in his study of Björnson, in _Adventures\r\nin Criticism_[41] divides his writings into three periods which he\r\ncalls “simplicity, confusion and dire confusion.” The first group of\r\ntales are those of idyllic type, already considered in _Arne_ and _A\r\nHappy Boy_; the second represent a transition towards the realistic\r\nand self-conscious, exampled in _The Fisher Maiden_ and _Magnhild_;\r\nthe third, showing more complications of thought and style, are like\r\n_The Heritage of the Kurts_ (originally entitled _Flags Are Flying_)\r\nand _In God’s Way_. The influence of German and French realists may be\r\ntraced in these later novels, especially the former with its portrayal\r\nof polygamous conditions. Other critics consider _Magnhild_ an advance\r\nin characterization over any previous fiction by Björnson, especially\r\nin the musician Tande and the relationship between him and Magnhild. If\r\nthe author intends to show that a woman may be happy in other ways than\r\nlove, he does not “get the message over” until it is interpreted by\r\nMr. Brandes or other critics. Rationalism mingles with idealism in the\r\nfirst scenes of _In God’s Way_.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, Björnson traveled on the continent, in England\r\nand to America for a visit in 1881. He sharpened his outlook upon life\r\nbut he never lost his “passion for truth,” his hatred of oppression\r\nin any form, his belief that individuals and nations might be joined\r\nby friendship rather than separated by antagonisms. He was deeply\r\nimpressed by certain forms of hypocrisy which he witnessed in Norway\r\nand he attacked such abuses in the problem plays, _The King_, _The\r\nEditor_, and _The Bankrupt_. Unlike the traditional patriot who says,\r\n“My country--right or wrong--but my country!” Björnson adopted as his\r\nslogan, “Norway must be right at all cost!” His plays, which revealed\r\ninnate evils, made him unpopular with politicians and brought about\r\nthreats of violence. He used to tell, with humor, of the visit of\r\nsome aggressive opponents among the young men who threw stones at his\r\nwindows but went away singing the refrain of his National Song,\r\n\r\n    Yes, we love this land that towers, etc.\r\n\r\nAs dramatist, Björnson attained a skill which is being recognized by\r\nstudents of to-day. _The Newly-married Couple_, which was, probably,\r\nthe first play to be written in original draft but held for later\r\npublication, has a psychological theme, well constructed--the\r\nadjustment necessary between the love of a maiden for her parents and\r\nthe new, strange love for her husband. The characters are vital and\r\nthe lines effective. Another early play, _Lame Hulda_ (_Halta Hulda_),\r\nwas more emotionally intense; the heroine, lame for twenty-four years,\r\nexperiences a brief, tragic passion for a man whose love is pledged\r\nelsewhere. There is lack of those elements of comedy that lighten\r\nthe lessons of _The Newly-married Couple_. To the earlier period of\r\nplay writing belongs, also, _Maria Stuart in Scotland_, a brilliant\r\nretelling of the familiar romance but lacking dramatic situations at\r\nthe close; Björnson was always at his best in Scandinavian background;\r\nnevertheless John Knox is a commanding personality in this play. In\r\nthis time of mental conflict between the ideal and the realities in\r\nlife as they affected his development, he wrote that vigorous novel,\r\n_The Fisher Maiden_, with vivid characterization, and one of his most\r\npictorial poems, _The Young Viking_.\r\n\r\nTruth is the demand of the dramatist, in every crisis in life, as\r\ndepicted in his problem plays, from _The Bankrupt_ to _A Gauntlet_.\r\nWith skill he shows The King, thwarted in his high ideals and his\r\nlove, trying to “serve the freedom of the spirit,” to be a true\r\n“citizen-king” but ending his life in despair because of the deceit\r\nof others. _The Bankrupt_ has a strong character in Berent, the\r\nlawyer; the “problem” centers about the merchant’s temptation to use\r\nthe money of others. _The Editor_ aroused much controversy, because\r\nit was claimed that Björnson had here satirized a Swedish editor but\r\nthe charge was unfounded; rather the editor and his victims, Halvadan\r\nand Harald, typify journalistic conditions in every land. Mr. Brandes\r\nsuggests that the dramatist may have been modeling these two brothers\r\nfrom the older poet, Wergeland and himself, in their struggles to\r\ncreate love for truth and freedom. In _Leonarda_, with lyrical as well\r\nas dramatic qualities, Björnson spoke a message of more tolerance and\r\nhistorical significance through three generations of Norwegian society.\r\nTwo excellent translators of his plays have been Edwin Björkman and R.\r\nFarquharson Sharp (_see_ bibliography).\r\n\r\nBy translation and inclusion in selected plays of merit from many\r\nlanguages, _Beyond Human Control_ has become one of the most familiar\r\nof Björnson’s social dramas. It is one of the chosen plays in _Chief\r\nContemporary Dramatists_, Series I, by Thomas H. Dickinson. There\r\nare two parts to this drama, with differing _motifs_--the first in\r\nchronology and most widely read and staged is _Beyond Human Power_\r\n(or _Beyond Our Power: Over Ævne_ I, 1883) dealing with problems of\r\nreligious faith and fanaticism; the second part (_Over Ævne_ II,\r\n1895) treats of differences of opinion between labor and capital. The\r\nfirst part, a complete play, has been given throughout Europe and\r\nwas performed in New York in 1902, with Mrs. Patrick Campbell in the\r\nleading rôle. The characters are strongly balanced in interest; the\r\nwife of the self-sacrificing, impractical pastor, Clara Sang, is a\r\nmasterly delineation of wifely loyalty and maternal responsibility.\r\nThe Bishop is well drawn in antithesis to Pastor Sang. _A Gauntlet_\r\ncreated discussion in Norway because of its daring theme--the advocacy\r\nof the same standards of social purity for men and women. It is less\r\neffective dramatically but morally it is vigorous.\r\n\r\nBjörnson’s later work in drama includes such good reading-plays as\r\n_Laboremus_, _Daglannet_, and _When the New Wine Blooms_.[42] As\r\nexamples of literary work after the age of seventy, to which may\r\nbe added the story, _Mary_,[43] with emotional power, they stand\r\nas testimonials to the vigor, mental and spiritual, of this worthy\r\n“Viking” of our day. After he received the Nobel prize, in accord with\r\nthe proviso of the Code of Statutes, he made a noteworthy address upon\r\nthe theme, “Poetry As a Manifestation of the Sense of Vital Surplus.”\r\nHis own vitality and zest in life never lapsed. He declared that the\r\npossession of a new pair of trousers in his old age gave him a sense\r\nof delight like that of a child and he would get up an hour earlier\r\n“to get full enjoyment of these clothes.” Edwin Björkman, one of the\r\nmost intuitive of his many translators, tells, in his _Voices of\r\nTomorrow_[44] incidents in the later life of Björnson that verify his\r\nchildlike nature, combined with serious, passionate efforts for human\r\nbetterment. His wife, an actress by training, was his amanuensis and\r\ncritic; between husband and wife existed a rare bond of sympathy: at\r\nformal dinners, and on social occasions of varied kinds, Björnson\r\ninsisted that his wife should sit at his right hand, in spite of other\r\nconventions.

As in the case of Mistral, the choice had\r\nfallen upon a poet of patriotic influence, although the Italian was\r\nfar more independent in spirit, with less sentimental devotion to his\r\ncountry. At different periods he had been a critic of both the Liberal\r\nand the Monarchial parties; sometimes he had seemed to be vacillating\r\nin his political convictions but he had always been an ardent patriot\r\nfor Italy of the past, with hopes for a future of greater freedom and\r\nworld influence.\r\n\r\nCarducci was born at Val di Castello, July 27, 1835. His father, of a\r\nFlorentine family, was a country doctor who had been imprisoned for\r\npolitical activities before the son was born. When Giosuè was three\r\nyears old, the family moved to Bolgheri, in Tuscan Maremma; here the\r\nboy roamed about the hills and valleys for eleven years; he recalled\r\nsome of his childhood memories in “Crossing the Tuscan Maremma.” He was\r\neducated, in the first place, at home; his father taught him Latin and\r\nhis mother read to him from the poems of Alfieri. After the turbulent\r\nconditions of 1848 the family moved to Florence and he was sent to the\r\nScuole Pie; at eighteen, he was writing _Sapphics and Alcaics_, in\r\nwhich he urged a return to classic meters and early ideals of Italy.\r\nHis vein of satire was shown in mild attacks upon the church and\r\nits restrictions upon progress. Schiller, Byron, and Scott were his\r\nfavorite authors during a part of this formative period.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 he was nominated as Professor of Rhetoric at the Gymnasium\r\nof San Miniato al Tedesco but he became involved in political and\r\nliterary controversies. He was refused government sanction to teach in\r\na position offered at Arezzo, so he returned to Florence. He was poor\r\nand lived in extreme self-denial, frequenting libraries, storing his\r\nmind with Greek and Latin literature and finding some employment with\r\nthe publisher, Barbèra, for whom he wrote prefaces, notes, etc., for\r\nItalian classics. Two griefs came within a year--the suicide of his\r\nbrother, Dante, and the death of his father. In memory of his brother\r\nhe wrote the lines “Alla memoria di D. C.” Happier days came when he\r\nmarried the gifted daughter of his relative and friend, Menicucci. His\r\nhome life was stimulating and sympathetic. He had four children; to a\r\ndaughter he gave the symbolic name of “Liberty.” Again death came to\r\ncrush his spirit; his little boy, Dante, three years old, died the same\r\nyear as Carducci’s mother. The latter, of fine Florentine family, had\r\nbeen a loved comrade to her son; and although he was reconciled to her\r\ndeath in old age, he rebelled, in deep grief, at the loss of the little\r\nboy, declaring “three parts of his life” had departed. The elegiac\r\nstanzas, “Funere mersit acerbo,”[46] written in a mood of longing for\r\nthe child, are pathetic.\r\n\r\nHis poems, as collected previous to 1870, showed political agitation\r\nand frequent bitterness and satire; many of these had appeared in the\r\nperiodical, _Il Poloziano_. In 1860 he went to Pistoia as Professor of\r\nGreek and Latin; there he wrote his poem, “Sicilia e la rivoluzione,”\r\ncelebrating Garibaldi’s Sicilian Expedition of that time. During the\r\nnext ten years he passed through political changes of allegiance;\r\nwhen his _Hymn to Satan_[47] appeared, and “made him famous in a day,”\r\n(republished in 1869 over signature of “Enotrio Romano”) extolling the\r\nadvance of Liberalism over the reactionary influences of both monarchy\r\nand church, he was declared to be an unqualified Republican. It was\r\na daring _motif_ that the poet chose for his voice of “Revolt”; it\r\nrequired courage, at that time, to summon as witnesses to the progress\r\nof the “lord of the feast, Satan,” such names as Savonarola and Luther,\r\nHuss and Wycliffe. One reason for the immediate popularity of this poem\r\nmay have been the flowing, almost lilting, form of four-line stanzas.\r\n\r\nSeven years before the publication of _Hymn to Satan_, Carducci had\r\nbecome identified, as professor, with the University of Bologna; here\r\nhe remained until his death--a period of forty-six years of educational\r\nservice. The first offer from Mamiani, as Minister of Education, was\r\nto the Turin Lycée but the poet was unwilling to leave Tuscany. After\r\na little delay the chair of elocution--and later of literature--was\r\nopen to him at Bologna. His influence upon students of all types was\r\nstimulating, always conducive to individual expression and ambition.\r\nAfter the appearance of _Hymn to Satan_ he was in marked disfavor with\r\nthe government. His liberal ideas were in high favor with the students,\r\nhowever, so that it seemed wise to “make a change” by offering him\r\na position to teach Latin at Naples. Carducci refused on the ground\r\nthat he was not qualified to teach Latin. He was prohibited from\r\ncontinuing classroom instruction at Bologna, on the ground of “constant\r\nopposition to the acts of the Government.” Affairs were quieted by a\r\nchange of ministers and the poet, wisely, refrained from promulgating\r\npolitical doctrines in the University, or from giving dominance to\r\nthem in his later volumes of poems, like _Levia grandia_, in 1867,\r\nand _Nuove poesie_, in 1873. Mr. Bickersteth has emphasized duly the\r\nmore restrained, tender note in the later volume, following soon after\r\nthe loss of his mother and his son. So different were the lyrics from\r\nhis previous type, so surely did they show the influence of Goethe,\r\nSchiller, and Heine, in romanticism, that some critics accused Carducci\r\nof being a mere imitator, or even a plagiarist. This challenge aroused\r\nhis ever-present spirit and he wrote the prose defense, with broad as\r\nwell as personal comment, _Critica ed arte_.\r\n\r\nAs lecturer, he became yearly more popular and students from distant\r\nplaces hastened to come under his inspiration. He was one of the\r\nnoteworthy exponents of Dante. When Rome established a chair of Dante\r\nExigesis, Carducci was appointed as professor. Although sorry to lose\r\nhim at Bologna, the whole country applauded the honor. He hesitated,\r\nbecause he was not in accord with those who interpreted Dante by\r\ncontemporary political conditions, those who had founded the chair at\r\nRome. Later he became one of “four leading Dante scholars” who gave\r\nshort courses of lectures each year. At his first lecture there was\r\nan effort to make a political demonstration by the anti-Papal party.\r\nAmong his sentences at this first discourse he said, “Papacy and\r\nEmpire, their discord and their power, were passing away when Dante was\r\nborn--Dante who does not pass away.” In an earlier sonnet, published in\r\nessays in 1874, he had interpreted what he believed were Dante’s views\r\nand the reason for his immortal fame:[48]\r\n\r\n    Dante, whence comes it that my vows and voice,\r\n    Adoring thy proud lineaments I raise;\r\n    That, o’er thy verse, which made thee lean and wan,\r\n    The sun may set, the new dawn finds me still?\r\n\r\n    I hate thy Holy Empire; with my sword\r\n    I should have thrust the crown from off the head\r\n    Of thy good Frederick in Olona’s vale.\r\n    O’er church and Empire, both now ruins sad,\r\n    Thy song soars up, and high in heaven resounds--\r\n    Though Jove may die, the poet’s hymn remains.\r\n\r\nWith one of those marked changes in his impulses and convictions which\r\never characterized Carducci, he broke away from tendencies towards\r\nGerman Romanticism and declared a “literary revolution” as his purpose\r\nin writing his most familiar odes, _Odi barbare_, 1873-1877. Back to\r\nthe poetry of Greece and Rome he would lead the people, away from the\r\nromanticists and “sickly sentimentalism.” To his friends, Chiarini\r\nand Targioni, who were critics of these odes, he declared that the\r\nworld’s greatest poets had been Homer, Pindar, Theocritus, Sophocles,\r\nand Aristophanes.[49] There was a great variety of meter in this\r\ncollection; several poems that lacked rhymes seemed, to the hackneyed\r\ncritics, unconventional in form. Mr. Bickersteth has informing comments\r\nupon Carducci’s _Metres in the Barbarian Odes_ and other poems, in his\r\nIntroduction to his _Selection of Poems_, already cited. Among the\r\nexamples of the Italian poet at his best, his most simple, flexible,\r\nand musical lines, one recalls from this collection such verses as\r\n“The Ideal,” “The Mother,” and “By the Urn of Percy Bysshe Shelley.”\r\nAddressing one of his imaginary Greek women, Lalage, he unfolds his\r\nown deep, loving appreciation of the English poet in such couplets as\r\nthese:[50]\r\n\r\n    Vain are the joys of the present, they come and they fade like a\r\n      blossom,\r\n    Only in death dwells the truth and loveliness but in past days.\r\n\r\n    Lo, on the mount of the centuries Clio hath nimbly descended,\r\n    And bursts into song as she spreads her magnificent wings to the\r\n      sky.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    O heart of hearts, o’er this urn, thy cold, uncongenial prison,\r\n    The warm spring blossoms again with the fragrance of flower and\r\n      fruit.\r\n\r\n    O heart of hearts, thy divine great father, the Sun, hath arisen,\r\n    And lovingly bathes thee in light, poor heart that forever art mute.\r\n\r\nThis poem, inspired by the grave of Shelley, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful and appealing of the odes; to him the English poet was, in\r\ntruth, “Poet of liberty,” with a “spirit Titanic.” In spite of the\r\nsimplicity and directness of Carducci’s diction his poems have defied\r\nmany translators, especially in English. It is interesting to note that\r\ntwo of his German translators have been winners of the Nobel prize in\r\nliterature, Paul Heyse and Theodor Mommsen.\r\n\r\nIn this same volume, _Odi barbare_, was a poem which attracted wide\r\nattention in Italy and aroused some indignation among the former\r\nfriends of Carducci who had Republican principles. It was the tribute\r\nentitled “To the Queen,” dated November 20, 1878. While it was\r\nessentially an effusion to the grace, beauty, and literary gifts of\r\nQueen Marguerite as an individual, it resounded with the Hail! (“Long\r\nLive!”) which has come down from Hebrew days for king and queen.\r\nAlthough a Liberal to the end of his life, Carducci relinquished his\r\nantagonism to monarchy as he grew older and gentler in spirit. The\r\ninfluence of his friend in political life, Crispi, caused a reaction\r\nin Carducci from alliance with Republicanism, which veered towards\r\nSocialism, and an alignment again with the monarchical party. The final\r\npledge of this political change was chronicled in the tribute to King\r\nAlbert Charles in the poem, “Piedmonte,” in 1890. In the same year the\r\npoet was elected as senator and served for a brief time. To him Liberty\r\nnow became an ideal for art, literature and religion, as well as for\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAlthough the more serious interpreters of Carducci’s political\r\nfluctuations trace the gradual, and reasonable, steps from hatred\r\nof monarchy to acceptance and even poetic homage, there are other\r\ncommentators who give a romantic flavor to the change of attitude. They\r\ndeclare that the new allegiance may be explained by a visit that the\r\nKing and Queen made to Bologna. Carducci was lame and disinclined to\r\nmeet people socially; he was immersed in his books and a few friends,\r\noutside his University classes. The story runs that Queen Marguerite,\r\nwho was a literary critic and sponsor of the arts, invited the poet\r\nto an audience. Such an invitation is a summons but Carducci went\r\nunwillingly. He came away, however, from the visit inspired by the\r\nQueen’s appreciative sympathy and her literary insight. Thenceforward\r\nshe was to him “Eterno femminino Regale.” Letters passed between the\r\nQueen and the poet. Their friendship has been compared to that of\r\nMichelangelo and Vittoria Colonna, in inspirational quality.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed the Queen was able to serve both the poet and\r\nher country, for Carducci’s health and finances became impaired. In\r\n1899 he suffered a stroke of paralysis which crippled him somewhat\r\nbut he continued his work at the University, assisted by his favorite\r\npupil, the poet Severino Ferrari. That he might not be obliged to sell\r\nhis valuable library the Queen purchased this, with the arrangement\r\nthat he might use it during his life. After his death she purchased\r\nhis home, also, and gave this to the Italian people as a memorial,\r\n“Casa Carducci,” with a beautiful garden, adorned with statuary that\r\nsymbolizes some of his poems. In 1904 the government gave him a pension\r\nand the University students honored him with a celebration. The next\r\nyear the sudden death of his assistant, Ferrari, was a terrible loss to\r\nhim and left him enfeebled in body and spirit. When the Nobel prize was\r\nawarded the next year, he was unable to leave his chair to receive it;\r\nthe King of Sweden sent a deputy to Bologna to give the testimonial in\r\nperson to the aged poet. He lived only two months after this honor; his\r\nfuneral at Bologna was attended by thousands. Because of his Florentine\r\ndescent and his literary rank, the city of Florence offered for him a\r\ntomb in Sta. Croce, the Italian Pantheon, but his family preferred a\r\nburial place just outside Bologna.\r\n\r\nAs a poet Carducci mingled vigor and grace to an unusual degree. He was\r\nan artist both in his conceptions and his forms; he never left a poem\r\nunfinished. His historical odes, resultant from his classical studies,\r\nare less impressive than such lyrics as “Night,” “Fiesole,” “Idyll of\r\nthe Maremma,” “Before San Guido,” “Virgil,” and “Primo Vere” which\r\nare found in translations by Mrs. Maud Holland.[51] A wistful sadness\r\nis found in many of his poems of nature and life, a sensitiveness to\r\ninsincerity, a change from a mood of hopefulness to that of longing and\r\nquestion. Such poetic traits are marked in the poem, “Primo Vere,” a\r\ndelicate spring-song with gentle sadness;\r\n\r\n    Behold! from sluggish winter’s arms\r\n    Spring lifts herself again;\r\n    Naked before the steel-cold air\r\n    She shivers, as in pain,\r\n    Look, Lalage, is that a tear\r\n    In the sun’s eye that shines so clear?\r\n    Today my spirit sleeps and dreams,\r\n    Where do my far thoughts fly?\r\n    Close to thy beauty’s face we stand\r\n    And smile, the spring and I:\r\n    Yet, Lalage, whence come those tears?\r\n    Has Spring, too, felt the doom of years?[52]\r\n\r\nIn his old age Carducci declared that “his guiding principles had\r\nbeen three--in politics, Italy before all things; in art, classical\r\npoetry before all things; in life, sincerity and strength before all\r\nthings.”[53] As he mellowed in his political opinions, so he became\r\nless vehement against the church and Christianity in later writings.\r\nIn truth, it was not Christianity but asceticism and bigotry which he\r\ncombated. Like many poets he regretted the loss of some of the best\r\nmarks of pure paganism; he found in it truth and freedom, in contrast\r\nwith many evidences of falsehood and slavery in the Christian world\r\nof his day. He did not always get a vision of life as a whole, only\r\na segment which was sometimes distorted in perspective. He was more\r\ninterested in historical and poetic figures than in creative types.\r\nItaly of the past and her classic literature were his ideals in his\r\nlater writings. Rejecting romanticism as exotic, he pleaded for “the\r\nrepresentation of reality with truth.” In summary of his aim and its\r\nfulfillment, Mr. Bickersteth has written with lucidity: “Carducci’s\r\nconception of reality, considered from the artistic point of view,\r\ncontrols his treatment of all the chief themes of his poetry, as will\r\nat once become apparent if we examine any of these at all closely. Man,\r\nNature, Liberty, for instance--he held it incumbent upon the poets\r\nof his own time to deal mainly with these three, and they constitute\r\naccordingly a large portion of the subject-matter of his own verse.”\r\nIt is difficult to identify the word idealism with much of Carducci’s\r\npoetry about women--for he was strongly realistic in his love poems, in\r\ngeneral, often compared to Walt Whitman in his emphasis of the physical\r\nattractiveness of woman. Again, he too often failed in his efforts\r\nto adapt old Latin forms to modern themes and reflections. In spite\r\nof such defects, however, Carducci’s poetry at his best, his earnest\r\npatriotism and his hopes for Italy, reflects his country, says Mr.\r\nBickersteth, “in her purest and serenest aspect, and her ideals linked\r\non to many, if not all, the most cherished traditions of her past.”[54]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1907.\r\n\r\n[46] Found in original and translation in _Carducci: a Selection of His\r\nPoems_, etc. by G.

Names of\r\nBritish authors had been sent to the Committee of the Nobel Foundation\r\nand the Swedish Academy, with ardent commendation by individuals and\r\nacademic circles. Prominent among such names, suggested in the press,\r\nhad been Swinburne, George Meredith, John Morley, Thomas Hardy, Barrie,\r\nand Robert Bridges. One journal asked, “Why not Kipling?” The answer\r\ncame in the announcement that the award for 1907 was given to Rudyard\r\nKipling, poet and story-teller. Again the issue, “What is Idealism?”\r\nwas raised and challenged by some opponents of this choice yet, on the\r\nwhole, it met with wide favor. Kipling’s type of robust idealism was\r\ndefended; said W. B. Parker, “His idealism needs no other evidence than\r\nthe enthusiastic following he has had from boys.”[56]\r\n\r\nCombined with this _robust idealism_ are two other qualities of\r\nKipling as writer, that have given him “the enthusiastic following of\r\nboys”--his virility and courage. For adolescents and college youths\r\nhe has upheld the ideals of vigorous action, of honor and bravery, of\r\ndaring in speech and deed. In his dynamic poems and tales of _The Day’s\r\nWork_, _Kim_, _Life’s Handicap_, and the other volumes so familiar,\r\nhe reflects his “gospel” of fearlessness, that does not hesitate\r\nto shock some who abide by the conventional standards of speech.\r\nGilbert K. Chesterton has said forceful truths about this trait of\r\nKipling in _Heretics_: he affirms that credit is due to Kipling for\r\nhis appreciation of _slang_ and _steam_. He expands the thought thus:\r\n“Steam may be, if you like, a dirty by-product of science. Slang may\r\nbe, if you like, a dirty by-product of language. But at least he has\r\nbeen among the few who saw the living parentage of these things and\r\nknew that where there is smoke, there is fire--that is, wherever\r\nthere is the foulest of things there, also, is the purest.”[57] Mr.\r\nChesterton declares that Kipling’s type of courage is not that of\r\nwar, nor valor of the battle-field, but “that interdependence and\r\nefficiency which belongs quite as much to engineers, or sailors, or\r\nmules, or railway engineers.” Recurrent in memory are such tales as\r\n“The Bridge-Builders,” “The Ship That Found Herself,” “.007,” “With the\r\nNight Mail” and “Wireless.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of Doubleday, Page & Co._\r\n  _Photograph by E. O. Hoppe_\r\n\r\nRUDYARD KIPLING]\r\n\r\nOne trait sharply differentiates Kipling from some of his colleagues\r\namong the Nobel prize winners. He is a patriot-poet but with less\r\nardent tribute than is found in the verse of Mistral and Björnson\r\nand Heidenstam. Perhaps his open criticism of his country in certain\r\npolitical crises has barred him from the laureateship. His frank,\r\ndemocratic attitude in later years, somewhat in contrast with earlier\r\nutterances of imperialism, finds expression in every stanza of “A\r\nPilgrim’s Way.” Few poets, however, have written such magnetic lines in\r\nurgence of “fitness,” honor and service for country as has Kipling, in\r\nthe familiar words of “If,” “For All We Have and Are,” “The Children’s\r\nSong,” and the refrain in the poem in _Land and Sea Tales for Scouts\r\nand Scoutmasters_--\r\n\r\n    Be fit--be fit--for honour’s sake be fit!\r\n\r\nHe is patriotic with the world knowledge of a traveled man; two\r\nexamples in proof are found in “The Return” and “The English Flag,”\r\nwith the pertinent query--\r\n\r\n    And what should they know of England who only England know?\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has been a “fad” in certain journals to depreciate\r\nKipling and to charge against him faults of narrowness in outlook and\r\nlack of modernism. Especially during the years of the war and its\r\nimmediate aftermath one found tones of sad, somewhat cynical writing.\r\nIn large measure this was due to the personal trials of the time and\r\nthe loss of his son. That elegiac poem, “My Boy Jack; 1914-1918,” will\r\nlive as a heart-gripping memorial. In his speech at the Sorbonne,\r\nNovember 19, 1921, he gave evidences of spiritual recovery; he said,\r\n“One cannot resume a broken world as easily as one can resume a broken\r\nsentence. But before long our sons who have spent themselves in\r\nsuffering and toiling to abolish the menace of barbarism will recover\r\nalso from the menace of moral lassitude.” With old-time sprightliness\r\nand vigor he wrote, in the spring of 1924, the stanzas “A Song of the\r\nFrench Roads,” after a visit to France and the joyful experience of\r\nfinding the roads to the border, that had been laid out by Napoleon\r\nand devastated by the war, were now repaired and open to traffic.[58]\r\n\r\nIt was the Kipling of the earlier years of writing who received the\r\nNobel prize. He was forty-two years old, one of the youngest winners.\r\nHe had already published volumes of prose and verse that would be\r\ncreditable to a writer of twice his age. Born at Bombay, December 30,\r\n1865, he inherited intellectual promise from both parents. His father,\r\nJohn Lockwood Kipling, an artist, was at that time Director of the\r\nLahore School of Industrial Art. He was a delightful story-teller and\r\nexpertly trained in technical and artistic knowledge. He illustrated\r\nsome of his son’s earlier tales; a book by him, entitled _Beast and Man\r\nin India_, with unusual drawings, was attributed to Rudyard Kipling\r\n(London, 1891). Alice MacDonald, the mother, gave to her son a keen\r\nzest in life and a rare sense of humor. Her devotion has had many lines\r\nof commemoration, notably in such a poem as “Mother O’ Mine.”\r\n\r\nThe boy was named Joseph Rudyard but he seldom used the first name.\r\nThe second, in memory of a lake in England where his father and mother\r\nhad met, is so arresting and unique that it has been called one of the\r\ncauses of his first appeal to the curious public. After his early\r\nboyhood in India, leaving with him strong impressions and love for\r\nthe land, he was sent to Southsea, Devonshire, to school and later to\r\nthe United Services College at Westward Ho. He was homesick for his\r\nmother and found it difficult to mix well with the English-born boys.\r\n_Stalky & Co._ is largely autobiographical of this period. In 1880 he\r\nreturned to India, anxious to enter journalism and know the native\r\npeople, especially in the army. The story runs that once, when Kipling\r\nwas doing journalistic work in Lahore, the Duke of Connaught visited\r\nthe place and asked the young man what he would prefer to do in India.\r\nThe reply came promptly, “I would like, sir, to live with the army for\r\na time, and go to the frontier to write up Tommy Atkins.” The request\r\nwas granted and the literary results in later years are listed in\r\n_Department Ditties_, _Soldiers Three_, _Under the Deodars_, and many\r\nmore stories in volumes, from _Plain Tales from the Hills_ to _Eyes of\r\nAsia_.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has been rife about the truth or exaggeration of\r\nKipling’s pictures of India, especially types of army men and\r\nofficers’ wives. Many critics, who have traveled in India, affirm\r\nthe photographic quality of the tales and verse but some raise the\r\nissue of the tone--is it sincere or sardonic? Others, who claim to\r\nhave talked with certain “natives,” condemn both the spirit and the\r\ncharacterizations. To the charge of insincerity or disloyalty there\r\nseems to be a firm answer in the friendly Prelude to _Departmental\r\nDitties_, which has a prominent place in the Inclusive Edition of\r\n_Rudyard Kipling’s Verse_. He lays stress, in the last stanza, upon\r\n“the jesting guise” but he emphasizes, also, his loyalty to these\r\npeople, especially in the second stanza:\r\n\r\n    Was there aught that I did not share\r\n      In vigil or toil or ease,--\r\n    One joy or woe that I did not know,\r\n      Dear hearts across the seas?[59]\r\n\r\nDuring these years from 1882 to 1889, while he was doing journalistic\r\nwork and associating with civil and military representatives in Lahore,\r\nBombay, and Mandalay, he was writing stories and verses which appeared\r\nin the newspaper columns of India. The first issue in book form was by\r\nA. H. Wheeler & Co. of Allahabad, a little book in gray paper covers\r\nwhich was sold at railway stations. In his own hand and with striking\r\nillustrations, Kipling edited some of his early tales; one such, “Wee\r\nWillie Winkie,” dedicated to his mother, with others that formed “an\r\nillustrated set,” found a purchaser in J. Pierpont Morgan, in recent\r\nyears at a price stated to be $17,000.[60]\r\n\r\nWhen Kipling was twenty-five years old, with his memory packed with\r\nscenes of adventure and characters in India, and his pockets filled\r\nwith unpublished tales and verse, he decided to try his literary fate\r\nin England. He traveled by way of the Pacific to California and reached\r\nNew York with hopes of editorial encouragement because he had letters\r\nof introduction. He was not received with cordiality; perhaps in later\r\nyears some of these editors and publishers regretted their lost chance\r\nto launch a new genius. In London, he attracted attention slowly but,\r\nwith influence from family and officials, he won recognition by critics\r\nand reading-public. One of the first to appreciate Kipling’s unique\r\nwork was Andrew Lang; later he was severe in criticism of certain\r\nfaults. One of his essays upon Kipling of the earlier _Tales_ is\r\nincluded in _Essays in Little_ (Scribner’s, 1891). It has a prophetic\r\nnote, an emphasis of “the brilliance of colour,” the strange, varied\r\nthemes, the “perfume of the East.”\r\n\r\nThe Nobel prize was given to Kipling because of these qualities of\r\nhis earlier work, as well as his more mature, potent messages. He\r\nhad, from the first, rare ability to revivify, to secure for future\r\ngenerations of readers the real and the romantic in Anglo-India of the\r\nlater nineteenth century. He preserved the landscapes, the customs, the\r\nideals, the intrigues, the foibles, even the slang of the natives and\r\nthe British soldiers. Just as Mistral saved the language and romances\r\nof Provence from oblivion, in his _Mireio_ and other poems; just as\r\nBjörnson recorded the almost forgotten sagas of Norway and blended\r\nthese with modern, peasant life; so Kipling made literary use of this\r\nunfamiliar material of India. His idealism converted the ordinary,\r\noften petty and rough aspects of life, into stories and verses of\r\nundying flavor, like “The Phantom Rickshaw,” _Soldiers Three_, “Drums\r\nof the Fore and Aft,” “On the City Wall,” “M’Andrew’s Hymn,” “Danny\r\nDeever,” “Mandalay,” and “The Lover’s Litany.” Here are recorded days\r\nof adventure and danger, nights of memory and longing. In 1902, more\r\nthan ten years after he left India, he wrote one of his most appealing\r\npoems, “The Broken Men,” the exiles from England with their pluck and\r\ntheir pathos, which grips the sympathies like those tales of O. Henry\r\nabout the American self-imposed “exiles” in Central America.\r\n\r\nThe later visit that Kipling made to the United States cheered his\r\nheart, in contrast to the earlier reception. He had met Caroline\r\nBalestier, sister of Wolcott Balestier, a young man with whom Kipling\r\nbecame intimate in London and with whom he collaborated in the novel,\r\n_The Naulahka_. Their home was in Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1892 Miss\r\nBalestier was married to Kipling in All Soul’s Church, Portland Place,\r\nLondon. They came to Vermont to live for a few years in the unique\r\nhouse, which Kipling built for his bride overlooking Brattleboro. Sir\r\nArthur Conan Doyle accredits him with “chivalrous devotion” to his\r\nwife, which caused him to come to America lest she might miss her\r\nhome and friends.[61] Before coming to America they took a journey\r\n“round the world,” or a segment of it. The death of Wolcott Balestier\r\nwas a deep grief to his friend and a loss to American literature. In\r\ndedicatory elegy (_Barrack-Room Ballads_) Kipling wrote the lines of\r\nnoble characterization:\r\n\r\n    E’en as he trod that day to God so walked he from his birth,\r\n    In simpleness and gentleness and honour and clean mirth.[62]\r\n\r\nFor the little daughter, who died at an early age, Kipling wrote his\r\nfirst _Jungle Book_. In this American home he wrote, also, many of\r\nthe poems collected in _The Seven Seas_ and the short stories, _Many\r\nInventions_. In the latter book were the daring pictures of life like\r\n“The Disturber of Traffic,” the haunting tale of “The Lost Legion,”\r\nand the tragic “Love o’ Women.” The inspiration of Mrs. Kipling, her\r\nperfect appreciation of her husband’s gifts and moods, and her gracious\r\ninfluence have been attested by him in many tender words, as well as\r\nin the more impersonal tributes to womanhood of brains and heart, which\r\none finds expressed in _From Sea to Sea_ or “His Chance in Life.” The\r\nworld will never forget the persistent story that Mrs. Kipling saved,\r\nfrom the wastebasket, that grand hymn of all time, “The Recessional.”\r\nIn some of his tales he antagonized Americans, notably in _The Light\r\nThat Failed_ and “An Habitation Enforced” in _Actions and Reactions_;\r\nas compensation one recalls “An Error of the Fourth Dimension” from\r\n_Plain Tales_, the story of Wilton Sargent, American.\r\n\r\nThe writing of Kipling showed advance in form during the decade from\r\n1890 to 1900. There was gradual elimination of the jingoism and\r\ncynicism which tainted some of his earlier work. In 1897 he visited\r\nSouth Africa again. He recounted an actual experience in riding on\r\na Cape Government Railway in his tale “.007,” among the stories in\r\n_The Day’s Work_, published in 1898. In this same collection is found\r\n“The Brushwood Boy,” a masterpiece of mystic idealism which will\r\nstand beside his more poetic allegory, “They.” The year 1899 has been\r\nregarded sometimes as a crisis in the life of Kipling which affected\r\nhis later writing. On his arrival in New York, in the late autumn\r\nof that year, he was attacked by a severe case of pneumonia and was\r\ndesperately ill for many weeks. The press of America, England, and\r\nthe Continent awaited the bulletins with anxiety. He recovered but\r\nsome critics have affirmed that he lost his vigor and literary power.\r\nLooking over the dates of his poems, and recalling the books which have\r\nappeared since this crisis, such a surmise is not warranted. One could\r\nscarcely expect that any author could continue to write, on a level\r\nor ascending scale, many more books about India than he had already\r\nwritten or many more poems of vital spell like “If,” “When Earth’s Last\r\nPicture is Painted,” and “M’Andrew’s Hymn.”\r\n\r\nHe had already proved his ability to write for children and\r\nadolescents. Few books among juveniles surpass, in visualization and\r\nimaginative skill, _The Jungle Books_, _Just So Stories_, and that\r\npioneer sea tale that has gained favor with the years, _Captains\r\nCourageous_. In the years that followed his serious illness, he wrote\r\ntales of clever inventiveness collected in _Puck of Pook’s Hill_,\r\n_Rewards and Fairies_, and _Kim_. To this period belong, also, many\r\nof the poems collected in the volume, _The Five Nations_. Who will\r\nsay that there was decadence of literary power, any lapse of dramatic\r\nskill, in that story of _Kim_, or Kimball O’Hara, the orphan boy of\r\nLahore? The boys of to-day--and normal girls--have wholesome “thrills”\r\nat this lad’s story, his pilgrimages over India with the Tibetan\r\nlama, and his final adoption by the regiment to which his father had\r\nbelonged. Humor, adventure, vivid photographs of places and people--all\r\nare mingled in this tale. When it appeared in the London edition\r\nof 1901, the father of Kipling contributed some of the striking\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n_The Five Nations_ of this later period gave permanence in form to such\r\nvital poems as “White Horses,” “Our Lady of the Snows” (the beautiful\r\node to Canada), “The Dykes,” “The Feet of the Young Men,” “Boots,”\r\n“The Explorer,” and “The Recessional.” “Buddha at Kamakura,” which\r\nfirst appeared in _Kim_, should be listed in this collection. Are there\r\nhere traces of lapse in form or spontaneity compared with the earlier,\r\nless restrained verses in _Departmental Ditties_ or _Barrack-Room\r\nBallads_? In _Traffics and Discoveries_, published in 1904, are found\r\nsuch literary achievements as “Wireless,” “They,” and “The Army of a\r\nDream.” Kipling had shown his keen observation, humor, and appreciation\r\nof varied beauties of Nature in his volumes of travel-sketches and\r\nletters, _From Sea to Sea_ and _Letters of Travel_. “In Sight of\r\nMonadnock” contains a brief, fine description of that distant New\r\nHampshire peak. With his long experience in travel and adjustment to\r\ndiverse conditions of life, Kipling has ever been a poet of home,\r\nnational and domestic. His poem, “Sussex,” written in 1902, has deep\r\nfeeling as well as notable lines of description and a rhythmic swing.\r\n\r\nNew poets and story-writers came into prominence with the twentieth\r\ncentury. Although Kipling was in his full maturity and vigor when the\r\nNobel prize was awarded, with years of promising, creative work before\r\nhim, he had been so long before the public that it became the fashion,\r\nin some brilliant, cynical groups, to speak of him as belonging to the\r\nolder generation. His volumes attracted less attention in competition\r\nwith those of mere “modernism.” The announcement of the Nobel prize,\r\nin 1907, aroused interest anew in every country. In looking over the\r\nKipling bibliographical cards, in the Widener Library at Harvard\r\nUniversity, it is interesting to find records of translations of his\r\nbooks into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish,\r\nRussian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish. The journals took occasion to\r\nreview what he had accomplished in literature before 1907, to commend\r\nor reprove the decision of the Swedish Academy in giving him a prize\r\nfor “idealistic” literature. Some cited his imperialistic “complex”\r\nand quoted “The Man Who Would Be King.” In _Current Literature_ for\r\nOctober, 1908, are quotations from diverse opinions: Said the _London\r\nNation_: “There is hardly any English writer more closely identified\r\nwith the doctrine of force or a firmer believer that the Deity is\r\nto be found on the side of the big battalions.” The _New York World_\r\ndeclared, “He sings of blood-lust, with a schoolboy’s disregard of\r\nconsequences.” The _Chicago Post_ believed that his idealism was “the\r\nidealization of might” but it praised his strong, Biblical English.\r\n\r\nComments of this kind fail to recognize the _two_, paradoxical traits\r\nin Kipling’s nature and writings. There is stark realism, sometimes\r\nrelentless, as in “The Courtship of Dinah Shadd,” “The Gate of a\r\nHundred Sorrows,” “My Son’s Wife,” or poems like “The Galley-Slave,”\r\n“Danny Deever,” and “Kitchener’s School.” Close beside this realism,\r\npenetrating and often sordid, sounds a note of idealism, a promise\r\nof “a happy issue out of all troubles,” a vision that comes to an\r\nidealist. Recall that in _The Day’s Work_, there is the tense,\r\nrealistic tale of “The Devil and the Deep Sea,” and, within a few\r\npages, the idyll of “The Brushwood Boy.”\r\n\r\nSince the Nobel prize was received, Kipling has written with less\r\nfrequency and more unevenness of form. Some of the prose and verse\r\nreflects the war, like “Fringes of the Fleet,” “Sea Warfare,” “France,”\r\nand the “History of the Irish Guards.” Not soon forgotten will be that\r\ntribute to Roosevelt, tender and virile, “Great-Heart” (1919). In the\r\ncollected poems, _The Years Between_, there are challenging war poems,\r\n“For All We Have and Are,” an appeal to England, and “The Choice, or\r\nThe American Spirit Speaks,” for the United States. The elegy to “Lord\r\nRoberts,” less militant in tone, is true poetry in emotion and measure.\r\nSome stanzas are touched by irony, and have the sermonic quality which\r\nis characteristic--“The Sons of Martha,” “En-Dor” and “Russia to the\r\nPacifists.” The juvenile of 1923, _Land and Sea Tales for Boys and\r\nGirls_ (or _for Scouts and Scoutmasters_) is uneven in quality but it\r\nhas two dramatic sketches. _Eyes of Asia_, portraits of Europeans as\r\nseen by Oriental eyes, is more comparable to mediocre pages in _Actions\r\nand Reactions_ than it is to the more vital stories in _Plain Tales_\r\nand _The Day’s Work_. “Fumes of the Heart” is the best of these later\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nMr. Kipling is reaping honors in educational and civic life. His\r\nreserve, which is sometimes rated as coldness, keeps him far from the\r\nlimelight of publicity. He cannot be persuaded to “come to America”\r\nas lecturer or reader, in the train of many of his compatriots of far\r\nless worth or fame. In his Sussex home, with family and a few friends\r\nabout him, he is a delightful _raconteur_ or conversationalist upon\r\ntopics of world-wide politics. He is more amused than angered at some\r\nof the petty criticisms upon his writing, like the recent attack upon\r\n“Mandalay” for its anachronisms in geography, not unlike the charges\r\nagainst Shakespeare in _The Tempest_ and _The Winter’s Tale_. Arnold\r\nBennett, in _Books and Persons_,[63] has some comments upon Kipling’s\r\nflaws in _Actions and Reactions_ and his “prejudices and clayey\r\nideals,” but he ends with tribute to him as a painstaking artist,\r\ndevoted to his craft.\r\n\r\nPhilip Guedalla, brilliant journalist and ironist, in his essays, _A\r\nGallery_, under caption of “Mandalay,” says “much in little” about the\r\n“remoteness and antiquity” of Kipling; he finds him so “antiquated”\r\nthat the “Dinosaurus” might give him “points in modernity.” Despite\r\nsuch witty extravagances, however, the critic admits that Kipling “has\r\nsharpened the English language to a knife-edge and with it has cut\r\nbrilliant patterns on the surface of our prose literature.”[64] In\r\nboth his prose and poetry he has “sharpened the English language to\r\na knife-edge.” His verses may seem “antiquated” to the reader whose\r\nexclusive tastes welcome only “new poetry” and sneer at “lilting\r\nrhymes” and conventional meters. To broader minds, however, there is\r\nappreciation of the vibrant messages of spiritual courage, the bold and\r\ngraphic excerpts from real life, in both the verse and the fiction of\r\nKipling at his best.\r\n\r\nOne of the honors that came to this writer recently was an invitation\r\nto give the Rectorial Address at St. Andrews University, in 1923.\r\nThis has been published in book form as _Independence_, similar in\r\nformat to that of Barrie’s address, on a kindred occasion, entitled\r\n_Courage_. Mr. Kipling urges here the fundamental duty of developing\r\none’s individuality: “After all,” he says, “yourself is the only person\r\nyou can by no possibility get away from in this life, and maybe, in\r\nanother. It is worth a little pains and money to do good to him.”[65]\r\n\r\nHis idealism is not that of mere sentiment, much less of\r\nsentimentality. It is the idealism of work, of action, of\r\nresponsibility. It is the idealism even in the midst of misjudgments,\r\nof carrying “The White Man’s Burden,” of training youth towards clean,\r\nproductive manhood. One grants that some of his writings, both prose\r\nand verse, might be eliminated from collections and memory, with an\r\nincrease in his literary rank. He is uneven and was prone, in his\r\nearlier days, to mistake coarseness for vigor, yet he has been able to\r\nmake his readers both _listen_ and _see_. Perhaps he has not maintained\r\nthe almost unanimous favoritism among college youths that he had two\r\ndecades ago--there have been competitors with “college stories” of\r\nrank realism--but it may be questioned if any author of our day is more\r\noften quoted among both educated and unlettered adults. Mr. Kipling has\r\nnever been tempted to lower his standards for commercial ends; with\r\nfearless truth, he has spoken messages of uprightness and service. “A\r\nSong of the English” is national, perhaps imperialistic, but it has,\r\nlike scores of his other stanzas, a catholic message to Christian\r\nnations everywhere:\r\n\r\n    Keep ye the Law--be swift in all obedience--\r\n    Clear the land of evil, drive the road and bridge the ford.\r\n        Make ye sure to each his own\r\n        That he reap where he hath sown;\r\n    By the peace among our peoples let men know we serve the Lord![66]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1907.\r\n\r\n[56] _World’s Work_, February, 1908.\r\n\r\n[57] _Heretics_ by Gilbert K.

Only once had the prize\r\nbeen given to a Scandinavian, to Björnson, the Norwegian, in 1903.\r\nWhen the announcement came that the winner for 1909 was the Swedish\r\nwriter, Selma Lagerlöf, the most severe critics of the Nobel Foundation\r\nCommittee in former years were either commendatory or silently\r\nacquiescent. Here was an author who richly deserved the prize, for\r\nshe was already known throughout Europe and America for her unique\r\nfiction, in which photographic realism was always blended with a\r\ndominant note of idealism. The juvenile book which combined geography,\r\nfancy, humor, and fascination for old and young, _The Wonderful\r\nAdventures of Nils_, and other books had followed the strange tale\r\nof folklore and character study, _The Story of Gösta Berling_; these\r\nwritings were outstanding evidences of her literary gifts. It was an\r\nhonor to womanhood everywhere that the Nobel prize was given to Selma\r\nLagerlöf, first of the countrymen of Nobel to be thus immortalized in\r\nliterature. In her years of teaching and her later messages from the\r\npress, she had shown her sincere purpose “to benefit mankind.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of The American-Scandinavian Foundation_\r\n\r\nSELMA LAGERLÖF]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the family name of this woman means\r\n“laurel leaf,” a symbol of her fame. In _Mårbacka_, one of her later\r\nbooks to be translated into English, the reader finds detached\r\nphotographs of the home and environment of this author’s girlhood. Mrs.\r\nVelma Swanston Howard, who has been so successful as translator of Miss\r\nLagerlöf’s books, knows perfectly the languages of both Sweden and\r\nEngland; she is a friend of the author, with kinship in her traditions\r\nand spirit, and thus has sustained that indefinable but pervading\r\n“atmosphere” which characterizes all of Miss Lagerlöf’s fiction. The\r\nsetting of _Mårbacka_ is alive with elements of Nature and humanity,\r\nwith folklore and “wonderful tales of old Varmland” which became the\r\nbasis for many of her later books. The spacious manor house, where\r\nSelma Lagerlöf was born sixty-seven years ago, becomes familiar to\r\nreaders of this autobiography. The nursery chairs, with individual\r\nnames and portraits of Johan, Anna, and little Selma Ottiliana Louisa,\r\nwere treasured heirlooms; the beds that “parted company,” perhaps,\r\nin the night and the old owl in the lumber-loft above the bedroom,\r\ncontributed infantile “thrills” and memories.\r\n\r\nA gay-hearted, courageous, popular man was her father, Lieutenant\r\nLagerlöf, retired from the army but entertaining former associates in\r\nhis home and recounting, for his daughter’s education, tales of earlier\r\nhistory of Sweden and his family. The germ-idea of Gösta Berling,\r\nhero of her first romance, came after a reminiscence that her father\r\nhad told her one morning after breakfast, his memory of “the most\r\nfascinating of men,” one who could sing, write poetry, dance so that\r\nall feet moved in unison, and could bend everyone’s will to his own\r\nmood--and yet one who lacked certain qualities of manly strength. The\r\nmother of Selma Lagerlöf came from two generations of ministers; she\r\nwas quiet, practical, intuitive, a fine administrator of her large\r\nhousehold and frequent guests. Aunt Lovisa gave a touch of romance to\r\nthe family circle by a sad chapter in her past that is recounted in\r\n“The Bridal Crown,” the tragic result (according to legend) of the\r\nsubstitution of whortleberry for myrtle in the wreath for the bride’s\r\nhair. The nurse, Back-Kaisa, large and stern yet devoted to the family,\r\nwas another interesting character at Mårbacka; from the old housekeeper\r\nand the grandmother the children learned stories, sagas, and bits of\r\nfamily histories.\r\n\r\nWhen Selma Lagerlöf was three and a half years old, after bathing in\r\na fresh-water pond with her father, she developed a form of infantile\r\nparalysis. Months of inactivity followed; some lasting results of\r\nthis disease have been handicaps of the author throughout her life.\r\nWith humor and realistic portrayal of a child’s point of view of this\r\nperiod, she tells in _Mårbacka_, the chapter “Grand Company,” how\r\nshe increased in social importance in the family, having exclusive\r\nattention of the grim nurse, and dainties to eat in place of the usual\r\nfood, much to the jealous disgust of her brother and sister. A sojourn\r\nat Stromstead by the sea brought new vigor and recovery of motion to\r\nthe little girl; with amazement to herself and her family she walked to\r\ninvestigate a brilliant, stuffed “bird of paradise.” The sprightly zest\r\nin living, which characterizes the author’s personality, is reflected\r\nin all her books. Animals as pets, poultry of the farmyard, and birds\r\nand flowers are vital factors in her earlier and later tales.\r\n\r\nAmong important influences of her childhood was the singing of Bellman\r\nBallads, with their humor, pathos, and haunting music. One day when\r\nMiss Lagerlöf had won a place among twenty-five chosen candidates at\r\nTeachers’ College in Stockholm, and had been listening to a lecture\r\nabout Bellman and Runeberg and their ballads, she had her “flash of\r\ninspiration.” She determined to tell stories about her own Varmland;\r\nshe would become narrator of her “Cavaliers” and would incorporate\r\ninto her tales the legends, folklore and real characters of the home\r\ndistrict. She had cherished ambitions to write verse and even plays,\r\nfrom the days when, as a young girl, she visited her uncle in Stockholm\r\nand went to the theatre with the old housekeeper, becoming impressed\r\nby peasant plays and scenes from Nosselt’s _History_. She had lain\r\nawake at night, composing rhymes and neglecting the sleep which would\r\nhave fitted her for the tasks of the next day in “composition and\r\narithmetic.”[68]\r\n\r\nAfter graduation she taught at Landskrona, in the province of Skåne,\r\nalways hoping to find time to write, always meeting disappointments\r\nbecause of the demands of the classroom, often telling orally some of\r\nher tales to her pupils after school hours, always returning to her old\r\nhome, Mårbacka, in vacations and gaining new impetus for her literary\r\naspirations. Her first chapter of _The Story of Gösta Berling_ was\r\ncomposed on a Christmas holiday evening when she, with members of her\r\nfamily, was returning from a party at a distant neighbor’s house. A\r\nblizzard was raging and she sat in the sleigh, covered with furs, while\r\nthe old horse, urged by the aged coachman, tried to plough through the\r\ndrifts, in defiance of the wild winds. In her mind was formulated that\r\nchapter of the Christmas night at the smithy, which is an arresting\r\nepisode in the complete novel. She made first a metrical version;\r\nthen she tried it in dramatic form and, finally, wrote it as a short\r\nstory. Later she wrote other episodes--that of the flood at Ekeby and\r\nanother of the ball. In 1890, at the urgence of her sister, she sent\r\nsome of these episodic stories to a prize competition, offered by the\r\nmagazine, _Idun_, for the best novelette of one hundred pages. A few\r\nweeks later the journal announced that some of the manuscripts were “so\r\nconfusedly written that they could not be considered for the prize”;\r\nMiss Lagerlöf was sure that hers was among this rejected class. Then\r\ncame a telegram, signed by three classmates, with the words, “Hearty\r\nCongratulations.”\r\n\r\nThe editor offered to publish the novel, in expanded form, if Miss\r\nLagerlöf could have it ready in a short time. Again, she was in despair\r\nwhen a friend, Baroness Aldersparre, arranged financial matters so that\r\nthe teacher could be given a year’s leave of absence--and “the miracle\r\nhappened.” When she had completed this initial story, combining Swedish\r\nlegend, history of the days of the Cavaliers and the pensioners and\r\nthe old forges, with humor and delicate idealism, she was dissatisfied\r\nbecause it seemed to her “wild and disjointed.” There are passages\r\nwhere the sentences are detached, places where the links in her chain\r\nof plot are weak. In structure she has gained skill, as is evident\r\nby a comparison of her earlier fiction with such masterworks as the\r\nfirst part of _Jerusalem_ and _The Emperor of Portugallia_. With this\r\nimproved technic, she has kept her spontaneity, her vital realism and\r\nintuition, her spiritual insight. After the publication of one of her\r\nnovels, the _London Times_ said, with true emphasis upon her unusual\r\ncombination of qualities: “She is an idealist pure and simple in a\r\nworld given over to realism, yet such is the perfection of her style\r\nand the witchery of her fancy that a generation of realists worship\r\nher.” An optimism which defies apparent failures, akin to that of\r\nBrowning, brings about the redemption of her characters from Gösta\r\nBerling, drunken poet-preacher and fascinating vagabond, and flighty\r\nMarianne Sinclair to Lilliecrona, the restless violinist, and Glory\r\nGolden Sunnycastle, heroine of _The Emperor of Portugallia_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Velma Swanston Howard said, in a recent interview with the writer\r\nof this book, that Miss Lagerlöf, like her translator, considers this\r\nstory of Jan, who calls himself “The Emperor of Portugallia,” and his\r\ndaughter, Glory, as her best work in fiction. Thousands of readers will\r\necho the preference. To the incisive, ruthless realism in this tale she\r\nhas added sympathy that grips the heart, poetic setting and sagas, and\r\na message that is more impressive because it is dramatic rather than\r\nsermonic. The threads of this story are seldom tangled; the pattern\r\nstands out with distinctness and artistry.\r\n\r\n_Invisible Links_, a collection of short stories, was published in\r\n1894, with peasants, fisherfolk, children, and animals all “linked”\r\nin interrelations of spirit; Miss Lagerlöf then received a yearly\r\nstipend for her services to literature, through the friendly interest\r\nof the Swedish Academy and King Oscar and his son, Prince Eugen. With\r\na friend she went to Italy and Sicily, gaining impressions that bore\r\nharvest in _Miracles of Antichrist_, issued in 1897 and translated\r\ninto English two years later by Pauline Bancroft Flach, who had done\r\nthe same service for _The Story of Gösta Berling_ and _Invisible\r\nLinks_. Mingling traditions and poetry of old Sicily with reactions\r\nto modern socialism and its effects upon established religion, Miss\r\nLagerlöf wrote with deep fervor and colorful imagination. The slight\r\nplot is evolved about the ruse of the Englishwoman who coveted an image\r\nof Christ as a child, in a church in Rome, and substituted an image,\r\nseemingly the same but with the legend upon the crown, “My Kingdom\r\nis only of this World.” By a miracle, a few weeks later, the false\r\nimage is cast down and the true Christchild stands in the doorway. The\r\nAntichrist is taken away to Sicily where miracles of helpfulness are\r\nrecorded by its agnostic followers. Miss Lagerlöf seeks to preach,\r\nthrough the words of the Pope to Father Gondo, the ideal of unity\r\nbetween Christianity and antichristianity: “You could take the great\r\npopular movement in your arms, while it is still lying like a child\r\nin its swaddling clothes, and you could bear it to Jesus’ feet; and\r\nAntichrist would see that he is nothing but an imitation of Christ, and\r\nwould acknowledge him his Lord and Master.”[69]\r\n\r\n_From a Swedish Homestead_, which was published in 1899, contains the\r\nstrong, mystical novelette, “The Story of a Country House.” A student\r\nat Upsala University loses his reason as a result of seeing his flock\r\nof sheep frozen to death in a storm when, by his forethought, the\r\ntragedy might have been averted. Known as “The Goat,” he wanders about\r\nthe countryside, selling toys and trinkets, until his redemption and\r\nsanity are achieved through his love for a girl of noble character.\r\nAmong the other short tales in this same volume is “Santa Catarina\r\nof Siena,” a reflection of the Italian trip, and “The Emperor’s\r\nMoney Chest,” which is allegorical yet photographic of Belgium in an\r\nindustrial crisis.\r\n\r\nTwo other books preceded the award of the Nobel prize--_Jerusalem_\r\nand _The Wonderful Adventures of Nils_, with its sequel. In 1899,\r\nthe Swedish government gave to Miss Lagerlöf a commission to go to\r\nPalestine. She was to report, on her return, upon conditions which she\r\nmight discover there in the Swedish colony which had migrated from Nås,\r\na parish of Dalecarlia, a few years previously. Urged by promoters\r\nof missionary enterprise, among them Mrs. Edward Gordon of Chicago,\r\nscores of peasants and householders had sold their homesteads and left\r\ntheir families to join this colony in the Holy Land. Rumors had come to\r\nSweden of direful conditions there--of disease and hunger, of depleted\r\nmorale and bickerings among colonists and missionaries. “Jerusalem\r\nkills!” became a common phrase of the day. Miss Lagerlöf undertook\r\ninvestigation and made a report on existent evils and exaggerated\r\nrumors. She accomplished a far more important work for literature than\r\nthis report. She gathered material for one of her most emotional,\r\ngraphic books, _Jerusalem_. Against the background of facts, both in\r\nDalecarlia and Palestine, she wove a story of intense feeling, with\r\nfolklore, psychological insight, and characterization of a fine type.\r\nThe portrayals of the Ingmarsson family and the women, Brita, Karin,\r\nand Gertrude, whose fates were interlinked with those of the later\r\ngeneration of the ancestral family of Dalecarlia, are vivid.\r\n\r\nHumor relieves the tragic intensity of this book, so well rendered\r\ninto English by Mrs. Howard who has, says Mr. Henry Goddard Leach in\r\nthe Introduction, been able “to reproduce the original in essence as\r\nwell as verisimilitude.” An example of the descriptive style of this\r\nstory of Swedish life under religious tension is found in the opening\r\nsentences of the chapter, “The Departure of the Pilgrims” of Part\r\nI.[70] “One beautiful morning in July, a long train of cars and wagons\r\nset out from the Ingmar Farm. The Hellgumists had at last completed\r\ntheir arrangements, and were now leaving for Jerusalem--the first stage\r\nof the journey being the long drive to the railway station.\r\n\r\n“The procession, in moving towards the village, had to pass a wretched\r\nhovel which was called Mucklemire. The people who lived there were a\r\ndisreputable lot--the kind of scum of the earth which must have sprung\r\ninto being when our Lord’s eyes were turned, or when he had been too\r\nbusy elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“There was a whole horde of dirty, ragged youngsters on the place, who\r\nwere in the habit of running loose all day, shrieking after passing\r\nvehicles, and calling the occupants bad names; there was an old crone\r\nwho usually sat by the roadside, tipsy; and there were a husband and\r\nwife who were always quarrelling and fighting, and who had never been\r\nknown to do any honest work. No one could say whether they begged more\r\nthan they stole, or stole more than they begged.\r\n\r\n“When the Jerusalem-farers came alongside this wretched hovel, which\r\nwas about as tumbledown as a place can become when wind and storm\r\nhave, for many years, been allowed to work havoc, they saw the old\r\ncrone standing erect and sober at the roadside, on the same spot where\r\nshe usually sat in a drunken stupor ... and with her were four of the\r\nchildren. All five were now washed and combed, and as decently dressed\r\nas it was possible for them to be....\r\n\r\n“All the Jerusalem-farers suddenly burst into tears, the grown-ups\r\ncrying softly, while the children broke into loud sobs and wails....\r\nWhen they had all passed by, Beggar Lina also began to weep.\r\n\r\n“‘Those people are going to Heaven to meet Jesus,’ she told the\r\nchildren. ‘All those people are going to Heaven, but we are left\r\nstanding by the wayside.’”\r\n\r\nAnother literary outcome of the visit of Miss Lagerlöf to Palestine\r\nwas a renewed interest in legends about Jesus and the Virgin Mary.\r\nAlways deeply religious, with an unusual ability to blend worship with\r\ntradition and never lose the distinctive flavor of each element, she\r\nwrote the tales that were collected as _Christ Legends_, translated\r\nby Mrs. Howard in 1908. Here are new, impressive versions of such old\r\nmyths as “The Wise Men’s Well,” “Saint Veronica’s Kerchief,” and “Robin\r\nRedbreast.”\r\n\r\nThe Swedish school authorities wished for a good geography which should\r\nbe popular with the children and satisfy the teachers. The National\r\nTeachers’ Association appealed to Miss Lagerlöf for such a book and the\r\nresults were _The Wonderful Adventures of Nils_ and _Further Adventures\r\nof Nils_, appearing in 1906 and 1907. These books, so widely read in\r\nschools and homes in every civilized country to-day, are worthy a place\r\non the shelves beside _Alice in Wonderland_ of the past and _Doctor\r\nDoolittle_ of the present type of juveniles. The boy, Nils Holgersson,\r\nand his “goosey-gander,” with companions on the earth and in the air,\r\nappeal to the imagination of all ages, while the information about\r\nSweden’s outlines and landmarks is both accurate and entertaining.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the literary output of Miss Lagerlöf before she was\r\nchosen for the Nobel winner of 1909. Already she had been given a gold\r\nmedal for her work by the Swedish Academy and the degree of LL.D. by\r\nthe University of Upsala. Five years after the award she was elected\r\nto membership in the Swedish Academy, “the eighteen immortals”--the\r\nfirst woman to be thus honored. When the prize was given to her, with\r\na grand fête at Stockholm, she was the guest of honor at a banquet at\r\nthe Grand Hotel, given by King Gustav V. Her acceptance was in the form\r\nof a unique speech, a story, briefly told, of her summons to her father\r\nto aid her in saying the right words, this father who, long dead, had\r\nbeen her inspiration for her first work in literature and her spiritual\r\nguide in many crises. Wistful beauty and delicate humor were blended in\r\nthe closing words:[71] “Father sits and ponders a while; then he wipes\r\naway the tears of joy, shakes himself, and strikes his fist on the arm\r\nof the chair. ‘I don’t care to sit here any longer and muse on things\r\nwhich no one, either in heaven or on earth, can answer!’ he says.\r\n‘If you have received the Nobel Prize, I shan’t trouble myself about\r\nanything but to be happy.’\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness--Ladies and Gentlemen--since I got no better\r\nanswer to all my queries, it only remains for me to ask you to join\r\nme in a toast of gratitude, which I have the honour to propose to the\r\nSwedish Academy.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lagerlöf was fifty-one years old when this honor came to her; in\r\nthe years since then she has exemplified, in spoken and written words,\r\n“the noble idealism, the wealth of imagination, the soulful quality\r\nof her style.” Her speech, in 1911, when the International Suffrage\r\nCongress was held in Stockholm, was widely read and translated. In\r\nthis, as in so many of her stories, she stressed the idea of home and\r\nits influence throughout every avenue of betterment in the world. This\r\nyear marked, also, the publication of _Lilliecrona’s Home_, translated\r\nin English three years later by Anna Barwell. The setting was Varmland\r\nand the hero’s home, Lövdalla, closely resembles the home of the\r\nauthor, Mårbacka. This is, perhaps, the most poetic and mystical of\r\nall her stories. The violinist who found in “music and music alone his\r\nhome, his place of rest,” is a haunting character, sharing many traits\r\nwith Gösta Berling. His life-passage is turbulent, often dramatic,\r\nsometimes melancholy, ending in a happy romance for him and Maia Lisa,\r\nthe pastor’s daughter. There are scenes of emotional vigor, like “The\r\nBride’s Dance” and “The Accusation.” These are comparable to the more\r\nfamiliar chapters in _The Story of Gösta Berling_, like that where\r\nthe autocratic Mistress of Ekeby is driven forth by her pensioners\r\nbecause they discover that she has vowed a soul each year to the devil\r\n(in expiation for her secret sin) or the redemptive power of Countess\r\nElizabeth in reclaiming Gösta’s manhood. Beautiful descriptions of\r\napple orchards in bloom are found in the later book, interwoven with\r\nromantic legends like the excitement for the pastor’s daughter when\r\nyoung Lilliecrona comes forward in her dream and offers her water\r\n“after the magic pancake,” a sure prophecy that he will be her husband.\r\n\r\nAgainst the same background of her girlhood home is placed the later,\r\nstrong story of _The Emperor of Portugallia_. This is less episodic\r\nand more unified than some of her other fiction. Jan, the dull,\r\nplodding man with no zest in life until he holds in his arms his little\r\ndaughter, whom he calls Glory Goldie Sunnycastle, is a vital character;\r\nwe share his pride in the beauty and charm of Glory, his faith in her\r\neven when rumors would smirch her moral character, not without basis,\r\nas she goes out into the world to save the home for Jan and his wife,\r\nKatrina, his final act of self-sacrifice when, with clouded mind but\r\nspiritual vision, he would save her from the demons of “Pride and\r\nHardness, Lust and Vice.” This story has been well called in France “an\r\nepic of fatherhood--a Swedish _Père Goriot_.”\r\n\r\nIn 1922 appeared in the United States _The Outcast_, the English\r\nversion of _Bannlyst_, as its title was in Swedish when it was\r\npublished in 1918. The World War entered as a motif in the latter part\r\nof the story, sometimes with strained effects. As a work of artistic\r\nfiction it seems inferior to _The Story of Gösta Berling_ or _The\r\nEmperor of Portugallia_. It has virility however, and much intensity\r\nof feeling. Although she lived in a neutral country Miss Lagerlöf was\r\ndeeply stirred by the war and the terrible sacrifices of life. She\r\nresented all evidences of brutal humanity. The sacredness of human\r\nlife forms her keynote in _The Outcast_. Sven Elversson, who had lived\r\nthrough a fearful experience upon an Arctic expedition and had been\r\naccused of eating human flesh in an hour of imminent famine, returns\r\nto his mother and his home to find himself denounced by the villagers\r\nand even by the minister. To save his mother from further torture of\r\nspirit, after he has tried in vain to overcome the prejudice of the\r\npeople by his charity and Christlike deeds, he goes away to the woods\r\nof the Far North. Here he wanders, and is called “The Outcast,” until\r\nhe meets the beautiful wife of the bigoted minister who had preached\r\nagainst Sven, the man who, in unfounded jealousy, had cast off his\r\nwife. The love scenes in this book are elemental in their simplicity,\r\nyet have poetic touches. Then comes the Battle of Jutland and the\r\nfrightful scenes when the bodies of the dead are washed upon the shores\r\nof his home town. Sven returns and organizes a group of men to bury\r\nthe dead; in the pocket of one of the victims is found a letter which\r\nexonerates Sven from the false charge of cannibalism. It is a daring,\r\ngrotesque tale in parts, with local color and superstition interwoven\r\nwith good character-drawing and a dominant message of faith.\r\n\r\nAn early folk story which has been recently translated by Arthur\r\nG. Chater, is entitled _The Treasure_. It is slight in volume and\r\nliterary value compared with such major books as _Jerusalem_ and _The\r\nEmperor of Portugallia_. It has features of the spectacular with\r\nrestrained dramatic power. It lends itself to scenario effects because\r\nof the pictorial background and the brilliant contrasts in characters\r\nand sentiments. In Sweden of the sixteenth century, in the days of\r\nFrederick II of Denmark (who was also ruler of Sweden), occurred this\r\nlegendary tale. It mingles the sea, with its galleys and its wild\r\nstorms, with the parsonage and the hidden treasure chest which was\r\nlooted. All the family had been murdered by these mysterious robbers\r\nexcept a foster child, Elsalill. The supernatural element is used with\r\nfine effects; this girl is haunted by the ghost and messages from her\r\nfoster sister who was killed. Elsalill is in anguish of spirit because\r\nshe loves the bold, persuasive, and richly apparelled Sir Archer,\r\nalthough she finds that he is one of the robber-murderers. How her body\r\nbecomes his shield from the sheriff, even to her death and his escape,\r\nforms the romantic climax of this tale.\r\n\r\nMiss Lagerlöf’s early ambition to become a dramatist has never wholly\r\ndied; she has written a few plays that have been staged with success\r\nin Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Among these has been a dramatization\r\nof _The Girl from the Marshcroft_; this story has been shown as a film\r\nin many places in America as well as abroad. The setting in rural\r\npicturesqueness, with tragic and romantic notes mingled, affords\r\ndramatic opportunities. Mrs. Howard says that _The Story of Gösta\r\nBerling_ has been shown at the cinema in Sweden and elsewhere in\r\nEurope. “Will Miss Lagerlöf ever come to the United States?” we ask her\r\nfriend and translator. The reply is a probable negative. She is deeply\r\ninterested in America and reads many books by our authors, especially\r\nthose of mystical or informing trend. She had an uncle who lived in\r\nSeattle and, on the walls of her dining-room, are found landscapes\r\nof Western America. She is not very strong, although never lacking\r\nin energy of mind and purpose. The freedom and vivacity of American\r\nwomen impress her as she receives many visitors, either at her summer\r\nhome at Mårbacka or in the winter at Falun, close to the scenes of the\r\nfirst part of _Jerusalem_. She reads six languages with ease and is\r\nconversant with the major interests of every country. She has a keen\r\nhumor and rare graciousness.\r\n\r\nMiss Lagerlöf is intensely racial and national in her literary\r\nreflections; she is international in her sympathies and insight into\r\nproblems of life. Love of home is one of the primal qualities of her\r\npersonality and writing. She has applied her creed of “keeping the\r\nimagination young” by never losing her own delight in sagas, hero\r\ntales, and “belief in fairies” that will enhearten and redeem humanity.\r\nEdwin Björkman, in _Voices of Tomorrow_, has stressed her ability\r\nand courage “to dream and feel and aspire.” Her literary work varies\r\nin excellence; sometimes it is weak in structure and ineffective in\r\nartistry; in other and major portions she has clothed the commonplace\r\nincidents of life with original, new vitality and revealed their\r\nmeanings with imaginative beauty. Her characters and settings are\r\nracial but her impulses and messages are universal, unconfined by land\r\nor age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1909.\r\n\r\n[68] _Selma Lagerlöf; The Woman, Her Work, Her Message_ by Harry E.\r\nMaule, Garden City, N.

Two more\r\ndistinguished authors with international reputations were added in 1910\r\nand 1912, making four awards to German literature within eight years.\r\nPaul Heyse, the versatile author of the year 1910 has been difficult\r\nto classify, because he is dramatist, poet, novelist, and writer of a\r\nform of short story known as the _Novelle_. More than one hundred and\r\nfifty of these tales are accredited to him, in addition to prodigious\r\nindustry in other literary forms. The _Novelle_ bears some resemblance\r\nto the short stories of Hoffmann, Tieck, Alfred de Musset, and the\r\nAmerican masters of this type, Poe, Hawthorne, and O. Henry. In more\r\ndefinite method than some of these _conteurs_, Heyse developed a\r\nprinciple which he applied and explained, in part, in his Introduction\r\nto his _Deutscher Novellenschatz_; he stresses the fact that the\r\nessential foundation of this form is “what children call the story” but\r\nhe adds, “A strong silhouette should not be lacking.” The “silhouette\r\nwill be a brief summary of conditions which underlie the focal scene\r\nor incident.” Thus Heyse became creator, or developer, of this form of\r\nfiction, with a wide range of incidents and characters, in which keen\r\nobservation of life and faithful recital were blended with idealism of\r\na distinctive motive--that of “glorifying nature,” human and inanimate.\r\n\r\nJohann Ludwig Paul Heyse was born in Berlin, March 15, 1830; he was\r\neighty years old when the Nobel honor was received. His father, Karl\r\nLudwig Heyse, with a firm, Teutonic nature, was a famous philologist\r\nand professor at the University of Berlin. His mother came from a\r\nJewish family of wealth and social rank. In his _Memoirs_, her son\r\nrecalls her as “passionate and imaginative”; from her he inherited his\r\nbent toward story-telling and delight in the sensuous which mingled\r\nwith the rationalistic trend of mind, bequeathed by his father. In\r\nthe home of the Heyses gathered scholars, authors, and artists. The\r\natmosphere fostered the natural precocity of the boy, Paul. One\r\nof his older friends was Kugler, the historian of art, who had an\r\ninspirational influence upon the youth; in manhood, Heyse married the\r\ngifted daughter of this friend.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Bonn, where Heyse went from Berlin, he showed\r\nmuch interest in Romance languages. He was fascinated with Spanish,\r\nespecially the writings of Cervantes and Calderon. In 1849, and again\r\nin 1852, he traveled in Italy, adding Dante, Boccaccio, and Leopardi\r\nto his list of literary heroes. The homes of artists were open to him\r\nand he found Italy an ideal land of “colour and grace.” Shakespeare\r\nreceived his tribute throughout his literary life. He began to write\r\ndramas and lyric poems, tales in verse and prose with youthful zest and\r\nmarks of great promise. In 1854, King Max of Bavaria offered to him a\r\nposition at the Court of Munich, at a salary of 1500 florins. Munich\r\nwas an environment sure to awaken his talent and satisfy his love of\r\nbeauty. Under Louis I it had been favored with some fine buildings; an\r\natmosphere of culture was pervasive. Among the poets and scholars, with\r\nwhom Heyse became associated here, were Geibel, Bodenstedt, Wilbrandt,\r\nLuogg, and Schack, the historian. In 1868, when Louis II, successor to\r\nKing Max, insulted Geibel, the poet, and caused him to leave the city,\r\nHeyse was depressed although he stayed in Munich, living in a charming\r\nvilla there until his death in 1914.\r\n\r\nFrom the early years of his authorship, Heyse showed an aristocratic\r\nculture which did not dim his interest in fisherfolk, peasants, and\r\nrural characters. Although family sorrows came upon him, and he\r\nsuffered, from 1880 to 1900, from attacks by the ardent followers\r\nof Zola and Ibsen, yet he never lost his serenity of character and\r\nhis belief in individualistic expression. “Instinct” was his guide,\r\nas he has exemplified in scores of his tales and dramas. The “child\r\nof nature,” or the man or woman of inherent nobility, was incapable\r\nof any low or mean action according to his belief. In _Salamander_,\r\nwhich Mr. Georg Brandes regards as his best _Novelle_ in versified\r\nform,[73] he expresses his creed of the vigorous life, of allegiance to\r\nnature, in spite of failings and adverse judgments against him by the\r\n“naturalistic school”:\r\n\r\n    I never yet of virtue or of failing\r\n    Have been ashamed, nor proudly did adorn\r\n    Myself of one, nor thought my sins of veiling.\r\n\r\n    Beyond all else, betwixt the nobly born\r\n    And vulgar herd, this marks the separation,--\r\n    The cowards whose hypocrisy we scorn.\r\n\r\n    Him I call noble, who, with moderation,\r\n    Carves his own honor, and but little heeds\r\n    His neighbors’ slander or their approbation.[74]\r\n\r\nAnother character, familiar to readers of Heyse, Toinette of _Kinder\r\nder Welt_ (_Children of the World_) speaks words of similar trend often\r\nquoted; “There is but _one_ genuine nobility; to remain true to one’s\r\nself.... He who bears within himself the true rank, lives and dies\r\nthrough his own grace, and is, therefore, sovereign.”\r\n\r\nTo Italy, Heyse turns for sensuous delights in many of his tales.\r\n_L’Arrabiata_, probably the best known of any of his _Novellen_ by\r\nstudents of German in colleges and classes, written when he was\r\ntwenty-three, has an interesting history.[75] Paul Heyse as a young\r\nman, and his friend, Joseph Victor Scheffel, were at an inn at\r\nSorrento. They had been together at Capri and had planned to hold a\r\n“literary joust,” to read to each other, at Sorrento, some new tale or\r\npoem. Scheffel contributed the poem, _Der Trumpeter von Gättingen_;\r\nHeyse read _L’Arrabiata_. Piquant is this tale of the maiden’s love\r\nfor Antonio, the boatman, and her maidenly pride and resistance to his\r\nlove until the injury to his arm and his plea to her, in memory of her\r\nmother, brings about a romantic sequel. Twenty-five years later Heyse\r\nwas again at Sorrento; he sent a greeting, in rhyme, to this friend of\r\nearlier days and later life. He told him that he had seen again his\r\nmodel, “Laurella,” on the street but she did not recognize him; she was\r\nfar removed from the “madcap” of fifteen, the “cross-patch,” with her\r\nyouthful charm and wistful appeal. The background of this tale, against\r\nNaples and Vesuvius, is painted with that vivid photography which\r\ncharacterizes Heyse’s scenes in drama and fiction. Unlike Balzac or\r\nTurgenieff, he wrote few words of description but “created atmosphere”\r\nthat was alive. Striking examples are the familiar tales, “Barbarossa,”\r\n“At the Ghost Hour” and “The Dead Lake.”\r\n\r\nIn the later _Novellen_, as well as the novels and plays of other\r\nyears, Heyse showed tendencies towards realism and less romanticism.\r\nOn the other hand, he never lost his urge for sensuous beauty, his\r\ndetermination “to follow one’s bent” (“sich gehen zu lassen”). He\r\nwould not compel himself to irksome writing; he would yield to\r\nimpulse and mood. “The real sin is against nature” was his keynote,\r\nreiterated from the short tale of “Reise nach dem Glück” (“Journey\r\nAfter Happiness”) to the longer novels, _Kinder der Welt_ (_Children\r\nof the World_) and _Im Paradiese_ (_In Paradise_). In philosophy he\r\nhas been called both fatalistic and epicurean. The conflicts between\r\nrestraint and self-surrender, especially in women, are germ-ideas\r\nin such diverse writings as _L’Arrabiata_, _The Sabine Women_ (with\r\nthe heroine, Tullia) and _In Paradise_, with the forceful character\r\nof Irene. In the dialogue, in _Children of the World_, between\r\nBalder, the invalid-idealist and Franzel, the socialist-printer, the\r\nauthor’s convictions are unfolded. Balder declares that life is full\r\nof enjoyment to him, in spite of outward sufferings, because “he can\r\nexperience past and future,” because he can “conjure up” all the\r\nperiods of his life and find a totality, a completeness of enjoyment.\r\nSo the young baron in the novel, _In Paradise_, which has been\r\nvehemently discussed for two generations, sins against his own nature\r\nand his friend and, for a time, his “inner harmony” is destroyed but\r\nafter sufferings, portrayed with analytical skill, harmony is restored.\r\nThe city of Munich, in its varied aspects as related to society and\r\nthe arts, forms the “chorus” and subtle influence in this dramatic\r\nstory.[76]\r\n\r\nHeyse has written more than sixty dramas yet too few of them are\r\ntranslated adequately into English; too often they have failed in stage\r\npresentation. Many are historical; _The Sabine Women_ is erotic and\r\nless consistent in development than _Hans Lange_, _Hadrian Colberg_,\r\nand _Mary of Magdala_; the last play has been translated by William\r\nWinter and by Lionel Vale. The old philologist, Zipfel, in _Colberg_,\r\nmay have been modeled, in part, from Heyse’s father. His speech,\r\nrelating the story of Leonidas and the Persian War, reaches a climax\r\nof courage and self-sacrifice, with an application to later days of\r\nstruggle between the French and Germans. In Henning, the old servant in\r\n_Hans Lange_, the author emphasizes his belief in the redemptive power\r\nof nobler nature, in spite of incentives to revenge against the young\r\nsquire.\r\n\r\nThere is unevenness of workmanship among the many _Novellen_. _Felice_,\r\nthe tale of the peasant girl who “listened to reason rather than the\r\ncall of passion,” is a vital expression of the author’s creed of\r\nobedience to “impulse of the heart.” The later tales are more keen\r\nand realistic than the photographic, romantic scenes laid in Italy\r\nand Southern Germany. Heyse became more of an analyst of all kinds of\r\nhumanity, with their conflicting “impulses,” but he never acquiesced\r\nin the scenes of squalor and moral slime that delighted some of his\r\ncontemporaries of the “naturalistic school.” By contrast, he was an\r\nidealist with a strong vein of poetry. One of his best stories of\r\nlater period, _The Last Centaur_, expresses his revolt against the\r\nmaterialistic spirit of his age. The creature who represents the age\r\nof myths and imagination is driven back into the wood by the evil\r\nways and heartless gibes of the modern villages; in turn, he scorns\r\ntheir opposition with “an exhalted humor.” It seems almost a modern\r\nversion of the old tale of _Baucis and Philemon_. In another tale, _The\r\nIncurable_, the hero keeps faith in the ideal, in spite of the “rabble\r\nin kid gloves.” _Die Blinden_ (_The Blind_) is an appealing story, with\r\ncolorful pictures of garden and ravens and flocks, and two children,\r\nClement and Marlene, waiting with tense emotion for the doctors to\r\nrestore their sight. The stern father, obsessed with his idea of\r\n“duty,” is a strong character. “Nils mit der offenen Hand” is a fairy\r\ntale that defies adequate translation into English but has situations\r\nof dramatic skill, notably that of the gulls biting the rope at the\r\nexecution of Nils, and the brave deed of Stina, the princess who loves\r\nNils.\r\n\r\nHeyse was more successful in portraying women than men. He was long\r\ncalled “the favorite of maidens.” He had insight to see fairly and to\r\nbalance well the traits of normal maidenhood--beauty, coyness, love\r\nof prowess and adventure, ardent but concealed love until the lover\r\ncame to whom she would yield her “maidenly pride” (“Mädschenstoltz”).\r\nThere are traces of the influence of Goethe in certain passages in\r\n_Kinder der Welt_, and such _Novellen_ as _The Broiderer of Treviso_,\r\n_The Prodigal Son_, and _The Spell of Rothenburg_. In the last story,\r\nthere are comments upon art, interwoven with humor and irony as the\r\ncharacters journey from Ausbach to Würzburg. Originality, however,\r\nmarks his drama and his fiction--that “ideal conception and fine\r\nliterary craftsmanship” which won for him the Nobel inscription.\r\n\r\nMr. Georg Brandes believes that Heyse was, primarily, a pupil of\r\nEichendorf, as his poetry indicates.[77] The poems by Heyse are less\r\nfamiliar than his prose, although he wrote both epics and lyrics.\r\n“Salamander” ranks among his best long poems; “The Fury” and “The\r\nFairy Child” are examples of his lyrics. He delighted to translate--or\r\ntranspose--troubadour lays, folk songs from the Spanish and the\r\nItalian. Like Mendelssohn, to whom he has been compared in temperament,\r\nhe lacked dynamic force but he was sensitive, artistic, and idealistic\r\nin his basic character.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERHART HAUPTMANN (1912)\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1912 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  Hauptmann, Gerhart, born 1862: “principally for his rich, versatile,\r\n  and prominent activity in the realm of the drama.”[78]\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter century since the first Nobel prize was awarded,\r\nit has happened, at intervals, that two representatives of the same\r\nnation but different generations, are found on the lists in literature.\r\nThus Björnson and Hamsun, among Norwegian novelists, Echegaray\r\nand Benavente in Spanish Drama, and Heyse and Hauptmann in German\r\nliterature of the imagination, are exponents of succeeding generations\r\nof thought and expression. Heyse stood for the older, more poetic\r\nand romantic forms; he decreed a philosophy of nobleness in man and\r\ncontentment in life. Gerhart Hauptmann, who received the prize only two\r\nyears later than Heyse, in 1912, was ranked by some critics with the\r\nrealists of the modern, restless type, whose criticism of society in\r\ngeneral was world-disturbing. After 1900 the fame of Heyse had declined\r\namong the younger, more progressive writers. His award, at eighty\r\nyears, revived interest in his writings, especially the _Novellen_;\r\ntranslations and articles about his personality were widely printed in\r\ncurrent journals.\r\n\r\nOne of the authors whom Heyse had censured for his naturalism and\r\ndepressing dramas had been Gerhart Hauptmann. When the announcement\r\nwas made that the prize of 1912 was again given to a German novelist\r\nand playwright, racial pride ran high but critics of other countries\r\nasked, “How could idealism be perverted in meaning so that it would\r\napply to the author of _Before Dawn_, _Lonely Lives_, _The Weavers_\r\nand _Michael Kramer_?” Unfairly, the name of Hauptmann was linked\r\nconstantly with that of Sudermann by the most bitter malcontents with\r\nthis award. Such an attitude was biassed and unjust. That Hauptmann has\r\nwritten some of the most photographic, haunting dramas of industrial\r\nstrife and social vices is true; but it is as true that he has produced\r\ntwo, possibly three, of the really poetic, symbolic plays in modern\r\nGerman literature--_The Assumption of Hannele_, _The Sunken Bell_, and\r\n_Parsival_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an original etching by Hermann Struck. Reproduced\r\nby permission of the artist and courtesy of the New York Public Library_\r\n\r\nGERHART HAUPTMANN]\r\n\r\nThere are two distinctive, but not wholly contradictory, personalities\r\nin Hauptmann as he reveals himself to his readers. It was as author\r\nof _The Sunken Bell_, especially, that he was chosen for the Nobel\r\nprize; it had certain autobiographical suggestions of this conflict\r\nbetween the material and the spiritual in the nature of its author.\r\nRecognizing that he is often associated with Sudermann, the brilliant,\r\nrelentless novelist and dramatist, it is interesting to find these two\r\nwriters well differentiated by Otto Heller in _Studies in Modern German\r\nLiterature_ (Boston, 1905). He compares the nervous, sensitive mind of\r\nHauptmann, “possessed of a reproductive, feminine talent,” in contrast\r\nwith the masculine personality of Sudermann, less subtle, more virile\r\nand coarse, with broader knowledge of life but lacking the intuitive\r\nperceptions of Hauptmann. One may question some of these adjectives\r\nused by Mr. Heller, but the general contrast is well phrased,\r\nespecially as applied to the poetic dramas by Hauptmann, like _The\r\nSunken Bell_, _And Pippa Dances_, and _Parsival_.\r\n\r\nBefore Hauptmann conceived any of this work that entitles him to rank\r\namong the idealists, he had written grim tragedies, similar in trend to\r\nthose by Ibsen, Zola, Tolstoy, Max Nordau, and Arno Holz. As realist\r\nhe has been censured as weak in plots and sometimes strained in his\r\nsocial tenets: there are such defects in _The Beaver Coat_, _Rose\r\nBernd_, and _The Conflagration_. That he had a poetic instinct, a true\r\nlyric quality, was acknowledged from occasional lines in such gloomy\r\nplays as _Lonely Lives_, _Colleague Crampton_, and _The Weavers_. Among\r\nthe plays of industrial upheaval and suffering, _The Weavers_ has\r\ntense feeling, with lines of irony and suppressed aspirations. It was\r\ndedicated to Robert Hauptmann, father of the author, in affectionate\r\nwords that express the source of its inspiration and the allegiance\r\nof Gerhart Hauptmann to his forefathers: “You, dear father, know what\r\nfeelings lead me to dedicate this work to you, and I am not called upon\r\nto analyze them here. Your stories of my grandfather, who in his young\r\ndays sat at the loom, a poor weaver like those here depicted, contained\r\nthe germ of my drama. Whether it possesses the vigor of life or is\r\nrotten at the core, it is the best ‘so poor a man as Hamlet is,’ can\r\noffer.”\r\n\r\nWhile this grandfather had been a poor weaver, he met with better\r\nfortunes in later life, and the father of Gerhart Hauptmann was owner\r\nof three hotels. The boy was born at Salzbrunn, a seaside town in\r\nSilesia, in 1862; thus he was thirty-two years younger than Heyse--a\r\nfull generation in time and standards of literature. His mother was\r\n“one of the people.” The boy was inclined to study sculpture and he\r\nwas sent to art schools in Breslau, Jena, and in Italy. He was a slow\r\npupil; his brother, Carl, seemed almost the only person who expressed\r\nfaith in his gifts or future success. With his art studies he combined\r\nagriculture and history. After a brief apprenticeship as modeler, he\r\ndecided that he would be an actor; he had a lisp that interfered with\r\nthe continuance of this histrionic hope. He married a woman of wealth\r\nand moved to Berlin, in 1885, where he became identified with “The Free\r\nStage” movement and began to write plays. Byron had been one of his\r\nearlier literary heroes; in _The Fate of the Children of Prometheus_,\r\nhe recorded some impressions of travel along the same route as _Childe\r\nHarold’s Pilgrimage_.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 “The Free Stage Society” was formed in Berlin; it was, in a\r\nway, “an imitation of Antoine’s Free Theatre, organized two years\r\nbefore,” says Barrett H. Clark in _A Study of the Modern Drama_.[79]\r\nAmong the founders were Otto Brahm, Maximilian Harden, Theodor Wolff\r\nand others who wished to produce plays of varied types, especially\r\nthe work of naturalistic writers. Hauptmann came under the influences\r\nof Bruno Wille, the socialist, and Arno Holz, the dramatist; certain\r\nreactions from this companionship of minds may be traced in his plays\r\n_Before Dawn_, _Colleague Crampton_, and _Florian Geyer_. Brahm was the\r\ndirector of this Free Stage Society which, in 1894, after fulfilling\r\nits mission for Germany, was merged into the Deutsches Theatre. Among\r\nthe plays by Hauptmann written under this stimulus, in addition to the\r\nthree mentioned above, were _The Festival of Peace_, _Lonely Lives_,\r\n_The Weavers_, _The Beaver Coat_, and _The Assumption of Hannele_.\r\n_Before Dawn_, written in the Silesian mountains and staged in Berlin,\r\nin 1889, was a haunting tragedy with loose construction. The ribald\r\nfather and his low associates, and the daughter, who kills herself to\r\nescape assault at their hands, combine to make a gripping, repulsive\r\nstory with certain dramatic possibilities that are not fulfilled.\r\n\r\n_The Weavers_ showed progress in technic and characterization of a\r\ngroup. Here no single individual plays the leading part; the group\r\nof weavers, the mob at the time of crisis, are the principal actors.\r\nThere are marked contrasts in setting between the home of the rich\r\ncapitalist and the poverty of the weavers, between the government’s\r\nindifference and the industrial slavery of the victims of rapacity. One\r\nof the most poignant passages is the monologue of old Ansorge, in Act\r\nII; he cannot believe that the King will fail to help them, if word is\r\nsent to him of their needs. When Jaeger assures him it is futile, that\r\nthe rich people are as “cunning as the devil,” his lament for the home\r\nthat must be sacrificed, where his father sat at the loom for more than\r\nforty years, is pathetic and dramatic.\r\n\r\n_The Assumption of Hannele_, which appeared in 1893 and had a germ-idea\r\nnot unlike that of _Before Dawn_, created sharp discussion in Germany.\r\nThere was protest against its performance. The next year it was brought\r\nto the United States, to be staged at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New\r\nYork. It was translated into English by William Archer and by Charles\r\nHenry Meltzer. Reformers of many kinds denounced the play without a\r\nhearing. They threatened the author, who had come to this country to\r\nsee the performance and to advise with his publisher, with arrest; the\r\nsame fate was to fall upon the translator, Charles Henry Meltzer, and\r\nthe actress who was to play the leading rôle. “Some representatives\r\nof the press, with critics and authors, were bidden to a private\r\nperformance and the next day the newspapers, with a few impenitent\r\nexceptions, published eulogies of _Hannele_! No one was arrested. And\r\nthe public performance took place.”[80]\r\n\r\nThe American translator of both _The Assumption of Hannele_ and _The\r\nSunken Bell_, Mr. Charles Henry Meltzer, has described Hauptmann at\r\nthis period, in the Foreword to _The Sunken Bell_. He had expected to\r\nmeet an aggressive, self-satisfied man. On the contrary, he found one\r\nwho seemed like a student, with shy, boyish manners; he might have\r\nbeen classified as a curate or a teacher; “A painful, introspective,\r\nhunted earnestness was stamped upon his face--the face of a thinker, a\r\ndreamer, a genius” (Foreword). _Hannele_ was not a success theatrically\r\nin New York. _The Weavers_, at the Irving Place Theatre, attracted\r\nsomewhat more attention but the time was too indifferent to such plays\r\nin America; one could not forecast the cordial reception for problem\r\nplays and grim tragedies, with mystic elements, three decades later.\r\n\r\nIt was eighteen years before the Swedish Academy gave world recognition\r\nand honor to Hauptmann. A few men and women of literary insight--or\r\nforesight--proclaimed a future for the creator of such a “dream-poem”\r\nas _Hannele_. Gradually, readers became interested and stirred by this\r\nstrange play based upon the weird apparitions of the fevered brain\r\nof the little waif, the poetic chorus of the angels, the comfort of\r\nher mother and Pastor Gottwald, in contrast with the terrifying fear\r\nof her father’s return, the stormy December evening in this mountain\r\nalmshouse, and the poems of “The Stranger” which cast a spell of\r\nreligious peace upon the reader, as the mystic, green light fell upon\r\nthe face of dying Hannele. This “dream-poem,” as Hauptmann called it,\r\nwon for him the Grillparzer prize in Germany. Two years later, after\r\nthe failure of _Florian Geyer_ to win plaudits of dramatic critics,\r\nhe wrote another play of symbolism and anapestic meters, combining\r\nthe realities of life with mystic allurements, and he called it “A\r\nFairy-Tale Play,” _Die versunkene Glocke_. His most severe critics were\r\nconvinced of his lyrical quality and dramatic power.\r\n\r\nThe basic material for this play, _The Sunken Bell_, says its\r\ntranslator, Mr. Meltzer, is found in Grimm’s Teutonic Mythology. Here\r\nare the characters of the bell maker, his wife, the elfish spirit,\r\nthe schoolmaster and the vicar, and other factors interwoven with the\r\nallegorical and mystical. Hauptmann visualized these characters with\r\nconsummate skill. Heinrich, the bell forger, who seeks the sun and a\r\nnew, marvellous chime of bells, Magda, his faithful wife eager to\r\nfree him from domestic toils, Rautendelein, the spirit of nature that\r\nlures him away and stirs his soul to unfulfilled aspirations, and\r\nWittikin, the wise woman, the village priest and barber--all are alive\r\nand convincing. The evasive and mystical element becomes a part of the\r\natmosphere of this “fairy-tale play”; the dramatic unities are well\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of _The Sunken Bell_? Each reader may make his own\r\nanswer, for several are possible. It is as futile to analyze it, as\r\nit is to destroy the fantasy and mystery of _Peter Pan_ or _The Blue\r\nBird_ or _Dear Brutus_. It is too subtle, too delicate to be treated by\r\nrigid rules of criticism. However, Mr. Meltzer makes three pertinent\r\nexplanations; it may be a parable, the effort of all artists to reach\r\ntheir ideals; it may be the effort of a reformer to remold society by\r\nvisionary ambitions; or Heinrich may embody any human being, striving\r\nfor the goal of truth and light. As Rautendelein symbolizes Nature\r\nwhich offers freedom, so Wittikin expresses the eternal philosophy of\r\nlife, opposed to the conventional creeds of the world, like those of\r\nthe barber and the vicar, that are stumbling-blocks in the path of\r\nlofty idealism. Heinrich fails to attain his ideal; he cannot weld the\r\npagan and Christian truths into one gospel, because he is _human_, with\r\nlimitations. He cannot stay on the pinnacle of the mountain, with its\r\nmystic light and its new sun-bells, but he has not lost the influence\r\nof these in his life. When the vicar rejoices that “the old Heinrich”\r\nhas returned, he answers:\r\n\r\n    That man am I, and yet ... another man.\r\n    Open the windows--Light and God stream in.[81]\r\n\r\nThis play proved a moderate success, especially when played by Sothern,\r\nand has been repeated in academic circles, although it has not been\r\nso popular in America as have been the plays by Ibsen, Rostand, and\r\nMaeterlinck. It is one of the dramas that yields more of its beauty\r\nand symbolic message to the reader than to the spectator. The play,\r\n_Henry of Aue_, or _Der arme Heinrich_, which was called a fable\r\n(1902) has sometimes been listed as a sequel to _The Sunken Bell_\r\nbut they are unlike in setting and theme. Heinrich, the crusader, is\r\nattacked with leprosy at the summit of his glory--a punishment for his\r\ninsolence to God. The healing begins when he purges his soul of despair\r\nand hatred and begins to recognize “Beneficence” in Nature and Life.\r\nThere are well drawn characters, especially Heinrich, Hartmann von\r\nAue, Gottfried, Brigitta, and Ottegebe, the farmer’s daughter, whose\r\ninfluence is strong in the “cure” for the hero. As dramatic art this\r\nplay is inferior to _Hannele_ or _The Sunken Bell_, but the reader’s\r\ninterest is sustained in the leading character, from his tragic\r\ncondition as an outcast, with a wooden clapper to warn people of his\r\napproach, to the last scene of his redemption by love.\r\n\r\nDuring the years since he received the Nobel prize, Hauptmann has\r\nwritten several plays and novels that continue to reveal his dual\r\ntraits as realist and idealist. The writings during the World War\r\nhave a tang of bitterness. Ludwig Lewisohn has edited eight volumes\r\nof Hauptmann’s _Dramatic Works_ (Huebsch, New York, 1915-1925). The\r\nintroductions are informing and the translations are clear and strong.\r\nIn the series are included several Social and Domestic Plays as well\r\nas “Symbolic and Legendary Dramas.” _Parsival_, a play translated by\r\nOakley Williams, has an ethical or religious tone with sympathetic\r\ninsight into humanity. “Heartache” was the name of Parsival’s mother;\r\nsaid her creator, “I should hate to make anyone sad, but I believe we\r\nmight call every mother, at any rate, very, very, many mothers by this\r\nname.”[82] There are symbolism and poetic sermonizing in this drama of\r\nParsival, “Bearer of Burdens”; his development from a care-free youth\r\nto later responsibilities for world burdens is well portrayed. Traces\r\nof irony and humor are found. The setting of the play, _And Pippa\r\nDances_, is picturesque, in the Silesian mountains. Wann is a grotesque\r\nelement and the tales of “the Wild Huntsman” are entertaining; Pippa,\r\nthe fair-haired daughter of the glass blower, is the persuasive\r\ncharacter. There is a lack of dramatic unity in certain scenes.\r\nTranslations of this play, and of _Elga_, have been made by Mary Harned\r\nin _Poet Lore_ (Boston, 1906-1909). _And Pippa Dances_ is included in\r\nVolume V of the plays edited by Mr. Lewisohn.\r\n\r\nAmong interesting, intensive studies of Hauptmann as dramatist, is\r\nthe thesis by Walter H. P. Trumbaeur, on _Gerhart Hauptmann and John\r\nGalsworthy; a Parallel_ (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,\r\n1917).[83] The parallelism is traced, with occasional excess of effort,\r\nbetween their careers, their themes, and certain plays like _Hannele_\r\nand _The Little Dream_, _Michael Kramer_ and _A Bit o’ Love_, and\r\n_The Weavers_ and _Strife_. Both dramatists, says the critic, seek to\r\nescape social bondage; both are vitally concerned in social problems;\r\nboth are realists temperamentally; both have a purpose to enlighten\r\nrather than to delight; both see moral values and, also, _the irony of\r\nthings_. Hauptmann is more interested in characters while Galsworthy’s\r\nmain interest lies in the _relations_ between characters. In both\r\nwriters, there is a strain of idealism, seeking _truth_, material and\r\nspiritual. Another interesting thesis is by Mary Ayres Quimby, on\r\n_Nature Background in the Dramas of Gerhart Hauptmann_ (University of\r\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia, 1918). Among later plays _A Winter Ballad_\r\nand _The Festival Play_ register the fearless assault of this dramatist\r\nupon vices and the exaltation of an idealism which is “union with\r\nNature.”\r\n\r\nThe best work of Hauptmann in fiction has been attracting attention\r\nand becoming familiar to English readers. _The Fool in Christ:\r\nEmanuel Quint_ has been translated by Thomas Seltzer (Huebsch, 1911);\r\n_Atlantis_, translated by Adele and Thomas Seltzer (1912), and\r\n_Phantom_ and _The Heretic of Soana_, both translated by Bayard Quincy\r\nMorgan (1922-1923). The characterizations are forceful, with humor that\r\nis sometimes broad and, again, subtle. Daring satire and exposition\r\nof modern social problems are qualities that arrest the interest of\r\nthe reader and attest the brilliant mind of the writer, in the recent,\r\nneo-romantic novel, _The Island of the Great Mother_, translated this\r\nyear by Willa and Edwin Muir (Huebsch). The leaders in this “Women’s\r\nState” are delineated with shrewd, ironical skill. Phaon, the solitary\r\n“masculine” on the island, passes through strange adventures before he\r\nreaches maturity and finds his “ideal woman.” In his keen, illumining\r\nanalysis of Hauptmann’s poetic plays, _Hannele_ and _The Sunken Bell_,\r\nin _A Study of the Modern Drama_ (New York, 1925), Barrett H. Clark\r\naccepts the statement of other critics that these are not “well-made\r\nplays,” but he finds in them the qualities which are high lights in\r\nthis writer’s masterpieces--“psychological interest, dramatic as\r\ndistinguished from purely lyrical poetry, a fairly well constructed\r\nplot and an atmosphere of beauty.”[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1910.\r\n\r\n[73] _Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Century_ by Georg Brandes, New\r\nYork, 1924.\r\n\r\n[74] _Gesammelte Werke_: Vol. III, p. 300, translated in _Creative\r\nSpirits of the Nineteenth Century_ (by Georg Brandes) by Rasmus B.\r\nAnderson, New York, 1924.

There\r\nwas hopeful speculation that the award might go to either Russia or\r\nAmerica, the two larger countries that have not yet been included.\r\nThere was, however, a new type of poetry and drama, and a writer of\r\nunique personality, that were attracting widespread interest--namely,\r\nthe mystical and symbolic plays by Maurice Maeterlinck. The\r\nannouncement that he was the winner for 1911 caused much pride to the\r\nlittle kingdom of Belgium. Maeterlinck wrote most of his plays in\r\nFrench so they gained readers more quickly than those of his Belgian\r\npredecessors and contemporaries. _On the Scent_, the drama by Charles\r\nVan Lerberghe, has been compared to Maeterlinck’s earlier work by\r\nBarrett H. Clark in _A Study of the Modern Drama_.[86] Other Belgian\r\nplaywrights commended by Mr. Clark are Henri Maubel and Edmond Picard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of Dodd, Mead & Co._\r\n\r\nMAURICE MAETERLINCK]\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck was not quite fifty years old when the Nobel honor came to\r\nhim. He was born in Ghent, in 1862, of good ancestry. He recalled the\r\nsurroundings of his early life--the gardens and the sea and the ships\r\nin sight. Especially was he interested in the Flemish peasants as they\r\nsat, in quiet, stolid attitudes, in the doorways of their cottages\r\nor by the smoking lamps. One group impressed his boyhood memory, as\r\nhe saw them on his way from school--seven toothless brothers and a\r\nsister. Their lethargy and inert lives awakened him, in young manhood,\r\nto psychological curiosity; their strange traditions and unreasoning\r\nfears are reflected in some of his plays. His father was anxious to\r\nhave him study law, so he read and practised for a little time in\r\nGhent--long enough “to lose a case or two,” he said with humorous\r\nreminiscence. He spent seven years at a Jesuit College, and showed a\r\nmind of philosophical trend. He thought that in Paris he might come\r\ninto contact with men of literary rank and scholars. Villiers was\r\nhis especial influence there; another inspirational friend was Octave\r\nMirabeau to whom Maeterlinck dedicated his first published plays,\r\n_Princess Maleine_ and _Pelléas and Mélisande_. In too extravagant\r\npraise Mirabeau hailed Maeterlinck as “the Belgian Shakespeare” and\r\nMaeterlinck became the victim of flattery, on one hand, and ridicule\r\non the other. He bore himself with calm dignity then as he has all his\r\nlife; his serene manner and low voice, in contrast with his muscular\r\nphysique, have been noted by many acquaintances.\r\n\r\nBefore the death of his father, in 1889, he returned to Belgium and\r\nlived there for seven years, continuing his studies of nature and\r\nmetaphysics, writing marionette plays, and more serious dramas, and\r\nmaking translations from authors of other tongues, including English,\r\nthat left impressions upon his mind. He declared that the three\r\nwriters who exerted the strongest influence during these formative\r\nyears were Emerson, Novalis, and Ruysbroeck, the medieval mystic whose\r\nwritings were translated by Maeterlinck when he was a student at the\r\nJesuit College. To visitors from America he delights to show his worn\r\ncopy of Emerson. In his collected studies, _On Emerson and Other\r\nEssays_, translated by Montrose J. Moses, he summarizes the Concord\r\nphilosopher’s thoughts about “the greatness of man’s spiritual nature,\r\nabout the forces of the soul.” In conclusion of his vital influence,\r\nhe writes: “Emerson has come to affirm simply this equal and secret\r\ngrandeur of our life. He has encompassed us with silence and with\r\nwonder. He has placed a shaft of light beneath the feet of the workman\r\nas he leaves the workshop. He has shown us all the powers of heaven and\r\nearth, at the same time intent on sustaining the threshold on which\r\ntwo neighbors speak of the rain that falls or the wind that blows. And\r\nabove these two passers-by who accost each other, he has made us see\r\nthe countenance of God who smiles with the countenance of God. He is\r\nnearer than any other to our common life. He is the most attentive,\r\nthe most assiduous, the most honest, the most scrupulous, and probably\r\nthe most human of guides. He is the sage of commonplace days, and\r\ncommonplace days are, in sum, the substance of our being.”[87]\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Maeterlinck returned to Paris and there he has made his home.\r\nHe refused to renounce his Belgian citizenship, however, that he might\r\nbecome a member of the French Academy; during the war he did valiant\r\nservice in many ways for his native country. In his home town to-day,\r\nand at Brussels, the visitor is told of Belgian pride in Maeterlinck;\r\nthe people say, “You know he has lived in Paris almost all his life but\r\nhe is a true patriot, just the same.” To the years in Belgium, between\r\n1889 and 1896, belong such plays as _The Blind_, _The Intruder_,\r\n_The Seven Princesses_, _Alladine and Palomides_ and _The Death of\r\nTintagiles_. It is a question whether he has surpassed, in dramatic\r\nvigor combined with mystic beauty, that play of earlier period,\r\n_Pelléas and Mélisande_. Like the story of _Paolo and Francesca_, which\r\nit resembles in theme, it has an appealing quality both on the stage\r\nand in the book. The tragic death of Mélisande, after the murder of her\r\nlover and the birth of her daughter, reflects a high-light of dramatic\r\npower. The lines are simple in diction, masterly in structure and\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nOne of the first translators of Maeterlinck into English was Richard\r\nHovey, the brilliant American poet who died in his prime. In two\r\ndecorative volumes, first issued in Chicago (Stone & Kimball) in\r\n1894-1896, he interpreted, as well as translated, these earlier plays\r\nalready cited. The Introduction in the first volume is informing\r\nfor all students of modern drama. Mr. Hovey defined Symbolism, as\r\ndistinguished from Realism and Expressionism; he joined with the name\r\nof Maeterlinck, such other exponents of Symbolism as Mallarmé, Gilbert\r\nParker, and Bliss Carman. Two traits distinguished the Belgian from\r\nother symbolists of his day, according to this interpreter--“the\r\npeculiarity of his technique, and the limitation of his emotional\r\nrange.” The use of reiteration is cited as a French characteristic\r\nfor effective emphasis. “The danger-border between the tragic and\r\nthe ridiculous” is a menace to Maeterlinck. More true of his earlier\r\nthan his later plays is another restriction noted by Mr. Hovey: “His\r\nmaster-tone is always terror--terror, too, of one type--that of the\r\nchurchyard.... He is the poet of the sepulchre, like Poe--as masterly\r\nin his own methods as Poe was in his, and destined, perhaps, to exert\r\nthe same wide influence.”[88] _Premonition_ plays a large part in the\r\nplays of Maeterlinck from _The Blind_ and _Home_ to _Joyzelle_.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, under the stimulus of literary associates and the comradeship\r\nof Georgette Le Blanc (the actress who became his wife), Maeterlinck\r\nwrote three plays that register his dramatic climax--_Joyzelle_, _Monna\r\nVanna_ (1903) and _The Blue Bird_ (1908). Probably, the last symbolic\r\ndrama was the primal cause of the Nobel award. The idealism, the\r\ndelicate fancy, the imaginative charm, the fascinating characters in\r\nevery scene, real or fantastic, and the pervasive message for every\r\nage and land, give to this play a perennial appeal. As Maeterlinck\r\naffirmed, this play, like others of the type, may lose some of its\r\n“mystic transparency” and symbolism on the stage but it has been\r\nalluring both as acted play and as a film. Why there should have been\r\n“a sequel” to such a perfect, complete play as _The Blue Bird_ is a\r\nquestion that has troubled many a critic. Resentment against _The\r\nBetrothal_, the continuance of this fairy-tale play, however, gives way\r\nbefore appreciation of its fine passages and strong message. At the\r\nsame time, the impression lingers that Tyltyl, like Peter Pan, should\r\n“never have grown up.” Alexander Teixeira de Mattos has made a fine\r\ntranslation of _The Betrothal_ and Edith Wynne Mattison was a charming\r\n“Fairy Berylune,” when the play was given in New York. Here Maeterlinck\r\nventured almost too near the borderland between fantasy and farce,\r\nespecially in Act II, where the girls, who would marry Tyltyl, reveal\r\ntheir lower natures.\r\n\r\nThe versatility of Maeterlinck is evidenced by comparing such plays,\r\nwithin ten years, as _Joyzelle_ and _The Blue Bird_, _Monna Vanna_\r\nand _Mary Magdalene_. _Joyzelle_ has elements of dramatic ecstasy\r\nwith a tragic undertone. Professor William Lyon Phelps has summarized\r\nwell the salient qualities of this play and its heroine in _Essays on\r\nModern Dramatists_ (New York, 1921). _Monna Vanna_, written especially\r\nfor Maeterlinck’s wife, is a rare blend of intense emotionalism and\r\nconvincing characters with a crisis which challenges the reason.\r\nGiovanna, or Monna Vanna, wife of Guido Colonna, commander of the\r\ngarrison at Pisa, will remain as Maeterlinck’s most vital heroine.\r\nPrinzivalle, general of the Florentines and her boyhood lover, is an\r\nidealized hero for his age but convincing in his chivalry. Medieval\r\natmosphere and dramatic action accentuate the strong dialogue of this\r\nplay. Ten years later, in 1913, appeared _Mary Magdalene_. In his\r\nIntroduction, Maeterlinck relates, with some feeling, his effort to\r\nwin cordial response from Paul Heyse, who had written a play on the\r\nsame theme and with certain situations that the Belgian wished to\r\nuse. Meeting with a refusal, “none too courteous I regret to say,”\r\nhe decided to take his privilege of using Biblical words and his\r\npreviously conceived situation. He gives to Mary Magdalene a few\r\nmasterly lines; to Joseph of Arimathea, she says, “We save those whom\r\nwe love; we listen to them afterwards.” To the Roman Verus, who would\r\nhave her save Jesus by yielding herself to him, she replies: “I should\r\nperhaps sin against all that he loves, to save what I love. I could\r\nsave him in spite of himself; but no longer in spite of myself. If I\r\nbought his life at the price which you offer, all that he wished, all\r\nthat he loved, would be dead. I cannot plunge the flame into the mire\r\nto save the lamp.”[89]\r\n\r\nThe war left deep scars upon Maeterlinck’s spirit; they are reflected\r\nin such essays and plays as _The Wrack of the Storm_, _Belgium at\r\nWar_, _The Burgomaster at Stilemonde_, _The Cloud that Lifted_, and\r\n_The Power of the Dead_. Some of the essays, or chapters, in the\r\nbook first mentioned, deal with psychometry, the interest which is\r\nexpanded in other books like _The Great Secret_, _Our Eternity_, _The\r\nUnknown Guest_, and _The Light Beyond_. That man is the product of\r\nunseen forces, that he is molded by “hidden powers,” that humanity\r\nand nature are always closely linked, were tenets that underlay such\r\nbooks as _Treasure of the Humble_, _Life and Flowers_, and _The Life\r\nof the Bee_. He became a beekeeper that he might study at first-hand\r\nthe traits of these workers and apply their analogy to humanity--much\r\nas Dallas Lore Sharp has done more recently in _The Spirit of the\r\nHive_. In the beehives and the garden, Maeterlinck finds the same\r\ncomplications and conflicts, the same “domination of the spirit of the\r\nrace,” as among men. In an essay in his earlier book, _Treasure of the\r\nHumble_, he expressed a surety which has been verified with the passing\r\nof the years: “A time may come perhaps--and many things herald its\r\napproach--a time will come, perhaps, when our souls will know each\r\nother without the intermediary of the senses.”\r\n\r\nTo penetrate beyond the tangible things of life requires courage but\r\nbrings light to the spirit. In his plays, _Ariadne and Blue Beard_\r\nand _Sister Beatrice_, translated by Bernard Miall into English verse\r\n(1916), and _The Miracle of Saint Anthony_, translated by Alexander\r\nTeixeira de Mattos (1918), Maeterlinck has suggested the neglected but\r\nmagic “key” which may gain for us new adventures into “the prohibitions\r\nof the tangible world.” The _premonition_ of his earlier plays has\r\nbecome the _intuition_ which penetrates the unknown and supernatural.\r\nLife has been symbolized by him as “a garden,” as an “inner temple,” as\r\nanalogous to the world of plants and “the swarm” of the bees. He seldom\r\nreveals passionate feeling in his writings, but he exemplifies search\r\nfor truth, “care for moral stoic beauty.”[90] Intuition, as interpreted\r\nby Bergson, he has expanded into the “raison mystique” by which one\r\nmay penetrate the unknown and the mystic. There are shades of gloom\r\nand sadness in many of his plays; his characters are sometimes weak in\r\nconflict with the forces about them; there are hints of fatalism in\r\nplays like _The Intruder_, _The Death of Tintagiles_, and _Interior_,\r\nbut the keynote of Maeterlinck, in his maturity, has been that of\r\nspiritual progress and mystic idealism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1911.\r\n\r\n[86] New York, 1925, p. 161.\r\n\r\n[87] _On Emerson and Other Essays_ by Maurice Maeterlinck, translated\r\nby Montrose J.

Thus, for the second time, the honor\r\ncame to Great Britain through the writings of one whose formative\r\nyears, like those of Kipling, had been spent in India and whose typical\r\nwritings were associated with that country. On the contrary, the\r\nwords and thoughts of this mystic-poet are so exotic, sometimes so\r\nunlocalized in form and spirit, that they belong to world literature,\r\nrather than to a distinctive country. Possibly no other prize winner\r\nhas been so idealistic, so international in his appeal as this author\r\nof _The Gardener_, _Sadhana_, and _The King of the Dark Chamber_.\r\n\r\nIn his biographical study,[92] Ernest Rhys suggests that the award was\r\ngiven to Tagore because of the enthusiasm of a Swedish Orientalist\r\nfor his writings before they were known in English. The year before\r\nthe award, however, Yeats had praised the poems of Tagore[93] and\r\nother poet-critics had found him an inspirational influence. To the\r\nwinner, the announcement gave mingled gratitude and regret; the latter\r\nhe expressed in his sentence, “They have taken away my refuge.”[94]\r\nHis life had been so untouched by external struggles that he was, in\r\ntruth, “a child of Nature.” In _My Reminiscences_, he writes: “From\r\nmy earliest years I enjoyed a simple and intimate communion with\r\nNature. Each one of the cocoanut trees in our garden had for me a\r\ndistinct personality.... On opening my eyes every morning, the blithely\r\nawakening world used to call me to join it like a playmate.”[95]\r\n\r\nBorn in Calcutta, May 6, 1861, he came into a rare inheritance for\r\nhis later work as religious leader and writer. Like all children of\r\nthe higher social classes in India, he was environed from his birth\r\nwith poetic atmosphere. His blessing, as a newborn babe, was spoken\r\nin verse; as he grew older many of his studies were in poetic form.\r\nThe family name was Thakur, Anglicized into Tagore; his father and\r\ngrandfathers had been identified with education and civil reforms. Raja\r\nSir Sourindra Mohun Tagore was founder of the Bengal Music School;\r\nanother, Abanindranath Tagore, was a noted painter and leader in\r\nart-movements. His father might have been a Maharaja (a great king) but\r\nhe preferred to be Maharshi (a great sage), thus he was more closely\r\nlinked with the people than with nobility. He insisted upon paying\r\ndebts which his father, a prince, had left. He would have made himself\r\na pauper but the creditors refused to accept such sacrifices, so he had\r\na certain amount of property. He devoted himself to spiritual teachings\r\nand traveled through India on such missions, gaining the respect of all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y._\r\n\r\nRABINDRANATH TAGORE]\r\n\r\nThe son who won this Nobel prize was the youngest in a family of seven\r\nbrothers and three sisters. He was lonely as a child, for his mother\r\ndied when he was young and he was often left with men-servants for\r\ndays. The return of his father marked the “gala-days”--_his_ presence\r\npervaded the whole house. Nature was the boy’s comrade and he would\r\noften dig with a bamboo stick in the ground to find any possible\r\n“mysteries.” Perfumes affected his senses and left vivid memories, as\r\nhe tells in his _Reminiscences_. The school life, after he was six\r\nyears, was a brief period of unhappiness. He was, perhaps, stubborn to\r\na degree and was ranked as the lowest in his class because he refused\r\nto answer orally, but he thought out problems so well, in written work,\r\nthat he amazed his teachers and was given first place. The Oriental\r\nSeminary, the Normal School, the Bengal Academy--all seemed to him\r\n“prison-houses.” At home he studied, with a tutor, history, sciences,\r\nand English literature. At first, he laughed, somewhat scornfully, at\r\nEnglish poetry because of the unusual sounds.\r\n\r\nAn influence of this formative age was his nephew--older than he was,\r\nJyotiprokash, who read _Hamlet_ to the lad and urged him to write\r\nverses and poetic imaginings. He saw a future for this boy with his\r\nfancies and love of Nature. A teacher at the Normal School, also,\r\ninspired him to write, asking him to complete lines or stanzas which\r\nhad been begun by another. Although his father was often separated from\r\nthe boy, he realized the child’s promise and his sensitive nature;\r\nhe gave him a vacation trip into the Himalayas, stopping at Bolpur,\r\nthe Peace Cottage, where his father often retired and where the son\r\nwas to have his own home later. In his “blue blank-book,” that he\r\ncarried always with him, were written poems suggested by scenery and\r\nincidents of this trip. His father taught him botany and astronomy, as\r\nwell as English, Sanskrit, and Bengali. Back in Calcutta he “played\r\ntruant from school,” sometimes, and caused his older sister to write\r\nin despair of the fulfillment of their hopes for him; that he would be\r\n“the only unsuccessful man in the family.”[96] For a year he went to\r\nLondon to study law but he was homesick and returned to Bengal.\r\n\r\nIn his _Reminiscences_ at fifty, he recalled the years between sixteen\r\nand twenty-three as those of unrest and “extreme wildness.” He was the\r\nvictim of the impulses of strong, young manhood; for a time he was an\r\nepicure rather than a mystic. He delighted in silk robes and luscious\r\nfoods and romances in love. An expression of this time may be found\r\nin the poem, “The Gleaming Vision of Youth,” in _The Gardener_. Other\r\nreflections are in _Sandhya Sangit_ and _The Songs of Sunrise_, more\r\nphilosophical. Two poems, “The Eternity of Life” and “The Eternity\r\nof Death,” indicate the period of transition from this time to the\r\nyears of religious meditation. At twenty-three he married happily; at\r\nthe request of his father, he went to oversee the family estate at\r\nShilaida, on the Ganges. Here, with intervals of travel, he remained\r\nfor seventeen years, living close to the people and to Nature, and\r\nwriting some of his tales and poems. One of his most famous love\r\npoems, showing mingled sensuous and spiritual strains, is “The Beloved\r\nat Noon and in the Morning.”\r\n\r\nIn a house boat on the Padma he often spent hours of meditation, long\r\nevenings of reverie, that were pictured in the background of his\r\nidyllic song, “Golden Bengal.” He studied the poverty, trials, and\r\nsimple idealism of the people; he knew elementary medicine and cared\r\nfor the sick; he was saddened by the loss of rice crops in destructive\r\nrains; he was determined that tenants should not suffer unduly from\r\ntax-gatherers. He brought upon himself the jealous criticism of\r\nBritish magistrates in the district and was called a revolutionary\r\nand visionary disturber. He had already formulated his ideas of both\r\na small republic and the school at Bolpur when he was interrupted in\r\nhis plans by domestic sorrows. He journeyed to England and the United\r\nStates for recuperation and inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe first grief was the death of his wife for whom he had a deep\r\nlove. Within a few months his daughter died of tuberculosis. Shortly\r\nafterwards came another poignant sorrow in the loss of his youngest\r\nson. With the serenity of a mind that recognizes Nature as mother and\r\nfriend, he turned toward more intimate relations with spiritual and\r\nreligious thoughts. These are revealed especially in _Gitanjali_, the\r\nfirst book by which he became well known to English readers. It was\r\nwritten in English with vigor and grace, with distinctive structure.\r\nIn 1912-13 he came to the United States, partly for a change of\r\nscene, partly to add to his knowledge of industrial improvements and\r\nagricultural equipment, that he might apply this information in his\r\nschool at Bolpur. His older son was with him, to learn methods of\r\nharvesting. In his biographical study of Tagore, Basanta Koomar Roy[97]\r\ntells interesting facts about the visit to this poet and discussion,\r\nwith him, of the possibilities that he might win the Nobel prize. He\r\nwas then at Urbana, Illinois, with his son. He was impressed with the\r\nsunshine of our climate--“enchanted American days” he called them. He\r\nliked the superior engineering and business abilities of Americans but\r\nhe deplored their lack of culture. He was urged to translate more of\r\nhis writings into English and was assured that, should he win the Nobel\r\nprize, it would increase international brotherhood and world peace, as\r\nwell as raise India among the nations. Sceptical of the probability\r\nhe said, should it come to him, he would use the money to start an\r\nindustrial department in his school at Bolpur.\r\n\r\nTen months later the award was made to Tagore. Some of his compatriots\r\nwere his most severe critics, complaining that he “dabbled” in too\r\nmany forms of literature. He admitted the charge but averred that\r\npoetry represented “the deep truth” of his life. As a poet he has\r\nrevived the work, in kind, of the Vaishnava poets of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries, of mystic writers like the Upanishads who lived\r\nbetween 2000 and 1000 B. C. He adapted the beauties of these poets to\r\nmodern interpretation. He was indebted, also, to Kabir, the mystic of\r\nthe fifteenth century, and to Ramprosad of Bengal, of the eighteenth.\r\nIn his form and spiritual progress he has shown marked originality,\r\nfollowing the work of Bengalese like Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Bankim,\r\nwho had cleared away many obstacles of British domination over native\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the school at Bolpur to which, true to his\r\npromise, he has devoted funds from his award. In his essays, _Sadhana,\r\nor the Realization of Life_, are found several of the “student\r\naddresses” made here; the war caused changed conditions and frustrated\r\nsome of the founder’s hopes. This school was started in 1902, approved\r\nby his father, and with the goal, “To revive the spirit of our ancient\r\nsystem of education ... to make the students feel that there is a\r\nhigher and a nobler thing in life than practical efficiency.” At first,\r\nsuch a venture met with curiosity and some scorn. Parents sent here\r\nunmanageable or backward boys. They had simple surroundings and lived\r\nand slept outdoors; they sang chants as the birds begin their morning\r\nsongs; they had time for individual prayer and thought, clad in white\r\nsilk robes. They enjoyed games and long walks, simple food, no wine or\r\nmeat, music in the evening and plays, written by Rabindranath Tagore;\r\nthey wrote and illustrated school papers. There was self-government and\r\nclose, brotherly relations between boys and teachers. Their scholastic\r\nwork became satisfactory to the University at Calcutta. The boys were\r\nhappy, often refusing to go home for their vacations, unless compelled\r\nto do so by their parents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work as educator for boys, Rabindranath Tagore has\r\nbeen a strong influence for more training and freedom for the women\r\nof India. He believes that the life of woman, in a generic sense,\r\nis more full and harmonious than that of man. He found the ideas of\r\nboth Hindu teachers and Christian missionaries were extreme, as he\r\nviewed them, but he advocated education and broadened opportunities.\r\nAs an Oriental he has poetized the love of the home, the coming of\r\nthe woman at the end of the day, “with a pitcher of nectar,” to bring\r\ncomfort to the home. His poetic play, _Chitra_, much discussed and\r\npuzzling in passages to a Western mind, is a frank exposition of\r\nhis philosophy regarding the sensuous and spiritual qualities of\r\nwomen. Other expressions are in _The Home and the World_ (1919) and\r\n_Personality_ (1917) and in plays like _Sanyas_, and _The King and the\r\nQueen_ (in _Sacrifice and Other Plays_, New York, 1917). That he is a\r\nlover of children, and able to interpret their thoughts and fancies\r\nwith unmatched beauty, is evident to all readers of Sir Rabindranath\r\nTagore’s writings (he was knighted in 1915). His own simplicity of\r\nnature and life, his imagination in its purity and freedom, make him\r\nan intimate comrade for boys and girls. The year after he received the\r\nNobel prize, the original, unrhymed poems, _The Crescent Moon_, were\r\ntranslated, with effective illustrations in color. _Stray Birds_, with\r\nfrontispiece in color by Willy Pogany (1921), is another appealing and\r\ntypical book, but more mature and philosophical.\r\n\r\nThe periods of childhood, from babyhood to school days and\r\nletter-writing, are unfolded in _The Crescent Moon_ in delightful\r\npictures. Especially intuitive are “Baby’s World,” “Paper Boats,” “The\r\nLittle Big Man,” and “The First Jasmines.” Humor enlivens many of\r\nthese fancies and questions of the child, as in “Twelve O’Clock” and\r\n“Authorship”; the latter raises a query--_why_ the mother allows father\r\nto waste “heaps of paper” without a protest, while a single sheet,\r\ntaken for a paper boat, may bring a remonstrance to the child. There\r\nis emotional beauty and Oriental philosophy in “The Beginning.” “Where\r\nhave I come from?” asks the child, and the mother:\r\n\r\n    She answered half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to\r\n      her breast,--\r\n    You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling....\r\n    In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother\r\n      you have lived.\r\n    In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been\r\n      nursed for ages....\r\n    As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all\r\n      have become mine.[98]\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve years since the Nobel award, Tagore has translated\r\nseveral of his earlier poems, plays and tales and has written _My\r\nReminiscences_, one of the most illumining autobiographies of the\r\nlast decade. He has expanded his ideas on government, education and\r\nreligion in books like _Nationalism_ and _Creative Unity_. He has\r\nwritten _Prayers for Mother India_--that she may be raised from her\r\nchronic want to a place of influence and success. He has urged united\r\naction by the people of England and those of India to bring about this\r\nmaterial union. He has said, “One section of the human race cannot\r\nbe permanently strong by depriving another section of its inherent\r\nrights.” Taking as his text that mooted line from Kipling,\r\n\r\n    Oh, East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet--\r\n\r\nTagore said, at a banquet in London: “I have learned that, though our\r\ntongues are different and our habits dissimilar, at the bottom of our\r\nhearts we are one.... East is East and West is West--God forbid that it\r\nshould be otherwise--but the twain must meet in amity, peace and mutual\r\nunderstanding; their meeting will be all the more fruitful because of\r\ntheir differences; it must lead both to holy wedlock before the common\r\naltar of Humanity.”\r\n\r\nIn the sympathetic, analytical study of _Mahatma Gandhi_ by Romain\r\nRolland, there are some excellent sentences of comparison of these\r\ntwo religious leaders of modern India. “Tagore looked upon Gandhi as\r\na saint,” says M. Rolland, and he deplored his political activities,\r\nespecially his non-coöperation doctrine. Tagore seeks and finds harmony\r\nin coöperation. He wrote, “My prayer is that India may represent the\r\ncoöperation of all the peoples of the world. For India, unity is truth,\r\nand division evil.” In summary, the French writer says, “To my mind\r\nGandhi is as universal as Tagore, but in a different way. Gandhi is a\r\nuniversalist through his religious feeling; Tagore is intellectually\r\nuniversal. While venerating him, (Gandhi) we understand and approve\r\nTagore.”[99] In _Creative Unity_, Tagore has included an essay upon\r\n“The Nation” in which he stresses “the fight” to-day between “the\r\nliving spirit of the people” and the methods of organizing nations.\r\n\r\nIf one were to prophesy which type of Sir Rabindranath Tagore’s\r\nwritings will survive among many peoples, the chances are in favor of\r\nhis mystical prose-poems and his national songs. The latter have kept\r\nalive the love of home-country and faith in India. They are sung by\r\nboatmen on the Ganges, by the peasants in the fields, by students and\r\ngroups at all kinds of festivals and conferences. These songs are of\r\ntwo kinds; one is a wistful idealization of the “Motherland,” with\r\ngraphic pictures of scenery, homes, and religion; the second type is\r\nthe “Song of Consecration,” of sacrifice and valor, exampled in “Follow\r\nthe Gleam,” to which many young Nationalists have marched and died.\r\nBitterness is absent from nearly every line by this poet-patriot; there\r\nis spiritual excitation, strong appeal to love of home and broader\r\nidealism. It has been said that contradiction is evident between some\r\nof these national songs and the broad humanism of many other writings,\r\nnotably those in the _Gitanjali_. Those who know the man personally,\r\nand who are familiar with the tenets of Hindu philosophy which he\r\nembodies, as well as the spiritual ideals of the Upanishads, do not\r\nfind it difficult to reconcile the two creeds, as he has united them in\r\nhis “Ode to the Earth” and some of the essays in _Sadhana_.\r\n\r\nWhile it is gratifying to note that Rabindranath Tagore, as prize\r\nwinner, found incentive to write more idealistic literature, yet it is\r\nevident that he never has surpassed the earlier books of distinctive\r\nquality, books that maintained the classic traditions of his native\r\nliterature but gave them new form and significance, as _The Gardener_,\r\n_The Post Office_, _King of the Dark Chamber_, _Gitanjali_, and _The\r\nElder Sister_. When he was in the United States he read, at colleges\r\nand other places, many passages from _The Gardener_ and _Gitanjali_.\r\nThe two books have similar tone and melody; both are difficult to\r\ntranslate into adequate English because much of the mysticism is lost\r\nin concrete words--the same is true of his plays when they are staged\r\nwithout sustaining the “illusion” of the Oriental atmosphere. In native\r\nlanguage the rhythm and music surpass and interpret the words; the\r\nswaying movement accompanies many odes and invocations. A song that may\r\nbe chanted with the music of the flute, and thus appreciated, is one of\r\nthe mystical lyrics beginning:\r\n\r\n    I am restless, I am athirst for far-away things,\r\n    My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirts of the dim\r\n      distance.\r\n    O Great Beyond, O the keen call of my flute!\r\n    I forget, I ever forget, that I have no wings, that I am bound in\r\n      this spot, evermore.[100]\r\n\r\n_Gora_, a so-called “novel” by Rabindranath Tagore, has been issued\r\nthis current year. It tells the story of a Hindu youth, a Brahmin,\r\nwhose full name is Gourmohan Babu. He cherishes a large-souled\r\nambition to “unify” India but he cannot break down the barriers of his\r\nreligious fanaticism enough to consent to the marriage of his younger\r\nbrother, Binoy Babu, to a girl of a lower Brahmin caste. The romantic\r\ninterest vibrates from the love affairs of Gora to that of his brother.\r\nThe chief merit of the book is not its art as fiction, for that is\r\nnegative, but the graphic presentation of religious tenets and native\r\ncustoms. The author seems, at times, to be seriously concerned about\r\nthe development of his hero and the more tolerant brother; in other\r\nplaces, he introduces an element of whimsical humor and kindly irony\r\nas in the unexpected sequel of Gora’s parentage. Poetry and essays or\r\nshort tales, rather than fiction of long-sustained plot, are the forms\r\nof writing best adapted to his gifts.\r\n\r\nAs _The Gardener_ represents the youth of Rabindranath Tagore, with\r\nnormal desires fused with spiritual longings, so _Gitanjali_ is the\r\nexpression of the mature philosopher-poet, still responsive emotionally\r\nbut seeking for “joy eternal.” He has preserved for world literature,\r\nthe philosophy and poetry of earlier teachers like Chaitanya Deva,\r\nusually called “Nimäi,” the Hindu poet, who lived near Bolpur, the home\r\nof Tagore. In addition to these revivals of the earlier tenets and\r\naspirations in poetry, Rabindranath Tagore has become an international\r\nhumanist. He has never lost his joy in Nature and in solitude but\r\nhe has walked forward into the vision of a united brotherhood and a\r\nspiritual commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1913.\r\n\r\n[92] _Rabindranath Tagore_ by Ernest Rhys, New York, 1915.\r\n\r\n[93] _Gitanjali_, with Introduction by W.

The\r\nannouncement that the winner for 1915 was Romain Rolland, author of\r\n_Jean-Christophe_, was generally approved. Here was an instance when\r\na single book had focussed attention of readers and the judges; this\r\nmasterpiece, which had appeared in France at intervals from 1904 to\r\n1912, had been translated into many languages and much discussed. It\r\nwas a mirror of the conditions of society, especially in France and\r\nGermany at the junction of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; it\r\nwas an exhaustive, vital life story of a musician with aspirations,\r\nstruggles, loves, defeats, revolts, friendships, and tragic, but\r\ntriumphant, end. In the biography of Rolland by Stefan Zweig, emphasis\r\nis laid upon the period of nearly fifty years of the author’s life\r\nas a quiet scholar and musician, “an artist working without serious\r\ninterruption or serious recognition,” and then a sudden, disturbing\r\npublicity which followed in the wake of this novel.[102]\r\n\r\nClamecy, a little town of the Morvan on the Nivernais canal, was the\r\nbirthplace of Romain Rolland, January 29, 1866. His father was a\r\nnotary; his mother was daughter of a magistrate; she was musical and\r\nreligious, devoted to her son and the younger child, Madelaine. Their\r\nhappy home life is reflected in pages of the section, “Antoinette,”\r\nin _Jean-Christophe_. When he was young, Romain Rolland showed taste\r\nfor music and his mother taught him and told him stories about great\r\nmusicians. When his school days ended at the Communal College in his\r\nnative town, his father, with rare self-sacrifice, gave up his law\r\npractice in Clamecy and went to Paris, becoming clerk in a bank that\r\nthe boy might be educated in the best schools. After attendance at\r\nthe Lycée Louis-le-Grand until he was twenty, he entered the Ecole\r\nNormale Supérieure where he specialized in history. Gabriel Monod was\r\na teacher of surpassing influence over the minds and characters of his\r\nstudents. Rolland was enthusiastic about Tolstoy, both as reformer\r\nand writer.[103] For Shakespeare he had ardent admiration, especially\r\nfor the historical plays and sonnets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of Henry Holt & Co._\r\n\r\nROMAIN ROLLAND]\r\n\r\nAnother friend of these tentative years was Paul Claudel, the author of\r\nbooks with mystical tendencies upon the history of Catholicism. Already\r\nRolland had expressed a fugitive, recurrent wish to write a romance,\r\n“the history of a single-hearted artist who bruises himself against\r\nthe rocks of life.” Such was the norm of _Jean-Christophe_. He was\r\nsurprised, and not wholly pleased, when he was told that he had won a\r\ntraveling scholarship from the Normal School and could go to the French\r\nSchool of Archeology and History at Rome. For two years he stayed in\r\nthis city, making contacts with some of the vital influences of his\r\nlife, notably the friendship with Fräulein Malwida von Meysenburg;\r\nshe was many years his senior but still alert and inspiring. She knew\r\nintimately scores of statesmen, writers, and artists, as references\r\nin her book, _Mémoires d’une idéaliste_, testify. She took a profound\r\ninterest in this young Frenchman with his musical gifts and visionary\r\nhopes. In his essay, “To the Undying Antigone,” Rolland speaks of his\r\ngratitude to two women--his mother and Fräulein von Meysenburg. With\r\nthe latter he went to visit Wagner at Bayreuth and increased his\r\nmusical enthusiasm and knowledge. One day, as he was walking on the\r\nJaniculum, the germ-idea and plan of his epic novel, _Jean-Christophe_,\r\nformed in his mind but its writing was delayed for many years.\r\n\r\nBack in Paris as lecturer at the Normal School, and at the Sorbonne,\r\nhe determined to attack indifference to the fine arts. His thesis\r\nhad a title of arresting words for that time, “The Origins of the\r\nModern Lyrical Drama.” While in Rome he had written a few plays that\r\nwere not made public, _Orsino_, _Caligula_, and _Niobe_. He was eager\r\nto increase interest in music at the Normal School and elsewhere.\r\nHe attended musical festivals at Bonn and Strasburg and began that\r\nseries of biographies published later as _Musicians of Former Days_,\r\n_Musicians of Today_, _Beethoven_, _Handel_, and other volumes. He\r\nmarried the daughter of Michael Bréal, the philologist, at whose home\r\nhe met noted men of letters, science, and art. His wife was cultured\r\nand sympathetic with his aspirations to extend knowledge of music and\r\nart among the people. He rebelled against educational restrictions,\r\nas well as political reactions; in such moods he wrote plays such as\r\n_Danton_, _Fourteenth of July_, _Triumph of Reason_, and _Saint Louis_,\r\na heroic legend. He urged popularizing of the theatre and lamented the\r\ndominance of “the aristocratic theatre.” Some of the articles which he\r\nwrote at different times on this theme have been translated by Barrett\r\nH. Clark as _The People’s Theatre_ (New York, 1918). He looked to the\r\ntheatre as beneficial to the people in three ways: “(1) as a source of\r\njoy; (2) as a source of energy; (3) as a source of guiding light to the\r\nintelligence.”\r\n\r\nBefore Rolland had really “found himself” in literature, the Dreyfus\r\ncase racked his sensitive soul. In almost all his later writings there\r\nare references, direct or implied, to this “welter of feeling” which\r\ndivided families and shattered friendships. At the time of the trial\r\nhe wrote, “He who can see injustice without trying to combat it,\r\nis neither entirely an artist nor entirely a man.”[104] He wrote a\r\ndramatic parable, _Les Loups_ (_Wolves_) under the pseudonym of “Saint\r\nJust,” in which he lifted “the problem from the realm of time into\r\nthat of the eternal.” As the political strife became more personal\r\nand bitter, Rolland retired from public attention and devoted himself\r\nto writing lives of artists like _Michael Angelo_ and _Millet_ and\r\nmusicians. He contributed the first chapters of _Jean-Christophe_ to\r\nthe literary magazine, _Cahiers de la Quinzaine_, known to students\r\n_only_ for many years. In two small rooms on the fifth floor of a\r\nParisian house, above the boulevard Montparnasse, Rolland wrote and\r\nread, seeing a few friends, taking walks, and playing the piano for\r\nrecreation. Outwardly, he was serene; inwardly, he was seething with\r\nindignation at the falsities and hypocrisy of life, at the disdain\r\nshown for spiritual values, at “the world dying of asphyxia in its\r\nprudent and vile egoism,” as he expressed it in _Jean-Christophe_.\r\n\r\nSlowly, without any aids of publicity, the real value of\r\n_Jean-Christophe_ became apparent to critics and discriminating\r\nreaders, as the last volumes appeared in the magazine. German\r\njournalists called attention to its unique merits. Paul Seippel,\r\nthe Swiss writer, related the life and earlier work of Rolland. In\r\nJune, 1913, Rolland was given the Grand Prix of the French Academy.\r\nTranslation of _Jean-Christophe_ was made into English by Gilbert\r\nCannan and critics awakened. The same year Rolland republished some of\r\nthe plays written in his student days, under the title, _Les tragedies\r\nde la foi_; by examples of such heroes as “Saint Louis” and “Aërt,” he\r\nwould inspire the people of the twentieth century to a new idealism.\r\nHis play, _Wolves_, has been staged in Yiddish in New York, has been\r\ntranslated into English by Barrett H. Clark, and has been performed at\r\nthe University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nIn his epic story of a musician and his associates, Rolland was a\r\npreacher of aspiration and harmony to the whole world, in spite of\r\nlocalized atmosphere. He recalled the words of Goethe, “National\r\nliterature now means very little; the epoch of world literature is\r\nat hand”; and he urged, “Let us make Goethe’s prophecy a living\r\nreality.”[105] His hero was to have a long, circuitous journey in his\r\nsearch for expression of his aspirations; he was to meet many kinds\r\nof people and races; he was to have some of the tragic experiences\r\nof musicians of real life, Beethoven, Wagner, and Hugo Wolf; he was\r\nto keep aloft the banner of idealism, of faith in humanity. Like the\r\nauthor, he was to be victimized by the hard realities of life and\r\ndisillusionments. The book was to have many themes and varied notes but\r\nwas to be blended, at the last, into a perfect symphony. The preludes\r\nwere written in 1895-1897; the last chords were played in October,\r\n1912. Parts were written in France and Italy; others, in Switzerland\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nNo work of fiction of such prodigious length, totaling more than 1550\r\npages, in the three-volume edition translated by Gilbert Cannan, could\r\nbe written without many lapses, many passages of uneven merit. Some\r\nof the characters are vital and haunting to the memory, like Olivier,\r\nGrazia, Antoinette, Sabine, Jacqueline, Emmanuel, Dr. Braun, besides\r\nthe hero; others flit across the pages and are forgotten. Condensation\r\nof some chapters would add to their effectiveness but the author’s\r\ndiscursive, intuitive comments make a valuable asset of the book. It\r\nmay be reread in parts with enjoyment, just as a musical program, for\r\nan evening, has selected movements in a fugue or a symphony. When it\r\nwas suggested to Rolland that he seemed to show enmity towards Germany,\r\nby some of the reproaches of her false standards, his reply was, “I\r\nam not in the least an enemy of Germany”; in proof, he cited that he\r\nhad rated soundly as many faults in France, in Volume V, as he had in\r\nGermany in Volume IV. He contended that Germany had creative energy and\r\nmoral vigor but that she was “sick” in this twentieth century, just\r\nas France was diseased and needed to be purged to restore her noble\r\nqualities. Heroic souls are found in both countries but the people, as\r\na whole, fail to interpret each other aright. Unless such understanding\r\ncan be established in _friendship_, war will sunder the nations--such\r\nwas the prophetic message of _Jean-Christophe_ which was fulfilled two\r\nyears later. His book was intended as a “common heritage for all” of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nTime will fix the exact status of this epic novel and its lasting\r\ninfluence upon international thought. It may be classified as allegory,\r\nromance, psychological study, or idealistic vision; it has sincerity,\r\ninspiration, and imaginative intensity. The author’s statement that\r\nhe always thought of the life of his hero as analogous to a river, is\r\nsignificant; he sustains the imagery from the first Dawn, Morning,\r\nYouth, and Revolt in Germany to the very end of the journey “across the\r\nborder,” to the final act where “Saint Christopher” hears the roar of\r\nthe torrent but also, the “tranquil voice of the Child” as the Angelus\r\nsounds forth The New Day. Gilbert Cannan has compared the phases of\r\nlife, explored by _Jean-Christophe_, to the tortuous channel of an\r\nuncharted river. His judgment that this novel is “the first great book\r\nof the twentieth century,” is more stable than the prophecy of other\r\ncritics that would leave out the word “first.” It has many passages\r\nof artistic perfection, like “Antoinette,” “The House,” and “The New\r\nDawn.” With emotional fervor the author, in the closing volume, speaks\r\nhis message to the future, apostrophizing the young men; “You men of\r\ntoday, march over us, trample us under your feet, and press onward. Be\r\nye greater and happier than we.... Life is a succession of deaths and\r\nresurrections. We must die, Christophe, to be born again.”[106]\r\n\r\nAnd since the award, what has Romain Rolland written? _Colas\r\nBreugnon_, the tale of a Burgundian artist, translated in 1919 by\r\nKatherine Miller, is less intense, much more free and diverting than\r\nhis long novel. It was a work of relaxation for the author during\r\nthe summer months in Switzerland, 1913. He had recently visited his\r\nbirth town and modeled the hero, in part, from a resident, a wood\r\ncarver there, “an artist of the vanished type.” He has his struggles\r\nand defeats but he never loses his optimism. The next year the\r\nwar began, with its devastating, soul-searing effects upon Romain\r\nRolland. He had seen its black shadow and had forewarned the people\r\nin _Jean-Christophe_ but the actual conflict overwhelmed his spirit.\r\nLike Olivier, in his story (whom he resembles in many ways), he had\r\nfeared such a war from boyhood; it had been “a nightmare to him; it\r\nhad poisoned his childhood days.” He was at Vevey, on Lake Geneva,\r\nwhen the war broke out and he decided to stay there; he longed for\r\nFrance but he could not fight without blighting his soul. He would\r\nsuffer as a pacifist, loving his country, rather than yield to hate.\r\nHe did secretarial work for the Red Cross and assisted in welfare\r\nmeasures of many kinds. When the Nobel prize money came, he gave it “to\r\nthe mitigation of the miseries of Europe.”[107] He wrote some of the\r\npapers that were collected in _Above the Battle_; his friendly letter\r\nto Hauptmann, appealing for amity, and the German’s reply, are given\r\nhere. In spite of the aggressive tone of the German’s note, Rolland\r\nrefused to believe that the ideals of human brotherhood had been\r\ndestroyed; they were suffering eclipse temporarily but would relive\r\nin “The New Dawn.” To Woodrow Wilson, in the later months of the war,\r\nRolland made an appeal to “be the arbiter of the free peoples.” On\r\nthe day of the armistice he issued a manifesto, _L’Humanité_, a call\r\nto “brain workers,” comrades all through the world, to reconstruct\r\na fraternal union. The play, _The Montespan_, translated by Helena\r\nvan Brugh de Kay, is called a “sequel to _Above the Battle_.” He had\r\nwritten, during these days of seclusion and thought, his study and\r\nappreciation of _Mahatma Gandhi: the Man Who Became One with the\r\nUniversal Being_ (translated by Catherine D. Groth), which has been\r\nquoted in the previous chapter upon Rabindranath Tagore.\r\n\r\nAs relaxation, he wrote _Liluli_, a comedy with the “goddess of\r\nillusion” as its heroine. There are some lines of satire and some\r\nof burlesque, as the combatants wrestle. It was symbolic of France\r\nduring the war years, as _he_ viewed his country, scorning Truth and\r\nheaping up ruins of past greatness. This has been illustrated with\r\nthirty-two wood engravings by Frans Masereel (New York, 1920). While\r\nRolland was exercising his ironical wit upon this picture of war, he\r\nwas writing _Clerambault: the Story of an Independent Spirit during\r\nthe War_, a sad portrayal of a pacifist. This has been translated by\r\nKatherine Miller (New York, 1921). It is a dissertation more than\r\na story, a presentation of the author’s own sentiments, with much\r\nphilosophy about life and conflicts. The man, Clerambault, passes\r\nthrough strange spiritual experiences. The early scenes of his rural\r\nhome life, peaceful and happy, are contrasted with his fanaticism when\r\nhe reaches Paris and urges his son, Maxime, to enter the army; then\r\ncome reactions, after the death of the son and his own probings of\r\nconscience. The author interprets the tale as a tragedy for the man\r\nand his wife, but a triumph of freedom for his soul. There are many\r\nautobiographical touches in this psychological story.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 there appeared in Paris, from the pen of Rolland, the first\r\nvolumes of _L’âme enchantée_ which is now appearing in English\r\nversion, by Ben Ray Redman, as _Annette and Sylvie: The Prelude_ and\r\na second volume, _Summer_, translated by Eleanor Stimson and Van Wyck\r\nBrooks. In his Foreword the author tells his readers that they are\r\nstarting with him upon a new journey which will not be so long as\r\nthat of _Jean-Christophe_ but will include more than one stage. He\r\nasks suspension of judgment until the tale is finished, quoting the\r\nold adage, “La fin loue la vie, et le soir le jour.” He expresses the\r\ndomination that his characters gain over him--Jean, Colas, Annette--so\r\nthat he becomes no more “than the secretary of their thoughts.” No\r\nthesis nor theory is in this story but it is another life history,\r\nstruggling to find Truth, to reach harmony of spirit amid many kinds\r\nof buffetings and joys. Two girls, half sisters, Annette and Sylvie,\r\nafford him scope for sharp antitheses in character-drawing. Annette\r\nis a girl of fine health and brain, educated at the Sorbonne. She had\r\nadored her father but, because of some letters which she found after\r\nhis death, she realizes his infidelities to her mother and understands\r\nhis secretive smiles. She locates her half sister who never bore his\r\nname--Sylvie, pretty, uneducated, capricious, gay, unmoral. The deep\r\npassions of Annette, her reserves and independence, her repugnance to\r\nany “possessiveness” on the part of her lover, Roger Brissot, and his\r\nfamily, lead to a scene of erotic realism. This is followed by words of\r\nthe author’s own creed, his Search for Truth: “I am not one of those\r\nwho fear the fatigues of the road.... I am seeking.... I am convinced\r\nthat it is possible to love one’s child, loyally perform one’s domestic\r\ntask, and still keep enough of oneself, as one ought to--for the most\r\nessential thing ... one’s soul.”[108] The second volume reveals the\r\nmaterial and spiritual conflicts of Annette, as a mother and teacher,\r\nand Sylvie’s experiences in marriage and business.\r\n\r\nIn his latest book, as in his earlier plays and fiction, M. Rolland\r\nhas revealed that idealism which, in his philosophy, means harmony and\r\nfreedom, of both aspiration and action. His form is often careless\r\nand sometimes crude; but it has high lights of great beauty and\r\ntrue art. In his own life he has waged many battles that have left\r\nscars upon his sensitive temperament and fine soul. They have never\r\nshattered his spiritual creed, his faith in humanity. He has written\r\nardently in behalf of international friendship and intellectual unity.\r\nIn the future he may be ranked as a prophet as well as a scholar,\r\na seer as well as a writer. Amid the turmoil of his generation he\r\nhas been a force, making for peace; he has held high the banner of\r\nworld-fellowship and sounded the challenge against racial jealousies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1915.\r\n\r\n[102] _Romain Rolland: the Man and His Work_ by Stefan Zweig,\r\ntranslated by Eden and Cedar Paul, New York, 1921.

By public, competitive vote of his\r\ncountrymen he had been chosen as the most popular poet before he was\r\naccorded this world honor. He is less familiar, by translation in\r\nEnglish, than his compatriot who preceded him in recognition by the\r\nSwedish Academy, Selma Lagerlöf. His plays, novels, and poems are\r\ngaining new appreciation through the translations in recent years by\r\nCharles Wharton Stork, Arthur J. Chater, and Karoline M. Knudsen. He\r\nwas born of aristocratic family at the manor house of Olshammar in\r\nNärke, July 6, 1859. As a boy he was never strong; he was shy and\r\nloved to read, especially poetry and hero stories. When he was in\r\nearly adolescence, he developed such a condition that lung-disease was\r\nfeared and he was sent to the south of Europe for a milder climate.\r\nFor eight years he was away from Sweden, spending time in Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt. Some of his ancestors had\r\nbeen in governmental positions in the Orient; he was lured by the\r\npicturesqueness and freedom of these lands.\r\n\r\nHis first ambition was to be a painter; for a time he was a student\r\nof Gêrome in Paris. Critics have often recognized this quality of\r\nthe painter’s skill in his poems, in selection of objects and colors\r\nand in reproduction of life in Paris, in Italian carnival days, and\r\nat Damascus. While Heidenstam was still a young man, he fell in love\r\nwith a Swiss girl of the people and married her. At an old castle of\r\nBrunegg, estranged for a time from his parents, he lived in seclusion,\r\nseeing few people except his wife and August Strindberg who had become\r\ndeeply interested in the young poet. Already he had decided that\r\nliterature, not art, must be his profession. He wrote many poems that\r\nwere gathered later as _Pilgrimages and Wander-Years_. In _Thoughts in\r\nLoneliness_ one may read expressions of his moods of longing for home,\r\nmingled with resentment against injustice. “Childhood Scenes” is an\r\nexample, beginning:\r\n\r\n    I’ve longed for home these eight long years, I know.\r\n    I long in sleep as well as through the day!\r\n        I long for home!\r\n    I seek where’er I go, not men-folk, but the fields\r\n        Where I would stray,\r\n    The stones where as a child I used to play.[110]\r\n\r\nThere are sundry references to his mother; a line that will arouse\r\nsympathy reads,\r\n\r\n    She prayed my life might have a worthy goal![111]\r\n\r\nIn the poem, “Fame,” he is melancholy and laments:\r\n\r\n    You seek for fame but I would choose another\r\n    And greater blessing:\r\n      So to be forgotten\r\n    That none should hear my name;\r\n    No, not my mother.[112]\r\n\r\nThe death of his father, in 1887, called him back to Sweden; here,\r\nwith intervals of travel, has been his residence through his mature\r\nlife. A volume of his _Poems_, following those of _Pilgrimages and\r\nWander-Years_, increased his reputation among his countrymen. They\r\nwere of diverse types; some were emotional like “A Man’s Last Word to a\r\nWoman”; others were scenic and dramatic narratives, like “The Forest of\r\nTiveden” and “The Burial of Gustaf Fröding.” The lyrical quality in his\r\nsongs adapts them to community singing; his “Sweden” is most familiar\r\nand has been compared by Mr. Stork to John Masefield’s “August, 1914.”\r\nThe vibrant quality is strong; the patriotism is appealing:\r\n\r\n    Oh, Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, native Land!\r\n    Our earthly home, the haven of our longing!\r\n    The cow-bells ring where heroes used to stand,\r\n    Whose deeds are song, but still with hand in hand\r\n    To swear the eternal troth thy sons are thronging!\r\n\r\nIn later poems, as well as prose essays, Heidenstam has shown ardent\r\nliberalism and a spirit of brotherhood. “Singers in the Steeple”\r\nemphasizes\r\n\r\n    Not joy to the rich, to the poor men care;\r\n    Our toil and our pleasure alike we share.\r\n\r\n_Poems_, published in 1902, contain appeals for democracy and universal\r\nsuffrage, in the verses, “Fellow-Citizens,” and other lines. Like\r\nhis predecessor, Björnson, he is both national and universal in his\r\nidealism. With honor and love he has written the elegy of Björnson as\r\n“Norway’s Father,” with the closing lines:\r\n\r\n    Yet the soul of the people deep within\r\n    Still breathes the eternal brother-song,\r\n    We stand and gaze at the sunset long\r\n    And grieve for thee as one of our kin.[113]\r\n\r\nVerner von Heidenstam must be included on the lists of novelists as\r\nwell as poets. In 1889 he published his first romance, _Endymion_, a\r\nnew treatment of an old theme. With a painter’s glow of fancy he sought\r\nto depict, through a love story of moderate interest, the atmosphere of\r\nthe East, when it is clouded by restraints of Western civilization. He\r\nhad registered rebellion against the growth of naturalism in fiction:\r\nin _Pepita’s Wedding_ (1890) he urged idealism, and search for inner\r\ntruth. The term, “imaginative realist,” which has been used to classify\r\nHeidenstam, is especially applicable to the fantastic, emotional\r\ntale, _Hans Alienus_ (1892). As writer of fiction, however, the name\r\nof Heidenstam will always be linked most closely with _The Charles\r\nMen_ (_Karolinern_)--stories of Charles XII and his wars--a series of\r\nprose-poems depicting Swedish heroism, written with fervor and artistic\r\nfinish. A translation by Charles Wharton Stork, with introduction\r\nby Fredrik Böök, has been added to the _Scandinavian Classics_\r\n(American-Scandinavian Foundation, New York, 1920). Among the best of\r\nseveral dramatic tales are “French Mons,” “The Fortified House,” and\r\n“Captured.” Like Rolland, Heidenstam is a pacifist yet he has written\r\na vigorous tribute to this “King who lived his whole life in the field\r\nand died in a trench,” the man who was a genius in war but, like his\r\nheroic men, gentle as well as brave, with lofty visions.\r\n\r\nOther romances followed this major work, _The Charles Men_--tales\r\nand folklore, sagas and modern applications in _Saint George and the\r\nDragon_, _Saint Briggitta’s Pilgrimage_, and _Forest Murmurs_. In\r\nfiction and essays the writer has attacked naturalism that “lets the\r\ncellar air escape through the house.” Some of his significant essays\r\nare collected as _Classicism and Teutonism_. It is unfortunate that\r\nso few of his works are adequately rendered into English. He has\r\ncontributed to liberal and reform journals. In 1900, marrying for a\r\nthird time, he bought a home near Vadstena, the place of his childhood,\r\nand with his wife, a woman of broad culture and social charm, he has\r\nexerted a wide influence upon Swedish life. In 1912 he was elected a\r\nmember of the Swedish Academy which honored itself, as well as him, by\r\nthe award of the Nobel prize four years later, after his candidacy had\r\nbeen urged throughout Scandinavia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAmong his verses had been delightful “Cradle Songs”; he had written,\r\nalso, juvenile stories. He was asked by the Swedish educational\r\nauthorities to write a Reader for school use. He calls this “a work of\r\nlove.” Without the originality and glamour of Miss Lagerlöf’s books,\r\n_The Wonderful Adventures of Nils_ and its sequel, this Reader contains\r\nsome absorbing tales of heroism, and poems and scenes of descriptive\r\nmerit. For older youths and adults he has embodied poetic legends with\r\nmodern teachings in two plays, translated into English by Karoline M.\r\nKnudsen, _The Soothsayer_ and _The Birth of God_ (Boston, 1919, 1920).\r\nThe first play is located upon “An Arcadian Plain” with Apollo, the\r\nSoothsayer, the Fates, and Erigone, wife of the Soothsayer, as leading\r\ncharacters. There are sentences of subtle humor about “a man in love,”\r\nand more serious counsel of Apollo, with modern meaning:\r\n\r\n        Son of dust!\r\n    Thou didst try to serve two gods; therefore, thy power became thy\r\n      doom!\r\n\r\n_The Birth of God_ is founded upon Egyptian mythology, with symbolism\r\nin the words of Dyskolus, an Ancient, to a modern merchant, A Stranger,\r\ncomparing “the altar-fire and the sacred hymn,” when “divine destiny\r\nhad not been forgotten,” with humanity of less pure standards.\r\n\r\n_The Tree of the Folkungs_, translated from the Swedish into English\r\nby Arthur J. Chater (New York, 1925), is a romance, mingling history,\r\nsagas, fantasy, pageantry, action, and modern interpretation of some\r\nof the deeds and ideals of the Vikings. It has been compared to _Peer\r\nGynt_. Two distinctive parts of the book, welded into one story, are\r\n“Folke Filbyter” and “The Bellbo Heritage.” The elemental character\r\nthat gives title to the first part is Earl Birger, sacrificing to all\r\ngods in adversity and pulling down all altars in days of prosperity.\r\nHe opposes the dynasty of the Folkungs but he ends his days in squalor\r\nand piteous craving for the love denied him by his sons and grandsons,\r\na lesson to moderns of the futility of material miserliness. The second\r\nsection of the strange, impressive tale deals with the fortunes of the\r\nFolkungs two hundred years later and the conflict between two brothers\r\nand their differing standards, King Valdemar and Junker Magnus. The\r\nlatter considers his older brother a “good-hearted, sunny-eyed fool,”\r\ncompared with his own masterful ways. This legendary romance-pageant\r\nhas scenes of dramatic power--the battle between Valdemar and Magnus,\r\nthe love of the minstrel for an outcast maiden, and many customs of\r\nhistorical and imaginative past. It is an elaborate, well constructed\r\nrevelation of Heidenstam’s imaginative insight and vigor, united with\r\nhis skill in interpreting the _past_, in history and sagas, to the\r\nproblems of the _present hour_. He is, in truth, “the herald of a new\r\nepoch in our literature.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRIK PONTOPPIDAN\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1917 has been awarded one half to:\r\n\r\n  Pontoppidan, Henrik, born 1857: “for his profuse descriptions of\r\n  Danish life of today.”[114]\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Academy had sprung several surprises in the awards of\r\nthe first fifteen years but they surpassed all previous records, in\r\n1917, when the honor was divided between Henrik Pontoppidan and Karl\r\nGjellerup of Denmark. Danish writers, in general, were less known by\r\ntranslation in France, Italy, England, and America than their neighbors\r\nof Sweden and Norway. Outstanding exceptions are Hans Christian\r\nAndersen and Georg Brandes. The Danish Royal Theatre was recognized\r\nin contemporary life as an educational force; such playwrights of\r\nearlier and later days as Holberg, Oehlenschlager, and Edward Brandes\r\nhad been studied by dramatic scholars in many countries. Bergström’s\r\nplay, _Karen Borneman_, translated by Edwin Björkman, is discussed by\r\nBarrett H. Clark in _A Study of the Modern Drama_.[115] Another play\r\nby Bergström, _Thora van Deken_ (1915) was a dramatization of a novel\r\nby Pontoppidan.\r\n\r\nAn interesting note, regarding the reaction to this joint award\r\nof 1917, is found in the _American-Scandinavian Review_.[116] The\r\nfirst comment is upon the ages of the recipients--both were past\r\nsixty--“another veteran medal” for writers whose productivity is\r\npast. In addition, says the editorial writer, “Neither has mastering\r\ngenius that would entitle him to the prize.” Pontoppidan is the better\r\nknown; he stands for progress that will not forget tradition. Vilhelm\r\nAnderson, literary historian, has said of Pontoppidan’s writings,\r\n“Modern Denmark could be reconstructed entire from his books.” The\r\nfamily had scholars, among them a bishop, Eric Pontoppidan, of the\r\nseventeenth century, who published the oldest Danish grammar in Latin.\r\n\r\nHenrik Pontoppidan was born at Frederica in Jutland, in 1857. His\r\ngrandfather and father had been clergymen. While he was a schoolboy the\r\nfamily moved to Randers where he remained until he went to Copenhagen,\r\nto the Polytechnic Institute, to study engineering. He made a visit\r\nto Switzerland where he had his first love affair and wrote his early\r\nsketches. In 1881, in Denmark, appeared _Clipped Wings_, a collection\r\nof stories of which “The Church Ship” excels in imagination and\r\ndramatic concentration, the mystical mingling with the realistic. In\r\n1891 he lived for a time at Ostby but a few years later, after his\r\nsecond marriage, he moved to Copenhagen where he has been a noted\r\nleader in educational and literary life, a friend of Brandes and an\r\nadviser of the younger dramatists and novelists. He has been called\r\nan imitator of Ibsen; an echo of some of the melancholic effects of\r\n_Brand_ and _Ghosts_ may be seen in Pontoppidan’s tales but he is\r\ndistinctive in his methods of portrayal. He is criticized sometimes as\r\nnarrow and localized, without spiritual vision.\r\n\r\nA trilogy of novels (1892-1916) presents scenes and characters in\r\nthe rural life of Denmark. The first book, _The Promised Land_, is\r\ndepressing, strongly realistic in its hero, Emanuel, called by some\r\ncritics “a prose Brand.” It is a tale of disillusionment, a revelation\r\nof the struggle of idealists in this world of material ambitions. It\r\nis written with care--three years was devoted to it--and the note of\r\nsincerity is marked. The second novel, _Lucky Peter_, to which the\r\nauthor devoted four years, is partly subjective. The hero, like his\r\nauthor, was son of a clergyman and studied as an engineer. _The Kingdom\r\nof the Dead_, written during the war years, reflects such influences\r\nwith a stronger tone of patriotism than is dominant in the author’s\r\nother tales; it is loosely constructed but it gives clear glimpses\r\nof Copenhagen, both in city streets and outlying districts. _The\r\nApothecary’s Daughter_ has been translated by G. Nielsen (London, 1890).\r\n\r\nIn an English edition of Pontoppidan’s stories, _The Promised Land_\r\nand _Emanuel, or Children of the Soil_, translated by Mrs. Edgar\r\nLucas, with several illustrations by Nelly Erichsen (London, 1896),\r\nthe illustrator explains the author’s purpose in the chapters of _The\r\nEvolution of the Danish Peasant_. He has chosen a disturbing period in\r\neducational and religious life after the Danish peasant was transformed\r\nfrom a slave to a citizen, by the act of 1849. Political parties, “The\r\nNational-Liberal” and “Friends of the Peasants,” were formed and high\r\nschools were established. Then, by a revision of 1866, the liberties of\r\nthe peasants were again threatened and despair settled on their minds.\r\nIn two remote villages, Veilby and Skibberup, prototypes of the places\r\nwhere the author had lived and taught for a time and knew the people,\r\nhe has portrayed their customs and revolts in a vivid, descriptive\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nIn some of his short stories, like “Eagle’s Flight” and “Mimosas,”\r\nPontoppidan reveals himself at his best as narrator. He is deeply\r\ninterested in educational progress for his people; he urges freedom\r\nfrom hypocrisy and weak compromises. Idealist in his aspirations and\r\nphotographer of Danish life in town and country, he is an author whose\r\nwritings will be appreciated as the years add to their interpretations\r\nand translations.\r\n\r\n\r\nKARL GJELLERUP\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1917 has been awarded, one half to:\r\n\r\n  Gjellerup, Karl, born 1857, died October 13, 1919: “for his\r\n  many-sided, rich, and inspired writing with high ideals.”[117]\r\n\r\nLike Pontoppidan, Karl Adolf Gjellerup was the son of a clergyman. He\r\nwas born at Roholte in 1857. To please his father he studied for the\r\nministry, and took examinations in theology, but he was not willing to\r\naccept any parish. He was deeply interested in “modernist doctrines”\r\nand became a disciple of Darwin, Georg Brandes, and Spencer. Later he\r\nrecanted from some of these teachings and became less radical and more\r\nhistorical in his studies. He delighted in the Eddas and had a natural\r\nflair for literature even before he became a professional writer. He\r\nhas lived much of his life in Dresden, where his popularity seems to be\r\ngreater than in his home country. Said the commentator on Gjellerup, in\r\nthe _American-Scandinavian Review_,[118] after the prize was divided\r\nbetween him and Pontoppidan in 1917, “his appointment has been\r\nreceived with marked coolness in Scandinavia.”\r\n\r\nAs a writer, Gjellerup has traveled far afield for his subjects. He\r\nhas written books on art and music; he is an ardent Wagnerian and\r\nhas studied many aspects of this influence, as his writings testify.\r\nHe has tried his hand at plays in which he sought to reconcile the\r\nmodern spirit of Christianity with the Greek love of beauty. It is not\r\na new theme--nor is there much distinction in his treatment. He has\r\ntranslated, in modern Danish language, several tales of the Eddas and\r\nold Norse sagas. By translation into English he is known especially by\r\ntwo stories, _The Pilgrim Kamanita_ and _Minna_; other novels, typical\r\nof his style are _An Idealist_ and _Pastor Mons_, with satirical and\r\nphotographic passages.\r\n\r\n_The Pilgrim Kamanita_, translated by John E. Logie (London and New\r\nYork, 1912), is subtitled _A Legendary Romance_. It is laid on the\r\nbanks of the Gunga, when Lord Buddha visits the “City of Five Hills”;\r\nthere is graphic description of locusts and coral trees and blossoms\r\nin the grove of Krishna. The text is from Byron’s _Don Juan_--“This\r\nnarrative is not meant for narration”--an indication of its imaginative\r\nquality. The opening pages are brilliant with colorful passages,\r\n“billowy clouds of purest gold,” blossoming gardens and terraces and “a\r\nlong line of rocky eminences, rivaling in colour the topaz, amethyst,\r\nand the opal, were resolved into an enamel of incomparable beauty at\r\nthis City of the Five Hills.” Kamanita was the son of a merchant in\r\nthe land of Avanti, among the mountains. He was rich, well educated,\r\ncould sing and draw, could color crystals and “tell whence any jewel\r\ncame.” At twenty he was sent on an embassy of business to King Udena in\r\nKosambi. Here began his “Pilgrimage” in love and memories that form the\r\ntrail of this story. Mysticism, and esoteric philosophy are _mixed_,\r\nrather than _blended_, with realism.\r\n\r\n_Minna_, the novel translated into English by C. L. Nielsen (London,\r\n1913), has Dresden for its background. There are songs from Wagner and\r\nmusic by Chopin and Beethoven, interspersed with the tale of Minna\r\nand her tragic life, after her _mariage de convenance_. In a note,\r\ndated Dresden, August, 1912, the author confesses, “I have often\r\nfelt a homesick feeling for the Danish _sund_.” He adds that he has\r\nbeen reading Thomas Moore’s _Irish Melodies_, bequeathed to him by\r\nhis deceased friend, Harald Fenger. This love story, in manuscript\r\nform, was entrusted to Gjellerup before Fenger died in London, after\r\nhe had lost “Minna” and developed a fatal illness of the chest. With\r\nthese memories before him, he narrates this romance of the hero who\r\ncomes into the country, near the Elbe and, crossing the ferry, meets\r\na pretty governess and Lisbeth, whose chief distinction was that\r\nof wearing a veil, “at a time when veils are out of fashion.” The\r\ncharacter of Minna is revealed largely through letters with emotional\r\ntones. There are disillusionments as well as emotional joys in this\r\ntale, justifying the motto chosen from Moore’s line, “To live with them\r\nis far less sweet than to remember them.”\r\n\r\nThe Nobel honor to Gjellerup was appreciated much in Germany because\r\nhis influence upon art and literature had been strong, especially\r\nin Dresden. He interpreted, to Danish readers, certain factors in\r\nGerman life and philosophy. While his Danish compatriots recognize\r\nhis scholarly work, his literary insight, and subtle wit, they do not\r\nrank him as a genius nor essentially as a Danish writer. Some leaders\r\nin that country would have much preferred to be represented, among\r\nNobel prize winners, by a versatile, world-honored writer like Georg\r\nBrandes, or a playwright like Bergström (before his death in 1914)\r\nor a poet like Drachmann (before his death in 1908) or a writer of\r\nlocalized scenes but broad vision like J. V. Jensen. There are elements\r\nof poetic insight and analytical skill in the romances by Gjellerup;\r\nand translation into English will increase appreciation of his literary\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL SPITTELER\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1919 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  Spitteler, Carl, Switzerland, born 1845; died 1925; “having\r\n  especially in mind his mighty epic _Olympischen Frühling_.”[119]\r\n\r\nAnother small country and an author, little known outside France and\r\nGermany and his own land, was the choice for the award of 1919--Carl\r\nSpitteler of Switzerland. There was no prize given in 1918, in\r\nliterature. In spite of the fact that Nietzsche had written of\r\nSpitteler as “perhaps the most subtle æsthetic writer of Germany,”[120]\r\nhis name was not familiar to international readers. Born in Liestal,\r\na canton of Basel in 1845, he was nearly seventy-five years old. His\r\nwork had been idealistic in trend, thus fulfilling one condition of the\r\nprize; his epic for which he was honored had been completed fourteen\r\nyears before--_Olympian Spring_. He had suffered from disappointments\r\nand lack of appreciation by critics until his later years. He had never\r\nlost his zeal for literature and desire to promulgate ideals of truth\r\nand freedom.\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate in opportunities for travel and study as a youth.\r\nHis father was in the post-office service at Basel and later was\r\nSecretary of the Treasury at Berne. While at Basel University, Carl\r\nSpitteler came under two influences of lasting results on his life\r\nand writing--Wilhelm Wackernagel, the German philologist, and Jacob\r\nBurckhardt, the historian of the Italian Renaissance. He loved\r\nmusic, especially Beethoven, and showed taste for art. Later he went\r\nto the Universities of Zürich and Heidelberg, to study history and\r\njurisprudence. He took courses in theology--thinking he might be a\r\nminister--but decided wisely that his bent was towards philosophy\r\nand literature. His ambition was to become an epic poet; he essayed\r\nto write _John of Abyssinia_, _Atlantis_, _Theseus and Heracles_ but\r\nhe pushed aside these pioneer efforts as puerile. For eight years\r\nhe was tutor in Russia, in the family of a Russian general. While\r\nthere, he was writing slowly the poem that he had planned in student\r\ndays at Heidelberg, _Prometheus and Epimetheus_. It was issued first\r\nunder the pseudonym of “Felix Tandem” and ten years later with his\r\nown signature.[121] His Prometheus is “an exalted soul,” suffering\r\nrather than proving untrue to his spiritual ideals. By contrast is his\r\nbrother, Epimetheus, receiving Pandora’s gifts and material honors but\r\nlosing his soul until he recalls Prometheus from exile, to drive away\r\n“the powers of evil.” There is depth of philosophy mingled with modern\r\nideas in this poem of grace and beauty. He was charged with imitating\r\nNietzsche’s _Also sprach Zarathustra_ so he wrote a pamphlet, _My\r\nRelations with Nietzsche_, emphasizing his ignorance of the latter’s\r\nwork when he wrote his poem on Prometheus.\r\n\r\nHe continued his teaching in Switzerland at Berne and at Neuenstadt,\r\nspending thirty hours a week in the classroom; then he did some\r\njournalistic work at Basel. In 1883 he married and soon after\r\npublished _Extramundana_, in which he told, in verse, cosmic myths of\r\nthe history of creation. A collection of his lyrics, _Butterflies_\r\n(_Schmetterlinge_), excel in rhythm and love of nature. In 1891, he\r\ninherited a small fortune; from that time he was relieved from routine\r\nteaching and writing; he went to Lucerne where the scenic beauty\r\nincreased his literary inspiration. He experimented in various forms--a\r\nseries of essays known as _Laughing Truth_ (_Lachende Wahrheiten_),\r\nwith irony and earnestness mingled, a prose idyl, _Gustav_, and\r\na juvenile _Mädchenfeinde_, translated by Mme. la Vicomtesse Le\r\nRoquette-Buisson as _Two Little Misogynists_ (New York, 1922). There\r\nare clever illustrations by A. Helene Carter. This is an amusing tale,\r\nperhaps more appealing to adults than to children readers by its\r\nsubtle wit and modern educational problems; but it is entertaining\r\nand lively. Two boys, aged ten and nine, Gerold and Hänsli, “fine,\r\nhealthy boys,” are returning to a military school after a vacation.\r\nIf only some great event might save them--a flood or earthquake or\r\nepidemic among the teachers, or “a declaration of war.” Their feelings\r\ntowards the girls, Theresa and Marianelli, are natural and amusing.\r\nThere is irony in the warning given to Gerold lest “he should think\r\nfor himself,” a process that is both popular and unpatriotic, as many\r\npeople consider.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of some poems as _Balladen_ in 1905, Carl\r\nSpitteler wrote _Imago_, which he declared was “an explanation of\r\nPrometheus and Epimetheus--what really happened.” “Prometheus shows\r\nwhat a poet made of it.”[122] Autobiography, as in many of his books,\r\nreappears in the young man, Victor, the poet in _Imago_; in the\r\ndiscussion or analysis of Frau Doktor and German womanhood, the author\r\nhas shown the _provincial_ attitude, in many conditions of life outside\r\nGermany as well as within.\r\n\r\n_Der olympische Frühling_, which is known by translation as _Olympian\r\nSpring_, was the mature expression of Spitteler as poet. It appeared\r\nfrom the press at intervals from 1900 to 1905. It has five parts,\r\nwith more than thirty cantos, written in iambic couplets. Four lines,\r\ndescribing Apollo, from _Olympian Spring_, have been freely translated\r\nby Thekla E. Hodge:\r\n\r\n    Threefold is thy royal crown of fame:\r\n    Thou hast conceived it: that shows thy lofty aim.\r\n    Thou hast dared it: that tells the hero’s valor.\r\n    Thou hast achieved it: from thousands thou art chosen.\r\n\r\nThe poem mingles classic mythology with satire, contemporary problems,\r\nhumor and idealism. With high praise, it has been called “The Divine\r\nComedy of the New Century.”[123] It has been compared to Shelley’s\r\n_Prometheus Unbound_, to Keats’ _Endymion_ and other epical poems.\r\nAnanke, ruler of the universe, is a vitalized character from mythology\r\nwho imprisons the gods in Erebus. He permits them to start on a journey\r\nto visit the distant world while Moira, daughter of Ananke, gives\r\nspringtime and peace to the world. Their joy is turned into discord and\r\nsuffering as they come near;--\r\n\r\n    And from the yawning cleft the echoes’ thunder rolled,\r\n    For aye no spot on earth but witnessed grief untold.\r\n\r\nThe blue flower of Memory has a vital part to play. The angels chant\r\ntheir message of hope, their assurance of “a coming morn” when cocks\r\nwill crow at the advent of a Saviour, and Part I ends in a climax of\r\nidealism. The “Winning of Hera,” Queen of the Amazons, and the choice\r\nof Herakles as wanderer on the earth, suffering any tortures for the\r\nsake of Truth, are larger themes in Part II. Marguerite Münsterberg has\r\nmade an interpretive translation of parts of this epic poem which won\r\nfor its author the Nobel prize.[124] There is drollery and satire, as\r\nin the plan of Aphrodite to lead mankind away like children, and the\r\nfrustration by rain and burlesque features. The poetic climaxes are\r\nvigorous and the complete work is masterly and epical.\r\n\r\nSpitteler is often ranked as representative of German literature in\r\nSwitzerland, in company with Gottfried Keller, Conrad Meyer, author\r\nof _The Monk’s Marriage_, and Joseph Victor Widman, author of _Saints\r\nand Beasts_. He showed influences, in prose and verse, of Goethe and\r\nSchiller but he had originality in his approach to his subject and\r\nits treatment. He endured much loneliness of spirit from neglect of\r\nhis literary messages and from political bitterness. During the war\r\nhe urged the neutrality of German Switzerland and so lost favor with\r\nthe people who had stimulated and encouraged him; in return he gained\r\npopularity in France and was given the greeting of the French Academy\r\nwhen he was seventy years old. His poems vary much in tones and\r\nmeasures; there are musical _Bell Songs_ (_Glockenlieder_, 1906) and\r\nlight, joyful _Butterflies_ of earlier years. In the later _Ballads_\r\nhe often struck a note against commercialism, with a ring of robust\r\nidealism in behalf of spiritual values, and denunciation of those\r\n“Prudes to the bone”--\r\n\r\n    For what of old our fathers virtues made\r\n    They’ve chaffered for in markets or betrayed.\r\n\r\nThe death of Carl Spitteler at Lucerne, in the current year,\r\nrevived interest in his life and writings, and evoked recognition\r\nof his influence towards revival of the best in classicism, and his\r\naspirations for freedom and sincerity in modern life and letters.\r\n\r\nAmong many tributes to the work of this poet a few may be cited from\r\nthe monograph, compiled by Eugen Diederichs Verlag in Jena, translated\r\nfor this book by Thekla E. Hodge. Michael Georg Conrad, often compared\r\nwith Spitteler as a leading exponent of modern German literature,\r\nwrites: “The marked superiority of Spitteler over his contemporaries\r\nin the realm of _belles-lettres_ is due to his brilliant creative\r\ngenius, and the rare combination of deep feeling and keen humor.”\r\nWidman, another author-critic, writes of _Prometheus_: “In this poem\r\nhe blends poetry with religion (mythology) and thought (philosophy).\r\nUnfortunately, we can draw no comparison for nothing like it is found\r\nin literature.” The same critic is enthusiastic about the poems,\r\n_Butterflies_ (_Schmetterlinge_). “The fate of these wondrous little\r\ncreatures, whose transformation has ever brought to the human mind a\r\nmysterious and touching symbolism, was wrought by the poet’s touch into\r\nscenes of dramatic tragedy, and irresistible charm.”\r\n\r\nSeveral commentators have stressed the qualities of vigor and\r\ngrotesqueness, combined with idyllic poetry in the epics and lyrics by\r\nSpitteler. One of the most sincere tributes was that of Romain Rolland,\r\nwritten soon after he had received the Nobel prize and before that\r\nhonor was given to Carl Spitteler. He regrets that it was not bestowed\r\nupon the Swiss writer and adds: “Spitteler is to my mind the greatest\r\nEuropean poet, the only one today who approaches the most famous names\r\nof the past.... Strange blindness of the world to pass by the living\r\nflame of the genius of the most inspired poet without even divining its\r\nsplendour.” The award of 1919 was the fulfilment of Rolland’s desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1916.\r\n\r\n[110] _Sweden’s Laureate: Selected Poems_ translated by Charles Wharton\r\nStork, New Haven, 1919.

Few authors have been so self-revelatory as he has been\r\nin his plays and novels. Except for statistical facts and side lights,\r\nto be found in other sources, one can make almost a complete picture\r\nof his background, his early struggles and revolts, his innate poetry\r\nand growing idealism, by reading in succession _Hunger_, _Mysteries_,\r\n_Pan_, and _Munken Vendt_, followed by _Dreamers_, _Benoni_, _Children\r\nof the Age_, and _Growth of the Soil_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Knut Hamsun’s parents were of peasant stock, the boy, born\r\nAugust 4, 1860, at Lom, in Gudbrandsdalen, in eastern Norway, inherited\r\nstrains of artistic craftsmanship. His grandfather was a worker in\r\nmetals (sometimes called a blacksmith) but fortunes were low and, when\r\nthe lad was four years old, the family moved from the Gudbrandsdalen\r\nmountain valley to the Lofoden Islands, Nordland. Here, amid wild,\r\nawesome scenery and simple fisherfolk with sordid tasks, the youth\r\ngrew to young manhood. For a time he lived with an uncle who was a\r\npreacher, of the state church; he was a severe man. In his short\r\nstory, “A Spook,” Hamsun recalls those days with their floggings and\r\nwork and hours of escape to the cemetery or the woods.[126] Before he\r\ncould satisfy his cravings for an education, he was apprenticed to a\r\nshoemaker in Bodö, in Nordland. He managed to get his first writings\r\npublished; in 1878 appeared the serious poem, that showed appreciation\r\nof the glowing colors and wild aspects of nature, _Meeting Again_,\r\nand the story _Björger_ with the pseudonym, Knud Pederson Hamsund.\r\nWhile there were interesting bits of autobiography, this initial\r\nfiction was imitative of Björnson and has not been revived by its\r\nauthor among his books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By courtesy of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc._\r\n\r\nKNUT HAMSUN]\r\n\r\nRestless and unwilling to spend his days at Bodö as a shoemaker, he\r\nworked for a short while as coal heaver, and later as road-maker and\r\nschool-teacher and sheriff’s assistant. Then, like so many Scandinavian\r\nyouths, he decided to emigrate to America. Some of these earlier\r\nexperiences are recalled in his novels, _A Wanderer Plays on Muted\r\nStrings_ and _Under the Autumn Star_ (in the English edition united as\r\n_Wanderers_). In the United States he drifted from one occupation to\r\nanother and covered a wide range of pursuits as street-car conductor,\r\nfarm laborer, clerk in grocery store and lecturer. He cherished\r\nhopes of literary chances in this country but the lack of them, and\r\nthe misfortunes that came upon him, made him bitter for a time,\r\nin retrospect. Those who recalled him on the Halstead street-car\r\nline in Chicago, and later on a cable line, affirmed that he had “a\r\nperpetual stare into the horizon,” that he was “out-at-elbows” and\r\nhad small volumes of classic poets sticking out of his pockets.[127]\r\nThey add that he would forget to ring the bell for passengers or\r\nwould fall over their feet in his reverie. One is skeptical of such\r\ndetailed memories of famous men. In the summer of 1885, he was back in\r\nChristiania, doing some journalistic work and lecturing. Hanna Arstrup\r\nLarsen in her authoritative study of Knut Hamsun[128] says that he had\r\nbeen at the University of Christiania, before he went to America; but\r\nthat he found he was a misfit and went back to his “old life on the\r\nroad.”[129]\r\n\r\nIn 1886, says Professor Josef Wiehr,[130] he returned to the United\r\nStates as correspondent for _Current Events_ (_Verdens Gang_) but\r\nhe was obliged to undertake manual work to get a living wage; for a\r\ntime he was with a Russian fishing vessel off the Newfoundland banks.\r\nFor about a year he was secretary to Kristoffer Janson, a Norwegian\r\nclergyman in Minneapolis; he was then twenty-eight years old, and had\r\nbeen working on a farm in North Dakota. He wanted a chance to lecture\r\nin Minneapolis on literary topics but his ambitions were unrealized\r\nand he left America with some bitter feelings and the manuscript\r\nof his satirical book, _The Spiritual Life of Modern America_ (or\r\n_Intellectual Life in Modern America_), sometimes entitled _Of American\r\nCulture_. In a copy of this book, owned by Edwin Björkman, Hamsun\r\nwrote an inscription, dated 1905, thus, “A youthful work. It has ceased\r\nto represent my opinion of America.”[131] He scoffs at “American\r\npatriotism, engendered by means of tinfifes”; he asserts, “There is\r\nan enormous gap in American liberty, a chasm which is kept open by\r\nthe thick-headed democracy”; he finds no cultural life but coarse\r\nmaterialism and “prudishness” and “self-satisfied ignorance.”[132]\r\nThe book justifies a critic’s comment that it is “a masterpiece of\r\ndistorted criticism.”[133] His short story, “Woman’s Victory,” in the\r\ncollection, _Struggling Life_, is based on his experiences in Chicago;\r\nin the Preface, he tells of his life as car conductor. “Zacchæus,” in\r\nthe collection, _Brushwood_ (1903), is reminiscent of the days upon the\r\nNorth Dakota farm.\r\n\r\nIn Copenhagen, on his return from America, he enlisted the interest\r\nof Edward Brandes, then editor of a daily newspaper there. Through\r\nhis influence, place was found for the manuscript of _Hunger Sult_ in\r\na Copenhagen magazine, _New Soil_, in 1888, to appear anonymously;\r\ntwo years later it came out as a book, with the author’s name on the\r\ntitle-page. It was immature and subjective, but it gripped readers\r\neverywhere by its sincerity and whimsicality. Miss Larsen makes a true\r\ncriticism of this book when she says it is “without beginning and end\r\nand without a plot but it has a series of climaxes.” Antithetical\r\nto such passages of poetic and dramatic power there are pages of\r\nnaturalism that cause a revulsion of emotion and seem to some readers\r\nan insult to taste. It is absolutely true and relentless; perhaps,\r\nas Professor Wiehr suggests, “By the production of this work, Hamsun\r\nsought to free his mind from terrible memories of the past that were\r\nhaunting him” (p. 13). Two years later the same mixture of poetic high\r\nlights and crass realism characterized _Mysteries_. Johan Nagel is the\r\nrestless hero who falls in love with Dagny Kielland, daughter of the\r\npastor, and meets with tragic experiences and suicide. Like his author,\r\n“Nagel is at odds with life” and finds peace only in nature. Like\r\nHamsun he tries vainly to adapt himself to conventions of society and\r\nbecomes embittered. “The Hamsun ego,” as Miss Larsen calls the _motif_\r\nof these earlier tales, recurs in _Editor Lynge_, the drama, _Sunset_,\r\nand _Pan_ (1894). Lieutenant Glahn, the hunter in this last book,\r\nis happy in his hut and outdoors but is proudly unhappy in contact\r\nwith humanity; the tale ends in tragedy. Edvarda, the woman of this\r\nstory, is erotic and capricious to the point of disgust yet she has a\r\npathetic element in her nature.\r\n\r\n_Victoria_ shows an advance away from the “Hamsun ego” of revolt and\r\nnaturalism towards that of poetry: Johannes, the hero, the miller’s\r\nson, is in harmony with nature; even loss in love cannot blight his\r\nsoul. There are sentences of poetic diction in this novel and in\r\n_Munken Vendt_ (1902), the dramatic poem which embodies the character\r\nof a lovable, simple vagabond. One recalls the words of Edwin Björkman,\r\nin the Introduction to his translation of _Hunger_; “The artist and the\r\nvagabond seem equally to have been in the blood of Hamsun from the very\r\nstart.”[134] Before he attained to the second type of novel--the less\r\nsubjective and more idealistic group--(if idealism may be so expanded\r\nin meaning) Hamsun wrote a trilogy of plays, beginning with _At the\r\nGates of the Kingdom_ (1895) with Kareno, a philosophical student\r\nand writer, as hero, and a wife of sexual domination. The author’s\r\ntenets about life and government are voiced by Kareno in this drama\r\nand _Life’s Play_, ten years later in setting; the third in the cycle,\r\n_Sunset_ (1898) shows Kareno at fifty, full of scientific doubts and\r\nreactions from earlier aspirations for liberty and truth. The author\r\nindulges his satire against professional “moralists” in these plays;\r\nsometimes, he indulges, also, his unvarnished frankness of sensual\r\nportrayals, and his lack of deference for old age. The play, _In the\r\nGrip of Life_, was translated by Graham and Tristan Rawson and issued\r\nin 1924 (Knopf). The women in his plays are, generally, animalistic, or\r\nerotic, lacking diversity in types.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of _Children of the Age_ (or _Children of the\r\nTimes_) in 1909, followed by _Segelfoss Town_ and _Growth of the Soil_,\r\nthe reader of persistent interest in Hamsun realized that the author\r\nhad orientated himself, that he was “finding his place” in literature.\r\nHe was still defying society, “the group,” still disclaiming belief\r\nin democracy, but he had gained “a social vision.” In method\r\ncharacteristic of many novelists, he has chosen a family, with strong\r\nracial traits, the family of Willatz Holmsen, for the expression of\r\nhis sociological ideas. The despotic, anxious Willatz III, a retired\r\nLieutenant, is a character that lingers in memory; he is vitally real\r\nin his relations with his wife, of higher social rank, and with his\r\nson, the musicianly boy; he is dramatic and pathetic in his defiance\r\nof Tobias Holmengraa, the industrial “king” from South America. The\r\nlast days of stubborn pride and loneliness are scenes of artistic\r\nfiction. _Segelfoss Town_, written before _The Growth of the Soil_,\r\nbut translated afterwards by J. S. Scott (Knopf, 1925), continues the\r\nstory of this family and the departure of Holmengraa, after a financial\r\ncollapse, leaving behind his daughter, Mariane, half Mexican in blood,\r\nwho marries the commercial “leader of the small town. Segelfoss Town\r\nhas been called a ‘Norwegian Main Street.’” There is much irony and\r\nreiterated sordidness in the tale. The telegraph operator, Baardsen, is\r\na daring, strong character.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction to _Dreamers_, W. W. Worster (New York, 1922) calls\r\n_The Growth of the Soil_ Hamsun’s “greatest triumph.” It is the _one_\r\nbook thus far appearing in American edition, that seems to win wide\r\nreading. It is localized in setting, objective in theme, and universal\r\nin human appeal. Isac (or Isak) is a convincing character of elemental\r\ntype. He symbolizes man, when face to face with nature. Inger is a\r\ncoarse Lapp woman in her physical nature yet she seeks expression for\r\nfiner feelings, even as she strangles the third baby girl that would\r\nbear, through life, the mother’s curse of a hair lip. “Back to the\r\nsoil!” is the message of this masterpiece of Norwegian fiction. It has\r\na large group of Norwegian characters, and a challenging tone regarding\r\nmany moral issues, but it maintains artistic unity.\r\n\r\nThat Knut Hamsun has grown steadily in literary skill, that he has\r\nwritten novels of vigor and photographic effects, cannot be denied.\r\nThat he has a philosophical attitude towards humanity and the driving\r\nforces behind society (especially as applied to Norway), is also\r\nevident. His self-education, his persistence, and his assimilated\r\njudgment, together with caustic wit and grotesque humor, are other\r\nqualities that must be accounted to his credit. On the other hand, he\r\nis often slothful and diffuse in structure and offensive to æsthetic\r\nminds because of his stress of sexual impulses and his coarseness.\r\nHe does not condone immorality but he seems indifferent to its\r\nexistence. In his personal convictions, however, he realizes the need\r\nof a basic morality. Says Professor Wiehr: “It is just this absence\r\nof ‘the triumph of a moral idea’ which will stand most in the way of\r\nany popularity of Hamsun’s works with the great majority of American\r\nreaders.” Other explanations of Hamsun’s attitude towards Christianity\r\nand “constructive ideas” are given in this excellent study by Professor\r\nWiehr.[135] He thinks that his countrymen, and “all backward nations,”\r\nare in a much better position to follow his advice than the millions\r\nthat populate the countries leading the world in industries. Some\r\ncritics affirm that Hamsun’s compatriot, Johan Boyer, in his condensed,\r\ndramatic novels, _The Great Hunger_, _The Last of the Vikings_, _A\r\nPilgrimage_, and _The Emigrants_ is more gifted as a novelist and\r\nshows more evidences of idealistic vision. In his personal life,\r\nHamsun has revealed the traits of the wanderer, “vagabond” if you\r\nwill, combined with the deep-rooted love of home and devotion to his\r\ncountrymen in their industrial needs and their educational struggles.\r\nHe is not an optimist but he advocates persistent work and the\r\npreservation of spiritual freedom and courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1920.\r\n\r\n[126] _Knut Hamsun: His Personality and His Outlook upon Life_ by Josef\r\nWiehr, _Smith College Studies in Modern Languages_, Vol. III, Nos. 1\r\nand 2, pp. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n[127] _Literary Digest_ 67: 35, November 20, 1920.\r\n\r\n[128] _Knut Hamsun: A Study_ by Hanna Arstrup Larsen, Knopf, New York,\r\n1922.\r\n\r\n[129] _Ibid._, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[130] _Knut Hamsun: His Personality and His Outlook upon Life_,\r\nNorthampton, 1922.\r\n\r\n[131] Introduction to _Hunger_ by Knut Hamsun, translated by Edwin\r\nBjörkman, New York, 1920.

Distinctly Parisian in traits and expression,\r\nthis writer was broadly international in his analysis of humanity, in\r\nhis genial mockery of life, in his dreamy idealism which coexisted\r\nwith a ruthless realism. He had lived the full span of life--and\r\n_lived_ it to the end of his eighty years. He had written in moods of\r\nbiting satire and emotional intensity; he had found themes in history,\r\ncurrent topics, and the future. As he neared the close of his life,\r\nthe emphasis was more upon the genial, kindly aspects of humanity;\r\nhis later literary expressions were memories of his boyhood and youth,\r\nthe completion of that cycle of intuitive memories that began with _My\r\nFriend’s Book_ (1885) and _Pierre Nozière_, and ended with _Little\r\nPierre_ and _The Bloom of Life_ (1922).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Copyright, 1925, by J. B. Lippincott Company._\r\n  _Photograph by Choumoff, Paris_\r\n\r\nANATOLE FRANCE]\r\n\r\nBetween these volumes of imaginative and reminiscent delights, which\r\nform a better biography of his mind and spirit than has otherwise been\r\nwritten, Anatole France produced such diverse literary types, such\r\nbooks of ironic and cynical flavor as _The Red Lily_, _Thaïs_, _The\r\nRevolt of the Angels_, _The Amethyst Ring_, _At the Sign of the Reine\r\nPédauque_, _Crainquebille_, _The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife_, _The\r\nElm Tree on the Mall_, _Penguin Island_, _The Gods Are Athirst_, _The\r\nLife of Jeanne d’Arc_, _The Human Comedy_, and volumes of critical\r\nessays and poems. To the books of more reminiscent flavor, with wistful\r\nidealism, he was indebted, especially, for the honor of the Nobel\r\nprize. These had already won the tributes--and critical estimates--of\r\nreaders of European countries, of Canada, United States and South\r\nAmerica. Few writers have had such diverse judgments passed upon them;\r\nin many cases, the temperamental traits of the critic influence his\r\nreactions to this author; in other instances, most effusive tributes,\r\nlike those by James Lewis May and Paul Gsell, of recent years (1924),\r\nhave brought natural reactions in more unvarnished truth, tinged\r\nwith wit and naturalism, like the biography by Jean-Jacques Brousson:\r\n_Anatole France Himself_ which has been called facetiously _Anatole\r\nFrance in Bed-Slippers_ (the French title reads _Anatole France en\r\npantouffles_, 1925). Mr. May has written as a friend and warm admirer;\r\nPaul Gsell, as a disciple; M. Brousson, as private secretary and\r\nfearless narrator.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that Anatole France was _born_ into the inheritance of\r\nbooks in 1844, for his father, François Noël Thibault, was a bookseller\r\nof repute throughout Paris and its environs. Son of a shoemaker in\r\nAnjou, this elder Thibault had taught himself to read and write while\r\nhe had been in military service as a young man. At his bookshops in\r\nthe Quai Malaquais and Quai Voltaire gathered scholars and authors,\r\niconoclasts in politics and letters and religion; the shopkeeper was\r\na Royalist and a fervent Catholic. In the character of Dr. Nozière,\r\nin _Pierre Nozière_, his son “has taken away the bookshop,” as he\r\nconfesses, but he has revealed many traits of his father’s character.\r\nIn the Epilogue to _The Bloom of Life_ are other memories that may be\r\n“capricious,” as he admits, but are none the less true “records” of his\r\nchildhood. Here his father’s lack of business instincts is suggested\r\nas elsewhere--he would often prefer to _read_ his books rather than to\r\n_sell_ them. The influence of these boyhood days in this bookshop,\r\nwith contact directly with thinkers and writers, with wits and critics,\r\nmust have been vital and permeating in the later development of Anatole\r\nFrance as psychologist and stylist.\r\n\r\nIn his last hours, we are told, this famous writer who had been “a\r\ngenial mocker at life,” an epicurean and scoffer, a scholar of wide\r\nculture, called upon the name of his mother. She had been the first,\r\nand one of the most significant factors in his life-development. There\r\nare passages of less deferential tone about her in _Anatole France\r\nHimself: a Boswellian Record_, by Jean-Jacques Brousson (Philadelphia,\r\n1925). She was of good Flemish family, with unfailing _esprit_ and\r\noptimism, practical and able to “attend to the gears of household\r\nmanagement that got loose sometimes,” with an absent-minded father.\r\nShe was, however, a rare story-teller and devoted to her boy with\r\nthe unusual gifts which she alone, in his boyhood, could foresee and\r\nencourage. How happy he was at home is revealed in many chapters of\r\nhis books--not alone those of acknowledged reminiscence but others\r\nlike _The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard_ and an occasional essay _On Life\r\nand Letters_. By contrast with the joys of home--the delicate table\r\nlinen and decanters, the “tranquil faces,” the easy talk--he disliked\r\nthe classrooms and the restrictions of school life, declaring, “Ah,\r\nHome is a famous school.” A sense of humor and a keen interest in\r\nhumanity made the life at the Collège Stanislas endurable but he loved\r\nsolitude; he resented the gibes of instructors and students, and he\r\nstole away to the quays along the Seine at the hour of noon recess to\r\neat his luncheon--or to forget to eat it--and returned too late for the\r\nafternoon session and his chance to recite.\r\n\r\nIt was his mother’s faith and intuition that refused to be severe with\r\nhim, even when the professor’s report of his school work was “progress\r\nnil--conduct bad,” even when his father accepted the verdict of M.\r\nDubois, the professor, that the boy would never accomplish anything in\r\narts or sciences. Then his mother whispered words that he never forgot:\r\n“Be a writer, my son; you have brains and you will make the envious\r\nhold their tongues.” If his mother was the first vital influence in\r\nmaking her son a world-famous writer, the second was the city of Paris\r\nthat he loved, studied and photographed on his memory from boyhood\r\nto old age. The parks and avenues, the Louvre and the Trocadéro, the\r\nsidewalk cafés and the bookshops beyond beautiful Notre-Dame, the\r\nvivacious men and women, the workers on the streets and the children\r\nin the playgrounds, the stately palaces and the tiny rooms above a\r\npublishing shop--all these aspects of Paris form a panoramic picture in\r\nhis books.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, when Anatole France was an unknown, dreamy, book-browsing\r\nyoung man of twenty-four, there appeared an _Etude_ of Alfred de\r\nVigny which was _his_ tribute to the poet who was “the exemplar of a\r\nbeautiful life, which gave beautiful work to the world.” The author was\r\nknown as one of a group of young men who gathered in the rue de Condé\r\nto discuss poetry and other forms of writing. Two years later he was\r\nserving in the army, trying to forget the shells that dropped in front\r\nof him by reading Vergil or playing his flute.[137] In the years that\r\nfollowed he wrote political satires, prefaces, read manuscripts for the\r\npublisher Lemerre, collaborated in Larousse’s dictionary and did other\r\n“odds and ends” of an editorial kind.\r\n\r\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, Lemerre published the small book of\r\nverse to which Anatole France had devoted his leisure and zest,\r\n_Poèmes après_. In spite of some stanzas of lyrical beauty they\r\nattracted little attention. Better known is _The Bride of Corinth_ that\r\nappeared three years later and revealed the author’s keen analysis of\r\npaganism and early Christianity. It is translated with other plays\r\nand poems by Wilfrid Jackson and Emilia Jackson, 1920. For a time\r\nhe was assistant to Leconte de Lisle in the Senate Library.[138]\r\nAs a witty conversationalist and brilliant companion, he was a\r\nfavorite in the salons of Catulle Mendes and Mme. Nina de Callias,\r\nthe would-be poet. At the home of M. de Bonnières, where gathered\r\nactors, writers, and musicians, Anatole France was always welcomed. In\r\n1881 appeared the book which registered the beginning of his popular\r\nacclaim, _The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard_; one may say that it is\r\n_the book_ by which, during the last forty years, the author has been\r\nfamiliar to international readers, old and young. It is a simple\r\ntale, sentimental, without much plot but with two marked qualities of\r\nlasting appeal--sincerity and charm. Ten years later he laughed at its\r\ncontinued popularity, especially the claim that it was “a masterpiece,”\r\nsaying “it was a masterpiece of platitudinousness,” adding that he\r\nwrote it for a prize and won it.[139]\r\n\r\nPredictions of future fame were expressed in reviews of this book and,\r\nfour years later, the public responded to _My Friend’s Book_, the first\r\nof the cycle of youthful memories, vignettes of life which reveal the\r\nauthor’s poetic reveries and friendly humanity. They differ from _The\r\nCrime of Sylvestre Bonnard_ as the author gives here photographic\r\npictures of his boyhood, adolescence, and young manhood while in\r\nSylvestre Bonnard, the aged, lovable book-collector and Academician,\r\nhe gives an imaginative picture of what the author _may be_. He is\r\nlonely and dominated by his cat, Hamilcar, and his housekeeper,\r\ncherishing the romantic memories of Clementine, and is urged by these\r\nsentiments to his sacrifice for her daughter. A few of his boyhood\r\nmemories, however, are incorporated into the early chapters of this\r\nbook--the craving for a doll, the silhouette of the uncle, Captain\r\nVictor, and other pages of wistfulness and humor. Lafcadio Hearn, in\r\nhis Introduction to the translation of this classic _roman_, says\r\nwords that may be applied to the cycle of memories (for they all have\r\nhall-marks of the author’s superb paradoxical genius). “If by Realism\r\nwe mean Truth, which alone gives value to any study of human nature,\r\nwe have in Anatole France a very dainty realist;--if by Romanticism we\r\nunderstand that unconscious tendency of the artist to elevate truth\r\nitself beyond the range of the familiar, and into the emotional realm\r\nof aspiration, then Anatole France is at times a romantic.... It is\r\nbecause of his far rarer power to deal with what is older than any art,\r\nand withal more young, and incomparably more precious: the beauty of\r\nwhat is beautiful in human emotion, that this story will live.”[140]\r\n\r\nAfter 1886 the weekly “Causerie,” which Anatole France contributed _On\r\nLife and Letters_ to the Paris _Temps_, increased his literary fame and\r\nestablished his rank as critic. Here appeared such diverse, stimulating\r\njudgments upon writers of the day, as Maupassant and Dumas, Balzac and\r\nMarie Bashkirtseff, François Coppée (compared with Sully-Prudhomme and\r\nFrédéric Plessis), Renan and George Sand; among topics of more general\r\ninterest were “Prince Bismarck,” “The Young Girl of the Past and the\r\nYoung Girl of the Present,” and “Virtue in France.” Four volumes of\r\nthese essays, _On Life and Letters_, have been translated into English.\r\nIt was nine years after _The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard_ that another\r\nbook appeared to rivet attention upon this industrious, progressive\r\nauthor. He once declared that he wrote the earlier book “to please\r\nthe public” but that he wrote the later, _Thaïs_, to please himself.\r\nIn development of skill in fiction it is superior; it has been well\r\ndescribed as “an epic of eternal struggle between the spirit and the\r\nsenses.”[141] The author had passed through some emotional crises since\r\nhe wrote his earlier books of reminiscence, notably _My Friend’s Book_,\r\nwith its reflections of his happy home life and the whimsical domestic\r\ndiscussions between the wife of his youth and himself about their\r\ndaughter, Susanne. He had traveled and become imbued with sensuous\r\nbeauty of southern lands; he had been annoyed, to the verge of anger,\r\nby reactionists, represented in _Thaïs_ by Palaemon, “who would banish\r\njoy and beauty from the world.” He made Nicias, often a skeptic in\r\nhis surface sentiments, his spokesman. The poet and the realist are\r\ncommingled in this tale of disillusionment, even as they are found\r\nin the later, more vehement books of the novelist-satirist, _The Red\r\nLily_, _At the Sign of the Reine Pédauque_ (considered by many critics\r\nhis masterwork), _The Amethyst Ring_, _The Gods Are Athirst_, _The\r\nWicker-Work Woman_, _Penguin Island_, _The Revolt of the Angels_, and\r\nshorter stories like _Crainquebille_, _The White Stone_, _The Seven\r\nWives of Bluebeard_, and _Tales from a Mother of Pearl Casket._\r\n\r\nFresh memories of the Dreyfus Case were awakened by his poignant satire\r\nin _Penguin Island_ with its elements of burlesque. The author’s\r\nhistorical research, which bore ripe fruits in _The Life of Jeanne\r\nd’Arc_, is revealed in _The Gods Are Athirst_, with sardonic wit and\r\ndramatic passages between Evariste, his mother, and his mistress.\r\nJulie, his beautiful sister, appeals to the reader’s sympathy. The\r\nex-farmer of taxes, whose livelihood is now made by cutting out\r\ncardboard dancing dolls, is a haunting character. He voices, perhaps,\r\nthe author’s attitude to life at this period--that is was full of\r\ndisillusionment and defeats but was not worth the cost of one’s anxiety\r\nto the point of despair. In some of these satiric tales of life,\r\nnotably _The Revolt of the Angels_ when they come to Paris and behold\r\ncertain social conditions, there are passages so naturalistic that they\r\noffend tastes of less “sophisticated” readers. Some of the books by\r\nAnatole France were tabooed in libraries before the award of the Nobel\r\nprize; the year after that was given, all of his works, without due\r\ndiscrimination, were “placed on the Index” by the Roman Curia because\r\nof excess of utterances that were communistic and anti-clerical in\r\ntone. When he went to Stockholm to receive this prize in person he\r\nwas reported to have said, regarding the Treaty of Versailles, “the\r\nmost horrible of wars was followed by a treaty which was not a treaty\r\nof peace but a prolongation of the war. The downfall of Europe is\r\ninevitable unless at long last the spirit of reason is imported into\r\nits councils.”[142]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these fearless words that brought him the condemnation\r\nof French journals, he made more urbane response to the literary honor\r\nconferred upon him, adding to his personal gratitude, tribute to the\r\nSwedish Academy: “Its decisions possess an international value,\r\nand I rejoice in it, for it is a confirmation of what is, for me,\r\nthe principal lesson of the war, the beneficent influence exerted\r\nby intellectual intercourse with other countries.” There had been\r\nrumors, well attested, that the young men of France had repudiated\r\nAnatole France as a leader, seeking other exponents of philosophy and\r\nechoing the adverse comments upon him by Maurice Barrès and Henri\r\nMassis, editor of _La Revue Universelle_. They contended that he\r\nfailed to give them a constructive philosophy in the hour of need.\r\nHe never claimed to be a philosopher; he was an observer of life, a\r\ncommentator, a poet-dreamer, a lover of justice, an ironist, a stylist\r\nrather than a thinker. He was not widely read in other languages and\r\nphilosophies as were Georg Brandes or Sainte-Beuve. He bore some\r\nrelationship to Brotteaux of his story, _The Gods Are Athirst_, who was\r\ncondemned to death because of his lack of reverence for great political\r\nrevolutionists. Anatole France saw the world as a subject for keen\r\nwit that is often sardonic but seldom bitter. He found life sadly in\r\ncontrast with some of his visions as a youth but he did not despair of\r\na future of more equality of conditions, more tolerance in creeds. Paul\r\nGsell, one of his hero-worshipers, in his records of conferences at the\r\nVilla Saïd, the Paris home of “the Master,” has recalled significant\r\nthoughts uttered by him upon “The Credo of a Skeptic,” “Politics in\r\nthe Academy,” and other themes.[143]\r\n\r\nIn his _Boswellian Record_ by Jean-Jacques Brousson (Lippincott,\r\n1925) there are frank confessions of his “show conversations” and his\r\n“contradictory ideas” which caused shyness and lack of clarity of\r\nmind. He recalls “the almond icing” which he put on his first version\r\nof _The Life of Jeanne d’Arc_, to be “picturesque” and to please “the\r\nsanctimonious.” These “snap-shots” of Anatole France “en pantouffles,”\r\nin moods of relaxation, are even less interesting than some of the\r\nquotations of serious sort from the words of this master of style. Two\r\nsignificant sentences will be often quoted; “You become a good writer\r\njust as you become a good joiner; by planing down your sentences.”...\r\n“People take me for a juggler, a sophist, a droll fellow. In reality I\r\nhave passed my life twisting dynamite into curl-papers.”[144]\r\n\r\nWithout question the return of Anatole France to the spirit and mode\r\nof his earlier books, to the idealism, combined with photographic\r\nvividness in _The Bloom of Life_, influenced the decision of the\r\nSwedish Academy in his favor, in 1921. He was, in his old age,\r\nliving again the scenes of his youth--discussing with his schoolmate,\r\nFontanet, “People Who Do Not Give Enough”; playing truant from the\r\nferule of Monsieur Crottu whose rule “was a tissue of injustices”;\r\nrecalling “Days of Enchantment” when he went to his first play;\r\nphotographing “Monsieur Dubois, the Quiz,” and plucky Phillipine\r\nGobelin; and yielding again to the spell of Vergil and the Sixth\r\nEclogue, with its wonder and beauty. The stinging irony disappeared\r\nfrom these later pages--irony which motivated such books (or portions\r\nof them) as _Histoire contemporaine_ and _The Revolt of the Angels_ or\r\n“A Mummer’s Tale” in _Histoire comique_.\r\n\r\nDual personality which resides in all persons was most marked in this\r\nwriter of charm and force, this exponent of his race, and of his age\r\namong _all_ races. “Compassionate idealism” is the phrase chosen by\r\nJames Lewis May to explain the polemical essays and radical criticisms\r\nof governments and religions, that are expressed or implied in many\r\nof his writings. James Huneker calls him “a true humanist”; he thinks\r\nhe loved humanity and learning; he loved words, also, but he was “a\r\nmodern thinker, who has shed the despotism of the positivist dogma\r\nand boasts the soul of a chameleon.”[145] He stresses his irony which\r\nis “Pagan” and his pity which is “Christian.” Sisley Huddlestone, in\r\n_Those Europeans_, devotes a chapter to Anatole France as “Ironist\r\nand Dreamer.” The phrases are well chosen; the interpretation of\r\nhis salient traits is condensed but convincing: “In his irony one\r\nconstantly catches glimpses of beauty. By showing us life as it is,\r\nthough without bitterness, he indicates life as it should be. He\r\nteaches tolerance and placidity in an age in which even the reformers\r\nadd to the confusion by their reckless energy.”[146]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1921.\r\n\r\n[137] _Anatole France: the Man and His Work_ by James Lewis May, London\r\nand New York, 1923, p. 72.\r\n\r\n[138] _Studies from Ten Literatures_ by Ernest Boyd, New York, 1925.\r\n\r\n[139] _Anatole France Himself_ by Jean-Jacques Brousson, Philadelphia,\r\n1925.\r\n\r\n[140] London, Bodley Head, Crown Edition, 1924, pp. v and ix.

Fiction by\r\nGaldós, Valera, Valdes, and Ibañez have given to English and American\r\nreaders somewhat adequate impressions of the realistic power and poetic\r\nundertones of some of these latter-day novelists. In drama, three of\r\nGaldós’ plays, nine by Martínez-Sierra, a dozen more by Echegaray,\r\nand several by Benavente have been rendered into excellent English\r\nby such gifted translators as John Garrett Underhill, James Graham,\r\nCharles Nirdlinger, Hannah Lynch, Ruth Lansing, and others.[148] In\r\nthe awards to Spanish dramatists of the Nobel prize in 1904 and 1922,\r\ntwo generations with their differing standards and literary methods,\r\nhave been represented--Echegaray and Benavente. In German literature,\r\nas exampled by Heyse and Hauptmann, and in Polish fiction, with its\r\nrepresentatives, Sienkiewicz and Reymont, one finds the same recurrent\r\nrecognition in successive generations.\r\n\r\nJosé Echegaray, who shared the honor of 1904 with Frédéric Mistral,\r\nwas born in Madrid in 1833; that city was his home until his death in\r\n1916, except for periods of travel or retirement because of political\r\nfriction. As Sully-Prudhomme found his first impulse towards science,\r\nso Echegaray studied mathematics “ferociously, ravenously.” He made\r\nresearches, also, in geology and philosophy. Under the republican\r\ngovernment he held public offices, like Ministers of Agriculture,\r\nIndustry, and Commerce, President of the Council of Education, and\r\nSenator for Life. After teaching at the National Technical School,\r\nwhere he had been educated, he became identified with the University of\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\nAt first the writing of plays seems to have been a pastime for this\r\nmathematician and politician. _The Wife of the Avenger_, _At the Hilt\r\nof the Sword_, and _The Gladiator of Ravenna_, which appeared between\r\n1874 and 1876, were popular in Spain but are little known by English\r\ntranslation. In 1877 he wrote a drama that has been much discussed,\r\nsince it was translated as _Madman or Saint_ by Ruth Lansing (Poet\r\nLore, Boston, 1912); another translation by Hannah Lynch (Boston, 1895)\r\nbore the title, _Folly or Saintliness_. Still another translation by\r\nMary Serrano is used in _Library of the World’s Best Literature_. It\r\nis a strong play emotionally, with that touch of idealism and romance\r\nwhich were traits of the author, blended with his keen analysis. Don\r\nLorenzo, a wealthy man of Madrid, finds that he has been deceived\r\nregarding his parentage; he is not the son of a rich mother of noble\r\nfamily, as he and the world supposed, but the child of his nurse,\r\nJuana, who dies after she tells him the tale. No longer young, with his\r\ndaughter engaged to a son of the Duchess of Almonte, he is determined\r\nto tell the truth and so defy his family. A specialist in mental\r\ndisease is called with the physician to examine him; at the same time\r\nhe sends for a notary to record his renunciation of his name and\r\nestate. His final monologue is dramatic, beginning with the lines:\r\n“What! is a man to be declared mad because he is resolved to do his\r\nduty. It cannot be! Humanity is neither so blind nor so bad as that!”\r\n\r\nThese earlier plays by Echegaray, which called forth such ardent praise\r\nfrom his countrymen, who would rank him with Calderon and Lope de\r\nVega of the past centuries, are trivial in literary value beside two\r\nof later years, _The Great Galeoto_ and _The Son of Don Juan_. Eleven\r\nyears separated these two strong dramas (1881-1892) during which the\r\nauthor continued to write plays, some with historical setting like\r\n_Harold the Norman_ and _Lysander the Bandit_; others were of romantic\r\ntype, some tragedies and more comedies. In general, he sought to\r\nrevive romantic drama, to proclaim the sharp conflicts in life between\r\npassion and duty. His motives were often more pronounced than his\r\ncharacterization; his men and women were sometimes mere mechanisms,\r\nfighting their battles for honor and truth. There was a chivalrous\r\nnote in his lines where domestic fidelity formed the keynote of the\r\nemotional struggle. Soliloquy was much used by this dramatist.\r\n\r\nWhen _The Son of Don Juan_ and _Mariana_ were translated, and linked in\r\nthe memory of English readers with _The Great Galeoto_, world-critics\r\ngave study to this forceful Spanish dramatist who had grown in favor\r\nduring the decade from 1890 to 1900. Two characteristics of _The Great\r\nGaleoto_ were noted: the fearless, vigorous portrayal of the evil of\r\ngossip and resultant tragedy; the fact that the chief personage in\r\nthe play exercised occult influence and did not appear on the stage.\r\nHe is the “busybody,” who creates all the troublesome situations,\r\nwho directs the characters (or suggests their words) but he is not\r\npresent. Elizabeth Wallace, in an article of value in the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_, September, 1908, on “The Spanish Drama of Today,” says: “This\r\nvanishing hero is the cruel, careless world, hastening eagerly to cast\r\nthe first stone, and, so soon tired of the sport, hurrying on to find\r\nsome new excitement, leaving death and destruction in its wake.”[149]\r\nThis culprit is the city of Madrid (or society anywhere). There are\r\nindividualized characters like Theodora and Don Julian; Don Severo, the\r\nplotter, may well be compared to Iago.\r\n\r\nEven more virile than this romantic tragedy is _The Son of Don Juan_;\r\nit suggests Ibsen’s _Ghosts_, both in germ-idea and _dénouement_,\r\nalthough it has distinctive merit. Echegaray borrowed the words of the\r\nNorwegian dramatist for the lines of Lazarus, “Mother, give me the\r\nsun!” In the Prologue the Spanish author expands these symbolic words\r\nto “enfold a world of ideas, an ocean of sentiments, a hell of sorrows,\r\na cruel lesson, a supreme warning to society and to the family circle.”\r\nSociety is, again, at the bar of justice, as in _The Great Galeoto_;\r\nthe offense this time is lax morality of parent, and the lunacy which\r\nfalls, in retribution, on the child. The mother of Lazarus is a\r\nconvincing character. In _Mariana_ are found some of the strongest\r\ndelineations in Echegaray’s dramas, notably Clara, wife of Don Castulo,\r\nthe grotesque archeologist, and Mariana, the widow, with riches in\r\nAmerica, described by Clara (in a touch of jealousy, yet appreciation)\r\nas “a widow who is hardly a widow and is almost a child.” The latter\r\nwoman is capricious, disdainful, yet passionate in her relations with\r\nher lover, Daniel. Melodrama enters somewhat into the closing scenes of\r\nintrigue and excitement. James Graham has translated both _Mariana_ and\r\n_The Son of Don Juan_.\r\n\r\nEchegaray continued to write plays, stimulated by the recognition\r\nand the honors of 1904. When the award was made, there was a popular\r\ndemonstration in Madrid; the king presided and presented the prize,\r\nwhile speeches were made by Galdós, Valera, and Mendenez Palayo, who\r\nhad once been his bitter critic. On this occasion Palayo said: “For\r\nthirty years Echegaray has been the dictator, arbiter and idol of the\r\nmultitude, a position impossible to attain without the strength of\r\ngenius, which triumphs in literature as everywhere.”[150] He was much\r\nhonored in France and called “a second Victor Hugo.” It has not been\r\neasy for American students to interpret the plays by Echegaray; they\r\nfail to understand fully, especially on the stage, the situations\r\nand sentiments of the Spanish dramatist. Many of the keen, brilliant\r\nlines, both of analysis and wit, suffer in translation into English.\r\nFor Drama League readings, or group study and discussion, his plays\r\nlend themselves to interpretation and study. This is true, not alone\r\nthe longer and familiar dramas already noted but such short plays as\r\n_Always Ridiculous_, translated by T. W. Gilkyson,[151] and _The Street\r\nSinger_, translated by John Garrett Underhill[152] and included in\r\nFrank Shay’s _25 Short Plays_ of international selection (New York,\r\n1925). Irony and wistfulness are mingled in this dramatic picture of\r\nthe little beggar-girl, Suspiros, of Augustias, the street singer, and\r\nher lover, Pepe. Suspiros, sixteen and pretty but sickly, speaks to\r\nColeta, a professional beggar of fifty years:[153]\r\n\r\n  _Coleta._ You don’t know how to beg.\r\n\r\n  _Suspiros._ Yes, sir, I know how to beg; the trouble is, people don’t\r\n  know how to give. I say, “A penny for my poor mother who is sick.”\r\n  And you ought to see how sick she is! She died two years ago. Well,\r\n  I get nothing. Or else I say, “A penny for God’s sake, for my mother\r\n  who is in the hospital, in the name of the Blessed Virgin! I have two\r\n  baby brothers.” No one gives, either.\r\n\r\n  _Coleta._ They don’t, eh? And how many brothers are you going to have\r\n  to-night?\r\n\r\n  _Suspiros._ Ay, Signor Coleta! I had two and nobody gave me anything.\r\n  Last night I tried four and I got sixpence, so to-night I mean to\r\n  have five and see what they give me, or whether I just get the cuff\r\n  from my mother.\r\n\r\n  _Coleta._ Just in the family, how many brothers have you, really?\r\n\r\n  _Suspiros._ Really, I had two. But they died, like my mother. Ay!\r\n  they died because of the way my stepmother treated them--as she does\r\n  me--and I am dying! Listen! If I can make two or three dollars I am\r\n  going to run away to Jativa, and live with my aunt.\r\n\r\nEchegaray was seventy-two years old when he gained the prize; he\r\nwas already called by some critics a “representative of the older\r\ngeneration.” Interest in his plays, however, has gained rather than\r\nwaned, among critical scholars in every country, and his rank is\r\nassured among the romantic dramatists of this century. His seriousness,\r\ncombined with keen wit and insight, has been compared with similar\r\ntraits of Tolstoy. Both writers have emphasized the “dignity of\r\nsuffering” for the sake of spiritual freedom. This is exampled in\r\nEchegaray’s _Madman or Saint_, already cited. Conscientious and sincere\r\nin his work, this Spanish dramatist has left a few plays of strong\r\ncharacterization and potent message to society, a message that has an\r\nelement of idealism, flashing out amid the grim realities of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACINTO BENAVENTE\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1922 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  Benavente, Jacinto, dramatic writer, Madrid, born 1866: “for the\r\n  happy way in which he has pursued the honored traditions of the\r\n  Spanish drama.”[154]\r\n\r\nJacinto Benavente, to whom the Nobel prize was given in 1922, was\r\nacclaimed as especially worthy by those who sought for a representative\r\nof “the new generation” in Spanish drama--what was known as “the\r\ngeneration of 1898” which decried past methods and urged modern themes\r\nand viewpoints. Benavente was born in Madrid in 1866, a generation\r\nyounger than Echegaray. His father was a prominent physician and the\r\nboy had stimulating home environment. He studied law for a brief time\r\nbut he inclined towards writing and the theatre. He had some actual\r\nexperiences “on the road” with theatrical troupes and with a circus,\r\nthus gaining first-hand information about theatrical devices and the\r\nneeds of both actors and audiences. His first venture in print was as\r\na poet, in 1893, but the next year he published a play, _Thy Brother’s\r\nHouse_. This and other immature plays received scanty notice until,\r\nin 1896, appeared _In Society_. Two years later _The Banquet of Wild\r\nBeasts_ focussed attention upon this daring, brilliant playwright. He\r\nbecame a leader among young professional men in Madrid who, following\r\nthe Spanish-American War, were eager to renounce tradition and to\r\nrevolutionize society by exposing its vices and weaknesses. They would\r\npunctuate “modernism” in thought and expression with ideals of poetry.\r\nA summary of this is found in _A Study of the Modern Drama_ by Barrett\r\nH. Clark (New York, 1925).\r\n\r\nBenavente is less radical than some of his literary associates in\r\nSpain, France, and Russia. He does not disdain “traditions,” if they\r\nring true to life and art. He is graceful and versatile, writing plays\r\nof manner and characterization, satires on aristocracy and sympathetic\r\nscenes of peasant life. He compels his readers or spectators to\r\n_think_, if they will get stimulus from his plays like _The Truth_,\r\n_Autumnal Roses_, _The Magic of an Hour_, and _Field of Ermine_.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, Benavente was elected to membership in the Spanish Academy.\r\nHe is widely quoted on educational and political, as well as literary\r\naffairs. He has ideals for a greater freedom than now exists in Spain\r\nand other European countries. He has traveled widely, seeing his plays\r\nperformed and making friends in Russia, England, South America, and\r\nthe United States. _The Passion Flower_ (_La Malquerida_), the tragedy\r\nof peasant life with colorful setting and tense emotion, has been\r\npopular in America, as a film, and as a play with Nance O’Neil as\r\nactress. The Theatre Guild of New York and the Jewish Art Theatre gave\r\ncareful study to the interpretation of _The Bonds of Interest_. As in\r\nmany of his plays the serious lesson is not stressed to interfere with\r\nthe artistry. One of his best characterizations is Nevé, heroine of\r\n_El Hombrecito_, often compared to Ibsen’s Nora of _A Doll’s House_.\r\nBenavente believes that the inner meaning of a play must be revealed\r\nby the mind or emotions of the spectator or reader. He is deeply\r\nindebted--a debt which English and American readers share--for the\r\nintuitive, careful translations and editing of several series of his\r\nplays by John Garrett Underhill (Scribner’s, New York, 1917-1925).\r\nOnly in such interpretation can one fully appreciate the strength and\r\nfineness of character-drawing, the satirical thesis, the fantasy and\r\npoetry blended in such plays as _The Governor’s Wife_, _The Prince\r\nWho Learned Everything out of Books_, _Saturday Night_, _The Other\r\nHonor_, and _The Necklace of Stars_, with its fanciful charm and\r\nsermonic lesson of love to one’s neighbor. In Ernest Boyd’s _Studies\r\nfrom Ten Literatures_ there is a good summary of his life and work\r\nwhich includes 144 plays. Mr. Boyd raises the question, “Has he been\r\noverestimated?” Possibly it is an echo of French criticism. Valuable\r\nmaterial is found, also, in Storm Jameson’s _Modern Drama in Europe_\r\nand _A Study of the Modern Drama_ by Barrett H. Clark (New York,\r\n1925). A new intensive study is _Jacinto Benavente_ by Walter Starkie\r\n(New York, 1925).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y._\r\n\r\nJACINTO BENAVENTE]\r\n\r\n_Expressionism_ classifies the work of dramatists like Benavente,\r\nMolnar, and Capek. The methods used by the Spanish playwright to embody\r\nthis principle are to “generalize” both the action and his characters,\r\nso that they become symbols of real life, appealing to the subjective\r\nelement in readers. He has declared that, henceforth, he intends to\r\nwrite plays for publication and not for the theatre.... “The only way\r\nin which a play may be appreciated thoroughly is by being read,” he\r\nsays. “I have written more than a thousand parts, yet of that number\r\nI can recall perhaps five which I have recognized as being truly the\r\ncharacters I had conceived, when they stepped upon the stage. I have\r\nnot even seen some of my plays.”[155] This stress upon the futility\r\nof staging plays that should be interpreted by the reader’s own\r\nimagination and mind, is not unlike that by Maeterlinck, already noted\r\nin a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nBenavente not infrequently uses puppets in place of real characters\r\nto convey his inner meanings. Sometimes they are given real names but\r\nthey are not the _true_ characters he wishes the reader to discover\r\nin them, as in the first scenes of _The Bonds of Interest_. In a\r\nbrief parable-play, _The Magic of an Hour_,[156] he has two symbolic\r\ncharacters, “A Merveilleuse” and “An Incroyable,” two porcelain\r\nfigures upon columns that converse about life and love, books and\r\nflowers, poetry and music. In this adroit, short comedy the author has\r\ninterwoven some thoughts that express that peculiar idealism which is\r\nhis, that contrast between weak humanity and the craving “for something\r\nwhich is not ourselves, and yet which is the breath of living.” The\r\nnearest approach to this ideal is love, which can transform, “by the\r\nmagic of an hour,” evil, men-beasts, cowards, “devils in crime,” into\r\n“spirits of light, luminous with a divine wisdom through all instincts\r\nof the beast.”[157] In sentences of such groping faith, such idealism\r\nof the “inner eye,” scattered through the hundred and more plays by\r\nJacinto Benavente, one may establish, in a measure, his right to the\r\nNobel prize. With this is blended what Storm Jameson calls his “divine\r\nsanity.” On the score of literary achievement, he is an artist,\r\nversatile and sincere, delicate and yet vigorous in his workmanship.\r\nHis plays vary in value for the student of drama; some of the later\r\ntitles, like _A Pair of Shoes_ or _Doubtful Virtue_, indicate the\r\ntypes of psychological plays among Continental playwrights. In his\r\nfiner, more characteristic plays, however, there are vital expressions\r\nof idealism. Mr. John Garrett Underhill (in a letter to the author of\r\nthis book) says, “Benavente is an idealist of the highest type and\r\nhis philosophy is best and most explicitly stated in _The School of\r\nPrincesses_ and _Field of Ermine_--service and sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1904.\r\n\r\n[148] See _A Study of Modern Drama_ by Barrett H.

YEATS AND HIS PART IN THE CELTIC REVIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1923 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  Yeats, William Butler, born 1865: “for his consistently emotional\r\n  poetry, which in the strictest artistic form expresses a people’s\r\n  spirit.”[158]\r\n\r\nIn the book, _Ideals in Ireland_, edited by Lady Gregory (London and\r\nNew York, 1901), the editor speaks of the various contributors to this\r\nrevival of letters including George Moore, Æ (George Russell), Douglas\r\nHyde and W. B. Yeats as “candle-stick makers.” Unlike the “butcher and\r\nthe baker,” who have their daily newspaper and appointed tasks that are\r\nappreciated, this type of worker, who makes and holds the candle, is\r\nnot so well served. He is the _idealist_ who finds himself, too often,\r\nignored or maligned; he searches out the “dark places of the earth”;\r\nhe is the seer, seeking for truth, aspiration, idealism. This analogy\r\nholds good for many of the winners of the Nobel prizes--Björnson,\r\nMistral, Tagore, Maeterlinck, Selma Lagerlöf, Heidenstam, Rolland. By\r\nuniversal consent of readers the name of W. B. Yeats would be added to\r\nthis list, the winner of 1923. With delicate imagery Lady Gregory has\r\nexpressed the subtle gift of this Irish poet-dramatist, his ability to\r\ncatch “the will o’ the wisp fire, miscalled evanescent,” which is the\r\nmark of universal idealism. In his paper, contributed to this book,\r\n_Ideals in Ireland_, Mr. Yeats writes a brief “History of the Literary\r\nMovement” in his country and asks whether this revival of folklore and\r\npoetry of the soil, which is called the Celtic revival, will become a\r\npart of the intellectual and social development of Ireland. These words\r\nwere written in 1899; the quarter century since then has answered the\r\nquestion in the affirmative and has accorded to Mr. Yeats a large share\r\nin this appreciation of simple beauty, love, and chivalry. The names of\r\nDonn Byrne and Padraic Colum, James Stephens and Winifred Letts, Lord\r\nDunsany and St. John Ervine, suggest some of the poets and playwrights,\r\n“the candle-holders,” who have followed the inspiring leadership of\r\nLady Gregory, John Synge, Dr. Douglas Hyde, and W. B. Yeats, weaving\r\ntheir romances and poems about old ballads and folklore of the\r\n“sage-cycles” of Irish literary history. In this Gaelic literature are\r\nsongs of battles and of love, legends of saints and heroes, that have\r\nthe simplicity and musical vigor of old Greek odes and plays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photograph by Bain News Service_\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BUTLER YEATS]\r\n\r\nAs dramatist, certain critics will aver, with reason, that Synge was\r\ngreater than Mr. Yeats; as researcher among the peasantry for folk\r\ntales and forgotten poetry, Lady Gregory and Dr. Douglas Hyde may\r\ndeserve higher rank. In the writings of Mr. Yeats, however--lyrics,\r\nballads, and plays--there are three distinctive qualities: lyrical\r\nbeauty, mystical strains, blended wistfulness, and merriment. These\r\npoetic distinctions are found in many of his ballads, notably in “The\r\nHost of the Air,” “The Stolen Child,” and “The Fiddler of Dooney”; they\r\nform the literary warp of such plays as _The Land of Heart’s Desire_,\r\n_The Hour-Glass_, and _On Baile’s Strand_. In every edition of his\r\nplays Mr. Yeats has emphasized his indebtedness to Lady Gregory for\r\nassistance as well as inspiration. In his Notes to _Plays in Prose and\r\nVerse_ (New York, 1924) he acknowledges the sources of “the greater\r\nnumber of his stories,” as those found in Lady Gregory’s _Gods and\r\nFighting Men_ and _Cuchulain of Muirthemne_. He affirms that these\r\ntwo books have made the legendary tales of Ireland as familiar as\r\nare the stories of Sir Arthur and his Knights. Again, he records his\r\ngratitude to Lady Gregory for introducing him to firesides where he\r\nmight get “the true countenance of country life.” A third form of\r\nhelpfulness was the skill of this friend in her mastery of dialect and\r\nher generous work in revising the lines of Mr. Yeats in this detail\r\nof form. His own ability to evoke music and poetry from dreams and\r\ntraditions, and to portray the simple, domestic incidents of peasant\r\nlife, was coördinated with Lady Gregory’s aspiration and background of\r\nfolklore.\r\n\r\nThe father of William Butler Yeats was a well-known artist, John Butler\r\nYeats, R.H.A. The son, named for his paternal grandfather, was born\r\nat Sandymount, Dublin, June 15, 1865. His father’s family had been\r\nidentified with the church; the grandfather of the poet was Rector of\r\nTullylish Down. His mother’s father was a merchant and shipowner at\r\nSligo. The boy passed much time with these grandparents in the old\r\ntown by the sea. When he was of school age, he was living with his\r\nparents in London and went to the Godolphin School, Hammersmith. At\r\nfifteen he returned to Dublin, attending the Erasmus Smith School and\r\nliving with his relatives at Sligo. Memories of these early days are\r\ninterwoven with legends and fancies in _The Celtic Twilight_, and the\r\nnovel of autobiographical trend, _John Sherman_, which appeared under\r\nthe pseudonym of “Gauconagh.” Like his hero of this tale, Yeats was\r\nhomesick in London and longed to return to the environment of Sligo (or\r\nBallah), to the familiar streets, the rows of tumble-down cottages\r\nwith thatched roofs, the wharves covered with grass and the walls of\r\nthe garden where, it was said, the gardener used to see the ghost of\r\nthe former owner in the form of a rabbit.[159] In his poems he recalled\r\nthe waves dashing upon the cliffs, the island of Innisfree, and the\r\ndistant hills at sunset.\r\n\r\nHis father hoped he would become an artist and so continue the family\r\nprofession; the youth studied art for a brief time but he was restless\r\nand unproductive. He preferred to browse in libraries, reading\r\ntranslations--or making them--from Gaelic tales and poems. Even more he\r\nliked to sit by the turf fires in old Connaught and listen to the folk\r\ntales of the peasantry. The first poem in his collection of 1906, is\r\naddressed “To Some I Have Talked With By the Fire.” Here he saw again,\r\nin reverie, the ghostly companions and heard the weird tales of\r\n\r\n                  the dark folk who lived in souls\r\n    Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nineteen his first poem, “The Island of Statues,” was\r\npublished in the _Dublin University Review_. With other young men at\r\nthe University he became interested in a Brahmin, who was in London;\r\non their invitation he came to Dublin to teach his philosophy. This\r\nyearning towards the occult was natural for a temperament like that\r\nof Yeats. He recalled that they fed the Brahmin a plate of rice or an\r\napple every day and listened to his expositions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Katherine Tynan Hinkson, a friend of Yeats in young manhood\r\nand later life, in her _Twenty-Five Years; Reminiscences_ has given\r\ninteresting stories of his zest in reciting his poems, even in the\r\nmiddle of the night and of his dreamy, gentle nature. In 1889, _The\r\nWanderings of Oison_ established the fame of the young Irish lyrist.\r\nBesides the title-poem here were “The Stolen Child” and “The Madness\r\nof King Goll.” Influences of Tom Moore were traceable in a poem, with\r\nlilting rhymes, like “Down by the Salley Gardens,” pictorial and\r\nsentimental. In London, after the poems were published, Yeats was\r\nstill homesick, although he made congenial friends at the Cheshire\r\nCheese--Arthur Symons, Lionel Johnson, and W. E. Henley, who obtained\r\nfor him a commission to write some topics about Ireland for Chambers’\r\n_Encyclopedia_. His interest was strong in varied “cults” and forms of\r\nsymbolism which he revealed in his poems, _The Wind Among the Reeds_,\r\nand the essays, _Ideas of Good and Evil_.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeats is both lyrist and playwright; to the latter type of writing\r\nhe owes his recognition by students of the drama in every country;\r\nthe two qualities are interwoven in his plays. George Moore, Lady\r\nGregory, Forrest Reid, his critic and biographer, and others have\r\nstressed his large part in the success, as well as the inception, of\r\nthe Abbey Theatre, “a gift of immense and national importance upon\r\nIreland.”[160] One would not minimize the work of Lady Gregory and\r\nDouglas Hyde, of William Fay and Florence Farr and Miss Horniman, who\r\ncontributed as actors, playwrights, and financial supporters. The\r\nassurance of this theater for performance of his plays gave incentive\r\nto the dramatic impulse of Yeats. He created new plots and utilized\r\nfolk tales interwoven with fantasy and poetry. With the aid of Lady\r\nGregory and Edward Martyn, he won success with plays like _The Pot of\r\nBroth_, _Cathleen ni Hoolihan_, _The King’s Threshold_, _The Land of\r\nHeart’s Desire_, _Deirdre_ and _The Hour-Glass_. This last play, first\r\nin prose, later in verse, is a masterpiece of the morality-play; the\r\nWise Man, faced with death within an hour, goes desperately in search\r\nfor “one person who believes in God and Heaven,” so that he may go\r\nto Paradise. Only in Teague, the fool, who has learned his lessons,\r\n_not_ in the schools of the Wise Men but in the _woods_, can he find\r\nsuch assurance. In later versions of this play the author introduced a\r\nstrange Gaelic ballad.\r\n\r\nIn his Notes to the volume of _Plays in Prose and Verse_, recently\r\nreissued (New York, 1924), Mr. Yeats gives credit for the first use\r\nof correct dialect to Synge’s _Riders to the Sea_ and Lady Gregory’s\r\n_Spreading the News_. In this same Note he declares that his words\r\n“never flow freely but when people speak in verse”: it need not be\r\nrhymed verse, for some of the finest lines in _Deirdre_ and _The\r\nKing’s Threshold_ are _rhythmical_ but not in rhyme. In _The Land of\r\nHeart’s Desire_ the poet-playwright’s words all “flow freely.” This\r\nis a general favorite among his plays with professionals and amateurs\r\nupon the stage. Forrest Reid may be extreme in praise when he calls\r\nit “the most beautiful thing that has been done in our time,” for it\r\ninvites comparison with _The Sunken Bell_, _Peter Pan_, and _The Blue\r\nBird_ among poetic, fanciful plays. It lingers in memory, however, as\r\npictorial and dramatic, simple and beautiful in May Eve legends and\r\n“fairy spell,” in the natural characters, well contrasted, of Maire\r\nBruin and her husband, Shawn, of Father Hart and the old parents by the\r\nfireside. That is an exquisite couplet that Maire speaks to her sturdy\r\nhusband, when the fairy calls,\r\n\r\n    O you are the great door-post of this house,\r\n    And I the red nasturtium climbing up.[161]\r\n\r\n_The Shadowy Waters_ is another symbolic play, with an undertone of\r\nidealism. Begun when Yeats was young, it changed form often before the\r\npoet was satisfied. Into this he has introduced varied types--the magic\r\nharpist, the sailors, and Dectora, the restless, craving woman. The\r\nking, Forgel, who cares not for gold or fame, voices some tenets of the\r\nauthor’s creed in the lines:\r\n\r\n                        All would be well\r\n    Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,\r\n    And get into their world that to the sense\r\n    Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly\r\n    Among substantial things; for it is dreams\r\n    That lift us to the flowing, changing world\r\n    That the heart longs for.[162]\r\n\r\nMr. Yeats has ever been a dreamer-poet; he said once that, if our\r\ndreams could all come true, there might not be any poetry to be\r\nwritten; so we are told by his biographer, Forrest Reid. Many of\r\nhis dreams are embodied in his lyrics, his plays, his short stories\r\nand sketches, and his essays, _Ideas of Good and Evil_. _The Celtic\r\nTwilight_ and _The Secret Rose_ contain some of his most fanciful,\r\npoetic tales; “The Binding of the Hair” is an example of his highest\r\nart in this form. Dreams of love and service are found in the volumes\r\nof poems, like _The Wind Among the Reeds_, _In the Seven Woods_,\r\n_The Wild Swans at Coole_, and _Responsibilities_. These separate\r\ncollections are now appearing in the uniform edition of his _Works_\r\n(Macmillan). Like Keats and William Blake, Mr. Yeats has been\r\ncriticized for the lack of human contacts; he has been accused of\r\nmore interest in and sympathy with waves and winds, with trees and\r\nfairy-lore than with deep human emotions. His absorption emotionally\r\nseems to be in lyrical and spiritual rhapsodies. In reading a love\r\nlyric, like “A Poet to His Beloved,” one feels that the dreams and\r\nthe words are more ardent than the passion of love. One of the best\r\ninterpretive essays ever written upon Shelley is found in _Ideas of\r\nGood and Evil_; these two poets were alike in many moods, in their\r\ndelicate, elusive fancies. In the exquisite diction of some of his\r\nlines, and the fluctuating moods that affect his themes and modes of\r\nexpression, Mr. Yeats seems to me comparable to Thomas Bailey Aldrich\r\nand such delicate lyrics, as “Nocturne” and “A Mood.”\r\n\r\nIn these later years Mr. Yeats has carried his ideals into more\r\nactive life; he has undertaken _Responsibilities_ other than poetic\r\nexpression. He has been deeply concerned about the future of Ireland\r\nand has been a member of the Senate of the Irish Free State. He has\r\nbecome a leader in political and educational, as well as literary,\r\nmovements. Through the _Daily Express of Dublin_, he entered the lists\r\nof combatants against Bernard Shaw and his adherents who maintained\r\nthat “poetry is a criticism of life.” In expanded thought upon this\r\nidea, in _Literary Ideals in Ireland_, Mr. Yeats has prophesied that,\r\nas the years pass, the function of poetry as _criticism_ will be\r\ndiscarded; for it, will be substituted poetry as _revelation_ of life,\r\nsometimes in tangible forms, more often in idealistic spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1923.\r\n\r\n[159] John Sherman, pp. 88-90, and _W.

Björnson and Knut Hamsun, Heyse\r\nand Hauptmann, Echegaray and Benavente, Anatole France and Rolland,\r\nHenryk Sienkiewicz and Ladislaw Reymont are examples of such awards.\r\nAnother inference from the lists of winners is that the adjudicators\r\nwish to recognize the aspirations and achievements of small countries\r\nthat are too often overlooked upon the map of world literature. Thus\r\nDenmark and Switzerland, Ireland and Belgium have shared with the\r\nso-called “great nations” of Europe. Twice has Poland been selected\r\nfor recognition. The very name suggests struggle and oppression on\r\none hand, hope and faith in ultimate right on the other. In spite of\r\ntragic sadness, the messages of Poland in art and literature have been\r\nvital and lofty in idealism. Some of the melancholy and passionate\r\nyearning of later Poland has been expressed in the poets Michievicz\r\nand Slowacki, who are allied in their moods with Chopin; the “Funeral\r\nMarch” was described by Liszt as “the murmuring plaint of a whole\r\nnation following the bier of its dearest hopes.”[164] In his book,\r\n_Poland Reborn_, with keen analysis of advance in education and\r\nliterary opportunities, Roy Devereux says, “Henceforward there will not\r\nbe need for Polish men of letters like Henryk Sienkiewicz, who belongs\r\nas much to Western Europe as to Poland, to seek the protection of a\r\nforeign flag for their literary labours.”[165] To Sienkiewicz came\r\nthe Nobel award in 1905, a surprise to European critics and a blow to\r\nRussian aspirants for the honor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Copyright, 1912, by Little, Brown and Company_\r\n\r\nHENRYK SIENKIEWICZ]\r\n\r\nBorn in Lithuania, at Wola Okrzejska, in 1846, he was sixty when\r\nhe received the prize; he was already known by translation to\r\ninternational readers. He belonged to a patrician family and was\r\neducated at the University of Warsaw until political conditions,\r\nfollowing the revolution of 1863, caused him to leave Poland for\r\nRussia, where he edited a journal at St. Petersburg. He wanted to know\r\nmore of the world so he traveled, in gypsy or Bohemian fashion, in\r\nSouthern Europe; in 1876 he came to America, to Los Angeles, seeking\r\nto found there a Polish Commonwealth of Utopian type. He had written\r\ntales and travel sketches under the pseudonym of “Litwos”--_Nobody\r\nis a Prophet in his own Country_ and _From the Notebook of a Posen_.\r\nHe wrote impressions of America for a Warsaw newspaper; among these\r\nearlier sketches were “Janko, the Musician,” “Across the Prairies,”\r\nand “In Tartar Captivity.” A later tale, “The Old Bell-Ringer,” was\r\npatriotic and wistful.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he returned to Poland where he faced sadness in the death\r\nof his wife with the panacea of work upon his trilogy of historical\r\nromances of Poland. For eight years he worked winters in Warsaw at\r\nlibraries and in his study, in summers in the Carpathian mountains.\r\nThe results were the long, imaginative but strictly historical tales\r\nof _With Fire and Sword_, relating events from 1647 to 1651, _The\r\nDeluge_, from 1652 to 1657, and _Pan Michael_, dealing with the Turkish\r\ninvasion and incidents from 1670 to 1674. This cycle of romances showed\r\nscholarship and dramatic ability, especially in the first and third\r\nstories of the trilogy. The background is panoramic; the dialogue is\r\nnatural in most places. The author visualized individuals and the\r\nPolish people, under sentiments of distress, fear, love, conflict,\r\nand aspiration. The qualities of honor, patriotism, and faith are\r\nemphasized in these portrayals of Poland, under successive invasions of\r\nCossacks, Swedes, and Turks. He idealized Poland and gave hope to his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nModern Poland was the setting for his next series of tales, _Without\r\nDogma_ and _Children of the Soil_. The former is pathological and\r\ntragic, the diary of Leon Ploszowski, aristocrat and bore, and his love\r\nfor his cousin, Aneila. The vices of modern society and self-indulgent\r\nforces are in sharp contrast with the heroes of the trilogy. For many\r\nyears he had studied early Christianity with its opposing force,\r\nPaganism. In 1896 he wrote his masterpiece, _Quo Vadis_, which has\r\nbeen called “an epochal book.” In many translations it was familiar to\r\nreaders before the Nobel prize was given to its author. Of somewhat\r\nsimilar trend was the later brief message, _Let Us Follow Him_, which\r\nappeared in a single book and is included in the collection of stories\r\nand sketches, _Hania_, in translations by C. W. Dynicwicz, Jeremiah\r\nCurtin, and Casimir Gonski.[166]\r\n\r\nThe confessed purpose of _Quo Vadis_ was to show “how God’s truth,\r\nbecause it is the only Truth, conquered pagan might.” The sustained\r\ninterest in this religio-historical novel is not gained by melodrama\r\nor sensational intrigues. It has breadth and dignity. The characters\r\nvary in vividness but among the outstanding photographs are Paul\r\nand Petronius, Ursus and Chilo, and the girl captive, Ligeia. He\r\ncalled the tale “A Narrative of the Time of Nero.” The background was\r\nconvincing but Nero was not successfully drawn; even such a master\r\nof characterization as Sienkiewicz could not make the Roman emperor\r\nvitally real to modern readers but he introduced several dramatic\r\nsituations that center about his baffling personality. The question\r\nof the title, “Whither goest thou?” was asked of the modern world of\r\nunrest and discord, even as it was asked in the days of the apostles;\r\nthe author felt the need of guides of to-day to hold up the banner of\r\nfaith and service.\r\n\r\nSympathy and spirituality were qualities found, not alone in _Quo\r\nVadis_ but in many other works in fiction by this Polish writer.\r\n_Knights of the Cross_, recounting the struggle between the Poles and\r\nLithuanians against the Teutons, is a favorite with many readers.\r\n_After Bread: a Story of Polish Emigrant Life in America_ (also\r\nentitled, _For Daily Bread_ and _Peasants in Exile_) is typical of his\r\ntales of emigration. _On the Field of Glory_ celebrates Sobieski’s\r\nrescue of Vienna. Few authors have been so fortunate in English\r\ntranslators as this Polish novelist. Jeremiah Curtin, S. A. Binion,\r\nand S. C. de Soissons are among the best known; they have given\r\nfine interpretations to his historical trilogy, his religious novel,\r\nand such other stories as _On the Field of Glory_, _On the Bright\r\nShore_, _In Desert and Wilderness_, _That Third Woman_, and _In Vain_.\r\nSienkiewicz lived until 1916, alert and productive, ever exemplifying\r\nthe word that he used in a criticism of Zola, “The novel should\r\nstrengthen life, not undermine it; ennoble it, not defile it; bring\r\ngood tidings, not evil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLADISLAW STANISLAW REYMONT\r\n\r\n  The prize of 1924 has been awarded:\r\n\r\n  To Reymont, Ladislaw, born 1868: “For his great epic, _The\r\n  Peasants_.”[167]\r\n\r\nAgain, a new generation has come “to hold the candle to light the dark\r\ncorners of the earth” in Poland, since Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote his\r\nnovels of historical and religious potency. A new group of authors\r\nhad come forward, many of them scarcely known outside their racial\r\nconfines. Among the better known of the representatives of “Young\r\nPoland” is Ladislaw Reymont to whom the Nobel prize was given in\r\n1924. A few weeks before this award was made public there appeared a\r\ntranslation of the first part of the four-volume novel, _The Peasants_\r\nby Reymont, with the title, _Autumn_ (Knopf, New York, 1925). The\r\ntranslator was Michael H. Dziewicki, Professor of English Literature\r\nat the University of Cracow. The book attracted meager attention\r\nuntil the Nobel prize was announced; then a furor of interest was\r\naroused in this first volume and those to appear since then--_Winter_,\r\n_Spring_, and _Summer_. Reymont had visited America twice but escaped\r\nmuch publicity. He had been translated into English as author of _The\r\nComedienne_ (1920), the tale of a girl who sought to be beautiful and\r\nfamous on the stage but ended in “philisticism.” Some of his short\r\nstories had been included in a collection of Polish tales, in the\r\nOxford University series of _World Classics_ (1921). An extract from\r\nhis industrial novel, _The Promised Land_, was used in the _Anthology\r\nof Modern Slavonic Literature_, edited by Paul Selver, in 1921. He has\r\nwritten more than a score of novels, and is well known and commended in\r\nGermany. Comparisons to Sienkiewicz reveal more pictorial skill, more\r\ndramatic vigor like that of Dumas, in the older writer, but a realistic\r\nforce of surpassing effects in Reymont.\r\n\r\nHis family was of the lower middle class. His father was a windmill\r\nowner in Kobiala Wielka, then in Russian Poland, where the author was\r\nborn in 1868. He went to the village school and attended to the cattle\r\nand farm work. One of the interpreters of Reymont to Americans has\r\nbeen Rupert Hughes; in the translation of his Preface to the German\r\nedition of _The Peasants_ we read,[168] “Reymont was born to be the\r\nepic poet of the Polish village. He is, in spite of his foreign name,\r\na child of that strange, uncouth world where he began his life among\r\ngoose boys and cowherders, where he drove the herds of his father, the\r\nvillage organist, and whence he has climbed to the rank of a beloved\r\nand recognized poet, spending a large part of his life in Paris, the\r\ncentre of modern culture.” Reymont attended some of the gymnasiums, or\r\nHigh Schools, but he was defiant to the Russian demand _not_ to speak\r\nin Polish; sometimes he was expelled.[169]\r\n\r\nSeveral trades and occupations gave Reymont experiences which he\r\nhas used in some of his fiction. He was a clerk in a store, railway\r\nemployee, telegraph operator, and longed to travel like the hero\r\nof _The Dreamer_. For a time he was actor in a small company whose\r\nreflections are found in _The Comedienne_ and _Lilly_. He was, also,\r\na novitiate with the Paulist Fathers for a time at Czenstochowa.\r\n_The Promised Land_, with scenes laid at Lotz and indications of\r\nrevolt against the capitalists and landowners (on the part of the\r\nproletariat) was a forerunner of his agrarian novel, _The Peasants_.\r\nThe earlier book has been compared with Zola’s _Germinal_ in intense\r\nnaturalism. In this long story, _The Peasants_, Reymont became the\r\n“mouthpiece of the peasant and rural elements.” Combined with Reymont’s\r\ndevotion to the peasant village as “protagonist,” is his passion for\r\nNature in her varied aspects; hence he made his divisions of the book\r\nto show the four seasons. Like Thomas Hardy and George Meredith he uses\r\nNature as a vital personality in his story, aiding or restraining the\r\ndevelopment of his leading characters, especially Yagna, who has been\r\ncalled “a Polish Tess.” The English author is superior in condensation\r\nand dramatic sympathy.\r\n\r\nTo use the Polish peasant as literary material is no exclusive trait of\r\nReymont; he has been portrayed by other writers like Ladislaw Orkan,\r\nJan Kasprowicz, and Stanislaw Prybyszewsski. In _The Peasants_ the slow\r\nmovement is varied by scenes of intense emotion, like the marriage\r\nfestival in _Autumn_, or the death of Kuba, like the passionate quest\r\nof Yagna and Antek in _Winter_, and the bitter fight between father and\r\nson, husband and lover of Yagna, or the tragic, gruesome scene of the\r\ndeath of the father, old Boryna, in the last pages of _Spring_. The\r\nmob-attack upon Yagna, at the close of _Summer_, grips the reader and\r\nmakes a strong climax to the epical story. In addition to specific,\r\nhaunting situations, there are interwoven customs and legends and\r\na wonderful collection of Polish proverbs (a mine of literature!).\r\nPassions of love and hate and revenge, the constant excess of vodka\r\nand clouded minds, fear of landlord and slumbering revolt against the\r\nloss of forest lands and oncoming industrial domination--such are\r\nsignificant factors in this panoramic novel. In the background is the\r\ndull color of the soil, the rank smells and fragrant odors of farmyards\r\nand woods, sunsets of splendor, and terrifying storms. One of the\r\nmost poetic, idealistic passages is the last chapter in _Autumn_, the\r\npassing of the soul of faithful Kuba, after his long years of service\r\nand keen suffering:\r\n\r\n  And higher yet it flew, and higher, yet higher, higher--yea, till it\r\n  set its feet--\r\n\r\n  Where man can hear no longer the voice of lamentation, nor the\r\n  mournful discords of all things that breathe--\r\n\r\n  Where only fragrant lilies exhale balmy odours, where fields of\r\n  flowers in bloom waft honey-sweet scents athwart the air; where\r\n  starry rivers roll over beds of a million hues; where night comes\r\n  never at all--[170]\r\n\r\nMany passages in this novel are repugnant to Anglo-Saxon æsthetic\r\ntastes, if one is unable to assimilate the raw sordidness of many\r\nmodern stories of the soil, with the passages of emotional vigor and\r\npoetic beauties. Reymont has revealed, in panoramic form, the life of\r\nthe Polish peasant, typified in the family and associates of Boryna;\r\nhe has treated his big theme with psychological insight, realistic\r\nphotography, and robust idealism. The first and second volumes seem\r\nmore spontaneous and dramatic than the later. He lacks condensation and\r\nincisiveness. An excellent review of the four volumes by Vida Scudder\r\nis in _The Atlantic Monthly_, August, 1925.\r\n\r\nReymont knows America far better than Americans know him or his books,\r\nbut the discrepancy is being remedied. He enjoys friendship with many\r\nmen of affairs and letters here, including Rupert Hughes, whose story,\r\n_What Will People Say?_ has been translated by Mme. Reymont, a fine\r\nlinguist, and published serially in the Warsaw _Gazeta_. Many critics\r\nhave noted the sincerity of Reymont as man and artist.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III, “Naturalism and Nationalism,” of the collected\r\nlectures, on _Modern Polish Literature_, by Roman Dyboski, Professor at\r\nCracow University,[171] there are interesting comments upon Reymont’s\r\nearlier work and his tendencies. His attempt at historical fiction,\r\nfollowing the lead of Sienkiewicz, was recorded in _The Year 1794_ but\r\nit was, says Professor Dyboski, a failure, the “bewildering mass of\r\ndetails obscured the outlines of the historical picture.” More adapted\r\nto his analytical skill are the earlier novels, _Ferments_ and _The\r\nDreamer_ (largely autobiographical in background), and the later, more\r\nimpersonal tales that deal with anarchists and political conditions,\r\n_The Vampire_ and _Opium Smokers_. Like other critics Professor\r\nDyboski ranks Stephen Zeromski as “supreme in the Polish novel\r\ntoday.” He compares him to Sienkiewicz; he has the dramatic power and\r\nconcentration which Reymont lacks. Zeromski is “a social pessimist”;\r\nlike Sienkiewicz he was a short-story writer at first, then turned\r\nto history for fictional themes, like _Lay of the Leader_ and has\r\nwritten more recently of contemporaneous conditions. With his faults of\r\ndiffuseness and unevenness of structure, Reymont is gifted in depicting\r\nthe small and large interests of the Polish peasant, in revealing their\r\naspirations and dormant passion for freedom.\r\n\r\nAs an example of “the novel of the soil,” so close to earth that\r\nthe reader often finds his senses are keen and that other faculties\r\nare almost dormant, this epic by Reymont proclaims him a masterful\r\ninterpreter of peasant life. In every volume there are lapses of\r\ninterest and diffuseness. In retrospect, however, the many monotonous\r\npages will be forgotten and the outstanding scenes of passionate love,\r\nhatred, suffering, and primitive ecstasy will remain in memory as\r\ntributes to this second Polish novelist who is listed among the Nobel\r\nprize winners in literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1905.\r\n\r\n[164] _Poland Reborn_ by Roy Devereux, London, 1922, p. 237.\r\n\r\n[165] _Ibid._, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[166] Chicago, 1898; Philadelphia, 1898.\r\n\r\n[167] Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in 1924.\r\n\r\n[168] By permission of Rupert Hughes.\r\n\r\n[169] Interview with Dr. A.
