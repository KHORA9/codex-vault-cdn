It consists of six parts and twenty-nine\r\nchapters. Few memories can cover this eventful period of American\r\nhistory. Commencing its career with the Republic, slavery grew with\r\nits growth and strengthened with its strength. The dark spectre kept\r\npace and company with liberty until separated by the sword. Beginning\r\nwith the struggle for restriction or extension of slavery, I have\r\nstriven to record, in the spirit of honest and impartial historical\r\ninquiry, all the events of this period belonging properly to my\r\nsubject. The development and decay of anti-slavery sentiment at the\r\nSouth; the pious efforts of the good Quakers to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the slaves; the service of Negroes as soldiers and\r\nsailors; the anti-slavery agitation movement; the insurrections of\r\nslaves; the national legislation on the slavery question; the John\r\nBrown movement; the war for the Union; the valorous conduct of Negro\r\nsoldiers; the emancipation proclamations; the reconstruction of the\r\nlate Confederate States; the errors of reconstruction; the results of\r\nemancipation; vital, prison, labor, educational, financial, and social\r\nstatistics; the exodus--cause and effect; and a sober prophecy of the\r\nfuture,--are all faithfully recorded.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years I am loath to part with the saddest task ever\r\ncommitted to human hands! I have tracked my bleeding countrymen\r\nthrough the widely scattered documents of American history; I have\r\nlistened to their groans, their clanking chains, and melting prayers,\r\nuntil the woes of a race and the agonies of centuries seem to crowd\r\nupon my soul as a bitter reality. Many pages of this history have been\r\nblistered with my tears; and, although having lived but a little more\r\nthan a generation, my mind feels as if it were cycles old.\r\n\r\nThe long spectral hand on the clock of American history points to the\r\ncompletion of the second decade since the American slave became an\r\nAmerican citizen. How wondrous have been his strides, how marvellous\r\nhis achievements! Twenty years ago we were in the midst of a great\r\nwar for the extinction of slavery; in this anniversary week I complete\r\nmy task, record the results of that struggle. I modestly strive to\r\nlift the Negro race to its pedestal in American history. I raise this\r\npost to indicate the progress of humanity; to instruct the present, to\r\ninform the future. I commit this work to the considerate judgment of\r\nmy fellow-citizens of every race, \"with malice toward none, and\r\ncharity for all.\"\r\n\r\n                                             GEO. W.

The memorial charged that the\r\nslave-trade was clandestinely carried on from various ports of the\r\nUnited States contrary to law; that under this wicked practice free\r\nColored men were often seized and sold as slaves; and that the\r\nfugitive-slave law of 1793 subjected them to great inconvenience and\r\nsevere persecutions. The memorialists did not request Congress to\r\ntranscend their authority respecting the slave-trade, nor to\r\nemancipate the slaves, but only to prepare the way, so that, at an\r\nearly period, the oppressed might go free.\r\n\r\nUpon a motion by Mr. Waln for the reference of the memorial to the\r\nCommittee on the Slave-trade, Rutledge, Harper, Lee, Randolph, and\r\nother Southern members, made speeches against such a reference. They\r\nmaintained that the petition requested Congress to take action on a\r\nquestion over which they had no control. Waln, Thacher, Smilie, Dana,\r\nand Gallatin contended that there were portions of the petition that\r\ncame within the jurisdiction of the Constitution, and, therefore,\r\nought to be received and acted upon. Mr. Rutledge demanded the yeas\r\nand nays; but in such a spirit as put Mr. Waln on his guard, so he\r\nwithdrew his motion, and submitted another one by which such parts of\r\nthe memorial as came within the jurisdiction of Congress should be\r\nreferred. Mr. Rutledge raised a point of order on the motion of the\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania that a \"part\" of the memorial could not be\r\nreferred, but was promptly overruled. Mr. Gray, of Virginia, moved to\r\namend by adding a declaratory clause that the portions of the\r\nmemorial, not referred, inviting Congress to exercise authority not\r\ndelegated, \"have a tendency to create disquiet and jealousy, and\r\nought, therefore, to receive the pointed disapprobation of this\r\nHouse.\" After some discussion, it was finally agreed to strike out the\r\nlast clause and insert the following: \"ought therefore to receive no\r\nencouragement or countenance from this House.\" The call of the roll\r\nresulted in the adoption of the amendment, with but one vote in the\r\nnegative by Mr. Thacher, of Maine, an uncompromising enemy of slavery.\r\nThe committee to whom the memorial was referred brought in a bill\r\nduring the session prohibiting American ships from supplying slaves\r\nfrom the United States to foreign markets.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of April, 1802, Georgia ceded the territory lying west of\r\nher present limits, now embracing the States of Alabama and\r\nMississippi. Among the conditions she exacted was the following:\r\n\r\n     \"That the territory thus ceded shall become a State, and be\r\n     admitted into the Union as soon as it shall contain sixty\r\n     thousand free inhabitants, or at an earlier period, if Congress\r\n     shall think it expedient, on the same conditions and\r\n     restrictions, with the same privileges, and in the same manner,\r\n     as provided in the ordinance of Congress of the 13th day of July,\r\n     1787, for the government of the western territory of the United\r\n     States: which ordinance shall, in all its parts, extend to the\r\n     territory contained in the present act of cession, the article\r\n     only excepted which forbids slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe demand was acceded to, and, as the world knows, Alabama and\r\nMississippi became the most cruel slave States in the United States.\r\n\r\nOhio adopted a State constitution in 1802-3, and the residue of the\r\nterritory not included in the State as it is now, was designated as\r\nIndiana Territory. William Henry Harrison was appointed governor. One\r\nof the earliest moves of the government of the new territory was to\r\nsecure a modification of the ordinance of 1787 by which slavery or\r\ninvoluntary servitude was prohibited in the territory northwest of the\r\nOhio River. It was ordered by a convention presided over by Gen.\r\nHarrison in 1802-3, that a memorial be sent to Congress urging a\r\nrestriction of the ordinance of 1787. It was referred to a select\r\ncommittee, with John Randolph as chairman. On the 2d of March, 1803,\r\nhe made a report by the unanimous request of his committee, and the\r\nportion referring to slavery was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The rapid population of the State of Ohio sufficiently evinces,\r\n     in the opinion of your committee, that the labor of slaves is not\r\n     necessary to promote the growth and settlement of colonies in\r\n     that region. That this labor--demonstrably the dearest of\r\n     any--can only be employed in the cultivation of products more\r\n     valuable than any known to that quarter of the United States;\r\n     that the committee deem it highly dangerous and inexpedient to\r\n     impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and\r\n     prosperity of the northwestern country, and to give strength and\r\n     security to that extensive frontier. In the salutary operations\r\n     of this sagacious and benevolent restraint, it is believed that\r\n     the inhabitants of Indiana will, at no very distant day, find\r\n     ample remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of\r\n     emigration.\"\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the subject-matter embodied in the memorial from the\r\nterritory of Indiana, the committee presented eight resolves, one of\r\nwhich related to the subject of slavery, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That it is inexpedient to suspend, for a limited\r\n     time, the operation of the sixth article of the compact between\r\n     the original States and the people and the States west of the\r\n     river Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nCongress was about to close its session, and, therefore, there was no\r\naction taken upon this report. At the next session it went into the\r\nhands of a new committee whose chairman was Cæsar Rodney, of Delaware,\r\nwho had just been elected to Congress. On the 17th of February, 1804,\r\nMr. Rodney made the following report:\r\n\r\n     \"That taking into their consideration the facts stated in the\r\n     said memorial and petition, they are induced to believe that a\r\n     qualified suspension, for a limited time, of the sixth article of\r\n     compact between the original States and the people and States\r\n     west of the river Ohio, might be productive of benefit and\r\n     advantage to said territory.\"\r\n\r\nAfter discussing other matters contained in the Indiana petition, the\r\ncommittee says, in reference to slavery:\r\n\r\n     \"That the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787, which\r\n     prohibited slavery within the said territory, be suspended in a\r\n     qualified manner for ten years, so as to permit the introduction\r\n     of slaves born within the United States, from any of the\r\n     individual States: _provided_, that such individual State does\r\n     not permit the importation of slaves from foreign countries;\r\n     _and_ provided _further_, that the descendants of all such slaves\r\n     shall, if males, be free at the age of twenty-five years, and, if\r\n     female, at the age of twenty-one years.\"\r\n\r\nThe House did not take up and act upon this report, and so the matter\r\npassed for the time being. But the original memorial, with several\r\npetitions of like import, came before Congress in 1805-6. They were\r\nreferred to a select committee, and on the 14th of February, 1806, Mr.\r\nGarnett, of Virginia, the chairman, made the following favorable\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n     \"That, having attentively considered the facts stated in the said\r\n     petitions and memorials, they are of opinion that a qualified\r\n     suspension for a limited time, of the sixth article of compact\r\n     between the original States and the people and States west of the\r\n     river Ohio, would be beneficial to the people of the Indiana\r\n     Territory. The suspension of this article is an object almost\r\n     universally desired in that Territory.\r\n\r\n     \"It appears to your committee to be a question entirely different\r\n     from that between Slavery and Freedom; inasmuch as it would\r\n     merely occasion the removal of persons, already slaves, from one\r\n     part of the country to another. The good effects of this\r\n     suspension, in the present instance, would be to accelerate the\r\n     population of that Territory, hitherto retarded by the operation\r\n     of that article of compact, as slave-holders emigrating into the\r\n     Western country might then indulge any preference which they\r\n     might feel for a settlement in the Indiana Territory, instead of\r\n     seeking, as they are now compelled to do, settlements in other\r\n     States or countries permitting the introduction of slaves. The\r\n     condition of the slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by\r\n     it, as it is evident, from experience, that the more they are\r\n     separated and diffused, the more care and attention are bestowed\r\n     on them by their masters--each proprietor having it in his power\r\n     to increase their comforts and conveniences, in proportion to the\r\n     smallness of their numbers. The dangers, too (if any are to be\r\n     apprehended), from too large a black population existing in any\r\n     one section of country, would certainly be very much diminished,\r\n     if not entirely removed. But whether dangers are to be feared\r\n     from this source or not, it is certainly an obvious dictate of\r\n     sound policy to guard against them, as far as possible. If this\r\n     danger does exist, or there is any cause to apprehend it, and our\r\n     Western brethren are not only willing but desirous to aid us in\r\n     taking precautions against it, would it not be wise to accept\r\n     their assistance?\r\n\r\n     \"We should benefit ourselves, without injuring them, as their\r\n     population must always so far exceed any black population which\r\n     can ever exist in that country, as to render the idea of danger\r\n     from that source chimerical.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy discussion of matters embodied in the Indiana\r\nmemorial, the committee recommended the following resolve on the\r\nquestion of slavery:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787,\r\n     which prohibits slavery within the Indiana Territory, be\r\n     suspended for ten years, so as to permit the introduction of\r\n     slaves born within the United States, from any of the individual\r\n     States.\"\r\n\r\nThe report and resolves were made the special order for the following\r\nMonday, but were never called up.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the next session, Gen. Harrison presented another\r\nletter, accompanied by several resolves passed by the Legislative\r\nCouncil and House of Representatives, urging the passage of a measure\r\nrestricting the ordinance of 1787. The letter and enclosures were\r\nreceived on the 21st of January, 1807, and referred to the following\r\nselect committee: Parke, of Indiana, chairman; Alston, North Carolina;\r\nMasters, New York; Morrow, Ohio; Rhea, Tennessee; Sandford, Kentucky;\r\nTrigg, Virginia.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February, 1807, the chairman, Mr. Parke, made the\r\nfollowing report in favor of the request of the memorialists [the\r\n_third_]. It was unanimous.\r\n\r\n     \"The resolutions of the Legislative Council and House of\r\n     Representatives of the Indiana Territory relate to a suspension,\r\n     for the term of ten years, of the sixth article of compact\r\n     between the United States and the Territories and States\r\n     northwest of the river Ohio, passed the 13th July, 1787. That\r\n     article declares that there shall be neither Slavery nor\r\n     involuntary servitude in the said Territory.\r\n\r\n     \"The suspension of the said article would operate an immediate\r\n     and essential benefit to the Territory, as emigration to it will\r\n     be inconsiderable for many years, except from those States where\r\n     Slavery is tolerated.\r\n\r\n     \"And although it is not considered expedient to force the\r\n     population of the Territory, yet it is desirable to connect its\r\n     scattered settlements, and, in admitted political rights, to\r\n     place it on an equal footing with the different States. From the\r\n     interior situation of the Territory, it is not believed that\r\n     slaves could ever become so numerous as to endanger the internal\r\n     peace or future prosperity of the country. The current of\r\n     emigration flowing to the Western country, the Territories should\r\n     all be opened to their introduction. The abstract question of\r\n     Liberty and Slavery is not involved in the proposed measure, as\r\n     Slavery now exists to a considerable extent in different parts of\r\n     the Union; it would not augment the number of slaves, but merely\r\n     authorize the removal to Indiana of such as are held in bondage\r\n     in the United States. If Slavery is an evil, means ought to be\r\n     devised to render it least dangerous to the community, and by\r\n     which the hapless situation of the slaves would be most\r\n     ameliorated; and to accomplish these objects, no measure would be\r\n     so effectual as the one proposed. The Committee, therefore,\r\n     respectfully submit to the House the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That it is expedient to suspend, from and after the\r\n     1st day of January, 1808, the sixth article of compact between\r\n     the United States and the Territories and States northwest of the\r\n     Ohio, passed the 13th day of July, 1787, for the term of ten\r\n     years.\"\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor this report was made a special order, but was\r\nnever taken up.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November, 1807, the President laid a letter from Gen.\r\nHarrison [probably the one already referred to], and the resolves of\r\nhis Legislature, before Congress, and that body referred them to a\r\nselect committee consisting of Franklin, of North Carolina; Ketchel,\r\nof New Jersey; and Tiffin, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November, Mr. Franklin made the following adverse\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n     \"The Legislative Council and House of Representatives, in their\r\n     resolutions, express their sense of the propriety of introducing\r\n     Slavery into their Territory, and solicit the Congress of the\r\n     United States to suspend, for a given number of years, the sixth\r\n     article of compact, in the ordinance for the government of the\r\n     Territory northwest of the Ohio, passed the 13th day of July,\r\n     1787. That article declares: 'There shall be neither Slavery nor\r\n     involuntary servitude within the said Territory.'\r\n\r\n     \"The citizens of Clark County, in their remonstrance, express\r\n     their sense of the impropriety of the measure, and solicit the\r\n     Congress of the United States not to act on the subject, so as to\r\n     permit the introduction of slaves into the Territory; at least,\r\n     until their population shall entitle them to form a constitution\r\n     and State government.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee, after duly considering the matter, respectfully\r\n     submit the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That it is not expedient at this time to suspend the\r\n     sixth article of compact for the government of the Territory of\r\n     the United States northwest of the river Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended in defeat the stubborn effort to secure a restriction of\r\nthe ordinance of 1787, and the admission of slavery into the Territory\r\nlying west of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, now comprising the\r\nStates of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress at the commencement of the session of\r\n1806-7, President Jefferson suggested to that body the wisdom of\r\nabolishing the African slave-trade. He said in this connection:\r\n\r\n     \"I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the\r\n     period at which you may interpose your authority,\r\n     constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States\r\n     from all further participation in those violations of human\r\n     rights which have so long been continued on the unoffending\r\n     inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation,\r\n     and the best interest of our country have long been eager to\r\n     proscribe.\"\r\n\r\nThis portion of the message was referred to a select committee; and in\r\ndue time they reported a bill \"to prohibit the importation or bringing\r\nof slaves into the United States or the territories thereof after the\r\n31st day of December, 1807.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Early, of Georgia, the chairman of the committee, inserted a\r\nclause into the bill requiring that all slaves illegally imported\r\n\"should be forfeited and sold for life for the benefit of the United\r\nStates.\" A long debate ensued and was conducted with fiery earnestness\r\nfrom beginning to end. It was urged in support of the above\r\nregulation, that nothing else could be done but to sell them; that it\r\nwould never do to release them in the States where they might be\r\ncaptured, poor, ignorant, and dangerous. It was said by the opponents\r\nof the measure, that Congress could not regulate the matter, as the\r\nStates had the reserved authority to have slavery, and were,\r\ntherefore, competent to say who should be free and who bond. It was\r\nsuggested, farther along in the debate, that Congress might order such\r\nslaves into such States as prohibited slavery, where they could be\r\nbound out for a term of years. After a great many able speeches the\r\nHouse refused to strike out the forfeiture clause by a vote of\r\nsixty-three to thirty-six. When the act was called up for final\r\npassage, it was amended by inserting a clause imposing a fine of\r\n$20,000, upon all persons concerned in fitting out a vessel for the\r\nslave-trade; and likewise a fine of $5,000, and forfeiture of the\r\nvessel for taking on board any Negro or Mulatto, or any person of\r\ncolor, in any foreign port with the intention of selling them in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nDuring these efforts at restriction the slave population was growing\r\ndaily. The census of 1810 showed that within a decade the slave\r\npopulation had sprung from 893,041, in 1800, to 1,191,364,--an\r\nincrease of 33 per cent. The following table exhibits this remarkable\r\nfact:\r\n\r\n  CENSUS OF 1810.--SLAVE POPULATION.\r\n\r\n  District of Columbia          5,395\r\n  Rhode Island                    108\r\n  Connecticut                     310\r\n  Pennsylvania                    795\r\n  Delaware                      4,177\r\n  New Jersey                   10,851\r\n  New York                     15,017\r\n  Louisiana                    34,660\r\n  Tennessee                    44,535\r\n  Kentucky                     80,561\r\n  Georgia                     105,218\r\n  Maryland                    111,502\r\n  North Carolina              168,824\r\n  South Carolina              196,365\r\n  Virginia                    392,518\r\n  Mississippi Territory        17,088\r\n  Indiana Territory               237\r\n  Louisiana Territory           3,011\r\n  Illinois Territory              168\r\n  Michigan Territory               24\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, 1817, Mississippi applied for admission into\r\nthe Union with a slave constitution. The provisions relating to\r\nslavery dispensed with grand juries in the indictment of slaves, and\r\ntrial by jury was allowed only in trial of capital cases.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1817-8, Congress was besieged by a large number\r\nof memorials praying for more specific legislation against the\r\nslave-trade. During the session the old fugitive-slave act was amended\r\nso as to make it more effective, and passed by a vote of eighty-four\r\nto sixty-nine. In the Senate, with several amendments, and heated\r\ndebate, it passed by a vote of seventeen to thirteen; but upon being\r\nreturned to the House for concurrence, the Northern members had heard\r\nfrom their constituents, and the bill was tabled, and its friends were\r\npowerless to get it up.\r\n\r\nIn 1818-9, Congress passed an act offering a premium of fifty dollars\r\nto the informer of every illegally imported African seized within the\r\nUnited States, and twenty-five dollars for those taken at sea. The\r\nPresident was authorized to have such slaves removed beyond the limits\r\nof the United States, and to appoint agents on the West Coast of\r\nAfrica to superintend their reception. An effort was made to punish\r\nslave-trading with death. It passed the House, but was struck out in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, 1819, the Secretary of the Navy transmitted to\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives copies of circular letters\r\nthat had been sent to the naval officers on the various stations along\r\nthe sea-coast of the slave-holding States. The following letter is a\r\nfair sample of the remainder:[1]\r\n\r\n     \"NAVY DEPARTMENT, January 22, 1811.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR:--I hear, not without great concern, that the law\r\n     prohibiting the importation of slaves has been violated in\r\n     frequent instances, near St. Mary's, since the gun-boats have\r\n     been withdrawn from that station.\r\n\r\n     \"We are bound by law, by the obligations of humanity and sound\r\n     policy, to use our most strenuous efforts to restrain this\r\n     disgraceful traffic, and to bring those who shall be found\r\n     engaged in it to those forfeitures and punishments which are by\r\n     law prescribed for such offences.\r\n\r\n     \"Hasten the equipment of the gun-boats which, by my letter of the\r\n     24th ultimo, you were directed to equip, and as soon as they\r\n     shall be ready, despatch them to St. Mary's with orders to their\r\n     commanders to use all practicable diligence in enforcing the law\r\n     prohibiting the importation of slaves, passed March 2, 1807,\r\n     entitled 'An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any\r\n     port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States from\r\n     and after the 1st day of January, 1808.' The whole of this law,\r\n     but especially the 7th section, requires your particular\r\n     attention; that section declares, that _any_ ship or vessel which\r\n     shall be found in any river, port, bay, or harbor, or on the high\r\n     seas, within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, or\r\n     hovering on the coast thereof, having on board any negro,\r\n     mulatto, or person of color, for the purpose of selling them as\r\n     slaves, or with intent to land the same in any port or place\r\n     within the jurisdiction of the United States, contrary to the\r\n     prohibition of the act, shall, together with her tackle, apparel,\r\n     and furniture, and the goods and effects which shall be found on\r\n     board the same, be forfeited and may be seized, prosecuted, and\r\n     condemned in any court of the United States having jurisdiction\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"It further authorizes the President of the United States to\r\n     cause any of the armed vessels of the United States to be manned\r\n     and employed to cruise on any part of the coast of the United\r\n     States, or territories thereof, and to instruct and direct the\r\n     commanders to seize, take, and bring into any port of the United\r\n     States, all such ships or vessels; and, moreover, to seize, take,\r\n     and bring into any port of the United States, all ships or\r\n     vessels _of the United States, wherever found on the high seas_,\r\n     contravening the provisions of the act, to be proceeded against\r\n     according to law.\r\n\r\n     \"You will, therefore, consider yourself hereby especially\r\n     instructed and required, and you will instruct and require all\r\n     officers placed under your command, to seize, take, and bring\r\n     into port, _any vessel of whatever nature_, found in any river,\r\n     port, bay, or harbor, or on the high seas, within the\r\n     jurisdictional limits of the United States, or hovering on the\r\n     coast thereof, having on board any negro, mulatto, or person of\r\n     color, for the purpose of selling them as slaves, or with intent\r\n     to land the same, contrary to law; and, moreover, to seize, take,\r\n     and bring into port, all ships or vessels _of the United States_,\r\n     wheresoever found on the high seas or elsewhere, contravening the\r\n     provisions of the law. Vessels thus to be seized, may be brought\r\n     into _any_ port of the United States; and when brought into port,\r\n     must, without delay, be reported to the district-attorney of the\r\n     United States residing in the district in which such port may be,\r\n     who will institute such further proceedings as law and justice\r\n     require.\r\n\r\n     \"Every person found on board of such vessels must be taken\r\n     especial care of.

G. CAMPBELL, _Commanding Naval Officer_,\r\n           Charleston, S. C.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, 1819, President Monroe sent the following\r\nmessage to Congress on the subject of the slave-trade:\r\n\r\n                           \"MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n     States_:\r\n\r\n     \"Some doubt being entertained respecting the true intent and\r\n     meaning of the act of the last session, entitled 'An Act in\r\n     addition to the Acts prohibiting the slave-trade,' as to the\r\n     duties of the agents, to be appointed on the coast of Africa, I\r\n     think it proper to state the interpretation which has been given\r\n     of the act, and the measures adopted to carry it into effect,\r\n     that Congress may, should it be deemed advisable, amend the same,\r\n     before further proceeding is had under it.\r\n\r\n     \"The obligation to instruct the commanders of all our armed\r\n     vessels to seize and bring into port all ships or vessels of the\r\n     United States, wheresoever found, having on board any negro,\r\n     mulatto, or person of color, in violation of former acts for the\r\n     suppression of the slave-trade, being imperative, was executed\r\n     without delay. No seizures have yet been made, but, as they were\r\n     contemplated by the law, and might be presumed, it seemed proper\r\n     to make the necessary regulations applicable to such seizures for\r\n     carrying the several provisions of the act into effect.\r\n\r\n     \"It is enjoined on the executive to cause all negroes, mulattoes,\r\n     or persons of color, who may be taken under the act, to be\r\n     removed to Africa. It is the obvious import of the law, that none\r\n     of the persons thus taken should remain within the United States;\r\n     and no place other than the coast of Africa being designated,\r\n     their removal or delivery, whether carried from the United States\r\n     or landed immediately from the vessels in which they were taken,\r\n     was supposed to be confined to that coast. No settlement or\r\n     station being specified, the whole coast was thought to be left\r\n     open for the selection of a proper place, at which the persons\r\n     thus taken should be delivered. The executive is authorized to\r\n     appoint one or more agents, residing there, to receive such\r\n     persons; and one hundred thousand dollars are appropriated for\r\n     the general purposes of the law.\r\n\r\n     \"On due consideration of the several sections of the act, and of\r\n     its humane policy, it was supposed to be the intention of\r\n     Congress, that all the persons above described, who might be\r\n     taken under it, and landed in Africa, should be aided in their\r\n     return to their former homes, or in their establishment at or\r\n     near the place where landed. Some shelter and food would be\r\n     necessary for them there, as soon as landed, let their subsequent\r\n     disposition be what it might. Should they be landed without such\r\n     provision having been previously made, they might perish. It was\r\n     supposed, by the authority given to the executive to appoint\r\n     agents residing on that coast, that they should provide such\r\n     shelter and food, and perform the other beneficent and charitable\r\n     offices contemplated by the act. The coast of Africa having been\r\n     little explored, and no persons residing there who possessed the\r\n     requisite qualifications to entitle them to the trust being known\r\n     to the executive, to none such could it be committed. It was\r\n     believed that citizens only, who would go hence, well instructed\r\n     in the views of their government, and zealous to give them\r\n     effect, would be competent to these duties, and that it was not\r\n     the intention of the law to preclude their appointment. It was\r\n     obvious that the longer these persons should be detained in the\r\n     United States in the hands of the marshals, the greater would be\r\n     the expense, and that for the same term would the main purpose of\r\n     the law be suspended. It seemed, therefore, to be incumbent on me\r\n     to make the necessary arrangements for carrying this act into\r\n     effect in Africa, in time to meet the delivery of any persons who\r\n     might be taken by the public vessels, and landed there under it.\r\n\r\n     \"On this view of the policy and sanctions of the law, it has been\r\n     decided to send a public ship to the coast of Africa with two\r\n     such agents, who will take with them tools and other implements\r\n     necessary for the purposes above mentioned. To each of these\r\n     agents a small salary has been allowed--fifteen hundred dollars\r\n     to the principal, and twelve hundred to the other. All our public\r\n     agents on the coast of Africa receive salaries for their\r\n     services, and it was understood that none of our citizens\r\n     possessing the requisite qualifications would accept these\r\n     trusts, by which they would be confined to parts the least\r\n     frequented and civilized, without a reasonable compensation. Such\r\n     allowance, therefore, seemed to be indispensable to the execution\r\n     of the act. It is intended, also, to subject a portion of the sum\r\n     appropriated, to the order of the principal agent, for the\r\n     special objects above stated, amounting in the whole, including\r\n     the salaries of the agents for one year, to rather less than one\r\n     third of the appropriation. Special instructions will be given to\r\n     these agents, defining, in precise terms, their duties in regard\r\n     to the persons thus delivered to them; the disbursement of the\r\n     money by the principal agent; and his accountability for the\r\n     same. They will also have power to select the most suitable place\r\n     on the coast of Africa, at which all persons who may be taken\r\n     under this act shall be delivered to them, with an express\r\n     injunction to exercise no power founded on the principle of\r\n     colonization, or other power than that of performing the\r\n     benevolent offices above recited, by the permission and sanction\r\n     of the existing government under which they may establish\r\n     themselves. Orders will be given to the commander of the public\r\n     ship in which they will sail, to cruise along the coast, to give\r\n     the more complete effect to the principal object of the act.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n     \"WASHINGTON, December, 17, 1819.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1818, the delegate from Missouri presented petitions from\r\nthe inhabitants of that territory, praying to be admitted into the\r\nUnion as a State. They were referred to a select committee, and a bill\r\nwas reported for the admission of Missouri as a State on equal footing\r\nwith the other States. The bill was read twice, when it was sent to\r\nthe Committee of the Whole, where it was permitted to remain during\r\nthe entire session. During the next session, on the 13th of February,\r\n1819, the House went into the Committee of the Whole with Gen. Smith,\r\nof Maryland, in the chair. The committee had two sittings during which\r\nthey discussed the bill. Gen. Tallmadge, of New York, offered the\r\nfollowing amendment directed against the life of the clause admitting\r\nslavery:\r\n\r\n     \"And provided that the introduction of slavery, or involuntary\r\n     servitude, be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes\r\n     whereof the party has been duly convicted, and that all children\r\n     born within the said State, after the admission thereof into the\r\n     Union, shall be declared free at the age of twenty-five years.\"\r\n\r\nA long and an able discussion followed, in which the authority of the\r\ngovernment to prohibit slavery under new State governments was\r\naffirmed and denied. On coming out of the Committee of the Whole, the\r\nyeas and nays were demanded on the amendment prohibiting the\r\nintroduction of slavery into Missouri, and resulted as follows: yeas,\r\n87,--only one vote from the South, Delaware; nays, 76,--ten votes\r\nfrom Northern States. Upon the latter clause of the amendment--\"and\r\nthat all children of slaves, born within the said State, after the\r\nadmission thereof into the Union, shall be declared free at the age of\r\ntwenty-five years\": yeas, 82,--one vote from Maryland; nays,\r\n78,--fourteen from Northern States. And thus the entire amendment of\r\nGen. Tallmadge was sustained, and being reported to the House, passed\r\nby a vote 98 to 56.\r\n\r\nThe bill reached the Senate on the 17th of February, and after its\r\nsecond reading was referred to a select committee. On the 22d of\r\nFebruary, the chairman, Mr. Tait, of Georgia, reported the bill back\r\nwith amendments, striking out the Tallmadge restriction clauses. The\r\nHouse went into the Committee of the Whole on the 27th of February, to\r\nconsider the bill, when Mr. Wilson, of New Jersey, moved to postpone\r\nthe further consideration of the bill until the 5th of March. It was\r\nrejected. The committee then began to vote upon the recommendations of\r\nthe select committee. Upon striking out the House amendment, providing\r\nthat all the children of slaves born within said State should be free,\r\netc., it was carried by a vote of 27 to 7, eleven Northern Senators\r\nvoting to strike out. The seven votes against striking out were all\r\nfrom free States.\r\n\r\nUpon the clause prohibiting servitude except for crimes, etc., 22\r\nvotes were cast for striking out,--five being from Northern States;\r\nagainst striking out, 16,--and they were all from Northern States.\r\n\r\nThus amended, the bill was ordered to be engrossed, and on the 2d of\r\nMarch--the last day but one of the session--was read a third time and\r\npassed. It was returned to the House, where the amendments were read,\r\nwhen Mr. Tallmadge moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. His\r\nmotion was rejected by a vote of: yeas, 69; nays, 74. But upon a\r\nmotion to concur in the Senate amendments, the House refused to\r\nconcur: yeas, 76; nays, 78. The Senate adhered to their amendments,\r\nand the House adhered to their disagreement by a vote of 76 to 66; and\r\nthus the bill fell between the two Houses and was lost.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion of the territory of Missouri, which was not\r\nincluded within the limits of the proposed State, was organized as a\r\nseparate territory, under the designation of the Arkansas Territory.\r\nAfter considerable debate, and several attempts to insert an amendment\r\nfor the restriction of slavery, the bill creating the territory of\r\nArkansas passed without any reference to slavery, and thus the\r\nterritory was left open to slavery, and also the State some years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional discussion of the slavery question aroused the\r\nanti-slavery sentiment of the North, which found expression in large\r\nand earnest meetings, in pungent editorials, and numerous memorials.\r\nAt Trenton, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and other places, the\r\nindignation against slavery was great. On December 3, 1819, a large\r\nmeeting was held in the State House at Boston, when a resolution was\r\nadopted to memorialize Congress on the subject of \"restraining the\r\nincrease of slavery in _new States_ to be admitted into the Union.\"\r\nThe memorial was drawn by Daniel Webster, and signed by himself,\r\nGeorge Blake, Josiah Quincy, James T. Austin, and others. The New York\r\nLegislature passed resolutions against the extension of slavery into\r\nthe territories and new States; and requested the Congressmen and\r\ninstructed the Senators from that State not to vote for the admission\r\nof any State into the Union, except such State should pledge itself to\r\nunqualified restriction in the letter and spirit of the ordinance of\r\n1787. These resolutions were signed on January 17, 1820.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of January the New Jersey Legislature followed in the same\r\nstrain, with six pertinent resolves, a copy of which the governor was\r\nrequested to forward \"to each of the senators and representatives of\r\nthis State, in the Congress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nPennsylvania had taken action on the 11th of December, 1819; but the\r\nresolves were not signed by Gov. William Findlay until the 16th of the\r\nmonth. The Legislature was composed of fifty-four Democrats and twenty\r\nWhigs, and yet there was not a dissenting vote cast.\r\n\r\nTwo Southern States passed resolutions,--Delaware and Kentucky: the\r\nfirst in favor of restriction, the last opposed to restriction.\r\n\r\nThe effort to secure the admission of Missouri with a slave\r\nconstitution was not dead, but only sleeping. The bill was called up\r\nas a special order on the 24th of January, 1820. It occupied most of\r\nthe time of the House from the 25th of January till the 19th of\r\nFebruary, when a bill came from the Senate providing for the admission\r\nof Maine into the Union, but containing a rider authorizing the people\r\nof Missouri to adopt a State constitution, etc., without restrictions\r\nrespecting slavery. The bill providing for the admission of Maine had\r\npassed the House during the early days of the session, and now\r\nreturned to the House for concurrence in the rider. The debate on the\r\nbill and amendments had occupied much of the time of the Senate. In\r\nthe Judiciary Committee on the 16th of February, the question was\r\ntaken on amendments to the Maine admission bill, authorizing Missouri\r\nto form a State constitution, making no mention of slavery: and\r\ntwenty-three votes were cast against restriction,--three from Northern\r\nStates; twenty-one in favor of restriction,--but only two from the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas offered a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of the sixth\r\narticle of the ordinance of 1787, and declaring its applicability to\r\nall that territory ceded to the United States by France, under the\r\ngeneral designation of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes north latitude, etc. But on the following\r\nday he withdrew his original amendment, and submitted the following:\r\n\r\n     \"_And be it further enacted_, That in all the territory ceded by\r\n     France to the United States, under the name of Louisiana, which\r\n     lies north of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, north latitude,\r\n     excepting only such part thereof as is included within the limits\r\n     of the State contemplated by this act, slavery and involuntary\r\n     servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the\r\n     party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is hereby\r\n     forever prohibited. Provided always, that any person escaping\r\n     into the same, from where labor or service is lawfully claimed in\r\n     any State or territory of the United States, such fugitive may be\r\n     lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her\r\n     labor or service as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble, of Ohio, offered a substitute, but it was rejected. The\r\nquestion recurring upon the passage of the amendment of Mr. Thomas,\r\nexcluding slavery from all the territory north and west of Missouri,\r\nit was carried by a vote of 34 to 20.\r\n\r\nThus amended, the bill was ordered to engrossment by a vote of 24 to\r\n20. On the 18th of February the bill passed, and this was its\r\ncondition when it came to the House. By a vote of 93 to 72 the House\r\nagreed not to leave the Missouri question on the Maine bill as a\r\nrider; but immediately thereafter struck out the Thomas Senate\r\namendment by a vote of 159 to 18. The House disagreed to the\r\nremaining Senate amendments, striking out the clause restricting\r\nslavery in Missouri by a vote of 102 to 68.\r\n\r\nThus rejected, the bill was returned to the Senate shorn of its\r\namendments. After four days of debate in the Senate it was decided not\r\nto recede from the attachment of the Missouri subject to the Maine\r\nbill; not to recede from the amendment prohibiting slavery west of\r\nMissouri, and north of 36° 30´ north latitude, and insisted upon the\r\nremaining amendments without division.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was returned to the House a motion was made to insist\r\nupon its disagreement to all but section nine of the Senate\r\namendments, and was carried by a vote of 97 to 76.\r\n\r\nThe Senate asked for a committee of conference upon differences\r\nbetween the two Houses, which was cheerfully granted by the House. On\r\nthe 2d of March, Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts, as chairman, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\n     \"1. The Senate should give up the combination of Missouri in the\r\n     same bill with Maine.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The House should abandon the attempt to restrict Slavery in\r\n     Missouri.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Both Houses should agree to pass the Senate's separate\r\n     Missouri bill, with Mr. Thomas's restriction or compromising\r\n     proviso, excluding Slavery from all territory north and west of\r\n     Missouri.\r\n\r\n     \"The report having been read,\r\n\r\n     \"The first and most important question was put, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"Will the House concur with the Senate in so much of the said\r\n     amendments as proposes to strike from the fourth section of the\r\n     [Missouri] bill the provision prohibiting Slavery or involuntary\r\n     servitude in the contemplated State, otherwise than in the\r\n     punishment of crimes?\"\r\n\r\nThe vote resulted as follows: For giving up restriction on Missouri,\r\nyeas, 90; against giving up restriction of slavery in Missouri, 87.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, of New York, offered an amendment to include Arkansas\r\nTerritory under the prohibition of slavery in the territory west and\r\nnorth of Missouri, but his amendment was cut off by a call for the\r\nprevious question. Then the House concurred in the Senate amendment\r\nexcluding forever slavery from the territory west and north of\r\nMissouri by a vote of 134 to 42! And on the following day the bill\r\nadmitting Maine into the Union was passed without opposition.\r\n\r\nThus the Northern delegates in Congress were whipped into line, and\r\nthus did the South gain her point in the extension of slavery in\r\nviolation of the sacred compact between the States contained in the\r\nordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nBut the struggle was opened afresh when Missouri presented herself for\r\nadmission on the 16th of November, 1820. The constitution of this new\r\nState, adopted by her people on the 19th of July, 1820, contained the\r\nfollowing resolutions which greatly angered the Northern members, who\r\nso keenly felt the defeat and humiliation they had Suffered so\r\nrecently:\r\n\r\n     \"The General Assembly shall have no power to pass laws, first,\r\n     for the emancipation of Slaves without the consent of their\r\n     owners, or without paying them, before such emancipation, a full\r\n     equivalent for such slaves so emancipated; and second: to prevent\r\n     _bona-fide_ emigrants to this State, or actual settlers therein,\r\n     from bringing from any of the United States, or from any of their\r\n     Territories, such persons as may there be deemed to be Slaves, so\r\n     long as any persons of the same description are allowed to be\r\n     held as Slaves by the laws of this State.\r\n\r\n     ... \"It shall be their duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws\r\n     as may be necessary,\r\n\r\n     \"First, to prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to, and\r\n     settling in, this State, under any pretext whatever.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the motion to admit the State the vote stood: yeas, 79, nays, 93.\r\nUpon a second attempt to admit her, with the understanding that the\r\nresolution just quoted should be expunged the vote was worse than\r\nbefore, standing: yeas, 6; nays, 146!\r\n\r\nThe House now rested, until a joint resolve, admitting her with but a\r\nvague and ineffective qualification, came down from the Senate, where\r\nit was passed by a vote of 26 to 18--six Senators from Free States in\r\nthe affirmative. Mr. Clay, who had resigned in the recess, and been\r\nsucceeded, as Speaker, by John W. Taylor, of New York, now appeared as\r\nthe leader of the Missouri admissionists, and proposed terms of\r\ncompromise, which were twice voted down by the Northern members, aided\r\nby John Randolph and three others from the South, who would have\r\nMissouri admitted without condition or qualification. At last, Mr.\r\nClay proposed a joint committee on this subject, to be chosen by\r\nballot--which the House agreed to by a vote of 101 to 55; and Mr. Clay\r\nbecame its chairman. By this committee it was agreed, that a solemn\r\npledge should be required of the Legislature of Missouri, that the\r\nconstitution of that State should not be construed to authorize the\r\npassage of any act, and that no act should be passed \"by which any of\r\nthe citizens of either of the States should be excluded from the\r\nenjoyment of the privileges and immunities to which they are entitled\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States.\" The joint resolution,\r\namended by the addition of this proviso, passed the House by 86 yeas\r\nto 82 nays; the Senate concurred (Feb. 27, 1821) by 26 yeas to 15\r\nnays--(all Northern but Macon, of N. C.). Missouri complied with the\r\ncondition, and became an accepted member of the Union. Thus closed the\r\nlast stage of the fierce Missouri controversy, which for a time seemed\r\nto threaten--as so many other controversies have harmlessly\r\nthreatened--the existence of the Union.\r\n\r\nBy this time there was scarcely a State in the North but that had\r\norganized anti-slavery, or abolition, societies. Pennsylvania boasted\r\nof a society that was accomplishing a great Work. Where it was\r\nimpossible to secure freedom for the enslaved, religious training was\r\nimparted, and many excellent efforts made for the amelioration of the\r\ncondition of the Negroes, bond and free. A society for promoting the\r\n\"_Abolition of Slavery_\" was formed at Trenton, New Jersey, on the 2d\r\nof March, 1786. It adopted an elaborate constitution, which was\r\namended on the 26th of November, 1788. It did an effective work\r\nthroughout the State; embraced in its membership some of the ablest\r\nmen of the State; and changed public sentiment for the better by the\r\nmethods it adopted and the literature it circulated. On the 15th of\r\nFebruary, 1804, it secured the passage of the following Act for the\r\ngradual emancipation of the slaves in the State:\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT FOR THE GRADUAL ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION 1. _Be it enacted by the Council and General Assembly of\r\n     this State, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the\r\n     same_, That every child born of a slave within this State, after\r\n     the fourth day of July next, shall be free; but shall remain the\r\n     servant of the owner of his or her mother, and the executors,\r\n     administrators, or assigns of such owner, in the same manner as\r\n     if such child had been bound to service by the trustees or\r\n     overseers of the poor, and shall continue in such service, if a\r\n     male, until the age of twenty-five years, and if a female, until\r\n     the age of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n     \"2. _And be it enacted_, That every person being an inhabitant of\r\n     this State, who shall be entitled to the service of a child born\r\n     as aforesaid, after the said fourth day of July next, shall\r\n     within nine months after the birth of such child, cause to be\r\n     delivered to the clerk of the county whereof such person shall be\r\n     an inhabitant, a certificate in writing, containing the name and\r\n     station of such person, and the name, age, and sex of the child\r\n     so born; which certificate, whether the same be delivered before\r\n     or after the said nine months, shall be by the said clerk\r\n     recorded in a book to be by him provided for that purpose; and\r\n     such record thereof shall be good evidence of the age of such\r\n     child; and the clerk of such county shall receive from said\r\n     person twelve cents for every child so registered; and if any\r\n     person shall neglect to deliver such certificate to the said\r\n     clerk within said nine months, such person shall forfeit and pay\r\n     for every such offence, five dollars, and the further sum of one\r\n     dollar for every month such person shall neglect to deliver the\r\n     same, to be sued for and recovered by any person who will sue for\r\n     the same, the one half to the use of such prosecutor, and the\r\n     residue to the use of the poor of the township in which such\r\n     delinquent shall reside.\r\n\r\n     \"3. _And be it enacted_, That the person entitled to the service\r\n     of any child born as aforesaid, may, nevertheless, within one\r\n     year after the birth of such child, elect to abandon such right;\r\n     in which case a notification of such abandonment, under the hand\r\n     of such person, shall be filed with the clerk of the township, or\r\n     where there may be a county poor-house established, then with the\r\n     clerk of the board of trustees of said poor-house of the county\r\n     in which such person shall reside; but every child so abandoned\r\n     shall be maintained by such person until such child arrives to\r\n     the age of one year, and thereafter shall be considered as a\r\n     pauper of such township or county, and liable to be bound out by\r\n     the trustees or overseers of the poor in the same manner as other\r\n     poor children are directed to be bound out, until, if a male, the\r\n     age of twenty-five, and if a female, the age of twenty-one; and\r\n     such child, while such pauper, until it shall be bound out, shall\r\n     be maintained by the trustees or overseers of the poor of such\r\n     county or township, as the case may be, at the expense of this\r\n     State; and for that purpose the director of the board of chosen\r\n     freeholders of the county is hereby required, from time to time,\r\n     to draw his warrant on the treasurer in favor of such trustees or\r\n     overseers for the amount of such expense, not exceeding the rate\r\n     of three dollars per month; provided the accounts for the same be\r\n     first certified and approved by such board of trustees, or the\r\n     town committee of such township; and every person who shall omit\r\n     to notify such abandonment as aforesaid, shall be considered as\r\n     having elected to retain the service of such child, and be liable\r\n     for its maintenance until the period to which its servitude is\r\n     limited as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n     \"A. Passed at Trenton, Feb. 15, 1804.\"\r\n\r\nThe public journals of the larger Northern cities began to take a\r\nlively interest in the paramount question of the day, which, without\r\ndoubt, was the slavery question. Gradual emancipation was doing an\r\nexcellent work in nearly all the Northern States, as may be seen by\r\nthe census of 1820. When the entire slave population was footed up it\r\nshowed an increase of 30 per cent. during the previous ten years, but\r\nwhen examined by States it was found to be on the decrease in all the\r\nNorthern or free States, except Illinois.

His brilliant achievements in the\r\nwar of the Revolution, his power of endurance, and martial enthusiasm,\r\nwere the golden threads of glory that bound his memory to the\r\nvictorious cause of the American Republic. A lack of troops and an\r\nimperiled cause led to the admission of Negroes into the American army\r\nduring the war of the Revolution. But it was the Negro's eminent\r\nfitness for military service that made him a place under the United\r\nStates flag during the war in Louisiana. The entire country had\r\nconfidence in the Negro's patriotism and effectiveness as a soldier.\r\nWhite men were willing to see Negroes go into the army because it\r\nreduced their chances of being sent forth to the tented field and\r\ndangerous bivouac.\r\n\r\nNew York did not hesitate to offer a practical endorsement of the\r\nprevalent opinion that Negroes were both competent and worthy to fight\r\nthe battles of the Nation. Accordingly, the following Act was passed\r\nauthorizing the organization of two regiments of Negroes.\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE RAISING OF TWO REGIMENTS OF MEN OF\r\n     COLOR; PASSED OCT. 24, 1814.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 1. _Be it enacted_ by the people of the State of New York,\r\n     represented in Senate and Assembly, That the Governor of the\r\n     State be, and he is hereby, authorized to raise, by voluntary\r\n     enlistment, two regiments of free men of color, for the defence\r\n     of the State for three years, unless sooner discharged.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That each of the said\r\n     regiments shall consist of one thousand and eighty able-bodied\r\n     men; and the said regiments shall be formed into a brigade, or be\r\n     organized in such manner, and shall be employed in such service,\r\n     as the Governor of the State of New York shall deem best adapted\r\n     to defend the said State.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That all the commissioned\r\n     officers of the said regiments and brigade shall be white men;\r\n     and the Governor of the State of New York shall be, and he is\r\n     hereby, authorized to commission, by brevet, all the officers of\r\n     the said regiments and brigade, who shall hold their respective\r\n     commissions until the council of appointment shall have appointed\r\n     the officers of the said regiments and brigade, in pursuance of\r\n     the Constitution and laws of the said State.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That the commissioned\r\n     officers of the said regiments and brigade shall receive the same\r\n     pay, rations, forage, and allowances, as officers of the same\r\n     grade in the army of the United States; and the non-commissioned\r\n     officers, musicians, and privates of the said regiments shall\r\n     receive the same pay, rations, clothing, and allowances, as the\r\n     non-commissioned officers, musicians, and privates of the army of\r\n     the United States; and the sum of twenty-five dollars shall be\r\n     paid to each of the said non-commissioned officers, musicians,\r\n     and privates, at the time of enlistment, in lieu of all other\r\n     bounty.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That the troops to be\r\n     raised as aforesaid may be transferred into the service of the\r\n     United States, if the Government of the United States shall agree\r\n     to pay and subsist them, and to refund to this State the moneys\r\n     expended by this State in clothing and arming them; and, until\r\n     such transfer shall be made, may be ordered into the service of\r\n     the United States in lieu of an equal number of militia, whenever\r\n     the militia of the State of New York shall be ordered into the\r\n     service of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 6. _And be it further enacted_, That it shall be lawful\r\n     for any able-bodied slave, with the written assent of his master\r\n     or mistress, to enlist into the said corps; and the master or\r\n     mistress of such slave shall be entitled to the pay and bounty\r\n     allowed him for his service; and, further, that the said slave,\r\n     at the time of receiving his discharge, shall be deemed and\r\n     adjudged to have been legally manumitted from that time, and his\r\n     said master or mistress shall not thenceforward be liable for his\r\n     maintenance.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 7. _And be it further enacted_, That every such enrolled\r\n     person, who shall have become free by manumission or otherwise,\r\n     if he shall thereafter become indigent, shall be deemed to be\r\n     settled in the town in which the person who manumitted him was\r\n     settled at the time of such manumission, or in such other town\r\n     where he shall have gained a settlement subsequent to his\r\n     discharge from the said service; and the former owner or owners\r\n     of such manumitted person, and his legal representatives, shall\r\n     be exonerated from his maintenance, any law to the contrary\r\n     hereof notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n     \"SECT. 8. _And be it further enacted_, That, when the troops to\r\n     be raised as aforesaid shall be in the service of the United\r\n     States, they shall be subject to the rules and articles which\r\n     have been or may be hereafter established by the By-laws of the\r\n     United States for the government of the army of the United\r\n     States; that, when the said troops shall be in the service of the\r\n     State of New York, they shall be subject to the same rules and\r\n     regulations; and the Governor of the said State shall be, and he\r\n     is hereby, authorized and directed to exercise all the power and\r\n     authority which, by the said rules and articles, are required to\r\n     be exercised by the President of the United States.\"[2]\r\n\r\nGen. Andrew Jackson believed in the fighting capacity of the Negro, as\r\nevidenced by the subjoined proclamation:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"HEADQUARTERS OF 7TH MILITARY DISTRICT,\r\n                                        \"MOBILE, September 21, 1814.\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE FREE COLORED INHABITANTS OF LOUISIANA:\r\n\r\n     \"Through a mistaken policy you have heretofore been deprived of a\r\n     participation in the glorious struggle for national rights in\r\n     which our country is engaged. This no longer shall exist.\r\n\r\n     \"As sons of freedom, you are now called upon to defend our most\r\n     inestimable blessing. As Americans, your country looks with\r\n     confidence to her adopted children for a valorous support, as a\r\n     faithful return for the advantages enjoyed under her mild and\r\n     equitable government. As fathers, husbands, and brothers, you are\r\n     summoned to rally around the standard of the eagle, to defend all\r\n     which is dear in existence.\r\n\r\n     \"Your country, although calling for your exertions, does not wish\r\n     you to engage in her cause without amply remunerating you for the\r\n     services rendered. Your intelligent minds are not to be led away\r\n     by false representations. Your love of honor would cause you to\r\n     despise the man who should attempt to deceive you.

The non-commissioned officers and privates\r\n     will also be entitled to the same monthly pay and daily rations,\r\n     and clothes, furnished to any American soldier.\r\n\r\n     \"On enrolling yourselves in companies, the major-general\r\n     commanding will select officers for your government from your\r\n     white fellow-citizens.

At the close of\r\nthe review his Adjutant-General, Edward Livingston, rode to the head\r\nof the column, and read in rich and sonorous tones the following\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE MEN OF COLOR.--Soldiers! From the shores of Mobile I\r\n     collected you to arms; I invited you to share in the perils and\r\n     to divide the glory of your white countrymen. I expected much\r\n     from you, for I was not uninformed of those qualities which must\r\n     render you so formidable to an invading foe. I knew that you\r\n     could endure hunger and thirst and all the hardships of war; I\r\n     knew that you loved the land of your nativity, and that, like\r\n     ourselves, you had to defend all that is most dear to man. But\r\n     you surpass my hopes. I have found in you, united to these\r\n     qualities, that noble enthusiasm which impels to great deeds.\r\n\r\n     \"Soldiers! The President of the United States shall be informed\r\n     of your conduct on the present occasion; and the voice of the\r\n     representatives of the American nation shall applaud your valor,\r\n     as your general now praises your ardor. The enemy is near. His\r\n     sails cover the lakes. But the brave are united; and if he finds\r\n     us contending among ourselves, it will be for the prize of valor,\r\n     and fame, its noblest reward.\"[4]\r\n\r\nBut in this war, as in the Revolutionary struggle, the commissioners\r\nwho concluded the terms of peace, armed with ample and authentic\r\nevidence of the Negro's valorous services, placed him among chattel\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAnd in no State in the South were the laws more rigidly enforced\r\nagainst Negroes, both free and slave, than in Louisiana. The efficient\r\nservice of the Louisiana Negro troops in the war of 1812 was applauded\r\non two continents at the time, but the noise of the slave marts soon\r\nsilenced the praise of the \"Black heroes of the battle of New\r\nOrleans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Laws of the State of New York, passed at the Thirty-eighth Session\r\nof the Legislature, chap. xviii.\r\n\r\n[3] Niles's Register, vol. vii. p. 205.\r\n\r\n[4] Niles's Register, vol. vii. pp. 345, 346.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNEGROES IN THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n     NO PROSCRIPTION AGAINST NEGROES AS SAILORS.--THEY ARE CARRIED\r\n     UPON THE ROLLS IN THE NAVY WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR\r\n     NATIONALITY.--THEIR TREATMENT AS SAILORS.--COMMODORE PERRY'S\r\n     LETTER TO COMMODORE CHAUNCEY IN REGARD TO THE MEN SENT\r\n     HIM.--COMMODORE CHAUNCEY'S SPIRITED REPLY.--THE HEROISM OF THE\r\n     NEGRO SET FORTH IN THE PICTURE OF PERRY'S VICTORY ON LAKE\r\n     ERIE.--EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM NATHANIEL SHALER, COMMANDER OF A\r\n     PRIVATE VESSEL.--HE CITES SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THE HEROIC CONDUCT\r\n     OF NEGRO SAILORS.\r\n\r\nIt is rather a remarkable fact of history that Negroes were carried\r\nupon the rolls of the navy without reference to their nationality.\r\nAbout one tenth of the crews of the fleet that sailed to the Upper\r\nLakes to co-operate with Col. Croghan at Mackinac, in 1814, were\r\nNegroes. Dr. Parsons says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In 1816, I was surgeon of the 'Java,' under Commodore Perry. The\r\n     white and colored seamen messed together. About one in six or\r\n     eight were colored.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1819, I was surgeon of the 'Guerrière,' under Commodore\r\n     Macdonough; and the proportion of blacks was about the same in\r\n     her crew. There seemed to be an entire absence of prejudice\r\n     against the blacks as messmates among the crew. What I have said\r\n     applies to the crews of the other ships that sailed in\r\n     squadrons.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThis ample and reliable testimony as to the treatment of Negroes as\r\nsailors, puts to rest all doubts as to their status in the United\r\nStates navy.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1813, Captain (afterwards Commodore) Perry wrote a\r\nletter to Commodore Chauncey in which he complained that an\r\nindifferent lot of men had been sent him. The following is the letter\r\nthat he wrote.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR:--I have this moment received, by express, the enclosed\r\n     letter from General Harrison. If I had officers and men--and I\r\n     have no doubt you will send them--I could fight the enemy, and\r\n     proceed up the lake; but, having no one to command the 'Niagara,'\r\n     and only one commissioned lieutenant and two acting lieutenants,\r\n     whatever my wishes may be, going out is out of the question. The\r\n     men that came by Mr. Champlin are a motley set--blacks, soldiers,\r\n     and boys. I cannot think you saw them after they were selected. I\r\n     am, however, pleased to see any thing in the shape of a man.\"[6]\r\n\r\nCommodore Chauncey replied in the following sharp letter, in which he\r\ngave Captain Perry to understand that the color of the skin had\r\nnothing to do with a man's qualifications for the navy:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR:--I have been duly honored with your letters of the\r\n     twenty-third and twenty-sixth ultimo, and notice your anxiety for\r\n     men and officers. I am equally anxious to furnish you; and no\r\n     time shall be lost in sending officers and men to you us soon as\r\n     the public service will allow me to send them from this lake. I\r\n     regret that you are not pleased with the men sent you by Messrs.\r\n     Champlin and Forrest; for, to my knowledge, a part of them are\r\n     not surpassed by any seamen we have in the fleet; and I have yet\r\n     to learn that the color of the skin, or the cut and trimmings of\r\n     the coat, can affect a man's qualifications or usefulness. I have\r\n     nearly fifty blacks on board of this ship, and many of them are\r\n     among my best men; and those people you call soldiers have been\r\n     to sea from two to seventeen years; and I presume that you will\r\n     find them as good and useful as any men on board of your vessel;\r\n     at least, if I can judge by comparison; for those which we have\r\n     on board of this ship are attentive and obedient, and, as far as\r\n     I can judge, many of them excellent seamen: at any rate, the men\r\n     sent to Lake Erie have been selected with a view of sending a\r\n     fair proportion of petty officers and seamen; and, I presume,\r\n     upon examination it will be found that they are equal to those\r\n     upon this lake.\"[7]\r\n\r\nPerry was not long in discovering that the Negroes whom Commodore\r\nChauncey had sent him were competent, faithful, and brave; and his\r\nformer prejudice did not prevent him from speaking their praise.\r\n\r\n     \"Perry speaks highly of the bravery and good conduct of the\r\n     negroes, who formed a considerable part of his crew. They seemed\r\n     to be absolutely insensible to danger. When Captain Barclay came\r\n     on board the 'Niagara,' and beheld the sickly and party-colored\r\n     beings around him, an expression of chagrin escaped him at\r\n     having been conquered by such men. The fresh-water service had\r\n     very much impaired the health of the sailors, and crowded the\r\n     sick-list with patients.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThese brave Negro sailors served faithfully through all the battles on\r\nthe Lakes, and in the battle of Lake Erie rendered most effective\r\nservice. Once more the artist has rescued from oblivion the heroism of\r\nthe Negroes; for in the East Senate stairway of the Capitol at\r\nWashington, and in the rotunda of the Capitol at Columbus, in the\r\ncelebrated picture of Perry's Victory on Lake Erie, a Negro sailor has\r\na place among the immortalized crew.\r\n\r\nThe following testimony to the bravery of Colored sailors is of the\r\nhighest character.\r\n\r\n     \"EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM NATHANIEL SHALER, COMMANDER OF THE\r\n     PRIVATE-ARMED SCHOONER 'GOV.

He was a black man, by the name of John\r\n     Johnson. A twenty-four-pound shot struck him in the hip, and took\r\n     away all the lower part of his body. In this state, the poor\r\n     brave fellow lay on the deck, and several times exclaimed to his\r\n     shipmates: '_Fire away, my boys; no haul a color down._' The\r\n     other was also a black man, by the name of John Davis, and was\r\n     struck in much the same way.

It was now time for reflection.\r\nThe Southern statesmen had proven themselves the masters of the\r\nsituation. The institution of slavery was secured to them, with many\r\ncollateral political advantages. And, in addition to this, they had\r\nsecured the inoculation of the free territory beyond the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio rivers with the virus of Negro-slavery.\r\n\r\nIf the mother-country had forced slavery upon her colonial\r\ndependencies in North America, and if it were difficult and\r\ninconvenient to part with slave-labor, who were now responsible for\r\nthe extension of the slave area? Southern men, of course. What\r\nprinciple or human law was strong enough to support an institution of\r\nsuch cruel proportions? The old law of European pagans born of bloody\r\nand destroying wars? No; for it was now the nineteenth century.\r\nAbstract law? Certainly not; for law is the perfection of reason--it\r\nalways tends to conform thereto--and that which is not reason is not\r\nlaw. Well did Justinian write: \"Live honestly, hurt nobody, and render\r\nto every one his just dues.\" The law of nations? Verily not; for it\r\nis a system of rules deducible from reason and natural justice, and\r\nestablished by universal consent, to regulate the conduct and mutual\r\nintercourse between independent States. The Declaration of\r\nIndependence? Far from it; because the prologue of that incomparable\r\ninstrument recites: \"_We hold these truths to be self-evident--that\r\nall_ MEN _are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain unalienable Rights; that among these are life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights,\r\ngovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed._\" And the peerless George Bancroft has\r\nadded: \"The heart of Jefferson in writing the Declaration, and of\r\nCongress in adopting it, beat for all humanity; the assertion of right\r\nwas made for all mankind and all coming generations, without any\r\nexception whatever; for the proposition which admits of exceptions can\r\nnever be self-evident.\" There was but one authority for slavery left,\r\nand that was the Bible.\r\n\r\nMany slave-holders thought deeply on the question of their right to\r\nhold slaves. A disturbed conscience cried aloud for a \"Thus saith the\r\nLord,\" and the pulpit was charged with the task of quieting the\r\ngeneral disquietude. The divine origin of slavery was heard from a\r\nthousand pulpits. God, who never writes a poor hand, had written upon\r\nthe brow of every Negro, the word \"_Slave_\"; slavery was their normal\r\ncondition, and the white man was God's agent in the United States to\r\ncarry out the prophecy of Noah respecting the descendants of Ham;\r\nwhile St. Paul had sent Onesimus back to his owner, and had written,\r\n\"Servants, obey your masters.\"\r\n\r\nBut apologetic preaching did not seem to silence the gnawing of a\r\nguilty conscience. Upon the battle-fields of two great wars; in the\r\narmy and in the navy, the Negroes had demonstrated their worth and\r\nmanhood. They had stood with the undrilled minute-men along the dusty\r\nroads leading from Lexington and Concord to Boston, against the\r\nskilled redcoats of boastful Britain. They were among the faithful\r\nlittle band that held Bunker Hill against overwhelming odds; at Long\r\nIsland, Newport, and Monmouth, they had held their ground against the\r\nstubborn columns of the Ministerial army. They had journeyed with the\r\nPilgrim Fathers through eight years of despair and hope, of defeat and\r\nvictory; had shared their sufferings and divided their glory. These\r\nrecollections made difficult an unqualified acceptance of the doctrine\r\nof the divine nature of perpetual slavery. Reason downed sophistry,\r\nand human sympathy shamed prejudice. And against prejudice, custom,\r\nand political power, the thinking men of the South launched their best\r\nthoughts. Jefferson said: \"The hour of emancipation is advancing in\r\nthe march of time. It will come, and whether brought on by the\r\ngenerous energy of our own minds, or by the bloody process of St.\r\nDomingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy\r\n[Great Britain], if once stationed permanently within our country and\r\noffering asylum and arms to the oppressed [Negro], is a leaf in our\r\nhistory _not yet turned over_.\" These words, written to Edward Coles,\r\nin August, 1814, were still ample food for the profound meditation of\r\nthe slave-holders. In his \"Notes on Virginia\" Mr. Jefferson had\r\nwritten the following words: \"_Indeed, I tremble for my country when I\r\nreflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever._\r\nThat, considering numbers, nature, and natural means, only a\r\nrevolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation, is among\r\npossible events. That it may become probable by _supernatural\r\ninterference_. _The Almighty has no attribute which can take side with\r\nus in such a contest._\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Patrick Henry and the logic and philosophy of Madison\r\nand Jefferson rang in the ears of the people of the slave-holding\r\nStates, and they paused to think. In forty years the Negro population\r\nof Virginia had increased 186 per cent.--from 1790 to 1830,--while the\r\nwhite had increased only 51 per cent. The rapid increase of the slave\r\npopulation winged the fancy and produced horrid dreams of\r\ninsurrection; while the pronounced opposition of the Northern people\r\nto slavery seemed to proclaim the weakness of the government and the\r\napproach of its dissolution. In 1832, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, a\r\ngrandson of Thomas Jefferson, lifted up his voice in the Legislature\r\nof Virginia against the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\n     Said Mr. Jefferson:--\"There is one circumstance to which we are\r\n     to look as inevitable in the fulness of time--_a dissolution of\r\n     this Union_. God grant it may not happen in our time or that of\r\n     our children; but, sir, it must come sooner or later, and when it\r\n     does come, border war follows it, as certain as the night follows\r\n     the day. An enemy upon your frontier offering arms and asylum to\r\n     this population, tampering with it in your bosom, when your\r\n     citizens shall march to repel the invader, their families\r\n     butchered and their homes desolated in the rear, the spear will\r\n     fall from the warrior's grasp; his heart may be of steel, but it\r\n     must quail. Suppose an invasion in part with _black troops_,\r\n     speaking the same language, of the same nation, burning with\r\n     enthusiasm for the liberation of their race; if they are not\r\n     crushed the moment they put foot upon your soil, they roll\r\n     forward, an hourly swelling mass; your energies are paralyzed,\r\n     your power is gone; the morasses of the lowlands, the fastnesses\r\n     of the mountains, cannot save your wives and children from\r\n     destruction. Sir, we cannot war with these disadvantages; _peace,\r\n     ignoble, abject peace,--peace upon any conditions that an enemy\r\n     may offer, must be accepted_. Are we, then, prepared to barter\r\n     the liberty of our children for slaves for them?... Sir, it is a\r\n     practice, and an increasing practice in parts of Virginia to\r\n     _rear slaves for market_. How can an honorable mind, a patriot\r\n     and a lover of his country, bear to see this ancient Dominion,\r\n     rendered illustrious by the noble devotion and patriotism of her\r\n     sons in the cause of liberty, converted into one grand managerie,\r\n     where men are to be reared for market like oxen for the shambles.\r\n     Is this better, is it not worse, than the _Slave-Trade_, that\r\n     trade which enlisted the labor of the _good and the wise of every\r\n     creed and every clime to abolish it_?\"\r\n\r\nMr. P. A. Bolling said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Speaker, it is vain for gentlemen to deny the fact, the\r\n     feelings of society are fast becoming adversed to slavery. The\r\n     moral causes which produce that feeling are on the march, and\r\n     will on _until the groans of slavery are heard no more in this\r\n     else happy country_. Look over this world's wide page--see the\r\n     rapid progress of liberal feelings--see the shackles falling from\r\n     nations who have long writhed under the galling yoke of slavery.\r\n     Liberty is going over the whole earth--hand-in-hand with\r\n     Christianity. The ancient temples of slavery, rendered venerable\r\n     alone by their antiquity, are crumbling into dust. Ancient\r\n     prejudices are flying before the light of truth--are dissipated\r\n     by its rays, as the idle vapor by the bright sun. The noble\r\n     sentiment of Burns:\r\n\r\n          'Then let us pray that come it may,\r\n            As come it will for a' that,\r\n          That man to man, the warld o'er,\r\n            Shall brothers be for a' that'--\r\n\r\n     is rapidly spreading. The day-star of human liberty has risen\r\n     above the dark horizon of slavery, and will continue its bright\r\n     career, until it smiles alike on all men.\"\r\n\r\nMr. C. J. Faulkner said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, I am gratified that no gentleman has yet risen in this\r\n     hall, the advocate of slavery. * * * Let me compare the condition\r\n     of the slave-holding portion of this commonwealth, barren,\r\n     desolate, and scarred, as it were, by the avenging hand of\r\n     Heaven, with the descriptions which we have of this same country\r\n     from those who first broke its virgin soil. To what is this\r\n     change ascribable? Alone to the withering, blasting effects of\r\n     slavery. If this does not satisfy him, let me request him to\r\n     extend his travels to the Northern States of this Union, and beg\r\n     him to contrast the happiness and contentment which prevail\r\n     throughout that country--the busy and cheerful sound of industry,\r\n     the rapid and swelling growth of their population, their means\r\n     and institutions of education, their skill and proficiency in the\r\n     useful arts, their enterprise and public spirit, the monuments of\r\n     their commercial and manufacturing industry, and, above all,\r\n     their devoted attachment to the government from which they derive\r\n     their protection, with the division, discontent, indolence, and\r\n     poverty of the Southern country. To what, sir, is all this\r\n     ascribable? 'T is to that _vice_ in the organization of society\r\n     by which one half of its inhabitants are arrayed in interest and\r\n     feeling against the other half; to that unfortunate state of\r\n     society in which free men regard labor as disgraceful, and slaves\r\n     shrink from it as a burden tyrannically imposed upon them. _'To\r\n     that condition of things in which half a million of your\r\n     population can feel no sympathy with the society in the\r\n     prosperity of which they are forbidden to participate, and no\r\n     attachment to a government at whose hands they receive nothing\r\n     but injustice.'_ In the language of the wise, prophetic\r\n     Jefferson, 'you must approach this subject, YOU MUST ADOPT SOME\r\n     PLAN OF EMANCIPATION, OR WORSE WILL FOLLOW.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Maryland and Delaware the Quakers were rapidly emancipating their\r\nslaves, and the strong reaction that had set in among the thoughtful\r\nmen of the South began to threaten the institution. Men felt that it\r\nwas a curse to the slave, and poisoned the best white society of the\r\nslave-holding States. As early as 1781, Mr. Jefferson, with his keen,\r\nphilosophical insight, beheld with alarm the demoralizing tendency of\r\nslavery. \"The whole commerce,\" says Mr. Jefferson, \"between master and\r\nslave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions; the\r\nmost unrelenting despotism on the one part, and degrading submission\r\non the other. Our children see this, and learn to imitate it--for man\r\nis an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in\r\nhim. From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees\r\nothers do. If a parent could find no motive, either in his\r\nphilanthropy or his self-love, for restraining the intemperance of\r\npassion toward his slave, it should always be a sufficient one that\r\nhis child is present. But generally, it is not sufficient. The parent\r\nstorms; the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on\r\nthe same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose tongue to\r\nthe worst of passions, and, thus nursed, educated, and daily exercised\r\nin tyranny, cannot but be stamped with odious peculiarities. The man\r\nmust be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by\r\nsuch circumstances. And with what execration should the statesman be\r\nloaded, who, permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the\r\nrights of the other, transforms those into despots and these into\r\nenemies, destroys the morals of the one part, and the _amor patriæ_ of\r\nthe other!\"[11]\r\n\r\nAnd what was true in Virginia, as coming under the observation of Mr.\r\nJefferson, was true in all the other States where slavery existed. And\r\nindeed it was difficult to tell whether the slave or master was\r\ninjured the more. The ignorance of the former veiled from him the\r\nterrible evils of his condition, while the intelligence of the latter\r\nrevealed to him, in detail, the baleful effects of the institution\r\nupon all who came within its area. It was at war with social order; it\r\ncontracted the sublime ideas of national unity; it made men sectional,\r\nlicentious, profligate, cruel,--and selfishness paled the holy fires\r\nof patriotism.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the profound reflection of the greatest minds in\r\nthe South, and the philosophic prophecies of Jefferson, the conscience\r\nand heart of the South did not respond to the dictates of humanity.\r\nCotton and cupidity led captive the reason of the South, and, once\r\nmore joined to their idols, the slave-holders no longer heard the\r\nvoice of prudence or justice in the slave marts of their \"section.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Jefferson's Writings, vol. viii, p. 404.\r\n\r\n[11] Jefferson's Writings, vol. viii. p. 403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nANTI-SLAVERY METHODS.\r\n\r\n     THE ANTIQUITY OF ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENT.--BENJAMIN LUNDY'S\r\n     OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH AND AT THE NORTH.--HE\r\n     ESTABLISHES THE \"GENIUS OF UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.\"--HIS GREAT\r\n     SACRIFICES AND MARVELLOUS WORK IN THE CAUSE OF\r\n     EMANCIPATION.--WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON EDITS A PAPER AT\r\n     BENNINGTON, VERMONT.--HE PENS A PETITION TO CONGRESS FOR THE\r\n     ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.--GARRISON THE\r\n     PEERLESS LEADER OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY AGITATION.--EXTRACT FROM A\r\n     SPEECH DELIVERED BY DANIEL O'CONNELL AT CORK, IRELAND.--INCREASE\r\n     OF ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETIES IN THE COUNTRY.--CHARLES SUMNER\r\n     DELIVERS A SPEECH ON THE \"ANTI-SLAVERY DUTIES OF THE WHIG\r\n     PARTY.\"--MARKED EVENTS OF 1846.--SUMNER THE LEADER OF THE\r\n     POLITICAL PARTY.--HETERODOX ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY.--ITS\r\n     SENTIMENTS.--HORACE GREELEY THE LEADER OF THE ECONOMIC\r\n     ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY.--THE AGGRESSIVE ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY.--ITS\r\n     LEADERS.--THE COLONIZATION ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.--AMERICAN\r\n     COLONIZATION SOCIETY.--MANUMITTED NEGROES COLONIZE ON THE WEST\r\n     COAST OF AFRICA.--A BILL ESTABLISHING A LINE OF MAIL STEAMERS TO\r\n     THE COAST OF AFRICA.--IT PROVIDES FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE\r\n     SLAVE-TRADE, PROMOTION OF COMMERCE, AND THE COLONIZATION OF FREE\r\n     NEGROES.--EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESS WARMLY URGING THE PASSAGE OF\r\n     THE BILL.--THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD ORGANIZATION.--ITS EFFICIENCY\r\n     IN FREEING SLAVES.--ANTI-SLAVERY LITERATURE.--IT EXPOSES THE TRUE\r\n     CHARACTER OF SLAVERY.--\"UNCLE TOM'S CABIN,\" BY HARRIET BEECHER\r\n     STOWE, PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE SLAVE IN TWENTY DIFFERENT\r\n     LANGUAGES.--THE INFLUENCE OF \"IMPENDING CRISIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti-slavery sentiment is as old as the human family. It antedates the\r\nBible; it was eloquent in the days of our Saviour; it preached the\r\nGospel of Humanity in the palaces of the Cæsars and Antonies; its\r\narguments shook the thrones of Europe during the Mediæval ages. And\r\nwhen the doctrine of property in man was driven out of Europe as an\r\nexile, and found a home in this New World in the West, the ancient and\r\ntime-honored anti-slavery sentiment combined all that was good in\r\nbrain, heart, and civilization, and hurled itself, with righteous\r\nindignation, against the institution of slavery, the perfected curse\r\nof the ages! And how wonderful that God should have committed the task\r\nof blotting out this terrible curse to Americans! And what \"vessels of\r\nhonor\" they were whom the dear Lord chose \"to proclaim liberty to the\r\ncaptives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound!\"\r\nStatesmen like Franklin, Rush, Hamilton, and Jay; divines like\r\nHopkins, Edwards, and Stiles; philanthropists like Woolman, Lay, and\r\nBenezet! And the good Quakers--God bless them!--or _Friends_, which\r\nhas so much tender meaning in it, did much to hasten the morning of\r\nfreedom. In the poor Negro slave they saw Christ \"an hungered,\" and\r\nthey gave Him meat; \"thirsty,\" and they gave Him drink; \"a stranger,\"\r\nand they took Him in; \"naked,\" and they clothed Him; \"sick,\" and they\r\nvisited Him; \"in prison,\" and they came unto Him. Verily they knew\r\ntheir \"_neighbor_.\"\r\n\r\nThey began their work of philanthropy as early as 1780. In\r\nMaryland,[12] Pennsylvania, and New Jersey the Friends emancipated all\r\ntheir slaves. At a single monthly meeting in Pennsylvania eleven\r\nhundred slaves were set at liberty. Nearly every Northern State had\r\nits anti-slavery society. They were charged with the humane task of\r\nameliorating the condition of the Negro, and scattering modest\r\nliterary documents that breathed the spirit of Christian love.\r\n\r\nBut the first apostle of _Abolition Agitation_ was Benjamin Lundy. He\r\nwas the John Baptist to the new era that was to witness the doing away\r\nof the law of bondage and the ushering in of the dispensation of\r\nuniversal brotherhood. He raised his voice against slave-keeping in\r\nVirginia, Ohio, Tennessee, and Maryland. In 1821 he established an\r\nanti-slavery paper called \"The Genius of Universal Emancipation,\"\r\nwhich he successively published in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\r\nWashington City,--and frequently _en route_ during the tours he took\r\nthrough the country, wherever he could find a press. Once he made a\r\ntour of the free States, like another Apostle Paul, stirring up the\r\nlove of the brethren for those who were in bonds, lecturing, obtaining\r\nsubscribers, writing editorials, getting them printed where he could,\r\nstopping by the wayside to read his \"proof,\" and directing and mailing\r\nhis papers at the nearest post-office. Then, packing up his\r\n\"column-rules,\" type, \"heading,\" and \"directing-book,\" he would\r\njourney on, a lone, solitary \"Friend.\" He said in 1830:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have, within the period above mentioned (ten years),\r\n     sacrificed several thousands of dollars of my own hard earnings;\r\n     I have travelled upwards of five thousand miles on foot and more\r\n     than twenty thousand in other ways; have visited nineteen States\r\n     of this Union, and held more than two hundred public meetings;\r\n     have performed two voyages to the West Indies, by which means the\r\n     emancipation of a considerable number of slaves has been\r\n     effected, and I hope the way paved for the enfranchisement of\r\n     many more.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a slight-built, wiry figure; but inflamed by a holy zeal for\r\nthe cause of the oppressed, he was almost unconscious of the vast\r\namount of work he was accomplishing. As a Quaker his methods were\r\nmoderate. His journalistic voice was not a whirlwind nor the fire, but\r\nthe still, small voice of persuasiveness. Though it was published in a\r\nslave mart, his paper, a monthly, was regarded as perfectly harmless.\r\nBut away up in Vermont there was being edited, at Bennington, a paper\r\ncalled \"The Journal of the Times.\" It was started chiefly to advocate\r\nthe claims of John Quincy Adams to the Presidency, but much space was\r\ndevoted to the subject of anti-slavery. The young editor of the\r\nabove-named journal had had experience with several other papers\r\nprevious to this--\"The Free Press,\" of Newburyport, Mass., and \"The\r\nNational Philanthropist,\" of Boston. \"The Genius of Universal\r\nEmancipation,\" was among the exchanges of \"The Journal of the Times,\"\r\nand its sentiments greatly enthused the heart of the Vermont editor,\r\nwho, under God, was destined to become the indefatigable leader of the\r\nAnti-slavery Movement in America, _William Lloyd Garrison_! To his\r\nadvocacy of \"temperance and peace\" young Garrison added another\r\nexcellent principle, intense hatred of slavery. He penned a petition\r\nfor the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, which he\r\nsent to all the postmasters in Vermont, beseeching them to secure\r\nsignatures. As the postmasters of those days paid no postage for their\r\nletters, many names were secured. The petition created a genuine\r\nsensation in Congress. The \"Journal of Commerce\" about this time said:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears from an article in 'The Journal of the Times,' a\r\n     newspaper of some promise, just established in Bennington, Vt.,\r\n     that a petition to Congress for the abolition of slavery in the\r\n     District of Columbia is about to be put in circulation in that\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     \"The idea is an excellent one, and we hope it will meet with\r\n     success. That Congress has a right to abolish slavery in that\r\n     District seems reasonable, though we fear it will meet with some\r\n     opposition, so very sensitive are the slave-holding community to\r\n     every movement relating to the abolition of slavery. At the same\r\n     time, it would furnish to the world a beautiful pledge of their\r\n     sincerity if they would unite with the non-slave-holding States,\r\n     and by a unanimous vote proclaim freedom to every soul within\r\n     sight of the capital of this free government. We could then say,\r\n     and the world would then admit our pretence, that the voice of\r\n     the nation is against slavery, and throw back upon Great Britain\r\n     that disgrace which is of right and justice her exclusive\r\n     property.\"\r\n\r\nCharmed by the originality, boldness, and humanity of Garrison, the\r\nmeek little Quaker went to Boston by stage; and then, with staff in\r\nhand, walked to Bennington, Vt., to see the young man whose great\r\nheart-throbs for the slave he had felt in \"The Journal of the Times.\"\r\nThere, in the Green Mountains of Vermont, swept by the free air, and\r\nmantled by the pure snow, the meek Quaker communed with the strict\r\nBaptist, and they both took sweet counsel together. The bright torch\r\nthat Garrison had held up to the people in Vermont was to be\r\ntransferred to the people of Baltimore, who were \"sitting in\r\ndarkness.\" So, as a result of this conference, Garrison agreed to join\r\nLundy in conducting \"The Genius of Universal Emancipation.\"\r\nAccordingly, in September, 1829, Garrison took the principal charge of\r\nthe Journal, enlarged it, and issued it as a weekly. Lundy was to\r\ntravel, lecture, and solicit subscribers in its interest, and\r\ncontribute to its editorial columns as he could from time to time.\r\n\r\nBoth men were equally against slavery: Lundy for gradual emancipation\r\nand _colonization_; but Garrison for _immediate and unconditional\r\nemancipation_. Garrison said of this difference: \"But I wasn't much\r\nhelp to him, for he had been all for gradual emancipation, and as soon\r\nas I began to look into the matter, I became convinced that immediate\r\nabolition was the doctrine to be preached, and I scattered his\r\nsubscribers like pigeons.\"\r\n\r\nBut the good \"Friend\" contemplated the destructive zeal of his young\r\nhelper with the complacency so characteristic of his class, standing\r\nby his doctrine that every one should follow \"his own light.\" But it\r\nwas not long before Garrison made a bold attack upon one of the vilest\r\nfeatures of the slave-trade, which put an end to his paper, and\r\nresulted in his arrest, trial for libel, conviction, and imprisonment.\r\nThe story runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"A certain ship, the 'Francis Todd,' from Newburyport, came to\r\n     Baltimore and took in a load of slaves for the New Orleans\r\n     market. All the harrowing cruelties and separations which attend\r\n     the rending asunder of families and the sale of slaves, were\r\n     enacted under the eyes of the youthful philanthropist, and in a\r\n     burning article he denounced the inter-State slave-trade as\r\n     piracy, and piracy of an aggravated and cruel kind, inasmuch as\r\n     those born and educated in civilized and Christianized society\r\n     have more sensibility to feel the evils thus inflicted than\r\n     imbruted savages. He denounced the owners of the ship and all the\r\n     parties in no measured terms, and expressed his determination to\r\n     'cover with thick infamy all who were engaged in the\r\n     transaction.'\"\r\n\r\nThen, to be sure, the sleeping tiger was roused, for there was a vigor\r\nand power in the young editor's eloquence that quite dissipated the\r\ngood-natured contempt which had hitherto hung round the paper. He was\r\nindicted for libel, found guilty, of course, condemned, imprisoned in\r\nthe cell of a man who had been hanged for murder. His mother at this\r\ntime was not living, but her heroic, undaunted spirit still survived\r\nin her son, who took the baptism of persecution and obloquy not merely\r\nwith patience, but with the joy which strong spirits feel in\r\nendurance. He wrote sonnets on the walls of his prison, and by his\r\ncheerful and engaging manners made friends of his jailer and family,\r\nwho did everything to render his situation as comfortable as possible.\r\nSome considerable effort was made for his release, and much interest\r\nwas excited in various quarters for him.[13]\r\n\r\nFinally, the benevolent Arthur Tappan came forward and paid the\r\nexorbitant fine imposed upon Garrison, and he went forth a more\r\ninveterate foe of slavery. This incident gave the world one of the\r\ngreatest reformers since Martin Luther. Without money, social\r\ninfluence, or friends, Garrison lifted again the standard of liberty.\r\nHe began a lecture tour in which God taught him the magnitude of his\r\nwork. Everywhere mouths were sealed and public halls closed against\r\nhim. At length, on January 1, 1831, he issued the first number of \"The\r\nLiberator,\" which he continued to edit for thirty-five years, and\r\ndiscontinued it only when every slave in America was free! His methods\r\nof assailing the modern Goliath of slavery were thus tersely put:\r\n\r\n     \"I determined, at every hazard, to lift up the standard of\r\n     emancipation in the eyes of the nation, within sight of Bunker\r\n     Hill, and in the birthplace of liberty. That standard is now\r\n     unfurled; and long may it float, unhurt by the spoliations of\r\n     time or the missiles of a desperate foe; yea, till every chain be\r\n     broken, and every bondman set free! Let Southern oppressors\r\n     tremble; let their secret abettors tremble; let all the enemies\r\n     of the persecuted Black tremble. Assenting to the self-evident\r\n     truths maintained in the American Declaration of\r\n     Independence,--'that all men are created equal, and endowed by\r\n     their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are\r\n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' I shall strenuously\r\n     contend for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave\r\n     population.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but\r\n     is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and\r\n     as uncompromising as justice. On this subject I do not wish to\r\n     think, or speak, or write with moderation. No! No! Tell a man\r\n     whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to\r\n     moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell\r\n     the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into\r\n     which it has fallen; but urge me not to use moderation in a cause\r\n     like the present! I am in earnest. I will not equivocate--I will\r\n     not excuse--I will not retreat a single inch. AND I WILL BE\r\n     HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue\r\n     leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the\r\n     dead.\r\n\r\n     \"It is pretended that I am retarding the cause of emancipation by\r\n     the coarseness of my invective and the precipitancy of my\r\n     measures. The charge is not true. On this question, my influence,\r\n     humble as it is, is felt at this moment to a considerable extent;\r\n     and it shall be felt in coming years--not perniciously, but\r\n     beneficially,--not as a curse, but as a blessing; and POSTERITY\r\n     WILL BEAR TESTIMONY THAT I WAS RIGHT. I desire to thank God that\r\n     He enables me to disregard 'the fear of man which bringeth a\r\n     snare,' and to speak truth in its simplicity and power; and I\r\n     here close with this dedication:\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n               \"Oppression!

There\r\nnever was a more intrepid leader than William Lloyd Garrison. Words\r\nmore prophetic were never uttered by human voice. His paper did indeed\r\nmake \"Southern oppression tremble,\" while its high resolves and\r\nsublime sentiments found a response in the hearts of many people. It\r\nis pleasant to record that this first impression of \"The Liberator\"\r\nbrought a list of twenty-five subscribers from Philadelphia, backed by\r\n$50 in cash, sent by James Forten, a Colored man!\r\n\r\nOne year from the day he issued the first number of his paper, William\r\nLloyd Garrison, at the head of eleven others, organized _The American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society_. It has been indicated already that he was in\r\nfavor of immediate emancipation; but, in addition to that principle,\r\nhe took the ground that slavery was supported by the Constitution;\r\nthat it was \"a covenant with death and an agreement with hell\"; that\r\nas a Christian it was his duty to obey God rather than man; that his\r\nconscience was paramount to the Constitution, and, therefore, his duty\r\nwas to work outside of the Constitution for the destruction of\r\nslavery. Thus did Garrison establish the first Anti-slavery Society in\r\nthis country to adopt aggressive measures and demand immediate and\r\nunconditional emancipation. It is not claimed that his methods were\r\noriginal. Daniel O'Connell was perhaps the greatest _agitator_ of the\r\npresent century. In a speech delivered at Cork, he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I speak of liberty in commendation. Patriotism is a virtue, but\r\n     it can be selfish. Give me the great and immortal Bolivar, the\r\n     savior and regenerator of his country. He found her a province,\r\n     and he has made her a nation. His first act was to give freedom\r\n     to the slaves upon his own estate. (Hear, hear.) In Colombia, all\r\n     castes and all colors are free and unshackled. But how I like to\r\n     contrast him with the far-famed Northern heroes! George\r\n     Washington! That great and enlightened character--the soldier and\r\n     the statesman--had but one blot upon his character. He had\r\n     slaves, and he gave them liberty when he wanted them no longer.\r\n     (Loud cheers.) Let America, in the fulness of her pride wave on\r\n     high her banner of freedom and its blazing stars. I point to her,\r\n     and say: There is one foul blot upon it: you have negro slavery.\r\n     They may compare their struggles for freedom to Marathon and\r\n     Leuctra, and point to the rifleman with his gun, amidst her woods\r\n     and forests, shouting for liberty and America. In the midst of\r\n     their laughter and their pride, I point them to the negro\r\n     children screaming for the mother from whose bosom they have been\r\n     torn. America, it is a foul stain upon your character! (Cheers.)\r\n     This conduct kept up by men who had themselves to struggle for\r\n     freedom, is doubly unjust. Let them hoist the flag of liberty,\r\n     with the whip and rack on one side, and the star of freedom upon\r\n     the other. The Americans are a sensitive people; in fifty-four\r\n     years they have increased their population from three millions to\r\n     twenty millions; they have many glories that surround them, but\r\n     their beams are partly shorn, for they have slaves. (Cheers.)\r\n     Their hearts do not beat so strong for liberty as mine.... I will\r\n     call for justice, in the name of the living God, and I shall find\r\n     an echo in the breast of every human being. (Cheers.)\"[14]\r\n\r\nBut while Garrison's method of agitation was not original, it was new\r\nto this country. He spoke as one having authority, and his fiery\r\nearnestness warmed the frozen feeling of the Northern people, and\r\nstartled the entire South. One year from the formation of the society\r\nabove alluded to (December 4, 5, and 6, 1833), a _National\r\nAnti-Slavery Convention_ was held in Philadelphia, with sixty\r\ndelegates from ten States! In 1836 there were 250 auxiliary\r\nanti-slavery societies in thirteen States; and eighteen months later\r\nthey had increased to 1,006. Money came to these societies from every\r\ndirection, and the good work had been fairly started.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison created a party, and it will be known in\r\nhistory as the _Garrisonian Party_.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Garrison had taken the position that slavery was\r\nconstitutional, there were those who held the other view, that slavery\r\nwas unconstitutional, and, therefore, upon constitutional grounds\r\nshould be abolished.\r\n\r\nThe Whig party was the nearest to the anti-slavery society of any of\r\nthe political organizations of the time. It had promised, in\r\nconvention assembled, \"to promote all constitutional measures for the\r\noverthrow of slavery, and to oppose at all times, with uncompromising\r\nzeal and firmness, any further addition of slave-holding States to\r\nthis Union, out of whatever territory formed.[15] But the party never\r\ngot beyond this. Charles Sumner was a member of the Whig party, but\r\nwas greatly disturbed about its indifference on the question of\r\nslavery. In 1846 he delivered a speech before the Whig convention of\r\nMassachusetts on \"_The Anti-Slavery Duties of the Whig Party_.\" He\r\ndeclared his positive opposition to slavery; said that he intended to\r\nattack the institution on constitutional grounds; that slavery was not\r\na \"covenant with death or an agreement with hell\"; that he intended to\r\ndo his work for the slave inside of the Constitution. He said:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is in the Constitution no compromise on the subject of\r\n     slavery of a character not to be reached legally and\r\n     constitutionally, which is the only way in which I propose to\r\n     reach it. Wherever power and jurisdiction are secured to\r\n     Congress, they may unquestionably be exercised in conformity with\r\n     the Constitution. And even in matters beyond existing powers and\r\n     jurisdiction there is a constitutional mode of action. The\r\n     Constitution contains an article pointing out how at any time\r\n     amendments may be made thereto. This is an important article,\r\n     giving to the Constitution a progressive character, and allowing\r\n     it to be moulded to suit new exigencies and new conditions of\r\n     feeling. The wise framers of this instrument did not treat the\r\n     country as a Chinese foot, never to grow after its infancy, but\r\n     anticipated the changes incident to its growth.\"\r\n\r\nHe proposed to the Whigs as their rallying watchword, the \"REPEAL OF\r\nSLAVERY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\"\r\nDiscussing the methods, he continued:--\r\n\r\n     \"The time has passed when this can be opposed on constitutional\r\n     grounds. It will not be questioned by any competent authority\r\n     that Congress may by express legislation abolish slavery, first,\r\n     in the District of Columbia; second, in the territories, if there\r\n     should be any; third, that it may abolish the slave-trade on the\r\n     high seas between the States; fourth, that it may refuse to admit\r\n     any new State with a constitution sanctioning slavery. Nor can it\r\n     be doubted that the people of the free States may, in the manner\r\n     pointed out by the Constitution, proceed to its amendment.\"\r\n\r\nThus did Charles Sumner lay down a platform for a _Political Abolition\r\nParty_, and of such a party he became the laurelled champion and\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nThe year 1846 was marked by the most bitter political discussion;\r\nGarrison the _Agitator_, the Mexican war, and other issues had greatly\r\nexercised the people. At a meeting held in Tremont Temple, Boston, on\r\nthe 5th of November, 1846, Mr. Sumner took occasion to give his\r\nreasons for bolting the nominee of the Whig party for Congress, Mr.\r\nWinthrop.[16] Mr. Sumner said that he had never heard Mr. Winthrop's\r\nvoice raised for the slave; and that, judging from the past, he never\r\nexpected to hear it. \"Will he oppose,\" asked Mr. Sumner, \"at all\r\ntimes, without compromise, any further addition of slave-holding\r\nStates? Here, again, if we judge him by the past, he is wanting. None\r\ncan forget that in 1845, on the 4th of July, a day ever sacred to\r\nmemories of freedom, in a speech at Faneuil Hall, he volunteered, in\r\nadvance of any other Northern Whig, to receive Texas with a welcome\r\ninto the family of States, although on that very day she was preparing\r\na constitution placing slavery beyond the reach of Legislative\r\nchange.\"[17]\r\n\r\nHere, then, was another party created--a _Political Abolition\r\nParty_--for the suppression of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Mr. Sumner left the Whig party, and gave his magnificent\r\nenergies and splendid talents to the organization of the _Free-Soil\r\nParty_, upon the principles he had failed to educate the Whigs to\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner was in the United States Senate, where \"his words were\r\nclothed with the majesty of Massachusetts.\" The young lawyer who had\r\nupbraided Winthrop for his indifference respecting the slave, and\r\nopposed the Mexican war, was consistent in the Senate, and in harmony\r\nwith his early love for humanity. He closed his great speech on\r\nFREEDOM NATIONAL, SLAVERY SECTIONAL, in the following incisive\r\nlanguage:--\r\n\r\n     \"At the risk of repetition, but for the sake of clearness, review\r\n     now this argument, and gather it together. Considering that\r\n     slavery is of such an offensive character that it can find\r\n     sanction only in positive law, and that it has no such 'positive'\r\n     sanction in the Constitution; that the Constitution, according to\r\n     its Preamble, was ordained to 'establish justice,' and 'secure\r\n     the blessings of liberty'; that in the convention which framed\r\n     it, and also elsewhere at the time, it was declared not to\r\n     'sanction'; that according to the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     and the address of the Continental Congress, the nation was\r\n     dedicated to 'Liberty' and the 'rights of human nature'; that\r\n     according to the principles of common law, the Constitution must\r\n     be interpreted openly, actively, and perpetually for Freedom;\r\n     that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, it acts upon\r\n     slaves, _not as property_, but as _persons_; that at the first\r\n     organization of the national government under Washington, slavery\r\n     had no national favor, existed nowhere on the national territory,\r\n     beneath the national flag, but was openly condemned by the\r\n     nation, the Church, the colleges, and literature of the times;\r\n     and finally, that according to an amendment of the Constitution,\r\n     the national government can only exercise powers delegated to it,\r\n     among which there is none to support slavery;--considering these\r\n     things, sir, it is impossible to avoid the single conclusion that\r\n     slavery is in no respect a national institution, and that the\r\n     Constitution nowhere upholds property in man.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech set men in the North to thinking. Sumner was now the\r\nacknowledged leader of the only political party in the country that\r\nhad a wholesome anti-slavery plank in its platform.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster and the Whig party were in their grave. After the\r\nDemocratic Convention had met and adjourned without mentioning\r\nWebster, a Northern farmer exclaimed when he had read the news, \"_The\r\nSouth never pay their slaves_!\"\r\n\r\nDuring all these years of agitation and struggle, the pulpit of New\r\nEngland maintained an unbroken silence on the slavery question. Doctor\r\nLyman Beecher was the acknowledged leader of the orthodox pulpit. Dr.\r\nWilliam E. Channing was the champion of Unitarianism and the leader of\r\nthe heterodox pulpit. Dr. Beecher was fond of controversy, enjoyed a\r\nbattle of words upon every thing but the slavery question. He\r\nproclaimed the doctrine of \"_immediate repentance_\"; was earnest in\r\nhis entreaties to men to quit their \"cups\" at _once_; but on the\r\nslavery question was a slow coach. He was for _gradual_ emancipation.\r\nHe frowned not a little upon the vigorous editorials in \"The\r\nLiberator.\" He regarded Mr. Garrison as a hot-head; \"having zeal, but\r\nnot according to knowledge.\" Abolitionism received no encouragement\r\nfrom this venerable divine.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing was a gentle, pure-hearted, and humane sort of a man. He\r\ndreaded controversy, and shunned the agitation and agitators of\r\nanti-slavery.\r\n\r\nThe lesser lights followed the example of these bright stars in the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nBut all could not keep silent,--for slavery needed apologists in the\r\nNorth. Stewart, of Andover; Alexander, of Princeton; Fisk, of\r\nWilberham, and many other leading ministers endeavored to prove the\r\n_Divine Origin and Biblical Authority of Slavery_.\r\n\r\nThe silence of the pulpit drove out many anti-slavery men who, up to\r\nthis time, had been hoping for aid from this quarter. Many went out of\r\nthe Church temporarily, hoping that the scales would drop from the\r\neyes of the preachers ere long; but others never returned-were driven\r\nto infidelity and bitter hatred of the Christian Church. Dr. Albert\r\nBarnes said: \"That there was no power out of the Church that would\r\nsustain slavery an hour if it were not sustained in it.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders of the HETERODOX ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY--those who\r\nattacked the reticency, silent acquiescence, or act of support the\r\nChurch gave slavery,--were Parker Pillsbury, James G. Birney, Stephen\r\nS. Foster, and Samuel Brooke. The platform of this party was clearly\r\ndefined by Mr. Pillsbury:--\r\n\r\n     \"That slavery finds its surest and sternest defence in the\r\n     prevailing religion of the country, is no longer questionable.\r\n     Let it be driven from the Church, with the burning seal of its\r\n     reprobation and execration stamped on its iron brow, and its fate\r\n     is fixed forever. Only while its horrors are baptized and\r\n     sanctified in the name of Christianity, can it maintain an\r\n     existence.\r\n\r\n     \"The Anti-Slavery movement has unmasked the character of the\r\n     American Church. _Our religion has been found at war with the\r\n     interests of humanity and the laws of God._ And it is more than\r\n     time the world was awakened to its unhallowed influence on the\r\n     hopes and happiness of man, while it makes itself the palladium\r\n     of the foulest iniquity ever perpetrated in the sight of\r\n     heaven.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThis was a bold movement, but it was doubtless a sword that was as\r\ndangerous to those who essayed to handle it, as to the Church whose\r\ndestruction it was intended to effect. The doctrine that was to\r\nsustain and inspire this party can be briefly stated in a sentence:\r\nTHE FATHERHOOD OF GOD, AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN.\r\n\r\nOnce outside the orthodox church, Theodore Parker gave himself wholly\r\nto this idea. He preached the \"_Gospel of Humanity_\"; and, standing\r\nupon a broad platform, preaching a broad doctrine, bound by no\r\necclesiastical law, his claims to a place in the history of his\r\ncounty, and in the gratitude of his countrymen can be fairly audited\r\nwhen his work for the emancipation of evangelical churches from the\r\nthraldom of slavery is considered. He did more in his day to rupture\r\nthe organic and sympathetic relation existing between the Northern and\r\nSouthern churches, and, thereby, hasten the struggle between the\r\nsections for the extension or extinction of domestic slavery, than any\r\nother man in America. The men who found themselves on the outside of\r\nthe Church gathered about Parker, and applauded his invective and\r\nendorsed his arraignment of the churches that had placed their hands\r\nupon their mouths, and their mouths in the dust, before the slave\r\npower. He touched a chord in the human heart, and it yielded rich\r\nmusic. He educated the pew until an occasional voice broke the long\r\nsilence respecting the bondman of the land. First, the ministers were\r\nnot so urgent in their invitations to Southern ministers to occupy\r\ntheir pulpits. This coldness was followed by feeble prayer and\r\nmoderate speech on behalf of those who were bound. And the churches\r\nthemselves began to feel that they were \"an offence\" to the world.\r\nEvery note of sympathy that fell from the pulpit was amplified into a\r\ngrand chorus of pity for the slave. And thus the leaven of human\r\nsympathy hid in the orthodox church of New England, leavened the whole\r\nbody until a thousand pulpits were ablaze with a righteous\r\ncondemnation of the wrongs of the slaves. Even Dr. Channing came to\r\nthe conclusion that something should be \"So done as not to put in\r\njeopardy the peace of the slave-holding States!\"[19]\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY was headed by the industrious and\r\nindomitable Horace Greeley. His claim to the feelings of humanity\r\nshould never be disputed; but as a practical man who sought to solve\r\nthe riddle of every-day life he placed his practical views in the\r\nforeground. As a political economist he reasoned that slave labor was\r\ndegrading to free labor; that free labor was better than slave labor,\r\nand, therefore, he most earnestly desired its abolition. Wherever you\r\nturn in his writings this idea gives the edge to all his arguments\r\nconcerning slavery. \"But slavery,\" wrote Mr. Greeley, \"primarily\r\nconsidered, has still another aspect--that of a natural relation of\r\nsimplicity to cunning, of ignorance to knowledge, of weakness to\r\npower. Thomas Carlyle, before his melancholy decline and fall into\r\ndevil-worship, truly observed, that the capital mistake of Rob Roy was\r\nhis failure to comprehend that it was cheaper to buy the beef he\r\nrequired in the Grassmarket at Glasgow than to obtain it without\r\nprice, by harrying the lowland farms. So the first man whoever imbibed\r\nor conceived the fatal delusion that it was more advantageous to him,\r\nor to any human being, to procure whatever his necessities or his\r\nappetites required by address and scheming than by honest work--by the\r\nunrequited rather than the fairly and faithfully recompensed toil of\r\nhis fellow-preachers--was, in essence and in heart, a slave-holder,\r\nand only awaited opportunity to become one in deed and practice.... It\r\nis none the less true, however, that ancient civilization, in its\r\nvarious national developments, was habitually corrupted, debauched,\r\nand ultimately ruined by slavery, which rendered labor dishonorable,\r\nand divided society horizontally into a small caste of the wealthy,\r\neducated, refined, and independent, and a vast hungry, sensual,\r\nthriftless, and worthless populace; rendered impossible the\r\npreservation of republican liberty and of legalized equality, even\r\namong the nominally free. Diogenes, with his lantern, might have\r\nvainly looked, through many a long day, among the followers of Marius,\r\nor Catiline, or Cæsar, for a specimen of the poor but virtuous and\r\nself-respecting Roman citizen of the days of Cincinnatus, or even of\r\nRegulus.\"[20]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Greeley's philosophy was as destructive as his logic was\r\ndefective. He wished the slave free, not because he loved him; but\r\nbecause of the deep concern he had for the welfare of the free, white\r\nworking-men of America. He was willing the Negro should be free, but\r\nnever suggested any plan of relief for his social condition, or\r\nprescribed for his spiritual and intellectual health. He handled the\r\nentire Negro problem with the icy fingers of the philosopher, and\r\nalways applied the flinty logic of abstract political economy. He was\r\nan _anti-slavery_ advocate, but not an _abolitionist_. He was opposed\r\nto slavery, as a system at war with the social and commercial\r\nprosperity of the nation; but so far as the humanity of the question,\r\nin reaching out after the slave as an injured member of society, was\r\nconcerned, he was silent.\r\n\r\nTHE AGGRESSIVE ANTI-SLAVERY PARTY had its birth in the pugnacious\r\nbrains of E. P. Lovejoy, James G. Birney, Cassius M. Clay, and John\r\nBrown. All of the anti-slavery parties had taught the doctrine of\r\n_non-resistance_; that if \"thy enemy smite thee on thy cheek, turn the\r\nother also.\" But there were a few men who believed they were possessed\r\nof sacred rights, and that it was their duty to defend them, even with\r\ntheir lives. It was not a popular doctrine; and yet a conscientious\r\nfew practised it with sublime courage whenever occasion required. In\r\n1836 James G. Birney, editor of _The Philanthropist_, published at\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, defended his press, as best he could, against a mob,\r\nwho finally destroyed it. And on the 7th of November, 1837, the Rev.\r\nMr. Lovejoy sealed the sacred doctrine of the liberty of the press\r\nwith his precious blood in the defence of his printing-press at Alton,\r\nIllinois. Cassius M. Clay went armed, and insisted upon his right to\r\nfreely and peaceably discuss the cause of anti-slavery.\r\n\r\nBut these men only laid down a great, fundamental truth; it was given\r\nto John Brown to write the lesson upon the hearts of the American\r\npeople, so that they were enabled, a few years later, to practise the\r\ndoctrine of _resistance_, and preserve the _Nation_ against the bloody\r\naggressions of the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIZATION ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY ante-dated any of the other\r\norganizations. Benjamin Lundy was one of the earliest advocates of\r\ncolonization. The object of colonizationists was to transport to\r\nLiberia, on the West Coast of Africa, all manumitted slaves. Only\r\n_free_ Negroes were to be colonized. It was claimed by the advocates\r\nof the scheme that this was the only hope of the free Negro; that the\r\nproscription everywhere directed against his social and intellectual\r\nendeavors cramped and lamed him in the race of life; that in Liberia\r\nhe could build his own government, schools, and business; and there\r\nwould be nothing to hinder him in his ambition for the highest places\r\nin Church or State. Moreover, they claimed that the free Negro owed\r\nsomething to his benighted brethren who were still in pagan darkness;\r\nthat a free Negro government on the West Coast of Africa could exert a\r\nmissionary influence upon the natives, and thus the evangelization of\r\nAfrica could be effected by the free Negro himself.[21]\r\n\r\nTo this method Henry Clay, of Kentucky, Horace Mann, of Massachusetts;\r\nRev. Howard Malcom, of Pennsylvania; Rev. R. R. Gurley, of New York;\r\nand many other persons of distinction, gave their endorsement and\r\nassistance. The American Colonization Society was organized in 1817.\r\nIts earliest supporters were from the Southern and Middle States. A\r\nfair idea can be had of the character of the men who sustained the\r\ncause of colonization by an examination of the following list of\r\nofficers elected in March, 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_President._--JAMES MADISON, of Virginia.\r\n\r\n     \"_Vice-Presidents._--Chief-Justice MARSHALL; General LAFAYETTE,\r\n     of France, Hon.

But it had\r\nthe advantage of being in harmony with what little humane sentiment\r\nthere was at the South. It did not attempt to agitate. It only sought\r\nto colonize on the West Coast of Africa all Negroes who could secure\r\nlegal manumission. Nearly all the Southern States had laws upon their\r\nstatute-books requiring all emancipated slaves to leave the State. The\r\nquestion as to where they should go was supposed to be answered by the\r\nColonization Society. It had much influence with Congress, and did not\r\nhesitate to use it. A Mr. Joseph Bryan, of Alabama, petitioned\r\nCongress for the establishment \"of a line of Mail Steam-ships to the\r\nWestern Coast of Africa,\" in the summer of 1850. The Committee on\r\nNaval Affairs reported favorably the following bill:\r\n\r\n     \"A BILL TO ESTABLISH A LINE OF WAR STEAMERS TO THE COAST OF\r\n     AFRICA. [Report No. 438.]\r\n\r\n     \"_In the House of Representatives, August 1, 1850. Read twice,\r\n     and committed to the Committee of the whole House on the State of\r\n     the Union._\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. F. P. Stanton, from the Committee on Naval Affairs, reported\r\n     the following bill:--A bill to establish a line of war steamers\r\n     to the coast of Africa, for the suppression of the slave-trade,\r\n     and the promotion of commerce and colonization:\r\n\r\n     SEC. 1. \"_Be it enacted_ by the Senate and House of\r\n     Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress\r\n     assembled, That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the\r\n     Navy, immediately after the passage of this act, to enter into\r\n     contract with Joseph Bryan, of Alabama, and George Nicholas\r\n     Saunders, of New York, and their associates, for the building,\r\n     equipment, and maintenance of three steam-ships to run between\r\n     the United States and the coast of Africa, upon the following\r\n     terms and conditions, to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"The said ships to be each of not less than four thousand tons\r\n     burden, to be so constructed as to be convertible, at the least\r\n     possible expense, into war steamers of the first class, and to be\r\n     built and equipped in accordance with plans to be submitted to\r\n     and approved by the Secretary of the Navy, and under the\r\n     superintendence of an officer to be appointed by him, two of said\r\n     ships to be finished and ready for sea in two and a half years,\r\n     and the other within three years after the date of the contract,\r\n     and the whole to be kept up by alterations, repairs, or\r\n     additions, to be approved by the Secretary of the Navy, so as to\r\n     be fully equal to the exigencies of the service and the faithful\r\n     performance of the contract. The said Secretary, at all times, to\r\n     exercise such control over said ships as may not be inconsistent\r\n     with the provisions of this act, and especially to have the power\r\n     to direct, at the expense of the Government, such changes in the\r\n     machinery and internal arrangements of the ships as he may at any\r\n     time deem advisable.\r\n\r\n     \"Each of said ships to be commanded by an officer of the Navy,\r\n     who with four Passed Midshipmen to act as watch officers, and any\r\n     mail agents who may be sent by the Government, shall be\r\n     accommodated and provided for in a manner suitable to their rank,\r\n     at the expense of the contractors. Each of said ships, if\r\n     required by the Secretary, shall receive two guns of heavy\r\n     calibre, and the men from the United States Navy necessary to\r\n     serve them, who shall be provided for as aforesaid. In the event\r\n     of war the Government to have the right to take any or all of\r\n     said ships for its own exclusive use on payment of the value\r\n     thereof; such value not exceeding the cost, to be ascertained by\r\n     appraisers chosen by the Secretary of the Navy and the\r\n     contractors.\r\n\r\n     \"Each of said ships to make four voyages per annum; one shall\r\n     leave New Orleans every three months; one shall leave Baltimore\r\n     every three months, touching at Norfolk and Charleston; and one\r\n     shall leave New York every three months, touching at Savannah;\r\n     all having liberty to touch at any of the West India Islands; and\r\n     to proceed thence to Liberia, touching at any of the islands or\r\n     ports on the coast of Africa; thence to Gibraltar, carrying the\r\n     Mediterranean mails; thence to Cadiz, or some other Spanish port\r\n     to be designated by the Secretary of the Navy; thence to Lisbon;\r\n     thence to Brest, or some other French port to be designated as\r\n     above; thence, to London, and back to the place of departure,\r\n     bringing and carrying the mails to and from said ports.\r\n\r\n     \"The said contractors shall further agree to carry to Liberia so\r\n     many emigrants being free persons of color, and not exceeding\r\n     twenty-five hundred for each voyage, as the American Colonization\r\n     Society may require, upon the payment by said Society of ten\r\n     dollars for each emigrant over twelve years of age, and five\r\n     dollars for each one under that age, these sums, respectively, to\r\n     include all charges for baggage of emigrants and the daily supply\r\n     of sailors' rations. The contractors, also, to carry, bring back,\r\n     and accommodate, free from charge, all necessary agents of the\r\n     said Society.\r\n\r\n     \"The Secretary of the Navy shall further stipulate to advance to\r\n     said contractors, as the building of said ships shall progress,\r\n     two thirds of the amount expended thereon; such advances to be\r\n     made in the bonds of the United States, payable thirty years\r\n     after date, and bearing five per cent. interest, and not to\r\n     exceed six hundred thousand dollars for each ship. And the said\r\n     contractors shall stipulate to repay the said advances in equal\r\n     annual instalments, with interest from the date of the completion\r\n     of said ships until the termination of the contract, which shall\r\n     continue fifteen years from the commencement of the service. The\r\n     Secretary of the Navy to require ample security for the faithful\r\n     performance of the contract, and to reserve a lien upon the ships\r\n     for the sum advanced. The Government to pay said contractors\r\n     forty thousand dollars for each trip, or four hundred and eighty\r\n     thousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the President of the\r\n     United States shall cause to be issued the bonds of the United\r\n     States, as the same may, from time to time, be required by the\r\n     Secretary of the Navy to carry out the contract aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment, North and South, was greatly in favor of the\r\nmeasure. T. J. Durant, Esq., of New Orleans, in an elaborate letter\r\naddressed to the \"Commercial Bulletin\" of New Orleans, under date of\r\nSeptember 12, 1850, answered objections, and warmly urged the passage\r\nof the bill. The Chaplain of the U. S. Senate, Rev. R. R. Gurley,\r\nwrote a letter on the 10th of October, 1850, to George N. Saunders,\r\nEsq., urging the measure as of paramount importance to both America\r\nand Africa. The press of the country generally endorsed the bill, and\r\ncommented upon the general good to follow in numerous editorials. A\r\nscheme of such gigantic proportions poorly set forth the profound\r\nthought that harassed the public mind in regard to the crime of\r\nkeeping men in slavery. A few extracts from the papers will suffice to\r\nshow how the matter was regarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n     EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n     \"The Report of the Naval Committee to the House of\r\n     Representatives in favor of the establishment of a line of mail\r\n     steam-ships to the Western Coast of Africa, and thence via the\r\n     Mediterranean to London, has been received by the public press\r\n     throughout the Union with the warmest expressions of approbation.\r\n     The Whig, Democratic, and neutral papers of the North and South,\r\n     in the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States, with a very\r\n     few exceptions, appear to vie with each other in pressing its\r\n     consideration upon the public attention. This earnest and almost\r\n     unanimous support of the measure by the organs of public opinion,\r\n     without respect to party or section, shows the deep hold which\r\n     the objects it proposes to effect have upon the public favor.\r\n     Those objects are to promote the emigration of free persons of\r\n     color from this country to Liberia; also to increase the steam\r\n     navy, and to extend the commerce of the United States,--all, it\r\n     will be almost universally conceded, desirable objects. The\r\n     desirableness of the objects being admitted, the question is,\r\n     does the mode proposed for promoting them recommend itself to the\r\n     sanction of Congress? We are forced to the conclusion that it\r\n     does. We are aware that while all agree as to the expediency of\r\n     increasing our steam navy--some are in favor of the Government's\r\n     building its own steam-ships, and others advocate the\r\n     encouragement of lines of steam-packets, to be established by\r\n     private enterprise under the auspices of Government....\r\n\r\n     \"The considerations, however, which in our opinion should commend\r\n     this measure to the favorable attention of Congress are so\r\n     obvious, and have been so clearly and strongly presented in the\r\n     report of the committee, that we need not here repeat them. If\r\n     the voice of the press, of all sections and of all parties, be\r\n     any indication of popular opinion, we are free to say, that it\r\n     would be difficult for Congress to pass a measure which would be\r\n     received with more _general_ satisfaction by the people of the\r\n     United States.\"[22]\r\n\r\n     \"AFRICAN STEAM-LINES.--The entertainment by the Government of\r\n     Great Britain of a project for the establishment of a powerful\r\n     line of steam-vessels between that country and the African coast,\r\n     ostensibly for the conveyance of a monthly mail, and the more\r\n     effectual checking of the slave-traffic, is strong proof, we\r\n     think, of the value that the commerce between the two countries\r\n     is capable of becoming. It may, in addition, be regarded as\r\n     corroborative of the justness of the position taken by the\r\n     advocates of a mail-steamer line between this country and Africa.\r\n     We are by no means disposed to look invidiously on the\r\n     enterprising spirit exhibited abroad for securing a closer\r\n     connection with a country, the great mercantile wealth of which\r\n     is yet, comparatively speaking, untouched. This spirit should\r\n     have on us no other than a stimulating effect. Besides, for\r\n     years, if not ages, to come, the trade with Africa can admit of\r\n     no very close competition. The promised vastness of this trade,\r\n     whilst excluding all idea of monopoly, must continue to excite\r\n     the new enterprise by its unlimited rewards. It is unnecessary\r\n     that we should exhibit statistics to show her how largely England\r\n     has been benefited by persevering though frequently interrupted\r\n     communication with the interior parts of that great continent;\r\n     nor to make plain how, with better knowledge and more ready means\r\n     of access, mercantile risks will be lessened and mercantile\r\n     profits enlarged. It will be remembered that the Congressional\r\n     committee to whom the question of establishing mail steamers\r\n     between this country and Africa was referred, adverted in their\r\n     report to the aid its adoption would afford in the consummation\r\n     of the plans of the Colonization Society. On the intimate\r\n     relation between the one and the other, it was supposed that a\r\n     good part of the required success was dependent. It is something\r\n     singular that the colored race--those in reality most interested\r\n     in the future destinies of Africa--should be so lightly affected\r\n     by the evidences continually being presented in favor of\r\n     colonization. He will do a service to this country as well as\r\n     Africa who shall do any thing to open the eyes of the colored\r\n     race to the advantages of emigration to the fertile and, to them,\r\n     congenial shores of Africa.\"[23]\r\n\r\n     \"AFRICA AND STEAM-SHIPS.--If but a single line of steam-ships is\r\n     to be authorized this Session--and the state and prospects of the\r\n     finances must counsel frugality and caution,--we think a line to\r\n     Africa fairly entitled to the preference. That continent on its\r\n     western side is comparatively proximate and accessible; it is\r\n     filled with inhabitants who need the articles we can abundantly\r\n     fabricate, and it is the ancestral soil of more than three\r\n     millions of our people--of a race on whose account we are deeply\r\n     debtors to justice and to heaven. That race is more plastic and\r\n     less conservative than the Chinese; their soil produces in\r\n     spontaneous profusion many articles which are to us comforts and\r\n     luxuries, while nearly every thing we produce is in eager demand\r\n     among its inhabitants, if they can but find the wherewithal to\r\n     pay for them. Instead of being a detriment and a depression to\r\n     our own manufacturing and mechanical industry, as the trade\r\n     induced by our costly steam-ship lines to Liverpool, Bremen, and\r\n     Havre mainly is, all the commerce with Africa which a more\r\n     intimate communication with her would secure, would be\r\n     advantageous to every department of American labor. Her surplus\r\n     products are so diverse from ours, that no collision of interests\r\n     between her producers and ours could ever be realized, while\r\n     millions' worth of her tropical products which will not endure\r\n     the slow and capricious transportation which is now their only\r\n     recourse, would come to us in good order by steam-ships, and\r\n     richly reward the labor of the gatherers and the enterprise of\r\n     the importers.\r\n\r\n     \"But the social and moral aspects of this subject are still more\r\n     important. We are now expending life and treasure, in concert\r\n     with other nations, to suppress the African slave-trade, and it\r\n     is now generally conceded that such suppression can never be\r\n     effected by the means hitherto relied on. The colonization of the\r\n     Slave Coast, with direct reference to its Christianization and\r\n     civilization, is the only sure means of putting an end to this\r\n     inhuman traffic. And this colonization, all who are interested in\r\n     the work seem heartily to agree, would be immensely accelerated\r\n     by the establishment of a line of African steam-ships. Liberia,\r\n     now practically distant as Buenos Ayres, would, by such a line,\r\n     be brought as near us as Bremen, and the ports regularly visited\r\n     by our steamers could not fail rapidly to assume importance as\r\n     centres of commerce and of increasing intelligence and\r\n     industry.\"[24]\r\n\r\n     \"THE COLONY OF LIBERIA AND ITS PROSPECTUS.--By every arrival from\r\n     Liberia we learn that the colony of free negroes from the United\r\n     States is progressing at a rate truly astonishing, and that\r\n     before many years it promises to be a strong and powerful\r\n     republic. The experiment of self-government has been completely\r\n     successful; the educational interests of the inhabitants are duly\r\n     cared for; civilization is making great headway among the\r\n     aborigines; and, by means of Liberia, there is a very flattering\r\n     prospect of the slave-trade on the coast of Africa being entirely\r\n     destroyed. Governor Roberts, a very intelligent colored man, of\r\n     mixed blood, goes even so far as to say that Liberia is destined\r\n     to rival the United States, and that both republics, by a unity\r\n     of action, can civilize and Christianize the world, and\r\n     especially benighted Africa. We are pleased to hear such good\r\n     accounts from Liberia, and we shall always be pleased to hear of\r\n     its success, and of the progress and welfare of its inhabitants.\r\n     Founded, as it has been, by American philanthropists, and peopled\r\n     by our emancipated slaves, the United States will ever watch its\r\n     progress with interest, and aid and assist it as far as it\r\n     possibly can.\"[25]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the apparent favor the cause of colonization\r\nreceived from the press, it was an impractical, impossible, wild, and\r\nvisionary scheme that could not be carried to the extent its\r\nprojectors designed. It lost strength yearly, until all were convinced\r\nthat the Negro would be emancipated here and remain here; that it was\r\nas impossible to colonize a race of people as to colonize the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars.\r\n\r\nTHE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD organization was perhaps one of the most\r\nuseful auxiliaries the cause of agitation had. It could scarcely be\r\ncalled an organization. Unlike the other societies, it did not print\r\nits reports.[26] Like good Samaritans, its conductors did not ask\r\npassengers their creed; but wherever they found human beings wounded\r\nin body and mind by slavery, they gave them passage to the \"Inn\" of\r\nFreedom on Canadian soil.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, the Underground Railroad was a secret organization. This\r\nwas necessary, as the fugitive-slave law gave the master the right to\r\npursue his slave when \"fleeing from labor and service in one State\r\ninto another,\" and apprehend him by due process of Federal law. The\r\nmen who managed this road felt that they should obey God rather than\r\nman; that the slave's right to his freedom was greater than any law\r\nthe nation could make through its representatives. So the Underground\r\nRailroad was made up of a company of godly men who stretched\r\nthemselves across the land, from the borders of the sunny slave States\r\nto the snow-white shores of Canada. When men came up out of the hell\r\nof slavery gasping for a breath of free air, these good friends\r\nsheltered and fed them; and then hastened them off in the stillness of\r\nthe night, with the everlasting stars as their ministers, toward\r\nCanada. The fugitives would be turned over to another conductor, who\r\nwould conceal them until nightfall, when he would load his living\r\nfreight into a covered conveyance, and drive all night to reach the\r\nnext \"station\"; and so on until the fugitives found themselves free\r\nand safe under the English flag in Canada.\r\n\r\nThis was the safety-valve to the institution of slavery. As soon as\r\nleaders arose among the slaves, refusing to endure the yoke, they came\r\nNorth. Had they remained, the direful scenes of St. Domingo would have\r\nbeen enacted, and the hot, vengeful breath of massacre would have\r\nswept the South as a tornado, and blanched the cheek of the civilized\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nANTI-SLAVERY LITERATURE wrought mightily for God in its field.[27]\r\nFrederick Douglass's book, \"My Bondage and My Freedom\"; Bishop\r\nLoguen's, \"As a Slave and As a Freeman\"; \"Autobiography of a Fugitive\r\nNegro,\" by the Rev. Samuel Ringgold Ward; \"Twenty-two Years a Slave,\r\nand Forty Years a Freeman,\" by the Rev. Austin Stewart; \"Narrative of\r\nSolomon Northup,\" \"Walker's Appeal,\"--all by eminent Negroes, exposed\r\nthe true character of slavery, informed the public mind, stimulated\r\nhealthy thought, and touched the heart of two continents with a\r\nsympathy almost divine.\r\n\r\nBut the uncounted millions of anti-slavery tracts, pamphlets,\r\njournals, and addresses of the entire period of agitation were little\r\nmore than a paper wad compared with the solid shot \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\r\nwas to slavery. Written in vigorous English, in scintillating,\r\nperspicuous style; adorned with gorgeous imagery, bristling with\r\nliving \"_facts_\", going to the lowest depths, mounting to the greatest\r\naltitudes, moving with panoramic grandeur, picturing humanity forlorn\r\nand outraged; giving forth the shrillest, most _despairing_ cries of\r\nthe afflicted, and the sublimest strains of Christian faith; the\r\nstruggle of innocent, defenceless womanhood, the subdued sorrow of\r\nchattel-babyhood, the yearnings of fettered manhood, and the piteous\r\nsobs of helpless old age,--made Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin\" the magnifying wonder of enlightened Christendom! It\r\npleaded the cause of the slave in twenty different languages; it\r\nengrossed the thought of philosophers, and touched the heart of youth\r\nwith a strange pity for the slave. It covered audiences with the\r\nsunlight of laughter, wrapt them in sorrow, and veiled them in tears.\r\nIt illustrated the power of the Gospel of Love, the gentleness of\r\nNegro character, and the powers and possibilities of the race. It was\r\nGod's message to a people who had refused to listen to his\r\nanti-slavery prophets and priests; and its sad, weird, and\r\nheart-touching descriptions and dialogues restored the milk of human\r\nkindness to a million hearts that had grown callous in an age of\r\nself-seeking and robbery of the poor.\r\n\r\nIn a political and sectional sense, the \"Impending Crisis,\" by Helper,\r\nexerted a wide influence for good. It was read by merchants and\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nDiverse and manifold as were the methods of the friends of universal\r\nfreedom, and sometimes apparently conflicting, under God no honest\r\neffort to rid the Negro and the country of the curse of slavery was\r\nlost. All these agencies, running along different lines, converged at\r\na common centre, and aimed at a common end--the ultimate extinction of\r\nthe foreign and domestic slave-trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] In the Library of the New York Historical Society there is \"An\r\nOration Upon the Moral and Political Evil of Slavery.

Jennings.\r\n\r\nThe first concern of this convention was the condition of that class\r\nwhich it directly represented--the \"free persons of color\" in the\r\nUnited States. A committee, consisting of Messrs. Morel, Shad, Duncan,\r\nCowley, Sipkins, and Jennings, made the following report on the\r\ncondition of the free persons of color in the United States:\r\n\r\n     \"_Brethren and Fellow-Citizens:_\r\n\r\n     \"We, the Committee of Inquiry, would suggest to the Convention\r\n     the propriety of adopting the following resolutions, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That, in the opinion of this Convention, it is\r\n     highly necessary that the different societies engaged in the\r\n     _Canadian Settlement_ be earnestly requested to persevere in\r\n     their praiseworthy and philanthropic undertaking; firmly\r\n     believing that, at a future period, their labors will be crowned\r\n     with success.\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee would also recommend this Convention to call on\r\n     the free people of color to assemble _annually_ by delegation at\r\n     such place as may be designated as suitable.\r\n\r\n     \"They would also respectfully submit to your wisdom the necessity\r\n     of your deliberate reflection on the dissolute, intemperate, and\r\n     ignorant condition of a large portion of the colored population\r\n     of the United States. They would not, however, refer to their\r\n     unfortunate circumstances to add degradation to objects already\r\n     degraded and miserable; nor, with some others, improperly class\r\n     the virtuous of our color with the abandoned, but with the most\r\n     sympathizing and heartfelt commiseration, show our sense of\r\n     obligation as the true guardians of our interests, by giving\r\n     wholesome advice and good counsel.\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee consider it as highly important that the\r\n     Convention recommend the necessity of creating a general fund, to\r\n     be denominated the CONVENTIONAL FUND, for the purpose of\r\n     advancing the objects of this and future conventions, as the\r\n     public good may require.\r\n\r\n     \"They would further recommend, that the Declaration of\r\n     Independence and the Constitution of the United Stales be read in\r\n     our Conventions; believing, that the truths contained in the\r\n     former are incontrovertible, and that the latter guarantees in\r\n     letter and spirit to every freeman born in this country, all the\r\n     rights and immunities of citizenship.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee with regret have witnessed the many oppressive,\r\n     unjust, and unconstitutional laws which have been enacted in the\r\n     different parts of the Union against the free people of color,\r\n     and they would call upon this Convention, as possessing the\r\n     rights of freemen, to recommend to the people, through their\r\n     delegation, the propriety of memorializing the proper\r\n     authorities, whenever they may feel themselves aggrieved, or\r\n     their rights invaded, by any cruel or oppressive laws.\r\n\r\n     \"And your Committee would further report, that, in their opinion,\r\n     _Education_, _Temperance_, and _Economy_ are best calculated to\r\n     promote the elevation of mankind to a proper rank and standing\r\n     among men, as they enable him to discharge all those duties\r\n     enjoined on him by his Creator. We would, therefore, respectfully\r\n     request an early attention to those virtues among our brethren\r\n     who have a desire to be useful.\r\n\r\n     \"And lastly, your Committee view with unfeigned regret, and\r\n     respectfully submit to the wisdom of this Convention, the\r\n     operations and misrepresentations of the American Colonization\r\n     Society in these United States.\r\n\r\n     \"We feel sorrowful to see such an immense and wanton waste of\r\n     lives and property, not doubting the benevolent feelings of some\r\n     individuals engaged in that cause. But we cannot for a moment\r\n     doubt, but that the cause of many of our unconstitutional,\r\n     unchristian, and unheard-of sufferings emanate from that\r\n     unhallowed source; and we would call on Christians of every\r\n     denomination firmly to resist it.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe convention was in session for several days. It attracted public\r\nattention on account of the intelligence, order, and excellent\r\njudgment which prevailed. It deeply touched the young white men who\r\nhad, but a few months previous, enlisted under the broad banner Wm.\r\nLloyd Garrison had given to the breeze. They called to see Colored men\r\nconduct a convention. The Rev. S. S. Jocelyn, of New Haven,\r\nConnecticut; Arthur Tappan, of New York; Benjamin Lundy, of\r\nWashington, D. C.; William Lloyd Garrison, of Boston, Massachusetts;\r\nThomas Shipley and Charles Pierce, of Philadelphia, visited the\r\nconvention and were cordially received. Messrs. Jocelyn, Tappan, and\r\nGarrison were invited to address the convention. They delivered\r\nstirring addresses, and especially urged the necessity of establishing\r\na college for the education of \"Young Men of Color.\" At the suggestion\r\nof the speaker the convention appointed a committee with whom the\r\nspeaker conferred. The report of the committee was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"That a plan had been submitted to them by the above-named\r\n     gentlemen, for the liberal education of Young Men of Color, on\r\n     the Manual-Labor System, all of which they respectfully submit to\r\n     the consideration of the Convention, are as follow:\r\n\r\n     \"The plan proposed is, that a College be established at New\r\n     Haven, Conn., as soon as $20,000 are obtained, and to be on the\r\n     Manual-Labor System, by which, in connection with a scientific\r\n     education, they may also obtain a useful Mechanical or\r\n     Agricultural profession; and (they further report, having\r\n     received information) that a benevolent individual has offered to\r\n     subscribe one thousand dollars toward this object, provided that\r\n     a farther sum of nineteen thousand dollars can be obtained in one\r\n     year.\r\n\r\n     \"After an interesting discussion, the above report was\r\n     unanimously adopted; one of the inquiries by the Convention was\r\n     in regard to the place of location. On interrogating the\r\n     gentlemen why New Haven should be the place of location, they\r\n     gave the following as their reasons:--\r\n\r\n     \"1st. The site is healthy and beautiful.\r\n\r\n     \"2d. Its inhabitants are friendly, pious, generous, and humane.\r\n\r\n     \"3d. Its laws are salutary and protecting to all, without regard\r\n     to complexion.\r\n\r\n     \"4th. Boarding is cheap and provisions are good.\r\n\r\n     \"5th. The situation is as central as any other that can be\r\n     obtained with the same advantages.\r\n\r\n     \"6th. The town of New Haven carries on an extensive West India\r\n     trade, and many of the wealthy colored residents in the Islands,\r\n     would, no doubt, send their sons there to be educated, and thus a\r\n     fresh tie of friendship would be formed, which might be\r\n     productive of much real good in the end.\r\n\r\n     \"And last, though not the least, the literary and scientific\r\n     character of New Haven, renders it a very desirable place for the\r\n     location of the college.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Committee was received and adopted. The Rev. Samuel\r\nE. Cornish was appointed general agent to solicit funds, and Arthur\r\nTappan was selected as treasurer. A Provisional Committee was\r\nappointed in each city, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Boston_--Rev. Hosea Easton, Robert Roberts, James G. Barbadoes,\r\n     and Rev. Samuel Snowden.\r\n\r\n     \"_New York_--Rev. Peter Williams, Boston Cromwell, Philip Bell,\r\n     Thomas Downing, Peter Voglesang.\r\n\r\n     \"_Philadelphia_--Joseph Cassey, Robert Douglass, Sr., James\r\n     Forten, Richard Howell, Robert Purvis.\r\n\r\n     \"_Baltimore_--Thomas Green, James P. Walker, Samuel G. Mathews,\r\n     Isaac Whipper, Samuel Hiner.\r\n\r\n     \"_New Haven_--Biars Stanley, John Creed, Alexander C. Luca.\r\n\r\n     \"_Brooklyn, L. I._--Jacob Deyes, Henry Thomson, Willis Jones.\r\n\r\n     \"_Wilmington, Del._--Rev. Peter Spencer, Jacob Morgan, William S.\r\n     Thomas.\r\n\r\n     \"_Albany_--Benjamin Latimore, Captain Schuyler, Captain Francis\r\n     March.\r\n\r\n     \"_Washington, D. C._--William Jackson, Arthur Waring, Isaac\r\n     Carey.\r\n\r\n     \"_Lancaster, Pa._--Charles Butler and Jared Grey.\r\n\r\n     \"_Carlisle, Pa._--John Peck and Rowland G. Roberts.\r\n\r\n     \"_Chambersburg, Pa._--Dennis Berry.\r\n\r\n     \"_Pittsburgh_--John B. Vashon, Lewis Gardiner, Abraham Lewis.\r\n\r\n     \"_Newark, N. J._--Peter Petitt, Charles Anderson, Adam Ray.\r\n\r\n     \"_Trenton_--Samson Peters, Leonard Scott.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the convention were characterized by a deep\r\nsolemnity and a lively sense of the gravity of the situation. The\r\ndelegates were of the ablest Colored men in the country, and were\r\nconversant with the wants of their people. The subjoined address shows\r\nthat the committee that prepared it had a thorough knowledge of the\r\npublic sentiment of America on the subject of race prejudice.\r\n\r\n     \"CONVENTIONAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     \"_Respected Brethren and Fellow-Citizens:_\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Our attention has been called to investigate the political\r\n     standing of our brethren wherever dispersed, but more\r\n     particularly the situation of those in this great Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"Abroad, we have been cheered with pleasant views of humanity,\r\n     and the steady, firm, and uncompromising march of equal liberty\r\n     to the human family. Despotism, tyranny, and injustice have had\r\n     to retreat, in order to make way for the unalienable rights of\r\n     man. Truth has conquered prejudice, and mankind are about to rise\r\n     in the majesty and splendor of their native dignity.\r\n\r\n     \"The cause of general emancipation is gaining powerful and able\r\n     friends abroad. Britain and Denmark have performed such deeds as\r\n     will immortalize them for their humanity, in the breasts of the\r\n     philanthropists of the present day; whilst, as a just tribute to\r\n     their virtues, after-ages will yet erect unperishable monuments\r\n     to their memory. (Would to God we could say thus of our own\r\n     native soil!)\r\n\r\n     \"And it is only when we look to our own native land, to the\r\n     birthplace of our _fathers_, to the land for whose prosperity\r\n     their blood and our sweat have been shed and cruelly extorted,\r\n     that the Convention has had cause to hang its head and blush.\r\n     Laws, as cruel in themselves as they were unconstitutional and\r\n     unjust, have in many places been enacted against our poor\r\n     unfriended and unoffending brethren; laws, (without a shadow of\r\n     provocation on our part,) at whose bare recital the very savage\r\n     draws him up for fear of the contagion,--looks noble, and prides\r\n     himself because he bears not the name of a Christian.\r\n\r\n     \"But the Convention would not wish to dwell long on this subject,\r\n     as it is one that is too sensibly felt to need description.\r\n\r\n     \"We would wish to turn you from this scene with an eye of pity,\r\n     and a breast glowing with mercy, praying that the recording angel\r\n     may drop a tear, which shall obliterate forever the remembrance\r\n     of so foul a stain upon the national escutcheon of this great\r\n     Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"This spirit of persecution was the cause of our Convention. It\r\n     was that first induced us to seek an asylum in the Canadas; and\r\n     the Convention feels happy to report to its brethren, that our\r\n     efforts to establish a settlement in that province have not been\r\n     made in vain. Our prospects are cheering; our friends and funds\r\n     are daily increasing; wonders have been performed far exceeding\r\n     our most sanguine expectations; already have our brethren\r\n     purchased eight hundred acres of land--and two thousand of them\r\n     have left the soil of their birth, crossed the lines, and laid\r\n     the foundation for a structure which promises to prove an asylum\r\n     for the colored population of these United States. They have\r\n     erected two hundred log-houses, and have five hundred acres under\r\n     cultivation.\r\n\r\n     \"And now it is to your fostering care the Convention appeals, and\r\n     we appeal to you as to men and brethren, yet to enlarge their\r\n     borders.\r\n\r\n     \"We therefore ask of you, brethren,--we ask of you,\r\n     philanthropists of every color and of every kindred,--to assist\r\n     us in this undertaking. We look to a kind Providence and to you\r\n     to say whether our desires shall be realized and our labors\r\n     crowned with success.\r\n\r\n     \"The Convention has done its duty, and it now remains for you,\r\n     brethren, to do yours. Various obstacles have been thrown in our\r\n     way by those opposed to the elevation of the human species; but,\r\n     thanks to an all-wise Providence, his goodness has as yet cleared\r\n     the way, and our advance has been slow but steady. The only thing\r\n     now wanted, is an accumulation of funds, in order to enable us to\r\n     make a purchase agreeable to the direction of the first\r\n     Convention; and, to effect that purpose, the Convention has\r\n     recommended, to the different Societies engaged in that cause, to\r\n     preserve and prosecute their designs with double energy; and we\r\n     would earnestly recommend to every colored man (who feels the\r\n     weight of his degradation), to consider himself in duty bound to\r\n     contribute his mite toward this great object. We would say to\r\n     all, that the prosperity of the rising generation mainly depends\r\n     upon our active exertions.\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, it is with us to say whether they shall assume a rank and\r\n     standing among the nations of the earth, as men and freemen, or\r\n     whether they shall still be prized and held at market-price. Oh,\r\n     then, by a brother's love, and by all that makes man dear to man,\r\n     awake in time! Be wise! Be free! Endeavor to walk with\r\n     circumspection; be obedient to the laws of our common country;\r\n     honor and respect its lawmakers and law-givers; and, through all,\r\n     let us not forget to respect ourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"During the deliberations of this Convention, we had the favor of\r\n     advising and consulting with some of our most eminent and tried\r\n     philanthropists--men of unblemished character and of acknowledged\r\n     rank and standing. Our sufferings have excited their sympathy;\r\n     our ignorance appealed to their humanity; and, brethren, we feel\r\n     that gratitude is due to a kind and benevolent Creator, that our\r\n     excitement and appeal have neither been in vain. A plan has been\r\n     proposed to the Convention for the erection of a college for the\r\n     instruction of young men of color, on the manual-labor system, by\r\n     which the children of the poor may receive a regular classical\r\n     education, as well as those of their more opulent brethren, and\r\n     the charge will be so regulated as to put it within the reach of\r\n     all. In support of this plan, a benevolent individual has offered\r\n     the sum of one thousand dollars, provided that we can obtain\r\n     subscriptions to the amount of nineteen thousand dollars in one\r\n     year.\r\n\r\n     \"The Convention has viewed the plan with considerable interest,\r\n     and, after mature deliberation, on a candid investigation, feels\r\n     strictly justified in recommending the same to the liberal\r\n     patronage of our brethren, and respectfully solicits the aid of\r\n     those philanthropists who feel an interest in sending light,\r\n     knowledge, and truth to all of the human species.\r\n\r\n     \"To the friends of general education, we do believe that our\r\n     appeal will not be in vain. For the present ignorant and degraded\r\n     condition of many of our brethren in these United States (which\r\n     has been a subject of much concern to the Convention) can excite\r\n     no astonishment (although used by our enemies to show our\r\n     inferiority in the scale of human beings); for, what\r\n     opportunities have they possessed for mental cultivation or\r\n     improvement? Mere ignorance, however, in a people divested of the\r\n     means of acquiring information by books, or an extensive\r\n     connection with the world, is no just criterion of their\r\n     intellectual incapacity; and it had been actually seen, in\r\n     various remarkable instances, that the degradation of the mind\r\n     and character, which has been too hastily imputed to a people\r\n     kept, as we are, at a distance from those sources of knowledge\r\n     which abound in civilized and enlightened communities, has\r\n     resulted from no other causes than our unhappy situation and\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     \"True philanthropy disdains to adopt those prejudices against any\r\n     people which have no better foundation than accidental\r\n     diversities of color, and refuses to determine without\r\n     substantial evidence and incontestible fact as the basis of her\r\n     judgment. And it is in order to remove these prejudices, which\r\n     are the actual causes of our ignorance, that we have appealed to\r\n     our friends in support of the contemplated institution.\r\n\r\n     \"The Convention has not been unmindful of the operations of the\r\n     American Colonization Society, and it would respectfully suggest\r\n     to that august body of learning, talent, and worth, that, in our\r\n     humble opinion, strengthened, too, by the opinions of eminent men\r\n     in this country, as well as in Europe, that they are pursuing the\r\n     direct road to perpetuate slavery, with all its unchristianlike\r\n     concomitants, in this boasted land of freedom; and, as citizens\r\n     and men whose best blood is sapped to gain popularity for that\r\n     institution, we would, in the most feeling manner, beg of them to\r\n     desist; or, if we must be sacrificed to their philanthropy, we\r\n     would rather die at home. Many of our fathers, and some of us,\r\n     have fought and bled for the liberty, independence, and peace\r\n     which you now enjoy; and, surely, it would be ungenerous and\r\n     unfeeling in you to deny us an humble and quiet grave in that\r\n     country which gave us birth!\r\n\r\n     \"In conclusion, the Convention would remind our brethren that\r\n     knowledge is power, and to that end, we call on you to sustain\r\n     and support, by all honorable, energetic, and necessary means,\r\n     those presses which are devoted to our instruction and elevation,\r\n     to foster and encourage the mechanical arts and sciences among\r\n     our brethren, to encourage simplicity, neatness, temperance, and\r\n     economy in our habits, taking due care always to give the\r\n     preference to the production of freemen wherever it can be had.\r\n     Of the utility of a General Fund, the Convention believes there\r\n     can exist but one sentiment, and that is for a speedy\r\n     establishment of the same. Finally, we trust our brethren will\r\n     pay due care to take such measures as will ensure a general and\r\n     equal representation in the next Convention\r\n\r\n     [Signed]                           \"BELFAST BURTON,\r\n                                        \"JUNIUS C.

Adopted.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That in the opinion of this committee, we still\r\n     solemnly and sincerely protest against any interference, on the\r\n     part of the American Colonization Society, with the free colored\r\n     population in these United States, so long as they shall\r\n     countenance or endeavor to use coercive measures (either directly\r\n     or indirectly) to colonize us in any place which is not the\r\n     object of our choice. And we ask of them respectfully, as men and\r\n     as Christians, to cease their unhallowed persecutions of a\r\n     people already sufficiently oppressed, or if, as they profess to\r\n     have our welfare and prosperity at heart, to assist us in the\r\n     object of our choice.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That this committee would recommend to the members\r\n     of this Convention, to discountenance, by all just means in their\r\n     power, any emigration to Liberia or Hayti, believing them only\r\n     calculated to distract and divide the whole colored family.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a resolution of the previous day the Rev. R. R.\r\nGurley, Secretary of the American Colonization Society, was invited to\r\naddress the convention. He endeavored to offer an acceptable\r\nexplanation of the Society, and to advocate its principles. But the\r\nColored people, almost to a man, were opposed to colonization; and\r\nmost of the anti-slavery societies regarded colonization as\r\nimpracticable and hurtful to the cause of emancipation. William Lloyd\r\nGarrison happened to be present, and followed Gurley in a speech that\r\ndestroyed the hopes of the friends of colonization, and greatly\r\ndelighted the convention.\r\n\r\nWhile the Colored people opposed colonization they regarded Canada as\r\na proper place to go. They felt that as citizens they had the right to\r\ndecide where to go, and, when they got ready, to go on their own\r\naccount. Canada had furnished an asylum to their flying,\r\ntravel-soiled, foot-sore, and needy brethren,--was not so very far\r\naway, and, therefore, it was preferred to the West Coast of Africa.\r\nThe committee having under consideration this subject, made the\r\nfollowing comprehensive report:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the members of this Convention take into\r\n     consideration the propriety of effecting the purchase of lands in\r\n     the province of Upper Canada, as an asylum for those of our\r\n     bretheren who may be compelled to remove from these United\r\n     States, beg leave, most respectfully to report:\r\n\r\n     \"That, after due consideration, they believe the resolution\r\n     embraces three distinct inquiries for the consideration of this\r\n     Convention, which should be duly weighed before they can adopt\r\n     the sentiments contained in the above-named resolution.\r\n     Therefore, your Committee conceive the resolution premature, and\r\n     now proceed to state the enquiries separately.\r\n\r\n     \"_First._--Is it proper for the Free people of color in this\r\n     country, under existing circumstances, to remove to any distant\r\n     territory beyond these United States?\r\n\r\n     \"_Secondly._--Does Upper Canada possess superior advantages and\r\n     conveniences to those held out in these United States or\r\n     elsewhere?\r\n\r\n     \"_Thirdly._--Is there any certainty that the people of color will\r\n     be compelled by oppressive legislative enactments to abandon the\r\n     land of their birth for a home in a distant region?\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee, before examining those enquiries, would most\r\n     respectfully take a retrospective view of the object for which\r\n     the Convention was first associated, and the causes which have\r\n     actuated their deliberations.\r\n\r\n     \"The expulsory laws of Ohio, in 1829, which drove our people to\r\n     seek a new home in Upper Canada, and their impoverished situation\r\n     afterward, excited a general burst of sympathy for their\r\n     situation, by the wise and good, over the whole country. This\r\n     awakened public feeling on their behalf, and numerous meetings\r\n     were called to raise funds to alleviate their present miseries.\r\n     The bright prospects that then appeared to dawn on the new\r\n     settlement, awakened our people to the precariousness of their\r\n     situations, and, in order more fully to be prepared for future\r\n     exigencies, and to extend the system of benevolence still further\r\n     to those who should remove to Upper Canada, a circular was issued\r\n     by five individuals, viz.:--the Rev. Richard Allen, Cyrus Black,\r\n     Junius C. Morel, Benjamin Pascal, and James C. Cornish, in behalf\r\n     of the citizens of Philadelphia, calling a convention of the\r\n     colored delegates from the several States, to meet on the 20th\r\n     day of September, 1830, to devise plans and means for the\r\n     establishment of a colony in Upper Canada, under the patronage of\r\n     the general Convention, then called.\r\n\r\n     \"That Convention met, pursuant to public notice, and recommended\r\n     the formation of a parent society, to be established, with\r\n     auxiliaries in the different towns where they had been\r\n     represented in _general_ convention, for the purpose of raising\r\n     moneys to defray the object of purchasing a colony in the\r\n     province of Upper Canada, for those who should hereafter wish to\r\n     emigrate thither, and that immediately after its organization, a\r\n     corresponding agent should be appointed to reside at or near the\r\n     intended purchase.\r\n\r\n     \"Our then limited knowledge of the manners, customs, and\r\n     privileges, and rights of aliens in Upper Canada, together with\r\n     the climate, soil, and productions thereof, rendered it necessary\r\n     to send out agents to examine the same, who returned with a\r\n     favorable report, except that citizens of these United States\r\n     could not purchase lands in Upper Canada, and legally transfer\r\n     the same to other individuals.\r\n\r\n     \"The Convention resolved to reassemble on the first Monday in\r\n     June, 1831, during which time the order of the Convention had\r\n     been carried into operation, relative to establishing Societies\r\n     for the promotion of said object; and the sum and total of their\r\n     proceedings were, that the Convention recommended to the colored\r\n     people generally, when persecuted as were our brethren in Ohio,\r\n     to seek an Asylum in Upper Canada. During which time,\r\n     information having been received that a part of the white\r\n     inhabitants of said province had, through prejudice and the fear\r\n     of being overburthened with an ejected population, petitioned the\r\n     provincial parliament to prohibit the general influx of colored\r\n     population from entering their limits, which threw some\r\n     consternation on the prospect. The Convention did not wholly\r\n     abandon the subject, but turned its attention more to the\r\n     elevation of our people in this, our native home.\r\n\r\n     \"The recent occurrences at the South have swelled the tide of\r\n     prejudice until it has almost revolutionized public sentiment,\r\n     which has given birth to severe legislative enactments in some of\r\n     the States, and almost ruined our interests and prospects in\r\n     others, in which, in the opinion of your Committee, our situation\r\n     is more precarious than it has been at any other period since the\r\n     Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n     \"The events of the past year have been more fruitful in\r\n     persecution, and have presented more inducements than any other\r\n     period of the history of our country, for the men of color to fly\r\n     from the graves of their fathers, and seek new homes in a land\r\n     where the roaring billows of prejudice are less injurious to\r\n     their rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee would now approach the present Convention and\r\n     examine the resolution under consideration, beginning with the\r\n     first interrogatory, viz.: Is it proper for the Free people of\r\n     color in this country, under existing circumstances, to remove to\r\n     any distant territory beyond the United States?\r\n\r\n     \"If we admit the first interrogatory to be true, as it is the\r\n     exact spirit of the language of this resolution, now under\r\n     consideration, it is altogether unnecessary for us to make\r\n     further preparation for either our moral, intellectual, or\r\n     political advancement in this our own, our native land.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee also believe that if this Convention shall adopt\r\n     a resolution that will, as soon as means can be obtained, remove\r\n     our colored population to the province of Upper Canada, the best\r\n     and brightest prospect of the philanthropists who are laboring\r\n     for our elevation in this country will be thwarted, and they will\r\n     be brought to the conclusion that the great object which actuated\r\n     their labors would now be removed, and they might now rest from\r\n     their labors and have the painful feeling of transmitting to\r\n     future generations, that an oppressed people, in the land of\r\n     their birth, supported by the genuine philanthropists of the age,\r\n     amidsts friends, companions, and their natural attachments, a\r\n     genial clime, a fruitful soil,--amidst the rays of as proud\r\n     institutions as ever graced the most favored spot that has ever\r\n     received the glorious rays of a meridian sun,--have abandoned\r\n     their homes on account of their persecutions, for a home almost\r\n     similarly precarious, for an abiding-place among strangers!\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee further believe that any express plan to colonize\r\n     our people beyond the limits of these United States, tends to\r\n     weaken the situation of those who are left behind, without any\r\n     peculiar advantage to those who emigrate. But it must be\r\n     admitted, that the rigid oppression abroad in the land is such,\r\n     that a _part_ of our suffering brethren cannot live under it, and\r\n     that the compulsory laws and the inducements held out by the\r\n     American Colonization Society are such as will cause them to\r\n     alienate all their natural attachments to their homes, and accept\r\n     of the only mode left open, which is to remove to a distant\r\n     Country to receive those rights and privileges of which they have\r\n     been deprived. And as this Convention is associated for the\r\n     purpose of recommending to our people the best mode of\r\n     alleviating their present miseries,\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore, your Committee would, most respectfully, recommend to\r\n     the general Convention, now assembled, to exercise the most\r\n     vigorous means to collect monies through their auxiliaries, or\r\n     otherwise, to be applied in such manner, as will advance the\r\n     interests, and contribute to the wants of the free colored\r\n     population of this country generally.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee would now most respectfully approach the _second\r\n     inquiry_, viz.:--Does Upper Canada possess superior advantages\r\n     and conveniences to those held out in the United States or\r\n     elsewhere?\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee, without summing up the advantages and\r\n     disadvantages of other situations, would, most respectfully\r\n     answer in the affirmative. At least they are willing to assert\r\n     that the advantage is much in favor of those who are obliged to\r\n     leave their present homes. For your more particular information\r\n     on that subject we would, most respectfully, refer you to the\r\n     interesting account given by our real and indefatigable friend,\r\n     Benjamin Lundy, in a late number of the \"Genius of Universal\r\n     Emancipation.\" _Vide_ \"Genius of Universal Emancipation,\" No. 10,\r\n     vol. 12.\r\n\r\n     \"From the history there laid down, your Committee would, most\r\n     respectfully, request the Convention to aid, so far as in their\r\n     power lies, those who are obliged to seek an asylum in the\r\n     province of Upper Canada; and, in order that they may more\r\n     effectually carry their views into operation, they would\r\n     respectfully request them to appoint an Agent in Upper Canada, to\r\n     receive such funds as may be there transmitted for their use.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee have now arrived at the _third_ and last inquiry,\r\n     viz.:--Is there any certainty that we, as a people, will be\r\n     compelled to leave this our native land, for a home in a distant\r\n     region? To this inquiry your Committee are unable to answer; it\r\n     belongs to the fruitful events of time to determine. The mistaken\r\n     policy of some of the friends of our improvement, that the same\r\n     could be effected on the shore of Africa, has raised the tide of\r\n     our calamity until it has overflowed the valleys of peace and\r\n     tranquillity--the dark clouds of prejudice have rained\r\n     persecution--the oppressor and the oppressed have suffered\r\n     together--and we have yet been protected by that Almighty arm,\r\n     who holds in his hands the destinies of nations, and whose\r\n     presence is a royal safeguard, should we place the utmost\r\n     reliance on his wisdom and power.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee, while they rejoice at the noble object for which\r\n     the Convention was first associated, have been unable to come to\r\n     any conclusive evidence that lands can be purchased by this\r\n     Convention and legally transferred to individuals, residents of\r\n     said colony, so long as the present laws exist. But, while they\r\n     deem it inexpedient for the Convention to purchase lands in Upper\r\n     Canada for the purpose of erecting a colony thereon, do again,\r\n     most respectfully, hope that they will exercise the same laudable\r\n     exertions to collect funds for the comfort and happiness of our\r\n     people there situated, and those who may hereafter emigrate, and\r\n     pursue the same judicious measures in the appropriation of said\r\n     funds, as they would in procuring a tract of land, as expressed\r\n     by the resolution.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Committee, after examining the various circumstances\r\n     connected with our situation as a people, have come, unanimously,\r\n     to the conclusion to recommend to this Convention to adopt the\r\n     following resolution, as the best mode of alleviating the\r\n     miseries of our oppressed brethren:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That this Convention recommend the establishment of\r\n     a Society, or Agent, in Upper Canada, for the purpose of\r\n     purchasing lands and contributing to the wants of our people\r\n     generally, who may be, by oppressive legislative enactments,\r\n     obliged to flee from these United States and take up residence\r\n     within her borders. And that this Convention will employ its\r\n     auxiliary societies, and such other means as may lie in its\r\n     power, for the purpose of raising monies, and remit the same for\r\n     the purpose of aiding the proposed object.\r\n\r\n          [Signed]    \"ROBERT COWLEY,          }\r\n                      \"JOHN PECK,              }  _Committee._\"\r\n                      \"WM.

In\r\ntheir address the convention did not fail to give the Colonization\r\nSociety a parting shot.\r\n\r\n     \"CONVENTIONAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Free Colored Inhabitants of these United States_:\r\n\r\n     \"FELLOW-CITIZENS: We have again been permitted to associate in\r\n     our representative character, from the different sections of this\r\n     Union, to pour into one common stream, the afflictions, the\r\n     prayers, and sympathies of our oppressed people; the axis of time\r\n     has brought around this glorious, annual event. And we are again\r\n     brought to rejoice that the wisdom of Divine Providence has\r\n     protected us during a year whose autumnal harvest has been a\r\n     reign of terror and persecution, and whose winter has almost\r\n     frozen the streams of humanity by its frigid legislation. It is\r\n     under the influence of times and feelings like these, that we now\r\n     address you. Of a people situated as we are, little can be said,\r\n     except that it becomes our duty strictly to watch those causes\r\n     that operate against our interests and privileges; and to guard\r\n     against whatever measures that will either lower us in the scale\r\n     of being, or perpetuate our degradation in the eyes of the\r\n     civilized world.\r\n\r\n     \"The effects of Slavery on the bond and Colonization on the free.\r\n     Of the first we shall say but little, but will here repeat the\r\n     language of a high-minded Virginian in the Legislature of that\r\n     State, on the recent discussion of the slave question before that\r\n     honorable body, who declared, that man could not hold property in\r\n     man, and that the master held no right to the slave, either by a\r\n     law of nature or a patentee from God, but by the will of society;\r\n     which we declare to be an unjust usurpation of the rights and\r\n     privileges of men.\r\n\r\n     \"But how beautiful must the prospect be to the philanthropist, to\r\n     view us, the children of persecution, grown to manhood,\r\n     associating in our delegated character to devise plans and means\r\n     for our moral elevation, and attracting the attention of the wise\r\n     and good over the whole country, who are anxiously watching our\r\n     deliberations.\r\n\r\n     \"We have here to inform you, that we have patiently listened to\r\n     the able and eloquent arguments produced by the Rev. R. R.\r\n     Gurley, Secretary of the American Colonization Society, in behalf\r\n     of the doings of said Society, and Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Esq., in\r\n     opposition to its action.\r\n\r\n     \"A more favorable opportunity to arrive at truth seldom has been\r\n     witnessed, but while we admire the distinguished piety and\r\n     Christian feelings with which he so solemnly portrayed the\r\n     doctrines of that institution, we do now _assert_, that the\r\n     result of the same has tended more deeply to rivet our solid\r\n     conviction, that the doctrines of said Society are at enmity with\r\n     the principles and precepts of religion, humanity, and justice,\r\n     and should be regarded by every man of color in these United\r\n     States as an evil, for magnitude, unexcelled, and whose doctrines\r\n     aim at the entire extinction of the free colored population and\r\n     the riveting of slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"We might here repeat our protest against that institution, but\r\n     it is unnecessary; your views and sentiments have long since gone\r\n     to the world; the wings of the wind have borne your\r\n     disapprobation to that institution. Time itself cannot erase it.\r\n     You have dated your opposition from its beginning, and your views\r\n     are strengthened by time and circumstances, and they hold the\r\n     uppermost seat in your affections. We have not been unmindful of\r\n     the compulsory laws which caused our brethren in Ohio to seek new\r\n     homes in a distant land, there to share and suffer all the\r\n     inconveniences of exiles in an uncultivated region; which has led\r\n     us to admire the benevolent feelings of a rival government in its\r\n     liberal protection to strangers; which has induced us to\r\n     recommend to you, to exercise your best endeavors, to collect\r\n     monies to secure the purchase of lands in the Canadas, for those\r\n     who may by oppressive legislative enactments be obliged to move\r\n     thither.\r\n\r\n     \"In contributing to our brethren that aid which will secure them\r\n     a refuge in a storm, we would not wish to be understood as\r\n     possessing any inclination to remove, nor in the least to\r\n     impoverish, that noble sentiment which we rejoice in exclaiming--\r\n\r\n               \"This is _our_ own,\r\n               Our native land.\r\n\r\n     \"All that we have done, humanity dictated it; neither inclination\r\n     nor alienated feelings to our country prescribed it, but that\r\n     power which is above all other considerations, viz.: the law of\r\n     necessity.\r\n\r\n     \"We yet anticipate in the moral strength of this nation, a final\r\n     redemption from those evils that have been illegitimately\r\n     entailed on us as a people. We yet expect, by due exertions on\r\n     our part, together with the aid of the benevolent philanthropists\r\n     of our country, to acquire a moral and intellectual strength that\r\n     will unshaft the calumnious darts of our adversaries, and present\r\n     to the world a general character that they will feel bound to\r\n     respect and admire.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be seen by a reference to our proceedings, that we have\r\n     again recommended the further prosecution of the contemplated\r\n     college, proposed by the last Convention, to be established at\r\n     New Haven, under the rules and regulations then established. A\r\n     place for its location will be selected in a climate and\r\n     neighborhood where the inhabitants are less prejudiced to our\r\n     rights and privileges. The proceedings of the citizens of New\r\n     Haven, with regard to the erection of the college, were a\r\n     disgrace to them, and cast a stigma on the reputed fame of New\r\n     England and the country. We are unwilling that the character of\r\n     the whole country should sink by the proceedings of a few. We are\r\n     determined to present to another portion of the country not far\r\n     distant, and at no very remote period, the opportunity of\r\n     gaining for them the character of a truly philanthropic spirit,\r\n     and of retrieving the character of the country, by the\r\n     disreputable proceedings of New Haven. We must have colleges and\r\n     high-schools on the manual-labor system, where our youth may be\r\n     instructed in all the arts of civilized life. If we ever expect\r\n     to see the influence of prejudice decrease, and ourselves\r\n     respected, it must be by the blessings of an enlightened\r\n     education. It must be by being in possession of that classical\r\n     knowledge which promotes genius, and causes man to soar up to\r\n     those high intellectual enjoyments and acquirements, which place\r\n     him in a situation to shed upon a country and a people that\r\n     scientific grandeur which is imperishable by time, and drowns in\r\n     oblivion's cup their moral degradation. Those who think that our\r\n     primary schools are capable of effecting this, are a century\r\n     behind the age when to have proved a question in the rule of\r\n     three was considered a higher attainment than solving the most\r\n     difficult problem in Euclid is now. They might have at that time\r\n     performed what some people expect of them now, in the then barren\r\n     state of science; but they are now no longer capable of\r\n     reflecting brilliancy on our national character, which will\r\n     elevate us from our present situation. If we wish to be\r\n     respected, we must build our moral character on a base as broad\r\n     and high as the nation itself; our country and our character\r\n     require it; we have performed all the duties from the menial to\r\n     the soldier,--our fathers shed their blood in the great struggle\r\n     for independence. In the late war between Great Britain and the\r\n     United States, a proclamation was issued to the free colored\r\n     inhabitants of Louisiana, September 21, 1814, inviting them to\r\n     take up arms in defence of their country, by Gen. Andrew Jackson.\r\n     And in order that you may have an idea of the manner in which\r\n     they acquitted themselves on that perilous occasion, we will\r\n     refer you to the proclamation of Thomas Butler, Aid-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n     \"You there see that your country expects much from you, and that\r\n     you have much to call you into action, morally, religiously, and\r\n     scientifically. Prepare yourselves to occupy the several stations\r\n     to which the wisdom of your country may promote you. We have been\r\n     told in this Convention, by the Secretary of the American\r\n     Colonization Society, that there are causes which forbid our\r\n     advancement in this country, which no humanity, no legislation,\r\n     and no religion can control. Believe it not. Is not humanity\r\n     susceptible of all the tender feelings of benevolence? Is not\r\n     legislation supreme--and is not religion virtuous? Our oppressed\r\n     situation arises from their opposite causes. There is an\r\n     awakening spirit in our people to promote their elevation, which\r\n     speaks volumes in their behalf. We anticipated at the close of\r\n     the last Convention, a larger representation and an increased\r\n     number of delegates; we were not deceived, the number has been\r\n     tenfold. And we have a right to expect that future Conventions\r\n     will be increased by a geometrical ratio, until we shall present\r\n     a body not inferior in numbers to our State Legislatures, and the\r\n     _phenomenon_ of an _oppressed people_, deprived of the rights of\r\n     citizenship, in the midst of an enlightened nation, devising\r\n     plans and measures for their personal and mental elevation, by\r\n     _moral suasion alone_.\r\n\r\n     \"In recommending you a path to pursue for our present good and\r\n     future elevation, we have taken into consideration the\r\n     circumstances of the free colored population, so far as it was\r\n     possible to ascertain their views and sentiments, hoping that at\r\n     a future Convention, you will all come ably represented, and that\r\n     your wishes and views may receive that deliberation and attention\r\n     for which this body is particularly associated.\r\n\r\n     \"Finally, before taking our leave, we would admonish you, by all\r\n     that you hold dear, beware of that bewitching evil, that bane of\r\n     society, that curse of the world, that fell destroyer of the best\r\n     prospects and the last hope of civilized man,--INTEMPERANCE.\r\n\r\n     \"Be righteous, be honest, be just, be economical, be prudent,\r\n     offend not the laws of your country,--in a word, live in that\r\n     purity of life, by both precept and example,--live in the\r\n     constant pursuit of that moral and intellectual strength which\r\n     will invigorate your understandings and render you illustrious in\r\n     the eyes of civilized nations, when they will assert that all\r\n     that illustrious worth which was once possessed by the Egyptians,\r\n     and slept for ages, has now arisen in their descendents, the\r\n     inhabitants of the New World.\"\r\n\r\nExcellent as was the work of these conventions of men of color, they\r\nnevertheless became the magazines from which the pro-slavery element\r\nsecured dangerous ammunition with which to attack the anti-slavery\r\nmovement. The white anti-slavery societies were charged with harboring\r\na spirit of race prejudice; with inconsistency, in that while seeking\r\nfreedom for the Negro by means of agitation, separate efforts were put\r\nforth by the white and black anti-slavery people of the North. And\r\nthis had its due effect. Massachusetts and other States had abolition\r\nsocieties composed entirely of persons of Color. \"_The Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Colored Association_\" organized in the early days of the\r\nagitation movement. It had among its leading men the most intelligent\r\nand public-spirited Colored citizens of Boston. James G. Barbadoes,\r\nCoffin Pitts, John E. Scarlett, the Eastons, Hosea and Joshua; Wm.

Hilton were a few of \"the faithful.\" In January, 1833, the\r\nfollowing communication was sent to the white anti-slavery society of\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\n                                   \"BOSTON, January 15, 1833.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Board of Managers of the New-England Anti-Slavery\r\n     Society_:\r\n\r\n     \"The Massachusetts General Colored Association, cordially\r\n     approving the objects and principles of the New-England\r\n     Anti-Slavery Society, would respectfully communicate their desire\r\n     to become auxiliary thereto. They have accordingly chosen one of\r\n     their members to attend the annual meeting of the Society as\r\n     their delegate (Mr. JOSHUA EASTON, of North Bridgewater), and\r\n     solicit his acceptance in that capacity.\r\n\r\n                                   \"THOMAS DALTON, _President_,\r\n                                   \"WILLIAM C. NELL, _Vice-President_.\r\n\r\n     \"JAMES G. BARBADOES, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nThe request was granted, but a few hints among friends on the outside\r\nsufficed to demonstrate the folly and hurtfulness of anti-slavery\r\nsocieties composed exclusively of men of color. Within the next two\r\nyears Colored organizations perished, and their members took their\r\nplace in the white societies. Such Colored men as John B. Vashon and\r\nRobert Purvis, of Pennsylvania; David Ruggles and Philip A. Bell, of\r\nNew York; and Charles Lenox Remond and Wm. Wells Brown, of\r\nMassachusetts, were soon seen as orators and presiding officers, in\r\nthe different anti-slavery societies of the free States. Frederick\r\nDouglass, the Rev. Samuel Ringgold Ward, James McCune Smith, M.D.;\r\nJames W. C. Pennington, D.D.; Henry Highland Garnett, D.D.; Alexander\r\nCrummell, D.D.; and other Colored men were eloquent, earnest, and\r\neffective in their denunciation of the institution that enslaved their\r\nbrethren. In England and in Europe a corps of intelligent Colored\r\norators was kept busy painting, to interested audiences, the cruelties\r\nand iniquities of American slavery. By association and sympathy these\r\nColored orators took on the polish of Anglo-Saxon scholarship. Of the\r\ninfluence of the American Anti-slavery Society upon the Colored man,\r\nMaria Weston Chapman once said, it is \"church and university, high\r\nschool and common school, to all who need real instruction and true\r\nreligion. Of it what a throng of authors, editors, lawyers, orators,\r\nand accomplished gentlemen of color have taken their degree! It has\r\nequally implanted hopes and aspirations, noble thoughts, and sublime\r\npurposes, in the hearts of both races. It has prepared the white man\r\nfor the freedom of the black man, and it has made the black man scorn\r\nthe thought of enslavement, as does a white man, as far as its\r\ninfluence has extended. _Strengthen that noble influence!_ Before its\r\norganization, the country only saw here and there in slavery some\r\n'faithful Cudjoe or Dinah,' whose strong natures blossomed even in\r\nbondage, like a fine plant beneath a heavy stone. Now, under the\r\nelevating and cherishing influence of the American Anti-slavery\r\nSociety, the colored race, like the white, furnishes Corinthian\r\ncapitals for the noblest temples. Aroused by the American Anti-slavery\r\nSociety, the very white men who had forgotten and denied the claim of\r\nthe black man to the rights of humanity, now thunder that claim at\r\nevery gate, from cottage to capitol, from school-house to university,\r\nfrom the railroad carriage to the house of God. He has a place at\r\ntheir firesides, a place in their hearts--the man whom they once\r\ncruelly hated for his color. So feeling, they _cannot_ send him to\r\nCoventry with a horn-book in his hand, and call it _instruction_! They\r\ninspire him to climb to their side by a visible, acted gospel of\r\nfreedom. Thus, instead of bowing to prejudice, they conquer it.\"\r\n\r\nIn January, 1836, Rev. Mr. Follen offered the following resolution in\r\na meeting of the New England Anti-slavery Society:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we consider the Anti-slavery cause the cause of\r\n     philanthropy, with regard to which all human beings, white men\r\n     and colored men, citizens and foreigners, men and women, have the\r\n     same duties and the same rights.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of his resolution, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"We have been advised, if we really wished to benefit the slave\r\n     and the colored race generally, not unnecessarily to shock the\r\n     feelings, though they were but prejudices, of the white people,\r\n     by admitting colored persons to our Anti-slavery meetings and\r\n     societies. We have been told that many who would otherwise act in\r\n     unison with us were kept away by our disregard of the feelings of\r\n     the community in this respect.... But what, I would ask, is the\r\n     great, the single object of all our meetings and societies? Have\r\n     we any other object than to impress upon the community this one\r\n     principle, that the _colored man is a man_? And, on the other\r\n     hand, is not the prejudice which would have us exclude colored\r\n     people from our meetings and societies the same which, in our\r\n     Southern States, dooms them to perpetual bondage?\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1837, the _Anti-slavery Women of America_ met in convention in\r\nNew York. In a circular issued by the authority of the convention, and\r\nsigned by Mary S. Parker, President, Angelina E. Grimkie, Secretary,\r\nanother attack was made upon proscription in anti-slavery societies.\r\nThere was a Colored lady named Sarah Douglass on the Central\r\nCommittee. The following paragraphs from the circular are specimens\r\nsufficient to show the character of the circular; and the poetry at\r\nthe end, written by a Colored member. Miss Sarah Forten, justified the\r\nhopes of her white sisters concerning the race:\r\n\r\n     \"Those Societies that reject colored members, or seek to avoid\r\n     them, have never been active or efficient. The blessing of God\r\n     does not rest upon them, because they 'keep back a part of the\r\n     price of the land,'--they do not lay _all_ at the apostle's feet.\r\n\r\n     \"The abandonment of prejudice is required of us as a proof of our\r\n     sincerity and consistency. How can we ask our Southern brethren\r\n     to make sacrifices, if we are not even willing to encounter\r\n     inconveniences? First cast the beam from thine own eye, then wilt\r\n     thou see clearly to cast it from his eye.\r\n\r\n               \"We are thy sisters. God has truly said\r\n               That of one blood the nations He has made.\r\n               O Christian woman! in a Christian land,\r\n               Canst thou unblushing read this great command?\r\n               Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heart,\r\n               To draw one throb of pity on thy part?\r\n               Our Skins may differ, but from thee we claim\r\n               A sister's privilege and a sister's name.\"\r\n\r\nEvery barrier was now broken down inside of anti-slavery\r\norganizations; and having conquered the prejudice that crippled their\r\nwork, they enjoyed greater freedom in the prosecution of their labors.\r\n\r\nThe Colored orators wrought a wonderful change in public sentiment. In\r\nthe inland white communities throughout the Northern States Negroes\r\nwere few, and the majority of them were servants; some of them\r\nindolent and vicious. From these few the moral and intellectual\r\nphotograph of the entire race was taken. So it was meet that Negro\r\norators of refinement should go from town to town. The North needed\r\narousing and educating on the anti-slavery question, and no class did\r\nmore practical work in this direction than the little company of\r\norators, with the peerless Douglass at its head, that pleaded the\r\ncause of their brethren in the flesh before the cultivated audiences\r\nof New England, the Middle and Western States,--yea, even in the\r\ncapital cities of conservative Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] The Minutes, in possession of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNEGRO INSURRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n     THE NEGRO NOT SO DOCILE AS SUPPOSED.--THE REASON WHY HE WAS KEPT\r\n     IN BONDAGE.--NEGROES POSSESSED COURAGE BUT LACKED\r\n     LEADERS.--INSURRECTION OF SLAVES.--GEN.

But this was a misinterpretation of his real character.\r\nBesides, it was next to impossible to learn the history of the Negro\r\nduring the years of his enslavement at the South. The question was\r\noften asked: Why don't the Negroes rise at the South and exterminate\r\ntheir enslavers? Negatively, not because they lacked the courage, but\r\nbecause they lacked leaders [as has been stated already, they sought\r\nthe North and their freedom through the Underground R. R.] to organize\r\nthem. But notwithstanding this great disadvantage the Negroes _did_\r\nrise on several different occasions, and did effective work.\r\n\r\n     \"Three times, at intervals of thirty years, has a wave of\r\n     unutterable terror swept across the Old Dominion, bringing\r\n     thoughts of agony to every Virginian master, and of vague hope to\r\n     every Virginian slave. Each time has one man's name become a\r\n     spell of dismay and a symbol of deliverance. Each time has that\r\n     name eclipsed its predecessor, while recalling it for a moment to\r\n     fresher memory; John Brown revived the story of Nat. Turner, as\r\n     in his day Nat. Turner recalled the vaster schemes of\r\n     Gabriel.\"[29]\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the insurrection of slaves in South Carolina\r\nin the last century. Upon the very threshold of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, \"General Gabriel\" made the master-class of Virginia quail\r\nwith mortal dread. He was a man of more than ordinary intelligence;\r\nand his plans were worthy of greater success. The following newspaper\r\nparagraph reveals the condition of the minds of Virginians respecting\r\nthe Negroes:\r\n\r\n     \"For the week past, we have been under momentary expectation of a\r\n     rising among the negroes, who have assembled to the number of\r\n     nine hundred or a thousand, and threatened to massacre all the\r\n     whites. They are armed with desperate weapons, and secrete\r\n     themselves in the woods. God only knows our fate; we have strong\r\n     guards every night under arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe above was communicated to the \"United States Gazette,\" printed in\r\nPhiladelphia, under date of September 8, 1800, by a Virginia\r\ncorrespondent. The people felt that they were sleeping over a\r\nmagazine. The movement of Gabriel was to have taken place on Saturday,\r\nSeptember 1st. The rendezvous of the Negro troops was a brook, about\r\nsix miles from Richmond. The force was to comprise eleven hundred men,\r\ndivided into three divisions. Richmond--then a town of eight thousand\r\ninhabitants--was the point of attack, which was to be effected under\r\ncover of night. The right wing was to fall suddenly upon the\r\npenitentiary, lately improvised into an arsenal; the left wing was to\r\nseize the powder-house; and, thus equipped and supplied with the\r\nmunitions of war, the two columns were to assign the hard fighting to\r\nthe third column. This column was to have possession of all the guns,\r\nswords, knives, and other weapons of modern warfare. It was to strike\r\na sharp blow by entering the town from both ends, while the other two\r\ncolumns, armed with shovels, picks, clubs, etc., were to act as a\r\nreserve. The white troops were scarce, and the situation, plans, etc.,\r\nof the Negroes were admirable.\r\n\r\n     \"... the penitentiary held several thousand stand of arms; the\r\n     powder-house was well-stocked; the capitol contained the State\r\n     treasury; the mills would give them bread; the control of the\r\n     bridge across James River would keep off enemies from beyond.\r\n     Thus secured and provided, they planned to issue proclamations\r\n     summoning to their standard 'their fellow-negroes and the friends\r\n     of humanity throughout the continent.' In a week, it was\r\n     estimated, they would have fifty thousand men on their side, with\r\n     which force they could easily possess themselves of other towns;\r\n     and, indeed, a slave named John Scott--possibly the dangerous\r\n     possessor of ten dollars--was already appointed to head the\r\n     attack on Petersburg. But in case of final failure, the project\r\n     included a retreat to the mountains, with their newfound\r\n     property. John Brown was therefore anticipated by Gabriel sixty\r\n     years before, in believing the Virginia mountains to have been\r\n     'created, from the foundation of the world, as a place of refuge\r\n     for fugitive slaves.'\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe plot failed, but everybody, and the newspapers also, said the plan\r\nwas well conceived.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 another Negro insurrection was planned in Charleston, S. C.\r\nThe leader of this affair was Denmark Vesey.[31] This plot for an\r\ninsurrection extended for forty-five or fifty miles around Charleston,\r\nand intrusted its secrets to thousands. Denmark Vesey, assisted by\r\nseveral other intelligent and trusty Negroes, had conceived the idea\r\nof slaughtering the whites in and about Charleston, and thus securing\r\nliberty for the blacks. A recruiting committee was formed, and every\r\nslave enlisted was sworn to secrecy. Household servants were rarely\r\ntrusted. Talkative and intemperate slaves were not enlisted. Women\r\nwere excluded from the affair that they might take care of the\r\nchildren. Peter Poyas, it was said, had enlisted six hundred without\r\nassistance. There were various opinions respecting the number\r\nenlisted. Some put it at hundreds, others thousands; one witness at\r\nthe trial said there were nine thousand, another six thousand. But no\r\nwhite person ever succeeded in gaining the confidence of the black\r\nconspirators. Never was a plot so carefully guarded for so long a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n     \"During the excitement and the trial of the supposed\r\n     conspirators, rumor proclaimed all, and doubtless more than all,\r\n     the horrors of the plot. The city was to be fired in every\r\n     quarter, the arsenal in the immediate vicinity was to be broken\r\n     open, and the arms distributed to the insurgents, and an\r\n     universal massacre of the white inhabitants to take place. Nor\r\n     did there seem to be any doubt in the mind of the people that\r\n     such would actually have been the result, had not the plot\r\n     fortunately been detected before the time appointed for the\r\n     outbreak. It was believed, as a matter of course, that every\r\n     black in the city would join in the insurrection, and that, if\r\n     the original design had been attempted, and the city taken by\r\n     surprise, the negroes would have achieved a complete and easy\r\n     victory. Nor does it seem at all impossible that such might have\r\n     been or yet may be the case, if any well-arranged and resolute\r\n     rising should take place.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThis bold plot failed because a Negro named William Paul began to make\r\nenlistments without authority. He revealed the secret to a household\r\nservant, just the very man he should have left to the skilful\r\nmanipulations of Peter Poyas or Denmark Vesey. As an evidence of the\r\nperfection of the plot it should be stated that after a month of\r\nofficial investigation only fifteen out of the thousands had been\r\napprehended!\r\n\r\n\"The leaders of this attempt at insurrection died as bravely as they\r\nhad lived; and it is one of the marvels of the remarkable affair, that\r\nnone of this class divulged, any of their secrets to the court. The\r\nmen who did the talking were those who knew but little.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect was to reveal the evils of slavery, to stir men to thought,\r\nand to hasten the day of freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Nat.\" Turner combined the lamb and lion. He was a Christian and a\r\n_man_. He was conscious that he was a man and not a \"thing\";\r\ntherefore, driven by religious fanaticism, he undertook a difficult\r\nand bloody task. Nathaniel Turner was born in Southampton County,\r\nVirginia, October 2, 1800. His master was one Benjamin Turner, a very\r\nwealthy and aristocratic man. He owned many slaves, and was a cruel\r\nand exacting master. Young \"Nat.\" was born of slave parents, and\r\ncarried to his grave many of the superstitions and traits of his\r\nfather and mother. The former was a preacher; the latter a \"mother in\r\nIsrael.\" Both were unlettered, but, nevertheless, very pious people.\r\nThe mother began when Nat. was quite young to teach him that he was\r\nborn, like Moses, to be the deliverer of his race. She would sing to\r\nhim snatches of wild, rapturous songs, and repeat portions of prophecy\r\nshe had learned from the preachers of those times. Nat. listened with\r\nreverence and awe, and believed every thing his mother said. He\r\nimbibed the deep religious character of his parents, and soon\r\nmanifested a desire to preach. He was solemnly set apart to \"the\r\nGospel Ministry\" by his father, the Church, and visiting preachers. He\r\nwas quite low in stature, dark, and had the genuine African features.\r\nHis eyes were small, but sharp, and gleamed like fire when he was\r\ntalking about his \"mission,\" or preaching from some prophetic passage\r\nof Scripture. It is said that he never laughed. He was a dreamy sort\r\nof a man, and avoided the crowd. Like Moses, he lived in the solitudes\r\nof the mountains and brooded over the condition of his people. There\r\nwas something grand to him in the rugged scenery that nature had\r\nsurrounded him with. He believed that he was a prophet, a leader\r\nraised up by God to burst the bolts of the prison-house and set the\r\noppressed free. The thunder, the hail, the storm-cloud, the air, the\r\nearth, the stars, at which he would sit and gaze half the night, all\r\nspake the language of the God of the oppressed. He was seldom seen in\r\na large company, and never drank a drop of ardent spirits. Like John\r\nthe Baptist, when he had delivered his message, he would retire to the\r\nfastness of the mountain, or seek the desert, where he could meditate\r\nupon his great work.\r\n\r\nAt length he declared that God spake to him. He began to dream dreams\r\nand to see visions. His grandmother, a very old and superstitious\r\nperson, encouraged him in his dreaming. But, notwithstanding, he\r\nbelieved that he had communion with God, and saw the most remarkable\r\nvisions, he denounced in the severest terms the familiar practices\r\namong slaves, known as \"conjuring,\" \"gufering,\" and fortune-telling.\r\nThe people regarded him with mixed feelings of fear and reverence. He\r\npreached with great power and authority. He loved the prophecies, and\r\ndrew his illustrations from nature. He presented God as the\r\n\"_All-Powerful_\"; he regarded him as a great \"_Warrior_.\" His master\r\nsoon discovered that Nat. was the acknowledged leader among the\r\nslaves, and that his fame as \"prophet\" and \"leader\" was spreading\r\nthroughout the State. The poor slaves on distant plantations regarded\r\nthe name of Nat. Turner as very little removed from that of God.\r\nThough having never seen him, yet they believed in him as the man\r\nunder whose lead they would some time march out of the land of\r\nbondage. His influence was equally great among the preachers, while\r\nmany white people honored and feared him. His master thought it\r\nnecessary to the safety of his property, to hire Nat. out to a most\r\nviolent and cruel man. Perhaps he thought to have him \"broke.\" If so,\r\nhe was mistaken. Nat. Turner was the last slave to submit to an insult\r\ngiven by a white man. His new master could do nothing with him. He ran\r\noff, and spent thirty days in the swamps--but returned. He was\r\nupbraided by some of his fellow-slaves for not seeking, as he\r\ncertainly could have done, \"the land of the free.\" He answered by\r\nsaying, that a voice said to him: \"Return to your earthly master; for\r\nhe who knoweth his Master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten\r\nwith many stripes.\" It was no direction to submit to an earthly\r\nmaster, but to return to him in order to carry out the will of his\r\nHeavenly Master. He related some of the visions he saw during his\r\nabsence. \"About that time I had a vision, and saw white spirits and\r\nblack spirits engaged in battle; and the sun was darkened, the thunder\r\nrolled in the heavens, and blood flowed in streams; and I heard a\r\nvoice saying: 'Such is your luck, such are you called on to see; and\r\nlet it come, rough or smooth, you must surely bear it.' It was not\r\nlong after this when he saw another vision. He says a spirit appeared\r\nunto him and spake as follows: \"The serpent is loosened, and Christ\r\nhas laid down the yoke he has borne for the sins of men; and you must\r\ntake it up and fight against the serpent, for the time is fast\r\napproaching when the first shall be last, and the last shall be\r\nfirst.\" These visions and many others enthused Nat., and led him to\r\nbelieve that the time was near when the Blacks would be \"first\" and\r\nthe whites \"last.\"\r\n\r\nThe plot for a general uprising was laid in the month of February,\r\n1831. He had seen the last vision. He says: \"I was told I should arise\r\nand prepare myself, and slay my enemies with their own weapons.\" He\r\nwas now prepared to arrange the details of his plot. He appointed a\r\nmeeting, to which he invited four trusted friends, Sam. Edwards, Hark\r\nTravis, Henry Porter, and Nelson Williams. A wild and desolate glen\r\nwas chosen as the place of meeting, and night the time when they could\r\nperfect their plans without being molested by the whites. They brought\r\nwith them provisions, and ate while they debated among themselves the\r\nmethods by which to carry out their plan of blood and death. The main\r\ndifficulty that confronted them was how to get arms. Nat. remembered\r\nthat a spirit had instructed him to \"slay my enemies with their own\r\nweapons,\" so they decided to follow these instructions. After they had\r\ndecided upon a plan, \"the prophet Nat.\" arose, and, like a great\r\ngeneral, made a speech to his small but brave force. \"Friends and\r\nbrothers,\" said he, \"we are to commence a great work to-night! Our\r\nrace is to be delivered from slavery, and God has appointed us as the\r\nmen to do his bidding; and let us be worthy of our calling. I am told\r\nto slay all the whites we encounter, without regard to age or sex. We\r\nhave no arms or ammunition, but we will find these in the houses of\r\nour oppressors; and, as we go on, others can join us. Remember, we do\r\nnot go forth for the sake of blood and carnage; but it is necessary\r\nthat, in the commencement of this revolution, all the whites we meet\r\nshould die, until we have an army strong enough to carry on the war\r\nupon a Christian basis. Remember that ours is not a war for robbery,\r\nnor to satisfy our passions; it is a _struggle for freedom_. Ours must\r\nbe deeds, not words. Then let's away to the scene of action!\"\r\n\r\nThe blow was struck on the night of the 21st of August, 1831, in\r\nSouthampton County, near Jerusalem Court-House. The latter place is\r\nabout seventy miles from Richmond. Not only Southampton County but old\r\nVirginia reeled under the blow administered by the heavy hand of Nat.\r\nTurner. On their way to the first house they were to attack, that of a\r\nplanter by the name of Joseph Travis, they were joined by a slave\r\nbelonging to a neighboring plantation. We can find only one name for\r\nhim, \"Will.\" He was the slave of a cruel master, who had sold his wife\r\nto the \"nigger traders.\" He was nearly six feet in height, well\r\ndeveloped, and the most powerful and athletic man in the county. He\r\nwas marked with an ugly scar, extending from his right eye to the\r\nextremity of the chin. He hated his master, hated slavery, and was\r\nglad of an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon the whites. He\r\narmed himself with a sharp broadaxe, under whose cruel blade many a\r\nwhite man fell. Nat.'s speech gives us a very clear idea of the scope\r\nand spirit of his plan. We quote from his confession at the time of\r\nthe trial, and will let him tell the story of this terrible\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\n     \"On returning to the house, Hark went to the door with an axe,\r\n     for the purpose of breaking it open, as we knew we were strong\r\n     enough to murder the family should they be awakened by the noise;\r\n     but, reflecting that it might create an alarm in the\r\n     neighborhood, we determined to enter the house secretly, and\r\n     murder them whilst sleeping. Hark got a ladder and set it against\r\n     the chimney, on which I ascended, and, hoisting a window, entered\r\n     and came down stairs, unbarred the doors, and removed the guns\r\n     from their places. It was then observed that I must spill the\r\n     first blood, on which, armed with a hatchet and accompanied by\r\n     Will., I entered my master's chamber. It being dark, I could not\r\n     give a death-blow. The hatchet glanced from his head; he sprang\r\n     from his bed and called his wife. It was his last word. Will.\r\n     laid him dead with a blow of his axe.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had taken the lives of this family, they went from\r\nplantation to plantation, dealing death-blows to every white man,\r\nwoman, or child they found. They visited vengeance upon every white\r\nhousehold they came to. The excitement spread rapidly, and the whites\r\narose and armed themselves in order to repel these insurrectionists.\r\n\r\n     \"The first news concerning the affair was in the shape of a\r\n     letter from Col. Trezvant, which reached Richmond Tuesday\r\n     morning, too late for the columns of the (Richmond) \"Enquirer,\"\r\n     which was a triweekly. The letter was written on the 21st of\r\n     August, and lacked definiteness, which gave rise to doubts in\r\n     reference to the 'insurrection.' It was first sent to\r\n     Petersburgh, and was then immediately dispatched to the Mayor of\r\n     Richmond.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Arms and ammunition were dispatched in wagons to the county of\r\n     Southampton. The four volunteer companies of Petersburgh, the\r\n     dragoons and Lafayette artillery company of Richmond, one\r\n     volunteer company from Norfolk and one from Portsmouth, and the\r\n     regiments of Southampton and Sussex, were at once ordered out.\r\n     The cavalry and infantry took up their line of march on Tuesday\r\n     evening, while the artillery embarked on the steamer 'Norfolk,'\r\n     and landed at Smithfield.... A member of the Richmond dragoons,\r\n     writing from Petersburgh, under date of the 23d, after careful\r\n     examination, thought that 'about two hundred and fifty negroes\r\n     from a camp-meeting about the Dismal Swamp had murdered about\r\n     sixty, persons, none of them families much known.'\"[33]\r\n\r\nWill., the revengeful slave, proved himself the most destructive and\r\ncruel of Nat.'s followers. A hand to hand battle came. The whites were\r\nwell armed, and by the force of their superior numbers overcame the\r\narmy of the \"Prophet,\"--five men. Will. would not surrender. He laid\r\nthree white men dead at his feet, when he fell mortally wounded. His\r\nlast words were: \"Bury my axe with me,\" believing that in the next\r\nworld he would need it for a similar purpose. Nat. fought with great\r\nvalor and skill with a short sword, and finding it useless to continue\r\nthe struggle, escaped with some of his followers to the swamps, where\r\nhe defied the vigilance of the military and the patient watching of\r\nthe citizens for more than two months. He was finally compelled to\r\nsurrender. When the Court asked: \"Guilty or not guilty?\" he pleaded:\r\n\"Not guilty.\" He was sustained during his trial by his unfaltering\r\nfaith in God. Like Joan of Arc, he \"heard the spirits,\" the \"voices,\"\r\nand believed that God had \"sent him to free His people.\"\r\n\r\nIn the impression of the \"Enquirer\" of the 30th of August, 1831, the\r\nfirst editorial, or leader, is under the caption of THE BANDITTE. The\r\neditor says:\r\n\r\n     \"They remind one of a parcel of blood-thirsty wolves rushing down\r\n     from the Alps; or, rather like a former incursion of the Indians\r\n     upon the white settlements. Nothing is spared: neither age nor\r\n     sex respected--the helplessness of women and children pleads in\r\n     vain for mercy.... The case of Nat. Turner warns us. No black-man\r\n     ought to be permitted to turn a Preacher through the country. The\r\n     law must be enforced--or the tragedy of Southampton appeals to us\r\n     in vain.\"[34]\r\n\r\nA remarkable prophecy was made by Nat. The trial was hurried, and,\r\nlike a handle on a pitcher, was on one side only. He was sentenced to\r\ndie on the gallows. He received the announcement with stoic\r\nindifference, and was executed at Jerusalem, the county seat of\r\nSouthampton, in April, 1831. He died like a man, bravely, calmly;\r\nlooking into eternity, made radiant by a faith that had never\r\nfaltered. He prophesied that on the day of his execution the sun would\r\nbe darkened, and other evidences of divine disapprobation would be\r\nseen. The sheriff was much impressed by Nat.'s predictions, and\r\nconsequently refused to have any thing to do with the hanging. No\r\nColored man could be secured to cut the rope that held the trap. An\r\nold white man, degraded by drink and other vices, was engaged to act\r\nas executioner, and was brought forty miles. Whether it was a\r\nfulfilment of Nat.'s prophecy or not, the sun was hidden behind angry\r\nclouds, the thunder rolled, the lightning flashed, and the most\r\nterrific storm visited that county ever known. All this, in connection\r\nwith Nat.'s predictions, made a wonderful impression upon the minds of\r\nthe Colored people, and not a few white persons were frightened, and\r\nregretted the death of the \"Prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of this uprising, led by a lone man--he was alone, and\r\nyet he was not alone,--are apparent when we consider that fifty-seven\r\nwhites and seventy-three Blacks were killed and many were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe first reliable list of the victims of the \"tragedy\" was written on\r\nthe 24th of August, 1831.\r\n\r\n     \"List of the dead that have been buried:--At Mrs. Whiteheads', 7;\r\n     Mrs. Waller's, 13; Mr. Williams', 3; Mr. Barrows', 2; Mr.\r\n     Vaughn's, 5; Mrs. Turner's, 3; Mr. Travis's, 5; Mr. J. Williams',\r\n     5; Mr. Reice's, 4; Names unknown, 10; Total, 57.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was a feeling of unrest among the slaves and a fear among\r\nthe whites throughout the State. Even the proceedings of the trial of\r\nNat. were suppressed for fear of evil consequences among the slaves.\r\nBut now all are free, and the ex-planters will not gnash their teeth\r\nat this revelation. Nat. Turner's insurrection, like all other\r\ninsurrections led by oppressed people, lacked detail and method.\r\nHistory records but one successful uprising--San Domingo has the\r\nhonor. Even France failed in 1789, and in 1848. There is always a zeal\r\nfor freedom, but not according to knowledge. No stone marks the\r\nresting-place of this martyr to freedom, this great religious fanatic,\r\nthis Black John Brown. And yet he has a prouder and more durable\r\nmonument than was ever erected of stone or brass. The image of Nat.\r\nTurner is carved on the fleshy tablets of four million hearts. His\r\nhistory has been kept from the Colored people, at the South, but the\r\nwomen have handed the tradition to their children, and the \"Prophet\r\nNat.\" is still marching on.\r\n\r\nOf the character of this remarkable man, Mr. Gray, the gentleman to\r\nwhom he made his confession, had the following to say:--\r\n\r\n     \"It has been said that he was ignorant and cowardly, and that his\r\n     object was to murder and rob, for the purpose of obtaining money\r\n     to make his escape. It is notorious that he was never known to\r\n     have a dollar in his life, to swear an oath, or drink a drop of\r\n     spirits. As to his ignorance, he certainly never had the\r\n     advantages of education; but he can read and write, and for\r\n     natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension, is surpassed\r\n     by few men I have ever seen. As to his being a coward, his\r\n     reason, as given, for not resisting Mr. Phipps, shows the\r\n     decision of his character. When he saw Mr. Phipps present his\r\n     gun, he said he knew it was impossible for him to escape, as the\r\n     woods were full of men; he therefore thought it was better for\r\n     him to surrender, and trust to fortune for his escape.\r\n\r\n     \"He is a complete fanatic, or plays his part most admirably. On\r\n     other subjects he possesses an uncommon share of intelligence,\r\n     with a mind capable of attaining any thing, but warped and\r\n     perverted by the influence of early impressions. He is below the\r\n     ordinary stature, though strong and active, having the true negro\r\n     face, every feature of which is strongly marked. I shall not\r\n     attempt to describe the effect of his narrative, as told and\r\n     commented on by himself, in the condemned hole of the prison: the\r\n     calm, deliberate composure with which he spoke of his late deeds\r\n     and intentions; the expression of his fiend-like face, when\r\n     excited by enthusiasm; still bearing the stains of the blood of\r\n     helpless innocence about him, clothed with rags and covered with\r\n     chains, yet daring to raise his manacled hands to Heaven, with a\r\n     spirit soaring above the attributes of man. I looked on him, and\r\n     the blood curdled in my veins.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Richmond Enquirer,\" of September 2, 1831, appeared the\r\nfollowing: \"It is reported that a map was found, and said to have been\r\ndrawn by Nat. Turner, with _polk-berry juice_, which was a description\r\nof the county of Southampton.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of this bloody insurrection spread beyond the Old\r\nDominion, and for years afterward, in nearly every Southern State the\r\nwhites lived in a state of dread. To every dealer in flesh and blood\r\nthe \"Nat. Turner Insurrection\" was a stroke of poetic justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Atlantic Monthly, vol. x. p. 337.\r\n\r\n[30] Atlantic Monthly, vol. x. p. 339.\r\n\r\n[31] Atlantic Monthly, vol. vii. pp. 728, 744.\r\n\r\n[32] Atlantic Monthly, vol. vii. p. 737.\r\n\r\n[33] Richmond Enquirer, August 26, 1831.\r\n\r\n[34] Richmond Enquirer, August 26 and 30, 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE \"AMISTAD\" CAPTIVES.\r\n\r\n     THE SPANISH SLAVER \"AMISTAD\" SAILS FROM HAVANA, CUBA, FOR PORTO\r\n     PRINCIPE.--FIFTY-FOUR NATIVE AFRICANS ON BOARD.--JOSEPH CINQUEZ,\r\n     THE SON OF AN AFRICAN PRINCE.--THE \"AMISTAD\" CAPTURED AND TAKEN\r\n     INTO NEW LONDON, CONN.--TRIAL AND RELEASE OF THE SLAVES.--TOUR\r\n     THROUGH THE UNITED STATES.--RETURN TO THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY IN\r\n     COMPANY WITH MISSIONARIES.--THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE BENEFITED BY\r\n     THEIR STAY IN THE UNITED STATES.--THEIR APPRECIATION OF CHRISTIAN\r\n     CIVILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, 1839, the \"Amistad,\" a Spanish slaver (schooner),\r\nwith Captain Ramon Ferrer in command, sailed from Havana, Cuba, for\r\nPorto Principe, a place in the island of Cuba, about 100 leagues\r\ndistant. The passengers were Don Pedro Montes and Jose Ruiz, with\r\nfifty-four Africans just from their native country, Lemboko, as\r\nslaves. Among the slaves was one man, called in Spanish, Joseph\r\nCinquez,[35] said to be the son of an African prince. He was possessed\r\nof wonderful natural abilities, and was endowed with all the elements\r\nof an intelligent and intrepid leader. The treatment these captives\r\nreceived was very cruel. They were chained down between the\r\ndecks--space not more than four feet--by their wrists and ankles;\r\nforced to eat rice, sick or well, and whipped upon the slightest\r\nprovocation. On the fifth night out, Cinquez chose a few trusty\r\ncompanions of his misfortunes, and made a successful attack upon the\r\nofficers and crew. The captain and cook struck down, two sailors put\r\nashore, the Negroes were in full possession of the vessel. Montes was\r\ncompelled, under pain of death, to navigate the vessel to Africa. He\r\nsteered eastwardly during the daytime, but at night put about hoping\r\nto touch the American shore. Thus the vessel wandered until it was\r\ncited off of the coast of the United States during the month of\r\nAugust. It was described as a \"long, low, black schooner.\" Notice was\r\nsent to all the collectors of the ports along the Atlantic Coast, and\r\na steamer and several revenue cutters were dispatched after her.\r\nFinally, on the 26th of August, 1839, Lieut. Gedney, U. S. Navy,\r\ncaptured the \"Amistad,\" and took her into New London, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe two Spaniards and a Creole cabin boy were examined before Judge\r\nAndrew T. Judson, of the United States Court, who, without examining\r\nthe Negroes, bound them over to be tried as pirates. The poor Africans\r\nwere cast into the prison at New London. Public curiosity was at a\r\nhigh pitch; and for a long time the \"_Amistad captives_\" occupied a\r\nlarge place in public attention. The Africans proved to be natives of\r\nthe Mendi country, and quite intelligent. The romantic story of their\r\nsufferings and meanderings was given to the country through a\r\ncompetent interpreter; and many Christian hearts turned toward them in\r\ntheir lonely captivity in a strange land. The trial was continued\r\nseveral months. During this time the anti-slavery friends provided\r\ninstruction for the Africans. Their minds were active and receptive.\r\nThey soon learned to read, write, and do sums in arithmetic. They\r\ncultivated a garden of some fifteen acres, and proved themselves an\r\nintelligent and industrious people.\r\n\r\nThe final decision of the court was that the \"Amistad captives\" were\r\nnot slaves, but freemen, and, as such, were entitled to their liberty.\r\nThe good and liberal Lewis Tappan had taken a lively interest in these\r\npeople from the first, and now that they were released from prison,\r\nfelt that they should be sent back to their native shores and a\r\nmission started amongst their countrymen. Accordingly he took charge\r\nof them and appeared before the public in a number of cities of New\r\nEngland. An admission fee of fifty cents was required at the door, and\r\nthe proceeds were devoted to leasing a vessel to take them home. Large\r\naudiences greeted them everywhere, and the impression they made was of\r\nthe highest order. Mr. Tappan would state the desire of the people to\r\nreturn to their native land, appeal to the philanthropic to aid them,\r\nand then call upon the people to read the Scriptures, sing songs in\r\ntheir own language, and then in the English. Cinquez would then\r\ndeliver an account of their capture, the horrors of the voyage, how he\r\nsucceeded in getting his manacles off, how he aided his brethren to\r\nloose their fetters, how he invited them to follow him in an attempt\r\nto gain their liberty, the attack, and their rescue, etc., etc. He was\r\na man of magnificent physique, commanding presence, graceful manners,\r\nand effective oratory. His speeches were delivered in Mendi, and\r\ntranslated into English by an interpreter.\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible,\" wrote Mr. Tappan from Boston, \"to describe\r\n     the novel and deeply interesting manner in which he acquitted\r\n     himself. The subject of his speech was similar to that of his\r\n     countrymen who had spoken in English; but he related more\r\n     minutely and graphically the occurrences on board the \"Amistad.\"\r\n     The easy manner of Cinquez, his natural, graceful, and energetic\r\n     action, the rapidity of his utterance, and the remarkable and\r\n     various expressions of his countenance, excited admiration and\r\n     applause. He was pronounced a powerful natural orator, and one\r\n     born to sway the minds of his fellow-men. Should he be converted\r\n     and become a preacher of the cross in Africa what delightful\r\n     results may be anticipated!\"\r\n\r\nA little fellow called Kali, only eleven years of age, pleased the\r\naudience everywhere he went by his ability not only to spell any word\r\nin the Gospels, but sentences, without blundering. For example, he\r\nwould spell out a sentence like the following sentence, naming each\r\nletter and syllable, and recapitulating as he went along, until he\r\npronounced the whole sentence: \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall\r\ninherit the earth.\"\r\n\r\nOf their doings in Philadelphia, Mr. Joseph Sturge wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"On this occasion, a very crowded and miscellaneous assembly\r\n     collected to see and hear the Mendians, although the admission\r\n     had been fixed as high as half a dollar, with the view of raising\r\n     a fund to carry them to their native country. Fifteen of them\r\n     were present, including one little boy and three girls. Cinque,\r\n     their chief, spoke with great fluency in his native language; and\r\n     his action and manner were very animated and graceful. Not much\r\n     of his speech was translated, yet he greatly interested his\r\n     audience. The little boy could speak our language with facility;\r\n     and each of them read, without hesitation, one or two verses in\r\n     the New Testament. It was impossible for any one to go away with\r\n     the impression, that in native intellect these people were\r\n     inferior to the whites. The information which I privately\r\n     received from their tutor, and others who had full opportunities\r\n     of appreciating their capacities and attainments, fully confirmed\r\n     my own very favorable impressions.\"\r\n\r\nBut all the while their sad hearts were turning toward their home and\r\nthe dear ones so far away. One of them eloquently declared: \"If Merica\r\nmen offer me as much gold as fill this cap full up, and give me\r\nhouses, land, and every ting, so dat I stay in this country, I say:\r\n'No! no! I want to see my father, my mother, my brother, my sister.'\"\r\nNothing could have been more tender and expressive. They were willing\r\nto endure any hardships short of life that they might once more see\r\ntheir own, their native land. The religious instruction they had\r\nenjoyed made a wonderful impression on their minds. One of them said:\r\n\"We owe every thing to God; he keeps us alive, and makes us free. When\r\nwe go to home to Mendi we tell our brethren about God, Jesus Christ,\r\nand heaven.\" Another one was asked: \"What is faith?\" and replied:\r\n\"Believing in Jesus Christ, and trusting in him.\" Reverting to the\r\nmurder of the captain and cook of the \"Amistad,\" one of the Africans\r\nsaid that if it were to be done over again he would pray for rather\r\nthan kill them. Cinquez, hearing this, smiled and shook his head. When\r\nasked if he would not pray for them, said: \"Yes, I would pray for 'em,\r\nan' kill 'em too.\"\r\n\r\nThese captives were returned to their native country in the fall of\r\n1841, accompanied by five missionaries. Their objective point was\r\nSierra Leone, from which place the British Government assisted them to\r\ntheir homes. Their stay in the United States did the anti-slavery\r\ncause great good. Here were poor, naked, savage pagans, unable to\r\nspeak English, in less than three years able to speak the English\r\nlanguage and appreciate the blessings of a Christian civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Sometimes written Cinque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 6.\r\n\r\n_THE PERIOD OF PREPARATION._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN SYMPATHY AND SOUTHERN SUBTERFUGES.\r\n\r\n1850-1860.\r\n\r\n     VIOLENT TREATMENT OF ANTI-SLAVERY ORATORS.--THE SOUTH\r\n     MISINTERPRETS THE MOBOCRATIC SPIRIT OF THE NORTH.--THE\r\n     \"GARRISONIANS\" AND \"CALHOUNITES\"--SLAVE POPULATION OF\r\n     1830-1850.--THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS.--MOTION FOR THE ADMISSION\r\n     OF NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA.--THE DEMOCRATIC AND WHIG PARTIES ON\r\n     THE TREATMENT OF THE SLAVE QUESTION.--CONVENTION OF THE\r\n     DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.--NOMINATION OF FRANKLIN\r\n     PIERCE FOR PRESIDENT.--WHIG PARTY CONVENTION.--NOMINATION OF GEN.\r\n     WINFIELD SCOTT FOR THE PRESIDENCY BY THE WHIGS.--MR.

The\r\npublic journals, as a rule, were unfriendly and intolerant. Even\r\nBoston could contemplate, with unruffled composure, a mob of her most\r\n\"reputable citizens\" dragging Mr. Garrison through the streets with a\r\nhalter about his neck. Public meetings were broken up by pro-slavery\r\nmobs; owners of public halls required a moneyed guarantee against the\r\ndestruction of their property, when such halls were used for\r\nanti-slavery meetings. Colored schools were broken up, the teachers\r\ndriven away, and the pupils maltreated.\r\n\r\nThe mobocratic demonstrations in the Northern States were the\r\nthermometer of public feeling upon the subject of slavery. The South\r\nwas, therefore, emboldened; for the political leaders in that section\r\nthought they saw a light from the distance that encouraged them to\r\nentertain the belief and indulge the hope that their present sectional\r\ninstitution could be made national. Southerners thought slavery would\r\ngrow in the cold climate of the North, excited into a lively existence\r\nby the warmth of a generous sympathy. But the South misinterpreted the\r\nreal motive that inspired opposition to anti-slavery agitation in the\r\nNorth. The violent opposition came from the mercantile class and\r\nforeign element who believed that the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion was a practical disturbance of their business affairs. The\r\nnext class, more moderate in opposition to agitation, believed slavery\r\nconstitutional, and, therefore, argued that anti-slavery orators were\r\ntraitors to the government. The third class, conservative, did not\r\ntake sides, because of the unpopularity of agitation on the one hand,\r\nand because of an harassing conscience on the other.\r\n\r\nThere were two classes of men who were seeking the dissolution of the\r\nUnion. The Garrisonians sought this end in the hope of forming another\r\nUnion _without_ slavery.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered by Wm. Lloyd Garrison, July 20, 1860, at the\r\nFramingham celebration, he declares:\r\n\r\n     \"Our object is the abolition of slavery _throughout the land_;\r\n     and whether in the prosecution of our object this party goes up\r\n     or the other party goes down, it is nothing to us. We cannot\r\n     alter our course one hair's breadth, nor accept a compromise of\r\n     our principles for the hearty adoption of our principles. I am\r\n     for _meddling with slavery everywhere_--_attacking it by night\r\n     and by day, in season and out of season_ (no, it can never be out\r\n     of season)--in order to _effect its overthrow_. (Loud applause.)\r\n     Higher yet will be my cry. Upward and onward! No union with\r\n     slave-holders! Down with this slave-holding government! Let this\r\n     'covenant with death and agreement with hell' be annulled! _Let\r\n     there be a free, independent, Northern republic_, and _the speedy\r\n     abolition of slavery_ will inevitably follow! (Loud applause.) So\r\n     I am laboring to dissolve this blood-stained Union as a work of\r\n     paramount importance.

Inspired by this hope and misguided by the apparent\r\nsympathy of the North, Southern statesmen began _preparations to\r\ndissolve the Union of the United States_.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of agitation and discussion, although the foreign\r\nslave-trade had been suppressed, the slave population increased at a\r\nwonderful ratio.\r\n\r\n  CENSUS OF 1830.--SLAVE POPULATION.\r\n\r\n  District of Columbia          6,119\r\n  Delaware                      3,292\r\n  Florida                      15,501\r\n  Georgia                     217,531\r\n  Illinois                        747\r\n  Kentucky                    165,213\r\n  Louisiana                   109,588\r\n  Maryland                    102,994\r\n  Alabama                     117,549\r\n  Mississippi                  65,659\r\n  Missouri                     25,091\r\n  New Jersey                    2,254\r\n  North Carolina              245,601\r\n  South Carolina              315,401\r\n  Tennessee                   141,603\r\n  Virginia                    469,757\r\n  Arkansas                      4,576\r\n                            ---------\r\n  Aggregate                 2,008,476\r\n\r\nNow, this was the year the agitation movement began.

Howell Cobb, of Georgia. President Zachary\r\nTaylor had called the attention of Congress to the admission of\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico into the Union, in his message to that body\r\nupon its assembling. On the 4th of January, 1850, Gen. Sam. Houston,\r\nUnited States Senator from Texas, submitted the following proposition\r\nto the Senate:\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States, possessing only a\r\n     delegated authority, has no power over the subject of negro\r\n     slavery within the limits of the United States, either to\r\n     prohibit or to interfere with it in the States, territories, or\r\n     districts, where, by municipal law, it now exists, or to\r\n     establish it in any State or territory where it does not exist;\r\n     but as an assurance and guarantee to promote harmony, quiet\r\n     apprehension, and remove sectional prejudice, which by\r\n     possibility might impair or weaken love and devotion to the Union\r\n     in any part of the country, it is hereby\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That, as the people in territories have the same\r\n     inherent rights of self-government as the people in the States,\r\n     if, in the exercise of such inherent rights, the people in the\r\n     newly acquired territories, by the annexation of Texas and the\r\n     acquisition of California and New Mexico, south of the parallel\r\n     of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes of north latitude,\r\n     extending to the Pacific Ocean, shall establish negro slavery in\r\n     the formation of their State governments, it shall be deemed no\r\n     objection to their admission as a State or States into the Union,\r\n     in accordance with the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January, Henry Clay, of Kentucky, submitted to the\r\nUnited States Senate the following propositions looking toward an\r\namicable adjustment of the entire slavery question:\r\n\r\n     \"1. _Resolved_, That California, with suitable boundaries, ought,\r\n     upon her application, to be admitted as one of the States of this\r\n     Union, without the imposition by Congress of any restriction in\r\n     respect to the exclusion or introduction of slavery within those\r\n     boundaries.\r\n\r\n     \"2. _Resolved_, That as slavery does not exist by law, and is not\r\n     likely to be introduced into any of the territory acquired by the\r\n     United States from the republic of Mexico, it is inexpedient for\r\n     Congress to provide by law either for its introduction into, or\r\n     exclusion from, any part of the said territory; and that\r\n     appropriate territorial governments ought to be established by\r\n     Congress in all the said territory not assigned as within the\r\n     boundaries of the proposed State of California, without the\r\n     adoption of any restriction or condition on the subject of\r\n     slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"3. _Resolved_, That the western boundary of the State of Texas\r\n     ought to be fixed on the Rio del Norte, commencing one marine\r\n     league from its mouth, and running up that river to the southern\r\n     line of New Mexico, thence with that line eastwardly, and so\r\n     continuing in the same direction to the line as established\r\n     between the United States and Spain, excluding any portion of New\r\n     Mexico, whether lying on the east or west of that river.\r\n\r\n     \"4. _Resolved_, That it be proposed to the State of Texas, that\r\n     the United States will provide for the payment of all that\r\n     portion of the legitimate and _bona-fide_ public debt of that\r\n     State contracted prior to its annexation to the United States,\r\n     and for which the duties on foreign imports were pledged by the\r\n     said State to its creditors, not exceeding the sum of----\r\n     dollars, in consideration of the said duties so pledged having\r\n     been no longer applicable to that object after the said\r\n     annexation, but having thenceforward become payable to the United\r\n     States; and upon the condition, also, that the said State of\r\n     Texas shall, by some solemn and authentic act of her Legislature,\r\n     or of a convention, relinquish to the United States any claim\r\n     which she has to any part of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n     \"5. _Resolved_, That it is inexpedient to abolish slavery in the\r\n     District of Columbia whilst that institution continues to exist\r\n     in the State of Maryland, without the consent of that State,\r\n     without the consent of the people of the District, and without\r\n     just compensation to the owners of slaves within the District.\r\n\r\n     \"6. _But Resolved_, That it is expedient to prohibit within the\r\n     District, the slave-trade in slaves brought into it from States\r\n     or places beyond the limits of the District, either to be sold\r\n     therein as merchandise, or to be transported to other markets\r\n     without the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     \"7. _Resolved_, That more effectual provision ought to be made by\r\n     law, according to the requirement of the Constitution, for the\r\n     restitution and delivery of persons bound to service or labor in\r\n     any State, who may escape into any other State or territory in\r\n     the Union. And\r\n\r\n     \"8. _Resolved_, That Congress has no power to prohibit or\r\n     obstruct the trade in slaves between the slave-holding States,\r\n     but that the admission or exclusion of slaves brought from one\r\n     into another of them, depends exclusively upon their own\r\n     particular laws.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Bell, of Tennessee, offered a series of resolutions on the\r\nsame question on the 28th of February, containing nine resolves. As\r\nusual, on all propositions respecting slavery, the debate was\r\nprotracted, earnest, and able. The Clay resolutions attracted most\r\nattention. Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, said:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, we are called upon to receive this as a measure of\r\n     compromise! As a measure in which we of the minority are to\r\n     receive nothing. A measure of compromise! I look upon it as but a\r\n     modest mode of taking that, the claim to which has been more\r\n     boldly asserted by others; and, that I may be understood upon\r\n     this question, and that my position may go forth to the country\r\n     in the same columns that convey the sentiments of the Senator\r\n     from Kentucky, I here assert, that never will I take less than\r\n     the Missouri compromise line extended to the Pacific Ocean, with\r\n     the specific recognition of the right to hold slaves in the\r\n     territory below that line; and that, before such territories are\r\n     admitted into the Union as States, slaves may be taken there from\r\n     any of the United States at the option of the owners. I can never\r\n     consent to give additional power to a majority to commit further\r\n     aggressions upon the minority in this Union, and will never\r\n     consent to any proposition which will have such a tendency,\r\n     without a full guaranty or counteracting measure is connected\r\n     with it.\"\r\n\r\nA number of very able speeches were made on the resolutions of Mr.\r\nClay, but the most characteristic one--the one most thoroughly\r\nrepresenting the sentiment of the South--was made by John C. Calhoun.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n     \"The Union was in danger. The cause of this danger was the\r\n     discontent at the South. And what was the cause of this\r\n     discontent? It was found in the belief which prevailed among them\r\n     that they could not, consistently with honor and safety, remain\r\n     in the Union. And what had caused this belief? One of the causes\r\n     was the long-continued agitation of the slave question at the\r\n     North, and the many aggressions they had made on the rights of\r\n     the South. But the primary cause was in the fact, that the\r\n     equilibrium between the two sections at the time of the adoption\r\n     of the Constitution had been destroyed. The first of the series\r\n     of acts by which this had been done, was the ordinance of 1787,\r\n     by which the South had been excluded from all the northwestern\r\n     region. The next was the Missouri compromise, excluding them from\r\n     all the Louisiana territory north of thirty-six degrees thirty\r\n     minutes, except the State of Missouri,--in all 1,238,025 square\r\n     miles, leaving to the South the southern portion of the original\r\n     Louisiana territory, with Florida, to which had since been added\r\n     the territory acquired with Texas,--making in all but 609,023\r\n     miles. And now the North was endeavoring to appropriate to\r\n     herself the territory recently acquired from Mexico, adding\r\n     526,078 miles to the territory from which the South was, if\r\n     possible, to be excluded. Another cause of the destruction of\r\n     this equilibrium was our system of revenue (the tariff), the\r\n     duties falling mainly upon the Southern portion of the Union, as\r\n     being the greatest exporting States, while more than a due\r\n     proportion of the revenue had been disbursed at the North.\r\n\r\n     \"But while these measures were destroying the equilibrium between\r\n     the two sections, the action of the government was leading to a\r\n     radical change in its character. It was maintained that the\r\n     government itself had the right to decide, in the last resort,\r\n     as to the extent of its powers, and to resort to force to\r\n     maintain the power it claimed. The doctrines of General Jackson's\r\n     proclamation, subsequently asserted and maintained by Mr.\r\n     Madison, the leading framer and expounder of the Constitution,\r\n     were the doctrines which, if carried out, would change the\r\n     character of the government from a federal republic, as it came\r\n     from the hands of its framers, into a great national consolidated\r\n     democracy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun also spoke of the anti-slavery agitation, which, if not\r\narrested, would destroy the Union; and he passed a censure upon\r\nCongress for receiving abolition petitions. Had Congress in the\r\nbeginning adopted the course which he had advocated, which was to\r\nrefuse to take jurisdiction, by the united voice of all parties, the\r\nagitation would have been prevented. He charged the North with false\r\nprofessions of devotion to the Union, and with having violated the\r\nConstitution. Acts had been passed in Northern States to set aside and\r\nannul the clause of the slavery question, with the avowed purpose of\r\nabolishing slavery in the States, which was another violation of the\r\nConstitution. And during the fifteen years of this agitation, in not a\r\nsingle instance had the people of the North denounced these agitators.\r\nHow then could their professions of devotion to the Union be sincere?\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun disapproved both the plan of Mr. Clay and that of\r\nPresident Taylor, as incapable of saving the Union. He would pass by\r\nthe former without remark, as Mr. Clay had been replied to by several\r\nSenators. The Executive plan could not save the Union, because it\r\ncould not satisfy the South that it could safely or honorably remain\r\nin the Union. It was a modification of the Wilmot proviso, proposing\r\nto effect the same object, the exclusion of the South from the new\r\nterritory. The Executive proviso was more objectionable than the\r\nWilmot. Both inflicted a dangerous wound upon the Constitution, by\r\ndepriving the Southern States of equal rights as joint partners in\r\nthese territories; but the former inflicted others equally great. It\r\nclaimed for the inhabitants the right to legislate for the\r\nterritories, which belonged to Congress. The assumption of this right\r\nwas utterly unfounded, unconstitutional, and without example. Under\r\nthis assumed right, the people of California had formed a constitution\r\nand a State government, and appointed Senators and Representatives. If\r\nthe people as adventurers had conquered the territory and established\r\ntheir independence, the sovereignty of the country would have been\r\nvested in them. In that case they would have had the right to form a\r\nState government, and afterward they might have applied to Congress\r\nfor admission into the Union. But the United States had conquered and\r\nacquired California; therefore, to them belonged the sovereignty and\r\nthe powers of government over the territory. Michigan was the first\r\ncase of departure from the uniform rule of acting. Hers, however, was\r\na slight departure from established usage. The ordinance of 1787\r\nsecured to her the right of becoming a State when she should have\r\n60,000 inhabitants. Congress delayed taking the census. The people\r\nbecame impatient; and after her population had increased to twice that\r\nnumber, they formed a constitution without waiting for the taking of\r\nthe census; and Congress waived the omission, as there was no doubt of\r\nthe requisite number of inhabitants. In other cases there had existed\r\nterritorial governments.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how the Union could not be saved, he then proceeded to\r\nanswer the question how it could be saved. There was but one way\r\ncertain. Justice must be done to the South, by a full and final\r\nsettlement of all the questions at issue. The North must concede to\r\nthe South an equal right to the acquired territory, and fulfil the\r\nstipulations respecting fugitive slaves; must cease to agitate the\r\nslave question, and join in an amendment of the Constitution,\r\nrestoring to the South the power she possessed of protecting herself,\r\nbefore the equilibrium between the two sections had been destroyed by\r\nthe action of the government.\r\n\r\nHere was a clear statement of the position and feelings of the South\r\nrespecting slavery. The ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri compromise\r\nof 1820 \"were destroying the equilibrium between the _two sections_!\"\r\nAnd the anti-slavery agitation, \"if not arrested, would destroy the\r\nUnion!\" The sophistry of Calhoun sought a reasonable excuse for the\r\nSouth to dissolve the Union. In a speech of his, written during a\r\nspell of sickness, and read by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, he referred to\r\nWashington as \"the illustrious Southerner.\" When it was read in the\r\nSenate Mr. Cass said:\r\n\r\n     \"Our Washington--the Washington of our whole country--receives in\r\n     this Senate the epithet of 'Southerner,' as if that great man,\r\n     whose distinguished characteristic was his attachment to his\r\n     country, and his whole country, who was so well known, and who,\r\n     more than any one, deprecated all sectional feeling and all\r\n     sectional action, loved Georgia better than he loved New\r\n     Hampshire, because he happened to be born on the southern bank of\r\n     the Potomac. I repeat, sir, that I heard with great pain that\r\n     expression from the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no ground for reasonable complaint on the part of\r\nthe South. From the convention that framed the Federal Constitution,\r\nthrough all Congressional struggle, and in national politics as well,\r\nthe South had secured nearly all measures asked for. And the\r\ndiscussion in Congress at this time was intended to divert attention\r\nfrom the real object of the South. Another fugitive-slave law was\r\ndemanded by the South, and the Northern members voted them the right\r\nto hunt slaves upon free soil. The law passed, and was approved on the\r\n18th of September, 1850.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to choose between the Democratic and Whig parties by\r\nreading the planks in their platforms referring to the subject of\r\nslavery. On the 1st of June, 1852, the Democratic Convention, at\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, nominated Franklin Pierce, of New Hampshire, for\r\nthe Presidency, on the forty-ninth ballot. This plank defined the\r\nposition of that party on the question of slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"That Congress has no power under the Constitution to interfere\r\n     with or control the domestic institutions of the several States,\r\n     and that such States are the sole and proper judges of every\r\n     thing appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the\r\n     Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists, or others,\r\n     made to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery,\r\n     or to take incipient steps in relation thereto, are calculated to\r\n     lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and that\r\n     all such efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the\r\n     happiness of the people, and endanger the stability and\r\n     permanency of the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any\r\n     friend of our political institutions.\r\n\r\n     \"That the foregoing proposition covers, and was intended to\r\n     embrace, the whole subject of slavery agitation in Congress; and\r\n     therefore the Democratic party of the Union, standing on this\r\n     national platform, will abide by and adhere to a faithful\r\n     execution of the acts known as the compromise measures settled by\r\n     the last Congress--the act for reclaiming fugitives from service\r\n     or labor included; which act being designed to carry out an\r\n     express provision of the Constitution, can not with fidelity\r\n     thereto be repealed, nor so changed as to destroy or impair its\r\n     efficiency.\r\n\r\n     \"That the Democratic party will resist all attempts at renewing,\r\n     in Congress or out of it, the agitation of the slavery question,\r\n     under whatever shape or color the attempt may be made.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig party, at the same city, in convention assembled, on the 16th\r\nof June, 1852, nominated Gen. Winfield Scott, for the Presidency, on\r\nthe fifty-third ballot. The Whig party declared its position on the\r\nslavery question as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"That the series of acts of the Thirty-first Congress--the act\r\n     known as the fugitive-slave law included--are received and\r\n     acquiesced in by the Whig party of the United States, as a\r\n     settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and\r\n     exciting question which they embrace; and so far as they are\r\n     concerned, we will maintain them and insist on their strict\r\n     enforcement, until time and experience shall demonstrate the\r\n     necessity of further legislation, to guard against the evasion of\r\n     the laws on the one hand, and the abuse of their powers on the\r\n     other, not impairing their present efficiency; and we deprecate\r\n     all agitation of the question thus settled, as dangerous to our\r\n     peace; and will discountenance all efforts to continue or renew\r\n     such agitation whenever, wherever, or however the attempt may be\r\n     made; and we will maintain this system as essential to the\r\n     nationality of the Whig party of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe political contest ended in the autumn in favor of Mr. Pierce. The\r\npublic journals in many parts of the country thought the end of the\r\n\"slavery question\" had come, and that as the Whigs were determined to\r\n\"discountenance all efforts to continue or renew\" the agitation of the\r\nsubject, there was no fear of sectional strife.\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural address, March 4, 1853, President Pierce said:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that involuntary servitude is recognized by the\r\n     Constitution. I believe that the States where it exists are\r\n     entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the constitutional\r\n     provisions. I hold that the compromise measures of 1850 are\r\n     strictly constitutional, and to be unhesitatingly carried into\r\n     effect. And now, I fervently hope that the question is at rest,\"\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, upon the assembling of Congress, the\r\nPresident, in his message to that body, again referred to slavery as\r\n\"a subject which had been set at rest by the deliberate judgment of\r\nthe people.\" But on the 15th of December, nine days after the message\r\nof the President had been received by Congress, Mr. Dodge, of Iowa,\r\nsubmitted to the Senate a bill to organize the territory of Nebraska,\r\nwhich was referred to the Committee on Territories. After some\r\ndiscussion in the committee, it was finally reported back to the\r\nSenate by Mr. Douglass, of Illinois, with amendments. The report was\r\nelaborate, and raised considerable doubt as to whether the amendments\r\ndid not repeal the Missouri compromise. A special report was made on\r\nthe 4th of January, 1854, so amending the bill as to remove all doubt;\r\nand, contemplating the opening of all the vast territory secured\r\nforever to freedom, startled the nation from the \"repose\" it had\r\napparently taken from agitation on the slavery question, and opened an\r\ninterminable controversy.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, Mr. Dixon, of Kentucky, gave notice that he\r\nwould introduce a bill clearly repealing the Missouri compromise. The\r\nfirst champion of the repeal of the compromise of 1820 was a Northern\r\nSenator, Stephen A. Douglass, of Illinois. He hung a massive\r\nargument--excelling rather in quantity than in quality--upon the\r\nfollowing propositions:\r\n\r\n     \"From these provisions, it is apparent that the compromise\r\n     measures of 1850 affirm, and rest upon, the following\r\n     propositions:\r\n\r\n     \"_First._--That all questions pertaining to slavery in the\r\n     territories, and the new States to be formed therefrom, are to be\r\n     left to the decision of the people residing therein, by their\r\n     appropriate representatives, to be chosen by them for that\r\n     purpose.\r\n\r\n     \"_Second._--That 'all cases involving title to slaves,' and\r\n     'questions of personal freedom,' are to be referred to the\r\n     adjudication of the local tribunals, with the right of appeal to\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"_Third._--That the provision of the Constitution of the United\r\n     States in respect to fugitives from service, is to be carried\r\n     into faithful execution in all 'the original territories,' the\r\n     same as in the States.\r\n\r\n     \"The substitute for the bill which your committee have prepared,\r\n     and which is commended to the favorable action of the Senate,\r\n     proposes to carry these propositions and principles into\r\n     practical operation, in the precise language of the compromise\r\n     measures of 1850.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass said:\r\n\r\n     \"The legal effect of this bill, if passed, was neither to\r\n     legislate slavery into nor out of these territories, but to leave\r\n     the people to do as they pleased. And why should any man, North\r\n     or South, object to this principle? It was by the operation of\r\n     this principle, and not by any dictation from the Federal\r\n     government, that slavery had been abolished in half of the twelve\r\n     States in which it existed at the time of the adoption of the\r\n     Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of February, Mr. Chase, of Ohio, moved to amend by striking\r\nout the words, \"was superseded by the principles of the legislation of\r\n1850, commonly called the compromise measures, and,\" so that the\r\nclause would read: \"That the Constitution, and all laws of the United\r\nStates which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force\r\nand effect within the said territory of Nebraska as elsewhere within\r\nthe United States, except the eighth section of the act preparatory to\r\nthe admission of Missouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820,\r\nwhich is hereby declared inoperative.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chase then proceeded to reply to Mr. Douglass. He called attention\r\nto that part of the President's message which referred to the \"repose\"\r\nof the subject of slavery, and then said:\r\n\r\n     \"The agreement of the two old political parties, thus referred to\r\n     by the Chief Magistrate of the country, was complete, and a large\r\n     majority of the American people seemed to acquiesce in the\r\n     legislation of which he spoke. A few of us, indeed, doubted the\r\n     accuracy of these statements, and the permanency of this repose.\r\n     We never believed that the acts of 1850 would prove to be a\r\n     permanent adjustment of the slavery question. But, sir, we only\r\n     represented a small, though vigorous and growing party in the\r\n     country. Our number was small in Congress. By some we were\r\n     regarded as visionaries, by some as factionists; while almost all\r\n     agreed in pronouncing us mistaken. And so, sir, the country was\r\n     at peace. As the eye swept the entire circumference of the\r\n     horizon and upward to mid-heaven, not a cloud appeared; to common\r\n     observation there was no mist or stain upon the clearness of the\r\n     sky. But suddenly all is changed; rattling thunder breaks from\r\n     the cloudless firmament. The storm bursts forth in fury. And now\r\n     we find ourselves in the midst of an agitation, the end and issue\r\n     of which no man can foresee.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, sir, who is responsible for this renewal of strife and\r\n     controversy? Not we, for we have introduced no question of\r\n     territorial slavery into Congress; not we, who are denounced as\r\n     agitators and factionists. No, sir; the quietists and the\r\n     finalists have become agitators; they who told us that all\r\n     agitation was quieted, and that the resolutions of the political\r\n     conventions put a final period to the discussion of slavery. This\r\n     will not escape the observation of the country. It is _slavery_\r\n     that renews the strife. It is slavery that again wants room. It\r\n     is slavery with its insatiate demand for more slave territory and\r\n     more slave States. And what does slavery ask for now? Why, sir,\r\n     it demands that a time-honored and sacred compact shall be\r\n     rescinded--a compact which has endured through a whole\r\n     generation--a compact which has been universally regarded as\r\n     inviolable, North and South--a compact, the constitutionality of\r\n     which few have doubted, and by which all have consented to\r\n     abide.\"\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the able and eloquent speech of Mr. Chase, his\r\namendment only received thirteen votes. The debate went on until the\r\n3d of March, when the bill was placed upon its passage, and even then\r\nthe discussion went on. When the vote was finally taken, the bill\r\npassed by a vote of 37 yeas to 14 nays. The bill went to the House,\r\nwhere it was made a substitute to a bill already introduced, and\r\npassed by a vote of 113 yeas to 100 nays as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Representatives from free States in favor of the bill,     44.\r\n     \"Representatives from slave States in favor of the bill,    69.\r\n                                                                ----\r\n                                                                113.\r\n\r\n     \"Representatives from free States against the bill,         91.\r\n     \"Representatives from slave States against the bill,         9.\r\n                                                                ----\r\n                                                                100.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus, approved by the President, the measure became a law under\r\nthe title of \"_An Act to Organize the Territories of Kansas and\r\nNebraska_.\"\r\n\r\nCongress had violated the sublimest principles of law, had broken\r\nfaith with the people; had opened a wide door to slavery; had blotted\r\nfrom the map of the United States the last asylum where the oppressed\r\nmight seek protection; had put the country in a way to be reddened\r\nwith a fratricidal war, and made our flag a flaunting lie in the eyes\r\nof the civilized world. There was nothing to be done now but to let\r\nthe leaven of sectional malice work, that had been hurled into the\r\nslavery discussions in Congress. The bloodless war of words was now\r\ntransferred to the territory of Kansas, where a conflict of political\r\nparties, election frauds, and assassination did their hateful work.\r\n\r\nThe South began to put her State militia upon a war footing, and to\r\nmake every preparation for battle. The Administration of President\r\nBuchanan was in the interest of the South from beginning to end. He\r\nrefused to give Gov. John W. Geary, of Kansas, the military support\r\nthe \"_border ruffians_\" made necessary; allowed the public debt to\r\nincrease, our precious coin to go abroad, our treasury to become\r\ndepleted, our navy to go to the distant ports of China and Japan, our\r\narmy to our extremest frontiers, the music of our industries to cease;\r\nand the faith of a loyal people in the perpetuity of the republic was\r\nallowed to faint amid the din of mobs and the threats of secession.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] There were nearly 500 slaves held in Northern States not placed\r\nin this census.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE \"BLACK LAWS\" OF \"BORDER STATES.\"\r\n\r\n     STRINGENT LAWS ENACTED AGAINST FREE NEGROES AND\r\n     MULATTOES.--FUGITIVE-SLAVE LAW RESPECTED IN OHIO.--A LAW TO\r\n     PREVENT KIDNAPPING.--THE FIRST CONSTITUTION OF OHIO.--HISTORY OF\r\n     THE DRED SCOTT CASE.--JUDGE TANEY'S OPINION IN THIS CASE.--OHIO\r\n     CONSTITUTION OF 1851 DENIED FREE NEGROES THE RIGHT TO VOTE.--THE\r\n     ESTABLISHMENT OF COLORED SCHOOLS.--LAW IN INDIANA TERRITORY IN\r\n     REFERENCE TO EXECUTIONS.--AN ACT FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGROES\r\n     AND MULATTOES INTO THE TERRITORY.--FIRST CONSTITUTION OF\r\n     INDIANA.--THE ILLINOIS CONSTITUTION OF 1818.--CRIMINAL CODE\r\n     ENACTED.--ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE PASSES AN ACT TO PREVENT THE\r\n     EMIGRATION OF FREE NEGROES INTO THE STATE.--FREE NEGROES OF THE\r\n     NORTHERN STATES ENDURE RESTRICTION AND PROSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough slavery was excluded from all the new States northwest of the\r\nOhio River, the free Negro was but little better off in Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Illinois than in any of the Southern States. From the earliest\r\nmoment of the organic existence of the border free States, severe laws\r\nwere enacted against free Negroes and Mulattoes. At the second session\r\nof the first Legislature of the State of Ohio, \"_An Act to Regulate\r\nBlack and Mulatto Persons_\"[37] was passed.\r\n\r\n     Sec. 1. That no black or mulatto person shall be permitted to\r\n     settle or reside in this State \"without a certificate of his or\r\n     her actual freedom.\"\r\n\r\n     2. Resident blacks and mulattoes to have their names recorded,\r\n     etc. (Amended in 1834, Jan. 5 1, Curwen, 126.) _Proviso_, \"That\r\n     nothing in this act contained shall bar the lawful claim to any\r\n     black or mulatto person.\"\r\n\r\n     3. Residents prohibited from hiring black or mulatto persons not\r\n     having a certificate.\r\n\r\n     4. Forbids, under penalty, to \"harbor or secrete any black or\r\n     mulatto person the property of any person whatever,\" or to\r\n     \"hinder or prevent the lawful owner or owners from re-taking,\"\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     5. Black or mulatto persons coming to reside in the State with a\r\n     legal certificate, to record the same.\r\n\r\n     6. \"That in case any person or persons, his or their agent or\r\n     agents, claiming any black or mulatto person or persons that now\r\n     are or hereafter may be in this State, may apply, upon making\r\n     satisfactory proof that such black or mulatto person or persons\r\n     are the property of him or her who applies, to any associate\r\n     judge or justice of the peace within the State, the associate\r\n     judge or justice is hereby empowered and required, by his\r\n     precept, to direct the sheriff or constable to arrest such black\r\n     or mulatto person or persons, and deliver the same, in the county\r\n     or township where such officers shall reside, to the claimant or\r\n     claimants, or his or their agent or agents, for which service the\r\n     sheriff or constable shall receive such compensation as he is\r\n     entitled to receive in other cases for similar services.\"\r\n\r\n     7. \"That any person or persons who shall attempt to remove or\r\n     shall remove from this State, or who shall aid and assist in\r\n     removing, contrary to the provisions of this act, any black or\r\n     mulatto person or persons, without first proving, as herein\r\n     before directed, that he, she, or they is or are legally entitled\r\n     so to do, shall, on conviction thereof before any court having\r\n     cognizance of the same, forfeit and pay the sum of one thousand\r\n     dollars, one half to the use of the informer and the other half\r\n     to the use of the State, to be recovered by the action of debt\r\n     _quitam_ or indictment, and shall moreover be liable to the\r\n     action of the party injured.\"\r\n\r\nSo here upon free soil, under a State government that did not\r\nrecognize slavery in its constitution, the Negro was compelled to\r\nproduce a certificate of freedom. Thus the fugitive-slave law was\r\nrecognized, but at the same time an unlawful removal of free Negroes\r\nfrom the State was forbidden.\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1806-7, \"_An Act to Amend the Act Entitled 'an Act\r\nRegulating Black and Mulatto Persons_,'\" was passed amending the old\r\nlaw. The first act simply required \"a certificate of freedom\"; the\r\namended law required Negroes and Mulattoes intending to settle in Ohio\r\nto give a bond not to become a charge upon the county in which they\r\nsettled. Section four reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"4. That no black or mulatto person or persons shall hereafter be\r\n     permitted to be sworn or give evidence in any court of record or\r\n     elsewhere in this State, in any cause depending or matter of\r\n     controversy where either party to the sale is a white person, or\r\n     in any prosecution which shall be instituted in behalf of this\r\n     State, against any white person.\"[38]\r\n\r\nBut this law did not apply to persons a shade nearer white than\r\nMulatto [the seven-eighths law].[39] Their testimony was admissible,\r\nwhile that of Negroes and Mulattoes was not admitted against them. In\r\nJordan _vs._ Smith [1846], 14, Ohio, p. 199: \"A black person sued by a\r\nwhite, may make affidavit to a plea so as to put the plaintiff to\r\nproof.\"\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the fact that the fugitive-slave law was\r\nrespected in Ohio. In 1818-19, a law was passed to prevent the\r\nunlawful kidnapping of free Negroes, which, in its preamble, recites\r\nthe provisions of the law of Congress, passed February 12, 1793,\r\nrespecting fugitives from service and labor.[40] And in 1839 the\r\nLegislature passed another act relating to \"fugitives from labor,\"\r\netc., paving the way by the following recital:\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, The second section of the fourth article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States declares that 'no person'\r\n     [etc., reciting it]; and whereas the laws now in force within the\r\n     State of Ohio are wholly inadequate to the protection pledged by\r\n     this provision of the Constitution to the Southern States of this\r\n     Union; and whereas it is the duty of those who reap the largest\r\n     measure of benefits conferred by the Constitution to recognize to\r\n     their full extent the obligations which that instrument imposes;\r\n     and whereas it is the deliberate conviction of this General\r\n     Assembly that the Constitution can only be sustained as it was\r\n     framed by a spirit of just compromise; therefore.\"\r\n\r\n     Sec. 1. Authorizes judges of courts of record, \"or any justice of\r\n     the peace, or the mayor of any city or town corporate,\" on\r\n     application, etc., of claimant, to bring the fugitive before a\r\n     judge within the county where the warrant was issued, or before\r\n     some State judge with certain cautions as to proving the official\r\n     character of the officer issuing the warrant; gives the form of\r\n     warrant, directing the fugitive to be brought before, etc., \"to\r\n     be be dealt with as the law directs.\"[41]\r\n\r\nJ. Peck, Esq. [9, Ohio, p. 212], refers to the laws of 1818-19, and\r\n1830-31, as a recognition by the State of Ohio of the power of\r\nCongress to pass the act of 1793, though that the act was not\r\nspecially mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe first constitution of Ohio [1802] restricted the right of suffrage\r\nto \"all white male inhabitants.\" \"In all elections, all white male\r\ninhabitants above the age of twenty-one years, having resided in the\r\nState one year next preceding the election, and who have paid or are\r\ncharged with a State or county tax, shall enjoy the right of an\r\nelector,\" etc.[42] This was repeated in the Bill of Rights adopted in\r\n1851.[43]\r\n\r\nArticle iv., Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States says:\r\n\"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\" The question as to\r\nwhether free Negroes were included in the above was discussed at great\r\nlength in the Dred Scott case, where Chief-Justice Taney took the\r\nground that a Negro was not a citizen under the fourth article of the\r\nConstitution. But the fourth article of the Articles of Confederation\r\n[1778] recognized free Negroes as citizens. It is given here:\r\n\r\n     \"ART. 4.--The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship\r\n     and intercourse among the people of the different States in this\r\n     Union, the free inhabitants of each of these States--paupers,\r\n     vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted--shall be entitled\r\n     to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several\r\n     States; and the people of each State shall have free ingress and\r\n     regress to and from any other State, and shall enjoy therein all\r\n     the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties,\r\n     impositions, and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof,\r\n     respectively; provided that such restrictions shall not extend so\r\n     far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any\r\n     State, from any other State, of which the owner is an inhabitant;\r\n     provided, also, that no imposition, duty, or restriction shall be\r\n     laid by any State on the property of the United States, or either\r\n     of them.\"[44]\r\n\r\nBy this it is evident that \"paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from\r\njustice\" were the only persons excluded from the right of citizenship.\r\nThe following is the history of the Dred Scott case:\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1834, the plaintiff was a negro slave belonging to\r\n     Dr. Emerson, who was a surgeon in the army of the United States.\r\n     In that year, 1834, said Dr. Emerson took the plaintiff from the\r\n     State of Missouri to the military post at Rock Island, in the\r\n     State of Illinois, and held him there as a slave until the month\r\n     of April or May, 1836. At the time last mentioned, said Dr.\r\n     Emerson removed the plaintiff from said military post at Rock\r\n     Island to the military post at Fort Snelling, situate on the west\r\n     bank of the Mississippi River, in the territory known as Upper\r\n     Louisiana, acquired by the United States of France, and situate\r\n     north of the latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north,\r\n     and north of the State of Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the\r\n     plaintiff in slavery at said Fort Snelling, from said\r\n     last-mentioned date until the year 1838.\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count of\r\n     the plaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major\r\n     Taliaferro, who belonged to the army of the United States. In\r\n     that year, 1835, said Major Taliaferro took said Harriet to said\r\n     Fort Snelling, a military post, situated as herein before stated,\r\n     and kept her there as a slave until the year 1836, and then sold\r\n     and delivered her as a slave at said Fort Snelling unto the said\r\n     Dr. Emerson herein before named. Said Dr. Emerson held said\r\n     Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling until the year 1838.\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1836, the plaintiff and said Harriet at said Fort\r\n     Snelling, with the consent of said Dr. Emerson, who then claimed\r\n     to be their master and owner, intermarried, and took each other\r\n     for husband and wife. Eliza and Lizzie, named in the third count\r\n     of the plaintiff's declaration, are the fruit of that marriage.\r\n     Eliza is about fourteen years old, and was born on board the\r\n     steamboat 'Gipsey,' north of the north line of the State of\r\n     Missouri, and upon the river Mississippi. Lizzie is about seven\r\n     years old, and was born in the State of Missouri, at the military\r\n     post called Jefferson Barracks.\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and\r\n     said Harriet and their said daughter Eliza from said Fort\r\n     Snelling to the State of Missouri, where they have ever since\r\n     resided.\r\n\r\n     \"Before the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold and\r\n     conveyed the plaintiff, said Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie to the\r\n     defendant, as slaves, and the defendant has ever since claimed to\r\n     hold them and each of them as slaves.\r\n\r\n     \"At the time mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration, the\r\n     defendant, claiming to be owner as aforesaid, laid his hands upon\r\n     said plaintiff, Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, and imprisoned them,\r\n     doing in this respect, however, no more than what he might\r\n     lawfully do if they were of right his slaves at such times.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that Dred Scott brought suit for his freedom in the\r\n     Circuit Court of St. Louis County; that there was a verdict and\r\n     judgment in his favor; that on a writ of error to the Supreme\r\n     Court the judgment below was reversed, and the same remanded to\r\n     the Circuit Court, where it has been continued to await the\r\n     decision of this case.\r\n\r\n     \"In May, 1854, the cause went before a jury, who found the\r\n     following verdict, viz.: 'As to the first issue joined in this\r\n     case, we of the jury find the defendant not guilty; and as to the\r\n     issue secondly above joined, we of the jury find that before and\r\n     at the time when, etc., in the first count mentioned, the said\r\n     Dred Scott was a negro slave, the lawful property of the\r\n     defendant; and as to the issue thirdly above joined, we, the\r\n     jury, find that before and at the time when, etc., in the second\r\n     and third counts mentioned, the said Harriet, wife of said Dred\r\n     Scott, and Eliza and Lizzie, the daughters of the said Dred\r\n     Scott, were negro slaves, the lawful property of the defendant.'\r\n\r\n     \"Whereupon, the court gave judgment for the defendant.\r\n\r\n     \"After an ineffectual motion for a new trial, the plaintiff filed\r\n     the following bill of exceptions.\r\n\r\n     \"On the trial of this cause by the jury, the plaintiff, to\r\n     maintain the issues on his part, read to the jury the following\r\n     agreed statement of facts (see agreement above). No further\r\n     testimony was given to the jury by either party. Thereupon the\r\n     plaintiff moved the court to give to the jury the following\r\n     instructions, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"'That, upon the facts agreed to by the parties, they ought to\r\n     find for the plaintiff.' The court refused to give such\r\n     instruction to the jury, and the plaintiff, to such refusal, then\r\n     and there duly excepted.\r\n\r\n     The court then gave the following instruction to the jury, on\r\n     motion of the defendant:\r\n\r\n     \"'The jury are instructed, that upon the facts in this case, the\r\n     law is with the defendant.' The plaintiff excepted to this\r\n     instruction.\r\n\r\n     \"Upon these exceptions, the case came up to the Supreme Court,\r\n     December term, 1856.\"[45]\r\n\r\nJudge Taney gave the following opinion:\r\n\r\n     \"The question is simply this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were\r\n     imported into this country and sold as slaves, become a member of\r\n     the political community formed and brought into existence by the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to\r\n     all the rights and privileges and immunities guaranteed by that\r\n     instrument to the citizen? One of which rights is the privilege\r\n     of suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified\r\n     in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be observed that the plea applies to that class of\r\n     persons only whose ancestors were negroes of the African race,\r\n     and imported into this country, and sold and held as slaves. The\r\n     only matter in issue before the court, therefore, is, whether the\r\n     descendants of such slaves, when they shall be emancipated, or\r\n     who are born of parents who had become free before their birth,\r\n     are citizens of a State, in the sense in which the word citizen\r\n     is used in the Constitution of the United States. And this being\r\n     the only matter in dispute on the pleadings, the court must be\r\n     understood as speaking in this opinion of that class only, that\r\n     is, of those persons who are the descendants of Africans who were\r\n     imported into this country and sold as slaves.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"We proceed to examine the case as presented by the pleadings.\r\n\r\n     \"The words 'people of the United States' and 'citizens' are\r\n     synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the\r\n     political body who, according to our republican institutions,\r\n     form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the\r\n     government through their representatives. They are what we\r\n     familiarly call the 'sovereign people, and every citizen is one\r\n     of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. The\r\n     question before us is, whether the class of persons described in\r\n     the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people, and are\r\n     constituent members of this sovereignty. We think they are not,\r\n     and that they are not included, and were not intended to be\r\n     included, under the word 'citizen' in the Constitution, and can\r\n     therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that\r\n     instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United\r\n     States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a\r\n     subordinate [405] and inferior class of beings, who had been\r\n     subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not,\r\n     yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or\r\n     privileges but such as those who held the power and the\r\n     government might choose to grant them.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice\r\n     or injustice, the policy or impolicy, of these laws....\r\n\r\n     \"In discussing this question, we must not confound the rights of\r\n     citizenship which a State may confer within its own limits, and\r\n     the rights of citizenship as a member of the Union. It does not\r\n     by any means follow, because he has all the rights and privileges\r\n     of a citizen of a State, that he must be a citizen of the United\r\n     States. He may have all of the rights and privileges of the\r\n     citizen of a State, and yet not be entitled to the rights and\r\n     privileges of a citizen of any other State. For, previous to the\r\n     adoption of the Constitution of the United States, every State\r\n     had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever it pleased the\r\n     character of citizen, and to endow him with all its rights. But\r\n     this character of course was confined to the boundaries of the\r\n     State, and gave him no rights or privileges in other States\r\n     beyond those secured to him by the laws of nations and the comity\r\n     of States. Nor have the several States surrendered the power of\r\n     conferring these rights and privileges by adopting the\r\n     Constitution of the United States. Each State may still confer\r\n     them upon an alien, or any one it thinks proper, or upon any\r\n     class or description of persons; yet he would not be a citizen in\r\n     the sense in which that word is used in the Constitution of the\r\n     United States, nor entitled to sue as such in one of its courts,\r\n     nor to the privileges and immunities of a citizen in the other\r\n     States. The rights which he would acquire would be restricted to\r\n     the State which gave them. The Constitution has conferred on\r\n     Congress the right to establish an uniform rule of\r\n     naturalization, and this right is evidently exclusive, and has\r\n     always been held by this court to be so. Consequently no State,\r\n     since the adoption of the Constitution, can, by naturalizing an\r\n     alien, invest him with the rights and privileges secured to a\r\n     citizen of a State under the Federal Government, although, so far\r\n     as the State alone was concerned, he would undoubtedly be\r\n     entitled to the rights of a citizen, and clothed with all the\r\n     [406] rights and immunities which the Constitution and laws of\r\n     the State attached to that character.\r\n\r\n     \"It is very clear, therefore, that no State can, by any act or\r\n     law of its own, passed since the adoption of the Constitution,\r\n     introduce a new member into the political community created by\r\n     the Constitution of the United States. It cannot make him a\r\n     member of this community by making him a member of its own. And,\r\n     for the same reason, it cannot introduce any person or\r\n     description of persons who were not intended to be embraced in\r\n     this new political family, which the Constitution brought into\r\n     existence, but were intended to be excluded from it.\r\n\r\n     \"The question then arises, whether the provisions of the\r\n     Constitution, in relation to the personal rights and privileges\r\n     to which the citizen of a State should be entitled, embraced the\r\n     negro African race, at that time in this country, or who might\r\n     afterwards be imported, who had then or should afterwards be made\r\n     free in any State; and to put it in the power of a single State\r\n     to make him a citizen of the United States, and indue him with\r\n     the full rights of citizenship in every other State without their\r\n     consent. Does the Constitution of the United States act upon him\r\n     whenever he shall be made free under the laws of a State, and\r\n     raised there to the rank of a citizen, and immediately clothe him\r\n     with all the privileges of a citizen in every other State and in\r\n     its own courts?\r\n\r\n     \"The court think the affirmative of these propositions cannot be\r\n     maintained. And if it cannot, the plaintiff in error could not be\r\n     a citizen of the State of Missouri, within the meaning of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and, consequently, was not\r\n     entitled to sue in its courts.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThis decision of the Supreme Court on the plea in abatement that the\r\nplaintiff (a Negro, Dred Scott) was not a citizen in the sense of the\r\nword in Article iii, Sec. 2 of the Constitution, was based upon an\r\nerroneous idea respecting the location of the word _citizen_ in the\r\ninstrument. The premise of the court was wrong, and hence the\r\nfeebleness of the reasoning and the false conclusions. Article iii,\r\nSection 2 of the Constitution, extends judicial power to all cases, in\r\nlaw and equity, \"between citizens of different States, between\r\ncitizens of the same State,\" etc. But Article iv, Section 2, declares\r\nthat \"citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\" The plea in abatement\r\nwas brought under Article iii, but all the judges, except Justice\r\nMcLean, built their decision upon the word _citizen_ as it stood in\r\nArticle iv.\r\n\r\nBy the constitution of Ohio, adopted in 1851, free Negroes were not\r\nonly denied the right to vote, but were excluded from the militia\r\nservice. This law was not repealed until 1878.\r\n\r\nNeither the constitution of 1802, nor that of 1851, discriminated\r\nagainst free Negroes in matters of education; but separate schools\r\nhave been maintained in Ohio from the beginning down to the present\r\ntime, by special acts of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the territory of Indiana there were quite a number of Negroes from\r\nthe beginning of the century. Some were slaves. In 1806, the first\r\nLegislature, at its second session, passed a law in reference to\r\n_executions_, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 7. And whereas doubts have arisen whether the time of\r\n     service of negroes and mulattoes, bound to service in this\r\n     territory, may be sold on execution against the master, _Be it\r\n     therefore enacted_ that the time of service of such negroes or\r\n     mulattoes may be sold on execution against the master, in the\r\n     same manner as personal estate, immediately from which sale the\r\n     said negroes or mulattoes shall serve the purchaser or purchasers\r\n     for the residue of their time of service; and the said purchasers\r\n     and negroes and mulattoes shall have the same remedies against\r\n     each other as by the laws of the territory are mutually given\r\n     them in the several cases therein mentioned, and the purchasers\r\n     shall be obliged to fulfil to the said servants the contracts\r\n     they made with the masters, as expressed in the indenture or\r\n     agreement of servitude, and shall, for want of such contract, be\r\n     obliged to give him or them their freedom due at the end of the\r\n     time of service, as expressed in the second section of the law of\r\n     the territory, entitled 'Law concerning servants,' adopted the\r\n     twenty-second day of September, eighteen hundred and three. This\r\n     act shall commence and be in force from and after the first day\r\n     of February next.\"[47]\r\n\r\nThis was bold legislation; but it was not all. Negroes were required\r\nto carry passes, as in the slave States. And on the 17th of September,\r\n1807, \"_An Act for the Introduction of Negroes and Mulattoes into_\"\r\nthe territory was passed.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 1. That it shall and may be lawful for any person being the\r\n     owner or possessor of any negroes or mulattoes of and above the\r\n     age of fifteen years, and owning service and labor as slaves in\r\n     any of the States or territories of the United States, or for any\r\n     citizens of the said States or territories purchasing the same to\r\n     bring the said negroes and mulattoes into this territory.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 2. The owners or possessors of any negroes or mulattoes as\r\n     aforesaid, and bringing the same into this territory, shall,\r\n     within thirty days after such removal, go with the same before\r\n     the clerk of Court of Common Pleas of proper county, and in\r\n     presence of said clerk the said owner or possessor shall\r\n     determine and agree to, and with his or her negro or mulatto,\r\n     upon the term of years which the said negro or mulatto will and\r\n     shall serve his or her said owner or possessor, and the clerk\r\n     shall make a record.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 3. If any negro or mulatto removed into this territory as\r\n     aforesaid shall refuse to serve his or her owner as aforesaid, it\r\n     shall and may be lawful for such person, within sixty days\r\n     thereafter, to remove the said negro or mulatto to any place [to]\r\n     which by the laws of the United States or territory from whence\r\n     such owner or possessor may [have come] or shall be authorized to\r\n     remove the same. (As quoted in Phoebe v. Jay, Breese, Ill. R.,\r\n     208.)\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 4. An owner failing to act as required in the preceding\r\n     sections should forfeit all claim and right to the service of\r\n     such negro or mulatto.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 5. Declares that any person removing into this territory\r\n     and being the owner or possessor of any negro or mulatto as\r\n     aforesaid, under the age of fifteen years, or if any person shall\r\n     hereafter acquire a property in any negro or mulatto under the\r\n     age aforesaid, and who shall bring them into this territory, it\r\n     shall and may be lawful for such person, owner, or possessor to\r\n     hold the said negro to service or labor--the males until they\r\n     arrive at the age of thirty-five, and females until they arrive\r\n     at the age of thirty-two years.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 6.

(As quoted in Boon v. Juliet, 1836, 1,\r\n     Scammon, 258.)\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 14. That an act respecting apprentices misused by their\r\n     master or mistress should apply to such children. (See the\r\n     statute cited in Rankin v. Lydia, 2, A. K. Marshall's Ky., 467;\r\n     and in Jarrot v. Jarrot, 2, Gilman, 19.) This act was repealed in\r\n     1810.\"[48]\r\n\r\nUnder the first constitution of Indiana, adopted in 1816, Negroes were\r\nnot debarred from the elective franchise. In Article i, Section 1, of\r\nthe Bill of Rights, this remarkable language occurs: \"That all men are\r\nborn equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent,\r\nand unalienable rights,\" etc. But the very next year the primal rights\r\nof the Negro as a citizen were struck down by the following: \"No\r\nnegro, mulatto, or Indian shall be a witness, except in pleas of the\r\nState against negroes, mulattoes, or Indians, or in civil cases where\r\nnegroes, mulattoes, or Indians alone shall be parties.\"[49]\r\n\r\nIn 1819 [March 22d], an execution law was passed by which the time of\r\nservice of Negroes could be sold on execution against the master, in\r\nthe same manner as personal estate. From the time of the sale, such\r\nNegroes or Mulattoes were compelled to serve the buyer until the\r\nexpiration of the term of service.[50]\r\n\r\nIn 1831, an act regulating free Negroes and Mulattoes, servants and\r\nslaves, declared:\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 1. Negroes and mulattoes emigrating into the State shall\r\n     give bond, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 2. In failure of this, such negro, etc., may be hired out\r\n     and the proceeds applied to his benefit, or removed from the\r\n     State under the poor law.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 3. Penalty for committing such without authority.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 4. Penalty for harboring such who have not given bond.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 5. That the right of any persons to pass through this\r\n     State, with his, her, or their negroes or mulattoes, servant or\r\n     servants, when emigrating or travelling to any other State or\r\n     territory or country, making no unnecessary delay, is hereby\r\n     declared and secured.\"[51]\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the new constitution limited the right of franchise to \"white\r\nmale citizens of the United States.\" \"No negro or mulatto shall have\r\nthe right of suffrage.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Art. xii., Sec. 1. The militia shall consist of all able-bodied\r\n     white male persons, between, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"Art. xiii., Sec. 1. No negro or mulatto shall come into, or\r\n     settle in the State after the adoption of this Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 2. All contracts made with any negro or mulatto coming into\r\n     the State contrary to the foregoing section shall be void; and\r\n     any person who shall employ such negro or mulatto or encourage\r\n     him to remain in the State shall be fined not less than ten, nor\r\n     more than five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 3. All fines which may be collected for a violation of the\r\n     provisions of this article, or of any law hereafter passed for\r\n     the purpose of carrying the same into execution, shall be set\r\n     apart and appropriated for the colonization of such negroes and\r\n     mulattoes and their descendants as may be in the State at the\r\n     adoption of this Constitution and may be willing to emigrate.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 4. The General Assembly shall pass laws to carry out the\r\n     provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\nOther severe laws were enacted calculated to modify and limit the\r\nrights of free persons of color.\r\n\r\nThe first constitution of the State of Illinois, adopted in 1818,\r\nlimited the [Art. ii, Sec. 27] elective franchise to \"free white\"\r\npersons. Article v, Sec. 1, exempted \"negroes, mulattoes, and Indians\"\r\nfrom service in the militia. In March, 1819, \"_An Act Respecting Free\r\nNegroes, Mulattoes, Servants, and Slaves_\" passed. Sec. 1 required\r\nNegro and Mulatto persons coming into the State to produce a\r\ncertificate of freedom. Sec. 2 required them to register their family\r\nas well as themselves. Sec. 3 required persons bringing slaves into\r\nthe State, for the purpose of emancipating them, to give bonds. Passes\r\nwere required of Colored people, and many other hard exactions. The\r\nbill above referred to contained twenty-five sections.[52]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, 1827, a criminal code was enacted for offences\r\ncommitted by Negroes and servants, which contained many cruel\r\nfeatures. On the 2d of February a law was passed declaring that all\r\nNegroes, Mulattoes, and Indians were incompetent to be witnesses in\r\nany court against a white person; and that a person having one fourth\r\npart Negro blood shall be adjudged a Mulatto. This law was re-enacted\r\nin 1845.[53] In 1853, February 12th, the Legislature of Illinois\r\npassed \"_An Act to Prevent the Immigration of Free Negroes into this\r\nState_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Secs. 1, 2. Fine and imprisonment for bringing slave, for any\r\n     purpose, into the State. _Proviso_: 'That this shall not be\r\n     construed so as to affect persons or slaves, _bona fide_,\r\n     travelling through this State from and to any other State in the\r\n     United States.'\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 3. Misdemeanor for negro or mulatto, bond or free, to come\r\n     with intention of residing.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 4. Such may be prosecuted and fined or sold, for time, for\r\n     fine and costs.\r\n\r\n     \"Secs. 5, 6, 7. If such do not afterwards remove, increased fine\r\n     and like proceedings, etc., etc. Appeal allowed to the circuit.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 8. If claimed as fugitive slave, after being thus arrested,\r\n     a justice of the peace, 'after hearing the evidence, and being\r\n     satisfied that the person or persons claiming said negro or\r\n     mulatto is or are the owner or owners of and entitled to the\r\n     custody of said negro or mulatto, in accordance with the laws of\r\n     the United States passed upon this subject,' shall give the owner\r\n     a certificate, after his paying the costs and the negro's unpaid\r\n     fine, 'and the said owner or agent so claiming shall have a right\r\n     to take and remove said slave out of the State.'\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 9. Punishment of justice for nonfeasance, and of witness\r\n     falsely accusing negro.\"[54]\r\n\r\nWhile slavery had no legal, constitutional existence in the three\r\nborder States, there were, in fact, quite a number of slaves within\r\ntheir jurisdiction during the first generation of their existence. And\r\nthe free people of Color were, _first_, denied the right of\r\ncitizenship; _second_, excluded from the militia service; _third_,\r\nruled out of the courts whenever their testimony was offered against a\r\nwhite person; _fourth_, could not come into the free border States\r\nwithout producing a certificate of freedom; and, _fifth_, were annoyed\r\nby many little, mean laws in the exercise of the few rights they were\r\nsuffered to enjoy. A full description of the infamous \"_Black Code_\"\r\nof these States would occupy too much space, and, therefore, the dark\r\nsubject must be dismissed. Posterity shall know, however, how\r\npatiently the free Negroes of the Northern States endured the\r\nrestrictions and proscriptions which law and public sentiment threw\r\nacross their social and political pathway!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] 1, Chase, p. 393, sects. 1-7.\r\n\r\n[38] 1, Chase, p. 555.\r\n\r\n[39] Jeffries _vs._ Ankeny, 11, Ohio, p. 375.\r\n\r\n[40] 2, Chase L., p. 1052.\r\n\r\n[41] Curwen, p. 533.\r\n\r\n[42] Revised Statutes of Ohio, vol. i. p. 60.\r\n\r\n[43] Ibid., p. 111.\r\n\r\n[44] Elliot's Debates, vol. i. p. 79.\r\n\r\n[45] Sanford's Dred Scott Case, pp. 397-399.\r\n\r\n[46] Howard's Reports, vol. xix. pp. 403-405, sq.\r\n\r\n[47] Hurd, vol ii. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[48] Terr. laws 1807-8, p. 423.\r\n\r\n[49] Laws of 1817, ch. 3, sec. 52.\r\n\r\n[50] See Hurd, vol. ii. p. 129.\r\n\r\n[51] Revised Laws of Indiana, 1838.\r\n\r\n[52] Session Laws, 1819, p. 354.

Their\r\nfreedom was merely nominal. They were despised beneath the slaves, and\r\nwere watched with suspicious eyes, and disliked by their brethren in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 there were 196,016 free Negroes in the Northern States. Their\r\nincrease came from [chiefly] two sources, viz.: births and emancipated\r\npersons from the South. Fugitive slaves generally went to Canada, for\r\nin addition to being in danger of arrest under the fugitive-slave law,\r\nnone of the State governments in the North sympathized with escaped\r\nNegroes. The Negroes in the free States were denied the rights of\r\ncitizenship, and were left to the most destroying ignorance. In 1780,\r\nsome free Negroes, of the town of Dartmouth, petitioned the General\r\nCourt of Massachusetts for relief from taxation, because they were\r\ndenied the privileges and duties of citizenship. The petition set\r\nforth the hardships free Negroes were obliged to endure, even in\r\nMassachusetts, and was in itself a proof of the fitness of the\r\npetitioners for the duties of citizenship.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Honorable Council and House of Representatives, in\r\n     General Court Assembled, for the State of Massachusetts Bay, in\r\n     New England_:\r\n\r\n     \"The petition of several poor negroes and mulattoes, who are\r\n     inhabitants of the town of Dartmouth, humbly showeth:\r\n\r\n     \"That we being chiefly of the African extract, and by reason of\r\n     long bondage and hard slavery, we have been deprived of enjoying\r\n     the profits of our labor or the advantage of inheriting estates\r\n     from our parents, as our neighbors the white people do, having\r\n     some of us not long enjoyed our own freedom; yet of late,\r\n     contrary to the invariable custom and practice of the country, we\r\n     have been, and now are, taxed both in our polls and that small\r\n     pittance of estate which, through much hard labor and industry,\r\n     we have got together to sustain ourselves and families withall.\r\n     We apprehend it, therefore, to be hard usage, and will doubtless\r\n     (if continued) reduce us to a state of beggary, whereby we shall\r\n     become a burthen to others, if not timely prevented by the\r\n     interposition of your justice and power.\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioners further show, that we apprehend ourselves to be\r\n     aggrieved, in that, while we are not allowed the privilege of\r\n     freemen of the State, having no vote or influence in the election\r\n     of those that tax us, yet many of our color (as is well known)\r\n     have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defence of the\r\n     common cause, and that (as we conceive) against a similar\r\n     exertion of power (in regard to taxation) too well known to need\r\n     a recital in this place.\r\n\r\n     \"We most humble request, therefore, that you would take our\r\n     unhappy case into your serious consideration, and, in your wisdom\r\n     and power, grant us relief from taxation, while under our present\r\n     depressed circumstances; and your poor petitioners, as in duty\r\n     bound, shall ever pray, etc.\r\n\r\n                                        \"JOHN CUFFE,\r\n                                        \"ADVENTUR CHILD,\r\n                                        \"PAUL CUFFE,\r\n                                        \"SAMUEL GRAY, [his x mark.]\r\n                                        \"PERO ROWLAND, [his x mark.]\r\n                                        \"PERO RUSSELL, [his x mark.]\r\n                                        \"PERO COGGESHALL.\r\n\r\n     \"Dated at Dartmouth, the 10th of February, 1780.\r\n\r\n     \"Memorandum in the handwriting of John Cuffe:\r\n\r\n     \"This is the copy of the petition which we did deliver unto the\r\n     Honorable Council and House, for relief from taxation in the days\r\n     of our distress.

It has been said, upon good\r\nauthority, that this law was drawn by several of the ablest lawyers in\r\nthe Bay State, and was intended to keep out all Negroes from the South\r\nwho, being emancipated, might desire to settle there. It became a law\r\non the 26th of March, 1788, and instead of becoming a dead letter, was\r\npublished and enforced in post-haste.

from the courts. Although born on the soil,\r\na soldier in two wars, an industrious, law-abiding _person_, the\r\nNegro, nevertheless, was not regarded as a member of political\r\nsociety. He was taxed, but enjoyed no representation; was governed by\r\nlaws, and yet, had no voice in making the laws.\r\n\r\nThe doors of nearly all the schools of the entire North were shut in\r\nhis face; and the few separate schools accorded him were given\r\ngrudgingly. They were usually held in the lecture-room of some Colored\r\nchurch edifice, or thrust off to one side in a portion of the city or\r\ntown toward which aristocratic ambition would never turn. These\r\nschools were generally poorly equipped; and the teachers were either\r\nColored persons whose opportunities of securing an education had been\r\npoor, or white persons whose mental qualifications would not encourage\r\nthem to make an honest living among their own race; there were noble\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nA deeply rooted prejudice shut the Negro out from the trades. He could\r\nnot acquire the art of setting type, civil engineering, building\r\nmachinery, house carpentering, or any of the trades. The schools of\r\nmedicine, law, and theology were not open to him; and even if he\r\nsecured admission into some gentleman's office, or instruction from\r\nsome divine, the future gave him no promise. The white wings of hope\r\nwere broken in an ineffectual attempt to move against the bitter winds\r\nof persecution, under the dark sky of hate and proscription.\r\nCorporations, churches, theatres, and political parties made the Negro\r\na subject of official action. If a Negro travelled by stage coach, it\r\nwas among the baggage in the \"boot,\" or on top with the driver. If he\r\nwere favored with a ride on a street car, it was in a separate car\r\nmarked, \"_This car for Colored people_.\" If he journeyed any distance\r\nby rail, he was assigned to the \"Jim Crow\" car, or \"smoker,\" where\r\nhimself and family were subjected to inconvenience, insult, and the\r\nsociety of the lowest class of white rowdies. If he were hungry and\r\nweary at the end of the journey, there was \"no room for him in the\r\ninn,\" and, like his Master, was assigned a place among the cattle. If\r\nhe were so fortunate as to get into a hotel as a servant, bearing the\r\nbaggage of his master, he slept in the garret, and took his meals in\r\nthe kitchen. It mattered not who the Colored man was--whether it was\r\nLangston, the lawyer, McCune Smith, the physician, or Douglass, the\r\norator--he found no hotel that would give him accommodations. And\r\nforsooth, if some host had the temerity to admit a Negro to his\r\ndining-room, a dozen white guests would leave the hotel rather than\r\nsubmit to the \"_outrage_!\"\r\n\r\nThe places of amusements in all the large cities in the North excluded\r\nthe Negro; and when he did gain admission, he was shown to the\r\ngallery, where he could enjoy peanut-hulls, boot-blacks, and\r\n\"black-legs.\" Occasionally the side door of a college was put ajar for\r\nsome invincible Negro. But this was a performance of very rare\r\noccurrence; and the instances are easily remembered.\r\n\r\nWhen courts and parties, corporations and companies had refused to\r\naccord the Negro the rights that were his due as a man, he carried his\r\ncase to the highest earthly court, the Christian Church. He felt sure\r\nof sympathy and succor from this source. The Church had stood through\r\nthe centuries as a refuge for the unfortunate and afflicted. But,\r\nalas! the Church shrank from the Negro as if he had been a reptile. If\r\nhe gained admission it was to the \"Negro pew\" in the \"organ loft.\" If\r\nhe secured the precious \"emblems of the broken body and shed blood\" of\r\nhis Divine Master, it was after the \"white folks\" were through. If the\r\ncause of the Negro were mentioned in the prayer or sermon, it was in\r\nthe indistinct whisper of the moral coward who occupied the sacred\r\ndesk. And when the fight was on at fever heat, when it was popular to\r\nplead the cause of the slave and demand the rights of the free Negro,\r\nthe Church was the last organization in the country to take a position\r\non the question; and even then, her \"moderation was known to all men.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Negro had suffered from neglect only, had been left to solve\r\nthe riddle of his anomalous existence without further embarrassment,\r\nit would have been well. But no, it was not so. Studied insolence\r\njostled Colored men and women from the streets of the larger cities;\r\nmobocratic violence broke up assemblages and churches of Colored\r\npeople; and malice sought them in the quiet of their homes--outraged\r\nand slew them in cold blood. Thus with the past as a haunting, bitter\r\nrecollection, the present filled with fear and disaster, and the\r\nfuture a shapeless horror, think ye life was sweet to the Negro?\r\nBitter? Bitter as death? Ay, bitter as hell!\r\n\r\nDriven down from the lofty summit of laudable ambitions into the\r\nsultry plains of domestic drudgery and menial toil, nearly every ray\r\nof hope had perished upon the strained vision of the Negro. The only\r\nthing young Colored men could aspire to was the position of a waiter,\r\nthe avocation of a barber, the place of a house-servant or groom, and\r\nteach or preach to their own people with little or no qualifications.\r\nDenied the opportunities and facilities of securing an education, they\r\nwere upbraided by the press and pulpit, in private gatherings and\r\npublic meetings, for their ignorance, which was enforced by a narrow\r\nand contracted public prejudice.\r\n\r\nBut \"none of these things moved\" the Negro. Undismayed he bowed to his\r\nherculean task with a complacency and courage worthy of any race or\r\nage of the world's history. The small encouragement that came to him\r\nfrom the conscientious minority of white men and women was as\r\nrefreshing as the cool ocean breeze at even-tide to the feverish brow\r\nof a travel-soiled pilgrim. The Negro found it necessary to exert\r\n_himself_, to lift himself out of his social, mental, and political\r\ndilemma by the straps of his boots. Colored men turned their attention\r\nto the education of themselves and their children. Schools were begun,\r\nchurches organized, and work of general improvement and self-culture\r\nentered into with alacrity and enthusiasm. Boston had among its\r\nteachers the scholarly Thomas Paul; among its clergymen Leonard A.\r\nGrimes and John T. Raymond; among its lawyers Robert Morris and E. G.\r\nWalker; among its business men J. B. Smith and Coffin Pitts; among its\r\nphysicians John R. Rock and John V. DeGrasse; among its authors Brown\r\nand Nell; and among its orators Remond and Hilton. Robert Morris was\r\nadmitted to the bar in Boston, on Thursday, June 27, 1850, at a\r\nmeeting of the members of the Suffolk County Bar. The record is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That ROBERT MORRIS, Esq., be recommended for\r\n     admittance to practice as a Counsellor and Attorney of the\r\n     Circuit and District Courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n                    \"(Signed)   ELLIS GRAY LORING, _Chairman_.\r\n                                \"CHAS. THEO. RUSSELL, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nJohn V. DeGrasse, M.D., an eminent physician of Boston was perhaps the\r\nmost accomplished Colored gentleman in New England between 1850-1860.\r\nThe following notice appeared in a Boston journal in August, 1854:\r\n\r\n     \"On the 24th of August, 1854, Mr. DeGrasse was admitted in due\r\n     form a member of the 'Massachusetts Medical Society.' It is the\r\n     first instance of such honor being conferred upon a colored man\r\n     in this State, at least, and probably in the country; and\r\n     therefore it deserves particular notice, both because the means\r\n     by which he has reached this distinction are creditable to his\r\n     own intelligence and perseverance, and because others of his\r\n     class may be stimulated to seek an elevation which has hitherto\r\n     been supposed unattainable by men of color. The Doctor is a\r\n     native of New York City, where he was born in June, 1825, and\r\n     where he spent his time in private and public schools till 1840.\r\n     He then entered the Oneida Institute, Beriah Green, President,\r\n     and spent one year; but as Latin was not taught there, he left\r\n     and entered the Clinton Seminary, where he remained two years,\r\n     intending to enter college in the fall of 1843. He was turned\r\n     from this purpose, however, by the persuasions of a friend in\r\n     France, and after spending two years in a college in that\r\n     country, he returned to New York in November, 1845, and commenced\r\n     the study of medicine with Dr. Samuel R. Childs, of that city.\r\n     There he spent two years in patient and diligent study, and then\r\n     two more in attending the medical lectures of Bowdoin College,\r\n     Me. Leaving that institution with honor in May, 1849, he went\r\n     again to Europe in the autumn of that year, and spent\r\n     considerable time in the hospitals of Paris, travelling, at\r\n     intervals, through parts of France, England, Italy, and\r\n     Switzerland. Returning home in the ship 'Samuel Fox,' in the\r\n     capacity of surgeon, he was married in August, 1852, and since\r\n     that time he has practised medicine in Boston. Earning a good\r\n     reputation here by his diligence and skill, he was admitted a\r\n     member of the Medical Society, as above stated. Many of our most\r\n     respectable physicians visit and advise with him whenever counsel\r\n     is required. The Boston medical profession, it must be\r\n     acknowledged, has done itself honor in thus discarding the law of\r\n     caste, and generously acknowledging real merit, without regard to\r\n     the hue of the skin.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colored population of New York was equal to the great emergency\r\nthat required them to put forth their personal exertions. Dr. Henry\r\nHighland Garnet, Dr. Charles B. Ray, and the Rev. Peter Williams in\r\nthe pulpit; Charles L. Reason and William Peterson as teachers; James\r\nMcCune Smith and Philip A. White as physicians and chemists; James\r\nWilliams and Jacob Day among business men, did much to elevate the\r\nNegro in self-respect and self-support.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia early ranked among her foremost leaders of the Colored\r\npeople, William Whipper, Stephen Smith, Robert Purvis, William Still,\r\nFrederick A. Hinton, and Joseph Cassey. From an inquiry instituted in\r\n1837, it was ascertained that out of the 18,768 Colored people in\r\nPhiladelphia, 250 had paid for their freedom the aggregate sum of\r\n$79,612, and that the real and personal property owned by them was\r\nnear $1,500,000. There were returns of several chartered benevolent\r\nsocieties for the purpose of affording mutual aid in sickness and\r\ndistress, and there were sixteen houses of public worship, with over\r\n4,000 communicants. And in Western Pennsylvania there were John Peck,\r\nJohn B. Vashon, Geo. Gardner, and Lewis Woodson. Every State in the\r\nNorth seemed to produce Colored men of marked ability to whom God\r\ncommitted a great work. Their examples of patient fortitude, industry,\r\nand frugality, and their determined efforts to obtain knowledge and\r\nbuild up character, stimulated the youth of the Negro race to greater\r\nexertions in the upward direction.\r\n\r\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church was organized as early as 1816.\r\nIts churches grew and its ministry increased in numbers, intelligence,\r\nand piety, until it became the most powerful organization of Colored\r\nmen on the continent. The influence of this organization upon the\r\nColored race in America was excellent. It brought the people together,\r\nnot only in religious sympathy, but by the ties of a common interest\r\nin all affairs of their race and condition. The men in the\r\norganization who possessed the power of speech, who had talents to\r\ndevelop, and an ambition to serve their race, found this church a wide\r\nfield of usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe Colored Baptists were organized before the Methodists, [in\r\nVirginia,] but their organization has always lacked strength. The form\r\nof government, being purely Democratic, was adapted to a people of\r\nlarger intelligence and possessed of greater capacity for\r\nself-government. But, notwithstanding this fact, the \"independent\"\r\norder of Colored Baptists gave the members and clergymen of the\r\ndenomination exalted ideas of government, and abiding confidence in\r\nthe capacity of the Negro for self-government. No organization of\r\nColored people in America has produced such able men as the Colored\r\nBaptist Church.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, Colored men distinguished\r\nthemselves in the pulpit, in the forum, in business, and letters.\r\nWilliam Howard Day, of Cleveland, during this period [1850-1860]\r\nLibrarian of the Cleveland Library and editor of a newspaper; John\r\nMercer Langston, of Oberlin; John Liverpool and John I. Gaines, of\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, were good men and true. What they did for their race\r\nwas done worthily and well. At the Ohio Anti-Slavery Convention, held\r\nat Putnam on the 22d, 23d, and 24th of April, 1835, the committee on\r\nthe condition of the \"people of Color,\" made the following report from\r\nCincinnati:\r\n\r\n     The number of Colored people in Cincinnati is about 2,500. As\r\n     illustrating their general condition, we will give the statistics\r\n     of one or two small districts. The families in each were visited\r\n     from house to house, taking them all as far as we went:\r\n\r\n     Number of families in one of these districts                     26\r\n       \"    of individuals                                           125\r\n       \"    of heads of families                                      49\r\n       \"    of heads of families who are professors of religion       19\r\n       \"    of children at school                                     20\r\n       \"    of _heads of families_ who have been slaves               39\r\n       \"    of individuals who have been slaves                       95\r\n     Time since they obtained their freedom, from 1 to 15 years;\r\n        average, 7 years.\r\n     Number of individuals who have purchased themselves              23\r\n     Whole amount paid for themselves                             $9,112\r\n     Number of fathers and mothers still in slavery                    9\r\n       \"    of children                                               18\r\n       \"    of brothers and sisters                                   98\r\n       \"    of newspapers taken                                        0\r\n       \"    of heads of families who can read                          2\r\n\r\n     EMPLOYMENT OF HEADS OF FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n     Common laborers and porters         7\r\n     Dealers in second-hand clothing     1\r\n     Hucksters                           1\r\n     Carpenters                          2\r\n     Shoe-blacks                         6\r\n     Cooks and waiters                  11\r\n     Washer-women                       18\r\n\r\n     Five of these women purchased themselves from slavery.

All this she has done by\r\n     washing.\r\n\r\n     Another individual had bargained for his wife and two children.\r\n     Their master agreed to take four hundred and twenty dollars for\r\n     them. He succeeded at length in raising the money, which he\r\n     carried to their owner. \"I shall charge you thirty dollars more\r\n     than when you was here before,\" said the planter, \"for your wife\r\n     is in a family-way, and you may pay thirty dollars for that or\r\n     not take her, just as you please.\" \"And so,\" said he (patting\r\n     the head of a little son, three years old, who hung upon his\r\n     knee), \"I had to pay thirty dollars for this little fellow six\r\n     months before he was born.\"\r\n\r\n     Number of families in another district                         63\r\n       \"    of individuals                                         258\r\n       \"    of heads of families                                   106\r\n       \"    of families who are professors of religion              16\r\n       \"    of heads of families at school                          53\r\n       \"    of newspapers taken                                      7\r\n     Amount of property in real estate                          $9,850\r\n     Number of _individuals_ who have been slaves                  108\r\n       \"    of _heads of families_ who have been slaves             69\r\n     Age at which they obtained their freedom, from 3 months to\r\n         60 years; average, 33 years.\r\n     Time since they obtained their freedom, from 4 weeks to 27\r\n         years; average, 9 years.\r\n     Number of heads of families who have purchased themselves,     36\r\n     Whole amount paid for themselves                       $21,515.00\r\n     Average price                                             $597.64\r\n     Number of children which the same families have already\r\n         purchased                                                  14\r\n     Whole amount paid for these children                    $2,425.75\r\n     Average price                                             $173.27\r\n     Total amount paid for these parents and children       $23,940.75\r\n     Number of parents still in slavery                             16\r\n       \"    of husbands or wives                                     7\r\n       \"    of children                                             35\r\n       \"    of brothers and sisters                                144\r\n\r\n     These districts were visited without the least reference to their\r\n     being exhibited separately. If they give a fair specimen of the\r\n     whole population (and we believe that to be a fact), then we have\r\n     the following results: 1,129 of the Colored population of\r\n     Cincinnati have been in slavery; 476 have purchased themselves,\r\n     at the total expense of $215,522.04, averaging for each, $452.77;\r\n     163 parents are still in slavery, 68 husbands and wives, 346\r\n     children, 1,579 brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n     There are a large number in the city who are now working out\r\n     their own freedom--their free papers being retained as security.\r\n     One man of our acquaintance has just given his master seven notes\r\n     of one hundred dollars each, one of which he intends to pay every\r\n     year, till he has paid them all; his master promises then to give\r\n     him his free papers. After paying for himself, he intends to buy\r\n     his wife and then his children. Others are buying their husbands\r\n     or wives, and others again their parents or children. To show\r\n     that on this subject they have sympathies like other people, we\r\n     will state a single fact. A young man, after purchasing himself,\r\n     earned three hundred dollars. This sum he supposed was sufficient\r\n     to purchase his aged mother, a widow, whom he had left in slavery\r\n     five years before, in Virginia. Hearing that she was for sale, he\r\n     started immediately to purchase her. But, after travelling five\r\n     hundred miles, and offering all his money, he was refused. Not\r\n     because she was not for sale, nor because he did not offer her\r\n     full value. She had four sons and daughters with her, and the\r\n     planter thought he could do better to keep the family together\r\n     and send them all down the river. In vain the affectionate son\r\n     pleaded for his mother. The planter's heart was steel. He would\r\n     not sell her, and with a heavy heart the young man returned to\r\n     Cincinnati. He has since heard that they were sold in the New\r\n     Orleans market \"_in lots to suit purchasers_.\"\r\n\r\nCincinnati produced quite a number of business men among her Colored\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY BOYD\r\n\r\nwas born in the State of Kentucky, on the 14th day of May, 1802. He\r\nreceived some instruction in reading and writing. He was bound out to\r\na gentleman, from whom he learned the cabinet-making trade. He\r\ndeveloped at quite an early age a genius for working in all kinds of\r\nwood--could make any thing in the business. He came to Ohio in 1826,\r\nand located in Cincinnati. He was a fine-looking man of twenty-four\r\nyears, and a master mechanic. He expected to secure employment in some\r\nof the cabinet shops in the city. Accordingly, he applied at several,\r\nbut as often as he applied he was refused employment on the ground of\r\ncomplexional prejudice. In some instances the proprietor was willing\r\nthat a Colored man should work for him, but the white mechanics would\r\nnot work by the side of a Colored man. In other cases it was quite\r\ndifferent. The proprietors would not entertain the idea of securing\r\nthe services of a \"Black mechanic.\" So it was for weeks that Mr. Boyd\r\nsought an opportunity to use his skill in the direction of his genius\r\nand training; but he sought in vain. Disappointed, though not\r\ndisheartened, he turned to the work of a stevedore, which he did for\r\nfour months. At the expiration of this time he found employment with a\r\nhouse-builder. Within six months from the time he began work as a\r\nbuilder he had so thoroughly mastered the trade that he quit working\r\nas a journeyman, formed a co-partnership with a white man, and went\r\ninto business. The gentleman with whom he joined his fortunes was a\r\nmechanic of excellent abilities, and acknowledged the superior fitness\r\nof Boyd for the business.\r\n\r\nAs a builder he succeeded first-rate for four years. But his color was\r\nagainst him. His white partner would make the contracts, secure the\r\njobs, and then Boyd would come forward when the work was to be done.\r\nHe had an abundance of work, and always finished it to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of his patrons. It is impossible to estimate just how\r\nmany houses he built, but the number is not small. He had made a\r\nbeginning, and secured some capital. He did not like the builder's\r\ntrade, and only entered it at the first from necessity--as a\r\nstepping-stone to his own trade, for which he had a great deal of\r\nenthusiasm. In 1836, ten years after his arrival in Cincinnati, he\r\nengaged in the manufacture of bedsteads. For six years he carried on\r\nthis business--found a ready market and liberal pay. He brought to his\r\nbusiness some of the oldest buyers in the bedstead line, and had a\r\ntrade that kept him busy at all seasons of the year. His very\r\nexcellent business habits won for him many friends, and through their\r\nsolicitations he enlarged his business by manufacturing all kinds of\r\nfurniture. He put up a building on the corner of Eighth Street and\r\nBroadway, where he carried on his manufacturing from 1836 till 1859, a\r\nperiod of twenty-three years. His business required four large\r\nbuildings and a force of skilful workmen, never less than twenty,\r\nfrequently fifty. He used the most approved machinery and paid\r\nexcellent wages.\r\n\r\nHis manufactory presented, perhaps, what was never seen in this\r\ncountry before or since. His workmen represented almost all the\r\nleading races. There were Negroes, Americans, Irishmen, Scotchmen,\r\nEnglishmen, Frenchmen, and men of other nationalities. And they didn't\r\nbite each other! Their relations were pleasant.\r\n\r\nHe was burned out three times, but he rebuilt and went ahead. He was\r\ndoing such an extensive business that some thought it advisable to\r\ndestroy his buildings. His losses were very heavy, yet he kept right\r\non, and kept up his business for some time; but finally had to yield\r\nat the last fire, when he had no insurance.\r\n\r\nHe invented a machine to turn the rails of a bed, but being a Colored\r\nman he could not take out a patent. He, therefore, had one taken out\r\nin the name of a white gentleman. \"The Boyd bedstead\" sold throughout\r\nthe United States then, and was popular for many years after he quit\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\nHe has been engaged in several different businesses since he quit\r\nmanufacturing, and for the last nine years has been in the employ of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL T. WILCOX.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Samuel T. Wilcox decided to embark in some business venture in\r\nCincinnati. Accordingly he built a store on the northeast corner of\r\nBroadway and Fifth streets. He at once occupied it as a grocer. In\r\nthose days fancy groceries were not kept. But Mr. Wilcox opened a new\r\nera in the business. He introduced fancy articles, such as all\r\nvarieties of canned fruit, choice liquors, cigars, first quality of\r\nhams, all kinds of dried fruit, the best brands of sugars, molasses,\r\nand fine soaps. He made a specialty of these, and succeeded admirably.\r\n\r\nHis trade was divided between two classes--the finest river packets\r\nand the best families of the city. His customers were the very _best\r\nfamilies_--people of wealth and high standing. And perhaps no grocer\r\nof his times in Cincinnati did so large a business as Samuel T.\r\nWilcox.\r\n\r\nHis business increased rapidly until he did about $140,000 _of trade\r\nper year_! This continued for six years, when his social habits were\r\nnot favorable to permanent success. He had been sole owner of the\r\nbusiness up to this time. He sold out one half of the store to Charles\r\nRoxboro, Sr.; thus the firm name became \"Wilcox & Roxboro.\" The latter\r\ngentleman was energetic and business-like in his habits. He cast his\r\ncourage and marvellous tact against the high tide of business disaster\r\nthat came sweeping along in the last days of the firm. He resorted to\r\nevery honorable and safe expedient in order to avert failure. But the\r\nhandwriting was upon the wall. He failed. Wilcox had begun business\r\nwith $25,000 cash. He had accumulated $60,000 in real estate, and had\r\ntransacted $140,000 of business in a single year! He failed because\r\nhis life was immoral, his habits extravagant, and his attention to\r\nbusiness indifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEX. S. THOMAS.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman came to Cincinnati in 1852, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of a Colored gentleman of intelligence, J. P. Ball, who\r\nwas in the daguerrian business at Nos. 28 and 30 West Fourth Street.\r\nMr. Thomas became affianced to Miss Elizabeth Ball, sister of J. P.\r\nBall; and after they were married, Mr. Thomas accepted the position of\r\nreception clerk for his brother-in-law. He filled this position with\r\ncredit and honor for the space of one year. It was now 1853.\r\nDaguerrotypes were all the \"rage.\" Photography was unknown. Mr. Ball\r\nhad an excellent run of custom, and was making money rapidly.\r\n\r\nAs operator, Mr. Ball soon discovered that Mr. Thomas was a man of\r\nquick perception, thorough, and entirely trustworthy. He soon became\r\nfamiliar with the instrument, and in 1854 began to \"operate.\" He\r\ncontinued at the instrument during the remainder of the time he spent\r\nat 28 West Fourth Street. He shortly acquired the skill of an old and\r\nwell-trained operator; and his success in this department of the\r\nbusiness added greatly to the already well-established reputation of\r\nthe gallery.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas was not satisfied with being a successful clerk and\r\nfirst-class operator. He wanted to go into business for himself.\r\nAccordingly he opened a gallery at No. 120 West Fourth Street, near\r\nthe \"Commercial,\" under the firm name of \"Ball & Thomas.\" The rooms\r\nwere handsomely fitted up, and the building leased for five years.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1860, a severe tornado passed over the city, destroying much\r\nproperty and several lives. The roof of the Commercial [Potter's\r\nBuilding] was carried away; part passed over the gallery of Ball &\r\nThomas, while part went through the operating room, and some fragments\r\nof timber, etc., penetrated a saloon in the rear of the photographic\r\ngallery, and killed a child and a woman. The gallery was a complete\r\nwreck, the instruments, chemicals, scenery, cases, pictures, carpets,\r\nfurniture, and every thing else, were ruined. This was in the early\r\ndays of the firm. All their available capital had been converted into\r\nstock, used in fitting up the gallery. Ball & Thomas were young\r\nmen--they were Colored men, and were financially ruined. Apparently\r\ntheir business was at an end. But they were artists; and many white\r\nfamilies in Cincinnati recognized them as such. Their white friends\r\ncame to the rescue. The gallery was fitted up again most elaborately,\r\nand was known as \"the finest photographic gallery west of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains.\"\r\n\r\nThis marked a distinct era in the history of the firm, and many\r\npersons often remarked that the luckiest moment in their history was\r\nwhen the roof of the Commercial building sat down upon them. For years\r\nthe best families of the city patronized the famous firm of Ball &\r\nThomas. They had more business than they could attend to at times, and\r\nconsequently had to engage extra help. These were years of\r\nunprecedented success. One hundred dollars a day was small money then.\r\nThe firm became quite wealthy. After spending fifteen years at 120\r\nthey returned to 30 West Fourth Street, where they remained until May,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nPhotographers move considerable, and it is seldom that men in this\r\nbusiness remain in one street or building as long as Ball & Thomas.\r\nThey passed twenty-one of the best years of the firm in Fourth Street.\r\nThis is both a compliment to the public and themselves. It shows, on\r\nthe one hand, that Colored men can conduct business like white men,\r\nand, on the other hand, if Colored men have ability to carry on any\r\nkind of business, white people will patronize them.\r\n\r\nThe old stand at 30 West Fourth Street was fitted up anew, and\r\nbusiness began with all the wonted zeal and desire to please the\r\npublic which characterized the firm in former years. The rooms were at\r\nonce elegant and capacious. Their motto was to do the best work at the\r\ncheapest rates. But as in all other businesses, so in photographic\r\nart, there was competition. And rather than do poor work at the low\r\nrates of competitors, they decided to remove to another locality.\r\nAccordingly, in May, 1874, they moved into No. 146 West Fifth Street.\r\nThe building was leased for a term of years. It was in no wise adapted\r\nto the photographic business. The walls were cut out, doors made,\r\nstairs changed, skylight put in, chemical rooms constructed,\r\ngas-fixtures put in, papering, painting, and graining done, carpets\r\nand new furniture ordered. It cost the firm more than $2,800 to enter\r\nthis new stand.\r\n\r\nThe first year at the new stand was characterized by liberal custom\r\nand excellent work. The old customers who were delighted with the work\r\ndone at 30 West Fourth Street, were convinced that the firm had\r\nredoubled its artistic zeal, and was determined to outdo the palmy\r\ndays of Fourth Street. The business, which at this time was in a\r\nflourishing condition, was destined to suffer an interruption in the\r\ndeath of Thomas Carroll Ball, the senior member of the firm. It was\r\nat a time when the trade demanded the energies of both gentlemen. But\r\nDeath never tarries to consider the far-reach of results or the wishes\r\nof the friends of his subject. The business continued. Ball Thomas,\r\nthe son of Mr. A. S. Thomas, who had grown up under the faithful\r\ntuition of his father, now became a successful retouching artist. For\r\nthe last two years Mr. Thomas has conducted the business alone. He is\r\nnow doing business at 166 West Fifth Street, and it is said that he is\r\ndoing a good business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Colored people of Cincinnati evinced not only an anxiety to take\r\ncare of themselves, but took steps early toward securing a home for\r\nthe orphans in their midst.\r\n\r\nIn _ante-bellum_ days there was no provision made for Colored paupers\r\nor Colored orphans. Where individual sympathy or charity did not\r\nintervene, they were left to die in the midst of squalid poverty, and\r\nwere cast into the common ditch, without having medical aid or\r\nministerial consolation. There was not simply studious neglect, but a\r\nstrong prohibition against their entrance into institutions sustained\r\nby the county and State for white persons not more fortunate than\r\nthey. At one time a good Quaker was superintendent of the county\r\npoorhouse. His heart was touched with kindest sympathy for the\r\nuncared-for Colored paupers in Cincinnati. He acted the part of a true\r\nSamaritan, and gave them separate quarters in the institution of which\r\nhe was the official head. This fact came to the public ear, and the\r\ntrustees of the poorhouse, in accordance with their own convictions\r\nand in compliance with the complexional prejudices of the community,\r\ndischarged the Quaker for this breach of the law. The Colored paupers\r\nwere turned out of this lazar-house on the Sabbath. The time to\r\nperpetuate this crime against humanity was indeed significant--on the\r\nLord's day. The God of the poor and His followers beheld the streets\r\nof Christian Cincinnati filled with the maimed, halt, sick, and poor,\r\nwho were denied the common fare accorded the white paupers! There was\r\nno sentiment in those days, either in the pulpit or press, to raise\r\nits voice against this act of cruelty and shame.\r\n\r\nLydia P. Mott, an eminent member of the Society of Friends and an able\r\nleader of a conscientious few, espoused the cause of the motherless,\r\nfatherless, and homeless Colored children of this community. She\r\nattracted the attention and won the confidence of the few\r\nAbolitionists of this city. She determined to establish a home for\r\nthese little wanderers, and immediately set to work at a plan. The\r\nlate Salmon P. Chase was then quite young, a man of brilliant\r\nabilities and of anti-slavery sentiments. He joined himself to the\r\nhumane movement of Lydia P. Mott, with the following persons:\r\nChristian Donaldson, James Pullan, William Donaldson, Robert Buchanan,\r\nJohn Liverpool, Richard Phillips, John Woodson, Charles Satchell, Wm.\r\nW. Watson, William Darnes, Michael Clark, A. M. Sumner, Reuben P.\r\nGraham, Louis P. Brux, Sarah B. McLain, Mrs. Eustis, Mrs. Dr. Stanton,\r\nMrs. Hannah Cooper, Mrs. Mary Jane Gordon, Mrs. Susan Miller, Mrs.\r\nRebecca Darnes, Mrs. Charlotte Armstrong, Mrs. Eliza Clark, Mrs. Ruth\r\nEllen Watson, and others. Six of the gentlemen and four of the ladies\r\nwere white. Only six of this noble company are living at this time.\r\n\r\nThe organization was effected in 1844, and the act of incorporation\r\nwas drawn up by Salmon P. Chase. It was chartered in February, 1845,\r\nthe passage of the act having been assured through the personal\r\ninfluence of Mr. Chase upon the members of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe first Board of Trustees under the charter were William Donaldson,\r\nJohn Woodson, Richard Phillips, Christian Donaldson, Reuben P. Graham,\r\nRichard Pullan, Charles Satchell, Louis P. Brux, and John Liverpool.\r\nBut one is alive--Richard Pullan.\r\n\r\nThe first building the Trustees secured as an asylum was on Ninth\r\nStreet, between Plum and Elm. They paid a rental of $12.50 per month.\r\nThe building was owned by Mr. Nicholas Longworth, but the ground was\r\nleased by him from Judge Burnet. The Trustees ultimately purchased the\r\nbuilding for $1,500; and in 1851 the ground also was purchased of Mr.\r\nGroesbeck for $4,400 in cash.\r\n\r\nDuring the three or four years following, the institution had quite an\r\nindifferent career. The money requisite to run it was not forthcoming.\r\nThe children were poorly fed and clothed, and many times there was no\r\nmoney in the treasury at all. The Trustees were discouraged, and it\r\nseemed that the asylum would have to be closed. But just at this time\r\nthat venerable Abolitionist and underground railroader, Levi Coffin,\r\nwith his excellent wife, \"Aunt Kitty,\" came to the rescue. He took\r\ncharge of the institution as superintendent, and his wife assumed the\r\nduties of matron. Through their exertions and adroit management they\r\nsucceeded in enlisting the sympathy of many benevolent folk, and\r\nsecured the support of many true friends.\r\n\r\nIt was now 1866. The asylum building presented a forlorn aspect. It\r\nwas far from being a comfortable shelter for the children. But a lack\r\nof funds forbade the Trustees from having it repaired. They began to\r\nlook about for a more desirable and comfortable building. During the\r\nclosing year of the Rebellion a large number of freedmen sought the\r\nshelter of our large Northern cities. Cincinnati received her share of\r\nthem, and acted nobly toward them. The government authorities built a\r\nhospital for freedmen in a very desirable locality in Avondale. At\r\nthis time (1866), the building, which was very capacious, was not\r\noccupied. The Trustees secured a change in the charter, permitting\r\nthem, by consent of the subscribers, to sell the Ninth Street\r\nproperty, and purchase the hospital building and the accompanying six\r\nacres in Avondale. The Ninth Street property brought $9,000; the\r\npurchase in Avondale, refitting, etc., cost $11,000, incurring a debt\r\nof $2,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the first twenty-two years of the institution much good was\r\naccomplished. Hundreds of children--orphans and friendless\r\nchildren--found shelter in the asylum, which existed only through the\r\nalmost superhuman efforts of the intelligent Colored persons in the\r\ncommunity, and the unstinted charity of many generous white persons.\r\nThe asylum has been pervaded with a healthy religious atmosphere; and\r\nmany of its inmates have gone forth to the world giving large promise\r\nof usefulness. An occasional letter from former inmates often proves\r\nthat much good has been done; and that some of these children, without\r\nthe kindly influence and care of the asylum, instead of occupying\r\nplaces of usefulness and trust in society, might have drifted into\r\nvagrancy and crime.\r\n\r\nAmidst the struggle for temporal welfare, the Colored people of\r\nCincinnati were not unmindful of the interests and destinies of the\r\nUnion. A military company was formed, bearing the name of _Attucks\r\nGuards_. On the 25th of July, 1855, an association of ladies presented\r\na flag to the company. The address, on the part of the ladies, was\r\ndelivered by Miss Mary A. Darnes. Among many excellent things, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"Should the love of liberty and your country ever demand your\r\n     services, may you, in imitation of that noble patriot whose name\r\n     you bear, promptly respond to the call, and fight to the last\r\n     for the great and noble principles of liberty and justice, to the\r\n     glory of your fathers and the land of your birth.\r\n\r\n     \"The time is not far distant when the _slave must be free_; if\r\n     not by moral and intellectual means, it must be done by the\r\n     sword. Remember, gentlemen, should duty call, it will be yours to\r\n     obey, and strike to the last for freedom or the grave.\r\n\r\n     \"But God forbid that you should be called upon to witness our\r\n     peaceful homes involved in war. May our eyes never behold this\r\n     flag in any conflict; let the quiet breeze ever play among its\r\n     folds, and the fullest peace dwell among you!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the great majority of the Colored people in the country were\r\nbowing themselves cheerfully to the dreadful task of living among\r\nwolves, some of the race were willing to brave the perils of the sea,\r\nand find a new home on the West Coast of Africa. Between the years of\r\n1850-1856, 9,502 Negroes went to Liberia, of whom 3,676 had been born\r\nfree. In 1850, there were 1,467 manumitted, while 1,011 ran away from\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many disadvantages under which the free Negroes of\r\nthe North had to labor, they accomplished a great deal. In an\r\nincredibly short time they built schools, planted churches,\r\nestablished newspapers; had their representatives in law, medicine,\r\nand theology before the world as the marvel of the centuries. Shut out\r\nfrom every influence calculated to incite them to a higher life, and\r\nprovoke them to better works, nevertheless, the Colored people were\r\nenabled to live down much prejudice, and gained the support and\r\nsympathy of noble men and women of the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] This is inserted in this volume as the more appropriate place.\r\n\r\n[56] Slavery in Massachusetts, pp. 228, 229.\r\n\r\n[57] Massachusetts Mercury, vol. xvi.

Whips, thumbscrews, and manacles of\r\niron were far less helpful to it than the thraldom of the intellects\r\nof its hapless victims. \"Created a little lower than the angels,\"\r\n\"crowned with glory and honor,\" armed with authority \"over every\r\nliving creature,\" man was intended by his Maker to rule the world\r\nthrough his intellect. The homogeneousness of the crude faculties of\r\nman has been quite generally admitted throughout the world; while even\r\nscientists, differing widely in many other things, have united in\r\nascribing to the human mind everywhere certain possibilities. But one\r\nclass of men have dissented from this view--the slave-holders of all\r\nages. A justification of slavery has been sought in the alleged belief\r\nof the inferiority of the persons enslaved; while the broad truism of\r\nthe possibilities of the human mind was confessed in all legislation\r\nthat sought to prevent slaves from acquiring knowledge. So the\r\nslave-holder asserted his belief in the mental inferiority of the\r\nNegro, and then advertised his lack of faith in his assertion by\r\nmaking laws to prevent the Negro intellect from receiving those truths\r\nwhich would render him valueless as a slave, but equal to the duties\r\nof a freeman.\r\n\r\n\r\nALABAMA\r\n\r\nhad an act in 1832 which declared that \"Any person or persons who\r\nshall attempt to teach any free person of color or slave to spell,\r\nread, or write, shall, upon conviction thereof by indictment, be fined\r\nin a sum not less than $250, nor more than $500.\" This act also\r\nprohibited with severe penalties, by flogging, \"any free negro or\r\nperson of color\" from being in company with any slaves without written\r\npermission from the owner or overseer of such slaves; it also\r\nprohibited the assembling of more than five male slaves at any place\r\noff the plantation to which they belonged; but nothing in the act was\r\nto be considered as forbidding attendance at places of public worship\r\nheld by white persons. No slave or free person of color was permitted\r\nto \"preach, exhort, or harangue any slave or slaves, or free persons\r\nof color, except in the presence of five respectable slave-holders, or\r\nunless the person preaching was licensed by some regular body of\r\nprofessing Christians in the neighborhood, to whose society or church\r\nthe negroes addressed properly belonged.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833, the mayor and aldermen of the city of Mobile were authorized\r\nby an act of the Legislature to grant licenses to such persons as they\r\ndeemed suitable to give instruction to the children of free Colored\r\nCreoles. This applied only to those who resided in the city of Mobile\r\nand county of Baldwin. The instruction was to be given at brief\r\nperiods, and the children had to secure a certificate from the mayor\r\nand aldermen. The ground of this action was the treaty between France\r\nand the United States in 1803, by which the rights and privileges of\r\ncitizens had been secured to the Creoles residing in the above places\r\nat the time of the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nARKANSAS,\r\n\r\nso far as her laws appear, did not prohibit the education of Negroes;\r\nbut a study of her laws leaves the impression that the Negroes there\r\nwere practically denied the right of instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT\r\n\r\nnever legislated against educating Colored persons, but the prejudice\r\nwas so strong that it amounted to the same thing. The intolerant\r\nspirit of the whites drove the Colored people of Hartford to request a\r\nseparate school in 1830. Prejudice was so great against the presence\r\nof a Colored school in a community of white people, that a school,\r\nestablished by a very worthy white lady, was mobbed and then\r\nlegislated out of existence.\r\n\r\n     \"In the summer of 1832, Miss Prudence Crandall, an excellent,\r\n     well-educated Quaker young lady, who had gained considerable\r\n     reputation as a teacher in the neighboring town of Plainfield,\r\n     purchased, at the solicitation of a number of families in the\r\n     village of Canterbury, Connecticut, a commodious house in that\r\n     village, for the purpose of establishing a boarding and day\r\n     school for young ladies, in order that they might receive\r\n     instruction in higher branches than were taught in the public\r\n     district school. Her school was well conducted, but was\r\n     interrupted early in 1833 in this wise: Not far from the village\r\n     a worthy colored man was living, by the name of Harris, the owner\r\n     of a good farm, and in comfortable circumstances. His daughter\r\n     Sarah, a bright girl, seventeen years of age, had passed with\r\n     credit through the public school of the district in which she\r\n     lived, and was anxious to acquire a better education, to qualify\r\n     herself to become a teacher of the colored people. She applied to\r\n     Miss Crandall for admission to her school. Miss Crandall\r\n     hesitated, for prudential reasons, to admit a colored person\r\n     among her pupils; but Sarah was a young lady of pleasing\r\n     appearance and manners, well known to many of Miss Crandall's\r\n     present pupils, having been their classmate in the district\r\n     school, and was, moreover, a virtuous, pious girl, and a member\r\n     of the church in Canterbury. No objection could be made to her\r\n     admission, except on acount of her complexion, and Miss Crandall\r\n     decided to receive her as a pupil. No objection was made by the\r\n     other pupils, but in a few days the parents of some of them\r\n     called on Miss Crandall and remonstrated; and although Miss\r\n     Crandall pressed upon their consideration the eager desire of\r\n     Sarah for knowledge and culture, and the good use she wished to\r\n     make of her education, her excellent character, and her being an\r\n     accepted member of the same Christian church to which they\r\n     belonged, they were too much prejudiced to listen to any\r\n     arguments--'they would not have it said that their daughters went\r\n     to school with a nigger girl.' It was urged that if Sarah was not\r\n     dismissed, the white pupils would be withdrawn; but although the\r\n     fond hopes of success for an institution which she had\r\n     established at the risk of all her property, and by incurring a\r\n     debt of several hundred dollars, seemed to be doomed to\r\n     disappointment, she decided not to yield to the demand for the\r\n     dismissal of Sarah; and on the 2d day of March, 1833, she\r\n     advertised in the 'Liberator' that on the first Monday in April\r\n     her school would be open for 'young ladies and little misses of\r\n     color.' Her determination having become known, a fierce\r\n     indignation was kindled and fanned by prominent people of the\r\n     village and pervaded the town. In this juncture, the Rev. Samuel\r\n     J. May, of the neighboring town of Brooklyn, addressed her a\r\n     letter of sympathy, expressing his readiness to assist her to the\r\n     extent of his power, and was present at the town meeting held on\r\n     the 9th of March, called for the express purpose of devising and\r\n     adopting such measures as 'would effectually avert the nuisance\r\n     or speedily abate it if it should be brought into the village.'\r\n\r\n     \"The friends of Miss Crandall were authorized by her to state to\r\n     the moderator of the town meeting that she would give up her\r\n     house, which was one of the most conspicuous in the village, and\r\n     not wholly paid for, if those who were opposed to her school\r\n     being there would take the property off her hands at the price\r\n     for which she had purchased it, and which was deemed a reasonable\r\n     one, and allow her time to procure another house in a more\r\n     retired part of the town.\r\n\r\n     \"The town meeting was held in the meeting-house, which, though\r\n     capable of holding a thousand people, was crowded throughout to\r\n     its utmost capacity. After the warning for the meeting had been\r\n     read, resolutions were introduced in which were set forth the\r\n     disgrace and damage that would be brought upon the town if a\r\n     school for colored girls should be set up there, protesting\r\n     emphatically against the impending evil, and appointing the civil\r\n     authority and select-men a committee to wait upon 'the person\r\n     contemplating the establishment of said school, and persuade her,\r\n     if possible, to abandon the project.'\r\n\r\n     \"The resolutions were advocated by Rufus Adams, Esq., and Hon.\r\n     Andrew T. Judson, who was then the most prominent man of the\r\n     town, and a leading politician in the State, and much talked of\r\n     as the Democratic candidate for governor, and was a\r\n     representative in Congress from 1835 to 1839, when he was elected\r\n     judge of the United States District Court, which position he held\r\n     until his death in 1853, adjudicating, among other causes, the\r\n     libel of the 'Amistad' and the fifty-four Africans on board.\r\n     After his address on this occasion, Mr. May, in company with Mr.\r\n     Arnold Buffum, a lecturing agent of the New England Anti-Slavery\r\n     Society, applied for permission to speak in behalf of Miss\r\n     Crandall, but their application was violently opposed, and the\r\n     resolutions being adopted, the meeting was declared, by the\r\n     moderator, adjourned.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. May at once stepped upon the seat where he had been sitting,\r\n     and rapidly vindicated Miss Crandall, replying to some of the\r\n     misstatements as to her purposes and the character of her\r\n     expected pupils, when he gave way to Mr. Buffum, who had spoken\r\n     scarcely five minutes before the trustees of the church ordered\r\n     the house to be vacated and the doors to be shut. There was then\r\n     no alternative but to yield.\r\n\r\n     \"Two days afterward Mr. Judson called on Mr. May, with whom he\r\n     had been on terms of a pleasant acquaintance, not to say of\r\n     friendship, and expressed regret that he had applied certain\r\n     epithets to him; and went on to speak of the disastrous effect on\r\n     the village from the establishment of 'a school for nigger\r\n     girls.' Mr. May replied that his purpose was, if he had been\r\n     allowed to do so, to state at the town meeting Miss Crandall's\r\n     proposition to sell her house in the village at its fair\r\n     valuation, and retire to some other part of the town. To this Mr.\r\n     Judson replied: 'Mr. May, we are not merely opposed to the\r\n     establishment of that school in Canterbury, we mean there shall\r\n     not be such a school set up anywhere in the State.'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Judson continued, declaring that the colored people could\r\n     never rise from their menial condition in our country, and ought\r\n     not to be permitted to rise here; that they were an inferior race\r\n     and should not be recognized as the equals of the whites; that\r\n     they should be sent back to Africa, and improve themselves there,\r\n     and civilize and Christianize the natives. To this Mr. May\r\n     replied that there never would be fewer colored people in this\r\n     country than there were then; that it was unjust to drive them\r\n     out of the country; that we must accord to them their rights or\r\n     incur the loss of our own; that education was the primal,\r\n     fundamental right of all the children of men; and that\r\n     Connecticut was the last place where this should be denied.\r\n\r\n     \"The conversation was continued in a similar strain, in the\r\n     course of which Mr. Judson declared with warmth: 'That nigger\r\n     school shall never be allowed in Canterbury, nor in any town of\r\n     this State'; and he avowed his determination to secure the\r\n     passage of a law by the Legislature then in session, forbidding\r\n     the institution of such a school in any part of the State.\r\n\r\n     \"Undismayed by the opposition and the threatened violence of her\r\n     neighbors, Miss Crandall received, early in April, fifteen or\r\n     twenty colored young ladies and misses from Philadelphia, New\r\n     York, Providence, and Boston, and the annoyances of her\r\n     persecutors at once commenced: all accommodations at the stores\r\n     in Canterbury being denied her, her pupils being insulted\r\n     whenever they appeared on the streets, the doors and door-steps\r\n     of her house being besmeared, and her well filled with filth;\r\n     under all of which, both she and her pupils remained firm. Among\r\n     other means used to intimidate, an attempt was made to drive away\r\n     those innocent girls by a process under the obsolete vagrant law,\r\n     which provided that the select-men of any town might warn any\r\n     person, not an inhabitant of the State, to depart forthwith,\r\n     demanding $1.67 for every week he or she remained after receiving\r\n     such warning; and in case the fine was not paid and the person\r\n     did not depart before the expiration of ten days after being\r\n     sentenced, _then he or she should be whipped on the naked body,\r\n     not exceeding ten stripes_.\r\n\r\n     \"A warrant to that effect was actually served upon Eliza Ann\r\n     Hammond, a fine girl from Providence, aged seventeen years; but\r\n     it was finally abandoned, and another method was resorted to,\r\n     most disgraceful to the State as well as the town. Foiled in\r\n     their attempts to frighten away Miss Crandall's pupils by their\r\n     proceedings under the obsolete 'pauper and vagrant law,' Mr.\r\n     Judson and those who acted with him pressed upon the Legislature,\r\n     then in session, a demand for the enactment of a law which should\r\n     enable them to accomplish their purpose; and in that bad purpose\r\n     they succeeded, by securing the following enactment, on the 24th\r\n     of May, 1833, known as the '_black law_.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Whereas, attempts have been made to establish literary\r\n     institutions in this State for the instruction of colored persons\r\n     belonging to other States and countries, which would tend to the\r\n     great increase of the colored population of the State, and\r\n     thereby to the injury of the people: therefore,\r\n\r\n     \"'_Be it enacted, etc._, That no person shall set up or establish\r\n     in this State any school, academy, or other literary institution\r\n     for the instruction or education of colored persons, who are not\r\n     inhabitants of this State, or harbor or board, for the purpose of\r\n     attending or being taught or instructed in any such school,\r\n     academy, or literary institution, any colored person who is not\r\n     an inhabitant of any town in this State, without the consent in\r\n     writing, first obtained, of a majority of the civil authority,\r\n     and also of the select-men of the town in which such school,\r\n     academy, or literary institution is situated,' etc.\r\n\r\n     \"'And each and every person who shall knowingly do any act\r\n     forbidden as aforesaid, or shall be aiding or assisting therein,\r\n     shall for the first offense forfeit and pay to the treasurer of\r\n     this State a fine of $100, and for the second offense $200, and\r\n     so double for every offense of which he or she shall be\r\n     convicted; and all informing officers are required to make due\r\n     presentment of all breaches of this act.'\r\n\r\n     \"On the receipt of the tidings of the passage of this law, the\r\n     people of Canterbury were wild with exultation; the bells were\r\n     rung and a cannon was fired to manifest the joy. On the 27th of\r\n     June, Miss Crandall was arrested and arraigned before Justices\r\n     Adams and Bacon, two of those who had been the earnest opponents\r\n     of her enterprise; and the result being predetermined, the trial\r\n     was of course brief, and Miss Crandall was 'committed' to take\r\n     her trial at the next session of the Supreme Court at Brooklyn,\r\n     in August. A messenger was at once dispatched by the party\r\n     opposed to Miss Crandall to Brooklyn, to inform Mr. May, as her\r\n     friend, of the result of the trial, stating that she was in the\r\n     hands of the sheriff, and would be put in jail unless he or some\r\n     of her friends would 'give bonds' for her in a certain sum.\"\r\n\r\nThe denouement may be related most appropriately in the language of\r\nMr. May:\r\n\r\n     \"I calmly told the messenger that there were gentlemen enough in\r\n     Canterbury whose bond for that amount would be as good or better\r\n     than mine, and I should leave it for them to do Miss Crandall\r\n     that favor. 'But,' said the young man, 'are you not her friend?'\r\n     'Certainly,' I replied, 'too sincerely her friend to give relief\r\n     to her enemies in their present embarrassment, and I trust you\r\n     will not find any one of her friends, or the patrons of her\r\n     school, who will step forward to help them any more than myself.'\r\n     'But, sir,' he cried, 'do you mean to allow her to be put in\r\n     jail?' 'Most certainly,' was my answer, 'if her persecutors are\r\n     unwise enough to let such an outrage be committed.' He turned\r\n     from me in blank surprise, and hurried back to tell Mr. Judson\r\n     and the justices of his ill success.\r\n\r\n     \"A few days before, when I first heard of the passage of the law,\r\n     I had visited Miss Crandall with my friend, Mr. George W. Benson,\r\n     and advised with her as to the course she and her friends ought\r\n     to pursue when she should be brought to trial. She appreciated at\r\n     once and fully the importance of leaving her persecutors to show\r\n     to the world how base they were, and how atrocious was the law\r\n     they had induced the Legislature to enact--a law, by the force of\r\n     which a woman might be fined and imprisoned as a felon in the\r\n     State of Connecticut for giving instruction to colored girls. She\r\n     agreed that it would be best for us to leave her in the hands of\r\n     those with whom the law originated, hoping that, in their\r\n     madness, they would show forth all their hideous features.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Benson and I, therefore, went diligently around to all who\r\n     he knew were friendly to Miss Crandall and her school, and\r\n     counselled them by no means to give bonds to keep her from\r\n     imprisonment, because nothing would expose so fully to the public\r\n     the egregious wickedness of the law and the virulence of her\r\n     persecutors as the fact that they had thrust her into jail.\r\n\r\n     \"When I found that her resolution was equal to the trial which\r\n     seemed to be impending, that she was ready to brave and to bear\r\n     meekly the worst treatment that her enemies would venture to\r\n     subject her to, I made all the arrangements for her comfort that\r\n     were practicable in our prison. It fortunately happened that the\r\n     most suitable room, unoccupied, was the one in which a man named\r\n     Watkins had recently been confined for the murder of his wife,\r\n     and out of which he had been taken and executed. This\r\n     circumstance we foresaw would add not a little to the public\r\n     detestation of the _black law_. The jailer, at my request,\r\n     readily put the room in as nice order as was possible, and\r\n     permitted me to substitute for the bedstead and mattrass on which\r\n     the murderer had slept, fresh and clean ones from my own house\r\n     and Mr. Benson's.\r\n\r\n     \"About 2 o'clock, P.M., another messenger came to inform me that\r\n     the sheriff was on the way from Canterbury to the jail with Miss\r\n     Crandall, and would imprison her unless her friends would give\r\n     the required bail. Although in sympathy with Miss Crandall's\r\n     persecutors, he saw clearly the disgrace that was about to be\r\n     brought upon the State, and begged me and Mr. Benson to avert it.\r\n     Of course we refused. I went to the jailer's house and met Miss\r\n     Crandall on her arrival. We stepped aside. I said: 'If now you\r\n     hesitate--if you dread the gloomy place so much as to wish to be\r\n     saved from it, I will give bonds for you even now.' 'Oh, no,' she\r\n     promptly replied, 'I am only afraid they will not put me in jail.\r\n     Their evident hesitation and embarrassment show plainly how much\r\n     they deprecated the effect of this part of their folly, and\r\n     therefore I am the more anxious that they should be exposed, if\r\n     not caught in their own wicked devices.\r\n\r\n     \"We therefore returned with her to the sheriff and the company\r\n     that surrounded him, to await his final act. He was ashamed to do\r\n     it. He knew it would cover the persecutors of Miss Crandall and\r\n     the State of Connecticut with disgrace. He conferred with several\r\n     about him, and delayed yet longer. Two gentlemen came and\r\n     remonstrated with me in not very seemly terms: 'It would be a\r\n     ---- shame, an eternal disgrace to the State, to have her put\r\n     into jail--into the very room that Watkins had last occupied.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Certainly, gentlemen,' I replied, 'and this you may prevent if\r\n     you please.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh!' they cried, 'we are not her friends; we are not in favor\r\n     of her school; we don't want any more ---- niggers coming among\r\n     us. It is your place to stand by Miss Crandall and help her now.\r\n     You and your ---- abolition brethren have encouraged her to\r\n     bring this nuisance into Canterbury, and it is ---- mean in you\r\n     to desert her now.'\r\n\r\n     \"I rejoined: 'She knows we have not deserted her, and do not\r\n     intend to desert her. The law which her persecutors have\r\n     persuaded our legislators to enact is an infamous one, worthy of\r\n     the dark ages. It would be just as bad as it is whether we would\r\n     give bonds for her or not. But the people generally will not so\r\n     soon realize how bad, how wicked, how cruel a law it is unless we\r\n     suffer her persecutors to inflict upon her all the penalties it\r\n     prescribes. She is willing to bear them for the sake of the cause\r\n     she has so nobly espoused. If you see fit to keep her from\r\n     imprisonment in the cell of a murderer for having proffered the\r\n     blessings of a good education to those who in our country need it\r\n     most, you may do so; _we shall not_.'\r\n\r\n     \"They turned from us in great wrath, words falling from their\r\n     lips which I shall not repeat.\r\n\r\n     \"The sun had descended nearly to the horizon; the shadows of\r\n     night were beginning to fall around us. The sheriff could defer\r\n     the dark deed no longer. With no little emotion, and with words\r\n     of earnest deprecation, he gave that excellent, heroic, Christian\r\n     young lady into the hands of the jailer, and she was led into the\r\n     cell of Watkins. So soon as I had heard the bolts of her prison\r\n     door turned in the lock, and saw the key taken out, I bowed and\r\n     said: 'The deed is done, completely done. It cannot be recalled.\r\n     It has passed into the history of our nation and our age.' I went\r\n     away with my steadfast friend, George W. Benson, assured that the\r\n     legislators of the State had been guilty of a most unrighteous\r\n     act, and that Miss Crandall's persecutors had also committed a\r\n     great blunder; that they all would have much more reason to be\r\n     ashamed of her imprisonment than she or her friends could ever\r\n     have.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day we gave the required bonds. Miss Crandall was\r\n     released from the cell of the murderer, returned home, and\r\n     quietly resumed the duties of her school until she should be\r\n     summoned as a culprit into court, there to be tried by the\r\n     infamous '_Black Law of Connecticut_.' And, as we expected, so\r\n     soon as the evil tidings could be carried in that day, before\r\n     Professor Morse had given to Rumor her telegraphic wings, it was\r\n     known all over the country and the civilized world, that an\r\n     excellent young lady had been imprisoned as a criminal--yes, put\r\n     into a murderer's cell--in the State of Connecticut, for opening\r\n     a school for the instruction of colored girls. The comments that\r\n     were made upon the deed in almost all the newspapers were far\r\n     from grateful to the feelings of her persecutors. Even many who,\r\n     under the same circumstances, would probably have acted as badly\r\n     as Messrs. A. T. Judson & Co., denounced their procedure as\r\n     'un-Christian, inhuman, anti-Democratic, base, mean.'\r\n\r\n     \"On the 23d of August, 1833, the first trial of Miss Crandall\r\n     was had in Brooklyn, the seat of the county of Windham, Hon.\r\n     Joseph Eaton presiding at the county court.\r\n\r\n     \"The prosecution was conducted by Hon. A. T. Judson, Jonathan A.\r\n     Welch, Esq., and I. Bulkley, Esq. Miss Crandall's counsel was\r\n     Hon. Calvin Goddard, Hon. W. W. Elsworth, and Henry Strong, Esq.\r\n\r\n     \"The judge, somewhat timidly, gave it as his opinion 'that the\r\n     law was constitutional and obligatory on the people of the\r\n     State.'\r\n\r\n     \"The jury, after an absence of several hours, returned into\r\n     court, not having agreed upon a verdict. They were instructed and\r\n     sent out again, and again a third time, in vain; they stated to\r\n     the judge that there was no probability that they could ever\r\n     agree. Seven were for conviction and five for acquittal, so they\r\n     were discharged.\r\n\r\n     \"The second trial was on the 3d of October, before Judge Daggett\r\n     of the Supreme Court, who was a strenuous advocate of the black\r\n     law. His influence with the jury was overpowering, insisting in\r\n     an elaborate and able charge that the law was constitutional,\r\n     and, without much hesitation, the verdict was given against Miss\r\n     Crandall. Her counsel at once filed a bill of exceptions, and\r\n     took an appeal to the Court of Errors, which was granted. Before\r\n     that, the highest legal tribunal in the State, the cause was\r\n     argued on the 22d of July, 1834. Both the Hon. W. W. Elsworth and\r\n     the Hon. Calvin Goddard argued with great ability and eloquence\r\n     against the constitutionality of the black law. The Hon. A. T.\r\n     Judson and Hon. C. F. Cleaveland said all they could to prove\r\n     such a law consistent with the _Magna Charta_ of our republic.\r\n     The court reserved a decision for some future time; and that\r\n     decision was never given, it being evaded by the court finding\r\n     such defects in the information prepared by the State's attorney\r\n     that it ought to be quashed.\r\n\r\n     \"Soon after this, an attempt was made to set the house of Miss\r\n     Crandall on fire, but without effect. The question of her duty to\r\n     risk the lives of her pupils against this mode of attack was then\r\n     considered, and upon consultation with friends it was concluded\r\n     to hold on and bear a little longer, with the hope that this\r\n     atrocity of attempting to fire the house, and thus expose the\r\n     lives and property of her neighbors, would frighten the\r\n     instigators of the persecution, and cause some restraint on the\r\n     'baser sort.' But a few nights afterward, about 12 o'clock, being\r\n     the night of the 9th of September, her house was assaulted by a\r\n     number of persons with heavy clubs and iron bars, and windows\r\n     were dashed to pieces. Mr. May was summoned the next morning, and\r\n     after consultation it was determined that the school should be\r\n     abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nMr. May thus concluded his account of this event, and of the\r\nenterprise:\r\n\r\n     \"The pupils were called together and I was requested to announce\r\n     to them our decision. Never before had I felt so deeply sensible\r\n     of the cruelty of the persecution which had been carried on for\r\n     eighteen months in that New England village, against a family of\r\n     defenseless females. Twenty harmless, well-behaved girls, whose\r\n     only offense against the peace of the community was that they had\r\n     come together there to obtain useful knowledge and moral culture,\r\n     were to be told that they had better go away, because, forsooth,\r\n     the house in which they dwelt would not be protected by the\r\n     guardians of the town, the conservators of the peace, the\r\n     officers of justice, the men of influence in the village where it\r\n     was situated. The words almost blistered my lips. My bosom glowed\r\n     with indignation. I felt ashamed of Canterbury, ashamed of\r\n     Connecticut, ashamed of my country, ashamed of my color.\"[58]\r\n\r\nThus ended the generous, disinterested, philanthropic Christian\r\nenterprise of Prudence Crandall, but the law under which her\r\nenterprise was defeated was repealed in 1838.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Connecticut earned such an unenviable place\r\nin history as this. It seems strange, indeed, that such an occurrence\r\ncould take place in the nineteenth century in a free State in a\r\nrepublic in North America! But such is \"the truth of history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE\r\n\r\nnever passed any law against the instruction of Negroes, but in 1833\r\npassed an act taxing every person who sold a slave out of the State,\r\nor brought one into the State, five dollars, which went into a school\r\nfund for the education of _white children alone_. In 1852, the Revised\r\nStatutes provided for the taxation of all the property of the State\r\nfor the support of the schools for _white children_ alone. So, by\r\nimplication, Delaware prohibited the education of Colored children.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the Friends formed the African School Association in\r\nWilmington; and under its management two excellent schools, for boys\r\nand girls, were established.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of December, 1848, an act was passed providing \"for the\r\nestablishment of common schools.\" The right to vote at district\r\nmeetings was conferred upon every person whose property was liable to\r\ntaxation for school purposes; but only white children were allowed\r\nschool privileges.\r\n\r\nIn the same year an act was passed providing that the school funds\r\nshould consist of \"the proceeds of the school lands,\" and of all\r\nestates, real or personal, escheating to the State, and \"the proceeds\r\nof all property found on the coast or shores of the State.\" In 1850\r\nthe counties were authorized to provide, by taxation, not more than\r\nfour dollars for each child within their limits of the proper school\r\nage. In the same year the amount received from the sale of any slave,\r\nunder the act of 1829, was required to be added to the school fund.\r\nThe common school law was revised in 1853, and the county\r\ncommissioners were authorized to add from the county treasury any sum\r\nthey thought proper for the support of common schools.[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIA\r\n\r\npassed a law in 1770 (copied from S. C. Statutes, passed in 1740),\r\nfixing a fine of £20 for teaching a slave to read or write. In 1829\r\nthe Legislature enacted the following law:\r\n\r\n     \"If any slave, negro, or free person of color, or any white\r\n     person, shall teach any other slave, negro, or free person of\r\n     color to read or write either written or printed characters, the\r\n     said free person of color or slave shall be punished by fine and\r\n     whipping, or fine or whipping, at the discretion of the court;\r\n     and if a white person so offend, he, she, or they shall be\r\n     punished with a fine not exceeding $500, and imprisonment in the\r\n     common jail at the discretion of the court.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the above law was consolidated into a penal code. A penalty of\r\n$100 was provided against persons who employed any slave or free\r\nperson of Color to set type or perform any other labor about a\r\nprinting-office requiring a knowledge of reading or writing. During\r\nthe same year an ordinance was passed in the city of Savannah, \"that\r\nif any person shall teach or cause to be taught any slave or free\r\nperson of color to read or write within the city, or who shall keep a\r\nschool for that purpose, he or she shall be fined in a sum not\r\nexceeding $100 for each and every such offense; and if the offender be\r\na slave or free person of color, he or she may also be whipped, not\r\nexceeding thirty-nine lashes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1850 a series of articles by Mr. F. C. Adams appeared\r\nin one of the papers of Savannah, advocating the education of the\r\nNegroes as a means of increasing their value and of attaching them to\r\ntheir masters. The subject was afterward taken up in the Agricultural\r\nConvention which met at Macon in September of the same year. The\r\nmatter was again brought up in September, 1851, in the Agricultural\r\nConvention, and after being debated, a resolution was passed that a\r\npetition be presented to the Legislature for a law granting permission\r\nto educate the slaves. The petition was presented to the Legislature,\r\nand Mr. Harlston introduced a bill in the winter of 1852, which was\r\ndiscussed and passed in the lower House, to repeal the old law, and to\r\ngrant to the masters the privilege of educating their slaves. The bill\r\nwas lost in the senate by two or three votes.[60]\r\n\r\nILLINOIS'\r\n\r\nschool laws contain the word \"white\" from beginning to end. There is\r\nno prohibition against the education of Colored persons; but there\r\nbeing no mention of them, is evidence that they were purposely\r\nomitted. Separate schools were established for Colored children before\r\nthe war, and a few white schools opened their doors to them. The Free\r\nMission Institute at Quincy was destroyed by a mob from Missouri in\r\n_ante-bellum_ days, because Colored persons were admitted to the\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA\r\n\r\ndenied the right of suffrage to her Negro population in the\r\nconstitution of 1851. No provision was made for the education of the\r\nNegro children. And the cruelty of the laws that drove the Negro from\r\nthe State, and pursued him while in it, gave the poor people no hope\r\nof peaceful habitation, much less of education.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY\r\n\r\nnever put herself on record against the education of Negroes. By an\r\nact passed in 1830, all the inhabitants of each school district were\r\ntaxed to support a common-school system. The property of Colored\r\npersons was included, but they could not vote or enjoy the privileges\r\nof the schools. And the slave laws were so numerous and cruel that\r\nthere was no opportunity left the bondmen in this State to acquire any\r\nknowledge of books even secretly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA\r\n\r\npassed an act in 1830, forbidding free Negroes to enter the State. It\r\nprovided also, that whoever should \"write, print, publish, or\r\ndistribute any thing having a tendency to produce discontent among the\r\nfree colored population, or insubordination among the slaves,\" should,\r\non conviction thereof, be imprisoned \"_at hard labor for life, or\r\nsuffer death_, at the discretion of the court.\" And whoever used\r\nlanguage calculated to produce discontent among the free or slave\r\npopulation, or was \"instrumental in bringing into the State any paper,\r\nbook, or pamphlet having such tendency,\" was to \"suffer imprisonment\r\nat hard labor, not less than three years nor more than twenty-one\r\nyears, or death, at the discretion of the court.\" \"All persons,\"\r\ncontinues the act, \"who shall teach, or permit, or cause to be taught,\r\nany slave to read or write, shall be imprisoned not less than one\r\nmonth nor more than twelve months.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847, a system of common schools for \"the education of white youth\r\nwas established.\" It was provided that \"one mill on the dollar, upon\r\nthe _ad valorem_ amount of the general list of taxable property,\"\r\nshould be levied for the support of the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE\r\n\r\ngave the elective franchise and ample school privileges to all her\r\ncitizens, without regard to race or color, by her constitution of\r\n1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYLAND\r\n\r\nalways restricted the right of suffrage to her \"white male\r\ninhabitants,\" and, therefore, always refused to make any provisions\r\nfor the education of her Negro population. There is nothing upon her\r\nstatute-books prohibiting the instruction of Negroes, but the law that\r\ndesignates her schools for \"white children\" is sufficient proof that\r\nNegro children were purposely omitted and excluded from the benefits\r\nof the schools.\r\n\r\nSt. Frances Academy for Colored girls was founded in connection with\r\nthe Oblate Sisters of Providence Convent, in Baltimore, June 5, 1829,\r\nunder the hearty approbation of the Most Rev. James Whitfield, D.D.,\r\nthe Archbishop of Baltimore at that time, and receiving the sanction\r\nof the Holy See, October 2, 1831. The convent originated with the\r\nFrench Fathers, who came to Baltimore from San Domingo as refugees, in\r\nthe time of the revolution in that island in the latter years of last\r\ncentury. There were many Colored Catholic refugees who came to\r\nBaltimore during that period, and the French Fathers soon opened\r\nschools there for the benefit of the refugees and other Colored\r\npeople. The Colored women who formed the original society which\r\nfounded the convent and seminary, were from San Domingo; though they\r\nhad, some of them, certainly, been educated in France. The schools\r\nwhich preceded the organization of the convent were greatly favored\r\nby. Most Rev. Ambrose Marechal, D.D., who was a French Father, and\r\nArchbishop of Baltimore from 1817 to 1828, Archbishop Whitfield being\r\nhis successor. The Sisters of Providence is the name of a religious\r\nsociety of Colored women who renounced the world to consecrate\r\nthemselves to the Christian education of Colored girls. The following\r\nextract from the announcement which, under the caption of \"Prospectus\r\nof a School for Colored Girls under the Direction of the Sisters of\r\nProvidence,\" appeared in the columns of the \"Daily National\r\nIntelligencer,\" October 25, 1831, shows the spirit in which the school\r\noriginated, and at the same time shadows forth the predominating ideas\r\npertaining to the province of the race at that period.\r\n\r\nThe prospectus says:\r\n\r\n     \"The object of this institute is one of great importance,\r\n     greater, indeed, than might at first appear to those who would\r\n     only glance at the advantages which it is calculated to directly\r\n     impart to the leading portion of the human race, and through it\r\n     to society at large. In fact, these girls will either become\r\n     mothers of families or household servants. In the first case the\r\n     solid virtues, the religious and moral principles which they may\r\n     have acquired in this school will be carefully transferred as a\r\n     legacy to their children. Instances of the happy influence which\r\n     the example of virtuous parents has on the remotest lineage in\r\n     this humble and naturally dutiful class of society are numerous.\r\n     As to such as are to be employed as servants, they will be\r\n     intrusted with domestic concerns and the care of young children.\r\n     How important, then, it will be that these girls shall have\r\n     imbibed religious principles, and have been trained up in habits\r\n     of modesty, honesty, and integrity.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThe Wells School, established by a Colored man by the name of Nelson\r\nWells, in 1835, gave instruction to free children of color. It was\r\nmanaged by a board of trustees who applied the income of $7,000 (the\r\namount left by Mr. Wells) to the support of the school. It\r\naccomplished much good.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nA separate school for Colored children was established in Boston, in\r\n1798, and was held in the house of a reputable Colored man named\r\nPrimus Hall. The teacher was one Elisha Sylvester, whose salary was\r\npaid by the parents of the children whom he taught. In 1800 sixty-six\r\nColored citizens presented a petition to the School Committee of\r\nBoston, praying that a school might be established for their benefit.\r\nA sub-committee, to whom the petition had been referred, reported in\r\nfavor of granting the prayer, but it was voted down at the next town\r\nmeeting. However, the school taught by Mr. Sylvester did not perish.\r\nTwo young gentlemen from Harvard University, Messrs. Brown and\r\nWilliams, continued the school until 1806. During this year the\r\nColored Baptists built a church edifice in Belknap Street, and fitted\r\nup the lower room for a school for Colored children. From the house of\r\nPrimus Hall the little school was moved to its new quarters in the\r\nBelknap Street church. Here it was continued until 1835, when a\r\nschool-house for Colored children was erected and paid for out of a\r\nfund left for the purpose by Abiel Smith, and was subsequently called\r\n\"Smith School-house.\" The authorities of Boston were induced to give\r\n$200.00 as an annual appropriation, and the parents of the children in\r\nattendance paid 12½ cents per week. The school-house was dedicated\r\nwith appropriate exercises, Hon. William Minot delivering the\r\ndedicatory address.\r\n\r\nThe African school in Belknap Street was under the control of the\r\nschool committee from 1812 to 1821, and from 1821 was under the charge\r\nof a special sub-committee. Among the teachers was John B. Russworm,\r\nfrom 1821 to 1824, who entered Bowdoin College in the latter year, and\r\nafterward became governor of the colony of Cape Palmas in Southern\r\nLiberia.\r\n\r\nThe first primary school for Colored children in Boston was\r\nestablished in 1820, two or three of which were subsequently kept\r\nuntil 1855, when they were discontinued as separate schools, in\r\naccordance with the general law passed by the Legislature in that\r\nyear, which provided that, \"in determining the qualifications of\r\nscholars to be admitted into any public school, or any district school\r\nin this commonwealth, no distinction shall be made on account of the\r\nrace, color, or religious opinions of the applicant or scholar.\" \"Any\r\nchild, who, on account of his race, color, or religious opinions\r\nshould be excluded from any public or district school, if otherwise\r\nqualified,\" might recover damages in an action of _tort_, brought in\r\nthe name of the child in any court of competent jurisdiction, against\r\nthe city or town in which the school was located.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI\r\n\r\npassed an act in 1823 providing against the meeting together of\r\nslaves, free Negroes, or Mulattoes above the number of five. They were\r\nnot allowed to meet at any public house in the night; or at any house,\r\nfor teaching, reading, or writing, in the day or night. The penalty\r\nfor the violation of this law was whipping, \"not exceeding\r\nthirty-nine\" lashes.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 an act was passed making it \"unlawful for any slave, free\r\nnegro, or mulatto to preach the Gospel,\" upon pain of receiving\r\nthirty-nine lashes upon the naked back of the presumptuous preacher.\r\nIf a Negro received written permission from his master he might preach\r\nto the Negroes in his immediate neighborhood, providing six\r\nrespectable white men, owners of slaves, were present.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, and again in 1848, school laws were enacted, but in both\r\ninstances schools and education were prescribed for \"white youth\r\nbetween the ages of six and twenty years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI\r\n\r\nordered all free persons of color to move out of the State in 1845. In\r\n1847 an act was passed providing that \"no person shall keep or teach\r\nany school for the instruction of negroes or mulattoes in reading or\r\nwriting in this State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\nhad the courage and patriotism, in 1777, to extend the right of\r\nsuffrage to every male inhabitant of full age. But by the revised\r\nconstitution, in 1821, this liberal provision was abridged so that\r\n\"no man of color, unless he shall have been for three years a citizen\r\nof this State, and for one year next preceding any election, shall be\r\nseized and possessed of a freehold estate of $250 over and above all\r\ndebts and encumbrances charged thereon, and shall have been actually\r\nrated and paid a tax thereon, shall be entitled to vote at any such\r\nelection. And no person of color shall be subject to direct taxation\r\nunless he shall be seized and possessed of such real estate as\r\naforesaid.\" In 1846, and again in 1850, a Constitutional amendment\r\nconferring equal privileges upon the Negroes, was voted down by large\r\nmajorities.\r\n\r\nA school for Negro slaves was opened in the city of New York in 1704\r\nby Elias Neau, a native of France, and a catechist of the \"Society for\r\nthe Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\" After a long\r\nimprisonment for his public profession of faith as a Protestant, he\r\nfounded an asylum in New York. His sympathies were awakened by the\r\ncondition of the Negroes in slavery in that city, who numbered about\r\n1,500 at that time. The difficulties of holding any intercourse with\r\nthem seemed almost insurmountable. At first he could only visit them\r\nfrom house to house, after his day's toil was over; afterward he was\r\npermitted to gather them together in a room in his own house for a\r\nshort time in the evening. As the result of his instructions at the\r\nend of four years, in 1708, the ordinary number under his instruction\r\nwas 200. Many were judged worthy to receive the sacrament at the hands\r\nof Mr. Vesey, the rector of Trinity Church, some of whom became\r\nregular and devout communicants, remarkable for their orderly and\r\nblameless lives.\r\n\r\nBut soon after this time some Negroes of the Carmantee and Pappa\r\ntribes formed a plot for setting fire to the city and murdering the\r\nEnglish on a certain night. The work was commenced but checked, and\r\nafter a short struggle the English subdued the Negroes. Immediately a\r\nloud and angry clamor arose against Elias Neau, his accusers saying\r\nthat his school was the cause of the murderous attempt. He denied the\r\ncharge in vain; and so furious were the people that, for a time, his\r\nlife was in danger. The evidence, however, at the trial proved that\r\nthe Negroes most deeply engaged in this plot were those whose masters\r\nwere most opposed to any means for their instruction. Yet the offence\r\nof a few was charged upon the race, and even the provincial government\r\nlent its authority to make the burden of Neau the heavier. The common\r\ncouncil passed an order forbidding Negroes \"to appear in the streets\r\nafter sunset, without lanthorns or candles\"; and as they could not\r\nprocure these, the result was to break up the labors of Neau. But at\r\nthis juncture Governor Hunter interposed, and went to visit the school\r\nof Neau, accompanied by several officers of rank and by the society's\r\nmissionaries, and he was so well pleased that he gave his full\r\napproval to the work, and in a public proclamation called upon the\r\nclergy of the province to exhort their congregations to extend their\r\napproval also. Vesey, the good rector of Trinity Church, had long\r\nwatched the labors of Neau and witnessed the progress of his scholars,\r\nas well as assisted him in them; and finally the governor, the\r\ncouncil, mayor, recorder, and two chief justices of New York joined in\r\ndeclaring that Neau \"in a very eminent degree deserved the\r\ncountenance, favor, and protection of the society.\" He therefore\r\ncontinued his labors until 1722, when, \"amid the unaffected sorrow of\r\nhis negro scholars and the friends who honored him for their sake, he\r\nwas removed by death.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was then continued by \"Huddlestone, then schoolmaster in New\r\nYork\"; and he was succeeded by Rev. Mr. Wetmore, who removed in 1726\r\nto Rye; whereupon the Rev. Mr. Colgan was appointed to assist the\r\nrector of Trinity Church, and to carry on the instruction of the\r\nNegroes. A few years afterward Thomas Noxon assisted Mr. Colgan, and\r\ntheir joint success was very satisfactory. Rev. R. Charlton, who had\r\nbeen engaged in similar labor at New Windsor, was called to New York\r\nin 1732, where he followed up the work successfully for fifteen years,\r\nand was succeeded by Rev. Samuel Auchmuty. Upon the death of Thomas\r\nNoxon, in 1741, Mr. Hildreth took his place, who, in 1764, wrote that\r\n\"not a single black admitted by him to the holy communion had turned\r\nout badly, or in any way disgraced his profession.\" Both Auchmuty and\r\nHildreth received valuable support from Mr. Barclay, who, upon the\r\ndeath of Mr. Vesey, in 1746, had been appointed to the rectory of\r\nTrinity Church.\r\n\r\nThe frequent kidnapping of free persons of color excited public alarm\r\nand resulted in the formation of \"The New York Society for Promoting\r\nthe Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting such of them as have been or\r\nmay be Liberated.\" These are the names of the gentlemen who organized\r\nthe society, and became the board of trustees of the \"_New York\r\nAfrican Free School_\":\r\n\r\nMelancthon Smith, Jno. Bleeker, James Cogswell, Lawrence Embree,\r\nThomas Burling, Willett Leaman, Jno. Lawrence, Jacob Leaman, White\r\nMattock, Mathew Clarkson, Nathaniel Lawrence, Jno. Murray, Jr.\r\n\r\nTheir school, located in Cliff Street, between Beekman and Ferry, was\r\nopened in 1786, taught by Cornelius Davis, attended by about forty\r\npupils of both sexes, and appears, from their book of minutes, to have\r\nbeen satisfactorily conducted. In the year 1791 a female teacher was\r\nadded to instruct the girls in needle-work, the expected advantages of\r\nwhich measure were soon realized and highly gratifying to the society.\r\nIn 1808 the society was incorporated, and in the preamble it is\r\nrecorded that \"a free school for the education of such persons as have\r\nbeen liberated from bondage, that they may hereafter become useful\r\nmembers of the community,\" has been established. It may be proper here\r\nto remark that the good cause in which the friends of this school were\r\nengaged, was far from being a popular one. The prejudices of a large\r\nportion of the community were against it; the means in the hands of\r\nthe trustees were often very inadequate, and many seasons of\r\ndiscouragement were witnessed; but they were met by men who, trusting\r\nin the Divine support, were resolved neither to relax their exertions\r\nnor to retire from the field.\r\n\r\nThrough the space of about twenty years they struggled on; the number\r\nof scholars varying from forty to sixty, until the year 1809, when the\r\nLancasterian, or monitorial, system of instruction was introduced\r\n(this being the second school in the United States to adopt the plan),\r\nunder a new teacher, E. J. Cox, and a very favorable change was\r\nproduced, the number of pupils, and the efficiency of their\r\ninstruction being largely increased.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, however, in January, 1814, their school-house was\r\ndestroyed by fire, which checked the progress of the school for a\r\ntime, as no room could be obtained large enough to accommodate the\r\nwhole number of pupils. A small room in Doyer Street was temporarily\r\nhired, to keep the school together till further arrangements could be\r\nmade, and an appeal was made to the liberality of the citizens and to\r\nthe corporation of the city, which resulted in obtaining from the\r\nlatter a grant of two lots of ground in William. Street, on which to\r\nbuild a new school-house; and in January, 1815, a commodious brick\r\nbuilding, to accommodate 200 pupils, was finished on this lot, and\r\nthe school was resumed with fresh vigor and increasing interest. In a\r\nfew months the room became so crowded that it was found necessary to\r\nengage a separate room, next to the school, to accommodate such of the\r\npupils as were to be taught sewing. This branch had been for many\r\nyears discontinued, but was now resumed under the direction of Miss\r\nLucy Turpen, a young lady whose amiable disposition and faithful\r\ndischarge of her duties rendered her greatly esteemed both by her\r\npupils and the trustees. This young lady, after serving the board for\r\nseveral years, removed with her parents to Ohio, and her place was\r\nsupplied by Miss Mary Lincrum, who was succeeded by Miss Eliza J. Cox,\r\nand the latter by Miss Mary Ann Cox, and she by Miss Carolina Roe,\r\nunder each of whom the school continued to sustain a high character\r\nfor order and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe school in William Street increasing in numbers, another building\r\nwas found necessary, and was built on a lot of ground 50 by 100 feet\r\nsquare, on Mulberry Street, between Grand and Hester streets, to\r\naccommodate five hundred pupils, and was completed and occupied, with\r\nC. C. Andrews for teacher, in May, 1820.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lafayette visited this school September 10, 1824, an abridged\r\naccount of which is copied from the \"Commercial Advertiser\" of that\r\ndate:\r\n\r\n     VISIT OF LAFAYETTE TO THE AFRICAN SCHOOL IN 1824.\r\n\r\n     \"At 1 o'clock the general, with the company invited for the\r\n     occasion, visited the African free school, on Mulberry Street.\r\n     This school embraces about 500 scholars; about 450 were present\r\n     on this occasion, and they are certainly the best disciplined and\r\n     most interesting school of children we have ever witnessed. As\r\n     the general was conducted to a seat, Mr. Ketchum adverted to the\r\n     fact that as long ago as 1788 the general had been elected a\r\n     member of the institution (Manumission Society) at the same time\r\n     with Granville Sharp and Thomas Clarkson, of England. The general\r\n     perfectly remembered the circumstances, and mentioned\r\n     particularly the letter he had received on that occasion from the\r\n     Hon. John Jay, then president of the society. One of the pupils,\r\n     Master James M. Smith, aged eleven years, then stepped forward\r\n     and gracefully delivered the following address:\r\n\r\n     \"'GENERAL LAFAYETTE: In behalf of myself and fellow-schoolmates\r\n     may I be permitted to express our sincere and respectful\r\n     gratitude to you for the condescension you have manifested this\r\n     day in visiting this institution, which is one of the noblest\r\n     specimens of New York philanthropy. Here, sir, you behold\r\n     hundreds of the poor children of Africa sharing with those of a\r\n     lighter hue in the blessings of education; and while it will be\r\n     our pleasure to remember the great deeds you have done for\r\n     America, it will be our delight also to cherish the memory of\r\n     General Lafayette as a friend to African emancipation, and as a\r\n     member of this institution.'\r\n\r\n     \"To which the general replied, in his own characteristic style,\r\n     'I thank you, my dear child.'\r\n\r\n     \"Several of the pupils underwent short examinations, and one of\r\n     them explained the use of the globes and answered many questions\r\n     in geography.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR COLORED CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nThese schools continued to flourish under the same management, and\r\nwith an attendance varying from 600 in 1824 to 862 in 1832, in the\r\nlatter part of which year the Manumission Society, whose schools were\r\nnot in part supported by the public fund, applied to the Public School\r\nSociety for a committee of conference to effect a union. It was felt\r\nby the trustees that on many accounts it was better that the two sets\r\nof schools should remain separate, but, fearing further diversion of\r\nthe school fund, it was desirable that the number of societies\r\nparticipating should be as small as possible, and arrangements were\r\naccordingly made for a transfer of the schools and property of the\r\nelder society. After some delay, in consequence of legislative action\r\nbeing found necessary to give a title to their real estate, on the 2d\r\nof May, 1834, the transfer was effected, all their schools and school\r\nproperty passing into the hands of the New York Public School Society,\r\nat an appraised valuation of $12,130.22.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate register of these schools at the time of the transfer\r\nwas nearly 1,400, with an average attendance of about one half that\r\nnumber. They were placed in charge of a committee with powers similar\r\nto the committee on primary schools, but their administration was not\r\nsatisfactory, and it was soon found that the schools had greatly\r\ndiminished in numbers, efficiency, and usefulness. A committee of\r\ninquiry was appointed, and reported that, in consequence of the great\r\nanti-slavery riots and attacks on Colored people, many families had\r\nremoved from the city, and of those that remained many kept their\r\nchildren at home; they knew the Manumission Society as their special\r\nfriends, but knew nothing of the Public School Society; the reduction\r\nof all the schools but one to the grade of primary had given great\r\noffence; also the discharge of teachers long employed, and the\r\ndiscontinuance of rewards, and taking home of spelling books; strong\r\nprejudices had grown up against the Public School Society. The\r\ncommittee recommended a prompt assimilation of the Colored schools to\r\nthe white; the establishment of two or more upper schools in a new\r\nbuilding; a normal school for Colored monitors; and the appointment of\r\na Colored man as school agent, at $150 a year. The school on Mulberry\r\nStreet at this time, 1835, was designated Colored Grammar School No.\r\n1. A. Libolt was principal, and registered 317 pupils; there were also\r\nsix primaries, located in different parts of the city, with an\r\naggregate attendance of 925 pupils.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 a new school building was completed in Laurens Street, opened\r\nwith 210 pupils, R. F. Wake (colored), principal, and was designated\r\nColored Grammar School No. 2. Other means were taken to improve the\r\nschools, and to induce the Colored people to patronize them; the\r\nprincipal of No. 1, Mr. Libolt, was replaced by Mr. John Peterson,\r\ncolored, a sufficient assurance of whose ability and success we have\r\nin the fact that he has been continued in the position ever since. A\r\n\"Society for the Promotion of Education among Colored Children\" was\r\norganized, and established two additional schools, one in Thomas\r\nStreet, and one in Centre, and a marked improvement was manifest; but\r\nit required a long time to restore the confidence and interest felt\r\nbefore the transfer, and even up to 1848 the aggregate attendance in\r\nall the Colored schools was only 1,375 pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1852 the first evening schools for Colored pupils\r\nwere opened; one for males and one for females, and were attended by\r\n379 pupils. In the year 1853 the Colored schools, with all the schools\r\nand school property of the Public School Society, were transferred to\r\nthe \"Board of Education of the City and County of New York,\" and still\r\nfurther improvements were made in them; a normal school for Colored\r\nteachers was established, with Mr. John Peterson, principal, and the\r\nschools were graded in the same manner as those for white children.\r\nColored Grammar School No. 3, was opened at 78 West Fortieth Street,\r\nMiss Caroline W. Simpson, principal, and in the ensuing year three\r\nothers were added; No. 4 in One Hundred and Twentieth Street (Harlem),\r\nMiss Nancy Thompson, principal; No. 5, at 101 Hudson Street, P. W.\r\nWilliams, principal; and No. 6, at 1,167 Broadway, Prince Leveridge,\r\nprincipal. Grammar Schools Nos. 2, 3, and 4, had primary departments\r\nattached, and there were also at this time three separate primary\r\nschools, and the aggregate attendance in all was 2,047. Since then the\r\nattendance in these schools has not varied much from these figures.\r\nThe schools themselves have been altered and modified from time to\r\ntime, as their necessity seemed to indicate; though under the general\r\nmanagement of the Board of Education, they have been in the care of\r\nthe school officers of the wards in which they are located, and while\r\nin some cases they received the proper attention, in others they were\r\neither wholly, or in part, neglected. A recent act has placed them\r\ndirectly in charge of the Board of Education, who have appointed a\r\nspecial committee to look after their interests, and measures are\r\nbeing taken by them which will give this class of schools every\r\nopportunity and convenience possessed by any other, and, it is hoped,\r\nwill also improve the grade of its scholarship.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\nsuffered her free persons of color to maintain schools until 1835,\r\nwhen they were abolished by law. During the period referred to, the\r\nColored schools were taught by white teachers, but after 1835 the few\r\nteachers who taught Colored children in private houses were Colored\r\npersons. The public-school system of North Carolina provided that no\r\ndescendant from Negro ancestors, to the fourth generation inclusive,\r\nshould enjoy the benefit thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nOHIO.\r\n\r\nThe first schools for Colored children in Ohio were established at\r\nCincinnati in 1820, by Colored men. These schools were not kept up\r\nregularly. A white gentleman named Wing, who taught a night school\r\nnear the corner of Vine and Sixth Streets, admitted Colored pupils\r\ninto his school. Owen T. B. Nickens, a public-spirited and intelligent\r\nColored man, did much to establish schools for the Colored people.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 a school for Colored children was opened in the Baptist Church\r\non Western Row. It was taught at different periods by Messrs. Barbour,\r\nE. Fairchild, W. Robinson, and Augustus Wattles; and by the\r\nfollowing-named ladies: Misses Bishop, Matthews, Lowe, and Mrs.\r\nMerrell. Although excellent teachers as well as upright ladies and\r\ngentlemen, they were subjected to great persecutions. They were unable\r\nto secure board, because the spirit of the whites would not\r\ncountenance the teachers of Negro schools, and they spelled the word\r\nwith two g's. And at times the teachers were compelled to close the\r\nschool on account of the violence of the populace. The salaries of the\r\nteachers were paid partly by an educational society of white\r\nphilanthropists, and partly by such Colored persons as had means. Of\r\nthe latter class were John Woodson, John Liverpool, Baker Jones,\r\nDinnis Hill, Joseph Fowler, and William O'Hara.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, the Rev. Hiram S. Gilmore, founded the \"Cincinnati High\r\nSchool\" for Colored youth. Mr. Gilmore was a man rich in sentiments of\r\nhumanity, and endowed plenteously with executive ability and this\r\nworld's goods. All these he consecrated to the elevation and education\r\nof the Colored people.\r\n\r\nThis school-house was located at the east end of Harrison Street, and\r\nwas in every sense a model building, comprising five rooms, a chapel,\r\na gymnasium, and spacious grounds. The pupils increased yearly, and\r\nthe character of the school made many friends for the cause. The\r\nfollowing persons taught in this school: Joseph H. Moore, Thomas L.\r\nBoucher, David P. Lowe, Dr. A. L. Childs, and W. F. Colburn. Dr.\r\nChilds became principal of the school in 1848.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, the Legislature passed an act establishing schools for\r\nColored children, to be maintained at the public expense. In 1850, a\r\nboard of Colored trustees was elected, teachers employed, and\r\nbuildings hired. The schools were put in operation. The law of 1849\r\nprovided that so much of the funds belonging to the city of Cincinnati\r\nas would fall to the Colored youth, by a _per capita_ division, should\r\nbe held subject to the order of the Colored trustees. But their order\r\nwas not honored by the city treasurer, upon the ground that under the\r\nconstitution of the State only electors could hold office; that\r\nColored men were not electors, and, therefore, could not hold office.\r\nAfter three months the Colored schools were closed, and the teachers\r\nwent out without their salaries.\r\n\r\nJohn I. Gaines, an intelligent and fearless Colored leader, made a\r\nstatement of the case to a public meeting of the Colored people of\r\nCincinnati, and urged the employment of counsel to try the case in\r\nthe courts. Money was raised, and Flamen Ball, Sr., was secured to\r\nmake an application for _mandamus_. The case was finally carried to\r\nthe Supreme Court and won by the Colored people.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, the schools were opened again; but the rooms were small and\r\nwretchedly appointed, and the trustees unable to provide better ones.\r\nWithout notice the Colored trustees were deposed. The management of\r\nthe Colored schools was vested in a board of trustees and school\r\nvisitors, who were also in charge of the schools for the white\r\nchildren. This board, under a new law, had authority to appoint six\r\nColored men who were to manage the Colored schools with the exception\r\nof the school fund. This greatly angered the leading Colored men, and,\r\ntherefore, they refused to endorse this new management.\r\n\r\nThe law was altered in 1856, giving the Colored people the right to\r\nelect, by ballot, their own trustees.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Nicholas Longworth built the first school-house for the\r\nColored people, and gave them the building on a lease of fourteen\r\nyears, in which time they were to pay for it--$14,000. In 1859, a\r\nlarge building was erected on Court Street.\r\n\r\nOberlin College opened its doors to Colored students from the moment\r\nof its existence in 1833, and they have never been closed at any time\r\nsince. It was here that the incomparable Finney, with the fierceness\r\nof John Baptist, the gentleness of John the Evangelist, the logic of\r\nPaul, and the eloquence of Isaiah, pleaded the cause of the American\r\nslave, and gave instruction to all who sat at his feet regardless of\r\ncolor or race. George B. Vashon, William Howard Day, John Mercer\r\nLangston, and many other Colored men graduated from Oberlin College\r\nbefore any of the other leading colleges of the country had consented\r\nto give Colored men a classical education.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet established, in 1750, the first school for Colored\r\npeople in this State, and taught it himself without money and without\r\nprice. He solicited funds for the erection of a school-house for the\r\nColored children, and of their intellectual capacities said: \"I can\r\nwith truth and sincerity declare that I have found among the negroes\r\nas great variety of talents as among a like number of whites, and I am\r\nbold to assert that the notion entertained by some, that the blacks\r\nare inferior in their capacity, is a vulgar prejudice, founded on the\r\npride or ignorance of their lordly masters, who have kept their slaves\r\nat such a distance as to be unable to form a right judgment of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe died on the 3d of May, 1784, universally beloved and sincerely\r\nmourned, especially by the Negro population of Pennsylvania, for whose\r\neducation he had done so much. The following clause in his will\r\nillustrates his character in respect to public instruction:\r\n\r\n     \"I give my above said house and lot, or ground-rent proceeding\r\n     from it, and the rest and residue of my estate which shall remain\r\n     undisposed of after my wife's decease, both real and personal, to\r\n     the public school of Philadelphia, founded by charter, and to\r\n     their successors forever, in trust, that they shall sell my house\r\n     and lot on perpetual ground-rent forever, if the same be not\r\n     already sold by my executors, as before mentioned, and that as\r\n     speedily as may be they receive and take as much of my personal\r\n     estate as may be remaining, and therewith purchase a yearly\r\n     ground-rent, or ground-rents, and with the income of such\r\n     ground-rent proceeding from the sale of my real estate, hire and\r\n     employ a religious-minded person, or persons, to teach a number\r\n     of negro, mulatto, or Indian children to read, write, arithmetic,\r\n     plain accounts, needle-work, etc. And it is my particular desire,\r\n     founded on the experience I have had in that service, that in the\r\n     choice of such tutors, special care may be had to prefer an\r\n     industrious, careful person of true piety, who may be or become\r\n     suitably qualified, who would undertake the service from a\r\n     principle of charity, to one more highly learned, not equally\r\n     disposed; this I desire may be carefully attended to, sensible\r\n     that from the number of pupils of all ages, the irregularity of\r\n     attendance their situation subjects them to will not admit of\r\n     that particular inspection in their improvement usual in other\r\n     schools, but that the real well-doing of the scholars will very\r\n     much depend upon the master making a special conscience of doing\r\n     his duty; and shall likewise defray such other necessary expense\r\n     as may occur in that service; and as the said remaining income of\r\n     my estate, after my wife's decease, will not be sufficient to\r\n     defray the whole expense necessary for the support of such a\r\n     school, it is my request that the overseers of the said public\r\n     school shall join in the care and expense of such school, or\r\n     schools, for the education of negro, mulatto, or Indian children,\r\n     with any committee which may be appointed by the monthly meetings\r\n     of Friends in Philadelphia, or with any other body of benevolent\r\n     persons who may join in raising money and employing it for the\r\n     education and care of such children; my desire being that as\r\n     such a school is now set up, it may be forever maintained in this\r\n     city.\"\r\n\r\nJust before his death he addressed the following note to the\r\n\"overseers of the school for the instruction of the black people.\"\r\n\r\n     \"My friend, Joseph Clark, having frequently observed to me his\r\n     desire, in case of my inability of continuing the care of the\r\n     negro school, of succeeding me in that service, notwithstanding\r\n     he now has a more advantageous school, by the desire of doing\r\n     good to the black people makes him overlook these pecuniary\r\n     advantages, I much wish the overseers of the school would take\r\n     his desires under their peculiar notice and give him such due\r\n     encouragement as may be proper, it being a matter of the greatest\r\n     consequence to that school that the master be a person who makes\r\n     it a principle to do his duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe noble friends were early in the field as the champions of\r\neducation for the Negroes. It was Anthony Benezet, who, on the 26th of\r\nJanuary, 1770, secured the appointment of a committee by the monthly\r\nmeeting of the Friends, \"to consider on the instruction of negro and\r\nmulatto children in reading, writing, and other useful learning\r\nsuitable to their capacity and circumstances.\" On the 30th of May,\r\n1770, a special committee of Friends sought to employ an instructor\r\n\"to teach, not more at one time than thirty children, in the first\r\nrudiments of school learning and in sewing and knitting.\" Moles\r\nPaterson was first employed at a salary of £80 a year, and an\r\nadditional sum of £11 for one half of the rent of his dwelling-house.\r\nInstruction was free to the poor; but those who were able to pay were\r\nrequired to do so \"at the rate of 10s. a quarter for those who write,\r\nand 7s. 6d. for others.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1784, William Waring was placed in charge of the larger children,\r\nat a salary of £100; and Sarah Dougherty, of the younger children and\r\ngirls, in teaching spelling, reading, sewing, etc., at a salary of\r\n£50. In 1787, aid was received from David Barclay, of London, in\r\nbehalf of a committee for managing a donation for the relief of\r\nFriends in America; and the sum of £500 was thus obtained, which, with\r\nthe fund derived from the estate of Benezet, and £300 from Thomas\r\nShirley, a Colored man, was appropriated to the erection of a\r\nschool-house. In 1819 a committee of \"women Friends,\" to have\r\nexclusive charge of the admission of girls and the general\r\nsuperintendence of the girls' school, was associated with the\r\noverseers in the charge of the school. In 1830, in order to relieve\r\nthe day school of some of the male adults who had been in the habit of\r\nattending, an evening school for the purpose of instructing such\r\npersons gratuitously was opened, and has been continued to the present\r\ntime. In 1844, a lot was secured on Locust Street, extending along\r\nShield's Alley, now Aurora Street, on which a new house was erected in\r\n1847, the expense of which was paid for in part from the proceeds of\r\nthe sale of a lot bequeathed by John Pemberton. Additional\r\naccommodations were made to this building, from time to time, as room\r\nwas demanded by new classes of pupils.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, a statistical return of the condition of the people of color\r\nin the city and districts of Philadelphia shows that there were then\r\none grammar school, with 463 pupils; two public primary schools, with\r\n339; and an infant school, under the charge of the Pennsylvania\r\nAbolition Society, of 70 pupils, in Clifton Street: a ragged and a\r\nmoral-reform school, with 81 pupils. In West Philadelphia there was\r\nalso a public school, with 67 pupils; and, in all, there were about 20\r\nprivate schools, with 300 pupils; making an aggregate of more than\r\n1,300 children receiving an education.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, according to Bacon's \"Statistics of the Colored People of\r\nPhiladelphia,\" there were 1,031 Colored children in public schools,\r\n748 in charity schools of various kinds, 211 in benevolent and\r\nreformatory schools, and 331 in private schools, making an aggregate\r\nof 2,321 pupils; besides four evening schools, one for adult males,\r\none for females, and one for young apprentices. There were 19\r\nSunday-schools connected with the congregations of the Colored people,\r\nand conducted by their own teachers, containing 1,667 pupils, and four\r\nSunday-schools gathered as mission schools by members of white\r\ncongregations, with 215 pupils. There was also a \"Public Library and\r\nReading-room\" connected with the \"Institute for Colored Youth,\"\r\nestablished in 1853, having about 1,300 volumes; besides three other\r\nsmall libraries in different parts of the city. The same pamphlet\r\nshows that there were 1,700 of the Colored population engaged in\r\ndifferent trades and occupations, representing every department of\r\nindustry.[64]\r\n\r\nIn 1794, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society established a school for\r\nchildren of the people of color, and in 1809 erected a school building\r\nat a cost of four thousand dollars, which they designated as \"Clarkson\r\nHall,\" in 1815. In 1813, a board of education was organized consisting\r\nof thirteen persons, with a visiting committee of three, whose duty it\r\nwas to visit the schools once each week. In 1818, the school board, in\r\ntheir report, speak very kindly and encouragingly of the Clarkson\r\nSchools, which, they say, \"furnish a decided refutation of the charge\r\nthat the mental endowments of the descendants of Africa are inferior\r\nto those possessed by their white brethren. We can assert, without\r\nfear of contradiction, that the pupils of this seminary will sustain a\r\nfair comparison with those of any other institution in which the same\r\nelementary branches are taught.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1820, an effort was made to have the authorities of the white\r\nschools provide for the education of the Colored children as well as\r\nthe whites, because the laws of the State required the education of\r\nall the youth. The comptrollers of the public schools confessed that\r\nthe law provided for the education of \"poor and indigent children,\"\r\nand that it extended to those of persons of color. Accordingly, in\r\n1822, a school for the education of indigent persons of color of both\r\nsexes, was opened in Lombard Street, Philadelphia. In 1841, a primary\r\nschool was opened in the same building. In 1833, the \"Unclassified\r\nSchool\" in Coates Street, and at frequent intervals after this several\r\nschools of the same grade, were started in West Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, by the will of Richard Humphreys, who died in 1832, an\r\n\"Institute for Colored Youth\" was started. The sum of ten thousand\r\ndollars was devised to certain trustees who were to pay it over to\r\nsome society that might be disposed to establish a school for the\r\neducation of the \"descendants of the African race in school learning\r\nin the various branches of the mechanic arts and trade, and in\r\nagriculture.\" Thirty members of the society of Friends formed\r\nthemselves into an association for the purpose of carrying out the\r\nwishes and plans of Mr. Humphreys. In the preamble of the constitution\r\nthey adopted, their ideas and plans were thus set forth:\r\n\r\n     \"We believe that the most successful method of elevating the\r\n     moral and intellectual character of the descendants of Africa, as\r\n     well as of improving their social condition, is to extend to them\r\n     the benefits of a good education, and to instruct them in the\r\n     knowledge of some useful trade or business, whereby they may be\r\n     enabled to obtain a comfortable livelihood by their own industry;\r\n     and through these means to prepare them for fulfilling the\r\n     various duties of domestic and social life with reputation and\r\n     fidelity, as good citizens and pious men.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the feature of agricultural and mechanic arts,\r\nthe association purchased a farm in Bristol township, Philadelphia\r\nCounty, in 1839, where boys of the Colored race were taught farming,\r\nshoemaking, and other useful trades. The incorporation of the\r\ninstitution was secured in 1842, and in 1844 another friend\r\ndying--Jonathan Zane--added a handsome sum to the treasury, which,\r\nwith several small legacies, made $18,000 for this enterprise. But in\r\n1846 the work came to a standstill; the farm with its equipments was\r\nsold, and for six years very little was done, except through a night\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, a lot for a school building was purchased on Lombard Street,\r\nand a building erected, and the school opened in the autumn of 1852,\r\nfor boys, under the care of Charles L. Reason, an accomplished young\r\nColored teacher from New York. A girls' school was opened the same\r\nyear, and, under Mr. Reason's excellent instruction, many worthy and\r\ncompetent teachers and leaders of the Negro race came forth.\r\n\r\nAvery College, at Allegheny City, was founded by the Rev. Charles\r\nAvery, a native of New York, but for the greater part of a long and\r\nuseful life adorned by the noblest virtues, a resident of\r\nPennsylvania. By will he left $300,000 for the christianization of the\r\nAfrican race; $150,000 to be used in Africa, and $150,000 in America.\r\nHe left $25,000 as an endowment fund for Avery College.\r\n\r\nAt a stated meeting during the session of the Presbytery at New\r\nCastle, Pa., October 5, 1853, it was resolved that \"there shall be\r\nestablished within our bounds, and under our supervision, an\r\ninstitution, to be called the Ashum Institute, for the scientific,\r\nclassical, and theological education of colored youth of the male\r\nsex.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, J. M. Dickey, A. Hamilton, R. P. Dubois, ministers; and\r\nSamuel J. Dickey and John M. Kelton, ruling elders, were appointed a\r\ncommittee to perfect the idea. They were to solicit and receive funds,\r\nsecure a charter from the State of Pennsylvania, and erect suitable\r\nbuildings for the institute. On the 14th of November, 1853, they\r\npurchased thirty acres of land at the cost of $1,250. At the session\r\nof the Legislature in 1854, a charter was granted establishing \"at or\r\nnear a place called Hinsonville, in the county of Chester, an\r\ninstitution of learning for the scientific, classical, and theological\r\neducation of colored youth of the male sex, by the name and style of\r\nAshum Institute.\" The trustees were John M. Dickey, Alfred Hamilton,\r\nRobert P. Dubois, James Latta, John B. Spottswood, James M. Crowell,\r\nSamuel J. Dickey, John M. Kelton, and William Wilson.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the charter the trustees were empowered \"to\r\nprocure the endowment of the institute, not exceeding the sum of\r\n$100,000; to confer such literary degrees and academic honors as are\r\nusually granted by colleges\"; and it was required that \"the institute\r\nshall be open to the admission of colored pupils of the male sex, of\r\nall religious denominations, who exhibit a fair moral character, and\r\nare willing to yield a ready obedience to the general regulations\r\nprescribed for the conduct of the pupils and the government of the\r\ninstitute.\"\r\n\r\nThe institute was formally dedicated on the 31st of December, 1856. It\r\nis now known as Lincoln University.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND\r\n\r\nconferred the right of elective franchise upon her Colored citizens by\r\nher constitution in 1843, and ever since equal privileges have been\r\nafforded them. In 1828 the Colored people of Providence petitioned for\r\na separate school, but it was finally abolished by an act of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\ntook the lead in legislating against the instruction of the Colored\r\nrace, as she subsequently took the lead in seceding from the Union. In\r\n1740, while yet a British province, the Legislature passed the\r\nfollowing law:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas the having of slaves taught to write, or suffering them\r\n     to be employed in writing, may be attended with inconveniences,\r\n     _Be it enacted_, That all and every person and persons\r\n     whatsoever, who shall hereafter teach, or cause any slave or\r\n     slaves to be taught, or shall use or employ any slave as a scribe\r\n     in any manner of writing whatever, hereafter taught to write,\r\n     every such person or persons shall for every such offense forfeit\r\n     the sum of £100 current money.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the State Assembly passed an act, embracing free Colored\r\npeople as well as slaves in its shameful provisions, enacting \"that\r\nassemblies of slaves, free negroes, mulattoes, and mestizoes, whether\r\ncomposed of all or any such description of persons, or of all or any\r\nof the same and a proportion of white persons, met together for the\r\npurpose of _mental_ instruction in a confined or secret place, or with\r\nthe gates or doors of such place barred, bolted, or locked, so as to\r\nprevent the free ingress to and from the same,\" are declared to be\r\nunlawful meetings; the officers dispersing such unlawful assemblages\r\nbeing authorized to \"inflict such corporal punishment, not exceeding\r\ntwenty lashes, upon such slaves, free negroes, mulattoes, and\r\nmestizoes, as they may judge necessary for deterring them from the\r\nlike unlawful assemblage in future.\" Another section of the same act\r\ndeclares, \"that it shall not be lawful for any number of slaves, free\r\nnegroes, mulattoes, or mestizoes, even in company with white persons,\r\nto meet together and assemble for the purpose of mental instruction or\r\nreligious worship before the rising of the sun or after the going down\r\nof the same.\" This section was so oppressive, that in 1803, in answer\r\nto petitions from certain religious societies, an amending act was\r\npassed forbidding any person before 9 o'clock in the evening \"to break\r\ninto a place of meeting wherever shall be assembled the members of any\r\nreligious society of the State, provided a majority of them shall be\r\nwhite persons, or other to disturb their devotions unless a warrant\r\nhas been procured from a magistrate, if at the time of the meeting\r\nthere should be a magistrate within three miles of the place; if not,\r\nthe act of 1800 is to remain in full force.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, 1834, definite action was taken against the\r\neducation of free Colored persons as well as slaves. The first section\r\nis given:\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION 1. If any person shall hereafter teach any slave to read\r\n     or write, or shall aid or assist in teaching any slave to read or\r\n     write, or cause or procure any slave to be taught to read or\r\n     write, such person, if a free white person, upon conviction\r\n     thereof shall, for each and every offense against, this act, be\r\n     fined not exceeding $100 and imprisonment not more than six\r\n     months; or, if a free person of color, shall be whipped not\r\n     exceeding fifty lashes, and fined not exceeding $50, at the\r\n     discretion of the court of magistrates and freeholders before\r\n     which such free person of color is tried; and if a slave, to be\r\n     whipped, at the discretion of the court, not exceeding fifty\r\n     lashes, the informer to be entitled to one-half the fine and to\r\n     be a competent witness. And if any free person of color or slave\r\n     shall keep any school or other place of instruction for teaching\r\n     any slave or free person of color to read or write, such free\r\n     person of color or slave shall be liable to the same fine,\r\n     imprisonment, and corporal punishment as by this act are imposed\r\n     and inflicted on free persons of color and slaves for teaching\r\n     slaves to write.\"\r\n\r\nThe second section forbids, under pain of severe penalties, the\r\nemployment of any Colored persons as \"clerks or salesmen in or about\r\nany shop, store, or house used for trading.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE\r\n\r\npassed a law in 1838 establishing a system of common schools by which\r\nthe scholars were designated as \"white children over the age of six\r\nyears and under sixteen.\" In 1840 an act was passed in which no\r\ndiscrimination against color appeared. It simply provided that \"all\r\nchildren between the ages of six and twenty-one years shall have the\r\nprivilege of attending the public schools.\" And while there was never\r\nafterward any law prohibiting the education of Colored children, the\r\nschools were used exclusively by the whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAS\r\n\r\nnever put any legislation on her statute-books withholding the\r\nblessings of the schools from the Negro, for the reason, doubtless,\r\nthat she banished all free persons of color, and worked her slaves so\r\nhard that they had no hunger for books when night came.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA,\r\n\r\nunder Sir William Berkeley, was not a strong patron of education for\r\nthe masses. For the slave there was little opportunity to learn, as he\r\nwas only allowed part of Saturday to rest, and kept under the closest\r\nsurveillance on the Sabbath day. The free persons of color were\r\nregarded with suspicion, and little chance was given them to cultivate\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March, 1819, an act was passed prohibiting \"all meetings\r\nor assemblages of slaves, or free negroes, or mulattoes, mixing and\r\nassociating with such slaves, at any meeting-house or houses, or any\r\nother place or places, in the night, or at any school or schools for\r\nteaching them reading and writing either in the day or night.\" But\r\nnotwithstanding this law, schools for free persons of color were kept\r\nup until the Nat. Turner insurrection in 1831, when, on the 7th of\r\nApril following, the subjoined act was passed:\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. _And be it enacted_, That all meetings of free negroes\r\n     or mulattoes at any school-house, church, meeting-house, or other\r\n     place, for teaching them reading or writing, either in the day or\r\n     night, under whatsoever pretext, shall be deemed and considered\r\n     an unlawful assembly; and any justice of the county or\r\n     corporation wherein such assemblage shall be, either from his own\r\n     knowledge, or on the information of others of such unlawful\r\n     assemblage or meeting, shall issue his warrant directed to any\r\n     sworn officer or officers, authorizing him or them to enter the\r\n     house or houses where such unlawful assemblage or meeting may be,\r\n     for the purpose of apprehending or dispersing such free negroes\r\n     or mulattoes, and to inflict corporal punishment on the offender\r\n     or offenders, at the discretion of any justice of the peace, not\r\n     exceeding 26 lashes.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. _And be it enacted_, That if any person or persons\r\n     assemble with free negroes or mulattoes at any school-house,\r\n     church, meeting-house, or other place, for the purpose of\r\n     instructing such free negroes or mulattoes to read or write, such\r\n     persons or persons shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in a\r\n     sum not exceeding $50, and, moreover, may be imprisoned, at the\r\n     discretion of a jury, not exceeding two months.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 6. _And be it enacted_, That if any white person, for pay\r\n     or compensation, shall assemble with any slaves for the purpose\r\n     of teaching, and shall teach any slave to read or write, such\r\n     person, or any white person or persons contracting with such\r\n     teacher so to act, who shall offend as aforesaid, shall, for each\r\n     offense, be fined, at the discretion of a jury, in a sum not less\r\n     than $10, nor exceeding $100, to be recovered on an information\r\n     or indictment.\"\r\n\r\nThis law was rigidly enforced, and in 1851, Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a\r\nwhite lady from South Carolina, was cast into the Norfolk jail for\r\nviolating its provisions.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia was not admitted into the Union until 1863. Wisconsin,\r\nVermont, New Hampshire, and New Jersey did not prohibit the education\r\nof their Colored children.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\r\n\r\npresents a more pleasing and instructive field for the examination of\r\nthe curious student of history.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, the first school-house for the use of Colored pupils was\r\nerected in Washington, D. C., by three Colored men, named George Bell,\r\nNicholas Franklin, and Moses Liverpool. Not one of this trio of Negro\r\neducators knew a letter of the alphabet; but having lived as slaves in\r\nVirginia, they had learned to appreciate the opinion that learning was\r\nof great price. They secured a white teacher, named Lowe, and put\r\ntheir school in operation.\r\n\r\nAt this time the entire population of free persons amounted to 494\r\nsouls. After a brief period the school subsided, but was reorganized\r\nagain in 1818. The announcement of the opening of the school was\r\nprinted in the \"National Intelligencer\" on the 29th of August, 1818.\r\n\r\n                             \"_A School_,\r\n\r\n     Founded by an association of free people of color, of the city of\r\n     Washington, called the 'Resolute Beneficial Society,' situate\r\n     near the Eastern Public School and the dwelling of Mrs. Fenwick,\r\n     is now open for the reception of children of free people of color\r\n     and others, that ladies or gentlemen may think proper to send to\r\n     be instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar,\r\n     or other branches of education apposite to their capacities, by a\r\n     steady, active, and experienced teacher, whose attention is\r\n     wholly devoted to the purposes described. It is presumed that\r\n     free colored families will embrace the advantages thus presented\r\n     to them, either by subscribing to the funds of the society, or by\r\n     sending their children to the school. An improvement of the\r\n     intellect and morals of colored youth being the objects of this\r\n     institution, the patronage of benevolent ladies, and gentlemen,\r\n     by donation or subscription, is humbly solicited in aid of the\r\n     fund, the demands thereon being heavy and the means at present\r\n     much too limited. For the satisfaction of the public, the\r\n     constitution and articles of association are printed and\r\n     published. And to avoid disagreeable occurrences, no writings are\r\n     to be done by the teacher for a slave, neither directly nor\r\n     indirectly, to serve the purpose of a slave on any account\r\n     whatever.

The average attendance of this school was about\r\nsixty-five or seventy.\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY POTTER'S SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThe third school for Colored children in Washington was established by\r\nMr. Henry Potter, an Englishman, who opened his school about 1809, in\r\na brick building which then stood on the southeast corner of F and\r\nSeventh streets, opposite the block where the post-office building now\r\nstands. He continued there for several years and had a large school,\r\nmoving subsequently to what was then known as Clark's Row on\r\nThirteenth Street, west, between G and H streets, north.\r\n\r\nMRS. HALL'S SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Mrs. Anne Maria Hall started a school on Capitol\r\nHill, between the old Capitol and Carroll Row, on First Street, east.\r\nAfter continuing there with a full school for some ten years, she\r\nmoved to a building which stood on what is now the vacant portion of\r\nthe Casparis House lot on A Street, close to the Capitol. Some years\r\nlater she went to the First Bethel Church, and after a year or two she\r\nmoved to a house still standing on E Street, north, between Eleventh\r\nand Twelfth, west, and there taught many years. She was a Colored\r\nwoman from Prince George's County, Maryland, and had a respectable\r\neducation, which she obtained at schools with white children in\r\nAlexandria. Her husband died early, leaving her with children to\r\nsupport, and she betook herself to the work of a teacher, which she\r\nloved, and in which, for not less than twenty-five years, she met with\r\nuniform success. Her schools were all quite large, and the many who\r\nremember her as their teacher speak of her with great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. MARY BILLING'S SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nOf the early teachers of Colored schools in this district there is no\r\none whose name is mentioned with more gratitude and respect by the\r\nintelligent Colored residents than that of Mrs. Mary Billing, who\r\nestablished the first Colored school that was gathered in Georgetown.\r\nShe was an English woman; her husband, Joseph Billing, a\r\ncabinet-maker, coming from England in 1800, settled with his family\r\nthat year in Washington, and dying in 1807, left his wife with three\r\nchildren. She was well educated, a capable and good woman, and\r\nimmediately commenced teaching to support her family. At first, it is\r\nbelieved, she was connected with the Corporation School of Georgetown.\r\nIt was while in a white school certainly that her attention was\r\narrested by the wants of the Colored children, whom she was accustomed\r\nto receive into her schools, till the opposition became so marked that\r\nshe decided to make her school exclusively Colored. She was a woman of\r\nstrong religious convictions, and being English, with none of the\r\nideas peculiar to slave society, when she saw the peculiar destitution\r\nof the Colored children in the community around her, she resolved to\r\ngive her life to the class who seemed most to need her services. She\r\nestablished a Colored school about 1810, in a brick house still\r\nstanding on Dunbarton Street, opposite the Methodist church, between\r\nCongress and High streets, remaining there till the winter of\r\n1820-'21, when she came to Washington and opened a school in the house\r\non H Street, near the Foundry Church, then owned by Daniel Jones, a\r\nColored man, and still owned and occupied by a member of that family.\r\nShe died in 1826, in the fiftieth year of her age. She continued her\r\nschool till failing health, a year or so before her death, compelled\r\nits relinquishment. Her school was always large, it being patronized\r\nin Georgetown as well as afterward by the best Colored families of\r\nWashington, many of whom sent their children to her from Capitol Hill\r\nand the vicinity of the Navy Yard. Most of the better-educated Colored\r\nmen and women now living, who were school children in her time,\r\nreceived the best portion of their education from her, and they all\r\nspeak of her with a deep and tender sense of obligation. Henry Potter\r\nsucceeded her in the Georgetown school, and after him Mr. Shay, an\r\nEnglishman, who subsequently came to Washington and for many years had\r\na large Colored school in a brick building known as the Round Tops, in\r\nthe western part of the city, near the Circle, and still later\r\nremoving to the old Western Academy building, corner of I and\r\nSeventeenth streets. He was there till about 1830, when he was\r\nconvicted of assisting a slave to his freedom, and sent a term to the\r\npenitentiary. Mrs. Billing had a night school in which she was greatly\r\nassisted by Mr. Monroe, a government clerk and a Presbyterian elder,\r\nwhose devout and benevolent character is still remembered in the\r\nchurches. Mrs. Billing had scholars from Bladensburg and the\r\nsurrounding country, who came into Georgetown and boarded with her and\r\nwith others. About the time when Mrs. Billing relinquished her school\r\nin 1822 or 1823, what may be properly called\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMOTHERS SCHOOL-HOUSE,\r\n\r\nwas built by Henry Smothers on the corner of Fourteenth and H streets,\r\nnot far from the Treasury building. Smothers had a small\r\ndwelling-house on this corner, and built his school-house on the rear\r\nof the same lot. He had been long a pupil of Mrs. Billing, and had\r\nsubsequently taught a school on Washington Street, opposite the Union\r\nHotel in Georgetown. He opened his school in Washington in the old\r\ncorporation school-house, built in 1806, but some years before this\r\nperiod abandoned as a public school-house. It was known as the Western\r\nAcademy, and is still standing and used as a school-house on the\r\ncorner of I and Nineteenth streets, west. When his school-house on\r\nFourteenth and H streets was finished, his school went into the new\r\nquarters. This school was very large, numbering always more than a\r\nhundred and often as high as a hundred and fifty scholars. He taught\r\nhere about two years, and was succeeded by John W. Prout about the\r\nyear 1825. Prout was a man of ability. In 1831, May 4, there was a\r\nmeeting, says the \"National Intelligencer\" of that date, of \"the\r\ncolored citizens, large and very respectable, in the African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church,\" to consider the question of emigrating to Liberia.\r\nJohn W. Prout was chosen to preside over the assemblage, and the\r\narticle in the \"Intelligencer\" represents him as making \"a speech of\r\ndecided force and well adapted to the occasion, in support of a set of\r\nresolutions which he had drafted, and which set forth views adverse to\r\nleaving the soil that had given them birth, their true and veritable\r\nhome, _without the benefits of education_.\" The school under Prout was\r\ngoverned by a board of trustees and was organized as\r\n\r\nA FREE SCHOOL,\r\n\r\nand so continued two or three years. The number of scholars was very\r\nlarge, averaging a hundred and fifty. Mrs. Anne Maria Hall was the\r\nassistant teacher. It relied mainly for support upon subscription,\r\ntwelve and a half cents a month only being expected from each pupil,\r\nand this amount was not compulsory. The school was free to all Colored\r\nchildren, without money or price, and so continued two or three years,\r\nwhen failing of voluntary pecuniary support (it never wanted\r\nscholars), it became a regular tuition school. The school under Mr.\r\nProut was called the \"Columbian Institute,\" the name being suggested\r\nby John McLeod, the famous Irish school-master, who was a warm friend\r\nof this institution after visiting and commending the scholars and\r\nteachers, and who named his new building, in 1835, the Columbian\r\nAcademy. The days of thick darkness to the Colored people were\r\napproaching. The Nat. Turner insurrection in Southampton County,\r\nVirginia, which occurred in August, 1831, spread terror everywhere in\r\nslave communities. In this district, immediately upon that terrible\r\noccurrence, the Colored children, who had in very large numbers been\r\nreceived into the Sabbath-schools in the white churches, were all\r\nturned out of those schools. This event, though seeming to be a fiery\r\naffliction, proved a blessing in disguise. It aroused the energies of\r\nthe Colored people, taught them self-reliance, and they organized\r\nforthwith Sabbath-schools of their own. It was in the Smothers\r\nschool-house that they formed their first Sunday-school, about the\r\nyear 1832, and here they continued their very large school for several\r\nyears, the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church ultimately springing\r\nfrom the school organization. It is important to state in this\r\nconnection that\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNDAY-SCHOOL,\r\n\r\nalways an extremely important means of education for Colored people in\r\nthe days of slavery, was emphatically so in the gloomy times now upon\r\nthem. It was the Sabbath-school that taught the great mass of the free\r\npeople of color about all the school knowledge that was allowed them\r\nin those days, and hence the consternation which came upon them when\r\nthey found themselves excluded from the schools of the white churches.\r\nLindsay Muse, who has been the messenger for eighteen Secretaries of\r\nthe Navy, successively, during fifty-four years, from 1828 to the\r\npresent time, John Brown, Benjamin M. McCoy, Mr. Smallwood, Mrs.\r\nCharlotte Norris, afterward wife of Rev. Eli Nugent, and Siby McCoy,\r\nare the only survivors of the resolute little band of Colored men and\r\nwomen who gathered with and guided that Sunday-school. They had, in\r\nthe successor of Mr. Prout, a man after their own heart,\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN F. COOK,\r\n\r\nwho came into charge of this school in August, 1834, about eight years\r\nafter his aunt, Alethia Tanner, had purchased his freedom. He learned\r\nthe shoemaker's trade in his boyhood, and worked diligently, after the\r\npurchase of his freedom, to make some return to his aunt for the\r\npurchase-money. About the time of his becoming of age, he dislocated\r\nhis shoulder, which compelled him to seek other employment, and in\r\n1831, the year of his majority, he obtained the place of assistant\r\nmessenger in the Land Office. Hon. John Wilson, now Third Auditor of\r\nthe Treasury, was the messenger, and was Cook's firm friend till the\r\nday of his death. Cook had been a short time at school under the\r\ninstruction of Smothers and Prout, but when he entered the Land Office\r\nhis education was at most only the ability to stumble along a little\r\nin a primary reading-book. He, however, now gave himself in all his\r\nleisure moments, early and late, to study. Mr. Wilson remembers his\r\nindefatigable application, and affirms that it was a matter of\r\nastonishment at the time, and that he has seen nothing in all his\r\nobservations to surpass and scarcely to equal it. He was soon able to\r\nwrite a good hand, and was employed with his pen in clerical work by\r\nthe sanction of the commissioner, Elisha Hayward, who was much\r\nattached to him. Cook was now beginning to look forward to the life of\r\na teacher, which, with the ministry, was the only work not menial in\r\nits nature then open to an educated Colored man. At the end of three\r\nyears he resigned his place in the Land Office, and entered upon the\r\nwork which he laid down only with his life. It was then that he gave\r\nhimself wholly to study and the business of education, working with\r\nall his might; his school numbering quite a hundred scholars in the\r\nwinter and a hundred and fifty in the summer. He had been in his work\r\none year when the storm which had been, for some years, under the\r\ndiscussion of the slavery question, gathering over the country at\r\nlarge, burst upon this district.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW RIOT,\r\n\r\nor \"Snow storm,\" as it has been commonly called, which occurred in\r\nSeptember, 1835, is an event that stands vividly in the memory of all\r\nColored people who lived in this community at that time. Benjamin\r\nSnow, a smart Colored man, keeping a restaurant on the corner of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street, was reported to have made some\r\nremark of a bravado kind derogatory to the wives of white mechanics;\r\nwhereupon this class, or those assuming to represent them, made a\r\ndescent upon his establishment, destroying all his effects. Snow\r\nhimself, who denied using the offensive language, with difficulty\r\nescaped unharmed, through the management of white friends, taking\r\nrefuge in Canada, where he still resides. The military was promptly\r\ncalled to the rescue, at the head of which was General Walter Jones,\r\nthe eminent lawyer, who characterized the rioters, greatly to their\r\nindignation, as \"a set of ragamuffins,\" and his action was thoroughly\r\nsanctioned by the city authorities.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, also, there was a fierce excitement among the\r\nmechanics at the Navy Yard, growing out of the fact that a large\r\nquantity of copper bolts being missed from the yard and found to have\r\nbeen carried out in the dinner-pails by the hands, the commandant had\r\nforbid eating dinners in the yard. This order was interpreted as an\r\ninsult to the white mechanics, and threats were made of an assault on\r\nthe yard, which was put in a thorough state of defence by the\r\ncommandant. The rioters swept through the city, ransacking the houses\r\nof the prominent Colored men and women, ostensibly in search of\r\nanti-slavery papers and documents, the most of the gang impelled\r\nundoubtedly by hostility to the Negro race and by motives of plunder.\r\nNearly all the Colored school-houses were partially demolished and the\r\nfurniture totally destroyed, and in several cases they were completely\r\nruined. Some private houses were also torn down or burnt. The Colored\r\nschools were nearly all broken up, and it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that the Colored churches were saved from destruction, as\r\ntheir Sabbath-schools were regarded, and correctly regarded, as the\r\nmeans through which the Colored people, at that time, procured much of\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\nThe rioters sought, especially, for John F. Cook, who, however, had\r\nseasonably taken from the stable the horse of his friend, Mr. Hayward,\r\nthe Commissioner of the Land Office, an anti-slavery man, and fled\r\nprecipitately from the city. They marched to his school-house,\r\ndestroyed all the books and furniture, and partially destroyed the\r\nbuilding. Mrs. Smothers, who owned both the school-house and the\r\ndwelling adjoining the lots, was sick in her house at the time, but an\r\nalderman, Mr. Edward Dyer, with great courage and nobleness of spirit,\r\nstood between the house and the mob for her protection, declaring that\r\nhe would defend her house from molestation with all the means he could\r\ncommand. They left the house unharmed, and it is still standing on the\r\npremises. Mr. Cook went to Columbia, Pennsylvania, opened a school\r\nthere, and did not venture back to his home till the autumn of 1836.\r\nAt the time the riot broke out, General Jackson was absent in\r\nVirginia. He returned in the midst of the tumult, and immediately\r\nissuing orders in his bold, uncompromising manner to the authorities\r\nto see the laws respected at all events, the violence was promptly\r\nsubdued. It was, nevertheless, a very dark time for the Colored\r\npeople. The timid class did not for a year or two dare to send their\r\nchildren to school, and the whole mass of the Colored people dwelt in\r\nfear day and night. In August, 1836, Mr. Cook returned from\r\nPennsylvania and reopened his school, which under him had, in 1834,\r\nreceived the name of\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION SEMINARY.\r\n\r\nDuring his year's absence he was in charge of a free Colored public\r\nschool in Columbia, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which he\r\nsurrendered to the care of Benjamin M. McCoy when he came back to his\r\nhome, Mr. McCoy going there to fill out his engagement.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his work with broad and elevated ideas of his business.\r\nThis is clearly seen in the plan of his institution, embraced in the\r\nprinted annual announcements and programmes of his annual exhibitions,\r\ncopies of which have been preserved. The course of study embraced\r\nthree years, and there was a male and a female department, Miss\r\nCatharine Costin at one period being in charge of the female\r\ndepartment. Mr. Seaton, of the \"National Intelligencer,\" among other\r\nleading and enlightened citizens and public men, used to visit his\r\nschool from year to year, and watch its admirable working with deep\r\nand lively interest. Cook was at this period not only watching over\r\nhis very large school, ranging from 100 to 150 or more pupils, but was\r\nactive in the formation of the \"First Colored Presbyterian Church of\r\nWashington,\" which was organized in November, 1841, by Rev. John C.\r\nSmith, D.D., and worshipped in this school-house. He was now also\r\ngiving deep study to the preparation for the ministry, upon which, in\r\nfact, as a licentiate of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, he\r\nhad already in some degree entered. At a regular meeting of \"The\r\npresbytery of the District of Columbia,\" held in Alexandria, May 3,\r\n1842, this church, now commonly called the Fifteenth Street\r\nPresbyterian Church, was formally received under the care of that\r\npresbytery, the first and still the only Colored Presbyterian church\r\nin the district. Mr. Cook was elected the first pastor July 13, 1843,\r\nand preached his trial sermon before ordination on the evening of that\r\nday in the Fourth Presbyterian Church (Dr. J. C. Smith's) in the city,\r\nin the presence of a large congregation. This sermon is remembered as\r\na manly production, delivered with great dignity and force, and deeply\r\nimbued with the spirit of his work. He was ordained in the Fifteenth\r\nStreet Church the next evening, and continued to serve the church with\r\neminent success till his death in 1855. Rev. John C. Smith, D.D., who\r\nhad preached his ordination sermon, and been his devoted friend and\r\ncounsellor for nearly twenty years, preached his funeral sermon,\r\nselecting as his text, \"There was a man sent from God whose name was\r\nJohn.\" There were present white as well as Colored clergymen of no\r\nless than five denominations, many of the oldest and most respectable\r\ncitizens, and a vast concourse of all classes white and Colored. \"The\r\nFifteenth Street Church,\" in the words of Dr. Smith in relation to\r\nthem and their first pastor, \"is now a large and flourishing\r\ncongregation of spiritually-minded people. They have been educated in\r\nthe truth and the principles of our holy religion, and in the new,\r\npresent state of things the men of this church are trusted, relied on\r\nas those who fear God and keep His commandments. The church is the\r\nmonument to John F. Cook, the first pastor, who was faithful in all\r\nhis house, a workman who labored night and day for years, and has\r\nentered into his reward. 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.'\r\n'They rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1841, when he entered, in a preliminary and informal way, upon the\r\npastorate of the Fifteenth Street Church, he seems to have attempted\r\nto turn his seminary into a high school, limited to twenty-five or\r\nthirty pupils, exclusively for the more advanced scholars of both\r\nsexes; and his plan of studies to that end, as seen in his\r\nprospectus, evinces broad and elevated views--a desire to aid in\r\nlifting his race to higher things in education than they had yet\r\nattempted. His plans were not put into execution, in the matter of a\r\nhigh school, being frustrated by the circumstances that there were so\r\nfew good schools in the city for the Colored people, at that period,\r\nthat his old patrons would not allow him to shut off the multitude of\r\nprimary scholars which were depending upon his school. His seminary,\r\nhowever, continued to maintain its high standard, and had an average\r\nattendance of quite 100 year after year, till he surrendered up his\r\nwork in death.\r\n\r\nHe raised up a large family and educated them well. The oldest of the\r\nsons, John and George, were educated at Oberlin College. The other\r\nthree, being young, were in school when the father died. John and\r\nGeorge, it will be seen, succeeded their father as teachers,\r\ncontinuing in the business down to the present year. Of the two\r\ndaughters, the elder was a teacher till married in 1866, and the other\r\nis now a teacher in the public schools of the city. One son served\r\nthrough the war as sergeant in the Fortieth Colored Regiment, and\r\nanother served in the navy.\r\n\r\nAt the death of the father, March 21, 1855, the school fell into the\r\nhands of the son, John F. Cook, who continued it till May, 1857, when\r\nit passed to a younger son, George F. T. Cook, who moved it from its\r\nold home, the Smothers House, to the basement of the Presbyterian\r\nChurch, in the spring of 1858, and maintained it till July, 1859. John\r\nF. Cook, jr., who had erected a new school-house on Sixteenth Street,\r\nin 1862, again gathered the school which the tempests of the war had\r\ndispersed, and continued it till June, 1867, when the new order of\r\nthings had opened ample school facilities throughout the city, and the\r\nteacher was called to other duties. Thus ended the school which had\r\nbeen first gathered by Smothers nearly forty-five years before, and\r\nwhich, in that long period, had been continually maintained with\r\nseldom less than one hundred pupils, and for the most part with one\r\nhundred and fifty, the only suspensions being in the year of the Snow\r\nriot, and in the two years which ushered in the war.\r\n\r\nThe Smothers House, after the Cook school was removed in 1858, was\r\noccupied for two years by a _free Catholic school_, supported by \"The\r\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society,\" a benevolent organization of Colored\r\npeople. It was a very large school with two departments, the boys\r\nunder David Brown, and the girls under Eliza Anne Cook, and averaging\r\nover one hundred and fifty scholars. When this school was transferred\r\nto another house, Rev. Chauncey Leonard, a Colored Baptist clergyman,\r\nnow pastor of a church in Washington, and Nannie Waugh opened a school\r\nthere, in 1861, that became as large as that which had preceded it in\r\nthe same place. This school was broken up in 1862 by the destruction\r\nof the building at the hands of the incendiaries, who, even at that\r\ntime, were inspired with all their accustomed vindictiveness toward\r\nthe Colored people. But this was their last heathenish jubilee, and\r\nfrom the ashes of many burnings imperishable liberty has sprung forth.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Smothers built his school-house, in 1823,\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISA PARKE COSTIN'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\nwas established in her father's house on Capitol Hill, on A Street,\r\nsouth, under the shadow of the Capitol. This Costin family came from\r\nMount Vernon immediately after the death of Martha Washington, in\r\n1802. The father, William Costin, who died suddenly in his bed, May\r\n31, 1842, was for twenty-four years messenger for the Bank of\r\nWashington in this city. His death was noticed at length in the\r\ncolumns of the \"National Intelligencer\" in more than one communication\r\nat the time. The obituary notice, written under the suggestions of the\r\nbank officers who had previously passed a resolution expressing their\r\nrespect for his memory, and appropriating fifty dollars toward the\r\nfuneral expenses, says: \"It is due to the deceased to say that his\r\ncolored skin covered a benevolent heart\"; concluding with this\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n\"The deceased raised respectably a large family of children of his\r\nown, and, in the exercise of the purest benevolence, took into his\r\nfamily and supported four orphan children. The tears of the orphan\r\nwill moisten his grave, and his memory will be dear to all those--a\r\nnumerous class--who have experienced his kindness\"; and adding these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    \"Honor and shame from _no condition_ rise;\r\n    Act well your part--there all the honor lies.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, also, a few days afterward, in a discussion of the\r\nwrongs of slavery, alluded to the deceased in these words, \"The late\r\nWilliam Costin, though he was not white, was as much respected as any\r\nman in the district, and the large concourse of citizens that attended\r\nhis remains to the grave, as well white as black, was an evidence of\r\nthe manner in which he was estimated by the citizens of Washington.\"\r\nHis portrait, taken by the direction of the bank authorities, still\r\nhangs in the directors' room, and it may also be seen in the houses of\r\nmore than one of the old and prominent residents of the city.\r\n\r\nWilliam Costin's mother, Ann Dandridge, was the daughter of a\r\nhalf-breed (Indian and Colored), her grandfather being a Cherokee\r\nchief, and her reputed father was the father of Martha Dandridge,\r\nafterward Mrs. Custis, who, in 1759, was married to General\r\nWashington. These daughters, Ann and Martha, grew up together on the\r\nancestral plantations. William Costin's reputed father was white, and\r\nbelonged to a prominent family in Virginia, but the mother, after his\r\nbirth, married one of the Mount Vernon slaves by the name of Costin,\r\nand the son took the name of William Costin. His mother, being of\r\nIndian descent made him, under the laws of Virginia, a free-born man.\r\nIn 1800 he married Philadelphia Judge (his cousin), one of Martha\r\nWashington's slaves, at Mount Vernon, where both were born in 1780.\r\nThe wife was given by Martha Washington at her decease to her\r\ngranddaughter, Eliza Parke Custis, who was the wife of Thomas Law, of\r\nWashington. Soon after William Costin and his wife came to Washington,\r\nthe wife's freedom was secured on kind and easy terms, and the\r\nchildren were all born free. This is the account which William Costin\r\nand his wife and his mother, Ann Dandridge, always gave of their\r\nancestry, and they were persons of great precision in all matters of\r\nfamily history, as well as of the most marked scrupulousness in their\r\nstatements. Their seven children, five daughters and two sons, went to\r\nschool with the white children on Capitol Hill, to Mrs. Maria Haley\r\nand other teachers. The two younger daughters, Martha and Frances,\r\nfinished their education at the Colored convent in Baltimore. Louisa\r\nParke and Ann had passed their school days before the convent was\r\nfounded. Louisa Parke Costin opened her school at nineteen years of\r\nage, continuing it with much success till her sudden death in 1831,\r\nthe year in which her mother also died. When Martha returned from the\r\nconvent seminary, a year or so later, she reopened the school,\r\ncontinuing it till about 1839. This school, which was maintained some\r\nfifteen years, was always very full. The three surviving sister own\r\nand reside in the house which their father built about 1812. One of\r\nthese sisters married Richard Henry Fisk, a Colored man of good\r\neducation, who died in California, and she now has charge of the\r\nSenate ladies' reception-room. Ann Costin was for several years in the\r\nfamily of Major Lewis (at Woodlawn, Mount Vernon), the nephew of\r\nWashington. Mrs. Lewis (Eleanor Custis) was the granddaughter of\r\nMartha Washington. This school was not molested by the mob of 1835,\r\nand it was always under the care of a well-bred and well-educated\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESLEYAN SEMINARY.\r\n\r\nWhile Martha Costin was teaching, James Enoch Ambush, a Colored man,\r\nhad also a large school in the basement of the Israel Bethel Church,\r\non Capitol Hill, for a while, commencing there in April, 1833, and\r\ncontinuing in various places till 1843, when he built a school-house\r\non E Street, south, near Tenth, island, and established what was known\r\nas \"The Wesleyan Seminary,\" and which was successfully maintained for\r\nthirty-two years, till the close of August, 1865. The school-house\r\nstill stands, a comfortable one-story wooden structure, with the sign\r\n\"Wesleyan Seminary\" over the door, as it has been there for\r\ntwenty-five years. This was the only Colored school on the island of\r\nany account for many years, and in its humble way it accomplished a\r\ngreat amount of good. For some years Mr. Ambush had given much study\r\nto botanic medicine, and since closing his school he has become a\r\nbotanic physician. He is a man of fine sense, and without school\r\nadvantages, has acquired a respectable education.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMINARY FOR COLORED GIRLS.\r\n\r\nThe first seminary in the District of Columbia for Colored girls was\r\nestablished in Georgetown, in 1827, under the special auspices of\r\nFather Vanlomen, a benevolent and devout Catholic priest, then pastor\r\nof the Holy Trinity Church, who not only gave this interesting\r\nenterprise his hand and his heart, but for several years himself\r\ntaught a school of Colored boys three days in a week, near the\r\nGeorgetown college gate, in a small frame house, which was afterward\r\nfamous as the residence of the broken-hearted widow of Commodore\r\nDecatur. This female seminary was under the care of Maria Becraft, who\r\nwas the most remarkable Colored young woman of her time in the\r\ndistrict, and, perhaps, of any time. Her father, William Becraft, born\r\nwhile his mother, a free woman, was the housekeeper of Charles\r\nCarroll, of Carrollton, always had the kindest attentions of this\r\ngreat man, and there are now pictures, more than a century and a half\r\nold, and other valuable relics from the Carroll family in the\r\npossession of the Becraft family, in Georgetown, which Charles\r\nCarroll, of Carrollton, in his last days presented to William Becraft\r\nas family keepsakes. William Becraft lived in Georgetown sixty-four\r\nyears, coming there when eighteen years of age. He was for many years\r\nchief steward of Union Hotel, and a remarkable man, respected and\r\nhonored by everybody. When he died, the press of the district noticed,\r\nin a most prominent manner, his life and character. From one of the\r\nextended obituary notices, marked with heavy black lines, the\r\nfollowing paragraph is copied:\r\n\r\n     \"He was among the last surviving representatives of the old\r\n     school of well-bred, confidential, and intelligent domestics, and\r\n     was widely known at home and abroad from his connection, in the\r\n     capacity of steward for a long series of years, and probably from\r\n     its origin, and until a recent date, with the Union Hotel,\r\n     Georgetown, with whose guests, for successive generations, his\r\n     benevolent and venerable aspect, dignified and obliging manners,\r\n     and moral excellence, rendered him a general favorite.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Becraft was marked, from her childhood, for her uncommon\r\nintelligence and refinement, and for her extraordinary piety. She was\r\nborn in 1805, and first went to school for a year to Henry Potter, in\r\nWashington, about 1812; afterward attending Mrs. Billing's school\r\nconstantly till 1820. She then, at the age of fifteen, opened a school\r\nfor girls in Dunbarton Street, in Georgetown, and gave herself to the\r\nwork, which she loved, with the greatest assiduity, and with uniform\r\nsuccess. In 1827, when she was twenty-two years of age, her remarkable\r\nbeauty and elevation of character so much impressed Father Vanlomen,\r\nthe good priest, that he took it in hand to give her a higher style of\r\nschool in which to work for her sex and race, to the education of\r\nwhich she had now fully consecrated herself. Her school was\r\naccordingly transferred to a larger building, which still stands on\r\nFayette Street, opposite the convent, and there she opened a boarding\r\nand day school for Colored girls, which she continued with great\r\nsuccess till August, 1831, when she surrendered her little seminary\r\ninto the care of one of the girls that she had trained, and in October\r\nof that year joined the convent at Baltimore as a Sister of\r\nProvidence, where she was the leading teacher till she died, in\r\nDecember, 1833, a great loss to that young institution, which was\r\ncontemplating this noble young woman as its future Mother Superior.\r\nHer seminary in Georgetown averaged from thirty to thirty-five pupils,\r\nand there are those living who remember the troop of girls, dressed\r\nuniformly, which was wont to follow in procession their pious and\r\nrefined teacher to devotions on the Sabbath at Holy Trinity Church.\r\nThe school comprised girls from the best Colored families of\r\nGeorgetown, Washington, Alexandria, and surrounding country. The\r\nsisters of the Georgetown convent were the admirers of Miss Becraft,\r\ngave her instruction, and extended to her most heartfelt aid and\r\napprobation in all her noble work, as they were in those days wont to\r\ndo in behalf of the aspiring Colored girls who sought for education,\r\nwithholding themselves from such work only when a depraved and\r\ndegenerate public sentiment upon the subject of educating the Colored\r\npeople had compelled them to a more rigid line of demarcation between\r\nthe races. Ellen Simonds and others conducted the school a few years,\r\nbut with the loss of its original teacher it began to fail, and\r\nfinally became extinct. Maria Becraft is remembered, wherever she was\r\nknown, as a woman of the rarest sweetness and exaltation of Christian\r\nlife, graceful and attractive in person and manners, gifted,\r\nwell-educated, and wholly devoted to doing good. Her name as a Sister\r\nof Providence was Sister Aloyons.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS MYRTILLA MINER'S SEMINARY\r\n\r\nfor Colored girls was initiated in Washington. This philanthropic\r\nwoman was born in Brookfield, Madison County, New York, in 1815. Her\r\nparents were farmers, with small resources for the support of a large\r\nfamily. The children were obliged to work, and the small advantages of\r\na common school were all the educational privileges furnished to them.\r\nHop-raising was a feature in their farming, and this daughter was\r\naccustomed to work in the autumn, picking the hops. She was of a\r\ndelicate physical organization, and suffered exceedingly all her life\r\nwith spinal troubles. Being a girl of extraordinary intellectual\r\nactivity, her place at home chafed her spirit. She was restless,\r\ndissatisfied with her lot, looked higher than her father, dissented\r\nfrom his ideas of woman's education, and, in her desperation, when\r\nabout twenty-three years old, wrote to Mr. Seward, then recently\r\nelected Governor of her State, asking him if he could show her how it\r\nwas possible for a woman in her circumstances to become a scholar;\r\nreceiving from him the reply that he could not, but hoped a better day\r\nwas coming, wherein woman might have a chance to be and to do to the\r\nextent of her abilities. Hearing at this time of a school at Clinton,\r\nOneida County, New York, for young women, on the manual-labor system,\r\nshe decided to go there; but her health being such as to make manual\r\nlabor impossible at the time, she wrote to the principal of the Clover\r\nStreet Seminary, Rochester, New York, who generously received her,\r\ntaking her notes for the school bills, to be paid after completing her\r\neducation. Grateful for this noble act, she afterward sent her younger\r\nsister there to be educated, for her own associate as a teacher; and\r\nthe death of this talented sister, when about to graduate and come as\r\nher assistant in Washington, fell upon her with crushing force. In the\r\nRochester school, with Myrtilla Miner, were two free Colored girls,\r\nand this association was the first circumstance to turn her thoughts\r\nto the work to which she gave her life. From Rochester she went to\r\nMississippi, as a teacher of planters' daughters, and it was what she\r\nwas compelled to see, in this situation, of the dreadful practices and\r\nconditions of slavery, that filled her soul with a pity for the\r\nColored race, and a detestation of the system that bound them, which\r\nheld possession of her to the last day of her life. She remained there\r\nseveral years, till her indignant utterances, which she would not\r\nwithhold, compelled her employer, fearful of the results, to part\r\nreluctantly with a teacher whom he valued. She came home broken down\r\nwith sickness, caused by the harassing sights and sounds that she had\r\nwitnessed in plantation life, and while in this condition she made a\r\nsolemn vow that whatever of life remained to her should be given to\r\nthe work of ameliorating the condition of the Colored people. Here her\r\ngreat work begins. She made up her mind to do something for the\r\neducation of free Colored girls, with the idea that through the\r\ninfluence of educated Colored women she could lay the solid\r\nfoundations for the disenthrallment of their race. She selected the\r\ndistrict for the field of her efforts, because it was the common\r\nproperty of the nation, and because the laws of the district gave her\r\nthe right to educate _free_ Colored children, and she attempted to\r\nteach none others. She opened her plan to many of the leading friends\r\nof freedom, in an extensive correspondence, but found especially, at\r\nthis time, a wise and warm encourager and counsellor in her scheme, in\r\nWilliam R. Smith, a Friend, of Farmington, near Rochester, New York,\r\nin whose family she was now a private teacher. Her correspondents\r\ngenerally gave her but little encouragement, but wished her God-speed\r\nin what she should dare in the good cause. One Friend wrote her from\r\nPhiladelphia; entering warmly into her scheme, but advised her to wait\r\ntill funds could be collected. \"I do not want the wealth of Croesus,\"\r\nwas her reply; and the Friend sent her $100, and with this capital, in\r\nthe autumn of 1851, she came to Washington to establish a Normal\r\nSchool for the education of Colored girls, having associated with her\r\nMiss Anna Inman, an accomplished and benevolent lady of the Society of\r\nFriends, from Southfield, Rhode Island, who, however, after teaching a\r\nclass of Colored girls in French, in the house of Jonathan Jones, on\r\nthe island, through the winter, returned to New England. In the autumn\r\nof 1851 Miss Miner commenced her remarkable work here in a small room,\r\nabout fourteen feet square, in the frame house then, as now, owned and\r\noccupied by Edward C. Younger, a Colored man, as his dwelling, on\r\nEleventh Street, near New York Avenue. With but two or three girls to\r\nopen the school, she soon had a roomful, and to secure larger\r\naccommodation, moved, after a couple of months, to a house on F\r\nStreet, north, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets, west, near\r\nthe houses then occupied by William T. Carroll and Charles H. Winder.\r\nThis house furnished her a very comfortable room for her school, which\r\nwas composed of well-behaved girls from the best Colored families of\r\nthe district. The persecution of those neighbors, however, compelled\r\nher to leave, as the Colored family who occupied the house was\r\nthreatened with conflagration, and after one month her little school\r\nfound a more unmolested home in the dwelling-house of a German family\r\non K Street, near the western market. After tarrying a few months\r\nhere, she moved to L Street, into a room in the building known, as\r\n\"The Two Sisters,\" then occupied by a white family. She now saw that\r\nthe success of her school demanded a school-house, and in\r\nreconnoitring the ground she found a spot suiting her ideas as to size\r\nand locality, with a house on it, and in the market at a low price.\r\nShe raised the money, secured the spot, and thither, in the summer of\r\n1851, she moved her school, where for seven years she was destined to\r\nprosecute, with the most unparalleled energy and conspicuous success,\r\nher remarkable enterprise. This lot, comprising an entire square of\r\nthree acres, between Nineteenth and Twentieth streets, west, N and O\r\nstreets, north, and New Hampshire Avenue, selected under the guidance\r\nof Miss Miner, the contract being perfected through the agency of\r\nSayles J. Bowen, Thomas Williamson, and Allen M. Gangewer, was\r\noriginally conveyed in trust to Thomas Williamson and Samuel Rhodes,\r\nof the Society of Friends, in Philadelphia. It was purchased of the\r\nexecutors of the will of John Taylor, for $4,000, the deed being\r\nexecuted June 8, 1853, the estimated value of the property now being\r\nnot less than $30,000. The money was mainly contributed by Friends, in\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and New England. Catharine Morris, a Friend,\r\nof Philadelphia, was a liberal benefactor of the enterprise, advancing\r\nMiss Miner $2,000, with which to complete the purchase of the lot, the\r\nmost, if not all, of which sum, it is believed, she ultimately gave to\r\nthe institution; and Harriet Beecher Stowe was another generous\r\nfriend, who gave her money and her heart to the support of the brave\r\nwoman who had been willing to go forth alone at the call of duty. Mr.\r\nRhodes, some years editor of the \"Friends' Quarterly Review,\" died\r\nseveral years ago, near Philadelphia. Mr. Williamson, a conveyancer in\r\nthat city, and father of Passmore Williamson, is still living, but\r\nsome years ago declined the place of trustee. The board, at the date\r\nof the act of incorporation, consisted of Benjamin Tatham, a Friend,\r\nof New York City, Mrs. Nancy M. Johnson, of Washington, and Myrtilla\r\nMiner, and the transfer of the property to the incorporated body was\r\nmade a few weeks prior to Miss Miner's death. This real estate,\r\ntogether with a fund of $4,000 in government stocks, is now in the\r\nhands of a corporate body, under act of Congress approved March 3,\r\n1863, and is styled \"The Institution for the Education of Colored\r\nYouth in the District of Columbia.\" The officers of the corporation at\r\nthis time are John C. Underwood, president; Francis G. Shaw,\r\ntreasurer; George E. Baker, secretary; who, with Nancy M. Johnson, S.\r\nJ. Bowen, Henry Addison, and Rachel Howland, constitute the executive\r\ncommittee. The purpose of the purchase of this property is declared,\r\nin a paper signed by Mr. Williamson and Mr. Rhodes, dated\r\nPhiladelphia, June 8, 1858, to have been \"_especially for the\r\neducation of colored girls_.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper also declares that \"the grounds were purchased at the\r\nspecial instance of Myrtilla Miner,\" and that \"the contributions by\r\nwhich the original price of said lot, and also the cost of the\r\nsubsequent improvements thereof, were procured chiefly by her\r\ninstrumentality and labors.\" The idea of Miss Miner in planting a\r\nschool here was to train up a class of Colored girls, in the midst of\r\nslave institutions, who should show forth in their culture and\r\ncapabilities, to the country and to mankind, that the race was fit for\r\nsomething higher than the degradation which rested upon them. The\r\namazing energy with which this frail woman prosecuted her work is well\r\nknown to those who took knowledge of her career. She visited the\r\nColored people of her district from house to house, and breathed a new\r\nlife into them pertaining to the education of their daughters. Her\r\ncorrespondence with the philanthropic men and women of the North was\r\nimmense. She importuned Congressmen, and the men who shaped public\r\nsentiment through the columns of the press, to come into her school\r\nand see her girls, and was ceaseless in her activities day and night,\r\nin every direction, to build up, in dignity and refinement, her\r\nseminary, and to force its merits upon public attention.\r\n\r\nThe buildings upon the lot when purchased--a small frame dwelling of\r\ntwo stories, not more than twenty-five by thirty-five feet in\r\ndimensions, with three small cabins on the other side of the\r\npremises--served for the seminary and the homes of the teacher and her\r\nassistant. The most aspiring and decently bred Colored girls of the\r\ndistrict were gathered into the school; and the very best Colored\r\nteachers in the schools, of the district at the present time, are\r\namong those who owe their education to this self-sacrificing teacher\r\nand her school. Mrs. Means, aunt of the wife of General Pierce, then\r\nPresident of the United States, attracted by the enthusiasm of this\r\nwonderful person, often visited her in the midst of her work, with the\r\nkindest feelings; and the fact that the carriage from the Presidential\r\nmansion was in this way frequently seen at the door of this humble\r\ninstitution, did much to protect it from the hatred with which it was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward and his family were very often seen at the school, both\r\nMrs. Seward and her daughter Fanny being constant visitors; the\r\nlatter, a young girl at the time, often spending a whole day there.\r\nMany other Congressmen of large and generous instincts, some of them\r\nof pro-slavery party relations, went out there, all confessing their\r\nadmiration of the resolute woman and her school, and this kept evil\r\nmen in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the school throughout the district was strong and\r\nvery general, among the old as well as the young. Even Walter Lenox,\r\nwho, as mayor, when the school was first started, gave the teacher\r\nassurances of favor in her work, came out in 1857, following the\r\nprevailing current of depraved public sentiment and feeding its tide,\r\nin an elaborate article in the \"National Intelligencer,\" under his own\r\nsignature; assailed the school in open and direct language, urging\r\nagainst it that it was raising the standard of education among the\r\nColored population, and distinctly declaring that the white population\r\nof the district would not be just to themselves to permit the\r\ncontinuance of an institution which had the temerity to extend to the\r\nColored people \"a degree of instruction so far beyond their social and\r\npolitical condition, which condition must continue,\" the article goes\r\non to say, \"in this and every other slave-holding community.\" This\r\narticle, though fraught with extreme ideas, and to the last degree\r\nprescriptive and inflammatory, neither stirred any open violence, nor\r\ndeterred the courageous woman in the slightest degree from her work.\r\nWhen madmen went to her school-room threatening her with personal\r\nviolence, she laughed them to shame; and when they threatened to burn\r\nher house, she told them that they could not stop her in that way, as\r\nanother house, better than the old, would immediately rise from its\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nThe house was set on fire in the spring of 1860, when Miss Miner was\r\nasleep in the second story, alone, in the night-time, but the smell of\r\nthe smoke awakened her in time to save the building and herself from\r\nthe flames, which were extinguished. The school-girls, also, were\r\nconstantly at the mercy of coarse and insulting boys along the\r\nstreets, who would often gather in gangs before the gate to pursue and\r\nterrify these inoffensive children, who were striving to gather wisdom\r\nand understanding in their little sanctuary. The police took no\r\ncognizance of such brutality in those days. But their dauntless\r\nteacher, uncompromising, conscientious, and self-possessed in her\r\naggressive work, in no manner turned from her course by this\r\npersecution, was, on the other hand, stimulated thereby to higher\r\nvigilance and energy in her great undertaking. The course of\r\ninstruction in the school was indeed of a higher order than had\r\nhitherto been opened to the Colored people of the district, as was\r\ndenounced against the school by Walter Lenox, in his newspaper attack.\r\nLectures upon scientific and literary subjects were given by\r\nprofessional and literary gentlemen, who were friends to the cause.\r\nThe spacious grounds afforded to each pupil an ample space for a\r\nflower bed, which she was enjoined to cultivate with her own hands and\r\nto thoroughly study. And an excellent library, a collection of\r\npaintings and engravings, the leading magazines and choice newspapers,\r\nwere gathered and secured for the humble home of learning, which was\r\nall the while filled with students, the most of whom were bright,\r\nambitious girls, composing a female Colored school, which, in dignity\r\nand usefulness, has had no equal in the district since that day. It\r\nwas her custom to gather in her vacations and journeys not only money,\r\nbut every thing else that would be of use in her school, and in this\r\nway she not only collected books, but maps, globes, philosophical, and\r\nchemical, and mathematical apparatus, and a great variety of things to\r\naid in her instruction in illustrating all branches of knowledge. This\r\ncollection was stored in the school building during the war, and was\r\ndamaged by neglect, plundered by soldiers, and what remains is not of\r\nmuch value. The elegant sofa-bedstead which she used during all her\r\nyears in the seminary, and which would be an interesting possession\r\nfor the seminary, was sold, with her other personal effects, to Dr.\r\nCarrie Brown (Mrs. Winslow), of Washington, one of her bosom friends,\r\nwho stood at her pillow when she died.\r\n\r\nHer plan embraced the erection of spacious structures, upon the site\r\nwhich had been most admirably chosen, complete in all their\r\nappointments for the full accommodation of a school of one hundred and\r\nfifty boarding scholars. The seminary was to be a female college,\r\nendowed with all the powers and professorships belonging to a\r\nfirst-class college for the other sex. She did not contemplate its\r\nspringing up into such proportions, like a mushroom, in a single\r\nnight, but it was her ambition that the institution should one day\r\nattain that rank. In the midst of her anxious, incessant labors, her\r\nphysical system began so sensibly to fail, that in the summer of 1858,\r\nunder the counsel of the friends of herself and her cause, she went\r\nNorth to seek health, and, as usual in all her journeys, to beg for\r\nher seminary, leaving her girls in the care of Emily Howland, a noble\r\nyoung woman, who came down here for the love of the cause, without\r\nmoney and without price, from the vicinity of Auburn, New York. In the\r\nautumn, Miss Miner returned to her school; Miss Howland still\r\ncontinuing with her through the winter, a companion in her trials,\r\naiding her in her duties, and consenting to take charge of the school\r\nagain in the summer of 1859, while Miss Miner was on another journey\r\nfor funds and health. In the autumn of that year, after returning from\r\nher journey, which was not very successful she determined to suspend\r\nthe school, and to go forth into the country with a most persistent\r\nappeal for money to erect a seminary building, as she had found it\r\nimpossible to get a house of any character started with the means\r\nalready in her hands. She could get no woman, whom she deemed fit to\r\ntake her work, willing to continue her school, and in the spring of\r\n1860, leasing the premises, she went North on her errand. In the\r\nensuing year she traversed many States, but the shadow of the\r\nRebellion was on her path, and she gathered neither much money nor\r\nmuch strength. The war came, and in October, 1862, hoping, but vainly,\r\nfor health from a sea-voyage and from the Pacific climate, she sailed\r\nfrom New York to California. When about to return, in 1866, with\r\nvivacity of body and spirit, she was thrown from a carriage in a\r\nfearful manner; blighting all the high hopes of resuming her school\r\nunder the glowing auspices she had anticipated, as she saw the\r\nRebellion and the hated system tumbling to pieces. She arrived in New\r\nYork, in August of that year, in a most shattered condition of body,\r\nthough with the fullest confidence that she should speedily be well\r\nand at her work in Washington. In the first days of December she went\r\nto Washington in a dying condition, still resolute to resume her work;\r\nwas carried to the residence of her tried friend, Mrs. Nancy M.\r\nJohnson; and on the tenth of that month, surrounded by the friends who\r\nhad stood with her in other days, she put off her wasted and wearied\r\nbody in the city which had witnessed her trials and her triumphs, and\r\nher remains slumber in Oak Hill Cemetery.\r\n\r\nHer seminary engaged her thoughts to the last day of her life. She\r\nsaid in her last hours that she had come back here to resume her work,\r\nand could not leave it thus unfinished. No marble marks the\r\nresting-place of this truly wonderful woman, but her memory is\r\ncertainly held precious in the hearts of her throngs of pupils, in the\r\nhearts of the Colored people of this district, and of all who took\r\nknowledge of her life, and who reverenced the cause in which she\r\noffered herself a willing sacrifice. Her assistants in the school were\r\nHelen Moore, of Washington; Margaret Clapp, Amanda Weaver, and Anna H.\r\nSearing, of New York State, and two of her pupils, Matilda Jones, of\r\nWashington, and Emma Brown, of Georgetown, both of whom subsequently,\r\nthrough the influence of Miss Miner and Miss Howland, finished their\r\neducation at Oberlin, and have since been most superior teachers in\r\nWashington. Most of the assistant teachers from the North were from\r\nfamilies connected with the Society of Friends, and it has been seen\r\nthat the bulk of the money came from that society. The sketch would be\r\nincomplete without a special tribute to Lydia B. Mann, sister of\r\nHorace Mann, who came here in the fall of 1856, from the Colored\r\nFemale Orphan Asylum of Providence, R. I., of which she was then, as\r\nshe continues to be, the admirable superintendent, and, as a pure\r\nlabor of love, took care of the school in the most superior manner\r\nthrough the autumn and winter, while Miss Miner was North recruiting\r\nher strength and pleading for contributions. It was no holiday duty to\r\ngo into that school, live in that building, and work alone with head\r\nand hands, as was done by all those refined and educated women who\r\nstood from time to time in that humble, persecuted seminary. Miss Mann\r\nis gratefully remembered by her pupils here and their friends.\r\n\r\nMention should also be made of Emily Howland, who stood by Miss Miner\r\nin her darkest days, and whose whole heart was with her in all her\r\nwork. She is a woman of the largest and most self-sacrificing\r\npurposes, who has been and still is giving her best years, all her\r\npowers, talents, learning, refinement, wealth, and personal toil, to\r\nthe education and elevation of the Colored race. While here she\r\nadopted, and subsequently educated in the best manner, one of Miss\r\nMiner's pupils, and assisted several others of her smart girls in\r\ncompleting their education at Oberlin. During the war she was teaching\r\ncontrabands in the hospital and the camp, and is now engaged in\r\nplanting a colony of Colored people in Virginia with homes and a\r\nschool-house of their own.\r\n\r\nA seminary, such as was embraced in the plan of Miss Miner, is\r\nexceedingly demanded by the interest of Colored female education in\r\nthe District of Columbia and the country at large, and any scheme by\r\nwhich the foundations that she laid so well may become the seat of\r\nsuch a school, would be heartily approved by all enlightened friends\r\nof the Colored race. The trustees of the Miner property, not\r\ninsensible of their responsibilities, have been carefully watching for\r\nthe moment when action on their part would seem to be justified. They\r\nhave repeatedly met in regard to the matter, but, in their counsels,\r\nhitherto, have deemed it wise to wait further developments. They are\r\nnow about to hold another meeting, it is understood, and it is to be\r\ndevoutly hoped that some plan will be adopted by which a school of a\r\nhigh order may be, in due time, opened for Colored girls in this\r\ndistrict, who exceedingly need the refining, womanly training of such\r\na school.\r\n\r\nThe original corporators of Miss Miner's institution were Henry\r\nAddison, John C. Underwood, George C. Abbott, William H. Channing,\r\nNancy M. Johnson, and Myrtilla Miner. The objects, as expressed in the\r\ncharter, \"are to educate and improve the moral and intellectual\r\ncondition of such of the colored youth of the nation as may be placed\r\nunder its care and influence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY WORMLEY'S SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, William Wormley built a school-house for his sister Mary,\r\nnear the corner of Vermont Avenue and I Street, where the restaurant\r\nestablishment owned and occupied by his brother, James Wormley, now\r\nstands. He had educated his sister expressly for a teacher, at great\r\nexpense, at the Colored Female Seminary in Philadelphia, then in\r\ncharge of Miss Sarah Douglass, an accomplished Colored lady, who is\r\nstill a teacher of note in the Philadelphia Colored High School.\r\nWilliam Wormley was at that time a man of wealth. His livery-stable,\r\nwhich occupied the place where the Owen House now stands, was one of\r\nthe largest and best in the city. Miss Wormley had just brought her\r\nschool into full and successful operation when her health broke down,\r\nand she lived scarcely two years. Mr. Calvert, an English gentleman,\r\nstill living in the first ward, taught a class of Colored scholars in\r\nthis house for a time, and James Wormley was one of the class. In the\r\nautumn of 1834, William Thomas Lee opened a school in the same place,\r\nand it was in a flourishing condition in the fall of 1835, when the\r\nSnow mob dispersed it, sacking the school-house, and partially\r\ndestroying it by fire. William Wormley was at that time one of the\r\nmost enterprising and influential Colored men of Washington, and was\r\nthe original agent of the \"Liberator\" newspaper for this district.\r\nThe mob being determined to lay hold of him and Lee, they fled from\r\nthe city to save their lives, returning when General Jackson, coming\r\nback from Virginia a few days after the outbreak, gave notice that the\r\nfugitives should be protected. The persecution of William Wormley was\r\nso violent and persistent, that his health and spirits sank under its\r\neffects, his business was broken up, and he died a poor man, scarcely\r\nowning a shelter for his dying couch. The school-house was repaired\r\nafter the riot, and occupied for a time by Margaret Thompson's school,\r\nand still stands in the rear of James Wormley's restaurant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN M'COY'S, AND OTHER SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nAbout this time another school was opened in Georgetown, by Nancy\r\nGrant, a sister of Mrs. William Becraft, a well-educated Colored\r\nwoman. She was teaching as early as 1828, and had a useful school for\r\nseveral years. Mr. Nuthall, an Englishman, was teaching in Georgetown\r\nduring this period, and as late as 1833 he went to Alexandria and\r\nopened a school in that city. William Syphax, among others now\r\nresident in Washington, attended his school in Alexandria about 1833.\r\nHe was a man of ability, well educated, and one of the best teachers\r\nof his time in the district. His school in Georgetown was at first in\r\nDunbarton Street, and afterward on Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe old maxim, that \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the\r\nChurch,\" seems to find its illustration in this history. There is no\r\nperiod in the annals of the country in which the fires of persecution\r\nagainst the education of the Colored race burned more fiercely in this\r\ndistrict, and the country at large, than in the five years from 1831\r\nto 1836, and it was during this period that a larger number of\r\nrespectable Colored schools were established than in any other five\r\nyears prior to the war. In 1833, the same year in which Ambush's\r\nschool was started, Benjamin M. McCoy, a Colored man, opened a school\r\nin the northern part of the city, on L Street, between Third and\r\nFourth streets, west. In 1834 he moved to Massachusetts Avenue,\r\ncontinuing his school there till he went to Lancaster County,\r\nPennsylvania, in the autumn of 1836, to finish the engagement of Rev.\r\nJohn F. Cook, who came back to Washington at that time and re-opened\r\nhis school. The school at Lancaster was a free public Colored school,\r\nand Mr. McCoy was solicited to continue another year; but declining,\r\ncame back, and in 1837 opened a school in the basement of Asbury\r\nChurch, which, in that room and in the house adjoining, he maintained\r\nwith great success for the ensuing twelve years. Mr. McCoy was a pupil\r\nof Mrs. Billing and Henry Smothers; is a man of good sense, and his\r\nschool gave a respectable rudimental education to multitudes, who\r\nremember him as a teacher with great respect. He is now a messenger in\r\nthe Treasury Department. In 1833, a school was established by Fanny\r\nHampton, in the western part of the city, on the northwest corner of K\r\nand Nineteenth streets. It was a large school, and was continued till\r\nabout 1842, the teacher dying soon afterward. She was half-sister of\r\nLindsay Muse. Margaret Thompson succeeded her, and had a flourishing\r\nschool of some forty scholars on Twenty-sixth Street, near the avenue,\r\nfor several years, about 1846. She subsequently became the wife of\r\nCharles H. Middleton, and assisted in his school for a brief time.\r\nAbout 1830, Robert Brown commenced a small school, and continued it at\r\nintervals for many years till his death. As early as 1833, there was a\r\nschool opened in a private house in the rear of Franklin Row, near the\r\nlocation of the new Franklin School building. It was taught by a white\r\nman, Mr. Talbot, and continued a year or two. Mrs. George Ford, a\r\nwhite teacher, a native of Virginia, kept a Colored school in a brick\r\nhouse still standing on New Jersey Avenue, between K and L streets.\r\nShe taught there many years, and as early, perhaps, as half a century\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. JOHN H. FLEET'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\nwas opened, in 1836, on New York Avenue, in a school-house which stood\r\nnearly on the spot now occupied by the Richards buildings at the\r\ncorner of New York Avenue and Fourteenth Street. It had been\r\npreviously used for a white school, taught by Mrs. McDaniel, and was\r\nsubsequently again so used. Dr. Fleet was a native of Georgetown, and\r\nwas greatly assisted in his education by the late Judge James Morsell,\r\nof that city, who was not only kind to this family, but was always\r\nregarded by the Colored people of the district as their firm friend\r\nand protector. John H. Fleet, with his brothers and sisters, went to\r\nthe Georgetown Lancasterian School, with the white children, for a\r\nlong period, in their earlier school days, and subsequently to other\r\nwhite schools. He was also for a time a pupil of Smothers and Prout.\r\nHe was possessed of a brilliant and strong intellect, inherited from\r\nhis father, who was a white man of distinguished abilities. He studied\r\nmedicine in Washington, in the office of Dr. Thomas Henderson, who had\r\nresigned as assistant surgeon in the army, and was a practising\r\nphysician of eminence in Washington. He also attended medical lectures\r\nat the old medical college, corner of Tenth and E streets. It was his\r\nintention at that time to go to Liberia, and his professional\r\neducation was conducted under the auspices of the Colonization\r\nSociety. This, with the influence of Judge Morsell, gave him\r\nprivileges never extended here to any other Colored man. He decided,\r\nhowever, not to go to Liberia, and in 1836 opened his school. He was a\r\nrefined and polished gentleman, and conceded to be the foremost\r\nColored man in culture, in intellectual force, and general influence\r\nin this district at that time. His school-house on New York Avenue was\r\nburned by an incendiary about 1843, and his flourishing and excellent\r\nschool was thus ended. For a time he subsequently taught music, in\r\nwhich he was very proficient; but about 1846 he opened a school on\r\nSchool-house Hill, in the Hobbrook Military School building, near the\r\ncorner of N Street, north, and Twenty-third Street, west, and had a\r\nlarge school there till about 1851, when he relinquished the business,\r\ngiving his attention henceforth exclusively to music, and with eminent\r\nsuccess. He died in 1861. His school was very large and of a superior\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES H. MIDDLETON'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\nwas started in the same section of the city, in a school-house which\r\nthen stood, near the corner of Twenty-second Street, west, and I,\r\nnorth, and which had been used by Henry Hardy for a white school.\r\nThough both Fleet's and Johnson's schools were in full tide of success\r\nin that vicinity, he gathered a good school, and when his two\r\ncompetitors retired--as they both did about this time,--his school\r\nabsorbed a large portion of their patronage, and was thronged. In\r\n1852, he went temporarily with his school to Sixteenth Street, and\r\nthence to the basement of Union Bethel Church on M Street, near\r\nSixteenth, in which, during the administration of President Pierce, he\r\nhad an exceedingly large and excellent school, at the same period when\r\nMiss Miner was prosecuting her signal work. Mr. Middleton, now a\r\nmessenger in the Navy Department, a native of Savannah, Ga., is\r\nfree-born, and received his very good education in schools in that\r\ncity, sometimes with white and sometimes with Colored children. When\r\nhe commenced his school he had just returned from the Mexican war, and\r\nhis enterprise is especially worthy of being made prominent, not only\r\nbecause of his high style as a teacher, but also because it is\r\nassociated with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MOVEMENT FOR A FREE COLORED PUBLIC SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThis movement originated with a city officer, Jesse E. Dow, who, in\r\n1848 and 1849, was a leading and influential member of the common\r\ncouncil. He encouraged Mr. Middleton to start his school, by assuring\r\nhim that he would give all his influence to the establishment of free\r\nschools for Colored as well as for white children, and that he had\r\ngreat confidence that the council would be brought to give at least\r\nsome encouragement to the enterprise. In 1850 Mr. Dow was named among\r\nthe candidates for the mayoralty; and when his views in this regard\r\nwere assailed by his opponents, he did not hesitate to boldly avow his\r\nopinions, and to declare that he wished no support for any office\r\nwhich demanded of him any modification of these convictions. The\r\nworkmen fail, but the work succeeds. The name of Jesse E. Dow merits\r\nconspicuous record in this history for this bold and magnanimous\r\naction. Mr. Middleton received great assistance in building up his\r\nschool from Rev. Mr. Wayman, then pastor of the Bethel Church, and\r\nafterward promoted to the bishopric. The school was surrendered\r\nfinally to Rev. J. V. B. Morgan, the succeeding pastor of the church,\r\nwho conducted the school as a part of the means of his livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CORNISH AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern section of the city, about 1840, Alexander Cornish had\r\na school several years in his own house on D Street, south, between\r\nThird and Fourth, east, with an average of forty scholars. He was\r\nsucceeded, about 1846, by Richard Stokes, who was a native of Chester\r\nCounty, Pa. His school, averaging one hundred and fifty scholars, was\r\nkept in the Israel Bethel Church, near the Capitol, and was continued\r\nfor about six years. In 1840, there was a school opened by Margaret\r\nHill in Georgetown, near Miss English's seminary. She taught a very\r\ngood school for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAYS'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\nwas started on Ninth Street, west, near New York Avenue. Mr. Hays was\r\nborn in 1802, and belonged originally to the Fowler family in\r\nMaryland. When a boy he served for a time at the Washington Navy Yard,\r\nin the family of Captain Dove, of the navy, the father of Dr. Dove, of\r\nWashington, and it was in that family that he learned to read. Michael\r\nTabbs had a school at that time at the Navy Yard, which he taught in\r\nthe afternoons _under a large tree_, which stood near the old Masonic\r\nHall. The Colored children used to meet him there in large numbers\r\ndaily, and while attending this singular school, Hays was at the same\r\ntime taught by Mrs. Dove, with her children. This was half a century\r\nago. In 1826, Hays went to live in the family of R. S. Coxe, the\r\neminent Washington lawyer, who soon purchased him, paying Fowler $300\r\nfor him. Mr. Coxe did this at the express solicitation of Hays, and\r\nseventeen years after he gave him his freedom--in 1843. While living\r\nwith Mr. Coxe he had married Matilda Davis, the daughter of John\r\nDavis, who served as steward many years in the family of Mr. Seaton,\r\nof the \"National Intelligencer.\" The wedding was at Mr. Seaton's\r\nresidence, and Mr. Coxe and family were present on the occasion. In\r\n1836, he bought the house and lot which they still own and occupy, and\r\nin 1842, the year before he was free, Hays made his last payment, and\r\nthe place was conveyed to his wife. She was a free woman, and had\r\nopened a school in the house in 1841. Hays had many privileges while\r\nwith Mr. Coxe, and with the proceeds of his wife's school they paid\r\nthe purchase-money ($550) and interest in seven years. Mr. Hays was\r\ntaught reading, writing, and arithmetic by Mr. Coxe, his wife, and\r\ndaughters, while a slave in their family. When the Colored people were\r\ndriven from the churches, in the years of the mobs, Mrs. Coxe\r\norganized a large Colored Sabbath-school in her own parlor, and\r\nmaintained it for a long period, with the cooperation of Mr. Coxe and\r\nthe daughters. Mr. Hays was a member of this school. He also attended\r\nday schools, when his work would allow of it. This was the education\r\nwith which, in 1845, he ventured to take his wife's school in charge.\r\nHe is a man of good-sense, and his school flourished. He put up an\r\naddition to his house, in order to make room for his increasing\r\nschool, which was continued down to 1857--sixteen years from its\r\nopening. He had also a night school and taught music, and these two\r\nfeatures of his school he has revived since the war. This school\r\ncontained from thirty-five to forty-five pupils. Rev. Dr. Samson, Mr.\r\nSeaton, and Mr. Coxe often visited his school and encouraged him in\r\nhis excellent work. Thomas Tabbs used also to come into his school and\r\ngive him aid and advice, as also did John McLeod.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. AND MRS. FLETCHER'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\nwas opened about 1854, in the building in which Middleton first\r\ntaught, on I, near Twenty-second Street. Mr. Fletcher was an\r\nEnglishman, a well-educated gentleman, and a thorough teacher. He was\r\ninduced to open the school by the importunities of some aspiring\r\nColored young men in that part of the city, who desired first-rate\r\ninstruction. He soon became the object of persecution, though he was a\r\nman of courtesy and excellent character. His school-house was finally\r\nset on fire and consumed, with all its books and furniture; but the\r\nschool took, as its asylum, the basement of the John Wesley Church.\r\nThe churches which they had been forced to build in the days of the\r\nmobs, when they were driven from the white churches which they had\r\naided in building, proved of immense service to them in their\r\nsubsequent struggles. Mrs. Fletcher kept a variety store, which was\r\ndestroyed about the time the school was opened. She then became an\r\nassistant in her husband's school, which numbered over one hundred and\r\nfifty pupils. In 1858, they were driven from the city, as persecution\r\nat that time was particularly violent against all white persons who\r\ninstructed the Colored people. This school was conducted with great\r\nthoroughness, and had two departments, Mrs. Fletcher, who was an\r\naccomplished person, having charge of the girls in a separate room.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZA ANNE COOK,\r\n\r\na niece of Rev. John F. Cook, and one of his pupils, who has been\r\nteaching for about fifteen years, should be mentioned. She attended\r\nMiss Miner's school for a time, and was afterward at the Baltimore\r\nconvent two years. She opened a school in her mother's house, and\r\nsubsequently built a small school-house on the same lot, Sixteenth\r\nStreet, between K and L streets. With the exception of three years,\r\nduring which she was teaching in the free Catholic school opened in\r\nthe Smothers school-house in 1859, and one year in the female school\r\nin charge of the Colored sisters, she has maintained her own private\r\nschool from 1854 down to the present time, her number at some periods\r\nbeing above sixty, but usually not more than twenty-five or thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS WASHINGTON'S SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Annie E. Washington opened a select primary school in her\r\nmother's house, on K Street, between Seventeenth and Eighteenth\r\nstreets, west. The mother, a widow woman, was a laundress, and by her\r\nown labor has given her children good advantages, though she had no\r\nsuch advantages herself. This daughter was educated chiefly under Rev.\r\nJohn E. Cook and Miss Miner, with whom she was a favorite scholar. Her\r\nolder sister was educated at the Baltimore convent. Annie E.\r\nWashington is a woman of native refinement, and has an excellent\r\naptitude for teaching, as well as a good education. Her schools have\r\nalways been conducted with system and superior judgment, giving\r\nuniversal satisfaction, the number of her pupils being limited only by\r\nthe size of her room. In 1858, she moved to the basement of the\r\nBaptist Church, corner of Nineteenth and I streets, to secure larger\r\naccommodations, and there she had a school of more than sixty scholars\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FREE CATHOLIC COLORED SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nA free school was established in 1858, and maintained by the St.\r\nVincent de Paul Society, an association of Colored Catholics, in\r\nconnection with St. Matthew's Church. It was organized under the\r\ndirection of Father Walter, and kept in the Smothers school-house for\r\ntwo years, and was subsequently for one season maintained on a smaller\r\nscale in a house on L Street, between Twelfth and Thirteenth streets,\r\nwest, till the association failed to give it the requisite pecuniary\r\nsupport after the war broke out. This school has already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Elizabeth Smith commenced a school for small children on the\r\nisland in Washington, and subsequently taught on Capitol Hill. In\r\n1860, she was the assistant of Rev. Wm. H. Hunter, who had a large\r\nschool in Zion Wesley Church, Georgetown, of which he was the pastor.\r\nShe afterward took the school into her own charge for a period, and\r\ntaught among the contrabands in various places during the war.\r\n\r\nAbout 1850, Isabella Briscoe opened a school on Montgomery Street,\r\nnear Mount Zion Church, Georgetown. She was well educated, and one of\r\nthe best Colored teachers in the district before the Rebellion. Her\r\nschool was always well patronized, and she continued teaching in the\r\ndistrict up to 1868.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Beams had a large school for a number of years, as early as\r\n1850, in a building next to Galbraith Chapel, I Street, north, between\r\nFourth and Fifth, west. It was exclusively a girls' school in its\r\nlater years. The teacher was a pupil of Enoch Ambush, who assisted her\r\nin establishing her school.\r\n\r\nA year or two later, Rev. James Shorter had a large school in the\r\nIsrael Bethel Church, and Miss Jackson taught another good school on\r\nCapitol Hill about the same time. The above-mentioned were all Colored\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nAmong the excellent schools broken up at the opening of the war, was\r\nthat of Mrs. Charlotte Gordon, Colored, on Eighth Street, in the\r\nnorthern section of the city. It was in successful operation several\r\nyears, and the number in attendance sometimes reached one hundred and\r\nfifty. Mrs. Gordon was assisted by her daughter.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, David Brown commenced teaching on D Street, south, between\r\nFirst and Second streets, island, and continued in the business till\r\n1858, at which period he was placed in charge of the large Catholic\r\nfree school in the Smothers house, as has been stated.[65]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a picture that every Negro in the country may contemplate with\r\nsatisfaction and pride. In the stronghold of slavery, under the shadow\r\nof the legalized institution of slavery, within earshot of the\r\nslave-auctioneer's hammer, amid distressing circumstances, poverty,\r\nand proscription, three unlettered ex-slaves, upon the threshold of\r\nthe nineteenth century, sowed the seed of education for the Negro race\r\nin the District of Columbia, from which an abundant harvest has been\r\ngathered, and will be gathered till the end of time!\r\n\r\nWhat the Negro has done to educate himself, the trials and hateful\r\nlaws that have hampered him during the long period anterior to 1860,\r\ncannot fail to awaken feelings of regret and admiration among the\r\npeople of both sections and two continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict, by Rev.

STEARNS'S PERSONAL\r\n     RECOLLECTION OF JOHN BROWN.--KANSAS INFESTED BY BORDER\r\n     RUFFIANS.--THE BATTLE OF HARPER'S FERRY.--THE DEFEAT AND CAPTURE\r\n     OF CAPTAIN JOHN BROWN.--HIS LAST LETTER WRITTEN TO MRS.\r\n     STEARNS.--HIS TRIAL AND EXECUTION.--HIS INFLUENCE UPON THE\r\n     SLAVERY QUESTION AT THE NORTH.--HIS PLACE IN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May, 1800, at Torrington, Connecticut, was born a man\r\nwho lived for two generations, but accomplished the work of two\r\ncenturies. That man was John Brown, who ranks among the world's\r\ngreatest heroes. Greater than Peter the Hermit, who believed himself\r\ncommissioned of God to redeem the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of\r\ninfidels; greater than Joanna Southcote, who deemed herself big with\r\nthe promised Shiloh; greater than Ignatius Loyola, who thought the Son\r\nof Man appeared to him, bearing His cross upon His shoulders, and\r\nbestowed upon him a Latin commission of wonderful significance;\r\ngreater than Oliver Cromwell, the great Republican Protector; and\r\ngreater than John Hampden,--he deserves to rank with William of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown was nearly six feet high, slim, wiry, dark in complexion,\r\nsharp in feature, dark hair sprinkled with gray, eyes a dark gray and\r\npenetrating, with a countenance that betokened frankness, honesty, and\r\nfirmness. His brow was prominent, the centre of the forehead flat, the\r\nupper part retreating, which, in conjunction with his slightly Roman\r\nnose, gave him an interesting appearance. The crown of his head was\r\nremarkably high, in the regions of the phrenological organs of\r\nfirmness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, indicating a stern will,\r\nunswerving integrity, and marvellous self-possession. He walked\r\nrapidly with a firm and elastic tread. He was somewhat like John\r\nBaptist, taciturn in habits, usually wrapped in meditation. He was\r\nrather meteoric in his movements, appearing suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nat this place, and then disappearing in the same mysterious manner.\r\n\r\nWhen Kansas lay bleeding at the feet of border ruffians; when Congress\r\ngave the free-State settlers no protection, but was rather trying to\r\ndrag the territory into the Union with a slave constitution,--without\r\nnoise or bluster John Brown dropped down into Osage County. He was not\r\na member of the Republican party; but rather hated its reticency. When\r\nit cried Halt! he gave the command _Forward, march_! He was not in\r\nsympathy with any of the parties, political or anti-slavery. All were\r\ntoo conservative to suit him. So, as a political orphan he went into\r\nKansas, organized and led a new party that swore eternal death to\r\nslavery. The first time he appeared in a political meeting in Kansas,\r\nat Osawatomie, the politicians were trimming their speeches and\r\nshaping their resolutions to please each political faction. John Brown\r\ntook the floor and made a speech that threw the convention into\r\nconsternation. He denounced slavery as the curse of the ages; affirmed\r\nthe manhood of the slave; dealt \"middle men\" terrible blows; and said\r\nhe could \"see no use in talking.\" \"Talk,\" he continued, \"is a national\r\ninstitution; but it does no good for the slave.\" He thought it an\r\nexcuse very well adapted for weak men with tender consciences. Most\r\nmen who were afraid to fight, and too honest to be silent, deceived\r\nthemselves that they discharged their duties to the slave by\r\ndenouncing in fiery words the oppressor. His ideas of duty were far\r\ndifferent; the slaves, in his eyes, were prisoners of war; their\r\ntyrants, as he held, had taken up the sword, and must perish by it.\r\nThis was his view of the great question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe widow of the late Major George L. Stearns gives the following\r\npersonal recollections of John Brown, in a bright and entertaining\r\nstyle. Mrs. Stearns's noble husband was very intimately related to the\r\n\"old hero,\" and what Mrs. Stearns writes is of great value.\r\n\r\n     \"The passage of the Fugitive-Slave Bill in 1850, followed by the\r\n     virtual repeal of the Missouri Compromise, under the name of the\r\n     Kansas Nebraska Act, in 1854, alarmed all sane people for the\r\n     safety of republican institutions; and the excitement reached a\r\n     white heat when, on the 22d of May, 1856, Charles Sumner was\r\n     murderously assaulted in the Senate chamber by Preston S. Brooks,\r\n     of South Carolina, for words spoken in debate: the celebrated\r\n     speech of the 19th and 20th of May, known as 'The Crime Against\r\n     Kansas.' That same week the town of Lawrence in the territory of\r\n     Kansas was sacked and burned in the interest of the slave power.\r\n     The atrocities committed by the 'Border Ruffians' upon the\r\n     free-State settlers sent a thrill of terror through all\r\n     law-abiding communities. In Boston the citizens gathered in\r\n     Faneuil Hall to consider what could be done, and a committee was\r\n     chosen, with Dr. S. G. Howe as chairman, for the relief of\r\n     Kansas, called the 'Kansas Relief Committee.' After some $18,000\r\n     or $20,000 had been collected, chiefly in Boston, and forwarded\r\n     to Kansas, the interest flagged, and Mr. Stearns, who had been\r\n     working with that committee, saw the need of more energetic\r\n     action; so one day he went to Dr. Howe, and told him he was ready\r\n     to give _all_ his time, and much of his money, to push forward\r\n     the work. Dr. Howe seeing that here was the man for the hour,\r\n     immediately resigned, and Mr. Stearns was chosen unanimously\r\n     chairman of the 'Massachusetts State Kansas Committee,' which\r\n     took the place of the one first organized. In the light of\r\n     subsequent history it is difficult to believe the apathy and\r\n     blindness which failed to recognize the significance of this\r\n     attack upon Kansas by the slave-holding power. Only faithful\r\n     watchmen in their high towers could see that it was the first\r\n     battle-ground between the two conflicting systems of freedom and\r\n     slavery, which was finally to culminate in the war of the\r\n     Rebellion. 'Working day and night without haste or rest,' failing\r\n     in no effort to rouse and stimulate the community, still Mr.\r\n     Stearns found that a vitalizing interest was wanting. When Gov.\r\n     Reeder was driven in disguise from the territory, he wrote to him\r\n     to come to Boston and address the people. He organized a\r\n     mass-meeting for him in Tremont Temple, and for a few days the\r\n     story he related stimulated to a livelier activity the more\r\n     conservative people, who were inclined to think the reports of\r\n     the free-State men much exaggerated. Soon, however, things\r\n     settled back into the old sluggish way; so that for three\r\n     consecutive committee meetings the chairman was the only person\r\n     who presented himself at the appointed time and place. Nothing\r\n     daunted, he turned to the country towns, and at the end of five\r\n     months he had raised by his personal exertions, and through his\r\n     agents, the sum of $48,000. Women formed societies all over the\r\n     State, for making and furnishing clothing, and various supplies,\r\n     which resulted in an addition of some $20,000 or $30,000 more. In\r\n     January, 1867, this species of work was stopped, by advices from\r\n     Kansas that no more contributions were needed, except for\r\n     _defense_. At this juncture Mr. Stearns wrote to John Brown, that\r\n     if he would come to Boston and consult with the friends of\r\n     freedom he would pay his expenses. They had never met, but\r\n     'Osawatomie Brown' had become a cherished household name during\r\n     the anxious summer of 1856.[66] Arriving in Boston, they were\r\n     introduced to each other in the street by a Kansas man, who\r\n     chanced to be with Mr. Stearns on his way to the committee rooms\r\n     in Nilis's Block, School Street. Captain Brown made a profound\r\n     impression on all who came within the sphere of his moral\r\n     magnetism. Emerson called him 'the most ideal of men, for he\r\n     wanted to put all his ideas into action.' His absolute\r\n     superiority to all selfish aims and narrowing pride of opinion\r\n     touched an answering chord in the self-devotion of Mr. Stearns. A\r\n     little anecdote illustrates the modest estimate of the work he\r\n     had in hand. After several efforts to bring together certain\r\n     friends to meet Captain Brown at his home in Medford, he found\r\n     that Sunday was the only day that would serve their several\r\n     convenience, and being a little uncertain how it might strike his\r\n     ideas of religious propriety, he prefaced his invitation with\r\n     something like an apology. With characteristic promptness came\r\n     the reply: 'Mr. Stearns, I have a little ewe-lamb that I want to\r\n     pull out of the ditch, and the Sabbath will be as good a day as\r\n     any to do it.'\r\n\r\n     \"It was this occasion which furnished to literature one of the\r\n     most charming bits of autobiography. Our oldest son, Harry, a lad\r\n     of eleven years, was an observant listener, and drank eagerly\r\n     every word that was said of the cruel wrongs in Kansas, and of\r\n     slavery everywhere. When the gentlemen rose to go, he privately\r\n     asked his father if he might be allowed to give all his spending\r\n     money to John Brown. Leave being granted, he bounded away, and\r\n     returning with his small treasure, said: 'Captain Brown, will you\r\n     buy something with this money for those poor people in Kansas,\r\n     and some time will you write to me and tell me _what sort of a\r\n     little boy_ you were?' 'Yes, my son, I will, and God bless you\r\n     for your kind heart!' The autobiography has been printed many\r\n     times, but never before with the key which unlocked it.\r\n\r\n     \"It may not be out of place to describe the impression he made\r\n     upon the writer on this first visit. When I entered the parlor,\r\n     he was sitting near the hearth, where glowed a bright open fire.\r\n     He rose to greet me, stepping forward with such an erect,\r\n     military bearing; such fine courtesy of demeanor and grave\r\n     earnestness, that he seemed to my instant thought some old\r\n     Cromwellian hero suddenly dropped down before me; a suggestion\r\n     which was presently strengthened by his saying [proceeding with\r\n     the conversation my entrance had interrupted]: 'Gentlemen, I\r\n     consider the Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence one\r\n     and inseparable; and it is better that a whole generation of men,\r\n     women, and children should be swept away, than that this crime of\r\n     slavery should exist one day longer.' These words were uttered\r\n     like rifle balls; in such emphatic tones and manner that our\r\n     little Carl, not three years old, remembered it in manhood as one\r\n     of his earliest recollections. The child stood perfectly still,\r\n     in the middle of the room, gazing with his beautiful eyes on this\r\n     new sort of man, until his absorption arrested the attention of\r\n     Captain Brown, who soon coaxed him to his knee, tho' the look of\r\n     awe and childlike wonder remained. His dress was of some dark\r\n     brown stuff, quite coarse, but its exactness and neatness\r\n     produced a singular air of refinement. At dinner, he declined all\r\n     dainties, saying that he was unaccustomed to luxuries, even to\r\n     partaking of butter.\r\n\r\n     \"The 'friends of freedom' with whom Mr. Stearns had invited John\r\n     Brown to consult were profoundly impressed with his sagacity,\r\n     integrity, and devotion; notably among these were R. W. Emerson,\r\n     Theodore Parker, H. D. Thoreau, A. Bronson Alcott, F. B. Sanborn,\r\n     Dr. S. G. Howe, Col. T. W. Higginson, Gov. Andrew, and others. In\r\n     February (1857) he appeared before a committee of the State\r\n     Legislature, to urge that Massachusetts should make an\r\n     appropriation in money in aid of those persons who had settled in\r\n     Kansas from her own soil. The speech is printed in Redpath's\r\n     'Life.' He obtained at this time, from the Massachusetts State\r\n     Kansas Committee,[67] some two hundred Sharp's rifles, with which\r\n     to arm one hundred mounted men for the defense of Kansas, who\r\n     could also be of service to the peculiar property of Missouri. In\r\n     those dark days of slave-holding supremacy, the friends of\r\n     freedom felt justified in aiding the flight of its victims to\r\n     free soil whenever and wherever opportunity offered. The\r\n     Fugitive-Slave Law was powerless before the law written on the\r\n     enlightened consciences of those devoted men and women. These\r\n     rifles had been forwarded previously to the National Committee at\r\n     Chicago, for the defense of Kansas, but for some unexplained\r\n     reasons had never proceeded farther than Tabor, in the State of\r\n     Iowa. Later on, Mr. Stearns, in his individual capacity,\r\n     authorized Captain Brown to purchase two hundred revolvers from\r\n     the Massachusetts Arms Company, and paid for them from his\r\n     private funds, thirteen or fifteen hundred dollars. During the\r\n     summer of 1857 he united with Mr. Amos A. Lawrence and others in\r\n     paying off the mortgage held by Mr. Gerritt Smith on his house\r\n     and farm at North Elba, N. Y., he paying two hundred and sixty\r\n     dollars. It would be difficult to state the entire amount of\r\n     money Mr. Stearns put into the hands of John Brown for\r\n     Anti-Slavery purposes and his own subsistence. He kept no account\r\n     of what he gave. In April or May, 1857, he gave him a check for\r\n     no less a sum than seven thousand dollars. Early in 1858, Hon.\r\n     Henry Wilson wrote to Dr. S. G. Howe that he had learned John\r\n     Brown was suspected of the intention of using those arms in other\r\n     ways than for the _defense_ of Kansas; and by order of the\r\n     committee, Mr. Stearns wrote (under date May 14, 1858) to Brown\r\n     not to use them for any other purpose, and to hold them subject\r\n     to his order, as chairman of said committee. When the operations\r\n     of the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee virtually ceased, in\r\n     June or July, 1858, it happened that this committee were some\r\n     four thousand dollars in debt to Mr. Stearns, for advances of\r\n     money from time to time to keep the organization in existence;\r\n     and it was voted to make over to the chairman these two hundred\r\n     Sharp's rifles as part payment of the committee's indebtedness.\r\n     They were of small account to Mr. Stearns. He knew them to be in\r\n     good hands, and troubled himself no further about them, either\r\n     the rifles or the revolvers; although keeping up from time to\r\n     time a correspondence with his friend upon the all-engrossing\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     \"In February of 1859, John Brown was in Boston, and talked with\r\n     some of his friends about the feasibility of entrenching himself,\r\n     with a little band of men, in the mountains of Virginia, familiar\r\n     to him from having surveyed them as engineer in earlier life. His\r\n     plan was to open communication with the slaves of neighboring\r\n     plantations, collect them together, and send them off in squads,\r\n     as he had done in Missouri, 'without snapping a gun.' Mr. Stearns\r\n     had so much more faith in John Brown's opposition to _Slavery_,\r\n     than in any theories he advanced of the _modus operandi_, that\r\n     they produced much less impression on his mind than upon some\r\n     others gifted with more genius for details. _From first to last,\r\n     he believed in John Brown._ His plans, or theories, might be\r\n     feasible, or they might not. If the glorious old man wanted money\r\n     to try his plans, he should have it. His plans might fail;\r\n     probably would, but _he_ could never be a failure. There he\r\n     stood, unconquerable, in the panoply of divine Justice. Both of\r\n     these men were of the martyr type. No thought or consideration\r\n     for themselves, for _history_, or the estimation of others, ever\r\n     entered into their calculations. It was the service of _Truth_\r\n     and _Right_ which brought them together, and in that service they\r\n     were ready to die.\r\n\r\n     \"In the words of an eminent writer[68]: 'A common spirit made\r\n     these two men recognize each other at first sight; and the power\r\n     of both lay in that inability to weigh difficulties against duty,\r\n     that instant step of thought to deed, which makes individuals\r\n     fully possessed by the idea of the age, the turning-points of its\r\n     destiny; hands in the right place for touching the match to the\r\n     train it has laid, or for leading the public will to the heart of\r\n     its moral need. They knew each other as minute-men on the same\r\n     watch; as men to be found _in_ the breach, before others knew\r\n     where it was; they were one in pity, one in indignation, one in\r\n     moral enthusiasm, burning beneath features set to patient\r\n     self-control; one in simplicity, though of widely different\r\n     culture; one in religious inspiration, though at the poles of\r\n     religious thought. The old frontiersman came from his wilderness\r\n     toils and agonies to find within the merchant's mansion of art\r\n     and taste by the side of Bunker Hill, a perfect sympathy: the\r\n     reverence of children, tender interest in his broken household,\r\n     free access to a rich man's resources, and even a valor kindred\r\n     with his own.'\r\n\r\n     \"The attack upon Harper's Ferry was a 'side issue,' to quote the\r\n     words of John Brown, Jr., and a departure from his father's\r\n     original plan. It certainly took all his friends by surprise. In\r\n     his letter of Nov. 15, 1859 (while in prison), to his old\r\n     schoolmaster, the Rev. H. L. Vaill, are these words: 'I am not as\r\n     yet, in the _main_, at all disappointed. I have been a good deal\r\n     disappointed as it regards _myself_ in not keeping up to my own\r\n     plans; but I now feel entirely reconciled to that even: for God's\r\n     plan was infinitely better, _no doubt_, or I should have kept my\r\n     own. Had Samson kept to his determination of not telling Delilah\r\n     wherein his great strength lay, he would probably have never\r\n     overturned the house. _I did not tell Delilah_; but I was induced\r\n     to act very _contrary to my better judgment_.'[69]\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"It is idle to endeavor to explain, by any methods of the\r\n     _understanding_, any rules of worldly wisdom, or prudence, this\r\n     influx of the Divine Will, which has made John Brown already an\r\n     ideal character. 'The wind bloweth where it listeth, and we hear\r\n     the sound thereof; but know not whence it cometh, or whither it\r\n     goeth.' So is every one that is born of the Spirit. Man works in\r\n     the midst of laws which execute themselves, more especially, if\r\n     by virtue of obedience he has lost sight of all selfish aims, and\r\n     perceives that Truth and Right alone can claim allegiance.\r\n     Emerson says: 'Divine intelligence carries on its administration\r\n     by good men; that great men are they who see that the spiritual\r\n     are greater than any material forces; and that really there never\r\n     was any thing great accomplished but under religious impulse.'\r\n\r\n     \"The deadly _Atheism_ of Slavery was rolling its car of\r\n     Juggernaut all over the beautiful Republic, and one pure soul was\r\n     inspired to confront it by a practical interpretation of the\r\n     Golden Rule.\r\n\r\n     \"That Virginia would hang John Brown was a foregone conclusion.\r\n     The Moloch of Slavery would have nothing less. His friends\r\n     exerted themselves to secure the best counsel which could be\r\n     induced to undertake the _formality_ of a defense, foremost among\r\n     whom was Mr. Stearns. A well-organized plan was made to rescue\r\n     him, conducted by a brave man from Kansas, Col. James Montgomery,\r\n     but a message came from the prisoner, that he should not feel at\r\n     liberty to walk out, if the doors were left open; a sense of\r\n     honor to his jailer (Captain Acvis) forbidding any thing of the\r\n     kind.\r\n\r\n     \"Not a little anxiety was felt lest certain of his adherents\r\n     might be summoned as witnesses, whose testimony would lessen the\r\n     chances of acquittal, and possibly involve their own lives. John\r\n     A. Andrew (afterward Gov. Andrew) gave it as his opinion, after\r\n     an exhaustive search of the records, that Virginia would have no\r\n     right to summon these persons from Massachusetts, but\r\n     subsequently changed his opinion, and urged Mr. Stearns to take\r\n     passage to Europe, sending him home one day to pack his valise.\r\n     The advice was opposed to his instincts, but he considered that\r\n     his wife should have a voice in the matter, who decided, 'midst\r\n     many tears and prayers, that if slavery required another victim,\r\n     he must be ready.\r\n\r\n     \"With Dr. Howe it was quite different. He became possessed with a\r\n     dread that threatened to overwhelm his reason. He was in delicate\r\n     health, and constitutionally subject to violent attacks of\r\n     nervous headache. One day he came to Medford and insisted that\r\n     Mr. Stearns should accompany him to Canada, urging that if he\r\n     remained here he should be insane, and that Mr. Stearns of all\r\n     his friends was the only one who would be at all satisfactory to\r\n     him. This request, or rather demand, Mr. Stearns promptly\r\n     declined. How well I remember his agitation, walking up and down\r\n     the room, and finally entreating Mr. Stearns for 'friendship's\r\n     sake' to go and take care of him. I can recall no instance of\r\n     such self-abnegation in my husband's self-denying career. He did\r\n     not _stoop_ to an _explanation_, even when Dr. Howe declared in\r\n     his presence, some months later, \"that he never did any thing in\r\n     his life he so much wished to take back.\" I had hoped that Dr.\r\n     Howe would himself have spared me from making this contribution\r\n     to the truth of history.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 2d of December, Mr. Stearns yearned for the solitude of\r\n     his own soul, in communion of spirit, with the friend who, on\r\n     that day, would 'make the gallows glorious like the Cross'; and\r\n     he left Dr. Howe and took the train for Niagara Falls. There,\r\n     sitting alone beside the mighty rush of water, he solemnly\r\n     consecrated his remaining life, his fortune, and all that was\r\n     most dear, to the _cause_ in whose service John Brown had died.\r\n\r\n     \"How well and faithfully he kept his vow, may partly be seen in\r\n     his subsequent efforts in recruiting the colored troops at a\r\n     vital moment in the terrible war of the Rebellion which so\r\n     swiftly followed the sublime apotheosis of 'Old John Brown.'\"[70]\r\n\r\nThat John Brown intended to free the slaves, and nothing more, the\r\nrecord shows clearly. His move on Harper's Ferry was well planned,\r\nand had all the parties interested done their part the work would have\r\nbeen done well. As to the rectitude of his intentions he gives the\r\nworld this leaf of history:\r\n\r\n     \"And now, gentlemen, let me press this one thing on your minds.\r\n     You all know how dear life is to you, and how dear your lives are\r\n     to your friends: and in remembering that, consider that the lives\r\n     of others are as dear to them as yours are to you. Do not,\r\n     therefore, take the life of any one if you can possibly avoid it;\r\n     but if it is necessary to take life in order to save your own,\r\n     then make sure work of it.\"--John Brown, before the battle at\r\n     Harper's Ferry.\r\n\r\n     \"I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of\r\n     property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make\r\n     insurrection. The design on my part was to free the\r\n     slaves.\"--John Brown, after the battle at Harper's Ferry.\r\n\r\nDistance lends enchantment to the view. What the world condemns to-day\r\nis applauded to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWe must have a \"fair count\" on the history of yesterday and last year.\r\nThe events chronicled yesterday, when the imagination was wrought upon\r\nby exciting circumstances, need revision to-day.\r\n\r\nThe bitter words spoken this morning reproach at eventide the smarting\r\nconscience. And the judgments prematurely formed, and the conclusions\r\nrapidly reached, maybe rectified and repaired in the light of departed\r\nyears and enlarged knowledge.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown is rapidly settling down to his proper place in history,\r\nand \"the madman\" has been transformed into a \"saint.\" When Brown\r\nstruck his first blow for freedom, at the head of his little band of\r\nliberators, it was almost the universal judgment of both Americans and\r\nforeigners that he was a \"fanatic.\" It seemed the very soul of\r\nweakness and arrogance for John Brown to attempt to do so great a work\r\nwith so small a force. Men reached a decision with the outer and\r\nsurface facts. But many of the most important and historically\r\ntrustworthy truths bearing upon the motive, object, and import of that\r\n\"bold move,\" have been hidden from the public view, either by\r\nprejudice or fear.\r\n\r\nSome people have thought John Brown--\"_The Hero of Harper's Ferry_\"--a\r\nhot-headed, blood-thirsty brigand; they animadverted against the\r\nprecipitancy of his measures, and the severity of his invectives; said\r\nthat he was lacking in courage and deficient in judgment; that he\r\nretarded rather than accelerated the cause he championed. But this\r\nwas the verdict of other times, not the judgment of to-day.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown said to a personal friend during his stay in Kansas: \"Young\r\nmen must learn to wait. Patience is the hardest lesson to learn. I\r\nhave waited for twenty years to accomplish my purpose.\" These are not\r\nthe words of a mere visionary idealist, but the mature language of a\r\npractical and judicious leader, a leader than whom the world has never\r\nseen a greater. By greatness is meant deep convictions of duty, a\r\nsense of the Infinite, \"a strong hold on truth,\" a \"conscience void of\r\noffence toward God and man,\" to which the appeals of the innocent and\r\nhelpless are more potential than the voices of angry thunder or\r\ndestructive artillery. Such a man was John Brown. He was strong in his\r\nmoral and mental nature, as well as in his physical nature. He was\r\nborn to lead; and he led, and made himself the pro-martyr of a cause\r\nrapidly perfecting. All through his boyhood days he felt himself\r\nlifted and quickened by great ideas and sublime purposes. He had\r\nflowing in his veins the blood of his great ancestor, Peter Brown, who\r\ncame over in the \"Mayflower\"; and the following inscription appears\r\nupon a marble monument in the graveyard at Canton Centre, New York:\r\n\"In memory of Captain John Brown, who died in the Revolutionary army,\r\nat New York, September 3, 1776. He was of the fourth generation, in\r\nregular descent, from Peter Brown, one of the Pilgrim Fathers, who\r\nlanded from the 'Mayflower,' at Plymouth, Massachusetts, December 22,\r\n1620.\" This is the best commentary on his inherent love of absolute\r\nliberty, his marvellous courage and transcendent military genius. For\r\nyears he elaborated and perfected his plans, working upon the public\r\nsentiment of his day by the most praiseworthy means. He bent and bowed\r\nthe most obdurate conservatism of his day, and rallied to his\r\nstandards the most eminent men, the strongest intellects in the North.\r\nHis ethics and religion were as broad as the universe, and beneficent\r\nin their wide ramification. And it was upon his \"religion of\r\nhumanity,\" that embraced our entire species, that he proceeded with\r\nhis herculean task of striking off the chains of the enslaved. Few,\r\nvery few of his most intimate friends knew his plans--the plan of\r\nfreeing the slaves. Many knew his great faith, his exalted sentiments,\r\nhis ideas of liberty, in their crudity; but to a faithful few only did\r\nhe reveal his stupendous plans in their entirety.\r\n\r\nHon. Frederick Douglass and Colonel Richard J. Hinton, knew more of\r\nBrown's real purposes than any other persons, with the exception of J.\r\nH. Kagi, Osborn Anderson, Owen Brown, Richard Realf, and George B.\r\nGill.\r\n\r\n\"Of men born of woman,\" there is not a greater than John Brown. He was\r\nthe forerunner of Lincoln, the great apostle of freedom.\r\n\r\nOne year before he went to Harper's Ferry, a friend met Brown in\r\nKansas [in June, 1858], and learned that during the previous month he\r\nhad brought almost all of his plans to perfection; and that the day\r\nand hour were fixed to strike the blow. One year before, a convention\r\nhad met, on the 8th of May, 1858, at Chatham, Canada. At this\r\nconvention a provisional constitution and ordinances were drafted and\r\nadopted, with the following officers: Commander-in-Chief, John Brown;\r\nSecretary of War, J. H. Kagi; Members of Congress, Alfred M.\r\nEllsworth, Osborn Anderson; Treasurer, Owen Brown; Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, Geo. B. Gill; Secretary of State, Richard Realf.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown made his appearance in Ohio and Canada in the spring of\r\n1859. He wrote letters, made speeches, collected funds for his little\r\narmy, and made final arrangements with his Northern allies, etc. He\r\npurchased a small farm, about six miles from Harper's Ferry, on the\r\nMaryland side, and made it his ordnance depot. He had 102 Sharp's\r\nrifles, 68 pistols, 55 bayonets, 12 artillery swords, 483 pikes, 150\r\nbroken handles of pikes, 16 picks, 40 shovels, besides quite a number\r\nof other appurtenances of war. This was in July. He intended to make\r\nall of his arrangements during the summer of 1859, and meet his men in\r\nthe Alleghanies in the fall of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe apparent rashness of the John Brown movement may be mitigated\r\nsomewhat by the fact that he failed to carry out his original plan.\r\nDuring the summer of 1859 he instructed his Northern soldiers and\r\nsympathizers to be ready for the attack on the night of the 24th of\r\nOctober, 1859. But while at Baltimore, in September, he got the\r\nimpression that there was conspiracy in his camp, and in order to\r\npreclude its consummation, suddenly, without sending the news to his\r\nfriends at the North, determined to strike the first blow on the night\r\nof the 17th of October. The news of his battle and his bold stand\r\nagainst the united forces of Virginia and Maryland swept across the\r\ncountry as the wild storm comes down the mountain side. Friend and foe\r\nwere alike astonished and alarmed. The enemies of the cause he\r\nrepresented, when they recovered from their surprise, laughed their\r\nlittle laugh of scorn, and eased their feelings by referring to him as\r\nthe \"madman.\" Friends faltered, and, while they did not question his\r\nearnestness, doubted his judgment. \"Why,\" they asked, \"should he act\r\nwith such palpable rashness, and thereby render more difficult and\r\nimpossible the emancipation of the slaves?\" They claimed that the blow\r\nhe struck, instead of severing, only the more tightly riveted, the\r\nchains upon the helpless and hapless Blacks. But in the face of\r\nsubsequent history we think his surviving friends will change their\r\nviews. There is no proof that his fears were not well grounded; that a\r\nconspiracy was in progress. And who can tell whether a larger force\r\nwould have been more effective, or the night of the 24th more\r\nopportune? May it not be believed that the good old man was right, and\r\nthat Harper's Ferry was just the place, and the 17th of October just\r\nthe time to strike for freedom, and make the rock-ribbed mountains of\r\nVirginia to tremble at the presence of a \"master!\"--the king of\r\nfreedom?\r\n\r\nHe was made a prisoner on the 19th of October, 1859, and remained\r\nuntil the 7th of November without a change of clothing or medical aid.\r\nForty-two days from the time of his imprisonment he expiated his crime\r\nupon the scaffold--a crime against slave-holding, timorous Virginia,\r\nfor bringing liberty to the oppressed. He was a man, and there was\r\nnothing that interested man which was foreign to his nature. He had\r\ngone into Virginia to save life, not to destroy it. The sighs and\r\ngroans of the oppressed had entered into his soul.\r\n\r\nHe had heard the Macedonian cry to come over and help them. He went,\r\nand it cost him his life, but he gave it freely.\r\n\r\nCaptain Acvis, the jailer, said: \"He was the gamest man I ever saw.\"\r\nAnd Mr. Valandingham, at that time a member of Congress from Ohio, and\r\nwho examined him in court, said in a speech afterward.\r\n\r\n     \"It is in vain to underrate either the man or the conspiracy.\r\n     Captain John Brown is as brave and resolute a man as ever headed\r\n     an insurrection, and, in a good cause, and with a sufficient\r\n     force, would have been a consummate partisan commander. He has\r\n     coolness, daring, persistency, stoic faith and patience, and a\r\n     firmness of will and purpose unconquerable! He is the farthest\r\n     possible remove from the ordinary ruffian, fanatic, or madman.\"\r\n\r\nNo friend, howsoever ardent in his love, could have woven a chaplet\r\nmore worthy than the one placed upon the brow of the old hero by his\r\nmost embittered foe. A truer estimate of John Brown cannot be had.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, Missouri, and Kentucky sent a rope to hang him, but,\r\nthe first two lacking strength, Kentucky had the everlasting disgrace\r\nof furnishing the rope to strangle the noblest man that ever lived in\r\nany age.\r\n\r\nThe last letter he ever wrote was written to Mrs. Geo. L. Stearns, and\r\nshe shall give its history:\r\n\r\n     This letter requires the history which attaches to it, and\r\n     illustrates the consideration which the brave martyr had for\r\n     those in any way connected with him. It was written on a half\r\n     sheet of paper, the exact size of the pages of a book into which\r\n     he carefully inserted it, and tied up in a handkerchief with\r\n     other books and papers, which he asked his jailer (Mr. Avis) to\r\n     be allowed to go with his body to North Elba, and which Mrs.\r\n     Brown took with her from the Charlestown prison. Her statement to\r\n     me about it is this: She had been at home some two weeks, had\r\n     looked over the contents of the handkerchief many times, when one\r\n     day in turning the leaves of that particular book, she came upon\r\n     this letter, on which she said she found two or three blistered\r\n     spots, the only _tear drops_ she had seen among his papers. They\r\n     are now yellow with time. On the back of the half sheet was\r\n     written: \"Please mail this to her,\" which she did, and so it\r\n     reached my hand; seeming as if from the world to which his spirit\r\n     had fled. It quite overwhelmed my husband. Presently he said:\r\n     \"See, dear, how careful the old man has been, he would not even\r\n     direct it with your name to go from Virginia to Boston through\r\n     the post-offices; and altho' it contains no message to me, one of\r\n     those '_farewells_!' is intended for me, and also the 'Love to\r\n     _All_ who love their neighbors.'\"\r\n\r\n                         \"CHARLESTOWN, JEFFERSON CO VA. 29th Nov. 1859.\r\n\r\n     \"MRS.

He heard the warning\r\nshot fired at Sumter, saw Richmond fall, the war end in victory to the\r\nparty of John Brown; saw the slave-pen converted into the\r\nschool-house, and the four millions Brown fought and died for,\r\nelevated to the honors of citizenship. And at last he has entered the\r\ngrave, where his memory will perish with his body, while the soul and\r\nfame of John Brown go marching down the centuries!\r\n\r\nGalileo, Copernicus, Newton, and John Brown have to wait the calmer\r\njudgments of future generations. These men believed that God sent them\r\nto do a certain work--to reveal a hidden truth; to pour light into the\r\nminds of benighted and superstitious men. They completed their work;\r\nthey did nobly and well, then bowed to rest--\r\n\r\n  \"With patriarchs of the infant world--with kings,\r\n  The powerful of the earth,\"\r\n\r\nwhile generation after generation studies their handwriting on the\r\nwall of time and interprets their thoughts. Despised, persecuted, and\r\nunappreciated while in the flesh, they are honored after death, and\r\nenrolled among earth's good and great, her wise and brave. The shock\r\nBrown gave the walls of the slave institution was felt from its centre\r\nto its utmost limits. It was the entering wedge; it laid bare the\r\naccursed institution, and taught good men everywhere to hate it with a\r\nperfect hatred. Slavery received its death wound at the hands of a\r\n\"lonely old man.\" When he smote Virginia, the non-resistants, the\r\nanti-slavery men, learned a lesson. They saw what was necessary to the\r\naccomplishment of their work, and were now ready for the \"worst.\" He\r\nrebuked the conservatism of the North, and gave an example of\r\nadherence to duty, devotion to truth, and fealty to God and man that\r\nmake the mere \"professor\" to tremble with shame. \"John Brown's body\r\nlies mouldering in the clay,\" but his immortal name will be pronounced\r\nwith blessings in all lands and by all people till the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] This was in the last days of 1856.\r\n\r\n[67] The committee also authorized him to draw on their treasurer,\r\nPatrick L.

The gain of the entire population of the\r\nslave-holding States, from 1850-1860, was 2,627,000, equal to 27.33\r\nper cent. The slave population had increased 749,931, or 23.44 per\r\ncent., not including the slaves in the District of Columbia, where\r\nthey had lost 502 slaves during the decade. The nineteen\r\nnon-slave-holding States and the seven territories, including the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, contained 19,203,008 souls, of whom 18,920,771\r\nwere whites, 237,283 free persons of color, and 41,725 civilized\r\nIndians. The actual increase of this population was 5,624,101, or\r\n41.24 per cent. During the same period--1850-1860--the total\r\npopulation of free persons of color in the United States increased\r\nfrom 434,449 to 487,970, or at the rate of 12.33 per cent., annual\r\nincrease of above 1 per cent. In 1850 the Mulattoes were 11.15 per\r\ncent., regarding the United States as one aggregate, and in 1860 were\r\n13.25 per cent., of the entire Colored population.\r\n\r\n      TOTAL COLORED POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n  --------------+-----------------------+---------------\r\n                |        Numbers.       | Proportions.\r\n                +-----------+-----------+-------+-------\r\n     Colored.   |   1850.   |   1860.   | 1850. | 1860.\r\n  --------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------\r\n  Blacks        | 3,233,057 | 3,853,478 | 88.85 | 86.75\r\n  Mulattoes     |   405,751 |   588,352 | 11.15 | 13.25\r\n  --------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------\r\n  Total Colored | 3,638,808 | 4,441,830 |100.00 |100.00\r\n  --------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nSo, in ten years, from 1850-1860, the increase of blacks above the\r\ncurrent deaths was 620,421, or more than one half of a million, while\r\nthe corresponding increase of Mulattoes was 182,601. Estimating the\r\ndeaths to have been 22.4 per cent. during the same period, or one in\r\n40 annually, the total births of Blacks in ten years was about\r\n1,345,000, and the total births of Mulattoes about 273,000. Thus it\r\nappears, in the prevailing order, that of every 100 births of Colored,\r\nabout 17 were Mulattoes, and 83 Blacks, indicating a ratio of nearly 1\r\nto 5.\r\n\r\nThere were:\r\n\r\n  Deaf and dumb slaves     531\r\n  Blind                  1,387\r\n  Insane                   327\r\n  Idiotic                1,182\r\n                         -----\r\n  Total                  3,427\r\n\r\nThere were 400,000 slaves in the towns and cities of the South, and\r\n2,804,313 in the country.

The representation in Congress was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Northern representatives based on white population         142\r\n  Northern representatives based on Colored population         2\r\n  Southern representatives based on white population          68\r\n  Southern representatives based on free Colored population    2\r\n  Southern representatives based on slave population          20\r\n  Ratio of representation for 1853                   93,420\r\n\r\nThe South owned 16,652 churches, valued at $22,142,085; the North\r\nowned 21,357 churches, valued at $65,167,586. The South printed\r\nannually 92,165,919 copies of papers and periodicals; the North\r\nprinted annually 334,146,081 copies of papers and periodicals. The\r\nSouth owned, other than private, 722 libraries, containing 742,794\r\nvolumes; the North owned, other than private, 14,902 libraries,\r\ncontaining 3,882,217 volumes.\r\n\r\nIn sentiment, motive, and civilization the two \"Sections\" were as far\r\napart as the poles. New England, Puritan, Roundhead civilization could\r\nnot fellowship the Cavaliers of the South. There were not only two\r\nsections and two political parties in the United States;--there were\r\ntwo antagonistic governmental ideas. John C. Calhoun and Alexander H.\r\nStephens, of the South, represented the idea of the separate and\r\nindividual sovereignty of each of the States; while William H. Seward\r\nand Abraham Lincoln, of the North, represented the idea of the\r\ncentralization of governmental authority, so far as it was necessary\r\nto secure uniformity of the laws, and the supremacy of the Federal\r\nConstitution. On the 25th of October, 1858, in a speech delivered in\r\nRochester, N. Y., William H. Seward said:\r\n\r\n     \"Our country is a theatre which exhibits, in full operation, two\r\n     radically different political systems: the one resting on the\r\n     basis of servile or slave labor; the other on the basis of\r\n     voluntary labor of freemen.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The two systems are at once perceived to be incongruous. They\r\n     never have permanently existed together in one country, and they\r\n     never can.\r\n\r\n     ... \"These antagonistic systems are continually coming in closer\r\n     contact, and collision ensues.\r\n\r\n     \"Shall I tell you what this collision means? It is an\r\n     irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and\r\n     it means that the United States must, and will, sooner or later,\r\n     become entirely a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free labor\r\n     nation. Either the cotton and rice fields of South Carolina, and\r\n     the sugar plantations of Louisiana, will ultimately be tilled by\r\n     free-labor, and Charleston and New Orleans become marts for\r\n     legitimate merchandise alone, or else the rye fields and wheat\r\n     fields of Massachusetts and New York must again be surrendered by\r\n     their farmers to the slave culture and to the production of\r\n     slaves, and Boston and New York become once more markets for\r\n     trade in the bodies and souls of men.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the eve of the great Rebellion, Mr. Seward said in the United\r\nStates Senate:\r\n\r\n     \"A free Republican government like this, notwithstanding all its\r\n     constitutional checks, cannot long resist and counteract the\r\n     progress of society.\r\n\r\n     \"Free labor has at last apprehended its rights and its destiny,\r\n     and is organizing itself to assume the government of the\r\n     Republic. It will henceforth meet you boldly and resolutely here\r\n     (Washington); it will meet you everywhere, in the territories and\r\n     out of them, where-ever you may go to extend slavery. It has\r\n     driven you back in California and in Kansas; it will invade you\r\n     soon in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, and Texas. It\r\n     will meet you in Arizona, in Central America, and even in Cuba.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"You may, indeed, get a start under or near the tropics, and seem\r\n     safe for a time, but it will be only a short time. Even there you\r\n     will found States only for free labor, or to maintain and occupy.\r\n     The interest of the whole race demands the ultimate emancipation\r\n     of all men. Whether that consummation shall be allowed to take\r\n     effect, with needful and wise precautions against sudden change\r\n     and disaster, or be hurried on by violence, is all that remains\r\n     for you to decide. The white man needs this continent to labor\r\n     upon. His head is clear, his arm is strong, and his necessities\r\n     are fixed.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"It is for yourselves, and not for us, to decide how long and\r\n     through what further mortifications and disasters the contest\r\n     shall be protracted before Freedom shall enjoy her already\r\n     assured triumph.\r\n\r\n     \"You may refuse to yield it now, and for a short period, but your\r\n     refusal will only animate the friends of freedom with the courage\r\n     and the resolution, and produce the union among them, which alone\r\n     is necessary on their part to attain the position itself,\r\n     simultaneously with the impending overthrow of the existing\r\n     Federal Administration and the constitution of a new and more\r\n     independent Congress.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said during a discussion of the impending crisis:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave\r\n     and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do\r\n     not expect the house to fall, but I do expect that it will cease\r\n     to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\r\n     Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of\r\n     it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\r\n     that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\n     will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all\r\n     the States, old as well as new, North as well as South.\r\n\r\n     \"I have always hated slavery as much as any Abolitionist. I have\r\n     always been an old-line Whig. I have always hated it, and I\r\n     always believed it in a course of ultimate extinction. If I were\r\n     in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question whether\r\n     slavery should be prohibited in a new territory, in spite of the\r\n     Dred Scott decision I would vote that it should.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confident tone of Mr. Lincoln's statement that he\r\ndid \"not expect the house to fall,\" it _did_ fall, and great was the\r\nfall thereof!\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, 9th of February, 1861, six seceding States met at\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, and organized an independent government. The\r\nordinances of secession were passed by the States as follows:\r\n\r\n  STATE.            DATE.            YEAS.

P.\r\nWalker; Secretary of Navy, John Perkins, Jr.; Postmaster-General, H.\r\nT. Ebett; Attorney-General, J. P. Benjamin.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the Confederate Government did not differ so very\r\nradically from the Federal Constitution. The following were the chief\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n     \"1. The importation of African negroes from any foreign country\r\n     other than the slave-holding States of the Confederate States is\r\n     hereby forbidden, and Congress is required to pass such laws as\r\n     shall effectually prevent the same.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Congress shall also have power to prohibit the introduction\r\n     of slaves from any State not a member of this Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     \"The Congress shall have power:\r\n\r\n     \"1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, for\r\n     revenue necessary to pay the debts and carry on the government of\r\n     the Confederacy, and all duties, imposts, and excises shall be\r\n     uniform throughout the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     \"A slave in one State escaping to another shall be delivered,\r\n     upon the claim of the party to whom said slave may belong, by the\r\n     Executive authority of the State in which such slave may be\r\n     found; and in any case of abduction or forcible rescue, full\r\n     compensation, including the value of slave, and all costs and\r\n     expense, shall be made to the party by the State in which such\r\n     abduction or rescue shall take place.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The government hereby instituted shall take immediate step's\r\n     for the settlement of all matters between the States forming it\r\n     and their late confederates of the United States in relation to\r\n     the public property and public debt at the time of their\r\n     withdrawal from them; these States hereby declaring it to be\r\n     their wish and earnest desire to adjust everything pertaining to\r\n     the common property, common liabilities, and common obligations\r\n     of that Union, upon principles of right, justice, equity, and\r\n     good faith.\"\r\n\r\nAt first blush it would appear that the new government had not been\r\nerected upon the slave question; that it had gone as far as the\r\nFederal Government to suppress the foreign slave-trade; and that\r\nnobler and sublimer ideas and motives had inspired and animated the\r\nSouthern people in their movement for a new government. But the men\r\nwho wrote the Confederate platform knew what they were about. They\r\nknew that to avoid the charge that would certainly be made against\r\nthem, of having seceded in order to make slavery a national\r\ninstitution, they must be careful not to exhibit such intentions in\r\ntheir Constitution. But that the South seceded on account of the\r\nslavery question, there can be no historical doubt whatever. Jefferson\r\nDavis, President, so-called, of the Confederate Government, said in\r\nhis Message, April 29, 1861:\r\n\r\n     \"When the several States delegated certain powers to the United\r\n     States Congress, a large portion of the laboring population\r\n     consisted of African slaves, imported into the colonies by the\r\n     mother-country. In twelve out of the thirteen States, negro\r\n     slavery existed; and the right of property in slaves was\r\n     protected by law. This property was recognized in the\r\n     Constitution; and provision was made against its loss by the\r\n     escape of the slave.\r\n\r\n     \"The increase in the number of slaves by further importation from\r\n     Africa was also secured by a clause forbidding Congress to\r\n     prohibit the slave-trade anterior to a certain date; and in no\r\n     clause can there be found any delegation of power to the\r\n     Congress, authorizing it in any manner to legislate to the\r\n     prejudice, detriment, or discouragement of the owners of that\r\n     species of property, or excluding it from the protection of the\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     \"The climate and soil of the Northern States soon proved\r\n     unpropitious to the continuance of slave labor; whilst the\r\n     converse was the case at the South. Under the unrestricted free\r\n     intercourse between the two sections, the Northern States\r\n     consulted their own interest, by selling their slaves to the\r\n     South, and prohibiting slavery within their limits. The South\r\n     were willing purchasers of a property suitable to their wants,\r\n     and paid the price of the acquisition without harboring a\r\n     suspicion that their quiet possession was to be disturbed by\r\n     those who were inhibited not only by want of constitutional\r\n     authority, but by good faith as vendors, from disquieting a title\r\n     emanating from themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"As soon, however, as the Northern States that prohibited\r\n     African slavery within their limits had reached a number\r\n     sufficient to give their representation a controlling voice in\r\n     the Congress, a persistent and organized system of hostile\r\n     measures against the rights of the owners of slaves in the\r\n     Southern States was inaugurated, and gradually extended. A\r\n     continuous series of measures was devised and prosecuted for the\r\n     purpose of rendering insecure the tenure of property in slaves.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"With interests of such overwhelming magnitude imperilled, the\r\n     people of the Southern States were driven by the conduct of the\r\n     North to the adoption of some course of action to avoid the\r\n     danger with which they were openly menaced. With this view, the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States invited the people to select\r\n     delegates to conventions to be held for the purpose of\r\n     determining for themselves what measures were best adapted to\r\n     meet so alarming a crisis in their history.\"[72]\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Stephens, Vice-President, as he was called, said, in a\r\nspeech delivered at Savannah, Georgia, 21st of March, 1861:\r\n\r\n     \"The new Constitution has put at rest _forever_ all the agitating\r\n     questions relating to our peculiar institution,--African slavery\r\n     as it exists amongst us, the proper status of the negro in our\r\n     form of civilization. _This was the immediate cause of the late\r\n     rupture and present revolution._ JEFFERSON, in his forecast, had\r\n     anticipated this, as the 'rock upon which the old Union would\r\n     split.' He was right. What was conjecture with him is now a\r\n     realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth\r\n     upon which that great rock _stood_ and _stands_, may be doubted.\r\n     _The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading\r\n     statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution,\r\n     were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the\r\n     laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially,\r\n     morally, and politically._ It was an evil they knew not well how\r\n     to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was,\r\n     that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the\r\n     institution would be evanescent, and pass away. This idea, though\r\n     not incorporated in the Constitution, was the prevailing idea at\r\n     the time. The Constitution, it is true, secured every essential\r\n     guarantee to the institution while it should last; and hence no\r\n     argument can be justly used against the constitutional guarantees\r\n     thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. _Those\r\n     ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the\r\n     assumption of the equality of races. This was an error._ It was a\r\n     sandy foundation; and the idea of a government built upon\r\n     it,--when the 'storm came and the wind blew, it _fell_.'\r\n\r\n     \"_Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas.\r\n     Its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great\r\n     truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that\r\n     slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and\r\n     normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the\r\n     history of the world, based upon this great physical,\r\n     philosophical, and moral truth._ This truth has been slow in the\r\n     process of its development, like all other truths in the various\r\n     departments of science. It has been so even amongst us. Many who\r\n     hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not\r\n     generally admitted, even within their day.\"[73]\r\n\r\nNow, then, what was the real issue between the Confederate States and\r\nthe United States? Why, it was extension of slavery by the former, and\r\nthe restriction of slavery by the latter. To put the issue as it was\r\nunderstood by Northern men--in poetic language, it was \"_The Union as\r\nit is_.\" While the South, at length, through its leaders, acknowledged\r\nthat slavery was their issue, the North, standing upon the last\r\nanalysis of the Free-Soil idea of resistance to the further\r\ninoculation of free territory with the virus of slavery, refused to\r\nrecognize slavery as an issue. But what did the battle cry of the\r\nloyal North, \"_The Union as it is_,\" mean? A Union half free and half\r\nslave; a dual government, if not in fact, certainly in the brains and\r\nhearts of the people; two civilizations at eternal and inevitable war\r\nwith each other; a Union with the canker-worm of slavery in it,\r\nimpairing its strength every year and threatening its life; a Union in\r\nwhich two hostile ideas of political economy were at work, and where\r\nunpaid slave labor was inimical to the interests of the free\r\nworkingmen. And it should not be forgotten that the Republican party\r\nacknowledged the right of Southerns to hunt slaves in the free States,\r\nand to return such slaves, under the fugitive-slave law, to their\r\nmasters. Mr. Lincoln was not an Abolitionist, as many people think.\r\nHis position on the question was clearly stated in the answers he gave\r\nto a number of questions put to him by Judge Douglass in the latter\r\npart of the summer of 1858. Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n     \"Having said this much, I will take up the judge's\r\n     interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago 'Times,'\r\n     and answer them _seriatim_. In order that there may be no mistake\r\n     about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also\r\n     my answers to them. The first one of these interrogatories is in\r\n     these words:\r\n\r\n     \"Question 1. 'I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as\r\n     he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the\r\n     Fugitive-Slave Law?'\r\n\r\n     \"Answer. I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the\r\n     unconditional repeal of the Fugitive-Slave Law.\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 2. 'I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day,\r\n     as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States\r\n     into the Union, even if the people want them?'\r\n\r\n     \"A. I do not now, nor ever did, stand pledged against the\r\n     admission of any more slave States into the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 3. 'I want to know whether he stands pledged against the\r\n     admission of a new State into the Union with such a constitution\r\n     as the people of that State may see fit to make.'\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 4. 'I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the\r\n     abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?'\r\n\r\n     \"A. I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in\r\n     the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 5. 'I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the\r\n     prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?'\r\n\r\n     \"A. I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade\r\n     between the different States.\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 6. 'I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit\r\n     slavery in all the territories of the United States, north as\r\n     well as south of the Missouri Compromise line?'\r\n\r\n     \"A. I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the\r\n     _right_ and _duty_ of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the\r\n     United States territories. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n     \"Q. 7. 'I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the\r\n     acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first\r\n     prohibited therein?'\r\n\r\n     \"A. I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of\r\n     territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose\r\n     such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition\r\n     would or would not agitate the slavery question among ourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination of\r\n     these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered\r\n     that I was not _pledged_ to this, that, or the other. The judge\r\n     has not framed his interrogatories to ask me any thing more than\r\n     this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the\r\n     interrogatories, and have answered truly that I am not _pledged_\r\n     at all upon any of the points to which I have answered. But I am\r\n     not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatories.\r\n     I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions,\r\n     and state what I really think upon them.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive-Slave Law, I have\r\n     never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I\r\n     think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of\r\n     the Southern States are entitled to a congressional slave law.\r\n     Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the\r\n     existing Fugitive-Slave Law, further than that I think it should\r\n     have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections\r\n     that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And\r\n     inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an\r\n     alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to\r\n     introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general\r\n     question of slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the\r\n     admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you\r\n     very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in\r\n     a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be\r\n     exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave\r\n     State admitted into the Union; but I must add, that if slavery\r\n     shall be kept out of the territories during the territorial\r\n     existence of any one given territory, and then the people shall,\r\n     having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt\r\n     the constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a\r\n     slave constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the\r\n     institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the\r\n     country, but to admit them into the Union. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n     \"The third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second,\r\n     it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.\r\n\r\n     \"The fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the\r\n     District of Columbia. In relation to that I have my mind very\r\n     distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery\r\n     abolished in the District of Columbia. I believe that Congress\r\n     possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet, as a\r\n     member of Congress, I should not, with my present views, be in\r\n     favor of _endeavoring_ to abolish slavery in the District of\r\n     Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: _First_, that\r\n     the abolition should be gradual; _second_, that it should be on a\r\n     vote of the majority of qualified voters in the district; and,\r\n     _third_, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners.\r\n     With these three conditions I confess I would be exceedingly glad\r\n     to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; and,\r\n     in the language of Henry Clay, 'sweep from our capital that foul\r\n     blot upon our nation.'\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here that, as\r\n     to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the\r\n     different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am\r\n     _pledged_ to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have\r\n     not given that mature consideration that would make me feel\r\n     authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely\r\n     bound by it. In other words, that question has never been\r\n     prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether\r\n     we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could\r\n     investigate it, if I had sufficient time, to bring myself to a\r\n     conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say\r\n     so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglass. I must say,\r\n     however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does\r\n     possess the constitutional power to abolish slave-trading among\r\n     the different States, I should still not be in favor of the\r\n     exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as\r\n     I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the\r\n     abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     \"My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be\r\n     prohibited in all territories of the United States, is full and\r\n     explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any\r\n     comments of mine. So, I suppose, in regard to the question\r\n     whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory\r\n     unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such\r\n     that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself\r\n     better understood, than the answer which I have placed in\r\n     writing.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, in all this the judge has me, and he has me on the record.\r\n     I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining\r\n     one set of opinions for one place, and another set for another\r\n     place--that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at\r\n     another. What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience\r\n     as strongly tending to abolitionism as any audience in the State\r\n     of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be\r\n     offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would\r\n     be offensive to persons in this audience.\"[74]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the position of Mr. Lincoln set forth with deliberation\r\nand care. He was opposed to any coercive measures in settling the\r\nslavery question; he was for gradual emancipation; and for admitting\r\nStates into the Union with a slave constitution. Within twenty-four\r\nmonths, without a change of views, he was nominated for and elected to\r\nthe Presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith no disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery, Mr.\r\nLincoln found himself chief magistrate of a great _nation_ in the\r\nmidst of a great rebellion. And in his inaugural address on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1861, he referred to the question of slavery again in a manner\r\ntoo clear to admit of misconception, affirming his previous views:\r\n\r\n     \"There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\r\n     from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly\r\n     written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\n     \"'No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law\r\n     or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor,\r\n     but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\n     service or labor may be due.'\r\n\r\n     \"It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by\r\n     those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive\r\n     slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.\r\n\r\n     \"All members of Congress swear their support to the whole\r\n     Constitution--to this provision as well as any other. To the\r\n     proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms\r\n     of this clause 'shall be delivered up,' their oaths are\r\n     unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper,\r\n     could they not, with nearly equal unanimity, frame and pass a law\r\n     by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?\r\n\r\n     \"There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\r\n     be enforced by National or by State authority; but surely that\r\n     difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be\r\n     surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to\r\n     others by which authority it is done; and should any one, in any\r\n     case, be content that this oath shall go unkept on a merely\r\n     unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?\"\r\n\r\nSo the issues were joined in war. The South aggressively, offensively\r\nsought the extension and perpetuation of slavery. The North passively,\r\ndefensively stood ready to protect her free territory, but not to\r\ninterfere with slavery. And there was no day during the first two\r\nyears of the war when the North would not have cheerfully granted the\r\nslave institution an indefinite lease of _legal_ existence upon the\r\ncondition that the war should cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] National Intelligencer, Tuesday, May 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n[73] National Intelligencer, Tuesday, April, 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n[74] Barrett, pp. 177-180.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\"A WHITE MAN'S WAR.\"\r\n\r\n     THE FIRST CALL FOR TROOPS.--RENDITION OF FUGITIVE SLAVES BY THE\r\n     ARMY.--COL.

The Federal\r\nGovernment planted itself upon the policy of the \"defence of the free\r\nStates,\"--pursued a defensive rather than an offensive policy. And,\r\nwhenever the Negro was mentioned, the leaders of the political parties\r\nand the Union army declared that it was \"_a white mans war_.\"\r\n\r\nThe first call for three months' troops indicated that the authorities\r\nat Washington felt confident that the \"trouble\" would not last long.\r\nThe call was issued on the 15th of April, 1861, and provided for the\r\nraising of 75,000 troops. It was charged by the President that certain\r\nStates had been guilty of forming \"combinations too powerful to be\r\nsuppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,\" and then\r\nhe proceeded to state:\r\n\r\n     \"The details for this object will be immediately communicated to\r\n     the State authorities through the War Department. I appeal to all\r\n     loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort to\r\n     maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our\r\n     National Union, and the perpetuity of popular government, and to\r\n     redress wrongs already long enough endured. I deem it proper to\r\n     say that the first service assigned to the forces hereby called\r\n     forth, will probably be to repossess the forts, places, and\r\n     property which have been seized from the Union; and in every\r\n     event the utmost care will be observed, consistently with the\r\n     objects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation, any destruction of,\r\n     or interference with, property, or any disturbance of peaceful\r\n     citizens of any part of the country; and I hereby command the\r\n     persons composing the combinations aforesaid, to disperse and\r\n     retire peaceably to their respective abodes within twenty days\r\n     from this date.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely a city in the North, from New York to San\r\nFrancisco, whose Colored residents did not speedily offer their\r\nservices to the States to aid in suppressing the Rebellion. But\r\neverywhere as promptly were their services declined. The Colored\r\npeople of the Northern States were patriotic and enthusiastic; but\r\ntheir interest was declared insolence. And being often rebuked for\r\ntheir loyalty, they subsided into silence to bide a change of public\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nThe almost unanimous voice of the press and pulpit was against a\r\nrecognition of the Negro as the cause of the war. Like a man in the\r\nlast stages of consumption who insists that he has only a bad cold, so\r\nthe entire North urged that slavery was not the cause of the war: it\r\nwas a little local misunderstanding. But the death of the gallant Col.\r\nElmer E. Elsworth palsied the tongues of mere talkers; and in the\r\ntragic silence that followed, great, brave, and true men began to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nNot a pulpit in all the land had spoken a word for the slave. The\r\nclergy stood dumb before the dreadful issue. But one man was found,\r\nlike David of old, who, gathering his smooth pebble of fact from the\r\nbrook of God's eternal truth, boldly met the boastful and erroneous\r\npublic sentiment of the hour. That man was the Rev. Justin D. Fulton,\r\na Baptist minister of Albany, New York. He was chosen to preach the\r\nfuneral sermon of Col. Elsworth, and performed that duty on Sunday,\r\nMay 26, 1861. Speaking of slavery, the reverend gentleman said:\r\n\r\n     \"Shall this magazine of danger be permitted to remain? _We must\r\n     answer this question. If we say no, it is no!_ Slavery is a curse\r\n     to the North. It impoverishes the South, and demoralizes both. It\r\n     is the parent of treason, the seedling of tyranny, and the\r\n     fountain-source of all the ills that have infected our life as a\r\n     people, being the central cause of all our conflicts of the past\r\n     and the war of to-day. What reason have we for permitting it to\r\n     remain? God does not want it, for His truth gives freedom. The\r\n     South does not need it, for it is the chain fastened to her limb\r\n     that fetters her progress. Morality, patriotism, and humanity\r\n     alike protest against it.\r\n\r\n     \"The South fights for slavery, for the despotism which it\r\n     represents, for the ignoring the rights of labor, and for\r\n     reducing to slavery or to serfdom all whose hands are hardened by\r\n     toil.\r\n\r\n     \"Why not make the issue at once, which shall inspire every man\r\n     that shoulders his musket with a noble purpose? Our soldiers need\r\n     to be reminded that this government was consecrated to freedom by\r\n     those who first built here the altars of worship, and planted on\r\n     the shore of the Western Continent the tree of liberty, whose\r\n     fruit to-day fills the garners of national hope.... I would not\r\n     forget that I am a messenger of the Prince of Peace. My motives\r\n     for throwing out these suggestions are three-fold: 1. Because I\r\n     believe God wants us to be actuated by motives not one whit less\r\n     philanthropic than the giving of freedom to four million of\r\n     people. 2. I confess to a sympathy for and faith in the slave,\r\n     and cherish the belief that if freed, the war would become\r\n     comparatively bloodless, and that as a people we should enter on\r\n     the discharge of higher duties and a more enlarged prosperity. 3.\r\n     The war would hasten to a close, and the end secured would then\r\n     form a brilliant dawn to a career of prosperity unsurpassed in\r\n     the annals of mankind.\"[76]\r\n\r\nBrave, prophetic words! But a thousand vituperative editors sprang at\r\nMr. Fulton's utterances, and as snapping curs, growled at and shook\r\nevery sentence. He stood his ground. He took no step backward. When\r\nnotice was kindly sent him that a committee would wait on him to treat\r\nhim to a coat of tar and feathers, against the entreaties of anxious\r\nfriends, he sent word that he would give them a warm reception. When\r\nthe best citizens of Albany said the draft could not be enforced\r\nwithout bloody resistance, the Rev. Mr. Fulton exclaimed: \"If the\r\nfloodgates of blood are to be opened, we will not shoot down the poor\r\nand ignorant, but the swaggering and insolent men whose hearts are not\r\nin this war!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Atlas and Argus,\" in an editorial on _Ill-Timed Pulpit\r\nAbolitionism_, denounced Rev. Mr. Fulton in bitterest terms; while the\r\n\"Evening Standard\" and \"Journal\" both declared that the views of the\r\npreacher were as a fire-brand thrown into the magazine of public\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nEverywhere throughout the North the Negro was counted as on the\r\noutside. Everywhere it was merely \"a war for the Union,\" which was\r\nhalf free and half slave.\r\n\r\nWhen the Union army got into the field at the South it was confronted\r\nby a difficult question. What should be done with the Negroes who\r\nsought the Union lines for protection from their masters? The\r\nsentiment of the press, Congress, and the people of the North\r\ngenerally, was against interference with the slave, either by the\r\ncivil or military authorities. And during the first years of the war\r\nthe army became a band of slave-catchers. Slave-holders and sheriffs\r\nfrom the Southern States were permitted to hunt fugitive slaves under\r\nthe Union flag and within the lines of Federal camps. On the 22d of\r\nJune, 1861, the following paragraph appeared in the \"Baltimore\r\nAmerican\":\r\n\r\n     \"Two free negroes, belonging to Frederick, Md., who concealed\r\n     themselves in the cars which conveyed the Rhode Island regiment\r\n     to Washington from this city, were returned that morning by\r\n     command of Colonel Burnside, who _supposed them to be slaves_.\r\n     The negroes were accompanied by a sergeant of the regiment, who\r\n     lodged them in jail.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1861, Col. Tyler, of the 7th Ohio regiment,\r\ndelivered an address to the people of Virginia; a portion of which is\r\nsufficient to show the feeling that prevailed among army officers on\r\nthe slavery question:\r\n\r\n     \"To you, fellow-citizens of West Virginia--many of whom I have so\r\n     long and favorably known,--I come to aid and protect. [The\r\n     grammar is defective.]\r\n\r\n     \"I have no selfish ambition to gratify, no personal motives to\r\n     actuate. I am here to protect you in person and property--to aid\r\n     you in the execution of the law, in the maintenance of peace and\r\n     order, in the defence of the Constitution and the Union, and in\r\n     the extermination of our common foe. As our enemies have belied\r\n     our mission, and represented us as a band of Abolitionists, I\r\n     desire to assure you that the relation of master and servant as\r\n     recognized in your State shall be respected. Your authority over\r\n     that species of property shall not in the least be interfered\r\n     with. To this end I assure you that those under my command have\r\n     peremptory orders to take up and hold any negroes found running\r\n     about the camp without passes from their masters.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a few copies had been struck off, a lieutenant in Captain G. W.\r\nShurtleff's company handed him one. He waited upon the colonel, and\r\ntold him that it was not true that the troops had been ordered to\r\narrest fugitive slaves. The colonel threatened to place Captain\r\nShurtleff in arrest, when he exclaimed: \"I'll never be a\r\nslave-catcher, so help me God!\" There were few men in the army at this\r\ntime who sympathized with such a noble declaration, and, therefore,\r\nCaptain Shurtleff found himself in a very small minority.\r\n\r\nThe following account of an attempt to secure a fugitive slave from\r\nGeneral Isaac R. Sherwood has its historical value. General Sherwood\r\nwas as noble a _man_ as he was a brave and intelligent soldier. He\r\nobeyed the still small voice in his soul and won a victory for\r\nhumanity:\r\n\r\n     \"In the February and March of 1863, I was a major in command of\r\n     111th O. V. I regiment. I had a servant, as indicated by army\r\n     regulations, in charge of my private horse. He was from\r\n     Frankfort, Ky., the property of a Baptist clergyman. When the\r\n     troops passed through Frankfort, in the fall of 1862, he left his\r\n     master, and followed the army. He came to me at Bowling Green,\r\n     and I hired him to take care of my horse. He was a lad about\r\n     fifteen years old, named _Alfred Jackson_.\r\n\r\n     \"At this time, Brig.-Gen. Boyle, or Boyd (I think Boyle), was in\r\n     command of the District of Kentucky, and had issued his general\r\n     order, that fugitive slaves should be delivered up. Brig.-Gen. H.\r\n     M. Judah was in command of Post of Bowling Green, also of our\r\n     brigade, there stationed.\r\n\r\n     \"The owner of Alfred Jackson found out his whereabouts, and sent\r\n     a U. S. marshal to Bowling Green to get him. Said marshal came to\r\n     my headquarters under a pretence to see my very fine\r\n     saddle-horse, but really to identify Alfred Jackson. The horse\r\n     was brought out by Alfred Jackson. The marshal went to Brig.-Gen.\r\n     Judah's headquarters and got a written order addressed to me,\r\n     describing the lad and ordering me to deliver the boy. This order\r\n     was delivered to me by Col. Sterling, of Gen. Judah's staff, in\r\n     person. I refused to obey it. I sent word to Gen. Judah that he\r\n     could have my sword, but while I commanded that regiment no\r\n     fugitive slave should ever be delivered to his master. The\r\n     officer made my compliments to Gen. Judah as aforesaid, and I was\r\n     placed under arrest for disobedience to orders, and my sword\r\n     taken from me.\r\n\r\n     \"In a few days the command was ordered to move to Glasgow, Ky.,\r\n     and Gen. Judah, not desiring to trust the regiment in command of\r\n     a captain, I was temporarily restored to command, pending the\r\n     meeting of a court-martial to try my case. When the command moved\r\n     I took Alfred Jackson along. After we reached Glasgow, Ky., Gen.\r\n     Judah sent for me, and said if I would then deliver up Alfred\r\n     Jackson he would restore me to command. The United States marshal\r\n     was present. This I again refused to do.\r\n\r\n     \"The same day, I sent an ambulance out of the lines, with Alfred\r\n     Jackson tucked under the seat, in charge of a man going North,\r\n     and I gave him money to get to Hillsdale, Michigan, where he\r\n     went, and where he resided and grew up to be a good man and a\r\n     citizen. I called the attention of Hon. James M. Ashley (then\r\n     Member of Congress) to the matter, and under instructions from\r\n     Secretary Stanton, Gen. Boyle's order was revoked, and I never\r\n     delivered a fugitive, nor was I ever tried.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi, in 1862, Col. James B. Steedman (afterward\r\nmajor-general) refused to honor an order of Gen. Fry, delivered by the\r\nman who wanted the slave in Steedman's camp. Col. Steedman read the\r\norder and told the bearer that he was a rebel; that he could not\r\nsearch _his_ camp; and that he would give him just ten minutes to get\r\nout of the camp, or he would riddle him with bullets. When Gen. Fry\r\nasked for an explanation of his refusal to allow his camp to be\r\nsearched, Col. Steedman said he would never consent to have his camp\r\nsearched by a _rebel_; that he would use every bayonet in his regiment\r\nto protect the Negro slave who had come to him for protection; and\r\nthat he was sustained by the Articles of War, which had been amended\r\nabout that time.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the late summer of 1863, at Tuscumbia, Tennessee, Gen. Fry\r\nrode into Col. Steedman's camp to secure the return of the slaves of\r\nan old lady whom he had known before the war. Col. Steedman said he\r\ndid not know that any slaves were in his camp; and that if they were\r\nthere they should not be taken except they were willing to go. Gen.\r\nFry was a Christian gentleman of a high Southern type, and combined\r\nwith his loyalty to the Union an abiding faith in \"the sacredness of\r\nslave property.\" Whether he ever recovered from the malady, history\r\nsaith not.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of regular army officers were in sympathy with the\r\nidea of protecting slave property. Gen. T. W. Sherman, occupying the\r\ndefences of Port Royal, in October, 1861, issued the following\r\nproclamation to the people of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n     \"In obedience to the orders of the President of these United\r\n     States of America, I have landed on your shores with a small\r\n     force of National troops. The dictates of a duty which, under\r\n     the Constitution, I owe to a great sovereign State, and to a\r\n     proud and hospitable people, among whom I have passed some of the\r\n     pleasantest days of my life, prompt me to proclaim that we have\r\n     come among you with no feelings of personal animosity; no desire\r\n     to harm your citizens, destroy your property, or interfere with\r\n     any of your lawful rights, or your social and local institutions,\r\n     beyond what the causes herein briefly alluded to may render\r\n     unavoidable.\"[77]\r\n\r\nThis proclamation sounds as if the general were a firm believer in\r\nState sovereignty; and that he was possessed with a feeling that he\r\nhad landed in some strange land, among a people of different\r\ncivilization and peculiar institutions.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November, 1861, Major-Gen. John A. Dix, upon taking\r\npossession of the counties of Accomac and Northampton, Va., issued the\r\nfollowing proclamation:\r\n\r\n     \"The military forces of the United States are about to enter your\r\n     counties as a part of the Union. They will go among you as\r\n     friends, and with the earnest hope that they may not, by your own\r\n     acts, be compelled to become your enemies. They will invade no\r\n     right of person or property. On the contrary, your laws, your\r\n     institutions, your usages, will be scrupulously respected. There\r\n     need be no fear that the quietude of any fireside will be\r\n     disturbed, unless the disturbance is caused by yourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"Special directions have been given not to interfere with the\r\n     condition of any person held to domestic servitude; and, in order\r\n     that there may be no ground for mistake or pretext for\r\n     misrepresentation, commanders of regiments or corps have been\r\n     instructed not to permit such persons to come within their\r\n     lines.\"[78]\r\n\r\nGen. Halleck, while in command of the Union forces in Missouri, issued\r\nhis \"Order No. 3.\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It has been represented that important information, respecting\r\n     the number and condition of our forces, is conveyed to the enemy\r\n     by means of fugitive slaves who are admitted within our lines. In\r\n     order to remedy this evil, it is directed that no such person be\r\n     hereafter permitted to enter the lines of any camp, or of any\r\n     forces on the march, and that any now within such lines be\r\n     immediately excluded therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of February, 1862, in \"Order No. 13,\" he referred to the\r\nslave question as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It does not belong to the military to decide upon the relation\r\n     of master and slave. Such questions must be settled by the civil\r\n     courts. No fugitive slaves will, therefore, be admitted within\r\n     our lines or camps, except when specially ordered by the general\r\n     commanding.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February, 1862, Major-Gen. A. E. Burnside issued a\r\nproclamation in which he said to the people:\r\n\r\n     \"The Government asks only that its authority may be recognized;\r\n     and we repeat, in no manner or way does it desire to interfere\r\n     with your laws, constitutionally established, your institutions\r\n     of any kind whatever, your property of any sort, or your usages\r\n     in any respect.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Gen. Buell shows how deeply attached he was\r\nto the \"constitutional guaranties\" accorded to the rebels of the\r\nSouth:\r\n\r\n                              \"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, }\r\n                                       \"NASHVILLE, March 6, 1862.   }\r\n\r\n     \"_Dear Sir_: I have the honor to receive your communication of\r\n     the 1st instant, on the subject of fugitive slaves in the camps\r\n     of the army.\r\n\r\n     \"It has come to my knowledge that slaves sometimes make their way\r\n     improperly into our lines; and in some instances they may be\r\n     enticed there; but I think the number has been magnified by\r\n     report. Several applications have been made to me by persons\r\n     whose servants have been found in our camps; and in every\r\n     instance that I know of the master has recovered his servant and\r\n     taken him away.\r\n\r\n     \"I need hardly remind you that there will always be found some\r\n     lawless and mischievous person in every army; but I assure you\r\n     that the mass of this army is law-abiding, and that it is neither\r\n     its disposition nor its policy to violate law or the rights of\r\n     individuals in any particular. With great respect, your obedient\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n                                                \"D. C. BUELL,\r\n                                  \"_Brig.-Gen.

Buell's camp!\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, 1862, Gen. Joseph Hooker, commanding the \"Upper\r\nPotomac,\" issued the following order:\r\n\r\n     \"_To Brigade and Regimental Commanders of this Division_:\r\n\r\n     \"Messrs. Nally, Gray, Dunnington, Dent, Adams, Speake, Price,\r\n     Posey, and Cobey, citizens of Maryland, have negroes supposed to\r\n     be with some of the regiments of this division. The\r\n     brigadier-general commanding directs that they be permitted to\r\n     visit all the camps of his command, in search of their property;\r\n     and if found, that they be allowed to take possession of the\r\n     same, without any interference whatever. Should any obstacle be\r\n     thrown in their way by any officer or soldier in the division, he\r\n     will be at once reported by the regimental commander to these\r\n     headquarters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1862, Gen. Thos. Williams, in the Department of the\r\nGulf, issued the following order[79]:\r\n\r\n     \"In consequence of the demoralizing and disorganizing tendencies\r\n     to the troops of harboring runaway negroes, it is hereby ordered\r\n     that the respective commanders of the camps and garrisons of the\r\n     several regiments, 2d brigade, turn all such fugitives in their\r\n     camps or garrisons out beyond the limits of their respective\r\n     guards and sentinels.\r\n\r\n                                   \"By order of\r\n                                          \"Brig.-Gen. T. WILLIAMS.\"[80]\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, July 7, 1862,\"\r\nMajor-Gen. Geo. B. McClellan made the following observations\r\nconcerning slavery:\r\n\r\n     \"This Rebellion has assumed the character of a war; as such it\r\n     should be regarded; and it should be conducted upon the highest\r\n     principles known to Christian civilization. It should not be a\r\n     war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State, in any\r\n     event. It should not be at all a war upon populations, but\r\n     against armed forces and political organizations. Neither\r\n     confiscation of property, political executions of persons,\r\n     territorial organization of States, nor forcible abolition of\r\n     slavery should be contemplated for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nBut the drift of the sentiment of the army was in the direction of\r\ncompromise with the slavery question. Nearly every statesman at\r\nWashington--in the White House and in the Congress--and nearly every\r\nofficer in the army regarded the Negro question as purely political\r\nand not military. That it was a problem hard of solution no one could\r\ndoubt. Hundreds of loyal Negroes, upon the orders of general\r\nofficers, were turned away from the Union lines, while those who had\r\ngotten on the inside were driven forth to the cruel vengeance of rebel\r\nmasters. Who could solve the problem? Major-Gen. Benjamin F. Butler\r\nbanished the politician, and became the loyal, patriotic _soldier_! In\r\nthe month of May, 1861, during the time Gen. Butler commanded the\r\nUnion forces at Fortress Monroe, three slaves made good their escape\r\ninto his lines. They stated that they were owned by Col. Mallory, of\r\nthe Confederate forces in the front; that he was about to send them to\r\nthe North Carolina seaboard to work on rebel fortifications; and that\r\nthe fortifications were intended to bar that coast against the Union\r\narms. Having heard this statement, Gen. Butler, viewing the matter\r\nfrom a purely military stand-point, exclaimed: \"These men are\r\n_contraband_ of war; set them at work.\" Here was a solution of the\r\nentire problem; here was a blow delivered at the backbone of the\r\nRebellion. He claimed no right to act as a politician, but acting as a\r\nloyal-hearted, clear-headed _soldier_, he coined a word and hurled a\r\nshaft at the enemy that struck him in a part as vulnerable as the heel\r\nof Achilles. In his letter to the Lieut.-Gen. of the Army, Winfield\r\nScott, 27th of May, 1861, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Since I wrote my last, the question in regard to slave property\r\n     is becoming one of very serious magnitude. The inhabitants of\r\n     Virginia are using their negroes in the batteries, and are\r\n     preparing to send their women and children South. The escapes\r\n     from them are very numerous, and a squad has come in this\r\n     morning, and my pickets are bringing in their women and children.\r\n     Of course these can not be dealt with upon the theory on which I\r\n     designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who\r\n     might come within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed\r\n     account in my last dispatch.\r\n\r\n     \"I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of\r\n     property. Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and\r\n     women, with their children,--entire families,--each family\r\n     belonging to the same owner. I have therefore determined to\r\n     employ--as I can do very profitably--the able-bodied persons in\r\n     the party, issuing proper food for the support of all; charging\r\n     against their services the expense of care and sustenance of the\r\n     non-laborers; keeping a strict and accurate account, as well of\r\n     the services as of the expenditures; having the worth of the\r\n     services and the cost of the expenditures determined by a board\r\n     of survey hereafter to be detailed. I know of no other manner in\r\n     which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected\r\n     therewith. As a matter of property, to the insurgents it will be\r\n     of very great moment--the number that I now have amounting, as I\r\n     am informed, to what in good times would be of the value of\r\n     $60,000.\r\n\r\n     \"Twelve of these negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the\r\n     erection of the batteries on Sewell's Point, which fired upon my\r\n     expedition as it passed by out of range. As a means of offense,\r\n     therefore, in the enemy's hands, these negroes, when able-bodied,\r\n     are of great importance. Without them the batteries could not\r\n     have been erected; at least, for many weeks. As a military\r\n     question it would seem to be a measure of necessity, and deprives\r\n     their masters of their services.\r\n\r\n     \"How can this be done? As a political question, and a question of\r\n     humanity, can I receive the services of a father and a mother and\r\n     not take the children? Of the humanitarian aspect, I have no\r\n     doubt; of the political one, I have no right to judge. I\r\n     therefore submit all this to your better judgment, and, as these\r\n     questions have a political aspect, I have ventured--and I trust I\r\n     am not wrong in so doing--to duplicate the parts of my dispatch\r\n     relating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of\r\n     War.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                \"BENJ.

Butler was laid before the Secretary of War, who\r\nanswered it as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: Your action in respect to the negroes who came within your\r\n     lines, from the service of the rebels, is approved. The\r\n     Department is sensible of the embarrassments which must surround\r\n     officers conducting military operations in a State, by the laws\r\n     of which slavery is sanctioned. The Government can not recognize\r\n     the rejection by any State of its Federal obligations, resting\r\n     upon itself. Among these Federal obligations, however, no one can\r\n     be more important than that of suppressing and dispersing any\r\n     combination of the former for the purpose of overthrowing its\r\n     whole constitutional authority. While, therefore, you will permit\r\n     no interference, by persons under your command, with the\r\n     relations of persons held to service under the laws of any State,\r\n     you will, on the other hand, so long as any State within which\r\n     your military operations are conducted remains under the control\r\n     of such armed combinations, refrain from surrendering to alleged\r\n     masters any persons who come within your lines. You will employ\r\n     such persons in the services to which they will be best adapted;\r\n     keeping an account of the labor by them performed, of the value\r\n     of it, and the expenses of their maintenance. The question of\r\n     their final disposition will be reserved for future\r\n     determination.\r\n\r\n                                   \"SIMON CAMERON, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n     \"To Maj.-Gen. BUTLER.\r\n\r\nIn an account of the life and services of Capt. Grier Talmadge, the\r\n\"Times\" correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     \"To the deceased, who was conservative in his views and actions,\r\n     belongs the credit of first enunciating the 'contraband' idea as\r\n     subsequently applied in the practical treatment of the slaves of\r\n     rebels, Early in the spring of 1861, Flag-Officer Pendergrast, in\r\n     command of the frigate 'Cumberland,' then the vessel blockading\r\n     the Roads, restored to their owners certain slaves that had\r\n     escaped from Norfolk. Shortly after, the Flag-Officer, Gen.\r\n     Butler, Capt. Talmadge, and the writer chanced to meet in the\r\n     ramparts of the fortress, when Capt. T. took occasion, warmly,\r\n     but respectfully, to dissent from the policy of the act, and\r\n     proceeded to advance some arguments in support of his views.\r\n     Turning to Gen. Butler, who had just assumed command of this\r\n     department, he said: 'General, it is a question you will have to\r\n     decide, and that, too, very soon; for in less than twenty-four\r\n     hours deserting slaves will commence swarming to your lines. The\r\n     rebels are employing their slaves in thousands in constructing\r\n     batteries all around us. And, in my judgment, in view of this\r\n     fact, not only slaves who take refuge within our lines are\r\n     contrabands, but I hold it as much our duty to seize and capture\r\n     those employed, or intended to be employed, in constructing\r\n     batteries, as it is to destroy the arsenals or any other\r\n     war-making element of the rebels, or to capture and destroy the\r\n     batteries themselves.' Within two days after this conversation,\r\n     Gen. Butler has the question practically presented to him, as\r\n     predicted, and he solved it by applying the views advanced by the\r\n     deceased.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThe conservative policy of Congress, the cringing attitude of the\r\nGovernment at Washington, the reverses on the Potomac, the disaster of\r\nBull Run, the apologetic tone of the Northern press, the expulsion of\r\nslaves from the Union lines, and the conduct of \"Copperheads\" in the\r\nNorth--who crawled upon their stomachs, snapping and biting at the\r\nheels of Union men and Union measures,--bred a spirit of unrest and\r\nmob violence. It was not enough that the service of free Negroes was\r\ndeclined; they were now hunted out and persecuted by mobs and other\r\nagents of the disloyal element at the North. Like a man sick unto\r\ndeath the Government insisted that it only had a slight cold, and that\r\nit would be better soon. The President was no better informed as to\r\nthe nature of the war than other conservative Republicans. On the 19th\r\nof August, 1862, Horace Greeley addressed an open letter to the\r\nPresident, known as \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions,\" of which the\r\nfollowing are specimen passages:\r\n\r\n     \"On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one\r\n     disinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union\r\n     cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the\r\n     Rebellion, and at the same time uphold its inciting cause, are\r\n     preposterous and futile--that the Rebellion, if crushed out\r\n     to-morrow, would be renewed within a year if slavery were left in\r\n     full vigor--that army officers, who remain to this day devoted to\r\n     slavery, can at best be but half-way loyal to the Union--and that\r\n     every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and\r\n     deepened peril to the Union. I appeal to the testimony of your\r\n     Embassadors in Europe. It is freely at your service, not mine.\r\n     Ask them to tell you candidly whether the seeming subserviency of\r\n     your policy to the slave-holding, slavery-upholding interest, is\r\n     not the perplexity, the despair, of statesmen of all parties; and\r\n     be admonished by the general answer!\r\n\r\n     \"I close, as I began, with the statement that what an immense\r\n     majority of the loyal millions of your countrymen require of you\r\n     is a frank, declared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the\r\n     laws of the land, more especially of the Confiscation Act. That\r\n     Act gives freedom to the slaves of rebels coming within our\r\n     lines, or whom those lines may at any time inclose,--we ask you\r\n     to render it due obedience by publicly requiring all your\r\n     subordinates to recognize and obey it. The rebels are everywhere\r\n     using the late anti-negro riots in the North--as they have long\r\n     used your officers' treatment of negroes in the South--to\r\n     convince the slaves that they have nothing to hope from a Union\r\n     success--that we mean in that case to sell them into a bitter\r\n     bondage to defray the cost of the war. Let them impress this as a\r\n     truth on the great mass of their ignorant and credulous bondmen,\r\n     and the Union will never be restored--never. We can not conquer\r\n     ten millions of people united in solid phalanx against us,\r\n     powerfully aided by Northern sympathizers and European allies. We\r\n     must have scouts, guides, spies, cooks, teamsters, diggers, and\r\n     choppers, from the blacks of the South--whether we allow them to\r\n     fight for us or not--or we shall be baffled and repelled. As one\r\n     of the millions who would gladly have avoided this struggle at\r\n     any sacrifice but that of principle and honor, but who now feel\r\n     that the triumph of the Union is indispensable not only to the\r\n     existence of our country, but to the well-being of mankind, I\r\n     entreat you to render a hearty and unequivocal obedience to the\r\n     law of the land.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Yours,\r\n                                       \"HORACE GREELEY.\"[83]\r\n\r\nIt was an open letter. Mr. Greeley had evidently lost sight of his\r\neconomic theories as applied to slavery in the abstract, and now, as a\r\npractical philosopher, caught hold of the question by the handle. Mr.\r\nLincoln replied within a few days, but was still joined to his\r\nabstract theories of constitutional law. He loved the Union, and all\r\nhe should do for the slave should be done to help the Union, not the\r\nslave. He was not desirous of saving or destroying slavery. But\r\ncertainly he had spoken more wisely than he knew when he had asserted,\r\na few years before, that \"a nation half free and half slave, could not\r\nlong exist.\" That was an indestructible truth. Had he adhered to that\r\ndoctrine the way would have been easier. In every thing he consulted\r\nthe Constitution. His letter is interesting reading.\r\n\r\n                                   \"EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,}\r\n                                                 \"August 22, 1862.}\r\n\r\n     \"Hon.

Acting upon the plainest principle of\r\nmilitary law, Major-General John C. Fremont, commanding the Department\r\nof the Missouri, or the Union forces in that State, issued the\r\nfollowing proclamation:\r\n\r\n                              \"HEADQUARTERS OF THE WESTERN DEP'T,}\r\n                                     \"ST. LOUIS, August 31st.    }\r\n\r\n     \"Circumstances, in my judgment, of sufficient urgency, render it\r\n     necessary that the Commanding General of this Department should\r\n     assume the administrative power of the State. Its disorganized\r\n     condition, the helplessness of the civil authority, the total\r\n     insecurity of life, and the devastation of property by bands of\r\n     murderers and marauders, who infest nearly every county in the\r\n     State, and avail themselves of the public misfortunes and the\r\n     vicinity of a hostile force to gratify private and neighborhood\r\n     vengeance, and who find an enemy wherever they find plunder,\r\n     finally demand the severest measures to repress the daily\r\n     increasing crimes and outrages which are driving off the\r\n     inhabitants and ruining the State. In this condition, the public\r\n     safety and the success of our arms require unity of purpose,\r\n     without let or hindrance to the prompt administration of affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"In order, therefore, to suppress disorders, to maintain, as far\r\n     as now practicable, the public peace, and to give security and\r\n     protection to the persons and property of loyal citizens, I do\r\n     hereby extend and declare established martial law throughout the\r\n     Stale of Missouri. The lines of the army of occupation in this\r\n     State are, for the present, declared to extend from Leavenworth,\r\n     by way of the posts of Jefferson City, Rolla, and Ironton, to\r\n     Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n     All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands, within\r\n     these lines, shall be tried by Court Martial, and, if found\r\n     guilty, will be shot.

But it is not intended to suspend the ordinary\r\n     tribunals of the country, where the law will be administered by\r\n     the civil officers in the usual manner and with their customary\r\n     authority, while the same can be peaceably exercised.\r\n\r\n     \"The Commanding General will labor vigilantly for the public\r\n     welfare, and, in his efforts for their safety, hopes to obtain\r\n     not only the acquiescence, but the active support, of the people\r\n     of the country.\r\n\r\n                              \"J. C. FREMONT, _Major-Gen.

This Gen. Fremont declined to do unless ordered to do so by\r\nhis superior. Accordingly the President wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   \"WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n     \"Major-Gen. JOHN C. FREMONT:\r\n\r\n     \"_Sir_:--Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d inst., is\r\n     just received. Assured that you, upon the ground, could better\r\n     judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this\r\n     distance, on seeing your proclamation of August 30th, I\r\n     perceived no general objection to it; the particular clause,\r\n     however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the\r\n     liberation of slaves, appeared to me to be objectionable in its\r\n     non-conformity to the Act of Congress, passed the 6th of last\r\n     August, upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you, expressing\r\n     my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly. Your\r\n     answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part that\r\n     I should make an open order for the modification, which I very\r\n     cheerfully do. It is, therefore, ordered that the said clause of\r\n     said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed, as to\r\n     conform with, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same\r\n     subject contained in the Act of Congress entitled 'An Act to\r\n     Confiscate Property Used for Insurrectionary Purposes,' approved\r\n     August 6, 1861; and that the said act be published at length with\r\n     this order.\r\n\r\n                                        \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                     \"A.

He was in advance of the\r\nslow coach at Washington, and was sent where he could do no harm to\r\nthe enemy of the country, by emancipating Negroes. It seems as if\r\nthere were nothing else left for Gen. Fremont to do but to free the\r\nslaves in his military district. They were the bone and sinew of\r\nConfederate resistance. It was to weaken the enemy that the general\r\nstruck down this peculiar species of property, upon which the enemy of\r\nthe country relied so entirely.\r\n\r\nMajor-Gen. David Hunter assumed command at Hilton Head, South\r\nCarolina, on the 31st of March, 1862. On the 9th of May he issued the\r\nfollowing \"General Order:\"\r\n\r\n                                   \"HEADQUARTERS DEP'T OF THE SOUTH,\r\n                                   \"HILTON HEAD, S.

The persons in these States--Georgia, Florida, and\r\n     South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared\r\n     forever free.\"[87]\r\n\r\nBut the President, in ten days after its publication, rescinded the\r\norder of General Hunter, in the following Proclamation:\r\n\r\n     \"_And whereas_, The same [Hunter's proclamation] is producing\r\n     some excitement and misunderstanding, therefore, I, Abraham\r\n     Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare\r\n     that the Government of the United States had no knowledge or\r\n     belief of an intention on the part of Gen. Hunter to issue such a\r\n     proclamation, nor has it yet any authentic information that the\r\n     document is genuine: and, further, that neither Gen. Hunter nor\r\n     any other commander or person have been authorized by the\r\n     Government of the United States to make proclamation declaring\r\n     the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation\r\n     now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void, so\r\n     far as respects such declaration. I further make known that,\r\n     whether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\n     and Navy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free; and\r\n     whether at any time, or in any case, it shall have become a\r\n     necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the Government to\r\n     exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my\r\n     responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel\r\n     justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field.\r\n\r\n     \"Those are totally different questions from those of police\r\n     regulations in armies or in camps.\r\n\r\n     \"On the sixth day of March last, by a special Message, I\r\n     recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be\r\n     substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'_Resolved_, That the United States ought to coöperate with any\r\n     State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to\r\n     such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its\r\n     discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and\r\n     private, produced by such change of system.'\r\n\r\n     \"The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by\r\n     large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an\r\n     authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the\r\n     States and people most interested in the subject-matter.

Our\r\ntreasury was empty; our bonds depreciated; our credit poor; our\r\nindustries languishing; and the channels of commerce were choked.\r\nEuropean governments were growing impatient at the dilatory policy of\r\nour nation; and every day we were losing sympathy and friends.

If a Negro were useful in building\r\nrebel fortifications, why not in casting up defences for the Union\r\narmy? Succeeding Gen. Butler in command at Fortress Monroe, on the\r\n14th of October, 1861, Major-Gen. Wool issued an order, directing that\r\n\"all colored persons called contrabands,\" employed by officers or\r\nothers within his command, must be furnished with subsistence by their\r\nemployers, and paid, if males, not less than four dollars per month,\r\nand that \"all able-bodied colored persons, not employed as aforesaid,\"\r\nwill be immediately put to work in the Engineer's or the\r\nQuartermaster's Department. On the 1st of November, Gen. Wool directed\r\nthat the compensation of \"contrabands\" working for the government\r\nshould be five to ten dollars per month, with soldier's rations. These\r\nNegroes rendered valuable service in the sphere they were called upon\r\nto fill.\r\n\r\nIn the Western army, Gen. James B. Steedman was the first man to\r\nsuggest the idea of employing Negroes as teamsters. He saw that every\r\nNegro who drove a team of mules gave to the army one more white\r\nsoldier with a musket in his hands; and so with the sympathy and\r\napproval of the gallant Gen. Geo. H. Thomas, Gen. Steedman put eighty\r\nNegroes into uniforms, and turned them over to an experienced white\r\n\"wagon-master.\" The Negroes made excellent teamsters, and the plan was\r\nadopted quite generally.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1862, an order from Washington directed the employment\r\nof fifty thousand Negro laborers in the Quartermaster's Department,\r\nunder Generals Hunter and Saxton! This showed that the authorities at\r\nWashington had begun to get their eyes open on this question. \"And\r\nwhile speaking of the negroes,\" wrote a \"Times\" correspondent, in\r\n1862, from Hilton Head, \"let me present a few statistics obtained from\r\nan official source, respecting the success which has crowned the\r\nexperiment of employing them as free paid laborers upon the\r\nplantations. The population of the Division (including Port Royal, St.\r\nHelena and Ladies' islands, with the smaller ones thereto adjacent,\r\nbut excluding Hilton Head and its surroundings) is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Effective       3,817\r\n  \"Non-effective   3,110\r\n                   -----\r\n  \"Total           6,927\r\n\r\n\"The number of acres under cultivation on the same islands, is:\r\n\r\n  \"Of Corn         6,444\r\n  \"Of Cotton       3,384\r\n  \"Of Potatoes     1,407\r\n\r\n\"A little calculation will show that the negroes have raised enough\r\ncorn and potatoes to support themselves, besides a crop of cotton (now\r\nripe) somewhat smaller than in former years, but still of very\r\nconsiderable value to the Government.\"[88]\r\n\r\nGen. Mercer issued the following order at Savannah, Georgia, which\r\nshows that the rebels did not despise the fatigue services of Negroes:\r\n\r\n                                   \"C. S.

He believes that, while the planters\r\n     of South Carolina are sending their slaves by thousands to aid\r\n     the defence of Charleston, the slave-holders of Georgia will not\r\n     be backward in contributing in the same patriotic manner to the\r\n     defence of their own seaport, which has so far resisted\r\n     successfully all the attacks of the enemy at Fort McAllister and\r\n     other points.\r\n\r\n     \"Remember, citizens of Georgia, that on the successful defence of\r\n     Georgia depends the security of the interior of your State, where\r\n     so much of value both to yourselves and to the Confederacy at\r\n     large is concentrated.

If Savannah\r\n     falls the fault will be yours, and your own neglect will have\r\n     brought the sword to your hearth-stones.\r\n\r\n     \"The Brigadier-General Commanding, therefore, calls on all the\r\n     slave-holders of Eastern, Southern, and Southwestern Georgia, but\r\n     especially those in the neighborhood of Savannah, to send him\r\n     immediately one fifth of their able-bodied male slaves, for whom\r\n     transportation will be furnished and wages paid at the rate of\r\n     twenty-five dollars per month, the Government to be responsible\r\n     for the value of such Negroes as may be killed by the enemy, or\r\n     may in any manner fall into his hands.

The works in and about Nashville were\r\ncast up by the strong arm and willing hand of the loyal Blacks. Dutch\r\nGap was dug by Negroes, and miles of earthworks, fortifications, and\r\ncorduroy-roads were made by Negroes. They did fatigue duty in every\r\ndepartment of the Union army. Wherever a Negro appeared with a shovel\r\nin his hand, a white soldier took his gun and returned to the ranks.\r\nThere were 200,000 Negroes in the camps and employ of the Union\r\narmies, as servants, teamsters, cooks, and laborers. What a mighty\r\nhost! Suppose the sentiment that early met the Negro on the picket\r\nlines and turned him back to the enemy had continued, 50,000 white\r\nsoldiers would have been required in the Engineer's and\r\nQuartermaster's Department; while 25,000 white men would have been\r\nrequired for various other purposes, outside of the ranks of the army.\r\n\r\nA narrow prejudice among some of the white troops, upon whose pedigree\r\nit would not be pleasant to dwell, met the Negro teamster, with a blue\r\ncoat and buttons with eagles on them, with a growl. They disliked to\r\nsee the Negro wearing a Union uniform;--it looked too much like\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nBut in his lowly station as a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, the\r\nNegro proved himself industrious, trustworthy, efficient, and\r\ncheerful. He earned promotion, and in due time secured it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] Times, Sept. 4, 1862.\r\n\r\n[89] Rebellion Recs., vol. vii.

But all the general officers did not share in the views of\r\nGeneral Butler. As many as twenty Union generals still had it in their\r\nminds that it was the duty of the army \"to catch run-away slaves\"; and\r\nthey afforded rebels every facility to search their camps. They\r\narrested fugitive Negroes and held them subject to the order of their\r\nmasters. Congress was not long in seeing the suicidal tendency of such\r\na policy, and on the 6th of August, 1861, passed \"An Act to Confiscate\r\nProperty Used for Insurrectionary Purposes.\" Notwithstanding this act,\r\nGeneral McClellan and other officers still clung to the obsolete\r\ndoctrine of \"the sacredness of slave property.\" His conduct finally\r\ncalled forth the following letter from the Secretary of State:\r\n\r\n                   \"CONTRABANDS IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n                                 \"DEPARTMENT OF STATE,               }\r\n                                 \"WASHINGTON CITY, December 4, 1861. }\r\n\r\n     \"_To Major-General George B. McClellan, Washington_:\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL: I am directed by the President to call your attention\r\n     to the following subject:\r\n\r\n     \"Persons claimed to be held to service or labor under the laws of\r\n     the State of Virginia, and actually employed in hostile service\r\n     against the Government of the United States, frequently escape\r\n     from the lines of the enemy's forces and are received within the\r\n     lines of the Army of the Potomac. This Department understands\r\n     that such persons, afterward coming into the city of Washington,\r\n     are liable to be arrested by the city police, upon presumption,\r\n     arising from color, that they are fugitives from service or\r\n     labor.\r\n\r\n     \"By the fourth section of the act of Congress, approved August 6,\r\n     1861, entitled 'An Act to Confiscate Property Used for\r\n     Insurrectionary Purposes,' such hostile employment is made a full\r\n     and sufficient answer to any further claim to service or labor.\r\n     Persons thus employed and escaping are received into the military\r\n     protection of the United States, and their arrest as fugitives\r\n     from service or labor should be immediately followed by the\r\n     military arrest of the parties making the seizure.\r\n\r\n     \"Copies of this communication will be sent to the Mayor of the\r\n     City of Washington and to the Marshal of the District of\r\n     Columbia, that any collision between the civil and military\r\n     authorities may be avoided.\r\n\r\n                                   \"I am, General, your very obedient,\r\n                                             \"WM. H. SEWARD.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now 1862. The dark war clouds were growing thicker. The Union\r\narmy had won but few victories; our troops had to fight a tropical\r\nclimate, the forces of nature, and an arrogant, jubilant, and\r\nvictorious enemy. Autumn had come but nothing had been accomplished.\r\nThe friends of the Union who favored a speedy and vigorous prosecution\r\nof the war, besieged the President with letters, memorials, and\r\naddresses to \"_do something_.\" But intrenched behind his\r\n\"constitutional views\" of how the war should be managed he heard all,\r\nbut would pot yield. On the 13th of September, 1862, a deputation of\r\ngentlemen, representing the various Protestant denominations of\r\nChicago, called upon the President and urged him to adopt a vigorous\r\npolicy of emancipation as the only way to save the Union; but he\r\ndenied the request. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For\r\n     instance: the other day, four gentlemen of standing and\r\n     intelligence from New York called as a delegation on business\r\n     connected with the war; but before leaving two of them earnestly\r\n     besought me to proclaim general Emancipation; upon which the\r\n     other two at once attacked them. You know also that the last\r\n     session of Congress had a decided majority of anti-slavery men,\r\n     yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is true of\r\n     the religious people. Why, the Rebel soldiers are praying with a\r\n     great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and\r\n     expecting God to favor their side: for one of our soldiers, who\r\n     had been taken prisoner, told Senator Wilson a few days since\r\n     that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of\r\n     those he was among in their prayers. But we will talk over the\r\n     merits of the case.\r\n\r\n     \"What good would a proclamation of Emancipation from me do,\r\n     especially as we are now situated? I do not want to issue a\r\n     document that the whole world will see must necessarily be\r\n     inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet. Would my\r\n     word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution\r\n     in the Rebel States? Is there a single court, or magistrate, or\r\n     individual, that would be influenced by it there? And what reason\r\n     is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the\r\n     slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which\r\n     offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who\r\n     come within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has\r\n     caused a single slave to come over to us. And, suppose they could\r\n     be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw\r\n     themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can we feed\r\n     and care for such a multitude? Gen. Butler wrote me a few days\r\n     since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have\r\n     rushed to him than to all the White troops under his command.\r\n     They eat, and that is all; though it is true Gen. Butler is\r\n     feeding the Whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to\r\n     a famine there. If, now, the pressure of the war should call off\r\n     our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is\r\n     to prevent the masters from reducing the Blacks to Slavery again;\r\n     for I am told that whenever the rebels take any Black prisoners,\r\n     free or slave, they immediately auction them off! They did so\r\n     with those they took from a boat that was aground in the\r\n     Tennessee river a few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously\r\n     attacked for it! For instance, when, after the late battles at\r\n     and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington, under\r\n     a flag of truce, to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and\r\n     the Rebels seized the Blacks who went along to help, and sent\r\n     them into Slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\r\n     Government would probably do nothing about it. What _could_ I do?\r\n\r\n     \"Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good\r\n     would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire?\r\n     Understand: I raise no objection against it on legal or\r\n     constitutional grounds; for, as Commander-in-Chief of the army\r\n     and navy in time of war, I suppose I have a right to take any\r\n     measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I urge objections\r\n     of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\r\n     insurrection and massacre at the South. I view this matter as a\r\n     practical war measure, to be decided on according to the\r\n     advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of\r\n     the Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nNot discouraged, the deputation urged in answer to his conservative\r\nviews, that a policy of emancipation would strengthen the cause of the\r\nUnion in Europe, and place the government upon high humane grounds,\r\nwhere it could boldly and confidently appeal to Almighty God in an\r\nhonest attempt to save His poor children from the degrading curse of\r\nAmerican slavery. But the President replied:\r\n\r\n     \"I admit that Slavery is at the root of the Rebellion, or at\r\n     least its _sine qua non_. The ambition of politicians may have\r\n     instigated them to act; they would have been impotent without\r\n     Slavery as their instrument. I will also concede that\r\n     Emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we\r\n     are incited by something more than ambition. I grant, further,\r\n     that it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I\r\n     fear, as you and those you represent imagine. Still, some\r\n     additional strength would be added in that way to the war; and\r\n     then, unquestionably, it would weaken the Rebels by drawing off\r\n     their laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so\r\n     sure we could do much with the Blacks. If we were to arm them, I\r\n     fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the\r\n     Rebels; and, indeed, thus far, we have not had arms enough to\r\n     equip our White troops. I will mention another thing, though it\r\n     meet only your scorn and contempt. There are fifty thousand\r\n     bayonets in the Union army from the Border Slave States. It would\r\n     be a serious matter if, in consequence of a proclamation such as\r\n     you desire, they should go over to the Rebels. I do not think\r\n     they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as six\r\n     months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases\r\n     their Union feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted,\r\n     and want to beat the Rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think\r\n     you should admit that we already have an important principle to\r\n     rally and unite the people, in the fact that constitutional\r\n     government is at stake. This is a fundamental idea, going down\r\n     about as deep as anything.\"[90]\r\n\r\nBut there were millions of prayers ascending to the God of Battles\r\ndaily that the President might have the courage and disposition to\r\npursue a course required by the lamentable condition of the Union. And\r\njust nine days from the time he thought a proclamation not warranted\r\nand impracticable, he issued the following:\r\n\r\n     \"I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States of America,\r\n     and Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby\r\n     proclaim and declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will\r\n     be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the\r\n     constitutional relation between the United States and each of the\r\n     States, and the people thereof, in which States that relation is\r\n     or may be suspended or disturbed.\r\n\r\n     \"That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to\r\n     again recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering\r\n     pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all Slave\r\n     States, so called, the people whereof may not then be in\r\n     rebellion against the United States, and which States may then\r\n     have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt,\r\n     immediate or gradual abolishment of Slavery within their\r\n     respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of\r\n     African descent, with their consent, upon this continent or\r\n     elsewhere, with the previously obtained consent of the\r\n     governments existing there, will be continued.\r\n\r\n     \"That, on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one\r\n     thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as\r\n     slaves within any State, or designated part of the State, the\r\n     people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United\r\n     States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the\r\n     Executive Government of the United States, including the military\r\n     and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the\r\n     freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress\r\n     such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for\r\n     their actual freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid,\r\n     by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if\r\n     any, in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in\r\n     rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State,\r\n     or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith\r\n     represented in the Congress of the United States, by members\r\n     chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified\r\n     voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the\r\n     absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive\r\n     evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in\r\n     rebellion against the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled\r\n     'An Act to make an additional Article of War,' approved March\r\n     13th, 1862; and which act is in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n     \"'_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of\r\n     the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional\r\n     article of war for the government of the Army of the United\r\n     States, and shall be obeyed and observed as such:\r\n\r\n     \"'SECTION 1.

SEWARD, _Secretary of State_.\"\r\n\r\nBut why this change in the views of the President? History, thus far,\r\nis left to conjecture. It was hinted that our embassadors in Western\r\nEurope had apprised the State Department at Washington that an early\r\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy was possible, even probable.\r\nIt was also stated that he was waiting for the issue at the battle of\r\nAntietam, which was fought on the 17th--five days before the\r\nproclamation was issued. But neither explanation stands in the light\r\nof the positive and explicit language of the President on the 13th of\r\nSeptember. However, he issued the proclamation,--the Divine Being may\r\nhave opened his eyes to see the angel that was to turn him aside from\r\nthe destruction that awaited the Union that he sought to save with\r\nslavery preserved!\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the people upon the wisdom of the proclamation was\r\nexpressed in the October elections. New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois went democratic; while the\r\nsupporters of the Administration fell off in Michigan and other\r\nWestern States. In the Congress of 1860 there were 78 Republicans and\r\n37 Democrats; in 1862 there were 57 Administration representatives,\r\nand 67 in the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe army did not take kindly to the proclamation. It was charged that\r\n\"the war for the Union was changed into a war for the Negro.\" Some\r\nofficers resigned, while many others said that if they _thought_ they\r\nwere fighting to free the \"niggers\" they would resign. This sentiment\r\nwas contagious. It found its way into the rank and file of the troops,\r\nand did no little harm. The following telegram shows that the rebels\r\nwere angered not a little at the President:\r\n\r\n                                   \"CHARLESTON, S. C., Oct. 13, 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"HON. WM. P.

BEAUREGARD.\"\r\n\r\nBut the proclamation was a harmless measure. _First_, it declared that\r\nthe object of the war was to restore \"the constitutional relation\r\nbetween the United States and each of the States.\" After nearly two\r\nyears of disastrous war Mr. Lincoln declares the object of the war.\r\nCertainly no loyal man had ever entertained any other idea than the\r\none expressed in the proclamation. It was not a war on the part of the\r\nUnited States to destroy her children, nor to disturb her own\r\nconstitutional, comprehensive unity. It must have been understood,\r\nthen, from the commencement, that the war begun by the seceding States\r\nwas waged on the part of the United States to preserve the _Union of\r\nthe States_, and restore them to their \"constitutional relation.\"\r\n\r\n_Second_, the proclamation implored the slave States to accept\r\n(certainly in the spirit of compromise) a proposition from the United\r\nStates to emancipate their slaves for a _pecuniary consideration_,\r\nand, by their gracious consent, assist in _colonizing_ loyal Negroes\r\nin this country or in Africa!\r\n\r\n_Third_, the measure proposed to free slaves of persons and States in\r\nrebellion against the lawful authority of the United States Government\r\non the first day of January, 1863. Nothing more difficult could have\r\nbeen undertaken than to free _only_ the slaves of persons and States\r\nin _actual_ rebellion against the Government of the United States.\r\nPersons in _actual_ rebellion would be _most_ likely to have immediate\r\noversight of this species of their property; and the owners of slaves\r\nin the States in _actual_ rebellion against the United States\r\nGovernment would doubtless be as thoroughly prepared to take care of\r\nslave property as the muskets in their rebellious hands.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, this emancipation proclamation (?) proposed to pay out of\r\nthe United States Treasury,--for all slaves of loyal masters lost in a\r\nrebellion begun by slave-holders and carried on by slave-holders!\r\n\r\nUnder the condition of affairs no emancipation proclamation was\r\nnecessary. Treason against the United States is \"levying war against\r\nthem,\" or \"adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\"\r\nThe rebel States were guilty of treason; and from the moment Sumter\r\nwas fired upon, every slave in the Confederate States was _ipso facto_\r\nfree!\r\n\r\nBut it was an occasion for rejoicing. The President had taken a step\r\nin the right direction, and, thank God! he never retraced it.\r\n\r\nA severe winter had set in. The rebels had shown the kind-hearted\r\nPresident no disposition to accept the mild terms of his proclamation.\r\nOn the contrary, it was received with gnashing of teeth and bitter\r\nimprecations. On the 12th of January, 1863, the titular President of\r\nthe Confederate States, in his third Annual Message, gave attention to\r\nthe proclamation of the President of the United States. Mr. Davis\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"It has established a state of things which can lead to but one\r\n     of three possible consequences--the extermination of the slaves,\r\n     the exile of the whole white population of the Confederacy, or\r\n     absolute and total separation of these States from the United\r\n     States. This proclamation is also an authentic statement by the\r\n     Government of the United States of its inability to subjugate the\r\n     South by force of arms, and, as such, must be accepted by neutral\r\n     nations, which can no longer find any justification in\r\n     withholding our just claims to formal recognition. It is also, in\r\n     effect, an intimation to the people of the North that they must\r\n     prepare to submit to a separation now become inevitable; for that\r\n     people are too acute not to understand that a restitution of the\r\n     Union has been rendered forever impossible by the adoption of a\r\n     measure which, from its very nature, neither admits of retraction\r\n     nor can coexist with union.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"We may well leave it to the instincts of that common humanity\r\n     which a beneficent Creator has implanted in the breasts of our\r\n     fellow-men of all countries to pass judgment on a measure by\r\n     which several millions of human beings of an inferior\r\n     race--peaceful and contented laborers in their sphere--are doomed\r\n     to extermination, while at the same time they are encouraged to a\r\n     general assassination of their masters by the insidious\r\n     recommendation to abstain from violence unless in necessary\r\n     self-defense. Our own detestation of those who have attempted the\r\n     most execrable measures recorded in the history of guilty man is\r\n     tempered by profound contempt for the impotent rage which it\r\n     discloses. So far as regards the action of this Government on\r\n     such criminals as may attempt its execution, I confine myself to\r\n     informing you that I shall--unless in your wisdom you deem some\r\n     other course more expedient--deliver to the several State\r\n     authorities all commissioned officers of the United States that\r\n     may hereafter be captured by our forces in any of the States\r\n     embraced in the proclamation, that they may be dealt with in\r\n     accordance with the laws of those States providing for the\r\n     punishment of criminals engaged in exciting servile insurrection.\r\n     The enlisted soldiers I shall continue to treat as unwilling\r\n     instruments in the commission of these crimes, and shall direct\r\n     their discharge and return to their homes on the proper and usual\r\n     parole.\"\r\n\r\nAnd although the President and his supporters had not reaped the\r\nblessings their hopes had sown, they were, nevertheless, not without\r\nhope. For when the sober second thought of the nation took the place\r\nof prejudice and undue excitement, the proclamation had more friends.\r\nAnd so, in keeping with his promise, the President issued the\r\nfollowing proclamation on the first of January, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"_Whereas_, on the 22d day of September, in the year of our Lord\r\n     1862, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United\r\n     States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"'That on the 1st day of January, in the year of our Lord 1863,\r\n     all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of\r\n     a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against\r\n     the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever\r\n     free; and the Executive Government of the United States,\r\n     including the military and naval authority thereof, will\r\n     recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do\r\n     no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any\r\n     efforts they may make for their actual freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"'That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid,\r\n     by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if\r\n     any, in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in\r\n     rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State,\r\n     or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith\r\n     represented in the Congress of the United States, by members,\r\n     chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified\r\n     voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the\r\n     absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive\r\n     evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in\r\n     rebellion against the United States.'\r\n\r\n     \"Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United\r\n     States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief\r\n     of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual\r\n     armed rebellion against the authority and Government of the\r\n     United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for\r\n     suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in\r\n     the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,\r\n     and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed\r\n     for the full period of one hundred days from the day first above\r\n     mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States\r\n     wherein the people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion\r\n     against the United States, the following, to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St. Bernard,\r\n     Plaquemine, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James,\r\n     Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St.\r\n     Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans),\r\n     Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North\r\n     Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties\r\n     designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley,\r\n     Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Anne, and\r\n     Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and\r\n     which excepted parts are, for the present, left precisely as if\r\n     this proclamation were not issued.\r\n\r\n     \"And, by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do\r\n     order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said\r\n     designated States and parts of States, are and henceforward shall\r\n     be free; and that the Executive Government of the United States,\r\n     including the military and naval authorities thereof, will\r\n     recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.\r\n\r\n     \"And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free, to\r\n     abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defense; and\r\n     I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor\r\n     faithfully for reasonable wages.\r\n\r\n     \"And I further declare and make known that such persons, of\r\n     suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of\r\n     the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and\r\n     other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.\r\n\r\n     \"And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,\r\n     warranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke\r\n     the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of\r\n     Almighty God.\r\n\r\n     \"In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my name and caused the\r\n     seal of the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n     \"Done at the City of Washington, this 1st day of January, in the\r\n     year of our Lord 1863, and of the independence of the United\r\n     States the 87th.\r\n\r\n     [L. S.]\r\n\r\n          \"By the President:                  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n     \"WILLIAM H. SEWARD, _Secretary of State_.\"\r\n\r\nEven this proclamation--not a measure of humanity--to save the Union,\r\nnot the slave--left slaves in many counties and States at the South.\r\nIt was a war measure, pure and simple. It was a blow aimed at the most\r\nvulnerable part of the Confederacy. It was destroying its\r\ncorner-stone, and the ponderous fabric was doomed to a speedy and\r\ncomplete destruction. It discovered that the strength of this Sampson\r\nof rebellion lay in its vast slave population. To the slave the\r\nproclamation came as the song of the rejoicing angels to the shepherds\r\nupon the plains of Bethlehem. It was like music at night, mellowed by\r\nthe distance, that rouses slumbering hopes, gives wings to fancy, and\r\npeoples the brain with blissful thoughts. The notes of freedom came\r\ncareering to them across the red, billowy waves of battle and thrilled\r\ntheir souls with ecstatic peace. Old men who, like Samuel the prophet,\r\nbelieving the ark of God in the hands of the Philistines, and were\r\nready to give up the ghost, felt that it was just the time to begin to\r\nlive. Husbands were transported with the thought of gathering to their\r\nbosoms the wife that had been sold to the \"nigger traders\"; mothers\r\nswooned under the tender touch of the thought of holding in loving\r\nembrace the children who pined for their care; and young men and\r\nmaidens could only \"think thanksgiving and weep gladness.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave-holder saw in this proclamation the handwriting upon the\r\nwalls of the institution of slavery. The brightness and revelry of his\r\nbanqueting halls were to be succeeded by gloom and sorrow. His riches,\r\nconsisting in human beings, were to disappear under the magic touch of\r\nthe instrument of freedom. The chattel was to be transformed into a\r\nperson, the person into a soldier, the soldier into a citizen--and\r\nthus the Negro slave, like the crawling caterpillar, was to leave his\r\ngrovelling situation, and in new form, wing himself to the sublime\r\nheights of free American citizenship!\r\n\r\nThe Negroes had a marvellous facility of communicating news to each\r\nother. The proclamation, in spite of the precautions of the rebel\r\nauthorities, took to itself wings. It came to the plantation of weary\r\nslaves as the glorious light of a new-born day. It flooded the hovels\r\nof slaves with its golden light and rich promise of \"_forever free_.\"\r\nLike St. Paul the poor slaves could exclaim:\r\n\r\n     \"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in\r\n     watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by\r\n     long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love\r\n     unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the\r\n     armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by\r\n     honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers,\r\n     and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and,\r\n     behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet\r\n     alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having\r\n     nothing, and yet possessing all things.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the significant name of Abraham--\"father of the faithful\"--was\r\npronounced by the Negroes with blessings, and mingled in their songs\r\nof praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] Greeley, vol. ii. pp. 251, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES AS SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n     THE QUESTION OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES.--THE REBELS TAKE THE\r\n     FIRST STEP TOWARD THE MILITARY EMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES.--GRAND\r\n     REVIEW OF THE REBEL TROOPS AT NEW ORLEANS.--GENERAL HUNTER ARMS\r\n     THE FIRST REGIMENT OF LOYAL NEGROES AT THE SOUTH.--OFFICIAL\r\n     CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF WAR AND GENERAL HUNTER\r\n     RESPECTING THE ENLISTMENT OF THE BLACK REGIMENT.--THE ENLISTMENT\r\n     OF FIVE NEGRO REGIMENTS AUTHORIZED BY THE PRESIDENT.--THE POLICY\r\n     OF GENERAL PHELPS IN REGARD TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES AS\r\n     SOLDIERS IN LOUISIANA.--A SECOND CALL FOR TROOPS BY THE\r\n     PRESIDENT.--AN ATTEMPT TO AMEND THE ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL SO AS\r\n     TO PROHIBIT THE FURTHER EMPLOYMENT OF COLORED TROOPS.--GOVERNOR\r\n     JOHN A.

It has been shown that the admission of loyal Negroes into\r\nthe Union lines, and into the service of the Engineer's and\r\nQuartermaster's Department, had been resisted with great stubbornness\r\nby the men in the \"chief places.\" There were, however, a few men, both\r\nin and out of the army, who secretly believed that the Negro was\r\nneeded in the army, and that he possessed all the elements necessary\r\nto make an excellent soldier. Public sentiment was so strong against\r\nthe employment of Negroes in the armed service that few men had the\r\ncourage of conviction; few had the temerity to express their views\r\npublicly. In the summer of 1860,--before the election of Abraham\r\nLincoln,--General J. Watts De Peyster, of New York, wrote an article\r\nfor a Hudson paper, in which he advocated the arming of Negroes as\r\nsoldiers, should the Southern States declare war against the\r\nGovernment of the United States. The article was reproduced in many\r\nother papers, pronounced a fire-brand, and General De Peyster severely\r\ndenounced for his advice. But he stood his ground, and when the war\r\ndid come he gave to his country's service three gallant sons; and from\r\nthe first to the last was an efficient and enthusiastic supporter of\r\nthe war for the Union.\r\n\r\nThe rebels took the first step in the direction of the military\r\nemployment of Negroes as soldiers. Two weeks after the firing upon\r\nSumter took place, the following note appeared in the \"Charleston\r\nMercury\":\r\n\r\n     Several companies of the Third and Fourth Regiments of Georgia\r\n     passed through Augusta for the expected scene of\r\n     warfare--Virginia. Sixteen well-drilled companies of volunteers\r\n     and one negro company, from Nashville, Tennessee, offered their\r\n     services to the Confederate States.\"[91]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Memphis Avalanche\" and \"Memphis Appeal\" of the 9th, 10th, and\r\n11th of May, 1861, appeared the following notice:\r\n\r\n     \"ATTENTION, VOLUNTEERS: Resolved by the Committee of Safety, that\r\n     C. Deloach, D. R. Cook, and William B. Greenlaw be authorized to\r\n     organize a volunteer company composed of our patriotic free men\r\n     of color, of the city of Memphis, for the service of our common\r\n     defence. All who have not enrolled their names will call at the\r\n     office of W. B. Greenlaw & Co.\r\n\r\n                                             \"F. TITUS, _President_.\r\n\r\n     \"F. W. FORSYTHE, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of February, 1862, the rebel troops had a grand review, and\r\nthe \"Picayune,\" of New Orleans, contained the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"We must also pay a deserved compliment to the companies of free\r\n     colored men, all very well drilled, and comfortably uniformed.\r\n     Most of these companies, quite unaided by the administration,\r\n     have supplied themselves with arms without regard to cost or\r\n     trouble. One of these companies, commanded by the well-known\r\n     veteran, Captain Jordan, was presented, a little before the\r\n     parade, with a fine war-flag of the new style. This interesting\r\n     ceremony took place at Mr. Cushing's store, on Camp, near Common\r\n     Street. The presentation was made by Mr. Bigney, and Jordan made,\r\n     on this occasion, one of his most felicitous speeches.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the 4th of February, 1862, the \"Baltimore Traveller\" contained\r\nthe following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"ARMING OF NEGROES AT RICHMOND.--Contrabands who have recently\r\n     come within the Federal lines at Williamsport, report that all\r\n     the able-bodied colored men in that vicinity are being taken to\r\n     Richmond, formed into regiments, and armed for the defence of\r\n     that city.\"\r\n\r\nThe following telegram was sent out:\r\n\r\n                                        \"NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 23, 1861.\r\n\r\n     \"Over twenty-eight thousand troops were reviewed to-day by\r\n     Governor Moore, Major-General Lovell, and Brig.-General Ruggles.\r\n     The line was over seven miles long. One regiment comprised\r\n     fourteen hundred free colored men.\"\r\n\r\nThese are sufficient to show that from the earliest dawn of the war\r\nthe rebel authorities did not frown upon the action of local\r\nauthorities in placing arms into the hands of free Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States was still opposing any attempt on\r\nthe part of the supporters of the war to constrain him to approve of\r\nthe introduction of Negroes into the army. But the Secretary of War,\r\nthe Hon. Simon Cameron, had sent an order to Brig.-Gen. T. W. Sherman,\r\ndirecting him to accept the services of all loyal persons who desired\r\nto aid in the suppression of the Rebellion in and about Port Royal.\r\nWhen Gen. David Hunter relieved Gen. Sherman, the latter turned over\r\nto him the instructions of the Secretary of War. There was no mention\r\nof color, nor was any class of persons mentioned save \"loyal persons.\"\r\nGen. Hunter was a gentleman of broad, liberal, and humane views, and\r\nseeing an opportunity open to employ Negroes as soldiers, in the\r\nspring of 1862 directed the organization of a regiment of blacks. He\r\nsecured the best white officers for the regiment, and it soon obtained\r\na fine condition of discipline. The news of a Union Negro regiment in\r\nSouth Carolina completely surprised the people at Washington. On the\r\n9th of June, 1862, Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, introduced in the\r\nNational House of Representatives a resolution of inquiry, calling\r\nupon Gen. Hunter to explain to Congress his unprecedented conduct in\r\narming Negroes to fight the battles of the Union. Mr. Stanton was now\r\nat the head of the War Department, and the following correspondence\r\ntook place:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"GENERAL HUNTER'S NEGRO REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n                  \"OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n                                       \"WAR DEPARTMENT, June 14, 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"_Hon.

Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, their substance being to\r\n     inquire:\r\n\r\n     \"First. Whether I had organized or was organizing a regiment of\r\n     'fugitive slaves' in this department?\r\n\r\n     \"Second. Whether any authority had been given to me from the War\r\n     Department for such organization? and\r\n\r\n     \"Third. Whether I had been furnished, by order of the War\r\n     Department, with clothing, uniforms, arms, equipments, etc., for\r\n     such a force?\r\n\r\n     \"Only having received the letter covering these inquiries at a\r\n     late hour on Saturday night, I urge forward my answer in time for\r\n     the steamer sailing to-day (Monday)--this haste preventing me\r\n     from entering as minutely as I could wish upon many points of\r\n     detail, such as the paramount importance of the subject calls\r\n     for. But, in view of the near termination of the present session\r\n     of Congress, and the widespread interest which must have been\r\n     awakened by Mr. Wickliffe's resolutions, I prefer sending even\r\n     this imperfect answer to waiting the period necessary for the\r\n     collection of fuller and more comprehensive data.\r\n\r\n     \"To the first question, therefore, I reply that no regiment of\r\n     'fugitive slaves' has been or is being organized in this\r\n     department. There is, however, a fine regiment of persons whose\r\n     late masters are 'fugitive rebels,'--men who everywhere fly\r\n     before the appearance of the national flag, leaving their\r\n     servants behind them to shift as best they can for themselves. So\r\n     far, indeed, are the loyal persons composing this regiment from\r\n     seeking to avoid the presence of their late owners, that they are\r\n     now, one and all, working with remarkable industry to place\r\n     themselves in a position to go in full and effective pursuit of\r\n     their fugacious and traitorous proprietors.\r\n\r\n     \"To the second question I have the honor to answer that the\r\n     instructions given to Brig.-Gen. T. W. Sherman, by the Hon. Simon\r\n     Cameron, late Secretary of War, and turned over to me by\r\n     succession for my guidance, do distinctly authorize me to employ\r\n     all loyal persons offering their services in defence of the Union\r\n     and for the suppression of this rebellion in any manner I might\r\n     see fit, or that the circumstances might call for. There is no\r\n     restriction as to the character or color of the persons to be\r\n     employed, or the nature of the employment, whether civil or\r\n     military, in which their services should be used. I conclude,\r\n     therefore, that I have been authorized to enlist 'fugitive\r\n     slaves' as soldiers, could any such be found in this department.\r\n     No such characters, however, have yet appeared within view of our\r\n     most advanced pickets, the loyal slaves everywhere remaining on\r\n     their plantations to welcome us, aid us, and supply us with food,\r\n     labor, and information. It is the masters who have in every\r\n     instance been the 'fugitives,' running away from loyal slaves as\r\n     well as loyal soldiers, and whom we have only partially been able\r\n     to see--chiefly their heads over ramparts, or, rifle in hand,\r\n     dodging behind trees--in the extreme distance. In the absence of\r\n     any 'fugitive-master law,' the deserted slaves would be wholly\r\n     without remedy, had not the crime of treason given them the right\r\n     to pursue, capture, and bring back those persons of whose\r\n     protection they have been thus suddenly bereft.\r\n\r\n     \"To the third interrogatory it is my painful duty to reply that I\r\n     never have received any specific authority for issues of\r\n     clothing, uniforms, arms, equipments, and so forth, to the troops\r\n     in question--my general instructions from Mr. Cameron to employ\r\n     them in any manner I might find necessary, and the military\r\n     exigencies of the department and the country being my only, but,\r\n     in my judgment, sufficient justification. Neither have I had any\r\n     specific authority for supplying these persons with shovels,\r\n     spades, and pickaxes, when employing them as laborers, nor with\r\n     boats and oars when using them as lightermen; but these are not\r\n     points included in Mr. Wickliffe's resolution. To me it seemed\r\n     that liberty to employ men in any particular capacity implied\r\n     with it liberty also to supply them with the necessary tools; and\r\n     acting upon this faith I have clothed, equipped, and armed the\r\n     only loyal regiment yet raised in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     \"I must say, in vindication of my own conduct, that had it not\r\n     been for the many other diversified and imperative claims on my\r\n     time, a much more satisfactory result might have been hoped for;\r\n     and that in place of only one, as at present, at least five or\r\n     six well-drilled, brave, and thoroughly acclimated regiments\r\n     should by this time have been added to the loyal forces of the\r\n     Union.\r\n\r\n     \"The experiment of arming the blacks, so far as I have made it,\r\n     has been a complete and even marvellous success. They are sober,\r\n     docile, attentive, and enthusiastic, displaying great natural\r\n     capacities for acquiring the duties of the soldier. They are\r\n     eager beyond all things to take the field and be led into action;\r\n     and it is the unanimous opinion of the officers who have had\r\n     charge of them, that in the peculiarities of this climate and\r\n     country they will prove invaluable auxiliaries, fully equal to\r\n     the similar regiments so long and successfully used by the\r\n     British authorities in the West-India Islands.\r\n\r\n     \"In conclusion, I would say it is my hope--there appearing no\r\n     possibility of other reënforcements, owing to the exigencies of\r\n     the campaign in the Peninsula--to have organized by the end of\r\n     next fall, and to be able to present to the Government, from\r\n     forty-eight to fifty thousand of these hardy and devoted\r\n     soldiers.\r\n\r\n     \"Trusting that this letter may form part of your answer to Mr.\r\n     Wickliffe's resolutions, I have the honor to be, most\r\n     respectfully, your very obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"D. HUNTER,\r\n                                        \"_Major-General Commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wickliffe seemed to feel that he had received an exhaustive reply\r\nto his resolution of inquiry, but his colleague, Mr. Dunlap, offered\r\nthe following resolution on the 3d of July, 1862, which was never\r\nacted upon:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the sentiments contained in the paper read to\r\n     this body yesterday, approving the arming of slaves, emanating\r\n     from Major-General David Hunter, clothed in discourteous\r\n     language, are an indignity to the American Congress, an insult to\r\n     the American people and our brave soldiers in arms; for which\r\n     sentiments, so uttered, he justly merits our condemnation and\r\n     censure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was quite a flutter among the politicians in the rear, and many\r\narmy officers felt that the United States uniform had been disgraced\r\nby being put upon \"fugitive slaves.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks after the affair in Congress alluded to above, two\r\nUnited States Senators,[92] charmed with the bold idea of General\r\nHunter, called upon the President to urge him to accept the services\r\nof two Negro regiments. The \"New York Herald\" of the 5th of August,\r\n1862, gave an account of the interview under the caption of\r\n\"_Important Decision of the President_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The efforts of those who love the negro more than the Union to\r\n     induce the President to swerve from his established policy are\r\n     unavailing. He will neither be persuaded by promises nor\r\n     intimidated by threats. To-day he was called upon by two United\r\n     States Senators and rather peremptorily requested to accept the\r\n     services of two negro regiments. They were flatly and\r\n     unequivocally rejected. The President did not appreciate the\r\n     necessity of employing the negroes to fight the battles of the\r\n     country and take the positions which the white men of the nation,\r\n     the voters, and sons of patriotic sires, should be proud to\r\n     occupy; there were employments in which the negroes of rebel\r\n     masters might well be engaged, but he was not willing to place\r\n     them upon an equality with our volunteers, who had left home and\r\n     family and lucrative occupations to defend the Union and the\r\n     Constitution, while there were volunteers or militia enough in\r\n     the loyal States to maintain the Government without resort to\r\n     this expedient. If the loyal people were not satisfied with the\r\n     policy he had adopted, he was willing to leave the administration\r\n     to other hands. One of the Senators was impudent enough to tell\r\n     the President he wished to God he would resign.\"[93]\r\n\r\nBut there the regiment was,--one thousand loyal and competent\r\nsoldiers; and there was no way out but for the government to father\r\nthe regiment, and, therefore, on the 25th of August, 1862, the\r\nSecretary of War sent General Rufus Saxton the following order:\r\n\r\n     \"3. In view of the small force under your command, and the\r\n     inability of the Government at the present time to increase it,\r\n     in order to guard the plantations and settlements occupied by the\r\n     United States from invasion, and protect the inhabitants thereof\r\n     from captivity and murder by the enemy, you are also authorized\r\n     to arm, uniform, equip, and receive into the service of the\r\n     United States, such number of Volunteers of African descent as\r\n     you may deem expedient, not exceeding five thousand; and may\r\n     detail officers to instruct them in military drill, discipline,\r\n     and duty, and to command them; the persons so received into\r\n     service, and their officers, to be entitled to and receive the\r\n     same pay and rations as are allowed by law to Volunteers in the\r\n     service.\r\n\r\n     \"4. You will occupy, if possible, all the islands and plantations\r\n     heretofore occupied by the Government, and secure and harvest the\r\n     crops, and cultivate and improve the plantations.\r\n\r\n     \"5. The population of African descent, that cultivate the land\r\n     and perform the labor of the Rebels, constitute a large share of\r\n     their military strength, and enable the White masters to fill the\r\n     Rebel armies, and wage a cruel and murderous war against the\r\n     people of the Northern States. By reducing the laboring strength\r\n     of the Rebels, their military power will be reduced. You are,\r\n     therefore, authorized, by every means in your power, to withdraw\r\n     from the enemy their laboring force and population, and to spare\r\n     no effort, consistent with civilized warfare, to weaken, harass,\r\n     and annoy them, and to establish the authority of the Government\r\n     of the United States within your Department.\"\r\n\r\nBut public sentiment was growing with every passing day. The very\r\npresence of the Negro regiment at Port Royal converted the most\r\npronounced enemies of Negro troops into friends and admirers. The\r\nnewspaper correspondents filled their letters to the papers North with\r\nmost extravagant praise of the Negro soldier; and the President was\r\ndriven from his position of \"_no negro soldiers_.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the \"Times,\" in a letter dated September 4, 1862,\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     \"There is little doubt that the next mail from the North will\r\n     bring an order from the War Department recalling Major-Gen.\r\n     Hunter to a field of greater activity. The Government had not\r\n     lent him a hearty support in carrying out his policy of arming\r\n     the blacks, by which alone he could make himself useful in this\r\n     department to the National cause; and, therefore, more than two\r\n     months since he applied to be relieved, rather than sit supinely\r\n     with folded hands when his military abilities might be found of\r\n     service elsewhere. Now, however, I have reason to believe that\r\n     Gen. Hunter's views upon the question of forming negro regiments,\r\n     have been unreservedly adopted by the President, and the whole\r\n     question has assumed such a different phase that Gen. Hunter\r\n     almost regrets that he is to leave the department. The last mail\r\n     brought the authorization of the President to _enlist_ five negro\r\n     regiments, each of a thousand negroes, to be armed and uniformed\r\n     for the service of the United States, and also authorizes the\r\n     enrollment of an additional 50,000 to be employed in the\r\n     Quartermaster's Department nominally as laborers, but as they are\r\n     to be organized into companies and uniformed, and a portion of\r\n     their time is to be spent in drilling, it is easy to understand\r\n     that the possibility of their being used as soldiers is not lost\r\n     sight of. The exact time of commencing the work of enlisting the\r\n     colored recruits, I am not able to state, but that it will be\r\n     shortly, to my mind, there is not a shadow of doubt. The only way\r\n     in which the men can be obtained is by the establishment of posts\r\n     at various places upon the coast, where the negroes, assured of\r\n     protection, will flock to us by thousands. Past experience and\r\n     present information both go to prove this fact, and to establish\r\n     these posts more men will be required; therefore we may soon\r\n     expect that the Government will be deriving positive advantages\r\n     from this department which, heretofore, has been only negative of\r\n     service, as the field of experiments and the testing of ideas.\r\n     Gen. Saxton will go to Washington by the first steamer, for\r\n     consultation with the President on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nJust what one thing changed the President so suddenly upon the\r\nquestion of the employment of Negroes as soldiers was not known.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana the Negroes were anxious to enlist in the service of the\r\nUnion, and with this object in view thousands of them sought the\r\nFederal camps. Brig.-Gen. J. W. Phelps, commanding the forces at\r\nCarrolton, La., found his camps daily crowded with fugitives from\r\nslavery. What to do with them became a question of great moment. Gen.\r\nPhelps became convinced that it was impossible to subdue a great\r\nrebellion if slavery were to have the protection of Federal bayonets.\r\nHe gave the Negroes who came to his camp protection; and for this was\r\nreported to his superior officer, Gen. Butler. In a report to the\r\nlatter officer's Adjutant-General, on June 16, 1862, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The enfranchisement of the people of Europe has been, and is\r\n     still, going on, through the instrumentality of military service;\r\n     and by this means our slaves might be raised in the scale of\r\n     civilization and prepared for freedom. Fifty regiments might be\r\n     raised among them at once, which could be employed in this\r\n     climate to preserve order, and thus prevent the necessity of\r\n     retrenching our liberties, as we should do by a large army\r\n     exclusively of Whites. For it is evident that a considerable army\r\n     of Whites would give stringency to our Government; while an army\r\n     partly of Blacks would naturally operate in favor of freedom and\r\n     against those influences which at present most endanger our\r\n     liberties. At the end of five years, they could be sent to\r\n     Africa, and their places filled with new enlistments.\"\r\n\r\nReceiving no specific response to this overture, Gen. Phelps made a\r\nrequisition of arms, clothing, etc., for \"three regiments of Africans,\r\nwhich I propose to raise for the defense of this point\"; adding:\r\n\r\n     \"The location is swampy and unhealthy; and our men are dying at\r\n     the rate of two or three a day.\r\n\r\n     \"The Southern loyalists are willing, as I understand, to furnish\r\n     their share of the tax for the support of the war; but they\r\n     should also furnish their quota of men; which they have not thus\r\n     far done. An opportunity now offers of supplying the deficiency;\r\n     and it is not safe to neglect opportunities in war. I think that,\r\n     with the proper facilities, I could raise the three regiments\r\n     proposed in a short time. Without holding out any inducements, or\r\n     offering any reward, I have now upward of 300 Africans organized\r\n     into five companies, who are all willing and ready to show their\r\n     devotion to our cause in any way that it may be put to the test.\r\n     They are willing to submit to any thing rather than to slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"Society, in the South, seems to be on the point of dissolution;\r\n     and the best way of preventing the African from becoming\r\n     instrumental in a general state of anarchy, is to enlist him in\r\n     the cause of the Republic. If we reject his services, any petty\r\n     military chieftain, by offering him freedom, can have them for\r\n     the purpose of robbery and plunder. It is for the interests of\r\n     the South, as well as of the North, that the African should be\r\n     permitted to offer his block for the temple of freedom.\r\n     Sentiments unworthy of the man of the present day--worthy only of\r\n     another Cain--could alone prevent such an offer from being\r\n     accepted.\r\n\r\n     \"I would recommend that the cadet graduates of the present year\r\n     should be sent to South Carolina and this point, to organize and\r\n     discipline our African levies; and that the more promising\r\n     non-commissioned officers and privates of the army be appointed\r\n     as company officers to command them. Prompt and energetic efforts\r\n     in this direction would probably accomplish more toward a speedy\r\n     termination of the war, and an early restoration of peace and\r\n     unity, than any other course which could be adopted.\"[94]\r\n\r\nGen. Butler advised Gen. Phelps to employ \"contrabands\" for mere\r\nfatigue duty, and charged him not to use them as soldiers. On the 31st\r\nof July, 1862, Gen. Phelps rejoined by informing Gen. Butler: \"I am\r\nnot willing to become the mere slave-driver you propose, having no\r\nqualifications that way,\" and immediately tendered his resignation.\r\n\r\nNothing could stay the mighty stream of fugitives that poured into the\r\nUnion lines by day and by night. Nothing could cool the ardor of the\r\nloyal Negroes who so earnestly desired to share the perils and honors\r\nof the Federal army. There was but one course left and that was to\r\ncall the Negroes to arms as Gen. Jackson had done nearly a half\r\ncentury before. Gen. Butler repented his action toward the gallant and\r\nintelligent Phelps, and on the 24th of August, 1862, appealed to the\r\nfree Colored men of New Orleans to take up arms in defence of the\r\nUnion. As in the War of 1812, they responded to the call with\r\nenthusiasm; and in just two weeks one thousand Negroes were organized\r\ninto a regiment. All the men and line officers were Colored; the\r\nstaff-officers were white. Another regiment was raised and officered\r\nlike the first--only two white men in it; while the third regiment was\r\nofficered without regard to nationality. Two Colored batteries were\r\nraised, but all the officers were white because there were no Negroes\r\nfound who understood that arm of the service.\r\n\r\nThe summer was gone, and Gen. McClellan, instead of \"taking Richmond,\"\r\nhad closed his campaign on the Peninsula most ingloriously. The\r\nPresident was compelled to make another call for troops--60,000.\r\nConscription was unavoidable in many places, and prejudice against the\r\nmilitary employment of Negroes began to decrease in proportion to the\r\nincrease of the chances of white men to be drafted. On the 16th of\r\nJuly, 1862, Gen. Henry Wilson, United States Senator from\r\nMassachusetts, and Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs,\r\nintroduced a bill in the Senate amending the act of 1795, prescribing\r\nthe manner of the calling forth of the militia to suppress\r\ninsurrections, etc. Several amendments were offered, much debate was\r\nhad, and finally it passed, amended, empowering the President to\r\naccept \"persons of African descent, for the purpose of constructing\r\nentrenchments or performing camp service, or _any_ war service for\r\nwhich they may be found competent.\" It was agreed, grudgingly, to free\r\nthe slaves of rebels _only_ who should faithfully serve the\r\ncountry,--but _not_ their wives and children! The vote was 28 yeas to\r\n9 nays. It went to the House, where it was managed by Mr. Stevens, of\r\nPennsylvania, and upon a call of the previous question was passed. On\r\nthe next day, July 17th, it received the signature of the President,\r\nand became the law of the land.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January the Army Appropriation bill was under\r\nconsideration in the United States Senate. Garrett Davis, of Kentucky,\r\nhad opposed, by the most frantic and desperate efforts, every attempt\r\nto use Negroes in any capacity to aid in the suppression of the\r\nRebellion. Accordingly he offered the following amendment to the\r\nAppropriation bill:\r\n\r\n     \"Provided, That no part of the sums appropriated by this act\r\n     shall be disbursed for the pay, subsistence, or any other\r\n     supplies, of any negro, free or slave, in the armed military\r\n     service of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIt received 8 votes, with 28 against it. Those who sustained the\r\namendment were all Democrats:\r\n\r\nMessrs. Carlyle, G. Davis, Kennedy, Latham, Nesmith, Powell, Turpie,\r\nand Wall.\r\n\r\nThe fight against the employment of Negroes as soldiers was renewed.\r\nOn every occasion the opposition was led by a Kentucky representative!\r\nOn the 21st of December, 1863, during the pendency of the Deficiency\r\nbill in the House, Mr. Harding, of Kentucky, desired to amend it by\r\ninserting the following:\r\n\r\n     \"_Provided_, That no part of the moneys aforesaid shall be\r\n     applied to the raising, arming, equipping, or paying of negro\r\n     soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was rejected: yeas, 41; nays, 105. The yeas were:\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ancona, Bliss, James S. Brown, Coffroth, Cox, Dawson,\r\nDennison, Eden, Edgerton, Eldridge, Finck, Grider, Hall, Harding,\r\nHarrington, Benjamin G. Harris, Charles M. Harris, Philip Johnson,\r\nWilliam Johnson, King, Knapp, Law, Long, Marcy, McKinney, William H.\r\nMiller, James R. Morris, Morrison, Noble, John O'Neill, Pendleton,\r\nSamuel J. Randall, Rogers, Ross, Scott, Stiles, Strouse, Stuart,\r\nChilton A. White, Joseph W. White, Yeaman.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January, 1863, the Secretary of War authorized Gov.\r\nJohn A. Andrew, of Massachusetts, to raise two regiments of Negro\r\ntroops to serve three years. The order allowed the governor to raise\r\n\"volunteer companies of artillery for duty in the forts of\r\nMassachusetts and elsewhere, and such companies of infantry for the\r\nvolunteer military service as he may find convenient, and may include\r\npersons of African descent, organized into separate corps.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Massachusetts immediately delegated authority to John\r\nW. M. Appleton to superintend the recruiting of the 54th\r\nMassachusetts, the first regiment of free Colored men raised at the\r\nNorth. The regiment was filled by the 13th of May, and ready to march\r\nto the front. It had been arranged that the regiment should pass\r\nthrough New York City on its way to the scene of the war in South\r\nCarolina, but the Chief of Police of New York suggested that the\r\nregiment would be subject to insult if it came. The regiment was sent\r\nforth with the blessings of Massachusetts and the prayers of its\r\npatriotic people. It went by water to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nWhile Massachusetts was engaged in recruiting Negro soldiers, Gen.\r\nLorenzo Thomas, Adjutant-General of the United States Army, was\r\ndespatched from Washington to the Mississippi Valley, where he\r\ninaugurated a system of recruiting service for Negroes. In a speech to\r\nthe officers and men in the organization of white troops, he said, on\r\nthe 8th of April, 1863, at Lake Providence, La.:\r\n\r\n     \"You know full well--for you have been over this country--that\r\n     the Rebels have sent into the field all their available fighting\r\n     men--every man capable of bearing arms; and you know they have\r\n     kept at home all their slaves for the raising of subsistence for\r\n     their armies in the field. In this way they can bring to bear\r\n     against us all the strength of their so-called Confederate\r\n     States; while we at the North can only send a portion of our\r\n     fighting force, being compelled to leave behind another portion\r\n     to cultivate our fields and supply the wants of an immense army.\r\n     The Administration has determined to take from the Rebels this\r\n     source of supply--to take their negroes and compel them to send\r\n     back a portion of their whites to cultivate their deserted\r\n     plantations--and very poor persons they would be to fill the\r\n     place of the dark-hued laborer. They must do this, or their\r\n     armies will starve. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"All of you will some day be on picket duty; and I charge you\r\n     all, if any of this unfortunate race come within your lines, that\r\n     you do not turn them away, but receive them kindly and\r\n     cordially. They are to be encouraged to come to us; they are to\r\n     be received with open arms; they are to be fed and clothed; they\r\n     are to be armed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, 1863, Gen. Banks, in an order directing the\r\nrecruiting of the \"Corps d'Afrique,\" said:\r\n\r\n     \"The prejudices or opinions of men are in no wise involved\"; and\r\n     \"it is not established upon any dogma of equality, or other\r\n     theory, but as a practical and sensible matter of business. The\r\n     Government makes use of mules, horses, uneducated and educated\r\n     White men, in the defense of its institutions. Why should not the\r\n     negro contribute whatever is in his power for the cause in which\r\n     he is as deeply interested as other men? We may properly demand\r\n     from him whatever service he can render,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1863, Adjutant-General Thomas issued the following\r\norder respecting the military employment of Negroes as soldiers:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \"ENLISTMENT OF COLORED TROOPS.\r\n\r\n                       \"GENERAL ORDERS, No. 329.\r\n\r\n                         \"WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, }\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, D.

TOWNSEND,\r\n                                        \"_Assistant Adjutant-General_.\"\r\n\r\nThis order was extended, on October 26th, to Delaware, at the personal\r\nrequest of Governor Cannon.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November, 1863, the Union League Club of New York City\r\nappointed a committee for the purpose of recruiting Colored troops.\r\nCol. George Bliss was made chairman and entered upon the work with\r\nenergy and alacrity. On the 23d of November the committee addressed a\r\nletter to Horatio Seymour, Governor of New York, stating that as he\r\nhad no authority to grant them permission to enlist a Negro regiment;\r\nand as the National Government was unwilling to grant such authority\r\nwithout the sympathy and assent of the State government, they would\r\nfeel greatly obliged should his excellency grant the committee his\r\nofficial concurrence. Gov. Seymour assured the committee of his\r\nofficial inability to grant authority for the raising of Colored\r\ntroops,--just what the committee had written him,--and referred them\r\nto the National Government, on the 27th of November. The committee\r\napplied to the authorities at Washington, and on the 5th of December,\r\n1863, the Secretary of War granted them authority to raise the 20th\r\nRegiment of United States Colored Troops. Having secured the authority\r\nof the Government to begin their work, the committee wrote Gov.\r\nSeymour: \"We express the hope that, so far as in your power, you will\r\ngive to the movement your aid and countenance.\" The governor never\r\nfound the time to answer the request of the committee!\r\n\r\nThe work was pushed forward with zeal and enthusiasm. The Colored men\r\nrallied to the call, and within two weeks from the time the committee\r\ncalled for Colored volunteers 1,000 men responded. By the 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1864, a second regiment was full; and thus in forty-five days\r\nthe Union League Club Committee on the Recruiting of Colored Regiments\r\nhad raised 2,000 soldiers!\r\n\r\nOut of 9,000 men of color, eligible by age--18 to 45 years--to go into\r\nthe service, 2,300 enlisted in less than sixty days. There was no\r\nbounty held out to them as an incentive to enlist; no protection\r\npromised to their families, nor to them should they fall into the\r\nhands of the enemy. But they were patriots! They were willing to\r\nendure any thing rather than the evils that would surely attend the\r\ntriumph of the Confederacy. They went to the front under auspicious\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe 20th Regiment, under the command of Col. Bartram, landed at\r\nThirty-Sixth Street, was headed by the police and the patriotic\r\nmembers of the Union League Club, and had a triumphal march through\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n     \"The scene of yesterday,\" says a New York paper, \"was one which\r\n     marks an era of progress in the political and social history of\r\n     New York. A thousand men with black skins and clad and equipped\r\n     with the uniforms and arms of the United States Government,\r\n     marched from their camp through the most aristocratic and busy\r\n     streets, received a grand ovation at the hands of the wealthiest\r\n     and most respectable ladies and gentlemen of New York, and then\r\n     moved down Broadway to the steamer which bears them to their\r\n     destination--all amid the enthusiastic cheers, the encouraging\r\n     plaudits, the waving handkerchiefs, the showering bouquets and\r\n     other approving manifestations of a hundred thousand of the most\r\n     loyal of our people.\r\n\r\n     \"In the month of July last the homes of these people were burned\r\n     and pillaged by an infuriated political mob; they and their\r\n     families were hunted down and murdered in the public streets of\r\n     this city; and the force and majesty of the law were powerless to\r\n     protect them. Seven brief months have passed, and a thousand of\r\n     these despised and persecuted men march through the city in the\r\n     garb of United States soldiers, in vindication of their own\r\n     manhood, and with the approval of a countless multitude--in\r\n     effect saving from inevitable and distasteful conscription the\r\n     same number of those who hunted their persons and destroyed their\r\n     homes during those days of humiliation and disgrace. This is\r\n     noble vengeance--a vengeance taught by Him who commanded, 'Love\r\n     them that hate you; do good to them that persecute you.'\"\r\n\r\nThe recruiting of Colored troops in Pennsylvania was carried on,\r\nperhaps, with more vigor, intelligence, and enthusiasm than in any of\r\nthe other free States. A committee for the recruiting of men of color\r\nfor the United States army was appointed at Philadelphia, with Thomas\r\nWebster as Chairman, Cadwalader Biddle, as Secretary, and S. A.\r\nMercer, as Treasurer. This committee raised $33,388.00 for the\r\nrecruiting of Colored regiments. The 54th and 55th Massachusetts\r\nregiments had cost about $60,000, but this committee agreed to raise\r\nthree regiments at a cost of $10,000 per regiment.\r\n\r\nThe committee founded a camp, and named it \"Camp William Penn,\" at\r\nShelton Hill, near Philadelphia. On the 26th of June, 1863, the first\r\nsquad of eighty men went into camp. On the 3d of February, 1864, the\r\ncommittee made the following statement, in reference to the raising of\r\nregiments:\r\n\r\n     \"On the 24th July, 1863, the First (3d United States) regiment\r\n     was full.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 13th September, 1863, the Second (6th United States)\r\n     regiment was full.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 4th December, 1863, the Third (8th United States)\r\n     regiment was full.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 6th January, 1864, the Fourth (22d United States)\r\n     regiment was full.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 3d February, 1864, the Fifth (25th United States)\r\n     regiment was full.\r\n\r\n     \"August 13th, 1863, the Third United States regiment left Camp\r\n     William Penn, and was in front of Fort Wagner when it\r\n     surrendered.\r\n\r\n     \"October 14th, 1863, the Sixth United States regiment left for\r\n     Yorktown.\r\n\r\n     \"January 16th, 1864, the Eighth United States regiment left for\r\n     Hilton Head.\r\n\r\n     \"The 22d and 25th regiments are now at Camp William Penn, waiting\r\n     orders from the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe duty of recruiting \"Colored troops\" in the Department of the\r\nCumberland was committed by Secretary Stanton to an able, honest, and\r\npatriotic man, Mr. George L. Stearns, of Massachusetts. Mr. Stearns\r\nhad devoted his energies, wealth, and time to the cause of the slave\r\nduring the holy anti-slavery agitation. He was a wealthy merchant of\r\nBoston; dwelt, with a noble wife and beautiful children, at Medford.\r\nHe had been, from the commencement of the agitation, an ultra\r\nAbolitionist. He regarded slavery as a gigantic system of complicated\r\nevils, at war with all the known laws of civilized society; inimical\r\nto the fundamental principles of political economy; destructive to\r\nrepublican institutions; hateful in the sight of God, and ever\r\nabhorrent to all honest men. He hated slavery. He hated truckling,\r\nobsequious, cringing hypocrites. He put his feelings into vigorous\r\nEnglish, and keyed his deeds and actions to the sublime notes of\r\ncharity that filled his heart and adorned a long and eminently useful\r\nlife. He gave shelter to the majestic and heroic John Brown. His door\r\nwas--like the heavenly gates--ajar to every fugitive from slavery, and\r\nhis fiery earnestness kindled the flagging zeal of many a conservative\r\nfriend of God's poor.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was chosen to put muskets into the hands of the Negroes in\r\nthe Department of the Cumberland. His rank was that of major, with the\r\npowers of an assistant adjutant-general. He took up his headquarters\r\nat Nashville, Tennessee. He carried into the discharge of the duties\r\nof his important office large executive ability, excellent judgment,\r\nand rare fidelity. He organized the best regiments that served in the\r\nWestern army. When he had placed the work in excellent condition he\r\ncommitted it to the care of Capt. R. D. Mussey, who afterward was\r\nmade the Colonel of the 100th U. S. Colored Troops.\r\n\r\nThe intense and unrelenting prejudice against the Negroes, and their\r\nignorance of military tactics, made it necessary for the Government to\r\nprovide suitable white commissioned officers. The prospect was\r\npleasing to many young white men in the ranks; and ambition went far\r\nto irradicate prejudice against Negro soldiers. Nearly every white\r\nprivate and non-commissioned officer was expecting the lightning to\r\nstrike him; _every_ one expected to be promoted to be a commissioned\r\nofficer, and, therefore, had no prejudice against the men they hoped\r\nto command as their _superior_ officers. To prepare the large number\r\nof applicants for commissions in Colored regiments a \"Free Military\r\nSchool\" was established at No. 1210 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.\r\nSecretary Stanton gave the school the following official endorsement\r\nin the spring of 1864.\r\n\r\n                                                \"WAR DEPARTMENT,     }\r\n                                   \"WASHINGTON CITY, March 21, 1864. }\r\n\r\n     \"THOMAS WEBSTER, ESQ., _Chairman_,\r\n            \"1210 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: The project of establishing a free Military School for the\r\n     education of candidates for the position of commissioned officers\r\n     in the Colored Troops, received the cordial approval of this\r\n     Department.

The school\r\nperformed excellent work; and furnished for the service many brave and\r\nefficient officers.\r\n\r\nBy December, 1863, 100,000 Colored Troops were in the service. About\r\n50,000 were armed by that time and in the field.\r\n\r\nEverywhere they were winning golden laurels by their aptitude in\r\ndrill, their patient performance of the duties of the camp, and by\r\ntheir matchless courage in the deadly field. The young white officers\r\nwho so cheerfully bore the odium of commanding Colored Troops, and who\r\nso heroically faced the dangers of capture and cruel death, had no\r\nsuperiors in the army. They had the supreme satisfaction of commanding\r\nbrave men to whom they soon found themselves deeply attached. It was a\r\nschool in which the noblest and purest patriot might feel himself\r\nhonored and inspired to the performance of deathless deeds of valor.\r\n\r\nThe following tables indicate the manner in which the work was done.\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Examination of Applicants for Command of Colored Troops,\r\nbefore the Board at Washington, of which Major-General Silas Casey is\r\nPresident, from the organization of the Board to March 29th, 1864,\r\ninclusive._\r\n\r\n                                   Number accepted and for\r\n                                    what rank recommended.\r\n                                 ---------------------------\r\n                                 Colonels.\r\n                                 |    Lieutenant-Colonels.\r\n                                 |    |    Majors.\r\n Rank.                           |    |    |    Captains.\r\n                                 |    |    |    |    1st Lieutenants.\r\n                                 |    |    |    |    |   2d Lieutenants.\r\n                         Number  |    |    |    |    |    |    Number\r\n                      examined.  |    |    |    |    |    |    rejected.\r\n Colonels                     4  -

Some of the best men and leading journals were very\r\nconservative on this question. An elaborate and cautious editorial in\r\nthe \"New York Times\" of February 16, 1863, fairly exhibits the\r\nnervousness of the North on the subject of the military employment of\r\nthe Negro.\r\n\r\n                    \"USE OF NEGROES AS SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n     \"One branch of Congress has rejected a bill authorizing the\r\n     enlistment of negro soldiers. Mr. Sumner declares his intention\r\n     to persist in forcing the passage of such a law by offering it as\r\n     an amendment to some other bill. Meantime the President, by laws\r\n     already enacted, has full authority over the subject, and we can\r\n     see no good object to be attained by forcing it into the\r\n     discussions of Congress and adding it to the causes of dissension\r\n     already existing in the country at large.\r\n\r\n     \"A law of last Congress authorized the President to use the\r\n     negroes as laborers or _otherwise_, as they can be made most\r\n     useful in the work of quelling the rebellion. Under this\r\n     authority, it is understood that he has decided to use them in\r\n     certain cases as soldiers. Some of them are already employed in\r\n     garrisoning Southern forts, on the Mississippi River, which\r\n     whites cannot safely occupy on account of the climate. Governor\r\n     Sprague has authority to raise negro regiments in Rhode Island,\r\n     and has proclaimed his intention to lead them when raised in\r\n     person, and Gov. Andrew has received similar authority for the\r\n     State of Massachusetts. We see, therefore, not the slightest\r\n     necessity for any further legislation on this subject, and hope\r\n     Mr. Sumner will consent that Congress may give its attention,\r\n     during the short remainder of its session, to topics of pressing\r\n     practical importance.\r\n\r\n     \"Whether negroes shall or shall not be employed as soldiers,\r\n     seems to us purely a question of expediency, and to be solved\r\n     satisfactorily only by experiment. As to our _right_ so to employ\r\n     them, it seems absurd to question it for a moment. The most\r\n     bigoted and inveterate stickler for the absolute divinity of\r\n     slavery in the Southern States would scarcely insist that, as a\r\n     matter of right, either constitutional or moral, we could not\r\n     employ negroes as soldiers in the army. Whether they are, or are\r\n     not, by nature, by law, or by usage, the equals of the white man,\r\n     makes not the slightest difference in this respect. Even those at\r\n     the North who are so terribly shocked at the prospect of their\r\n     being thus employed, confine their objections to grounds of\r\n     expediency. They urge:\r\n\r\n     \"1st. That the negroes will not fight. This, if true, is\r\n     exclusive against their being used as soldiers. But we see no way\r\n     of testing the question except by trying the experiment. It will\r\n     take but a very short time and but very few battles to determine\r\n     whether they have courage, steadiness, subjection to military\r\n     discipline and the other qualities essential to good soldiership\r\n     or not. If they have, this objection will fall, if not then\r\n     beyond all question they will cease to be employed.\r\n\r\n     \"2d. It is said that the whites will not fight with them--that\r\n     the prejudice against them is so strong that our own citizens\r\n     will not enlist, or will quit the service, if compelled to fight\r\n     by their side,--and that we shall thus lose two white soldiers\r\n     for one black one that we gain. If this is true, they ought not\r\n     to be employed. The object of using them is to strengthen our\r\n     military force; and if the project does not accomplish this, it\r\n     is a failure. The question, moreover, is one of fact, not of\r\n     theory. It matters nothing to say that it _ought_ not to have\r\n     this effect--that the prejudice is absurd and should not be\r\n     consulted. The point is, not what men _ought_ to do, but what\r\n     they will _do_. We have to deal with human nature, with\r\n     prejudice, with passion, with habits of thought and feeling, as\r\n     well as with reason and sober judgment and the moral sense.\r\n     Possibly the Government may have made a mistake in its estimate\r\n     of the effect of this measure on the public mind. The use of\r\n     negroes as soldiers may have a worse effect on the army and on\r\n     the people than they have supposed.\r\n\r\n     \"But this is a matter of opinion upon which men have differed.\r\n     Very prominent and influential persons, Governors of States,\r\n     Senators, popular Editors and others have predicted the best\r\n     results from such a measure, while others have anticipated the\r\n     worst. The President has resolved to try the experiment. If it\r\n     works well, the country will be the gainer. If not, we have no\r\n     doubt it will be abandoned. If the effect of using negroes as\r\n     soldiers upon the army and the country, proves to be depressing\r\n     and demoralizing, so as to weaken rather than strengthen our\r\n     military operations, they will cease to be employed. The\r\n     President is a practical man, not at all disposed to sacrifice\r\n     practical results to abstract theories.\r\n\r\n     \"3d. It is said we shall get no negroes--or not enough to prove\r\n     of any service. In the free States very few will volunteer, and\r\n     in the Slave States we can get but few, because the Rebels will\r\n     push them Southward as fast as we advance upon them. This may be\r\n     so. We confess we share, with many others, the opinion that it\r\n     will.\r\n\r\n     \"But we may as well wait patiently the short time required to\r\n     settle the point. When we hear more definitely from Gov.\r\n     Sprague's black battalions and Gov. Andrew's negro brigades, we\r\n     shall know more accurately what to think of the measure as one\r\n     for the Free States; and when we hear further of the success of\r\n     Gen. Banks and Gen. Saxton in enlisting them at the South, we can\r\n     form a better judgment of the movement there. If we get very few\r\n     or even none, the worst that can be said will be that the project\r\n     is a failure; and the demonstration that it is so will have\r\n     dissipated another of the many delusions which dreamy people have\r\n     cherished about this war.\r\n\r\n     \"4th. The use of negroes will exasperate the South; and some of\r\n     our Peace Democrats make that an objection to the measure. We\r\n     presume it will; but so will any other scheme we may adopt which\r\n     is warlike and effective in its character and results. If that\r\n     consideration is to govern us, we must follow Mr. Vallandingham's\r\n     advice and stop the war entirely, or as Mr. McMasters puts it in\r\n     his Newark speech, go 'for an immediate and _unconditional_\r\n     peace.' We are not quite ready for _that_ yet.\r\n\r\n     \"The very best thing that can be done under existing\r\n     circumstances, in our judgment, is to possess our Souls in\r\n     patience while _the experiment_ is being tried. The problem will\r\n     probably speedily solve itself--much more speedily than heated\r\n     discussion or harsh criminations can solve it.\"\r\n\r\nIt didn't require a great deal of time for the Black troops to make a\r\ngood impression; and while the Congress, the press, and the people\r\nwere being exercised over the probable out-come, the first regiment of\r\nex-slaves ever equipped for the service was working a revolution in\r\npublic sentiment. On the last day of January, 1863, the \"New York\r\nTribune\" printed the following editorial on the subject:\r\n\r\n     \"A disloyal minority in the House is factiously resisting the\r\n     passage of the Steven's bill, authorizing the President to raise\r\n     and equip 150,000 soldiers of African descent. Meanwhile, in the\r\n     Department of the South a full regiment of blacks has been\r\n     enlisted under Gen. Saxton; is already uniformed and armed, and\r\n     has been actively drilling for the last seven weeks. A letter\r\n     which we printed on Wednesday from our Special Correspondent, who\r\n     is usually well qualified to judge of its military proficiency,\r\n     says of this regiment that no honest-minded, unprejudiced\r\n     observer could come to any other conclusion than that it had\r\n     attained a remarkable proficiency in the short period during\r\n     which it had been drilled. We have in addition from an officer of\r\n     the regiment, who is thoroughly informed as to its condition, a\r\n     very interesting statement of its remarkable progress, and some\r\n     valuable suggestions on the employment of negro troops in\r\n     general.\r\n\r\n     \"'This regiment--the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, Colonel\r\n     Thomas Wentworth Higginson--marched on the 17th for the first\r\n     time through the streets of Beaufort. It was the remark of many\r\n     bitterly pro-slavery officers that they looked \"splendidly.\" They\r\n     marched through by platoons, and returned by the flank; the\r\n     streets were filled with soldiers and citizens, but every man\r\n     looked straight before him and carried himself steadily. How many\r\n     white regiments do the same? One black soldier said: \"We didn't\r\n     see a thing in Beaufort; ebery man hold his head straight up to\r\n     de front, ebery step was worth a half dollar.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'Many agreed with what is my deliberate opinion,' writes this\r\n     officer, 'that no regiment in this department can, even now,\r\n     surpass this one. In marching in regimental line I have not seen\r\n     it equalled. In the different modes of passing from line into\r\n     column, and from column into line, in changing front,\r\n     countermarching, forming divisions, and forming square, whether\r\n     by the common methods, or by Casey's methods, it does itself the\r\n     greatest credit. Nor have I yet discovered the slightest ground\r\n     of inferiority to white troops.\r\n\r\n     \"'So far is it from being true that the blacks as material\r\n     soldiers are inferior to white, that they are in some respects\r\n     manifestly superior; especially in aptness for drill, because of\r\n     their imitativeness and love of music; docility in discipline,\r\n     when their confidence is once acquired; and enthusiasm for the\r\n     cause. _They_ at least know what they are fighting for. They have\r\n     also a _pride_ as soldiers, which is not often found in our white\r\n     regiments, where every private is only too apt to think himself\r\n     specially qualified to supersede his officers. They are above all\r\n     things faithful and trustworthy on duty from the start. In the\r\n     best white regiments it has been found impossible to trust\r\n     newly-enlisted troops with the countersign--they invariably\r\n     betray it to their comrades. There has been but one such instance\r\n     in this black regiment, and that was in the case of a mere boy,\r\n     whose want of fidelity excited the greatest indignation among his\r\n     comrades.\r\n\r\n     \"'Drunkenness, the bane of our army, does not _exist_ among the\r\n     black troops. There has not been _one_ instance in the regiment.\r\n     Enough. The only difficulty which threatened to become at all\r\n     serious was that of absence without leave and overstaying passes,\r\n     but this was checked by a few decided measures and has ceased\r\n     entirely.\r\n\r\n     \"'When this regiment was first organized, some months ago, it had\r\n     to encounter bitter hostility from the white troops at Port\r\n     Royal, and there was great exultation when General Hunter found\r\n     himself obliged to disband it. Since its reorganization this\r\n     feeling seems to have almost disappeared. There is no complaint\r\n     by the privates of insult or ill-treatment, formerly\r\n     disgracefully common from their white comrades.\r\n\r\n     \"'It has been supposed that these black troops would prove fitter\r\n     for garrison duty than active service in the field. No impression\r\n     could be more mistaken. Their fidelity as sentinels adapts them\r\n     especially, no doubt, to garrison duty; but their natural place\r\n     is in the advance. There is an inherent dash and fire about them\r\n     which white troops of more sluggish Northern blood do not\r\n     emulate, and their hearty enthusiasm shows itself in all ways.\r\n     Such qualities are betrayed even in drill, as anybody may know\r\n     who has witnessed the dull, mechanical way in which ordinary\r\n     troops make a bayonet charge on the parade ground, and contrasts\r\n     it with the spirit of those negro troops in the same movement.\r\n     They are to be used, moreover, in a country which they know\r\n     perfectly. Merely from their knowledge of wood-craft and\r\n     water-craft, it would be a sheer waste of material to keep them\r\n     in garrison. It is scarcely the knowledge which is at once\r\n     indispensable and impossible to be acquired by our troops. See\r\n     these men and it is easier to understand the material of which\r\n     the famous Chasseurs d'Afrique are composed.'\r\n\r\n     \"General Saxton, in a letter published yesterday, said: 'In no\r\n     regiment have I ever seen duty performed with so much\r\n     cheerfulness and alacrity. * * * In the organization of this\r\n     regiment I have labored under difficulties which might have\r\n     discouraged one who had less faith in the wisdom of the measure;\r\n     but I am glad to report that the experiment is a complete\r\n     success. My belief is that when we get a footing on the mainland\r\n     regiments may be raised which will do more than any now in the\r\n     service to put an end to this rebellion.'\r\n\r\n     \"We are learning slowly, very slowly, in this war to use the\r\n     means of success which lie ready to our hands. We have learnt at\r\n     last that the negro is essential to our success, but we are still\r\n     hesitating whether to allow him to do all he can or only a part.\r\n\r\n     \"It will not take many such proofs as this black regiment now\r\n     offers to convince us of the full value of our new allies. But we\r\n     ought to go beyond that selfishness which regards only our own\r\n     necessities and remember that the negro has a right to fight for\r\n     his freedom, and that he will be all the more fit to enjoy his\r\n     new destiny by helping to achieve it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of March, 1863, Mr. Greeley sent forth the following able\r\nand sensible editorial on the Negro as a soldier:\r\n\r\n                           \"NEGRO TROOPS.\r\n\r\n     \"Facts are beginning to dispel prejudices. Enemies of the negro\r\n     race, who have persistently denied the capacity and doubted the\r\n     courage of the Blacks, are unanswerably confuted by the good\r\n     conduct and gallant deeds of the men whom they persecute and\r\n     slander. From many quarters come evidence of the swiftly\r\n     approaching success which is to crown what is still by some\r\n     persons deemed to be the experiment of arming whom the\r\n     Proclamation of Freedom liberates.\r\n\r\n     \"The 1st and 2d South Carolina Volunteers, under Colonels\r\n     Higginson and Montgomery, have ascended the St. John's River in\r\n     Florida as far as Jacksonville, and have re-occupied that\r\n     important town which was once before taken and afterward\r\n     abandoned by the Union forces. Many of the negroes composing\r\n     these regiments had been slaves in this very place. Their memory\r\n     of old wrongs, of the privations, outrages and tortures of\r\n     Slavery, must here, if anywhere, have been fresh and vivid, and\r\n     the passions which opportunity for just revenges stimulates even\r\n     in white breasts, ought to have been roused more than in all\r\n     other places on the spot where they had suffered.\r\n\r\n     \"If, then, Jacksonville were to-day in ashes, and the ghastly\r\n     spirit visions of '_The World_' materialized into terrible\r\n     realities, the negro haters would have no, cause to be\r\n     disappointed. '_The World_' hailed the alleged repulse and\r\n     massacre of the negroes and white officers--a report which it\r\n     invented outright, in sheer malignity, in order to forestall\r\n     public opinion by creating a belief in the failure of the\r\n     expedition--would have changed into agonized shrieks over the\r\n     outrages on its Southern brethren. The experiment of subjecting\r\n     negroes to military rules and accustoming them to those amenities\r\n     of civilized warfare which the rebels so uniformly practice would\r\n     again have been declared to be a hopeless failure; and for the\r\n     hundredth time the Proclamation and the radicals who advised it\r\n     would have been pilloried for public execration.\r\n\r\n     \"Since, however, the contrary of all this is true, it may be\r\n     presumed by a confiding public which does not read it that '_The\r\n     World_' has honestly acknowledged the injustice of its slanders.\r\n     It is unpleasant to disabuse a confiding public on any subject,\r\n     but we who are sometimes obliged to look at that paper as a\r\n     professional duty, regret to say that we have not discovered a\r\n     single evidence of its repentance. The facts are, however, that\r\n     Colonel Higginson's men landed quietly at Jacksonville, marched\r\n     through its streets in perfect order, committed no outrages or\r\n     excesses of any kind, and by the testimony of all witnesses\r\n     conducted themselves with a military decorum and perfect\r\n     discipline which is far from common among white regiments in\r\n     similar circumstances. They have gone before this time still\r\n     further into the interior, and will doubtless do good service in\r\n     a direction where their presence has been least expected by the\r\n     Rebels. In the only instance in which the white chivalry ventured\r\n     to make a stand against them, the whites were defeated and driven\r\n     off the field by the Blacks.\r\n\r\n     \"The truth is that the fitness of negroes to be soldiers has long\r\n     since, in this country and elsewhere, been amply demonstrated,\r\n     and the success of Col. Higginson's Black Troops is no matter of\r\n     surprise to any person tolerably well informed about the history\r\n     of the race. If it were in any sense an experiment, the only\r\n     thing to be tested was the obstinacy of our Saxon prejudice which\r\n     denied the possibility of success, and did what it could to\r\n     prevent it. But even Saxon prejudice must shortly yield to the\r\n     logic of facts.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of the fact that the United States Government had employed\r\nNegroes as soldiers to fight the battles of the Union, there were men\r\nof intelligence who held that it was all wrong in fact, in policy, and\r\nin point of law. And this opinion attained such proportions that the\r\nSecretary of War felt called upon to request the opinion of Judge\r\nAdvocate Holt. It is given here.\r\n\r\n     ENLISTMENT OF SLAVES.\r\n\r\n     In a letter to Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, dated Aug. 20,\r\n     1863, Judge Advocate Holt said: \"The right of the Government to\r\n     employ for the suppression of the rebellion persons of African\r\n     Descent held to service or labor under the local law, rests\r\n     firmly on two grounds:\r\n\r\n     \"First, as property. Both our organic law and the usages of our\r\n     institutions under it recognize fully the authority of the\r\n     Government to seize and apply to public use private property, on\r\n     making compensation therefor. What the use may be to which it is\r\n     to be applied does not enter into the question of the right to\r\n     make the seizure, which is untrammelled in its exercise, save by\r\n     the single condition mentioned.\r\n\r\n     \"Secondly, as persons. While those of African Descent held to\r\n     service or labor in several of the States, occupy under the laws\r\n     of such States, the status of property; they occupy also under\r\n     the Federal Government, the status of 'persons.' They are\r\n     referred to so _nomine_ in the Constitution of the United States,\r\n     and it is not as property but as 'persons' that they are\r\n     represented on the floor of Congress, and thus form a prominent\r\n     constituent element alike in the organization and practical\r\n     administration of the Government.\r\n\r\n     \"The obligation of all persons--irrespective of creed or\r\n     color--to bear arms, if physically capable of doing so, in\r\n     defence of the Government under which they live and by which\r\n     they are protected, is one that is universally acknowledged and\r\n     enforced. Corresponding to this obligation is the duty resting on\r\n     those charged with the administration of the Government, to\r\n     employ such persons in the military service whenever the public\r\n     safety may demand it. Congress realized both this obligation on\r\n     the one hand, and this duty on the other when, by the 12th\r\n     section of the Act of the 17th of July, 1862, it was enacted that\r\n     'the President be and is hereby authorized to receive into the\r\n     service of the United States for the purpose of constructing\r\n     intrenchments, or performing camp service or any other labor, or\r\n     any military or naval service for which they may be found\r\n     competent, persons of African Descent, and such persons shall be\r\n     enrolled and organized under such regulations not inconsistent\r\n     with the Constitution, and the laws, as the President may\r\n     prescribe.'\r\n\r\n     \"The terms of this Act are without restriction and no distinction\r\n     is made, or was intended to be made, between persons of African\r\n     Descent held to service or labor or those not so held.\r\n\r\n     \"The President is empowered to receive them all into the military\r\n     service, and assign them such duty as they may be found competent\r\n     to perform.\r\n\r\n     \"The tenacious and brilliant valor displayed by troops of this\r\n     race at Port Hudson, Milliken's Bend, and Fort Wagner, has\r\n     sufficiently demonstrated to the President and to the country,\r\n     the character of service of which they are capable. In the\r\n     interpretation given to the Enrolment Act, free citizens of\r\n     African Descent are treated as citizens of the United States, in\r\n     the sense of the law, and are everywhere being drafted into the\r\n     military service.\r\n\r\n     \"In reference to the other class of persons of this race--those\r\n     held to service or labor--the 12th section of the Act of July\r\n     17th is still in full force, and the President may in his\r\n     discretion receive them into the army and assign them to such\r\n     field of duty as he may deem them prepared to occupy. In view of\r\n     the loyalty of this race, and of the obstinate courage which they\r\n     have shown themselves to possess, they certainly constitute at\r\n     this crisis in our history a most powerful and reliable arm of\r\n     the public defence. Whether this arm shall now be exerted is not\r\n     a question of power or right, but purely of policy, to be\r\n     determined by the estimate which may be entertained of the\r\n     conflict in which we are engaged, and of the necessity that\r\n     presses to bring this waste of blood and treasure to a close. A\r\n     man precipitated into a struggle for his life on land or sea,\r\n     instinctively and almost necessarily puts forth every energy with\r\n     which he is endowed, and eagerly seizes upon every source of\r\n     strength within his grasp; and a nation battling for existence,\r\n     that does not do the same, may well be regarded as neither wise\r\n     nor obedient to that great law of self-preservation, from which\r\n     are derived our most urgent and solemn duties. That there exists\r\n     a prejudice against the employment of persons of African Descent\r\n     is undeniable; it is, however, rapidly giving way, and never had\r\n     any foundation in reason or loyalty. It originated with and has\r\n     been diligently nurtured by those in sympathy with the Rebellion,\r\n     and its utterance at this moment is necessarily in the interests\r\n     of treason.\r\n\r\n     \"Should the President feel that the public interests require he\r\n     shall exert the power with which he is clothed by the 12th\r\n     section of the Act of the 17th of July, his action should be in\r\n     subordination to the Constitutional principle which exacts that\r\n     compensation shall be made for private property devoted to the\r\n     public uses. A just compensation to loyal claimants to the\r\n     service or labor of persons of African Descent enlisted in our\r\n     army, would accord with the uniform practice of the Government\r\n     and the genius of our institutions!\r\n\r\n     \"Soldiers of this class, after having perilled their lives in the\r\n     defence of the Republic, could not be re-enslaved without a\r\n     national dishonor revolting and unendurable for all who are\r\n     themselves to be free. The compensation made, therefore, should\r\n     be such as entirely to exhaust the interest of claimants; so that\r\n     when soldiers of this class lay down their arms at the close of\r\n     the war, they may at once enter into the enjoyment of that\r\n     freedom symbolized by the flag which they have followed and\r\n     defended.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negro was now a soldier, legally, \"constitutionally.\" He had\r\ndonned the uniform of an American soldier; was entrusted with the\r\nhonor and defence of his country, and had set before him liberty as\r\nhis exceeding great reward. Rejected at first he was at last urged\r\ninto the service--even _drafted_! He was charged with the solution of\r\na great problem--his fitness, his valor. History shall record his\r\ndeeds of patriotism, his marvellous achievements, his splendid\r\ntriumphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] Charleston Mercury, April 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n[92] They were, no doubt, from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[93] New York Herald, Tuesday, August 5, 1862.\r\n\r\n[94] Greeley, vol. ii, pp. 517, 518.\r\n\r\n[95] Many of these had previously been in the three months', nine\r\nmonths', and three years' service, from which they had been honorably\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n[96] This gives Colored Troops enlisted in the States in rebellion;\r\nbesides this, there were 92,576 Colored Troops (included with the\r\nwhite soldiers) in the quotas of the several States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nNEGROES AS SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n     JUSTIFICATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF\r\n     SLAVES AS SOLDIERS.--TRIALS OF THE NEGRO SOLDIER.--HE UNDERGOES\r\n     PERSECUTION FROM THE WHITE NORTHERN TROOPS, AND BARBAROUS\r\n     TREATMENT FROM THE REBELS.--EDITORIAL OF THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" ON\r\n     THE NEGRO SOLDIER IN BATTLE.--REPORT OF THE \"TRIBUNE\" ON THE\r\n     GALLANT EXPLOITS OF THE 1ST SOUTH CAROLINA VOLUNTEERS.--NEGRO\r\n     TROOPS IN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS.--NEGRO SOLDIERS IN THE BATTLE OF\r\n     PORT HUDSON.--DEATH OF CAPTAIN ANDRE CALLIOUX.--DEATH OF\r\n     COLOR-SERGEANT ANSELMAS PLANCIANCOIS.--AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE\r\n     OF PORT HUDSON.--OFFICIAL REPORT OF GEN.

ADEN\r\n     AND COL. FOSTER PRAISING THE EMINENT QUALIFICATIONS OF THE NEGRO\r\n     FOR MILITARY LIFE.--HISTORY RECORDS THEIR DEEDS OF VALOR IN THE\r\n     PRESERVATION OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll history, ancient and modern, Pagan and Christian, justified the\r\nconduct of the Federal Government in the employment of slaves as\r\nsoldiers. Greece had tried the experiment; and at the battle of\r\nMarathon there were two regiments of heavy infantry composed of\r\nslaves. The beleaguered city of Rome offered freedom to her slaves who\r\nshould volunteer as soldiers; and at the battle of Cannae a regiment\r\nof Roman slaves made Hannibal's cohorts reel before their unequalled\r\ncourage. When Abraham heard of the loss of his stock, he armed his\r\nslaves, pursued the enemy, and regained his possessions. Negro\r\nofficers as well as soldiers had shared the perils and glories of the\r\ncampaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte; and even the royal guard at the Court\r\nof Imperial France had been mounted with black soldiers. In two wars\r\nin North America Negro soldiers had followed the fortunes of military\r\nlife, and won the applause of white patriots on two continents. So\r\nthen all history furnished a precedent for the guidance of the United\r\nStates Government in the Civil War in America.\r\n\r\nBut there were several aggravating questions which had to be referred\r\nto the future. In both wars in this country the Negro had fought a\r\nforeign foe--an enemy representing a Christian civilization. He had a\r\nsense of security in going to battle with the colonial fathers; for\r\ntheir sacred battle-songs gave him purpose and courage. And, again,\r\nthe Negro knew that the English soldier had never disgraced the\r\nuniform of Hampden or Wellington by practising the cruelties of\r\nuncivilized warfare upon helpless prisoners. In the Rebellion it was\r\naltogether different. Here was a war between the States of one Union.\r\nHere was a war between two sections differing in civilization. Here\r\nwas a war all about the _Negro_; a war that was to declare him forever\r\nbond, or forever free. Now, in such a war the Negro appeared in battle\r\nagainst his master. For two hundred and forty-three years the Negro\r\nhad been learning the lesson of obedience and obsequious submission to\r\nthe white man. The system of slavery under which he had languished had\r\ndestroyed the family relation, the source of all virtue, self-respect,\r\nand moral growth. The tendency of slavery was to destroy the\r\nconfidence of the slave in his ability and resources, and to\r\ndisqualify him for those relations where the noblest passion of\r\nmankind is to be exercised in an intelligent manner--_amor patriæ_.\r\n\r\nNegro soldiers were required by an act of Congress to fight for the\r\nUnion at a salary of $10 per month, with $3 deducted for\r\nclothing--leaving them only $7 per month as their actual pay. White\r\nsoldiers received $13 per month and clothing.[97]\r\n\r\nThe Negro soldiers had to run the gauntlet of the persecuting hate of\r\nwhite Northern troops, and, if captured, endure the most barbarous\r\ntreatment of the rebels, without a protest on the part of the\r\nGovernment--for at least nearly a year. Hooted at, jeered, and stoned\r\nin the streets of Northern cities as they marched to the front to\r\nfight for the Union; scoffed at and abused by white troops under the\r\nflag of a common country, there was little of a consoling or inspiring\r\nnature in the experience of Negro soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"But none of these things\" moved the Negro soldier. His qualifications\r\nfor the profession of arms were ample and admirable. To begin with,\r\nthe Negro soldier was a patriot of the highest order. No race of\r\npeople in the world are more thoroughly domestic, have such tender\r\nattachments to home and friends as the Negro race. And when his soul\r\nwas quickened with the sublime idea of liberty for himself and\r\nkindred--that his home and country were to be rid of the triple curse\r\nof slavery--his enthusiasm was boundless. His enthusiasm was not mere\r\nanimal excitement. No white soldier who marched to the music of the\r\nUnion possessed a more lofty conception of the sacredness of the war\r\nfor the Union than the Negro. The intensity of his desires, the\r\nsincerity of his prayers, and the sublimity of his faith during the\r\nlong and starless night of his bondage made the Negro a poet, after a\r\nfashion. To him there was poetry in our flag--the red, white, and\r\nblue. Our national odes and airs found a response in his soul, and\r\ninspired him to the performance of heroic deeds. He was always seeing\r\nsomething \"sublime,\" \"glorious,\" \"beautiful,\" \"grand,\" and \"wonderful\"\r\nin war. There was poetry in the swinging, measured tread of companies\r\nand regiments in drill or battle; and dress parade always found the\r\nNegro soldier in the height of his glory. His love of harmonious\r\nsounds, his musical faculty, and delight of show aided him in the\r\nperformance of the most difficult manoeuvres. His imitativeness gave\r\nhim facility in handling his musket and sabre; and his love of\r\ndomestic animals, and natural strength made him a graceful cavalryman\r\nand an efficient artilleryman.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of obedience the Negro had learned so thoroughly as a\r\nslave were turned to good account as a soldier. He obeyed orders to\r\nthe letter. He never used his discretion; he added nothing to, he\r\nsubtracted nothing from, his orders; he made no attempt at reading\r\nbetween the lines; he did not interpret--he _obeyed_. Used to outdoor\r\nlife, with excellent hearing, wonderful eyesight, and great vigilance,\r\nhe was a model picket. Heard every sound, observed every moving thing,\r\nand was quick to shoot, and of steady aim. He was possessed of\r\nexceptionally good teeth, and, therefore, could bite his cartridge and\r\nhard tack. He had been trained to long periods of labor, poor food,\r\nand miserable quarters, and therefore, could endure extreme fatigue\r\nand great exposure.\r\n\r\nHis docility of nature, patient endurance, and hopeful disposition\r\nenabled him to endure long marches, severe hardships, and painful\r\nwounds. His joyous, boisterous songs on the march and in the camp; his\r\nvictorious shout in battle, and his merry laughter in camp proclaimed\r\nhim the insoluble enigma of military life. He never was discouraged;\r\n_melancholia_ had no abiding place in his nature.\r\n\r\nBut how did the Negro meet his master in battle? How did he stand\r\nfire? On the 31st of July, 1863, the \"New York Times,\" editorially\r\nanswered these questions as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Negro soldiers have now been in battle at Port Hudson and at\r\n     Milliken's Bend in Louisiana; at Helena in Arkansas, at Morris\r\n     Island in South Carolina, and at or near Fort Gibson in the\r\n     Indian Territory. In two of these instances they assaulted\r\n     fortified positions and led the assault; in two they fought on\r\n     the defensive, and in one they attacked rebel infantry. In all of\r\n     them they acted in conjunction with white troops and under\r\n     command of white officers. In some instances they acted with\r\n     distinguished bravery, and in all they acted as well as could be\r\n     expected of raw troops.\r\n\r\n     \"Some of these negroes were from the cotton States, others from\r\n     New England States, and others from the slave States of the\r\n     Northwest. Those who fought at Port Hudson were from New Orleans;\r\n     those who fought at Battery Wagner were from Boston; those who\r\n     fought at Helena and Young's Point were from the river counties\r\n     of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Those who fought in the\r\n     Indian Territory were from Missouri.\"\r\n\r\nThis is warm praise from a journal of the high, though conservative,\r\ncharacter of the \"Times.\" Warmer praise and more unqualified praise of\r\nthe Negro soldier's fighting qualities could not be given. And it was\r\nmade after a careful weighing of all the facts and evidence supplied\r\nfrom careful and reliable correspondents. But more specific evidence\r\nwas being furnished on every hand. The 1st South Carolina\r\nVolunteers--the first regiment of Negroes existed during the\r\nwar,--commanded by Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, was the first\r\nBlack regiment of its character under the fire of the enemy. The\r\nregiment covered itself with glory during an expedition upon the St.\r\nJohn's River in Florida. The \"Times\" gave the following editorial\r\nnotice of the expedition at the time, based upon the official report\r\nof the colonel and a letter from its special correspondent:\r\n\r\n                        \"THE NEGROES IN BATTLE.\r\n\r\n     \"Colonel Higginson, of the 1st S. C. Volunteers, furnishes an\r\n     entertaining official report of the exploits of his black\r\n     regiment in Florida. He seems to think it necessary to put his\r\n     case strongly, and in rather exalted language, as well as in such\r\n     a way as to convince the public that negroes will fight. In this\r\n     expedition, his battalion was repeatedly under fire--had rebel\r\n     cavalry, infantry, and, says he, 'even artillery' arranged\r\n     against them, yet in every instance, came off with unblemished\r\n     honor and undisputed triumph. His men made the most urgent\r\n     appeals to him to be allowed to press the flying enemy. They\r\n     exhibited the most fiery energy beyond anything of which Colonel\r\n     Higginson ever read, unless it may be in the case of the French\r\n     Zouaves. He even says that 'it would have been madness to attempt\r\n     with the bravest white troops what he successfully accomplished\r\n     with black ones.' No wanton destruction was permitted, no\r\n     personal outrages desired, during the expedition. The regiment,\r\n     besides the victories which it achieved, and the large amount of\r\n     valuable property which it secured, obtained a cannon and a flag\r\n     which the Colonel very properly asks permission for the regiment\r\n     to retain. The officers and men desire to remain permanently in\r\n     Florida, and obtain supplies of lumber, iron, etc., for the\r\n     Government. The Colonel puts forth a very good suggestion, to the\r\n     effect that a 'chain of such posts would completely alter the\r\n     whole aspect of the war in the seaboard slave States, and would\r\n     accomplish what no accumulation of Northern regiments can so\r\n     easily effect.' This is the very use for negro soldiers suggested\r\n     in the Proclamation of the President. We have no doubt that the\r\n     whole State of Florida might easily be held for the Government in\r\n     this way, by a dozen negro regiments.\"[98]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February, 1863, the \"Times\" gave the following account\r\nof the exploits of this gallant regiment in the following explicit\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     \"ACCOUNT OF A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION INTO GEORGIA AND FLORIDA WITH\r\n     A FORCE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-TWO OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE 1ST\r\n     SOUTH CAROLINA VOLUNTEERS.\r\n\r\n     \"The bravery and good conduct of the regiment more than equalled\r\n     the high anticipations of its commander. The men were repeatedly\r\n     under fire,--were opposed by infantry, cavalry, and\r\n     artillery,--fought on board a steamer exposed to heavy musketry\r\n     fire from the banks of a narrow river,--were tried in all ways,\r\n     and came off invariably with honor and success. They brought away\r\n     property to a large amount, capturing also a cannon and a flag,\r\n     which the Colonel asks leave to keep for the regiment, and which\r\n     he and they have fairly won.\r\n\r\n     \"It will not need many such reports an this--and there have been\r\n     several before it--to shake our inveterate Saxon prejudice\r\n     against the capacity and courage of negro troops. Everybody knows\r\n     that they were used in the Revolution, and in the last war with\r\n     Great Britain fought side by side with white troops, and won\r\n     equal praises from Washington and Jackson. It is shown also that\r\n     black sailors employed on our men-of-war, are valued by their\r\n     commanders, and are on equal terms with their white comrades. If\r\n     on the sea, why not on the land? No officer who has commanded\r\n     black troops has yet reported against them. They are tried in the\r\n     most unfavorable and difficult circumstances, but never fail.\r\n     When shall we learn to use the full strength of the formidable\r\n     ally who is only waiting for a summons to rally under the flag of\r\n     the Union? Colonel Higginson says: 'No officer in this regiment\r\n     now doubts that the successful prosecution of this war lies in\r\n     the unlimited employment of black troops.' The remark is true in\r\n     a military sense, and it has a still deeper political\r\n     significance.\r\n\r\n     \"When General Hunter has scattered 50,000 muskets among the\r\n     negroes of the Carolinas, and General Butler has organized the\r\n     100,000 or 200,000 blacks for whom he may perhaps shortly carry\r\n     arms to New Orleans, the possibility of restoring the Union as it\r\n     was, with slavery again its dormant power, will be seen to have\r\n     finally passed away. The negro is indeed the key to success.\"[99]\r\n\r\nSo here, in the Department of the South, where General Hunter had\r\ndisplayed such admirable military judgment, first, in emancipating the\r\nslave, and second, in arming them; here where the white Union soldiers\r\nand their officers had felt themselves insulted; and where the\r\nPresident had disarmed the 1st regiment of ex-slaves and removed the\r\nofficer who had organized it, a few companies of Negro troops had\r\nfought rebel infantry, cavalry, artillery, and guerillas, and put them\r\nall to flight. They had invaded the enemy's country, made prisoners,\r\nand captured arms and flags; and without committing a single\r\ndepredation. Prejudice gave room to praise, and the exclusive, distant\r\nspirit of white soldiers was converted into the warm and close\r\nadmiration of comradeship. The most sanguine expectations and high\r\nopinions of the advocates of Negro soldiers were more than realized,\r\nwhile the prejudice of Negro haters was disarmed by the flinty logic\r\nand imperishable glory of Negro soldiership.[100]\r\n\r\nEvery Department had its Negro troops by this time; and everywhere the\r\nNegro was solving the problem of his military existence. At Port\r\nHudson in May, 1863, he proved himself worthy of his uniform and the\r\nobject of the most extravagant eulogies from the lips of men who were,\r\nbut a few months before the battle, opposed to Negro soldiers. Mention\r\nhas been made in another chapter of the Colored regiment raised in New\r\nOrleans under General Butler. After remaining in camp from the 7th of\r\nSeptember, 1862, until May, 1863, they were quite efficient in the use\r\nof their arms. The 1st Louisiana regiment was ordered to report to\r\nGeneral Dwight. The regiment was at Baton Rouge. Its commanding\r\nofficer, Colonel Stafford [white], was under arrest when the regiment\r\nwas about ready to go to the front.\r\n\r\nThe line officers assembled at his quarters to assure him that the\r\nregiment would do its duty in the day of battle, and to tender their\r\nregrets that he could not lead them on the field. At this moment the\r\ncolor-guard marched up to receive the regimental flags. Colonel\r\nStafford stepped into his tent and returned with the flags. He made a\r\nspeech full of patriotism and feeling, and concluded by saying:\r\n\"_Color-guard, protect, defend, die for, but do not surrender these\r\nflags!_\" Sergeant Planciancois said: \"Colonel, I will bring back these\r\ncolors to you in honor, or report to God the reason why!\" Noble words\r\nthese, and brave! And no more fitting epitaph could mark the\r\nresting-place of a hero who has laid down his life in defence of human\r\nliberty! A king might well covet these sublime words of the dauntless\r\nPlanciancois!\r\n\r\n\r\nPORT HUDSON.\r\n\r\nIt was a question of grave doubt among white troops as to the fighting\r\nqualities of Negro soldiers. There were various doubts expressed by\r\nthe officers on both sides of the line. The Confederates greeted the\r\nnews that \"niggers\" were to meet them in battle with derision, and\r\ntreated the whole matter as a huge joke. The Federal soldiers were\r\nfilled with amazement and fear as to the issue.\r\n\r\nIt was the determination of the commanding officer at Port Hudson to\r\nassign this Negro regiment to a post of honor and danger. The regiment\r\nmarched all night before the battle of Port Hudson, and arrived at one\r\nDr. Chambers's sugar house on the 27th of May, 1863. It was just 5 A.\r\nM. when the regiment stacked arms. Orders were given to rest and\r\nbreakfast in one hour. The heat was intense and the dust thick, and so\r\nthoroughly fatigued were the men that many sank in their tracks and\r\nslept soundly.\r\n\r\nArrangements were made for a field hospital, and the drum corps\r\ninstructed where to carry the wounded. Officers' call was beaten at\r\n5:30, when they received instructions and encouragement. \"Fall in\" was\r\nsounded at 6 o'clock, and soon thereafter the regiment was on the\r\nmarch. The sun was now shining in his full strength upon the field\r\nwhere a great battle was to be fought. The enemy was in his\r\nstronghold, and his forts were crowned with angry and destructive\r\nguns. The hour to charge had come. It was 7 o'clock. There was a\r\nfeeling of anxiety among the white troops as they watched the\r\nmovements of these Blacks in blue. The latter were anxious for the\r\nfray. At last the command came, \"Forward, double-quick, march!\" and on\r\nthey went over the field of death. Not a musket was heard until the\r\ncommand was within four hundred yards of the enemy's works, when a\r\nblistering fire was opened upon the left wing of the regiment.\r\nUnfortunately Companies A, B, C, D, and E wheeled suddenly by the left\r\nflank. Some confusion followed, but was soon over. A shell--the first\r\nthat fell on the line--killed and wounded about twelve men. The\r\nregiment came to a right about, and fell back for a few hundred yards,\r\nwheeled by companies, and faced the enemy again with the coolness and\r\nmilitary precision of an old regiment on parade. The enemy was busy at\r\nwork now. Grape, canister, shell, and musketry made the air hideous\r\nwith their noise. A masked battery commanded a bluff, and the guns\r\ncould be depressed sufficiently to sweep the entire field over which\r\nthe regiment must charge. It must be remembered that this regiment\r\noccupied the extreme right of the charging line. The masked battery\r\nworked upon the left wing. A three-gun battery was situated in the\r\ncentre, while a half dozen large pieces shelled the right, and\r\nenfiladed the regiment front and rear every time it charged the\r\nbattery on the bluff. A bayou ran under the bluff, immediately in\r\nfront of the guns. It was too deep to be forded by men. These brave\r\nColored soldiers made six desperate charges with indifferent success,\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n    \"Cannon to right of them,\r\n    Cannon to left of them,\r\n    Cannon in front of them\r\n        Volleyed and thundered;\r\n    Stormed at with shot and shell.\"\r\n\r\nThe men behaved splendidly. As their ranks were thinned by shot and\r\ngrape, they closed up into place, and kept a good line. But no matter\r\nwhat high soldierly qualities these men were endowed with, no matter\r\nhow faithfully they obeyed the oft-repeated order to \"charge,\" it was\r\nboth a moral and physical impossibility for these men to cross the\r\ndeep bayou that flowed at their feet--already crimson with patriots'\r\nblood--and capture the battery on the bluff. Colonel Nelson, who\r\ncommanded this black brigade, despatched an orderly to General Dwight,\r\ninforming him that it was not in the nature of things for his men to\r\naccomplish any thing by further charges. \"Tell Colonel Nelson,\" said\r\nGeneral Dwight, \"I shall consider that he has accomplished nothing\r\nunless he takes those guns.\" This last order of General Dwight's will\r\ngo into history as a cruel and unnecessary act. He must have known\r\nthat three regiments of infantry, torn and shattered by about fifteen\r\nor twenty heavy guns, with an impassable bayou encircling the bluff,\r\ncould accomplish nothing by charging. But the men, what could they do?\r\n\r\n    \"Theirs not to make reply,\r\n    Theirs not to reason why,\r\n    Theirs but to do and die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF CAPTAIN ANDRE CALLIOUX.\r\n\r\nAgain the order to charge was given, and the men, worked up to a\r\nfeeling of desperation on account of repeated failures, raised a cry\r\nand made another charge. The ground was covered with dead and wounded.\r\nTrees were felled by shell and solid shot; and at one time a company\r\nwas covered with the branches of a falling tree. Captain Callioux was\r\nin command of Company E, the color company. He was first wounded in\r\nthe left arm--the limb being broken above the elbow. He ran to the\r\nfront of his company, waving his sword and crying, \"Follow me.\" But\r\nwhen within about fifty yards of the enemy he was struck by a shell\r\nand fell dead in front of his company.\r\n\r\nMany Greeks fell defending the pass at Thermopylæ against the Persian\r\narmy, but history has made peculiarly conspicuous Leonidas and his\r\nfour hundred Spartans. In a not distant future, when a calm and\r\ntruthful history of the battle of Port Hudson is written,\r\nnotwithstanding many men fought and died there, the heroism of the\r\n\"Black Captain,\" the accomplished gentleman and fearless soldier,\r\nAndre Callioux, and his faithful followers, will make a most\r\nfascinating picture for future generations to look upon and study.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF COLOR-SERGEANT ANSELMAS PLANCIANCOIS.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, I will bring back these colors to you in honor, or report to\r\nGod the reason why.\" It was now past 11 A.M., May 27, 1863. The men\r\nwere struggling in front of the bluff. The brave Callioux was lying\r\nlifeless upon the field, that was now slippery with gore and crimson\r\nwith blood. The enemy was directing his shell and shot at the flags of\r\nthe First Regiment. A shell, about a six-pounder, struck the\r\nflag-staff, cut it in two, and carried away part of the head of\r\nPlanciancois. He fell, and the flag covered him as a canopy of glory,\r\nand drank of the crimson tide that flowed from his mutilated head.\r\nCorporal Heath caught up the flag, but no sooner had he shouldered the\r\ndear old banner than a musket ball went crashing through his head and\r\nscattered his brains upon the flag, and he, still clinging to it, fell\r\ndead upon the body of Sergeant Planciancois. Another corporal caught\r\nup the banner and bore it through the fight with pride.\r\n\r\nThis was the last charge--the seventh; and what was left of this\r\ngallant Black brigade came back from the hell into which they had\r\nplunged with so much daring and forgetfulness seven times.\r\n\r\nThey did not capture the battery on the bluff it's true, but they\r\nconvinced the white soldiers on both sides that they were both willing\r\nand able to help fight the battles of the Union. And if any person\r\ndoubts the abilities of the Negro as a soldier, let him talk with\r\nGeneral Banks, as we have, and hear \"his golden eloquence on the black\r\nbrigade at Port Hudson.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after the battle a \"New York Times\" correspondent sent the\r\nfollowing account to that journal:\r\n\r\n                      \"BATTLE OF PORT HUDSON.\r\n\r\n     \"In an account of the Battle of Port Hudson, the 'Times'\r\n     correspondent says: 'Hearing the firing apparently more fierce\r\n     and continuous to the right than anywhere else, I hurried in that\r\n     direction, past the sugar house of Colonel Chambers, where I had\r\n     slept, and advanced to near the pontoon bridge across the Big\r\n     Sandy Bayou, which the negro regiments had erected, and where\r\n     they were fighting most desperately. I had seen these brave and\r\n     hitherto despised fellows the day before as I rode along the\r\n     lines, and I had seen General Banks acknowledge their respectful\r\n     salute as he would have done that of any white troops; but still\r\n     the question was--with too many,--\"Will they fight?\" The black\r\n     race was, on this eventful day, to be put to the test, and the\r\n     question to be settled--now and forever,--whether or not they are\r\n     entitled to assert their right to manhood. Nobly, indeed, have\r\n     they acquitted themselves, and proudly may every colored man\r\n     hereafter hold up his head, and point to the record of those who\r\n     fell on that bloody field.\r\n\r\n     \"'General Dwight, at least, must have had the idea, not only that\r\n     they were men, but something _more than men_, from the terrific\r\n     test to which he put their valor. Before any impression had been\r\n     made upon the earthworks of the enemy, and in full face of the\r\n     batteries belching forth their 62 pounders, these devoted people\r\n     rushed forward to encounter grape, canister, shell, and musketry,\r\n     with no artillery but two small howitzers--that seemed mere\r\n     pop-guns to their adversaries--and no reserve whatever.\r\n\r\n     \"'Their force consisted of the 1st. Louisiana Native Guards (with\r\n     colored field-officers) under Lieut.-Colonel Bassett, and the 3d\r\n     Louisiana Native Guards, Colonel Nelson (with white\r\n     field-officers), the whole under command of the latter officer.\r\n\r\n     \"'On going into action they were 1,080 strong, and formed into\r\n     four lines, Lieut.-Colonel Bassett, 1st Louisiana, forming the\r\n     first line, and Lieut.-Colonel Henry Finnegas the second. When\r\n     ordered to charge up the works, they did so with the skill and\r\n     nerve of old veterans, (black people, be it remembered who had\r\n     never been in action before,) but the fire from the rebel guns\r\n     was so terrible upon the unprotected masses, that the first few\r\n     shots mowed them down like grass and so continued.\r\n\r\n     \"'Colonel Bassett being driven back, Colonel Finnegas took his\r\n     place, and his men being similarly cut to pieces, Lieut.-Colonel\r\n     Bassett reformed and recommenced; and thus these brave people\r\n     went in, from morning until 3:30 p.m., under the most hideous\r\n     carnage that men ever had to withstand, and that very few white\r\n     ones would have had nerve to encounter, even if ordered to.\r\n     During this time, they rallied, and _were ordered to make six\r\n     distinct charges_, losing thirty-seven killed, and one hundred\r\n     and fifty-five wounded, and one hundred and sixteen missing,--the\r\n     majority, if not all, of these being, in all probability, now\r\n     lying dead on the gory field, and without the rites of sepulture;\r\n     for when, by flag of truce, our forces in other directions were\r\n     permitted to reclaim their dead, the benefit, through some\r\n     neglect, was not extended to these black regiments.\r\n\r\n     \"'The deeds of heroism performed by these colored men were such\r\n     as the proudest white men might emulate. Their colors are torn to\r\n     pieces by shot, and literally bespattered by blood and brains.\r\n     The color-sergeant of the 1st. La., on being mortally wounded,\r\n     hugged the colors to his breast, when a struggle ensued between\r\n     the two color-corporals on each side of him, as to who should\r\n     have the honor of bearing the sacred standard, and during this\r\n     generous contention one was seriously wounded. One black\r\n     lieutenant actually mounted the enemy's works three or four\r\n     times, and in one charge the assaulting party came within fifty\r\n     paces of them. Indeed, if only ordinarily supported by artillery\r\n     and reserve, no one can convince us that they would not have\r\n     opened a passage through the enemy's works.\r\n\r\n     \"'Capt. Callioux of the 1st. La., a man so black that he actually\r\n     prided himself upon his blackness, died the death of a hero,\r\n     leading on his men in the thickest of the fight. One poor wounded\r\n     fellow came along with his arm shattered by a shell, and jauntily\r\n     swinging it with the other, as he said to a friend of mine:\r\n     \"Massa, guess I can fight no more.\" I was with one of the\r\n     captains, looking after the wounded going in the rear of the\r\n     hospital, when we met one limping along toward the front. On\r\n     being asked where he was going, he said: \"I been shot bad in the\r\n     leg, captain, and dey want me to go to de hospital, but I guess I\r\n     can gib 'em some more yet.\" I could go on filling your columns\r\n     with startling facts of this kind, but I hope I have told enough\r\n     to prove that we can hereafter rely upon black arms as well as\r\n     white in crushing this internal rebellion. I long ago told you\r\n     there was an army of 250,000 men ready to leap forward in defence\r\n     of freedom at the first call.

After dark the main body, being exposed to a flank\r\n     fire, withdrew to a belt of woods, the skirmishers remaining\r\n     close upon the fortifications.\r\n\r\n     \"In the assault of the 27th, the behavior, of the officers and\r\n     men was most gallant, and left nothing to be desired. Our limited\r\n     acquaintance of the ground and the character of the works, which\r\n     were almost hidden from our observation until the moment of\r\n     approach, alone prevented the capture of the post.\r\n\r\n     \"On the extreme right of our line I posted the first and third\r\n     regiments of negro troops. The First regiment of Louisiana\r\n     Engineers, composed exclusively of colored men, excepting the\r\n     officers, was also engaged in the operations of the day. The\r\n     position occupied by these troops was one of importance, and\r\n     called for the utmost steadiness and bravery in those to whom it\r\n     was confided.\r\n\r\n     \"It gives me pleasure to report that they answered every\r\n     expectation. Their conduct was heroic. No troops could be more\r\n     determined or more daring. They made, during the day, three\r\n     charges upon the batteries of the enemy, suffering very heavy\r\n     losses, and holding their position at nightfall with the other\r\n     troops on the right of our line. The highest commendation is\r\n     bestowed upon them by all the officers in command on the right.\r\n     Whatever doubt may have existed before as to the efficiency of\r\n     organizations of this character, the history of this day proves\r\n     conclusively to those who were in a condition to observe the\r\n     conduct of these regiments, that the Government will find in this\r\n     class of troops effective supporters and defenders.\r\n\r\n     \"The severe test to which they were subjected, and the determined\r\n     manner in which they encountered the enemy, leave upon my mind no\r\n     doubt of their ultimate success. They require only good officers,\r\n     commands of limited numbers, and careful discipline, to make them\r\n     excellent soldiers.\r\n\r\n     \"Our losses from the 23d to this date, in killed, wounded, and\r\n     missing, are nearly 1,000, including, I deeply regret to say,\r\n     some of the ablest officers of the corps. I am unable yet to\r\n     report them in detail.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honor to be, with much respect\r\n\r\n                              \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                      \"N.

The hearts of orators\r\nand poets were stirred to elegant utterance. The friends of the Negro\r\nwere encouraged, and their number multiplied. The Colored people\r\nthemselves were jubilant. Mr. George H. Boker, of Philadelphia, the\r\npoet friend of the Negro, wrote the following elegant verses on the\r\ngallant charge of the 1st Louisiana:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK REGIMENT.\r\n\r\nMAY 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE H. BOKER.\r\n\r\n    Dark as the clouds of even,\r\n    Ranked in the western heaven,\r\n    Waiting the breath that lifts\r\n    All the dread mass, and drifts\r\n    Tempest and falling brand\r\n    Over a ruined land;--\r\n    So still and orderly,\r\n    Arm to arm, knee to knee,\r\n    Waiting the great event,\r\n    Stands the black regiment.\r\n\r\n    Down the long dusky line\r\n    Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;\r\n    And the bright bayonet,\r\n    Bristling and firmly set,\r\n    Flashed with a purpose grand,\r\n    Long ere the sharp command\r\n    Of the fierce rolling drum\r\n    Told them their time had come,\r\n    Told them what work was sent\r\n    For the black regiment.\r\n\r\n    \"Now,\" the flag-sergeant cried,\r\n    \"Though death and hell betide,\r\n    Let the whole nation see\r\n    If we are fit to be\r\n    Free in this land; or bound\r\n    Down, like the whining hound--\r\n    Bound with red stripes of pain\r\n    In our old chains again!\"\r\n    Oh! what a shout there went\r\n    From the black regiment!\r\n\r\n    \"Charge!\" Trump and drum awoke,\r\n    Onward the bondmen broke;\r\n    Bayonet and sabre-stroke\r\n    Vainly opposed their rush.\r\n    Through the wild battle's crush,\r\n    With but one thought aflush,\r\n    Driving their lords like chaff,\r\n    In the guns' mouths they laugh;\r\n    Or at the slippery brands\r\n    Leaping with open hands,\r\n    Down they tear man and horse,\r\n    Down in their awful course;\r\n    Trampling with bloody heel\r\n    Over the crashing steel,\r\n    All their eyes forward bent,\r\n    Rushed the black regiment.\r\n\r\n    \"Freedom!\" their battle-cry--\r\n    \"Freedom! or leave to die!\"\r\n    Ah! and they meant the word,\r\n    Not as with us 't is heard,\r\n    Not a mere party-shout:\r\n    They gave their spirits out\r\n    Trusted the end to God,\r\n    And on the gory sod\r\n    Rolled in triumphant blood.\r\n    Glad to strike one free blow,\r\n    Whether for weal or woe;\r\n    Glad to breathe one free breath,\r\n    Though on the lips of death,\r\n    Praying--alas! in vain!--\r\n    That they might fall again,\r\n    So they could once more see\r\n    That burst to liberty!\r\n    This was what \"freedom\" lent\r\n    To the black regiment.\r\n\r\n    Hundreds on hundreds fell;\r\n    But they are resting well;\r\n    Scourges and shackles strong\r\n    Never shall do them wrong.\r\n    Oh, to the living few,\r\n    Soldiers, be just and true!\r\n    Hail them as comrades tried;\r\n    Fight with them side by side;\r\n    Never, in field or tent,\r\n    Scorn the black regiment!\r\n\r\nThe battle of Milliken's Bend was fought on the 6th of June, 1863. The\r\ntroops at this point were under the command of Brig.-Gen. E. S.\r\nDennis. The force consisted of the 23d Iowa, 160 men; 9th La., 500;\r\n11th La., 600; 1st Miss., 150; total, 1,410. Gen. Dennis's report\r\nplaces the number of his troops at 1,061; but evidently a clerical\r\nerror crept into the report. Of the force engaged, 1,250 were Colored,\r\ncomposing the 9th and 11th Louisiana and the 1st Mississippi. The\r\nattacking force comprised six Confederate regiments--about 3,000\r\nmen,--under the command of Gen. Henry McCulloch. This force, coming\r\nfrom the interior of Louisiana, by the way of Richmond, struck the 9th\r\nLouisiana and two companies of Federal cavalry, and drove them within\r\nsight of the earthworks at the Bend. It was now nightfall, and the\r\nenemy rested, hoping and believing himself able to annihilate the\r\nUnion forces on the morrow.\r\n\r\nDuring the night a steamboat passed the Bend, and Gen. Dennis availed\r\nhimself of the opportunity of sending to Admiral Porter for\r\nassistance. The gun-boats, \"Choctaw\" and \"Lexington\" were despatched\r\nto Milliken's Bend from Helena. As the \"Choctaw\" was coming in sight,\r\nat 3 o'clock in the morning, the rebels made their first charge on the\r\nFederal earthworks, filling the air with their vociferous cries: \"No\r\n_quarter!_\" to Negroes and their officers. The Negro troops had just\r\nbeen recruited, and hence knew little or nothing of the manual or use\r\nof arms. But the desperation with which they fought has no equal in\r\nthe annals of modern wars. The enemy charged the works with desperate\r\nfury, but were checked by a deadly fire deliberately delivered by the\r\ntroops within. The enemy fell back and charged the flanks of the Union\r\ncolumns, and, by an enfilading fire, drove them back toward the river,\r\nwhere they sought the protection of the gun-boats. The \"Choctaw\"\r\nopened a broadside upon the exulting foe, and caused him to beat a\r\nhasty retreat. The Negro troops were ordered to charge, and it was\r\nreported by a \"Tribune\" correspondent that many of the Union troops\r\nwere killed before the gun-boats could be signalled to \"_cease\r\nfiring_.\" The following description of the battle was given by an\r\neye-witness of the affair, and a gentleman of exalted character:\r\n\r\n     \"My informant states that a force of about one thousand negroes\r\n     and two hundred men of the Twenty-third Iowa, belonging to the\r\n     Second brigade, Carr's division (the Twenty-third Iowa had been\r\n     up the river with prisoners, and was on its way back to this\r\n     place), was surprised in camp by a rebel force of about two\r\n     thousand men. The first intimation that the commanding officer\r\n     received was from one of the black men, who went into the\r\n     colonel's tent and said: 'Massa, the secesh are in camp.' The\r\n     colonel ordered him to have the men load their guns at once. He\r\n     instantly replied: 'We have done did dat now, massa.' Before the\r\n     colonel was ready, the men were in line, ready for action. As\r\n     before stated, the rebels drove our force toward the gun-boats,\r\n     taking colored men prisoners and murdering them. This so enraged\r\n     them that they rallied and charged the enemy more heroically and\r\n     desperately than has been recorded during the war. It was a\r\n     genuine bayonet charge, a hand-to-hand fight, that has never\r\n     occurred to any extent during this prolonged conflict. Upon both\r\n     sides men were killed with the butts of muskets. White and black\r\n     men were lying side by side, pierced by bayonets, and in some\r\n     instances transfixed to the earth. In one instance, two men, one\r\n     white and the other black, were found dead, side by side, each\r\n     having the other's bayonet through his body. If facts prove to be\r\n     what they are now represented, this engagement of Sunday morning\r\n     will be recorded as the most desperate of this war. Broken limbs,\r\n     broken heads, the mangling of bodies, all prove that it was a\r\n     contest between enraged men: on the one side from hatred to a\r\n     race; and on the other, desire for self-preservation, revenge for\r\n     past grievances and the inhuman murder of their comrades. One\r\n     brave man took his former master prisoner, and brought him into\r\n     camp with great gusto. A rebel prisoner made a particular\r\n     request, that his own negroes should not be placed over him as a\r\n     guard. Dame Fortune is capricious! His request was _not_ granted.\r\n     Their mode of warfare does not entitle them to any privileges. If\r\n     any are granted, it is from magnanimity to a fellow-foe.\r\n\r\n     \"The rebels lost five cannon, two hundred men killed, four\r\n     hundred to five hundred wounded, and about two hundred prisoners.\r\n     Our loss is reported to be one hundred killed and five hundred\r\n     wounded; but few were white men.\"[102]\r\n\r\nMr. G. G. Edwards, who was in the fight, wrote, on the 13th of June:\r\n\r\n     \"Tauntingly it has been said that negroes won't fight. Who say\r\n     it, and who but a dastard and a brute will dare to say it, when\r\n     the battle of Milliken's Bend finds its place among the heroic\r\n     deeds of this war? This battle has significance. It demonstrates\r\n     the fact that the freed slaves will fight.\"\r\n\r\nThe month of July, 1863, was memorable. Gen. Mead had driven Lee from\r\nGettysburg, Grant had captured Vicksburg, Banks had captured Port\r\nHudson, and Gillmore had begun his operations on Morris Island. On the\r\n13th of July the New York Draft Riot broke out. The Democratic press\r\nhad advised the people that they were to be called upon to fight the\r\nbattles of the \"Niggers\" and \"Abolitionists\"; while Gov. Seymour\r\n\"_requested_\" the rioters to await the return of his adjutant-general\r\nwhom he had despatched to Washington to have the President suspend the\r\ndraft. The speech was either cowardly or treasonous. It meant, when\r\nread between the lines, it is unjust for the Government to draft you\r\nmen; I will try and get the Government to rescind its order, and until\r\n_then_ you are respectfully requested to suspend your violent acts\r\nagainst _property_. But the riot went on. When the troops under Gen.\r\nWool took charge of the city, thirteen rioters were killed, eighteen\r\nwounded, and twenty-four made prisoners. The rioters rose ostensibly\r\nto resist the draft, but there were three objects before them:\r\nrobbery, the destruction of the property of the rich sympathizers with\r\nthe Union, and the assassination of Colored persons wherever found.\r\nThey burned the Colored Orphans' Asylum, hung Colored men to lamp\r\nposts, and destroyed the property of this class of citizens with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nDuring these tragic events in New York a gallant Negro regiment was\r\npreparing to lead an assault upon the rebel Fort Wagner on Morris\r\nIsland, South Carolina. On the morning of the 16th of July, 1863, the\r\n54th Massachusetts--first Colored regiment from the North--was\r\ncompelled to fall back upon Gen. Terry from before a strong and fresh\r\nrebel force from Georgia. This was on James Island. The 54th was doing\r\npicket duty, and these early visitors thought to find Terry asleep;\r\nbut instead found him awaiting their coming with all the vigilance of\r\nan old soldier. And in addition to the compliment his troops paid the\r\nenemy, the gunboats \"Pawnee,\" \"Huron,\" \"Marblehead,\" \"John Adams,\" and\r\n\"Mayflower\" paid their warmest respects to the intruders. They soon\r\nwithdrew, having sustained a loss of 200, while Gen. Terry's loss was\r\nonly about 100. It had been arranged to concentrate the Union forces\r\non Morris Island, open a bombardment upon Fort Wagner, and then charge\r\nand take it on the 18th. The troops on James Island were put in motion\r\nto form a junction with the forces already upon Morris Island. The\r\nmarch of the 54th Mass., began on the night of the 16th and continued\r\nuntil the afternoon of the 18th. Through ugly marshes, over swollen\r\nstreams, and broken dykes--through darkness and rain, the regiment\r\nmade its way to Morris Island where it arrived at 6 A.M. of the 18th\r\nof July. The bombardment of Wagner was to have opened at daylight of\r\nthis day; but a terrific storm sweeping over land and sea prevented.\r\nIt was 12:30 P.M. when the thunder of siege guns, batteries, and\r\ngunboats announced the opening of the dance of death. A semicircle of\r\nbatteries, stretching across the island for a half mile, sent their\r\nmessages of destruction into Wagner, while the fleet of iron vessels\r\nbattered down the works of the haughty and impregnable little fort.\r\nAll the afternoon one hundred great guns thundered at the gates of\r\nWagner. Toward the evening the bombardment began to slacken until a\r\ndeath-like stillness ensued. To close this part of the dreadful\r\nprogramme Nature lifted her hoarse and threatening voice, and a severe\r\nthunder-storm broke over the scene. Darkness was coming on. The brave\r\nBlack regiment had reached Gen. Strong's headquarters fatigued,\r\nhungry, and damp. No time could be allowed for refreshments. Col. Shaw\r\nand Gen. Strong addressed the regiment in eloquent, inspiring\r\nlanguage. Line of battle was formed in three brigades. The first was\r\nled by Gen. Strong, consisting of the 54th Massachusetts (Colored),\r\nColonel Robert Gould Shaw; the 6th Connecticut, Col. Chatfield; the\r\n48th New York, Col. Barton; the 3d New Hampshire, Col. Jackson; the\r\n76th Pennsylvania, Col. Strawbridge; and the 9th Maine. The 54th was\r\nthe only regiment of Colored men in the brigade, and to it was\r\nassigned the post of honor and danger in the front of the attacking\r\ncolumn. The shadows of night were gathering thick and fast. Gen.\r\nStrong took his position, and the order to charge was given. On the\r\nbrave Negro regiment swept amid the shot and shell of Sumter,\r\nCumming's Point, and Wagner. Within a few minutes the troops had\r\ndouble-quicked a half mile; and but few had suffered from the heavy\r\nguns; but suddenly a terrific fire of small arms was opened upon the\r\n54th. But with matchless courage the regiment dashed on over the\r\ntrenches and up the side of the fort, upon the top of which Sergt. Wm.\r\nH. Carney planted the colors of the regiment. But the howitzers in the\r\nbastions raked the ditch, and hand-grenades from the parapet tore the\r\nbrave men as they climbed the battle-scarred face of the fort. Here\r\nwaves the flag of a Northern Negro regiment; and here its brave,\r\nbeautiful, talented young colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, was saluted by\r\ndeath and kissed by immortality! Gen. Strong received a mortal wound,\r\nwhile Col. Chatfield and many other heroic officers yielded a full\r\nmeasure of devotion to the cause of the Union. Three other colonels\r\nwere wounded,--Barton, Green, and Jackson. The shattered brigade\r\nstaggered back into line under the command of Major Plympton, of the\r\n3d New Hampshire, while the noble 54th retired in care of Lieutenant\r\nFrancis L. Higginson. The second brigade, composed of the 7th New\r\nHampshire, Col. H. S. Putnam; 626 Ohio, Col. Steele; 67th Ohio, Col.\r\nVorhees; and the 100th New York, under Col. Danby, was led against the\r\nfort, by Col. Putnam, who was killed in the assault. So this brigade\r\nwas compelled to retire. One thousand and five hundred (1,500) men\r\nwere thrown away in this fight, but one fact was clearly established,\r\nthat Negroes could and would fight as bravely as white men. The\r\nfollowing letter, addressed to the Military Secretary of Gov. Andrew,\r\nof Massachusetts, narrates an instance of heroism in a Negro soldier\r\nwhich deserves to go into history:\r\n\r\n                              \"HEADQUARTERS 54TH MASSACHUSETTS VOLS. }\r\n                              \"MORRIS ISLAND, S. C., Oct. 15, 1863.  }\r\n\r\n     \"COLONEL: I have the honor to forward you the following letter,\r\n     received a few days since from Sergeant W. H. Carney, Company C,\r\n     of this regiment. Mention has before been made of his heroic\r\n     conduct in preserving the American flag and bearing it from the\r\n     field, in the assault on Fort Wagner on the 18th of July last,\r\n     but that you may have the history complete, I send a simple\r\n     statement of the facts as I have obtained them from him, and an\r\n     officer who was an eye-witness:\r\n\r\n     \"When the Sergeant arrived to within about one hundred yards of\r\n     the fort--he was with the first battalion, which was in the\r\n     advance of the storming column--he received the regimental\r\n     colors, pressed forward to the front rank, near the Colonel, who\r\n     was leading the men over the ditch. He says, as they ascended the\r\n     wall of the fort, the ranks were full, but as soon as they\r\n     reached the top, 'they melted away' before the enemy's fire\r\n     'almost instantly.' He received a severe wound in the thigh, but\r\n     fell only upon his knees. He planted the flag upon the parapet,\r\n     lay down on the outer slope, that he might get as much shelter as\r\n     possible; there he remained for over half an hour, till the 2d\r\n     brigade came up. He kept the colors flying until the second\r\n     conflict was ended. When our forces retired he followed, creeping\r\n     on one knee, still holding up the flag. It was thus that Sergeant\r\n     Carney came from the field, having held the emblem of liberty\r\n     over the walls of Fort Wagner during the sanguinary conflict of\r\n     the two brigades, and having received two very severe wounds, one\r\n     in the thigh and one in the head. Still he refused to give up his\r\n     sacred trust until he found an officer of his regiment.\r\n\r\n     \"When he entered the field hospital, where his wounded comrades\r\n     were being brought in, they cheered him and the colors. Though\r\n     nearly exhausted with the loss of blood, he said: 'Boys, the old\r\n     flag never touched the ground.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of him as a man and soldier, I can speak in the highest term of\r\n     praise.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honor to be, Colonel, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                         \"Your most obedient servant,\r\n                              \"M.

Andrew, Mass._\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural that Massachusetts should feel a deep interest in her\r\nNegro regiment: for it was an experiment; and the fair name of the Old\r\nBay State had been committed to its keeping. Edward L. Pierce gave the\r\nfollowing account of the regiment to Gov. John A. Andrew:\r\n\r\n                                        \"BEAUFORT, July 22, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR: You will probably receive an official report of the\r\n     losses in the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts by the mail which leaves\r\n     to-morrow, but perhaps a word from me may not be unwelcome. I saw\r\n     the officers and men on James Island on the thirteenth instant,\r\n     and on Saturday last saw them at Brigadier-General Strong's tent,\r\n     as they passed on at six or half-past six in the evening to Fort\r\n     Wagner, which is some two miles beyond. I had been the guest of\r\n     General Strong, who commanded the advance since Tuesday. Colonel\r\n     Shaw had become attached to General Strong at St. Helena, where\r\n     he was under him, and the regard was mutual. When the troops left\r\n     St. Helena they were separated, the Fifty-fourth going to James\r\n     Island. While it was there, General Strong received a letter from\r\n     Colonel Shaw, in which the desire was expressed for the transfer\r\n     of the Fifty-fourth to General Strong's brigade. So when the\r\n     troops were brought away from James Island, General Strong took\r\n     this regiment into his command. It left James Island on Thursday,\r\n     July sixteenth, at nine P.M., and marched to Cole's Island, which\r\n     they reached at four o'clock on Friday morning, marching all\r\n     night, most of the way in single file over swampy and muddy\r\n     ground. There they remained during the day, with hard-tack and\r\n     coffee for their fare, and this only what was left in their\r\n     haversacks; not a regular ration. From eleven o'clock of Friday\r\n     evening until four o'clock of Saturday they were being put on the\r\n     transport, the General Hunter, in a boat which took about fifty\r\n     at a time. There they breakfasted on the same fare, and had no\r\n     other food before entering into the assault on Fort Wagner in the\r\n     evening.\r\n\r\n     \"The General Hunter left Cole's Island for Folly Island at six\r\n     A.M., and the troops landed at the Pawnee Landing about half-past\r\n     nine A.M., and thence marched to the point opposite Morris\r\n     Island, reaching there about two o'clock in the afternoon. They\r\n     were transported in a steamer across the inlet, and at five P.M.\r\n     began their march for Fort Wagner. They reached Brigadier-General\r\n     Strong's quarters, about midway on the island, about six or\r\n     half-past six, where they halted for five minutes. I saw them\r\n     here, and they looked worn and weary.\r\n\r\n     \"General Strong expressed a great desire to give them food and\r\n     stimulants, but it was too late, as they were to lead the charge.\r\n     They had been without tents during the pelting rains of Thursday\r\n     and Friday nights. General Strong had been impressed with the\r\n     high character of the regiment and its officers, and he wished to\r\n     assign them the post where the most severe work was to be done,\r\n     and the highest honor was to be won. I had been his guest for\r\n     some days, and knew how he regarded them. The march across Folly\r\n     and Morris Islands was over a very sandy road, and was very\r\n     wearisome. The regiment went through the centre of the island,\r\n     and not along the beach where the marching was easier. When they\r\n     had come within about one thousand six hundred yards of Fort\r\n     Wagner, they halted and formed in line of battle--the Colonel\r\n     leading the right and the Lieutenant-Colonel the left wing. They\r\n     then marched four hundred yards further on and halted again.\r\n     There was little firing from the enemy at this point, one solid\r\n     shot falling between the wings, and another falling to the right,\r\n     but no musketry.\r\n\r\n     \"At this point the regiment, together with the next supporting\r\n     regiments, the Sixth Connecticut, Ninth Maine, and others,\r\n     remained half an hour. The regiment was addressed by General\r\n     Strong and Colonel Shaw. Then at half-past seven or a quarter\r\n     before eight o'clock the order for the charge was given. The\r\n     regiment advanced at quick time, changed to double-quick when at\r\n     some distance on. The intervening distance between the place\r\n     where the line was formed and the Fort was run over in a few\r\n     minutes. When within one or two hundred yards of the Fort, a\r\n     terrific fire of grape and musketry was poured upon them along\r\n     the entire line, and with deadly results. It tore the ranks to\r\n     pieces and disconcerted some. They rallied again, went through\r\n     the ditch, in which were some three feet of water, and then up\r\n     the parapet. They raised the flag on the parapet, where it\r\n     remained for a few minutes. Here they melted away before the\r\n     enemy's fire, their bodies falling down the slope and into the\r\n     ditch. Others will give a more detailed and accurate account of\r\n     what occurred during the rest of the conflict.\r\n\r\n     \"Colonel Shaw reached the parapet, leading his men, and was\r\n     probably killed. Adjutant James saw him fall. Private Thomas\r\n     Burgess, of Company I, told me that he was close to Colonel Shaw;\r\n     that he waved his sword and cried out: 'Onward, boys!' and, as he\r\n     did so, fell. Burgess fell, wounded, at the same time. In a\r\n     minute or two, as he rose to crawl away, he tried to pull Colonel\r\n     Shaw along, taking hold of his feet, which were near his own\r\n     head, but there appeared to be no life in him. There is a report,\r\n     however, that Colonel Shaw is wounded and a prisoner, and that it\r\n     was so stated to the officers who bore a flag of truce from us,\r\n     but I cannot find it well authenticated. It is most likely that\r\n     this noble youth has given his life to his country and to\r\n     mankind. Brigadier-General Strong (himself a kindred spirit) said\r\n     of him to-day, in a message to his parents: 'I had but little\r\n     opportunity to be with him, but I already loved him. No man ever\r\n     went more gallantly into battle. None knew but to love him.' I\r\n     parted with Colonel Shaw between six and seven, Saturday evening,\r\n     as he rode forward to his regiment, and he gave me the private\r\n     letters and papers he had with him, to be delivered to his\r\n     father. Of the other officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Hallowell is\r\n     severely wounded in the groin; Adjutant James has a wound from a\r\n     grape-shot in his ankle, and a flesh-wound in his side from a\r\n     glancing ball or piece of shell. Captain Pope has had a\r\n     musket-ball extracted from his shoulder. Captain Appleton is\r\n     wounded in the thumb, and also has a contusion on his right\r\n     breast from a hand-grenade. Captain Willard has a wound in the\r\n     leg, and is doing well. Captain Jones was wounded in the right\r\n     shoulder. The ball went through and he is doing well. Lieutenant\r\n     Homans wounded by a ball from a smooth-bore musket entering the\r\n     left side, which has been extracted from the back. He is doing\r\n     well.\r\n\r\n     \"The above-named officers are at Beaufort, all but the last\r\n     arriving there on Sunday evening, whither they were taken from\r\n     Morris Island to Pawnee Landing, in the Alice Price, and thence\r\n     to Beaufort in the Cosmopolitan, which is specially fitted up for\r\n     hospital service and is provided with skilful surgeons under the\r\n     direction of Dr. Bontecou. They are now tenderly cared for with\r\n     an adequate corps of surgeons and nurses, and provided with a\r\n     plentiful supply of ice, beef and chicken broth, and stimulants.\r\n     Lieutenant Smith was left at the hospital tent on Morris Island.\r\n     Captain Emilio and Lieutenants Grace, Appleton, Johnston, Reed,\r\n     Howard, Dexter, Jennison, and Emerson, were not wounded and are\r\n     doing duty. Lieutenants Jewett and Tucker were slightly wounded\r\n     and are doing duty also. Lieut. Pratt was wounded and came in\r\n     from the field on the following day. Captains Russell and\r\n     Simpkins are missing. The Quartermaster and Surgeon are safe and\r\n     are with the regiment.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Stone remained on the Alice Price during Saturday night,\r\n     caring for the wounded until she left Morris Island, and then\r\n     returned to look after those who were left behind. The Assistant\r\n     Surgeon was at the camp on St. Helena Island, attending to duty\r\n     there. Lieutenant Littlefield was also in charge of the camp at\r\n     St. Helena. Lieutenant Higginson was on Folly Island with a\r\n     detail of eighty men. Captain Bridge and Lieutenant Walton are\r\n     sick and were at Beaufort or vicinity. Captain Partridge has\r\n     returned from the North, but not in time to participate in the\r\n     action.\r\n\r\n     \"Of the privates and non-commissioned officers I send you a list\r\n     of one hundred and forty-four who are now in the Beaufort\r\n     hospitals. A few others died on the boats or since their arrival\r\n     here. There may be others at the Hilton Head Hospital; and others\r\n     are doubtless on Morris Island; but I have no names or statistics\r\n     relative to them. Those in Beaufort are well attended to--just as\r\n     well as the white soldiers, the attentions of the surgeons and\r\n     nurses being supplemented by those of the colored people here,\r\n     who have shown a great interest in them. The men of the regiment\r\n     are very patient, and where their condition at all permits them,\r\n     are cheerful. They express their readiness to meet the enemy\r\n     again, and they keep asking if Wagner is yet taken. Could any one\r\n     from the North see these brave fellows as they lie here, his\r\n     prejudice against them, if he had any, would all pass away. They\r\n     grieve greatly at the loss of Colonel Shaw, who seems to have\r\n     acquired a strong hold on their affections. They are attached to\r\n     their other officers, and admire General Strong, whose courage\r\n     was so conspicuous to all. I asked General Strong if he had any\r\n     testimony in relation to the regiment to be communicated to you.\r\n     These are his precise words, and I give them to you as I noted\r\n     them at the time:\r\n\r\n     \"'The Fifty-fourth did well and nobly, only the fall of Colonel\r\n     Shaw prevented them from entering the Fort. They moved up as\r\n     gallantly as any troops could, and with their enthusiasm they\r\n     deserve a better fate.' The regiment could not have been under a\r\n     better officer than Colonel Shaw. He is one of the bravest and\r\n     most genuine men. His soldiers loved him like a brother, and go\r\n     where you would through the camps you would hear them speak of\r\n     him with enthusiasm and affection. His wound is severe, and there\r\n     are some apprehensions as to his being able to recover from it.\r\n     Since I found him at the hospital tent on Morris Island, about\r\n     half-past nine o'clock on Saturday, I have been all the time\r\n     attending to him or the officers of the Fifty-fourth, both on the\r\n     boats and here. Nobler spirits it has never been my fortune to\r\n     be with. General Strong, as he lay on the stretcher in the tent,\r\n     was grieving all the while for the poor fellows who lay uncared\r\n     for on the battle-field, and the officers of the Fifty-fourth\r\n     have had nothing to say of their own misfortunes, but have\r\n     mourned constantly for the hero who led them to the charge from\r\n     which he did not return. I remember well the beautiful day when\r\n     the flags were presented at Readville, and you told the regiment\r\n     that your reputation was to be identified with its fame. It was a\r\n     day of festivity and cheer. I walk now in these hospitals and see\r\n     mutilated forms with every variety of wound, and it seems all a\r\n     dream. But well has the regiment sustained the hope which you\r\n     indulged, and justified the identity of fame which you trusted to\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"I ought to add in relation to the fight on James Island, on July\r\n     sixteenth, in which the regiment lost fifty men, driving back the\r\n     rebels, and saving, as it is stated, three companies of the Tenth\r\n     Connecticut, that General Terry, who was in command on that\r\n     Island, said to Adjutant James:\r\n\r\n     \"'Tell your Colonel that I am exceedingly pleased with the\r\n     conduct of your regiment. They have done all they could do.'\r\n\r\n                                   \"Yours truly,\r\n                                      \"EDWARD L. PIERCE.\"[103]\r\n\r\nThe Negro in the Mississippi Valley, and in the Department of the\r\nSouth had won an excellent reputation as a soldier. In the spring of\r\n1864 Colored Troops made their _début_ in the army of the Potomac. In\r\nthe battles at Wilson's Wharf, Petersburg, Deep Bottom, Chapin's Farm,\r\nFair Oaks, Hatcher's Run, Farmville, and many other battles, these\r\nsoldiers won for themselves lasting glory and golden opinions from the\r\nofficers and men of the white organizations. On the 24th of May, 1864,\r\nGen. Fitz-Hugh Lee called at Wilson's Wharf to pay his respects to two\r\nNegro regiments under the command of Gen. Wild. But the chivalry of\r\nthe South were compelled to retire before the destructive fire of\r\nNegro soldiers. A \"Tribune\" correspondent who witnessed the engagement\r\ngave the following account the next day:\r\n\r\n     \"At first the fight raged fiercely on the left. The woods were\r\n     riddled with bullets; the dead and wounded of the rebels were\r\n     taken away from this part of the field, but I am informed by one\r\n     accustomed to judge, and who went over the field to-day, that\r\n     from the pools of blood and other evidences the loss must have\r\n     been severe. Finding that the left could not be broken, Fitz-Hugh\r\n     Lee hurled his chivalry--dismounted of course--upon the right.\r\n     Steadily they came on, through obstructions, through slashing,\r\n     past abattis without wavering. Here _one_ of the advantages of\r\n     colored troops was made apparent. They obeyed orders, and bided\r\n     their time. When well tangled in the abattis the death-warrant,\r\n     'Fire,' went forth. Southern chivalry quailed before Northern\r\n     balls, though fired by negro hands. Volley after volley was\r\n     rained upon the superior by the inferior race, and the chivalry\r\n     broke and tried to run.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June Gen. Gillmore, at the head of 3,500 troops, crossed\r\nthe Appomattox, and moved on Petersburg by turnpike from the north.\r\nGen. Kautz, with about 1,500 cavalry, was to charge the city from the\r\nsouth, or southwest; and two gun-boats and a battery were to bombard\r\nFort Clinton, defending the approach up the river. Gillmore was\r\nsomewhat dismayed at the formidable appearance of the enemy, and,\r\nthinking himself authorized to use his own discretion, did not make an\r\nattack. On the 10th of June, Gen. Kautz advanced without meeting any\r\nserious resistance until within a mile and one half of the city, drove\r\nin the pickets and actually entered the city! Gillmore had attracted\r\nconsiderable attention on account of the display he made of his\r\nforces; but when he declined to fight, the rebels turned upon Kautz\r\nand drove him out of the city.\r\n\r\nGen. Grant had taken up his headquarters at Bermuda Hundreds, whence\r\nhe directed Gen. Butler to despatch Gen. W. F. Smith's corps against\r\nPetersburg. The rebel general, A. P. Hill, commanding the rear of\r\nLee's army, was now on the south front of Richmond. Gen. Smith moved\r\non toward Petersburg, and at noon of the 15th of June, 1864, his\r\nadvance felt the outposts of the enemy's defence about two and one\r\nhalf miles from the river. Here again the Negro soldier's fighting\r\nqualities were to be tested in the presence of our white troops. Gen.\r\nHinks commanded a brigade of Negro soldiers. This brigade was to open\r\nthe battle and receive the fresh fire of the enemy. Gen. Hinks--a most\r\ngallant soldier--took his place and gave the order to charge the rebel\r\nlines. Here under a clear Virginia sky, in full view of the Union\r\nwhite troops, the Black brigade swept across the field in magnificent\r\nline. The rebels received them with siege gun, musket, and bayonet,\r\nbut they never wavered. In a short time they had carried a line of\r\nrifle-pits, driven the enemy out in confusion, and captured two large\r\nguns. It was a supreme moment; all that was needed was the order, \"On\r\nto Petersburg,\" and the city could have been taken by the force there\r\nwas in reserve for the Black brigade. But he who doubts is damned, and\r\nhe who dallies is a dastard. Gen. Smith hesitated. Another assault was\r\nnot ordered until near sundown, when the troops cleared another line\r\nof rifle-pits, made three hundred prisoners, and captured sixteen\r\nguns, sustaining a loss of only six hundred. The night was clear and\r\nbalmy; there was nothing to hinder the battle from being carried on;\r\nbut Gen. Smith halted for the night--a fatal halt. During the night\r\nthe enemy was reënforced by the flower of Lee's army, and when the\r\nsunlight of the next morning fell upon the battle field it revealed an\r\nalmost new army,--a desperate and determined enemy. Then it seems that\r\nGens. Meade and Hancock did not know that Petersburg was to be\r\nattacked. Hancock's corps had lingered in the rear of the entire army,\r\nand did not reach the front until dusk. Why Gen. Smith delayed the\r\nassault until evening was not known. Even Gen. Grant, in his report of\r\nthe battle, said: \"Smith, for some reason that I have never been able\r\nto satisfactorily understand, did not get ready to assault the enemy's\r\nmain lines until near sundown.\" But whatever the reason was, his\r\nconduct cost many a noble life and the postponement of the end of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June, 1864, Gens. Burnside and Warren came up. The 18th\r\ncorps, under Gen. Smith, occupied the right of the Federal lines, with\r\nits right touching the Appomattox River. Gens. Hancock, Burnside, and\r\nWarren stretched away to the extreme left, which was covered by\r\nKautz's cavalry. After a consultation with Gen. Grant, Gen. Meade\r\nordered a general attack all along the lines, and at 6 P.M. on the\r\n16th of June, the battle of Petersburg was opened again. Once more a\r\ndivision of Black troops was hurled into the fires of battle, and once\r\nmore proved that the Negro was equal to all the sudden and startling\r\nchanges of war. The splendid fighting of these troops awakened the\r\nkindliest feelings for them among the white troops, justified the\r\nGovernment in employing them, stirred the North to unbounded\r\nenthusiasm, and made the rebel army feel that the Negro was the equal\r\nof the Confederate soldier under all circumstances. Secretary Stanton\r\nwas in a state of ecstasy over the behavior of the Colored troops at\r\nPetersburg, an unusual thing for him. In his despatch on this battle,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n     \"The hardest fighting was done by the black troops. The forts\r\n     they stormed were the worst of all. After the affair was over\r\n     Gen. Smith went to thank them, and tell them he was proud of\r\n     their courage and dash. He says they cannot be exceeded as\r\n     soldiers, and that hereafter he will send them in a difficult\r\n     place as readily as the best white troops.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThe \"Tribune\" correspondent wrote on the day of the battle:\r\n\r\n     \"The charge upon the advanced works was made in splendid style;\r\n     and as the 'dusky warriors' stood shouting upon the parapet, Gen.\r\n     Smith decided that 'they would do,' and sent word to storm the\r\n     first redoubt. Steadily these troops moved on, led by officers\r\n     whose unostentatious bravery is worthy of emulation. With a shout\r\n     and rousing cheers they dashed at the redoubt. Grape and canister\r\n     were hurled at them by the infuriated rebels. They grinned and\r\n     pushed on, and with a yell that told the Southern chivalry their\r\n     doom, rolled irresistibly over and into the work. The guns were\r\n     speedily turned upon those of our 'misguided brethren,' who\r\n     forgot that discretion was the better part of valor. Another\r\n     redoubt was carried in the same splendid style, and the negroes\r\n     have established a reputation that they will surely maintain.\r\n\r\n     \"Officers on Gen. Hancock's staff, as they rode by the redoubt,\r\n     surrounded by a moat with water in it, over which these negroes\r\n     charged, admitted that its capture was a most gallant affair. The\r\n     negroes bear their wounds quite as pluckily as the white\r\n     soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Colored Troops remained, skirmishing, fighting, building\r\nearthworks, and making ready for the next assault upon Petersburg,\r\nwhich was to take place on the 30th proximo. In the actions of the\r\n18th, 21st, 23d, 24th, 25th, and 28th of June, the Colored Troops had\r\nshared a distinguished part. The following letter on the conduct of\r\nthe Colored Troops before Petersburg, written by an officer who\r\nparticipated in all the actions around that city, is worth its space\r\nit gold:\r\n\r\n                         \"IN THE FIELD, NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA, }\r\n                                  \"June 27, 1864.                  }\r\n\r\n     \"The problem is solved. The negro is a man, a soldier, a hero.\r\n     Knowing of your laudable interest in the colored troops, but\r\n     particularly those raised under the immediate auspices of the\r\n     Supervisory Committee, I have thought it proper that I should\r\n     let you know how they acquitted themselves in the late actions in\r\n     front of Petersburg, of which you have already received newspaper\r\n     accounts. If you remember, in my conversations upon the character\r\n     of these troops, I carefully avoided saying anything about their\r\n     fighting qualities till I could have an opportunity of trying\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"That opportunity came on the fifteenth instant, and since, and I\r\n     am now prepared to say that I never, since the beginning of this\r\n     war, saw troops fight better, more bravely, and with more\r\n     determination and enthusiasm. Our division, commanded by General\r\n     Hinks, took the advance on the morning of the fifteenth instant,\r\n     arrived in front of the enemy's works about nine o'clock A.M.,\r\n     formed line, charged them, and took them most handsomely. Our\r\n     regiment was the first in the enemy's works, having better ground\r\n     to charge over than some of the others, and the only gun that was\r\n     taken on this first line was taken by our men. The color-sergeant\r\n     of our regiment planted his colors on the works of the enemy, a\r\n     rod in advance of any officer or man in the regiment. The effect\r\n     of the colors being thus in advance of the line, so as to be seen\r\n     by all, was truly inspiring to our men, and to a corresponding\r\n     degree dispiriting to the enemy. We pushed on two and a half\r\n     miles further, till we came in full view of the main defences of\r\n     Petersburg. We formed line at about two o'clock P.M.,\r\n     reconnoitred and skirmished the whole afternoon, and were\r\n     constantly subject to the shells of the enemy's artillery. At\r\n     sunset we charged these strong works and carried them. Major Cook\r\n     took one with the left wing of our regiment as skirmishers, by\r\n     getting under the guns, and then preventing their gunners from\r\n     using their pieces, while he gained the rear of the redoubt,\r\n     where there was no defence but the infantry, which, classically\r\n     speaking, 'skedaddled.' We charged across what appeared to be an\r\n     almost impassable ravine, with the right wing all the time\r\n     subject to a hot fire of grape and canister, until we got so far\r\n     under the guns as to be sheltered, when the enemy took to their\r\n     rifle-pits as infantrymen. Our brave fellows went steadily\r\n     through the swamp, and up the side of a hill, at an angle of\r\n     almost fifty degrees, rendered nearly impassable by fallen\r\n     timber. Here again our color-sergeant was conspicuous in keeping\r\n     far ahead of the most advanced, hanging on to the side of the\r\n     hill, till he would turn about and wave the stars and stripes at\r\n     his advancing comrades; then steadily advancing again, under the\r\n     fire of the enemy, till he could almost have reached their\r\n     rifle-pits with his flagstaff. How he kept from being killed I do\r\n     not know, unless it can be attributed to the fact that the party\r\n     advancing up the side of the hill always has the advantage of\r\n     those who hold the crest. It was in this way that we got such\r\n     decided advantage over the enemy at South Mountain. We took, in\r\n     these two redoubts, four more guns, making, in all, five for our\r\n     regiment, two redoubts, and part of a rifle-pit as our day's\r\n     work. The Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh United States colored troops\r\n     advanced against works more to the left. The Fourth United States\r\n     colored troops took one more redoubt, and the enemy abandoned the\r\n     other. In these two we got two more guns, which made, in all,\r\n     seven. The Sixth regiment did not get up in time, unfortunately,\r\n     to have much of the sport, as it had been previously formed in\r\n     the second line. We left forty-three men wounded and eleven\r\n     killed in the ravine, over which our men charged the last time.\r\n     Our loss in the whole day's operations was one hundred-and\r\n     forty-three, including six officers, one of whom was killed. Sir,\r\n     there is no underrating the good conduct of these fellows during\r\n     these charges; with but a few exceptions, they all went in as old\r\n     soldiers, but with more enthusiasm. I am delighted that our first\r\n     action resulted in a decided victory.\r\n\r\n     \"The commendations we have received from the Army of the Potomac,\r\n     including its general officers, are truly gratifying. Hancock's\r\n     corps arrived just in time to relieve us (we being out of\r\n     ammunition), before the rebels were reinforced and attempted to\r\n     retake these strong works and commanding positions, without which\r\n     they could not hold Petersburg one hour, if it were a part of\r\n     Grant's plan to advance against it on the right here.\r\n\r\n     \"General Smith speaks in the highest terms of the day's work, as\r\n     you have doubtless seen, and he assured me, in person, that our\r\n     division should have the guns we took as trophies of honor. He is\r\n     also making his word good in saying that he could hereafter trust\r\n     colored troops in the most responsible positions. Colonel Ames,\r\n     of the Sixth United States colored troops, and our regiment, have\r\n     just been relieved in the front, where we served our tour of\r\n     forty-eight hours in turn with the other troops of the corps.\r\n     While out, we were subjected to some of the severest shelling I\r\n     have ever seen, Malvern Hill not excepted. The enemy got twenty\r\n     guns in position during the night, and opened on us yesterday\r\n     morning at daylight. Our men stood it, behind their works, of\r\n     course, as well as any of the white troops. Our men,\r\n     unfortunately, owing to the irregular features of ground, took no\r\n     prisoners. Sir, we can bayonet the enemy to terms on this matter\r\n     of treating colored soldiers as prisoners of war far sooner than\r\n     the authorities at Washington can bring him to it by negotiation.\r\n     This I am morally persuaded of. I know, further, that the enemy\r\n     won't fight us if he can help it. I am sure that the same number\r\n     of white troops could not have taken those works on the evening\r\n     of the fifteenth; prisoners that we took told me so. I mean\r\n     prisoners who came in after the abandonment of the fort, because\r\n     they could not get away. They excuse themselves on the ground of\r\n     pride; as one of them said to me: 'D----d if men educated as we\r\n     have been will fight with niggers, and your government ought not\r\n     to expect it.' The real fact is, the rebels will not stand\r\n     against our colored soldiers when there is any chance of their\r\n     being taken prisoners, for they are conscious of what they justly\r\n     deserve. Our men went into these works after they were taken,\r\n     yelling 'Fort Pillow!' The enemy well knows what this means, and\r\n     I will venture the assertion, that that piece of infernal\r\n     brutality enforced by them there has cost the enemy already two\r\n     men for every one they so inhumanly murdered.\"[105]\r\n\r\nThe 9th corps, under Burnside, containing a splendid brigade of\r\nColored Troops, had finally pushed its way up to one hundred and fifty\r\nyards of the enemy's works. In the immediate front a small fort\r\nprojected out quite a distance beyond the main line of the enemy's\r\nworks. It was decided to place a mine under this fort and destroy it.\r\nJust in the rear of the 9th corps was a ravine, which furnished a safe\r\nand unobserved starting-point for the mine. It was pushed forward with\r\ngreat speed and care. When the point was reached directly under the\r\nfort, chambers were made to the right and left, and then packed with\r\npowder or other combustibles. It was understood from the commencement\r\nthat the Colored Troops were to have the post of honor again, and\r\ncharge after the mine should be sprung. The inspecting officer having\r\nmade a thorough examination of the entire works reported to Gen.\r\nBurnside that the \"Black Division was the fittest for this perilous\r\nservice.\" But Gen. Grant was not of the same opinion. Right on the eve\r\nof the great event he directed the three white commanders of divisions\r\nto _draw lots_--who should _not_ go into the crater! The lot fell to\r\nthe poorest officer, for a dashing, brilliant movement, in the entire\r\narmy; Gen. Ledlie.\r\n\r\nThe mine was to be fired at 3:30 A.M., on the morning of the 30th of\r\nJuly, 1864. The match was applied, but the train did not work. Lieut.\r\nJacob Douty and Sergt. Henry Rees, of the 48th Pennsylvania, entered\r\nthe gallery, removed the hindering cause, and at 4:45 A.M. the match\r\nwas applied and the explosion took place. The fort was lifted into the\r\nair and came down a mass of ruins, burying 300 men. Instead of a fort\r\nthere was a yawning chasm, 150 feet long, 25 feet wide, and about 25\r\nor 30 feet deep. At the same moment all the guns of the Union forces\r\nopened from one end of their line to the other. It was verily a\r\njudgment morn. Confusion reigned among the Confederates. The enemy\r\nfled in disorder from his works. The way to Petersburg was open,\r\nunobstructed for several hours; all the Federal troops had to do was\r\nto go into the city at a trail arms without firing a gun. Gen. Ledlie\r\nwas not equal to the situation. He tried to mass his division in the\r\nmouth of the crater. The 10th New Hampshire went timidly into line,\r\nand when moved forward broke into the shape of a letter V, and\r\nconfusion indescribable followed. Gens. Potter and Wilcox tried to\r\nsupport Ledlie, but the latter division had halted after they had\r\nentered the crater, although the enemy had not recovered from the\r\nshock. Gen. Potter, by _some_ means, got his division out of the\r\ncrater and gallantly led a charge toward the crest, but so few\r\nfollowed him that he was compelled to retire. After all had been lost,\r\nafter the rebels had regained their composure, Gen. Burnside was\r\n_suffered_ to send in his \"Black Division.\" It charged in splendid\r\norder to the right of the crater toward the crest, but was hurled back\r\ninto the crater by a destructive fire from batteries and muskets. But\r\nthey rallied and charged the enemy again and again until nightfall;\r\nexhausted and reduced in numbers, they fell back into the friendly\r\ndarkness to rest. The Union loss was 4,400 killed, wounded, and\r\ncaptured. Again the Negro had honored his country and covered himself\r\nwith glory. Managed differently, with the Black Division as the\r\ncharging force, Petersburg would have fallen, the war would have ended\r\nbefore the autumn, and thousands of lives would have been saved. But a\r\ngreat sacrifice had to be laid upon the cruel altar of race prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn the battles around Nashville about 8,000 or 10,000 Colored Troops\r\ntook part, and rendered efficient aid. Here the Colored Troops, all of\r\nthem recruited from slave States, stormed fortified positions of the\r\nenemy with the bayonet through open fields, and behaved like veterans\r\nunder the most destructive fire. In his report of the battle of\r\nNashville, Major-Gen. James B. Steedman said:\r\n\r\n     \"The larger portion of these losses, amounting in the aggregate\r\n     to fully twenty-five per cent. of the men under my command who\r\n     were taken into action, it will be observed, fell upon the\r\n     Colored Troops. The severe loss of this part of my troops was in\r\n     the brilliant charge on the enemy's works on Overton Hill on\r\n     Friday afternoon. I was unable to discover that _color_ made any\r\n     difference in the fighting of my troops. All, white and black,\r\n     nobly did their duty as soldiers, and evinced cheerfulness and\r\n     resolution, such as I have never seen excelled in any campaign of\r\n     the war in which I have borne a part.\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the losses in this action:\r\n\r\n -------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------\r\n                    | Killed.|Wounded.|Missing.| Total. |\r\n                    |--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                    |Officers|Officers|Officers|Officers|\r\n                    |  | Men |   | Men|   | Men|  | Men |\r\n -------------------+--+-----+---+----+---+----+--+-----+-----------------\r\n Fourteenth U.

The following letter speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n                  ADJ.-GEN. THOMAS ON NEGRO SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n                              \"WAR DEP'T, ADJ.-GENERAL'S OFFICE, }\r\n                              \"WASHINGTON, May 30, 1864.         }\r\n\r\n     \"Hon. H. WILSON:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR: On several occasions when on the Mississippi River, I\r\n     contemplated writing to you respecting the colored troops and to\r\n     suggest that, as they have been fully tested as soldiers, their\r\n     pay should be raised to that of white troops, and I desire now to\r\n     give my testimony in their behalf. You are aware that I have been\r\n     engaged in the organization of freedmen for over a year, and have\r\n     necessarily been thrown in constant contact with them.\r\n\r\n     \"The negro in a state of slavery is brought up by the master,\r\n     from early childhood, to strict obedience and to obey implicitly\r\n     the dictates of the white man, and they are thus led to believe\r\n     that they are an inferior race. Now, when organized into troops,\r\n     they carry this habit of obedience with them, and their officers\r\n     being entirely white men, the negroes promptly obey their orders.\r\n\r\n     \"A regiment is thus rapidly brought into a state of discipline.\r\n     They are a religious people--another high quality for making good\r\n     soldiers. They are a musical people, and thus readily learn to\r\n     march and accurately perform their manoeuvres. They take pride in\r\n     being elevated as soldiers, and keep themselves, as their camp\r\n     grounds, neat and clean. This I know from special inspection, two\r\n     of my staff-officers being constantly on inspecting duty. They\r\n     have proved a most important addition to our forces, enabling\r\n     the Generals in active operations to take a large force of white\r\n     troops into the field; and now brigades of blacks are placed with\r\n     the whites. The forts erected at the important points on the\r\n     river are nearly all garrisoned by blacks--artillery regiments\r\n     raised for the purpose,--say at Paducah and Columbus, Kentucky,\r\n     Memphis, Tennessee, Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi and most\r\n     of the works around New Orleans.\r\n\r\n     \"Experience proves that they manage heavy guns very well. Their\r\n     fighting qualities have also been fully tested a number of times,\r\n     and I am yet to hear of the first case where they did not fully\r\n     stand up to their work. I passed over the ground where the 1st\r\n     Louisiana made the gallant charge at Port Hudson, by far the\r\n     stronger part of the rebel works. The wonder is that so many have\r\n     made their escape. At Milliken's Bend where I had three\r\n     incomplete regiments,--one without arms until the day previous to\r\n     the attack,--greatly superior numbers of the rebels charged\r\n     furiously up to the very breastworks. The negroes met the enemy\r\n     on the ramparts, and both sides freely used the bayonet--a most\r\n     rare occurrence in warfare, as one of the other party gives way\r\n     before coming in contact with the steel. The rebels were defeated\r\n     With heavy loss. The bridge at Moscow, on the line of railroad\r\n     from Memphis to Corinth, was defended by one small regiment of\r\n     blacks. A cavalry attack of three times their number was made,\r\n     the blacks defeating them in three charges made by the Rebels.\r\n\r\n     \"They fought them hours till our cavalry came up, when the defeat\r\n     was made complete, many of the dead being left on the field.\r\n\r\n     \"A cavalry force of three hundred and fifty attacked three\r\n     hundred rebel cavalry near the Big Black with signal success, a\r\n     number of prisoners being taken and marched to Vicksburg. Forrest\r\n     attacked Paducah with 7,500 men. The garrison was between 500 and\r\n     600, nearly 400 being colored troops recently raised. What troops\r\n     could have done better? So, too, they fought well at Fort Pillow\r\n     till overpowered by greatly superior numbers.\r\n\r\n     \"The above enumerated cases seem to me sufficient to demonstrate\r\n     the value of the colored troops.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honor to be, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                        \"L. THOMAS, _Adj.-General_.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the conduct of the Colored Troops at Petersburg, a\r\ncorrespondent to the \"Boston Journal\" gave the following account from\r\nthe lips of Gen. Smith:\r\n\r\n     \"A few days ago I sat in the tent of Gen. W. F. Smith, commander\r\n     of the 18th Corps, and heard his narration of the manner in\r\n     which Gen. Hinks' division of colored troops stood the fire and\r\n     charged upon the Rebel works east of Petersburg on the 16th of\r\n     June. There were thirteen guns pouring a constant fire of shot\r\n     and shell upon those troops, enfilading the line, cutting it\r\n     lengthwise and crosswise, 'Yet they stood unmoved for _six\r\n     hours_. Not a man flinched. [These are the words of the General.]\r\n     It was as severe a test as I ever saw. But they stood it, and\r\n     when my arrangements were completed for charging the works, they\r\n     moved with the steadiness of veterans to the attack. I expected\r\n     that they would fall back, or be cut to pieces; but when I saw\r\n     them move over the field, gain the works and capture the guns, I\r\n     was astounded. They lost between 500 and 600 in doing it. There\r\n     is material in the negroes to make the best troops in the world,\r\n     if they are properly trained.'\r\n\r\n     \"These are the words of one of the ablest commanders and\r\n     engineers in the service. A graduate of West Point, who, earlier\r\n     in the war, had the prejudices which were held by many other men\r\n     against the negro. He has changed his views. He is convinced, and\r\n     honorably follows his convictions, as do all men who are not\r\n     stone blind or perversely wilful.\"[108]\r\n\r\nGen. Blunt in a letter to a friend speaks of the valor of Colored\r\nTroops at the battle of Honey Springs. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"The negroes (1st colored regiment) were too much for the enemy,\r\n     and let me here say that I never saw such fighting as was done by\r\n     that negro regiment. They fought like veterans, with a coolness\r\n     and valor that is unsurpassed. They preserved their line perfect\r\n     throughout the whole engagement, and although in the hottest of\r\n     the fight, they never once faltered. Too much praise cannot be\r\n     awarded them for their gallantry. The question that negroes will\r\n     fight is settled, besides they make better soldiers in every\r\n     respect, than any troops I have ever had under my command.\"[109]\r\n\r\nThe following from the Washington correspondent of the \"New York\r\nTribune\" is of particular value:\r\n\r\n     \"In speaking of the soldierly qualities of our colored troops, I\r\n     do not refer specially to their noble action in the perilous edge\r\n     of battle; that is settled, but to their docility and their\r\n     patience of labor and suffering in the camp and on the march.\r\n\r\n     \"I have before me a private letter from a friend, now Major in\r\n     one of the Pennsylvania colored regiments, a portion of which I\r\n     think the public should find in your columns. He says in\r\n     speaking of service in his regiment: 'I am delighted with it. I\r\n     find that these colored men learn every thing that pertains to\r\n     the duties of a soldier much faster than any white soldiers I\r\n     have ever seen. The reason is apparent,--not that they are\r\n     smarter than white men, but they feel promoted; they feel as\r\n     though their whole sphere of life was advanced and enlarged. They\r\n     are willing, obedient, and cheerful; move with agility, and _are\r\n     full of music_, which is almost a _sine qua non_ to soldierly\r\n     bearing.'\r\n\r\n     \"Soon after the letter of which the above is an extract was\r\n     written, the regiment was ordered to the field from which the\r\n     Major writes again: 'The more I know and see of these negro\r\n     regiments, the more I am delighted with the whole enterprise. It\r\n     is truly delightful to command a regiment officered as these are.\r\n     In all my experience I have never known a better class of\r\n     officers.... I have charge of the school of non-commissioned\r\n     officers here. I drill them once a day and have them recite from\r\n     the oral instructions given them the day before. I find them more\r\n     anxious to learn their duties and more ready to perform them when\r\n     they know them than any set of non-commissioned officers I ever\r\n     saw.... There is no discount on these fellows at all. Give me a\r\n     thousand such men as compose this regiment and I desire no\r\n     stronger battalion to lead against an enemy that is at once their\r\n     oppressors and traitors to my, and my soldiers' country.'\r\n\r\n     \"This testimony is worth a chapter of speculation. The Major\r\n     alludes to one fact above, moreover, to which the public\r\n     attention has not been often directed--the excellent and able men\r\n     who are in command of our colored troops. They are generally men\r\n     of heart--men of opinions--men whose generous impulses have not\r\n     been chilled in 'the cold shade of West Point.'\r\n\r\n     \"The officer from whose letter I have quoted was a volunteer in\r\n     the ranks of a Pennsylvania regiment from the day of the attack\r\n     on Sumter until August, 1862. His bravery, his devotion to the\r\n     principles of freedom, his zeal in the holy cause of his country\r\n     through all the campaigns of the calamitous McClellan, won the\r\n     regard and attention of our loyal Governor Curtin, who, with rare\r\n     good sense and discrimination, took him from the ranks and made\r\n     him first, Lieut.-Colonel, and then Colonel of a regiment in the\r\n     nine months' service. He carried himself through all in such a\r\n     manner as fully justified the Governor's confidence, and has\r\n     stepped now into a position where his patriotic zeal can\r\n     concentrate the valor of these untutored free men in defense of\r\n     our imperilled country. So long as these brave colored men are\r\n     officered by gallant, high-hearted, slave-hating men, we can\r\n     never despair of the Republic.\"[110]\r\n\r\nMr. D. Aden in a letter to Col. Darling, dated Norfolk, Va., Feb. 22,\r\n1864, said:\r\n\r\n     \"During the expedition last October to Charles City Court House,\r\n     on the Peninsula, the colored troops marched steadily through\r\n     storm and mud; and on coming up with the enemy, behaved as\r\n     bravely under fire as veterans. An officer of the 1st N. Y.\r\n     Mounted Rifles--a most bitter opponent and reviler of colored\r\n     troops--who was engaged in this affair, volunteered the statement\r\n     that they had fought bravely, and, in his own language, more\r\n     expressive than elegant, were 'bully boys'--which coming from\r\n     such a source, might be regarded as the highest praise.\r\n\r\n     \"During the recent advance toward Richmond to liberate the Union\r\n     prisoners, the 4th, 5th, and 9th regiments formed part of the\r\n     expedition and behaved splendidly. They marched thirty miles in\r\n     ten hours, and an unusually small number straggled on the route.\"\r\n\r\nCol. John A. Foster of the 175th New York, in January, 1864, wrote to\r\nCol. Darling as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"While before Port Hudson, during the siege of that place, I was\r\n     acting on Col. Gooding's staff, prior to the arrival of my\r\n     regiment at that place. On the assault of May 27, 1863, Col.\r\n     Gooding was ordered to proceed to the extreme right of our lines\r\n     and oversee the charge of the two regiments constituting the\r\n     negro-brigade, and I accompanied him.\r\n\r\n     \"We witnessed them in line of battle, under a very heavy fire of\r\n     musketry, and siege and field pieces. There was a deep gully or\r\n     bayou before them, which they could not cross nor ford in the\r\n     presence of the enemy, and hence an assault was wholly\r\n     impracticable. Yet they made five several attempts to swim and\r\n     cross it, preparatory to an assault on the enemy's works; and in\r\n     this, too, in fair view of the enemy, and at short musket range.\r\n     Added to this, the nature of the enemy's works was such that it\r\n     allowed an enfilading fire. Success was impossible; yet they\r\n     behaved as cool as if veterans, and when ordered to retire,\r\n     marched off as if on parade. I feel satisfied that, if the\r\n     position of the bayou had been known and the assault made a\r\n     quarter of a mile to the left of where it was, the place would\r\n     have been taken by this negro brigade on that day.\r\n\r\n     \"On that day I witnessed the attack made by the divisions of\r\n     Generals Grover and Paine, and can truly say I saw no steadier\r\n     fighting by those daring men than did the negroes in this their\r\n     first fight.\r\n\r\n     \"On the second assault, June 14th, in the assault made by Gen.\r\n     Paine's division, our loss was very great in wounded, and, as\r\n     there was a want of ambulance men, I ordered about a hundred\r\n     negroes, who were standing idle and unharmed, to take the\r\n     stretchers and carry the wounded from the field. Under a most\r\n     severe fire of musketry, grape, and canister, they performed this\r\n     duty with unflinching courage and nonchalance. They suffered\r\n     severely in this duty both in killed and wounded; yet not a man\r\n     faltered. These men had just been recruited, and were not even\r\n     partially disciplined. But I next saw the negroes (engineers)\r\n     working in these trenches, under a heavy fire of the enemy.

No officer, whose privilege it was to command or observe the\r\nconduct of these troops, has ever hesitated to give a full and\r\ncheerful endorsement of their worth as men, their loyalty as\r\nAmericans, and their eminent qualifications for the duties and dangers\r\nof military life. No history of the war has ever been written, no\r\nhistory of the war ever can be written, without mentioning the\r\npatience, endurance, fortitude, and heroism of the Negro soldiers who\r\nprayed, wept, fought, bled, and died for the preservation of the Union\r\nof the United States of America!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] This was remedied at length, after the 54th Massachusetts\r\nInfantry had refused pay for a year, unless the regiment could be\r\ntreated as other regiments. Major Sturges, Agent for the State of\r\nMassachusetts, made up the difference between $7 and $13 to disabled\r\nand discharged soldiers of this regiment, until the 15th June, 1864,\r\nwhen the Government came to its senses respecting this great injustice\r\nto its gallant soldiers.\r\n\r\n[98] Times, Feb. 10, 1863.\r\n\r\n[99] Times, Feb. 11, 1863.\r\n\r\n[100] For the official report of Colonel Higginson and the war\r\ncorrespondent, see Rebellion Records, vol. vii.

It called forth a bitter wail from\r\nJefferson Davis, on the 12th of January, 1863, and soon after the\r\nConfederate Congress elevated its olfactory organ and handled the\r\nsubject with a pair of tongs. After a long discussion the following\r\nwas passed:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved, by the Congress of the Confederate States of\r\n     America_, In response to the message of the President,\r\n     transmitted to Congress at the commencement of the present\r\n     session, That, in the opinion of Congress, the commissioned\r\n     officers of the enemy ought _not_ to be delivered to the\r\n     authorities of the respective States, as suggested in the said\r\n     message, but all captives taken by the Confederate forces ought\r\n     to be dealt with and disposed of by the Confederate Government.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. That, in the judgment of Congress, the proclamations of\r\n     the President of the United States, dated respectively September\r\n     22, 1862, and January 1, 1863, and the other measures of the\r\n     Government of the United States and of its authorities,\r\n     commanders, and forces, designed or tending to emancipate slaves\r\n     in the Confederate States, or to abduct such slaves, or to incite\r\n     them to insurrection, or to employ negroes in war against the\r\n     Confederate States, or to overthrow the institution of African\r\n     Slavery, and bring on a servile war in these States, would, if\r\n     successful, produce atrocious consequences, and they are\r\n     inconsistent with the spirit of those usages which, in modern\r\n     warfare, prevail among civilized nations; they may, therefore, be\r\n     properly and lawfully repressed by retaliation.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. That in every case wherein, during the present war, any\r\n     violation of the laws or usages of war among civilized nations\r\n     shall be, or has been, done and perpetrated by those acting under\r\n     the authority of the Government of the United States, on the\r\n     persons or property of citizens of the Confederate States, or of\r\n     those under the protection or in the land or naval service of the\r\n     Confederate States, or of any State of the Confederacy, the\r\n     President of the Confederate States is hereby authorized to cause\r\n     full and ample retaliation to be made for every such violation,\r\n     in such manner and to such extent as he may think proper.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. That every white person, being a commissioned officer,\r\n     or acting as such, who, during the present war, shall command\r\n     negroes or mulattoes in arms against the Confederate States, or\r\n     who shall arm, train, organize, or prepare negroes or mulattoes\r\n     for military service against the Confederate States, or who shall\r\n     voluntarily aid negroes or mulattoes in any military enterprise,\r\n     attack, or conflict in such service, shall be deemed as inciting\r\n     servile insurrection, and shall, if captured, be put to death, or\r\n     be otherwise punished at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. Every person, being a commissioned officer, or acting as\r\n     such in the service of the enemy, who shall, during the present\r\n     war, excite, attempt to excite, or cause to be excited, a servile\r\n     insurrection, or who shall incite, or cause to be incited, a\r\n     slave or rebel, shall, if captured, be put to death, or be\r\n     otherwise punished at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 6. Every person charged with an offence punishable under\r\n     the preceding resolutions shall, during the present war, be tried\r\n     before the military court attached to the array or corps by the\r\n     troops of which he shall have been captured, or by such other\r\n     military court as the President may direct, and in such manner\r\n     and under such regulations as the President shall prescribe; and,\r\n     after conviction, the President may commute the punishment in\r\n     such manner and on such terms as he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 7. All negroes and mulattoes who shall be engaged in war,\r\n     or be taken in arms against the Confederate States, or shall give\r\n     aid or comfort to the enemies of the Confederate States, shall,\r\n     when captured in the Confederate States, be delivered to the\r\n     authorities of the State or States in which they shall be\r\n     captured, to be dealt with according to the present or future\r\n     laws of such State or States.\"\r\n\r\nThis document stands alone among the resolves of the civilized\r\ngovernments of all Christendom. White persons acting as commissioned\r\nofficers in organizations of Colored Troops were to \"be put to death!\"\r\nAnd all Negroes and Mulattoes taken in arms against the Confederate\r\nGovernment were to be turned over to the authorities:--civil, of\r\ncourse--of the States in which they should be captured, to be dealt\r\nwith according to the present or future laws of such States! Now, what\r\nwere the laws of the Southern States respecting Negroes in arms\r\nagainst white people? The most cruel death. And fearing some of those\r\nStates had modified their cruel slave Code, the States were granted\r\nthe right to pass _ex post facto_ laws in order to give the\r\ncold-blooded murder of captured Negro soldiers the semblance of\r\nlaw,--and by a _civil law_ too. Colored soldiers and their officers\r\nhad been butchered before this in South Carolina, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, and Florida, notwithstanding the rebels were the first to\r\narm Negroes, as has been already shown. If the Confederates had a\r\nright to arm Negroes and include them in their armies, why could not\r\nthe Federal Government pursue the same policy? But the Rebel\r\nGovernment had determined upon a barbarous policy in dealing with\r\ncaptured Negro soldiers,--and barbarous as that policy was, the rebel\r\nsoldiers exceeded its cruel provisions tenfold. Their treatment of\r\nNegroes was perfectly fiendish.\r\n\r\nBut what was the attitude of the Federal Government? Silence, until\r\nthe butcheries of its gallant defenders had sickened the civilized\r\nworld, and until the Christian governments of Europe frowned upon the\r\ninhuman indifference of the Government that would _force_ its slaves\r\nto fight its battles and then allow them to be tortured to death in\r\nthe name of \"_State laws_!\" Even the most conservative papers of the\r\nNorth began to feel that some policy ought to be adopted whereby the\r\nlives of Colored soldiers could be protected against the inhuman\r\ntreatment bestowed upon them when captured by the rebels. In the\r\nspring of 1863, the \"Tribune,\" referring to this subject, said,\r\neditorially:\r\n\r\n     \"The Government has sent Adj.-General Thomas to the West with\r\n     full authority to arm and organize the negroes for service\r\n     against the Rebels. They are to be employed to protect the\r\n     navigation of the Mississippi and other rivers against\r\n     guerrillas, and as garrisons at fortified posts, and are\r\n     evidently destined for all varieties of military duty. Seven\r\n     thousand soldiers who listened to this announcement at Fort\r\n     Curtis received it with satisfaction and applause. Gen. Thomas,\r\n     heretofore known as opposed to this and all similar measures,\r\n     urged in his address that the Blacks should be treated with\r\n     kindness; declared his belief in their capacity, and informed the\r\n     officers of the army that no one would be permitted to oppose or\r\n     in any way interfere with this policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not directly stated, but may be inferred from the\r\n     Despatch, that the negroes are not to be encouraged to enlist,\r\n     but are to be drafted. At all events, the policy of the\r\n     Government to employ Black Troops in active service is definitely\r\n     established, and it becomes--as indeed it has been for months--a\r\n     very serious question what steps are to be taken for their\r\n     protection. The Proclamation of Jefferson Davis remains\r\n     unrevoked. By it he threatened death or slavery to every negro\r\n     taken in arms, and to their white officers the same fate. What is\r\n     the response of our Government? Hitherto, silence. The number of\r\n     negroes in its service has already increased; in South Carolina\r\n     they have already been mustered into regiments by a sweeping\r\n     conscription, and now in the West apparently the same policy is\r\n     adopted and rigorously enforced.\r\n\r\n     \"Does the Government mean that the men are to be exposed not\r\n     merely to the chances of battle, but to the doom which the\r\n     unanswered Proclamation of the Rebel President threatens?\r\n\r\n     \"Every black soldier now marches to battle with a halter about\r\n     his neck. The simple question is: Shall we protect and insure the\r\n     ordinary treatment of a prisoner of war? Under it, every negro\r\n     yet captured has suffered death or been sent back to the hell of\r\n     slavery from which he had escaped. The bloody massacre of black\r\n     prisoners at Murfreesboro, brooked, so far as the public knows,\r\n     no retaliation at Washington. The black servants captured at\r\n     Galveston--free men and citizens of Massachusetts--were sold into\r\n     slavery and remained there. In every instance in which they have\r\n     had the opportunity, the rebels have enforced their barbarous\r\n     proclamation. How much longer are they to be suffered to do it\r\n     without remonstrance?\r\n\r\n     \"Gen. Hunter--at this moment in the field,--General. Butler, and\r\n     hundreds of other white officers are included in this\r\n     Proclamation, or were previously outlawed and adjudged a felon's\r\n     death. Delay remonstrance much longer, and retaliation must\r\n     supersede it. If the Government wishes to be spared the necessity\r\n     of retaliating, it has only to _say_ that it will retaliate--to\r\n     declare by proclamation or general order that all its soldiers\r\n     who may be captured must receive from the Rebels the treatment to\r\n     which, as prisoners of war, they are, by the usages of war,\r\n     entitled. The Government can know no distinction of color under\r\n     its flag. The moment a soldier shoulders a musket he is invested\r\n     with every military right which belongs to a white soldier. He is\r\n     at least and above all things entitled to the safeguards which\r\n     surround his white comrades.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not possible to suppose the Government means to withhold\r\n     them; we only urge that the wisest, safest, and humanest, as well\r\n     as the most honorable policy, is at once to announce its\r\n     purpose.\"[112]\r\n\r\nThe able article just quoted had a wholesome effect upon many\r\nthoughtful men at the South, and brought the blush to the cheek of the\r\nnation. A few of the Southern journals agreed with Mr. Greeley that\r\nthe resolves of the Confederate Congress were unjustifiable; that the\r\nCongress had no right to say what color the Union soldiers should be;\r\nand that such action would damage their cause in the calm and humane\r\njudgment of all Europe. But the Confederate Congress was unmoved and\r\nunmovable upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThree Colored men had been captured in Stone River on the gun-boat\r\n\"Isaac Smith.\" They were free men; but, notwithstanding this, they\r\nwere placed in close confinement and treated like felons. Upon the\r\nfacts reaching the ear of the Government, Secretary Stanton took three\r\nSouth Carolina prisoners and had them subjected to the same treatment,\r\nand the facts telegraphed to the Rebel authorities. Commenting upon\r\nthe question of the treatment of captured Colored soldiers the\r\n\"Richmond Examiner\" said:\r\n\r\n     \"It is not merely the pretension of a regular Government\r\n     affecting to deal with 'Rebels,' but it is a deadly stab which\r\n     they are aiming at our institutions themselves--because they know\r\n     that, if we were insane enough to yield this point, to treat\r\n     Black men as the equals of White, and insurgent slaves as\r\n     equivalent to our brave soldiers, the very foundation of Slavery\r\n     would be fatally wounded.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this occurrence an exchange of prisoners took place in\r\nfront of Charleston. The rebels returned only white prisoners. When\r\nupbraided by the Union officers for not exchanging Negroes the reply\r\ncame that under the resolutions of the Confederate Congress they could\r\nnot deliver up any Negro soldiers. This fact stirred the heart of the\r\nNorth, and caused the Government to act. The following order was\r\nissued by the President:\r\n\r\n                                   \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,         }\r\n                                   \"WASHINGTON, July 30, 1863. }\r\n\r\n     \"It is the duty of every Government to give protection to its\r\n     citizens, of whatever class, color, or condition, and especially\r\n     to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the public\r\n     service. The law of nations, and the usages and customs of war,\r\n     as carried on by civilized powers, permit no distinction as to\r\n     color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies. To\r\n     sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color, and\r\n     for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into\r\n     barbarism, and a crime against the civilization of the age.\r\n\r\n     \"The Government of the United States will give the same\r\n     protection to all its soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or\r\n     enslave any one because of his color, the offense shall be\r\n     punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our\r\n     possession.\r\n\r\n     \"It is therefore ordered that, for every soldier of the United\r\n     States killed in violation of the laws of war, a Rebel soldier\r\n     shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or\r\n     sold into Slavery, a Rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor\r\n     on public works, and continued at such labor until the other\r\n     shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of\r\n     war.\r\n\r\n                                    \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n              \"By order of the Secretary of War.\r\n     \"E.

The \"Richmond Examiner\"\r\ncontained an account of the battle of Newbern, North Carolina, in\r\nwhich the writer seemed to gloat over the fact that a captured Negro\r\nhad been hung after he had surrendered. It came to the knowledge of\r\nGen. Peck, commanding the army of the District of North Carolina, when\r\nthe following correspondence took place:\r\n\r\n                         \"HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY AND DISTRICT OF }\r\n                         \"NORTH CAROLINA, NEWBERN, NORTH           }\r\n                         \"CAROLINA, Feb. 11, 1864:                 }\r\n\r\n     \"Major-General PICKETT, _Department of Virginia and North\r\n     Carolina, \"Confederate Army, Petersburg_.\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a slip cut from the\r\n     Richmond 'Examiner,' February eighth, 1864. It is styled 'The\r\n     Advance on Newbern,' and appears to have been extracted from the\r\n     Petersburg 'Register,' a paper published in the city where your\r\n     headquarters are located.\r\n\r\n     \"Your attention is particularly invited to that paragraph which\r\n     states 'that Colonel Shaw was shot dead by a negro soldier from\r\n     the other side of the river, which he was spanning with a pontoon\r\n     bridge, and that the negro was watched, followed, taken, and\r\n     hanged after the action at Thomasville.\r\n\r\n     \"'THE ADVANCE ON NEWBERN.--The Petersburg \"Register\" gives the\r\n     following additional facts of the advance on Newbern: Our army,\r\n     according to the report of passengers arriving from Weldon, has\r\n     fallen back to a point sixteen miles west of Newbern. The reason\r\n     assigned for this retrograde movement was that Newbern could not\r\n     be taken by us without a loss on our part which would find no\r\n     equivalent in its capture, as the place was stronger than we had\r\n     anticipated. Yet, in spite of this, we are sure that the\r\n     expedition will result in good to our cause. Our forces are in a\r\n     situation to get large supplies from a country still abundant, to\r\n     prevent raids on points westward, and keep tories in check, and\r\n     hang them when caught.\r\n\r\n     \"'From a private, who was one of the guard that brought the batch\r\n     of prisoners through, we learn that Colonel Shaw was shot dead by\r\n     a negro soldier from the other side of the river, which he was\r\n     spanning with a pontoon bridge. The negro was watched, followed,\r\n     taken, and hanged after the action at Thomasville.

I have the honor to state in reply, that the paragraph\r\n     from a newspaper inclosed therein, is not only without foundation\r\n     in fact, but so ridiculous that I should scarcely have supposed\r\n     it worthy of consideration; but I would respectfully inform you\r\n     that had I caught _any negro_, who had killed either officer,\r\n     soldier, or citizen of the Confederate States, I should have\r\n     caused him to be immediately executed.\r\n\r\n     \"To your threat expressed in the following extract from your\r\n     communication, namely: 'Believing that this atrocity has been\r\n     perpetrated without your knowledge, and that you will take prompt\r\n     steps to disavow this violation of the usages of war, and to\r\n     bring the offenders to justice, I shall refrain from executing a\r\n     rebel soldier until I learn of your action in the premises,' I\r\n     have merely to say that I have in my hands and subject to my\r\n     orders, captured in the recent operations in this department,\r\n     some four hundred and fifty officers and men of the United States\r\n     army, and for every man you hang I will hang ten of the United\r\n     States army.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                          \"J.

During the month of July, 1863, quite a number\r\nof Colored soldiers had fallen into the hands of the enemy on Morris\r\nand James islands. The rebels did not only refuse to exchange them as\r\nprisoners of war, but treated them most cruelly.\r\n\r\nOn this very important subject, in reply to some strictures of the\r\nCharleston \"Mercury\" (made under _misapprehension_), the Chief of\r\nStaff of General Beauregard addressed to that journal the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF S.

Butler \"a felon,\r\nan outlaw, and an enemy of mankind.\" It recited his hanging of\r\nMumford; the neglect of the Federal Government to explain or\r\ndisapprove the act; the imprisonment of non-combatants; Butler's woman\r\norder; his sequestration of estates in Western Louisiana; and the\r\ninciting to insurrection and arming of slaves. Mr. Davis directed any\r\nConfederate officer who should capture Gen. Butler to hang him\r\nimmediately and without trial. Mr. Davis's proclamation is given here,\r\nas history is bound to hold him personally responsible for the\r\ncruelties practised upon Negro soldiers captured by the rebels from\r\nthat time till the close of the war.\r\n\r\n     \"First. That all commissioned officers in the command of said\r\n     Benjamin F.

That the private soldiers and non-commissioned officers\r\n     in the army of said Butler be considered as only the instruments\r\n     used for the commission of crimes perpetrated by his orders, and\r\n     not as free agents; that they, therefore, be treated, when\r\n     captured as prisoners of war, with kindness and humanity, and be\r\n     sent home on the usual parole that they will in no manner aid or\r\n     serve the United States in any capacity during the continuance of\r\n     this war, unless duly exchanged.\r\n\r\n     \"Third.

That the like orders be executed in all cases with\r\n     respect to all commissioned officers of the United States, when\r\n     found serving in company with said slaves in insurrection against\r\n     the authorities of the different States of this Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     \"[Signed and sealed at Richmond, Dec. 23, 1862.]\r\n\r\n                                             \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\nThe ghastly horrors of Fort Pillow stand alone in the wide field of\r\nwar cruelties. The affair demands great fortitude in the historian who\r\nwould truthfully give a narrative of such bloody, sickening detail.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, 1864, Gen. N. B. Forrest, commanding a corps of\r\nConfederate cavalry, appeared before Fort Pillow, situated about\r\nforty miles above Memphis, Tennessee, and demanded its surrender. It\r\nwas held by Major L. F. Booth, with a garrison of 557 men, 262 of whom\r\nwere Colored soldiers of the 6th U. S. Heavy Artillery; the other\r\ntroops were white, under Major Bradford of the 13th Tennessee Cavalry.\r\nThe garrison was mounted with six guns. From before sunrise until nine\r\nA.M. the Union troops had held an outer line of intrenchments; but\r\nupon the death of Major Booth Major Bradford retired his force into\r\nthe fort. It was situated upon a high bluff on the Mississippi River,\r\nflanked by two ravines with sheer declivities and partially timbered.\r\nThe gun-boat \"New Era\" was to have coöperated with the fort, but on\r\naccount of the extreme height of the bluff, was unable to do much. The\r\nfighting continued until about two o'clock in the afternoon, when the\r\nfiring slackened on both sides to allow the guns to cool off. The \"New\r\nEra,\" nearly out of shell, backed into the river to clean her guns.\r\nDuring this lull Gen. Forrest sent a flag of truce demanding the\r\nunconditional surrender of the fort. A consultation of the Federal\r\nofficers was held, and a request made for twenty minutes to consult\r\nthe officers of the gun-boat. Gen. Forrest refused to grant this,\r\nsaying that he only demanded the surrender of the fort and not the\r\ngun-boat. He demanded an immediate surrender, which was promptly\r\ndeclined by Major Bradford. During the time these negotiations were\r\ngoing on, Forrest's men were stealing horses, plundering the buildings\r\nin front of the fort, and closing in upon the fort through the\r\nravines, which was unsoldierly and cowardly to say the least. Upon\r\nreceiving the refusal of Major Booth to capitulate, Forrest gave a\r\nsignal and his troops made a frantic charge upon the fort. It was\r\nreceived gallantly and resisted stubbornly, but there was no use of\r\nfighting. In ten minutes the enemy, assaulting the fort in the centre,\r\nand striking it on the flanks, swept in. The Federal troops\r\nsurrendered; but an indiscriminate massacre followed. Men were shot\r\ndown in their tracks; pinioned to the ground with bayonet and sabre.\r\nSome were clubbed to death while dying of wounds; others were made to\r\nget down upon their knees, in which condition they were shot to death.\r\nSome were burned alive, having been fastened into the buildings, while\r\nstill others were nailed against the houses, tortured, and then burned\r\nto a crisp. A little Colored boy only eight years old was lifted to\r\nthe horse of a rebel who intended taking him along with him, when\r\nGen. Forrest meeting the soldier ordered him to put the child down and\r\nshoot him. The soldier remonstrated, but the stern and cruel order was\r\nrepeated, emphasized with an oath, and backed with a threat that\r\nendangered the soldier's life, so he put the child on the ground and\r\nshot him dead! From three o'clock in the afternoon until the merciful\r\ndarkness came and threw the sable wings of night over the carnival of\r\ndeath, the slaughter continued. The stars looked down in pity upon the\r\ndead--ah! they were beyond the barbarous touch of the rebel\r\nfiends--and the dying; and the angels found a spectacle worthy of\r\ntheir tears. And when the morning looked down upon the battle-field,\r\nit was not to find it peaceful in death and the human hyenas gone.\r\nAlas! those who had survived the wounds of the day before were set\r\nupon again and brained or shot to death.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Conduct and Expenditures of the War gave this\r\n\"Horrible Massacre\" an investigation. They examined such of the Union\r\nsoldiers as escaped from death at Fort Pillow and were sent to the\r\nMound City Hospital, Illinois. The following extracts from the\r\ntestimony given before the Committee, the Hons. Ben. F. Wade and D. W.\r\nGooch, give something of an idea of this the most cruel and inhuman\r\naffair in the history of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nManuel Nichols (Colored), private. Company B, Sixth United States\r\nHeavy Artillery, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Question. Were you in the late fight at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     Answer. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you wounded there?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. When?\r\n\r\n     A. I was wounded once about a half an hour before we gave up.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they do any thing to you after you surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; they shot me in the head under my left ear, and the\r\n     morning after the fight they shot me again in the right arm. When\r\n     they came up and killed the wounded ones, I saw some four or five\r\n     coming down the hill. I said to one of our boys: \"Anderson, I\r\n     expect if those fellows come here they will kill us.\" I was lying\r\n     on my right side, leaning on my elbow. One of the black soldiers\r\n     went into the house where the white soldiers were. I asked him if\r\n     there was any water in there, and he said yes; I wanted some, and\r\n     took a stick and tried to get to the house. I did not get to the\r\n     house. Some of them came along, and saw a little boy belonging\r\n     to Company D. One of them had his musket on his shoulder, and\r\n     shot the boy down. He said: \"All you damned niggers come out of\r\n     the house; I am going to shoot you.\" Some of the white soldiers\r\n     said: \"Boys, it is only death anyhow; if you don't go out they\r\n     will come in and carry you out.\" My strength seemed to come to me\r\n     as if I had never been shot, and I jumped up and ran down the\r\n     hill. I met one of them coming up the hill; he said: \"Stop!\" but\r\n     I kept on running. As I jumped over the hill, he shot me through\r\n     the right arm.\r\n\r\n     Q. How many did you see them kill after they had surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. After I surrendered I did not go down the hill. A man shot me\r\n     under the ear, and I fell down and said to myself: \"If he don't\r\n     shoot me any more this won't hurt me.\" One of their officers came\r\n     along and hallooed: \"Forrest says no quarter! no quarter!\" and\r\n     the next one hallooed: \"Black flag! black flag!\"\r\n\r\n     Q. What did they do then?\r\n\r\n     A. They kept on shooting. I could hear them down the hill.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see them bury any body?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; they carried me around right to the corner of the\r\n     Fort, and I saw them pitch men in there.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was there any alive?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not see them bury any body alive.\r\n\r\n     Q. How near to you was the man who shot you under the ear?\r\n\r\n     A. Right close to my head. When I was shot in the side, a man\r\n     turned me over, and took my pocket-knife and pocket-book. I had\r\n     some of these brass things that looked like cents. They said:\r\n     \"Here's some money; here's some money.\" I said to myself: \"You\r\n     got fooled that time.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Williams (Colored), private. Company B, Sixth United States\r\nHeavy Artillery, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy the Chairman:\r\n\r\n     Q. Where were you raised?\r\n\r\n     A. In Tennessee and North Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     Q. Where did you enlist?\r\n\r\n     A. In Memphis.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who was your captain?\r\n\r\n     A. Captain Lamburg.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you in the fight at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was your captain with you?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I think he was at Memphis.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who commanded your company?\r\n\r\n     A. Lieutenant Hunter and Sergeant Fox were all the officers we\r\n     had.\r\n\r\n     Q. What did you see done there?\r\n\r\n     A. We fought them right hard during the battle, and killed some\r\n     of them. After a time they sent in a flag of truce. They said\r\n     afterward that they did it to make us stop firing until their\r\n     reinforcements could come up. They said that they never could\r\n     have got in if they had not done that; that we had whipped them;\r\n     that they had never seen such a fight.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see the flag of truce?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. What did they do when the flag of truce was in?\r\n\r\n     A. They kept coming up nearer, so that they could charge quick. A\r\n     heap of them came up after we stopped firing.\r\n\r\n     Q. When did you surrender?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not surrender until they all ran.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you wounded then?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; after the surrender.\r\n\r\n     Q. At what time of day was that?\r\n\r\n     A. They told me it was about half after one o'clock, I was\r\n     wounded. Immediately we retreated.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you have any arms in your hands when they shot you?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I was an artillery man, and had no arms.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see the man who shot you?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you hear him say any thing?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I heard nothing. He shot me, and I was bleeding\r\n     pretty free, and I thought to myself: \"I will make out it was a\r\n     dead shot, and maybe I will not get another.\"\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any others shot?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was there any thing said about giving quarter?\r\n\r\n     A. Major Bradford brought in a black flag, which meant no\r\n     quarter. I heard, some of the rebel officers say: \"You damned\r\n     rascals, if you had not fought us so hard, but had stopped when\r\n     we sent in a flag of truce, we would not have done any thing to\r\n     you.\" I heard one of the officers say: \"Kill all the niggers\";\r\n     another one said: \"No; Forrest says take them and carry them with\r\n     him to wait upon him and cook for him, and put them in jail and\r\n     send them to their masters.\" Still they kept on shooting. They\r\n     shot at me after that, but did not hit me; a rebel officer shot\r\n     at me. He took aim at my side; at the crack of his pistol I fell.\r\n     He went on and said: \"There's another dead nigger.\"\r\n\r\n     Q. Was there any one shot in the hospital that day?\r\n\r\n     A. Not that I know of. I think they all came away and made a raft\r\n     and floated across the mouth of the creek and got into a flat\r\n     bottom.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any buildings burned?\r\n\r\n     A. I stayed in the woods all day Wednesday. I was there Thursday\r\n     and looked at the buildings. I saw a great deal left that they\r\n     did not have a chance to burn up. I saw a white man burned up who\r\n     was nailed up against the house.\r\n\r\n     Q. A private or an officer?\r\n\r\n     A. An officer; I think it was a lieutenant in the Tennessee\r\n     cavalry.\r\n\r\n     Q. How was he nailed?\r\n\r\n     A. Through his hands and feet right against the house.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was his body burned?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; burned all over--I looked at him good.\r\n\r\n     Q. When did you see that?\r\n\r\n     A. On the Thursday after the battle.\r\n\r\n     Q. Where was the man?\r\n\r\n     A. Right in front of the Fort.\r\n\r\nJacob Thompson (Colored), sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you a soldier at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I was not a soldier; but I went up in the Fort and\r\n     fought with the rest. I was shot in the hand and the head.\r\n\r\n     Q. When were you shot?\r\n\r\n     A. After I surrendered.\r\n\r\n     Q. How many times were you shot?\r\n\r\n     A. I was shot but once; but I threw my hand up, and the shot went\r\n     through my hand and my head.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who shot you?\r\n\r\n     A. A private.\r\n\r\n     Q. What did he say?\r\n\r\n     A. He said: \"God damn you, I will shoot you, old friend.\"\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see anybody else shot?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; they just called them out like dogs, and shot them\r\n     down. I reckon they shot about fifty, white and black, right\r\n     there. They nailed some black sergeants to the logs, and set the\r\n     logs on fire.\r\n\r\n     Q. When did you see that?\r\n\r\n     A. When I went there in the morning I saw them; they were burning\r\n     all together.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they kill them before they burned them?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; they nailed them to the logs; drove the nails right\r\n     through their hands.\r\n\r\n     Q. How many did you see in that condition?\r\n\r\n     A. Some four or five; I saw two white men burned.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was there any one else there who saw that?\r\n\r\n     A. I reckon there was; I could not tell who.\r\n\r\n     Q. When was it that you saw them?\r\n\r\n     A. I saw them in the morning after the fight; some of them were\r\n     burned almost in two. I could tell they were white men, because\r\n     they were whiter than the colored men.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you notice how they were nailed?\r\n\r\n     A. I saw one nailed to the side of a house; he looked like he was\r\n     nailed right through his wrist. I was trying then to get to the\r\n     boat when I saw it.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see them kill any white men?\r\n\r\n     A. They killed some eight or nine there. I reckon they killed\r\n     more than twenty after it was all over; called them out from\r\n     under the hill, and shot them down. They would call out a white\r\n     man and shoot him down, and call out a colored man and shoot him\r\n     down; do it just as fast as they could make their guns go off.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any rebel officers about there when this was going\r\n     on?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; old Forrest was one.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you know Forrest?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; he was a little bit of a man. I had seen him before\r\n     at Jackson.\r\n\r\nRansom Anderson (Colored), Company B, Sixth United States Heavy\r\nArtillery, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Q. Where were you raised?\r\n\r\n     A. In Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you a slave?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Where did you enlist?\r\n\r\n     A. At Corinth.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you in the fight at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Describe what you saw done there.\r\n\r\n     A. Most all the men that were killed on our side were killed\r\n     after the fight was over. They called them out and shot them\r\n     down. Then they put some in the houses and shut them up, and\r\n     then burned the houses.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see them burn?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were any of them alive?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; they were wounded, and could not walk. They put them\r\n     in the houses, and then burned the houses down.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know they were in there?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; I went and looked in there.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know they were in there when the house was burned?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; I heard them hallooing there when the houses were\r\n     burning.\r\n\r\n     Q. Are you sure they were wounded men, and not dead men, when\r\n     they were put in there?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; they told them they were going to have the doctor\r\n     see them, and then put them in there and shut them up, and burned\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who set the house on fire?\r\n\r\n     A. I saw a rebel soldier take some grass and lay it by the door,\r\n     and set it on fire. The door was pine plank, and it caught easy.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was the door fastened up?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; it was barred with one of those wide bolts.\r\n\r\nJames Walls, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Q. To what company did you belong?\r\n\r\n     A. To Company E, Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     Q. Under what officers did you serve?\r\n\r\n     A. I was under Major Bradford and Captain Potter.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you in the fight at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. State what you saw there of the fight, and what was done after\r\n     the place was captured.\r\n\r\n     A. We fought them for some six or eight hours in the Fort, and\r\n     when they charged our men scattered and ran under the hill; some\r\n     turned back and surrendered, and were shot. After the flag of\r\n     truce came in I went down to get some water. As I was coming back\r\n     I turned sick, and laid down behind a log. The secesh charged,\r\n     and after they came over I saw one go a good ways ahead of the\r\n     others. One of our men made to him and threw down his arms. The\r\n     bullets were flying so thick there I thought I could not live\r\n     there, so I threw down my arms and surrendered. He did not shoot\r\n     me then, but as I turned around he or some other one shot me in\r\n     the back.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they say any thing while they were shooting?\r\n\r\n     A. All I heard was: \"Shoot him, shoot him!\" \"Yonder he goes!\"\r\n     \"Kill him, kill him!\" That is about all I heard.\r\n\r\n     Q. How many do you suppose you saw shot after they surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not see but two or three shot around me. One of the boys\r\n     of our company, named Taylor, ran up there, and I saw him shot\r\n     and fall. Then another was shot just before me, like--shot down\r\n     after he threw down his arms.\r\n\r\n     Q. Those were white men?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir. I saw them make lots of niggers stand up, and then\r\n     they shot them down like hogs. The next morning I was lying\r\n     around there waiting for the boat to come up. The secesh would be\r\n     prying around there, and would come to a nigger, and say: \"You\r\n     ain't dead, are you?\" They would not say any thing; and then the\r\n     secesh would get down off their horses, prick them in their\r\n     sides, and say: \"Damn you, you ain't dead; get up.\" Then they\r\n     would make them get up on their knees, when they would shoot them\r\n     down like hogs.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any rebel officers about while this shooting was\r\n     going on?\r\n\r\n     A. I do not know as I saw any officers about when they were\r\n     shooting the negroes. A captain came to me a few minutes after I\r\n     was shot; he was close by me when I was shot.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did he try to stop the shooting?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not hear a word of their trying to stop it. After they\r\n     were shot down, he told them not to shoot them any more. I begged\r\n     him not to let them shoot me again, and he said they would not.\r\n     One man, after he was shot down, was shot again. After I was shot\r\n     down, the man I surrendered to went around the tree I was against\r\n     and shot a man, and then came around to me again and wanted my\r\n     pocket-book. I handed it up to him, and he saw my watch-chain and\r\n     made a grasp at it, and got the watch and about half the chain.\r\n     He took an old Barlow knife I had in my pocket. It was not worth\r\n     five cents; was of no account at all, only to cut tobacco with.\r\n\r\nLieutenant McJ. Leming, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you in the fight at Fort Pillow?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. What is your rank and position?\r\n\r\n     A. I am a First Lieutenant and Adjutant of the Thirteenth\r\n     Tennessee Cavalry. A short time previous to the fight I was\r\n     Post-Adjutant at Fort Pillow, and during most of the engagement\r\n     I was acting as Post-Adjutant. After Major Booth was killed,\r\n     Major Bradford was in command. The pickets were driven in just\r\n     before sunrise, which was the first intimation we had that the\r\n     enemy were approaching. I repaired to the Fort, and found that\r\n     Major Booth was shelling the rebels as they came up toward the\r\n     outer intrenchments. They kept up a steady fire by sharp-shooters\r\n     behind trees and logs and high knolls. The Major thought at one\r\n     time they were planting some artillery, or looking for places to\r\n     plant it. They began to draw nearer and nearer, up to the time\r\n     our men were all drawn into the Fort. Two companies of the\r\n     Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry were ordered out as sharp-shooters,\r\n     but were finally ordered in. We were pressed on all sides.\r\n\r\n     I think Major Booth fell not later than nine o'clock. His\r\n     Adjutant, who was then acting Post-Adjutant, fell near the same\r\n     time. Major Bradford then took the command, and I acted as\r\n     Post-Adjutant. Previous to this, Major Booth had ordered some\r\n     buildings in front of the Fort to be destroyed, as the enemy's\r\n     sharp-shooters were endeavoring to get possession of them. There\r\n     were four rows of buildings, but only the row nearest the fort\r\n     was destroyed; the sharp-shooters gained possession of the others\r\n     before they could be destroyed. The fight continued, one almost\r\n     unceasing fire all the time, until about three o'clock. They\r\n     threw some shells, but they did not do much damage with their\r\n     shells.\r\n\r\n     I think it was about three o'clock that a flag of truce\r\n     approached. I went out, accompanied by Captain Young, the\r\n     Provost-Marshal of the post. There was another officer, I think,\r\n     but I do not recollect now particularly who it was, and some four\r\n     mounted men. The rebels announced that they had a communication\r\n     from General Forrest. One of their officers there, I think, from\r\n     his dress, was a colonel. I received the communication, and they\r\n     said they would wait for an answer. As near as I remember, the\r\n     communication was as follows:\r\n\r\n                         \"HEADQUARTERS CONFEDERATE CAVALRY, }\r\n                         \"NEAR FORT PILLOW, April 12, 1864. }\r\n\r\n          \"As your gallant defence of the Fort has entitled you to the\r\n          treatment of brave men [or something to that effect], I now\r\n          demand an unconditional surrender of your force, at the same\r\n          time assuring you that they will be treated as prisoners of\r\n          war. I have received a fresh supply of ammunition, and can\r\n          easily take your position.\r\n\r\n                                             \"N. B. FORREST.\r\n\r\n          \"MAJOR L. F. BOOTH,\r\n               \"_Commanding United States Forces_.\"\r\n\r\n     I took this message back to the Fort. Major Bradford replied that\r\n     he desired an hour for consultation and consideration with his\r\n     officers and the officers of the gun-boat. I took out this\r\n     communication to them, and they carried it back to General\r\n     Forrest. In a few minutes another flag of truce appeared, and I\r\n     went out to meet it. Some one said, when they handed the\r\n     communication to me: \"That gives you twenty minutes to surrender;\r\n     I am General Forrest.\" I took it back. The substance of it was:\r\n     \"Twenty minutes will be given you to take your men outside of the\r\n     Fort. If in that time they are not out, I will immediately\r\n     proceed to assault your works,\" or something of that kind. To\r\n     this Major Bradford replied: \"I will not surrender.\" I took it\r\n     out in a sealed envelope, and gave it to him. The general opened\r\n     it and read it. Nothing was said; we simply saluted, and they\r\n     went their way, and I returned back into the Fort.\r\n\r\n     Almost instantly the firing began again. We mistrusted, while\r\n     this flag of truce was going on, that they were taking horses out\r\n     at a camp we had. It was mentioned to them, the last time that\r\n     this and other movements excited our suspicion, that they were\r\n     moving their troops. They said that they had noticed it\r\n     themselves, and had it stopped; that it was unintentional on\r\n     their part, and that it should not be repeated.\r\n\r\n     It was not long after the last flag of truce had retired, that\r\n     they made their grand charge. We kept them back for several\r\n     minutes. What was called ---- brigade or battalion attacked the\r\n     centre of the Fort where several companies of colored troops were\r\n     stationed. They finally gave way, and, before we could fill up\r\n     the breach, the enemy got inside the Fort, and then they came in\r\n     on the other two sides, and had complete possession of the Fort.\r\n     In the mean time nearly all the officers had been killed,\r\n     especially of the colored troops, and there was no one hardly to\r\n     guide the men. They fought bravely indeed until that time. I do\r\n     not think the men who broke had a commissioned officer over them.\r\n     They fought with the most determined bravery, until the enemy\r\n     gained possession of the Fort. They kept shooting all the time.\r\n     The negroes ran down the hill toward the river, but the rebels\r\n     kept shooting them as they were running; shot some again after\r\n     they had fallen; robbed and plundered them. After every thing was\r\n     all gone, after we had given up the Fort entirely, the guns\r\n     thrown away and the firing on our part stopped, they still kept\r\n     up their murderous fire, more especially on the colored troops, I\r\n     thought, although the white troops suffered a great deal. I know\r\n     the colored troops had a great deal the worst of it. I saw\r\n     several shot after they were wounded; as they were crawling\r\n     around, the secesh would step out and blow their brains out.\r\n\r\n     About this time they shot me. It must have been four or half-past\r\n     four o'clock. I saw there was no chance at all, and threw down my\r\n     sabre. A man took deliberate aim at me, but a short distance from\r\n     me, certainly not more than fifteen paces, and shot me.\r\n\r\n     Q. With a musket or pistol?\r\n\r\n     A. I think it was a carbine; it may have been a musket, but my\r\n     impression is, that it was a carbine. Soon after I was shot I was\r\n     robbed. A secesh soldier came along, and wanted to know if I had\r\n     any greenbacks. I gave him my pocket-book. I had about a hundred\r\n     dollars, I think, more or less, and a gold watch and gold chain.\r\n     They took every thing in the way of valuables that I had. I saw\r\n     them robbing others. That seemed to be the general way they\r\n     served the wounded, so far as regards those who fell in my\r\n     vicinity. Some of the colored troops jumped into the river, but\r\n     were shot as fast as they were seen. One poor fellow was shot as\r\n     he reached the bank of the river. They ran down and hauled him\r\n     out. He got on his hands and knees, and was crawling along, when\r\n     a secesh soldier put his revolver to his head, and blew his\r\n     brains out. It was about the same thing all along, until dark\r\n     that night.\r\n\r\n     I was very weak, but I finally found a rebel who belonged to a\r\n     society that I am a member of (the Masons), and he got two of our\r\n     colored soldiers to assist me up the hill, and he brought me some\r\n     water. At that time it was about dusk. He carried me up just to\r\n     the edge of the Fort, and laid me down. There seemed to be quite\r\n     a number of dead collected there. They were throwing them into\r\n     the outside trench, and I heard them talking about burying them\r\n     there. I heard one of them say: \"There is a man who is not quite\r\n     dead yet.\" They buried a number there; I do not know how many.\r\n\r\n     I was carried that night to a sort of little shanty that the\r\n     rebels had occupied during the day with their sharp-shooters. I\r\n     received no medical attention that night at all. The next morning\r\n     early I heard the report of cannon down the river. It was the\r\n     gun-boat 28 coming up from Memphis; she was shelling the rebels\r\n     along the shore as she came up. The rebels immediately ordered\r\n     the burning of all the buildings, and ordered the two buildings\r\n     where the wounded were to be fired. Some one called to the\r\n     officer who gave the order, and said there were wounded in them.\r\n     The building I was in began to catch fire. I prevailed upon one\r\n     of our soldiers who had not been hurt much to draw me out, and I\r\n     think others got the rest out. They drew us down a little way, in\r\n     a sort of gully, and we lay there in the hot sun without water or\r\n     any thing.\r\n\r\n     About this time a squad of rebels came around, it would seem for\r\n     the purpose of murdering what negroes they could find. They began\r\n     to shoot the wounded negroes all around there, interspersed with\r\n     the whites. I was lying a little way from a wounded negro, when a\r\n     secesh soldier came up to him, and said: \"What in hell are you\r\n     doing here?\" The colored soldier said he wanted to get on the\r\n     gun-boat. The secesh soldier said: \"You want to fight us again,\r\n     do you? Damn you, I'll teach you,\" and drew up his gun and shot\r\n     him dead. Another negro was standing up erect a little way from\r\n     me--he did not seem to be hurt much. The rebel loaded his gun\r\n     again immediately. The negro begged of him not to shoot him, but\r\n     he drew up his gun and took deliberate aim at his head. The gun\r\n     snapped, but he fixed it again, and then killed him. I saw this.\r\n     I heard them shooting all around there--I suppose killing them.\r\n\r\nBy the Chairman:\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know of any rebel officers going on board our gun-boat\r\n     after she came up?\r\n\r\n     A. I don't know about the gun-boat, but I saw some of them on\r\n     board the \"Platte Valley,\" after I had been carried on her. They\r\n     came on board, and I think went into drink with some of our\r\n     officers. I think one of the rebel officers was General Chalmers.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know what officers of ours drank with them?\r\n\r\n     A. I do not.\r\n\r\n     Q. You know that they did go on board the \"Platte Valley\" and\r\n     drink with some of our officers?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not see them drinking at the time, but I have no doubt\r\n     they did; that was my impression from all I saw, and I thought\r\n     our officers might have been in better business.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were our officers treating these rebel officers with\r\n     attention?\r\n\r\n     A. They seemed to be; I did not see much of it, as they passed\r\n     along by me.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know whether or not the conduct of the privates, in\r\n     murdering our soldiers after they had surrendered, seemed to have\r\n     the approval of their officers?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not see much of their officers, especially during the\r\n     worst of those outrages; they seemed to be back.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you observe any effort on the part of their officers to\r\n     suppress the murders?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I did not see any where I was first carried; just\r\n     about dusk, all at once several shots were fired just outside.\r\n     The cry was: \"They are shooting the darkey soldiers.\" I heard an\r\n     officer ride up and say: \"Stop that firing; arrest that man.\" I\r\n     suppose it was a rebel officer, but I do not know. It was\r\n     reported to me, at the time, that several darkeys were shot then.\r\n     An officer who stood by me, a prisoner, said that they had been\r\n     shooting them, but that the general had had it stopped.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know of any of our men in the hospital being murdered?\r\n\r\n     A. I do not.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know any thing of the fate of your Quartermaster,\r\n     Lieutenant Akerstrom?\r\n\r\n     A. He was one of the officers who went with me to meet the flag\r\n     of truce the last time. I do not know what became of him; that\r\n     was about the last I saw of him. I heard that he was nailed to a\r\n     board and burned, and I have very good reason for believing that\r\n     was the case, although I did not see it. The First Lieutenant of\r\n     Company D of my regiment says that he has an affidavit to that\r\n     effect of a man who saw it.\r\n\r\nFrancis A. Alexander, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy the Chairman:\r\n\r\n     Q. To what company and regiment do you belong?\r\n\r\n     A. Company C, Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you at Fort Pillow at the fight there?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who commanded your regiment?\r\n\r\n     A. Major Bradford commanded the regiment, and Lieutenant Logan\r\n     commanded our company.\r\n\r\n     Q. By what troops was the Fort attacked?\r\n\r\n     A. Forrest was in command. I saw him.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you know Forrest?\r\n\r\n     A. I saw him there, and they all said it was Forrest. Their own\r\n     men said so.\r\n\r\n     Q. By what troops was the charge made?\r\n\r\n     A. They are Alabamians and Texans.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any thing of a flag of truce?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. State what was done while the flag of truce was in.\r\n\r\n     A. When the flag of truce came up our officers went out and held\r\n     a consultation, and it went back. They came in again with a flag\r\n     of truce; and while they were consulting the second time, their\r\n     troops were coming up a gap or hollow, where we could have cut\r\n     them to pieces. They tried it before, but could not do it. I saw\r\n     them come up there while the flag of truce was in the second\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     Q. That gave them an advantage?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you wounded there?\r\n\r\n     A. Not in the Fort. I was wounded after I left the Fort and was\r\n     going down the hill.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was that before or after the Fort was taken?\r\n\r\n     A. It was afterward.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you have any arms in your hand at the time they shot you?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; I threw my gun away, and started down the hill, and\r\n     got about twenty yards, when I was shot through the calf of the\r\n     leg.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they shoot you more than once?\r\n\r\n     A. No, sir; they shot at me, but did not hit me more than once.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they say why they shot you after you had surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. They said afterward they intended to kill us all for being\r\n     there with their niggers.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were any rebel officers there at the time this shooting was\r\n     going on?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did they try to stop it?\r\n\r\n     A. One or two of them did.\r\n\r\n     Q. What did the rest of them do?\r\n\r\n     A. They kept shouting and hallooing at the men to give no\r\n     quarter. I heard that cry very frequent.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was it the officers that said that?\r\n\r\n     A. I think it was. I think it was them, the way they were going\r\n     on. When our boys were taken prisoners, if anybody came up who\r\n     knew them, they shot them down. As soon as ever they recognized\r\n     them, wherever it was, they shot them.\r\n\r\n     Q. After they had taken them prisoners?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you know any thing about their shooting men in the\r\n     hospitals?\r\n\r\n     A. I know of their shooting negroes in there. I don't know about\r\n     white men.\r\n\r\n     Q. Wounded negro men?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who did that?\r\n\r\n     A. Some of their troops. I don't know which of them. The next\r\n     morning I saw several black people shot that were wounded, and\r\n     some that were not wounded. One was going down the hill before\r\n     me, and the officer made him come back up the hill; and after I\r\n     got in the boat I heard them shooting them.\r\n\r\n     Q. You say you saw them shoot negroes in the hospital the next\r\n     morning?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir; wounded negroes who could not get along; one with\r\n     his leg broke. They came there the next day and shot him.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Ray, sworn and examined.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gooch:\r\n\r\n     Q. To what company and regiment do you belong?\r\n\r\n     A. Company B, Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     Q. Were you at Fort Pillow, when it was attacked?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n     Q. At what time were you wounded?\r\n\r\n     A. I was wounded about two o'clock, after the rebels got in the\r\n     breastworks.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was it before or after you had surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. It was after I threw down my gun, as they all started to run.\r\n\r\n     Q. Will you state what you saw there?\r\n\r\n     A. After I surrendered they shot down a great many white fellows\r\n     right close to me--ten or twelve, I suppose--and a great many\r\n     negroes, too.\r\n\r\n     Q. How long did they keep shooting our men after they\r\n     surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. I heard guns away after dark shooting all that evening,\r\n     somewhere; they kept up a regular fire for a long time, and then\r\n     I heard the guns once in a while.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you see any one shot the next day?\r\n\r\n     A. I did not; I was in a house, and could not get up at all.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you know what became of the Quartermaster of your regiment,\r\n     Lieutenant Akerstrom?\r\n\r\n     A. He was shot by the side of me.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was he killed?\r\n\r\n     A. I thought so at the time; he fell on his face. He was shot in\r\n     the forehead, and I thought he was killed. I heard afterward he\r\n     was not.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did you notice any thing that took place while the flag of\r\n     truce was in?\r\n\r\n     A. I saw the rebels slipping up and getting in the ditch along\r\n     our breastworks.\r\n\r\n     Q. How near did they come up?\r\n\r\n     A. They were right at us; right across from the breastworks. I\r\n     asked them what they were slipping up there for. They made answer\r\n     that they knew their business.\r\n\r\n     Q. Are you sure this was done while the flag of truce was in?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, sir. There was no firing; we could see all around; we\r\n     could see them moving up all around in large force.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was any thing said about it except what you said to the\r\n     rebels?\r\n\r\n     A. I heard all our boys talking about it. I heard some of our\r\n     officers remark, as they saw it coming, that the white flag was a\r\n     bad thing; that they were slipping on us. I believe it was\r\n     Lieutenant Akerstrom that I heard say it was against the rules of\r\n     war for them to come up in that way.\r\n\r\n     Q. To whom did he say that?\r\n\r\n     A. To those fellows coming up; they had officers with them.\r\n\r\n     Q. Was Lieutenant Akerstrom shot before or after he had\r\n     surrendered?\r\n\r\n     A. About two minutes after the flag of truce went back, during\r\n     the action.\r\n\r\n     Q. Do you think of any thing else to state? If so, go on and\r\n     state it.\r\n\r\n     A. I saw a rebel lieutenant take a little negro[114] boy up on\r\n     the horse behind him; and then I heard General Chalmers--I think\r\n     it must have been--tell him to \"Take that negro down and shoot\r\n     him,\" or \"Take him and shoot him,\" and he passed him down and\r\n     shot him.\r\n\r\n     Q. How large was the boy?\r\n\r\n     A. He was not more than eight years old. I heard the lieutenant\r\n     tell the other that the negro was not in the service; that he was\r\n     nothing but a child; that he was pressed and brought in there.\r\n     The other one said; \"Damn the difference; take him down and shoot\r\n     him, or I will shoot him.\" I think it must have been General\r\n     Chalmers. He was a smallish man; he had on a long gray coat, with\r\n     a star on his coat.[115]\r\n\r\nThe country and the world stood aghast. The first account of this\r\nhuman butchery was too much for credence: after a while the truth\r\nbegan to dawn upon the country; and at last the people admitted that\r\nin a Christian land like America a deed so foul--blacker than hell\r\nitself!--had actually been perpetrated. The patience of the North and\r\nthe Union army gave way to bitterest imprecations; the exultation and\r\napplause of the South and Confederate army were succeeded by serious\r\nthoughts and sad reflections. But it is the duty of impartial history\r\nto record that this bloody, sickening affair was not endorsed by all\r\nthe rebels.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated Okalona, Mississippi, June. 14, 1864, to the\r\n\"Atlanta Appeal,\" a rebel gives this endorsement of Forrest's conduct\r\nat Fort Pillow:\r\n\r\n     \"You have heard that our soldiers buried negroes alive at Fort\r\n     Pillow. This is true. At the first fire after Forrest's men\r\n     scaled the walls, many of the negroes threw down their arms and\r\n     fell as if they were dead. They perished in the pretence, and\r\n     could only be restored at the point of the bayonet. To\r\n     resuscitate some of them, more terrified than the rest, they were\r\n     rolled into the trenches made as receptacles for the fallen.\r\n     Vitality was not restored till breathing was obstructed, and then\r\n     the resurrection began. On these facts is based the pretext for\r\n     the crimes committed by Sturgis, Grierson, and their followers.\r\n     You must remember, too, that in the extremity of their terror, or\r\n     for other reasons, the Yankees and negroes in Fort Pillow\r\n     neglected to haul down their flag. In truth, relying upon their\r\n     gun-boats, the officers expected to annihilate our forces after\r\n     we had entered the fortifications. They did not intend to\r\n     surrender.\r\n\r\n     \"A terrible retribution, in any event, has befallen the ignorant,\r\n     deluded Africans.\"\r\n\r\nGen. Forrest was a cold-blooded murderer; a fiend in human form. But\r\nas the grave has opened long since to receive him; and as the cause he\r\nrepresented has perished from the earth, it is enough to let the\r\nrecord stand without comment, and God grant without malice! It is the\r\nduty of history to record that there is to be found no apologist for\r\ncruelties that rebels inflicted upon brave but helpless Black soldiers\r\nduring the war for the extirpation of slavery. The Confederate conduct\r\nat Pillow must remain a foul stain upon the name of the men who fought\r\nto perpetuate human slavery in North America, but failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] New York Tribune, April 14, 1863.\r\n\r\n[113] Rebellion Recs., vol. viii.

The United States\r\nGovernment had survived the shock of the embattled arms of a gigantic\r\nRebellion; had melted the manacles of four million slaves in the fires\r\nof civil war; had made four million bondmen freemen; had wiped slavery\r\nfrom the map of North America; had demonstrated the truth that the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law of the land; and that the United\r\nStates is a NATION, not a league.\r\n\r\nThe brazen-mouthed, shotted cannon were voiceless; a million muskets\r\nand swords hung upon the dusty walls of silent arsenals; and war\r\nceased from the proud altitudes of the mountains of Virginia to where\r\nthe majestic Atlantic washes the shores of the Carolinas. A million\r\nsoldiers in blue melted quietly into the modest garb of citizens. The\r\nmyriad hum of busy shuttles, clanking machinery, and whirling wheels\r\nproclaimed the day of peace. Families and communities were restored\r\nand bound together by the indissoluble, golden ties of domestic\r\ncharities. The war was over; peace had been restored; and the nation\r\nwas cleansed of a plague.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done with the millions of Negroes at the South? The\r\nwar had made them free. That was all. They could leave the plantation.\r\nThey had the right of locomotion; were property no longer. But what a\r\nspectacle! Here were four million human beings without clothing,\r\nshelter, homes, and, alas! most of them without names. The galling\r\nharness of slavery had been cut off of their weary bodies, and like a\r\nworn-out beast of burden they stood in their tracks scarcely able to\r\ngo anywhere. Like men coming from long confinement in a dark dungeon,\r\nthe first rays of freedom blinded their expectant eyes. They were\r\nalmost delirious with joy. The hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows,\r\nthe pain and waiting, the prayers and tears of the cruel years of\r\nslavery gave place to a long train of events that swept them out into\r\nthe rapid current of a life totally different from the checkered\r\ncareer whence they had just emerged. It required time, patience, and\r\nextraordinary wisdom on the part of the Government to solve the\r\nproblem of this people's existence--of this \"Nation born in a day.\"\r\nTheir joy was too full, their peace too profound, and their\r\nthanksgiving too sincere to attract their attention at once to the\r\nvulgar affairs of daily life. One fervent, beautiful psalm of praise\r\nrose from every Negro hut in the South, and swelled in majestic\r\nsweetness until the nation became one mighty temple canopied by the\r\nstars and stripes, and the Constitution as the common altar before\r\nwhose undimmed lights a ransomed race humbly bowed.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated Negroes had no ability, certainly no disposition, to\r\nreason concerning the changes and disasters which had overtaken their\r\nformer masters. The white people of the South were divided into three\r\nclasses. _First_, those who felt that defeat was intolerable, and a\r\nresidence in this country incongenial. They sought the service of the\r\nImperial cause in war-begrimed Mexico; they went to Cuba, Australia,\r\nEgypt, and to Europe. _Second_, those who returned to their homes\r\nafter the \"affair at Appomattox,\" and sitting down under the\r\nportentous clouds of defeat, refused to take any part in the\r\nrehabilitation of their States. _Third_, those who accepted the\r\nsituation and stood ready to aid in the work of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn the unsettled condition of affairs at the close of hostilities, as\r\nthere was no legal State governments at the South, necessity and\r\nprudence suggested the temporary policy of dividing the South into\r\nmilitary districts. A provisional military government in the conquered\r\nStates was to pursue a pacific, protective, helpful policy. The people\r\nof both races were to be fed and clothed. Schools were to be\r\nestablished; agriculture and industry encouraged. Courts were to be\r\nestablished of competent jurisdiction to hear and decide cases among\r\nthe people. Such a government while military in name was patriarchal\r\nin spirit. As early as the spring of 1865, before the war was over, an\r\nact was passed by Congress providing for the destitute of the South.\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A BUREAU FOR THE RELIEF OF FREEDMEN AND\r\n     REFUGEES.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in Congress assembled_, That there is\r\n     hereby established in the War Department, to continue during the\r\n     present war of rebellion, and for one year thereafter, a Bureau\r\n     of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, to which shall be\r\n     committed, as hereinafter provided, the supervision and\r\n     management of all abandoned lands, and the control of all\r\n     subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel States, or\r\n     from any district of country within the territory embraced in the\r\n     operations of the army, under such rules and regulations as may\r\n     be prescribed by the head of the bureau and approved by the\r\n     President. The said bureau shall be under the management and\r\n     control of a commissioner, to be appointed by the President, by\r\n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate, whose compensation\r\n     shall be three thousand dollars per annum, and such number of\r\n     clerks as may be assigned to him by the Secretary of War, not\r\n     exceeding one chief clerk, two of the fourth class, two of the\r\n     third class, three of the second class, and five of the first\r\n     class. And the commissioner and all persons appointed under this\r\n     act shall, before entering upon their duties, take the oath of\r\n     office prescribed in an act entitled, 'An act to prescribe an\r\n     oath of office, and for other purposes,' approved July 2, 1862.\r\n     And the commissioners and the chief clerk shall, before entering\r\n     upon their duties, give bonds to the Treasurer of the United\r\n     States, the former in the sum of fifty thousand dollars, and the\r\n     latter in the sum of ten thousand dollars, conditioned for the\r\n     faithful discharge of their duties respectively, with securities\r\n     to be approved as sufficient by the attorney general, which bonds\r\n     shall be filed in the office of the First Comptroller of the\r\n     Treasury, to be by him put in suit for the benefit of any injured\r\n     party, upon any breach of the conditions thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the Secretary of War\r\n     may direct such issues of provisions, clothing, and fuel as he\r\n     may deem needful for the immediate and temporary shelter and\r\n     supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, and\r\n     their wives and children, under such rules and regulations as he\r\n     may direct.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That the President may, by\r\n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint an\r\n     assistant commissioner for each of the States declared to be in\r\n     insurrection, not exceeding ten in number, who shall, under the\r\n     direction of the commissioner, aid in the execution of the\r\n     provisions of this act, and he shall give a bond to the Treasurer\r\n     of the United States in the sum of twenty thousand dollars, in\r\n     the form and manner prescribed in the first section of this act.\r\n     Each of said assistant commissioners shall receive an annual\r\n     salary of two thousand and five hundred dollars, in full\r\n     compensation for all his services. And any military officer may\r\n     be detailed and assigned to duty under this act without increase\r\n     of pay or allowances. The commissioner shall, before the\r\n     commencement of each regular session of Congress, make full\r\n     report of his proceedings, with exhibits of the state of his\r\n     accounts, to the President, who shall communicate the same to\r\n     Congress, and shall also make special reports whenever required\r\n     to do so by the President, or either house of Congress. And the\r\n     assistant commissioners shall make quarterly reports of their\r\n     proceedings to the commissioner, and also such other special\r\n     reports as from time to time may be required.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That the commissioner,\r\n     under the direction of the President, shall have authority to set\r\n     apart for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen such tracts of\r\n     land, within the insurrectionary States, as shall have been\r\n     abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired\r\n     title by confiscation, or sale, or otherwise. And to every male\r\n     citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there shall\r\n     be assigned not more than forty acres of such land, and the\r\n     person to whom it is so assigned shall be protected in the use\r\n     and enjoyment of the land for the term of three years, at an\r\n     annual rent not exceeding six per centum upon the value of said\r\n     land as it was appraised by the State authorities in the year\r\n     1860, for the purpose of taxation, and in case no such appraisal\r\n     can be found, then the rental shall be based upon the estimated\r\n     value of the land in said year, to be ascertained in such manner\r\n     as the commissioner may, by regulation, prescribe. At the end of\r\n     said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any\r\n     parcels so assigned may purchase the land and receive such title\r\n     thereto as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor\r\n     the value of the land, as ascertained and fixed for the purpose\r\n     of determining the annual rent as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That all acts and parts of\r\n     acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby\r\n     repealed.\r\n\r\n      \"ROBERT C. SCHENCK,                 HENRY WILSON,\r\n      \"GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,                JAMES HARLAN,\r\n      \"JAMES S. ROLLINS,                  W. T. WILLEY,\r\n     \"_Managers on part of House._      _Managers on part of Senate._\"\r\n\r\nTo have subjected the late rebellious States to military rule for a\r\nstated term of years, say a decade or a generation, would have given\r\nforce to the hasty statement of rebels and their sympathizers in the\r\ncourts of Europe. It was charged that the United States Government\r\nfought to subjugate the Confederate States. The United States did not\r\n\"begin it,\" and did not intend, at any time, to lay the mailed hand of\r\nmilitary power against the throat of the rights of loyal citizens or\r\nloyal States. The _sine qua non_ of reconstruction was _loyalty to the\r\nFederal Government_. But while this idea was next to the heart of the\r\nGovernment, the sudden and horrible taking off of Abraham Lincoln\r\ndiscovered many master-builders, who built not well or wisely. The\r\nearly education of Andrew Johnson was not in line with the work of\r\nreconstruction. His sympathies were with the South in spite of his\r\nposition and circumstances. The friends of his early political life\r\nwere more potent than the friends of a sound, sensible, and loyal\r\npolicy upon which to build the shattered governments of the South. And\r\nby indicating and advocating a policy at variance with the logical\r\nevents of the war, he was guilty of a political crime, and did the\r\nentire nation an irreparable injury.\r\n\r\nCongress seemed to be unequal to the task of perfecting a proper plan\r\nfor reconstructing the Southern States. To couple general amnesty to\r\nthe rebels with suffrage to the Negroes was a most fatal policy. It\r\nhas been shown that there was but one class of white men in the South\r\nfriendly to reconstruction,--numerically, small; and mentally, weak.\r\nBut it was thought best to do this. To a triple element Congress\r\ncommitted the work of reconstruction. The \"_Scalawag_,\" the\r\n\"_Carpet-bagger_,\" and the _Negro_. Who were this trio? The scalawag\r\nwas the native white man who made up the middle class of the South;\r\nthe planter above, the Negro below. And between this upper and nether\r\nmillstone he was destined to be ground to powder, under the old\r\nregime. A \"nigger-driver,\" without schools, social position, or money,\r\nhe was \"the poor white trash\" of the South. He was loyal during the\r\nwar, because in the triumph of the Confederacy, with slavery as its\r\ncorner-stone, he saw no hope for his condition. Those of them who\r\nfought under the rebel flag were unwilling conscripts. They had no\r\nqualifications for governing--except that they were _loyal_; and this\r\nwas of no more use to them in this great work, than _piety_ in the\r\npulpit when the preacher cannot repeat the Lord's prayer without\r\nbiting his tongue. The carpet-baggers ran all the way from \"good to\r\nmiddling.\" Some went South with fair ability and good morals, where\r\nthey lost the latter article and never found it; while many more went\r\nSouth to get all they could and keep all they got. The Negro could\r\nboast of numerical strength only. The scalawag managed the Negro, the\r\nlatter did the voting, while the carpet-bagger held the offices. And\r\nwhen there were \"more stalls than horses\" the Negroes and scalawags\r\noccasionally got an office.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were still in a swoon.\r\n\r\nThe States were reconstructed, after a manner, and the governments\r\nwent forward.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Gen. U. S. Grant carried these States. It was like the handle\r\non a jug, all on one side. The rebels took no part; but after a while\r\na gigantic Ku Klux conspiracy was discovered. This organization sought\r\nto obstruct the courts, harass the Negroes, and cripple local\r\ngovernments. It spread terror through the South and made a political\r\ngraveyard of startling dimensions. The writ of _habeas corpus_ was\r\nsuspended; arrests made, trials and convictions secured, and the\r\npenitentiary at Albany, New York, crowded with the enemies of law and\r\norder. A subsidence followed, and the scalawag-carpetbag-Negro\r\ngovernments began a fresh existence.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Gen. Grant carried the Southern States again, meeting with but\r\nlittle resistance. In Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina there\r\nwere Negro lieutenant-governors. The Negroes were learning rapidly the\r\nlesson of rotation in office, and demanded recognition. Alabama,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, were\r\nrepresented, in part, by Negroes in the National House of\r\nRepresentatives, and Mississippi in the Senate as well. Both branches\r\nof the Legislatures of all the Southern States contained Negro\r\nmembers; while many of the most important and lucrative offices in\r\nthe States were held by Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe wine cup, the gaming-table, and the parlors of strange women\r\ncharmed many of these men to the neglect of important public duties.\r\nThe bonded indebtedness of these States began to increase, the State\r\npaper to depreciate, the burden of taxation to grow intolerable, bad\r\nlaws to find their way into the statute-books, interest in education\r\nand industry to decline, the farm Negroes to grow idle and gravitate\r\nto the infectious skirts of large cities, and the whole South went\r\nfrom bad to worse.\r\n\r\nThe hand of revenge reached for the shot-gun, and before its deadly\r\npresence white leaders were intimidated, driven out, or destroyed.\r\nBefore 1875 came, the white element in the Republican party at the\r\nSouth was reduced to a mere shadow of its former self. Thus abandoned,\r\nthe Negro needed the presence of the United States army while he\r\nvoted, held office, and drew his salary. But even the army lacked the\r\npower to inject life into the collapsed governments at the South.\r\n\r\nThe mistake of reconstruction was twofold: on the part of the Federal\r\nGovernment, in committing the destinies of the Southern States to\r\nhands so feeble; and on the part of the South, in that its best men,\r\ninstead of taking a lively interest in rebuilding the governments they\r\nhad torn down, allowed them to be constructed with untempered mortar.\r\nNeither the South nor the Government could say: \"Thou canst not say I\r\ndid it: shake not thy gory locks at me.\" Both were culpable, and both\r\nhave suffered the pangs of remorse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] I am preparing a History of the Reconstruction of the Late\r\nConfederate States, 1865-1880. Hence I shall not enter into a thorough\r\ntreatment of the subject in this work. It will follow this work, and\r\ncomprise two volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n     THE APPARENT IDLENESS OF THE NEGRO SPORADIC RATHER THAN\r\n     GENERIC.--HE QUIETLY SETTLES DOWN TO WORK.--THE GOVERNMENT MAKES\r\n     AMPLE PROVISIONS FOR HIS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT.--THE\r\n     MARVELLOUS PROGRESS MADE BY THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH IN\r\n     EDUCATION.--EARLIEST SCHOOL FOR FREEDMEN AT FORTRESS MONROE IN\r\n     1861.--THE RICHMOND INSTITUTE FOR COLORED YOUTH.--THE UNLIMITED\r\n     DESIRE OF THE NEGROES TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION.--GENERAL ORDER\r\n     ORGANIZING A \"BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED\r\n     LANDS.\"--GEN.

The poor, deluded,\r\nmisguided, confiding Negro finished his long holiday at last, and\r\nturning from the dream of \"forty acres and a mule,\" settled down to\r\nthe stubborn realities of his new life of duties, responsibilities,\r\nand privileges. His idleness was sporadic, not generic,--it was simply\r\nreaction. He had worked faithfully, incessantly for two centuries and\r\na half; had enriched the South with the sweat of his brow; and in two\r\nwars had baptized the soil with his patriotic blood. And when the year\r\nof jubilee came he enjoyed himself right royally.\r\n\r\nThis disposition to frolic on the part of the Negro gave rise to grave\r\nconcern among his friends, and was promptly accepted as conclusive\r\nproof of his unfitness for the duties of a freeman by his enemies. But\r\nhe soon dispelled the fears of his friends and disarmed the prejudices\r\nof his foes.\r\n\r\nAs already shown there was no provision made for the education of the\r\nNegro before the war; every thing had been done to keep him in\r\nignorance. To emancipate 4,000,000 of slaves and absorb them into the\r\npolitical life of the government without detriment to both was indeed\r\na formidable undertaking. Republics gain their strength and\r\nperpetuity from the self-governing force in the people; and in order\r\nto be self-governing a people must be educated. Moreover, all good\r\nlaws that are cheerfully obeyed are but the emphatic expression of\r\npublic sentiment. Where the great majority of the people are kept in\r\nignorance the tendency is toward the production of two other classes,\r\naristocrats and political \"Herders.\" The former seek to get as far\r\nfrom \"the common herd\" as possible, while the latter bid off the\r\nrights of the poor and ignorant to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nIt was quite appropriate for the Government to make speedy provision\r\nfor plying the mass of ignorant Negroes with school influences. And\r\nthe liberality of the provision was equalled by the eagerness of the\r\nNegroes to learn. Nor should history fail to record that the\r\nestablishment of schools for freedmen by the Government was the\r\nnoblest, most sensible act it could have done. What the Negroes have\r\naccomplished through these schools is the marvel of the age.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of May, 1865, Major-Gen. O. O. Howard was appointed\r\nCommissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. He gave great attention to the\r\nsubject of education; and after planting schools for the freedmen\r\nthroughout a great portion of the South, in 1870--five years after the\r\nwork was begun--he made a report. It was full of interest. In five\r\nyears there were 4,239 schools established, 9,307 teachers employed,\r\nand 247,333 pupils instructed. In 1868 the average attendance was\r\n89,396; but in 1870 it was 91,398, or 79-3/4 per cent. of the total\r\nnumber enrolled. The emancipated people sustained 1,324 schools\r\nthemselves, and owned 592 school buildings. The Freedmen's Bureau\r\nfurnished 654 buildings for school purposes. The wonderful progress\r\nthey made from year to year, in scholarship, may be fairly judged by\r\nthe following, corresponding with the half year in 1869:\r\n\r\n                                         JULY, 1869.    JULY, 1870.\r\n  Advanced readers                         43,746         43,540\r\n  Geography                                36,992         39,321\r\n  Arithmetic                               51,172         52,417\r\n  Writing                                  53,606         58,034\r\n  Higher branches                           7,627          9,690\r\n\r\nThere were 74 high and normal schools, with 8,147 students; and 61\r\nindustrial schools, with 1,750 students in attendance. In doing this\r\ngreat work--for buildings, repairs, teachers, etc.,--$1,002,896.07\r\nwas expended. Of this sum the _freedmen raised_ $200,000.00! This was\r\nconclusive proof that emancipation was no mistake. Slavery was a\r\ntwofold cross of woe to the land. It did not only degrade the slave,\r\nbut it blunted the sensibilities, and, by its terrible weight, carried\r\ndown under the slimy rocks of society some of the best white people in\r\nthe South. Like a cankerous malady its venom has touched almost every\r\nside of American life.\r\n\r\nThe white race is in a constant and almost overpowering relation to\r\nthe other races upon this continent. It is the duty of this great\r\ntotality of intellectual life and force, to supply adequate facilities\r\nfor the education of the less intelligent and less fortunate. Of every\r\nten thousand (10,000) inhabitants there are:\r\n\r\n                        WHITE.   COLORED.   CHINESE.   INDIANS.\r\n  In the States         8,711      1,269         15          5\r\n  In the Territories    8,711      1,017        158        114\r\n  In the whole Union    8,711      1,266         16          7\r\n\r\nWhen we turn our attention to the Southern States, we shall find that\r\nthe white people are in excess of the Colored as follows:\r\n\r\n                     MAJORITY.\r\n  Alabama              45,874\r\n  Arkansas            239,946\r\n  Delaware             79,427\r\n  Florida               4,368\r\n  Georgia              93,774\r\n  Kentucky            876,442\r\n  Maryland            430,106\r\n  Missouri          1,485,075\r\n  North Carolina      286,820\r\n  Tennessee           613,788\r\n  Texas               311,225\r\n  Virginia            199,248\r\n  West Virginia       406,043\r\n\r\nwhile the Colored people are in excess in only three States, having\r\nover the whites the following majorities:\r\n\r\n                     MAJORITY.\r\n  Louisiana             2,145\r\n  South Carolina      126,147\r\n  Mississippi          61,305\r\n\r\nThis leaves the whites in these sixteen States in a majority of\r\n4,882,539, over the Colored people. There are more than two whites to\r\nevery Colored in the entire population in these States.\r\n\r\nGroup the States and territories into three geographical classes, and\r\ndesignate them as Northern, Pacific, and Southern. The first may\r\ncomprise all the \"free States,\" where slavery never existed; put in\r\nthe second the three Pacific States and all the territories, except\r\nthe District of Columbia; and in the third gather all the \"slave\r\nStates\" and the District. Now then, in the Northern class, out of\r\nevery 14 persons who can neither read nor write, 13 are white. In the\r\nPacific class, out of every 23 who can neither read nor write, 20 are\r\nwhite. In the Southern class, out of every 42 who can neither read nor\r\nwrite, 15 are white. Thus it can be seen that the white illiterates of\r\nthe United States outnumber those of all the other races together. It\r\nmight be profitable to the gentlemen who, upon every convenient\r\noccasion, rail about \"the deplorable ignorance of the blacks,\" to look\r\nup this question a little![117]\r\n\r\nThe Colored people have made wonderful progress in educational matters\r\nsince the war. Take a few States for examples of what they are doing.\r\nIn Georgia, in 1860, there were 458,540 slaves. In 1870 there were 87\r\nprivate schools, 79 teachers with 3,021 pupils. Of other schools, more\r\npublic in character, there were 221, with an attendance of 11,443\r\npupils. In 1876 the Colored school population of this State was\r\n48,643, with 879 schools; and with 55,268 pupils in public and private\r\nschools in 1877.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, in 1874, there were 63,415 Colored children\r\nattending the public schools; in 1876 there were 70,802, or an\r\nincrease of 7,387.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, in 1870, there were 39,000 Colored pupils in the schools,\r\nwhich were few in number. In 1874 there were 54,941 pupils; in 1876\r\nthere were 62,178, or again of 7,237. In 1874 there were 539 teachers;\r\nin 1876 there were 636, or an increase of 97. In 1874 there were 1,064\r\nschools for Colored youth; in 1876 there were 1,181, or an increase of\r\n117.\r\n\r\nIn the District of Columbia, in 1871, there were 4,986 Colored\r\nchildren in 69 schools, with 71 teachers. In 1876, of Colored schools\r\nin the District, 62 were primary, 13 grammar, and 1 high, with an\r\nenrolment of 5,454.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics exhibit the wonderful progress the Colored\r\npeople of the South have made during the brief period of their freedom\r\nin the department of education. These tables come as near showing the\r\nextent, the miraculous magnitude of the work, as is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF EDUCATION AT THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n_Table showing comparative population and enrolment of the White and\r\nColored races in the public schools of the recent slave States, with\r\ntotal annual expenditure for the same in 1879._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         White.

The Colored\r\npublic schools of those States in which no separate reports are made,\r\nhowever, are not included; and the Colored pupils in white schools\r\ncannot be enumerated.\r\n\r\nVirginia has done more intelligent and effective educational work than\r\nany other State in the South. The Hon. W. H. Ruffner has no equal in\r\nAmerica as a superintendent of public instruction. He is the Horace\r\nMann of the South.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the reports of the Freedmen's Bureau that the earliest\r\nschool for freedmen was opened by the American Missionary Association\r\nat Fortress Monroe, September, 1861; and before the close of the war,\r\nHampton and Norfolk were leading points where educational operations\r\nwere conducted; but after the cessation of hostilities, teachers were\r\nsent from Northern States, and schools for freedmen were opened in\r\nall parts of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Colored normal school at Richmond, and the one at Hampton, were\r\ncommenced in 1867 and 1868. Captain C. S. Schaeffer, Bureau officer at\r\nChristiansburg, commenced his remarkable efforts about the same time\r\nin Montgomery County.\r\n\r\nSchool superintendents for each State were appointed by the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, July 12, 1865, and a general superintendent, or \"Inspector of\r\nSchools,\" was appointed in September, 1865. These superintendents were\r\ninstructed \"to work as much as possible in conjunction with State\r\nofficers, who may have had school matters in charge, and to take\r\ncognizance of all that was being done to educate refugees and\r\nfreedmen.\" In 1866 an act of Congress was passed enlarging the powers\r\nof the Bureau, and partially consolidating all the societies and\r\nagencies engaged in educational work among the freedmen. In this bill\r\n$521,000 were appropriated for carrying on the work, to which was to\r\nbe added forfeitures of property owned by the Confederate Government.\r\nUp to January 1, 1868, over a million of dollars was expended for\r\nschool purposes among the freedmen. In Virginia 12,450 pupils are\r\nreported for 1867. Mr. Manly, the Virginia superintendent, reports the\r\nfollowing statistics for the year 1867-8: Schools, 230; teachers, 290;\r\npupils enrolled, 14,300; in average attendance, 10,320; the cost as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  From Charity        $78,766\r\n  From the Freedmen    10,789\r\n  From the Bureau      42,844\r\n                     --------\r\n  Total Cost         $132,399\r\n\r\nThe amount raised from freedmen was in the form of small tuition fees\r\nof from ten to fifty cents a month--a system approved by Mr. Manly.\r\n\r\nIn the final report to the Freedmen's Bureau, made July 1, 1870, the\r\nVirginia statistics are: Schools, 344; teachers, 412; pupils, 18,234;\r\nthe average attendance, 78 per cent. This year the freedmen paid\r\n$12,286.50 for tuition. Mr. C. S. Schaeffer and Mr. Samuel H. Jones,\r\nwho remained in Virginia as teachers--the former still at\r\nChristiansburg, and the latter, until very lately, at Danville--both\r\nacted as assistants to Mr. Manly. A considerable number of\r\nschool-houses were built in Virginia by the Bureau, including the\r\nsplendid normal and high school building in Richmond, erected and\r\nequipped at a cost of $25,000, and afterward turned over to the city.\r\nAfter the conclusion of his superintendency, Mr. Manly continued for\r\nseveral years to do valuable service as principal of this school.\r\n\r\n     \"The Freedmen's Bureau ceased its educational operations in the\r\n     summer of 1870, and in the autumn of that year our State public\r\n     schools were opened. So that, counting from the beginning of the\r\n     mission school at Hampton in 1861, there has been an unbroken\r\n     succession of schools for freedmen in one region for nineteen\r\n     years; and at a number of leading points in the State--such as\r\n     Norfolk, Richmond, Petersburg, Danville, Charlottesville,\r\n     Christiansburg, etc.--an unbroken line of schools for fourteen\r\n     years and upwards. These efforts, however, of the Federal\r\n     Government toward educating the rising generation of Colored\r\n     people, could not have been designed as any thing more than an\r\n     experiment, intended first to test and then to stimulate the\r\n     appetite of those people for learning. And in this view they were\r\n     entirely successful in both particulars; for the children flocked\r\n     to the schools, attended well, made good progress in knowledge,\r\n     and paid a surprising amount of money for tuition.\r\n\r\n     \"But, considered as a serious attempt to educate the children of\r\n     the freedmen, the movement was wholly inadequate, even when\r\n     contrasted with the operations of our imperfect State system. The\r\n     largest number enrolled in the schools supported by the combined\r\n     efforts of the Bureau, the charitable societies, and the tuition\r\n     fees, was 18,234, in 1870. The next year we had in our public\r\n     schools considerably over double this number, and an annual\r\n     increase ever since, always excepting those two dark years\r\n     (_tenebricosus and tenebricosissimus_), 1878 and 1879.\"[118]\r\n\r\n     \"Two institutions for the education of the Colored race, founded\r\n     before the beginning of our school, system, are still in\r\n     successful operation, but remain independent of our school\r\n     system. One of them has some connection with the State by reason\r\n     of the receipt of one-third of the proceeds of the Congressional\r\n     land-grant for education. I refer to the well-known Hampton\r\n     Normal and Agricultural Institute, and the Richmond Colored\r\n     Institute. Nothing need be said in reference to the Hampton\r\n     School, except that its numbers and usefulness are constantly\r\n     increasing under the continued superintendence of the indomitable\r\n     Gen. Armstrong. Its reports, which are published every year as\r\n     State documents in connection with the Report of this department,\r\n     are so accessible to all, that I will only repeat here the\r\n     testimony often given, that in my opinion this is the most\r\n     valuable of all the schools opened on this Continent for Colored\r\n     people. Its most direct benefit is in furnishing to our State\r\n     schools a much-needed annual contribution of teachers; and\r\n     teachers so good and acceptable that the demand for them is\r\n     always much greater than the supply.\r\n\r\n     \"The Richmond Institute has more of a theological intent, but it\r\n     also sends out many good teachers. As a school it has prospered\r\n     steadily under the excellent management of the Rev. C. H. Corey,\r\n     D.D.; and it will soon be accommodated in a large new and\r\n     handsome building. Both these institutions receive their support\r\n     chiefly from the North.\"[119]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the tables we give refer only to the work done in\r\neducating the Negro in the Southern States. Much has been done in the\r\nNorthern States, but in quite a different manner. The work of\r\neducation for the Negro at the South had to begin at the bottom. There\r\nwere no schools at all for this people; and hence the work began with\r\nthe alphabet. And there could be no classification of the scholars.\r\nAll the way from six to sixty the pupils ranged in age; and even some\r\nwho had given slavery a century of their existence--mothers and\r\nfathers in Israel--crowded the schools established for their race.\r\nSome ministers of the Gospel after a half century of preaching entered\r\nschool to learn how to spell out the names of the twelve Apostles. Old\r\nwomen who had lived out their threescore years and ten prayed that\r\nthey might live to spell out the Lord's prayer, while the modest\r\nrequest of many departing patriarchs was that they might recognize the\r\nLord's name in print. The sacrifices they made for themselves and\r\nchildren challenged the admiration of even their former owners.\r\n\r\nThe unlettered Negroes of the South carried into the school-room an\r\ninborn love of music, an excellent memory, and a good taste for the\r\nelegant--almost grandiloquent--in speech, gorgeous in imagery, and\r\nenergetic in narration; their apostrophe and simile were wonderful.\r\nGeography and history furnished great attractions, and they developed\r\nability to master them. In mathematics they did not do so well, on\r\naccount of the lack of training to think consecutively and\r\nmethodically. It is a mistake to believe this a mental infirmity of\r\nthe race; for a very large number of the students in college at the\r\npresent time do as well in mathematics, geometry, trigonometry,\r\nmensuration, and conic sections as the white students of the same\r\nage; and some of them excel in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Colored students in the Southern schools qualify\r\nthemselves to teach and preach; while the remainder go to law and\r\nmedicine. Few educated Colored men ever return to agricultural life.\r\nThere are two reasons for this: First, reaction. There is an erroneous\r\nidea among some of these young men that labor is dishonorable; that an\r\neducated man should never work with his hands. Second, some of them\r\nbelieve that a profession gives a man consequence. Such silly ideas\r\nshould be abandoned--they must be abandoned! There is a great demand\r\nfor educated farmers and laborers. It requires an intelligent man to\r\nconduct a farm successfully, to sell the products of his labor, and to\r\nbuy the necessaries of life. No profession can furnish a man with\r\nbrains, or provide him a garment of respectability. Every man must\r\nfurnish brains and tact to make his calling and election sure in this\r\nworld, as well as by faith in the world to come. Unfortunately there\r\nhas been but little opportunity for Colored men or boys to get\r\nemployment at the trades: but prejudice is gradually giving way to\r\nreason and common-sense; and the day is not distant when the Negro\r\nwill have a free field in this country, and will then be responsible\r\nfor what he is not that is good. The need of the hour is a varied\r\nemployment for the Negro race on this continent. There is more need of\r\neducated mechanics, civil engineers, surveyors, printers, artificers,\r\ninventors, architects, builders, merchants, and bankers than there is\r\ndemand for lawyers, physicians, or clergymen. Waiters, barbers,\r\nporters, boot-blacks, hack-drivers, grooms, and private valets find\r\nbut little time for the expansion of their intellects. These places\r\nare not dishonorable; but what we say is, _there is room at the top_!\r\nAn industrial school, something like Cooper Institute, situated\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia, where Colored boys and girls could\r\nlearn the trades that race prejudice denies them now, would be the\r\ngrandest institution of modern times. It matters not how many million\r\ndollars are given toward the education of the Negro; so long as he is\r\ndeprived of the privilege of learning and plying the trades and\r\nmechanic arts his education will injure rather than help him.[120] We\r\nwould rather see a Negro boy build an engine than take the highest\r\nprize in Yale or Harvard.\r\n\r\nIt is quite difficult to get at a clear idea of what has been done in\r\nthe Northern States toward the education of the Colored people. In\r\nnearly all the States on the borders of the Ohio and Mississippi\r\nrivers \"Colored schools\" still exist; and in many instances are kept\r\nalive through the spirit of the self-seeking of a few Colored persons\r\nwho draw salaries in lieu of their continuance. They should be\r\nabolished, and will be, as surely as heat follows light and the rising\r\nof the sun. In the New England, Middle, and extreme Western States,\r\nwith the exception of Kansas, separate schools do not exist. The doors\r\nof all colleges, founded and conducted by the white people in the\r\nNorth, are open to the Colored people who desire to avail themselves\r\nof an academic education. At the present time there are one hundred\r\nand sixty-nine Colored students in seventy white colleges in the\r\nNorthern States; and the presidents say they are doing well.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands_ was\r\nestablished in the spring of 1865 to meet the state of affairs\r\nincident upon the closing scenes of the great civil war. The Act\r\ncreating the Bureau was approved and became a law on the 3d of March,\r\n1865. The Bureau was to be under the management of the War Department,\r\nand its officers were liable for the property placed in their hands\r\nunder the revised regulations of the army. In May, 1865, the following\r\norder was issued from the War Department appointing Major-Gen. O. O.\r\nHoward Commissioner of the Bureau:\r\n\r\n                        \"[GENERAL ORDERS NO. 91.]\r\n\r\n                         \"WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE, }\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, May 12, 1865.                  }\r\n\r\n     \"Order Organizing Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned\r\n                            \"Lands.\r\n\r\n     \"I.

Rations were\r\nissued, clothing distributed, and lands apportioned to the needy and\r\nworthy.\r\n\r\nFrom May 30, 1865, to November 20, 1865, inclusive, this Bureau\r\nfurnished transportation for 1,946 freedmen, and issued to this class\r\nof persons in ten States, 1,030,100 rations.\r\n\r\n     \"Congress, when it created the bureau, made no appropriation to\r\n     defray its expenses; it has, however, received funds from\r\n     miscellaneous sources, as the following report will show:\r\n\r\n     \"In several of the States, Virginia, North and South Carolina,\r\n     Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas,\r\n     Missouri, and the District of Columbia, the interests of the\r\n     freedmen were under the control of military officers assigned by\r\n     the War Department previous to the organization of this bureau.\r\n     Their accounts became naturally absorbed in the accounts of the\r\n     bureau, and the following report embraces all the receipts and\r\n     expenditures in all States now under control of the bureau since\r\n     January 1, 1865:\"\r\n\r\n          RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n          Amount on hand January 1, 1865, and received since, to October\r\n          31, 1865:\r\n\r\n          From freedmen's fund                         $466,028 35\r\n          From retained bounties                        115,236 49\r\n          For clothing, fuel, and subsistence             7,704 21\r\n          Farms                                          76,709 12\r\n          From rents of buildings                        56,012 42\r\n          From rents of lands                           125,521 00\r\n          From Quartermaster's department                12,200 00\r\n          From conscript fund                            13,498 11\r\n          From schools (tax and tuition)                 34,486 58\r\n                                                        ----------\r\n          Total received                                907,396 28\r\n\r\n          EXPENDITURES.\r\n\r\n          Freedmen's fund                                $8,009 14\r\n          Clothing, fuel, and subsistence                75,504 05\r\n          Farms                                          40,069 71\r\n          Household furniture                             2,904 90\r\n          Rents of buildings                             11,470 88\r\n          Labor (by freedmen and other employés)        237,097 62\r\n          Repairs of buildings                           19,518 46\r\n          Contingent expenses                            46,328 07\r\n          Rents of lands                                    300 00\r\n          Internal revenue                                1,379 86\r\n          Conscript fund                                  6,515 37\r\n          Transportation                                  1,445 51\r\n          Schools                                        27,819 60\r\n                                                        ----------\r\n          Total expended                                478,363 17\r\n\r\n\r\n          RECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n          Total amount received                        $907,396 28\r\n          Total amount expended                         478,363 17\r\n                                                       -----------\r\n          Balance on hand October 31, 1865              429,033 11\r\n          Deduct the amount held as retained bounties   115,236 49\r\n\r\n          Balance on hand October 31, 1865, available\r\n          to meet liabilities                           313,796 62[121]\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the Government to help the freedmen on to their\r\nfeet; to give them a start in the race of self-support and manhood.\r\nThey received such assistance as was given them with thankful hearts,\r\nand were not long in placing themselves upon a safe foundation for\r\ntheir new existence. Out of a population of 350,000 in North Carolina\r\nonly 5,000 were receiving aid from the Government in the fall of 1865.\r\nEach month witnessed a wonderful reduction of the rations issued to\r\nthe freedmen. In the month of August, 1865, Gen. C. B. Fisk had\r\nreduced the number of freedmen receiving rations from 3,785 to 2,984,\r\nin Kentucky. In the same month, in Mississippi, Gen. Samuel Thomas, of\r\nthe 64th U. S. C. I., had reduced the number of persons receiving\r\nrations to 669. In his report for 1865, Gen. Thomas said:\r\n\r\n     \"The freedmen working land assigned them at Davis's Bend, Camp\r\n     Hawley, near Vicksburg, De Soto Point, opposite, and at\r\n     Washington, near Natchez, are all doing well. These crops are\r\n     maturing fast; as harvest time approaches, I reduce the number of\r\n     rations issued and compel them to rely on their own resources. At\r\n     least 10,000 bales of cotton will be raised by these people, who\r\n     are conducting cotton crops on their own account. Besides this\r\n     cotton, they have gardens and corn enough to furnish bread for\r\n     their families and food for their stock till harvest time\r\n     returns. * * * A more industrious, energetic body of citizens\r\n     does not exist than can be seen at the colonies now.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the industry of the freed people Gen. Thomas added: \"I\r\nhave lately visited a large portion of the State, and find it in much\r\nbetter condition than I expected. In the eastern part fine crops of\r\ngrain are growing; the negroes are at home working quietly; they have\r\ncontracted with their old masters at fair wages; all seem to accept\r\nthe change without a shock.\"\r\n\r\nFrom June 1, 1865, to September 1, 1866, the Freedmen's Bureau issued\r\nto the freed people of the South 8,904,451½ rations, and was able to\r\nmake the following financial showing of the Refugees' and Freedmen's\r\nfund.

The noble and wise Gen. Saxton answered the question and met\r\nthe need of the hour by establishing a Military Savings Bank at\r\nBeaufort, South Carolina. Soldiers under his command were thus enabled\r\nto husband their funds. Gen. Butler followed in this good work, and\r\nestablished a similar one at Norfolk, Virginia. These banks did an\r\nexcellent work, and so favorably impressed many of the friends of the\r\nNegro that a plan for a Freedman's Savings Bank and Trust Company was\r\nat once projected. Before the spring campaign of 1865 opened up, the\r\nplan was presented to Congress; a bill introduced creating such a\r\nbank, was passed and signed by President Lincoln on the 3d of March.\r\nThe following is the Act:\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT TO INCORPORATE THE FREEDMAN'S SAVINGS AND TRUST \"COMPANY.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in Congress assembled:_ That Peter\r\n     Cooper, William C.

Each report was more cheering than the preceding\r\none. The deposits were generally made by day laborers, house servants,\r\nfarmers, mechanics, and washerwomen. Two facts were established, viz.:\r\nthat the Negroes of the South were working; and that they were saving\r\ntheir earnings. Northern as well as Southern whites were agreeably\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nBut bad management doomed the institution to irreparable ruin. The\r\ncharter was violated in the establishment of branch banks; \"persons\r\nwho were never held in bondage and their descendants\" were allowed to\r\ndeposit funds in the bank; money was loaned upon valueless securities\r\nand meaningless collaterals, and in the fall of 1873, having been kept\r\nopen for a long time on money borrowed on collateral securities\r\nbelonging to its customers, the bank failed!\r\n\r\nDuring the brief period of its existence about $57,000,000 had been\r\ndeposited. The liabilities of the institution at the time of the\r\nfailure, as corrected to date, were $3,037,483, of which $73,774.34\r\nwere special deposits and preferred claims. The number of open\r\naccounts at the time of the failure were 62,000. The _nominal_ assets\r\nat the time of the failure were $2,693,093.20. And in the almost\r\ninterminable list of over-drafts amounting to $55,567.63, there\r\nappeared but one solitary surety!\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of June, 1874, Congress passed an act permitting the very\r\nmen who had destroyed the bank to nominate three Commissioners, who,\r\nupon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, should wind up the\r\naffairs of this insolvent institution. Section 7 of the Act reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 7. That whenever it shall be deemed advisable by the\r\n     trustees of said corporation to close up its entire business,\r\n     then they shall select three competent men, not connected with\r\n     the previous management of the institution and approved by the\r\n     Secretary of the Treasury, to be known and styled commissioners,\r\n     whose duty it shall be to take charge of all the property and\r\n     effects of said Freedman's Savings and Trust Company, close up\r\n     the principal and subordinate branches, collect from the branches\r\n     all the deposits they have on hand, and proceed to collect all\r\n     sums due said company, and dispose of all the property owned by\r\n     said company, as speedily as the interests of the corporation\r\n     require, and to distribute the proceeds among the creditors pro\r\n     rata, according to their respective amounts; they shall make a\r\n     pro rata dividend whenever they have funds enough to pay twenty\r\n     per centum of the claims of depositors. Said commissioners,\r\n     before they proceed to act, shall execute a joint bond to the\r\n     United States, with good sureties, in the penal sum of one\r\n     hundred thousand dollars, conditioned for the faithful discharge\r\n     of their duties as commissioners aforesaid, and shall take an\r\n     oath to faithfully and honestly perform their duties as such,\r\n     which bonds shall be executed in presence of the Secretary of the\r\n     Treasury, be approved by him, and by him safely kept; and\r\n     whenever said trustees shall file with the Secretary of the\r\n     Treasury a certified copy of the order appointing said\r\n     commissioners, and they shall have executed the bonds and taken\r\n     the oath aforesaid, then said commissioners shall be invested\r\n     with the legal title to all of said property of said company, for\r\n     the purposes of this act, and shall have full power and authority\r\n     to sell the same, and make deeds of conveyance to any and all of\r\n     the real estate sold by them to the purchasers. Said\r\n     commissioners may employ such agents as are necessary to assist\r\n     them in closing up said company, and pay them a reasonable\r\n     compensation for their services out of the funds of said company;\r\n     and the said commissioners shall retain out of said funds a\r\n     reasonable compensation for their trouble, to be fixed by the\r\n     Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency,\r\n     and not exceeding three thousand dollars each per annum. Said\r\n     commissioners shall deposit all sums collected by them in the\r\n     Treasury of the United States until they make a pro rata\r\n     distribution of the same.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several legal questions that history would like to ask. 1.\r\nDid not the trustees of the Freedman's Savings Bank and Trust Company\r\nviolate their charter in establishing branch banks? 2. Were not the\r\ntrustees personally liable for receiving deposits from persons who\r\nwere neither \"heretofore held in slavery\" nor the descendants of such\r\npersons? 3. Were not persons \"heretofore held in slavery\" and \"their\r\ndescendants\" preferred creditors? 4. Had Congress the authority to go\r\noutside of the Federal bankruptcy laws and create such special\r\nmachinery for the settlement of a collapsed bank? This matter may come\r\nbefore Congress in a new shape some time in the future.\r\n\r\nThe three commissioners, at a salary of $3,000 per annum, were charged\r\nwith the settlement of the affairs of the bank. They were Jno. A. J.\r\nCreswell, Robert Purvis, and R. H. T. Leipold. Mr. Creswell was\r\nretained by the United States before the Alabama Claims Commission at\r\na salary of $10,000 per annum; while Mr. Leipold was a lawyer with\r\nconsiderable practice. But neither one of these gentlemen ever entered\r\na court on behalf of the company. In a little more than five years\r\nthey used up out of the assets of the company, $40,000 for their\r\nsalaries; paid for salaries to agents, $64,000, and $31,000 for\r\nattorneys' fees, aggregating $135,000--nearly one half of the amount\r\ndistributed among depositors for the same length of time.\r\n\r\nThe more the commissioners examined, the greater the liabilities of\r\nthe company grew. On the 1st of October, 1875, a dividend of 20 per\r\ncent. was declared; on the 1st of February, 1878, a dividend of 10 per\r\ncent. was declared; on the 21st of August, 1880, they declared another\r\ndividend of 10 per cent.; and on the 14th of April, 1881, a circular\r\nwas sent out as a crumb of comfort to the anxious, defrauded, and\r\noutraged depositors. It is not enough for history to pronounce the\r\nfailure of this bank an irreparable calamity to the Colored people of\r\nthe South; it should be branded as a _crime_! There was no more\r\nnecessity for the failure of this bank than for the failure of the\r\nUnited States Treasury. Its management was criminal; and Congress\r\nshould yet seek out and punish the guilty; and the depositors should\r\nbe indemnified out of the United States Treasury. Justice and equity\r\ndemand it.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Freedman's Bank worked great mischief among the\r\nColored people in the South. But hardy, persistent, earnest, and\r\nhopeful, they turned again to the work of making and saving money.\r\nThey have been more prudent than their circumstances, in some\r\ninstances, would seem to warrant. In Georgia the Colored people have\r\nmade wonderful progress in business matters.\r\n\r\n                                                Amount of\r\n                                                Money and  Household\r\n           No. of                               Solvent    and\r\n           Acres of  Value of     City or Town  Debts of   Kitchen\r\n  Polls.

In Baltimore a company of Colored men own a\r\nship dock, and transact a large business. Some of the largest orange\r\nplantations in Florida are owned by Colored men. On most of the\r\nplantations, and in many of the large towns and cities Colored\r\nmechanics are quite numerous. The Montgomeries who own the plantation,\r\nonce the property of Jefferson Davis, extending for miles along the\r\nMississippi, are probably the best business men in the South. In\r\nLouisiana, P. P. Deslonde, A. Dubuclet, Hon. T. T. Allain, and State\r\nSenator Young are men who, although taking a lively interest in\r\npolitics, have accumulated property and saved it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing vicious in the character of the Southern Negro. He is\r\ngentle, affectionate, and faithful. If it has appeared, through false\r\nfigures, that he is a criminal, there is room for satisfactory\r\nexplanation. In 1870, out of a population, of persons of color, in all\r\nthe States and Territories, of 4,880,009, there were only 9,400 who\r\nwere receiving aid on the 1st of June, 1870; and only 8,056 in all the\r\nprisons of America. Nine tenths of these were South, and could neither\r\nread nor write.\r\n\r\nDuring the Rebellion, when every white male from fifteen to seventy\r\nwas out fighting to sustain the Confederacy--when the Southern\r\nGovernment was robbing the cradle and the grave for soldiers--the\r\nwives and children of the Confederates were committed to the care and\r\nkeeping of their slaves. And what is the verdict of history? That\r\nthese women were outraged and their children brained? No! But that\r\nduring all those years of painful anxiety, of hope and fear, of fiery\r\ntrial and severe privation, those faithful Negroes toiled, not only to\r\nsupport the wives and children of the men who were fighting to make\r\nslavery national and perpetual, but fed the entire rebel army, and\r\nnever laid the weight of a finger upon the head of any of the women or\r\nchildren entrusted to their care! To this virtue of fidelity to their\r\nworst enemies they added still another, loyalty to the Union flag and\r\nescaping Union soldiers. All night long they would direct the lonely,\r\nfamishing, fainting, and almost delirious Union soldier in a safe way,\r\nand then when the night and morning met they would point their pilgrim\r\nfriends to the North Star, hide them and feed them during the day, and\r\nthen return to the plantation to care for the loved ones of the men\r\nwho starved Union soldiers and hunted them down with bloodhounds! This\r\nis the brightest gem that history can place upon the brow of the\r\nNegro; and in conferring it there is no one found to object.\r\n\r\nSince the war the crime among Colored people is to be accounted for\r\nupon two grounds, viz.: ignorance, and a combination of circumstances\r\nover which they had no control. It was one thing for the Negro to\r\nunderstand the cruel laws of slavery, but when he found himself a\r\nfreeman he was not able to know what was an infraction of the law.\r\nThey did not know what in law constituted a _tort_, or a civil action\r\nfrom a sled. The violent passions pampered in slavery, the destruction\r\nof the home, the promiscuous mingling of the sexes, a conscience\r\nenfeebled by disuse, made them easy transgressors. The Negro is not a\r\ncriminal generically; he is an accidental criminal. The judiciary and\r\njuries of the South are responsible for the alarming prison statistics\r\nwhich stand against the Negro. It takes generations for men to\r\novercome their prejudices. With a white judge and a white jury a Negro\r\nis guilty the moment he makes his appearance in court. It is seldom\r\nthat a Negro can get judgment against a white person under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances. The Negroes who appear in courts are of the\r\npoorer and more ignorant class. They have no funds with which to\r\nemploy counsel, and have but few intelligent lawyers to come to their\r\nrescue. In cases of theft, especially of poultry, pigs, sheep, fruit,\r\netc., it is next to impossible to convince a white judge or jury that\r\nthe defendant is not guilty. They reason that because the half-fed,\r\noverworked slave appropriated articles of food, as a freeman the Negro\r\nwas not changed. They ascribed a general habit, growing out of trying\r\ncircumstances, to the Negro as a slave that he soon learned to regard\r\nas morally wrong when a freeman.\r\n\r\nBut the most effective agency in filling Southern prisons with Negroes\r\nhas been, and is, the chain-gang system--the farming out of convict\r\nlabor. Just as great railway, oil, and telegraph companies in the\r\nNorth have been capable of controlling legislation, so the\r\ncorporations at the South which take the prisoners of the State off of\r\nthe hands of the Government, and then speculate upon the labor of the\r\nprisoners, are able to control both court and jury. It has been the\r\npractice, and is now, in some of the Southern States, to pronounce\r\nlong sentences upon able-bodied young Colored men, whose offences, in\r\na Northern court, could not be visited with more than a few months'\r\nconfinement and a trifling fine. The object in giving Negro men a long\r\nterm of years, is to make sure the tenure of the soulless\r\ncorporations upon the convicts whose unhappy lot it is to fall into\r\ntheir iron grasp. In some of the Southern States a strong and healthy\r\nNegro convict brings thirty-seven cents a day to the State, while he\r\nearns a dollar for the corporations above his expenses. The convicts\r\nare cruelly treated--especially in Georgia and Kentucky;--their food\r\nis poor, their quarters miserable, and their morals next to the brute\r\ncreation. In many of these camps men and women are compelled to sleep\r\nin the same bunks together, with chains upon their limbs, in a\r\npromiscuous manner too sickening and disgusting to mention. When a\r\nprisoner escapes he is hunted down by fiery dogs and cruel guards; and\r\noften the poor prisoner is torn to pieces by the dogs or beaten to\r\ndeath by the guards. No system of slavery was ever equal in its cruel\r\nand dehumanizing details to this convict system, which, taking\r\nadvantage of race prejudice on the one hand and race ignorance on the\r\nother, with cupidity and avarice as its chief characteristics, has\r\ndone more to curse the South than all things else since the war.\r\n\r\nIt was predicted by persons hostile to the rights and citizenship of\r\nthe Negro, that a condition of freedom would not be in harmony with\r\nhis character; that it would destroy him, and that he would destroy\r\nthe country and party which tried to make him agree to a state of\r\nindependent life; that having been used to the \"kind treatment\"(?) of\r\nhis master he would find himself unequal to the responsibilities of\r\nfreedom; and that his migratory disposition would lead him into a\r\nclimate too cold for him, where he would be welcomed to an\r\ninhospitable grave.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a great many Negroes died during the first years of\r\ntheir new life. The joy of emancipation and the excitement that\r\ndisturbed business swept the Negroes into the large cities. Like the\r\nshepherds who left their flocks on the plains and went into Bethlehem\r\nto see the promised redemption, these people sought the centres of\r\nexcitement. The large cities were overrun with them. The demand for\r\nunskilled labor was not great. From mere spectators they became\r\nidlers, helpless and offensive to industrious society. Ignorant of\r\nsanitary laws, imprudent in their daily living, changing from the pure\r\nair and plain diet of farm life to the poisonous atmosphere and rich,\r\nfateful food of the city, many fell victims to the sudden change from\r\nbondage to freedom, from darkness to light, and from the fleshpots,\r\ngarlic, and onions of their Egyptian bondage to the milk and honey of\r\nthe Canaan of their deliverance.\r\n\r\nBut this was in accordance with an immutable law of nature. Every year\r\na large number of birds perish in an attempt to change their home;\r\nevery spring-time many flowers die at their birth. The law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest is impartial and inexorable. The Creator said\r\ncenturies ago \"the soul that sinneth shall surely die,\" and the law\r\nhas remained until the present time. Those who sinned ignorantly or\r\nknowingly died the death; but those who obeyed the laws of health, of\r\nman, and of God, lived to be useful members of society.\r\n\r\nBut this was the exception to the rule. The Negro race in America is\r\nnot dying out. The charge is false. The wish was father to the\r\nthought, while no doubt many honest people have been misled by false\r\nfigures. Nearly all white communities at the South had more than\r\nenough of physicians; and science and culture were summoned to the aid\r\nof the white mother in the hour of childbirth. The record of births\r\nwas preserved with pride and official accuracy; and thus there was a\r\nrecord upon which to calculate the increase. But, on the contary,\r\namong the Negroes there were no physicians and no record of births.\r\nThe venerable system of midwifery prevailed. In burying their dead,\r\nhowever, this people were compelled to obtain a burial permit from the\r\nBoard of Health. Thus the statistics were all on one side--all deaths\r\nand no births. Looking at these statistics it did seem that the race\r\nwas dying out. But the Government steps in and takes the census every\r\ndecade, and, thereby, the world is enabled, upon reliable figures, to\r\nestimate the increase or decrease of the Colored race. The subjoined\r\ntable exhibits the increase of the Colored people for nine decades.\r\n\r\n                                    Colored gain\r\n                 Year.

The theory that the race was dying\r\nout under the influences of civilization at a greater ratio than under\r\nthe annihilating influences of slavery was at war with common-sense\r\nand the efficient laws of Christian society. Emancipation has taken\r\nthe mother from field-work to house-work. The slave hut has been\r\nsupplanted by a pleasant house; the mud floor is done away with; and\r\nnow, with carpets on the floor, pictures on the wall, a better quality\r\nof food properly prepared, the influence of books and papers, and the\r\nblessings of a preached Gospel, the Negro mother is more prolific, and\r\nthe mortality of her children reduced to a minimum. The Negro is not\r\ndying out. On the contrary he has shown the greatest recuperative\r\npowers, and against the white population of the United States as it\r\nstands to-day--if it were not fed by European immigrants,--within the\r\nnext hundred years the Negroes would outnumber the whites 12,000,000!\r\nOr at an increase of 33-1/3 per cent. the Negro population in 1980\r\nwould be 117,000,000! providing the ratio of increase continues the\r\nsame between the races.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition to the fact that the Negro, like the Irishman, is\r\nprolific, is able to reproduce his species, it should be recorded that\r\nthe Negro intellect is growing and expanding at a wonderful rate. The\r\nchildren of ten and twelve years of age are more apt to-day than those\r\nof the same age ten years ago. And the children of the next generation\r\nwill have no superiors in any of the schools of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[117] For an account of this problem, see the Appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n[118] See the annual reports of the Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction for Virginia.

As a soldier he stood in line of promotion:\r\nthe Government destroyed the Confederacy when it placed muskets in the\r\nhands of the slaves; and at the close of the war had to legally render\r\nslavery forever impossible in the United States. The bloody deduction\r\nof the great struggle had to be made a living, legal verity in the\r\nConstitution, and hence the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as\r\n     a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly\r\n     convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place\r\n     subject to their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\n     appropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the consummation of the ordinance of 1787, carried to its\r\nlast analysis, applied in its broadest sense. It drove the last nail\r\nin the coffin of slavery, and blighted the fondest hope of the friends\r\nof secession.\r\n\r\nBut there was need for another amendment to the Constitution\r\nconferring upon the Colored people manhood suffrage. On the 27th of\r\nFebruary, 1869, the Congress passed a resolution recommending the\r\nFifteenth Amendment for ratification by the Legislatures of the\r\nseveral States. On the 30th of March, 1870, President U. S. Grant sent\r\na special message to Congress, calling the attention of that body to\r\nthe proclamation of the Secretary of State in reference to the\r\nratification of the Amendment by twenty-nine of the States.\r\n\r\n     SPECIAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT GRANT ON RATIFICATION OF THE\r\n     FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\n     \"It is unusual to notify the two houses of Congress, by message,\r\n     of the promulgation, by proclamation of the Secretary of State,\r\n     of the ratification of a constitutional amendment. In view,\r\n     however, of the vast importance of the XVth Amendment to the\r\n     Constitution, this day declared a part of that revered\r\n     instrument, I deem a departure from the usual custom justifiable.\r\n     A measure which makes at once four millions of people voters, who\r\n     were heretofore declared by the highest tribunal in the land not\r\n     citizens of the United States, nor eligible to become so, (with\r\n     the assertion that, 'at the time of the Declaration of\r\n     Independence, the opinion was fixed and universal in the\r\n     civilized portion of the white race, regarded as an axiom in\r\n     morals as well as in politics, that black men had no rights which\r\n     the white man was bound to respect,') is indeed a measure of\r\n     grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the\r\n     foundation of our free government to the present day.\r\n\r\n     \"Institutions like ours, in which all power is derived directly\r\n     from the people, must depend mainly upon their intelligence,\r\n     patriotism, and industry. I call the attention, therefore, of the\r\n     newly-enfranchised race to the importance of their striving in\r\n     every honorable manner to make themselves worthy of their new\r\n     privilege. To the race more favored heretofore by our laws I\r\n     would say, withhold no legal privilege of advancement to the new\r\n     citizen. The framers of our Constitution firmly believed that a\r\n     republican government could not endure without intelligence and\r\n     education generally diffused among the people. The 'Father of his\r\n     Country,' in his farewell address, uses this language: 'Promote,\r\n     then, as a matter of primary importance, institutions for the\r\n     general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of\r\n     the government gives force to public opinion, it is essential\r\n     that public opinion should be enlightened.' In his first annual\r\n     message to Congress the same views are forcibly presented, and\r\n     are again urged in his eighth message.\r\n\r\n     \"I repeat that the adaption of the XVth Amendment to the\r\n     Constitution completes the greatest civil change and constitutes\r\n     the most important event that has occurred since the nation came\r\n     into life. The change will be beneficial in proportion to the\r\n     heed that is given to the urgent recommendations of Washington.\r\n     If these recommendations were important then, with a population\r\n     of but a few millions, how much more important now, with a\r\n     population of forty millions, and increasing in a rapid ratio.\r\n\r\n     \"I would therefore call upon Congress to take all the means\r\n     within their constitutional powers to promote and encourage\r\n     popular education throughout the country; and upon the people\r\n     everywhere to see to it that all who possess and exercise\r\n     political rights shall have the opportunity to acquire the\r\n     knowledge which will make their share in the government a\r\n     blessing and not a danger. By such means only can the benefits\r\n     contemplated by this amendment to the Constitution be secured.\r\n\r\n                                        \"U. S.

The event\r\nwas celebrated by the Colored people in all the larger cities North\r\nand South. Processions, orations, music and dancing proclaimed the\r\nunbounded joy of the new citizen. In Philadelphia Frederick Douglass,\r\nBishop Jabez P. Campbell, I. C. Wears, and others delivered eloquent\r\naddresses to enthusiastic audiences. Mr. Douglass deeply wounded the\r\nreligious feelings of his race by declaring; \"I shall not dwell in\r\nany hackneyed cant by thanking God for this deliverance which has\r\nbeen wrought out through our common humanity.\" A hundred pulpits, a\r\nhundred trenchant pens sprang at the declaration with fiery\r\nindignation; and it was some years before the bold orator was able to\r\nmake himself tolerable to his people. There was little of the spirit\r\nof tolerance among the Colored people at the time, and upon such an\r\noccasion the remark was regarded as imprudent, to say the least.\r\n\r\nA new era was opened up before the Colored people. They were now for\r\nthe first time in possession of their full political rights. On the\r\n25th of February, 1870, Hiram R. Revels took his seat as United States\r\nSenator from Mississippi. On the 9th of January, 1861, Mississippi\r\npassed her ordinance of secession, and Jefferson Davis resigned his\r\nseat as United States Senator. Within a brief decade a civil war had\r\nraged for four and a half years; and after the seceding Mississippi\r\nhad passed through the refining fires of battle and had been purged of\r\nslavery, she sent to succeed the arch traitor a _Negro_,[123] a\r\nrepresentative of the race that Mr. Davis intended to be the\r\ncorner-stone of his new government!![124] It was God's work, and\r\nmarvellous in the eyes of the world. But this was not all. Just one\r\nyear from the day and hour Senator Revels took his seat in the United\r\nStates Senate, on the 24th of February, 1871, Jefferson F. Long, a\r\n_Negro_, was sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives from\r\nGeorgia, the State of Alexander H. Stephens, the Vice-President of the\r\nConfederate States!! And then, as if to add glory to glory, the\r\nAmerican Government despatched E. D. Bassett, a Colored man from\r\nPennsylvania, as Minister Resident and Consul-General to Hayti! And\r\nwith almost the same stroke of his pen, President Grant sent J. Milton\r\nTurner, a Colored man from Missouri, as Resident Minister and\r\nConsul-General to Liberia! Mr. Bassett came from Philadelphia where\r\nthe Declaration of Independence was written and proclaimed, and where\r\nthe noble Dr. Franklin had stood against the slavery compromises of\r\nthe Constitution! Philadelphia, then, the birthplace of American\r\nIndependence, had the honor of furnishing the first Negro who was to\r\nillustrate the lofty sentiment of the equality of _all_ men before the\r\nlaw. And the republic that Mr. Bassett went to had won diplomatic\r\nrelations with all the civilized powers of the earth through the\r\nmatchless valor and splendid statesmanship of Toussaint L'Ouverture.\r\nThis was a black republic that had a history and a name among the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner went from Missouri, the first State to violate the\r\nordinance of 1787, and to establish slavery \"northwest of the Ohio\"\r\nRiver. He went to a republic on the West Coast of Africa that had been\r\nbuilt by the industry, intelligence, and piety of Negroes who had\r\nflown from the accursed influences of American slavery. The\r\nslave-ships had disappeared from the coast, and commercial fleets,\r\nfrom all lands came to trade with the citizens of a free republic\r\nwhose ministers were welcomed in every court of Europe, and whose\r\nofficial acts were clothed with the authority and majesty of \"_the\r\nRepublic of Liberia_!\"\r\n\r\nIn this same period Frederick Douglass was made a Presidential Elector\r\nfor the State of New York; and thus helped cast the vote of that great\r\ncommonwealth for U. S. Grant as President, in 1872. In the chief city\r\nof this State the first Federal Congress met, and on the first day of\r\nits first session spent the entire time in discussing the slavery\r\nquestion. Through the streets of this same city Mr. Douglass had to\r\nskulk and hide from slave-catchers on his way from the hell of\r\nslavery, to the land of freedom. In this city, a few years later, he\r\nwas hounded by a pro-slavery mob,--but at last he represented the\r\npopular will of its noblest citizens when they had chosen him to act\r\nfor them in the Electoral College.\r\n\r\nBorn a slave, some time during the present century, on the eastern\r\nshore, Maryland, in the county of Talbot, and in the district of\r\nTuckahoe, Frederick Douglass was destined by nature and God to be a\r\ngiant in the great moral agitation for the extinction of slavery and\r\nthe redemption of his race. He came of two extremes--representative\r\nNegro and representative Saxon. Tall, large-boned, colossal frame,\r\ncompact head, broad, expressive face adorned with small brown,\r\nmischievous eyes, nose slightly Grecian, chin square set, and thin\r\nlips, Frederick Douglass would attract attention upon the streets of\r\nany city in Europe or America. His life as a slave was studded with\r\npainful experiences. Early separation from his mother, neglect, and\r\nthen cruel treatment gave to the holy cause of freedom one of its\r\nablest champions, and to slavery one of its most invincible opponents.\r\n\r\nTransferred from Talbot County to Baltimore, Maryland, where he spent\r\nseven years, Mr. Douglass began to extend the horizon of his\r\nintellectual vision, and to come face to face with the hideous monster\r\nof slavery in the moments of reflection upon his condition in contrast\r\nwith that of a fairer race about him. Inadvertently his mistress began\r\nto teach him characters of letters; but she was stopped by the advice\r\nof her husband, because it was thought inimical to the interest of the\r\nmaster to teach his slave. But having lighted the taper of knowledge\r\nin the mind of the slave boy, it was forever beyond human power to put\r\nit out. The incidents and surroundings of young Douglass peopled his\r\nbrain with ideas, gave wings to his thoughts and order to his\r\nreasoning. The word of reproof, the angry look, and the precautions to\r\nprevent him from acquiring knowledge rankled in his young heart and\r\ncovered his moral sky with thick clouds of despair. He reasoned\r\nhimself right out of slavery, and ran away and went North.\r\n\r\nDavid Ruggles, a Colored gentleman of intelligence, took charge of Mr.\r\nDouglass in New York, and sent him to New Bedford, Massachusetts.\r\nHaving married in New York a free Colored woman from Baltimore named\r\n\"Anna,\" he was ready now to enter upon the duties of the new life as a\r\nfreeman. He found in one Nathan Johnson, an intelligent and\r\nindustrious Colored man of New Bedford, a warm friend, who advanced\r\nhim a sum of money to redeem baggage held for fare, and gave him the\r\nname which he has since rendered illustrious.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual growth of Mr. Douglass from this on was almost\r\nphenomenal. He devoured knowledge with avidity, and retained and\r\nutilized all he got. He used information as good business men use\r\nmoney. He made every idea bear interest; and now setting the music of\r\nhis soul to the words he acquired, he soon earned a reputation as a\r\ngifted conversationalist and an impressive orator.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1841 an anti-slavery convention was held at\r\nNantucket, Massachusetts, under the direction of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. Mr. Douglass had attended several meetings in New Bedford,\r\nwhere he had listened to a defence of his race and a denunciation of\r\nits oppressors. And when he heard of the forthcoming convention at\r\nNantucket he resolved to take a little respite from the hard work he\r\nwas performing in a brass foundry, and attend. Previous to this he had\r\nfelt the warm heart of Mr. Garrison beating for the slave through the\r\ncolumns of the \"Liberator\"; had received a copy each week for a long\r\ntime, had mastered its matchless arguments against slavery, and was,\r\ntherefore, possessed with an idea of the anti-slavery cause. At\r\nNantucket he was sought out of the vast audience and requested by\r\nWilliam C. Coffin, of New Bedford, where he had heard the fervid\r\neloquence of the young man as an exhorter in the Colored Methodist\r\nChurch, to make a speech. The hesitancy and diffidence of Mr. Douglass\r\nwere overcome by the importunate invitation to speak. He spoke: and\r\nfrom that hour a new sphere opened to him; from that hour he began to\r\nexert an influence against slavery which for a generation was second\r\nonly to that of Mr. Garrison. He was engaged as an agent of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society led by Mr. Garrison. He was taken in charge by\r\nGeorge Foster, and in his company made a lecturing tour of the eastern\r\ntier of counties in the old Bay State. The meetings were announced a\r\nfew days ahead of the lecturer. He was advertised as a \"fugitive\r\nslave,\" as \"a chattel,\" as \"a thing\" that could talk and give an\r\ninteresting account of the cruelties of slavery. As a narrator he had\r\nfew equals among the most polished white gentlemen of all New England.\r\nHis white friends were charmed by the lucidity and succinctness of his\r\naccount of his life as a slave, and always insisted upon his\r\nnarrative. But he was more than a narrator, more than a story-teller;\r\nhe was an orator, and in dealing with the problem of slavery proved\r\nhimself to be a thinker. The old story of his bondage became stale to\r\nhim. His friends' advice to keep on telling the same story could no\r\nlonger be complied with; and dashing out of the beaten path of\r\nnarration he began a career as an orator that has had no parallel on\r\nthis continent. He found no adequate satisfaction in relating the\r\nexperiences of a slave; his soul burned with a holy indignation\r\nagainst the institution of slavery. Having increased his vocabulary of\r\nwords and his information concerning the purposes and plans of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, he was prepared to make an assault upon slavery.\r\nInstead of being the pupil of the anti-slavery friends who had\r\nfurnished him a great opportunity, his close reasoning, blighting\r\nirony, merciless invective, and matchless eloquence made him the peer\r\nof any anti-slavery orator of his times. His appearance on the\r\nanti-slavery platform was sudden. He appeared as a new star of\r\nmagnificent magnitude and surpassing beauty. All eyes were turned\r\ntoward the \"fugitive slave orator.\" His eloquence so astounded the\r\npeople that few would believe he had ever felt the cruel touch of the\r\nlash. Moreover, he had withheld from the public, the State and place\r\nof his nativity and the circumstances of his escape. He had done this\r\npurposely for prudential reasons. In those days there was no\r\nprotection that protected a fugitive slave against the slave-catcher\r\nassisted by the United States courts. To reveal his master's name and\r\nrecount the exciting circumstances under which he had made his escape\r\nfrom bondage, Mr. Douglass felt was but to invite the slave-hounds to\r\nMassachusetts and endanger his liberty. But there were many good\r\nfriends hard by who were ready to pay the market value of Mr. Douglass\r\nif a price were placed upon his flesh and blood. They urged him,\r\ntherefore, to write out an account of his life as a slave,--to be\r\nspecific; and to boldly mention names of places and persons. In 1845 a\r\npamphlet written by Mr. Douglass, embodying the experiences of a\r\n\"fugitive slave,\" was published by the Anti-Slavery Society. It\r\nbreathed a fiery zeal into the apathy of the North, and drew the fire\r\nof the Southern press and people. For safety his friends sent him\r\nabroad. During the voyage, in accepting an invitation to deliver a\r\nlecture on slavery, he gave offence to some pro-slavery men who\r\ndesired very much to feed his body to the inhabitants of the deep. But\r\na resolute captain and a few friends were able to reduce the wrath of\r\nthe Southerners to a minimum. The occurrence on shipboard duly found\r\nits way into the public journals of London; and the Southern gentlemen\r\nin an attempt to justify their conduct in a card drew upon themselves\r\nthe wrath of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and gave Mr.\r\nDouglass an advertisement such as he could never have secured\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass spent nearly two years in Europe lecturing and writing in\r\nthe cause of anti-slavery. He made a profound impression and helped\r\nthe anti-slavery cause amazingly.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence he wrote an occasional letter to the editor of the\r\n\"Liberator,\" and the first is, for composition, vigorous English,\r\nsymbols of thought, similes, and irony, superior to any letter he ever\r\nwrote before or since. It bore date of January 1, 1846.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: Up to this time I have given no direct\r\n     expression of the views, feelings, and opinions which I have\r\n     formed, respecting the character and condition of the people of\r\n     this land. I have refrained thus, purposely. I wish to speak\r\n     advisedly, and in order to do this, I have waited till, I trust,\r\n     experience has brought my opinions to an intelligent maturity. I\r\n     have been thus careful, not because I think what I say will have\r\n     much effect in shaping the opinions of the world, but because\r\n     whatever of influence I may possess, whether little or much, I\r\n     wish it to go in the right direction, and according to truth. I\r\n     hardly need say that, in speaking of Ireland, I shall be\r\n     influenced by no prejudices in favor of America. I think my\r\n     circumstances all forbid that. I have no end to serve, no creed\r\n     to uphold, no government to defend; and as to nation, I belong to\r\n     none. I have no protection at home, or resting-place abroad. The\r\n     land of my birth welcomes me to her shores only as a slave, and\r\n     spurns with contempt the idea of treating me differently; so that\r\n     I am an outcast from the society of my childhood, and an outlaw\r\n     in the land of my birth. 'I am a stranger with thee, and a\r\n     sojourner, as all my fathers were.' That men should be patriotic,\r\n     is to me perfectly natural; and as a philosophical fact, I am\r\n     able to give it an _intellectual_ recognition. But no further can\r\n     I go. If ever I had any patriotism, or any capacity for the\r\n     feeling, it was whipped out of me long since, by the lash of the\r\n     American soul-drivers.\r\n\r\n     \"In thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her\r\n     bright blue sky, her grand old woods, her fertile fields, her\r\n     beautiful rivers, her mighty lakes, and star-crowned mountains.\r\n     But my rapture is soon checked, my joy is soon turned to\r\n     mourning. When I remember that all is cursed with the infernal\r\n     spirit of slave-holding, robbery, and wrong; when I remember that\r\n     with the waters of her noblest rivers, the tears of my brethren\r\n     are borne to the ocean, disregarded and forgotten, and that her\r\n     most fertile fields drink daily of the warm blood of my outraged\r\n     sisters, I am filled with unutterable loathing, and led to\r\n     reproach myself that any thing could fall from my lips in praise\r\n     of such a land. America will not allow her children to love her.\r\n     She seems bent on compelling those who would be her warmest\r\n     friends, to be her worst enemies. May God give her repentance,\r\n     before it is too late, is the ardent prayer of my heart. I will\r\n     continue to pray, labor, and wait, believing that she cannot\r\n     always be insensible to the dictates of justice, or deaf to the\r\n     voice of humanity.\r\n\r\n     \"My opportunities for learning the character and condition of the\r\n     people of this land have been very great. I have travelled almost\r\n     from the Hill of Howth to the Giant's Causeway, and from the\r\n     Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear. During these travels, I have met\r\n     with much in the character and condition of the people to\r\n     approve, and much to condemn; much that has thrilled me with\r\n     pleasure, and very much that has filled me with pain. I will not,\r\n     in this letter, attempt to give any description of those scenes\r\n     which have given me pain. This I will do hereafter. I have\r\n     enough, and more than your subscribers will be disposed to read\r\n     at one time, of the bright side of the picture. I can truly say,\r\n     I have spent some of the happiest moments of my life since\r\n     landing in this country. I seem to have undergone a\r\n     transformation. I live a new life. The warm and generous\r\n     cooperation extended to me by the friends of my despised race;\r\n     the prompt and liberal manner with which the press has rendered\r\n     me its aid; the glorious enthusiasm with which thousands have\r\n     flocked to hear the cruel wrongs of my down-trodden and\r\n     long-enslaved fellow-countrymen portrayed; the deep sympathy for\r\n     the slave, and the strong abhorrence of the slave-holder,\r\n     everywhere evinced; the cordiality with which members and\r\n     ministers of various religious bodies, and of various shades of\r\n     religious opinion, have embraced me, and lent me their aid; the\r\n     kind hospitality constantly proffered me by persons of the\r\n     highest rank in society; the spirit of freedom that seems to\r\n     animate all with whom I come in contact, and the entire absence\r\n     of every thing that looked like prejudice against me, on account\r\n     of the color of my skin--contrasted so strongly with my long and\r\n     bitter experience in the United States, that I look with wonder\r\n     and amazement on the transition. In the southern part of the\r\n     United States, I was a slave, thought of and spoken of as\r\n     property; in the language of the LAW, '_held, taken, reputed, and\r\n     adjudged to be a chattel in the hands of my owners and\r\n     possessors, and their executors, administrators, and assigns, to\r\n     all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever_.' (Brev.\r\n     Digest, 224.) In the northern states, a fugitive slave, liable to\r\n     be hunted at any moment like a felon, and to be hurled into the\r\n     terrible jaws of slavery-doomed by an inveterate prejudice\r\n     against color to insult and outrage on every hand, (Massachussetts\r\n     out of the question)--denied the privileges and courtesies common\r\n     to others in the use of the most humble means of conveyance--shut\r\n     out from the cabins of steamboats--refused admission to\r\n     respectable hotels--caricatured, scorned, scoffed, mocked, and\r\n     maltreated with impunity by any one, (no matter how black his\r\n     heart,) so he has a white skin. But now behold the change! Eleven\r\n     days and a half gone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of\r\n     the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under\r\n     a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of\r\n     America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald\r\n     Isle. I breathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a man. I gaze around\r\n     in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as\r\n     his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab--I am seated\r\n     beside white people--I reach the hotel--I enter the same door--I\r\n     am shown into the same parlor--I dine at the same table--and no\r\n     one is offended.\r\n\r\n     No delicate nose grows deformed in my presence. I find no\r\n     difficulty here in obtaining admission into any place of worship,\r\n     instruction, or amusement, on equal terms with people as white as\r\n     any I ever saw in the United States. I meet nothing to remind me\r\n     of my complexion. I find myself regarded and treated at every\r\n     turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I\r\n     go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to\r\n     tell me, '_We don't allow niggers in here!_'\r\n\r\n     \"I remember, about two years ago, there was in Boston, near the\r\n     south-west corner of Boston Common, a menagerie. I had long\r\n     desired to see such a collection as I understood was being\r\n     exhibited there. Never having had an opportunity while a slave, I\r\n     resolved to seize this, my first, since my escape. I went, and as\r\n     I approached the entrance to gain admission, I was met and told\r\n     by the door-keeper, in a harsh and contemptuous tone, '_We don't\r\n     allow niggers in here!_' I also remember attending a revival\r\n     meeting in the Rev. Henry Jackson's meeting-house, at New\r\n     Bedford, and going up the broad aisle to find a seat, I was met\r\n     by a good deacon, who told me, in a pious tone, '_We don't allow\r\n     niggers in here!_' Soon after my arrival in New Bedford, from the\r\n     South, I had a strong desire to attend the Lyceum, but was told,\r\n     '_They don't allow niggers in here!_' While passing from New York\r\n     to Boston, on the steamer 'Massachusetts,' on the night of the\r\n     9th of December, 1843, when chilled almost through with the cold,\r\n     I went into the cabin to get a little warm. I was soon touched\r\n     upon the shoulder, and told, '_We don't allow niggers in here!_'\r\n     On arriving in Boston, from an anti-slavery tour, hungry and\r\n     tired, I went into an eating-house, near my friend, Mr.\r\n     Campbell's, to get some refreshments. I was met by a lad in a\r\n     white apron, '_We don't allow niggers in here!_' A week or two\r\n     before leaving the United States, I had a meeting appointed at\r\n     Weymouth, the home of that glorious band of true abolitionists,\r\n     the Weston family, and others. On attempting to take a seat in\r\n     the omnibus to that place, I was told by the driver (and I never\r\n     shall forget his fiendish hate), '_I don't allow niggers in\r\n     here!_' Thank heaven for the respite I now enjoy! I had been in\r\n     Dublin but a few days, when a gentleman of great respectability\r\n     kindly offered to conduct me through all the public buildings of\r\n     that beautiful city; and a little afterward, I found myself\r\n     dining with the lord mayor of Dublin. What a pity there was not\r\n     some American democratic Christian at the door of his splendid\r\n     mansion, to bark out at my approach, '_They don't allow niggers\r\n     in here!_' The truth is, the people here know nothing of the\r\n     republican negro hate prevalent in our glorious land. They\r\n     measure and esteem men according to their moral and intellectual\r\n     worth, and not according to the color of their skin. Whatever may\r\n     be said of the aristocracies here, there is none based on the\r\n     color of a man's skin.\r\n\r\n     This species of aristocracy belongs preeminently to 'the land of\r\n     the free, and the home of the brave.' I have never found it\r\n     abroad, in any but Americans. It sticks to them wherever they go.\r\n     They find it almost as hard to get rid of, as to get rid of their\r\n     skins.\r\n\r\n     \"The second day after my arrival at Liverpool, in company with my\r\n     friend, Buffum, and several other friends, I went to Eaton Hall,\r\n     the residence of the Marquis of Westminster, one of the most\r\n     splendid buildings in England. On approaching the door, I found\r\n     several of our American passengers, who came out with us in the\r\n     'Cambria,' waiting for admission, as but one party was allowed in\r\n     the house at a time. We all had to wait till the company within\r\n     came out. And of all the faces, expressive of chagrin, those of\r\n     the Americans were preëminent. They looked as sour as vinegar,\r\n     and as bitter as gall, when they found I was to be admitted on\r\n     equal terms with themselves. When the door was opened, I walked\r\n     in, on an equal footing with my white fellow-citizens, and from\r\n     all I could see, I had as much attention paid me by the servants\r\n     that showed us through the house, as any with a paler skin. As I\r\n     walked through the building, the statuary did not fall down, the\r\n     pictures did not leap from their places, the doors did not refuse\r\n     to open, and the servants did not say, '_We don't allow niggers\r\n     in here_.'\r\n\r\n     \"A happy new year to you, and all the friends of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time of his visit in Europe a few friends, under the\r\ninspiration of one Mrs. Henry Richardson, raised money, purchased Mr.\r\nDouglass, and placed his freedom papers in his hands. The documents\r\nare of quaint historic value.\r\n\r\n     \"The following is a copy of these curious papers, both of my\r\n     transfer from Thomas to Hugh Auld, and from Hugh to myself:\r\n\r\n     \"Know all men by these Presents, That I, Thomas Auld, of Talbot\r\n     county, and state of Maryland, for and in consideration of the\r\n     sum of one hundred dollars, current money, to me paid by Hugh\r\n     Auld, of the city of Baltimore, in the said state, at and before\r\n     the sealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof,\r\n     I, the said Thomas Auld, do hereby acknowledge, have granted,\r\n     bargained, and sold, and by these presents do grant, bargain, and\r\n     sell unto the said Hugh Auld, his executors, administrators, and\r\n     assigns, ONE NEGRO MAN, by the name of FREDERICK BAILY, or\r\n     DOUGLASS, as he calls himself--he is now about twenty-eight years\r\n     of age--to have and to hold the said negro man for life.

The Church of Scotland and the press\r\nof England were distressed with the problem of slavery. The public\r\nconscience had been touched, and there was \"no rest for the wicked.\"\r\nMr. Douglass had received his name--Douglass--from Nathan Johnson, of\r\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts, because he had just been reading about the\r\nvirtuous Douglass in the works of Sir Walter Scott. How wonderful\r\nthen, in the light of a few years, that a fugitive slave from America,\r\nbearing one of the most powerful names in Scotland should lean against\r\nthe pillars of the _Free Church of Scotland_, and meet and vanquish\r\nits brightest and ablest teachers (the friends of slavery,\r\nunfortunately), Doctors Cunningham and Candlish!\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Garrison had built his school upon the\r\nfundamental idea that slavery was constitutional; and that in order to\r\nsecure the overthrow of the institution he was compelled to do his\r\nwork outside of the Constitution; and to effect the good desired, the\r\nUnion should be dissolved. With these views Mr. Douglass had coincided\r\nat first, and into the ranks of this party he had entered. But upon\r\nhis return from England he changed his residence and views about the\r\nsame time, and established his home and a newspaper in Rochester, New\r\nYork State. Mr. Douglass gave his reasons for leaving the Garrisonian\r\nparty as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"About four years ago, upon a reconsideration of the whole\r\n     subject, I became convinced that there was no necessity for\r\n     dissolving the 'union between the northern and southern states';\r\n     that to seek this dissolution was no part of my duty as an\r\n     abolitionist; that to abstain from voting, was to refuse to\r\n     exercise a legitimate and powerful means for abolishing slavery;\r\n     and that the constitution of the United States not only contained\r\n     no guarantees in favor of slavery, but, on the contrary, it is,\r\n     in its letter and spirit, an anti-slavery instrument, demanding\r\n     the abolition of slavery as a condition of its own existence, as\r\n     the supreme law of the land.\"[125]\r\n\r\nIt was charged by some persons that for financial reasons Mr. Douglass\r\nchanged his views and residence; that the Garrisonians were poor; but\r\nthat Gerrit Smith was rich; and that he assisted Mr. Douglass in\r\nestablishing the \"North Star,\" a weekly paper. But Mr. Douglass was a\r\nman of boldness of thought and independence of character; and whatever\r\nthe motives were which led him away from his early friends he at least\r\ndeserved credit for possessing the courage necessary to such a change.\r\nBut Mr. Douglass was not the only anti-slavery man who imagined that\r\nthe Constitution was an anti-slavery instrument. This was the error of\r\nCharles Sumner. Slavery was as legal as the right of the Government to\r\ncoin money. As has been shown already, it was recognized and protected\r\nby law when the British sceptre ruled the colonies; it was recognized\r\nby all the courts during the Confederacy; it was acknowledged as a\r\nlegal fact by the Treaty of Paris of 1782, and of Ghent in 1814: the\r\ngentlemen who framed the Constitution fixed the basis of\r\nrepresentation in Congress upon three fifths of the slaves; and gave\r\nthe owners of slaves a fugitive slave law, at the birth of the\r\nnation, by which to hunt their slaves in all the States and\r\nTerritories of North America. But Mr. Douglass lived long enough to\r\nsee that he was wrong and Mr. Garrison right; that the dissolution of\r\nthe Union was the only way to free his race. In his way he did his\r\npart as faithfully and as honestly as any of his brethren in either\r\none of the anti-slavery parties.\r\n\r\nHaving established a reputation as an orator in England and America;\r\nand having lifted over the tangled path of his fugitive brethren the\r\nunerring, friendly \"North Star,\" he now turned his attention to\r\ndebating. It was a matter of regret that two such powerful and\r\naccomplished orators as Frederick Douglass and Samuel Ringgold Ward\r\nshould have taken up so much precious time in splitting hairs on the\r\nconstitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery. Perhaps it did\r\ngood. It certainly did the men good. It was an education to them, and\r\nexciting to their audiences. Mr. Douglass's forte was in oratory; in\r\nexposing the hideousness of slavery and the wrongs of his race. Mr.\r\nWard--a _protégé_ of Gerrit Smith's--was scholarly, thoughtful,\r\nlogical, and eloquent. Mr. Douglass was generally worsted in debate,\r\nbut always triumphant in oratory. A careful study of Mr. Douglass's\r\nspeeches from the time he began his career as a public speaker down to\r\nthe present time reveals wonderful progress in their grammatical and\r\nsynthetical structure. He grew all the time. On the 12th of May, 1846,\r\nhe delivered a speech at Finsbury Chapel, Moorfields, England, from\r\nwhich the following is extracted:\r\n\r\n     \"All the slaveholder asks of me is silence. He does not ask me to\r\n     go abroad and preach _in favor_ of slavery; he does not ask any\r\n     one to do that. He would not say that slavery is a good thing,\r\n     but the best under the circumstances. The slaveholders want total\r\n     darkness on the subject. They want the hatchway shut down, that\r\n     the monster may crawl in his den of darkness, crushing human\r\n     hopes and happiness, destroying the bondman at will, and having\r\n     no one to reprove or rebuke him. Slavery shrinks from the light;\r\n     it hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest its deeds\r\n     should be reproved. To tear off the mask from this abominable\r\n     system, to expose it to the light of heaven, aye, to the heat of\r\n     the sun, that it may burn and wither it out of existence, is my\r\n     object in coining to this country. I want the slaveholder\r\n     surrounded, as by a wall of anti-slavery fire, so that he may see\r\n     the condemnation of himself and his system glaring down in\r\n     letters of light. I want him to feel that he has no sympathy in\r\n     England, Scotland, or Ireland; that he has none in Canada, none\r\n     in Mexico, none among the poor wild Indians; that the voice of\r\n     the civilized, aye, and savage world is against him. I would have\r\n     condemnation blaze down upon him in every direction, till,\r\n     stunned and overwhelmed with shame and confusion, he is compelled\r\n     to let go the grasp he holds upon the persons of his victims, and\r\n     restore them to their long-lost rights.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1846. On the 5th of July, 1852, at Rochester, New York,\r\nhe, perhaps, made the most effective speech of his life. The poet\r\nSheridan has written: \"Eloquence consists in the man, the subject, and\r\nthe occasion.\" None of these conditions were wanting. There was the\r\nman, the incomparable Douglass; the wrongs of slavery was his subject;\r\nand the occasion was the 4th of July.\r\n\r\n     \"FELLOW-CITIZENS:--Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I\r\n     called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I\r\n     represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great\r\n     principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied\r\n     in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I,\r\n     therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the\r\n     national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express devout\r\n     gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to\r\n     us?\r\n\r\n     \"Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative\r\n     answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then\r\n     would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For\r\n     who is there so cold, that a nation's sympathy could not warm\r\n     him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that\r\n     would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so\r\n     stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the\r\n     hallelujahs of a nation's jubilee, when the chains of servitude\r\n     had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like\r\n     that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the 'lame man leap as\r\n     an hart.'\r\n\r\n     \"But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad\r\n     sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the\r\n     pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only\r\n     reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in\r\n     which you this day rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich\r\n     inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence,\r\n     bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The\r\n     sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought\r\n     stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is _yours_, not\r\n     _mine_. _You_ may rejoice, _I_ must mourn. To drag a man in\r\n     fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call\r\n     upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and\r\n     sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking\r\n     me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct.\r\n     And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a\r\n     nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by\r\n     the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable\r\n     ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and\r\n     woe-smitten people.\r\n\r\n     \"'By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when\r\n     we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the\r\n     midst thereof. For there they that carried us away captive\r\n     required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us\r\n     mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How shall we\r\n     sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O\r\n     Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not\r\n     remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.'\r\n\r\n     \"Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the\r\n     mournful wail of millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous\r\n     yesterday, are to-day rendered more intolerable by the jubilant\r\n     shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully\r\n     remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, 'may my\r\n     right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the\r\n     roof of my mouth!' To forget them, to pass lightly over their\r\n     wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason\r\n     most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before\r\n     God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN\r\n     SLAVERY. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics\r\n     from the slave's point of view. Standing there, identified with\r\n     the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate\r\n     to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of\r\n     this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of\r\n     July. Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the\r\n     professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems\r\n     equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past,\r\n     false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to\r\n     the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave\r\n     on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is\r\n     outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name\r\n     of the Constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and\r\n     trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all\r\n     the emphasis I can command, every thing that serves to perpetuate\r\n     slavery--the great sin and shame of America! 'I will not\r\n     equivocate; I will not excuse'; I will use the severest language\r\n     I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man,\r\n     whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at\r\n     heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech in England was labored, heavy, and some portions of it\r\nambitious. But here are measured sentences, graceful transitions,\r\ntruth made forcible, and the oratory refined. Thus he went on from\r\ngood to better, until the managers of leading lecture-courses of the\r\nland felt that the season would not be a success without Frederick\r\nDouglass. He began to venture into deeper water; to expound problems\r\nnot exactly in line with the only theme that he was complete master\r\nof. His attempts at wit usually missed fire. He could not be funny. He\r\nwas in earnest from the first moment the light broke into his mind in\r\nBaltimore. He was rarely eloquent except when denouncing slavery. He\r\nwas not at his best in abstract thought: too much logic dampened his\r\nenthusiasm; and an attempt at elaborate preparation weakened his\r\ndiscourse. He was majestic when speaking of the insults he had\r\nreceived or the wrongs his race were suffering. Martin Luther said\r\nduring the religious struggle in Germany for freedom of thought:\r\n\"Sorrow has pressed many sweet songs out of me.\" It was the sorrows of\r\nthe child-heart of Douglass the chattel, and the sorrows of the great\r\nman-heart of Douglass the human being, that gave the world such\r\nremarkable eloquence. There were but two chords in his soul that could\r\nyield a rich sound, viz.: sorrow and indignation. Sorrow for the\r\nhelpless slave, and indignation against the heartless master, made him\r\ngrand, majestic, and eloquent beyond comparison.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was going constantly he saved his means, and raised a\r\nfamily of two girls--one dying in her teens, an affliction he took\r\ndeeply to heart--and three boys. When the war was on at high tide, and\r\nColored soldiers required, he gave all he had, three stalwart boys,\r\nwhile he made it very uncomfortable for the Copperheads at home. At\r\nthe close of the war he moved to Washington and became deeply\r\ninterested in the practical work of reconstruction. He was appointed\r\none of the Commissioners to visit San Domingo, when General Grant\r\nrecommended its annexation to the United States; was a trustee of\r\nHoward University and of the Freedman's Savings Bank and Trust\r\nCompany. Unfortunately he accepted the presidency of the latter\r\ninstitution after nearly all the thieves had got through with it, and\r\nwas its official head when the crash and ruin came.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass's home[126] life has been pure and elevated. He has done\r\nwell by his boys; and has aided many young men to places of usefulness\r\nand profit. He strangely and violently opposed the exodus of his race\r\nfrom the South, and thereby incurred the opposition of the Northern\r\npress and the anathemas of the Colored people. It was not just the\r\nthing, men said--white and black,--for a man who had been a slave in\r\nthe South, and had come North to find a market for his labor, to\r\noppose his brethren in their flight from economic slavery and the\r\nshot-gun policy of the South. His efforts to state and justify his\r\nposition before the Colored people of New York were received with an\r\nimpatient air and tolerated even for the time with ill grace. Before\r\nthe Social Science Congress at Saratoga, New York, he met Richard T.\r\nGreener, a young Colored man, in a discussion of this subject. But Mr.\r\nGreener, a son of Harvard College, with a keen and merciless logic,\r\ncut right through the sophistries of Mr. Douglass; and although the\r\nlatter gentleman threw bouquets at the audience, and indulged in the\r\nmost exquisite word-painting, he was compelled to leave the field a\r\nvanquished disputant.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes appointed Mr. Douglass United States Marshall for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, an office which he held until President Garfield\r\nmade him Recorder of Deeds for the same district. He has accumulated a\r\ncomfortable little fortune, has published three books, edited two\r\nnewspapers, passed through a checkered and busy life; and to-day, full\r\nof honors and years, he stands confessedly as the first man of his\r\nrace in North America. Not that he is the greatest in every sense; but\r\nconsidering \"the depths from whence he came,\" the work he has\r\naccomplished, the character untarnished,--his memory and character,\r\nlike the granite shaft, will have an enduring and undying place in the\r\ngratitude of humanity throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the representative young men of color in the United States--and\r\nnow, happily in the process of time, their name is legion--Richard\r\nTheodore Greener has undisputed standing. He was born in Pennsylvania\r\nin 1844, but spent most of his life in Massachusetts. His father and\r\ngrandfather were men of unusual intelligence, social energy, and\r\npublic spirit. Richard T. early manifested an eagerness to learn and a\r\ncapacity to retain and utilize. He enjoyed better surroundings in\r\nchildhood than the average Colored child a generation ago; and always\r\naccustomed to hear the English correctly spoken, he had in himself\r\nall the required conditions to acquire a thorough education. Having\r\nobtained a start in the common schools, he turned to Oberlin College,\r\nLorain County, Ohio,--at that time an institution toward which the\r\nColored people of the country were very partial, and whose\r\nanti-slavery professors they loved with wonderful tenderness. For some\r\nof these professors, in the _Oberlin-Wellington Rescue Case_, had\r\npreferred imprisonment in preference to obedience to the unholy\r\nfugitive-slave law. The years of 1862-3 were spent at Oberlin, and Mr.\r\nGreener showed himself an excellent student. His ambition was to excel\r\nin every thing. Not exactly satisfied with the course of studies at\r\nOberlin, he went to Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. This\r\ninstitution was a feeder for Harvard, and using uniform text-books he\r\nwas placed in line and harmony with the course of studies to be\r\npursued at Cambridge. He entered Harvard College in the autumn of\r\n1865, and graduated with high honors in 1870.[127] He was the first of\r\nhis race to enter this famous university, and while there did himself\r\ncredit, and honored the race from which he sprang. All his\r\nperformances were creditable. He won a second prize for reading aloud\r\nin his freshman year; in his sophomore year he won the first prize for\r\nthe Boylston Declamation, notwithstanding members of the junior and\r\nsenior classes contested. During his junior year he did not contest,\r\npreferring to tutor two of the competitors who were successful. In his\r\nsenior year he won the two highest prizes, viz: the First Bowdoin for\r\na Dissertation on \"The Tenures of Land in Ireland,\" and the \"Boylston\r\nPrize for Oratory.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance, achievements, and graduation of Mr. Greener received the\r\nthoughtful and grateful attention of the press of Europe and America;\r\nwhile what he did was a stimulating example to the young men of his\r\nrace in the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his graduation there was a great demand for and a\r\nwide-spread need of educated Colored men as teachers. The Institute\r\nfor Colored Youth, in Philadelphia, had been but recently deprived of\r\nits principal, Prof. E. D. Bassett, who had been sent as Resident\r\nMinister and Consul-General to the Republic of Hayti. Mr. Greener was\r\ncalled to take the chair vacated by Mr. Bassett. He was principal of\r\nthis institution from Sept., 1870, to Dec., 1872. From Philadelphia he\r\nwas called to fill a similar position in Sumner High School, at\r\nWashington, D. C. He did not remain long in Washington. His fame as an\r\neducator had grown until he was celebrated as a teacher throughout the\r\ncountry. He was offered and accepted the Chair of Metaphysics and\r\nLogic in the University of South Carolina, situate at Columbia. He\r\nremained here until 1877, when the Hampton Government found no virtue\r\nin a Negro as a teacher in an institution of the fame and standing of\r\nthis university. In 1877 he was made Dean of the Law Department of\r\nHoward University, Washington, D. C., and held the position until\r\n1880. He graduated from the Law School of the University of South\r\nCarolina, and has practised in Washington since his residence there.\r\nIn addition to his work as teacher, lawyer, and orator, Prof. Greener\r\nwas associate editor of the _New National Era_ at Washington, D. C.,\r\nand his editorial _Young Men to the Front_, gave him a reputation as a\r\nprogressive and aggressive leader which he has sustained ever since\r\nwith marked ability.\r\n\r\nAs a political speaker he began while in college, in 1868, and has\r\ncontinued down to the present time. He is a pleasant speaker, and\r\nacceptable and efficient in a campaign. As an orator and writer he\r\nexcels. His early style was burdened, like that of the late Charles\r\nSumner, with a too-abundant classical illustration and quotation; but\r\nduring the last five years his illustrations are drawn largely from\r\nthe English classics and history. His ablest effort at oratory was his\r\noration on _Charles Sumner, the Idealist, Statesman, and Scholar_. It\r\nwas by all odds the finest effort of its kind delivered in this\r\ncountry. It was eminently fitting that a representative of the race\r\ntoward whose elevation Mr. Sumner contributed his splendid talents,\r\nand a graduate from the same College that honored Sumner, and from the\r\nState that gave him birth and opportunity, should give the true\r\nanalysis of his noble life and spotless character.\r\n\r\nIn the \"National Quarterly Review\" for July, 1880, Prof. Greener\r\nreplied to an article from the pen of Mr. James Parton on _Antipathy\r\nto the Negro_, published in the \"North American Review.\" Prof.\r\nGreener's theme was _The Intellectual Position of the Negro_. The\r\nfollowing paragraphs give a fair idea of the style of Mr. Greener:\r\n\r\n     \"The writer himself appears not to feel such an antipathy to us\r\n     that it must need find expression; for his liberality is well\r\n     known to those who have read his writings for the past fifteen\r\n     years. Nor is there any apparent ground for its appearance\r\n     because of any new or startling exhibitions of _antipathia_\r\n     against us noticeable at the present time. No argument was needed\r\n     to prove that there has been an unreasonable and unreasoning\r\n     prejudice against negroes as a class, a long-existing antipathy,\r\n     seemingly, ineradicable, sometimes dying out it would appear, and\r\n     then bursting forth afresh from no apparent cause. If Mr. Parton\r\n     means to assert that such prejudice is ineradicable, or is\r\n     increasing, or is even rapidly passing away, then is his venture\r\n     insufficient, because it fails to support either of these views.\r\n     It does not even attempt to show that the supposed antipathy is\r\n     general, for the author expressly, and, we think, very properly,\r\n     relegates its exercise to those whom he calls the most\r\n     ignorant--the 'meanest' of mankind.\r\n\r\n     \"If his intention was to attack a senseless antipathy, hold it up\r\n     to ridicule, show its absurdity, analyze its constituent parts,\r\n     and suggest some easy and safe way for Americans to rid\r\n     themselves of unchristian and un-American prejudices, then has he\r\n     again conspicuously failed to carry out such purpose. He asserts\r\n     the existence of antipathies, but only by inference does he\r\n     discourage their maintenance, although on other topics he is\r\n     rather outspoken whenever he cares to express his own\r\n     convictions.\r\n\r\n     \"On this question Mr. Parton is, to say the least, vacillating,\r\n     because he fails to exhibit any platform upon which we may combat\r\n     those who support early prejudices and justify their continuance\r\n     from the mere fact of their existence. We never expect Mr.\r\n     Gayarré and Mr. Henry Watterson to look calmly and\r\n     dispassionately at these questions from the negro's point of\r\n     view. The one gives us the old argument of De Bow's _Review_, and\r\n     the other deals out the _ex parte_ views of the present leaders\r\n     of the South. The one line of argument has been answered over and\r\n     over again by the old anti-slavery leaders; the pungent\r\n     generalizations of the latter, the present generation of negroes\r\n     can answer whenever the opportunity is afforded them.\r\n\r\n     \"But Mr. Parton was born in a cooler and calmer atmosphere, where\r\n     men are accustomed to give a reason for the faith that is in\r\n     them, and hence it is necessary, in opening any discussion such\r\n     as he had provoked, that he should assign some ground of\r\n     opposition or support--Christian, Pagan, utilitarian,\r\n     constitutional, optimist, or pessimist.\r\n\r\n     \"The very apparent friendliness of his intentions makes even a\r\n     legitimate conclusion from him seem mere conjecture, likely to be\r\n     successfully controverted by any subtle thinker and opponent. No\r\n     definite conclusion is, indeed, reached with regard to the first\r\n     query (Jefferson's fourteenth) with which Mr. Parton opens his\r\n     article: Whether the white and black races can live together on\r\n     this continent as equals. He lets us see at the close,\r\n     incidentally only, what his opinion is, and it inclines to the\r\n     negative. But throughout the article he is in the anomalous and\r\n     dubious position of one who opens a discussion which he cannot\r\n     end, and the logical result of whose own opinion he dares not\r\n     boldly state. The illustrations of the early opinions of Madison\r\n     and Jefferson only show how permanent a factor the negro is in\r\n     American history and polity, and how utterly futile are all\r\n     attempts at his expatriation. Following Mr. Parton's advice, the\r\n     negro has always prudently abstained from putting 'himself\r\n     against inexorable facts.' He is careful, however, to make sure\r\n     of two things,--that the alleged facts are verities and that they\r\n     are inexorable. Prejudice we acknowledge as a fact; but we know\r\n     that it is neither an ineradicable nor an inexorable one. We find\r\n     fault with Mr. Parton because he starts a trail on antipathy,\r\n     evidently purposeless, and fails to track it down either\r\n     systematically or persistently, but branches off, _desipere in\r\n     loco_, to talk loosely of 'physical antipathy,' meaning what we\r\n     usually term natural antipathy; and at last, emerging from the\r\n     'brush,' where he has been hopelessly beating about from Pliny to\r\n     Mrs. Kemble, he gains a partial 'open' once more by asserting a\r\n     truism--that it is the 'ignorance of a despised class' (the lack\r\n     of knowledge we have of them) which nourishes these 'insensate\r\n     antipathies.' Here we are at one with Mr. Parton. Those who know\r\n     us most intimately, who have associated with us in the nursery,\r\n     at school, in college, in trade, in the tenderer and confidential\r\n     relations of life, in health, in sickness, and in death, as\r\n     trusted guides, as brave soldiers, as magnanimous enemies, as\r\n     educated and respected men and women, give up all senseless\r\n     antipathies, and feel ashamed to Confess they ever cherished any\r\n     prejudice against a race whose record is as unsullied as that of\r\n     any in the land.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passages from a most brilliant speech at the Dinner of\r\nthe Harvard Club of New York, exhibit a pure, perspicuous, and\r\ncharming style:\r\n\r\n     \"What Sir John Coleridge in his 'Life of Keble' says of the\r\n     traditions and influences of Oxford, each son of Harvard must\r\n     feel is true also of Cambridge. The traditions, the patriotic\r\n     record, and the scholarly attainments of her alumni are the pride\r\n     of the College. Her contribution to letters, to statesmanship,\r\n     and to active business life, will keep her memory perennially\r\n     green. Not one of the humblest of her children, who has felt the\r\n     touch of her pure spirit, or enjoyed the benefits of her culture,\r\n     can fail to remember what she expects of her sons wherever they\r\n     may be: to stand fast for good government, to maintain the\r\n     right, to uphold honesty and character, to be, if nothing else,\r\n     good citizens, and to perform, to the extent of their ability,\r\n     every duty assumed or imposed upon them,--democratic in their\r\n     aristocracy, catholic in their liberality, impartial in judgment,\r\n     and uncompromising in their convictions of duty. [Cheers and\r\n     applause.]\r\n\r\n     \"Harvard's impartiality was not demonstrated solely by my\r\n     admission to the College. In 1770, when Crispus Attucks died a\r\n     patriot martyr on State Street, she answered the rising spirit of\r\n     independence and liberty by abolishing all distinctions founded\r\n     upon color, blood, and rank. Since that day, there has been but\r\n     one test for all. Ability, character, and merit,--these are the\r\n     sole passports to her favor. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n     \"When, in my adopted State, I stood on the battered ramparts of\r\n     Wagner, and recalled the fair-haired son of Harvard who died\r\n     there with his brave black troops of Massachusetts,--\r\n\r\n                \"'him who, deadly hurt, agen\r\n          Flashed on afore the charge's thunder,\r\n            Tippin' with fire the bolt of men,\r\n          Thet rived the Rebel line asunder,'--\r\n\r\n     I thanked God, with patriotic pleasure, that the first contingent\r\n     of negro troops from the North should have been led to death and\r\n     fame by an alumnus of Harvard; and I remembered, with additional\r\n     pride of race and college, that the first regiment of black\r\n     troops raised on South Carolina soil were taught to drill, to\r\n     fight, to plough, and to read by a brave, eloquent, and scholarly\r\n     descendant of the Puritans and of Harvard, Thomas Wentworth\r\n     Higginson. [Great applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\n     \"Is it strange, then, brothers, that I there resolved for myself\r\n     to maintain the standard of the College, so far as I was able, in\r\n     public and in private life? I am honored by the invitation to be\r\n     present here to-night. Around me I see faces I have not looked\r\n     upon for a decade. Many are the intimacies of the College, the\r\n     society, the buskin, and the oar which they bring up, from\r\n     classmates and college friends. I miss, as all Harvard men must\r\n     miss to-night, the venerable and kindly figure of Andrew Preston\r\n     Peabody, the student's friend, the consoler of the plucked, the\r\n     encourager of the strong, Mæcenas's benign almoner, the\r\n     felicitous exponent of Harvard's Congregational Unitarianism. I\r\n     miss, too, another of high scholarship, of rare poetic taste, of\r\n     broad liberality--my personal friend, Elbridge Jefferson Cutler,\r\n     loved alike by students and his fellow-members of the Faculty for\r\n     his conscientious performance of duty and his genial nature.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President and brothers, my time is up. I give you 'Fair\r\n     Harvard,' the exemplar, the prototype of that ideal America, of\r\n     which the greatest American poet has written,--\r\n\r\n          \"'Thou, taught by Fate to know Jehovah's plan,\r\n          Thet man's devices can't unmake a man,\r\n          An' whose free latch-string never was drawed in\r\n          Against the poorest child of Adam's kin.\"\r\n\r\n     \"[Great applause.]\"\r\n\r\nProf. Greener rendered legal services in the case of Cadet Whittaker\r\nat West Point, and in the trial at New York City, where, as associate\r\ncounsel with ex-Gov. Chamberlain,--an able lawyer and a magnificent\r\norator,--he developed ability and industry as an attorney, and earned\r\nthe gratitude of his race.\r\n\r\nProf. Greener entered Harvard as a member of the Baptist Church; but\r\nthe transcendentalism and rationalism of the place quite swept him\r\nfrom his spiritual moorings. In a recent address before a literary\r\nsociety in Washington, D. C., he is represented to have maintained\r\nthat Mohammedanism was better for the indigenous races of Africa than\r\nChristianity. Dr. John William Draper made a similar mistake in his\r\n\"_Conflict between Religion and Science!_\" The learned doctor should\r\nhave written \"Conflict between the Church and Science.\" Religion is\r\nnot and never was at war with science. Prof. Greener should have\r\nwritten, \"Mohammedanism better for the Africans than Snake Worship.\"\r\nThis brilliant young man cannot afford to attempt to exalt\r\nMohammedanism above the cross of our dear Redeemer, and expect to have\r\nleadership in the Negro race in America. Nor can he support the\r\ndetestable ideas and execrable philosophy of Senator John P. Jones,\r\nwhich seek to shut out the Chinaman from free America. The Negro must\r\nstand by the weak in a fight like this, remembering the pit from which\r\nhe was dug. But Prof. Greener is young as well as talented; and seeing\r\nhis mistake, will place himself in harmony with not only the rights of\r\nhis race, but those of humanity everywhere.\r\n\r\nBlanche K. Bruce was born a slave on a plantation in Prince Edward\r\nCounty, Virginia, March 1, 1841, and in the very month and week of the\r\nanniversary of his birth he was sworn in as United States Senator from\r\nMississippi. Reared a slave there was nothing in his early life of an\r\nunusual nature. He secured his freedom at the end of the war, and\r\nimmediately sought the opportunities and privileges that would, if\r\nproperly used, fit him for his new life as a man and a citizen. He\r\nwent to Oberlin College where, in the Preparatory Department, he\r\napplied himself to his studies, attached himself to his classmates by\r\ncharming personal manners, and gentlemanly deportment. He realized\r\nthat there were many splendid opportunities awaiting young men of\r\ncolor at the South; and that profitable positions were going begging.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce made his appearance in Mississippi at an opportune moment.\r\nThe State was just undergoing a process of reconstruction. He appeared\r\nat the capital, Jackson, with seventy-five cents in his pocket; was a\r\nstranger to every person in the city. He mingled in the great throng,\r\njoined in the discussions that took place by little knots of\r\npoliticians, made every man his friend to whom he talked, and when the\r\nState Senate was organized secured the position of Sergeant-at-arms.\r\nHe attracted the attention of Gov. Alcorn, who appointed him a member\r\nof his staff with the rank of colonel. Col. Bruce was not merely\r\nSergeant-at-arms of the Senate, but was a power behind that body. His\r\nintelligence, his knowledge of the character of the legislation needed\r\nfor the people of Mississippi, and the excellent impression he made\r\nupon the members, gave him great power in suggesting and influencing\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe sheriffs of Mississippi were not elected in those days; and the\r\nGovernor had to look a good ways to find the proper men for such\r\npositions. His faith in Col. Bruce as a man and an officer led him to\r\nselect him to be sheriff of Bolivar County. Col. Bruce discharged the\r\ndelicate duties of his office with eminent ability, and attained a\r\npopularity very remarkable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, while other politicians were dropping their money at\r\nthe gaming-table and in the wine cup, Col. Bruce was saving his funds,\r\nand after purchasing a splendid farm at Floraville, on the Mississippi\r\nRiver, he made cautious and profitable investments in property and\r\nbonds. His executive ability was marvellous, and his successful\r\nmanagement of his own business and that of the people of the county\r\nmade him friends among all classes and in both political parties. He\r\nwas appointed tax-collector for his county, a position that was\r\ncalculated to tax the most accomplished financier and business man in\r\nthe State. But Col. Bruce took to the position rare abilities, and\r\nmanaged his office with such matchless skill, that when the term of\r\nHenry R. Pease expired, he was chosen United States Senator from\r\nMississippi on the third of February, 1875, for the constitutional\r\nterm of six years. He took his seat on the 4th of March, 1875.\r\n\r\nHe did nothing in the line of oratory while in the Senate. That was\r\nnot his forte. He was an excellent worker, a faithful committee-man,\r\nand finally was chairman of the Committee on the Freedman's Savings\r\nBank, etc. Mr. Bruce was chairman of the Committee on Mississippi\r\nLevees, where he performed good work. He presided over the Senate with\r\ndignity several times. To the charge that he was a \"silent Senator,\"\r\nit may be observed that it was infinitely better that he remained\r\nsilent, than in breaking the silence to exhibit a mental feebleness in\r\nattempting to handle problems to which most of the Senators had given\r\nyears of patient study. His conduct was admirable; his discretion\r\nwise; his service faithful, and his influence upon the honorable\r\nSenate and the country at large beneficial to himself and helpful to\r\nhis race.\r\n\r\nIn the convention of the Republican party at Chicago, in 1880, he was\r\na candidate for Vice-President. In the spring of 1881, after the close\r\nof his senatorial career the President nominated him to be Register of\r\nthe United States Treasury, and the nomination was confirmed without\r\nreference, after a complimentary speech from his associate, Senator L.\r\nQ. C. Lamar. He has appeared as a political speaker on several\r\noccasions. As nature did not intend him for this work, his efforts\r\nappear to be the products of hard labor, but nevertheless excellent;\r\nhis estimable and scholarly wife (_née_ Miss Wilson, of Cleveland,\r\nOhio) has been a great blessing to him;--a good wife and a helpful\r\ncompanion. From a penniless slave he has risen to the position of\r\nwriting his name upon the currency of the country. Register Bruce is a\r\ngenial gentleman, a fast friend, and an able officer.\r\n\r\nJohn Mercer Langston was born a slave in Virginia; is a graduate of\r\nOberlin College and Theological Institution, and as a lawyer, college\r\npresident, foreign minister, and politician, has exerted a wide\r\ninfluence for the good of his race. As Secretary of the Board of\r\nHealth for the District of Columbia, and as President of the Howard\r\nUniversity, he displayed remarkable executive ability and sound\r\nbusiness judgment. He is one of the bravest of the brave in public\r\nmatters, and his influence upon young Colored men has been wide-spread\r\nand admirable. He is now serving as Resident Minister and\r\nConsul-General to Hayti; and ranks among the best diplomats of our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, Charles L. Mitchell, George L. Ruffin, John J.\r\nSmith, J. B. Smith, and Wm. J. Walker have been members of the\r\nLegislature. In Illinois, a Colored man has held a position in the\r\nBoard of Commissioners for Cook County--Chicago; and one has been sent\r\nto the Legislature. In Ohio, two Colored men have been members of the\r\nLegislature, one from Cincinnati and the other from Cleveland. Gov.\r\nCharles Foster was the first Executive in any of the Northern States\r\nto appoint a Colored man to a responsible position; and in this, as in\r\nnearly every other thing, Ohio has taken the lead. The present member\r\n(John P. Green) of the Legislature of Ohio representing Cuyahoga\r\nCounty, is a young man of excellent abilities both as a lawyer and as\r\nan orator. John P. Green was born at New Berne, North Carolina, April\r\n2, 1845, of free parents. His father died in 1850, and his widow was\r\nleft to small resources in raising her family. But being an excellent\r\nseamstress she did very well for her five-year-old son, while she had\r\nan infant in her arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Mrs. Green moved to Ohio and located at Cleveland. Her son\r\nJohn was now able and willing to assist his mother some; and so as an\r\nerrand-boy he hired himself out for $4 per month. He obtained about a\r\nyear and one half of instruction in the common schools, and did well.\r\nIn 1862 he became a waiter in a hotel, and spent every leisure moment\r\nin study. He succeeded in learning something of Latin and Algebra,\r\nwithout a teacher.\r\n\r\nMr. Green had acquired an excellent style of composition, and to\r\nsecure funds with which to complete his education, he wrote and\r\npublished a pamphlet containing _Essays on Miscellaneous Subjects_, by\r\na self-educated Colored youth. He sold about 1,500 copies in Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, and New York, and then entered the Cleveland Central\r\nHigh School. He completed a four years' classical course in two years,\r\ntwo terms, and two months. He graduated at the head of a class of\r\ntwenty-three. He entered the law office of Judge Jesse P. Bishop, and\r\nin 1870 graduated from the Cleveland Law School. He turned his face\r\nSouthward, and having settled in South Carolina, began the practice of\r\nlaw, which was attended with great success. But the climate was not\r\nagreeable to his health, and in 1872 he returned to the scenes of his\r\nearly toils and struggles. He became a practising attorney in\r\nCleveland, and in the spring of 1873 was elected a justice of the\r\npeace for Cuyahoga County by a majority of 3,000 votes. He served\r\nthree terms as a justice, and in eight years of service as such\r\ndecided more than 12,000 cases. As a justice he has had no equal for\r\nmany years. In 1877 he was nominated for the Legislature, but was\r\ndefeated by sixty-two votes. In 1881 he was again before the people\r\nfor the Legislature, and was elected by a handsome majority.\r\n\r\nMr. Green is rather a remarkable young man; and with good health and a\r\nfair field he is bound to make a success. He will bear comparison with\r\nany of his associates in the Legislature; and, as a clear, impressive\r\nspeaker, has few equals in that body.\r\n\r\nThere are yet at least one hundred representative men of color worthy\r\nof the places they hold in the respect and confidence of their race\r\nand the country. Their number is rapidly increasing; and ere many\r\nyears there will be no lack of representative Colored men.[128]\r\n\r\nColored women had fewer privileges of education before the war, and\r\nindeed since the war, than the men of their race, yet, nevertheless,\r\nmany of these women have shown themselves capable and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCES ELLEN HARPER\r\n\r\nwas born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1825. She was not permitted to\r\nenjoy the blessings of early educational training, but in after-years\r\nproved herself to be a woman of most remarkable intellectual powers.\r\nShe applied herself to study, most assiduously; and when she had\r\nreached woman's estate was well educated.\r\n\r\nShe developed early a fondness for poetry, which she has since\r\ncultivated; and some of her efforts are not without merit. She excels\r\nas an essayist and lecturer. She has been heard upon many of the\r\nleading lecture platforms of the country; and her efforts to elevate\r\nher sisters have been crowned with most signal success.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY ANN SHADD CAREY,\r\n\r\nof Delaware, but more recently of Washington, D. C., as a lecturer,\r\nwriter, and school teacher, has done and is doing a great deal for the\r\neducational and social advancement of the Colored people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANNY M. JACKSON--\r\n\r\nat present Mrs. Fanny M. Jackson Coppin--was born in the District of\r\nColumbia, in 1837. Though left an orphan when quite a child, Mrs.\r\nSarah Clark, her aunt, took charge of her, and gave her a first-class\r\neducation. She prosecuted the gentlemen's course in Oberlin College,\r\nand graduated with high honors.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the need of educated teachers for the schools of\r\nher race, she accepted a position at once in the Institute for Colored\r\nYouth, at Philadelphia, Pa. And here for many years she has taught\r\nwith eminent success, and exerted a pure and womanly influence upon\r\nall the students that have come into her classes.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt she is the most thoroughly competent and successful of\r\nthe Colored women teachers of her time. And her example of race pride,\r\nindustry, enthusiasm, and nobility of character will remain the\r\ninheritance and inspiration of the pupils of the school she helped\r\nmake the pride of the Colored people of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISE DE MORTIE,\r\n\r\nof Norfolk, Virginia, was born of free parents in that place, in 1833,\r\nbut being denied the privileges of education, turned her face toward\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 she took up her residence in Boston. She immediately began to\r\navail herself of all the opportunities of education. A most beautiful\r\ngirl, possessed of a sweet disposition and a remarkable memory, she\r\nwon a host of friends, and took high standing as a pupil.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 she began a most remarkable career as a public reader. An\r\nelocutionist by nature, she added the refinement of the art; and with\r\nher handsome presence, engaging manners, and richly-toned voice, she\r\ntook high rank in her profession. Just as she was attracting public\r\nattention by her genius, she learned of the destitution that was\r\nwasting the Colored orphans of New Orleans. Thither she hastened in\r\nthe spirit of Christian love; and there she labored with an\r\nintelligence and zeal which made her a heroine among her people. In\r\n1867 she raised sufficient funds to build an asylum for the Colored\r\norphans of New Orleans. But just then the yellow fever overtook her in\r\nher work of mercy, and she fell a victim to its deadly touch on the\r\n10th of October, 1867, saying so touchingly, \"I belong to God, our\r\nFather,\" as she expired.\r\n\r\nAlthough cut off in the morning of a useful life, she is of blessed\r\nmemory among those for whose improvement and elevation she gave the\r\nstrength of a brilliant mind and the warmth of a genuine Christian\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS CHARLOTTE L. FORTUNE--\r\n\r\nnow the wife of the young and gifted clergyman, Rev. Frank J.\r\nGrimke,--is a native of Pennsylvania. She comes of one of the best\r\nColored families of the State. She went to Salem, Massachusetts, in\r\n1854, where she began a course of studies in the \"Higginson High\r\nSchool.\" She proved to be a student of more than usual application,\r\nand although a member of a class of white youths, Miss Fortune was\r\nawarded the honor of writing the Parting Hymn for the class. It was\r\nsung at the last examination, and was warmly praised by all who heard\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMiss Fortune became a contributor to the columns of the \"Anti-Slavery\r\nStandard\" and \"Atlantic Monthly.\" She wrote both prose and poetry, and\r\ndid admirably in each.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMONIA LEWIS,\r\n\r\nthe Negro sculptress, is in herself a great prophecy of the\r\npossibilities of her sisters in America. Of lowly birth, left an\r\norphan when quite young, unable to obtain a liberal education, she\r\nnevertheless determined to be somebody and do something.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, while yet in humble circumstances, she visited Boston.\r\nUpon seeing a statue of Benjamin Franklin she stood transfixed before\r\nit. It stirred the latent genius within the untutored child, and\r\nproduced an emotion she had never felt before. \"I, too, can make a\r\nstone man,\" she said. Almost instinctively, she turned to that great\r\nApostle of Human Liberty, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, and asked his advice.\r\nThe kind-hearted agitator gave her a note to Mr. Brackett, the Boston\r\nsculptor. He received her kindly, heard her express the desire and\r\nambition of her heart, and then giving her a model of a human foot and\r\nsome clay, said: \"Go home and make that. If there is any thing in you\r\nit will come out.\" She tried, but her teacher broke up her work and\r\ntold her to try again. And so she did, and triumphed.\r\n\r\nSince then, this ambitious Negro girl has won a position as an artist,\r\na studio in Rome, and a place in the admiration of the lovers of art\r\non two continents. She has produced many meritorious works of art, the\r\nmost noteworthy being _Hagar in the Wilderness_; a group of the\r\n_Madonna with the Infant Christ and_ _two adoring Angels_; _Forever\r\nFree_; _Hiawatha's Wooing_; a bust of _Longfellow, the Poet_; a bust\r\nof _John Brown_; and a medallion portrait of _Wendell Phillips_. The\r\n_Madonna_ was purchased by the Marquis of Bute, Disraeli's Lothair.\r\n\r\nShe has been well received in Rome, and her studio has become an\r\nobject of interest to travellers from all countries.\r\n\r\nOf late many intelligent young Colored women have risen to take their\r\nplaces in society, and as wives and mothers are doing much to elevate\r\nthe tone of the race and its homes. Great care must be given to the\r\neducation of the Colored women of America; for virtuous, intelligent,\r\neducated, cultured, and pious wives and mothers are the hope of the\r\nNegro race. Without them educated Colored men and the miraculous\r\nresults of emancipation will go for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[123] Hiram R. Revels was the successor of Mr. Jefferson Davis. He was\r\na Methodist preacher from Mississippi. It was our privilege to be\r\npresent in the Senate when he was sworn in and took his seat.\r\n\r\n[124] This idea had been put forth in a speech by Alexander H.\r\nStephens just after he had been chosen Vice-president of the\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\n[125] My Bondage and My Freedom, p. 396.\r\n\r\n[126] While this history is passing through the press, the sad\r\nintelligence comes of the death, after a painful illness, of his\r\nbeloved wife. All through her life she was justly proud of her husband\r\nand children; and she leaves a precious memory.\r\n\r\n[127] Mr. Greener was turned back one year upon the ground of alleged\r\nimperfection in mathematics; but it was done in support of an old\r\ntheory, long since exploded, that the Negro has no capacity for the\r\nsolution of mathematical problems. We know this to be the case. But\r\nthe charming nature and natural pluck of young Greener brought him out\r\nat last without a blemish in any of his studies.\r\n\r\n[128] Biography is quite a different thing from history; and the\r\nColored men who may imagine themselves neglected ought to remember\r\nthat this is a _History of the Negro Race_. We have mentioned these\r\nmen as representative of several classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.\r\n\r\n     ITS ORIGIN, GROWTH, ORGANIZATION, AND EXCELLENT INFLUENCE.--ITS\r\n     PUBLISHING HOUSE, PERIODICALS, AND PAPERS.--ITS NUMERICAL AND\r\n     FINANCIAL STRENGTH.--ITS MISSIONARY AND EDUCATIONAL\r\n     SPIRIT.--WILBERFORCE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church of America has exerted a wider\r\nand better influence upon the Negro race than any other organization\r\ncreated and managed by Negroes. The hateful and hurtful spirit of\r\ncaste and race prejudice in the Protestant Church during and after the\r\nAmerican Revolution drove the Negroes out. The Rev. Richard Allen, of\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, was the founder of the African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church. He gathered a few Christians in his private\r\ndwelling, during the year 1816, and organized a church and named it\r\n\"_Bethel_.\" Its first General Conference was held in Philadelphia\r\nduring the same year with the following representation:\r\n\r\nRev. Richard Allen, Jacob Tapsico, Clayton Durham, James Champion, and\r\nThomas Webster, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Daniel Coker, Richard\r\nWilliams, Henry Harden, Stephen Hill, Edward Williamson, and Nicholas\r\nGailliard, of Baltimore, Maryland; Peter Spencer, of Wilmington,\r\nDelaware; Jacob Marsh, Edward Jackson, and William Andrew, of\r\nAttleborough, Pennsylvania; Peter Cuff, of Salem, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the Conference of 1817 were lost, but in 1818 there\r\nwere seven itinerants: Baltimore Conference--Rev. Daniel Coker,\r\nRichard Williams, and Rev. Charles Pierce; Philadelphia\r\nConference--Bishop Allen, Rev. William Paul Quinn, Jacob Tapsico, and\r\nRev. Clayton Durham.\r\n\r\nThe Church grew mightily, increasing in favor with God and man. The\r\nzeal of its ministers was wonderful, and the spirit of missions and\r\nconsecration to the work wrought miracles for the cause. In 1826 the\r\nstrength of the Church was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Bishops                                              2\r\n  Annual conferences                                   2\r\n  Itinerant preachers                                 17\r\n  Stations                                             2\r\n  Circuits                                            10\r\n  Missions                                             5\r\n  Total number of members                          7,927\r\n  Amount of salary for travelling preachers    $1,054.50\r\n  Amount of incidental expenses                   $97.25\r\n\r\nThe grand total amount of money raised in 1826 for all purposes was\r\n$1,151.75. In 1836 there were:\r\n\r\n  Bishops                                              3\r\n  Conferences                                          4\r\n  Travelling preachers                                27\r\n  Stations                                             7\r\n  Circuits                                            18\r\n  Missions                                             2\r\n  Churches                                            86\r\n  Probable value of church property           $43,000.00\r\n  Total salary of pastors                      $1,126.29\r\n  Amount raised for general purposes             $259.59\r\n\r\nTotal amount of money raised in 1836 for all purposes, $1,385.88. The\r\ntotal number of members in 1836 was 7,594. This was a decrease of 333\r\nmembers, and is to be accounted for in the numerous sales of slaves in\r\nthe Baltimore Conference, as the decrease was in that conference.

M. Turner, reported the receipts\r\nin the Book Concern to be $50,133.76. This was the largest amount of\r\nbusiness ever reported by the Concern.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the two departments were $150,133.18. The total amount\r\nraised in 1826 was $1,151.75.

In 1817 the Rev. Richard Allen published a\r\nbook of discipline; and shortly after this a Church hymn-book was\r\npublished also. Beyond this there was but little done in this\r\ndepartment until 1841, when the New York Conference passed a\r\nresolution providing for the publication of a monthly magazine. But\r\nthe lack of funds compelled the projectors to issue it as a quarterly.\r\nFor nearly eight years this magazine exerted an excellent influence\r\nupon the ministers and members of the Church. Its coming was looked\r\nforward to with a strange interest. It contained the news in each of\r\nthe conferences; its editorials breathed a spirit of love and\r\nfellowship; and thus the members were brought to a knowledge of the\r\ncharacter of the work being accomplished.\r\n\r\nAt length the prosperity of the magazine seemed to justify the\r\npublication of a weekly paper. Accordingly a weekly journal, named the\r\n\"Christian Herald,\" made its appearance and ran its course for the\r\nspace of four years. In 1852, by order of the General Conference, the\r\npaper was enlarged and issued as the \"Christian Recorder,\" which has\r\ncontinued to be published up to the present time. In addition to this\r\na \"Child's Recorder\" is published as a monthly. About 50,000 copies of\r\nboth are issued every month.\r\n\r\nThe managers and editors in this department have been:\r\n\r\nFrom 1818 to 1826--Right-Reverened Richard Allen, First Bishop of the\r\nA. M. E. Church, served in the capacity of Bishop and General Book\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\nFrom 1826 to 1835--Rev. Jos. M. Corr. He was the first regularly\r\nappointed General Book Steward, and served until October, 1836, at\r\nwhich time he died.\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 to 1848--Rev. Geo. Hogarth.\r\n\r\nFrom 1848 to 1852--Rev. Augustus R. Green.\r\n\r\nFrom 1852 to 1854--Rev. M. M. Clark, Editor; Rev. W. T. Catto, General\r\nBook Steward, and Rev. W. H. Jones, Travelling Agent.\r\n\r\nFrom 1854 to 1860--Rev. J. P. Campbell (now Bishop) served in the\r\ncapacity of General Book Steward and Editor.\r\n\r\nFrom 1860 to 1868--Rev.

It has pushed its work into\r\n\"the regions beyond.\" In 1844 _The Parent Home and Foreign Missionary\r\nSociety_ was organized by the General Conference. Its first\r\ncorresponding secretary was appointed in 1864, John M. Brown,\r\nWashington, D.C.; 1865 to 1868, John M. Brown; 1868 to 1872, James A.\r\nHanday, Baltimore, Maryland; 1872, Rev. W. J.

JACKSON, D.D.,\r\n     _General Agent._\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1856 the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church decided to establish in that place a university for\r\nthe education of Colored youth. Its Board of Trustees consisted of\r\ntwenty white and four Colored men. Mr. Alfred J. Anderson, Rev. Lewis\r\nWoodson, Mr. Ishmael Keith, and Bishop Payne were the Colored members.\r\nAmong the former were State Senator M. D. Gatch and the late Salmon P.\r\nChase. It was dedicated in October, 1856, when the Rev. M. P. Gaddis\r\ntook charge. He held the position of Principal for one year, when he\r\nwas succeeded by Professor J. R. Parker, who worked faithfully and\r\nsuccessfully until 1859. Rev. R. T. Rust, D.D., became President upon\r\nthe retirement of Mr. Parker, and accomplished a noble work. He\r\nraised the educational standard of the school, attracted to its\r\nsupport and halls friends and pupils, and gained the confidence of\r\neducators and laymen within the outside of his denomination.\r\nUnfortunately, his faithful labors were most abruptly terminated by\r\nthe war of the Rebellion. The college doors were closed in 1862 for\r\nwant of funds; the main friends of the institution having cast their\r\nlot with the Confederate States. It should be remembered that up to\r\nthis time this college was in the hands of the white Methodist Church.\r\nThe Colored Methodists bought the land and buildings on the 10th of\r\nMarch, 1863, for the sum of $10,000. The land consisted of fifty-two\r\nacres, with an abundance of timber, fine springs, and a commodious\r\ncollege building with a dozen beautiful cottages. And the growth of\r\nthe institution under the management of Colored men is a credit to\r\ntheir Church and race.\r\n\r\nBishop D. H. Payne, D.D., was elected to the presidency of the\r\nuniversity, which position he has filled with rare fidelity and\r\nability for the last thirteen years. In 1876 Rev. B. F. Lee, a former\r\ngraduate of the college, was elected to occupy the presidential chair.\r\nIt was not a position to be sought after since it had been filled for\r\nthirteen years by the senior bishop of the Church, but Mr. Lee was the\r\nchoice of his official brethren and so was elected. President Lee is a\r\nnative of New Jersey. He is about the medium height, well knit, of\r\nlight complexion, dark hair and beard of the same color that covers a\r\nface handsomely moulded. He is plainly a man of excellent traits of\r\ncharacter; he is somewhat bald and has a finely-cut head, broad and\r\nmassive. He moves quickly, and impresses one as a man who is armed\r\nwith a large amount of executive tact. His face is of a thoughtful\r\ncast, and does not change much when he laughs. There were many\r\ndifficulties to hinder his administration when he took charge, but he\r\nsurmounted them all. Under his administration the institution has\r\ngrown financially and numerically.\r\n\r\nThe following report shows the financial condition of the college at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n  RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n  June 20, 1880.\r\n\r\n  Balance in Treasury, Avery Fund                 $10,000 00\r\n     \"           \"     Rust Prize Fund                100 00\r\n     \"           \"     cash                            63 82\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n     Total balance                                $10,163 82\r\n\r\n  RECEIPTS.--(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n  Balance                                                    $10,163 82\r\n  Received from Financial Secretary                   200 00\r\n      \"      \"  tuition                             1,604 49\r\n      \"      \"  dormitories                           525 80\r\n      \"      \"  Unitarian Association                 600 00\r\n  Received from loans                                 100 00\r\n  Received from interest from Avery Fund              800 00\r\n  Received from interest from Rust Fund                 8 00\r\n  Received from General Agent                         150 00\r\n      \"      \"  contributions                         232 00\r\n      \"      \"  Philadelphia Conference                52 95\r\n  Received from Illinois Conference                    30 00\r\n      \"      \"  bequest of John Pfaff                 602 08\r\n  Received from miscellaneous                         407 64\r\n                                                    --------  $5,312 96\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n    Total receipts                                           $15,476 78\r\n                                                             ==========\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXPENDITURES.\r\n\r\n  To salaries                                                 $3,166 15\r\n   \" building and grounds                                        243 25\r\n   \" furnishing building                                         177 37\r\n   \" notes paid with interest                                    285 86\r\n   \" lectures                                                    600 00\r\n   \" fuel                                                        116 64\r\n   \" Powers' Fund interest                                       114 90\r\n   \" incidental                                                  296 17\r\n   \" insurance                                                   219 00\r\n   \" miscellaneous                                               144 21\r\n                                                              ---------\r\n    Total expenditures                                        $5,363 55\r\n\r\n  Balance in bank--Avery Fund securities          $10,000 00\r\n  Balance in bank--Rust Fund securities               100 00\r\n  Balance in bank--cash                                13 23\r\n                                                  ---------- $10,113 23\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n                                                             $15,476 78\r\n                                                             ==========\r\n\r\n  STATEMENT OF CASH RECEIPTS, FROM 1865 TO 1881.\r\n\r\n  1865 to 1866     $10,677 82\r\n  1866 to 1867       6,717 88\r\n  1867 to 1868       9,000 00\r\n  1868 to 1869       5,403 83\r\n  1869 to 1870       9,498 24\r\n  1870 to 1871      28,672 22\r\n  1871 to 1872       7,270 31\r\n  1872 to 1873       4,452 30\r\n  1873 to 1874       6,129 77\r\n  1874 to 1875       4,962 50\r\n  1875 to 1876       7,805 36\r\n  1876 to 1877      13,757 66\r\n  1877 to 1878      14,429 15\r\n  1878 to 1879       4,944 37\r\n  1879 to 1880       6,942 98\r\n  1880 to 1881       5,312 96\r\n                  -----------\r\n  Total           $145,977 35\r\n\r\nThe following-named persons are the bishops of the Church: James A.\r\nShorter, Daniel A.

Commencing with nothing--save an\r\nunfaltering faith in God,--this Church has grown to magnificent\r\nproportions. Her name has gone to the ends of the earth. In the\r\nEcumenical Council of the Methodists in London, 1881, its\r\nrepresentatives made a splendid impression; and their addresses and\r\npapers took high rank.\r\n\r\nThis Church has taught the Negro how to govern and how to submit to\r\ngovernment. It has kept its membership under the influence of\r\nwholesome discipline, and for its beneficent influence upon the morals\r\nof the race, it deserves the praise and thanks of mankind.[129]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[129] We have to thank the Rev. B. W. Arnett, B.D., the Financial\r\nSecretary, for the valuable statistics used in this chapter.

Thomas Webb were the germ from\r\nwhich, in the good providence of God, has sprung the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church in the United States of America. The first chapel was\r\nerected upon leased ground on John Street, New York City, in 1768. The\r\nground was purchased in 1770. Subscriptions were asked and received\r\nfrom all classes of people for the building, from the mayor of the\r\ncity down to African female servants known only by their Christian\r\nnames. Here the Colored people became first identified with American\r\nMethodism. From this stock have sprung all who have been subsequently\r\nconnected with it. Meetings were held, prior to the erection of John\r\nStreet Church, in the private residence of Mrs. Heck, and in a\r\nrigging-loft, sixty by eighteen feet, in William Street, which was\r\nrented in 1767. Here Capt. Webb and Mr. Embury preached thrice a week\r\nto large audiences. The original design to erect a chapel must be\r\ncredited to Mrs. Heck, the foundress of American Methodism. Mr.\r\nRichard Owen, a convert of Robert Strawbridge, the founder of\r\nMethodism in Baltimore, was the first native Methodist preacher on the\r\ncontinent. The first American Annual Conference was held in\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., twenty-nine years after Mr. Wesley held his first\r\nconference in England, with ten members, precisely the same number\r\nthere were in his. They were Thos. Rankin, President; Richard\r\nBoardman, Joseph Pilmoor, Francis Asbury, Richard Wright, George\r\nShadford, Thomas Webb, John King, Abraham Whiteworth, and Joseph\r\nYearbry. It began Wednesday the 14th and closed Friday the 16th of\r\nJuly, 1773. All the members were foreigners, and in the Revolution\r\nmany of them were subject to unjust suspicions of sympathy with\r\nEngland, in consequence of this fact alone. The aggregate statistical\r\nreturns for this conference showed 1,160, which was much less than Mr.\r\nRankin supposed to be the strength of Methodism in America.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September, 1784, Rev. Thomas Coke, D.D., LL.D., a\r\npresbyter in the Church of England, was ordained by John Wesley, A.M.,\r\nSuperintendent or Bishop of the Methodist Societies in America. He was\r\ncharged with a commission to organize them into an Episcopal Church,\r\nand to ordain Mr. Francis Asbury an Associate Bishop. He sailed for\r\nAmerica at 10 o'clock A.M., September 18th, and landed at New York,\r\nWednesday, November 3, 1784. Mr. Coke at once set out on a tour of\r\nobservation, accompanied by Harry Hosier, Mr. Asbury's travelling\r\nservant, a Colored minister. Hosier was one of the notable characters\r\nof that day. He was the first American Negro preacher of the M. E.\r\nChurch in the United States. In 1780 Mr. Asbury alluded to him as a\r\ncompanion, suitable to preach to the Colored people. Dr. Rush,\r\nallowing for his illiteracy--for he could not read--pronounced him the\r\ngreatest orator in America. He was small in stature and very black;\r\nbut he had eyes of remarkable brilliancy and keenness; and singular\r\nreadiness and aptness of speech. He travelled extensively with Asbury,\r\nCoke, and Whiteworth. He afterward travelled through New England. He\r\nexcelled all the whites in popularity as a preacher; sharing with them\r\nin their public services, not only in Colored but also in white\r\ncongregations. When they were sick or otherwise disabled they could\r\ntrust the pulpit to Harry without fear of unfavorably disappointing\r\nthe people. Mr. Asbury acknowledges that the best way to obtain a\r\nlarge congregation was to announce that Harry would preach. The\r\nmultitude preferred him to the Bishop himself. Though he withstood for\r\nyears the temptations of extraordinary popularity, he fell,\r\nnevertheless, by the indulgent hospitalities which were lavished upon\r\nhim. He became temporarily the victim of wine; but possessed moral\r\nstrength enough to recover himself. Self-abased and contrite, he\r\nstarted one evening down the neck below Southwark, Philadelphia,\r\ndetermined to remain till his backslidings were healed. Under a tree\r\nhe wrestled in prayer into the watches of the night. Before the\r\nmorning God restored to him the joys of His salvation. Thenceforward\r\nhe continued faithful. He resumed his public labors. In the year 1810\r\nhe died in Philadelphia. \"Making a good end,\" he was borne to the\r\ngrave by a great procession of both Colored and white admirers, who\r\nburied him as a hero--one overcome, but finally victorious.\r\n\r\nIt is said that on one occasion, in Wilmington, Del., where Methodism\r\nwas long unpopular, a number of the citizens, who did not ordinarily\r\nattend Methodist preaching, came together to hear Bishop Asbury. Old\r\nAsbury Chapel was, at that time, so full that they could not get in.\r\nThey stood outside to hear the Bishop, as they supposed; but in\r\nreality they heard Harry. Before they left the place, they\r\ncomplimented the speaker by saying: \"If all Methodist preachers could\r\npreach like the Bishop we should like to be constant hearers.\" Some\r\none present replied: \"That was not the Bishop, but his servant.\" This\r\nonly raised the Bishop higher in their estimation, as their conclusion\r\nwas, if such be the servant what must the master be? The truth was,\r\nthat Harry was a more popular speaker than Asbury, or almost any one\r\nelse in his day.[130]\r\n\r\nSo we find in the very inception of Methodism in the United States the\r\nColored people were conspicuously represented in its membership,\r\ncontributing both money, labor, and eloquence to its grand success.\r\n\r\nThe great founder of Methodism was an inveterate foe of human slavery,\r\nwhich he pronounced \"the sum of all villainies,\" and in this\r\nparticular the Methodist societies in their earliest times reflected\r\nhis sentiments. The early preachers were especially hostile to\r\nslavery. In 1784 it was considered and declared to be contrary to the\r\nGolden Law of God, as well as every principle of the Revolution. They\r\nrequired every Methodist to execute and record, within twelve months\r\nafter notice by the preacher, a legal instrument emancipating all\r\nslaves in his possession at specified ages. Any person who should not\r\nconcur in this requirement had liberty to leave the Church within one\r\nyear; Otherwise the preacher was to exclude him. No person holding\r\nslaves could be admitted to membership, or to the Lord's Supper, until\r\nhe complied with this law. But it was to be applied only where the law\r\nof the State permitted.[131] These rules provoked great hostility, and\r\nwere suspended within six months.\r\n\r\nThe Church had, however, put the stamp of condemnation upon it. And\r\never in a more or less active but always consistent manner opposed it,\r\nuntil its final extirpation was accomplished, though not until the\r\nChurch had been several times divided in favor of and against it.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States of America was\r\norganized in what is historically known as the Christmas Conference,\r\nwhich convened in Baltimore at ten o'clock Friday morning, December\r\n24, 1784, Bishop Thomas Coke, presiding. Rev. Francis Asbury was there\r\nconsecrated a bishop. In 1786 a resolution emphatically enjoining it\r\nupon the preachers to leave nothing undone for the spiritual benefit\r\nand salvation of the Colored people was adopted. The Church is a\r\nlimited Episcopacy. The bishops are elected by the General Conference.\r\nThey fix the appointments of all the preachers, but the conference\r\narranges their duration. The bishops hold office during good behavior.\r\nThe General Conference is the Legislative, and the bishops, presiding\r\nelders, pastors, annual, district, and quarterly conferences, with the\r\nleaders' and stewards' meetings, and the general and local trustees,\r\nare the Executive Department. The ministerial orders are two: elder\r\nand deacon. The offices of the ministry and rank are in the order\r\nnamed,--bishop, sub-bishop, pastor, and sub-pastors. The ministry are\r\nclassified as Effective, Supernumerary, Superannuate, and Local. The\r\nproperty of each congregation is deeded in trust for them to a Board\r\nof Local Trustees, who may sell, buy, or improve it for the use of\r\nsaid congregation. The stewards are officers whose labors are partly\r\ntemporal and partly spiritual. They are entrusted with the raising of\r\nsupplies, benevolence, and the support of the ministry. Exhorters are\r\nprayer-meeting leaders and general helpers in the work of the\r\ncircuits.\r\n\r\nMethodism began in a college and has been a great patron of education.\r\nIt has been largely devoted to the educational and religious culture\r\nof the Colored people in the South and in Africa. There are sixteen\r\nconferences of Colored members in the M. E. Church--fifteen in the\r\nUnited States and one in Liberia. For the Liberian Conference two\r\nColored bishops have been consecrated, viz.: Francis Burns and\r\nex-President Thomas Wright Roberts, both deceased. The present bishops\r\nare all white, one of whom annually visits Africa. The same is true of\r\nconferences in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, India,\r\nChina, and Japan. The agency by which the Church prosecutes this work\r\nis the Missionary, Church Extension, Freedmen's Aid, Education, and\r\nSunday-school Union societies. Books and periodicals are amply\r\nsupplied by its own publishing house, which is the largest religious\r\npublishing house in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteen conferences there are 225,000 members, 200,000\r\nSunday-school scholars, 3,500 day scholars, one medical, three law,\r\nand seven theological colleges, and twelve seminaries. There is\r\n$500,000 in school and $2,000,000 in church and parsonage property\r\nowned by the Colored membership! The Colored members elect their own\r\nrepresentatives to the General Conference, and are fully represented\r\nin all the work of the Church.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Rev. Marshall W. Taylor, D. D., and the Rev.\r\nWm. M. Butler are the most prominent men in the Church. Marshall\r\nWilliam Boyd (alias) Taylor was born July 1, 1846, at Lexington,\r\nFayette County, Kentucky, of poor, uneducated, but respectable\r\nparents. He was the fourth in a family of five children, three of whom\r\nwere boys, viz.: George Summers, Francis Asbury, and himself; and two\r\ngirls, Mary Ellen and Mary Cathrine. He is of Scotch-Irish and Indian\r\ndescent on his father's side. Hon. Samuel Boyd, of New York; Joseph\r\nBoyd, of Virginia; and Lieut.-Gov. Boyd, of Kentucky, were\r\nblood-relations of his, and all descended from the \"Clan Boyd\" of\r\nScotland. His mother was of African and Arabian stock. His\r\ngrandmother, on his mother's side, Phillis Ann, was brought from\r\nMadagascar when a little girl, and became the slave of Mr. Alexander\r\nBlack, a Kentucky farmer, who at his death willed his slaves free. His\r\nmother, Nancy Ann, thus obtained her freedom, and by the terms of the\r\nwill she was put to the millinery trade, which she fully mastered, and\r\nmeantime obtained an elementary knowledge of reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic. She married Albert Summers, and bore to him two children,\r\nviz., George Summers and Mary Catharine. He ran away to prevent being\r\nsold, and she afterward married Samuel Boyd, to whom she bore three\r\nchildren, viz., Francis Asbury, Marshall William, and Mary Ellen. His\r\nfather, Samuel, was the son of Hon. Samuel Boyd, of New York. He was\r\nnoted for his independence of character; was a valuable but unruly\r\nslave. He was allowed an opportunity to purchase his freedom, and this\r\nhe began to do, and had paid $250, three fourths of the price, when\r\nhis master sold him to Tennessee. He promptly ran away from his new\r\nmaster, but unwilling to forsake his family, went back to Kentucky.\r\nHis master pursued and overtook him at Lexington, where he had\r\nstopped. He refused to go back to Tennessee, and once more was\r\npermitted to select a master, and finally to again contract for his\r\nfreedom, which he this time succeeded in obtaining. In consequence of\r\nhis mother's emancipation, Marshall was free when he first saw the\r\nlight of day. By occupation his father was a hemp-breaker, rope-maker,\r\nand farmer. The last he elected to follow after he was free. He\r\nemployed his boys as farmers, but his mother strenuously opposed it,\r\nwishing better opportunities than could be thus afforded for their\r\neducation. She at length succeeded in carrying her point.\r\n\r\nIn religion his father at first inclined to the Baptists, of which\r\nChurch he became a deacon in the congregation of Rev. Mr. Ferrill, of\r\nPleasant Green Church, Lexington. Later he became dissatisfied with\r\nthe Baptists, and united with the African Methodists at Frankfort, Ky.\r\nHe finally went back to the Baptist Church and died in that faith.\r\n\r\nMarshall's mother, and all her people, so far as known, were\r\nMethodists. His early training and first and only religious\r\nimpressions were Methodistic, which Church, after his conversion, he\r\njoined. His father had no knowledge of letters, so that all his home\r\ninstruction came from his mother. Her text-books were the Bible,\r\nMethodist Catechism, and Webster's Elementary Spelling Book. And in\r\nthese young Marshall became very proficient. He afterward attended\r\nschool daily to Rev. John Tibbs, an African Methodist preacher, who\r\ncame from Cincinnati to Lexington to teach free children and such of\r\nthe slaves as would be permitted to attend. Some masters granted this\r\npermission, but the greater number refused it. Finally, some \"_poor\r\nwhite_\" fellows, unable to own slaves themselves, mobbed the teacher,\r\nrode him on a rail, tarred, feathered, and drove him from town. They\r\nwere called black Indians. It was impossible to secure another teacher\r\nin Lexington for a day school, but Mr. George Perry, an intelligent\r\nfree Colored man, had the courage to teach Sunday-school, in the\r\nBranch Methodist Church. It is now called Asbury M. E. Church.\r\nMarshall attended, as did his mother and brothers. In 1854 the family\r\nmoved to Louisville, looking for a school. Finding none there, they\r\ncontinued their journey about fifty miles above there on the Ohio\r\nRiver, and landed at Ghent, a little village in Carroll County, Ky.,\r\nopposite Vevey, Indiana. They indulged a hope that the children would\r\nbe allowed to attend the public schools at Vevey, but they were doomed\r\nin this expectation. They spent two years at Ghent. Marshall and his\r\nbrother obtained instruction during this period from the little white\r\nchildren who attended school, after hours, using \"an old hay loft back\r\nof a Mr. Sanders's Tavern\" for a recitation-room, and paying their\r\nteachers with cakes and candies bought with odd pennies gathered here\r\nand there.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, 1856, there was an Emancipation celebration at\r\nDayton, Ohio. Frederick Douglass was advertised to speak, and other\r\neminent Abolitionists were expected to participate. Marshall's mother\r\nattended it. Soon after her return several slaves mysteriously\r\ndisappeared from the vicinity of Ghent. Among them was a very valuable\r\nfamily belonging to Esquire Craig, of the village. Suspicion fastened\r\non the old lady who had been off among the \"Abolitionists.\" She was\r\nindicted by the Grand Jury, and thirty-six men filed into her cabin,\r\nand while she lay sick in bed, read the indictment to her. They\r\nordered her to leave the place. She refused to go, claimed her\r\ninnocence, but to no purpose. \"They chased Francis with guns and dogs\r\non the public streets in daylight; shaddowed the cabin and gave\r\nunmistakable evidence of a diabolical purpose.\" She soon after\r\nreturned to Louisville.\r\n\r\nYoung Marshall became a messenger in the law firm of J. B. Kincaid and\r\nJohn W. Barr. Here his chances were good, both of these gentlemen\r\naiding him in his studies. He did his work after school hours at the\r\noffice, and attended a school which was kept in the \"Centre Street\r\nColored Methodist Church,\" until it closed.\r\n\r\nRev. Henry Henderson, a Colored Methodist preacher, now opened a\r\nschool in Centre Street, and Marshall was duly enrolled among his\r\npupils. On his retirement, Mrs. Elizabeth Cumings, a highly cultured\r\nand pious lady, taught a private school on Grayson, between Sixth and\r\nSeventh streets. He now went to her. She died soon after, when he was\r\nsent to a Mr. William H. Gibson, who had already opened a school on\r\nSeventh, between Jefferson and Green streets, in an old carpenter\r\nshop. Here he continued until 1861.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Mr. Taylor opened a Freedmen's School at Hardinsburg\r\nBreckenridge Co., Ky. This was in an old church, the property of the\r\nM. E. Church South. It had been donated for church purposes by George\r\nBlanford. If used otherwise it was to revert to the donor. A Negro\r\nschool was obnoxious to the community. His was the first there had\r\never been in the village, and notwithstanding the white people had\r\nlong since abandoned the property to the Colored people this question\r\nwas now raised in order to break up the school. It did not succeed, as\r\nthey easily proved that the original intent of the donor was not\r\nviolated, since Colored people still used the property as a church.\r\nFailing in this the school was tormented by ruffians. Pepper was\r\nrolled up in cotton, set on fire, and hurled into the room to set\r\nevery one coughing. Finally threats of personal violence were made if\r\nhe did not leave, but Mr. Taylor armed himself, defied the enemies of\r\nfreedom, and stayed. At last, on Christmas evening, Dec. 25, 1867, the\r\nhouse was blown up with powder. The arrangement was to set off the\r\nblast with a slow match so as to catch the house full of people, there\r\nbeing a school exhibition that night. The explosion took place at\r\n11:30 P.M., but owing to the excitement occasioned by the novelty of\r\nsuch a thing as a \"Negro School Exhibition,\" the crowd had gathered\r\nmuch earlier than announced. The programme was completed before 11\r\nP.M., and by this accident the school and teacher were saved. The old\r\nwreck still remains a monument to color prejudice.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the Freedmen's Bureau another school-house was soon\r\nbuilt, and the school proceeded. This was followed by a meeting-house.\r\nThe white people, whose sentiments were now rapidly turning,\r\nsubscribed liberally toward it.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 an educational convention was held at Owensboro, in Davies\r\nCo., Ky., of which Mr. Taylor was elected president. He soon after\r\nwrote a manual for Colored schools, which was generally used in that\r\nsection. In 1869 he attended the first Colored political convention\r\never held in Kentucky, at Major Hall in Frankfort. He was one of the\r\nEducational Committee, and submitted a report. This year he was also a\r\nmember of a convention at Jackson Street Church, Louisville, which\r\ninaugurated the movement for the Lexington M. E. Conference. He was\r\nlicensed as a local preacher this year by Rev. Hanson Tolbert at\r\nHardinsburg, and was assisted in the study of theology by Rev. R. G.\r\nGardiner, J. H. Lennin, and Dr. R. S. Rust. He went to Arkansas as a\r\nmissionary teacher and preacher at the call of Rev. W. J. Gladwin, and\r\nremained there one year. He organized several societies, of the\r\nChurch, taught school at Midway, Forrest City, and Wittsburg; took\r\npart in the political campaign of that year; and was nominated, but\r\ndeclined to run, for Representative from Saint Frances County.\r\n\r\nHe preached in Texas, Indian Territory, and Missouri; was put in peril\r\nby the Ku Klux at Hot Springs; took the chills and returned to Ky., in\r\n1871. He was then appointed to the Litchfield Circuit, Southwestern\r\nKentucky. In 1872 he united with the Lexington Conference of M. E.\r\nChurch on trial. He was ordained a deacon by Bishop Levi Scott at\r\nMaysville, Ky., and sent to Coke Chapel, Louisville, Ky., and Wesley\r\nChapel, Jeffersonville, Indiana. He remained in this charge three\r\nyears, during which time he published the monthly \"Kentucky\r\nMethodist,\" and wrote extensively for the press. He was elected\r\nassistant secretary, editor of the printed minutes of the conference,\r\nand finally secretary. In 1875 he was sent as pastor to Indianapolis,\r\nInd. He was ordained elder by Bishop Wiley at Lexington in 1876, and\r\nreturned to Indianapolis. He took an active part in the political\r\ncampaign of 1876, and was sent to Union Chapel, Cincinnati, 1877-8. In\r\n1879 the faculty of Central Tennessee College, at Nashville,\r\nTennessee, conferred upon him the title and credentials of a Doctor of\r\nDivinity. He wrote the life of Rev. Geo. W. Downing.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Dr. Taylor was appointed Presiding Elder of the Ohio District,\r\nLexington Conference. In 1880 he was sent as fraternal delegate from\r\nthe M. E. to the A. M. E. General Conference at St. Louis; he having\r\nbeen previously elected lay delegate to the General Conference of the\r\nM. E. Church in Brooklyn, New York, in 1879. He was the youngest\r\nmember of that body. Upon his motion fraternal representatives were\r\nsent to the various Colored denominations of Methodists. He was\r\nappointed in 1881 as a delegate from the M. E. Church to the\r\nEcumenical Conference at London, England. He was the caucus nominee of\r\nthe Colored delegates to the General Conference in Cincinnati in 1880\r\nfor bishop. He was always opposed to caste discriminations in Church,\r\nState, or society. He has opposed Colored conferences and a Colored\r\nbishop as tending to perpetuate discriminations. He does not oppose\r\nthe election of Colored men, but wishes that every honor may fall upon\r\nthem because of merit and not on account of their color. He has become\r\nfamous as an eloquent preacher, safe teacher, ready speaker, and\r\nearnest worker; always aiming to do the greatest good to the greatest\r\nnumber. Certainly the Methodist Episcopal Church has reason to be\r\nproud of Marshall W. Taylor.\r\n\r\nIn this Church there are many other worthy and able Colored preachers.\r\nThe relations they sustain to the eloquent, scholarly, and pious white\r\nclergymen of the denomination are pleasant and beneficial. It is an\r\neducation. And the fact that the best pulpits of white men are opened\r\nto the Colored preachers is a prophecy that race antagonisms in the\r\nChristian Church, so tenacious and harmful, are to perish speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130] Stevens's Hist. of M. E. Church, pp. 174, 175; also Lednum, p.\r\n282.\r\n\r\n[131] And there was not a single State where this rule could be\r\napplied. Slavery ruled the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE COLORED BAPTISTS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     THE COLORED BAPTISTS AN INTELLIGENT AND USEFUL PEOPLE.--THEIR\r\n     LEADING MINISTERS IN MISSOURI, OHIO, AND IN NEW ENGLAND.--THE\r\n     BIRTH, EARLY LIFE, AND EDUCATION OF DUKE WILLIAM ANDERSON.--AS\r\n     FARMER, TEACHER, PREACHER, AND MISSIONARY.--HIS INFLUENCE IN THE\r\n     WEST.--GOES SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR.--TEACHES IN A\r\n     THEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE.--CALLED TO\r\n     WASHINGTON.--PASTOR OF 19TH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH.--HE OCCUPIES\r\n     VARIOUS POSITIONS OF TRUST.--BUILDS A NEW CHURCH.--HIS LAST\r\n     REVIVAL.--HIS SICKNESS AND DEATH.--HIS FUNERAL AND THE GENERAL\r\n     SORROW AT HIS LOSS.--LEONARD ANDREW GRIMES, OF BOSTON,\r\n     MASSACHUSETTS.--HIS PIETY, FAITHFULNESS AND PUBLIC INFLUENCE FOR\r\n     GOOD.--THE COMPLETION OF HIS CHURCH.--HIS LAST DAYS AND SUDDEN\r\n     DEATH.--GENERAL SORROW.--RESOLUTIONS BY THE BAPTIST MINISTERS OF\r\n     BOSTON.--A GREAT AND GOOD MAN GONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baptist Church has always been a purely democratic institution.\r\nWith no bishops or head-men, except such as derive their authority\r\nfrom the consent of the governed, this Church has been truly\r\nindependent and self-governing in its spirit. Its only Head is Christ,\r\nand its teachers such as are willing to take \"the Word of God as the\r\nMan of their Counsel.\" From the time of the introduction of the\r\nBaptist Church into North America down to the present time, the\r\nColored people have formed a considerable part of its membership. The\r\ngenerous, impartial, and genuine Christian spirit of Roger Williams\r\nhad a tendency, at the beginning, to keep out of the Church the spirit\r\nof race prejudice. But the growth of slavery carried with it, as a\r\nlogical result, the idea that the slave's presence in the Christian\r\nChurch was a rebuke to the system. For conscience' sake the slave was\r\nexcluded, and to oblige the feelings of those who transferred the\r\nspirit of social caste from gilded drawing-rooms to cushioned pews,\r\neven the free Negro was conducted to the organ-loft.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the Negro led him to the faith of the Baptist\r\nChurch; but being denied fellowship in the white congregations, he was\r\ncompelled to provide churches for himself. In Virginia, Georgia,\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi the Colored Baptists were\r\nnumerous. In the other States the Methodists and Catholics were\r\nnumerous. There were few ministers of note at the South; but New\r\nEngland, the Middle States, and the West produced some very able\r\nBaptist preachers. The Rev. Richard Anderson, of St. Louis, Missouri,\r\nwas a man of exalted piety, consummate ability, and of almost\r\nboundless influence in the West. He was the pastor of a large church,\r\nand did much to mould and direct the interests of his people\r\nthroughout Missouri. He was deeply revered by his own people, and\r\nhighly respected by the whites. When he died, the entire city of St.\r\nLouis was plunged into profound mourning, and over three hundred\r\ncarriages--many belonging to the wealthiest families in the\r\ncity--followed his body to the place of interment.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio the Rev. Charles Satchell, the Rev. David Nickens, the Rev. W.\r\nP. Newman, the Rev. James Poindexter, and the Rev. H. L. Simpson were\r\nthe leading clergymen in the Colored Baptist churches. Cincinnati has\r\nhad for the last half century excellent Baptist churches, and an\r\nintelligent and able ministry. There are several associations\r\nembracing many live churches.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky the Colored Baptists are very numerous, and own much\r\nvaluable property; but Virginia seems to have more Baptists among its\r\ngreat population of Colored people than any other State in the South.\r\nThere are a dozen or more in Richmond, including the one presided over\r\nby the famous John Jasper. One of them has, it is said, three thousand\r\nmembers(?). But the District of Columbia has more Colored churches for\r\nits area and population than any other place in the United States.\r\nThere are at least twenty-five Baptist churches in the District, and\r\nsome of them have interesting histories. The Nineteenth Street Baptist\r\nChurch is as an intelligent a society of Christian people of color as\r\nthere is to be found in any city in the country. Its pulpit has always\r\nbeen occupied by the ablest ministers in the country. The Revs.\r\nSampson White, Samuel W. Madden, and Duke W. Anderson were men of\r\neducation and marked ability. And there is little doubt but what Duke\r\nW. Anderson was the ablest, most distinguished clergyman of color in\r\nthe United States. And for his work's sake he deserves well of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nDuke William Anderson was born April 10, 1812, in the vicinity of\r\nLawrenceville, Lawrence County, in the State of Illinois, of a Negro\r\nmother by a white father. His father, lately from North Carolina,\r\nfell under Gen. Harrison fighting the Indians. Like so many other\r\ngreat men he was born in an obscure place--a wigwam. At the time of\r\nhis father's death he was quite a young baby. He was now left to the\r\ncare of a mother who, in many respects, was like her husband, bold and\r\ncourageous for the truth, and yet as gentle as a child. It is\r\npeculiarly trying and difficult for a mother who has all the comforts\r\nof modern city life, to train and educate her boys for the duties of\r\nlife; and if so, how much more trying and difficult must it have been\r\nfor a mother on the North-western frontiers, seventy years ago, to\r\ntrain her boys?\r\n\r\nDestitute of home and its comforts, without friends or money; no farm,\r\nschool, or church, Mrs. Anderson began to train her two boys, John\r\nAnderson and D. W. Anderson. Of the former, little or nothing is\r\nknown, save that he was the only brother of D. W. Anderson.\r\n\r\nTrue to the instincts of her motherly heart, Mrs. Anderson was\r\ndetermined to remain upon the spot purchased and consecrated by the\r\nblood of her lamented husband. She could not divorce herself from the\r\napproximate idea and object of her husband's life and death. He had\r\nturned from the comforts of a happy home; had chosen hardships rather\r\nthan ease that he might realize the dream of his youth, and the object\r\nof his manly endeavors--the right of suffrage to all. Her children\r\ncould not build their play-house of Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, or\r\nSouthey. All the instruction Duke William obtained came from his\r\nmother. She was very large and healthy. Her complexion was of perfect\r\nblack. She was possessed of excellent judgment, patience, and\r\nindustry. She stored the young mind of her boy with useful\r\nagricultural knowledge, of which she possessed a large amount.\r\n\r\nAn education does not consist in acquiring lessons, obtaining a\r\nsimple, abstract, objective knowledge of certain sciences. It is more\r\nthan this. It consists, also, in being able to apply and use rightly a\r\ngiven amount of knowledge. And though D. W. Anderson was never\r\npermitted to enter college, yet, what he got he got thoroughly, and\r\nused at the proper time to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nNature was his best teacher. While yet a very young boy he was awed by\r\nher splendors, and attracted by the complicated workings of her\r\nmanifold laws. He began to study the innumerable mysteries which met\r\nhim in every direction. He heard God in the rippling water, in the\r\nangry tempest, in the sighing wind, and in the troops of stars which\r\nGod marshals upon the plains of heaven. In the study of nature he\r\nexulted. He sat in her velvet lap, sported by her limpid waters,\r\nacquainted himself perfectly with her seasons, and knew the coming and\r\ngoing of every star.\r\n\r\nGod was training this man for the great mission which he afterward so\r\nfaithfully performed. No soul that was ever filled with such grand and\r\nhumane ideas as was that of Duke William Anderson can be crushed. He\r\nknew no boundaries for his soul,--except God on one side and the whole\r\nuniverse on the other. He was as free in thought and feeling as the\r\nair he inhaled, or the birds in the bright sky over his head. His soul\r\nhad for many years communed with the God of nature; had been taught by\r\nthe mighty workings of truth, feeling, and genius within, and by the\r\nworld without, that he was not to be confined to earth forever, but\r\nthat beyond the deep blue sky, into which he so much longed to peer,\r\nthere dwelt the Creator of all things, and there the home of the good!\r\nLike the \"wise men of the East,\"--knowing no other God but the God of\r\nnature,--his primitive ideas of religion were naturally based upon\r\nnature. In that wild and barren territory nature was impressive,\r\ndesolate, and awful. The earth, air, and sky incited him to thought\r\nand stimulated his imagination. Every appearance, every\r\nphenomenon--the storm, the thunder,--speak the prophecies of God. He\r\nwas filled with great thoughts and driven by grand ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to compute the value of the mother to the child. It is\r\nthe mother who loves, because she has suffered. And this seems to be\r\nthe great law of love. Not a triumph in art, literature, or\r\njurisprudence--from the story of Homer to the odes of Horace, from the\r\ntimes of Bacon and Leibnitz to the days of Tyndall and Morse--that has\r\nnot been obtained by toil and suffering! The mother of Anderson,\r\nhaving suffered so much in her loneliness and want, knew how to train\r\nher boy,--the joy of her life. And he in return knew how to appreciate\r\na mother's love. He remembered that to her he owed every thing,--his\r\nlife, his health, and his early training. He remembered that in\r\nchildhood she had often, around their little camp-fire, enchanted his\r\nyouthful mind by the romance of the sufferings and trials of herself\r\nand husband. And now finding himself a young man he was determined to\r\nchange the course of their life.\r\n\r\nNo work so thoroughly develops the body and mind, and is so conducive\r\nto health, as farming; and, perhaps, none so independent. Anderson was\r\nnaturally healthy and strong, so that farming agreed with him. By this\r\nhe made a comfortable living, and soon demonstrated to his aged mother\r\nthat she had not labored in vain, nor spent her strength for naught.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years he farmed. His motto was \"excelsior\" in whatever\r\nhe engaged, and in farming he realized success.\r\n\r\nAs the father of Duke William Anderson had fallen under the U. S.\r\nflag, it became the duty of the Government to care for his widow and\r\norphans. Accordingly, Duke William was sent to an Illinois school\r\nwhere he received the rudiments of a Western education. A Western\r\neducation did not consist in reading poetry, or in examining Hebrew\r\nroots, but in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography, and\r\nhistory. There were no soft seats, no beautifully frescoed walls,\r\ndotted with costly maps, or studded with beautiful pictures; not a\r\nschool with a dozen beautiful rooms, heated by hot air. In those days\r\na Western school-house was erected by the side of some public highway,\r\nremote from the town. It was constructed of logs,--not of the logs\r\nthat have lost their roughness by going through the saw-mill, but logs\r\ncut by the axe of the hardy frontiersman. The axe was the only tool\r\nneeded to fit the timber for the building. The building was about\r\ntwelve feet in height, and about sixteen by twenty. The cracks were\r\noften left open, and sometimes closed by chips and mud. The floor was\r\nmade of split logs with the flat side up. At one end of the building\r\nwas a fireplace and chimney occupying the whole end of the house. At\r\neach end of the fireplace were laid two large stones upon which to\r\nrest the ends of the logs of wood, under all of which were laid\r\nclosely large pieces of flat stones covered with an inch or two of\r\nmud. At the other end of the building was a door. It was constructed\r\nof thinly split pieces of logs held together by pieces of hickory\r\nwithes which crossed each end of the door. This door was hung upon\r\nwooden hinges, one part of which, instead of being fastened to the\r\ndoor by screws, was fastened by little wooden pegs. The step at the\r\ndoor was a short piece of log flattened a little on the top and braced\r\non the under side by small stones and pieces of chips. The roof was\r\nmade of long pieces of split timber, the flat side out and the edges\r\nsmoothed by the axe in order to make them lie snugly.\r\n\r\nSuch was the school-house in which D. W. Anderson was educated. And it\r\nmay be that the plain school in which he was educated loaned him that\r\nmodesty, plainness, and unostentatious air, which were among the many\r\nremarkable traits in his character. The circumstances and society by\r\nwhich boys are surrounded help to mould their character and determine\r\ntheir future. To a healthy and vigorous body was coupled a clear and\r\nactive mind. He loved knowledge, and was willing to buy it at any\r\nprice--willing to make any sacrifice. He was an industrious student,\r\nand possessed great power of penetration and acquisition. And every\r\nthing he read he remembered. The greatest difficulty with students is\r\nthat they fail to apply themselves. A man may have the ability to\r\naccomplish a given amount of work and yet that work can never be\r\naccomplished except by the severest effort. It is one thing to possess\r\na negative power, but it is quite another thing to possess a positive\r\npower. In this world we are set over against all external laws and\r\nforces. We are to assume the offensive. We are to climb up to the\r\nstars by microscopes. We are to measure this earth by our mathematics.\r\nWe are to penetrate its depths and lift to the sun its costly\r\ntreasures. We are to acquaint ourselves with the workings of the\r\nmanifold laws which lie about us. If we would know ourselves,\r\nunderstand our relation to God, we must see after the requisite\r\nknowledge. Suppose that Duke William Anderson had despaired of ever\r\nreceiving an education; sat down by the way in life and said: \"There\r\nis no use of troubling myself, I cannot get what I desire. I am\r\ndestined to be ignorant and weak all the days of my life; and if there\r\nis any good thing for me it will come to me. I will sit here and\r\nwait.\" Would the world ever have known of Anderson? His life would\r\nhave shed no perfume; his name would have been unknown and his grave\r\nwould have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut it was that courage which never knows defeat, it was that devotion\r\nthat never wavers, it was that assiduity, and it was that patience\r\nthat is certain to triumph, which bore him on to a glorious end, as a\r\nsummer wind bears up a silver cloud. At the age of seventeen he began\r\nto teach school. What Colored man would have essayed to teach school\r\non the frontiers fifty years ago? But D. W. Anderson was born to rule.\r\nHe was of commanding presence, full of confidence and earnestness. He\r\nentered upon his new duties full of hope and joy. This was something\r\nnew. There was a great deal of difference between handling the hoe\r\nand the pen. He found that there was a great difference between the\r\nfarm and the school-house. But he was one of those boys who do every\r\nthing with all their might, and he was at once at home, and soon\r\nbecame master of his new situation.\r\n\r\nThree laborious years were occupied in teaching. And they were years\r\nof profit to teacher as well as to pupil. He labored hard to be\r\nthorough; and he greatly improved and finished his own education\r\nduring his teaching.\r\n\r\nAbout this time young Anderson met, courted, and married Miss Ruth Ann\r\nLucas.\r\n\r\nAnderson soon made all necessary arrangements, and the nuptial\r\nceremony was solemnized by the village parson on the 30th of\r\nSeptember, 1830. With his bride he now settled down at home. For some\r\nyears he lived the life of a farmer. His mother was riveted to the\r\nspot where her devoted husband fell at the hands of a besotted Indian.\r\nBut her son was of a progressive spirit. He longed to leave the old\r\nhome for one more comfortable. How strange that the old should sit by\r\nthe grave of the past, while the young never weary of chasing some\r\nvague fancy!\r\n\r\nHe bought a tract of land, cleared it, and opened up a farm. He\r\nplanted a large orchard; became the owner of seven horses and all the\r\nimplements necessary to farming.\r\n\r\nBy his own industry and perseverance he had now acquired a neat little\r\nhome; on his farm he raised enough produce for the consumption of his\r\nfamily, and still there was a large quantity left for the market.\r\nApples, potatoes, wheat, corn, and other commodities brought him\r\nhandsome returns.\r\n\r\nOn this farm were born five children, four of whom lived to adult age.\r\nThe oldest child, Luther Morgan, was born October 10, 1831. The second\r\nchild, Mary Catharine, was born in 1833. The third, George Washington,\r\nwas born in 1835. The fourth, Elizabeth, was born in 1837. And the\r\nfifth and last child was born on the night of September 4, 1839, when,\r\nalso, the mother and child died.\r\n\r\nThis sad event filled a hitherto happy home with gloom, and bowed a\r\nstrong heart with grief. Anderson was a man possessed of a very tender\r\nnature, though he was manly and resolute. His heart was fixed upon his\r\nwife, and this sad providence smote him heavily.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years, from his youth up, he had been very profane.\r\nHe knew no Sabbath, worshipped no God, and was himself the highest\r\nlaw. He was filled with a grand religious sentiment, and only needed\r\nthe grace of God to bring it out, and the love of God to show him\r\nwhere he stood.\r\n\r\nThe object of his youthful affection was gone. The faithful woman who\r\nhad walked for nineteen years by his side was no more; her eyes were\r\nclosed to mortal things, and she had ceased to be. He followed her\r\nbody to the grave, and there dropped a silent tear for her to whom he\r\nhad given his heart. It was the first funeral of anyone related to\r\nhim, and its lessons were sharply cut into his heart.\r\n\r\nHe returned to a desolate home, where the sad faces of motherless\r\nchildren told that one whom they loved, and who had made home happy,\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHis mind now turned to religious matters. He began to think of the\r\nhome beyond, of Jesus, who died for sinners, and wondered if he would\r\never be able to see the loved one beyond the tide of death. As he\r\ndreamed of immortality, longed for heaven, and wondered if Jesus were\r\nhis Saviour, he was filled with a deep sense of sin. He felt more\r\ndeeply a sense of sin. He felt more and more that he was unworthy of\r\nthe Saviour's love; and if he had his just dues, he would be \"assigned\r\na portion among the lost.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time he was bowed down under the weight of his sins, and at\r\nlength he found peace through the blood of Christ. He was renewed. The\r\navaricious man became liberal, the implacable enemy became the\r\nforgiving friend, and the man of cursing a man of prayer. But it was\r\nimpossible for him to cease to grieve; so he thought he would sell the\r\nfarm and seek another home. The farm was sold, the horses and tools,\r\nand every thing converted into money. The children were bound out, and\r\nall arrangements were perfected to seek another home.\r\n\r\nHe paid a visit to Alton, Illinois, where he spent two or three years.\r\nIn those days Alton was the city _par excellence_ of Illinois, and\r\ntoward it flowed the tide of emigration. So favorably was he impressed\r\nwith Alton, that he was determined to make it his home. Accordingly,\r\nhe began to make preparations for moving the children. In the\r\nmeanwhile he formed the acquaintance of a widow lady in Alton with\r\nwhom he became very much pleased. She was a tall, handsome-looking\r\nyellow woman, of cultivated manners, and of pleasing address.\r\nAnderson's wife had been dead three or four years.\r\n\r\nIt was now August 17, 1842, and the hand and heart of Anderson were\r\noffered Mrs. Mary Jane Ragens and accepted. With his new companion he\r\nnow returned to the scenes of his early days and to the four children\r\nwho joyfully awaited his return. He had made up his mind to settle in\r\nAlton. He and his new companion began to prepare for the journey. The\r\nfamily now consisted of the four children of Anderson and two children\r\nof his wife, making a family of six besides the two heads.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that intervened between the death of his first wife\r\nand his engagement to the second, he taught school in Vincennes,\r\nIndiana, Alton and Brookton, Illinois. The old home stood upon the\r\nWabash River, and was quite upon the line that divided the two\r\nStates,--Indiana and Illinois. His own children went to his school,\r\nand were carried across the river on his back. On the other bank stood\r\nthe log school-house of which he was principal.\r\n\r\nIn those, days it was a matter of some comment to see a Colored man\r\nwho dared write his name or tell his age, but to see one who was\r\nactually a schoolmaster was the marvel of the times. His teaching was\r\na matter of comment in Vincennes, but Vincennes was only a little\r\ncountry town. But to go to Alton,--that city of great fame, then,--and\r\nteach school, was an undertaking that required strong nerves. D. W.\r\nAnderson had them. He never allowed himself to think that he was any\r\nperson other than a man and citizen clothed with all civil rights and\r\narmed with God-given prerogatives. And so commanding was he, that a\r\nman who stood in his presence instantly felt him a superior. Moreover,\r\nthe heated feeling and public sentiment which, on the night of\r\nNovember 7, 1837, wrested from the hand of God,--to whom alone\r\nvengeance belongeth,--a life, were not yet abated. Lovejoy, a\r\npeaceable citizen, had been deprived of free speech and struck down by\r\nthe knife of the assassin; and could it be expected that a Negro would\r\nbe spared? The times were exciting and dangerous, and yet Anderson was\r\ndetermined to take his place and work on in the path of duty, never\r\nwincing, but leaving the results with God.\r\n\r\nBefore in his quiet home and farm life, nature was his peculiar study.\r\nHe had studied man in studying himself, but in the city of Alton he\r\ncould study men. He loved to walk through its long streets, watch its\r\nhurrying pedestrians, and learn the manifold manifestations of city\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHaving been converted just after the death of his first wife, but\r\nnever having connected himself with any church, he now joined the A.\r\nM. E. Church of Alton. His views from the first were Baptistic, but\r\ncircumstances placed him among the Methodists. The elder in charge was\r\nthe powerful preacher, the successful revivalist, and the eminently\r\npious man, Rev. Shadrack Stewart. Some misunderstanding arose between\r\nthe minister in charge and some of the members, which resulted in the\r\nwithdrawal of the pastor, Rev. S. Stewart, Anderson and family, and\r\nquite a number of the leading members. Minister and all connected\r\nthemselves with the Baptists. Anderson used often to say to his\r\nfamily: \"_That move placed me at home_.\" He was indeed at home, and\r\nstayed there until he was called to his heavenly rest! He loved very\r\nmuch to study the Bible, and to meditate upon its great truths. The\r\nmore he studied it the clearer duty seemed and the deeper and purer\r\nhis love grew for that beneficent Being whom he owned as Lord and\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nIt was now 1843. He felt that it was his duty to enter the Gospel\r\nministry. Naturally a modest man, he shrank somewhat from this voice\r\nof God; but finally, in 1844, submitted to ordination. He was ordained\r\nby the Rev. John Anderson, father of the late Richard Anderson, of St.\r\nLouis, or by the Rev. John Livingston, of Illinois, though it is a\r\nmatter of some doubt as to who was present at his ordination.\r\n\r\nHe now moved to Upper Alton, and pitched his tent under the shadow of\r\nShurtleff College. His aim was always to excel. He had absorbed every\r\nthing that had come within his reach, and now he had placed himself\r\nwhere he could rub against \"_College men_.\"\r\n\r\nSome men have to study a great deal to get a very little; they lack\r\nthe power of mental absorption, and, consequently, have to wade far\r\nout into the river of knowledge in order to feel the benefits of the\r\ninvigorating waters. Not so with Anderson; he was an indefatigable\r\nstudent. He was always willing to be taught by any person who was able\r\nto impart knowledge. Every new word that saluted his ear was forced\r\ninto his service; never mechanically, but always in its proper place.\r\nIf he learned a word to-day, to-morrow he would use it in its\r\ngrammatical relation to a sentence. He had no time for vacation; no\r\nmental cessation, but it was one unceasing struggle for knowledge. And\r\nno doubt his approximate relation to Shurtleff College helped to\r\nimpart a certain healthy tone and solidity to his style as a writer\r\nand preacher which were ever strikingly manifest.\r\n\r\nIn a short time he moved out from Alton about twelve miles to the town\r\nof Woodburn, Madison County, where he remained for a year, during\r\nwhich time he taught school and preached occasionally. In 1845 he\r\nbought an eighty-acre farm on Wood River, about five miles from Alton.\r\nHe moved his family on the farm, and began to make improvements. After\r\nthe farm had been put in good working condition, it was not hard for\r\nLuther, the eldest child, to manage it. It might seem strange to the\r\nboys of to-day, who are dwarfed by cities and cramped by a false\r\ncivilization, to know that Luther, a boy of fourteen, could follow the\r\nplow and swing the cradle. But, nevertheless, his father could trust\r\nmost of the work of the farm to these young hands.\r\n\r\nDuke William Anderson was a civilizer and a reformer. Wherever he\r\nplaced his foot there were thrift and improvement. He never was\r\nsatisfied with himself, or that which he did. He always felt when he\r\nhad done a thing that he could have done it _better_. He never\r\npreached a sermon but what he felt that he ought to preach the next\r\none _better_. In his great brain were the insatiable powers of\r\ncivilization. He was prompt, rapid, decisive, and sagacious, working\r\nup to his ideal standard. It was not his object to simply improve and\r\nhelp himself; he was far from such selfishness. The basis of his\r\nreformatory and benevolent operations was as broad as humanity and as\r\nsolid as granite. He never entered a community without the deep\r\nfeeling that it should be made better, and never lived in one except\r\nhis warm heart and willing hand went forth to minister to and\r\nsympathize with all who were in need.\r\n\r\nHe felt keenly the bitter prejudice which pervaded the community from\r\nwhich he had just moved, and was sensible of the weakness of the few\r\nfree Colored citizens who lived in that portion of the State. Wood\r\nRiver was a healthy place to live; and the land was cheap and rich. He\r\nwas not shut up to any selfish motives, but was planning for the good\r\nof his people. He knew that \"in union there is strength,\" and if he\r\ncould get a number of families to move on Wood River he could form a\r\nsettlement, and thus bring the people together in religion and\r\npolitics, in feeling and sentiment.\r\n\r\nThis plan was no idle dream. In due time he gave notice, and offered\r\ninducements, to the people to come. And they came from every section;\r\nand in a few years it had grown to be a large and prosperous\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nDuke William Anderson was the central figure in this community. His\r\ncolossal form, his clear mind, and excellent judgment, placed him at\r\nthe head of educational and religious matters. He was parson,\r\nschoolmaster, and justice. All questions of theology were submitted to\r\nhis judgment, from which there was no appeal. All social and political\r\nfeuds were placed before him, and his advice would heal the severest\r\nschisms and restore the most perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nHe now threw his great soul into the work of organization. He was\r\nfilled with a grand idea. He felt that the purity and intelligence of\r\nthe community depended upon their knowledge of the Bible and the\r\npreaching of the Gospel. It was a grand idea, though he had to work\r\nupon a small scale. It was this idea that made the Israelites\r\nvictorious; and Anderson was determined to impress upon this community\r\nthis primal truth. He knew that in knowledge only is there safety, and\r\nin science alone can certainty be found. Before this idea every thing\r\nmust bow, and around it were to cluster, not only the hopes of that\r\nlittle community, but the prayers of four million bondmen. He was\r\nconfident that in God he would triumph, and in Him was his trust.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun in the family circle. One evening it would be at\r\nbrother Anderson's house, and the next evening at another brother's\r\nhouse, and so on until the meetings had gone around the whole\r\ncommunity. A deep work of grace was in progress. The whole community\r\nfelt the pervading influence of the Spirit, and large results\r\nfollowed. Anderson was wrought upon powerfully. He felt to\r\nreconsecrate himself to the Master, and live a more faithful life.\r\nThis feeling manifested itself in the lives of those who were\r\nprofessors of religion, and the ungodly were anxious about their\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nFrom a very few believers the company of the redeemed had largely\r\nincreased. One house would not accommodate them, and it became\r\nnecessary for them to hold their meetings outdoors. It became very\r\nevident that this company of believers ought to be organized into a\r\nchurch, and a pastor placed over them. Duke William Anderson was the\r\nman to do this work, and, seeing the necessity of it, he immediately\r\norganized a Baptist church.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who never desired to escape difficult duties--rather, he\r\nalways was on hand when hard burdens were to be borne. He approached\r\nduty as something that, though at the time hard, brought peace in the\r\nend. He loved the approbation of conscience, and never sought to turn\r\naway from her teachings.\r\n\r\nIt is a task seldom, if ever, coveted by the ministers of to-day, to\r\nattempt the building of a church edifice, though wealth, art, and all\r\nmodern facilities await their beck.\r\n\r\nAnd one can easily imagine what a formidable task it must have been to\r\nattempt the building of a church thirty years ago. He organized a\r\nchurch out of those who had accepted the Gospel. And the next work was\r\nthe building of a house of worship. He put his great hand to this\r\nwork, and in a short time the house was completed and his people\r\nworshipping under their own vine and fig-tree.\r\n\r\nThe house was unique, spacious, and comfortable, all in keeping with\r\nthe plain people and their unpretentious pastor.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal in discipline, and Anderson knew it. Before the\r\norganization of his church the people had been placed under no\r\ndiscipline or charged with any special work. But now their leader\r\nbegan the work of church discipline and practical preaching. The\r\nfeeling that every person was his own man, independent and free, under\r\nthe preaching of Anderson, gave way to the feeling that they were\r\nmembers of one body, and Christ the head of that body. The unity of\r\nthe church was preached with great earnestness, and followed by large\r\nresults. It soon became evident that Duke William Anderson was no\r\nordinary man, and his fame began to spread. He had sought no\r\npublicity, but in secret had toiled on in the path of duty.\r\n\r\nDuring his labors in building a meeting-house and organizing a church\r\nhe had relinquished his hold upon the school; but now as the church\r\nwas erected and he had more time, he was against his will urged into\r\nthe school-room again. In the school-room he was as faithful as he was\r\nin the pulpit. He sought, with marvellous earnestness, to do with all\r\nhis might that which was committed to his hands; and all his labors\r\nwere performed as if they were being performed for himself.\r\n\r\nHe was at this time pastor of a church, teacher of a school, and owner\r\nof an eighty acre farm. If he were going to slight any work, it would\r\nnot be that of another, but his own. He watched the growth of his\r\nlittle church with an apostolical eye, and nipped every false doctrine\r\nin the bud. His excellent knowledge of human nature facilitated his\r\nwork in the church. He knew every man, woman, and child. He made\r\nhimself familiar with their circumstances and wants, and always placed\r\nhimself in complete sympathy with any and all of their circumstances.\r\nHe consequently won the confidence, love, and esteem of his people. In\r\nhis school he was watchful and patient. He studied character, and\r\nclassified his pupils; and was thereby enabled to deal with each pupil\r\nas he knew their temperament demanded. Some children are tender,\r\naffectionate, and obedient; while others are coarse, ugly, and\r\ninsubordinate. Some need only to have the wrong pointed out, while\r\nothers need the rod to convince them of bad conduct. And happy is that\r\nteacher who does not attempt to open every child's heart with the same\r\nkey, or punish each with the same rod.\r\n\r\nIf there is one quality more than another that the minister needs, it\r\nis downright earnestness--perfect sympathy with those to whom he\r\npreaches. What does it amount to if a man preach unless he feels what\r\nhe preaches? Certainly no one can be moved or edified. But Anderson\r\nwas not a cold, lifeless man. He loved to preach, though he felt a\r\ndeep sense of unfitness. And it can be truly said of his little\r\nchurch, as was said of the early church: \"And believers were the more\r\nadded to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.\"\r\n\r\nIt was seen by the prophetic eye of Anderson that an association would\r\nbe the means of bringing the people together. Accordingly he went to\r\nwork to organize an association that would take into its arms all the\r\nfeeble communities or churches that had no pastor. In due time all\r\narrangements were perfected, and a call issued for the neighboring\r\nchurches to send their pastor and two delegates to sit in council with\r\nthe Salem Baptist Church on Wood River, to consider the propriety of\r\ncalling into existence such an organization. After the usual\r\npreliminary services, Rev. D. W. Anderson stated the object of the\r\nmeeting, and urged the immediate action of the council in the matter.\r\nAfter the usual amount of debate incident to such an occasion, the\r\nproper steps were taken for the organization of an association to be\r\ncalled the \"_Wood River Baptist Association_,\" with Rev. Duke W.\r\nAnderson as its first Moderator, to meet on Wood River annually. What\r\na triumph! that day was the proudest of his life! He had spoken to\r\nthe poor disheartened Baptists for fifty miles around, who were cold\r\nand indifferent to the Master's cause: \"Awake! and stand upon your\r\nfeet! Come with me to help the Lord against the mighty! Let us\r\norganize for the conflict. There is much to do; so, let us be about\r\nour Master's work.\" The call sent forth breathed new life into the\r\npeople, and was the signal for united effort in the cause of the Lord.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough that an association was formed, it was not enough\r\nthat a few churches were represented in that association; but it must\r\ndo definite work. It must organize where organization was needed; it\r\nmust send out missionaries into the destitute places, and give the\r\nGospel to the poor. Thus Anderson reasoned; and the association heard\r\nhim. Gradually the Wood River Association grew and extended its\r\nworkings throughout the entire State of Illinois.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the associational gatherings were growing so large\r\nthat it was impossible to accommodate them. He advised the people to\r\nbuild quarters sufficient to accommodate all. Accordingly two or three\r\nrows of small houses were erected for the people to live in each year\r\nduring the time the association was in session. People now came yearly\r\nfrom every part of the State. The great distances did not detain them.\r\nLike the Jews who returned to Jerusalem every year to attend the\r\nfeast, they were glad when the time came to rest from their accustomed\r\nduties and journey toward Wood River. It was a delightful gathering.\r\nBrother ministers met and compared notes; while young men and maidens\r\ngently ministered at the tables, and led the prayer-meetings.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed those meetings. There were no conventionalities or forms\r\nto check the spirit of Christian love. There was perfect liberty.\r\nThere were no strangers; for they were the children of one common\r\nfather. They were as one family, and had all things in common. The\r\nutmost order and harmony characterized their gatherings. Not a cross\r\nword escaped a single lip. Not a rude act, on the part of the boys,\r\ncould be seen. Boys, in those days, had the profoundest respect for\r\ntheir seniors, and held a minister of the Gospel in all the simplicity\r\nof a boy's esteem.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of the first day of their meeting the association was\r\ncalled to order by the \"_Moderator_,\" and opened with prayer and a\r\nhymn. Then, after the usual business, a sermon was preached. In the\r\nafternoon a doctrinal sermon was preached and discussed; and in the\r\nevening a missionary sermon was delivered.\r\n\r\nLike the Apostle Paul he could say to the ministers of his day, that\r\nhe had labored more abundantly than they all. He worked with his hands\r\nand preached the Gospel, esteeming it an honor. The church over which\r\nhe presided had grown to one hundred and fifty active members, besides\r\na large and attentive congregation. This church had been gathered\r\nthrough his incomparable assiduity. He had come into their midst with\r\na heart glowing with the love of God. He had shown himself an\r\nexcellent farmer, faithful teacher, and consistent Christian. He had\r\nled one hundred and fifty souls to Christ. That was not all. In the\r\npulpit he had taught them the fundamental principles of Christianity,\r\nand demonstrated those principles in his daily life. His royal manhood\r\ntowered high over the community, until he became to the whole people a\r\nperfect measure of every thing that is lovely and of good report.\r\n\r\nHe had every thing just as he could wish. He was proprietor of an\r\neighty-acre farm, pastor of a flourishing church, schoolmaster of the\r\ncommunity, enthroned in the affections of the people for whose\r\nwell-being he had worked for seven years,--he might have remained the\r\nunrivalled and undisputed king of Woodburn community. But\r\nconsiderations rising high above his mere personal interests, led him\r\nto make a great sacrifice in selling his farm, severing his relation\r\nas pastor and teacher with a people whom he loved dearly, and who\r\nregarded him with a sort of superstitious reverence. The object of the\r\nchange was that he might move to Quincy, Ill., where he might give his\r\nchildren a thorough education. He secured a scholarship in Knox\r\nCollege for his eldest son, Luther Morgan Anderson, and permission for\r\nhim to attend. He put his son George W., and daughter, Elizabeth\r\nAnderson, to study in the Missionary Institute near Quincy. He now\r\ngave his time to farming, preaching, missionary service, and\r\nunderground railroad work. His son, George W., says, concerning\r\nMissionary Institute: \"At Missionary Institute the atmosphere was more\r\nmild, but such was the continued pressure by the slave-holding border\r\nof Mo., offering large rewards for the heads of the Institution, as\r\nwell for those who were known to be connected with the underground\r\nrailroad, that the Institution after having done much good went\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nThe years of his residence at Quincy were full of public excitement,\r\nperil, and strife. He was a spirited, progressive, and representative\r\nman. This was the time of the Illinois Prohibition Law, making it a\r\ncriminal offence to aid or encourage a runaway slave. The slavery\r\nquestion was being sharply discussed in all quarters, and began to\r\ncolor and modify the politics of the day. Anderson was a sharp, ready,\r\nand formidable debater, and was the most prominent Colored man in that\r\nsection of the country. He was gifted in the use of good English, had\r\nan easy flow of language, was master of the most galling satire, quick\r\nin repartee, prompt to see a weak point and use it to the best\r\nadvantage. He was a pungent and racy writer, and for a number of years\r\ncontributed many able articles to the \"Quincy Whig.\" He never spared\r\nslavery. In the pulpit, in the public prints, and in private, he\r\nfought manfully against the nefarious traffic in human flesh.\r\n\r\nDangerous as was the position he took he felt himself on the side of\r\ntruth, humanity, and God, and consequently felt that no harm could\r\nreach him. At this time, to the duties of farmer, pastor, and\r\ncontributor he added the severe and perilous duty of a missionary. He\r\ncanvassed the State, preaching and lecturing against slavery. Often he\r\nwas confronted by a mob who defied him, bantered him, but he always\r\nspoke. He was in every sense the child of nature, endowed with\r\nherculean strength, very tall, with a face beaming with benevolence\r\nand intelligence. He appeared at his best when opposed, and was\r\nenabled by his commanding presence, his phenomenal voice, and burning\r\neloquence to quiet and win the most obstreperous mob.\r\n\r\nIt was quite easy for a man to be carried away by the irresistible\r\nenthusiasm of the excited multitude, and think the rising of the\r\nanimal spirits the impulses of his better nature. But, for a man to be\r\nmoved from within, to feel the irresistible power of truth, to feel\r\nthat except he obeys the voice of his better nature he is arraigned by\r\nconscience--though the whole world without is against him, such a man\r\nis a hero, deserving of the gratitude and praise of the world.\r\n\r\nThere were heroes in the days of Anderson, and he was worthy of the\r\nhigh place he held among them. He was possessed of genius of the\r\nhighest order. He appreciated the times in which he lived. He was\r\nequal to the work of his generation, and did not shrink from any work\r\nhowsoever perilous. He worked between the sluggish conservatism of the\r\nanti-slavery element on the one hand, and the violent, mobocratic\r\nslave element on the other. Hence, the school of religious and\r\npolitical sentiment to which he belonged had few disciples and\r\nencountered many hardships. It was a desperate struggle between an\r\nignorant, self-seeking majority and an intelligent, self-sacrificing\r\nminority. It often appears that vice has more votaries than virtue,\r\nthat might is greater than right, and that wrong has the right of way.\r\nBut in the light of reason, history, and philosophy, we see the\r\ndivinity of truth and the mortality of error. We look down upon the\r\ngreat spiritual conflict going on in this world--in society and\r\ngovernment,--and seeing the mutations of fortune we think we see truth\r\nworsted, and sound the funeral requiem of our fondest hopes, our most\r\ncherished ideals.\r\n\r\nBut the mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly\r\nfine. Time rewards the virtuous and patient. It was faith in God,\r\nunited with a superior hope, that gave him strength in the darkest\r\nhours of the \"irrepressible conflict.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a faithful and indefatigable worker; and the State Missionary\r\nSociety honored him by thrice choosing him as State Missionary. About\r\nthis time he became an active member of the \"Underground Railroad.\"\r\nHis presence, bearing, and high character carried conviction. He made\r\nmen feel his superiority. He was, consequently, a safe counsellor and\r\na successful manager. He was soon elevated to an official position,\r\nwhich he filled with honor and satisfaction. Many slaves were helped\r\nto their freedom by his efforts and advice. He was bold, yet discreet;\r\nwise without pedantry; humble without religious affectation; firm\r\nwithout harshness; kind without weakness.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between slavery and freedom grew hotter and hotter; and\r\nthe spirit of intolerance became more general. Anderson had proven\r\nhimself an able defender of human freedom and a formidable enemy to\r\nslavery. But it _seemed_ as if his efforts in the great aggregate of\r\ngood were unavailing. His high hopes of educating his children were\r\nblasted in the burning of Missionary Institute by a mob from Missouri.\r\nIt was evident that the slave power would leave no stone unturned in\r\norder to accomplish their cowardly and inhuman designs. It was not\r\nenough to destroy the only school where all races could be educated\r\ntogether, to disturb the meetings of the few anti-slavery men who\r\ndared to discuss a question that they believed involved the golden\r\nrule and hence the well-being of the oppressed,--they put a price on\r\nhis head. He was to be hung to the first tree if caught upon the\r\nsacred soil of Missouri. He was secretly, though closely watched. One\r\nof his sons writes: \"He took a deep interest in the Underground\r\nRailroad in connection with a Mr. Turner and Vandorn of Quincy, and a\r\nMr. Hunter and Payne of Missionary Institute. These gentlemen, I\r\nbelieve, with the exception of Mr. Payne, are alive and extensively\r\nknown in the North.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not lacking in the qualities of moral or physical bravery. He\r\ncould not be bought or bullied. He was unmovable when he felt he was\r\nright. The bitterest assaults of his enemies only drove him nearer his\r\nideas, not from them. He might have lived and died in Quincy if he had\r\nnot greatly desired the education of his children, who were denied\r\nsuch privileges in the destruction of the institute.\r\n\r\nAt this time intelligent, to say nothing of educated, ministers were\r\nfew and far between. St. Louis was blessed with an excellent minister\r\nin the person of the Rev. Richard Anderson. He was a man of some\r\neducation, fine manners, good judgment, and deep piety; beloved and\r\nrespected by all classes both in and out of the church, white and\r\nblack. The Rev. Galusha Anderson, D.D., who pronounced the funeral\r\nsermon over the remains of Richard Anderson, says he had the largest\r\nfuneral St. Louis ever witnessed. His servant, who had been an\r\nattendant upon the ministrations of Richard Anderson, said mournfully,\r\nwhen asked by the doctor if they missed him: \"Ah, sir, he led us as by\r\na spider web!\" Richard Anderson saw Duke William Anderson and loved\r\nhim. He saw in the young man high traits of character, and in his rare\r\ngifts auguries of a splendid career. He saw the danger he lived in,\r\nthe hopeless condition of public sentiment, and advised him to accept\r\nthe pastoral charge of the Baptist church in Buffalo, N. Y., where\r\nalso he could educate his children.\r\n\r\nBuffalo was an anti-slavery stronghold. The late Gerrit Smith was\r\nchief of the party in that section of New York. By his vast wealth,\r\nhis high personal character, his deeply-rooted convictions, his\r\nwide-spread and consistent opposition to slavery, he was the most\r\nconspicuous character in the State, and made many converts to the\r\nanti-slavery cause. Buffalo was the centre of anti-slavery operations.\r\nMany conventions and conferences were held there. It was only\r\ntwenty-four miles to the Canadian boundaries, hence it was the last\r\nand most convenient station of the U. G. R. R.\r\n\r\nIt was now about 1854-1855. The anti-slavery sentiment was a\r\nrecognized and felt power in the politics of the Nation. Anderson\r\nappeared in Buffalo just in time to participate in the debates that\r\nwere rendering that city important. He took the pastoral charge of the\r\nBaptist church and high standing as a leader. He remained here quite\r\ntwo years or more, during which time he used the pulpit and the press\r\nas the vehicles of his invectives against slavery. He did not have to\r\ngo to men, they went to him. He was a great moral magnet, and\r\nattracted the best men of the city. The white clergy recognized in him\r\nthe qualities of a preacher and leader worthy of their admiration and\r\nrecognition. The Rev. Charles Dennison and other white brethren\r\ninvited him to their pulpits, where he displayed preaching ability\r\nworthy of the intelligent audiences that listened to his eloquent\r\ndiscourses.\r\n\r\nHis stay in Buffalo was salutary. By his industry and usefulness he\r\nbecame widely known and highly respected. And when he accepted a call\r\nfrom the Groghan Street Baptist Church, of Detroit, Michigan, his\r\nBuffalo friends were conscious that in his departure from them they\r\nsustained a very great loss.\r\n\r\nIt was now the latter part of 1857. The anti-slavery conflict was at\r\nits zenith. This controversy, as do all moral controversies, had\r\nbrought forth many able men; had furnished abundant material for\r\nsatire and rhetoric. This era presented a large and brilliant galaxy\r\nof Colored orators. There were Frederick Douglass--confessedly the\r\nhistoric Negro of America,--Charles L. Remond, Charles L. Reason,\r\nWilliam Wells Brown, Henry Highland Garnett, Martin R. Delany, James\r\nW. C. Pennington, Robert Purvis, Phillip A. Bell, Charles B. Ray,\r\nGeorge T. Downing, George B. Vashon, William C. Nell, Samuel A. Neale,\r\nWilliam Whipper, Ebenezer D. Bassett, William Howard Day, William\r\nStill, Jermain W. Loguen, Leonard A. Grimes, John Sella Martin, and\r\nmany others. Duke William Anderson belonged to the same school of\r\norators.\r\n\r\nThe church at Detroit had been under the pastoral charge of the Rev.\r\nWilliam Troy, who had accepted the pulpit of the Baptist church in\r\nWindsor, Canada West, and started to England to solicit funds to\r\ncomplete a beautiful edifice already in process of erection. At this\r\ntime John Sella Martin had obtained considerable notoriety as an\r\norator. He had canvassed the Western States in the interest of the\r\nanti-slavery cause, and was now residing in Detroit. He was baptized\r\nand ordained by Brethren Anderson and Troy, and took charge of the\r\nchurch at Buffalo.\r\n\r\nDetroit lies in a salubrious atmosphere, upon Detroit River, not far\r\nfrom Lake Erie; and at this time was not lacking in a high social and\r\nmoral atmosphere. The field was the most congenial he had yet labored\r\nin. He found an excellent church-membership, an intelligent and\r\nprogressive people. He was heartily welcomed and highly appreciated.\r\nHe entered into the work with zeal, and imparted an enthusiasm to the\r\npeople. He developed new elements of strength in the church. He\r\nattracted a large, cultivated audience, and held them to the last day\r\nhe remained in the city. His audience was not exclusively Colored:\r\nsome of the best white families were regular attendants upon his\r\npreaching; and they contributed liberally to his support. Detroit had\r\nnever seen the peer of Duke William Anderson in the pulpit. He did not\r\nsimply attract large congregations on the Sabbath, but had a warm\r\nplace in the affections of all classes, and a personal moral\r\ninfluence, which added much to the spirituality of the church. In\r\nevery church, thus far, he had been blessed with a revival of\r\nreligion, and souls had been added as \"seals to his ministry.\" Detroit\r\nwas no exception to the rule. Under his leadership, through his\r\npreaching and pastoral visitations the church was aroused, and the\r\nresult a revival. Many were added to the church.\r\n\r\nIt was now the spring of 1858. John Brown, the protomartyr of freedom,\r\nby his heroism, daring, intrepid perseverance, inspired,--swallowed\r\nwith one great idea, had stirred all Kansas and Missouri to fear, and\r\ncarried off eleven slaves to Canada and set them free. He had\r\nestablished his headquarters at Chatham, Canada West, and begun the\r\nwork of organization preparatory to striking the blow at Harper's\r\nFerry. Brown held his first convention at Chatham--only a few hours'\r\nride from Detroit--on May 8, 1858, at 10 o'clock A.M. The convention\r\nwas composed of some very able men. The following-named gentlemen\r\ncomposed the convention: Wm. Charles Monroe, President of the\r\nConvention; G. J. Reynolds, J. C. Grant, A. J. Smith, James M. Jones,\r\nGeo. B. Gill, M. F. Bailey, Wm. Lambert, C. W. Moffitt, John J.\r\nJackson, J. Anderson, Alfred Whipple, James M. Bue, Wm. H. Leeman,\r\nAlfred M. Ellsworth, John E. Cook, Stewart Taylor, James W. Purnell,\r\nGeo. Akin, Stephen Detlin, Thomas Hickinson, John Cannet, Robinson\r\nAlexander, Richard Realf, Thomas F. Cary, Thomas W. Stringer, Richard\r\nRichardson, J. T. Parsons, Thos. M. Kinnard, Martin R. Delany, Robert\r\nVanrankin, Charles H. Tidd, John A. Thomas, C. Whipple, J. D. Shad,\r\nRobert Newman, Owen Brown, John Brown, J. H. Harris, Charles Smith,\r\nSimon Fislin, Isaac Hotley, James Smith. Signed, J. H. Kagi. The\r\nfollowing is the list of officers elected:\r\n\r\nCommander-in-chief, John Brown; Secretary of War, J. H. Kagi; Members\r\nof Congress, Alfred M. Ellsworth, Osborn Anderson; Treasurer, Owen\r\nBrown; Secretary of Treasury, Geo. B. Gill; Secretary of State,\r\nRichard Realf.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that two Andersons are mentioned, J. Anderson and\r\nOsborn Anderson. [Who these gentlemen are, the author does not know,\r\nnor has he any means of knowing.]\r\n\r\nRev. D. W. Anderson's ministry in Detroit was a success both in and\r\nout of the pulpit, both among his parishioners and among those of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHis wife was in every sense a pastor's wife. She bore for him the\r\nlargest sympathy in his work; and cheered him with her prayers and\r\npresence in every good cause. She was intelligent and pious, loved by\r\nthe church, honored by society. She found pleasure in visiting the\r\nsick, helping the poor, comforting the sorrowful, and in instructing\r\nthe erring in ways of peace.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to compute the value of a pastor's wife who\r\nappreciates the work of saving souls. If she is a good woman her\r\ninfluence is unbounded. Every person loves her, every person looks up\r\nto her. There are so many little things that she can do, if not beyond\r\nthe province of the pastor, often out of range of his influence. Mrs.\r\nAnderson was all that could be hoped as a pastor's wife. She was of\r\nmedium size, in complexion light, rather reserved in her manners,\r\naffable in address, very sensitive in her physical and mental\r\nconstitution. Much of Anderson's service in Detroit must go to the\r\naccount of his sainted wife. And it may not be irrelevant to remark\r\nthat every minister of Christ's influence and success is perceptibly\r\nmodified by his wife--much depends upon her!\r\n\r\nEighteen years of happy wedded life had passed. It was the autumn of\r\n1860. Mrs. Anderson's health was failing. Her presence was missed from\r\nthe church, from society, and at last on the 23d of October, 1860, she\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March, 1861, he married again, Mrs. Eliza Julia Shad,\r\nof Chatham, Canada. He turned his attention to farming for a while, in\r\norder to regain his health.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war he went South and taught in a theological\r\ninstitution at Nashville. Soon after he began his work here he\r\nreceived and accepted a call from the 19th Street Baptist Church of\r\nWashington, D. C. Washington was in a vile condition at the close of\r\nthe war. Its streets were mud holes; its inhabitants crowded and\r\njammed by the troops and curious Negroes from the plantations. Society\r\nwas in a critical condition. There was great need of a leader for the\r\nColored people. D. W. Anderson was that man. He entered upon his work\r\nwith zeal and intelligence. He carried into the pulpit rare abilities,\r\nand into the parish work a genial, kindly nature which early gave him\r\na place in the affections and confidence of his flock.\r\n\r\nAs a preacher he was a marvel. He generally selected his text early in\r\nthe week. He studied its exegesis, made the plan of the sermon, and\r\nthen began to choose his illustrations and fill in. On Sunday he would\r\nrise in his pulpit, a man six feet two and a half inches, and in a\r\nrich, clear, deliberate voice commence an extemporaneous discourse.\r\nHis presence was majestic. With a massive head, much like that of John\r\nAdams, a strong brown eye that flashed as he moved on in his\r\ndiscourse, a voice sweet and well modulated, but at times rising to\r\ntones of thunder, graceful, ornate, forcible, and dramatic, he was the\r\npeer of any clergyman in Washington, and of Negroes there were none\r\nhis equal.\r\n\r\nHe showed himself a power in the social life of his people by being\r\nhimself a living epistle. He encouraged the young, and set every one\r\nwho knew him an example of fidelity and efficiency in the smaller\r\nmatters of life.\r\n\r\nHis early experiences were now in demand. The entire community\r\nrecognized in him the elements of magnificent leadership. He was in\r\ngreat demand in every direction. He was elected a Trustee of the\r\nHoward University, of the Freedman's Saving Bank and Trust Company,\r\nCommissioner of Washington Asylum, Sept. 3d, 1871, and Justice of the\r\nPeace, 8th of April, 1869, and 9th of April, 1872. The vast amount of\r\nwork he did on the outside did not impair his usefulness as a pastor\r\nor his faithfulness as a minister of the Gospel. On the contrary he\r\ngathered ammunition and experience from every direction. He made\r\nevery thing help him in his preparation for the pulpit. His deep\r\nspiritual life, his nearness to the Master gave him power with men. No\r\nwinter passed without a revival of grace and the conversion of scores\r\nof sinners. Thus the work continued until the house was both too small\r\nand unsafe. Plans were drawn and steps taken to build a new church\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday in March, 1871, the old house of worship, on the\r\ncorner of Nineteenth and I streets was abandoned, and the congregation\r\nwent to worship in the Stevens School building. The corner-stone of\r\nthe new building was laid on the 5th of April, 1871, and the new\r\nedifice dedicated on the 19th of November, 1871, five months after the\r\nwork had begun. The dedicatory exercises were as follows:\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock precisely. Rev. D. W. Anderson, pastor in charge,\r\nannounced that the hour for the religious exercises to commence had\r\narrived, and he took pleasure in introducing his predecessor. Rev.\r\nSamuel W. Madden, of Alexandria, Va., who gave out the 934th hymn,\r\nwhich was sung with considerable fervor and spirit, the entire\r\ncongregation rising and participating; after which, Rev. Jas. A.\r\nHandy, read from the 6th chapter, 2d Chronicles, and also addressed\r\nthe throne of grace.\r\n\r\n\"Lift up your heads, ye eternal gates\" was admirably rendered by the\r\nchoir, when the following letter was read from the President:\r\n\r\n                                   \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,        }\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, Nov. 18, 1871. }\r\n\r\n     \"To Rev. D. W. ANDERSON, No. 1971 I Street,\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: The President directs me to say that your note of the 8th\r\n     inst., inviting him to be present at the dedication of your\r\n     church, was mislaid during his absence from the city, and was not\r\n     brought to his notice till to-day. He regrets that his\r\n     engagements will not admit of his attendance at the time you\r\n     mention. He congratulates your congregation upon the completion\r\n     of so handsome a place of worship, and hopes that its dedication\r\n     may prove an occasion of deep interest to all who share in a\r\n     desire to promote the spread of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n                              \"I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                        \"HORACE PORTER, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Henry Williams, of Petersburg, Va., who was announced to preach\r\nthe dedicatory sermon, selected the following words: \"And he was\r\nafraid, and said: How dreadful is this place! this is none other but\r\nthe house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among those present, who had been invited by Rev. Mr.\r\nAnderson, were His Excellency Governor H. D. Cooke, Hon. N. P.\r\nChipman, Delegate to Congress; A. L. Sturtevant, Esq., Chief of\r\nStationery Bureau, Treasury Department; Ed. Young, Esq., Chief of the\r\nBureau of Statistics; Hon. A. K. Browne, Col. Wm. A. Cook, Dr. A. T.\r\nAugusta, and Wm. H. Thompson, Esq., of Philadelphia. While, seated\r\naround the altar, were Rev. Leonard A. Grimes, of Boston; Rev. Samuel.\r\nW Madden, of Alexandria, Va.; Rev. Geo. W. Goins, of Philadelphia;\r\nRev. Jas. A. Handy, Washington; and Rev. Wm. Troy, Richmond, Va. At\r\nthree o'clock, Rev. Leonard A. Grimes officiated and delivered an\r\neloquent sermon.\r\n\r\nA work of grace followed the dedication of the church; and from month\r\nto month souls were converted. On the 21st of January, 1873, he wrote\r\nthe following letter to a Baptist minister residing in Chicago:\r\n\r\n               \"1921, I Street, WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 21, 1873.\r\n\r\n     \"REV. R. DEBAPTIST:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR BROTHER: I write to inform you of a wonderful outpouring of\r\n     the Spirit of God in the 19th Street Baptist Church of which I am\r\n     pastor. Without any especial effort, up to the last few days,\r\n     there have been one to five converted every month, for the past\r\n     seven years, in the congregation. This led too many to think that\r\n     that was enough. At our watch-meeting I asked how many there were\r\n     who would come to the front pews and kneel before God as a token\r\n     to Christians to pray for them, and ten came. We had no other\r\n     meeting until my weekly lecture, the first Thursday night in\r\n     January after it. I saw a great feeling and called again; and\r\n     there came twenty-two. The brethren and sisters decided to hold\r\n     meeting the next night, and there came thirty-two who were\r\n     converted. Now, at this date, Monday night, 20th, there came\r\n     forward 'ninety-seven'; and there were over a hundred on their\r\n     knees praying. Twenty-two found peace in believing last night.\r\n\r\n     \"We are all well. Pray for us. Write soon.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Yours ever,\r\n                                         \"D. W. ANDERSON.\"\r\n\r\nHe was taken sick on the 7th of February, 1873, and after a painful\r\nillness of eleven days, he fell asleep on the 17th of February, full\r\nof years and honors, and was gathered to the fathers. On the Monday\r\nevening, just before he died, he told his wife, daughter, and a small\r\ncompany of friends who surrounded his death-bed: \"It's all well,\" and\r\nthen, at 7:30 P.M., quietly \"fell on sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of his death cast gloom into thousands of hearts, and evoked\r\neulogies and letters of condolence never before bestowed upon a Negro.\r\nHis death was to the members of his church in the nature of a personal\r\nbereavement. The various interests to which he had loaned the\r\nenlightening influence of his judgment and the beneficence of his\r\npresence mourned his loss, and expressed their grief in appropriate\r\nresolutions. His life and character formed a fitting theme for the\r\nleading pulpits; and the Baptist denomination, the Negro race, and the\r\nnation sincerely mourned the loss of a great preacher, an able leader,\r\nand a pure patriot.\r\n\r\nAt the request of many people of both races and political parties, his\r\nbody was placed in state in the church for twenty-four hours, and\r\nthousands of people, rich and poor, black and white, sorrowfully gazed\r\nupon the face of the illustrious dead. The funeral services were held\r\non the 20th of February, and his obsequies were the largest Washington\r\nhad ever seen, except those of the late Abraham Lincoln. The church\r\nwas crowded to suffocation, and the streets for many squares were\r\nfilled with solemn mourners. Thus a great man had fallen. The officers\r\nof the Freedman's Bank passed the following resolutions, which were\r\nforwarded with the accompanying letter from the president:\r\n\r\n                    \"OFFICE OF THE FREEDMAN'S SAVINGS AND TRUST  }\r\n                    COMPANY, WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 20th, 1873. }\r\n\r\n     \"At a meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Freedman's Savings\r\n     and Trust Company, held this date, the following resolutions were\r\n     adopted:\r\n\r\n     \"1st. _Resolved_, That in the death of the Rev.

Died Feb. 17th, 1873.\r\n          \"'I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.'\r\n\r\n     \"He was ordained in 1844, and after a ministry of 21 years\r\n     settled with the 19th Street Baptist Church of Washington, D. C.,\r\n     where he fell asleep in the midst of a great revival.\r\n\r\n     \"For the cause of education, the welfare of the poor, the\r\n     promotion of humanity, liberty, and the conversion of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"He labored faithfully until the Master called him hence.\"\r\n\r\nThis beautiful life was studded with the noblest virtues. From\r\nobscurity and poverty Duke William Anderson had risen to fame and\r\nhonors; and having spent a useful life, died in the midst of a great\r\nrevival in the capital of the nation, holding more positions of trust\r\nthan any other man, white or black; died with harness on, and left a\r\nname whose lustre will survive the corroding touch of time.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Poindexter, of Columbus, Ohio, and the Rev. Wallace\r\nShelton, of Cincinnati, are now and have been for years the foremost\r\nBaptist ministers of Ohio. Both men came to Ohio more than a\r\ngeneration ago, and have proven themselves able ministers of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut of New England Baptist ministers Leonard Andrew Grimes is of most\r\nblessed memory.\r\n\r\nIt was some time during the year 1840, when disputings arose--about\r\nwhat is not known--within the membership of what was known as the\r\n\"First Independent Baptist Church,\" of Boston, Mass., which resulted\r\nin the drawing out from the same of about forty members. This party\r\nwas led by the Rev. Mr. Black, who had been, for some time, pastor of\r\nthe church he now left. They secured a place of worship in Smith\r\nCourt, off of Joy Street, where they continued for a considerable\r\nspace of time. It was not long, however, after they began to worship\r\nin their new home, before their highly esteemed and venerable leader\r\nwas stricken down with disease, from which he subsequently died.\r\n\r\nThis little band was now without a leader, and was, consequently,\r\nspeedily rent by a schism within its own circle. But in the nucleus\r\nthat finally became the Twelfth Baptist Church, there were faithful\r\nmen and women who believed in the integrity of their cause, and,\r\ntherefore, stood firm. They believed that \"He who was for them was\r\ngreater than all they who were against them.\" Though few in number,\r\nthey felt that \"one shall chase a thousand, and two shall put ten\r\nthousand to flight,\" was a very pertinent passage when applied to\r\nthemselves. And those who have been blessed to see that little\r\n\"company of believers\" grow to be an exceedingly large and prosperous\r\nchurch of Christ must be persuaded that God alone gave \"the increase.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time this little company struggled on without a leader.\r\nThey were called upon to walk through many discouraging scenes, and to\r\nhumble themselves under the remorseless hand of poverty. Unable to\r\nsecure, permanently, the services of a clergyman, they were driven to\r\nthe necessity of obtaining whomsoever they could when the Sabbath\r\ncame. And what a blessed thing it was for them that they were placed\r\nunder the severe discipline of want! It taught them humility and\r\nfaith--lessons often so hard to acquire. They bore their trials\r\nheroically, and esteemed it great joy to be counted worthy to suffer\r\nfor Christ. When one Sabbath was ended they knew not whom the Lord\r\nwould send the next; and yet they never suffered for the \"Word of\r\nGod.\" For He who careth for the lilies of the field, and bears up the\r\nfalling sparrow, fed them with the \"bread of life,\" and gave them to\r\ndrink of the waters of salvation. \"Unto the poor the Gospel was\r\npreached.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of pain and waiting, after the watching and praying,\r\nthe hoping and fearing, God seemed pleased to hear the prayers of this\r\nlonely band, and gave them a leader. It was whispered in the community\r\nthat a very intelligent and useful man, by the name of \"Grimes,\" of\r\nNew Bedford, could be retained as their leader. After some\r\ndeliberation upon the matter, they chose one of their number to pay a\r\nvisit to \"Brother Leonard A. Grimes, of New Bedford,\" and on behalf\r\nof the company worshipping in \"an upper room,\" on Belknap Street--now\r\nJoy Street--Boston, extended him an invitation to come and spend a\r\nSabbath with them. In accordance with their request he paid them a\r\nvisit. Impressed with the dignity of his bearing, and the earnestness\r\nof his manner, the company was unanimous in an invitation, inviting\r\n\"the young preacher\" to return and remain with them for \"three\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted with alacrity, and the work begun with a\r\nzeal worthy of the subsequent life of \"the beloved pastor of the\r\nTwelfth Baptist Church.\" Brother L. A. Grimes had been driven North on\r\naccount of his friendly and humane relations to the oppressed. He had\r\nbeen incarcerated by the laws of slave-holding Virginia, for wresting\r\nfrom her hand, and piloting into the land of freedom, those whom\r\nslavery had marked as her children--or, rather, her \"_goods_.\" A soul\r\nlike his was too grand to live in such an atmosphere. In keeping the\r\ngolden rule, he had insulted the laws of the institution under whose\r\nmerciless sway thousands of human beings were groaning. He would live\r\nno longer where his convictions of duty were to be subordinated to,\r\nand palliated by, the penurious and cruel teaching of the slave\r\ninstitution. So, after having been robbed of his property, he left, in\r\ncompany with his family, for the fair shores of New England. He had\r\nsought no distinction, but had settled down to a quiet life in New\r\nBedford. But a man of his worth could not stay in the quiet walks of\r\nlife; he was born to lead, and heard God call him to the work his soul\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nHis quiet, unpretentious ministry of \"three months\" shadowed forth the\r\nloving, gentle, yet vigorous and successful ministry of a quarter of a\r\ncentury; a ministry so like the Master's, not confined to sect or\r\nnationality, limited only by the wants of humanity and the great\r\nheart-love that went gushing out to friend and foe. Those who were so\r\nhappy as to sit under his ministry for the \"three months\" were quite\r\nunwilling to be separated from one whose ministry had so greatly\r\ncomforted and built them up. In the young preacher they had found a\r\nleader of excellent judgment, a pastor of tender sympathies, and a\r\nfather who loved them with all the strength of true manly affection.\r\nHow could they retain him? They were poor. How could they release him?\r\nThey loved him. After much prayer and pleading, Brother Grimes was\r\nsecured as their leader, with a salary at the rate of $100 per annum.\r\nHe returned to New Bedford and moved his family to Boston. His salary\r\nbarely paid his rent; but by working with his hands, as Paul did, and\r\nthrough the industry of his wife, he was enabled to get along.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time this little company of believers was without\r\n\"church organization.\" At length a council was called and their prayer\r\nfor organization presented. After the procedure common to such\r\ncouncils, it was voted that this company of Christian men and women be\r\norganized as the \"Twelfth Baptist Church.\" The church consisted of\r\ntwenty-three members.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 24th of November, 1848, occurred the services of\r\nthe recognition of the church, and the ordination of Rev. L. A. Grimes\r\nas its pastor. The order of exercises was as follows:\r\n\r\nReading of Scriptures and prayer, by the Rev. Edmund Kelley; sermon,\r\nby the Rev. J. Banvard, subject: \"The way of salvation,\" from Acts\r\nxvi, 17: \"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men\r\nare the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of\r\nsalvation\"; hand of fellowship to the church, by the Rev. T. F.\r\nCaldicott; prayer of recognition and ordination, by the Rev. John\r\nBlain; charge to the candidate, by the Rev. Nathaniel Colver; address\r\nto the church, by the Rev. Rollin H. Neale; concluding prayer, by the\r\nRev. Sereno Howe; benediction, by the pastor, Rev. Leonard A. Grimes.\r\n\r\nThe exercises were of a very pleasant nature, and of great interest to\r\nthe humble little church that assembled to enjoy them. It was an\r\noccasion of no small moment that published to the world the \"Twelfth\r\nBaptist Church,\" and sent upon a mission of love and mercy, Leonard\r\nAndrew Grimes! It was an occasion that has brought great strength to\r\nthe Colored people of Boston, yea, of the country! It was the opening\r\nof a door; it was the loosening of chains, the beginning of a ministry\r\nthat was to stretch over a period of twenty-five years, carrying peace\r\nand blessing to men in every station. And may we not, with propriety,\r\nhalt upon the threshold of our gratitude, and thank that wise Being\r\nwho gave him, a blessing to the church a friend to humanity?\r\n\r\nHappy, thrice happy, was the little church that had wedded itself for\r\nlife to one who had laid himself upon the altar of their common cause.\r\nThese relations and manifold responsibilities were not hastily or\r\nrashly assumed. The little church felt keenly its poverty and\r\nweakness, while its new pastor knew that the road to prosperity lay\r\nthrough fields of toil and up heights of difficulty. Before him was no\r\ndark future, for the light of an extraordinary faith scattered the\r\ndarkness as he advanced to duty. What man of intelligence, without\r\ncapital or social influence, would have undertaken so discouraging a\r\nproject as that to which Leonard A. Grimes unconditionally brought the\r\nsanctified zeal of a loving heart? To him it was purely a matter of\r\nduty, and it was this thought that urged him on with his almost\r\nsuperhuman burdens.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the \"upper chamber,\" and take one more look at the\r\nhappy little church. It was not the pastor's object to begin at once\r\nto perfect plans to secure a place more desirable to worship in than\r\ntheir present little room. His heart longed for that enlargement of\r\nsoul secured by a nearness to the divine Master. His heart yearned\r\nafter those who were enemies to the \"_cross of Christ_.\" His first\r\nprayer was: \"O Lord, revive thy work!\" and it was not offered in vain.\r\nA season of prayer was instituted for the outpouring of the Spirit.\r\nThe pastor led the way to the throne of grace in a fervent and\r\nall-embracing prayer. A spirit of prayer fell upon his people. Every\r\nheart trembled in tenderest sympathy for those who were strangers to\r\nthe \"covenant of mercy\"; every eye was dampened with tears of\r\ngratitude and love; every tongue was ready to exclaim with Watts:--\r\n\r\n    \"'T was the same love that spread the feast,\r\n      That sweetly forced us in;\r\n    Else we had still refused to taste,\r\n      And perished in our sin.\"\r\n\r\nThe church had reached that point in feeling where the blessing is\r\nsure. They heard the coming of the chariot, and felt the saving power\r\nof the Lord in their midst. It was a glorious revival. There were more\r\nconverted than there were members in the church. Oh, what joy, what\r\npeace, what comfort in the Holy Ghost was there in that \"upper\r\nchamber\"! What tongue or pen can describe the scene in that room when\r\nover thirty souls were gathered into the fold! A pastor's _first_\r\nrevival! What rejoicing! The gathering of his first children in the\r\nLord! Ask Paul what conscious pride he took in those who were his\r\n\"epistles,\" his \"fruit in the Gospel,\" his \"children\" in Christ\r\nJesus. It lifted Brother Grimes up to the heights of Pisgah in his\r\nrejoicing, and laid him low at the cross in his humility. \"The Lord\r\nhad done great things for him, whereof he was glad\"; And they \"did eat\r\ntheir meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and\r\nhaving favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church\r\ndaily such as should be saved.\"\r\n\r\nThe rooms in which they began now proved too small for their rapidly\r\nincreasing membership. They agreed to have a building of their own. It\r\nwas now the latter part of 1848. The business eye of the pastor fell\r\nupon a lot on Southac Street; and in the early part of 1849 the\r\ntrustees purchased it. Preparations for building were at once begun.\r\nIt seemed a large undertaking for a body of Christians so humble in\r\ncircumstances, so weak in numbers. But faith and works were the\r\n_genii_ that turned the tide of prosperity in their favor. They\r\ndecided that the ground and edifice should not exceed in cost the sum\r\nof $10,000. The society proposed to raise two or three thousand within\r\nits own membership; three thousand by loan, and solicit the remainder\r\nfrom the Christian public. Previous to this period the public knew\r\nlittle or nothing of this society. Brother Grimes had come to Boston\r\nalmost an entire stranger, and had now to undertake the severe task of\r\npresenting the interests of a society so obscure and of so recent\r\ndate. But he believed in his cause, and knew that success would come.\r\nHe had known Dr. Neale in Washington City, during his early ministry;\r\nthey were boys together. They met. It was a pleasant meeting. The Rev.\r\nMr. Neale vouched for him before the public. It was not particularly\r\nnecessary, for Brother Grimes carried a recommendation in his face: it\r\nwas written all over with veracity and benevolence.\r\n\r\nJoyfully and successfully he hurried on his mission. He made friends\r\nof the enemies of evangelical religion, and gathered a host of\r\nadmirers around him. The public saw in him not only the zealous pastor\r\nof an humble little church, but the true friend of humanity. The\r\npublic ear was secured; his prayer was answered in the munificent\r\ngifts that came in from every direction. Every person seemed anxious\r\nto contribute something to this noble object.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning! The sun never shone brighter, nor the air\r\nsmelled sweeter or purer than on that memorable first day of August,\r\n1850. The first persons to usher themselves into the street that\r\nmorning were the happy members of the \"_Twelfth_ _Baptist Church_.\"\r\nEvery face told of the inward joy and peace of thankful hearts. Those\r\nwho had toiled long through the days of the church's \"small things,\"\r\nfelt that their long-cherished hopes were beginning to bud.\r\n\r\nLong before the appointed hour the members and friends of the church\r\nbegan to gather to participate in the \"laying of the corner-stone of\r\nthe Twelfth Baptist Church.\" It was a sweet, solemn occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Drs. Sharp, Neale and Colver, together with the pastor of the\r\nchurch, officiated on the occasion. The usual documents were deposited\r\nwith the stone, and the customary proceedings gone through with, in a\r\nsolemn and impressive manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion lent an enthusiasm for the work hitherto unknown. They\r\nwere emboldened. The future looked bright, and on every hand the times\r\nwere propitious. Gradually the walls of the edifice grew heavenward,\r\nand the building began to take on a pleasing phase. At length the\r\nwalls had reached their proper height, and the roof crowned all. Their\r\nsky was never brighter. It is true a \"little speck of cloud\" was seen\r\nin the distance; but they were as unsuspicious as children. The cloud\r\napproached gradually, and, as it approached, took on its terrible\r\ncharacteristics. It paused a while; it trembled. Then there was a\r\ndeath-like silence in the air, and in a moment it vomited forth its\r\nforked lightning, and rolled its thunder along the sky. It was the\r\nexplosion of a Southern shell over a Northern camp, that was lighted\r\nby the torch of ambition in the hands of fallen Webster. It was the\r\nculmination of slave-holding Virginia's wrath. It was invading the\r\nvirgin territory of liberty-loving Massachusetts. It was hunting the\r\nfugitive on free soil, and tearing him from the very embrace of sweet\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to enlist Colored soldiers, Leonard A. Grimes was\r\nas untiring in his vigilance as any friend of the Fifty-fourth\r\nRegiment of Massachusetts volunteers, while the members of his church\r\nwere either joining or aiding the regiment. So highly were the\r\nservices of Brother Grimes prized that the chaplaincy of the regiment\r\nwas not only tendered him, but urged upon him; but the multifarious\r\nduties of his calling forbade his going with the regiment he loved and\r\nrevered.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of his congregation were busy with their needles, thus\r\naiding the cause of the Union; and no church threw its doors open more\r\nreadily to patriotic meetings than the Twelfth Baptist Church. And\r\nduring those dark days of the Union, when all seemed hopeless, when\r\nour armies were weak and small, the prayers of a faithful pastor and\r\npious people ascended day and night, and did much to strengthen the\r\ndoubting.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive-slave law and civil war had done much to weaken the\r\nchurch financially and numerically. Many who fled from the\r\nfugitive-slave law had not returned; the young men had entered the\r\nservice of the country, while many others were absent from the city\r\nunder various circumstances. But notwithstanding all these facts, God\r\nblessed the church--even in war times,--and many were converted.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was now ended. \"The Boys in Blue\" came home in triumph.\r\nThe father separated from child, the husband from wife, could now meet\r\nagain. Those who were driven before the wrath of an impious and cruel\r\nedict could now return to the fold without fear. What a happy occasion\r\nit was for the whole church! The reunion of a family long separated;\r\nthe gathering of dispersed disciples. The occasion brought such an\r\nundistinguishable throng of fancies--such joy, such hope, such blessed\r\nfellowship--as no pen can describe.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Rebellion the church numbered about 246;\r\nand at the close of the Rebellion it numbered about 300,\r\nnotwithstanding the discouraging circumstances under which she\r\nlabored. The revivals that followed brought many into the church, and\r\nthe heart of the pastor was greatly encouraged.\r\n\r\nAt first it was thought that the entire cost of the land and building\r\nwould not exceed $10,000; but the whole cost, from the time they began\r\nto build until the close of the war, was $14,044.09. In 1861 the\r\nindebtedness of the church was $2,967.62; at the close of the war it\r\nwas about $2,000.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years of financial struggle the church had ever paid\r\nher notes with promptness and without difficulty. And now that the war\r\nwas over, freedom granted to the enslaved, and the public again\r\nbreathing easy, the little church, not weary of well-doing, again\r\nbegan the work of removing the remaining debt. The public was sought\r\nonly in the most extreme necessity. The ladies held sewing circles,\r\nand made with the needle fancy articles to be sold in a festival,\r\nwhile the members of the church were contributing articles of wearing\r\napparel, or offering their services at the sale tables. The proceeds\r\nwere given to the society to pay its debts; and it was no mean gift.\r\n\r\nFrom 1865 to 1871 the church grew rapidly. Revivals were of frequent\r\noccurrence; and many from the South, learning of the good name of Rev.\r\nMr. Grimes, sought his church when coming to Boston. But it was\r\napparent that their once commodious home was now too small. The pastor\r\nsaw this need, and began to take the proper steps to meet it. It was\r\nat length decided that the church should undergo repairs; and the\r\npastor was armed with the proper papers to carry forward this work.\r\nThe gallery that was situated in the east end of the church was used\r\nchiefly by the choir and an instrument. In making repairs it was\r\nthought wise to remove the organ from the gallery, and put in seats,\r\nand thereby accommodate a larger number of people. Then, the old\r\npulpit took up a great deal of room, and by putting in a new pulpit of\r\nless dimensions, more room could be secured for pews. This was done,\r\nwith the addition of a baptistry, the lack of which for nearly\r\ntwenty-five years had driven them, in all kinds of weather, to Charles\r\nRiver. Every thing, from the basement up, underwent repairs. The pews\r\nwere painted and furnished with book-racks. The floors were repaired,\r\nand covered with beautiful carpet; while the walls and ceilings were\r\nrichly clothed with fresco, by the hands of skilful workmen. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was an excellent ventilator, from which was\r\nsuspended a very unique chandelier, with twelve beautiful globes, that\r\nwere calculated to dispense their mellow light upon the worshippers\r\nbelow. But to crown all this expensive work and exceeding beauty thus\r\nbestowed upon the house, was the beautiful organ that adorned the\r\nsouthwest corner of the church, just to the pastor's right when in the\r\npulpit. It was secured for the sum of two thousand five hundred\r\ndollars. All was accomplished. The old house of worship was now\r\nentirely refitted. No heart was happier than the pastor's the day the\r\nchurch was reopened.[132] The new and elegant organ sent forth its\r\nloud peals of music in obedience to the masterly touch of the\r\n\"_faithful one_,\" who for more than twelve years was never absent from\r\nher post of duty, and whom none knew but to love and honor.\r\n\r\nWhat supreme satisfaction there is in the accomplishment of a work\r\nthat comprehends, not the interests of an individual, but the\r\ninterests of the greatest number of human beings! The labors of Rev.\r\nMr. Grimes were bestowed upon those whom he loved. He had toiled for\r\nhis church as a father does to support his family. And no pastor,\r\nperhaps, was ever more paternal to his flock than Leonard A. Grimes.\r\nHe was a man wondrously full of loving-kindness,--a lover of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt has been the rule rather than the exception, for a long time, for\r\nchurches to carry heavy debts; and when a church is free from debt, it\r\ncertainly furnishes a cause for great rejoicing. It was so with the\r\nTwelfth Baptist Church. For a long time--more than twenty years--the\r\nchurch had been before the public as an object of charity. For more\r\nthan twenty years the people had struggled heroically amid all of the\r\nstorms that gathered around them. Sometimes they expected to see \"_the\r\nred flag_\" upon their house of worship, but the flag Was never raised.\r\n\r\nThe debts of the church had all been removed. The house was absolutely\r\nfree from every encumbrance; the people owned their church.\r\n\r\nBut the little church of twenty-three had become the large church of\r\nsix hundred. The once commodious house was now too small for the\r\ncommunicants of the church. The pastor began to look around for a\r\nplace to build, and considered the matter of enlarging the present\r\nhouse of worship. He had expended the strength of his manhood in the\r\nservice of his church; he had built one house, and had never denied\r\nthe public his service. It would seem natural that a man whose life\r\nhad been so stormy, yea, so full of toil and care, would seek in\r\nadvanced age the rest and quiet so much desired at that stage of life.\r\nBut it was not so with Brother Grimes. He was willing to begin another\r\nlifetime work, and with all the freshness of desire and energy of\r\nyoung manhood.\r\n\r\nIt was now the latter part of the winter of 1873. A revival had been\r\nfor a long time, and was still, in progress. Converts were coming into\r\nthe church rapidly. The heart of the pastor was never fuller of love\r\nthan during the revival. He seemed to be in agony for sinners to be\r\nsaved. He impatiently paced the aisles, and held private and personal\r\ninterviews with the impenitent. He disliked to leave the church at the\r\nclose of the services. He remained often in the vestibule, watching\r\nfor an opportunity to say a word for the Saviour. Brother C. G. Swan,\r\nwho preached for him once, said: \"I never beheld a more heavenly face;\r\nit seemed as if his soul were ripe for heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThose who saw him in the pulpit the last Sabbath he spent on\r\nearth--March 9, 1874--will not soon forget the earnestness and\r\nimpressiveness of his manner. On Wednesday, March 12th, he left the\r\nscene of his labors to discharge a duty nearest to his heart. He took\r\n$100 from his poor church, as a gift to the _Home Mission Society_,\r\nthat was to be used in the _Freedman's Fund_.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening, March 14th, he reached home just in time to breathe\r\nhis last in the arms of his faithful, though anxious wife. Thus he\r\nfell asleep in the path of duty, in the midst of a mighty work.\r\n\r\nThe news of his death spread rapidly, and cast a shadow of grief over\r\nthe entire community. The people mourned him.\r\n\r\nThe morning papers gave full account and notice of his death. The\r\nfollowing is one of the many notices that were given:\r\n\r\n     \"DEATH OF AN ESTEEMED CLERGYMAN.\r\n\r\n     \"The Rev. L. A. Grimes, the well-known and universally esteemed\r\n     colored clergyman, died very suddenly last evening, at his\r\n     residence on Everett Avenue, East Somerville. He had just\r\n     returned from New York, where he had been to attend the meeting\r\n     of the _Baptist Board of Home Missions_, of which he was a\r\n     member. He had walked to his home from the cars, and died within\r\n     fifteen minutes after his arrival. The physicians pronounce it a\r\n     case of apoplexy. Mr. Grimes was pastor of the Twelfth Baptist\r\n     Church, on Phillips Street, in this city. During the twenty-six\r\n     years of his ministry in Boston he had won the confidence and\r\n     regard, not only of his own sect, but of the entire community.\r\n     His labors for the good of his oppressed race attracted public\r\n     attention to him more than twenty years ago, and this interest\r\n     manifested itself in the generous contributions of Unitarians,\r\n     Episcopalians, and Universalists in aid of his church. During the\r\n     thirty-four dark days of the infamous Fugitive-Slave Law, and the\r\n     excitements occasioned by slave hunts in Boston, Mr. Grimes had a\r\n     'level head,' and did much to keep down riotous outbreaks from\r\n     those who then were told that they had no rights that white men\r\n     were bound to respect. Fortunate, indeed, will be the church of\r\n     the deceased, if his successor, like him, shall be able to keep\r\n     them together, and lead them in righteous ways for a quarter of a\r\n     century.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday morning, at the ministers' meeting,\r\nappropriate remarks were made, and resolutions drawn up. The following\r\nappeared in the daily papers:\r\n\r\n     \"BAPTIST MINISTERS' MEETING.\r\n\r\n     \"The Monday morning meeting of the Baptist ministers of Boston\r\n     and vicinity was held at ten o'clock, Monday, as is the weekly\r\n     custom. After the devotional exercises, the committee to prepare\r\n     resolutions on the death of the late Rev. Leonard Andrew Grimes\r\n     made their report to the meeting. Pending the acceptance of the\r\n     report remarks eulogizing the deceased were made by Rev. R. H.\r\n     Neale, D.D., and others. The resolutions, which were thereupon\r\n     given a place upon the records of the meeting, are as follows: In\r\n     the death of Leonard Andrew Grimes, for twenty-seven years the\r\n     pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church of Boston, the city in which\r\n     he lived, the race for which he labored have sustained an\r\n     irreparable loss. The _confrère_ of Daniel Sharp, Baron Stow,\r\n     Phineas Stow, Nathaniel Colver, Rev. Mr. Graves of the\r\n     'Reflector,' he was one whose coming might always be welcomed\r\n     with the exclamation of our Saviour concerning Nathaniel: 'Behold\r\n     an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.' His last efforts\r\n     were put forth for his race. He carried to the Board of the\r\n     American Baptist Home Mission Society, of which he had been for\r\n     many years an honored member, a large contribution from his\r\n     church, to help on Christ's work among the Freedmen, and, on\r\n     returning from New York, stopped at New Bedford to comfort a\r\n     broken-hearted mother, whose little child was dying, and then\r\n     came to the city, and in fifteen minutes after crossing the\r\n     threshold of his home passed on to God.\r\n\r\n     \"His death affected the ministry and churches as when 'a\r\n     standard-bearer fainteth.' His familiar face was ever welcome.\r\n     His resolute bearing, his unswerving fidelity to Christ, to\r\n     truth, to the church at large, and his own denomination in\r\n     particular, and his life-long service as a philanthropist, his\r\n     devotion to the interests of the negro, to whom he was linked by\r\n     ties of consanguinity and of sympathy, made him a felt power for\r\n     good in our State and in our entire country. No man among us was\r\n     more sincerely respected or more truly loved. His departure,\r\n     while it came none too soon for the tired warrior, impoverishes\r\n     us with the withdrawal of an all-embracing love, and leaves God's\r\n     poor to suffer to an extent it is impossible to describe.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the death of this good minister of Jesus Christ\r\n     imposes heavy responsibilities upon his surviving brethren. The\r\n     interests of the race of which he was an honored representative\r\n     are imperilled. Their noble champion has gone up higher; but no\r\n     waiting Elisha saw the ascent, and cried, 'My father, my father,\r\n     the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof'; so who can hope\r\n     to wear his mantle and continue his work?\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we tender to his afflicted widow, and to the\r\n     church he had so long and faithfully served, this poor expression\r\n     of our sympathy, and this truthful evidence of our love.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the good of his race, just passing from the\r\n     morning of emancipation into the noonday radiance of a liberty of\r\n     which they have dreamed, and for which they have prayed, demands\r\n     that a permanent record be made of this noble man of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministers' meeting adjourned after the reading of the foregoing\r\nresolutions, to attend the funeral services, which were to take place\r\nin Charles Street Church. At an early hour in the morning the body was\r\nplaced in front of the altar in the church of the deceased, where it\r\nlay in state all the forenoon, and where appropriate services were\r\nconducted by Drs. Cheney, Fulton, and others. Thousands, of every\r\ngrade and hue, thronged the church to have a last fond look at the\r\nface so full of sunlight in life, and so peaceful in death.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock the remains were removed to Charles Street Church,\r\nwhere the funeral services were conducted with a feeling of solemnity\r\nand impressiveness worthy of the sad occasion. The addresses of Drs.\r\nNeale and Fulton were fall of tenderness and grief. Both of these\r\ngentlemen were, for many years, the intimate friends of the deceased.\r\nThey were all associated together in a noble work for a number of\r\nyears, and there were no hearts so sad as those of Brothers Neale and\r\nFulton. Clergymen of every denomination were present, and the\r\ncongregation contained men and women from all the walks of life. The\r\nfuneral was considered one of the largest that ever took place in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sabbath quite a number of the Boston pulpits gave\r\nappropriate discourses upon the \"Life and Character of the late L. A.\r\nGrimes.\" The most noticeable were those delivered by Rev. R. N. Neale,\r\nD.D., Rev. Justin D. Fulton, D.D., and Rev. Henry A. Cook.\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade quite a number of educated Colored Baptist\r\nclergymen have come into active work in the denomination. The old-time\r\npreaching is becoming distasteful to the people. The increasing\r\nintelligence of the congregations is an unmistakable warning to the\r\npreachers that a higher standard of preaching is demanded; that the\r\npew is becoming as intelligent as the pulpit. The outlook is very\r\nencouraging. However, the danger of the hour is, that too many Negro\r\nchurches may be organized. We have the quantity; let us _have_ the\r\n_quality_ now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[132] It was our good fortune to be present. We remember distinctly\r\nhis happy face, his words of gratitude and thanks. And as we looked\r\naround every face wore an expression of complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 9.\r\n\r\n_THE DECLINE OF NEGRO GOVERNMENTS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nREACTION, PERIL, AND PACIFICATION.\r\n\r\n1875-1880.\r\n\r\n     THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS AT THE\r\n     SOUTH.--SOUTHERN ELECTION METHODS AND NORTHERN SYMPATHY.--GEN.\r\n     GRANT NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE AND LOSS OF THE REPUBLICAN\r\n     STATE GOVERNMENTS AT THE SOUTH.--A PARTY WITHOUT A LIVE\r\n     ISSUE.--SOUTHERN WAR CLAIMS.--THE CAMPAIGN OF 1876.--REPUBLICAN\r\n     LETHARGY AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIVITY.--DOUBTFUL RESULTS.--THE\r\n     ELECTORAL COUNT IN CONGRESS.--GEN.

The friends of\r\nthe Negro began to congratulate themselves that the Southern problem\r\nhad been solved. Every Legislature in the South had among its members\r\nquite a fair representation of Colored men. Among the State officers\r\nthere was a good sprinkling of them; and in some of the States there\r\nwere Negroes as Lieut.-Governors. Congress had opened its doors to a\r\ndozen Negroes; and the consular and diplomatic service had employed a\r\nnumber of them in foreign parts. And so with such evidences of\r\npolitical prosperity before their eyes the friends of the Negro at the\r\nNorth regarded his \"calling and election sure.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 a great financial panic came to the business and monetary\r\naffairs of the country. It was the logic of an inflated currency, wild\r\nand visionary enterprises, bad investments, and prodigal living. Banks\r\ntottered and fell, large business houses suspended, and financial ruin\r\nran riot. Northern attention was diverted from Southern politics to\r\nthe \"destruction that seemed to waste at noon-day.\" Taking advantage\r\nof this the South seized the shot-gun and wrote on her banners: \"_We\r\nmust carry these States, peaceably if we can; forcibly if we must._\"\r\nAn organized, deliberate policy of political intimidation assumed the\r\ntask of ridding the South of Negro government. The first step was in\r\nthe direction of intimidating the white leaders of the Republican\r\norganizations; and the next was to deny employment to all intelligent\r\nand influential Colored Republicans. Thus from time to time the\r\nleaders of the Republican party were reduced to a very small number.\r\nWithout leaders the rank and file of the party were harmless and\r\nhelpless in State and National campaigns. This state of affairs seemed\r\nto justify the presence of troops at the polls on election days. Under\r\nan Act of Congress \"the President was empowered to use the army to\r\nsuppress domestic violence, prevent bloodshed,\" and to protect the\r\nNegroes in the constitutional exercise of the rights conferred upon\r\nthem by the Constitution. This movement was met by the most determined\r\nopposition from the South, aided by the sympathy of the Northern\r\npress, Democratic platforms, and a considerable element in the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the condition of affairs in the South was such as to alarm the\r\nfriends of stable, constitutional government everywhere. The city of\r\nNew Orleans was in a state of siege. Streets were blockaded with State\r\ntroops and White Line leagues, and an open battle was fought. The\r\nRepublican State government fell before the insurgents, and a new\r\ngovernment was established _vi et armis_. Troops were sent to New\r\nOrleans by the President, and the lawful government was restored. The\r\nLiberal movement in the North, which had resulted in the defeat of the\r\nRepublican tickets in Indiana, Ohio, New York, New Jersey,\r\nConnecticut, and even in Massachusetts, greatly encouraged the Bourbon\r\nDemocrats of the South, and excited them to the verge of the most open\r\nand cruel conduct toward the white and black Republicans in their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\nA large number of Northern Legislatures passed resolutions condemning\r\nthe action of the President in sending troops into the South, although\r\nhe did it in accordance with law. Many active and influential\r\nRepublicans, displeased with the action of the Republican governments\r\nat the South, and the conduct of the Forty-third Congress, demanded\r\nthe destruction of the Republican party. The Liberal movement had\r\nstarted in 1872. Its leaders thought the time had come for a new\r\nparty, and counselled the country accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-fourth Congress was organized by the Democrats. The Cabinet\r\nMinisters were divided on the policy pursued toward the South. In the\r\nautumn of 1875 the shot-gun policy carried Mississippi; and from the\r\n6th of July till the Republican government in that State went down\r\ninto a bloody grave, there was an unbroken series of political\r\nmurders.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant was met by a Democratic Congress; a divided Cabinet:\r\nZachariah Chandler and Edwards Pierrepont were in sympathy with him;\r\nBristow and Jewell represented the Liberal sentiment. Then, the\r\nRepublican party of the North, and many leading journals, were urging\r\na change of policy toward the South. The great majority of Republicans\r\nwanted a change, not because they did not sympathize with the Negro\r\ngovernments, but because they saw some of the best men in the party\r\nwithdrawing their support from the administration of Gen. Grant. There\r\nwere other men who charged that the business failures in the country\r\nwere occasioned by the financial policy of the Republican party, and\r\nin a spirit of desperation were ready to give their support to the\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nIt was charged by the enemies of Gen. Grant that when he was elected\r\nPresident he had a solid Republican South behind him; that under his\r\nadministration everything had been lost; and that he was responsible\r\nfor the political ruin which had overtaken the Republican party at the\r\nSouth. The charge was false. The errors of reconstruction under the\r\nadministration of President Andrew Johnson, and the mistakes of the\r\nmen who had striven to run the State governments at the South had to\r\nbe counteracted by the administration of President Grant. This indeed\r\nwas a difficult task. He did all he could under the Constitution; and\r\nwhen Congress endeavored to pass the Force Bill, the Hon. James G.\r\nBlaine, of Maine, made a speech against it in caucus. Mr. Blaine had a\r\npresidential ambition to serve, and esteemed his own promotion of\r\ngreater moment than the protection of the Colored voters of the\r\nSouth. And Mr. Blaine never allowed an opportunity to pass in which he\r\ndid not throw every obstacle in the way of the success of the Grant\r\nadministration. Mr. Blaine has never seen fit to explain his\r\nopposition to the Force Bill, which was intended to strengthen the\r\nhands of the President in his efforts to protect the Negro voter at\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nWhen the National Republican Convention met at Cincinnati, Ohio, in\r\nthe summer of 1876, there was still lacking a definite policy for the\r\nSouth. Presidential candidates were numerous, and the contest bitter.\r\nGen. Rutherford B. Hayes, at that time Governor of Ohio, was nominated\r\nas a compromise candidate. There was no issue left the Republican\r\nparty, as the \"bloody shirt\" had been rejected by the Liberals, and\r\nwas generally distasteful at the North. But the initial success of the\r\nDemocratic party South, and the loss of many Northern States to the\r\nRepublicans, had emboldened the South to expect national success. But\r\na too precipitous preparation for a raid upon the United States\r\nTreasury for the payment of rebel war claims threw the Republicans\r\nupon their guard, and, for the time being, every other question was\r\nsunk into insignificance. So the insolence of the \"Rebel Brigadier\r\nCongress,\" and the letter of Samuel Jones Tilden, the Democratic\r\ncandidate for the Presidency, on the question of the Southern war\r\nclaims, gave the Republican party a fighting chance. But there were a\r\ndesperate South and a splendid campaign organizer in Mr. Tilden to\r\nmeet. And with a shot-gun policy, tissue ballets, and intimidation at\r\nthe South, while a gigantic, bold, and matchless system of fraudulent\r\nvoting was pushed with vigor in the North, there was little show of\r\nsuccess for the Republican ticket. The contest on the part of the\r\nRepublicans was spiritless. It was difficult to raise funds or excite\r\nenthusiasm. The Republican candidate had only a local reputation. He\r\nhad been to Congress, but even those who had known that had forgotten\r\nit. A modest, retiring man, Gov. Hayes was not widely known. The old\r\nand tried leaders were not enthusiastic. Mr. Blaine had no second\r\nchoice. He was for himself or nobody. The Democrats prosecuted their\r\ncampaign with vigor, intelligence, and enthusiasm. They went \"into the\r\nschool districts,\" and their organization has never been equalled in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe result was doubtful. One thing, however, was sure: the Negro\r\ngovernments of the South were now a thing of the past. Not a single\r\nState was left to the Republican party. Florida, Louisiana, and South\r\nCarolina were hanging by the slender thread of doubt, with the\r\nprovisions of a returning board in favor of the Republican party. The\r\nreturning boards were the creation of local law; their necessity\r\nhaving grown out of the peculiar methods employed by Democrats in\r\ncarrying elections. These boards were empowered to receive and count\r\nthe votes cast for presidential electors; and wherever it could be\r\nproven that intimidation and fraud had been used, the votes of such\r\nprecincts, counties, etc., were to be thrown out. The three doubtful\r\nStates named above were counted for the Republican presidential\r\nelectors. Their work was carried before Congress. A high joint\r\nelectoral commission was created by law, composed of the ablest men of\r\nthe two parties in Congress, with the salt of judicial judgment thrown\r\nin. This commission examined the returns of the three doubtful States,\r\nand decided not to go behind the returns; and, according to a previous\r\nagreement, one branch of Congress ratifying, the candidate having the\r\nmore votes was to be declared duly elected.\r\n\r\nThe country was in an unprecedented state of excitement; and even\r\nEuropean governments felt the shock. The enemies of Republican\r\ngovernment laughed their little laugh, and said that the end of the\r\nrepublic had come. British bankers brought out into the light\r\nConfederate bonds; while stocks in the United States went through an\r\nexperience as variable as the weather in the Mississippi valley. The\r\npublic press was intemperate in its utterances, and the political\r\npassions of the people were inflamed every hour. The national House of\r\nRepresentatives was a vast whirlpool of excitement,--or, rather it was\r\nan angry sea stirred to its depths, and lashing itself into aimless\r\nfury by day and by night. When the vote of a State was called, some\r\nDemocrat would object, and the Senate, which was always present, would\r\nretire, and the House would then open a war of words running through\r\nhours and sometimes days. When the debate ended, or rather when the\r\nHouse had reached the end of its parliamentary halter, the Senate\r\nwould again enter, the vote of the State would be counted, and the\r\nnext one called. Thus the count proceeded through anxious days and\r\nweary nights. Business was suspended; and the bulletin boards of\r\ncommercial 'changes were valueless so long as the bulletin boards of\r\nthe newspapers contained \"the latest news from Washington.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs there was need of statesmen at the head of\r\nthe Republican minority in Congress. There were orators; but the\r\ndemand was for men of judgment, energy, executive ability,--men in\r\nwhom the Democrats had confidence, who could put a stop to\r\nfilibustering, and secure a peaceful solution of a unique and\r\ndangerous problem.\r\n\r\nThese were forthcoming; the late President Garfield and Gov. Foster,\r\nthen a member of Congress, with Kasson, Hale, and other members of\r\nCongress, were among those most active and effective in securing a\r\npeaceful result.\r\n\r\nWhen the electoral fight was on, and the end seemed uncertain, these\r\ngentlemen stepped to the front and fairly won the reputation of\r\nstatesmen. They saw that if the filibustering of the Democrats were\r\nbrought to a close, it would have to be accomplished by the leaders in\r\nthat party and on that side of the House. Accordingly they secured\r\nFernando Wood, of New York, as the leader in opposition to\r\nfilibustering, and John Young Brown, of Kentucky, as his lieutenant.\r\nThe Republican policy was to allow the Democrats to lead and do the\r\ntalking, while they should fall into line and vote when the proper\r\ntime came. But Fernando Wood at the head of the Republicans as a\r\nleader, was a spectacle as strange and startling as Satan leading a\r\nprayer-meeting. It was too much for an orthodox, close-communion,\r\nhard-shell Republican like Martin I. Townsend!\r\n\r\nOn Thursday afternoon, the last day of the alarming scenes in\r\nCongress, nearly everybody had lost hope. There was no telling at what\r\nmoment the government would be in anarchy. In the midst of the\r\nconfusion, excitement, and threatening danger, the Hon. Charles Foster\r\nwas the most imperturbable man in Congress. On Thursday afternoon\r\nSenator Hoar, a member of Congress from Massachusetts, saw Mr. Foster\r\nseated at his desk writing as quietly and composedly as if in his\r\nprivate office; he seemed perfectly oblivious to the angry storm which\r\nwas raging about him. The cold-blooded, conservative New England\r\nSenator was as greatly amazed at the serenity of the clear-headed\r\nWestern Congressman as he was distressed at the impending disaster. He\r\nwent to Mr. Foster and talked very discouragingly respecting the\r\nsituation. He said that the Senate was growing impatient at the\r\ndilatory conduct of the House, and would probably, at the earliest\r\nconvenience, send a message to the House demanding that the latter\r\nopen their doors and admit the Senate to complete the count.\r\nCongressman Foster stated to the Senator that the House was not in a\r\ntemper to be driven; that a resolution of the character of the one\r\nproposed would hinder rather than help a peaceful solution of the\r\nvexatious count; and that if he would only possess his soul in\r\npatience, before the rising of another sun R. B. Hayes would be\r\npeaceably and constitutionally declared the President of the United\r\nStates. And it was even as he said; for before four o'clock the next\r\nmorning the count was completed, and Hayes declared the President of\r\nthe United States for the Constitutional term of four years. This is\r\ngiven as one of the many unwritten incidents that occurred during this\r\nangry, and, probably, most perilous controversy that ever threatened\r\nthe life of the American Republic.\r\n\r\nA new policy for the South was now inevitable. From October 1876 till\r\nMarch 1877, President Grant had refused to recognize Chamberlain as\r\nGovernor of South Carolina, or Packard as Governor of Louisiana. He\r\nhad simply preserved those governments _in statu quo_. He had heard\r\nall that could be said in favor of the Republican side of the\r\nquestion, and seemed to believe that it was now beyond his power to\r\nhold up the last of the Negro governments with bayonets. He was right.\r\nIt would have been as vain to have attempted to galvanize those\r\ngovernments into existence as to have attempted the resuscitation of a\r\ndead man by applying a galvanic battery. Governments must have, not\r\nonly the subjective elements of life, but the powers of\r\nself-preservation. The Negro governments at the South died for the\r\nwant of these elements. It was a pity, too, after the noble fight the\r\nRepublican party of Louisiana and South Carolina had made, and after\r\nthey had secured their electoral votes for Hayes, that their State\r\nofficers who had been chosen at the same time should have been\r\nabandoned to their own frail governmental resources. But this was\r\nunavoidable. Their governments could not have existed twenty-four\r\nhours without the presence and aid of the United States army. And this\r\ncould not have been done in the face of the sentiment against such use\r\nof the army which had grown to be nearly unanimous throughout the\r\ncountry. If the Republicans could have inaugurated their officers and\r\nadministered their governments they would have received the applause\r\nof the administration at Washington and the God-speed of the\r\nRepublican party of the North; but the moment the United States\r\ntroops were withdrawn the Negro governments melted into nothingness.\r\n\r\nEvery thing had been tried but pacification. The men who best\r\nunderstood the temper of that section knew it was incapable, as a\r\nwhole, of receiving the olive branch in the spirit in which the North\r\nwould tender it. But a policy of conciliation was demanded; the\r\nNorthern journals asked it. An ex-Major-General of the Confederate\r\nArmy was called to the Cabinet of President Hayes, and was given a\r\nportfolio where he could do more for the South than in any other\r\nplace. Gen. Longstreet, a gallant Confederate soldier during the late\r\nwar, was made Postmaster at Gainesville, Georgia, and afterward sent\r\nas Minister to Turkey. Col. Mosby, another Confederate soldier, or\r\nguerilla, was sent to China, and Col. Fitzsimmons was made Marshal of\r\nGeorgia. It was the policy of the Hon. Charles Foster to have the\r\nPresident recognize young men at the South who had the pluck and\r\nability to divide the Bourbon Democratic party of that section, and\r\nhasten the day of better feeling between the sections. But the\r\nPresident, either incapable of comprehending this idea, or jealous of\r\nthe credit that the country had already bestowed upon him, blundered\r\non in selecting men to represent his policy in the South who had no\r\nfollowing, and were, therefore, valueless to his cause. His heart was\r\nright, but he put too much confidence in Southern statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe South showed no signs of improvement. White Republicans were\r\nintimidated, persecuted, and driven out. The black Republicans were\r\nallowed to vote, but the Democrats counted the votes and secured all\r\nthe offices. The President was under the influence of Alex. H.\r\nStephens, of Georgia, and Wade Hampton, of South Carolina. He expected\r\nmuch; but he received nothing. Instead of gratitude he received\r\narrogance. The Southern leaders in Congress sought to deprive the\r\nExecutive of his constitutional veto; to starve the army; and to\r\nprotract the session of Congress. The North had invited its \"erring\r\nbrethren\" back, and had killed the fatted calf, but were unwilling to\r\nallow the fellow to eat all the veal! The conduct of the South was\r\ngrowing more intolerable every day; and the President's barren policy\r\nwas losing him supporters. He had not tied to any safe advisers. Hon.\r\nCharles Foster, Senator Stanley Matthews, and Gen. James A. Garfield\r\ncould have piloted him through many dangerous places. But he shut\r\nhimself up in his own abilities, and left his friends on the outside.\r\nThe South had gulped down every thing that had been given it, and was\r\nasking for more. Every thing had been given except the honor of the\r\ncause that the Union army had fought for. To complete the task of\r\nconciliation it was only required that the nation destroy the\r\nmonuments to its hero dead, and open the treasury to the payment of\r\nrebel war claims, and pension the men who were maimed in an attempt to\r\nshoot the government to death. To the credit of President Hayes let\r\nhistory record that he did not surrender his veto power to arrogant\r\nand disloyal Southern Congressmen. He became convinced at last that\r\nthe South was incapable of appreciating his kindness, and was willing\r\nto change front. His policy was inevitable. It did great good. It\r\nunited the Republican party against the South; and a splendid cabinet,\r\na clean administration, and the resumption of specie payments wrought\r\nwonders for the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThere was a ripe sentiment in the North in favor of \"a change\" of\r\npolicy. The very men who had advocated pacification; who had \"flowers\r\nand tears for the Gray, and tears and flowers for the Blue\"; who\r\nwanted the grave of Judas equally honored with the grave of Jesus--the\r\ndestroyer and the Saviour of the country placed in the same\r\ncalendar;--were the first men to grow sick of the policy of\r\npacification. But what policy to inaugurate was not clear to them.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1878 the Hon. Charles Foster returned to Ohio from\r\nWashington City. He had seen State governments in the North slip from\r\nthe control of Republicans, because of the folly of the Hayes' policy\r\nof pacification toward the South. He had the good-sense to take in the\r\nsituation. He saw that it was madness to attempt any longer to\r\nconciliate the South. He saw that the lamb and lion had lain down\r\ntogether, but that the lamb was on the inside of the lion. Brave,\r\nintelligent, and far-seeing, on the 1st of August, 1878, he gave the\r\nRepublican party of the North a battle-cry that died away only amid\r\nthe shouts of Republican State and National victories in 1880. This\r\nwas all the North needed. A leader was demanded, and the Hon. Charles\r\nFoster sounded the key-note that met with a response in every loyal\r\nheart in the country. His idea was that as the South had not kept the\r\nfaith; had not accorded protection to the Negro voter; had not broken\r\nup old Bourbon Democratic organizations, it was the imperative duty\r\nof the North to meet that section with a solid front. Hence his\r\nbattle-cry: \"_A Solid North against a Solid South._\" The following is\r\nhis famous speech--pure gold:\r\n\r\n     \"I happened to be one who thought and believed that the\r\n     President's Southern policy, as far as it related to the use of\r\n     troops for the support of State governments, was right. I\r\n     sustained it upon the ground of high principle, nevertheless it\r\n     could have been sustained on the ground of necessity. The\r\n     President has extended to the people of the South the hand of\r\n     conciliation and friendship. He has shown a desire, probably\r\n     contrary to the wishes of the great mass of his party, to bring\r\n     about, by the means of conciliation, better relations between the\r\n     North and South. In doing this he has alienated from him the\r\n     great mass of the leading and influential Republicans of the\r\n     country. He had lost their sympathy, and to a great degree their\r\n     support. What has he received in return for these measures of\r\n     conciliation and kindness? How have these measures been received\r\n     by the South? What advance can we discover in them, of the\r\n     recognition of the guarantees of the rights of the Colored men\r\n     under the Constitutional Amendments? We see Jeff. Davis making\r\n     speeches as treasonable as those of 1861, and these speeches\r\n     endorsed and applauded by a great portion of their press and\r\n     people. We see also the declaration of Mr. Singleton, of\r\n     Mississippi, in answer to a question of mine on the floor of the\r\n     House, declaring that his paramount allegiance in peace and war\r\n     was due to his State.\r\n\r\n     \"No gentleman from the South, or even of the Democratic party,\r\n     has taken issue with him. We see also, all over the South, a\r\n     disposition to resist the execution of the United States laws,\r\n     especially in the matter of the collection of internal revenue.\r\n     To-day there are four U. S. officers under arrest by the\r\n     authorities of the State of South Carolina, in jail and bail\r\n     refused, for an alleged crime in their State, while in fact these\r\n     officers were discharging their duty in executing the laws of the\r\n     United States in that State. Their State courts and their\r\n     officers refused to obey the writs of the United States courts in\r\n     the surrender of these men to the United States authorities. No\r\n     former act of this treasonable State shows a more defiant\r\n     attitude toward the U. S. Government, or a greater disposition to\r\n     trample upon its authority. I trust the Administration will, in\r\n     this case, assert in the most vigorous manner possible the\r\n     authority of the United States Government for the rescue and\r\n     protection of these officers. I have no bloody shirt to wave. If\r\n     there is one man in this country, more than another, who desires\r\n     peace and quiet between the sections, I believe I am that man.\r\n     Gentlemen may philosophize over this question until they are\r\n     gray, but you cannot escape the discussion of this question so\r\n     long as a Solid South menaces the peace of the country. A Solid\r\n     Democratic South means the control of the country by the spirit\r\n     and the men who sought its destruction.\r\n\r\n     \"My own opinion is that there can be no peace--this question will\r\n     not down, until the menace of the Solid South is withdrawn. I had\r\n     hoped that the policy of President Hayes would lead to the\r\n     assertion, by a very considerable portion of the South, of their\r\n     antagonism to Bourbon Democracy.\r\n\r\n     \"I confess to a degree of disappointment in this, though I think\r\n     I see signs of a breaking up of the Solid South in the\r\n     independent movement that seemed to be gaining a foothold in all\r\n     sections of that country. But the effective way to aid these\r\n     independent movements, this breaking up of the Solid South, is\r\n     for the North to present itself united against the Solid South. A\r\n     Solid South under the control of the Democratic party means the\r\n     control of the party by this element. It means the repeal of the\r\n     Constitutional Amendments, if not in form, in spirit. It means\r\n     the payment of hundreds of rebel claims. It means the payment of\r\n     pensions to rebel soldiers. It means the payment for slaves lost\r\n     in the Rebellion. It means the abrogation of that provision of\r\n     the Constitution which declares, that the citizens of one State\r\n     shall have all the rights, privileges, and immunities of the\r\n     citizens of other States.\r\n\r\n     \"If my Democratic friends who seem to be anxious to bring about\r\n     peace and quiet between the sections are sincere and desire to\r\n     make their expressions effective, they should act with that party\r\n     that presents a solid front, a United North, so long as we are\r\n     menaced with the Solid South.\r\n\r\n     \"If it could be understood in the South that they are to be met\r\n     with a Solid North, I do not believe that the Solid South would\r\n     exist in that condition a single year. They retain this position\r\n     because they believe that they can have the support of a fragment\r\n     of the North; and thus with this fragment rule and control the\r\n     country. I would have no fear of the control of the country by\r\n     the Democratic party if it were made up of something like equal\r\n     proportion from all sections of the country. I discuss this\r\n     question, first, because I believe it the most important question\r\n     at issue in the pending canvass. _I repeat that it is the\r\n     imperative duty of the North to meet the Solid South with a\r\n     united front._\"[133]\r\n\r\nThis speech was delivered at Upper Sandusky, Wyandotte Co., Ohio. It\r\nthrilled the North, and put new life into the Republican party. It\r\ngave him the nomination for governor, and from 23,000 Democratic\r\nmajority he redeemed the State by a Republican majority of 17,000. A\r\nwave of enthusiasm swept the country. His battle-cry became the\r\neditorial of a thousand journals, and hundreds of orators found\r\nammunition enough in his little speech of a hundred lines to keep up a\r\ncampaign of two years' duration. It is a fact that history should not\r\nomit to record, that from the 1st of August, 1878, until the election\r\nof James A. Garfield to the presidency, there was no cessation to the\r\ncampaign in the North.\r\n\r\nBut the securing of a Solid North did not restore the Negro\r\ngovernments at the South. The North had rallied to rebuke an insolent\r\nSouth; to show the Democrats of that section that the United States\r\nTreasury should be protected, and that the honor of the nation _would_\r\nbe maintained unsullied. If the South would not pay its honest debts\r\nthere was every reason for believing that it would not pay the\r\nnational debt. It was to be regretted that the Negro had been so\r\nunceremoniously removed from Southern politics. But such a result was\r\ninevitable. The Government gave him the statute-book when he ought to\r\nhave had the spelling-book; placed him in the Legislature when he\r\nought to have been in the school-house. In the great revolution that\r\nfollowed the war, the heels were put where the brains ought to have\r\nbeen. An ignorant majority, without competent leaders, could not rule\r\nan intelligent Caucasian minority. Ignorance, vice, poverty, and\r\nsuperstition could not rule intelligence, experience, wealth, and\r\norganization. It was here that the \"one could chase a thousand, and\r\nthe two could put ten thousand to flight.\" The Negro governments were\r\nbuilt on the shifting sands of the opinions of the men who\r\nreconstructed the South, and when the storm and rains of political\r\ncontest came they fell because they were not built upon the granite\r\nfoundation of intelligence and statesmanship.\r\n\r\nIt was an immutable and inexorable law which demanded the destruction\r\nof those governments. It was a law that knows no country, no\r\nnationality. Spain, Mexico, France, Turkey, Russia, and Egypt have\r\nfelt its cruel touch to a greater or less degree. But a lesson was\r\ntaught the Colored people that is invaluable. Let _them_ rejoice that\r\nthey are out of politics. Let white men rule. Let them enjoy a\r\npolitical life to the exclusion of business and education, and they\r\ntoo will sooner or later be driven out of their places by the same law\r\nthat sent the Negro to the plantations and to the schools. And if the\r\nNegro is industrious, frugal, saving, diligent in labor, and laborious\r\nin study, there is another law that will quietly and peaceably,\r\nwithout a social or political shock, restore him to his normal\r\nrelations in politics. He will be able to build his governments on a\r\nsolid foundation, with the tempered mortar of experience and\r\nknowledge. This is inevitable. The Negro will return to politics in\r\nthe South when he is qualified to govern; will return to stay. He will\r\nbe respected, courted and protected then. Then as a tax-payer, as well\r\nas a tax-gatherer, reading his own ballot, and choosing his own\r\ncandidates, he will be equal to all the exigencies of American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] Cincinnati Commercial, Aug. 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXODUS--CAUSE AND EFFECT.\r\n\r\n     THE NEGROES OF THE SOUTH DELIGHT IN THEIR HOME SO LONG AS IT IS\r\n     POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO REMAIN.--THE POLICY OF ABRIDGING THEIR\r\n     RIGHTS DESTRUCTIVE TO THEIR USEFULNESS AS MEMBERS OF\r\n     SOCIETY.--POLITICAL INTIMIDATION, MURDER, AND OUTRAGE DISTURB THE\r\n     NEGROES.--THE PLANTATION CREDIT SYSTEM THE CRIME OF THE\r\n     CENTURY.--THE EXODUS NOT INSPIRED BY POLITICIANS, BUT THE NATURAL\r\n     OUTCOME OF THE BARBAROUS TREATMENT BESTOWED UPON THE NEGROES BY\r\n     THE WHITES.--THE UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERINGS OF 60,000 NEGROES\r\n     FLEEING FROM SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC OPPRESSION.--THEIR PATIENT,\r\n     CHRISTIAN ENDURANCE.--THEIR INDUSTRY, MORALS, AND FRUGALITY.--THE\r\n     CORRESPONDENT OF THE \"CHICAGO INTER-OCEAN\" SENDS INFORMATION TO\r\n     SENATOR VOORHEES RESPECTING THE REFUGEES IN KANSAS.--THE POSITION\r\n     OF GOV.

COMSTOCK.--THE\r\n     RESULTS OF THE EXODUS BENEFICENT.--THE SOUTH MUST TREAT THE NEGRO\r\n     BETTER OR LOSE HIS LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exodus of the Negroes from Southern States forms one of the most\r\ninteresting pages of the almost romantic history of the race. It\r\nrequired more than ordinary causes to drive the Negro from his home in\r\nthe sunny South to a different climate and strange country. It was no\r\ncaprice of his nature, nor even a nomadic feeling. During the entire\r\nperiod of the existence of the Republican governments at the South the\r\nNegroes remained there in a state of blissful contentment. And even\r\nafter the fall of those governments they continued in a state of quiet\r\nindustry. But there followed the decline of those governments a policy\r\nas hurtful to the South as it was cruel to the Negroes.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of reconstruction quite a number of Negroes\r\nbegan to invest in real estate and secure for themselves pleasant\r\nhomes. Their possessions increased yearly, as can be seen by a\r\nreference to statistical reports. Some of the estates and homesteads\r\nof the oldest and most reputable white families, who had put every\r\nthing info the scales of Confederate rebellion, fell into the\r\npossession of ex-slaves. Such a spectacle was not only unpleasant, it\r\nwas exasperating, to the whites. But so long as the Republican\r\ngovernments gave promise of success there was but little or no\r\nmanifestation of displeasure on the part of the whites. Just as soon,\r\nhowever, as they became the masters of the situation, the property of\r\nmany Negroes was seized, and sold upon the specious plea--\"for\r\ndelinquent taxes\"; and the Negroes were driven from eligible places to\r\nthe outskirts of the larger towns and cities. No Negro was allowed to\r\nlive in the vicinity of white persons as tenants; and it became a\r\nsocial crime to sell property to Negroes in close proximity to the\r\nwhites. In the rural districts, where Negroes had begun to secure\r\nsmall farms, this same cruel spirit was \"the lion in their way.\" The\r\nspirit that sought to keep the Negro ignorant as a slave, now that he\r\nwas at least nominally free, endeavored to deprive him of one of the\r\nnecessary conditions of happy and useful citizenship: the possession\r\nof property, the aggregations of the results of honest labor. Nothing\r\ncould have been more fatal to the growth of the Negro toward the\r\nperfect stature of free, intelligent, independent, and self-sustaining\r\nmanhood and citizenship. The object and result of such a system can\r\neasily be judged. It was intended to keep the Negroes the laboring\r\nelement after as well as before the war. The accomplishment of such a\r\nresult would have been an argument in favor of the assertion of the\r\nSouth that the normal condition of the Negro was that of a serf; and\r\nthat he, did not possess the elements necessary to the life of a\r\nfreeman. Thus would have perished the hopes, prayers, arguments and\r\nclaims of the friends of the cause of universal, manhood suffrage.\r\n\r\nAmong the masses of laboring men the iniquitous, outrageous, thieving\r\n\"_Plantation Credit System_\" was a plague and a crime. Deprived of\r\nhomes and property the Negroes were compelled to \"work the crops on\r\nthe shares.\" A plantation store was kept where the Negroes' credit was\r\ngood for any article it contained. He got salt meat, corn meal, sugar,\r\ncoffee, molasses, vinegar, tobacco, and coarse clothing for himself\r\nand family. An account was kept by \"a young white man,\" and at the end\r\nof the season \"a reckoning\" was had. Unable to read or cipher, the\r\npoor, credulous, unsuspecting Negroes always found themselves in debt\r\nfrom $50 to $200! This necessitated another year's engagement; and so\r\non for an indefinite period. There was nothing to encourage the\r\nNegroes; nothing to inspire them with hope for the future; nothing for\r\ntheir families but a languid, dead-eyed expectation that somehow a\r\nchange _might_ come. But the crime went on unrebuked by the men who\r\nwere growing rich from this system of petty robbery of the poor. For\r\nthe cheapest qualities of brown sugar, for which the laboring classes\r\nof the North pay 8 cents, the Negroes on the plantations were charged\r\n11 and 13 cents a pound. Corn meal purchased at the North for 4 cents\r\na quart, brought 9 and 10 cents at the plantation store. And thus for\r\nevery article the Negroes purchased they were charged the most\r\nexorbitant prices.\r\n\r\nThere were two results which flowed from this system, viz.: robbing\r\nthe families of these Negroes of the barest comforts of life, and\r\ndestroying the confidence of the Negro in the blessings and benefits\r\nof freedom. No man--no race of men--could endure such blighting\r\ninfluences for any length of time.\r\n\r\nMoreover the experiences of the Negroes in voting had not been\r\nextensive, and a sudden curtailing and abridgment of their rights was\r\na shock to their confidence in the government under which they lived,\r\nand in the people by which they were surrounded. It was thought\r\nexpedient to intimidate or destroy the more intelligent and determined\r\nNegroes; while the farm laborers were directed to refrain from voting\r\nthe Republican ticket, or commanded to vote the Democratic ticket, or\r\nstarve. There never was a more cruel system of slavery than this.\r\n\r\nWriting under date of January 10, 1875, General P. H. Sheridan, then\r\nin command at New Orleans, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Since the year 1866 nearly thirty-five hundred persons, a great\r\n     majority of whom were colored men, have been killed and wounded\r\n     in this State. In 1868 the official record shows that eighteen\r\n     hundred and eighty-four were killed and wounded. From 1868 to the\r\n     present time no official investigation had been made, and the\r\n     civil authorities in all but a few cases have been unable to\r\n     arrest, convict, or punish the perpetrators. Consequently there\r\n     are no correct records to be consulted for information. There is\r\n     ample evidence, however, to show that more than twelve hundred\r\n     persons have been killed and wounded during this time on account\r\n     of their political sentiments. Frightful massacres have occurred\r\n     in the parishes of Bossier, Caddo, Catahoula, Saint Bernard,\r\n     Grant, and Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to enumerate the political murders of Colored men in\r\nvarious parishes, and says:\r\n\r\n     \"Human life in this State is held so cheaply that when men are\r\n     killed on account of political opinions, the murderers are\r\n     regarded rather as heroes than as criminals in the localities\r\n     where they reside.\"\r\n\r\nThis brief summary is not by a politician, but by a distinguished\r\nsoldier, who recounts the events which had occurred within his own\r\nmilitary jurisdiction. Volumes of testimony have since been taken\r\nconfirming in all respects General Sheridan's statement, and giving in\r\ndetail the facts relating to such murders, and the times and\r\ncircumstances of their occurrence. The results of the elections which\r\nimmediately followed them disclose the motives and purposes of their\r\nperpetrators. These reports show that in the year 1867 a reign of\r\nterror prevailed over almost the entire State. In the parish of St.\r\nLandry there was a massacre of Colored people which began on the 28th\r\nof September, 1868, and lasted from three to six days, during which\r\ntime between three and four hundred of them were killed. \"Thirteen\r\ncaptives were taken from the jail and shot, and a pile of twenty-five\r\ndead bodies were found burned in the woods.\" The result of this\r\nDemocratic campaign in the parish was that the registered Republican\r\nmajority of 1,071 was wholly obliterated, and at the election which\r\nfollowed a few weeks later, not a vote was cast for General Grant,\r\nwhile Seymour and Blair received 4,787.\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Bossier a similar massacre occurred between the 20th\r\nand 30th of September, 1868, which lasted from three to four days,\r\nduring which time two hundred Negroes were killed. By the official\r\nregistry of that year the Republican voters in Bossier Parish numbered\r\n1,938, but at the ensuing election only _one_ Republican vote was\r\ncast.\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Caddo, during the month of October, 1868, over forty\r\nNegroes were killed. The result of that massacre was that out of a\r\nRepublican registered vote of 2,894 only _one_ was cast for General\r\nGrant. Similar scenes were enacted throughout the State, varying in\r\nextent and atrocity according to the magnitude of the Republican\r\nmajority to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe total summing up of murders, maimings, and whippings which took\r\nplace for political reasons in the months of September, October, and\r\nNovember, 1868, as shown by official sources, is over one thousand.\r\nThe net political results achieved thereby may be succinctly stated as\r\nfollows: The official registration for that year in twenty-eight\r\nparishes contained 47,923 names of Republican voters, but at the\r\npresidential election held a few weeks after the occurrence of these\r\nevents but 5,360 Republican votes were cast, making the net Democratic\r\ngain from said transactions 42,563.\r\n\r\nIn nine of these parishes where the reign of terror was most\r\nprevalent, out of 11,604 registered Republican votes only nineteen\r\nwere cast for General Grant. In seven of said parishes there were\r\n7,253 registered Republican votes, but not one was cast at the ensuing\r\nelection for the Republican ticket.\r\n\r\nIn the years succeeding 1868, when some restraint was imposed upon\r\npolitical lawlessness and a comparatively peaceful election was held,\r\nthese same Republican parishes cast from 33,000 to 37,000 Republican\r\nvotes, thus demonstrating the purpose and the effects of the reign of\r\nmurder in 1868.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the spirit of violence and persecution which, in parts of the\r\nState, had been partially restrained for a time, broke forth again\r\nwith renewed fury. It was deemed necessary to carry that State for\r\nTilden and Hendricks, and the policy which had proved so successful in\r\n1868 was again invoked, and with like results. On the day of general\r\nelection in 1876 there were in the State of Louisiana 92,996\r\nregistered white voters, and 115,310 Colored, making a Republican\r\nmajority of the latter of 22,314. The number of white Republicans was\r\nfar in excess of the number of Colored Democrats. It was, therefore,\r\nwell known that if a fair election should be held the State would go\r\nRepublican by from twenty-five to forty thousand majority. The policy\r\nadopted this time was to select a few of the largest Republican\r\nparishes and by terrorism and violence not only obliterate their\r\nRepublican majorities, but also intimidate the Negroes in the other\r\nparishes. The sworn testimony found in our public documents and\r\nrecords at Washington shows that the same system of assassinations,\r\nwhippings, burnings, and other acts of political persecution of\r\nColored citizens, which had occurred in 1868, was again repeated in\r\n1876, and with like results.\r\n\r\nIn fifteen parishes where 17,726 Republicans were registered in 1876\r\nonly 5,758 votes were cast for Hayes and Wheeler, and in one of them\r\n(East Feliciana) where there were 2,127 Republicans registered, but\r\n_one_ Republican vote was cast. By some methods the Republican\r\nmajority of the State was supposed to have been effectually suppressed\r\nand a Democratic victory assured. And because the legally constituted\r\nauthorities of Louisiana, acting in conformity with law and justice,\r\ndeclined to count some of the parishes thus carried by violence and\r\nblood, the Democratic party, both North and South, has ever since\r\ncomplained that it was fraudulently deprived of the fruits of the\r\nvictory thus achieved, and it now proposes to make this grievance the\r\nprincipal plank in the party platform[134] for the future.\r\n\r\nThe worm trampled upon so persistently at length turned over. There\r\nwas nothing left to the Negro but to go out from the land of his\r\noppression and task-masters.\r\n\r\nThe Exodus was not a political movement. It was not inspired from\r\nwithout. It was but the natural operation of a divine law that moved\r\nwhole communities of Negroes to turn their faces toward the setting\r\nsun. When the Israelites went out of Egypt God commanded their women\r\nto borrow the finger-rings and ear-rings of the Egyptians. All had\r\nsandals on their feet, staves in their hand, and headed by a matchless\r\nleader. God went before them as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar\r\nof fire by night. But when the Negroes began their exodus from the\r\nEgypt of their bondage they went out empty; without clothing, money,\r\nor leaders. They were willing to endure any hardships short of death\r\nto reach a land where, under their own vine and fig-tree, they could\r\nenjoy free speech, free schools, the privilege of an honest vote, and\r\nreceive honest pay for honest work. And how forcibly they told why\r\nthey left the South.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, old Uncle Joe, what did you come for?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, law! Missus, I follers my two boys an' the ole woman an'\r\n     then 'pears like I wants a taste of votin' afore I dies, an' the\r\n     ole man done wants no swamps to wade in afore he votes, 'kase he\r\n     must be Republican, ye see.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well, old Aunty, give us the sympathetic side of the story; or,\r\n     tell us what you think of leaving your old home.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I done have no home nohow, if they shoots my ole man an' the\r\n     boys, an' gives me no money for de washin.\"\r\n\r\nA bright woman of twenty-five years is asked her condition, when she\r\nanswers; \"I had n't much real trouble yet, like some of my neighbors\r\nwho lost every thing. We had a lot an' a little house, an' some stock\r\non the place. We sold all out 'kase we did n't dare to stay when\r\nvotin' time came again. Some neighbors better off than we had been all\r\nbroken up by a pack of \"_night-riders_\"--all in white,--who scared\r\neverybody to death, run the men off to the swamps before elections,\r\nrun the stock off, an' set fire to their places. A poor woman might\r\nas well be killed and done with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early Spring of 1879, the now famous Exodus of the Negroes from\r\nthe South set in toward the Northern States.\r\n\r\n     \"Many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts,\r\n     Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of the morrow. Arms\r\n     have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;\r\n     Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the\r\n     mower.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the emigration of a people has been often repeated since\r\nthe world began. The Israelites of old, with their wanderings of forty\r\nyears, furnish the theme of an inspired poem as old as history itself.\r\nThe dreadful tale of the Kalmuck Tartars, in 1770, fleeing from their\r\nenemies, the Russians, over the desolate steppes of Asia in\r\nmid-winter; starting out six hundred thousand strong, men, women, and\r\nchildren, with their flocks and herds, and reaching the confines of\r\nChina with only two hundred thousand left, formed an era in oriental\r\nannals, and made a combination from which new races of men have\r\nsprung. But still more appropriate to this occasion is the history of\r\nthe Huguenots of France, driven by religious persecution to England\r\nand Ireland, where, under their influence, industries sprang up as the\r\nflowers of the field, and what was England's gain was irreparable loss\r\nto France.[135] The expulsion of the Acadians, a harmless and\r\ninoffensive people, from Nova Scotia, is another instance of the\r\nrevenge that natural laws inflict upon tyranny and injustice. Next to\r\nthe persecuted Pilgrims crossing a dreary ocean in mid-winter to the\r\nsterile coasts of a land of savages for freedom's sake, history hardly\r\nfurnishes a more touching picture than that of forty thousand\r\nhomeless, friendless, starving Negroes going to a land already\r\nconsecrated with the blood of the martyrs to the cause of free Soil\r\nand unrestricted liberty. It was grandly strange that these poor\r\npeople, persecuted, beaten with many stripes, hungry, friendless, and\r\nwithout clothing or shelter, should instinctively seek a home in\r\nKansas where John Brown had fought the first battle for liberty and\r\nthe restriction of slavery! Some journeyed all the way from Texas to\r\nKansas in teams, with great horned oxen, and little steers in front no\r\nlarger than calves, bowing eagerly to the weary load. Worn and weary\r\nwith a nine weeks' journey, the travellers strained their eyes toward\r\nthe land of hope, blindly yet beautifully \"trustin' de good Lord.\"\r\nOften they buried their dead as soon as they arrived, many dying on\r\nthe hard floor of the hastily-built wooden barracks before beds could\r\nbe provided, but praying all night long and saying touchingly: \"Come,\r\nLord Jesus. Come quickly. Come with dyin' grace in one hand and savin'\r\nlove in the other.\"[136]\r\n\r\nA relief association was organized at once. A dear, good, old Quaker\r\nlady, in her sixty-fourth year, a quarter of a century of which had\r\nbeen spent in relieving suffering humanity, came forward and offered\r\nher services free of charge. The association was organized as _The\r\nKansas Freedmen's Relief Association_. Mrs. Comstock was just the\r\nperson to manage the matter of raising funds and securing clothing. In\r\nGov. J. P. St. John, Mrs. Comstock and the association found a\r\nwarm-hearted Christian friend.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the plain, world-known causes, the Hon. D. W.\r\nVoorhees, United States Senator from Indiana, introduced a resolution\r\nproviding for the investigation of \"_the causes of the migration of\r\nthe Colored people from the Southern to the Northern States_.\" It cost\r\nthe Government thousands of dollars, but developed nothing save what\r\nthe country had known for years, that the political cruelties and\r\nsystematic robbery practised upon the Colored people in the South had\r\nforced them into a free country.\r\n\r\nIn one year those who had taken up a residence in Kansas had become\r\nself-sustaining. They took hold of the work with enthusiasm; they\r\nproved themselves industrious and frugal.\r\n\r\nThe Relief Association at first supplied them with stoves, teams, and\r\nseed. In round numbers, in a little more than a year, $40,000 was\r\nused, and 500,000 pounds of clothing, bedding, etc. England\r\ncontributed 50,000 pounds of goods and $8,000 in money; the chief\r\ngivers being Mrs. Comstock's friends who knew her in her good work\r\nabroad. Much of the remainder had come in small sums, and from the\r\nChristian women of America. One third was furnished by the Society of\r\nFriends. Ohio gave more than any other State. The State and municipal\r\nfunds of Kansas were not drawn upon at all, though much had come from\r\nprivate sources.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year in Kansas, the freedmen entered upon 20,000\r\nacres of land, and plowed and fitted for grain-growing 3,000 acres.\r\nThey built 300 cabins and dugouts, and accumulated $30,000. In 1878\r\nHenry Carter, of Tennessee, set out from Topeka on foot for Dunlap,\r\nsixty-five miles away; he carrying his tools, and his wife their\r\nbedclothes. In 1880 he had forty acres of land cleared and the first\r\npayment made, having earned his money on sheep ranches and elsewhere\r\nby daily labor. He has built a good stone cottage sixteen feet by ten,\r\nowns two cows, a horse, etc. In Topeka, where there were about 3,000\r\nrefugees, nearly all paupers when they came, all have found means in\r\nsome way to make a living. These people have shown themselves worthy\r\nof aid. Mrs. Comstock has heard of only five or six cases of\r\nintoxication in nine months, and of no arrests for stealing. They do\r\nnot want to settle where there is no church, and are all eager to have\r\na Bible and to learn. Schools have been opened for the adults--the\r\npublic schools of Kansas wisely making no distinction on account of\r\ncolor,--and also industrial schools, especially for women, who are\r\nquite ignorant of the ordinary duties of home life.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, 1880, John M. Brown, Esq., General\r\nSuperintendent of the Freedmen's Relief Association read an\r\ninteresting report before the Association, from which the following\r\nextract is taken:\r\n\r\n     \"The great exodus of Colored people from the South began about\r\n     the 1st of February, 1879. By the 1st of April 1,300 refugees had\r\n     gathered around Wyandotte, Ks. Many of them were in a suffering\r\n     condition. It was then that the Kansas Relief Association came\r\n     into existence for the purpose of helping the most needy among\r\n     the refugees from the Southern States. Up to date about 60,000\r\n     refugees have come to the State of Kansas to live. Nearly 40,000\r\n     of them were in a destitute condition when they arrived, and have\r\n     been helped by our association. We have received to date $68,000\r\n     for the relief of the refugees. About 5,000 of those who have\r\n     come to Kansas have gone to other States to live, leaving about\r\n     55,000 yet in Kansas. About 30,000 of that number have settled in\r\n     the country, some of them on lands of their own or rented lands;\r\n     others have hired out to the farmers, leaving about 25,000 in and\r\n     around the different cities and towns of Kansas. There has been\r\n     great suffering among those remaining in and near the cities and\r\n     towns this winter. It has been so cold that they could not find\r\n     employment, and, if they did, they had to work for very low\r\n     wages, because so many of them are looking for work that they are\r\n     in each other's way.\r\n\r\n     \"Most of those about the cities and towns are men with large\r\n     families, widows, and very old people. The farmers want only\r\n     able-bodied men and women for their work, and it is very hard for\r\n     men with large families to get homes among the farmers. Kansas\r\n     is a new State, and most farmers have small houses, and they\r\n     cannot take large families to live with them. So, when the\r\n     farmers call for help, they usually call for a man and his wife\r\n     only, or for a single man or woman.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, in order that men with large families may become owners of\r\n     land, and be able to support their families, the K. F. R.\r\n     Association, if they can secure the means, will purchase cheap\r\n     lands, which can be bought at from $3 to $5 per acre, on long\r\n     time, by making a small payment in cash. They will settle the\r\n     refugees on those lands, letting each family have from twenty to\r\n     forty acres, and not settling more than sixteen families in\r\n     anyone neighborhood, so that they can easily obtain work from the\r\n     farmers in that section or near by. I do not think it best to\r\n     settle too many of them in any one place, because it will make it\r\n     hard for them to find employment.\r\n\r\n     \"If our association can help them to build a small house, and\r\n     have five acres of their land broken, the women and children can\r\n     cultivate the five acres, and make enough to support their\r\n     families, while the men are out at work by the day to earn money\r\n     to meet the payments on their land as they come due. In this way\r\n     many families can be helped to homes of their own, where they can\r\n     become self-sustaining, educate their children, and be useful\r\n     citizens to the State of Kansas.\r\n\r\n     \"Money spent in this way will be much more profitable to them\r\n     than so much old clothing and provisions. Then they will no\r\n     longer be objects of charity or a burden to benevolent people.\"\r\n\r\nThe sad stories of this persecuted people had touched the hearts of\r\nthe friends of humanity everywhere. Money and clothing came on every\r\ntrain, and as fast as the association could secure homes for the\r\nrefugees they were distributed throughout the State.[137]\r\n\r\nA special correspondent of the \"Chicago Inter-Ocean\" was despatched to\r\nTopeka to report the condition of things there, and to throw some\r\nlight upon the great intellect of Senator Voorhees. He reported as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"TOPEKA, KAN., April 9.--During the last few days I have, in\r\n     obedience to your request, been taking notice of the exodus, as\r\n     it may be studied here at the headquarters for relief among the\r\n     refugees in Kansas. This is the third visit your correspondent\r\n     has made to the 'promised land' of the dusky hosts who, fleeing\r\n     from persecution and wrongs, have swarmed within its borders to\r\n     the number of 25,000. In a letter written while here in December\r\n     last the number then within the State was estimated at about\r\n     15,000, and since that date at least 12,000 more have come. In\r\n     the 'barracks' to-day I found what seemed to be the same one\r\n     hundred * * * who crowded about the stove that cold December day;\r\n     but they were not the same, of course, for their places have been\r\n     filled many times with other hundreds, who have found their first\r\n     welcome to Kansas in the rest, food, and warmth which the charity\r\n     of the North has provided here. So efficient have the plan of\r\n     relief and the machinery of distribution been made, that of the\r\n     thousands who have passed through here, none have remained as a\r\n     burden of expense to the association more than four or five days\r\n     before places were found where their own labor could furnish them\r\n     support.\r\n\r\n     \"If that pure statesman of Indiana whose great heart was so\r\n     filled with solicitude for the welfare of his colored brethren,\r\n     that he asked Congress to appropriate thousands of dollars to\r\n     ascertain why they moved from one State to another, will come\r\n     here he will be rewarded by such a flood of light on the question\r\n     as can never penetrate the recesses of his committee room in\r\n     Washington. He need hardly propound an inquiry; he had, indeed,\r\n     best not let his great presence be known, for in the presence of\r\n     Democracy the negro has learned to keep silence. But in search of\r\n     the truth let him go to the file of over 3,000 letters in the\r\n     Governor's office from negroes in the South, and read in them the\r\n     homely but truthful tales of suffering, oppression, and wrongs.\r\n     Let him note how real is their complaint, but how modest the boon\r\n     they seek; for in different words, sometimes in quaint and often\r\n     in awkward phrases, the questions are always the same: Can we be\r\n     free? Can we have work, and can we have our rights in Kansas? Let\r\n     him go next to the barracks and watch the tired, ragged, hungry,\r\n     scared-looking negroes as they come by the dozens on every train.\r\n     If he is not prompted by shame, then from caution necessary to\r\n     the success of his errand, let him here conceal the fact that he\r\n     is a Democrat, for these half-famished and terrified negroes have\r\n     been fleeing from Democrats in the South, and in their ignorance\r\n     they may not be able to comprehend the nice distinction between a\r\n     Northern and Southern Democrat. If he will be content simply to\r\n     listen as they talk among themselves, he will soon learn much\r\n     that the laborious cross-examination of witnesses has failed to\r\n     teach him. He may take note of the fact that fleeing from\r\n     robbery, oppression, and murder, they come only with the plea for\r\n     work and justice while they work. He may see reason to criticise\r\n     what generally has been deemed by Southern Democrats at least,\r\n     the unreasonable folly in a negro which prompts husband and wife\r\n     to go only where they can go together, but he will find nothing\r\n     to cause him to doubt the sincerity and good faith with which the\r\n     negro grapples with the problem of his new life here. If he would\r\n     learn more of this strength of resolution and the patience which\r\n     they have brought to the search for a home in a free land, let\r\n     him inquire concerning the lives of these refugees in Kansas. It\r\n     may seem of significance and worthy of approving note to him,\r\n     that as laborers they have been faithful and industrious; that in\r\n     no single case have they come back asking aid of the relief\r\n     association nor become burdens in any way upon corporate or\r\n     public charities; that as citizens they are sober and law-abiding\r\n     to such a degree that he would hardly be able to discover a\r\n     single case of crime so far among them; and, finally, that in\r\n     those instances where they were able to purchase a little land\r\n     and stock, they have made as good progress toward the acquirement\r\n     of homes and property as have the average poor white immigrants\r\n     to the State. He will first learn, then, from the refugees\r\n     themselves something of the desperate nature of the causes that\r\n     drove them from the South, and secondly, from their lives here,\r\n     with what thrift, patience, and determination they have met the\r\n     difficulties which they have encountered in their efforts to gain\r\n     a foothold, and as men among men, in the land of equal rights.\r\n     From the Hon. Milton Reynolds, President of the Auxiliary Relief\r\n     Association at Parsons, I learn that the negroes who have come\r\n     into the southern part of the State, mostly from Texas, are all\r\n     either settled on small tracts of land or employed as laborers at\r\n     from $8 to $12 per month, and are all doing well. Mr. Reynolds's\r\n     testimony to this effect was positive and unqualified. To assist\r\n     these refugees in Southern Kansas--over 3,000 in all--only $575\r\n     has been expended. From Judge R. W. Dawson, who was the Secretary\r\n     of the association under the old management and during the early\r\n     months of the movement, one year ago, when 6,000 refugees were\r\n     distributed throughout the State and provided with homes at a\r\n     cost of $5,000, I learned much of interest concerning the welfare\r\n     and progress of this advance guard of the great exodus. Judge\r\n     Dawson, although not connected now with the relief work, feels of\r\n     course a great interest in the welfare of those to whose\r\n     assistance he contributed much, and loses no opportunity for\r\n     observation of their condition while travelling over the State.\r\n     He says he knows of no case where one has come back to the\r\n     association for aid, and that, as laborers and citizens, their\r\n     conduct has been such as to win the approval of all classes. Four\r\n     colonies have been established. State lands were bought by the\r\n     association and given to the colonies with the understanding\r\n     that, to secure their title, they must make the second and third\r\n     payments on the land purchased on the one-third cash and\r\n     two-thirds time payment plan. Two of the newest of these colonies\r\n     are still receiving aid from the association, but the others are\r\n     self-sustaining and will be able, it is thought, to make the\r\n     small purchase payments on the land as they become due.\r\n\r\n     \"If our inquiring Statesman is interested in observing in what\r\n     spirit these refugees receive the aid which has made existence\r\n     possible here during the cold winter months, he may be profited\r\n     by spending a few days in looking about the city of Topeka. There\r\n     are in Topeka alone over 3,000 refugees, and nearly all of them,\r\n     paupers when they came, have found means in some way to make a\r\n     living. In many cases it is a precarious subsistence that is\r\n     gained, and in not a few cases among late arrivals he would find\r\n     evidences of want and destitution, but, compared with this, he\r\n     cannot but be struck with the small number of applicants to the\r\n     Relief Association for aid. Only 213 rations were issued outside\r\n     the barracks last week to the 3,000 refugees who came here only a\r\n     few months since without money, and frequently without clothing,\r\n     to undertake what seemed under the circumstances the desperate\r\n     purpose of making a living.\r\n\r\n     \"The dangers and difficulties which beset the refugees' departure\r\n     from a land where even the right to emigrate is denied him are\r\n     great. * * * He may learn (Mr. Voorhees), however, from copies of\r\n     over 1,000 letters in the Governor's office, that Gov. St. John\r\n     has never, in reply to their appeals, failed to warn them of the\r\n     difficulties that would beset their way here, and has never\r\n     extended them promise of other assistance than that implied in\r\n     the equal rights which are guaranteed to every citizen of Kansas.\r\n     Further than this, however surprising it may be to Mr. Voorhees'\r\n     theory of the causes of the exodus, it is nevertheless a fact\r\n     that this very association, which is charged with encouraging the\r\n     exodus, has sent the Rev. W. O. Lynch, a colored man, to the\r\n     South to warn the colored people that they must not come here\r\n     expecting to be fed or to find homes already prepared, and to do\r\n     all in his power to dissuade them from coming at all. Still they\r\n     come, and why they come the country has determined long in\r\n     advance of Mr. Voorhees' report. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"While we have Mr. Voorhees here we would be glad to have him\r\n     glance at a State document to be found upon Governor St. John's\r\n     table, which bears the Great Seal and signature of Gov. O. M.\r\n     Roberts, of the State of Texas. It is a requisition by the\r\n     Governor of Texas upon the Governor of Kansas for the body of one\r\n     Peter Womack, a colored man, who was indicted by the Grand Jury\r\n     of Grimes County at the last November term for the felony of\r\n     fraudulently disposing of ten bushels of corn. From further\r\n     particulars we learn that this Peter Womack gave a mortgage early\r\n     in the spring of 1879 upon his crop just planted to cover a debt\r\n     of twenty dollars due the firm of Wilson and Howel. When Womack\r\n     came to gather his crop, he yields to the importunities of\r\n     another white creditor ten bushels of corn _to be applied_ upon\r\n     the debt. About this time this Peter Womack becomes influential\r\n     in inducing a number of his colored neighbors in Grimes County to\r\n     emigrate to Kansas. Undeterred by threats and despite the\r\n     bull-dozing methods employed to cause him to remain a 'citizen'\r\n     of Texas, Womack, with others, sick of a condition of citizenship\r\n     which is nothing less than hopeless peonage, leaves stock and\r\n     crops behind to seek a home in Kansas. His acts in inciting the\r\n     movement of these black serfs are not forgotten, however, by the\r\n     white chivalry of Grimes County. The evidence of this surrender\r\n     on a debt of ten bushels of corn, mortgaged for another debt, is\r\n     hunted up, presented to the Grand Jury of Grimes County, he is\r\n     promptly indicted for a felony, and the great State of Texas\r\n     rises in her majesty and demands a surrender of his body. The\r\n     demand is in accordance with law, undoubtedly,--Texas law,--but\r\n     if Texas would occasionally punish one of the white murderers who\r\n     do not think it necessary to leave her borders, this pursuit of a\r\n     negro for selling ten bushels of corn from a mortgaged crop would\r\n     seem a more imposing exhibition of the power of the commonwealth\r\n     to enforce its laws.\"[138]\r\n\r\nThe effect, or rather the results of the Exodus have been twofold. It\r\ntaught the Southern people that there was need of some effort to\r\nregain the confidence of the Negroes; that the Negro is the only\r\nlaborer who can cultivate that section of the country; that the Negro\r\ncan get on without the Southern people a great deal better than they\r\ncan get on without Negro labor; that the severe political treatment\r\nand systematic robbery of the Negroes had not only driven them out,\r\nbut had discouraged white people from settling or investing money at\r\nthe South; that dissatisfied labor was against their interests; that\r\nit was the duty of business men in the South to take a firm stand for\r\nthe protection of the Negroes, because every stroke of violence\r\nadministered to the Negroes shocked and injured the business of that\r\nsection; and that kind treatment of and protection for the Negroes\r\nwould insure better work and greater financial prosperity. On the\r\nother hand, the Exodus benefited the Negroes who sought and found new\r\nhomes in a new country; and it secured better treatment for those who\r\nremained behind. The Exodus was in line with a great law that governs\r\nnations. The Negro race must win by contact with the white race; by\r\nabsorbing all that is good; by the inspiration of example. He must\r\ncome in contact now not with a people who hate him, but with a people\r\nof industrious, sober, and honest habits; a people willing to\r\nencourage and instruct him in the duties of life. Race lines must be\r\nobliterated at the South, and the old theory of the natural\r\ninferiority of the Negro must give way to the demonstrations of Negro\r\ncapacity. A new doctrine must supplant the old theories of pre-slavery\r\ndays, and every man in the Republic must enjoy a citizenship as wide\r\nas the continent, and, like the coin of the Government, pass for his\r\nintrinsic value, and no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134] See Senator Windom's speech on the Exodus, Monday, June 14,\r\n1880; also the report of the Senate Committee having under\r\nconsideration the investigation of the causes of the migration of the\r\nColored people from the Southern to the Northern States.\r\n\r\n[135] Pamphlet on Exodus.--Anonymous.\r\n\r\n[136] The Congregationalist, Aug. 11, 1880.\r\n\r\n[137] We visited Kansas twice in 1880, and again in 1881.

The slave markets of America were supplied,[139] very\r\nlargely, from two classes of Africans, viz.: the criminal class, and\r\nthe refuse of African society, which has been preyed upon by local\r\ndisease, decimated by wars waged by the more powerful tribes which\r\nhave pushed down from the abundant supply that has poured over the\r\nterraces of the mountains for centuries. Nevertheless, some of the\r\nbetter class have found their way to this country. About 137 Negro\r\ntribes are represented in the United States.\r\n\r\nFor every slave landed safely in North America, there was one lost in\r\nprocuring and bringing down to the coast, and in transportation. Thus\r\nin the period of 360 years, Africa was robbed of about 30,000,000 of\r\nsouls! When it is remembered that the Negroes in America sprang from\r\nthe criminal, diseased, and inferior classes of Africa, it is nothing\r\nshort of a phenomenon that they were able to endure such a rigorous\r\nstate of bondage. Under-fed and over-worked; poorly clad and miserably\r\nhoused; with the family altar cast down, and intelligent men allowed\r\nto run over it as swine; and with the fountains of knowledge sealed by\r\nlaw against the thirstings of human souls for knowledge, the Negroes\r\nof America, nevertheless, have shown the most wonderful signs of\r\nrecuperation, and the ability to rise, against every cruel act of man\r\nand the very forces of nature, to a manhood and intelligent\r\ncitizenship that converts the cautious, impartial, and conservative\r\nspirit of history into eulogy! They have overcome the obstacles in the\r\npath of the physical civilization of North America; they have earned\r\nbillions of dollars for a profligate people; they have made good\r\nlaborers, efficient sailors, and peerless soldiers. In three wars they\r\nwon the crown of heroes by steady, intrepid valor; and in peace have\r\nshown themselves the friends of stable government. During the war for\r\nthe Union, 186,017[140] Colored men enlisted in the service of the\r\nnation, _and participated in 249 battles_. From 1866 to 1873, besides\r\nthe money saved in other banking houses, they deposited in the\r\nFreedmen's Banks at the South $53,000,000! From 1866 to 1875 there\r\nwere seven Negroes as Lieutenant-Governors of Southern States; two\r\nserved in the United States Senate, and thirteen in the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives. There have been five Negroes appointed as\r\nForeign Ministers. There have been ten Negro members of Northern\r\nlegislatures; and in the Government Departments at Washington there\r\nare 620 Negroes employed. Starting without schools this remarkable\r\npeople have now 14,889 schools, with an attendance of 720,853 pupils!\r\nAnd this does not include the children of color who attend the white\r\nschools of the Northern States; and as far as it is possible to get\r\nthe statistics, there are at present 169 Colored students attending\r\nwhite colleges in the Northern States.\r\n\r\nThe first blood shed in the Revolution was that of a Negro, Crispus\r\nAttucks, on the 5th of March, 1770. The first blood shed in the war\r\nfor the Union was that of a Negro, Nicholas Biddle, a member of the\r\nvery first company that passed through Baltimore in April, 1861; while\r\nthe first Negro killed in the war was named _John Brown!_ The first\r\nUnion regiment of Negro troops raised during the Rebellion, was raised\r\nin the State that was first to secede from the Union, South Carolina.\r\nIts colonel was a Massachusetts man, and a graduate of Harvard\r\nCollege. The first action in which Negro troops participated was in\r\nSouth Carolina. The first regiment of Northern Negro troops fought its\r\nfirst battle in South Carolina, at Fort Wagner, where it immortalized\r\nitself. The first Negro troops recruited in the Mississippi Valley\r\nwere recruited by a Massachusetts officer, Gen. B. F. Butler; while\r\ntheir first fighting here was directed by another Massachusetts\r\nofficer, Gen. N. P. Banks. The first recognition of Negro troops by\r\nthe Confederate army was in December, 1863, when Major John C.\r\nCalhoun, a grandson of the South Carolina statesman of that name, bore\r\na flag of truce, which was received by Major Trowbridge of the First\r\nSouth Carolina Colored Regiment. The first regiment to enter\r\nPetersburg was composed of Negroes; while the first troops to enter\r\nthe Confederate capital at Richmond were Gen. Godfry Weitzel's two\r\ndivisions of Negroes. The last guns fired at Lee's army at Appomattox\r\nwere in the hands of Negro soldiers. And when the last expiring effort\r\nof treason had, through foul conspiracy, laid our beloved President\r\nlow in death, a Negro regiment guarded his remains, and marched in the\r\nstately procession which bore the illustrious dead from the White\r\nHouse. And on the 15th of May, 1865, at Palmetto Ranch, Texas, the 62d\r\nRegiment of Colored Troops fired the last volley of the war!\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to define the racial characteristics\r\nof the Negro, but they have not been attended with success.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe has written more and written better about\r\nthe American Negro than any other person during the present century.\r\nShe has given laboriously and minutely wrought pictures of plantation\r\nlife. She has held up to the gaze of the world portraitures comic and\r\nserio-comic, which for the gorgeousness and awfulness of their drapery\r\nwill perish only with the language in which they are painted.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Stowe's great characters are marred by some glaring\r\nimperfections. \"Uncle Tom\" is too goodish, too lamb-like, too\r\nobsequious. He is a child of full growth, yet lacks the elements of an\r\nenlarged manhood. His mind is feeble, body strong--too strong for the\r\nconspicuous absence of spirit and passion.\r\n\r\n\"Dred\" is the divinest character of the times--is prophet, preacher,\r\nand saint. He is _so_ grand. He is eloquent beyond compare, and as\r\nfamiliar with the Bible as if he were its author. And every hero Mrs.\r\nStowe takes in charge must make up his mind to get religion, lots of\r\nit too, and then prepare to die. There is a terrible fatality among\r\nher leading characters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe has given but one side of Negro character, and that side is\r\nterribly exaggerated. But all strong natures like hers are given to\r\nexaggeration. Wendell Phillips never tells the truth, and yet he\r\nalways tells the truth. He is a man of strong convictions, and always\r\npronounces his conviction strongly. He has a poetical nature, is a\r\nword-painter, and, therefore, indulges in the license of the poet and\r\npainter. Mrs. Stowe belongs to this school of writers. The lamb and\r\nlion are united in the Negro character. Mrs. Stowe's mistake consists\r\nin ascribing to the Negro a peculiarly religious character and\r\ndisposition. Here is detected the mistake. The Negro is not, as she\r\nsupposes, the most religious being in the world. He has more religion\r\nand has less religion than any other of the races, in one sense. And\r\nyet, divorced from the circumstances by which he has been surrounded\r\nin this country, he is not so very religious. Mrs. Stowe seizes upon a\r\ncharacteristic that belongs to mankind wherever mankind is enslaved,\r\nand gently binds it about the neck of the Negro. All races of men\r\nbecome religious when oppressed. Frederick the Great was an infidel\r\nwhen with his friend Voltaire, but when suffering the reverses of war\r\nin Silesia he could write very pious letters to his \"favorite sister.\"\r\nThis is true in national character when traced to its last analysis.\r\nMen pray while they are down in life, but curse when up. And of\r\nnecessity the religion of a bond people is not always healthy. There\r\nis an involuntary turning to a divine helper; a sort of religious\r\nsuperstition, that believes all things, hopes all things, and is\r\npatient. The soul of such a people is surcharged with an almost\r\nincredulous amount of poetry, song, and rude but grand eloquence. And\r\nwhen the songs that cheered and lighted many a heavy heart in the\r\nstarless night of bondage shall have been rescued and purified by the\r\nart of music, the hymnology of this century will be greatly indebted\r\nto this much-abused people. So, under this religious garb, woven by\r\nthe cruel experiences consequent upon slavery, the lion slumbers in\r\nthe Negro.\r\n\r\nEvery year since the close of the Rebellion the Negro has been taking\r\non better and purer traits of character. Possessed of an impressible\r\nnature, a discriminating sense of the beautiful, and a deep, pure\r\ntaste for music, his progress has been phenomenal. Strong in his\r\nattachments, gentle in manners, confiding, hopeful, enduring in\r\naffection, and benevolent to a fault, there is no limit to the outcome\r\nof his character.\r\n\r\nLike the oscillations of the pendulum of a clock the Negro is swinging\r\nfrom an extreme religious fanaticism to an extreme rationalism. But he\r\nwill finally take his position upon a solid religious basis; and to\r\nhis \"faith\" will add virtue, knowledge, and good works. Everywhere\r\nunder good influences he has made a good citizen. No issue in the\r\nState has been foreign to him. He has proven his patriotism and his\r\nfondness for this land to which he was dragged in chains, and in his\r\nobedience to its laws and devotion to its principles has stood second\r\nto none. His home promises much good. His whole life seems to have\r\nundergone a radical change. He has shown a disposition and delight in\r\nthe education of his children; and the constantly growing demand for\r\ncompetent teachers and educated preachers shows that he has outgrown\r\nhis old ideas concerning education and religion. From an insatiable\r\ndesire for gewgaws he has turned to a practice of the precepts of\r\neconomy. From the state of semi-civilization in which he cared only\r\nfor the comforts of the present, his desires and wants have swept\r\noutward and upward into the years to come and toward the Mysterious\r\nFuture. He has learned the difficult lesson that \"man shall not live\r\nby bread alone,\" and has shown himself delighted with a keen sense of\r\nintellectual hunger. One hundred weekly newspapers, conducted by\r\nNegroes, are feeding the mind of the race, binding communities\r\ntogether by the cords of common interests and racial sympathy; while\r\nthe works of twenty Negro authors[141] lend inspiration and purpose\r\nto every honest effort at self-improvement.\r\n\r\nThe fiery trials of the young Colored men who gained admission to West\r\nPoint, and the noble conduct of the four regiments of black troops in\r\nthe severe service of the frontiers have strengthened the hopes of a\r\nnation in the final outcome of the American Negro.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what of the future? Can the Negro endure the sharp competition of\r\nAmerican civilization? Can he keep his position against the tendencies\r\nto amalgamation? Since it has been proven that the Negro is not dying\r\nout, but on the contrary possesses the powers of reproduction to a\r\nremarkable degree, a new source of danger has been discovered. It is\r\nsaid that the Negro will perish, will be absorbed by the dominant race\r\nere long; that where races are crossed the inferior race suffers; and\r\nthat mixed races lack the power to reproduce their species; and that\r\nhence the disappearance of the Negro is but a question of time. Mr.\r\nJoseph C. G. Kennedy, superintendent of the Federal Census during the\r\nwar, took the following view of this question:\r\n\r\n     \"That an unfavorable moral condition has existed and continues\r\n     among the free Colored, be the cause what it may, notwithstanding\r\n     the great number of excellent people included in that population,\r\n     no one can for a moment doubt who will consider that with them an\r\n     element exists which is to some extent positive, and that is the\r\n     fact of there being more than half as many mulattoes as blacks,\r\n     forming, as they do, 36-1/4 per cent. of the whole Colored\r\n     population, and they are maternally descendants of the Colored\r\n     race, as it is well known that no appreciable amount of this\r\n     admixture is the result of marriage between white and black, or\r\n     the progeny of white mothers--a fact showing that whatever\r\n     deterioration may be the consequence of this alloyage, is\r\n     incurred by the Colored race. Where such a proportion of the\r\n     mixed race exists, it may reasonably be inferred that the\r\n     barriers to license are not more insuperable among those of the\r\n     same color. That corruption of morals progresses with greater\r\n     admixture of races, and that the product of vice stimulates the\r\n     propensity to immorality, is as evident to observation as it is\r\n     natural to circumstances. These developments of the census, to a\r\n     good degree, explain the slow progress of the free Colored\r\n     population in the Northern States, and indicate, with unerring\r\n     certainty, the gradual extinction of that people the more rapidly\r\n     as, whether free or slave, they become diffused among the\r\n     dominant race. There are, however, other causes, although in\r\n     themselves not sufficient to account for the great excess of\r\n     deaths over births, as is found to occur in some Northern cities,\r\n     and these are such as are incident to incongenial climate and a\r\n     condition involving all the exposures and hardships which\r\n     accompany a people of lower caste. As but two censuses have been\r\n     taken which discriminate between the blacks and mulattoes, it is\r\n     not yet so easy to determine how far the admixture of the races\r\n     affects their vital power; but the developments already made\r\n     would indicate that the mingling of the races is more unfavorable\r\n     to vitality, than a condition of slavery, which practically\r\n     ignores marriage to the exclusion of the admixture of races, has\r\n     proved, for among the slaves the natural increase has been as\r\n     high as three per cent. per annum, and ever more than two per\r\n     cent., while the proportion of mulattoes at the present period\r\n     reaches but 10.41 per cent. in the slave population. Among the\r\n     free Colored in the Southern States, the admixture of races\r\n     appears to have progressed at a somewhat less ratio than at the\r\n     North, and we can only account for the greater proportionate\r\n     number of mulattoes in the North by the longer period of their\r\n     freedom in the midst of the dominant and more numerous race, and\r\n     the supposition of more mulattoes than blacks having escaped or\r\n     been manumitted from slavery.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever merit this view possessed before the war of the Rebellion, it\r\nis obsolete under the present organization of society. The\r\nenvironments of the Negro, the downward tendencies of his social life,\r\nand the exposed state in which slave laws left him, have all perished.\r\nIn addition to his aptitude for study and capacity for improvement, he\r\nis now under the protecting and restraining influences of congenial\r\nclimate; and pure sociological laws will impart to his offspring the\r\npower of reproduction and the ability to maintain an excellent social\r\nfooting with the other races of the world. The learned M. A.\r\nDeQuatrefages says, concerning this question:\r\n\r\n     None of the eminent men with whom I regret to differ take any\r\n     account of the influence of the action of the surroundings. I\r\n     believe that the conditions of the surroundings play as important\r\n     a part in the crossing of races as they do in other matters. They\r\n     may sometimes favor, sometimes restrict, sometimes prevent, the\r\n     establishment of a mixed race. This simple consideration accounts\r\n     for many apparently contradictory facts. Etwick and Long have\r\n     affirmed that in Jamaica the mulattoes hold out only because they\r\n     are constantly recruited by the marriage of whites with\r\n     negresses. But in San Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, there\r\n     are, we may say, no whites, and the population consists of two\r\n     thirds mulattoes and one third negroes. The numbers of the\r\n     mulattoes are there well kept up by themselves without the\r\n     introduction of fresh blood. In respect to fertility; different\r\n     instances of crossing between individuals of the two same races\r\n     may give different results, according to the place where they are\r\n     effected. I believe it is unnecessary to insist and show that the\r\n     physical and physiological faculties of children born of mixed\r\n     unions ought to present analogous facts.\r\n\r\n     \"In my view the aggregation of physical conditions does not in\r\n     itself alone constitute the environment. Social and moral\r\n     conditions have an equal part in it. Here, again, it is easy to\r\n     establish, in the results of crossings, differences which have no\r\n     other cause than differences in these conditions. It is true that\r\n     mongrels, born and grown up in the midst of the hatred of the\r\n     inferior race and the contempt of the superior race, are liable\r\n     to merit the reproaches which are commonly attached to them. On\r\n     the other hand, if real marriages take place between the races,\r\n     and their offspring are placed upon a footing of equality with\r\n     the mass of the population, they are quite able to reach the\r\n     general level, and sometimes to display superior qualities.\r\n\r\n     \"All of my studies on this question have brought me to the\r\n     conclusion that the mixture of races has in the past had a great\r\n     part in the constitution of a large number of actual populations.\r\n     It is also clear to me that its part in the future will not be\r\n     less considerable. The movement of expansion, to which I have\r\n     just called attention, has not slackened since the days of Cortez\r\n     and Pizarro, but has become more extended and general. The\r\n     perfection of the means of communication has given it new\r\n     activity. The people of mixed blood already constitute a\r\n     considerable part of the population of certain states, and their\r\n     number is large enough to entitle them to be taken notice of in\r\n     the population of the whole world.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"These facts show that man is everywhere the same, and that his\r\n     passions and instincts are independent of the differences that\r\n     distinguish the human groups. The reason of it is that these\r\n     differences, however accentuated they may seem to us, are\r\n     essentially morphological, but do not in any way touch the wholly\r\n     physiological power of reproduction.\"[142]\r\n\r\nRace prejudice is bound to give way before the potent influences of\r\ncharacter, education, and wealth. And these are necessary to the\r\ngrowth of the race. Without wealth there can be no leisure, without\r\nleisure there can be no thought, and without thought there can be no\r\nprogress. The future work of the Negro is twofold: subjective and\r\nobjective. Years will be devoted to his own education and improvement\r\nhere in America. He will sound the depths of education, accumulate\r\nwealth, and then turn his attention to the civilization of Africa. The\r\nUnited States will yet establish a line of steamships between this\r\ncountry and the Dark Continent. Touching at the Grain Coast, the Ivory\r\nCoast, and the Gold Coast, America will carry the African\r\nmissionaries, Bibles, papers, improved machinery, instead of rum and\r\nchains. And Africa, in return, will send America indigo, palm-oil,\r\nivory, gold, diamonds, costly wood, and her richest treasures, instead\r\nof slaves. Tribes will be converted to Christianity; cities will rise,\r\nstates will be founded; geography and science will enrich and enlarge\r\ntheir discoveries; and a telegraph cable binding the heart of Africa\r\nto the ear of the civilized world, every throb of joy or sorrow will\r\npulsate again in millions of souls.

He was a shopkeeper and dealer in second-hand\r\nclothes. He was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, September 28,\r\n1785, of a free mother by a slave father. When quite young he said:\r\n\"If I remain in this bloody land, I will not live long. As true as God\r\nreigns, I will be avenged for the sorrow which my people have\r\nsuffered. This is not the place for me--no, no. I must leave this part\r\nof the country. It will be a great trial for me to live on the same\r\nsoil where so many men are in slavery; certainly I cannot remain where\r\nI must hear their chains continually, and where I must encounter the\r\ninsults of their hypocritical enslavers. Go, I must!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to Boston, Massachusetts, where he took up his residence. He\r\napplied himself to study, and in 1827, capable of reading and writing,\r\nhe began business in Brattle Street. He was possessed of a rather\r\nreflective and penetrating mind. And before Mr. William Lloyd Garrison\r\nunfurled his flag for the Agitation Movement, David Walker wrote and\r\npublished his Appeal in 1829. It was circulated widely, and touched\r\nand stirred the South as no other pamphlet had ever done. Three\r\neditions were published. The feeling at the South was intense. The\r\nfollowing correspondence shows how deeply agitated the South was by\r\nWalker's Appeal. The editor of the _Boston Courier_ observed: \"It will\r\nbe recollected that some time in December last [1829] Gov. Giles sent\r\na message to the Legislature of Virginia complaining of an attempt to\r\ncirculate in the city of Richmond a seditious pamphlet, said to have\r\nbeen sent there from Boston. We find in the _Richmond Enquirer_ of the\r\n18th inst. [February, 1830] the following Message from the Governor,\r\nenclosing a correspondence which unravels all the mystery which has\r\nhitherto enveloped the transaction.\"\r\n\r\n                              EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Feb. 16th, 1830.\r\n\r\n     SIR: In compliance with the advice of the Executive Council, I do\r\n     myself the honor of transmitting herewith the copy of a letter\r\n     from the Honorable Harrison Gray Otis, Mayor of Boston, conveying\r\n     the copy of a letter from him addressed to the Mayor of Savannah,\r\n     in answer to one received by him from that gentleman respecting a\r\n     seditious pamphlet written by a person of color in Boston, and\r\n     circulated by him in other parts of the United States.\r\n\r\n                              Very respectfully, your obd't serv't,\r\n                                                          WM. B. GILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Hon. LINN BANKS, _Speaker of the House of Delegates_.\r\n\r\n     _To his Excellency, the Governor of Virginia_:\r\n\r\n     SIR: Perceiving that a pamphlet published in this city has been a\r\n     subject of animadversion and uneasiness in Virginia as well as in\r\n     Georgia, I have presumed that it might not be amiss to apprize\r\n     you of the sentiments and feelings of the city authorities in\r\n     this place respecting it, and for that purpose I beg leave to\r\n     send you a copy of my answer to a letter from the Mayor of\r\n     Savannah, addressed to me on that subject. You may be assured\r\n     that your good people cannot hold in more absolute detestation\r\n     the sentiments of the writer than do the people of this city, and\r\n     as I verily believe, the mass of the New England population. The\r\n     only difference is, that the insignificance of the writer, the\r\n     extravagance of his sanguinary fanaticism tending to disgust all\r\n     persons of common humanity with his object, and the very partial\r\n     circulation of this book, prevent the affair from being a subject\r\n     of excitement and hardly of serious attention.\r\n\r\n     I have reason to believe that the book is disapproved of by the\r\n     decent portion even of the free colored population in this place,\r\n     and it would be a cause of deep regret to me, and I believe to\r\n     all my well-disposed fellow-citizens, if a publication of this\r\n     character, and emanating from such a source, should be thought to\r\n     be countenanced by any of their number.\r\n\r\n          I have the honor to be respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                      H. G. OTIS, _Mayor of the City of Boston_.\r\n\r\n     BOSTON, Feb. 10, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the Mayor of Savannah_:\r\n\r\n     SIR: Indisposition has prevented an earlier reply to your favor\r\n     of the 12th December. A few days before the receipt of it, the\r\n     _pamphlet_ had been put into my hands by one of the Board of\r\n     Aldermen of this city, who received it from an individual, it not\r\n     having been circulated here. I perused it carefully, in order to\r\n     ascertain whether the writer had made himself amenable to our\r\n     laws; but notwithstanding the extremely bad and inflammatory\r\n     tendency of the publication, he does not seem to have violated\r\n     any of these laws. It is written by a free black man, whose true\r\n     name it bears. He is a shopkeeper and dealer in old clothes, and\r\n     in a conversation which I authorized a young friend of mine to\r\n     hold with him, he openly avows the sentiments of the book and\r\n     authorship. I also hear that he declares his intention to be, to\r\n     circulate his pamphlets by mail, at his own expense, if he cannot\r\n     otherwise effect his object.\r\n\r\n     You may be assured, sir, that a disposition would not be wanting\r\n     on the part of the city authorities here, to avail themselves of\r\n     any lawful means for preventing this attempt to throw firebrands\r\n     into your country. We regard it with deep disapprobation and\r\n     abhorrence. But, we have no power to control the purpose of the\r\n     author, and without it we think that any public notice of him or\r\n     his book, would make matters worse.\r\n\r\n     We have been determined, however, to publish a general caution to\r\n     Captains and others, against exposing themselves to the\r\n     consequences of transporting incendiary writings into your and\r\n     the other Southern States.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n                                                       H. G. OTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6.\r\n\r\n_THE PERIOD OF PREPARATION._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLIST OF WORKS BY NEGRO AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\"Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa.\" Autobiography.

K.\r\nRukenbrod, editor, at Salem, Ohio, Wednesday, December 28, 1859. The\r\nbeautiful spirit of self-sacrifice, the lofty devotion to the sublime\r\nprinciples of universal liberty, and the heroic welcome to the hour of\r\nmartyrdom, invest these letters with intrinsic historic value.\r\n\r\n     LETTER FROM EDWIN COPPOCK TO HIS UNCLE JOSHUA COPPOCK.\r\n\r\n                                   CHARLESTON, VA., December 13, 1859.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR UNCLE: I seat myself by the stand to write for the _last_\r\n     time, to thee and thy family. Though far from home, and overtaken\r\n     by misfortune, I have not forgotten you. Your generous\r\n     hospitality toward me during my short stay with you last Spring\r\n     is stamped indelibly upon my heart; and also the generosity\r\n     bestowed upon my poor brother, at the same time, who now wanders\r\n     an outcast from his native land. But thank God he is free, and I\r\n     am thankful it is I who have to suffer instead of him.\r\n\r\n     The time may come when he will remember me. And the time may come\r\n     when he will still further remember the _cause in which I die_.\r\n     Thank God the principles of the cause in which we were engaged\r\n     _will not die with me and my brave comrades_. They will spread\r\n     wider and wider, and gather strength with each hour that passes.\r\n\r\n     The voice of truth will echo through our land, bringing\r\n     conviction to the erring, and adding numbers to _that glorious\r\n     Army who will enlist under its banner_. The cause of everlasting\r\n     truth and justice will go on \"conquering and to conquer,\" until\r\n     our broad and beautiful land shall rest beneath the banner of\r\n     freedom. I had hoped to live to see the dawn of that glorious\r\n     day. I had hoped to live to see the principles of the Declaration\r\n     of our Independence fully realized. I had hoped to see the dark\r\n     stain of slavery blotted from our land, and the _libel_ of our\r\n     boasted freedom erased; when we can say in truth that our beloved\r\n     country is \"the land of the free, and the home of the\r\n     brave.\"--But this cannot be. I have heard my sentence passed, my\r\n     doom is sealed. But two brief days between me and eternity. At\r\n     the expiration of those two days, I shall stand upon the scaffold\r\n     to take my last look at earthly scenes. But that scaffold has but\r\n     little dread for me; for I honestly believe I am innocent of any\r\n     crime justifying such punishment.\r\n\r\n     But by the taking of my life, and the lives of my comrades,\r\n     Virginia is but hastening on that glorious day, when the slave\r\n     will rejoice in his freedom; when he can say that _I too am a\r\n     man_, and am groaning no more under the yoke of oppression. But I\r\n     must now close. Accept this short scrawl as a remembrance of me.\r\n     Remember me to my relatives and friends. And now Farewell.\r\n\r\n                                   From thy nephew,\r\n                                                        EDWIN COPPOCK.\r\n\r\n     P. S. I will say for I know it will be a satisfaction to all of\r\n     you, that we are all kindly treated, and I hope the North will\r\n     not fail to give Sheriff Campbell and Captain Avis due\r\n     acknowledgment for their kind and noble actions.\r\n\r\n                                                        E.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LETTER FROM EDWIN COPPOCK TO THOMAS WINN.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND THOMAS WINN: For thy love and sympathy, and for\r\n     thy unwearied exertion in my behalf, accept my warmest thanks. I\r\n     have no words to tell the gratitude and love I have for thee. And\r\n     may God bless thee and thy family, for the love and kindness thee\r\n     has always shown towards my family and me. And when life with\r\n     thee is over, may we meet on that shore where there is no\r\n     parting, is the farewell prayer of thy true friend.\r\n\r\n                                                        EDWIN COPPOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHAT LETTER.\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter from Edwin Coppock, seized upon by the\r\nVirginia authorities as a pretence for not commuting his sentence. The\r\noffensive remark consisted alone wherein he spoke of the chivalry as\r\n\"the enemy.\" There certainly is nothing in this communication that\r\ncould justify a Government in taking the life of a man whom it\r\notherwise considered not guilty of a capital crime, but whose greatest\r\noffence was that of being found, as Wise claimed, in bad company. We\r\ngive the letter entire:\r\n\r\n     EDWIN COPPOCK TO MRS. BROWN.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLESTON JAIL, VIRGINIA, November --, 1859.\r\n\r\n     MRS. JOHN BROWN--Dear Madam: I was very sorry that your request\r\n     to see the rest of the prisoners was not complied with. Mrs. Avis\r\n     brought me a book whose pages are full of truth and beauty,\r\n     entitled \"Voice of the True-Hearted,\" which she told me was a\r\n     present from you. For this dear token of remembrance, please\r\n     accept my thanks.\r\n\r\n     My comrade, J. E. Cook, and myself, deeply sympathize with you in\r\n     your sad bereavement. We were both acquainted with Anna and\r\n     Martha. They were to us as sisters, and as brothers we sympathize\r\n     with them in the dark hour of trial and affliction.\r\n\r\n     I was with your sons when they fell. Oliver lived but a few\r\n     moments after he was shot. He spoke no word, but yielded calmly\r\n     to his fate. Watson was shot at 10 o'clock on Monday morning, and\r\n     died about 3 o'clock on Wednesday morning. He suffered much.\r\n     Though mortally wounded at 10 o'clock, yet at 3 o'clock Monday\r\n     afternoon he fought bravely against the men who charged on us.\r\n     When the enemy were repulsed, and the excitement of the charge\r\n     was over, he began to sink rapidly.\r\n\r\n     After we were taken prisoners, he was placed in the guard-house\r\n     with me. He complained of the hardness of the bench on which he\r\n     was lying. I begged hard for a bed for him, or even a blanket,\r\n     but could obtain none for him. I took off my coat and placed it\r\n     under him, and held his head in my lap, in which position he died\r\n     without a groan or a struggle.\r\n\r\n     I have stated these facts thinking that they may afford to you,\r\n     and to the bereaved widows they have left, a mournful\r\n     consolation.\r\n\r\n     Give my love to Anna and Martha, with our last farewell.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly,\r\n                                                        EDWIN COPPOCK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     COOK'S LAST LETTER TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n                                   CHARLESTOWN JAIL, Dec. 16, 1859.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILD: For the last time I take my pen to\r\n     address you--for the last time to speak to you through the tongue\r\n     of the absent. I am about to leave you and this world forever.\r\n     But do not give way to your grief. Look with the eyes of hope\r\n     beyond the vale of life, and see the dawning of that brighter\r\n     morrow that shall know no clouds or shadows in its sunny\r\n     sky--that shall know no sunset. To that eternal day I trust,\r\n     beloved, I am going now. For me there waits no far-off or\r\n     uncertain future. I am only going from my camp on earth to a home\r\n     in heaven; from the dark clouds of sin and grief, to the clear\r\n     blue skies, the flowing fountains, and the eternal joys of that\r\n     better and brighter land, whose only entrance is through the vale\r\n     of death--whose only gateway is the tomb.\r\n\r\n     Oh, yes! think that I am only going home; going to meet my\r\n     Saviour and my God; going to meet my comrades, and wait and watch\r\n     for you. Each hour that passes, every tolling bell, proclaims\r\n     this world is not our home. We are but pilgrims here, journeying\r\n     to our Father's house. Some have a long and weary road to wander;\r\n     shadowed o'er with doubts and fears, they often tire and faint\r\n     upon life's roadside; yet, still all wearied, they must move\r\n     along. Some make a more rapid journey, and complete their\r\n     pilgrimage in the bright morn of life; they know no weariness\r\n     upon their journey, no ills or cares of toil-worn age. I and my\r\n     comrades here are among that number. Our pilgrimage is nearly\r\n     ended; we can almost see our homes. A few more hours and we shall\r\n     be there.\r\n\r\n     True, it is hard for me to leave my loving partner and my little\r\n     one, lingering on the rugged road on which life's storms are\r\n     bursting. But cheer up, my beloved ones; those storms will soon\r\n     be over; through their last lingering shadows you will see the\r\n     promised rainbow. It will whisper of a happy land where all\r\n     storms are over. Will you not strive to meet me in that clime of\r\n     unending sunshine? Oh! yes, I know you will; that you will also\r\n     try to lead our child along that path of glory; that you will\r\n     claim for him an entrance to that celestial city whose maker and\r\n     builder is God. Teach him the way of truth and virtue. Tell him\r\n     for what and how his father left him ere his lips could lisp my\r\n     name. Pray for him. Remember that there is no golden gateway to\r\n     the realms of pleasure here, but there is one for the redeemed in\r\n     the land that lies starward. There I hope we may meet, when you\r\n     have completed your pilgrimage on the road of life. Years will\r\n     pass on and your journey will soon be ended. Live so that when\r\n     from the verge of life you look back you may feel no vain\r\n     regrets, no bitter anguish for mis-spent years. Look to God in\r\n     all your troubles; cast yourself on Him when your heart is dark\r\n     with the night of sorrow and heavy with the weight of woe. He\r\n     will shed over you the bright sunshine of His love, and take away\r\n     the burden from your heart.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     And now farewell. May that all-wise and eternal God, who governs\r\n     all things, be with you to guide and protect you through life,\r\n     and bring us together in eternal joy beyond the grave. Farewell,\r\n     fond partner of my heart and soul. Farewell, dear babe of our\r\n     love. A last, long farewell, till we meet in heaven.\r\n\r\n                    I remain, in life and death, your devoted husband.\r\n                                                        JOHN E. COOK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFUNERAL OF JOHN E. COOK.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of Capt. Cook took place at Brooklyn on the 20th, from the\r\nresidence of Mrs. S. L. Harris. The services were conducted by the\r\nRev. Mr. Caldicott, of the Lee Avenue Dutch Reformed Church, and at\r\nthe Cypress Hills Cemetery by the Rev. Wm. H. Johnson. Of the body the\r\nday previous, the _Tribune_ says:\r\n\r\n     Owing to the length of time that elapsed between the decease and\r\n     the time the body was delivered into the charge of Dr. Holmes,\r\n     the process of embalming has been somewhat difficult, and\r\n     consequently the appearance of the remains is not so natural as\r\n     it otherwise would have been. Last evening the body was placed\r\n     in an erect position, in order to allow the injected fluid to\r\n     settle in the veins and arteries, so as to give to the face a\r\n     more natural appearance. The swelling has entirely disappeared\r\n     from the neck and face, and the decomposition which had set in\r\n     had been checked. The remains will not be enshrouded until this\r\n     morning, when they will be placed in the coffin, enclosed in a\r\n     white merino robe with a satin collar, satin cord about the\r\n     waist, and a black neckerchief about the neck.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday afternoon the father, sisters, and wife of the deceased\r\n     were permitted to view the remains. His wife removed the\r\n     breast-pin and a miniature of their child from about his neck,\r\n     which she had placed there but a few days previous to his\r\n     execution. She is but eighteen years of age, and has an infant\r\n     four months old. She is from Harper's Ferry, Va., where she was\r\n     married about seventeen months since. She, as well as the other\r\n     relatives, was overwhelmed with sorrow, and it was some moments\r\n     before they were sufficiently recovered to be enabled to leave\r\n     the body. The refusal of the Consistories of the Lee Avenue and\r\n     Fourth Reformed Dutch Churches to permit the services to be held\r\n     in their edifices has given rise to the expression of much\r\n     feeling, and many of the friends of the deceased infer that this\r\n     refusal is made from a fear of censure on the part of some of the\r\n     members of their congregations, in allowing a Christian burial to\r\n     the remains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the little burial-ground at Oberlin, Lorain County, Ohio, there is\r\na monument dedicated to the memory of three of the John Brown Men, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  L.

Mr. M. felt that the demand was exorbitant, and\r\nappealed in his dilemma to the slaves who were assisting in the\r\nmoulding. \"I can do that well,\" said one of them, an intelligent and\r\ningenious servant, who had been intimately engaged in the various\r\nprocesses. The striker was dismissed, and the negro, assisted\r\noccasionally by the finer skill of his master, took the striker's\r\nplace as superintendent, and the work went on. The black\r\nmaster-builder lifted the ponderous, uncouth masses, and bolted them\r\ntogether, joint by joint, piece by piece, till they blended into the\r\nmajestic \"Freedom,\" who to-day lifts her head in the blue clouds above\r\nWashington, invoking a benediction upon the imperilled Republic!\r\n\r\nWas there a prophecy in that moment when the slave became the artist,\r\nand with rare poetic justice, reconstructed the beautiful symbol of\r\nfreedom for America?[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[143] Washington Correspondent of the New York Tribune, December 2,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7.\r\n\r\n_THE NEGRO IN THE WAR FOR THE UNION._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nNEGROES AS SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\nGen. Benj. F. Butler commanded a number of Negro Troops at Fort\r\nHarrison on the 29th Sept., 1864. After white troops had been driven\r\nback by the enemy, Gen. Butler ordered his Negro troops to storm the\r\nfortified position of the enemy at the point of the bayonet. The\r\ntroops had to charge down a hill, ford a creek, and--preceded by\r\naxemen who had to cut away two lines of _abatis_--then carry the works\r\nheld by infantry and artillery. They made one of the most brilliant\r\ncharges of the war, with \"Remember Fort Pillow\" as their battle-cry,\r\nand carried the works in an incredibly short time.\r\n\r\nNearly a decade after this battle, Gen. Butler, then a member of\r\nCongress from Massachusetts, said, in a speech on the Civil Rights\r\nBill of this affair:\r\n\r\n     \"It became my painful duty to follow in the track of that\r\n     charging column, and there, in a space not wider than the clerk's\r\n     desk, and three hundred yards long, lay the dead bodies of five\r\n     hundred and forty-three of my colored comrades, fallen in defence\r\n     of their country, who had offered up their lives to uphold its\r\n     flag and its honor, as a willing sacrifice; and as I rode along\r\n     among them, guiding my horse this way and that way, lest he\r\n     should profane with his hoofs what seemed to me the sacred dead,\r\n     and as I looked on their bronze faces upturned in the shining\r\n     sun, as if in mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for\r\n     which they had given their lives, whose flag had only been to\r\n     them a flag of stripes, on which no star of glory had ever shone\r\n     for them--feeling I had wronged them in the past, and believing\r\n     what was the future of my country to them--among my dead comrades\r\n     there, I swore to myself a solemn oath--'May my right hand forget\r\n     its cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,' if I\r\n     ever fail to defend the rights of those men who have given their\r\n     blood for me and my country that day and for their race forever,\r\n     and God helping me, I will keep that oath.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBATTLES IN WHICH COLORED TROOPS PARTICIPATED.\r\n\r\n \"Alliance,\" Steamer, Fla.

The correspondence\r\n     is not complete yet, and the Department will be informed of the\r\n     result at the earliest practicable moment.\r\n\r\n                         I am, General, yours respectfully,\r\n                                     S.

G., Richmond, Va._\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FORREST TO GENERAL WASHBURN.\r\n\r\n                                   HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY, }\r\n                                      IN THE FIELD, June 14, 1864. }\r\n\r\n     Major-General Washburn, _Commanding United States Forces,\r\n     Memphis_:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: I have the honor herewith to enclose copy of letter\r\n     received from Brigadier-General Buford, commanding United States\r\n     forces at Helena, Arkansas, addressed to Colonel E. W. Rucker,\r\n     commanding Sixth Regiment of this command; also a letter from\r\n     myself to General Buford, which I respectfully request you will\r\n     read and forward to him.\r\n\r\n     There is a matter also to which I desire to call your attention,\r\n     which, until now, I have not thought proper to make the subject\r\n     of a communication. Recent events render it necessary,--in fact,\r\n     demand it.\r\n\r\n     It has been reported to me that all the negro troops stationed in\r\n     Memphis took an oath on their knees, in the presence of\r\n     Major-General Hurlbut and other officers of your army, to avenge\r\n     Fort Pillow, and that they would show my troops no quarter.\r\n\r\n     Again, I have it from indisputable authority that the troops\r\n     under Brigadier-General Sturgis, on their recent march from\r\n     Memphis, publicly and in various places proclaimed that no\r\n     quarter would be shown my men. As his troops were moved into\r\n     action on the eleventh, the officers commanding exhorted their\r\n     men to remember Fort Pillow, and a large majority of the\r\n     prisoners we have captured from that command have voluntarily\r\n     stated that they expected us to murder them, otherwise they would\r\n     have surrendered in a body rather than taken to the bushes after\r\n     being run down and exhausted. The recent battle of Tishemingo\r\n     Creek was far more bloody than it otherwise would have been but\r\n     for the fact that your men evidently expected to be slaughtered\r\n     when captured, and both sides acted as though neither felt safe\r\n     in surrendering even when further resistance was useless. The\r\n     prisoners captured by us say they felt condemned by the\r\n     announcements, etc., of their own commanders, and expected no\r\n     quarter. In all my operations since the war began, I have\r\n     conducted the war on civilized principles, and desire still to do\r\n     so, but it is due to my command that they should know the\r\n     position you occupy and the policy you intend to pursue. I\r\n     therefore respectfully ask whether my men in your hands are\r\n     treated as other Confederate prisoners, also the course intended\r\n     to be pursued in regard to those who may hereafter fall into your\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     I have in my possession quite a number of wounded officers and\r\n     men of General Sturgis's command, all of whom have been treated\r\n     as well as we have been able to treat them, and are mostly in\r\n     charge of a surgeon left at Ripley by General Sturgis to look\r\n     after the wounded. Some of them are too severely wounded to be\r\n     removed at present. I am willing to exchange them for any men of\r\n     my command you may have, and as soon as they are able to be\r\n     removed will give them safe escort through my lines in charge of\r\n     the surgeon left with them.\r\n\r\n     I made such an arrangement with Major-General Hurlbut when he was\r\n     in command of Memphis, and am willing to renew it, provided it is\r\n     desired, as it would be better than to subject them to the long\r\n     and fatiguing delay necessary to a regular exchange at City\r\n     Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\n                    I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                                  N. B. FORREST, _Major-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WASHBURN TO GENERAL LEE.\r\n\r\n                         HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE, }\r\n                              MEMPHIS, TENN., June 17, 1864.      }\r\n\r\n     Major-General S. D. LEE, _Commanding Confederate Forces near\r\n     Tupelo, Miss._:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: When I heard that the forces of Brigadier-General\r\n     Sturgis had been driven back, and a portion of them probably\r\n     captured, I felt considerable solicitude for the fate of the two\r\n     colored regiments that formed a part of the command, until I was\r\n     informed that the Confederate forces were commanded by you. When\r\n     I learned that, I became satisfied that no atrocities would be\r\n     committed upon those troops, but that they would receive the\r\n     treatment which humanity as well as their gallant conduct\r\n     demanded.\r\n\r\n     I regret to say that the hope that I entertained has been\r\n     dispelled by facts which have recently come to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n     From statements that have been made to me by colored soldiers who\r\n     were eye-witnesses, it would seem that the massacre at Fort\r\n     Pillow had been reproduced at the late affair at Bryce's\r\n     Cross-roads. The detail of the atrocities there committed I will\r\n     not trouble you with. If true, and not disavowed, they must lead\r\n     to consequences too fearful to contemplate. It is best that we\r\n     should now have a fair understanding upon this question, of the\r\n     treatment of this class of soldiers. If it is contemplated by the\r\n     Confederate government to murder all colored troops that may by\r\n     chance of war fall into their hands, as was the case at Fort\r\n     Pillow, it is but fair that it should be freely and frankly\r\n     avowed. Within the last six weeks I have, on two occasions, sent\r\n     colored troops into the field from this point. In the expectation\r\n     that the Confederate government would disavow the action of their\r\n     commanding general at the Fort Pillow massacre, I have forborne\r\n     to issue any instructions to the colored troops as to the course\r\n     they should pursue toward Confederate soldiers. No disavowal on\r\n     the part of the Confederate government having been made, but, on\r\n     the contrary, laudations from the entire Southern press of the\r\n     perpetrators of the massacre, I may safely presume that\r\n     indiscriminate slaughter is to be the fate of colored troops that\r\n     fall into your hands. But I am not willing to leave a matter of\r\n     such grave import, and involving consequences so fearful, to\r\n     inference, and I have therefore thought it proper to address you\r\n     this, believing that you would be able to indicate the policy\r\n     that the Confederate government intend to pursue hereafter on\r\n     this question.\r\n\r\n     If it is intended to raise the black flag against that\r\n     unfortunate race, they will cheerfully accept the issue. Up to\r\n     this time no troops have fought more gallantly, and none have\r\n     conducted themselves with greater propriety. They have fully\r\n     vindicated their right (so long denied) to be treated as men.\r\n\r\n     I hope that I have been misinformed in regard to the treatment\r\n     they have received at the battle of Bryce's Cross-roads, and that\r\n     the accounts received result rather from the excited imaginations\r\n     of the fugitives than from actual fact.\r\n\r\n     For the government of the colored troops under my command, I\r\n     would thank you to inform me, with as little delay as possible,\r\n     if it is your intention, or the intention of the Confederate\r\n     government, to murder colored soldiers that may fall into your\r\n     hands, or treat them as prisoners of war, and subject to be\r\n     exchanged as other prisoners.\r\n\r\n               I am, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                      C. C. WASHBURN, _Major-General, Commanding_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WASHBURN TO GENERAL FORREST.\r\n\r\n                         HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE, }\r\n                              MEMPHIS, TENN., June 19, 1864.      }\r\n\r\n     Major-General N. B. FORREST, _Commanding Confederate Forces:_\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: Your communication of the fourteenth instant is\r\n     received. The letter to Brigadier-General Buford will be\r\n     forwarded to him.\r\n\r\n     In regard to that part of your letter which relates to colored\r\n     troops, I beg to say that I have already sent a communication on\r\n     the subject to the officer in command of the Confederate forces\r\n     at Tupelo.\r\n\r\n     Having understood that Major-General S. D. Lee was in command\r\n     there, I directed my letter to him--a copy of it I enclose. You\r\n     say in your letter that it has been reported to you that all the\r\n     negro troops stationed in Memphis took an oath on their knees, in\r\n     the presence of Major-General Hurlbut, and other officers of our\r\n     army, to avenge Fort Pillow, and that they would show your troops\r\n     no quarter.\r\n\r\n     I believe it is true that the colored troops did take such an\r\n     oath, but not in the presence of General Hurlbut. From what I can\r\n     learn, this act of theirs was not influenced by any white\r\n     officer, but was the result of their own sense of what was due to\r\n     themselves and their fellows who had been mercilessly\r\n     slaughtered.\r\n\r\n     I have no doubt that they went into the field, as you allege, in\r\n     the full belief that they would be murdered in case they fell\r\n     into your hands. The affair at Fort Pillow fully justified that\r\n     belief. I am not aware as to what they proclaimed on their late\r\n     march, and it may be, as you say, that they declared that no\r\n     quarter would be given to any of your men that might fall into\r\n     their hands.\r\n\r\n     Your declaration that you have conducted the war, on all\r\n     occasions, on civilized principles, cannot be accepted; but I\r\n     receive with satisfaction the intimation in your letter that the\r\n     recent slaughter of colored troops at the battle of Tishemingo\r\n     Creek resulted rather from the desperation with which they fought\r\n     than a predetermined intention to give them no quarter.\r\n\r\n     You must have learned by this time that the attempt to intimidate\r\n     the colored troops by indiscriminate slaughter has signally\r\n     failed, and that, instead of a feeling of terror, you have\r\n     aroused a spirit of courage and desperation that will not down at\r\n     your bidding.\r\n\r\n     I am left in doubt, by your letter, as to the course you and the\r\n     Confederate government intend to pursue hereafter in regard to\r\n     colored troops, and I beg you to advise me, with as little delay\r\n     as possible, as to your intentions.\r\n\r\n     If you intend to treat such of them as fall into your hands as\r\n     prisoners of war, please so state; if you do not so intend, but\r\n     contemplate either their slaughter or their return to slavery,\r\n     please state _that_, so that we may have no misunderstanding\r\n     hereafter. If the former is your intention, I shall receive the\r\n     announcement with pleasure, and shall explain the fact to the\r\n     colored troops at once, and desire that they recall the oath they\r\n     have taken; if the _latter_ is the case, then let the oath stand,\r\n     and upon those who have aroused this spirit by their atrocities,\r\n     and upon the government and people who sanction it, be the\r\n     consequences.\r\n\r\n     In regard to your inquiry relating to prisoners of your command\r\n     in our hands, I have to state that they have always received the\r\n     treatment which a great and humane Government extends to its\r\n     prisoners. What course will be pursued hereafter toward them\r\n     must, of course, depend on circumstances that may arise. If your\r\n     command, hereafter, does nothing which should properly exclude\r\n     them from being treated as prisoners of war, they will be so\r\n     treated.\r\n\r\n     I thank you for your offer to exchange wounded officers and men\r\n     in your hands. If you will send them in, I will exchange man for\r\n     man, so far as I have the ability to do so.\r\n\r\n     Before closing this letter, I wish to call your attention to one\r\n     case of unparalleled outrage and murder that has been brought to\r\n     my notice, and in regard to which the evidence is overwhelming.\r\n\r\n     Among the prisoners captured at Fort Pillow was Major Bradford,\r\n     who had charge of the defence of the fort after the fall of Major\r\n     Booth.\r\n\r\n     After being taken prisoner, he was started with other prisoners\r\n     of war, in charge of Colonel Duckworth, for Jackson. At\r\n     Brownsville they rested over night. The following morning two\r\n     companies were detailed by Colonel Duckworth to proceed to\r\n     Jackson with the prisoners.\r\n\r\n     After they had started, and proceeded a very short distance, five\r\n     soldiers were recalled by Colonel Duckworth, and were conferred\r\n     with by him; they then rejoined the column, and after proceeding\r\n     about five miles from Brownsville the column was halted, and\r\n     Major Bradford taken about fifty yards from the roadside and\r\n     deliberately shot by the five men who had been recalled by\r\n     Colonel Duckworth, and his body left unburied upon the ground\r\n     where he fell.\r\n\r\n     He now lies buried near the spot, and, if you desire, you can\r\n     easily satisfy yourself of the truth of what I assert. I beg\r\n     leave to say to you that this transaction hardly justifies your\r\n     remark, that your operations have been conducted on civilized\r\n     principles, and until you take some steps to bring the\r\n     perpetrators of this outrage to justice, the world will not fail\r\n     to believe that it had your sanction.\r\n\r\n                         I am, General, your obedient servant,\r\n                            C. C. WASHBURN, _Major-General Commanding_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FORREST TO GENERAL WASHBURN.\r\n\r\n                                   HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY, }\r\n                                      TUPELO, MISS., June 20, 1864.}\r\n\r\n     Major-General C. C. WASHBURN, _Commanding U. S. Forces, Memphis,\r\n     Tenn_.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt (per flag of\r\n     truce) of your letter of the seventeenth instant, addressed to\r\n     Major-General S. D. Lee, or officer commanding Confederate forces\r\n     near Tupelo. I have forwarded it to General Lee, with a copy of\r\n     this letter.\r\n\r\n     I regard your letter as discourteous to the commanding officer of\r\n     this department, and grossly insulting to myself.\r\n\r\n     You seek by implied threats to intimidate him, and assume the\r\n     privilege of denouncing me as a murderer, and as guilty of the\r\n     wholesale slaughter of the garrison at Fort Pillow, and found\r\n     your assertion upon the _ex parte_ testimony of (your friends)\r\n     the enemies of myself and country. I shall not enter into the\r\n     discussion, therefore, of any of the questions involved, nor\r\n     undertake any refutation of the charges made by you against\r\n     myself; nevertheless, as a matter of personal privilege alone, I\r\n     unhesitatingly say that they are unfounded and unwarranted by the\r\n     facts. But whether those charges are true or false, they, with\r\n     the question you ask, as to whether negro troops, when captured,\r\n     will be recognized and treated as prisoners of war, subject to\r\n     exchange, etc., are matters which the governments of the United\r\n     States and Confederate States are to decide and adjust, not their\r\n     subordinate officers. I regard captured negroes as I do other\r\n     captured property, and not as captured soldiers; but as to how\r\n     regarded by my government, and the disposition which has been and\r\n     will hereafter be made of them, I respectfully refer you, through\r\n     the proper channel, to the authorities at Richmond. It is not the\r\n     policy or the interest of the South to destroy the negro; on the\r\n     contrary to preserve and protect him, and all who have\r\n     surrendered to us have received kind and humane treatment.\r\n\r\n     Since the war began I have captured many thousand Federal\r\n     prisoners, and they, including the survivors of the \"Fort Pillow\r\n     Massacre,\" \"black and white,\" are living witnesses of the fact\r\n     that with my knowledge or consent, or by my order, not one of\r\n     them has ever been insulted, or in any way maltreated.\r\n\r\n     You speak of your forbearance in not giving your negro troops\r\n     instructions and orders as to the course they should pursue in\r\n     regard to Confederate soldiers that might fall into their (your)\r\n     hands, which clearly conveys to my mind two very distinct\r\n     impressions. The first is, that in not giving them instructions\r\n     and orders, you have left the matter entirely to the discretion\r\n     of the negroes as to how they should dispose of prisoners.\r\n     Second, an implied threat to give such orders as will lead to\r\n     \"consequences too fearful\" for contemplation. In confirmation of\r\n     the correctness of the first impression (which your language now\r\n     fully develops), refer most respectfully to my letter from the\r\n     battle-field, Tishemingo Creek, and forwarded you by flag of\r\n     truce on the fourteenth instant. As to the second impression, you\r\n     seem disposed to take into your own hands the settlements which\r\n     belong to, and can only be settled by, your government; but if\r\n     you are prepared to take upon yourself the responsibility of\r\n     inaugurating a system of warfare contrary to civilized usages,\r\n     the onus as well as the consequences will be chargeable to\r\n     yourself.\r\n\r\n     Deprecating, as I should do, such a state of affairs; determined,\r\n     as I am, not to be instrumental in bringing it about; feeling and\r\n     knowing, as I do, that I have the approval of my government, my\r\n     people, and my conscience as to the past, and with the firm\r\n     belief that I will be sustained by them in my future policy, it\r\n     is left with you to determine what that policy shall be, whether\r\n     in accordance with the laws of civilised nations, or in violation\r\n     of them.\r\n\r\n                              I am, General, yours, very respectfully,\r\n                                   N. B. FORREST, _Major-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FORREST TO GENERAL WASHBURN.\r\n\r\n                                   HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY, }\r\n                                      IN THE FIELD, June 23, 1864. }\r\n\r\n     Major-General C. C. WASHBURN, _Commanding District of West\r\n     Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn._:\r\n\r\n     Your communication of the nineteenth inst. is received, in which\r\n     you say \"you are left in doubt as to the course the Confederate\r\n     government intends to pursue hereafter in regard to colored\r\n     troops.\"\r\n\r\n     Allow me to say that this is a subject upon which I did not and\r\n     do not propose to enlighten you. It is a matter to be settled by\r\n     our governments through their proper officers, and I respectfully\r\n     refer you to them for a solution of your doubts.\r\n\r\n     You ask me to state whether \"I contemplate either their slaughter\r\n     or their return to slavery.\" I answer that I slaughter no man\r\n     except in open warfare, and that my prisoners, both white and\r\n     black, are turned over to my government to be dealt with as it\r\n     may direct. My government is in possession of all the facts as\r\n     regards my official conduct, and the operations of my command\r\n     since I entered the service, and if you desire a proper\r\n     discussion and decision, I refer you again to the President of\r\n     the Confederate States. I would not have you understand, however,\r\n     that in a matter of so much importance I am indisposed to place\r\n     at your command and disposal any facts desired, when applied for\r\n     in a manner becoming an officer holding your rank and position,\r\n     for it is certainly desirable to every one occupying a public\r\n     position to be placed right before the world, and there has been\r\n     no time since the capture of Fort Pillow, that I would not have\r\n     furnished all the facts connected with its capture, had they been\r\n     applied for properly, but now the matter rests with the two\r\n     governments. I have, however, for your information, enclosed you\r\n     copies of the official correspondence between the commanding\r\n     officers at Fort Pillow and myself; also copies of a statement of\r\n     Captain Young, the senior officer of that garrison, together with\r\n     (sufficient) extracts from a report of the affair by my A. D. C.,\r\n     Captain Chas. W. Anderson, which I approve and endorse as\r\n     correct.\r\n\r\n     As to the death of Major Bradford, I knew nothing of it until\r\n     eight or ten days after it is said to have occurred.\r\n\r\n     On the thirteenth (the day after the capture of Fort Pillow) I\r\n     went to Jackson, and the report I had of the affair was this:\r\n     Major Bradford was, with other officers, sent to the headquarters\r\n     of Colonel McCulloch, and all the prisoners were in charge of one\r\n     of McCulloch's regiments. Bradford requested the privilege of\r\n     attending the burial of his brother, which was granted, he giving\r\n     his parole of honor to return. Instead of returning, he changed\r\n     his clothing and started for Memphis. Some of my men were hunting\r\n     deserters, and came on Bradford just as he had landed on the\r\n     south bank of the Hatchie, and arrested him. When arrested, he\r\n     claimed to be a Confederate soldier belonging to Bragg's army;\r\n     that he had been on furlough, and was then on his way to join his\r\n     command.\r\n\r\n     As he could show no papers he was believed to be a deserter, and\r\n     was taken to Covington, and not until he was recognized and\r\n     spoken to by citizens did the guards know that he was Bradford.\r\n\r\n     He was sent by Colonel Duckworth, or taken by him, to\r\n     Brownsville.\r\n\r\n     All of Chalmers's command went from Brownsville, _via_ La Grange,\r\n     and as all the other prisoners had been gone some time, and there\r\n     was no chance for them to catch up and place Bradford with them,\r\n     he was ordered by Colonel Duckworth or General Chalmers to be\r\n     sent south to me at Jackson.\r\n\r\n     I knew nothing of the matter until eight or ten days afterwards I\r\n     heard that his body was found near Brownsville. I understand that\r\n     he attempted to escape and was shot. If he was improperly killed,\r\n     nothing would afford me more pleasure than to punish the\r\n     perpetrators to the full extent of the law, and to show you how I\r\n     regard such transactions.\r\n\r\n     I can refer you to my demand on Major-General Hurlbut (no doubt\r\n     upon file in your office) for the delivery to Confederate\r\n     authorities of one Colonel Fielding Hurst and others of his\r\n     regiment, who deliberately took out and killed seven Confederate\r\n     soldiers, one of whom they left to die after cutting off his\r\n     tongue, punching out his eyes, splitting his mouth on each side\r\n     to his ears, and cutting off his privates. I have mentioned and\r\n     given you these facts in order that you may have no further\r\n     excuse or apology for referring to these matters in connection\r\n     with myself, and to evince to you my determination to do all in\r\n     my power to avoid the responsibility of causing the adoption of\r\n     the policy which you have determined to press. In your letter you\r\n     acknowledge the fact that the negro troops did take an oath on\r\n     bended knees to show no quarters to my men, and you say further\r\n     \"you have no doubt they went to the battle-field expecting to be\r\n     slaughtered,\" and admit, also, the probability of their having\r\n     proclaimed on their march that no quarter would be shown us. Such\r\n     being the case, why do you ask for the disavowal on the part of\r\n     the commanding general of this department of the government, in\r\n     regard to the loss of life at Tishemingo Creek? That your troops\r\n     expected to be slaughtered, appears to me, after the oath they\r\n     took, to be a very reasonable and natural expectation. Yet you\r\n     who sent them out, knowing and now admitting that they had sworn\r\n     to such a policy, are complaining of atrocities, and demanding\r\n     acknowledgments and disavowals on the part of the very men you\r\n     sent forth sworn to slay whenever in your power.\r\n\r\n     I will, in all candor and truth, say to you that I had only heard\r\n     these things, but did not believe them; indeed, did not attach to\r\n     them the importance they deserved, nor did I know of the\r\n     threatened vengeance as proclaimed along the line of march until\r\n     the contest was over. Had I and my men known it, as you admit it,\r\n     the battle of Tishemingo Creek would have been noted as the\r\n     bloodiest battle of the war. That you sanctioned this policy is\r\n     plain, for you say now \"that if the negro is treated as a\r\n     prisoner of war, you will receive with pleasure the announcement,\r\n     and will explain the facts to your colored troops, and _desire_\r\n     (not _order_) that they recall the oath; but if they are to be\r\n     either slaughtered or returned to slavery, let the oath stand.\"\r\n     Your rank forbids a doubt as to the fact that you and every\r\n     officer and man of your department are identified with the policy\r\n     and responsible for it, and I shall not permit you,\r\n     notwithstanding by your studied language in both your\r\n     communications you seek to limit the operations of your unholy\r\n     scheme, and visit its terrible consequences alone upon that\r\n     ignorant, deluded, but unfortunate people, the negroes, whose\r\n     destruction you are planning in order to accomplish ours. The\r\n     negroes have our sympathy, and, so far as consistent with safety,\r\n     we will spare them at the expense of those who are alone\r\n     responsible for the inauguration of a worse than savage warfare.\r\n\r\n     Now, in conclusion, I demand a plain and unqualified answer to\r\n     two questions, and then I have done with further correspondence\r\n     with you on this subject. This matter must be settled. In battle\r\n     and on the battle-field do you intend to slaughter my men who\r\n     fall into your hands? If you do not intend so to do, will they be\r\n     treated as prisoners of war?\r\n\r\n     I have over two thousand of Sturgis's command prisoners, and will\r\n     hold every officer and private hostage until I receive your\r\n     declarations, and am satisfied that you carry out in good faith\r\n     the answers you make, and until I am assured that no Confederate\r\n     soldier has been foully dealt with from the day of the battle of\r\n     Tishemingo Creek to this time. It is not yet too late for you to\r\n     retrace your steps and arrest the storm.\r\n\r\n     Relying, as I do, upon that Divine power which in wisdom disposes\r\n     of all things; relying also upon the support and approval of my\r\n     government and countrymen, and the unflinching bravery and\r\n     endurance of my troops; and with a consciousness that I have done\r\n     nothing to produce, but all in my power, consistent with honor\r\n     and the personal safety of myself and command, to prevent it, I\r\n     leave with you the responsibility of bringing about, to use your\r\n     own language, \"a state of affairs too fearful to contemplate.\"\r\n\r\n                              I am, General, yours, very respectfully,\r\n                                   N.

I\r\n     therefore demand an unconditional surrender of all your forces.\r\n     Your heroic defence will entitle you to be treated as prisoners\r\n     of war, but the surrender must be unconditional.

I ask one hour for consultation with\r\n     my officers and the commander of gunboat No. 7, at this place. I\r\n     have the honor to be\r\n\r\n          Your obedient servant,\r\n               L.

I ask only\r\n     for the surrender of Fort Pillow, with men and munitions of war.\r\n     You have twenty minutes for consideration. At the expiration of\r\n     that time, if you do not capitulate, I will assault your works.\r\n\r\n                         Your obedient servant,\r\n                              FORREST, _Major-General, Commanding_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES FORCES,     }\r\n                         FORT PILLOW, TENNESSEE, April 12, 1864.}\r\n\r\n     Major-General FORREST, _Commanding Confederate Forces_:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: Your second demand for the surrender of my forces is\r\n     received.

Scroggs, that I\r\n     should make a statement of the treatment of the Federal dead and\r\n     wounded at Fort Pillow, has been made known to me. Details from\r\n     Federal prisoners were made to collect the dead and wounded. The\r\n     dead were buried by their surviving comrades. I saw no ill\r\n     treatment of their wounded on the evening of the battle, or next\r\n     morning. My friend, Lieutenant Leaming, Adjutant Thirteenth\r\n     Tennessee Cavalry, was left wounded in the sutler's store near\r\n     the fort, also a lieutenant Sixth U. S. Artillery; both were\r\n     alive next morning, and sent on board U. S. transport, among many\r\n     other wounded. Among the wounded were some colored troops--I\r\n     don't know how many.\r\n\r\n     Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n      JNO. T. YOUNG, _Captain, Twenty-fourth Missouri Volunteers_.\r\n\r\n     P. S.--I have examined a report said to be made by Captain\r\n     Anderson (of) A. D. C. to Major-General Forrest, appendix to\r\n     General Forrest's report, in regard to making disposition of\r\n     Federal wounded left on the field at Fort Pillow, and think it is\r\n     correct.

B. FORREST, _Commanding Confederate Forces, near\r\n     Tupelo_:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: Your communications of the twentieth and twenty-third\r\n     ult. are received. Of the tone and temper of both I do not\r\n     complain. The desperate fortunes of a bad cause excuse much\r\n     irritation of temper, and I pass it by. Indeed, I received it as\r\n     a favorable augury, and as evidence that you are not indifferent\r\n     to the opinions of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the Fort Pillow affair, it is useless to prolong the\r\n     discussion.\r\n\r\n     I shall forward your report, which you did me the favor to\r\n     enclose, to my government, and you will receive the full benefit\r\n     of it.\r\n\r\n     The record is now made up, and a candid world will judge of it. I\r\n     beg leave to send you herewith a copy of the report of the\r\n     Investigating Committee from the United States Congress on the\r\n     affair. In regard to the treatment of Major Bradford, I refer you\r\n     to the testimony contained in that report, from which you will\r\n     see that he was not attempting to escape when shot. It will be\r\n     easy to bring the perpetrators of the outrage to justice if you\r\n     so desire.\r\n\r\n     I will add to what I have heretofore said, that I have it from\r\n     responsible and truthful citizens of Brownsville, that when Major\r\n     Bradford was started under an escort from your headquarters at\r\n     Jackson, General Chalmers remarked that \"he would never reach\r\n     there.\"\r\n\r\n     You call attention, apparently as an offset to this affair of\r\n     Major Bradford, to outrages said to have been committed by\r\n     Colonel Fielding Hurst and others of his regiment (Sixth\r\n     Tennessee Cavalry). The outrages, if committed as stated by you,\r\n     are disgraceful and abhorrent to every brave and sensitive mind.\r\n\r\n     On receiving your letter I sent at once for Colonel Hurst, and\r\n     read him the extract pertaining to him. He indignantly denies the\r\n     charge against him, and until you furnish me the names of the\r\n     parties murdered, and the time when, and the place where, the\r\n     offence was committed, with the names of witnesses, it is\r\n     impossible for me to act. When you do that, you may rest assured\r\n     that I shall use every effort in my power to have the parties\r\n     accused tried, and if found guilty, properly punished.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the treatment of colored soldiers, it is evidently\r\n     useless to discuss the question further.\r\n\r\n     Your attempt to shift from yourself upon me the responsibility of\r\n     the inauguration of a \"worse than savage warfare,\" is too\r\n     strained and far-fetched to require any response. The full and\r\n     cumulative evidence contained in the Congressional Report I\r\n     herewith forward, points to _you_ as the person responsible for\r\n     the barbarisms already committed.\r\n\r\n     It was _your_ soldiers who, at Fort Pillow, raised the black\r\n     flag, and while shooting, bayoneting, and otherwise maltreating\r\n     the Federal prisoners in their hands, shouted to each other in\r\n     the hearing of their victims that it was done by \"Forrest's\r\n     orders.\"\r\n\r\n     Thus far I cannot learn that you have made any disavowal of these\r\n     barbarities.\r\n\r\n     Your letters to me inform me confidently that you have always\r\n     treated our prisoners according to the rules of civilized\r\n     warfare, but your disavowal of the Fort Pillow barbarities, if\r\n     you intend to make any, should be full, clear, explicit, and\r\n     published to the world.\r\n\r\n     The United States Government is, as it always has been, lenient\r\n     and forbearing, and it is not yet too late for you to secure for\r\n     yourself and your soldiers a continuance of the treatment due to\r\n     honorable warriors, by a public disclaimer of barbarities already\r\n     committed, and a vigorous effort to punish the wretches who\r\n     committed them.\r\n\r\n     But I say to you now, clearly and unequivocally, that such\r\n     measure of treatment as you mete out to Federal soldiers will be\r\n     measured to you again.\r\n\r\n     If you give no quarter, you need expect none. If you observe the\r\n     rules of civilized warfare, and treat our prisoners in accordance\r\n     with the laws of war, your prisoners will be treated, as they\r\n     ever have been, with kindness.\r\n\r\n     If you depart from these principles, you may expect such\r\n     retaliation as the laws of war justify.\r\n\r\n     That you may know what the laws of war are, as understood by my\r\n     Government, I beg leave to enclose a copy of General Orders No.\r\n     100 from the War Department Adjutant-General's Office,\r\n     Washington, April twenty-four, 1863.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honor to be, sir,\r\n                              Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                   C.

C. WASHBURN, _Commanding Federal Forces at\r\n     Memphis, Tennessee_:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: I am in receipt of your letter of the seventeenth inst.,\r\n     and have also before me the reply of Major-General Forrest\r\n     thereto. Though that reply is full, and approved by me, yet I\r\n     deem it proper to communicate with you upon a subject so\r\n     seriously affecting our future conduct and that of the troops\r\n     under our respective commands.\r\n\r\n     Your communication is by no means respectful to me, and is by\r\n     implication insulting to Major-General Forrest. This, however, is\r\n     overlooked in consideration of the important character of its\r\n     contents.\r\n\r\n     You assume as correct an exaggerated statement of the\r\n     circumstances attending the capture of Fort Pillow, relying\r\n     solely upon the evidence of those who would naturally give a\r\n     distorted history of the affair.\r\n\r\n     No demand for an explanation has ever been made either by\r\n     yourself or your government, a course which would certainly\r\n     recommend itself to every one desirous of hearing truth; but, on\r\n     the contrary, you seem to have been perfectly willing to allow\r\n     your soldiers to labor under false impressions upon a subject\r\n     involving such terrible consequences. Even the formality of\r\n     parades and oaths have been resorted to for the purpose of\r\n     inciting your colored troops to the perpetration of deeds which,\r\n     you say, \"will lead to consequences too fearful to contemplate.\"\r\n\r\n     As commanding officer of this Department I desire to make the\r\n     following statement concerning the capture of Fort Pillow--a\r\n     statement supported in a great measure by the evidence of one of\r\n     your own officers captured at that place.\r\n\r\n     The version given by you and your government is untrue, and not\r\n     sustained by the facts to the extent that you indicate.\r\n\r\n     The garrison was summoned in the usual manner, and its commanding\r\n     officer assumed the responsibility of refusing to surrender after\r\n     having been informed by General Forrest of his ability to take\r\n     the fort, and of his fears as to what the result would be in case\r\n     the demand was not complied with.\r\n\r\n     The assault was made under a heavy fire, and with considerable\r\n     loss to the attacking party.\r\n\r\n     Your colors were never lowered, but retreated from the fort to\r\n     the cover of the gunboats, with arms in their hands, and\r\n     constantly using them.\r\n\r\n     This was true, particularly of your colored troops, who had been\r\n     firmly convinced by your teachings of the certainty of their\r\n     slaughter in case of capture. Even under these circumstances many\r\n     of your men--white and black--were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n     I respectfully refer you to history for numerous cases of\r\n     indiscriminate slaughter, even under less aggravated\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     It is generally conceded by all military precedents that where\r\n     the issue has been fairly presented, and the ability displayed,\r\n     fearful results are expected to follow a refusal to surrender.\r\n\r\n     The case under consideration is almost an extreme one.\r\n\r\n     You had a servile race armed against their masters, and in a\r\n     country which had been desolated by almost unprecedented\r\n     outrages.\r\n\r\n     I assert that our officers, with all these circumstances against\r\n     them, endeavored to prevent the effusion of blood; and, as\r\n     evidence of this, I refer you to the fact that both white and\r\n     colored prisoners were taken, and are now in our hands.\r\n\r\n     As regards the battle of Tishemingo Creek, the statements of your\r\n     negro witnesses are not to be relied on. In this panic they acted\r\n     as might have been expected from their previous impressions. I do\r\n     not think many of them were killed--they are yet wandering over\r\n     the country, attempting to return to their masters.\r\n\r\n     With reference to the status of those captured at Tishemingo\r\n     Creek and Fort Pillow, I will state that, unless otherwise\r\n     ordered by my government, they will not be regarded as prisoners\r\n     of war, but will be retained and humanely treated, subject to\r\n     such future instructions as may be indicated.\r\n\r\n     Your letter contains many implied threats; these you can of\r\n     course make, and you are fully entitled to any satisfaction that\r\n     you may feel from having made them.\r\n\r\n     It is my intention, and that also of my subordinates, to conduct\r\n     this war upon civilized principles, provided you permit us to do\r\n     so; and I take this occasion to state that we will not shrink\r\n     from any responsibilities that your actions may force upon us.\r\n\r\n     We are engaged in a struggle for the protection of our homes and\r\n     firesides, for the maintenance of our national existence and\r\n     liberty; we have counted the cost and are prepared to go to any\r\n     extremes; and although it is far from our wish to fight under the\r\n     \"black flag,\" still, if you drive us to it, we will accept the\r\n     issue.\r\n\r\n     Your troops virtually fought under it at the battle of Tishemingo\r\n     Creek, and the prisoners taken there state that they went into\r\n     battle with the impression that they were to receive no quarter,\r\n     and I suppose with the determination to give none.\r\n\r\n     I will further remark that if it is raised, so far as your\r\n     soldiers are concerned, there can be no distinction, for the\r\n     unfortunate people whom you pretend to be aiding are not\r\n     considered entirely responsible for their acts, influenced as\r\n     they are by the superior intellect of their white brothers.\r\n\r\n     I enclose for your consideration certain papers touching the Fort\r\n     Pillow affair, which were procured from the writer after the\r\n     exaggerated statements of your press were seen.\r\n\r\n               I am, General, very respectfully,\r\n                    Your obedient servant,\r\n                         S. D. LEE, _Lieutenant-General, Commanding_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ENCLOSURE IN THE FOREGOING.\r\n\r\n                                   CAHABA, ALABAMA, May 16, 1864.\r\n\r\n     I was one of the bearers of the flag of truce, on the part of the\r\n     United States authorities, at Fort Pillow. A majority of the\r\n     officers of the garrison doubted whether General Forrest was\r\n     present, and had the impression that it was a ruse to induce the\r\n     surrender of the fort. At the second meeting of the flag of\r\n     truce, General Forrest announced himself as being General\r\n     Forrest; but the officers who accompanied the flag, being\r\n     unacquainted with the General, doubted his word, and it was the\r\n     opinion of the garrison, at the time of the assault, that General\r\n     Forrest was not in the vicinity of the fort. The commanding\r\n     officer refused to surrender. When the final assault was made, I\r\n     was captured at my post, inside the works, and have been treated\r\n     as a prisoner of war.\r\n\r\n               JOHN T.

D. LEE, _Commanding Department Alabama,\r\n     Mississippi and East Louisiana, C. S. A., Meridian, Miss.:_\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: Your letter of the twenty-eighth ult., in reply to mine\r\n     of the seventeenth ult., is received.\r\n\r\n     The discourtesy which you profess to discover in my letter I\r\n     utterly disclaim. Having already discussed at length, in a\r\n     correspondence with Major-General Forrest, the Fort Pillow\r\n     massacre, as well as the policy to be pursued in regard to\r\n     colored troops, I do not regard it necessary to say more on those\r\n     subjects. As you state that you fully approve of the letter sent\r\n     by General Forrest to me, in answer to mine of the seventeenth\r\n     ult., I am forced to presume that you fully approve of his action\r\n     at Fort Pillow.\r\n\r\n     Your arguments in support of that action confirm such\r\n     presumption. You state that the \"version given by me and my\r\n     government is not true, and not sustained by the facts to the\r\n     extent I indicate.\" You furnish a statement of a certain Captain\r\n     Young, who was captured at Fort Pillow, and is now a prisoner in\r\n     your hands. How far the statement of a prisoner under duress and\r\n     in the position of Captain Young should go to disprove the sworn\r\n     testimony of the hundred eye-witnesses who had ample opportunity\r\n     of seeing and knowing, I am willing that others shall judge.\r\n\r\n     In relying, as you do, upon this certificate of Captain Young,\r\n     you confess that all better resources are at an end.\r\n\r\n     You are welcome to all the relief that that certificate is\r\n     calculated to give you. Does he say that our soldiers were not\r\n     inhumanly treated? No. Does he say that he was in a position to\r\n     see in case they had been mistreated? No. He simply says that \"he\r\n     saw no ill-treatment of their wounded.\" If he was in a position\r\n     to see and know what took place, it was easy for him to say so.\r\n\r\n     I yesterday sent to Major-General Forrest a copy of the report of\r\n     the Congressional Investigating Committee, and I hope it may fall\r\n     into your hands. You will find there the record of inhuman\r\n     atrocities, to find a parallel for which you will search the page\r\n     of history in vain. Men--white men and black men--were crucified\r\n     and burned; others were hunted by bloodhounds; while others, in\r\n     their anguish, were made the sport of men more cruel than the\r\n     dogs by which they were hunted.\r\n\r\n     I have also sent to my government copies of General Forrest's\r\n     reports, together with the certificate of Captain Young.\r\n\r\n     The record in the case is plainly made up, and I leave it. You\r\n     justify and approve it, and appeal to history for precedents.\r\n\r\n     As I have said, history furnishes no parallel. True, there are\r\n     instances where, after a long and protracted resistance,\r\n     resulting in heavy loss to the assailing party, the garrison has\r\n     been put to the sword, but I know of no such instance that did\r\n     not bring dishonor upon the commander that ordered or suffered\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     There is no Englishman that would not gladly forget Badajos, nor\r\n     a Frenchman that exults when Jaffa or the Caves of Dahra and\r\n     Shelas are spoken of. The massacre of Glencoe, which the world\r\n     has read of with horror, for nearly two hundred years, pales into\r\n     insignificance before the truthful recital of Fort Pillow.\r\n\r\n     The desperate defence of the Alamo was the excuse for the\r\n     slaughter of its brave survivors after its surrender, yet that\r\n     act was received with just execration, and we are told by the\r\n     historian that it led more than anything else to the independence\r\n     of Texas.\r\n\r\n     At the battle of San Jacinto the Texans rushed into action with\r\n     the war-cry, \"Remember the Alamo,\" and carried all before them.\r\n\r\n     You will seek in vain for consultation in history, pursue the\r\n     inquiry as far as you may.\r\n\r\n     Your desire to shift the responsibility of the Fort Pillow\r\n     massacre, or to find excuses for it, is not strange. But the\r\n     responsibility still remains where it belongs, and there it will\r\n     remain.\r\n\r\n     In my last letter to General Forrest I stated that the treatment\r\n     which Federal soldiers received would be their guide hereafter,\r\n     and that if you give no quarter you need expect none. If you\r\n     observe the rules of civilized warfare I shall rejoice at it, as\r\n     no one can regret more than myself a resort to such measures as\r\n     the laws of war justify towards an enemy that gives no quarter.\r\n\r\n     Your remark that our colored soldiers \"will not be regarded as\r\n     prisoners of war, but will be retained and humanely treated,\"\r\n     indicating that you consider them as of more worth and importance\r\n     than your own soldiers who are now in our hands, is certainly\r\n     very complimentary to the colored troops, though but a tardy\r\n     acknowledgment of their bravery and devotion as soldiers; but\r\n     such fair words can neither do justice to the colored soldiers\r\n     who were butchered at Fort Pillow after they had surrendered to\r\n     their victors, nor relieve yourself, General Forrest, and the\r\n     troops serving under you, from the fearful responsibility now\r\n     resting upon you for those wanton and unparalleled barbarities.\r\n\r\n     I concur in your remarks that if the black flag is once raised,\r\n     there can be no distinction so far as our soldiers are concerned.\r\n     No distinction in this regard as to color is known to the laws of\r\n     war, and you may rest assured that the outrages we complain of\r\n     are felt by our white soldiers, no less than by our black ones,\r\n     as insults to their common banner, the flag of the United States.\r\n\r\n     I will close by a reference to your statement that many of our\r\n     colored soldiers \"are yet wandering over the country attempting\r\n     to return to their masters.\" If this remark is intended for a\r\n     joke, it is acknowledged as a good one; but, if stated as a fact,\r\n     permit me to correct your misapprehensions by informing you that\r\n     most of them have returned to their respective commands, their\r\n     search for their late \"masters\" having proved bootless; and I\r\n     think I do not exaggerate in assuring you that there is not a\r\n     colored soldier here who does not prefer the fate of his comrades\r\n     at Fort Pillow to being returned to his \"master.\"\r\n\r\n               I remain, General,\r\n                    Yours, very respectfully,\r\n                         C. C. WASHBURN, _Major-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN J. T. YOUNG TO GENERAL WASHBURN.\r\n\r\n                              MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, September 13, 1864.\r\n\r\n     Major-General C. C. WASHBURN, Commanding District West Tennessee:\r\n\r\n     GENERAL: I have the honor to address you in regard to certain\r\n     papers forwarded you by Major-General Forrest, of the so-called\r\n     Confederate army, signed by me under protest, whilst a prisoner\r\n     of war at Cahaba, Alabama. I would first call your attention to\r\n     the manner by which these papers were procured. About\r\n     twenty-seventh April last, all Federal prisoners (except colored\r\n     soldiers) were sent to Andersonville and Macon, Georgia, myself\r\n     among the number. About ten days after my arrival at Macon\r\n     prison, a Confederate captain, with two men as guard, came to\r\n     that prison with an order for me to return to Cahaba. I appealed\r\n     to the officer in command to know why I was taken from the other\r\n     officers, but received no explanation. Many of my friends among\r\n     the Federal officers who had been prisoners longer than myself\r\n     felt uneasy at the proceedings, and advised me to make my escape\r\n     going back, as it was likely a subject of retaliation.\r\n     Consequently I felt considerable uneasiness of mind. On returning\r\n     to Cahaba, being quite unwell, I was placed in hospital, under\r\n     guard, with still no explanation from the military authorities.\r\n     On the day following, I was informed by a sick Federal officer,\r\n     also in hospital, that he had learned that I had been recognized\r\n     by some Confederate as a deserter from the Confederate army, and\r\n     that I was to be court-martialed and shot. The colored waiters\r\n     about the hospital told me the same thing, and although I knew\r\n     that the muster-rolls of my country would show that I had been in\r\n     the volunteer service since first May, 1861, I still felt uneasy,\r\n     having fresh in my mind Fort Pillow, and the summary manner the\r\n     Confederate officers have of disposing of men on some occasions.\r\n     With the above impressions on my mind, about three days after my\r\n     return to Cahaba I was sent for by the Provost Marshal, and\r\n     certain papers handed me, made out by General Forrest for my\r\n     signature. Looking over the papers, I found that signing them\r\n     would be an endorsement of General Forrest's official report of\r\n     the Fort Pillow affair. I of course returned the papers,\r\n     positively refusing to have anything to do with them. I was sent\r\n     for again the same day, with request to sign other papers of the\r\n     same tendency, but modified. I again refused to sign the papers,\r\n     but sent General Forrest a statement, that although I considered\r\n     some of the versions of the Fort Pillow affair, which I had read\r\n     in their own papers, said to be copied from Federal papers,\r\n     exaggerated, I also thought that his own official report was\r\n     equally so in some particulars.\r\n\r\n     Here the matter rested about one week, when I was sent for by\r\n     Colonel H. C. Davis, commander of post at Cahaba, who informed me\r\n     that General Forrest had sent P. T. Scroggs to see me, and have a\r\n     talk with me about the Fort Pillow fight; I found the judge very\r\n     affable and rather disposed to flatter me; he said that General\r\n     Forrest thought that I was a gentleman and a soldier, and that\r\n     the General had sent him (the judge) down to see me and talk to\r\n     me about the Fort Pillow fight; he then went on to tell over a\r\n     great many things that were testified to before the Military\r\n     Commission, which I was perfectly ignorant of, never having seen\r\n     the testimony. He then produced papers which General Forrest\r\n     wished me to sign. Upon examination, I found them about the same\r\n     as those previously shown me, and refused again to sign them, but\r\n     the Judge was very importunate, and finally prevailed on me to\r\n     sign the papers you have in your possession, pledging himself\r\n     that if I wished it they should only be seen by General Forrest\r\n     himself, that they were not intended to be used by him as\r\n     testimony, but merely for his own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     I hope, General, that these papers signed by me, or rather\r\n     extorted from me while under duress, will not be used by my\r\n     government to my disparagement, for my only wish is now, after\r\n     three years' service and over, to recruit my health, which has\r\n     suffered badly by imprisonment, and _go in for the war_.\r\n\r\n               I have the honor to be, General,\r\n                              Your obedient servant,\r\n               JOHN T. YOUNG,\r\n                   _Captain, Company A, Twenty-fourth Mo. Inf._[144]\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the material part of Gen. Forrest's\r\ndefence was extorted from Capt. John T. Young, an officer in the Union\r\nforces at Fort Pillow. He was sick and a prisoner in the hands of the\r\nrebels; and while in this condition he was compelled to sign the\r\npapers given above, which had been made out by Forrest himself. The\r\nlast letter of the correspondence shows that Capt. Young did not want\r\nthe papers used by the United States Government, because they were not\r\ntrue. Moreover, the despatches of Forrest to Major Bradford make no\r\nmention of retaliation. The despatches above are not true copies. For\r\ninstance, he demanded the surrender of Paducah on the 25th of March,\r\n1864, just before he took Fort Pillow, and this was his despatch:\r\n\r\n                                   H'DQU'RS FORREST'S CAVALRY CORPS, }\r\n                                   PADUCAH, March 23, 1864           }\r\n\r\n     To Col. HICKS, _Commanding Federal Forces at Paducah_:\r\n\r\n     Having a force amply sufficient to carry your works and reduce\r\n     the place, in order to avoid the unnecessary effusion of blood, I\r\n     demand the surrender of the fort and troops, with all the public\r\n     stores. If you surrender, you shall be treated as prisoners of\r\n     war; but, _if I have to storm your works, you may expect no\r\n     quarter_.\r\n\r\n                                   N. B. FORREST, _Maj.-Gen. Com'ding_.\r\n\r\nAnd on the 19th of April, 1864, the next day after the massacre at\r\nFort Pillow, Gen. Abe Buford demanded the surrender of Columbus,\r\nKentucky, in the following despatch:\r\n\r\n     _To the Commander of the United States Forces, Columbus. Ky.:_\r\n\r\n     Fully capable of taking Columbus and its garrison by force, I\r\n     desire to avoid shedding blood. I therefore demand the\r\n     unconditional surrender of the forces under your command. Should\r\n     you surrender, the negroes now in arms will be returned to their\r\n     masters. Should I be compelled to take the place by force, no\r\n     quarter will be shown negro troops whatever; white troops will be\r\n     treated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, sir, yours,\r\n                                        A. BUFORD, _Brig.-Gen._\r\n\r\nNow, as both Bradford and Booth were dead, it was impossible to learn\r\njust what language was used by Forrest in the despatches he sent them.\r\nBut from the testimony given above, the explanation of Capt. Young and\r\nthe language of the two despatches just quoted, addressed to the\r\ncommander of the Union forces at Paducah and Columbus, Kentucky,\r\nhistory has made out a case against Gen. Forrest that no human being\r\nwould covet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[144] Rebellion Records, vol. x. pp. 721-730.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 8.\r\n\r\n_THE FIRST DECADE OF FREEDOM._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nAN EDUCATED AFRICAN.\r\n\r\nDaniel Flickinger Wilberforce, a native African, and educated in\r\nAmerica, presents a striking illustration of the capabilities of the\r\nNegro. He was born a pagan, and when brought in contact with the\r\ninstitutions of civilization he outstripped those whose earlier life\r\nhad been impressed with the advantages of such surroundings. There was\r\nnothing in his blood, or in his early rearing, to develop him. He came\r\nfrom darkness himself as well as by his ancestry. Rev. Daniel K.\r\nFlickinger, D.D., has been secretary of the Home Frontier and Foreign\r\nMissionary Society for the past twenty-five years. He was the\r\ncompanion in Africa of George Thompson, and on one of his trips had a\r\nshort association with Livingstone. Dr. Flickinger aided in\r\nestablishing the United Brethren Mission on the Western Coast of\r\nAfrica, and has had his heart in it for a quarter of a century. During\r\nthat time he has made six trips to Africa to look after this mission;\r\nreturning from his last voyage in May, 1881. He has studied those\r\npeople and found them apt in the schools as well as in the acquiring\r\nof American customs in tilling the soil and in the trades. During Dr.\r\nFlickinger's first visit to Africa in 1855, while at Good Hope\r\nStation, Mendi Mission, located on the eastern banks of Sherbro\r\nIsland, latitude 7° north, and longitude 18° west, he employed a\r\nnative to watch over him at night as he slept in his hammock, there\r\nbeing wild and dangerous tribes in the vicinity. To that man in that\r\ntime was born a child. The father came to the missionaries the next\r\nday to tell them that his wife \"done born picin\" and wanted them to\r\ngive it a name. Mr. Burton, the missionary in charge, suggested that\r\nof Daniel Flickinger, and it was taken. The missionaries had performed\r\nthe usual marriage ceremony for as many as came within their reach,\r\nand broken up the former heathen customs in their immediate vicinity\r\nas far as possible, and this man was duly married. He took as his last\r\nname that of Wilberforce after the English philanthropist, who was\r\ndear to all Colored people, and from that time on this native and his\r\nfamily became attached to the mission, and were known by the name of\r\nWilberforce. This man had children born in heathendom and under quite\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\nDr. Flickinger soon afterward sailed for America, and soon forgot that\r\nhe had a namesake on the distant shore. He made other trips across the\r\nwater, but failed to come in contact with the Wilberforce family.\r\nSixteen years afterward, in 1871, he was in New York City shipping\r\ngoods to the African missionaries. The boxes, labelled \"Daniel K.\r\nFlickinger,\" were being loaded and unloaded at the American Mission\r\nRooms in that city, and the doctor noticed that the colored porter boy\r\nwas about half wild over something. He asked him if there was any\r\nthing wrong, but got no reply. The young porter kept rolling his eyes\r\nand acting half scared at the name on those boxes, and finally the\r\ndoctor asked him his name, to which there came the prompt reply,\r\nDaniel Flickinger Wilberforce! In his travels of a lifetime the\r\nmissionary had often been surprised, but this bewildered him. A\r\nthunder-bolt could not have shocked him more. Then the two stood\r\ngazing at each other in perfect amazement, and neither able to tell\r\nhow their names came to be so near alike. The boxes were forgotten.\r\nThe boy soon had his relief and began laughing as few others could\r\nlaugh, while the doctor was still unable to see through the mystery.\r\nHe gave the young fellow two shillings and told him to proceed with\r\nthe boxes. The doctor then began an investigation about the Mission\r\nRooms, and found that this boy, just a short time before that, had\r\nbeen brought over on a merchant vessel to care for an invalid\r\nmissionary lady during the voyage, that he had served a short time as\r\nbell-boy at a hotel, and that they had employed him in the Mission\r\nRooms, but had promised to send him back on the next sail vessel. The\r\ndoctor got his location in Africa and a complete chain of\r\ncircumstances such as to convince him that this was the boy that was\r\nnamed after him in 1855. He told the authorities at the American\r\nMission Rooms, to write to Africa and say that Dan. was well cared for\r\nover here, and for them to keep him till further advised. As soon as\r\nthe doctor made his shipments to the missionaries he returned to\r\nDayton and asked the Executive Committee of his Board if they would\r\nassist him in educating this African who had turned up in such a\r\nromantic manner. Consent was given, and young Wilberforce was shipped\r\nto Dayton. He was brought into Dr. Flickinger's office with the tag of\r\nan express company attached to his clothes--young, green, and, in\r\nfact, a raw recruit to the ranks of civilization. Seven years after\r\nthat he bid adieu to his friends in that same office, to return to his\r\npeople in Africa as a teacher, preacher, and physician. He was then\r\none of the finest scholars of his age in this country. When he arrived\r\nat Dayton he of course had to have a private tutor. He was sixteen\r\nyears old and had to start with the rudiments, but he was, at the\r\nbeginning of the next school year, able to join classes on which he\r\ndoubled right along. It requires a course of eight years to reach the\r\nHigh School, but in less than four years after his arrival in Dayton\r\nhe passed the examination for admission to the High School of Dayton,\r\nOhio, and was the first Colored pupil ever admitted to that school.\r\nSince then, other Colored pupils have annually been following his\r\nexample. The course in the High School was four years, and the Board\r\nand teachers were very particularly averse to gaining time. Owing to\r\nWilberforce's great aptness, that allowed him to go ahead of his\r\nclass, he gained one year then and there, and took the honors of the\r\nclass that started one year ahead of him. There were twenty-three\r\nmembers of that class. The Commencement was in the Opera-house at\r\nDayton in 1878, and on that occasion the President of the Board said,\r\nwithout discredit to any others, he felt called upon to make special\r\nmention of young Wilberforce, which he did in a handsome manner. This\r\nwas not all; the Missionary Society wanted to send Wilberforce to\r\nAfrica in September of that year, and as he went along they had him at\r\nother studies. He had become an excellent musician, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental. He had been studying theology and read Hebrew well. He\r\nhad also taken a course of reading in medicine, so that he might be of\r\nservice to the bodies as well as the souls of his brethren.\r\nMarvellous as it may seem, all of this was done in so short a time,\r\nand from a state of savage life up to civilized life; still it is\r\ntrue. And, besides, Wilberforce had been a reader of history and\r\ngeneral literature, and was a writer of unusual merit. His progress\r\nhas always and always will seem incredible, even to those who had\r\npersonal knowledge of him during the time that he had this experience\r\nof seven years. He had a remarkable mind, was born a heathen, had no\r\nyouthful advantages, and is to-day one of the best-informed and most\r\nthoroughly cultivated thinkers of his age. When he left Dayton in the\r\nsummer of 1878, he was greatly missed. At the Colored United Brethren\r\nChurch he was janitor, leader of a choir, organist, superintendent of\r\nthe Sunday-school, and class leader, and when the pastor failed,\r\nWilberforce also did the preaching. He was never proud. In the humble\r\ncapacity of janitor he took excellent care of Dr. Flickinger's office,\r\nand was willing and ready to do anything. He was modest socially, but\r\na favorite among his classmates, and not only respected but admired by\r\nall. He married a Dayton girl before he left for Africa, and has\r\nremained abroad since 1878, but he expects at no distant time to\r\nreturn to America to complete his professional studies. He belonged to\r\nthe Sherbro tribe or people, and with them he is now laboring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE'S PLAN OF COLONIZATION.\r\n\r\n     Now, my dear General, that you are about to enjoy some repose,\r\n     permit me to propose to you a scheme which may prove of great\r\n     benefit to the black part of the human race. Let us unite in the\r\n     purchase of a small estate, where we can attempt to free the\r\n     negroes and employ them simply as farm laborers.

WAITE,\r\n          of the District of Columbia; WILLIAM E. DODGE, of New York;\r\n          PHILLIPS BROOKS, of Massachusetts; DANIEL C. GILMAN, of\r\n          Maryland; JOHN A.

SLATER, of Connecticut:\r\n\r\n          GENTLEMEN.--It has pleased God to grant me prosperity in my\r\n          business, and to put it into my power to apply to charitable\r\n          uses a sum of money so considerable as to require the\r\n          counsel of wise men for the administration of it.\r\n\r\n          It is my desire at this time to appropriate to such uses the\r\n          sum of one million of dollars ($1,000,000 00); and I hereby\r\n          invite you to procure a charter of incorporation under which\r\n          a charitable fund may be held exempt from taxation, and\r\n          under which you shall organize; and I intend that the\r\n          corporation, as soon as formed, shall receive this sum in\r\n          trust to apply the income of it according to the\r\n          instructions contained in this letter.\r\n\r\n          The general object which I desire to have exclusively\r\n          pursued, is the uplifting of the lately emancipated\r\n          population of the Southern States, and their posterity, by\r\n          conferring on them the blessings of Christian education. The\r\n          disabilities formerly suffered by these people, and their\r\n          singular patience and fidelity in the great crisis of the\r\n          nation, establish a just claim on the sympathy and good will\r\n          of humane and patriotic men. I cannot but feel the\r\n          compassion that is due in view of their prevailing ignorance\r\n          which exists by no fault of their own.\r\n\r\n          But it is not only for their own sake, but also for the\r\n          safety of our common country, in which they have been\r\n          invested with equal political rights, that I am desirous to\r\n          aid in providing them with the means of such education as\r\n          shall tend to make them good men and good\r\n          citizens--education in which the instruction of the mind in\r\n          the common branches of secular learning shall be associated\r\n          with training in just notions of duty toward God and man, in\r\n          the light of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\n          The means to be used in the prosecution of the general\r\n          object above described, I leave to the discretion of the\r\n          corporation; only indicating, as lines of operation adapted\r\n          to the present condition of things, the training of teachers\r\n          from among the people requiring to be taught, if, in the\r\n          opinion of the corporation, by such limited selection the\r\n          purposes of the trust can be best accomplished; and the\r\n          encouragement of such institutions as are most effectually\r\n          useful in promoting this training of teachers.\r\n\r\n          I am well aware that the work herein proposed is nothing new\r\n          or untried. And it is no small part of my satisfaction in\r\n          taking this share in it, that I hereby associate myself with\r\n          some of the noblest enterprises of charity and humanity, and\r\n          may hope to encourage the prayers and toils of faithful men\r\n          and women who have labored and are still laboring in this\r\n          cause.\r\n\r\n          I wish the corporation which you are invited to constitute,\r\n          to consist at no time of more than twelve members, nor of\r\n          less than nine members for a longer time than may be\r\n          required for the convenient filling of vacancies, which I\r\n          desire to be filled by the corporation, and, when found\r\n          practicable, at its next meeting after the vacancy may\r\n          occur.\r\n\r\n          I designate as the first President of the corporation the\r\n          Honorable RUTHERFORD B. HAYES, of Ohio. I desire that it may\r\n          have power to provide from the income of the fund, among\r\n          other things, for expenses incurred by members in the\r\n          fulfilment of this trust, and for the expenses of such\r\n          officers and agents as it may appoint, and generally to do\r\n          all such acts as may be necessary for carrying out the\r\n          purposes of this trust. I desire, if it may be, that the\r\n          corporation may have full liberty to invest its funds\r\n          according to its own best discretion, without reference to,\r\n          or restriction by, any laws or rules, legal or equitable, of\r\n          any nature, regulating the mode of investment of trust\r\n          funds; only I wish that neither principal nor income be\r\n          expended in land or buildings, for any other purpose than\r\n          that of safe and productive investment for income. And I\r\n          hereby discharge the corporation, and its individual\r\n          members, so far as it is in my power so to do, of all\r\n          responsibility, except for the faithful administration of\r\n          this trust, according to their own honest understanding and\r\n          best judgment. In particular, also, I wish to relieve them\r\n          of any pretended claim on the part of any person, party,\r\n          sect, institution, or locality, to benefactions from this\r\n          fund, that may be put forward on any ground whatever; as I\r\n          wish every expenditure to be determined solely by the\r\n          convictions of the corporation itself as to the most useful\r\n          disposition of its gifts.\r\n\r\n          I desire that the doings of the corporation each year be\r\n          printed and sent to each of the State Libraries in the\r\n          United States, and to the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\n          In case the capital of the Fund should become impaired, I\r\n          desire that a part of the income, not greater than one half,\r\n          be invested, from year to year, until the capital be\r\n          restored to its original amount.\r\n\r\n          I purposely leave to the corporation the largest liberty of\r\n          making such changes in the methods of applying the income of\r\n          the Fund as shall seem from time to time best adapted to\r\n          accomplish the general object herein defined. But being\r\n          warned by the history of such endowments that they sometimes\r\n          tend to discourage rather than promote effort and\r\n          self-reliance on the part of beneficiaries, or to inure to\r\n          the advancement of learning instead of the dissemination of\r\n          it; or to become a convenience to the rich instead of a help\r\n          to those who need help, I solemnly charge my Trustees to use\r\n          their best wisdom in preventing any such defeat of the\r\n          spirit of this trust; so that my gift may continue to future\r\n          generations to be a blessing to the poor.\r\n\r\n          If at any time after the lapse of thirty-three years from\r\n          the date of this foundation it shall appear to the judgment\r\n          of three fourths of the members of this corporation that, by\r\n          reason of a change in social conditions, or by reason of\r\n          adequate and equitable public provision for education, or by\r\n          any other sufficient reason, there is no further serious\r\n          need of this Fund in the form in which it is at first\r\n          instituted, I authorize the corporation to apply the capital\r\n          of the Fund to the establishment of foundations subsidiary\r\n          to then already existing institutions of higher education,\r\n          in such wise as to make the educational advantages of such\r\n          institutions more freely accessible to poor students of the\r\n          colored race.\r\n\r\n          It is my wish that this trust be administered in no\r\n          partisan, sectional, or sectarian spirit, but in the\r\n          interest of a generous patriotism and an enlightened\r\n          Christian faith; and that the corporation about to be\r\n          formed, may continue to be constituted of men distinguished\r\n          either by honorable success in business, or by services to\r\n          literature, education, religion, or the State.\r\n\r\n          I am encouraged to the execution in this charitable\r\n          foundation of a long-cherished purpose, by the eminent\r\n          wisdom and success that has marked the conduct of the\r\n          Peabody Education Fund in a field of operation not remote\r\n          from that contemplated by this trust. I shall commit it to\r\n          your hands, deeply conscious how insufficient is our best\r\n          forecast to provide for the future that is known only to\r\n          God; but humbly hoping that the administration of it may be\r\n          so guided by divine wisdom, as to be, in its turn, an\r\n          encouragement to philanthropic enterprise on the part of\r\n          others, and an enduring means of good to our beloved country\r\n          and to our fellow-men.\r\n\r\n          I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your friend and\r\n          fellow-citizen,\r\n                                                       JOHN F.

The exact number of graduates cannot be ascertained,\r\nas these colleges do not keep a record of the nationality of their\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145] Correspondence of American Revolution, vol. iii. p. 547.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nHENRY HIGHLAND GARNET, D.D.\r\n\r\nThe career of this man, who died at Monrovia, Liberia, Feb. 14, 1882,\r\nwhere he was the Minister of the United States, was extraordinary.\r\nGrandson of a native African, brought over in a slave-trader, himself\r\nborn a slave, he was brought to Pennsylvania by his father, when he\r\nfled from slavery in 1824. Next we find him, at the age of seventeen,\r\nridiculed for studying Greek and Latin; then mobbed in a New Hampshire\r\nseminary; then dragged from a street car in Utica; then studying\r\ntheology with Dr. Beman in Troy, N. Y. Soon he was settled as a\r\nminister; afterward he travelled in Great Britain and on the Continent\r\nof Europe, and was sent by a Scottish Society as Presbyterian\r\nmissionary to Jamaica, West Indies. He returned to New York, and was\r\nlong the pastor of the Shiloh Presbyterian Church; his house escaping\r\nthe riots in 1863 \"by the foresight of his daughter, who wrenched off\r\nthe door plate.\" He was the first Colored man who ever spoke in public\r\nin the Capitol at Washington, having preached there Sunday, Feb. 12,\r\n1865. In 1881 he was appointed Minister to Liberia. Dr. Garnet was\r\nequal in ability to Frederick Douglass, and greatly his superior in\r\nlearning, especially excelling in logic and terse statement. We heard\r\nhim make a speech in 1865, which in force of reasoning, purity of\r\nlanguage, and propriety of utterance, was not unworthy of comparison\r\nwith a sermon of Bishop Thomson, or an address of George William\r\nCurtis. As he was \"a full-blooded Negro,\" he was a standing and\r\nunanswerable proof that the race is capable of all that has\r\ndistinguished MAN. How much of history and progress could be crowded\r\nin a memorial inscription for him! It might be something like this:\r\nBorn a slave in the country to which his grandfather was stolen away,\r\nhe competed, under the greatest disadvantages, with white men for the\r\nprizes of life; attaining the highest intellectual culture, and a\r\ncorresponding moral elevation, his career commanded universal respect\r\nin Europe and America, wherever he was known. He died the Minister of\r\nthe United States to a civilized nation in the land whence his\r\nbarbaric ancestors were stolen. To God, who \"hath made of one blood\r\nall nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath\r\ndetermined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their\r\nhabitation\" (Acts xvii: 26), be the glory. \"How unsearchable are His\r\njudgments, and His ways past finding out!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEBENEZER D. BASSETT.\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest diplomats the Negro race has produced is the\r\nHonorable Ebenezer D. Bassett, for nearly nine years the Resident\r\nMinister and Consul-General from the United States to Hayti. He was\r\nborn and educated in the State of Connecticut, and for many years was\r\nthe successful Principal of the Institute for Colored Youth at\r\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. As a classical scholar and for proficiency\r\nin the use of modern languages he has few equals among his race.\r\n\r\nReturning to this country, after years of honorable service abroad, he\r\nwas promoted by the Haytian Government to the position of Consul at\r\nNew York City, and at present is serving the Republic of Hayti. As an\r\nevidence of the high esteem in which he was held as an officer the\r\nfollowing documents attest:\r\n\r\n                              (COPY.)\r\n\r\n                                    DEPARTMENT OF STATE,         }\r\n                                    WASHINGTON, October 5, 1877. }\r\n\r\n     EBENEZER D.

You will transmit the latter to the\r\n     Minister of Foreign Affairs, and make arrangements for the\r\n     delivery of the original to the President when your successor\r\n     shall present his credentials.\r\n\r\n                    I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                         (Signed.)
